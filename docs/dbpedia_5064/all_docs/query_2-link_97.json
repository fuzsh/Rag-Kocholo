It would quite likely to be electrified with conductor bar, other wise maintaining tension could be quite complex.\n\nThere used to be a flat crossing in Melbourne, which had both lines electrified. One was the local commuter lines and the other was the tram; the former 1500v D.C. the latter 750! All done with wires and lots of in line insulators.\n\nIt’s not there now as the tram now goes over a new bridge (with the road it was on).\n\nTo my knowledge there aren’t any ‘flat’ crossings like Newark on the NR network electrified at AC.\n\nHowever there are plenty of diamond crossing with big angles. These work with very carefully positioned (registered) contact wire, or in older installations in low speed layouts one wire is simply immediately above the other and the profile of the pantograph head does the job.\n\nIf I understand the arrangement correctly, a cross contact bar works for crossings where there is an angle but going to the extreme of a right angle interface, the pantograph on the higher wire would clobber the lower wire.\n\nNewark has an angle of 44.6 degrees, but I'm not sure at what angle the cross contact bar would be for the pantograph to start hitting the lower wire rather than smoothly transitioning as you described .\n\nSomething like this, perchance?\n\nView attachment 68328\n\nThis is a Section Insulator, usually used at crossovers to keep wire runs electrically separate for sectioning purposes.\n\nA more modern version:\n\nView attachment 68329\n\nIt might be feasible to have 4 SIs (2 per track) either side of the ECML, but you'd have to squeeze another two in on each Newark Castle-Lincoln track between the two ECML tracks, and probably have to add new structures in to support the SIs (as they're really quite heavy!).

It may well have been possible to insulate a single tramway contact wire between two C&C wire runs, but doing it with 2 C&C wire runs crossing 2 C&C wire runs (of which the latter pair runs at 125mph), combined with our hugely restrictive loading gauge, makes it a very painful position indeed.\n\nA\n\nI believe that was at Kooyong (although Garry Keenor's Overhead Electrification for Railways book states that the tram voltage was 600V DC).

It may well be 600V, my mistake.\n\nAgreed it would be difficult for high speed, hence I think conductor bar would be the answer. (And the ECML is 100mph across the flat crossing, not that it makes much difference!)\n\nEdit: the Melbourne one I was thinking of is Burke Road, Gardiner. However there is another one still in use at Glen Huntly. You can see it on google street view.\n\nI bow to the wisdom of those who know what they are talking about, but for such as relatively short running distance (whatever direction) would it \"not be worth the hassle\" of arranging the necessary switching gear to electrically energise the crossing for the respective line as required and instead just have the whole thing neutral...? Thence all that needs to be \"taken care of\" is the challenges of mechanically conveying the pantograph from one side to the other.\n\nIt is absolutely not a problem electrically. It is exactly the same principle as any diamond crossing of which there are countless examples on the network. It is straightforward to keep everything segregated (if that is actually required, which is unlikely)\n\nThe issue is the pantograph. The pan head, in contact with the contact wire, needs to cross another two contact wires almost at right angles. Therefore the other contact wires must be at exactly the same height, which means they must be connected. Tensioning this arrangement conventionally is impossible - if the wire moved longitudinally (for any reason, but typically temperature), then it would pull the ‘perpendicular’ contact wires out of registration.\n\nTherefore some arrangement is necessary that fixes the wires firmly in position, and the best way to do that is with conductor bar. The crossing itself, and a short distance either side on all approaches would be one section, isolated from the normal sections by in line section insulators.\n\nTherefore some arrangement is necessary that fixes the wires firmly in position, and the best way to do that is with conductor bar.

Funny I never thought about the logistics of it until I saw this thread.\n\nWhat's even more fun is where you get trams and trolleybus wires crossing one another (given they do different things, both electrically and mechanically); I nearly missed a train in Linz once, stopping on the way to the station to look at a junction like that and figure out what was going on with the network of wires above my head, and how it worked..."
