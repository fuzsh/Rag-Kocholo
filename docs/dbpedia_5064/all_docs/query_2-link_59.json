        "text": "Škoda Transtech, member of the Škoda Transportation Group, handed over the first modern, bidirectional 100% low-floor ForCity Smart Artic tram to Tampere today. Nineteen modern vehicles worth more than 100 million EUR will gradually be delivered to the third largest city in Finland.\n\n“Tampere will receive a modern, technically proven solution suitable for harsh Northern conditions. The trams provide maximum comfort for passengers, for example, thanks to heated floors, double glazing or air conditioning for the summer months. The vehicles are based on proven solutions that we obtained during the manufacturing of vehicles for the capital Helsinki, for which we supplied a total of 72 trams,” says Zdeněk Majer, Member of the Board of Directors and Senior Vice President of Sales of the Škoda Transportation Group and added: “Our experienced employees across the entire Škoda Transportation Group worked on the development of trams for Tampere. We are also convinced that this new generation type of ForCity Smart Artic tram has great export potential,”\n\nTampere has ordered nineteen trams for the first stage of the newly emerging tram network, including ten-year full maintenance service. The contract also includes three additional options for up to 46 more vehicles. Another 29 trams will be delivered to Finland in the coming years for a new tram line connecting Helsinki and Espoo.\n\n“Given that the Škoda Transtech production plant in Otanmäki does not have the test track required for tests, it is necessary to perform some of them directly in Tampere. Therefore, some parts of the interior, such as upholstery, will be installed only after the installation of electrical equipment so that they do not interfere with measurement, adjustment and other tests. In addition, some of the tests are performed in remote mode, where a group of software engineers from Plzeň connects to the delivered tram testing the tram systems,” explains Juha Vierros, CEO of Škoda Transtech.\n\nThe ForCity Smart Artic Tampere bidirectional tram is 37.3 long, has a gauge of 1,435 mm, is fully low-floor and can accommodate up to 360 passengers. The vehicle also offers barrier-free access for wheelchair users and prams. The all-wheel drive and the robust design of the carbody with axles enable trouble-free operation in challenging climatic conditions.\n\nŠkoda Transtech is the largest manufacturer of rolling stock in Nordic countries. The company was founded in 1985. In 2015 it became part of the Škoda Transportation Group, and in 2018 it was completely taken over by the Škoda Transportation Group. Its main products include double-decker passenger coaches (operated as PushPull trains), low-floor trams and engineering products. It currently employs over 650 people."
