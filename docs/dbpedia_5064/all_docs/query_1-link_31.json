Two other cities—Turku (see Turku tram) and Vyborg (Finnish: Viipuri, Swedish: Viborg, Russian: Вы́борг; now part of Russia)—have had tram systems. Vyborg abandoned its trams in 1957 after it was ceded to the Soviet Union after the end of World War II. Turku withdrew its trams in 1972.\n\nIn August 2021 Tampere became the fourth city in Finland with a tram system and the second one to still have trams in service through the opening of the Tampere light rail system."
