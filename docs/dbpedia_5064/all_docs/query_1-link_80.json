        "text": "A gameplay guide and strategic walkthrough to the original Cities in Motion, a game developed by Colossal Order and released by Paradox Interactive in 2011. This guide is for the base Windows game with no DLC. Strategies should be applicable more widely.\n\nThe introductory sections describe approaches to Network Design, Development, Engineering, Vehicles and Staff, and Achievements.\n\nThe specifics of each campaign scenario are then outlined:\n\nBerlin Foundations\n\nA Relic of the Golden Age\n\nModernizing Vienna\n\nA City Divided\n\nThe Heiress of Helsinki\n\nVienna Goes Green\n\nBerlin Reunited\n\nHigh Living in Amsterdam\n\nFinancial Crisis\n\nHelsinki Olympic Games\n\nPart with Petrol\n\nThe Fair City\n\nNetwork Design\n\nCities in Motion assumes:\n\nModes differ in efficiency: Bus is low-volume and cheap to operate, metro is high-volume and expensive, tram in between. Ferry (mid-volume over water) and helicopter (low-volume over distance) are generally only appropriate where geography limits land-based options.\n\nEfficiency varies with demographic density: Sparse villages may only suit bus, while dense city centres may overload even trams.\n\nPassengers attempt to travel to places important to them: Shopping centres, colleges and railway termini typically have greatest draw.\n\nJourneys presume interchange: Passenger journeys may switch from bus to tram to metro, and then vice versa. Consequently the more interconnected a network, the more passengers any one route will carry.\n\nThe most basic principle of efficient network design in Cities in Motion is “hub and spoke“: Use short bus routes to feed local tram routes, and then use those tram routes to feed cross-city metro routes. This keeps each mode operating efficiently, and critically maximises revenue, since passengers pay for each mode used separately.\n\nBeginner Tip: Any network that attempts to move passengers from door-to-door without interchange will tend not to generate sufficient revenue because each journey is only charged once. Cities in Motion invites the player to mimic common principles in continental European public transport network design, and does not respond well to anything else.\n\nBus routes should be used to achieve full local coverage of houses and minor employers, especially on the edge of cities. They should not be used to connect popular destinations together, and should not be used in the most densely built-up areas of cities. Trams should not be relied upon for cross-city travel.\n\nWhen designing the network, try to keep major interchanges within the radius of important destinations. This will tend to focus journeys to popular destinations on the modes most able to deal with larger volumes of passengers. Metro (to-tram) stations should ideally service shopping centres, colleges, hospitals, stadia, or large railway and airport termini. Tram-to-bus interchanges should try to identify local hubs, such as clusters of offices, or a local grocery store or cinema.\n\nBeginner Tip: When starting a new map, pause and get a sense for where the main interchange hubs should be. Conceptualise at least a future metro network to link those hubs, even if only a very small part of that network is initially constructed.\n\nAll that outlines the guiding principles of network design, not hard rules. For example:\n\nSuburban metro stations may inevitably have limited catchment areas which are best connected directly by bus.\n\nDensely built-up inner cities may need to be entirely served by trams, or even entirely by metros, simply to convey the volume of passengers without causing traffic gridlock.\n\nCities with wide boulevards and large squares may allow trams a greater range than those dominated by narrow streets.\n\nA well designed network will always trump policy (wage, fare, maintenance) micromanagement: Network design is by far the most important gameplay skill.\n\nDevelopment\n\nCities in Motion features no public transport competitors, and your reputation is based only on the services you actually provide, so there is no need to initially try and serve the entire city. It is entirely plausible to operate locally. However, without providing a network that invites interchange, revenue potential is low.\n\nSo the initial aim when developing a new city map should be a sufficiently large network to promote lucrative bus-tram-metro-tram-bus journeys. Such a network may be as simple as one pair of metro stations, with a couple of tram lines at either end, each linking to a couple of highly local bus routes. Initially focus on areas with high population density (look for tenements) and popular destinations (especially shopping centres, colleges and railway termini).\n\nBeginner Tip: Although metro-only routes can be profitable, especially if they link popular destinations in densely built-up cities, a more limited network that promotes interchange onto metro is generally even more profitable.\n\nThe initial cost of constructing such a network can be met by taking out loans. The network should generate far greater profit than the cost of the loan repayments. Use the profits to add further blocks to the network – a metro extension with corresponding tram and bus feeder routes.\n\nThe “hub and spoke” network design outlined above should ensure a reasonable balance of vehicles to route length, to keep wait times acceptable. Excessive queues at stops likely indicate insufficient capacity: Add extra vehicles to a line until the queues at its stops fall below the capacity of the vehicles on the route. Aim to stop the queues growing, not to keep every single passenger happy. A complete redesign of local services may be required if:\n\nMany extra vehicles are being added to manage queues at just one stop – try to find a better balance of destinations.\n\nVehicles start routinely queuing behind one another to enter a stop – split or partly duplicate the line.\n\nScenario objectives that involve building expensive metro lines need to balance the cost of any diversion against the reward. Prior awareness of upcoming objectives is (unfortunately) very helpful in strategic planning.\n\nHowever most scenario objectives can be treated as bonus “free” money: Objectives that require only a connection can be completed by building a bus stop at each location, adding a temporary bus route with a vehicle temporarily borrowed from another line, claiming the reward, then immediately moving the vehicle back to its original line and selling the new bus stops. Lines that also require passengers to be transported simply need to be maintained until the objective is met.\n\nBeginner Tip: Scenario objectives are potentially rewarding distractions to be managed. They are not tutorial guidance, and rarely suggest the most profitable routes.\n\nEngineering\n\nMetros can be constructed at 3 different levels below the surface, as indicated by the 1/2/3 icon that appears next to the construction toolbar. To have a metro track change level, build at the initial level, select the icon for the next level, then click on the built track and drag sufficient distance for a ramp to appear that changes level. Transitions to the surface require a similar dragging of track between level 1 and an underground-to-overground section (confusingly, underground-to-overground sections do not drop as low as level 1).\n\nDeeper metro tracks are slightly more expensive to construct. Shallow rivers can only be crossed by metro tracks at level 2 and 3. Deep rivers and seas require level 3. Otherwise different metro track depths allow lines to cross without conflict between trains. That is useful in densely trafficked networks, for example where more than one route through the city centre is required to provide sufficient capacity.\n\nEarly century trams are short, relatively slow, and may have little road traffic to deal with, so can appear to suit a similarly simple line design to buses. However later articulated trams are far longer and faster, so particularly benefit from long sections of traffic-free running with wide turning circles and station stops that have no junction conflicts on either side: Fluid tram stop design becomes far more important with later eras, to ensure articulated trams can get in and out of stations without delay, and thus make the most of their high top speeds between stops.\n\nTrams operate best when running out of road traffic:\n\nIdeally, build tram tracks across roads, rather than running tracks along roads. The construction of tram tracks, especially near complex road junctions, may require some trial and error to obtain the desired alignment.\n\nTake full advantage of boulevards to place tracks in between roads. Use green space where possible without compromising the overall length of the route too much. Parks may need clutter (lamp-posts or paths) to be removed first, especially when hilly.\n\nWhere no open space is available, watch prevailing road traffic levels and try to avoid the busiest roads. Double-carriageway roads may appear preferable to single-carriageway, but traffic conflicts with the tram can be just as intense. Remember trams can often continue along dead-end streets, which have little road traffic.\n\nPlan conflicts with bus routes and other tram routes. Traffic jams are easily self-inflicted, and in extreme cases trams can become gridlocked, forcing a reset (toggle the red/green operating flag).\n\nIt is possible that the redevelopment of civic squares or green space destroy your tram lines – and even whole metro stations whose entrance conflicts. Some visual warning is provided by the appearance of a construction site and crane, and the scrolling update text may refer to a “zoning conflict” on a coming date, but it can be hard to judge exactly where the future buildings will appear.\n\nVehicles and Staff\n\nThe appendix lists all vehicles in the base game.\n\nIn general, buy the most modern vehicles available, since these tend to be faster and have greater capacity: Both factors allow more passengers to be conveyed, but at much the same (wage, fuel and maintenance) cost as older vehicles, thus generate more profit – and remain more competitive with the private car. The advantages of unreliable vehicle designs need to be balanced by the need to set a higher maintenance spend. Longer vehicles (especially articulated trams and buses) occupy more roadspace, which can raise operational problems – but this issue implies engineering or network design changes, and is often unavoidable in later eras.\n\nEarly-game, profitable operation is often premised on partial maintenance – the default is 50% spend on the policy panel:\n\nFor stops, this is a largely cosmetic option for boosting reputation: Stops won’t breakdown mid-journey as a result of poor maintenance. Reputation is, however, generally easiest to boost by providing an effective transport service (where queue times are not excessive), rather than focusing on the quality of the shelters.\n\nFor vehicles, reliability declines with age. The rate of decline depends on the maintenance spend and the quality of the vehicle. Early maintenance savings will reduce the working life of the vehicle. Generally, keep vehicle maintenance low until profitability is obtained, then raise the maintenance percentage to keep operation reliable.\n\nWell paid drivers spend less time at stops, so operate more efficiently. Inspectors raise revenue from fines. Technicians improve reliability. Office workers add reputation. Each may be important in certain circumstances – efficiency, revenue, reliability and reputation respectively.\n\nAchievements\n\nAlmost all the game’s achievements can be “achieved” by creating and playing a custom map prepared in such a way as to make the achievement easy. LogOutGames provides some pre-created “cheat” maps. The only exceptions are the four city-name achievements – Amsterdam Aid, Bested Berlin, Helsinki Helper, and Veteran of Vienna – which require the entire European campaign to be played through, both accepting and completing all the respective city’s objectives in every scenario featuring the city.\n\nCaution: The campaign achievements are extremely miss-able because scenarios may offer the final (scenario-ending) objective before all other possible objectives have been offered. Accepting the completion of the final objective automatically ends the scenario, but it is possible to ignore the final objective by not pressing accept (just close any window instead) until you have been offered and completed all the other objectives. Achievement completionists will need to pay careful attention to the objectives listed in the scenario summaries below.\n\nThere are several achievements that are neither likely to be obtained in regular play, nor are easily contrived:\n\nA Complete Collection (all vehicles): Play a map for a century from 1940 (all vehicles from the 1920s are still available in 1940) until the mid-2000s, acquiring one of every vehicle along the way (Paradox forum discussion). The appendix lists all vehicles in the base game, but DLC vehicles may also contribute to the total, so you may not need everything listed there. Acquiring vehicles through the campaign scenarios may stall progress, possibly because the timeline shifts between eras (Steam forum discussion). If stalled, try closing the game, backing-up and deleting the “Cities In Motion” user folder, and then playing through a fresh sandbox map from 1940, saving progress to just one file.\n\nBottom Feeder (0% coverage): At the start of a new scenario simply destroy an important civic building, such a college.\n\nFor Miles and Miles! (10 kilometre route): Loop a route around a large map.\n\nFour Corners of the Earth (connect Berlin sites): Tempelhof (between the large airport terminal in the south-east and the neighbouring church), Alexanderplatz (large square opposite the north-east railway terminal), Schloss Charlottenburg (western town hall, just north of the hospital and department store – any bus stop must be on the northern side of the street to be in range) and Potsdamer Platz (just north of the central railway terminal, later replaced by an office complex). Narestel provides more detail.\n\nGot It Covered (100% coverage): Cover the tutorial map (the smallest), including tram stops at the exit roads from the map. AtomicDay provides a detailed guide.\n\nHonored Citizen (100% reputation): Some combination of no debt, good service, happy (well-paid) office staff, advertising campaigns, and scenario reputation rewards.\n\nOverly Optimized (1000 passengers using 5 or less vehicles): Try a single metro line, with a few stations serving densely populated areas of a city. Easiest in later eras, when vehicles tend to be larger.\n\nProgress toward Steam achievements is logged in the file state.gs, found in the user’s “Cities In Motion” folder, with each achievement awarded on Steam only when completed. Progress alone is not recorded by Steam.\n\n1. Berlin Foundations\n\nThe campaign starts with Berlin in 1920. Berlin is well suited to metro and tram, even in 1920. Buses are best kept out of the congested city centre. The strongest market is typically the east-west axis, from the the department store on Leipzinger, past the central (Potsdamer) and western railway terminals, up slightly north-west toward the department store and hospital on the western edge of the city. There are also very viable routes from the centre to the airport and up to the north-east. Avoid the south-west initially, which is sparsely populated.\n\nVery little network development is required to complete this scenario, although you will be back here later, so the underlying geography is worth learning. Take a loan and build a fragment of a metro line with appropriate local tram or bus feeders – preferably in the territory of the notable objectives listed below. The learning curve will be quite steep if this is your first map, but an understanding of proper network design and development (read above) will quickly turn around any rookie loss-making frustrations.\n\nNotable objectives:\n\nDot to Dot – connect the 3 existing (bus) lines. As with most of these “connection” objectives, add and momentarily operate a temporary bus route to gain the 3000 cash reward. Best temporary, since maintaining the link will overload any connection not made by metro, and likely also overload the 3 original bus lines (because they carry far more passengers once attached to the network).\n\nNew Tram Line – build a tram line connecting the college next to the 2 hospitals in the north, central (Potsdamer) railway terminal, and theatre next to the western railway terminal and amusement park. “To” means these places must be in the radius of a tram stop. Build the theatre station to serve the amusement park gates (for How Amusing! later). Route the theatre-railway axis slightly north through the fields to avoid traffic, with no intermediate stops until the route can be mirrored by a metro.\n\nMore Money – have 15,000 cash. Take a loan if needed, although such should then be invested, primarily into a metro (see The Great Invention).\n\nThe Great Invention – build a metro line from the college in the north-east (opposite the theatre) to the police station in the far south (just south-west of the airfield). The college is a reasonable destination for a metro, the police station less so. Initially focus your metro-building more towards the city centre, where passenger volumes will be high and the metro most profitable, then extend the metro line towards the places required.\n\nRaising Profile – reputation 80%. Some combination of no debt, good service, happy (well-paid) staff and advertising campaigns.\n\nModernize Now! – buy 10 stops and 4 vehicles (any kind).\n\nOne Last Thing (final) – transport 120 passengers and have 15,000 cash. Take a loan if needed.\n\nA Helping Hand – buy 3 bus/tram vehicles.\n\nEnd of the Line – connect bus/tram lines to both ends (college and police station) of the metro line. “Hub and spoke” feeders which you should already be providing around metro stations.\n\nOther connection objectives can usually be completed using temporary bus routes if desired and are not important strategically, so are simply listed: Boy Scouting, Far-Away Farm, How Amusing!, The Lord’s Flock, Hotel Hotline, Jamboree!, and Agricultural Aid.\n\nBeginner Tip: To establish a temporary route simply to meet the needs of an objective, build stops within range of the required places, connect them with a single point-to-point route, add a vehicle, open the line, advance time by a few seconds and claim the reward. Then recover the vehicle, delete the route, and demolish the stops. In some cases a certain number of passengers will first need to be transported, in which case add intermediate stops that allow interchange with the wider network.\n\n2. A Relic of the Golden Age\n\nAmsterdam in the 1950s is a far smaller city than Berlin, with canals forming gaps between lines of primarily residential buildings. The city is less naturally suited to metro, but its road bridges are prone to heavy congestion. The central island area contains many of the core destinations – railway terminal, department store and college. The hospital is in the east, the airport in the south-west.\n\nAmsterdam’s suburban canal islands contain few popular destinations and any metro network would need to serve several hubs on each canal island in order to avoid trams or buses crossing congested bridges. Any metro is thus likely to require many under-used stations, implying little profit. The scenario can however be completed without any metro because trams alone are sufficient for the volume of passengers, but traffic congestion will be hard to avoid:\n\nBuses can be used to operate feeder services within each canal island, but avoid crossing the busier bridges. Even if trams cross the canal bridges there are no good sites for tram stops, so connecting the canal islands together with trams tends to result in a lot of congestion delays. Waterbus lines offer some alternative options, but are expensive and need to be carefully focused on interchange hubs.\n\nThe final objective “Tending the Fleet” requires moderately high vehicle condition, so avoid buying vehicle designs with poor reliability.\n\nNotable objectives:\n\nCharity Begins at Home! – build a tram to the airport and raise tram ticket prices by 0.2 (on the policies tab of the headquarters panel).\n\nView the View – build 2 lines serving at least one waterbus terminal. More “hub and spoke”.\n\nCrowd Control – have a tram line between Koninklijk (central palace) and a (random?) apartment. This may mean crossing a bridge. If you don’t want the long term congestion, the tram line can be closed after completing the objective.\n\nTo Catch a Spy – close a bus line for 2 weeks. It didn’t even take that long.\n\nPreparing for the Worst – have 15,000 cash.\n\nTending the Fleet (final) – no vehicle with condition below 70 and transport 120 passengers. Increase vehicle maintenance funding and replace vehicle designs with poor reliability.\n\nOther connection objectives: Building Bus Lines, Waterway Wonders (waterbus), By Coincidence, Saving Electricity, New Housing (waterbus), Terminal Pickup, Vito’s Brush with the Police, and Office Assistant. Office Assistant can take a long time to complete, because 10 passengers need to be carried to a precise building – most passengers carried will go to nearby buildings.\n\n3. Modernizing Vienna\n\nVienna’s geography tends to separate residences in the west from workplaces to the east, implying a lot of transport demand, even though the city is smaller than Berlin. On the west side of the river, popular destinations tend to focus on the north and centre – one department store (in the centre), with one college and hospital (in the north). Three railway termini also provide sites for interchange hubs, with a large airport in the far south (just too far away for an initial connection).\n\nVienna’s wide boulevards and large squares are well suited to trams, so metro-feeder services within the most densely populated areas should focus on trams. The starting tram route is not necessarily optimal – a more direct, largely traffic-free north-south route through the centre is possible by destroying the monument on the north-west corner of the department store. While destroying whole buildings is both expensive and bad for the company’s reputation, small measures, such as removing statues, can add considerable efficiency to operations. The starting bus routes are too long and should be split or replaced by trams.\n\nThe scenario’s objectives direct you to build a north-south metro line, and the north half of this route is a reasonable first choice. Later add a line to the east, and be sure to at least feed passengers from the eastern office complex in via tram. Extending the metro to the airport is viable but not a priority. The area west of the centre is more sparsely populated and the lowest priority for metro building in this scenario.\n\nNotable objectives:\n\nGoing Undergound – build a metro line from Favoriten (just west of the southern railway terminal) to the college. The college site can also serve the hospital and potentially cinema, and should be the first of the two places linked by metro to the centre. Nothing at Favoriten deserves a metro station, but a station placed just north-west of the railway terminal will capture both the Favoriten objective and the terminal’s traffic, making such a metro station viable. In both places the profitability of the route depends on establishing appropriate feeder services, although practical options in the south are limited to a couple of residential buses and a loop of the factories to the south.\n\nStudy Hard! – 20% popularity with students. Prior links to the college help, as might advertising using media students read. However securing 20% almost certainly means first extending the geographic coverage of your network to cover more than 20% of Vienna’s population.\n\nEx Oriente Lux – build 4 luxury tram stops. Build atop existing stop sites to upgrade.\n\nTrammin’ – “build” a tram line exclusively for Espen 1 trams. Completes if any new tram line is operated only by Espen 1 trams. There is no need to build anything.\n\nMore Metro – build a new metro line and transport 40 passengers.\n\nInteresting Investment Opportunity – pay 1000 and get a 25% discount on all trams for 3 months. Completion appeared to involve buying a new tram.\n\nUnderground Craze – build a metro line to the amusement park (on the large eastern island). The target place is the fountain in the centre of the park. A metro station in the car park north of the gates will be sufficient, where bus/tram interchange is also possible.\n\nThe Breadwinner (final) – have 50,000 cash.\n\nTry the New Stern-Berger – own 3 Stern-Berger 1200 buses.\n\nOther connection objectives: The Chauffeur, Oiling it Up, Party City!, Man in the Moon?, More Movie Moving, The Sheik’s Darling, and Soviet Line. Party City can be time consuming to complete because the target apartment rarely generates passengers for the destination college.\n\n4. A City Divided\n\nBerlin returns, divided by a wall. Fragments of the metro network exist which can be built into the new. The wall blocks land surface connections between east and west, but does not block cross-border metro, waterbus or helicopter. The south-western half of Berlin has expanded since the earlier 1920s scenario, but the general layout of popular destination is similar. As before, the east-west axis, perhaps extended to the airport, is generally the strongest market to develop initially.\n\nWarning: The railway terminal at Potsdamer has been replaced by a building site that will eventually become an office complex. If you use this land, or any of the Potsdamer square, for transport infrastructure, that infrastructure may be destroyed once the building site turns into offices.\n\nThere is really only one objective, 50% coverage, giving you free reign to build a network across much of the city. Don’t be afraid to take out huge loans – invested correctly, Berlin will repay them rapidly. Cross-city travel will swamp anything except metro, and multiple metro lines should be planned through the centre to provide sufficient metro capacity. The presence of the wall caps the volume of city-centre road traffic somewhat, but buses should still be avoided in the centre, since they lack capacity. Multi-car trams need reasonable length turning circles and clearance around stations to avoid causing conflict.\n\nNotable objectives:\n\nWorking with the Split – 50% coverage. Coverage appears to be calculated based on population, making coverage easier to achieve by focusing on the most densely populated areas. An almost complete “hub and spoke” network can be gradually built. Alternatively, build a profitable core, then raise coverage to 50% with a series of local (non-connected, unprofitable) bus loops.\n\nRaising your Profile – 80 company reputation.\n\nTransport Triumphs! (final) – transport 1000 passengers.\n\nPrecious Cargo – no line stops at the (northern) airport terminal for 2 weeks. Temporarily delete any stop from any line serving the small airport terminal building.\n\nBiker Problems – remove (a specific) bus stop.\n\nSecret Message! – sell the oldest vehicle in your fleet. Sort the roster by age and sell the oldest you find.\n\nA Raise for the Office Workers – raise (your staff) office wage by 0.50.\n\nOther connection objectives: Open Air Festival, Artistic Vision, Art Transport, and Spread the Love.\n\n5. The Heiress of Helsinki\n\nHelsinki is characterised by narrow congested streets and a peninsula geography that leaves little space for off-street tram lines. Popular destinations are spread across the city: A college, railway terminal, department store and hospital in the south. A stadium, hospital/office complex and shopping centre in the north. And two airports on the northern edge. Helsinki’s population density is almost universally high, even in the modern satellite settlements in the northern suburbs, so the city is well suited to use public transport: The challenge is physically fitting public transport in to the city.\n\nAn extensive metro network is key to serving Helsinki, but the narrow streets limit the scope for “hub and spoke” feeders. Metro stations will need to be closer together than in previous cities. Limited interchange potential can easily inhibit profitability, although metro network can in themselves be profitable with sufficient density of population. Focus trams in those places where there is space available for them to operate relatively freely – both boulevards and quieter backstreets. 1990s trams are longer than those of previous eras, so ensure large turning circles are built, and try to keep stations away from busy junctions so traffic is not blocked every time a tram stops nearby.\n\nNotable objectives:\n\nMetro Madness – build a metro line between the small airport, city hall and department store. Note the small airport is in the north-east, not the large airport in the north. None of the existing metro stations serves the city hall or department store, so the objective suggests an entirely new metro line. The recommended route is an east-west axis through the centre at the lowest (level 3) depth, to avoid the existing metro lines and allow continuation across rivers and sea. After the city hall station (whose catchment logically includes the railway terminal and theatre), turn north and serve the eastern side of the peninsula. Serve the gates of the amusement park to complete the next objective (Metro Expansion). While the small airport is unlikely to be profitable, the southern half of the line should be busy enough.\n\nMetro Expansion – have a metro line to the amusement park gate (mid-east).\n\nDuppel Bus – buy 3 Stern-Berger Duppel buses and operate them on any line.\n\nCruise Upgrade – buy 2 Donau Caravel boats.\n\nPixie’s Wish – build a tram line.\n\nReputation Boost! – 70 company reputation.\n\nOther connection objectives: Mobile Moves, Go Cruising (waterbus), Common Casino, A Way Out, Janne’s Request, Boy That’s It!, Luxury Lines, Big and Shiny (final), and Hospital Helper.\n\n6. Vienna Goes Green\n\nVienna has expanded, especially to the west, but is otherwise familiar from our first visit. Plan for an extra metro line, and to accommodate longer articulated trams, but otherwise the city will play out much as before.\n\nThe scenario initially (mis-) guides you into shutting down the south-east metro line, but this should provide a prompt to redesign the southern section to serve the north, which generates more passenger traffic than the east. The helicopter routes are expensive (and largely redundant) so can be closed, but do not delete them until prompted by an objective.\n\nThe objective “The Green Prize” requires moderately high vehicle condition, so avoid buying vehicle designs with poor reliability. The objective “Upgrade the Tram Fleet” requires only Louis Enviro X trams, which cannot be purchased at the start, so consider delaying tram network expansion until this point: The counterpoint is that a more extensive network will also be more profitable, making new trams easier to fund.\n\nNotable objectives:\n\nMake Do Without the Metro – “demolish” metro line 1. This means delete metro line 1 from the lines panel. The track and stations do not need to be demolished. The vehicles can be saved in storage. Since metros are actually useful to Vienna, much of the track can then be reopened – perhaps on an alternative alignment north, by raising the height of the line from the south to pass above the east-west metro track.\n\nGive Up Airspace – “demolish” helicopter lines 1 and 2. As above, simply delete the lines from the lines panel. However, since helicopters are largely useless, the landing pads can be demolished (to save upkeep) and the vehicles sold.\n\nSwitch to Trams – build 2 tram lines.\n\nOn the Rail – buy 3 vehicles and build a line to the southern railway terminal.\n\nUpgrade the Tram Fleet – have only Louis Enviro X in your tram fleet, and have at least 3. Potentially expensive if your tram network has expanded across the city, but at least the old tram can be sold.\n\nThe Green Prize – no vehicle with condition below 70. Increase vehicle maintenance funding and replace vehicle designs with poor reliability.\n\nCater to the New Citizens – build a tram line to Vosendorf. The destination is very suburban, so unlikely to be profitable for trams. Consider building the shortest track route possible (a few track sections and a paid of stops), and then abandoning the line after completing the objective.\n\nAlternative Fuel – pay 3000 cash.\n\nShout it Out Loud (final) – launch an advertising campaign and transport 80 passengers.\n\nA New Home – sell 2 trams.\n\nOther connection objectives: A Forgotten Promise, Be Aware, The Campus Won’t Come to the Students, Awareness Appeased, Connecting the Lord’s Rooms, All Cesar’s Hotels, Salty Sea Air (waterbus), A Threat from Above, Sheperd’s Visit, and Power Down.\n\n7. Berlin Reunited\n\nLargely a repeat of Berlin Divided, but with no restriction surface links and ever greater demand on metro capacity. The initial metro fragments should be built into a profitable core east-west metro axis, with plenty of tram (and then bus) feeder routes. Plan for multiple metro lines through the centre. As previously, a core profitable network can be used to fund an unsustainable, but objective-matching, coverage. The final objective, to transport 3500 passengers, can be easily achieved with a network that only covers smaller part of Berlin.\n\nNotable objectives:\n\nCover Berlin – 60% coverage.\n\nTransport Tracking (final) – transport 3500 passengers.\n\nOther connection objectives: Office Lines, Vito’s Assistant, Customer Call, Pier Problem, Hassan’s New Offices, Soviet Tour, Artist in Need, and Home Run!\n\n8. High Living in Amsterdam\n\nAmsterdam returns for the 2000s. Expansion has added a few extra buildings on the periphery, including a larger airport and a stadium in the south-east. The construction site opposite the railway terminal will add further offices and a shopping centre.\n\nThis scenario will eventually require 70% coverage, which in practice means serving almost all the main areas of population and employment. The key to a smooth, efficient network is to avoid using the bridges over the canals: A deep metro can instead be used to provide the links between the canal islands, with 2 or 3 metro station hubs on each island. The roads along the islands are relatively traffic-free, and surprisingly well suited to modern trams. This makes trams ideal as feeders into each metro hub, just don’t build them along the radial roads emanating from the city centre. Buses may be used to feed passengers from the peripheral villages, where volumes are lower.\n\nUsing this strategy, the most profitable (and thus recommended first) metro line runs from the south-western airport to the centre (with stops on each island), then perhaps east to the office complex. Both airport and office complex can be fed with routes from the surrounding villages. A second metro line could run from the railway terminal in the north, through the city centre, and then south-east to the stadium (again with stops on each island). Feeder tram routes should cover the full length of each island, preferably on the outer (non-city) side, where road traffic tends to be less. The north-east can be served by tram direct from the railway terminal, since the roads on this axis are wider.\n\nNotable objectives:\n\nUpgrading the Fleet – have no vehicle older than a year. In short, sell or replace all 8 existing buses.\n\nPetronilla’s Line – build a bus line at least 6 kilometres long.\n\nThe White-Collar Way – 70 reputation with white collar workers. The biggest specifically white collar employment site is in the far east, just north of the hospital – serving this well should help. Once your white collar reputation is at least 50, launch advertising campaigns (especially newspaper and television) to raise it up to 70.\n\nSave all Living Things – remove 3 bus or tram stops.\n\nUpdating the Trams – add 3 stops to existing tram lines and establish coverage of 70%. Coverage is city-wide, using all modes, not just trams.\n\nA Mysterious Invention – build a tram line.\n\nNew Bus Available – have 3 Jubilee Compact buses.\n\nTourist Attraction – 90 company reputation (final).\n\nMissing Mister – no vehicles going to the harbor for a month. Just shut down all the lines serving the target, which will likely include anything serving the railway terminus.\n\nOther connection objectives: Luxurious Hotels, The Trouble with the Theatre, Show Off in the Harbor, The Spectacle, A Must Have, A Remote Hotel, Take a Chopper (helicopter), A Slow Bus Needed, Sail Away (waterbus), Hotel to Hotel, Do the Dada, and A Scientist in Need.\n\n9. Financial Crisis\n\nVienna again, but back to 1929. Less employment in the east, no railways terminals in the north or west, and an airport under construction: Fewer popular destinations, across a fundamentally smaller city. There’s still a solid north-south metro axis, from hospital/college to railway terminal, but the Vienna of 1929 clearly has less potential for profit than in later eras.\n\nThe starting network is a liability that demands immediate redesign: The busy east-west route relies on (slow, low capacity) buses – 10 vehicle on any route is a sure sign of problems. The only north-south tram route runs along the riverside, serving nowhere popular. The eastern factory link doesn’t serve any residences, so is all but useless. The replacement network should focus on two core metro lines – north-south and southwest-east through the centre – fed by trams, with bus feeders to the outer suburbs and villages. Concentrate initial construction in the most built-up areas of the city. In this period even relatively short metro lines can be attractive, because road transport speeds are so low.\n\nNotable objectives:\n\nMaking Money (final) – 2000 or more monthly profit for 3 months. Use loans carefully, since repayments are tangible and over-expansion can reach the limits of loan availability. But don’t be affraid to borrow to build a just-about profitable network, that will match the required (2000 per month) profitability once those loans have been repaid. Avoid buying anything for the final 3 months, to maintain the required profitability.\n\nFilm Crisis – remove 3 stops.\n\nToo High a Price – lower all ticket prices by 0.10. Be aware that maximum acceptable fares may decline a lot during the scenario.\n\nOther connection objectives: Work for the Unemployed, Church Connection, Far Farming, More Visitors to the Church, Werner’s Premiere, Connecting the Quarters, and Forest Line.\n\n10. Helsinki Olympic Games\n\nHelsinki of 1950 is much like the Helsinki that was previously played, just without the peripheral office complexes and the large airport. As in The Heiress of Helsinki, build an extensive metro system, with a dense network of local stations, since the streets are narrow and congested. Extensive here means 3 or 4 metro lines running roughly north-south, with plenty serving the busy central area around the railway terminal. Dense means almost all the continuously built-up areas of the city within range of a metro station.\n\nThe objective “Final Preparations” requires moderately high vehicle condition, so avoid buying vehicle designs with poor reliability.\n\nNotable objectives:\n\nMore Capacity! – build 2 lines and buy 3 new vehicles.\n\nThe Stadium – build a tram line to the stadium.\n\nFinal Preparations – buy 4 vehicles and have no vehicle with condition under 70.\n\nBritish Interest – remove 3 stops.\n\nBack to Normal – build 3 lines.\n\nGood Coverage – 70% coverage.\n\nMake Monitoring Easy – no lines going to [a building] near the railway terminal. Temporarily close any lines serving the target. (And then reopen them again after accepting the reward… I confess, these sort of objectives can seem quite pointless.)\n\nAdvertise! – launch an advertising campaign and transport 40 passengers.\n\nHaul in the Pensioners – 70 reputation with pensioners. With 70% coverage already, just advertise, like you probably just did.\n\nSecuring the Business (final) – have 15,000 cash.\n\nOther connection objectives: The Backbone of Helsinki, Casino on the Way, Soviet Interest, Pastime for the Visitors, More Air!, A Line to the Center, Top Secret, New Residential Area!, Game Craze, The Struggle, Lightbearers, and Farm Sized. Lightbearers and Farm Sized do not appear to count towards the achievement “Helsinki Helper”. Your mileage may vary.\n\n11. Part with Petrol\n\nVienna in crisis again, this the oil crisis of the 1970s. In practice this means working without buses.\n\nThe first objective requires all buses are sold. You can sell all the buses, then buy a few back, and then close down the lines again to meet the second objective, Rebuilding. But by this stage of the campaign you will understand that buses are not well suited to the urban area of Vienna, and the bus network should in fact be replaced with a mix of metro and tram. Selling everything, including the bus stops, will bring your treasury up to over 54 thousand, which, if necessary, can be matched with another 100-150 thousand in loans. Pause, build an extensive metro network in the built up area, supported by local tram feeders, and profit.\n\nNotable objectives:\n\nThe Buses Must Go – no buses in the fleet.\n\nRebuilding – no bus lines, and build 3 new lines.\n\nA New Gadget – pay 2000 cash.\n\nOne More Metro – build a metro line. No new track or stations need be built – one can simply add a new line between existing stations.\n\nOne Ring to Rule Them – have a tram line connect the college (north-west), theatre (opposite western railway terminal), library (south-east of the centre, by the river) and hotel (just east of the centre, by the river). Any long-term tram on this route would quickly overload, but a temporary tram line still requires track to be laid. Some of the cost of that track can be recovered be demolishing it after completing this objective.\n\nNew Metro Train Available! – have only Brighton Roller metro vehicles. A potentially expensive upgrade.\n\nPretty Please? – build a bus line.\n\nAdd some Lining – build 2 non-bus lines.\n\nWhat is it? It’s Great! – build a line.\n\nGetting to Know Them (final) – reputation of at least 90%. If in doubt, advertise.\n\nOther connection objectives: Paulie’s Plea, Rutger Needs Help, Going Camping, The Sheik’s Disgrace, and A Grain of Sand.\n\n12. The Fair City\n\nWelcome to contemporary Berlin, where once again you will be building a very profitable metro-centric network, and using those profits to meet an array of irrational scenario objectives.\n\nThe objective “Galaxies Galore!” will require a metro train fleet of only Galaxie Zoners. These train are relatively expensive to purchase, and their lower capacity is not entirely offset by their increased speed, so much of the metro system will function less efficiently.\n\nNotable objectives:\n\nHow Attractive! – be profitable 2 months in a row.\n\nGalaxies to the Airport – build a metro line to the small airport terminal in north-west and have only Galaxie Zoner trains on the line. The north-west airport is remote, with little nearby, so is one of the lowest priorities for a metro connection. This objective may be reasonably ignored until towards the end of the scenario. Any route should also include a stop at the larger terminal on the southern side of the runway.\n\nCenter Line – build a tram line connecting 3 specific hotels (western railway terminal, mid-south, and north-east of eastern railway terminal). Another invitation to lay an obscene amount of tram track across half of Berlin, to form a route that would be flooded with passengers were it to be operated long-term.\n\nFair Preparations – build 3 lines and buy 5 vehicles.\n\nOptimize! – build 2 lines.\n\nGalaxies Galore! – have only Galaxie Zoner trains in your metro fleet. As earlier, Galaxie Zoner lack capacity, so consider replacing them after meeting this objective.\n\nDraw More! – have a metro line to the library (far west, near the hospital and department store).\n\nA Green Magazine – pay 1000 cash.\n\nFeed the Line – have other lines bring passengers to 2 metro stops. Two different metro stops. Interchange must be very close to the metro station entrance.\n\nMore Money – pay 10,000 cash.\n\nToo Much to Handle! – lower all fares by 0.10.\n\nThe Blue-Plumed Pigeon – pay 2000 cash.\n\nBoost your Reputation (final) – company reputation of 90%.\n\nIn Need of a Pay Raise – raise all wages by 0.50.\n\nOther connection objectives: The Green Commune, A New Hotel, Hotel Hassle, The Very Important Persons (helicopter), Honey, I’m on Stage!, Ladies’ Line, A New Hamlet, A Poetry Reading, and The Hotel Line. The Hotel Line does not appear to count towards the achievement “Bested Berlin”.\n\nLearn More\n\nParadox Forums – archived discussion (login for full listing).\n\nCities in Motion WIKI – douglasrac’s FAQ.\n\nInstalling Mods for Cities in Motion – by Paul Williams.\n\nCities in Motion Shared Files – archive of modifications.\n\nAppendix: Vehicle List\n\nEvery vehicle in the base game, as posted by Two Clicks:"
