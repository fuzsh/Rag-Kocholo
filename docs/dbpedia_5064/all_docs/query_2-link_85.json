        "text": "Extensive research is being carried out in the in the area of electric vehicles. Different facets of the research being carried out are studied. In this paper the studies on various components of the electric vehicle are covered. The role of environment, the motor design and its control, the converter design and its control and the energy storage system technologies and strategies have been investigated. The switching topologies of converters used in EVS are presented from literature.\n\nThe ongoing spread of electric sustainable mobility is transforming the local ways of transport in metropolitan areas. This is meant to be extended outside of big cities in the near future thanks to new technological developments. Little towns should adapt to these changes, as they are located geographically far from the big cities and are generally characterized by low economic and demographic indicators. Hence, little towns must keep pace with these changes in mobility to avoid being isolated from the main cities in a country. People living in the countryside usually move toward big cities for various reasons, either related to work or living necessities. Therefore, it must be possible to conduct usual displacements through the use of electric vehicles (EVs), i.e., reaching the destinations and supplying the batteries through charging infrastructures. This paper studies the full implementation of electric mobility applied in the case of Cuenca, a city located in middle Spain. A br...\n\nAchieving green growth, that is, improving environmental, economic, and social well-being at the same time, is one of the global challenges society is currently facing. A sustainable mobility transition is an important element in shifting to a green growth path. This paper outlines an approach to analysing electric mobility in view of green growth that is grounded in Global Systems Science. It presents an initial synthetic information system developed for investigating the diffusion of electric vehicles in the global car fleet and sketches first simulation results."
