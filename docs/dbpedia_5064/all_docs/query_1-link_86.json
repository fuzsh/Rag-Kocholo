        "text": "Dear Reader,\n\nThis is my second article on Finland and the trains that are used there. In this article we will look at many topics such as opposition (why would anyone oppose new trains, new railways, etc.,), who the operators of the trains are both private and government, trips that can be taken with electrified train and plans for additional opportunities.\n\nWe also look at safety, railway links to adjacent countries, Metros, Trams, and Light Rail. It is my hope that by the time you have read both articles you will have a basic understanding of the trains being used in Finland. I value your opinion so please let me know if you enjoyed reading these articles. Many thanks in advance! With that I suspect we’d better get started.\n\nOpposition\n\nEnvironmental and cultural concerns affect these plans. The indigenous Sami people are concerned that the proposed line would pass through reindeer grazing. I suspect that they are good people who would like to see the trains arrive and be used but they want to ensure that it is done in a reasonable manner with the least impact to the society and wildlife of the areas where the train will operate."
