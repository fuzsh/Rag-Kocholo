        "text": "Hello,\n\nHusband and I are currently debating on whether or not to do a hoho tour of Helsinki or make our own using directions from Rick Steves for the 2/3 tram tour. I was wondering if anyone had done the 2/3 tram tour and could attest to how easy it is and how much time it actually takes. Basically is it worth it just to pay more for the convenience of the Ho Ho bus or not? TIA\n\nAs a local I am not able to reliably tell how easy it seems for a visitor, but I will comment on other aspects.\n\nThe route of the 2/3 is very different from the HOHO. The tram route is longer and takes you to parts of Helsinki the HOHO does not go to so you will be seeing more of \"regular city\" instead of just the typical tourist attractions. To compare here are\n\nHSL's 2/3 brochure with map: https://www.hsl.fi/sites/default/files/uploads/helsinki_sightseeing.pdf\n\nOne of the HOHO routes: http://www.redbuses.com/img/helsinki-map.jpg\n\nThe whole figure-8 onboard 2/3 would take just under one hour. The HOHO route is somewhat shorter. Trams run about every 10 minutes which is more frequent than the HOHOs that may have even 30 or 45 minute intervals. The cost of the day ticket for public transport is 8 euros and HOHOs are 25 euros.\n\nThe 2/3 runs by only the EPL berth whereas the HOHOs visit pretty much every port with a ship in port. However you can get to the 2/3 relatively easily from all berths by other public transport. Tram #9 from LMA berth, bus #14 from LHB and LHC, and tram #4/4T from Katajanokka berths. The longest walk required is from LMA to tram #9 which is nearly 600 meters.\n\nIt is available on line somewhere but please note that most of them are outdated as tram routes were renumbered/modified not many months ago.\n\nAt the transport desk at airport I saw 2/3 brochure and I am sure any tourist info office will have it but don't think you need that brochure upfront (especially given info above)\n\nIf money is not an issue or you have mobility issue or you are timid about public transport then HOHO might be of help otherwise for most people Helsinki's trams are extremely easy to use and very helpful\n\nSibelius monument (spelling?) involves taking a bus or 3 block walk from tram (on the other hand I regretted wasting my precious time going to it - would rather have gone atop atljee bar)\n\nFor all other places, tram 2 or 4 were ideal.\n\nWould strongly recommend going to island fortress though. And your tram day pass will cover the boat ride\n\nEdited June 2, 2014 by hal2008"
