        "text": "Finland: How did Helsinki make transit work in the suburbs? How can efficient suburban transit be achieved with limited metro lines and bus services? Helsinki (Finland) offers an inspiring example and George Liu went there to see it. By optimising bus routes and enhancing its single metro line, Helsinki has successfully created a reliable and cohesive transit system for its suburban areas. This approach highlights the importance of strategic planning and resourceful use of existing infrastructure. Join us in this UMX video as we explore the transformative impact of Helsinki's transit solutions on suburban mobility. Comments: @paulorocky 2 days ago As an Australian, I wish I could pin this to every State and Commonwealth infrastructure agency. But they’ll ignore it as always. @andrijapfc 2 days ago Isn't this...obvious? Toronto has been running transit in this way for decades. Almost every subway station outside of the wider downtown area is a large bus terminus.\n\n🚀 Exciting News! The Urban Road Safety Index 2023 is LIVE! 📊🚗🚲 We've just launched our Urban Road Safety Index, and it's packed with captivating insights. The report explores mobility trends and traffic safety in 25 European cities, and the findings are eye-opening. On top of the list 🥇 is Tallinn, congratulations City of Tallinn! In Istanbul, on the bottom of the list, 73% of respondents have traffic safety concerns. Amsterdam's perception of traffic safety dropped from 72% to 59% in just one year. But that's not all: - In London, 60% of respondents support banning electric mobility (bikes and scooters). - 74% of Rome citizens don’t think authorities do enough when it comes to road safety in their city. - 75% of residents in Helsinki feel there are more accidents in their city since the arrival of ‘electric mobility’. - In Stockholm, 89% of its residents think it would be a good idea to ban alcohol in traffic. - In Antwerp, 53% of residents will cycle less than before due to a possible helmet requirement. Interesting insights to improve traffic safety. Let's work on this together! Curious about all the results?

In comparison, Bilbao in Spain, which has a similar population to Dublin, has a travel time of 13 minutes and 40 seconds for journeys of the same distance! It is MPI’s vision that Ireland develops as a global leader in shared sustainable mobility by placing the needs of transport users at the heart of transport policy, enabling innovation, promoting public health, and supporting climate action. 🌎 Shared mobility can help make Dublin a more sustainable and congestion-free urban environment. 🌟 Enterprise Mobility I GoCar Ireland I Yuko Toyota Car Club I Bleeper I MOBY I Aircoach I Payzone Ireland I FREENOW\n\n#sustainable #urban #transit 🎉 Good news: City of #Prague comes 1st in the world as for #accessibility of #frequent #transit 🚊 🚋 🚃 89% of people in The Prague area live within 500m of a transport stop where a bus or train comes every 10 minutes or sooner. 💡 9 key indicators of #sustainable #urban #mobility are measured in 1000+ cities across the world by Institute for Transportation and Development Policy 👏 #Prague also does very well in a number of people living near car-free spaces (ranks 5th) and accessibility of high-capacity public transport within 1km (ranks 28th). 👍 Decent access to healthcare + education services (ranks 42nd) and bikeways + public transport (ranks 46th). 👎 Not so great when it comes to people / pedestrians safe from highways (ranks 574th). 📈 And – many relevant #indicators and #externalities not covered in areas of #cartraffic #emissions #parking #publicspace #safety.

The density of public transit stations, extensiveness of transport networks and the quality of roads were also taken into account. 🚶One primary focus of the study was to debunk the myth that a city’s transportation landscape is permanent. Cities that consistently invest in transformation have become more efficient and increased their residents’ ease of movement and quality of life. 🔗Read more here: https://lnkd.in/eFn9Fx_Z #AmsterdamRanking #Mobility #UrbanMovement\n\n🚎 Regensburg Votes \"No\" to Light Rail: A Missed Opportunity for Sustainable Mobility? On Sunday, Regensburg residents voted against the city's proposed light rail system, a move that surprised many. For those unfamiliar, Regensburg is a beautiful Bavarian city on the Danube River, with a population of around 150,000, known for its medieval city center, innovative companies, and warm-hearted people. As a relatively new resident since 2017, coming from Brussels, I quickly became aware of the city's concern about traffic congestion, pollution, and the perceived dominance of cars. Despite already having a good public transport system, including electric buses, car/bike/scooter sharing, and a car-free city center, Regensburg's ambition to further improve sustainable and inclusive mobility led to the idea and intensive preparations of the implementation of a tram network. Although their was a negative vote, I come nevertheless to some very positive conclusions: 👫 Citizen engagement is crucial: The city's decision to involve its residents in this important decision was commendable. Citizen's engagement in the transformation of mobility in cities is not an option, but necessary. 👉 The pursuit of sustainable mobility should not stop: Regensburg should continue to explore and implement innovative solutions for hopefully even more sustainable and inclusive transport. 💡Embrace emerging technologies: The rapid advancements in digitalization, electrification, and automation of transport offer exciting new opportunities for the city to leverage. I want to encourage cities to further strengthen their engagement in understanding and pushing for the development and deployment of most suitable mobility solutions. The future of mobility will be strongly shaped by cities! While the outcome of the vote might be disappointing for quite a few people involved, I would like to open the view that Regensburg is already today very advanced in the implementation of sustainable and citizen-centric mobility 💪 and that such decisions present always a chance for cities to reassess and explore alternative paths towards maybe even more sustainable and inclusive mobility 👍 . Do you agree? What are your views? #Regensburg #SustainableMobility #PublicTransport #UrbanPlanning #Innovation"
