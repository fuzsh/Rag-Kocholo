        "text": "Electric rail, which accounts for over 85% of passenger rail activity and 55% of freight movements, does not emit any direct CO2 emissions. Urban rail networks such as metro and light rail tend to have significantly lower emissions than other motorised urban transport modes, especially private cars, as they are powered by electricity, have lower friction losses, and exploit high occupancy rates. On a well-to-wheels basis, rail emissions per passenger kilometre average around one-fifth of those of air travel. Emissions from electrified passenger rail are even lower when powered by renewables or nuclear power. In general, rail transports around 7% of global passenger-km and 6% of tonne-km but accounts for only around 1% of transport emissions.\n\nExpanding rail networks and their use will be important for achieving emission reductions to get on track with the NZE Scenario. European players are planning important investments in rail transport to make it more appealing to travellers, especially as an alternative to short-haul flights.\n\nThe overall final energy mix of rail is currently split between diesel and electricity, with diesel consumption being 53% of total final energy demand compared to 45% of electricity share in 2022 (and biodiesel accounting for the remaining 1%). By 2030 in the NZE Scenario, electricity makes up 60% of total energy demand, with diesel still accounting for over a third, and biodiesel for most of the remaining share, with very minimal penetration of hydrogen.\n\nDiesel, in particular, plays a much more prominent role in freight rail, accounting for 75% of its total energy consumption worldwide in 2022. Continuous progress on freight electrification sees this share dropping to around 55% by 2030 in the NZE Scenario.\n\nRail is also being more frequently explored as a solution that can provide synergies across the transport and energy sectors, which can bring numerous benefits, especially in developing economies:\n\nenergy access – bringing clean energy access to wider geographies through rail network projects\n\nenergy security - using rail infrastructure to regulate electricity demand and manage energy storage\n\nsustainability – using electric rail as a baseload demand guarantee to support the business case for renewable energy investments. Additionally, if the area is particularly suitable for clean energy generation, this can make the case for electrification of the rail infrastructure bringing green financing to the transport sector.\n\nThe world’s operating metro systems cover more than 21 000 km. Over one-third of these were put into operation between 2017 and 2021, and 80% of these new metro lines were built in Chinese cities. The picture for light rail, which has lower capacities and speeds, is similar, if less stark: over 10% of operating lines were put in place in the same five years, with just under half of them in China. The resulting efficiency of urban mobility in China results in far lower per-capita transport emissions than in cities of the developed world that are not served by metro, and can help China realise its net zero CO2 emission commitments.\n\nMore than 20 countries have developed high-speed rail networks, totalling almost 60 000 km of line. China already has about 70% of the world’s line length and has long-term plans to operate nearly 65 000 km. Morocco has had great success with high-speed rail, opening the first high-speed rail system in Africa in 2018, and – in 2022 – starting to power its high-speed trains with renewable energy. Under the NZE Scenario, activity levels in high-speed rail need to increase by 75% in 2030.\n\nNight rail services offer additional traffic at a lower marginal cost, making infrastructure investments more profitable. Renewed interest has led to an expansion of night rail connections, demonstrating that this form of travel is gaining appeal and becoming a valid competitor with aviation for short- and medium-distance trips. Europe has seen the opening of several new night lines over the past couple of years, including overnight trains between Paris and Vienna, Amsterdam and Zurich, and Brussels and Prague, each with a number of intermediate stops. Night trains have continued to be an established practice after the Covid-19 pandemic in Eastern Europe, Asia and to a lesser degree in North America.\n\nDemonstration projects in the Netherlands, Canada and Japan aim to test the viability of hydrogen as an alternative to diesel rail lines with low utilisation and as a low-carbon fuel for rail in certain operations, including for conventional (intercity) passenger rail and for freight rail.\n\nProponents of fuel cell trains point to their potential to run over long ranges (up to 1 000 km at a maximum speed of 140 km/h) without refuelling, noting that fuel cell trains do not require spending on catenary lines, making them more competitive with the electrification option when it comes to long-distance low-utilisation routes. They also highlight the potential for quick refuelling times.\n\nIn 2022, Germany started operating 14 hydrogen trains to serve passenger transit over a 100 km track in the state of Lower Saxony, part of a larger order from train manufacturer Alstom totalling 41 trains. In 2023, France ordered 12 hydrogen trains that will soon start test-runs, while the Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport assigned EUR 300 million for the purchase of hydrogen-powered rolling stock and the production, storage and supply of renewable hydrogen.\n\nHydrogen projects have often been clustered in advanced economies, which have more financial resources at their disposal to invest in innovative technologies. This past year has seen some emerging and developing economies also investing in hydrogen rail projects, notably India’s 89 km long Sonipat-Jind route, where test-runs are expected to start in December 2023.\n\nIn March 2022, the Japanese JR East has started test runs of the hydrogen-hybrid train HYBARI, which is powered by hydrogen fuel cells and batteries. It is the first heavy train to use high-pressure hydrogen (70 MPa) which increases maximum distance capacity. Spain's CAF, on the other hand, has started dynamic track testing of its own hydrogen fuel cell and battery-powered hybrid train. In Chile, the mining railway Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia will introduce hydrogen trains in 2024.\n\nClean Tech Guide: Transport, Rail, Biofuels, Refining, Hydrogen. Cross-cutting themes: Direct electrification.\n\nFollowing the EU announcement of financial support for the commercialisation of the hyperloop technology, pioneering companies launched the \"Hyperloop Association\" in December 2022, and a hyperloop testing facility is being set up in Groningen.\n\nThe EU is also funding the development of Railway to Grid management systems via the E-LOBSTER project. The platform could provide a real-time energy flow management between rail, the electricity grid, energy storage and electric vehicle charging station systems, utilising the train's regenerative braking and reducing the grid's distribution losses. A testing tool has been successfully implemented in Madrid, and the innovation was demonstrated and validated at the University of Newcastle.\n\nStadler, Utah State University and ASPIRE Engineering Research Center are developing a fully battery electric train, the FLIRT Akku, and have already sold over 110 units and replaced diesel fleets in some places in Germany. The co-operation aims to redesign this train to meet market requirements in the United States.\n\nChina's first domestic magnetic levitation (maglev) line began testing in March 2023. The line will be 38 km long with a first phase of 8 km to open in late 2023."
