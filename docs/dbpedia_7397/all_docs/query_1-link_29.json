In this book all the contributors recognise the artists’ passion and talent, and their unrelenting devotion to developing a platform for animation from the Middle East. We are grateful, above all, to the filmmakers. They make a powerful impact on an under-appreciated field inhabited by inspired and inspiring people. I would like to thank the Film Studies editors at I.B.Tauris, Anna Coatman and Madeleine Hamey-Thomas, who have been encouraging in their dedication to the volume and in opening up avenues for its publication. I am very grateful to Cristina Johnston for the translation of the French language chapter on Tunisia. I also received tremendous help from two copy editors who really assisted in bringing the project to fruition. Without Stephen Blackey and Richie McCaffery this book would simply not be as good as it is. The limited opportunities for exposure of Middle Eastern animated films and the dispersed nature of the network of people working in the field ensured a wide diversity of contributors. I thank the authors of the chapters in this volume: Maya Ben Ayed, Paula Callus, Yael Friedman, Lina Ghaibeh, Mohamed Ghazala, Maryam Ghorbankarimi, Colleen Jankovic, George Khoury (Jad), Nisrine Mansour, Omar Sayfo, Amber Shields and Başak Ürkmez, for having come on board at different stages of the project, and delivering materials of such excellent quality. The limited availability of scholarship on animation from the Middle East has also made me explore sources from the Middle East in languages in which I am not fluent. I thank Ana Grgič and Sara Aguzzoni for helping me with the Italian writing on African animation, Öznur Karaça for\n\nix\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd ix\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:14 PM\n\nx\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nassistance with Turkish language sources and Silke Goijens and Helge Daniëls for help with some Arabic materials. Other colleagues I am grateful to are Samia Chelbi, Florence Martin, Will Higbee, Guy Austin, Inès Jerray, Richard Neupert and Sébastien Denis for opening up their network of scholars of Tunisian cinema; Michael Marten, the members of the Middle East Caucus at SCMS, Dia’ Azzeh and Amer Shomali for helping me find someone to write about animation in Palestine; Ann Davies for advice and guidance on being the editor of such a culturally diverse volume; and Nichola Dobson of the Society for Animation Studies and Malikka Bouaissa at al.arte magazine for letting me try out some of my initial ideas in their online publications. Lastly, I want to thank family and friends for listening to me enthuse endlessly about animation, and allowing me to test arguments and analyses on them: Marjan Weyn and Dirk Van de Peer, Valerie Van de Peer and Geert Van Dosselaer, Emilie Van de Peer and Jan Peynsaert, Leen Maes and Lore Van Acker, Öznur Karaça, Ana Grgič, Kholoud Baher Hussein, Michael Marten, Helge Daniëls and Richie McCaffery – always my main source of inspiration.\n\nx\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd x\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:14 PM\n\nxi\n\nContributors MAYA BEN AYED received her PhD from the Institut de Recherches et d’Etudes du Monde Arabe et Musulman (IREMAM) at the Université de Provence and at the University of Tunis.

Many of the films mentioned in this volume have original film titles in Arabic, French, Farsi or Turkish and even Japanese. Where possible, we provide the original title of the film first. However, not all films have titles that have been translated, and some have been made available with English titles only, with an eye on a large transnational audience. Where this is the case, we have used the most common translations and transliterations of the titles in question. If the films do not have an English title, we use the most common transliteration, or the French given title, and translate this into English. Where possible, we have included links to the online version of the films, in order to make the films as widely accessible as possible.\n\nNames Given names, transliterated from Arabic, Turkish, Farsi and Hebrew into English (or the Roman alphabet), often use el/El or al/Al, sometimes with a hyphen. As there are no firm rules on how the transliteration is to be rendered, for the sake of consistency, we have opted for capitalisation, with the hyphen.\n\nLanguage One of the chapters in this volume was originally written in French. This piece has been translated, as indicated. xv\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd xv\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\nxvi\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd xvi\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n1\n\nIntroduction: Modelling Local Content for Animation in the Middle East Stefanie Van de Peer\n\nAnimated films from the Middle East and North Africa hardly ever make it into cinemas in the US or Europe, or onto the film festivals circuit, let alone into academic studies of the art form.1 This is despite the West’s continued gaze onto the area since 9/11 and the Arab Revolutions, which have no doubt increased the visibility of Middle Eastern media and cinema globally. Nevertheless, animation is an enormously popular art form that is widely practiced and exhibited in the Middle East. Animation is not only popular with local audiences, it is also a form through which artists could arguably attain on the one hand a more complex transnational Middle Eastern identity, and on the other hand a more expressive entrepreneurial outlook. With the rise of regional interests in the production, distribution and exhibition of local creative material, the fast developments in animation embody and reflect the cinema of the region’s growing confidence and substance on a global scale. This volume therefore aims to reveal the significance of animators in Middle Eastern and North African film culture, while rooting the contemporary developments firmly in a local interpretation of, and experimentation with, the art form. Firstly, though, some engagement with the geographical scope of this volume is required. The Middle East and North Africa are vast regions, and in this volume they are dealt with in their largest possible interpretation: we have not limited ourselves to the Arab world. As the title suggests, 1\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 1\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n2\n\nAnimation in the Middle East\n\nit includes the westernmost country in North Africa’s Maghreb, Morocco, as well as Iraq, the easternmost Arab country. In between, we discuss nonArab countries such as Iran and Turkey. Likewise, and perhaps controversially, a chapter on Israel is included, not only because of the significance of Vals Im Bashir (Waltz with Bashir, Ari Folman, 2008), but also because animators there deal with territorial issues in parallel to how Palestinians animate their struggle for return and self-rule. I also fully acknowledge the problematic terminology of ‘Arab’, ‘Middle East’ and MENA (‘Middle East and North Africa’): it remains necessary to diversify our understanding of the region and its cohesive nature through history, culture, language and religion.2 This volume’s geographical and political scope makes it transnational in its editorial approach – both artistic and academic – and offers the reader the opportunity to read chapters in relation to one another, as animators travel, co-produce, subcontract locally and regionally, exile themselves, and export their work throughout the region.\n\nBeyond the Dichotomies Instead of positing West versus East in a discourse that draws attention to the origins of cinema and animation in the West, and the East’s insecurities regarding figurative arts, it is perhaps more useful to follow Laura Marks’ stance on the infinite enfoldment of art and its influences, in both directions, from East to West and West to East. At the same time, the late arrival of animation in the Middle East, and the complex context within which it now blooms, need to be acknowledged. In some countries in the Middle East where Islamic law rules, the relationship between film and religion has been complex. Precisely because of its animated nature, animated film takes man as the creator a step further. While the basic form and aim of animation, of lending the illusion of movement and a soul to a drawn body for its supposed young audience, is arguably why it has not always been appreciated in the East, in areas in the Middle East this under-appreciation has been ascribed to its allegedly un-Islamic nature. As Islam declares that Allah is the only image-maker, the only creative and shaping being, for centuries Islamic artists faced insecurities about representational arts.3 In Enfoldment and Infinity (2010) Marks explores in detail how patterns of ancient Islamic art enfold digital media art infinitely. She constructs 2\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 2\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n3\n\nIntroduction\n\nan Islamic archaeology of new media, and refuses to indulge in the dialectic between East and West, between Islamic and digital media, and between religious and secular art. She demonstrates the historical continuities between the ancient and the modern, as digital concepts such as algorithms, pixels and virtual reality are actually rooted in centuries-old Islamic art.4 Both Arab artists and the Islamic body of thought have acutely influenced European and Western culture. Marks shows how one of the most popular non-figurative Islamic arts – calligraphy – in many respects is itself animated: its written words or single letters encapsulate life and movement in their fluidity. Calligraphic artworks, while they do not depict living forms, do embody the movement of life itself. ‘Watching calligraphic animation, we feel empathy with the letters as they swoop free of their symbolic constraints and become animated, take on (non-organic) life.’5 This is illustrated by the Turkish film Amentü Gemisi Nasıl Yürüdü (How the Ship of Creed Sailed) by Tonguç Yaşar (1960s).6 The animated calligraphy film shows how the letters of the titlepoem are inherently animated: that movement is present in the aesthetics and the meaning of the letters. Calligraphy here reveals the movement and performance in poetry, but also in meaning, and as such it brings Islamic and secular art together. Marks further argues that, in the way calligraphy indexes the hand that created it, so too does ‘computer-based animation [index] the software and hardware on which it was produced.’7 Where the understanding of calligraphy as a performative and animated art may be significant for the more traditional forms of animation in the Middle East, ideas on Islamic art and enfolding pixels are noteworthy for animation as a digital art in the contemporary area. In this view, objects have inherent meaning, the way meaning is there behind the surface of the animated image, in the code. Objects and images as well as their meaning need to be unfolded, just as digital code can be decoded as non-figurative art. The idea of a performative code parallels Marks’ insight into performative calligraphy in modern digital animation. In some countries existing under dictatorships (Libya), with a rigorous censorship board (Saudi Arabia), or subject to constant political tensions (Algeria), there is no infrastructure for film, and cinemas are being closed down. Nevertheless, films are being made either clandestinely, slowly or in exile, and historically have had an enormous impact on the national 3\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 3\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n4\n\nAnimation in the Middle East\n\nidentity formation of these countries. We can therefore not reduce film and its presence or absence in the Middle East to simple dichotomies. Before the Revolutions, enfolded meaning remained hidden from censors, only to be unfolded and appreciated by those who purposefully sought it out: a secret dialogue in plain sight between the art and the viewer.8 Enfoldment can thus be employed as a tool of political subversion, and as we see in chapters on Syria and Libya in this volume, a secret dialogue in plain sight is exactly what has taken place historically and continues to do so (though not so secret any more) with intensifying vigour. Animation is increasingly a digital art form, certainly so since 2011, when the Revolutions in several Arab countries forced animators with revolutionary propensities onto the global online network, posting their films online in an expression of collective political and artistic dissent. While the Revolutions started in response to repressive regimes, Arab media now have perhaps the most nuanced views of, or influence on, artists’ expressive empowerment. As Marks shows, ‘many artists are bringing Islamic textual aesthetics to contemporary media art, and are thus enriching this art’s qualities of latency, performativity, and transformation.’9 Perhaps this also works in the opposite direction: artists are equally bringing contemporary media art to conservative aesthetics and are again broadening horizons and enriching more traditional views of what art can and cannot do. The central thought here is the ‘performance’ of the tools, where pens as well as computers enable movement, and the index performs a transformative function. In animation, whether this is conservative or modern-liberal, as in all art forms, the popular and the artistic go hand in hand, and approach one another constantly. Likewise, artists and entrepreneurs collaborate, and aspects of both roles are present in one person simultaneously or over a period of time. Trends and developments in the art form change, and ensure that artists become entrepreneurs or move back to their more artistic side. Often, auteurs need to be entrepreneurs to make their art form a financially viable one. Entrepreneurs have turned into auteurs as they experience the revolutions (both digital and political) and liberate themselves from dominant morals and financial restrictions. More and more, on politically interactive and revolutionary platforms, artists as well as entrepreneurs have to consider their audiences and use art in a quest for a wider meaning. To achieve this, it becomes increasingly apparent in films, networks of artists and at 4\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 4\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n5\n\nIntroduction\n\nfestivals, that the basic search is for a common language in film: an Arab identity that can inspire a local audience and lead to a confident, more sustainable industry. All chapters in this volume engage with the quest for identity in and through animation, for a regionally inspired and produced body of work, whether this is entrepreneurial or artistic. The Digital Age has made space for a young population in the Middle East and with this comes an increased spirit of entrepreneurship. Animation is now pervasive in commercial advertising, games, social networking and television, as well as artistic circles, where experimentation with the digital sometimes takes us back to ancient patterns. The computer and the possibilities offered by digital media have dramatically changed the relative neglect of animation and has ushered in a renewed interest in and favoured attention for animation and related techniques and practices in the cinema.10 Critically, the impact of these technologies is felt through experimental practices, but also in the possibilities and economies these offer in production, dissemination and distribution to countries in the Middle East. We are looking, then, at the exchanges between the artistic and entrepreneurial impulses in Middle Eastern animation, in the artists’ search for a common transnational animated identity.\n\nThe Scope of the Volume This volume seeks to establish a multifaceted media-archaeology and a new history of animation in the Middle East and North Africa. Current film scholarship about the region and its cinema is dominated by Arab, Iranian or Turkish cinephile cinema that has been accessible in the West, at film festivals or in art house cinemas. Here, we take a more integrated look at the animation of the region. Both academics and artists, hailing from the Middle East and North Africa as well as from Europe and the US, have contributed to this volume, a spread in identities indicative of the transnational approach we take. With the rise of animation’s popularity globally, its speedy development as edutainment, its current ubiquity and financial viability through advertising, its increasing political importance since the Revolutions and its slow recognition as a serious art form, scholarly interest in the history of the form in this region is also gaining momentum.11 5\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 5\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n6\n\nAnimation in the Middle East\n\nAs Egyptian cinema blossomed earlier and more confidently than other countries in the region, animation also first took shape here, in Alexandria, in the large and rich expat communities. From Alexandria in the 1930s to Ramallah and Damascus in the 2000s, animation has undergone periods of intense popularity and neglect, as well as spurts of distinctive innovations and applications. Looking at the popularity of the early Egyptian animations by the Frenkel Brothers in the 1930s and 1940s and the Moheeb Brothers in the 1950s; the parallel development of commercial animation in advertising studios and more experimental films in the 1960s in Turkey; the increasing popularity of television animation in the 1970s in Lebanon; the creation of feature length animations in Israel in the 1980s; the countless experimental Moroccan short animations of the 1990s; the astounding worldwide success of Persepolis and Waltz with Bashir in the 2000s; as well as the application of animation as a standin for the lost archive in Palestinian cinema in the 2010s and the animated response to the Arab Revolutions – animation has a much longer and intricate history than imagined. Chapters in this volume each provide an overview of a specific country’s animation developments, taking into account cinematic and political circumstances and their influence on production, distribution and exhibition, while the volume as a whole establishes transnational links and overlaps between countries in the region. The enormous success of Persepolis (Iran, 2007) and Waltz with Bashir (Israel, 2008) in the 2000s opened up an avenue into the history of animation in the Middle East, beyond the countries that are commonly associated with high production values such as Iran, Israel and Turkey. While these countries’ amazing strides in animated cinema are explored and their influence on the region’s work acknowledged, the Arab contingency of the Middle East and its animation’s exponential rise in production and significance in world cinema needs to be addressed. Animation is a form that has never been absent from the region and one wonders exactly why the form travels less well than cinephile and festival films. Excluded from critical accounts, but often widely available on online platforms such as YouTube and Vimeo or the artists’ websites, animation in the Middle East needs to be assessed beyond the big budget, high production value non-Arab films that have entered the Western consciousness. 6\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 6\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n7\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs Paul Wells shows, ‘animation emerged in a range of developmental and experimental techniques, [each] new form suggesting another “modernity”, aesthetically and socio-culturally progressive’. He asserts that ‘virtually all forms of animation have been predicated on experimentation in one form or another and certainly have been in the continual embrace of technological progress.’12 Perhaps for the Middle East it is more nuanced in that, as emerges from these chapters, animation often grew out of either an interest in cartoons or a love of Western or Asian popular animation, and due to a lack of funds and infrastructure, training took place in commercial and/or transnational circumstances. Learning the trade abroad, in an academic context or in more commercial circumstances, are the most obvious journeys for young Middle Eastern artists. As there have been few or no schools teaching animation in the Middle East, artists and entrepreneurs learned their craft in commercial studios and advertising agencies, abroad or locally. Of course there are those who develop their style through experimentation and video art, but that is mostly the case where there are schools, or where they are already established as producers of commercial and advertising materials. This is changing rapidly though, as universities with departments in animation and other digital arts are springing up. Lebanon for example is one of the forerunners in this respect, with a proportionally large number of training and education opportunities for young artists, and even Saudi Arabia has recently designed its first course in animation, at Effat University in Jeddah.13 With the positioning of the Gulf as the source of most funding opportunities and production money as well as being the nexus of distribution and exhibition of animated (and other) films in the Middle East, entrepreneurial trends in animation reveal three strands here: advertising, TV serialised edutainment and children’s films. Perhaps the increasing need for local education, and the recent establishment of the animation courses in Jeddah, will inject Gulf animation with new, artistic tendencies. Certainly, the outsourcing of labour on children’s serials and TV animation from the Gulf to Turkey, Syria and Lebanon has meant a level of regional transnationalism that has fed into the animated series and their potentially more wide-reaching audiences, but the local training opportunities and platforms springing up in the previously quasi-closed-off Gulf 7\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 7\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n8\n\nAnimation in the Middle East\n\nregion will undoubtedly contribute to a local flavour, emancipation and self-confidence for artists and entrepreneurs alike. The most persistent need the artists (both commercial and intellectual) identify in the region is for a confident local or regional identity in animation. From the first animators, the Frenkel Brothers from Egypt, improving their hero Mish Mish to become more relevant for large Arab audiences, over Turkish Tonguç Yaşar’s How the Ship of Creed Sailed and its Ottoman calligraphy contributing to the aesthetic development of Turkish animation, to Lebanese animators’ preoccupation with finding a local voice, the search for local style and form is ubiquitous. Perhaps then the overlaps between commercial and artistic animation reveal the need to strike new balances. Artists and entrepreneurs come together more productively in order to find an equilibrium, firstly, between developing local content versus outsourcing the labour globally and regionally; secondly between dealing with the high costs of setting up local infrastructure versus the continuing dominance of Western stories on Middle Eastern screens; and thirdly between Western stories being executive produced in the Middle East versus Middle Eastern stories being produced in the West. As Chris Newbould shows, for example, the recent Postman Pat film – a quintessentially English story – was produced by Jordanian animation development and production company Rubicon Group Holding (RGH) Entertainment,14 while Islamic stories like Muhammad: The Last Prophet are produced by American Rich Animation Studios/RichCrest, and Disney films like Aladdin clearly remain influenced by Middle Eastern stories. While this touches on the potential of transnational work in the animated world, all three cited films show problematic representations of the characters. In The World History of Animation, Steven Cavalier states that some of the origins of animation can be traced back to the Middle East, specifically ancient Egypt and Iran. He shows how some of the most popular Western animated films have been rooted in Middle Eastern stories and aesthetics. Orientalist usages of Arab folklore and stories such as One Thousand and One Nights inspired the world’s first feature length animated film Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed (The Adventures of Prince Achmed, 1926) by Lotte Reiniger. As well as being inspired by a Middle Eastern narrative (Andrew Lang’s The Blue Fairy Book (1889)), this film ‘has the feel of traditional Asian shadow puppets’, thus also materially referencing the 8\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 8\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n9\n\nIntroduction\n\nancient Middle Eastern art form of puppetry.15 This continued to be the case later on, as the One Thousand and One Nights has become integral to a repertoire of transnational storytelling. For example, the Fleischer Studios’ 1936 film Popeye the Saylor meets Sinbad the Sailor also drew on one of One Thousand and One Nights’ most famous stories. An even more obvious adaptation of One Thousand and One Nights was created in the period when the market for theatrical shorts collapsed and apart from TV the only potentially profitable path was feature animation: UPA produced the Mister Magoo vehicle 1001 Arabian Nights in 1959, ‘with the Mister Magoo character tacked on to a traditional Aladdin story.’16 The phrasing here indicates the repeated usage of One Thousand and One Nights -inspired stories. However, animators clearly did not tire of this source of inspiration, as Disney’s Aladdin became an unprecedented box office success in 1991. In Animating Difference, the authors show how Aladdin was also one of the most controversial, perhaps even racist, films made by Disney, because it ‘reiterated Orientalist clichés in the immediate aftermath of the First Gulf War’. They also show ‘the efforts of the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) to educate the public about the stereotypes and misrepresentations central to the film’, and the racist contents of some of the original songs, which ‘allowed Disney and much of its audience to picture Arabs as barbaric others.’17 Richard Williams’ unfinished The Thief and the Cobbler (1993) is another adaptation of a One Thousand and One Nights story, with some of its staff ending up working on Disney’s Aladdin. In Reel Bad Arabs Jack Shaheen has shown that these films are highly problematic in their depictions of ‘Arabs’ and more broadly people from the Middle East. He was of course not the only one to notice this. Artists from the region have continually strived to create homegrown, relevant and recognisable content in their films, in opposition to the exoticisation and racial stereotypes of Arabs and other Middle Eastern peoples. While the transnational nature of animation, its inspiration and production, is part of a global tendency to collaborate on projects, what this volume aims to do is describe animated films as part of their specific local histories, while also revealing how regionalism came before the global industry it is developing into. While individual chapters have historical approaches, and cover a number of significant developments, the volume’s emphasis on practice and aesthetics hopes to expose parallel developments 9\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 9\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n10\n\nAnimation in the Middle East\n\nacross space and time. While it is too early to speak of a coherent industry in any of the nations under discussion here, there are large, active transnational networks of auteurs and entrepreneurs that reveal the early developments of an industry. These need to be awarded the attention they deserve as they have the potential to renew the animation industry, while they also need to be rooted firmly in local and regional histories, and as such can start to reveal circuits and networks of artists in the Middle East and North Africa. The search for innovative practices and locally-relevant aesthetics go hand in hand on this quest.\n\nFilling the Gaps Mohamed Ghazala was the first artist-educator to address the gaps that have been left in discourses on world animation. His short study Animation in the Arab World: A Glance on the Arabian Animated Films since 1936 (2011) is the first and only work dedicated to animated films from the Arab world so far. The impetus to publish this piece came precisely from the observation that while the Arabs and their folktales have inspired animated films from around the world, no published work has been dedicated to the study of Arab animated productions. Ghazala wrote the chapter on Egyptian animation for this volume, intending to expand on his own research and practice in the field. His groundwork has had to be complemented with archival research, interviews, accumulating online blog entries and articles, as well as original analyses of films, films that were made available either through contact established with the filmmakers or their studios, or through the ever-expanding network of videos on YouTube and Vimeo. Online source materials go hand in hand with the online availability of the films, and the entrepreneurial and/or revolutionary nature of many of these artists. As the Gulf region in particular continues to raise its profile on the global market as a strong competitor for American and European production companies, film festivals and distribution channels, boosting their profiles with an active online presence, so do revolutionaries in Syria, Egypt, Libya and Tunisia use the internet as a platform to spread idealistic political messages. The digital revolution has enabled smaller scale productions, as the ever-increasing wealth of the Gulf States has attracted foreign 10\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 10\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n11\n\nIntroduction\n\ninvestment and outsourced labour, but it also enabled the development of homegrown talent in films with high production values. Historically there may have been a lack of indigenous feature-length experiments, due to high costs, lack of training facilities and infrastructure, a limited pool of production-ready talent and the complete absence of government support for local initiatives.18 But in the contemporary world Abu Dhabi and Dubai are certainly at the forefront of film and animation production. In Dubai, the MBC group has developed local expertise and in Abu Dhabi the Cartoon Network Studios Arabia have equally supported local talent as they gain prominence and financial power thanks to their work on foreign productions.19 While work used to be subcontracted abroad, production is now more often handled and developed in the Middle East. These channels have enabled local talent to mature, as distribution of these products slowly but surely reaches global audiences. The revolutionaries of the last five years have increasingly claimed their space on online platforms. These artists might be the complementary section to the current entrepreneurial impetus in the Gulf, as producers are aware they require unique, interactive and relevant content beyond children’s edutainment. Building on the historic pioneers as well as the current wave of politically and socially inspired content instils local artists with increased self-confidence. The entrepreneurs, auteurs and revolutionaries of animation in the Middle East have in common a central interest in transnationalism and global reach. In the first place their inspiration and education in animation has been fed by the international scope of Disney and other major studios. Additionally, training and education has for the most part taken place abroad as well, in institutions in the UK, the US, Russia and Europe. This is changing rapidly, as Lebanese, Tunisian, Turkish and even Saudi Arabian universities and academies are now offering courses on animation and digital art. Local sources of inspiration are increasingly finding their audience, as the emphasis for auteurs lies on developing local content and styles. As the transnational nature of big-scale co-productions continues to inspire local entrepreneurs, so does the potential of global audiences inspire transnational distribution and exhibition, mainly through the many festival platforms. 11\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 11\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n12\n\nAnimation in the Middle East\n\nThe diversity in, and size of, the Middle East and North Africa determined the broad scope of this volume, which nevertheless necessarily lacks chapters on some countries. The first gap is the lack of engagement with Jordan, a country whose cinema culture is young but growing fast, both through the nurturing of homegrown talent and the Royal Film Commission’s (RFC) efforts to attract foreign filmmakers to locations in Jordan.20 As Anne Ciecko describes, Jordanian cinema started really in 2008, when Amin Matalqa, ‘the first Jordanian graduate of the American Film Institute, [directed] Captain Abu Raed (2008), an Amman-set narrative’, and received the World Cinema Audience Award.21 In addition to homegrown talent, many regional filmmakers have gone into self-imposed exile in Amman, where they experience freedom of expression in a more liberal and stable political climate. Ciecko concludes that film professionals thriving in Jordan possess a true entrepreneurial spirit.22 Within this entrepreneurial spirit, young Jordanian animator Tariq Rimawi has created two important films. In 2010, he graduated with a Master’s Degree in Animation from Newport Film School in the UK. His graduation stop-motion film Missing is about a child growing up in a wartorn area, longing for peacetime. The nostalgia embodied by this little child evokes acute sympathy, as his big eyes look perpetually sad, and he cannot find solace in the flowers and butterflies surrounding him. These flowers and butterflies return in Rimawi’s later work. In 2013, his CG short animated film Growing again shows the pain of growing up with war, as a child finds a weapon and ‘shoots’ a red heart balloon and a butterfly. The tropes of beauty and childhood destroyed by violence are effective in their evocation of how children suffer as they experience adult cruelty. Rimawi’s integrated auteurism and entrepreneurship are not only visible in his collaborations with local companies and his exploration of his own profile as the ‘first’ Jordanian animator, but also through his workshops, lectures and influence as a jury member at JoAnimate.23 Set up in 2012 under the more descriptive title Jordan Animation Festival, JoAnimate profiles itself as ‘the MENA region’s leading animation and creative arts and designs event’. The festival consists of a wide variety of components, including hands-on training and workshops with international industry experts. The festival also runs a competition for shorts, thus offering the opportunity to young, ambitious animators globally to get 12\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 12\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n13\n\nIntroduction\n\nnoticed. Mohammad Abusharif, one of the programmers for the festival, explained that for the competition JoAnimate only accepts short films by independent individual artists, not by production companies. The festival’s focus is on auteurism and fostering local talent. The best-represented countries in 2015 were Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Palestine. Jordanian Mahmoud Hindawi’s film The Street Artist (original title) won the main prize for Best Animated Film.24 The film, Hindawi’s first, is a universal story that looks at the (mis-) adventures of an ageing street artist who is experiencing a creative block. It is not until a local florist approaches him with compassion that he regains his lust for drawing and fills the empty frames in his house with images of flowers, children and people. Hindawi is an animator and cartoonist, who has worked on promotional and advertising videos in Jordan and on the Postman Pat film, after receiving an MA from the University of South Wales in the UK. For The Street Artist he used himself as inspiration for the figure of the artist, thus also confirming his interest in the auteurist status of the animator (see image 0.1). The characters in the film and its locations are a mix of British and Arab-inspired elements: architecture in the film is distinctly British-European, while the characters carry a universal look, even if the models for the artist carry political undertones that suggest Arab stereotypes. Quite opposite to Tariq Rimawi’s visualisation\n\n0.1 Still from The Street Artist, directed by Mahmoud Hindawi (2014)\n\n13\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 13\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n14\n\nAnimation in the Middle East\n\nof war winning over beauty, Hindawi’s film lets love triumph over loneliness and misunderstanding. This film is about looking at the surfaces of people versus really seeing their inner selves: where the artist is able to see and understand his models’ inner truth, the models themselves are averse to being confronted with this. The artist practices his art not for money – another strong statement about Hindawi’s auteurist status.25 Apart from JoAnimate’s focus on local independent talent, the festival also holds a Regional Talents and Business Forum that showcases production companies, to offer independent animators the chance to network with local and regional companies. The festival does this with an eye to developing a ‘regional animation ecosystem and industry.’26 One of their main aims is to attract international players to meet local talent and develop further local opportunities, in the context of the speedily expanding role of Jordan in the world of Arab and Middle Eastern cinema, for entrepreneurs. The festival is interested first and foremost in their global reach benefiting local talent. The bulk of the talks and discussion panels moreover focus either on the practical side of the animation industry or on the Arab character of Middle Eastern animation, and how to develop that specific local flavour in animation. This trend, expressing a sense of dissidence in the phrasing of a local character for local animation, also expresses a continued and consistent opposition to the dominance of ‘foreign’ cultures in animation, while the festival and the animation industry at large attract foreign investment, either for location-shooting or for business opportunities. This twopronged approach to animation as an industry and an auteurist art form looking for an identity specific to the region is visible in all chapters in this volume. As the main goal of this volume is to start to draw a likeness of animation’s history in the Middle East and North Africa, much of our time goes to the pioneers, the auteurs, the experimenters. This has also seemed to be the main movement forward for animation in Algeria. While in the early years of independence in Algeria, animation was used (as was the rest of cinema production) in a way that endorsed the FLN government, in a sense as a didactic tool in the formation of a national Algerian identity,27 more recently Algeria has profiled itself as the country where ‘the Arab world’s first animation film festival’ was held, in December 2012.28,29 Organised by the Al-Jaahiziyya association, Algeria’s foremost cultural association, 14\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 14\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n15\n\nIntroduction\n\nthis festival’s programme shows an overall concern with auteur films, similarly to JoAnimate, screening films discussing social issues like unemployment and housing problems, or portraying the current political situation in the Arab world. As festival director Mustafa Kilani said, ‘the festival is an attempt to open up new horizons for this unique genre, a genre that we love but neglect with the excuse that production costs are high’. He continues: ‘new technologies have cut down these costs, enabling filmmakers to launch into animation, compete at international film festivals, and win prizes. The festival’s goal is to introduce this genre into the Arab world, and to showcase our filmmakers’ talent and potential.’30 This again shows a major concern with the development of local talent, and with opportunities for these auteurs to showcase their art regionally. Slightly more than a year after this inaugural animation festival focusing on Arab animation, Algeria also hosted its first International Animation Film Festival. This festival aimed to put Algiers on the map as a player on the international field of more commercial animation, and to help give the form a firmer place in the country’s cinema culture. With attention paid to the role of Algeria in Arab and African cinema, it also held a number of round-table discussions with Arab and African experts in the field.31 Once again, there is a clear focus on a confident development of local sources and resources, even at international animation festivals in the region. While these initiatives to put Jordan and Algeria on the world map for animation are very recent, animation in Algeria is actually quite old, compared to the countries around it. In the spirit of national independence and a focus on local concerns, Mohamed Aram created short animated films for television, in opposition to colonial production. He has since the 1960s created more than 50 short films.32 As an autodidact, he started work for Algerian TV in the early 1960s. In 1964 he was hired by the Centre National du Cinéma to become the director of the new animation department. His first animated short, La fête de l’arbre (The Festival of the Tree) came out in 1963. In black and white, the film deals with the necessity of reforestation after the war for independence. He also made Ah, s’il savait lire (Oh, If He Knew How to Read) and Microbes des poubelles (Viruses in Bins) in 1964, which dealt with illiteracy problems and health and hygiene for the local population respectively. For Aram, animation has a social function: his films are all essentially educational, infused with moral themes pertinent 15\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 15\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n16\n\nAnimation in the Middle East\n\nto the contemporary problems of Algeria. He is passionate about the young population needing to see local, recognisable and relevant images on their television screens, in their own language, because for a long time the majority of Algerians have been illiterate. But this clear path that he had set for himself as the educator of his audiences, as well as his self-taught passion for the art form and his prolific nature, did not solve any of his initial problems with finding support for his chosen art. Animation remained neglected by the cinema authorities in Algeria,33 and when he was asked to retire and offered a bonus, the auteur used this gift once again in the service of his art: with the bonus he bought his own equipment which enabled him to continue to make his chosen type of films independently. Today, Aram testifies: ‘the situation of Algerian animation is abysmal’: only a few studios are making animation, and the insurmountable problems are caused mostly by the dominance of TV over cinema in Algeria, a historical problem with Islamism and the closure of cinemas, and a general lack of interest in and money for animated films. His social concerns and his concern for his young audiences do place him firmly within the general trend where local content and a relevant social background become central to the animated stories told on screen, reflecting a growing self-confidence. He is adamant that ‘those responsible for finances need to realise that we need to develop Algerian children through images rooted in their own culture and language.’34 As the development of local content is central to the growth of local audiences and funding, auteurs as well as entrepreneurs are taking on the task of acquiring and improving a self-conscious locally inspired content and design for films that become increasingly ambitious and accessible globally. It is within this context that animation in the Middle East is maturing quickly and becoming fully aware of its market and artistic potential.\n\nChronology of the Chapters The order of the chapters in this volume is subject to three logics: chronological, geographical and aesthetic. Firstly, the nature of this volume is historical, and it re-writes or un-writes an existing canon. Through the strongest ideas in every chapter, we tease out an ‘imagined’ chronology: from an animation of folklore and tradition in Iraq, over twelve countries, 16\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 16\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n17\n\nIntroduction\n\nwe move to the animated internet communities in Morocco. This does not mean that the Iraqi film is not digital: it is entirely digital. And it does not mean that Moroccan animation does not refer to local folklore. On the contrary, it is strongly inspired by tradition and folklore. But the central argument of these chapters focuses, respectively, on Iraqi folktales rising out of the ashes of a destroyed city like a phoenix, and on Moroccan animators’ social networking skills and the country’s strong presence on the film festival circuit, another – often digital – network. These ideas of rebirth and accessibility are the beginning and end of the volume. Secondly, the geographical scope goes hand in hand with the chronological spread: from Baghdad to Casablanca means, literally, that the Middle East is a huge area, and that between the easternmost Arab city of Baghdad35 and the westernmost city of Casablanca, the scope of the volume is diverse, multiple and wide. Thirdly, again, the aesthetic logic is inherently bound up with chronology and geography: in the Arabic and Persian scripts, the main scripts dominating the area under discussion, one writes from right to left, from Baghdad to Casablanca. As such, the volume ‘reads’ the region’s geography and chronology from right to left. The central idea running through the volume is the development of local contents and styles, but the inspiration behind these is transnational. From Iraq and Iran, over Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, to Turkey, and Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and North Africa with Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Morocco, this volume offers an entirely new history of a place, an art form and artists who need to be recognised individually and, importantly, as a collective. Animation did not suddenly sprout out of nowhere. It is and has always been an inherent part of a transnational film history, where a language is created that goes beyond words – a language of art and images that speak from and to political, economic and artistic sensibilities all over the world. In Chapter 1, Amber Shields theorises ideas of animated cultural historical memory in Iraq through an in-depth discussion of Furat Al-Jamil’s Baghdad Night (2013), Iraq’s first-ever digital animated film. We start with Iraq as Shields and Al-Jamil look upon Baghdad as a city that can, through art, rise up from its ashes like a phoenix. As protracted war and oppression have dominated Iraq’s history, films have often been made in Iraq, but not necessarily by Iraqis. It is perhaps surprising but mostly inspirational that a proportionally large number of artists and filmmakers from Iraq are 17\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 17\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n18\n\nAnimation in the Middle East\n\nwomen. Maysoon Pachachi plays an important role in the development of local talent in fiction and documentary, while Furat Al-Jamil is the first Iraqi woman to create an animation. Inspired by a local traditional folktale, the film was developed with a transnational team. The chapter explores how the film reconstructs a community narrative by rendering an old Iraqi folktale attractive to young audiences through animation. Committed to saving the tale from extinction, Al-Jamil’s process of resurrecting the past through 3D animation also represents a commitment to the future. Appealing to young audiences who have grown up during conflict and suffered extreme disengagement with the past, this animation offers not only the possibility to reconnect them with their past but also provides a path towards the integration of past and present into a new future for the nation. In Chapter 2 artist and scholar Maryam Ghorbankarimi describes the key stages of Iranian animation, through an integrated history of its institutions, Ministries and organisations. She highlights the slow development of the art form from a tool in education-related film and TV shows, to intellectual experimentation in the 1960s and 1970s and back to educational purposes post-1979. This chapter is also the first of many to acknowledge the tremendous influence advertising has had on the development of a local animated style. It shows how the first examples of modern animation were not seen until the late 1950s, coinciding with the broader intellectual art movements of the late 1950s and 1960s and the Iranian New Wave. After the Revolution, animation remained a celebrated artistic medium and continued through the same institutions, but under new leadership. Ghorbankarimi argues that animation appears never to have become entirely mainstream. Its exclusive nature has allowed for the subjects and stories portrayed to be critical of society and politically charged. Chapter 3 describes the inherently transnational nature of animation import and co-production in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region. Omar Sayfo shows, through an auteurist approach, how producers outsourced the labour-intensive process while there is a strong emphasis on the development of local Islamic and educational content. Early animation in the Gulf region was triggered by the one-way inward flow of foreign productions. A limited number of Saudi feature-length animated cartoons appeared in the early 1990s, but it took until the mid-2000s for animation production to experience significant growth. Economic, political, social and technological 18\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 18\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n19\n\nIntroduction\n\ndevelopments in the 1990s enabled a generation of young entrepreneurs to establish their own companies and build professional networks for animation production. The regional popularity and financial success of animation encouraged authors and producers from other Gulf countries to create their own productions, targeting local (national) audiences. Inspired by this, new local series from Kuwait, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Oman have been articulating national identities, by using local dialects and referring to local culture. Sayfo shows that, despite their assumed censored nature, animated cartoons from the Gulf are in fact inherently political, as they are largely involved in nation building and also in the reconstruction – and in a sense the production – of ideas like ‘home,’ ‘community’ and ‘locality’. In these homegrown films different understandings of nation, religion and identity are defined and redefined against rival imported formulas. In Chapter 4, on Turkish animation as a contemporary reflection of the Karagöz shadow play, Turkish artist Başak Ürkmez roots animation firmly in a strong theatre and cinema tradition, while emphasising the development of the field through advertising and commercial animated ventures. Karagöz shadow theatre and caricature functioned as a source of inspiration historically, while recent developments in digital art and advertising have influenced contemporary animation. With the economic boom and the industrialisation process, animation experienced a rapid growth in the 1960s. Advertising companies established animation studios. With the social and political transformations of the 1990s, Turkish society once again became increasingly conservative. Ürkmez shows how the succession of military coups and political instability in Turkey continue to define cinema and animation production not only through its institutions, but also in its content and style. In Chapter 5, Stefanie Van de Peer shows how Syrian animation has gone from a struggle to animate to a suspension of movement due to the Syrian civil war. From cartoonists, imported and television animation, animated features co-produced with the National Film Organisation in the 2000s and regional collaborative work with the Gulf Cooperation Council, to the eventual suspension of animation due to the impasse of the Syrian Revolution in a transnational network of online dissent, animators have had to deal with censorship and outright political danger. In spite of adverse political conditions, young people continuously find the courage 19\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 19\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n20\n\nAnimation in the Middle East\n\nand energy to create their art and animation. The chapter argues that it is the recent turmoil in the country that has pushed these animators, and specifically Sulafa Hijazi, out of Syria, and into different art forms. In exile, most Syrian animation has come to a full stop – a suspension or interruption – but their commitment to a politically outspoken, Arab aesthetic for their artwork is firmer than ever. Lina Ghaibeh and George Khoury (Jad) describe, in Chapter 6, a rich Lebanese cartoon culture, developed within the relatively liberal nature of the country’s position in the Middle East, where Khoury, as he set up Future TV, started to develop a productive manner of producing experimental and innovative animation. Khoury and Ghaibeh discuss the developing role of education in the Lebanese animated world, and the establishment of a specialised festival in Beirut. Collaborations of artists with educational institutions and film festivals further developed a distinctively artistic animation culture, fed by a fast-developing commercial sector employing animation in its approach to advertising. The chapter focuses on independent animators targeting an adult audience and goes into the production and making of animation shorts screened on various platforms. These new trends have ensured the start of a formation of a dedicated audience in spite of the lack of funding or support for animation films. In Chapter 7, on animation in Palestine, Colleen Jankovic looks at the idea behind Amer Shomali’s concept of the ‘Pixelated Intifada’, and at the contemporary reality of digital occupation. She discusses two very important films, Fatenah (2009) and The Wanted 18 (2014), contextualised by the stunted growth of the idea of Palestinian cinema. A tendency to make use of training opportunities abroad, co-productions with NGOs, and digital collaborations characterise Palestinian films. Palestine may be seen by some as a transnational ‘cause’ but its films demand a shared point of view from inside Palestine. A close reading of The Wanted 18 frames the discussion of Palestinian animation’s multi-media political and cultural heritage, as well as Palestinian animation’s formal diversity and its unique production challenges. A comparative reading with other films – such as Ahmed Habash’s 3D short Fatenah and installation animation work by Dia’ Azzeh provides further insight into a dissident national cultural project. Chapter 8 looks at Israeli animation, and its burden of representation, or how it moves beyond this. Yael Friedman outlines how the 20\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 20\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n21\n\nIntroduction\n\nentrepreneurial spirit inherent to animation globally also defined burgeoning Israeli animation in the 1970s. As Friedman shows, Waltz with Bashir by Ari Folman (2008) undoubtedly marks an important achievement, but by no means represents the breadth and diversity the form takes on in contemporary Israeli media and film industries. She questions the ways in which different animated works correspond with the multifaceted Israeli culture and the dominant discourse that informs its production. Some works share Waltz’s political consciousness and delineate a particular ‘Israeli’ story, while the majority of works engage in more ahistorical and universal tales of human experience. In this way the animated form perhaps frees the cinematic medium from the constraints that govern much of the production of live-action films, enabling transnational audiences to transcend the political and historical specificities of Israel, and of the Middle East at large. In Chapter 9, artist Mohamed Ghazala traces the art of animation in Egypt, the country in the Middle East and on the African continent with the oldest film industry. From the earliest experiments with form, style and Arab content in the 1930s by the famous Frenkel Brothers, over the commercial work of another pair, the Moheeb Brothers in the 1950s, it is clear that the search for an internal and national identity in animation is at the forefront of this confident nation. This moved to experimental works by Ihab Shaker 1960s and 1970s, and a golden era of production in the 1990s and 2000s, with female animator Mona Abu Al-Nasr, showing how the history of animation in Egypt is one that has evolved from prominent individuals to one that boasts rich regional collaborations and initiatives, among others by Ghazala himself. Ghazala delineates the current entrepreneurial spirit as well as the newly found political activism among Egypt’s young populations. The artistic and dramatic changes and developments to the art of animation in the country, as well as the different values and quality between commercial works and artistic ones, culminates in an increasingly confident self-expression since the Egyptian Revolution. In Chapter 10, Nisrine Mansour continues with the idea of revolution in/as animation. She destroys the common idea that Libya has no cinema tout court. She shows how – similarly to Syria – artists learned to function within a repressive regime. Mansour illustrates how political satire could function in a country where the media was completely dominated by 21\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 21\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n22\n\nAnimation in the Middle East\n\none man. With the spark of the Libyan Revolution, social media websites buzzed with illustration and animation artwork by seasoned and emerging Libyan artists. This act of protest unveiled five decades of untapped illustrated satirical heritage that preceded, endured, and survived Gaddafi’s rule, raising questions on the possibility of animated critique under oppressive censorship. Libyan cartoonist Mohamad Zwawi’s legacy paved the way for a new generation of savvy animators who skilfully manoeuvred censorship to broadcast a satirical animated series, Boq`at Jaw, on national TV. With the fall of the Gaddafi regime, these artists had to reposition their artwork and seek new avenues of socio-political critique. Through the research for her own documentary, The Morganti Rebels, Mansour traces the changing representations of citizenship and governance, gender relations, familial and social dynamics, and political protest in pre and post-revolutionary Libya. Chapter 11 deals with Tunisian animation, made and exhibited against an authoritarian backdrop. In this chapter, animation artist and scholar Maya Ben Ayed surveys Tunisian animation from the so-called pioneers to the more contemporary era, illustrating how animation is such a new artform in Tunisia that some of these pioneers have never left the scene. In studies of North African cinema, Tunisian cinema is a fairly well-covered topic, as it went through a Golden Age in the eighties and nineties. However, people only saw animated films at the famous Carthage Film Festival and on some of the many other alternative circuits of cinema in the North African country. Ben Ayed shows a circular movement, where the two authoritarian regimes Tunisia has known since independence limited production but also provided the inspiration for daring, politically outspoken, artistic and metaphoric animated short films. In the last chapter, focusing on Moroccan animation, Paula Callus unravels the converging networks and communities that developed after Moroccan cinema flourished in the 1990s, and after digital artists discovered and started exploiting the internet. As was the case in mainstream cinema, individual artists started with experimentation in diverse digital art forms, developing their skills in commercial ventures, only to return to their origins in fine arts and experimental, innovative animation. Moroccan animation is hardly visible at European animation festivals, but its presence online, the audiences it has garnered and the number of specialist 22\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 22\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n23\n\nIntroduction\n\nsocial network groups for animation artists, suggest that there is a new generation of digital artists afoot. This chapter focuses on these emergent animators who are capitalising on the use of the computer to create moving images that straddle different aesthetic practices as they mobilise themselves transnationally through expert use of web-based technologies.\n\nConclusion: Transnational Connections and Identities Animation is beautiful and addictive, but expensive, arduous and undervalued. Most chapters therefore draw attention to the artists’ inspirations but also to the institutions necessary to keep the artists going. Each country has its own specific organisations dedicated to animation, whether this is through festivals or associations that look into and promote the rights of artists, such as SPGIL, the Syndicate of Professional Graphic Designers and Illustrators in Lebanon (since 1996), IAC, Israeli Animation Centre (since 2000), FICAM, the Meknès International Animation Festival (since 2000) and AMCA, L’Association Marocaine du Cinema d’Animation (since 2014), and the Guild of Egyptian Animators (since 2011). Undoubtedly one of the most important and well-established organisations for animation in the Middle East (and globally) is ASIFA, the Association Internationale du Film d’Animation (International Association for the Animated Film). It was founded in 1960 in Annecy (France, where the animation film festival is still held) by the most influential animation artists of that time. Today the association has more than 30 chapters, and it runs the International Animation Day as well as various ASIFA workshops all over the world. As the pre-eminent transnational animation organisation, ASIFA is a collection of national and regional groups, and individual members across the globe, aiming to ‘share information, preserve the rights of animators, and promote progress towards peace and understanding through a unified interest in the art of animation.’36 The ASIFA website shows that Iran, Israel and Egypt are official chapters of the organisation, with Noureddin Zarrinkelk, Tsvika Oren and Mohamed Ghazala respectively as representatives. Iran joined as the first Middle Eastern group: unofficially in 1978 and officially in 1986. Next came Israel in 1985, and Egypt, as the first Arab country to join, did so in 2008. 23\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 23\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n24\n\nAnimation in the Middle East\n\nZarrinkelk (whose work is discussed in Chapter 2) was the founder of the Iranian chapter of ASIFA in 1986, which today boasts several hundred members. The work of ASIFA-Israel, though it was established early on, became more consistent in the 1990s, and included the launch of an annual bulletin in 1991 and, since 2001, showcases an annual Animix competition of Israeli animation. In Egypt, Ihab Shaker (mentioned in Chapter 9) worked with the French pioneer Paul Grimault, who was the head of ASIFA at that time. As Ghazala testifies, Shaker joined ASIFA as its first Arab and African member. Ghazala himself, as the contemporary Egyptian representative on the ASIFA board, sees his task as an educational one, focusing on the Arab and African region, training local animation artists and providing workshops all over the continents, while he also promotes the work of Arab and African animators at animation festivals all over the world. Lastly, as Ürkmez says (in Chapter 4), Turkey is also a full member of ASIFA since 2012. Joining ASIFA is crucial for the smaller local organisations, as the aspirations of local artists can be represented with more influence and recognition by a transnational organisation with the calibre of ASIFA. It is organisations like these that provide artists, producers and scholars involved in animation with the support and acknowledgement they need. This volume draws together the diverse and fragmented strands of local productions, regional co-productions, the influence of early pioneers, television and contemporary digital interventions as well as cinematic animated films. The internet is an archive of animated films, especially since the so-called ‘Arab Spring’. Some of the earliest films have been unearthed and uploaded, while an increasing number of activists and artists upload their work in the spirit of availability and global reach. Some media archaeology is therefore undertaken in the chapters, and – where possible – links to online videos have been included in the notes, in an effort to increase the accessibility of these films. It is my hope that this volume will contribute to and influence the process of dissident canon formation through creating new audiences for Middle Eastern animated films, scholarly and otherwise. This volume wishes to contribute to the opening up to the world of animation from a region as rich, culturally diverse and inspiring as the Middle East. 24\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 24\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n25\n\nIntroduction\n\nNotes 1.

Neither of these two popular films are Arab, but they have contributed to the opening up of the region’s animated production. 2.

This idea of being the ‘first’ to organise or create something within the history of animation returns throughout the book, but need not be taken at face value. As JoAnimate was also established in 2012, and takes place in November, we might presume that Jordan was in fact the ‘first’ to organise a festival dedicated to animation in the Arab world. 30. ‘Arab world’s first animation film fest held in Algiers’. 31.

Furat Al-Jamil2\n\nAt the top of her blog, Iraqi-German artist Furat Al-Jamil has placed the three words ‘always a phoenix’. Bookended by ellipses, it is a line with no defined story preceding or following from it. Yet despite these uncertainties, one thing is clear: the mythical phoenix symbolises the hope that out of the ashes of its unknown past it will be reborn and fly into a new future. Al-Jamil’s short animation Baghdad Night (2013) exemplifies this myth. Drawing on Iraqi folklore, her work retells the story of the Sa’luwa, a succubus who bewitches men. An enduring figure, she appears in works ranging from oral folktales to The One Thousand and One Nights. Intertwined with, and working to preserve, this evidence of a rich cultural heritage, 29\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 29\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n30\n\nAnimation in the Middle East\n\nAl-Jamil’s animation is a rebirth of the traditional tale. Her modern version unfolds in a noir-styled rendition of Baghdad where, over the course of three nights, the Sa’luwa seduces a young taxi driver. The choice to reanimate this cultural historical memory through animation is intriguing, for though Iraq has played a part in transnational animation projects in the past, an industry or even a notable trajectory for animation has yet to develop in a country where a lack of history, infrastructure and trained specialists forestall this industry’s growth. Iraqi cinema history has been dependent on the drastic historical shifts the country has undergone since the 1920s. Cinematic activity started to take shape during that decade, but it took until the 1940s, with British and French investment, before any significant filmmaking initiatives began. The Baghdad Studio was set up in 1948, to be replaced in 1959 by the Cinema and Theatre General that, under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture and Guidance, aimed to espouse the political goals of the regime. Insurgencies, war and autocratic rule further shaped cinema development as grand film projects were limited to propagandistic productions and audiences avoided public spaces like cinemas because of the dangers of war. It was not until 1968 that Norman Emberson Hoy was sent to Baghdad by UNESCO to explore the possibility of setting up a viable animation studio in the country. As he reported: ‘There has never been any cartoon animation in Iraq, so the “development” was in fact a beginning.’3 Hoy was there to ‘establish the mechanics to enable cartoon animation’ while ‘investigating the sources of talent for its creation’. Though he found the country under-equipped, Hoy noted a considerable interest in the art form. Working with enthusiastic and versatile technicians enabled him to set up a nascent studio to create basic animated films. The Iraqi Baath Party came to power during Hoy’s stay in Iraq. The films he was requested to facilitate were ‘largely connected with information, education and culture’, in line with the Baath Party’s developing power and its position towards film. Apart from a televised animation initiative in the 1980s (described below), it was not until 2005 that any information regarding developing animation initiatives could be found related to Iraq or Iraqi artists. In 2005 Iraqi theatre and television director Thamer AlZaidi directed the feature-length Ibn Al-Ghabah (The Jungle Kid) in exile. This Kuwait-based production featured a pan-Arab cast and was based 30\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 30\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n31\n\nRestoring Cultural Historical Memories\n\non a story from the book Hai bin Yaqzan by twelfth-century Andalusian scholar Ibn Toufyl. The country’s limited animation history, as well as the contemporary working conditions in Iraq which added great complications to the creation of Al-Jamil’s technologically advanced piece, raise questions as to the decision to use animation in Baghdad Night. This chapter explores the contributions of animation to this film and how this particular form of representation adds another layer of rebirth to traditional storytelling as it transitions to new media platforms. The legend of the phoenix parallels the turmoil and actual fire that the Sa’luwa story endured in order to be reborn into its current state. As an Iraqi animation project, it was shaped by the recent decades of external and civil conflict that continue to physically, politically, economically and culturally devastate the country. One casualty of these ongoing conflicts has been the link to the past from which the tale originates. Lina Khatib proposes that one of the questions to be investigated as Iraq looks to move forward is how the country can address the relics of the past.4 Though cultural heritage projects may not seem as the most pressing concern in a country still grappling with re-establishing basic amenities, quelling violent uprisings and forming a stable government, they offer a way of restoring ties to a unifying cultural heritage that are essential as Iraq struggles to build a new identity and a more peaceful future. Furat Al-Jamil’s Baghdad Night is one of these projects. Central to this essay is an exploration of how one folktale’s rebirth through animation contributes to the restoration of Iraq’s ruptured connection to its past. It proposes what is termed here ‘cultural historical memory’ as playing a part in re-establishing links to the past to aid in the healing process after dramatic historical ruptures. The case of Al-Jamil’s animated folktale is an example of how cultural heritage is reinvented in and for the present context, serving as a cultural historical memory that seeks to unify people according to cultural affinities rather than national or religious dictates. Furthermore, it underscores how animation appeals to the younger generations who, most dramatically split from the past, must necessarily be included in this reconciliation process as they offer the hope for the future. This chapter explores the creation and conveyance of cultural historical memories, as well as identity formation, through the arts and cinema 31\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 31\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n32\n\nAnimation in the Middle East\n\ngenerally, and through animation specifically. Firstly it presents an examination of Iraq’s use of historical memory in creating a collective identity,5 followed by an exploration of how projects relating to folklore, like AlJamil’s, play a role in collective identity formation through cultural historical memory. Secondly it proposes Baghdad Night as critically engaged with the examined issues and the process of restoring a collective Iraqi identity. In its examination of the specifics of Al-Jamil’s project and its use of folklore and animation, this chapter shows the importance of cultural heritage restoration in national reconstruction processes. As Iraq still struggles to reconnect with the past, establish itself in the present and envision its future, projects like Baghdad Night will play a significant role in shaping what is reborn out of the ashes.\n\nPreserving Cultural Heritage through Cultural Historical Memory Iraq’s present struggle to restore its ruptured links to the past is not just a response to recent conflicts, but is an issue Iraq has been acutely aware of since its emergence as a nation-state in 1921.6 This connection to the past is important for emerging states looking to define themselves as historical memory can be a tool of legitimation. Focusing on the Baath Party’s reign from 1968 to 2003, political scientist Eric Davis examines how history, memory and culture were used to shape an Iraqi national identity to reflect the Party’s values and legitimise its rule.7 This effort included a promotion of folklore, with the state sponsoring folklore centres, journals and formal studies, as a means for the Baath Party to, according to Tareq Y. Ismael and Max Fuller, secularise and instil a ‘sense of Iraqi nationhood or “Iraqi-ness” […] that progressively supplanted one’s identity as Sunni, Shiite, Christian.’8 These undertakings reinforced a common Iraqi identity centred on a proud heritage. Film also served to reinforce this sense of identity and the Party’s political decisions. Cinema was heavily controlled and censored by the Baathist state, leading to the production of several nationalist films. These films would often call upon historical memories to justify current political actions. For example, Al-Qadisiya (Salah Abu Sayf, 1981) portrayed the conquest of Iraq by the Sasanians to garner support for the war against Iran, 32\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 32\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n33\n\nRestoring Cultural Historical Memories\n\nwhile Al-Malik Ghazi (King Ghazi, Muhammad Shurki Jamil, 1993) was an epic film created to justify the invasion of Kuwait. Cinema also contributed to modern mythologising of Iraq’s recent past in Al-Ayyam Al-Tawila (The Long Days, Salih Tawfiq, 1980) with its re-imagining of Saddam Hussein’s position in the country’s history. During this period, Iraq produced its first animation for television, which contributed to this fascination with historical memory. In 1982, Iraqi Television and The Arabic Centre for Animation Films funded the international co-production Al-Amira WalNahr (The Princess and the River, Faisal Al-Yassiri), portraying a long ago, if not necessarily far away, fairytale story. However, the strict impositions that the Baath Party put on cinematic production crippled the industry. The problem was compounded by the trade boycott against Iraq making shooting materials scarce, and resulted in a fall in production after 1991, limiting animation to a few TV series.9 While the state did indeed succeed in cultivating some sense of ‘Iraqiness’, the Baath Party’s association with this identity proved unfavourable after their removal from power. The disintegration of the Baathist state had two major consequences: the country’s physical destruction as well as the intangible destruction of Iraq’s national identity and cultural heritage. According to Al-Jamil, a lack of cultural references in Iraq’s education curriculum, combined with increased religious fanaticism, materialism and corruption, ‘has led Iraq’s population to become alienated from their country’s rich cultural heritage.’10 As resources are directed towards rebuilding more concrete facets of society and with the alienation that sectarian violence promotes, these parts of cultural heritage are at risk of being lost forever. The tangible ramifications of this threat can already be seen in the destruction of physical symbols of the country’s cultural heritage. Since the 2003 Coalition forces’ invasion and the fall of Saddam Hussein, there has been a widespread movement on both official and unofficial levels to rid the nation of all cultural symbols erected by his party and, consequently, the national identity constructed under the Baathists.11 This process of ‘deBaathification’ or ‘de-culturalisation’ has resulted in the loss of not only markers of the more recent past, but of Iraq’s Mesopotamian legacy as well, overall threatening the sense of identity built around cultural historical memories.12 Here, the deliberate destruction in disproportionately violent 33\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 33\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n34\n\nAnimation in the Middle East\n\ncampaigns against symbolic and everyday landmarks of the built environment can lead to the more intangible foundations of a society that can, in turn, lead to further physical destruction. The waves of sectarian fighting that have erupted in Iraq since the 2003 invasion exemplify the physical violence created and perpetuated by cultural violence.13 One recourse to address the fissions created by cultural violence is a reversion to historical or cultural memory. Davis and historian Maria Todorova use the term ‘historical memory’ in their emphasis on political and social fusion through reversion to the past.14 These memories can also be used to create identity in the social realm, especially when emphasising cultural aspects. Cultural theorists such as Marita Sturken and Svetlana Boym have emphasised how the cultural sides of memory can be crucial to understanding collective identity especially during times of political and social change.15 In all these cases, memory is explored as a force that brings people together in a common sense of identity, instilling it with a commanding power that can be used to influence collectives. Al-Jamil’s animation incorporates these aspects of memory in a project of ‘cultural historical memory’. Emphasising the historical, the folktale fulfils the purposes of Davis’ and Todorova’s historical memory by evoking interpretations of the past to establish a common history and by serving as an example for the present. However, the memory of the folktale, more than just being seen as a socially defined historical memory, also highlights its cultural aspects. Sturken stresses how culture can instil an identity that serves as a political tool, especially in building and defining national identities. Finally, the term ‘cultural historical memory’ is used in this chapter to separate it from the political connotations that historical memory has in Iraq. Folklore has been used both politically and socially as a foundation for memories and identities, forming its own past that contributes to AlJamil’s use of folklore as a cultural historical memory.\n\nCreating National Identities through Folk Culture Constructing a palatable national identity based on historical memory during times when the immediate past is controversial necessitates an evocation of a more distant past. Folk culture serves as an ideal approach to escaping current divides by resurrecting what Boym refers to as the 34\n\n9781784533267_pi-297.indd 34\n\n2/2/2017 7:12:15 PM\n\n35\n\nRestoring Cultural Historical Memories\n\n‘potential space of cultural experience’ where – free of national and religious affiliations – human relations are developed and culturalisation of new members into society occurs.16 In his studies on collective memory, Maurice Halbwachs points out how memories passed through collective frameworks perpetuate traditions, yet change to reflect current collective contexts,17 combining past and present to shape the individual and society. As part of this process, cultural heritage is passed on through traditions like folktales and serves as a foundation for shared cultural historical memory, as well as for its potential to create societal relationships and foster unity. Cultural historical memory is often used by political and social groups to create national identity. This is especially true after turbulent disruptions make the familiarity and stability offered by these memories most appealing. Folk culture is one powerful means of evoking cultural historical memories. Folktales often serve the purpose of uniting groups, as they teach abou"
