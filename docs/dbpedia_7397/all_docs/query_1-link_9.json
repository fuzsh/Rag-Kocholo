        "text": "Sir Muhammad Iqbal (; Urdu: محمد اِقبال‎; 9 November 1877 – 21 April 1938), widely known as Allama Iqbal was a poet, philosopher and politician, as well as an academic, barrister and scholar in British India who is widely regarded as having inspired the Pakistan Movement. He is called the \"Spiritual Father of Pakistan.\" He is considered one of the most important figures in Urdu literature, with literary work in both Urdu and Persian.Iqbal is admired as a prominent poet by Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Iranians and other international scholars of literature. Though Iqbal is best known as an eminent poet, he is also a highly acclaimed \"Muslim philosophical thinker of modern times\". His first poetry book, The Secrets of the Self, appeared in the Persian language in 1915, and other books of poetry include The Secrets of Selflessness, Message from the East and Persian Psalms. Amongst these, his best known Urdu works are The Call of the Marching Bell, Gabriel's Wing, The Rod of Moses and a part of Gift from Hijaz. Along with his Urdu and Persian poetry, his Urdu and English lectures and letters have been very influential in cultural, social, religious and political discourses.In the`1922 New Years Honours he was made a Knight Bachelor by King George V, While studying law and philosophy in England, Iqbal became a member of the London branch of the All-India Muslim League. Later, during the League's December 1930 session, he delivered his most famous presidential speech known as the Allahabad Address in which he pushed for the creation of a Muslim state in north-west India.In much of South Asia and the Urdu-speaking world, Iqbal is regarded as the Shair-e-Mashriq (Urdu: شاعر مشرق‎, \"Poet of the East\"). He is also called Mufakkir-e-Pakistan (Urdu: مفکر پاکستان‎, \"The Thinker of Pakistan\"), Musawar-e-Pakistan (Urdu: مصور پاکستان‎, \"Artist of Pakistan\") and Hakeem-ul-Ummat (Urdu: حکیم الامت‎, \"The Sage of the Ummah\"). The Pakistan government officially named him \"National Poet of Pakistan\". His birthday Yōm-e Welādat-e Muḥammad Iqbāl (Urdu: یوم ولادت محمد اقبال‎), or Iqbal Day, is a public holiday in Pakistan.Iqbal's house is still located in Sialkot and is recognized as Iqbal's Manzil and is open for visitors. His other house where he lived most of his life and died is in Lahore, named as Javed Manzil. The museum is located on Allama Iqbal Road near Lahore Railway Station, Punjab, Pakistan. It was protected under the Punjab Antiquities Act of 1975, and declared a Pakistani national monument in 1977.\n\nIshtiaq Hussain Qureshi, SP, HI, was a Pakistani historian, scholar, writer, and a professor a political history at the Karachi University. An early activist of the historic Pakistan Movement, Qureshi served in the ministries of education and frontier regions as the secretary; in addition, he successfully stood up for the parliament of Pakistan. But, due to his association with the academia, he resigned from his government appointments and joined the academic faculty at the Columbia University as a professor of Soviet history. But soon, he returned to Pakistan and founded the National Language Authority in the 1970s. Later, Qureshi joined the faculty of history at the University of Karachi where he remained there the remainder of his life. Qureshi is also credited for editing a four-volume series on history of Pakistan.\n\nSyed Abul A'la Maududi (Urdu: ابو الاعلی مودودی‎ – alternative spellings of last name Maudoodi, Mawdudi, also known as Abul Alā Mawdūdī; (1903-09-25)25 September 1903 – (1979-09-22)22 September 1979) was a Pakistani Muslim philosopher, jurist, journalist and imam. His numerous works, which \"covered a range of disciplines such as Qur’anic exegesis, hadith, law, philosophy and history\", were written in Urdu, but then translated into English, Arabic, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Burmese and many other languages. He sought to revive Islam, and to propagate what he understood to be \"true Islam\". He believed that Islam was essential for politics, and that it was necessary to institute sharia and preserve Islamic culture from what he viewed as the evils of secularism, nationalism and socialism, which he understood to be the influence of Western imperialism.He was the founder of the Jamaat-e-Islami, the then largest Islamic organisation in Asia. Maududi and his followers are thought to have been the pioneers in politicizing Islam and generating support for an Islamic state in Pakistan. They are thought to have helped inspire General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq to introduce \"Sharization\" to Pakistan, and to have been greatly strengthened by him after tens of thousands of members and sympathizers were given jobs in the judiciary and civil service during his administration. He was the first recipient of the Saudi Arabian King Faisal International Award for his service to Islam in 1979. He has been the second person in history whose absentee funeral was observed in the Kaaba, succeeding King Ashama ibn-Abjar.\n\nJagadish Gupta (Bengali: জগদীশ গুপ্ত) (5 July 1886 – 15 April 1957) was an Indian poet, novelist and short story writer. Known for his realistic view of life, strange character portrayal and unique narrative style, he was one of the major exponents of modern Bengali literature. Born as Jagadish Chandra Sengupta in Kushtia, Bengal Presidency, he studied in Calcutta and later took up work as a 'job-typist' at the Judge's Court in Seuri. He also worked at Executive Engineer's office in Sambalpur, Orissa, at Patna High Court and at Bolpur Chawki Adalat as a typist. After retirement from his job, he settled in Calcutta. The Government of India granted him a 'Distinguished Man of Letters Allowance' in 1954. Gupta's stories had been published in periodicals like Bharati, Bijoli, Uttara, Kali-Kalam and Kallol. His first novel Asadhu Siddhartha was published in 1928. Some of his other notable works include Binodini, Udaylekha, Meghabrito Ashani, Dulaler Dola, Nishedher Patabhumikay, Loghu Guru etc."
