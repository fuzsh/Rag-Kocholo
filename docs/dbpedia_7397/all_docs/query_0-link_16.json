        "text": "In these stones horizons sing creating truth like glass from inspiration’s furnace.\n\n– Gwyneth Lewis\n\nPoems don’t just happen. They are luckily or stealthily related to a readiness within ourselves.\n\n– William Stafford\n\nBe a Warrior of Love, Not Hate\n\nAnd by warrior, I mean—carrier.\n\nAnd by carrier, I mean sacred guardian.\n\nAnd by sacred guardian, I mean vessel.\n\nAnd by vessel,\n\nI mean, be an instrument of love.\n\nAnd by instrument,\n\nI mean—strum, sing, play, dance, move\n\nto the melody of souls,\n\nwhich we all know how to sing.\n\nWe just seem to have forgotten the words—\n\ntoo focused on that warrior with the shield,\n\nheld up in fear of The Other.\n\nWhen we take the shield away,\n\nwhen we take the fear away,\n\nwhen we carry within our hearts,\n\nminds, bodies, and souls\n\nthe sacred gift that was give to us\n\nso many moons ago,\n\nwe are left with what we came here with—\n\nwhat we are all made of\n\nin our deepest core selves—\n\nlove.\n\n– Cristina M. R. Norcross\n\nSilence is just as likely to indicate the most profound ideas forming, the deepest energies being summoned.\n\n– Kazuo Ishiguro\n\npoetry must be made by all. not by one.\n\n– lautréamont\n\nSwerving to Miss Caterpillars\n\nIn the Autumn,\n\nwhen thirteen-segments,\n\nfat and bristled,\n\ndare the frenetic roads to find\n\ntall, dry grasses in which to sleep\n\nthemselves into something\n\nutterly different,\n\ncaterpillars can be your prayer.\n\nWhat kind of person do you\n\nchoose to be?\n\nEvery moment of every day\n\nyou have this question put before\n\nyou by everything around you.\n\nEverything.\n\nAnd, everyone.\n\nIn that instant in which you wake up,\n\nhow will\n\nyou emerge?\n\nDriving down Route 33,\n\nat this very moment,\n\nI make my choice:\n\nI choose to be the kind of person\n\nwho swerves to miss caterpillars.\n\n– Jamie K. Reaser\n\nI write with experiences in mind, but I don’t write about them, I write out of them.\n\n– John Ashbery\n\nOf all the colors, BLUE has the best songs written for it. No contest. RED and GREEN fighting for a distant second.\n\n– Mario Chard\n\nSome days I feel like an expert in a field only a few people actually care about. Other days I feel like a novice.\n\n– Timothy Green\n\nI find the entrepreneur-in-search-of-a-business-idea viscerally repulsive.\n\nIf you don’t know what your purpose in life is, maybe start there?\n\n– @VinceFHorn\n\nOne of my favorite anthropology books is the late Keith H. Basso’s, Wisdom Sits in Places. It’s a beautiful text that describes how Western Apache people consider space and place. For them, every place has a story attached to it, and that story gives that place its philosophical significance. Embedded in the story is the wisdom that that place embodies. The story is a kind of a covenant you make with the place. That place, the memory of which is preserved in stories, represents a whole set of historical events and experiences that are meaningful to that particular culture.\n\nThe same is true for Songhay people: There are certain spots in the Niger River basin that are sacred spaces. But labeling them sacred spaces is reductive; it robs them of their full significance. I make this point in much of my writing, and certainly in my new book. In many respects we have lost our ability to take the time to tell stories. In our times, we tend to reduce complexity to a series of formulae. We think we can understand something that’s partially true. But there’s an awful lot of non-Western phenomena that cannot be reduced to a formula. These are phenomena that do not lend themselves to theoretical extraction.\n\nI also think people have lost their capacity—and this is part of the ideology of explication—for experiencing the wonder of not being able to understand something, of not being able to explain things that are mysterious. For me, the experience of wonder leads us to change. It enables us to expand our imagination. It leads us to a space of creativity where we can devise things that can make life sweeter for us now and in the future. For me, the experience of the inexplicable wonders of Adam Jenitongo’s world fired my imagination, expanded my consciousness, and prompted me to try different forms (memoir and fiction) of anthropological expression.\n\nOne thing is certain: The wonders embodied in the ethnographic record make anthropologists the custodians of important insights about the human condition, insights that could help us confront the life-threatening issues that define our troubled times.\n\n– The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, and interview with Paul Stoller\n\nNorthern Lights. Something in the cold, wet atmosphere brought them out. I grabbed Lipsha’s arm. We floated into the field and sank down, crushing green wheat. We chewed the sweet grass tips and stared up and were lost. Everything seemed to be one piece. the air, our faces, all cool, moist, and dark, and the ghostly sky. Pale green likcs of light pulsed and faded across it. Living lights. their fires lobbed over, higher, higher, then died out in blackness. At times the whole sky was ringed in shooting points and puckers of light gathering and falling, pulsing, fading, rhythmical as breathing. All of a piece. As if the sky were a pattern of nerves and our thought and memories traveled across it. As if the sky were one gigantic memory for us all. Or a dance hall. And all the world’s wandering souls were dancing there. I thought of June. She would be dancing if there was a dance hall in space. she would be dancing a two-step for wandering souls. Her long legs lifting and falling. Her laugh an ace. Her sweet perfume the way all grown-up women were supposed to smell. Her amusement at both the bad and the good. Her defeat. Her reckless victory. Her sons.\n\n– Louise Erdrich, Love Medicine\n\nThere is such a thing as poetic, ecstatic truth. It is mysterious and elusive, and can be reached only through fabrication and imagination and stylization.\n\n– Werner Herzog\n\nevening star—\n\nfold upon fold\n\nthe quiet blue hills\n\n– Mary Lee McClure\n\nLawns and fields and hills and wide old velvet\n\nsleeves, green things. They stretch, fold, roll away,\n\nunfurl and calm the eye.\n\n– Anne Carson\n\nThe tranquility that comes when you stop caring what they say. Or think, or do. Only what you do.\n\n– Marcus Aurelius\n\neach time\n\nthe poem was different\n\nand the same\n\n– Laura Kerr\n\nMay my mind come alive today To the invisible geography That invites me to new frontiers, To break the dead shell of yesterdays, To risk being disturbed and changed. May I have the courage today To live the life that I would love, To postpone my dream no longer But do at last what I came here for And waste my heart on fear no more.\n\n– John O’Donohue\n\nFor example: a man arrives at the conclusion that his misery is the result of his manifestations of anger, conceit, sensuality, etc., and he will think that the cure should consist in applying himself to produce manifestations of gentleness, humility, asceticism, etc. Or perhaps another man, more intelligent this one, will come to the conclusion that his misery is a result of his mental agitation, and he will think that the cure should consist in applying himself, by such and such exercises, to the task of tranquillising his mind. One such doctrine will say to us, ‘Your misery is due to the fact that you are always desiring something, to your attachment to what you possess’, and this will result, according to the degree of intelligence of the master, in the advice to give away all your possessions, or to learn to detach yourself inwardly from the belongings that you continue to own outwardly. Another such doctrine will see the key to the man’s misery in his lack of self-mastery, and will prescribe ‘Yoga’, methods aimed at progressive training of the body, or of feelings, or of the attitude towards others, or of knowledge, or of attention. All that is, from the Zen point of view, just animal-training and leads to one kind of servitude or another (with the illusory and exalting impression of attaining freedom). At the back of all that there is the following simpleminded reasoning: ‘Things are going badly with me in such and such a way; very well, from now on I am going to do exactly the opposite.’ This way of regarding the problem, starting from a form that is judged to be bad, encloses the searcher within the limits of a domain that is formal, and, as a result deprives him of all possibility of re-establishing his consciousness beyond all form; when I am enclosed within the limits of the plane of dualism no reversal of method will deliver me from the dualistic illusion and restore me to Unity. It is perfectly analogous to the problem of ‘Achilles and the Tortoise’; the manner of posing the problem encloses it within the very limits that it is necessary to overstep, and as a result, renders it insoluble.\n\n– Hubert Benoit, The Supreme Doctrine\n\nMAGNIFIES AN OBJECT TEN TIMES\n\nis what it clearly said\n\non the handle of the magnifying glass\n\nmy father received on his fifth birthday.\n\nHe took it as a warning; the birthday gift\n\nwould only work its magic ten times\n\nand no more, becoming, after that,\n\njust a small round window with no miracle,\n\ntoy giant’s monocle, a circle of simple glass.\n\nAnd so he went about his days with curious thrift,\n\nweighing how much he needed to see any part\n\nof the world up close, observing as best he could\n\nwith his own eyes first, thinking, Do I need to see\n\nthat dead bug big? That dandelion, that blade\n\nof grass, that wriggling moth in the spider’s web?\n\nI can imagine most of nature’s gifts and crimes.\n\nBest not to waste one of my ten precious times.\n\nHe lost count of how many miracles he’d left,\n\nand for weeks after half-expected the magic of the glass\n\nto simply stop. And I have asked him to tell me\n\nof the thrilling moment he realized, or was told,\n\n“ten times” in this context simply meant tenfold\n\nand not ten instances, but he cannot remember.\n\nLikewise the joy that must have come with such\n\na limitless epiphany. But what he does recall\n\nand says most he misses still is the way the magic\n\nmade him see the world the rest of the time,\n\nnot through the glass, but all the time\n\nhe thought that magic would not last.\n\n– Taylor Mali\n\nI never find words right away. Poems for me always begin with images and rhythms, shapes, feelings, forms, dances in the back of my mind.\n\n– Gary Snyder\n\nThe desire to prevent other people from becoming conscious because one does not want to wake up oneself is real destructiveness.\n\n– Marie-Louise von Franz\n\nThere are two kinds of people in this world: those for whom BOC stands for Blue Öyster Cult and those for whom BOC stands for Boards Of Canada.\n\n– Dave Segal\n\nOne must be a sea, to receive a polluted stream without becoming impure.\n\n– Friedrich Nietzsche\n\nI can only gaze with wonder and awe at the depths and heights of our psychic nature. It’s non-spatial universe conceals an untold abundance of images which have accumulated over millions of years of living development and become fixed in the organism.\n\n– Carl Jung\n\nThe tension of the future is unbearable in us. It must break through narrow cracks, it must force new ways. You want to cast off the burden, you want to escape the inescapable.\n\n– @RedBookJung\n\nI embrace my solitude as a beautiful gift; I will become beautiful through it.\n\n– Susan Sontag\n\nThe psychological basis of the metropolitan type of individuality consists in the intensification of nervous stimulation which results from the swift and uninterrupted change of outer and inner stimuli.\n\n– Georg Simmel\n\nAbout a third of my cases are suffering from no clinically definable neurosis, but from the senselessness and emptiness of their lives. It seems to me, however, that this can well be described as the general neurosis of our time.\n\n– CG Jung\n\nI’ve been remembering the way my parents used to pepper their speech with radio catchphrases like ‘It’s agony, Ivy’ and ‘After you, Cecil’ and It’s that man again’ and I thought they were lines they’d made up.\n\n– @IMcMillan\n\nI do love you, you silly one.\n\n– Franz Kafka, 1920.\n\nThe function of the artist in a disturbed society is to give awareness of the universe, to ask the right questions, and to elevate the mind.\n\n– Marina Abramovic\n\nThe ‘real’ reader has always known that he or she must read between the lines. That is where the truth hides itself.\n\n– Lawrence Durrell\n\nA Potential For Misunderstanding\n\nby Charles Hensler\n\nEvery day you fall\n\nfrom the same bridge. Each night\n\nyou swim farther upstream.\n\nHouses and gardens in silhouette, the scent\n\nof wood smoke rising, the water heavy\n\nbetween the trees.\n\nWas that a heron or a flag pole; a shimmering\n\nwillow or someone waving from shore?\n\nIs it only the senescent light of stars\n\narriving weary, or a fragment of frozen moon?\n\nHow were you able to weather the guests\n\nwho came early, and stayed? There were too many to know—\n\ntheir urgencies and trembling hands, their clarinets\n\nthat wouldn’t play.\n\nSo far upstream in the feathered dark\n\npast the shore, the fences, the cottonwood—\n\nis the house you find the house you knew,\n\nthe light your light in the window?\n\n– Charles Hensler\n\nI think, to a poet, the human community is like the community of birds to a bird, singing to each other. Love is one of the reasons we are singing to one another, love of language itself, love of sound, love of singing itself, and love of the other birds.\n\n– Sharon Olds\n\nApology\n\nafter Edna St. Vincent Millay\n\nAnd there will always be new cold\n\non the windowsill, new gentle\n\nsplintered fingernail, the little frost.\n\nSo razor fresh. So crocus fresh.\n\nI am sorry for the iris heat of yesterday\n\nand nothing more. I mistake\n\na riverbed knuckled with fish\n\nfor something simple. I, too, will be\n\ngood. Good\n\nas the jugular’s perfect hyacinth.\n\nSmall budding. Smalling disappointments.\n\nI know. And I am not resigned.\n\n– Ahana Banerji\n\nThe Sand\n\nWe watched this kid write his name in the sand\n\non the last day we spent there together,\n\nthe way he took a stick in his hand\n\nthat some dog had been chasing forever\n\nto carefully carve out letters like quavers\n\nand semibreves in some musical score,\n\nnot thinking of water’s slow erasures\n\nas he quietly worked away at the shore.\n\nTo think we knew better in our rapport\n\nof the long year to come and what it held\n\nas if time wouldn’t give us what for\n\nwith what we imagined unparalleled.\n\nAll told, this poem’s no better than scribbling\n\non the beach, though each of us keeps singing.\n\n– Ben Wilkinson\n\n(Im)permanence\n\nI.\n\nHe said ‘you must be the only girl in the world\n\nwho gets upset whenever she’s given flowers’\n\n& I explained it’s not the bouquets that upset me,\n\nit’s what the flowers mean: they scream temporary\n\nfleeting beauty, something so flagrantly not everlasting\n\n& yet apparently symbolising your perpetual love for me.\n\nThey’re an idea of happiness that I watch die slowly, painfully,\n\nover seventy-two hours or five days or another tragic week.\n\nII.\n\nThey’re busy dying in the corner while we’re fucking,\n\ntrying to create new life of our own & failing.\n\nThose sagging lilies simply mirror my lack\n\nof fecundity. See how the soft pollen drops\n\nso easily from stamen, only to be wiped off\n\nthe tabletop, ochre dust hot on my fingertips\n\nthat I rub together cruelly, forcing hopeful spores\n\ninto a state of obliteration till there’s no hope of more\n\nlife left. The filament in every bloom: my fallopian\n\ntubes that don’t function as they’re supposed to.\n\nStigma protruding from womb, ever-present\n\neven when hidden behind the droop of exhausted petals.\n\nIII.\n\nEvery shock of colour wrapped in cellophane seems to be\n\nyou confidently saying, ‘Here is our love: dying already.’\n\nEvery artfully arranged display says, ‘The clock is ticking,’\n\nso mockingly. I smashed every vase in the house\n\n& still you offered me a gathering of already-fading pink\n\nroses in a stolen Stella Artois pint glass. I monitored them\n\n& said, ‘Why are you so intent on reminding me that\n\neveryone and everything I love always leaves me?’\n\nIV.\n\nThe symbolism I obsessed over manifested as true:\n\nsoon after another negative test, you bagged up our love\n\n& threw it out with the same ease you used to dump\n\nthose bunches of supermarket daffodils last spring:\n\nold beauty crumpled in on itself, drowned in stale water,\n\ndestined for the compost heap. At least they might\n\nregenerate one day, turn from decay to beauty again.\n\nUnlike us: dead-ended from the moment we were picked.\n\nV.\n\nYou bought me a cactus instead one day, unveiled it to me as if\n\nit were a new pet or the longed-for baby, but I still managed\n\nto murder it eventually—absent-mindedly, yes, but I killed it\n\nall the same, through a combination of subconscious spite\n\n& inevitable neglect in the bleak depressive episode\n\nthat supressed me when you left. Did I just forget\n\nto water it, or did the succulent kill itself, suicided\n\nin the knowledge that I’m not fit to be a mother?\n\nIn those days, nature served solely to remind me\n\nof everything unnatural & ugly about my body.\n\nVI.\n\nHow to pick oneself up again after so many deaths? I grieve\n\ndaily for the baby I’ll never get to meet & all of the flowers\n\nin my house now are unkillable: faux stems, plastic leaves, silk petals, forever in bloom—permanent reminders that I survived the impermanence of you.\n\n– HLR\n\nPeople aren’t going hungry because we cannot feed the poor. People are going hungry because we cannot satisfy the rich.\n\n– Mohamad Safa\n\nThe heart’s destination is that way and the path to home is this way.\n\nThere’s one face in that direction;\n\nthere’s another face in this direction.\n\n– Noshi Gilani\n\nWhere Thou art—that—is Home—\n\n– Emily Dickinson\n\nFor let us not deceive ourselves: most of the minds we associate with are housed in heads that have little more to offer than overgrown potatoes, stuck on top of whining and tastelessly clad bodies and eking out a pathetic existence that does not even merit our pity.\n\n– Thomas Bernhard\n\nNaturally, every age thinks that all ages before it were prejudiced, and today we think this more than ever and are just as wrong as all previous ages that thought so. It is sad but unfortunately true that man learns nothing from history.\n\n– CG Jung\n\nProtect the time and space in which you write. Keep everybody away from it, even the people who are most important to you.\n\n– Zadie Smith\n\nRyokou\n\nPebbled streets\n\nOf the medieval town\n\nLost their clamour\n\nTranscend dejection\n\nHistory rises from beyond\n\nTinged purple past\n\nYour own ancestors\n\nSent you on a voyage\n\nOrchids your cradle\n\nRoot oars\n\nUnder canvas\n\nSaffron winged\n\n– Andre aC Connolly\n\nWhen I awake thinking of dreams I slept on, I often wonder, if the dreams ever wake up thinking of me?\n\n– Anthony Liccione\n\nIn the beginning, practice seems to be a matter of personal will, but along the way, it clearly becomes the will of the Dharma.\n\n– Tangen Harada\n\nTrauma is so arresting that traumatized people will focus on it compulsively. Unfortunately, the situation that defeated them once will defeat them again and again.\n\n– Peter A. Levine\n\nThis desire for the end of desire, which is finally the motor force behind all metaphysics, does more than attest to an incapacity to tolerate any pleasure than that of satiety. . .\n\n– Kaja Silverman\n\nLoneliness stands on the corner\n\nwaiting for a handout.\n\nThe book of love\n\nhas all the pages torn.\n\nThe weatherman says rain today\n\nbut what does he know?\n\nWe’ll be born again like flowers,\n\nmindless as flowers,\n\nentranced by our own beauty\n\nwhile in the sepulchres of alleys\n\nthe beggar kneels\n\nbefore an altar of broken windows.\n\nHis prayers rise up\n\nlike smoke from ancient fires as\n\nalong the back streets of the heart,\n\nthe blind man taps a cosmic semaphore\n\nand all the lights in the city\n\ngo out at once.\n\n– Albert Huffstickler\n\nTime is what we want most, but what we use worst.\n\n– William Penn\n\nTo analyze creative people is a great problem because often such people think they are in a neurotic crisis but when you look at their dream material it shows that they are neurotic because they are haunted by a creative idea & should do something creative.\n\n– Marie Louise Von Franz\n\nIf you feel safe and loved, your brain becomes specialized in exploration, play, and cooperation; if you are frightened and unwanted, it specializes in managing feelings of fear and abandonment.\n\n– Bessel van der Kolk\n\nIf the masculine mind tries to live without its “other half” the feminine soul, then the masculine becomes unbalanced, sick, and finally monstrous. Power without love becomes brutality. Feeling without masculine strength becomes woolly sentimentality.\n\n– Robert A. Johnson\n\nWe are involved in a serious social revolution. By and large, American politics is dominated by politicians who build their careers on immoral compromises and ally themselves with open forms of political, economic, and social exploitation.\n\n– John Lewis, March on Washington\n\nWars are as unfortunate for the earth as they are for people.\n\n– Giacomo Sartori\n\nIt takes courage to do what you want. Other people have a lot of plans for you. Nobody wants you to do what you want to do. They want you to go on their trip, but you can do what you want. I did. I went into the woods and read for five years.\n\n– Joseph Campbell\n\nWhen we get really angry, resentful, fearful, or selfish—we start to go a little unconscious. We lose our awareness of what we’re doing with our body, speech, and mind. In this state, it’s all too easy to let ourselves spiral downward.\n\n– Pema Chödrön\n\nA writing career is a journey, not a thing with an end line. You take small steps and big steps, but there’s no “making it.” Small steps are necessary and big steps merely mark the first day of your new job/stage/chapter/whatever. That’s why the hustle never stops.\n\n– Gabino Iglesias\n\nA thoroughly good relationship with ourselves results in being still, which doesn’t mean we don’t run and jump and dance about. It means there’s no compulsiveness. We don’t overwork, overeat, oversmoke, overseduce. In short, we begin to stop causing harm.\n\n– Pema Chodron\n\nThe forest is the root of all life; it is the womb that revives our biological instincts, that deepens our intelligence and increases our sensitivity as human beings.\n\n– Akira Miyawaki\n\nOne of the great strengths of the inner feminine is the ability to let go, to give up ego control, to stop trying to control the people and the situation, to turn the situation over to fate and wait on the natural flow of the universe.\n\n– Robert A. Johnson, We\n\nAnswers tell us where we’ve been. Questions get us on our journey, and I’ve often said to people in psychoanalysis, “This is not about curing you because you’re not a disease, you’re a process. This is about making your life more interesting to you—a life full of adventure, a life full of daily choices that create and express your values.\n\n– James Hollis\n\nI shall live badly if I do not write, and I shall write badly if I do not live.\n\n– Françoise Sagan\n\nSo that’s another thing poetry allows me. It allows me to deal with being an artist of many backgrounds and to hold great complexity in my very being.\n\n– Jericho Brown\n\nGenuinely experiencing a sense of hopelessness does not lead to despair; it gives rise directly to trust in oneself.\n\n– Chögyam Trungpa\n\nI didn’t put so much energy into healing to be happy all of the time, I know that’s not realistic.\n\nI do it so that I can face the down moments with more ease and so that I can remember that no heavy mood is going to last forever.\n\n– yung pueblo\n\nBuddhism, being nontheistic, does not hold out any promises of divine grace or supernatural interventions.\n\n– Chögyam Trungpa\n\nAn old idea suggests that each person comes to life at a time when they have something to give to the world. That sense of soulful giving may be more needed now than ever before, as the world needs genuine vision as well as great imagination to initiate meaningful changes in all areas of culture and nature. Strangely, it tends to be the orphaned and neglected parts of our souls that are the least known but can become most able to see what is needed on all levels of life.\n\n– Michael Meade\n\nWhoever ‘you’ are, you are placed at the beginning and end of the poem…\n\n– Economy of the Unlost, Anne Carson\n\nI write poetry to remember I am alive, that we are alive, and to feel the air around us.\n\n– Maureen N. McLane\n\nIn the end a person must lose that which is most precious, that to which one’s whole life has been devoted. The treasure is consciousness; it is the ego’s final sacrifice to the Self.\n\n– June Singer\n\nSaṃsāra in itself is just deluded thought.\n\nAnd when the nature of the mind is seen,\n\nIt is nirvāṇa—there from the beginning.\n\nIt is primal wisdom, free of all fixation,\n\nThat, in self-knowing, knows its object.\n\n– Longchenpa\n\nThis is where the poem holds its breath, where the usable truth sways, sorrowing,\n\nand the people sway with the truth of it, and this is where the poem enters the dark.\n\n– Maureen Seaton\n\nEven the most beautiful scenery is no longer assured of our love after we have lived in it for three months, and some distant coast attracts our avarice: possessions are generally diminished by possession.\n\n– Friedrich Nietzsche\n\nWhen art becomes intense, loneliness emerges, clarity emerges, strangeness emerges. If it doesn’t go that far, it’s a lie. My past writing has been like wine, and not even the best wine. But from now on it will be like water – clear, bright, and rippling without overflowing – or so I hope.\n\n– Santoka\n\nBegin to weave and the\n\nDivine will provide\n\nthe Thread.\n\n– Old Proverb\n\nIt’s all in the ear.\n\n– William Carlos Williams\n\nIf you fell down yesterday, stand up today.\n\n– H. G. Wells\n\nAs the years go by, I’m less and less convinced that technology will present answers to the climate crisis. To me, it’s not fast enough and not more significant than community building or education. Yet, tech continues to receive billions of dollars in funding. Why?\n\n– Isaias Hernandez\n\nPeople who are given the resources, time, & space to take care of themselves —who aren’t just told “take care of yourself” & given more to do with less —tend to be more productive for longer.\n\nAlso, reciprocity is probably the most important part of the social contract.\n\n– @agnesbookbinder\n\nWe who choose to surround ourselves with lives even more temporary than our own live within a fragile circle, easily and often breached.\n\nUnable to accept its awful gaps, we still would live no other way.\n\n– Irving Townshend\n\nNature isn’t classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you’d better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly it’s a wonderful problem, because it doesn’t look so easy.\n\n– Richard Feynman\n\nThe world spectator is emphatically a desiring subject. He has done more than accede to lack; he has learned to take pleasure in his own insatiability.\n\n– Kaja Silverman\n\nSinging Everything – Joy Harjo\n\nOnce there were songs for everything,\n\nSongs for planting, for growing, for harvesting,\n\nFor eating, getting drunk, falling asleep,\n\nFor sunrise, birth, mind-break, and war.\n\nFor death (those are the heaviest songs and they\n\nHave to be pried from the earth with shovels of grief)\n\nNow all we hear are falling-in-love songs and\n\nFalling apart after falling in love songs.\n\nThe earth is leaning sideways\n\nAnd a song is emerging from the floods\n\nAnd fires. Urgent tendrils lift toward the sun.\n\nYou must be friends with silence to hear.\n\nThe songs of the guardians of silence are the most powerful—\n\nThey are the most rare.\n\nThe Battles of the Pen and the Scissors (Excerpt)\n\nWriter, you hold a flame in your hand,\n\nor is it the blade of a sword or a spear–\n\nthe tree of knowledge of good and evil,\n\nor a staff to make wondrous signs appear?\n\nAre there words enough in all of song\n\nto praise the pen? Who else could bear\n\nthe burden of bringing back the past\n\nand preserving it then as though with myrrh?\n\nIt has no ear with which it might hear,\n\nor mouth with which to offer answers,\n\nand yet the pen, in a single stroke,\n\nat once does both—observes and remembers.\n\nAt night he says “Tomorrow I’ll write,”\n\nbut there nothing at all to back up his words;\n\nthe heaven’s frost caught in his face,\n\nand the cackling of mocking ice is heard.\n\nDon’t pride yourself on tomorrow’s prize,\n\nwhen you have no notion of what it hides.\n\n– Shem Tov Ardutiel (pen name Santob De Carrion)\n\nZarathustra says to go back to the body, go into the body, and then everything will be right, for there the greatest intelligence is hidden.\n\n– CG Jung\n\nLife is pure adventure, and the sooner we realize that, the quicker we will be able to treat life as art.\n\n– Maya Angelou\n\nI feel full of poetry, strong poetry, simple, fantastic, religious, bad, deep, wicked, mystical.\n\nEverything, everything, I want to be all things.\n\n– Federico García Lorca\n\nLoneliness is necessary for pure poetry. When someone intrudes into the poet’s life, the poet loses his or her balance for a moment. The person who writes the poetry emerges, tentatively, like a hermit crab from a conch shell.\n\n– Jack Spicer\n\nDon’t be seduced into thinking that that which does not make a profit is without value.\n\n– Arthur Miller\n\nBe yourself. The world worships the original.\n\n– Ingrid Bergman\n\nBe honest, frank and fearless… Read some good, heavy, serious books just for discipline: Take yourself in hand and master yourself.\n\n– W.E.B. Du Bois\n\nThe way in which I am being destroyed—\n\nThose who see—rub their hands in envy.\n\n– Jaun Eliya\n\nIn the Old Testament, religious intolerance manifested itself primarily in an abhorrence of images. The word idol comes from the Latin idolum, which in turn derives from the Greek word for image, eidolon.\n\n– Leonard Shlain\n\nand the universe splits open for one poem—\n\nthe way a life lived calls on us to praise it.\n\n– Maureen Seaton\n\nI sometimes longed for someone who, like me, had not adjusted perfectly with his age, and such a person was hard to find; but I soon discovered cats, in which I could imagine a condition like mine, and books, where I found it quite often.\n\n– Julio Cortazar\n\nIn the course of analysis the ego changes its standpoint. It finds a broader context. The personal, the contemporary, relates to a the larger perspective if large enough, the perspective of eternity.\n\n– Edward Edinger\n\na bonfire\n\non a summer night\n\nat the edge of the ocean\n\n– Buson\n\nAnd a verse every night\n\nUnfolding from the wisdom of your absence.\n\n– Hilda Hilst\n\nThe development of Western philosophy during the last two centuries has succeeded in isolating the mind in its own sphere and in severing it from its primordial oneness with the universe.\n\n– CG Jung\n\nSince universities are collapsing, should we bring back monasteries as centres of knowledge?\n\n– @DuncanAStuart\n\nIn Buddhist terms, our worth is a product of our ability to choose between right and wrong, between truth and delusion—and these are consequential choices. We know the difference between wholesome and unwholesome acts, and we know that our actions have consequences.\n\n– Sallie Jiko Tisdale\n\nI still love books where nothing happens, / good or bad. The page is one landscape I move through.\n\n– Derrick Austin\n\nIt is perfectly possible — indeed, it is far from uncommon — to go to bed one night, or wake up one morning, or simply walk through a door one has known all one’s life, and discover, between inhaling and exhaling, that the self one has sewn together with such effort is all dirty rags, is unusable, is gone: and out of what raw material will one build a self again? The lives of men — and, therefore, of nations — to an extent literally unimaginable, depend on how vividly this question lives in the mind. It is a question which can paralyze the mind, of course; but if the question does not live in the mind, then one is simply condemned to eternal youth, which is a synonym for corruption.\n\n– James Baldwin\n\nPeople are always angry at anyone who chooses very individual standards for his life; because of the extraordinary treatment which that man grants to himself, they feel degraded, like ordinary beings.\n\n– Nietzsche\n\nThe End of August\n\nI am overtired Of the great harvest I myself desired. – Robert Frost\n\nIt’s the end of August and I’m tired. The garden is tired. The grass is tired. Everything is tired. We’ve all had too much summer. Bring on the cold. Bring on the frost. Bring on all that death and destruction. Let’s have some quiet and some peace. Let us rest. Give us emptiness.\n\n– David Budbill\n\nWhen some of the people who speak publicly on existential risks tell us it’s not too late” we should always ask: It’s not too late for what and for whom.\n\n– Jem Bendell\n\nWe have to do it all at once. End racial injustice. End planetary extraction. Help each other, turn to one another. Learn to practice peace. Repair and regenerate. The wall and barricades are false solutions.\n\n– Dr. Elizabeth Sawin\n\nClarification of terms, with appreciation:\n\nBoycott is when you remove your consumption.\n\nStrike is when you remove your labor.\n\nVote is when you remove your GOP.\n\n– Ethan Nichtern\n\nTimes are difficult globally; awakening is no longer a luxury or an ideal. It’s becoming critical. We don’t need to add more depression, more discouragement, or more anger to what’s already here. It’s becoming essential that we learn how to relate sanely with difficult times. The earth seems to be beseeching us to connect with joy and discover our innermost essence. This is the best way that we can benefit others.\n\n– Pema Chodron\n\n…in Dagara life, the first few years of a child’s life is spent with the grandparents, not the parents. What the grandparents and grandchildren share together … that the parents do not … is their close proximity to the cosmos. Grandparents will soon return to where the grandchildren came from, so therefore the grandchild is the bearer of news the grandparents need. The grandparents must get this information before the child forgets.\n\n– Malidoma Some\n\nWe require from buildings two kinds of goodness: first, the doing their practical duty well: then that they be graceful and pleasing in doing it.\n\n– John Ruskin\n\nIt is easier to tell a story of how people wound one another than of what binds them together.\n\n– Anne Carson, Plainwater\n\nCity\n\nI looked at the city\n\nand smiled\n\nand walked in\n\nwho would ever want to live here\n\nI wondered\n\nand never went back.\n\n– Mangalesh Dabral\n\nThe way a tree grows around its past contributes to its exquisite individuality, character & beauty. I certainly don’t advocate traumatization to build character, but since trauma is almost a given at some point in our lives, the image of the tree can be a valuable mirror.\n\n– Peter A. Levine\n\nBut memory has no memory. Or metaphor.\n\nIt moves as it wants to move,\n\nand never measures the distance.\n\n– Charles Wright\n\nDeep in the wintry parts of our minds, we are hardy stock and know there is no such thing as a work-free transformation. We know that we will have to burn to the ground in one way or another, and then sit right in the ashes of who we once thought we were and go on from there.\n\n– Dr. Clarissa Pinkola Estés\n\nHe’ll never be frightened. He knows too damn much.\n\n– Ernest Hemingway\n\nHalf-hearted,\n\ninsincere\n\nand disassociated\n\nbut longing to be\n\nwholly present.\n\nThis is faith, too.\n\n– Justin McRoberts\n\nWe now know that human transformation does not happen through didacticism or through excessive certitude, but through the playful entertainment of another scripting of reality that may subvert the old given text and its interpretation and lead to the embrace of an alternative text and its redescription of reality.\n\n– Walter Brueggemann\n\nHonour this place of not-knowing.\n\nBow before this bubbling mess of creativity.\n\nSink into wonderment.\n\nBefriend the very place where you sit or stand.\n\nDo not label this place ‘indecision’ or ‘inaction’.\n\nIt is more alive than that, more active.\n\nIt is the place where possibilities grow.\n\nIt is the place where uncertainty is sacred,\n\nand the place where answers will emerge.\n\nThere is courage in staying close.\n\nThere is strength in not knowing…\n\n– Jeff Foster\n\nIt has seemed to me sometimes as though the Lord breathes on this poor gray ember of Creation and it turns to radiance—for a moment or a year or the span of a life. And then it sinks back into itself again, and to look at it no one would know it had anything to do with fire, or light. That is what I said in the Pentecost sermon. I have reflected on that sermon, and there is some truth in it. But the Lord is more constant and far more extravagant than it seems to imply. Wherever you turn your eyes the world can shine like transfiguration. You don’t have to bring a thing to it except a little willingness to see. Only, who could have the courage to see it?\n\n– Marilynne Robinson\n\nWe are living in the time of the parenthesis, the time between eras. It is as though we have bracketed off the present from both the past and the future, for we are neither here nor there … but we have not embraced the future either. We have done the human thing: We are clinging to the known past in fear of the unknown future.\n\n– John Naisbitt\n\nThere’s always been a struggle between art and commerce, but now I’m telling you art is getting its ass kicked, and it’s making us mean, and it’s making us bitchy, and it’s making us cheap punks and that’s not who we are.\n\n– Aaron Sorkin\n\nEarthing\n\nby Billy Collins\n\nYou have probably come across\n\nthose scales in planetariums\n\nthat tell you how much you\n\nwould weigh on other planets.\n\nYou have noticed the fat ones\n\nlingering on the Mars scale\n\nand the emaciated slowing up\n\nthe line for Neptune.\n\nAs a creature of average weight.\n\nI fail to see the attraction.\n\nImagine squatting in the wasteland\n\nOf Pluto, all five tons of you,\n\nor wandering around Mercury\n\nwondering what to do next with your ounce.\n\nHow much better to step onto\n\nthe simple bathroom scale,\n\na happy earthing feeling\n\nthe familiar ropes of gravity,\n\n157 pounds standing soaking wet\n\na respectful distance from the scale\n\nThe Widening Sky\n\nby Edward Hirsch\n\nI am so small walking on the beach\n\nat night under the widening sky.\n\nThe wet sand quickens beneath my feet\n\nand the waves thunder against the shore.\n\nI am moving away from the boardwalk\n\nwith its colorful streamers of people\n\nand the hotels with their blinking lights.\n\nThe wind sighs for hundreds of miles.\n\nI am disappearing so far into the dark\n\nI have vanished from sight.\n\nI am a tiny seashell\n\nthat has secretly drifted ashore\n\nand carries the sound of the ocean\n\nsurging through its body.\n\nI am so small now no one can see me.\n\nHow can I be filled with such a vast love?\n\nAfter I Came Back From Iceland\n\nby Sheenagh Pugh\n\nAfter I came back from Iceland,\n\nI couldn’t stop talking. It was the light,\n\nyou see, the light and the air. I tried to put it\n\ninto poems, even, but you couldn’t write\n\nthe waterfall on White River, blinding\n\nand glacial, nor the clean toy town\n\nwith the resplendent harbour for its glass.\n\nYou couldn’t write how the black lava shone,\n\nnor how the outlines of the bright red roofs\n\ncut the sky sharp as a knife: how breathing\n\nwas like drinking cold water. When I got back\n\nto Heathrow and walked out into Reading,\n\nI damn near choked on this warm gritty stuff\n\nI called air; also on the conjecture\n\nthat we’d all settle for second best\n\nonce we’d forgotten there was something more.\n\nA sense of de-familiarization is a recurring feature of spiritual life, and it can come to us in many ways—in art, in travel, in practice. However it comes, it offers an opportunity for openness and intimacy, both, if one can allow oneself to fall into them.\n\n– Henry Shukman, Far from Home\n\nI Watch People In The World\n\nI watch people in the world\n\nThrow away their lives lusting after things,\n\nNever able to satisfy their desires,\n\nFalling into deeper despair\n\nAnd torturing themselves.\n\nEven if they get what they want\n\nHow long will they be able to enjoy it?\n\nFor one heavenly pleasure\n\nThey suffer ten torments of hell,\n\nBinding themselves more firmly to the grindstone.\n\nSuch people are like monkeys\n\nFrantically grasping for the moon in the water\n\nAnd then falling into a whirlpool.\n\nHow endlessly those caught up in the floating world suffer.\n\nDespite myself, I fret over them all night\n\nAnd cannot staunch my flow of tears.\n\n– Taigu Ryokan, trans. John Stephens\n\nWe all are born whole but somehow the culture demands that we live out only part of our nature and refuse other parts of our inheritance.\n\n– Robert A. Johnson\n\nwith nowhere to perch\n\nin the middle of a field\n\na bird sings\n\n– Basho\n\nWe could say that only an overwhelmingly strong emotional experience can interrupt our relation to the comfort of the times to the point where we are forced to look inside ourselves.\n\n– J. Gary Sparks\n\nWhen they dig our poems up out of the rubble, we want them to know who we were, what consciousness was, but also how astounding and unimaginably infinite and mysterious life was.\n\n– Jorie Graham\n\nWhatever the shape of the distinct, multifarious display,\n\nIts reality is self-sprung emanation, magical projection,\n\nAnd it never strays from the nonaction of the All-Good.\n\n– Longchenpa\n\nIndividuals must become both more united and increasingly different\n\n– Guattari\n\nparley in Milton Keynes\n\nan agreement\n\nhas been brokered\n\nbetween The Teens\n\nand The Old Folks:\n\nboth parties affirmed\n\nthe need for soft shoes\n\n28.VIII.23\n\n– Alec Finlay (dailies)\n\nPoems do begin with my life, my body, my mess of unfiltered emotional ongoingness & that material are the bones of the poems. The poems themselves, however, always feel larger than me. They flesh out into real other beings and walk around in the world without me.\n\n– Ada Limón\n\nI have attained three supreme mystical powers. I am going to teach them to you, if you are ready. These siddhis overcome all obstacles, stun all enemies, and open all the portals to the Infinite. Normally I would keep them a secret, only for the initiated, but because we are nearing the collapse of the empire, I must share them with you in hopes that you will use them as talismans for your journey. These three mystical powers have been hidden for thousands of years in the monasteries of the Himalayas, but they must now be revealed. Of course, you received these secret initiations when you were a baby in the crib, goo-gooing, burbing and farting, muttering “Ga!” “Hu!” “Mama!” “Bha!” and other bija mantras of supreme wisdom. But you exchanged your radiance for an education. Now you must be re-initiated.\n\n1. First, whenever you are sad or angry or confused, take it as a sign to abandon your mind. Sink down into your body. Feel your heart-beat. Just stop whining, fall down, and enter your heart-beat.\n\n2. Don’t take your next breath, receive it.\n\n3. When you’ve fallen into your heart-beat and realized that every breath is a gift to be received, not taken, then offer the gift back to the Giver, slowly breathe out, and listen.\n\nListen to what? Between breathing out and breathing in, listen to the quietest most distant sound. Just for a moment. This moment is an eternal door. This door is in the center of your chest, between going and coming, between beats, where there is no journey, no thought, no “I.” Listen to what? Listen to the space beyond the faintest sound. Listen to the vibrating aliveness of listening itself. Listen to the symphony of your flesh, the chorus of electrons, the song of distant stars falling into the neurons of your solar plexus. Drown in the hum of silence. Now you must pay me. Here is your initiation fee. Because if you don’t pay me, the mystical power of these secret techniques will not be activated. OK? So please send me tidal waves of compassion. Forgive me for ever having imagined there was anything to learn but listening, pulsation, and friendship with your own heart.\n\n– Fred LaMotte\n\nYou live like this, sheltered, in a delicate world, and you believe you are living. Then you read a book… or you take a trip… and you discover that you are not living, that you are hibernating. The symptoms of hibernating are easily detectable: first, restlessness. The second symptom (when hibernating becomes dangerous and might degenerate into death): absence of pleasure. That is all. It appears like an innocuous illness. Monotony, boredom, death. Millions live like this (or die like this) without knowing it. They work in offices. They drive a car. They picnic with their families. They raise children. And then some shock treatment takes place, a person, a book, a song, and it awakens them and saves them from death. Some never awaken.\n\n– Anaïs Nin\n\ncolonialism is primarily an economic domination…For this very reason…the first objective of our resistance…is to liberate our land economically, although beforehand we have to pass through political liberation.\n\n– Amilcar Cabral\n\nIt is devastating, all this blinding ideology. Politics and religion and fear make people do crazy things….as well as turn a blind eye to others who are behaving in disturbing ways. It is disturbing.\n\n– Kent Burgess\n\nDear Child of God, you are loved with a love that nothing can shake, a love that loved you long before you were created, a love that will be there long after everything has disappeared. You are precious, with a preciousness that is totally quite immeasurable. And God wants you to be like God. Filled with life and goodness and laughter – and joy.\n\nGod, who is forever pouring out God’s whole being from all eternity, wants you to flourish. God wants you to be filled with joy and excitement and ever longing to be able to find what is so beautiful in God’s creation: the compassion of so many, the caring, the sharing.\n\nAnd God says, Please, my child, help me. Help me to spread love and laughter and joy and compassion. And you know what, my child? As you do this – hey, presto – you discover joy. Joy, which you had not sought, comes as the gift, as almost the reward for this non-self-regarding caring for others.\n\n– Archbishop Desmond Tutu\n\nThe witch-burnings did not take place during the ‘Dark Ages,’ as we commonly suppose. They occurred between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries– precisely during and following the Renaissance, that glorious period when, as we are taught, ‘men’s’ minds were being freed from bleakness and superstition. While Michelangelo was sculpting and Shakespeare writing, the witches were burning. The whole secular ‘Enlightenment,’ in fact, the male professions of doctor, lawyer, judge, artist, all rose from the ashes of the destroyed women’s culture. Renaissance men were celebrating naked female beauty in their art, while women’s bodies were being tortured and burned by the hundreds of thousands all around them.\n\n– Monica Sjöö & Barbara Mor\n\nWhen someone goes to the theater, to a concert or to a party of any kind, if the party is to his liking, he immediately remembers and regrets that the people he wants are not there.” ‘What my sister, my father, would like this,’ he thinks, and no longer enjoys the show but through a mild melancholy. This is the melancholy that I feel, not for the people of my house, which would be small and bad, but for all creatures that for lack of means and for their misfortune do not enjoy the supreme good of beauty which is life and is goodness and is serenity and it is passion. That’s why I never own a book, because I gift how many I buy, which are infinite, and that’s why I’m here honored and pleased to inaugurate this people’s library, the first surely in the whole province of Granada.\n\nMan doesn’t only live on bread. I, if I was hungry and disabled on the street, I would not ask for a bread; but I would ask for half a loaf and a book. And I attack from here violently those who only talk about economic claims without ever naming the cultural claims which is what the peoples ask for screamingly. It’s good for all men to eat, but for all men to know. Let them enjoy all the fruits of the human spirit because otherwise is to make them Civil service machines, is to make them slaves to a terrible social organization.\n\nI have much more shame for a man who wants to know and can’t, than for a hungry man. For a hungry man can easily quench his hunger with a loaf of bread or some fruit, but a man who is eager to know and has no means, suffers terrible agony because it is books, books, many books that he needs and where are those books?\n\nBooks ! Books ! Make here a magic word equivalent to saying: ‘love, love’, and that peoples should ask as they ask for bread or as they long for rain for their seedlings. When insignificant Russian writer Fedor Dostoyevsky, father of the Russian Revolution much more than Lenin, he was imprisoned in Siberia, far from the world, between four walls and surrounded by desolate infinite snow plains; and he called for help in a letter to his distant family, he only said: ‘Send me books, books, many.’ books so my soul does not die! ’. I was cold and did not ask for fire, I was terribly thirsty and did not ask water: I asked for books, that is, horizons, that is, stairs to climb the summit of the spirit and heart. Because the physical, biological, natural agony of a body by hunger, thirst or cold, lasts little, very little, but the agony of the unsatisfied soul lasts a lifetime.\n\nThe great Menéndez Pidal, one of Europe’s most true wise men, has already said that the motto of the Republic should be: ‘Culture’. Culture because only through it can be solved the problems in which the people are debated today full of faith, but lacking light.\n\n– Federico Garcia\n\nA page, turning, is a wing lifted with no twin, and therefore no flight. And yet we are moved.\n\n– Ocean Vuong\n\nEven if one is the most sinful of all sinners, one shall yet cross over the ocean of sin by the raft of self-knowledge alone. As the blazing fire reduces wood to ashes, similarly, the fire of Self-knowledge reduces all bonds of karma to ashes…\n\n– Krishna, Bhagavad Gita\n\nLet us start a better life.\n\n– Franz Kafka, 1912.\n\nThere is not a more repulsive spectacle than on old man who will not forsake the world, which has already forsaken him.\n\n– T. S. Eliot\n\nI don’t envision a single thing that, when undeveloped, leads to such great harm as the mind. The mind, when undeveloped, leads to great harm.\n\n– Thanissaro Bhikkhu\n\nIf the emergent God that wants to be born in man is not humanized and transformed by a sufficient number of conscious individuals, its dark aspect can destroy us.\n\n– Edward Edinger\n\nI hear, my dear boy, that you, too, are busying yourself with art. There is nothing more divine. And nothing simpler. Yet, why is it so difficult? Every first move, everything unwilled, is beautiful, but once self-conscious, it all becomes crooked and perverse.\n\n– Kleist to Ruhle\n\nThe Holy Ghost, the autonomous transpersonal spirit that connects man with God, has been lost by modem man. Like the Gnostic Sophia, it has fallen into the darkness of matter.\n\n– Edward Edinger\n\nStuart Hall said, “The task of socialism is to meet people where they are, where they are touched, bitten, moved, frustrated, nauseated—to develop discontent,” and that a socialist movement “must be developed in cultural and social terms, as well as in economic and political.”\n\nIf I make another mistake, it will be the last– for then I will despise either my soul or the earth, and I will separate them.\n\n– Kleist in Paris\n\nWe are citizens of two realms, we all must sustain a dual allegiance: we sense the ineffable in one realm, we name and exploit reality in another.\n\n– Abraham Joshua Heschel\n\nThe modern notion of a philosopher is that of an academic, dry-as-dust rationalist. The early tradition of philosophy was anything but that. Philosophers were visionaries, quite similar to the great Hebrew prophets.\n\n– Edward Edinger\n\nAny writer is always trying to get better, trying to push out of their own comfort zones. Of course I want to focus on the musicality of the line, the work of the metaphor, the thematic resonance, but above all, I am interested in writing something that matters.\n\n– Ada Limón\n\nIn this field cows made\n\nTheir own path; here they come now,\n\nThis summer evening\n\n– @hoshigenari\n\nDo not laugh at a blind man,\n\nnor tease a dwarf,\n\nnor cause hardship for the lame.\n\nDon’t tease a man\n\nwho is in the hand of the god (i.e. insane)\n\n– fragment from ancient Egyptian papyrus, dated to around the time of Amenhotep III\n\nShakyamuni did not dedicate his life simply to helping us to become completely enlightened & to escape the world of karma & rebirth.

Flowers took his hat\n\nAnd bore him off to introduce him to the tongs;\n\nThe demon’s false nose made the table laugh; a cat\n\nSoon had him waltzing madly, let him squeeze her hand;\n\nWords pushed him to the piano to sing comic songs;\n\nAnd children swarmed to him like settlers. He became a land.\n\nThe Birds\n\nby Linda Pastan\n\nThe Birds\n\nare heading south, pulled\n\nby a compass in the genes.\n\nThey are not fooled\n\nby this odd November summer,\n\nthough we stand in our doorways\n\nwearing cotton dresses.\n\nWe are watching them\n\nas they swoop and gather–\n\nthe shadow of wings\n\nfalls over the heart.\n\nWhen they rustle among\n\nthe empty branches, the trees\n\nmust think their lost leaves\n\nhave come back.\n\nThe birds are heading south,\n\ninstinct is the oldest story.\n\nThey fly over their doubles,\n\nthe mute weathervanes,\n\nteaching all of us\n\nwith their tailfeathers\n\nthe true north.\n\nAt Once I Was Irish, At Least\n\nby Thomas Whitehead\n\nThere was no one with me, so\n\nI took my hot baked potato\n\nand while I ate the other\n\nportions of my uncomplicated dinner,\n\nheld the potato inside my jacket\n\nand right over my heart,\n\nand you should know, before\n\nwe part, how I was better for it.\n\nInsomnia by Linda Pastan\n\nI remember when by body\n\nwas a friend.\n\nwhen sleep like a good dog\n\ncame when summoned.\n\nThe door to the future\n\nhad not started to shut,\n\nand lying on my back\n\nbetween cold sheets\n\ndid not feel\n\nlike a rehearsal.\n\nNow what light is left\n\ncomes up—a stain in the east,\n\nand sleep, reluctant\n\nas a busy doctor,\n\ngives me a little\n\nof its time.\n\nThe Makers\n\nWho can remember back to the first poets, The greatest ones, greater even than Orpheus? No one has remembered that far back Or now considers, among the artifacts And bones and cantilevered inference The past is made of, those first and greatest poets, So lofty and disdainful of renown They left us not a name to know them by. They were the ones that in whatever tongue Worded the world, that were the first to say Star, water, stone, that said the visible And made it bring invisibles to view In wind and time and change, and in the mind Itself that minded the hitherto idiot world And spoke the speechless world and sang the towers Of the city into the astonished sky. They were the first great listeners, attuned To interval, relationship, and scale, The first to say above, beneath, beyond, Conjurors with love, death, sleep, with bread and wine, Who having uttered vanished from the world Leaving no memory but the marvelous Magical elements, the breathing shapes And stops of breath we build our Babels of.\n\n– Howard Nemerov\n\nWhen word gets around that you can listen\n\nwhen others tend to talk,\n\npeople will treat you as a sage.\n\n– Ed Koch\n\nMost readers are looking for books similar to ones they’ve already read and loved, so it’s smart to familiarize yourself with other titles out there that could be comparative to yours.\n\n– Brooke Warner\n\nIn solitude we find ourselves; we prepare ourselves to come to conversation with something to say that is authentic, ours. If we can’t gather ourselves, we can’t recognize other people for who they are. If we are not content to be alone, we turn others into the people we need them to be. If we don’t know how to be alone, we’ll only know how to be lonely.\n\n– Sherry Turkle\n\nBeing habitually angry . . . undermines your trust. First of all, it’s hard to trust yourself. At some level you’re aware that your aggression could bring you down at any moment. And since you can’t trust yourself, it’s hard to trust anyone else. Because your own mind is unreliable, everyone else seems unreliable as well. You are highly susceptible to paranoia. You don’t know who will stick by you, who will be there in your time of need, and who will let you down or betray you.\n\n– Dzigar Kongtrul, Peaceful Heart\n\nI never found a genuine way\n\nto heal until I was genuinely\n\nrooting for everybody’s healing,\n\nincluding the people whose poor\n\ndecisions I was healing from.\n\n– Andrea Gibson\n\nTo refuse to participate in the shaping of our future is to give it up. Do not be misled into passivity either by false security (they don’t mean me) or by despair (there’s nothing we can do). Each of us must find our work and do it.\n\n– Audre Lorde\n\nMost of the living aren’t plodding through zombie routines but are enthusiastically engaged in adventurous interplay, as well as the learning and satisfaction that ensues. Even a simple game can become so absorbing that one is fully present in the here and now, which helps us concentrate on pursuing a goal for a long time. As Albert Einstein says, “Play is the highest form of research.”\n\n– George Gorman\n\nAwareness practice is not just sitting meditation or meditation-in-action alone. It is a unique training practice in how to behave as an inspired human being.

The more I try to be honest, the farther my words sink into darkness.\n\n– Murakami\n\nThe crossroads represents a place where consciousness is crossed by the unconscious in other words, a place where you have to surrender your ego will to a higher will.\n\n– Marion Woodman\n\nThis naturally present pristine cognition, the ultimate truth of the naturally pure expanse, is the original abiding nature of all things, and it is the pristine cognition to be experienced by individual intuitive awareness.\n\n– Dudjom Rinpoche\n\ni went into a bookstore. i began to count the books there to read and the years i’m left to live. i won’t last for half of it! surely there must be other ways to save a person, otherwise i’m lost.\n\n– almada negreiros\n\nYou were a town with one pay phone and someone else was using it.\n\n– Kim Addonizio\n\nThe unpardonable sin, in Campbell’s book, was the sin of inadvertence, of not being alert, not quite awake.\n\n– Bill Moyers\n\nPeople have gotten used to living a botched-up life – to be anxious, insecure, hateful, jealous, and in various states of unpleasantness through the day – slowly humanity has begun to see it as normal. None of these things are normal. These are abnormalities. Once you accept them as part of life they become normal because the majority has joined the gang of unpleasantness. They are all saying, “Unpleasantness is normal. Being nasty to each other is normal. Being nasty to myself is normal.” Someone trusted that you would be doing good things at least to yourself and said, “Do unto others what you do unto yourself.” I am telling you, never do unto others what you are doing to yourself! By being with people, I know what they are doing to themselves is the worst thing. Fortunately, they are not doing such horrible things to others. Only once in a while they are giving a dose to others, but to themselves they are giving it throughout the day.\n\n– Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev\n\nTHE GIFT\n\nBe still, my soul, and steadfast.\n\nEarth and heaven both are still watching\n\nthough time is draining from the clock\n\nand your walk, that was confident and quick,\n\nhas become slow.\n\nSo, be slow if you must, but let\n\nthe heart still play its true part.\n\nLove still as once you loved, deeply\n\nand without patience.

You’ve been left out.\n\nYou shall no longer share the bright moon\n\nnor the slow gardens. There is no one anymore\n\nmoon not a mirror of the past,\n\nglass of solitude, sun of agonies.\n\nGoodbye the mutual hands and the sighs\n\nthat brought love closer. Today you only have\n\nthe faithful memory and the deserted days.\n\nNobody Loses (repeat emptiness)\n\nbut which have not and have not had\n\nNever, but not enough to be brave\n\nto learn the art of forgetting.\n\nA symbol, a rose, it tears you apart\n\nand he can kill you a guitar.\n\nI won’t be happy anymore. Maybe it doesn’t matter.\n\nThere are so many other things in the world;\n\nany instant is deeper\n\nand different than the sea. Life is short\n\nand though the hours are so long, a\n\ndark wonder is haunting us,\n\ndeath, that other sea, that other arrow\n\nthat delivers us from the sun and the moon\n\nand of love. The bliss you gave me\n\nand you removed me must be erased;\n\nwhat was everything must be nothing.\n\nI only have the joy of being sad,\n\nthat vanity habit that bends me\n\nto the south, at a certain door, at a certain corner.\n\n– Jorge Luis Borge\n\nModern mind has become more and more calculating. .. Only money economy has filled the days of so many people with weighing, calculating, with numerical determinations, with a reduction of qualitative values to quantitative ones.\n\n– Georg Simmel, The Metropolis and Mental Life\n\nAll of us are in some sort of theatre that we create for ourselves\n\n– Werner Herzog\n\nThe only writers who have any peace are the ones who don’t write. And there are some like that. They wallow in a sea of possibilities. To express a thought, you first have to limit it, and that means kill it. Every word I speak robs me of a thousand others, and every line I write means giving up another.\n\n– Stanisław Lem\n\nI like Simone Weil’s idea that writing is actually the translation of a text we already carry within us. That notion makes a heavy task lighter. In fact, though, writing is the backbreaking work of hacking a footpath, as in a coal mine; in total darkness, beneath the earth. In poetry there are moments of illumination. A streak of light falls in the dark corridor, then the darkness slams shut overhead once more. In prose the darknesses are even thicker, the black clods even harder.\n\n– Anna Kamienska\n\nIf we think about what it means to “concentrate” or “pay attention” at an individual level, it implies alignment: different parts of the mind and even the body acting in concert and oriented toward the same thing. To pay attention to one thing is to resist paying attention to other things; it meant constantly denying and thwarting provocations outside the sphere of one’s attention. We contrast this with distraction, in which the mind is disassembled, pointing in many different directions at once and preventing meaningful action. It seems the same is true on a collective level. Just as it takes alignment for someone to concentrate and act with intention, it requires alignment for a “movement” to move. Importantly, this is not a top-down formation, but rather a mutual agreement among individuals who pay intense attention to the same things and to each other. I draw the connection between individual and collective concentration because it makes the stakes of attention clear. It’s not just that living in a constant state of distraction is unpleasant, or that a life without wilful thought and action is an impoverished one. If it’s true that collective agency both mirrors and relies on the individual capacity to “pay attention”, then in a time that demands action, distraction appears to be (at the level of the collective) a life-and-death matter. A social body that can’t concentrate or communicate with itself is like a person who can’t think and act.\n\n– Jenny Odell\n\nPoetry is not a fancy way of giving you information; it’s an incantation. It is actually a magic spell. It changes things; it changes you.\n\n– Philip Pullman\n\nLife hasn’t just begun. Art never had a beginning. Always, until the moment of its stopping, it was constantly there. It is infinite. It is here, at this moment, behind me and inside me, and, as if the doors of an Assembly Hall were suddenly flung open, I am immersed in its fresh, headlong omnilocality and omnitemporality, as if an oath of allegiance were to be sworn without delay. No genuine book has a first page. Like the rustling of a forest, it is begotten God knows where, and it grows and it rolls, arousing the dense wilds of the forest until suddenly, in the very darkest, most stunned and panicked moment, it rolls to its end and begins to speak with all the treetops at once.\n\n– Boris Pasternak\n\nBe careful of words, even the miraculous ones. For the miraculous we do our best, sometimes they swarm like insects and leave not a sting but a kiss. They can be as good as fingers. They can be as trusty as the rock you stick your bottom on. But they can be both daisies and bruises. Yet I am in love with words. They are doves falling out of the ceiling. They are six holy oranges sitting in my lap. They are the trees, the legs of summer, and the sun, its passionate face…\n\n– Anne Sexton\n\nWith the arrival of electric technology, man has extended, or set outside himself, a live model of the central nervous system itself. To the degree that this is so, it is a development that suggests a desperate suicidal autoamputation, as if the central nervous system could no longer depend on the physical organs to be protective buffers against the slings and arrows of outrageous mechanism.\n\n– Marshall McLuhan\n\nParsifal, Turning Difficulties into Healing,\n\nby Jack Kornfield.\n\nIn the Arthurian legends, the young knight Parsifal joins the Knights of the Round Table to seek the Holy Grail. His mentor, Gournamond, tells him that to remain honorable, he must follow two rules: First, he should neither seduce nor be seduced. And second, if he reaches the Castle of the Holy Grail, he must ask, “Whom does the Grail serve?” As he travels, he sees all around him signs of suffering and disarray. But when Parsifal finally makes his way to the Grail Castle, he is utterly intoxicated by the court. He meets the wounded Fisher King and is offered a magical banquet that includes everything he could desire. He forgets his purpose and does not ask the essential question. The next morning the whole castle and kingdom disappear and Parsifal must wander and suffer for many years until by hard-won maturity he returns a second time. This time he remembers, “Whom does the Grail serve?” he asks. The Fisher King answers, “The Holy Grail serves the Grail King.” (The Grail King is God.) As soon as the Fisher King is reminded of this holy truth, he is healed, and in being healed, all that has rotted in the fields, all disharmony in his nation, all the sufferings of the kingdom are restored to peace and well-being.\n\nThe resolution of the journey to enlightenment comes when we recognize that both our suffering and our awakening are in the service of a higher good. Unless we serve the Divine, our unfulfilled needs can become entangled with out quest, and our spiritual experiences can work only to create a more expanded form of ego. A teacher who is overidentified with spiritual energy may subtly believe that, as the one who carries the teachings, it is he or she who must be served. We should be wary when there is a court around a teacher that focuses more on the person than on the wisdom of the lineage. When the Fisher King forgets whom he serves, the bounty of the kingdom fails, and all suffer from the king’s spiritual sickness.\n\nWe’re unprepared\n\nfor our little disappointments.\n\nNormally I might not pay attention\n\nto sunlight pouring into the courtyard\n\nbut this afternoon, I do –\n\nprobably because it’s already nearly gone.\n\nNone of us mentions the night,\n\nbut I, for one, would like to\n\nbe expecting it, when\n\nit comes.\n\n– Nathan McClain\n\nMy vessel is launched on the boundless main and my sails are spread to the wind ! In the whole of the world there is nothing that stays unchanged. All is in flux. Any shape that is formed is constantly shifting. Time itself flows steadily by in perpetual motion.\n\nThink of a river: no river can ever arrest its current, nor can the fleeting hour. But as water is forced downstream by the water behind it and presses no less on the water ahead, so time is in constant flight and pursuit, continually new. The present turns into the past and the future replaces the present; every moment that passes is new and eternally changing.\n\n– Ovid, Metamorphoses\n\nWhen I love\n\nI feel that I am the king of time\n\nI possess the earth and everything on it\n\nand ride into the sun upon my horse.\n\nWhen I love\n\nI become liquid light\n\ninvisible to the eye\n\nand the poems in my notebooks\n\nbecome fields of mimosa and poppy.\n\nWhen I love\n\nthe water gushes from my fingers\n\ngrass grows on my tongue\n\nwhen I love\n\nI become time outside all time.\n\nWhen I love a woman\n\nall the trees run barefoot toward me?\n\n– Nizar Qabbani\n\nIN PRAISE OF MY SISTER by Wislawa Szymborska\n\nTranslated from the Polish by Stanislaw Baranczcak and Clare Cavanagh\n\nMy sister doesn’t write poems.\n\nand it’s unlikely that she’ll suddenly start writing poems.\n\nShe takes after her mother, who didn’t write poems,\n\nand also her father, who likewise didn’t write poems.\n\nI feel safe beneath my sister’s roof:\n\nmy sister’s husband would rather die than write poems.\n\nAnd, even though this is starting to sound as repetitive as\n\nPeter Piper,\n\nthe truth is, none of my relatives write poems.\n\nMy sister’s desk drawers don’t hold old poems,\n\nand her handbag doesn’t hold new ones,\n\nWhen my sister asks me over for lunch,\n\nI know she doesn’t want to read me her poems.\n\nHer soups are delicious without ulterior motives.\n\nHer coffee doesn’t spill on manuscripts.\n\nThere are many families in which nobody writes poems,\n\nbut once it starts up it’s hard to quarantine.\n\nSometimes poetry cascades down through the generations,\n\ncreating fatal whirlpools where family love may founder.\n\nMy sister has tackled oral prose with some success.\n\nbut her entire written opus consists of postcards from\n\nvacations\n\nwhose text is only the same promise every year:\n\nwhen she gets back, she’ll have\n\nso much\n\nmuch\n\nmuch to tell.\n\nWe still do not know one thousandth of one percent of what nature has revealed to us.\n\n– Albert Einstein\n\nUpon being the first Black man to earn a PhD from Harvard, WEB DuBois said: The honor, I assure you, was Harvard’s.\n\nBy the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.\n\n– Psalm 137\n\nA monk asks: Is there anything more miraculous than the wonders of Nature?\n\nThe master answers: Yes, your awareness of the wonders of Nature.\n\n– Angelus Silesius\n\nBut write what you love with eyes wide open.\n\n– James Scott Bell\n\nIn order to establish an enlightened society for others, we need to discover what inherently we have to offer the world.\n\n– Chögyam Trungpa\n\n…I had been sleepwalking: poems had guided me, instead of the moon, and the world had been absent.\n\n– Lydia Chukovskaya, The Akhmatova Journals, Volume 1\n\nPerhaps the greatest irony of healing is that it occurs when we accept our felt experience, rather than rely on willpower or focused effort to get rid of the unwanted.\n\n– Josh Korda\n\nThe fact that writing remains so difficult is what puzzles.\n\n– Elizabeth Hardwick\n\nEverything I deny is granted a greater degree of autonomy. Everything I project onto the other ultimately comes back to haunt me. Everything I refuse to face remains a part of my presence in this world. Looking at that, working at it as best we can, lifting that off of our partners and others is the single best thing we can do for the world.\n\n– James Hollis\n\nThe bright hero is a little too bright, a little too invulnerable, and a little too far away from ordinary human suffering and ordinary human longing to perform his appointed task of redemption. He can be injured only from behind, implying that the bright heroic stance can deflect anything in life but the shadow, the unconscious.\n\n– Liz Greene\n\nWith glorious naïveté a statesman comes out with the proud declaration that he has no “imagination for evil.” Quite right: we have no imagination for evil, but evil has us in its grip. Some do not want to know this, and others are identified with evil. That is the psychological situation in the world today.\n\n– CG Jung\n\nWhat I want very much to see are two mass migrations — one out of the shallows of rationalistic humanism to an appreciation of the mystery of things, the other out of religious faith to a true appreciation of our ignorance.\n\n– Bryan Magee\n\nI tell people, Make a list of ten things you hate and tear them down in a short story or poem. Make a list of ten things you love and celebrate them. When I wrote Fahrenheit 451 I hated book burners and I loved libraries. So there you are.\n\n– Ray Bradbury\n\nIf the person you like has an overloaded ego and has difficulty seeing other perspectives beyond their own, they will struggle to love you well.\n\n– yung pueblo\n\nI am sorry I can say nothing more to console you, for love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared with love in dreams. Love in dreams is greedy for immediate action, rapidly performed and in the sight of all. [People] will even give their lives if only the ordeal does not last long but is soon over, with all looking on and applauding as though on stage. But active love is labor and fortitude, and for some people too, perhaps, a complete science.\n\n– Fyodor Dostoyevsky\n\nEverything you’ve built and collected has to be carried higher. Every day higher still. You get the feeling that your paradise is sinking into the sea and you have a strange desire to go with it.\n\n– Tove Jansson\n\nSssnnnwhuffffll?Hnwhuffl hhnnwfl hnfl hfl?Gdroblboblhobngbl gbl gl g g g g glbgl…\n\n– Edwin Morgan, The Loch Ness Monster’s Song\n\n…He roved among the vales and streams, In the green wood and hollow dell; They were his dwellings night and day, But nature ne’er could find the way Into the heart of Peter Bell. In vain, through every changeful year, Did Nature lead him as before; A primrose by a river’s brim A yellow primrose was to him, And it was nothing more…\n\n– William Wordsworth, Peter Bell\n\nTo the poet, the primrose can be something more. I suggest that this something more is, in fact, a self-reflexive recognition. The primrose resembles a poem and both poem and primrose resemble the poet. He learns about himself as a creator when he looks at the primrose. His pride is enhanced to see himself as a contributor to the vast processes which the primrose exemplifies. And his humility is exercised and made valid by recognizing himself as a tiny product of those processes.\n\n– Gregory Bateson\n\nIt’s quite a thing to do a little better than the ones who came before. It may not seem like such a big thing—perhaps because we know that one day, humanity will rise far beyond its ancestral patterns—but it really is quite something. Because those grooves run deep in our patterning. Because they course right through our veins. Even a little bit more growthful, a little bit more loving, a little bit more conscious, is a remarkable step forward for humanity. Perhaps we can take some time this week to acknowledge that. To give ourselves (and others) credit for all that we have done to break the chains of generational habit. To celebrate the courage that it took to do a little better than the ones who came before. It really is quite something. Every little step, huge.\n\n– Jeff Brown\n\nI only knew The stay of your secure firm dry embrace.\n\n– Thom Gunn\n\non the death of a poet, i ask: can a poet be missed? consider this: a poem, once written, is like a child who leaves home and will never call again. not even during days of fiesta. in reality, a poem, once born, never dies. but interestingly, without a poet, a poem will never be born. a poet grants the poem what he cannot possess: life eternal. but does a poem want to live forever? i have known poems and i don’t believe they know what they want. does a poet want to live forever? i have known poets and i believe they pretend they know what they want. but those poets who truly live the poetry of their lives surely die. that’s why i was not surprised to hear that leonard cohen has died. it’s ok. let us all say hallelujah! and may his memory be a blessing.\n\n– hune margulies, 2016\n\nNever appropriate dharmas, but always give them up.

Grace Frick)\n\nYou’re shifting, shedding, evolving, becoming, blooming. Give thanks for the lessons learned. There’s more to your story than your scars.\n\n– Dr. Thema\n\nThe philosopher Plotinus suggested that while the body favors a straight line, the soul hankers for the circle. This mythic, circular time, (which is really no kind of time at all) laughs at the straight line and the alarm clock.\n\n– Dr. Martin Shaw\n\nOne way of measuring ego-strength and maturity of personality is to assess a person’s capacity to tolerate ambivalence. This capacity is closely related to the ability to feel empathy. It is all about tolerating otherness.\n\n– Heidi M. Kolb\n\nThe good life is not any fixed state. It is not a state of contentment, or Nirvana. It is not a condition in which the individual is adjusted, fulfilled, or actualized. The good life is a process, not a state of being. It is a direction, not a destination.\n\n– Carl Rogers\n\nWe can’t have clean energy because it will destroy the oil industry. We can’t have healthcare because it will destroy the health insurance industry. We can’t have peace because it will destroy the weapon industry. Capitalism built a system we can’t afford to do the right thing.\n\n– Mohamad Safa\n\nMason bees belly flop onto the flower, which gets pollen all over their body. Whereas, a honey bee collects pollen on their back legs. This enables mason bees to pollinate 95% of the flowers they land on vs. 5% for the honey bees.\n\n– Google\n\nLet go of all that you no longer need. This is how you heal, using your body to sing.\n\n– James Crews\n\nI was not born to this wariness. I came of age as my kind do—armed with ache and swathed in rectitude, a rough carving sluiced under a torrent of disregard.\n\n– Rita Dove\n\nin the breeze the trees’ shadows watery, mine mixed among them, the heart young & old at once.\n\n– Susan Browne\n\n“GOD” The word “God” is a symbol not a definition. Religious symbols should attempt to share our most profound experiences of reverence in poetic imagery. Symbols should attempt to deepen and broaden our shared sense of reverence, not to capture the sacred in an iron cage of systematic theology “God” is not an object that can be defined. “God” is a symbol of everything too deep, too big or too mysterious to be understand. If “God” were an actual being in the world, we would not need symbols of transcendence. Any definition of the infinite is a contradiction in terms. Symbols require a shift from our ordinary ways of thinking and speaking. Far from discursive thought, they call us to a kind of agnostic reverence. It is always a mistake to reason from religious symbols. When we think we know what “God” thinks, when we use “God” as a scientific explanation, when we use “God” as a political justification- we are taking the divine name in vain. The deadliest idols of our day are not the mockery of heretics, but the concrete mental images of faithful believers. To worship any concrete image of the transcendent is idolatry, not reverence. Systematic theology is often idolatry buttressed by biblical quotes with Greek and Latin footnotes. Once we think of “God” as an actual being, our religious symbols no longer point to the transcendent, but refer only to themselves. Symbols that hardened into concrete beliefs become cataracts of the soul.\n\n– Jim Rigby\n\nIn the land of bleating sheep and braying jackasses, one brave and honest man is bound to create a scandal.\n\n– Edward Abbey\n\ni cannot believe how long september feels before september even starts\n\n– Glennon Doyle\n\nAll a poet can do today is warn.\n\n– Wilfred Owen\n\nI am a poet, I think, because I’m always a little lost. Always hunting around in the dark, always never quite sure. What is it that I’m feeling? What is it that I want? What is it that makes me so uncomfortable but I cannot put my finger on it? Why does this happen when I open myself up, why does this happen when I retreat? I am continually shifting about in a dark room, trying to UNDERSTAND what it is. In the dark, I bump into a thing… I can’t name it. But I begin to describe it. The corners and edges, the space it takes. Texture. And soon enough, even though I’m still fumbling, it’s as if the lights are on. I see it. And you see it with me. How did that happen? I don’t know how it happens… except it has been my truest guide. Language, poetry, particulars of the indescribable.\n\n– Layli LongSoldier\n\nThe deepness can’t be held or assuaged except in the time love grows in. “In” is where the deepness dwells. When deeps hold other deeps, something sleeps. Something else awakens. What is between the deeps of you and those in me? Why is love so hot it bares us to the bone? Anole lizards change the color of their skin. There is world enough to feel what deepness means.\n\n– George Gorman\n\nSeek patience\n\nand passion\n\nin equal amounts.\n\nPatience alone\n\nwill not build the temple.\n\nPassion alone\n\nwill destroy its walls.\n\n– Maya Angelou\n\nEmotions are paramount in safe passageway,\n\nyou said so long ago.\n\nHow we could come down this road\n\nwas nurtured by how it felt.\n\nThrough the feeling-speech of teamwork-love\n\nislands grow into archipelagos,\n\nclouds, reefs and towns convene\n\nwith all cells in dialogue.\n\nThe spirit of life is a feeling-being\n\nEmotions have always been paramount.\n\nA rousing cheer for feeling what’s here!\n\nCelebrating the whole team of earth.\n\n– George Gorman\n\nThere is a tendency at every important but difficult crossroad to pretend that it’s not really there.\n\n– Bill McKibben\n\nAbandon the search for God and the creation and other matters of a similar sort. Look for him by taking yourself as the starting point. Learn who it is who within you makes everything his own and says, “My God, my mind, my thought, my soul, my body.” Learn the sources of sorrow, joy, love, hate. Learn how it happens that one watches without willing, rests without willing, becomes angry without willing, loves without willing. If you carefully investigate these matters you will find him in yourself.\n\n– Monomius\n\nDirect the world in which you act towards that which is good, and the measured and peaceful course of time will bring about the results. You have given it this direction if by your teaching you raise its thoughts towards the necessary and the eternal; if, by your acts or your creations, you make the necessary and the eternal the object of your leanings. The structure of error and of all that is arbitrary must fall, and it has already fallen, as soon as you are sure that it is tottering. But it is important that it should not only totter in the external but also in the internal man.\n\nCherish triumphant truth in the modest sanctuary of your heart; give it an incarnate form through beauty, that it may not only be the understanding that does homage to it, but that loving feeling mayly grasp its appearance. And that you may not by any chance take from external reality the model which you yourself ought to furnish, do not venture into its dangerous society before you are assured in your own heart that you have a good escort furnished by ideal nature.\n\nLive with your age, but be not its creature; Labor for your contemporaries, but give them what they need, and not what they praise. Without having shared their faults, share their punishment with a noble resignation, and bend under the yoke that they find is as painful to dispense with as to bear. By the constancy with which you will despise their good fortune, you will prove to them that it is not through cowardice that you submit to their sufferings. See them in thought such as they ought to be when you must act upon them; but see them as they are when you are tempted to act for them. Seek to owe their suffrage to their dignity; but to make them happy keeping an account of their unworthiness; thus, on the one hand, the nobleness of your heart will kindle theirs, and, on the other, your end will not be reduced to nothingness by their unworthiness.\n\nThe gravity of your principles will keep them off from you, but in play they will still endure them. Their taste is purer than their heart, and it is by their taste you must lay hold of this suspicious fugitive. In vain will ye combat their maxims, in vain will ye condemn their actions; but you can try your molding hand on their leisure. Drive away caprice, frivolity, and coarseness, from their pleasures, and you will banish them imperceptibly from their acts, and length from their feelings. Everywhere that you meet them, surround them with great, noble, and ingenious forms; multiply around them the symbols of perfection, till appearance triumphs over reality, and art over nature.\n\n– Friedrich Schiller\n\nDr. Suzanne Simard explains how mycorrhizal networks connect the roots of trees:\n\n[Graduate student Kevin Beiler] has found that all trees in dry interior Douglas-fir forests are interconnected, with the largest, oldest trees serving as hubs, much like the hub of a spoked wheel, where younger trees establish within the mycorrhizal network of the old trees. Through careful experimentation, recent graduate Francois Teste determined that survival of these establishing trees was greatly enhanced when they were linked into the network of the old trees. Through the use of stable isotope tracers, he and Amanda Schoonmaker\n\n[…] found that increased survival was associated with belowground transfer of carbon, nitrogen and water from the old trees.\n\nthe seats are\n\nempty.\n\nthe theatre is dark.\n\nWhy do you keep\n\nacting?\n\n– Charles Bukowski\n\nGive light, and the darkness will disappear of itself.\n\n– Erasmus\n\nTrust yourself. At the root, at the core, there is pure sanity, pure openness. Don’t trust what you have been taught, what you think, what you believe, what you hope. Deeper than that, trust the silence of your being.\n\n– Gangaji\n\nThe best way to get along with people is not to expect them to be like you.\n\n– Joyce Meyer\n\nTwo guiding principles for acquiring wisdom:\n\n1. Go to bed smarter than when you woke up\n\n2. Don’t try to figure everything out on your own. Learn from others.\n\n– Farnam Street\n\nWe need to know what virtue is and then take it up and put it into practice. Likewise, if we want to be free of suffering, we need to know its cause—various misdeeds and non virtue—and give it up. We need to identify what’s good and what is wrongdoing. What does virtue mean? What is non-virtue? These do not mean that there is a god who has commanded that you should not do this or that. Neither the Buddha nor anyone else has said that you are not allowed to do something, and if you do it, it is wrong. Instead, it comes down to your own mind. When you look at your mind, you can tell whether your acts are virtuous or non-virtuous. We can look at and see this for ourselves. When we act with a kind heart and good motivation, without any greed or lust, without any aggression and any delusion, that is virtuous. If, on the other hand, we act with a negative motivation, that is non-virtuous. For example, we could act out of the greed that wants only to benefit ourselves, or out of the aversion that wants to harm someone else, or out of delusion that does not know what to take up and what to give up.\n\n– Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche\n\nSome things you must always be unable to bear. Some things you must never stop refusing to bear. Injustice and outrage and dishonor and shame. No matter how young you are or how old you have got. Not for kudos and not for cash: your picture in the paper nor money in the bank either. Just refuse to bear them.\n\n– William Faulkner\n\nWe are meaning-seeking creatures and, unlike other animals, fall very easily into despair if we cannot find significance and value in our lives.\n\n– Karen Armstrong\n\nI have to tell you\n\nby Dorothea Grossman\n\nI have to tell you,\n\nthere are times when\n\nthe sun strikes me\n\nlike a gong,\n\nand I remember everything,\n\neven your ears.\n\nThe most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history.\n\n– George Orwell\n\nThe psyche is not unconscious. We are . . . The psyche is constantly making intelligible statements. It’s making dreams and symptoms, it’s making fantasies and moods. It’s extraordinarily intentional, purposive.\n\n– James Hillman, A Blue Fire\n\nAs a poet, what I’m trying to do is play with the world that I’ve inherited—the political worlds, the personal worlds. [I] try to shape them into poems that show me the truth of those moments, as well as show me the possibilities that exist and the world that we can create.\n\n– José Olivarez\n\nWe’re all witches in the making. Claiming space. Defining borders. Conjuring futures yet written. Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful.\n\n– Mary Shelley\n\nWitches don’t look like anything. Witches are. Witches do.\n\n– Franny Billingsley\n\nI like to be surrounded by splendid things.\n\n– Freddie Mercury\n\nIt is justice, not charity, that is wanting in the world.\n\n– Mary Wollstonecraft\n\nDesire narrows our awareness till we see only what we crave; mindfulness helps us see other possibilities.\n\n– Sandra Weinberg\n\nThe living relation between the poem and the world: difficult knowledge, operating theater where the poet, committed, goes on working.\n\n– Adrienne Rich\n\nWhy would you let someone who cannot hear the great poem of the world judge your life?\n\n– Joseph Fasano\n\nLittle do we realize, until perhaps the consequences pile high, that we are still captive to early formative experiences and are not exercising the powers of the emergent adulthood we in fact possess.\n\n– James Hollis\n\nAbleism is telling yourself that you’ll never become disabled; that you’re invincible and it couldn’t ever happen to you. ANYONE can become disabled and it’s actually inevitable that you will be once you age. Caring about disabled people is caring about your future self.\n\n– Briana Mills, LMFT\n\nOh, you woke up?\n\nThen what happened?\n\nThere’s just one “health” and it’s physical, mental, individual, & collective.\n\n– @VinceFHorn\n\nlet us not teach\n\nwhat we have learned badly\n\nand not profited by\n\n– H.D.\n\nInner work, as a practical experience, shows us that we can embrace the conflict, embrace the duality, bravely place ourselves in the very midst of the warring voices, and find our way through them to the unity that they ultimately express.\n\n– Robert A. Johnson\n\nA book, a story, should be smarter than its author. It is the critic or the teacher in you or me who cleverly outwits the characters with the power of prior knowledge of meetings and ends. Stay open and ignorant.\n\n– Grace Paley\n\nAll I can come up with are stray sentences, he said, maybe because reality seems to me like a swarm of stray sentences.\n\n– Bolaño, Antwerp (tr. Wimmer)\n\nblue moon\n\nevery poet\n\nsees a different hue\n\n– @hegelincanada\n\nMyths derive from the visions of people who have searched their own most inward world.\n\n– Joseph Campbell\n\nIf we lack inner freedom, intense sensory experiences can generate strong attachments that entangle us. If we know how to maintain our inner freedom, we can experience sensations within the simplicity of the present moment, in a state of well-being that is free from grasping.\n\n– Matthieu Ricard\n\nrules are very hard\n\njust ignore them as a bard\n\npoetic license\n\n– @ehinsen\n\nI call it therapy of ideas. When people ask me if I practice, I say no, I no longer practice. I practice what I call the therapy of ideas. I think we’re sick from ideas.\n\n– James Hillman\n\nStarting to think “we are engaged in a psychic time war” is actually a pretty useful myth.\n\n– @the_wilderless\n\nThe snake which cannot cast its skin has to die.\n\nAs well the minds which are prevented from changing their opinions; they cease to be mind.\n\n– Friedrich Nietzsche\n\nIt’s not ‘natural’ to speak well, eloquently, in an interesting, articulate way.
