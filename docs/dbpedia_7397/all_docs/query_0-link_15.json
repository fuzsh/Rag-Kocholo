It was observed that in trying to tag friends we invariably sacrifice content.\n\nInstead it was suggested that we only tag @shairoftheday handle.\n\nThat way we can read all the tweets on a given day there or by searching #shair hashtag.\n\nAnd in the space left we add poets name & meanings of difficult words.\n\nIf you want your friends to read just tag them by pressing rey to the sherr tweet and writing their names.\n\n2. We MUST ADD name of poets\n\nIn absence of that it is taken to be by one tweeting. Also poets should get their due.\n\n3. We can try and read some of the tweets made by others to avoid repetition especially of famous verses\n\n4. Its my suggestion that we have some senior members to curate the handle once every month for a week. To be chosen by few of us. The first curator will be @anandnama\n\nThat way we add freshness of thought.\n\nCurator wilk make the schedule and lead the discussion for that week.\n\n5. We keep a simple and easy format during the week for maximum participation and on Sundays we experiment.\n\nAnyone is welcome to send suggestions with #shersuggestion - dm it please"
