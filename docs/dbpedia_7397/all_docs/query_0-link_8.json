        "text": "I came to explore the wreck.\n\nThe words are purposes.\n\nThe words are maps.\n\nI came to see the damage that was done\n\nand the treasures that prevail.\n\n….\n\nthe thing I came for:\n\nthe wreck and not the story of the wreck\n\nthe thing itself and not the myth\n\n– Adrienne Rich\n\nWhen we respect our blood ancestors and our spiritual ancestors, we feel rooted. If we find ways to cherish and develop our spiritual heritage, we will avoid the kind of alienation that is destroying society, and we will become whole again. … Learning to touch deeply the jewels of our own tradition will allow us to understand and appreciate the values of other traditions, and this will benefit everyone.\n\n– Thich Nhat Hanh\n\nTo laugh is to risk appearing the fool.\n\nTo weep is to risk appearing sentimental.\n\nTo reach out for another is to risk involvement.\n\nTo expose feelings is to risk exposing your true self.\n\nTo place ideas and dreams before a crowd is to risk being called naive.\n\nTo love is to risk not being loved in return.\n\nTo live is to risk dying.\n\nTo hope is to risk despair.\n\nTo try is to risk failure.\n\nBut risk must be taken, because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing.\n\nThe person who risks nothing, does nothing, has\n\nnothing,\n\nis nothing, and becomes nothing.\n\nThey may avoid suffering and sorrow, but they\n\ncannot learn, feel, change, grow, love, live.\n\nChained by their certitude, they are slaves; they have\n\nforfeited their freedom.\n\nOnly a person who risks is truely free.\n\n– Janet Rand, Risks\n\nOwing to its self-expanding and self-creating power, a great loving heart transforms this earthly world into one of splendor and mutual fusion…and this is where the Buddha is always abiding.\n\n– D.T. Suzuki\n\n…Still, what I want in my life\n\nis to be willing\n\nto be dazzled—\n\nto cast aside the weight of facts\n\nand maybe even\n\nto float a little\n\nabove this difficult world.\n\nI want to believe I am looking\n\ninto the white fire of a great mystery.\n\nI want to believe that the imperfections are nothing—\n\nthat the light is everything—that it is more than the sum\n\nof each flawed blossom rising and falling. And I do.\n\n– Mary Oliver, from the House of Light\n\nOne of the obstacles to bodhisattva discipline is an absence of humor.\n\n– Chogyam Trungpa\n\nNever stay up on the barren heights of cleverness, but come down into the green valleys of silliness.\n\n– Ludwig Wittgenstein\n\nTo make sense is to release the body from the constraints imposed by outworn ways of speaking, and hence to renew and rejuvenate one’s felt awareness of the world. It is to make the senses wake up to where they are.\n\n– David Abram\n\nThe more a person knows of himself, the more he will hesitate to define his nature and to assert what he must necessarily feel, and the more he will be astounded at his capacity to feel in unsuspected and unpredictable ways.\n\n– Alan W. Watts, Nature, Man and Woman\n\nConsider that our individuality radically may intersect with that of others as a common soul, that we aren’t as separate as our current philosophy implies.\n\n– Thomas Moore\n\nWhat is being asked of us is not a little thing. It is not just a new technique or a certain skill we need to learn. It is not an add-on or an adjustment to our way of being: it is a different way of being. It is a revolution in consciousness—more profound in its implications, perhaps, than the one initiated when Copernicus displaced the earth from its position at the center of the heavens; for we are not just accommodating a new piece of knowledge that overturns an old belief system and thereby changes us. The change that is needed is one we have to initiate within ourselves voluntarily: to self-achieve a submission to wholeness that will transform how we live in the world. It will displace the head from its position at the center of our thinking, and attune us to the very intelligence out of which and into which we were born. This journey into wholeness is a revolution that the entire planet is crying out for—and it can only begin with individuals like you making a personal choice.\n\n– Philip Shepherd, a quote from Radical Wholeness\n\nWe call it “finding your own true north”– like on a compass. In production-driven societies, we’re tricked into believing that true north is outside of us. So we’re constantly looking outside ourselves to figure out if this is the right job, the right house, the right relationship, the right subject to be studying. But our true north is invariably inside us . . . if we do what we love to do, what we’re inspired to do, what we believe in, it creates an entirely different response.\n\n– Julia Butterfly Hill\n\nWhen your footsteps and thoughts carry you down the same path your heart and soul are directing you, you will know without a doubt that you are headed in the right direction.\n\n– Molly Friedenfeld\n\nKen Wilber:\n\nWhat if we took literally everything that all the various cultures have to tell us about human potential—about spiritual growth, psychological growth, social growth—and put it all on the table?\n\nWhat if we attempted to find the critically essential keys to human growth, based on the sum total of human knowledge now open to us?\n\nWhat if we attempted, based on extensive cross-cultural study, to use all of the world’s great traditions to create a composite map, a comprehensive map, an all-inclusive or integral map that included the best elements from all of them?\n\nWelcome to the Integral Approach.\n\nThe New Masculine\n\nHe cleans up after himself. He cleans up the planet.\n\nHe is a role model for young men.\n\nHe is rigorously honest and fiercely optimistic.\n\nHe holds himself accountable.\n\nHe knows what he feels.He knows how to cry and he lets it go.\n\nHe knows how to rage without hurting others.\n\nHe knows how to fear and how to keep moving.\n\nHe seeks self-mastery.\n\nHe has let go of childish shame.\n\nHe feels guilty when he’s done something wrong.\n\nHe is kind to men, kind to women, kind to children.\n\nHe teaches others how to be kind.\n\nHe says he’s sorry.\n\nHe stopped blaming women or his parents or men for his pain years ago.\n\nHe stopped letting his defences ruin his relationships.\n\nHe stopped letting his penis run his life.\n\nHe has enough self-respect to tell the truth.\n\nHe creates intimacy and trust with his actions.\n\nHe has men that he trusts and that he turns to for support.\n\nHe knows how to roll with it.\n\nHe knows how to make it happen.\n\nHe is disciplined when he needs to be.\n\nHe is flexible when he needs to be.\n\nHe knows how to listen from the core of his being.\n\nHe’s not afraid to get dirty.\n\nHe’s ready to confront his own limitations.\n\nHe has high expectations for himself and for those he connects with.\n\nHe looks for ways to serve others.\n\nHe knows he is an individual.\n\nHe knows that we are all one.\n\nHe knows he is an animal and a part of nature.\n\nHe knows his spirit and his connection to something greater.\n\nHe knows that the future generations are watching his actions.\n\nHe builds communities where people are respected and valued.\n\nHe takes responsibility for himself and is also willing to be his brother’s keeper.\n\nHe knows his higher purpose.\n\nHe loves with fierceness.\n\nHe laughs with abandon, because he gets the joke.\n\nThis is the Mature Masculine – the New Warrior – The definition of masculinity for the 21st century. By no means is this list complete.\n\n– Boysen Hodgson\n\nThe more a person learns wholeheartedly to confront a world and way of living that threatens him with isolation, the more are the depths of the Ground of Being revealed and the possibilities of new life and Becoming opened for him.\n\n– Karlfried Graf Durckheim\n\nAmerica right now is what would happen to Bedford Falls if George Bailey had never been born.\n\n– Frankie Zelnick\n\nShall we not recover ourselves? Shall we not redeem ourselves to one another? Shall we not restore this world?\n\nCould we not be the generation who did what always should have been done? Who took the hard path so that humanity could be returned to the right path? Shall we not reexamine all that we choose to pursue and reconsider what will actually fulfill us?\n\nThe past has been defined by what we have done; while the present and future are decided by what we choose to do.\n\nShall we believe in what should be and go in search of it? Shall we believe in what needs to be and build it together?\n\nWe become more by believing that we can be more. Life becomes better when we are willing to act on the belief that it can be better.\n\nTo believe is to reach and reach is what we all must do.\n\n– L.M. Browning\n\nThe Dalai Lama says that the world will be saved by Western women. Not any women, perhaps not all women, but Burning Women. Women who have stepped out of silence and into the fullness of their power. Angry women who love the world and her creatures too much to let it be destroyed so thoughtlessly for a moment longer.\n\nBurning Woman is the heart and soul of revolution – inner and outer. She burns for change, she dances in the fire of the old, all the while visioning and weaving the new.\n\n– Lucy H. Pearce, Burning Woman\n\nWhat is that which can never die? It is that faithful force that is born into us that one that is greater than us that calls new seed to the open and battered and barren places so that we can be resown. It is this force in its insistence in its loyalty to us in its love of us in its most often mysterious ways that is far greater far more majestic and far more ancient than any heretofore ever known.\n\n– Clarissa Pinkola Estes\n\nHow curiously one is changed by the addition, even at a distance, of a friend.\n\n– Virginia Woolf\n\nBut, of course, to understand people’s changes, you have to love them.\n\n– Pier Paolo Pasolini\n\nIt happens all the time in heaven,\n\nAnd some day It will begin to happen\n\nAgain on earth –\n\nThat men and women who are married,\n\nAnd men and men who are Lovers,\n\nAnd women and women who give each other Light,\n\nOften get down on their knees and while\n\nSo tenderly holding their lovers hand, with\n\nTear-filled eyes will sincerely say, “My dear,\n\nHow can I be more loving to you; my darling,\n\nHow can I be more kind?”\n\n– Hafez Shirazi\n\nLadinsky’s translation\n\nWe are not as near each other as we would like to imagine. Words create the bridges between us. Without them we would be lost islands. Affection, recognition and understanding travel across these fragile bridges and enable us to discover each other and awaken friendship and intimacy. Words are never just words. The range and depth of a person’s soul is inevitably revealed in the quality of words she uses. When chosen with reverence and care, words not only describe what they say but also suggest what can never be said.\n\nBill [Stafford] suggests that these things which dwell out of reach, beyond words, are the things that make the soul rich. The inexpressible depth in us is our true treasure. In our endless social chatter and psychological labelling, we frequently cheapen its beauty. We need to learn the art of inner reverence and never force the soul out into the false light of social gratification and expectation. To observe an appropriate silence regarding our interiority means our talk will never be weak. In a culture where there is a morass of second-hand chatter, we need to mind our hearing; otherwise it becomes dull and deaf to the voice of what is real an d beautiful. To practise the discipline of reverence which Bill Stafford recommends means that we remain always secretly ready to receive the words that could illuminate our destiny.\n\n– John O’Donohue, Beauty: The Invisible Embrace\n\nA home is not simply a building; it is the shelter around the intimacy of a life. Coming in from the outside world and its rasp of force and usage, you relax and allow yourself to be who you are. The inner walls of a home are threaded with the textures of one’s soul, a subtle weave of presences. If you could see your home through the lens of the soul, you would be surprised at the beauty concealed in the memory your home holds. When you enter some homes, you sense how the memories have seeped to the surface, infusing the aura of the place and deepening the tone of its presence. Where love has lived, a house still holds the warmth. Even the poorest home feels like a nest if love and tenderness dwell there.\n\n– John O’Donohue\n\nThe secret and the sacred are sisters. When the secret is not respected, the sacred vanishes. Consequently, reflection should not shine too severe or aggressive a light on the world of the soul.\n\n– John O’Donohue, Anam Cara: A Book of Celtic Wisdom\n\nI am grateful to have a mind that can be changed. I am grateful to have a heart that can break and mend and break again. I am grateful to be growing so quickly each day I look back at yesterday say, “I can’t believe I did that.” I am grateful that I love hard enough to have a life full of grief. I am grateful that I love hard enough to have a life full of joy. I am grateful that my loved ones want me to be kinder than they want me to be cool. I’m grateful to not know if “cool” is still a cool thing to say. I am grateful to finally be learning how to talk sweetly to my most vulnerable self. I am grateful to know that even when the truth isn’t hopeful the telling of it is. I am grateful to be certain everyone in my life is jealous of my dance moves. I am grateful that I always pay attention to what the sky is singing. I am grateful for the poems that never became poems because I was too awed by the moment to sit down and write. I am grateful to know there is still a chance I’ll grow up to be a treehouse builder. I am grateful that I close my eyes when I kiss the same way I close my eyes when I pray. I am grateful to have lived through. I am grateful for you.\n\n– Andrea Gibson\n\nCollins Emeghara\n\nMelody in my heart\n\nYou’re the voice\n\nOf a distant drum\n\nDrumming from faraway land….\n\nReaching my ears\n\nHere in Africa and forcing\n\nMy heart to move her hips\n\nTo the left and to the right…\n\nSnow girl, you’re\n\nThe melody in my heart\n\nThe symphony of my soul\n\nAnd the sweet fragrance of my life…\n\nYou’re the voice\n\nOf a distant flute\n\nCrying in the hands\n\nOf a Chicken that lost her chicks…\n\nBlowing for her lost chicks\n\nBlowing to rewake the voice\n\nOf a new generation, in Africa\n\nAll over the World…\n\nWild orchid, you’re\n\nThe melody in my heart\n\nThe symphony of my soul\n\nThe sweet fragrance of my life…\n\nYou’re the voice\n\nOf a thousand poet\n\nReading with a new inspiration\n\nFrom the stage of Ambrosia at\n\nMidnight, in Valentine’s Eve…\n\nMy love, you’re the\n\nMelody in my heart\n\nThe symphony of my soul\n\nThe sweet fragrance of my life…\n\nAnd yes\n\nYou’re my voice\n\nThe voice of a distant poet…\n\nPRAISE SONG\n\nPraise the light of late November,\n\nthe thin sunlight that goes deep in the bones.\n\nPraise the crows chattering in the oak trees;\n\nthough they are clothed in night, they do not\n\ndespair. Praise what little there’s left:\n\nthe small boats of milkweed pods, husks, hulls,\n\nshells, the architecture of trees. Praise the meadow\n\nof dried weeds: yarrow, goldenrod, chicory,\n\nthe remains of summer. Praise the blue sky\n\nthat hasn’t cracked yet. Praise the sun slipping down\n\nbehind the beechnuts, praise the quilt of leaves\n\nthat covers the grass: Scarlet Oak, Sweet Gum,\n\nSugar Maple. Though darkness gathers, praise our crazy\n\nfallen world; it’s all we have, and it’s never enough.\n\n– Barbara Crooker\n\nMy wish, indeed my continuing passion, would be not to point the finger in judgment but to part a curtain, that invisible shadow that falls between people, the veil of indifference to each other’s presence, each other’s wonder, each other’s human plight.\n\n– Eudora Welty\n\nDigging\n\nToday I think\n\nOnly with scents, – scents dead leaves yield,\n\nAnd bracken, and wild carrot’s seed,\n\nAnd the square mustard field;\n\nOdours that rise\n\nWhen the spade wounds the root of tree,\n\nRose, currant, raspberry, or goutweed,\n\nRhubarb or celery;\n\nThe smoke’s smell, too,\n\nFlowing from where a bonfire burns\n\nThe dead, the waste, the dangerous,\n\nAnd all to sweetness turns.\n\nIt is enough\n\nTo smell, to crumble the dark earth,\n\nWhile the robin sings over again\n\nSad songs of Autumn mirth.\n\n– Edward Thomas\n\nI don’t like work… but I like what is in work – the chance to find yourself. Your own reality – for yourself, not for others – which no other man can ever know.\n\n– Joseph Conrad\n\nThe spirit of the valley never dies;\n\nThis is called the dark female.\n\nThe entry into the dark female\n\nIs called the root of heaven and earth.\n\nTao Te Ching: Chapter 6\n\ntranslation by D. C. Lau & Sarah Allan (Ma Wang Tui Manuscripts)\n\nYou darkness that I come from,\n\nout of which all things come,\n\nI love you more that all the fires\n\nthat fence the world,\n\nfor the fire makes a circle of light for everyone,\n\nand then no one outside learns of you,\n\nBut the darkness pulls in everything,\n\nshapes and fires, animals and myself.\n\nHow easily it gathers them,\n\npowers and people.\n\nIt is possible a great energy is moving near us.\n\nI have faith in the night.\n\n– Ranier Marie Rilke\n\nThe purpose of life is to contribute in some way to making things better.\n\n– Robert F. Kennedy\n\nEven among those\n\nwho think themselves indifferent\n\ntoward most things,\n\nit touches the very soul,\n\nthis first cool autumn wind.\n\n– Saigyo\n\nThe poems felt like they were resuscitating me, making me care more deeply again, more deeply than I had in years, about writing, poetry, literature.\n\n– Ocean Vuong\n\nWould you like to save the world from the degradation and destruction it seems destined for? Then step away from shallow mass movements and quietly go to work on your own self-awareness. If you want to awaken all of humanity, then awaken all of yourself. If you want to eliminate the suffering in the world, then eliminate all that is dark and negative in yourself. Truly, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self-transformation.\n\n– Lao Tzu\n\nIf the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore, and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown! But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile.\n\n– Ralph Waldo Emerson\n\nTrue spirituality is not a battle; it is the ultimate practice of nonviolence.\n\n– Chogyam Trungpa\n\nWe can place ourselves inside of time and culture and be bound by the constricting beliefs surrounding aging, or we can step beyond these boundaries and into a life-energizing matrix of new possibilities. Archetypes, internal allies, spiritual grounding and and a passion for a meaningful life can provide a whole new level of regeneration.\n\n– Jean Houston, Ph.D.\n\nI wish you a kinder sea.\n\n– Emily Dickinson\n\nPoem : you work on it, it works on you.\n\n– Henry Gould‏\n\nOh! It is only a novel… only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language.\n\n– Jane Austen, Northanger Abbey\n\nI decided that the most subversive, revolutionary thing I could do was to show up for my life and not be ashamed.\n\n– Anne Lamott\n\nWe are not here on this Earth just for ourselves. The goal of the cosmos is not for 7.5 billion human beings to seek their own private fulfillment, especially not at the expense of the rest of the planet.\n\nMeditation is not supposed to be about “me and my mind.” Yoga is intended for much more than “me and my body” or “me and my chakras.” Good nutrition is not simply about “me and my health.” Religion is not supposed to be concerned with “me and my enlightenment” or “me and my salvation” or “me and my afterlife.”\n\nAnd we in this convulsing country of ours are DEFINITELY not here to be obsessed with “America First,” as though such a thing were even possible on a continent located on a planet that is spinning through space with trillions of other fellow-creatures.\n\nRather, our beloved Source wants to experience ecstatic awe, wonder and surprise at the beauty and grandeur of the cosmos through our body, mind, imagination, heart, emotions, soul and spirit. And through our philosophy, theology, poetry, music, art, dance and culture.\n\nAre we up to the task, or will we be up to the task anytime soon?\n\n– Stephen Hatch\n\nTo Be of Use\n\nBy Marge Pierce\n\nThe people I love the best\n\njump into work head first\n\nwithout dallying in the shallows\n\nand swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight.\n\nThey seem to become natives of that element,\n\nthe black sleek heads of seals\n\nbouncing like half-submerged balls.\n\nI love people who harness themselves, an ox to a heavy cart,\n\nwho pull like water buffalo, with massive patience,\n\nwho strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward,\n\nwho do what has to be done, again and again.\n\nI want to be with people who submerge\n\nin the task, who go into the fields to harvest\n\nand work in a row and pass the bags along,\n\nwho are not parlor generals and field deserters\n\nbut move in a common rhythm\n\nwhen the food must come in or the fire be put out.\n\nThe work of the world is common as mud.\n\nBotched, it smears the hands, crumbles to dust.\n\nBut the thing worth doing well done\n\nhas a shape that satisfies, clean and evident.\n\nGreek amphoras for wine or oil,\n\nHopi vases that held corn, are put in museums\n\nbut you know they were made to be used.\n\nThe pitcher cries for water to carry\n\nand a person for work that is real.\n\nWhat the poet is searching for\n\nis not the fundamental I\n\nbut the deep you.\n\n– Antonio Machado\n\nWe simmered tea and talked and talked\n\nComing up with one great line after another.\n\nWe hung up a lamp and read old poems.\n\nI only just met you and yet I knew you all my life.\n\n– Hsu Yun (Empty Cloud) (1840 – 1959)\n\nChinese-born Chan Buddhist master.\n\nThe greatest happiness you can have is knowing that you do not necessarily require happiness.\n\n– William Saroyan\n\nShe it is that Solomon chose to have instead of light, and above all beauty and health…For all gold in her sight shall be esteemed as a little sand, and silver shall be counted as clay…And her fruit is more precious than all the riches of this world, and all the things that are desired are not to be compared with her…She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her, and an unfailing light…He who hath found this science, it shall be his rightful food for ever…Such a one is as rich as he that hath a stone from which fire is struck, who can give fire to whom he will as much as he will and when he will without loss to himself.\n\nBe turned to me with all your heart and do not cast me aside because I am black and swarthy, because the sun hath changed my colour and the waters have covered my face…because I stick fast in the mire of the deep and my substance is not disclosed. Wherefore out of the depths have I cried, and from the abyss of the earth with my voice to all you that pass by the way. Attend and see me, if any shall find one like unto me, I will give into his hand the morning star.\n\n– Aurora Consurgens\n\nAt the cardiac plexus… there in the center of the breast, we have a new great sun of knowledge and of being… Here I only know the delightful revelation that you are you. The wonder is no longer within me, my own dark, centrifugal exultant self. The wonder is without me. The wonder is outside me… I look with wonder, with tenderness, with joyful yearning towards that which is outside me, beyond me…\n\n– D. H. Lawrence\n\nWhatever it is that poetry asks for, what it needs to survive and to be listened to, I can hear or see none of it without a human pattern, that stain or wear or humor or fear that is not last, that makes things said a hopeful enterprise, a whistling in the seemingly endless dark. Much like the story of the boy walking through the graveyard, who sings because he is afraid, I need a company, even my own voice if there is no one else’s. But how dear to hear another’s! What relief to know that someone is truly there.\n\n– Robert Creeley\n\nA person needs new experiences. They jar something deep inside, allowing you to grow. Without them, it sleeps- seldom to awaken. The sleeper must awaken.\n\n– Frank Herbert\n\nWhen I began this work, someone asked me, why are you doing this? … the answer came right from my solar plexus: I’m doing this work so that when things fall apart, we will not turn on each other…\n\n– Joanna Macy\n\nPeople who’ve had any genuine spiritual experience always know that they don’t know. They are utterly humbled before mystery. They are in awe before the abyss of it all, in wonder at eternity and depth, and a Love, which is incomprehensible to the mind.\n\n– Fr. Richard Rohr\n\nThe hungers alone must suffice.\n\n– Anna Kamienska, A Nest of Quiet\n\nIt’s almost impossible for people to change alone. We need to join with others who will push us in our thinking and challenge us to do things we didn’t believe ourselves capable of.\n\n– Frances Moore Lappé\n\nEiner Hilfe bedarf der Mensch immer.\n\n(The human being always needs a help.)\n\n– F. W. J. Schelling\n\nCommunity not only creates abundance–community is abundance. If we could learn that equation from the world of nature, the human world might be transformed.\n\n– Parker J. Palmer\n\nEvery poem needs something holy to hold it.\n\n– Leah Nielsen\n\nWhen you attune to nature, you bring yourself close to us.\n\nWhen you attune to the stars, you bring yourself close to us.\n\nWhen you attune to joy and wonder, you touch the fabric of our realm. When you touch your own sacredness, you touch the bond we share. Think of us when you do these things, and you may find a bridge opening between us.\n\n– Conversation with the Sidhe, David Spangler\n\nL’imagination . . . se lassera plutôt de concevoir que la nature de fournir.\n\n(The imagination runs dry sooner than nature does.)\n\n– Pascal, Pensées\n\nHEALING: A WHOLE LOTTA LOVE\n\nWhat if we don’t really grow or transform? What if healing isn’t ridding ourselves, changing ourselves, or shifting ourselves? What if our natural process is to simply ‘come out’ more and more as ourselves- as who we have always been?\n\nIn my view, the healing problem arises because much of who we are is invisible to us, unconscious. Given that, what is healing? Coming to know our wholeness, our diversity, our deepest nature and having that witnessed, appreciated, and nourished. I call that love.\n\n– David Bedrick\n\nImagine you are a photon, a packet of light. You are a tiny blip of energy, hurtling through the universe on your own. But you have a twin, another photon to whom you have been intimately connected since the day you were born. No matter what distance separates you, be it the width of a lab bench or the breadth of the universe, you mirror each other. Whatever happens to your twin instantaneously affects you, and vice versa. You are like the mouse siblings in “An American Tail,” wrenched apart by fate but feeling the same feelings and singing the same song beneath the same glowing moon.\n\nThis is quantum entanglement. To non-physicists it sounds about as fantastical as singing mice, and indeed, plenty of physicists have problems with the phenomenon. Albert Einstein, whose own research helped give rise to quantum theory, derisively called the concept “spooky action at a distance.” Quantum entanglement seems to break some of the bedrock rules of standard physics: that nothing can travel faster than light, that objects are only influenced by their immediate surroundings. And scientists still can’t explain how the particles are linked. Is it wormholes? An unknown dimension?

In the patches, large and small, of what Arne Naess called free nature, utopia is irrelevant. If you exercise your inborn awareness, you’re in Paradise. And in the places that have been trashed by human purposes, the obvious need is for care and hands-on attention, reclamation and restoration, not sci-fi technology. Land is alive and actual.

Perhaps its\n\nsingle word is mend, a word that all my\n\nother words have felt a kinship with.\n\nEvenings when I sit out back, I think my\n\nthoughts have always been inclining toward\n\na self whose soul has found a place to be\n\nalone, away from others I don’t trust,\n\ncontent to watch the falling leaves. Dull\n\nimage—perhaps cliché—but I’ll take it\n\nnonetheless. The truth is: here we are\n\ninside these lives we sometimes do not\n\nrecognize, these lives we don’t deserve.\n\nSo many selves we almost came to be\n\nnever came to be. So many words too true\n\nto whisper to ourselves we go on listening\n\ntoward. So many bridges never crossed,\n\nothers stepped back from. So much I’ll\n\nnever understand about the reasons\n\nI survived when others didn’t. Years\n\nago I found a book, like a gift, fallen\n\nbetween two shelves. Inside, someone\n\nhad penciled, Language isn’t sad but\n\nmeaning is. I’ve held those words as\n\nclose as any I have known, having felt\n\na pull toward nothingness, toward lack\n\nof anyone or anything that might repair\n\nmy ruined thoughts, and just as often\n\nI have stood in shallow creeks, waiting\n\non my world to end, assured I have no\n\nplace, no name, no face, no words to say\n\nthe source of what I’m always reaching\n\ntoward. I have followed driftwood,\n\nimagined my own dead self assigned\n\nto stir above the silt. I’ve watched\n\nthe motions course along through shadows\n\nsoon to reach a bend and carry on unseen.\n\nStill, I have a faith that what is next is what\n\nthe story most requires so that the shape\n\nof time allotted, ordained to be, can then\n\nreveal itself. Bend, mend—the echo isn’t\n\nlost on me—and giving in to where I’m\n\nbeing taken has been the way I’ve come\n\nto know my life, to speak its mysteries.\n\n– Jeff Hardin\n\nA poem from Eleanor Wilner:\n\nLanding\n\nIt was a pure white cloud that hung there\n\nin the blue, or a jellyfish on a waveless\n\nsea, suspended high above us; we were\n\nthe creatures in the weeds below.\n\nIt seemed so effortless in its suspense,\n\nperfectly out of time and out of place\n\nlike the ghost of moon in the sky\n\nof a brilliant afternoon.\n\nAfter a while it seemed to grow, and we\n\ninferred that it was moving, drifting down—\n\nthough it seemed weightless, motionless,\n\none of those things that defy\n\nthe ususal forces—gravity, and wind\n\nand the almost imperceptible\n\npressure of the years. But it was coming down.\n\nThe blur of its outline slowly cleared:\n\nit was scalloped at the lower edge, like a shell\n\nor a child’s drawing of a flower, detached\n\nand floating, beauty simplified. That’s when\n\nwe saw it had a man attached, suspended\n\nfrom the center of the flower, a kind of human\n\nstamen or a stem. We thought it was\n\na god, or heavenly seed, sent\n\nto germinate the earth\n\nwith a gentler, nobler breed. It might be\n\nsomeone with sunlit eyes and mind of dawn.\n\nWe thought of falling to our knees.\n\nSo you can guess\n\nthe way we might have felt\n\nwhen it landed in our field\n\nwith the hard thud of solid flesh\n\nand the terrible flutter of the collapsing\n\nlung of silk. He smelled of old sweat, his\n\nuniform was torn, and he was tangled\n\nin the ropes, hopelessly harnessed\n\nto the white mirage that brought him down.\n\nHe had a wound in his chest, a red\n\nflower that took its color from his heart.\n\nWe buried him that very day, just as he came\n\nto us, in a uniform of soft brown\n\nwith an eagle embroidered on the sleeve,\n\nits body made of careful gray stitches,\n\nits eye a knot of gold. The motto\n\nunderneath had almost worn away. For days,\n\nwatching from our caves, we saw\n\nthe huge white shape of silk shifting\n\nin the weeds, like a pale moon\n\nwhen the wind filled it, stranded,\n\nsearching in the aimless way\n\nof unmoored things\n\nfor whatever human ballast gave\n\ndirection to their endless drift.\n\nTURN THE KEY AND ENTER\n\nHad you but the courage to acknowledge the haunted inner room, turn the key and enter, you would encounter nothing strange or sinister there. You would meet some vital self of yours that you had banished during a time of pain or difficulty. Sometimes, when life squeezes you into lonely crevices, you may have to decide between survival and breaking apart. The banished self from an earlier time of life remains within you waiting to be released and integrated. The soul has its own logic of loyalty and concealment. Ironically, it is usually in the most awkward rooms that the special blessings and healing are locked away.\n\n– John O’Donohue\n\nEvery crisis contains with it the seeds for transformation and growth.\n\n– Jodie Gale\n\nThe more present we are to everything on our plate, the more we learn to digest and assimilate all the moments and magic and opportunities that life gives us each day.

Instead of outward growth and upward climb, life at times must turn inward and downward in order to grow in other ways. There is a shift to the vertical down that re-turns us to root memories, root metaphors, and timeless things that shape our lives from within. Slowing downwards creates opportunities to dwell more deeply in one’s life, for the home we are looking for in this world is within us all along. The lost home that we are seeking is ourselves; it is the story we carry within our soul.\n\n– Michael Meade\n\nYou’re afraid of changing.\n\nChange tenderly calls for you to open\n\nthe places within that have been guarded\n\nwith a warrior’s vigilance for decades.\n\nChange beckons you to come forward and\n\nview the inner landscapes that have been\n\nshrouded in mystery for years.\n\nChange won’t offer you promises or\n\nguarantees. But, as the rest of the world\n\nmoves along, the pages turn and others go\n\nforth all around, change whispers,\n\nI am still here and I have not forgotten you.\n\nIt is not too late to embrace change.\n\n– Susan Frybort, Open Passages\n\nNo matter how many enemies that one meets, no matter what they do, no matter who they are, not one of them exists without being dependent upon the internal enemy. For as long as there is grasping at ‘self’, there will always be ‘other’. The moment that the mind is rid of this, all enemies, both internal and external, will disappear.\n\n– Chamtrul Rinpoche\n\nThe humanism bypass. I did it for years. I saw glimpses of someone’s potential, their beautiful soul, their loving heart, and told myself that this was who they… truly were, ignoring all the rest. But the rest was what destroyed. The rest is where they lived most of the time. The rest was no illusion- it was them, too. This self-destructive pattern was birthed in two places: (1) my deep desire to see the best in my difficult parents. Not for them, but for me. I needed to believe that there was something kind and caring living inside of them; (2) a misplaced projection from my own self-concept work. I held the belief in my own potential, as a way of overcoming the shame I carried. But I made the mistake of assuming that everyone else was just as eager to find their light. Of course we all have glowing potential. At the core, we are all magnificent beings with profound capacities. But how many of us fully actualize it? At this stage of human development, not so many. The trick is to hold the space for two things at once- a deep belief in everyone’s possibilities, and a deep regard for your own well-being. It’s okay to pray for everyone’s liberation without joining them in prison. Pray from outside the prison walls, while taking exquisite care of yourself. It’s okay- you can’t do the work for them anyway. Boundaries, boundaries, boundaries… don’t leave home without them.\n\n– Jeff Brown\n\nThe peace of Nature gets into your heart ‘ere you are aware, without effort.\n\n– John Muir\n\nToday: Blessing\n\nby Irene Blair Honeycutt\n\nMay time grant you the lasting memory of the summer night\n\non Jonas Ridge when we were walking the dogs, late—\n\nthe white rail fence, our guide.\n\nWhen we turned back toward the cabin, darkness pressed\n\nagainst our faces\n\nand a host of fireflies flashed in the mist\n\nsettling on the fields,\n\nblinking green from another realm,\n\nlighting the divide between road and weeds.\n\nThe dogs looked up.\n\nFrenzied katydids took a rest.\n\nFollowing the tiny globes, we felt our way\n\nto the gravel hill that sloped\n\ntoward the yellow glow\n\nof lamplight from the cabin window.\n\n…We are a small earth. It’s no\n\nsimple thing. Eventually\n\nwe will be dust together; can be used to make a house, to stop\n\na flood or grow food\n\nfor those who will never remember who we were, or know\n\nthat we loved fiercely.\n\nLaughter and sadness eventually become the same song turning us\n\ntoward the nearest star —\n\na star constructed of eternity and elements of dust barely visible\n\nin the twilight as you travel\n\neast. I run with the blue horses of electricity who surround\n\nthe heart\n\nand imagine a promise made when no promise was possible.\n\n– Joy Harjo\n\nOur modern society creates so many young people without roots. They are uprooted from their families and their society; they wander around, not quite human beings, because they do not have roots.\n\n– Thich Nhat Hanh\n\nI learned that hearts, like flowers, cannot be rudely handled, but must open naturally…\n\n– Louisa May Alcott\n\nOne would never think of removing a single dead limb or log from these woods, such is the sense of fitness and completeness. In contemplating some lovely grove, I have wondered how if this dead stump or white mast were removed, would it be bettered. But I never could see room for even such paltry improvement. See the fineness of finish, how each object catches the light. And so, when we walk the aisle-like defiles of the woods over ridges, through meadows, and still, cool glens, we find each in perfect beauty, as if God had everywhere done His best in putting it in order that very day.\n\n– John Muir\n\nAround us, life bursts forth with miracles—a glass of water, a ray of sunshine, a leaf, a caterpillar, a flower, laughter, raindrops. If you live in awareness, it is easy to see miracles everywhere…\n\n– Thich Nhat Hanh\n\n…As if your place in the world mattered\n\nand the world could\n\nneither speak nor hear the fullness of\n\nits own bitter and beautiful cry\n\nwithout the deep well\n\nof your body resonating in the echo.\n\nKnowing that it takes only\n\nthat one, terrible\n\nword to make the circle complete,\n\nrevelation must be terrible\n\nknowing you can\n\nnever hide your voice again.\n\n– David Whyte\n\nConsidering how common illness is, how tremendous the spiritual change that it brings, how astonishing, when the lights of health go down, the undiscovered countries that are then disclosed, what wastes and deserts of the soul a slight attack of influenza brings to light, what precipices and lawns sprinkled with bright flowers a little rise of temperature reveals, what ancient and obdurate oaks are uprooted in us in the act of sickness, how we go down into the pit of death a…nd feel the waters of annihilation close above our heads and wake thinking to find ourselves in the presence of the angels and the harpers when we have a tooth out and come to the surface in the dentist’s arm chair and confuse his ‘Rinse the mouth—rinse the mouth’ with the greeting of the Deity stooping from the floor of Heaven to welcome us—when we think of this and infinitely more, as we are so frequently forced to think of it, it becomes strange indeed that illness has not taken its place with love, battle, and jealousy among the prime themes of literature.\n\n– Virginia Woolf\n\nTHE HEALTH OF US\n\n– Claudia Rankine, 2009\n\nWe heard health care and we thought public option\n\nwe thought reaching across the street across the lines\n\nacross the aisle was the manifestation of not a red state\n\nnot a blue state but these united states we thought\n\nwe could be sure of ourselves in this one way sure\n\nof our human element our basic decency\n\nand if justice was how love showed itself in public then love\n\nwas defined by access to care when someone anyone\n\nthought that cough that burned the chest\n\nwas probably nothing but who knew that fever\n\nafter three days that inability to breathe to sleep\n\nto wake in justice in love we thought\n\nwe were ready to be just as good to be better\n\nand despite all the ways we exist alone no one\n\nwould be on their own we were ready to take a stab\n\nat a kind of human kind of union we were ready to check-up\n\nto look after in this one way we were ready\n\nto care for each other we were ready to see\n\nour range of possibilities as a precious commodity\n\nto know every other as another to live in the width\n\nof our being and we weren’t ignorant or stupid or naïve\n\nor idealists or socialists or communists or Canadians\n\nwe understood the private options would still keep us\n\nalive longer we understood the private options\n\nwould treat the disease not the symptoms\n\nthe private options meant access to specialists\n\nto privacy to elective procedures to a team of doctors\n\nto radiology imaging to brand-name drugs we understood\n\nthe impossibility of real equality but this single shift\n\ntoward a national community we thought\n\ndespite being founded on genocide and sustained by slavery\n\nin God’s country we thought we were ready\n\nto see sanity inside the humanity we thought\n\nthe improbability of the face on capitol hill meant possibility.\n\nAt North Farm\n\nby John Ashbery\n\nSomewhere someone is traveling furiously toward you,\n\nAt incredible speed, traveling day and night,\n\nThrough blizzards and desert heat, across torrents, through narrow passes.\n\nBut will he know where to find you,\n\nRecognize you when he sees you,\n\nGive you the thing he has for you?\n\nHardly anything grows here,\n\nYet the granaries are bursting with meal,\n\nThe sacks of meal piled to the rafters.\n\nThe streams run with sweetness, fattening fish;\n\nBirds darken the sky.

Although I do not know your names, I can feel you out there.\n\n– David Abram\n\nTHE ARRIVAL OF THE PAST\n\nYou wake wanting the dream\n\nyou left behind in sleep,\n\nwater washing through everything,\n\nclearing away sediment\n\nof years, uncovering the lost\n\nand forgotten. You hear the sun\n\nbreaking on cold grass,\n\non eaves, on stone steps\n\noutside. You see light\n\nigniting sparks of dust\n\nin the air. You feel for the first\n\ntime in years the world\n\nelectrified with morning.\n\nYou know something has changed\n\nin the night, something you thought\n\ngone from the world has come back:\n\nshooting stars in the pasture,\n\nsleeping beneath a field\n\nof daisies, wisteria climbing\n\nover fences, houses, trees.\n\nThis is a place that smells\n\nlike childhood and old age.\n\nIt is a limb you swung from,\n\na field you go back to.\n\nIt is a part of whatever you do.\n\n– Scott Owens\n\nThe happiest day I ever had was any day when I woke in the morning when I was a boy and I did not have to go to school or to work. In the morning I was always hungry when I woke and I could smell the dew in the grass and hear the wind in the high branches of the hemlock trees, if there was a wind, and if there was no wind I could hear the quietness of the forest and the calmness of the lake and I would listen for the first noises of morning. Sometimes the first noise would be a kingfisher flying over the water that was so calm it mirrored his reflection and he made a clattering cry as he flew. Sometimes it would be a squirrel chittering in one of the trees outside the house, his tail jerking each time he made a noise. Often it would be the plover calling on the hillside. But whenever I woke and heard the first morning noises and felt hungry and knew I would not have to go to school nor have to work, I was happier than I have ever been.\n\n– Ernest Hemingway\n\nPRELUDE\n\nWaking up is a parachute jump from dreams.\n\nFree of the suffocating turbulence the traveler\n\nsinks toward the green zone of morning.\n\nThings flare up. From the viewpoint of the quivering lark\n\nhe is aware of the huge root systems of the trees,\n\ntheir swaying underground lamps. But above ground\n\nthere’s greenery – a tropical flood of it – with\n\nlifted arms, listening\n\nto the beat of an invisible pump. And he\n\nsinks toward summer, is lowered\n\nin it’s dazzling crater, down\n\nthrough shafts of green damp ages\n\ntrembling under the sun’s turbine. Then it’s checked,\n\nthis straight-down journey through the moment, and the wings spread\n\nto the osprey’s repose above rushing waters.\n\nThe bronze-age trumpet’s\n\noutlawed note\n\nhovers above the bottomless depths.\n\nIn day’s first hours consciousness can grasp the world\n\nas the hand grips a sun-warmed stone.\n\nThe traveler is standing under a tree. After\n\nthe crash through death’s turbulence, shall\n\na great light unfold above his head?\n\n– Tomas Tranströmer\n\nLong, long ago, before I was a tormented artist, afflicted with longing yet incapable of forming durable attachments, long before this, I was a glorious ruler uniting all of a divided country – so I was told by the fortune-teller who examined my palm. Great things, she said, are ahead of you, or perhaps behind you; it is difficult to be sure. And yet, she added, what is the difference? Right now you are a child holding hands with a fortune-teller. All the rest is hypothesis and dream.\n\n– Louise Glück\n\nI step out and suddenly notice this.\n\nSummer arrives, has arrived, is arriving.\n\nBirds grow less than leaves although they cheep, dip, arc, a call across the tall fence from an invisible neighbor to his child is heard right down to the secret mood and the child also hears.\n\nOne hears in the silence that follows the great desire for approval and love which summer holds aloft, all damp leeched from it like a thing floating out on a frail but perfect twig end.\n\nLight seeming to darken in it yet glow.\n\nPlease, it says, but not with the eager and need of spring.\n\nCome what may, says summer, smack in the middle I will stand and breathe, the future is a super fluidity I do not taste, no, there is no numbering here, it is a gorgeous swelling, no emotion, as in this love is no emotions, no, also no memory. We have it all now and all there ever was is us now.\n\n– Jorie Graham\n\nThe individual is capable of both great compassion and great indifference. We have it within our means to nourish the former and outgrow the latter.\n\n– Norman Cousins\n\nI don’t know why I started writing. I don’t know why anybody does it. Maybe they’re bored, or failures at something else.\n\n– Cormac McCarthy\n\nI know those habits that can ruin your life\n\nStill send their invitations.\n\n– Hafiz\n\nI never tell [students] to try to perfect something because the word ‘perfect,’ like the word ‘gift,’ is a very tricky word, and we don’t really know what those words mean. Shakespeare’s not perfect, and James Joyce is not perfect. So the idea is to have energy and momentum and originality, and a verve and a voice that’s original that people are interested in. Doesn’t have to be perfect. In fact, nobody wants perfection. I think it was Sylvia Plath [who said] perfection has no children.\n\n– Joyce Carol Oates\n\nIslander I brought you here to speak a language you have little care for, to play the pipes, perhaps, or at least to sing, but it is rock you listened to back and forth from school. As you leave I see you belong here in ways I hadn’t thought of: your loyalty to your friends, your inability to sneer or boast, and now your tears, and I am proud.\n\n– Meg Bateman, Transparencies\n\nBe gentle to all, and stern with yourself.\n\n* …\n\nUntilled soil, however fertile it may be, will bear thistles and thorns; and so it is with man’s mind.\n\n*\n\nIt is foolish to think that we will enter heaven without entering into ourselves.\n\n*\n\nMore tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones.\n\n*\n\nThe closer one approaches to God, the simpler one becomes.\n\n– St Teresa of Avila\n\nThe Buddha’s nirvana is not a drive toward death or disintegration as Freud naively assumed; it is an ability to accept death and disintegration without falling apart; without twisting, distorting, or tormenting the mind in response.\n\n– Mark Epstein, M.D.\n\nWhat is the relation of [contemplation] to action? Simply this. He who attempts to act and do things for others or for the world without deepening his own self-understanding, freedom, integrity, and capacity to love, will not have anything to give others. He will communicate to them nothing but the contagion of his own obsessions, his aggressiveness, his ego-centered ambitions, his delusions about ends and means, his doctrinaire prejudices and ideas. There is nothing more tragic in the modern world than the misuse of power and action.\n\n– THOMAS MERTON\n\nMusic, feelings of happiness, mythology, faces worn by time, certain twilights and certain places, want to tell us something, or they told us something that we should not have missed, or they are about to tell us something; this imminence of a revelation that is not produced is, perhaps, ‘the aesthetic event’. …\n\n– Jorge Luis Borges\n\nAs a single footstep will not make a Path on the Earth, so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we walk again and again. To make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives.\n\n– Henry David Thoreau\n\nSunday Morning Early\n\nby David Romtvedt\n\nMy daughter and I paddle red kayaks\n\nacross the lake. Pulling hard,…\n\nwe slip through the water.\n\nFar from either shore,\n\nmy daughter is a young woman\n\nand suddenly everything is a metaphor\n\nfor how short a time we are granted:\n\nthe red boats on the blue black water,\n\nthe russet and gold of late summer’s grasses,\n\nthe empty sky. We stop and listen to the stillness.\n\nI say, “It’s Sunday, and here we are\n\nin the church of the out of doors,”\n\nthen wish I’d kept quiet. That’s the trick in life—\n\nlearning to leave well enough alone.\n\nOur boats drift to where the chirring\n\nof grasshoppers reaches us from the rocky hills.\n\nA clap of thunder. I want to say something truer\n\nthan I love you. I want my daughter to know that,\n\nthrough her, I live a life that was closed to me.\n\nI paddle up, lean out, and touch her hand.\n\nI start to speak then stop.\n\nResponsibility to yourself means that you don’t fall for shallow and easy solutions–predigested books and ideas…marrying early as an escape from real decisions, getting pregnant as an evasion of already existing problems. It means that you refuse to sell your talents and aspirations short…and this, in turn, means resisting the forces in society which say that women should be nice, play safe, have low professional expectations, drown in love and forget about work, live t…hrough others, and stay in the places assigned to us. It means that we insist on a life of meaningful work, insist that work be as meaningful as love and friendship in our lives. It means, therefore, the courage to be “different”…The difference between a life lived actively, and a life of passive drifting and dispersal of energies, is an immense difference. Once we begin to feel committed to our lives, responsible to ourselves, we can never again be satisfied with the old, passive way.\n\n– Adrienne Rich\n\nIf you want to know about reincarnation, start by trying to rebirth yourself …\n\nIt only takes a moment for metabolism to rearrange itself in response to the thoughts and feelings that inhabit our inner world.\n\n– Marc David\n\nTHE HEALTH OF US\n\n– Claudia Rankine, 2009\n\nWe heard health care and we thought public option\n\nwe thought reaching across the street across the lines…\n\nacross the aisle was the manifestation of not a red state\n\nnot a blue state but these united states we thought\n\nwe could be sure of ourselves in this one way sure\n\nof our human element our basic decency\n\nand if justice was how love showed itself in public then love\n\nwas defined by access to care when someone anyone\n\nthought that cough that burned the chest\n\nwas probably nothing but who knew that fever\n\nafter three days that inability to breathe to sleep\n\nto wake in justice in love we thought\n\nwe were ready to be just as good to be better\n\nand despite all the ways we exist alone no one\n\nwould be on their own we were ready to take a stab\n\nat a kind of human kind of union we were ready to check-up\n\nto look after in this one way we were ready\n\nto care for each other we were ready to see\n\nour range of possibilities as a precious commodity\n\nto know every other as another to live in the width\n\nof our being and we weren’t ignorant or stupid or naïve\n\nor idealists or socialists or communists or Canadians\n\nwe understood the private options would still keep us\n\nalive longer we understood the private options\n\nwould treat the disease not the symptoms\n\nthe private options meant access to specialists\n\nto privacy to elective procedures to a team of doctors\n\nto radiology imaging to brand-name drugs we understood\n\nthe impossibility of real equality but this single shift\n\ntoward a national community we thought\n\ndespite being founded on genocide and sustained by slavery\n\nin God’s country we thought we were ready\n\nto see sanity inside the humanity we thought\n\nthe improbability of the face on capitol hill meant possibility.\n\nAMERICA BEREFT\n\nOh America\n\nhave you buried your true longing\n\nbeside Native ancestors…\n\nand broken black slave bodies?\n\nOh America\n\nhas your thirst for the mall\n\nblinded you\n\nto the hunger for soul?\n\nOh America\n\nhas positivity and light\n\nso enchanted you\n\nthat you no longer see the treasures below\n\nin the shadow of your exceptionalism?\n\nOh America\n\nlet go of your ambitions today\n\nsit beside the gravestone of your dreams\n\nand grieve.\n\n– David Bedrick\n\nNothing happens until the pain of remaining the same outweighs the pain of change.’\n\n– Arthur Burt\n\nRespect builds trust, healthy empathy, and moral character; it lends dignity to our human relationships and our relationship with our earth.\n\n– Roshi Joan Halifax\n\nA TRUE TEACHER\n\nIf you have made all I have given you your own so that no trace of me is left in them, then you have understood. And I can be silent again, knowing I have done my part.\n\n– from a letter to Lizelle Reymond, author of “To Live Within,” from her teacher Sri Anirvan.\n\nPlease be careful in the future to pay attention. Karma can be very subtle and tricky. We might think that something is no big deal, but it may turn out to have… serious consequences. So pay good attention to the karmic process. This is what every practitioner needs to pay attention to — even those with the highest realization.\n\n– Dudjom Rinpoche\n\nThe Eros of Thought\n\nYour mind is the double mirror of the outer world and of your inner world. It is always actively making pictures of things. If you lost your mind, you would lose your world as well. Your mind is so precious and vulnerable precisely because it holds your world. Thoughts are the furniture of the mind. They are the echoes and pictures that hold your world together. This is the fascinating adventure of perception. When you become aware of your thoughts and your particular style of thinking, you begin to see why your world is shaped the way it is. It is an exciting and frightening moment to realize your responsibility for your own thoughts. Then you know that you also have the freedom to think differently. Rather than having to travel always along a predetermined track of thought, you now begin to realize the excitement of thinking in new directions and in different rhythms. You see that thinking has something eternal in it. In the Western tradition, thought has been understood as the place within the human person where we are most intimately connected with divinity. Thought is the place of revelation. The dance of thoughts is endless. In his essay on John Donne, T. S. Eliot suggests that a thought to him was an experience as immediate as the scent of a flower.\n\nThought is a profound form of longing. Much of the thought that cripples us is dried out, dead thought. There is no warmth of longing alive in it. Thought that loses touch with feeling is lethal. This separation is the fracture from which fascism and holocaust emerge. Knowledge is intimacy. This is most evident in the activity of friendship. When the longing awakens between you and a stranger, you want to know that person—to come close. Closeness without knowing can be either a fascination and reverence for mystery or the prostitution of longing. Spiritual longing is what first draws you close to a friend. This desire refines and deepens itself in coming to know him or her. Friendship is one of the most beautiful places in which longing reaches initial fulfillment and is then further deepened, refined, and transfigured. You can also see the longing of thought in the fascination of ideas. When you find yourself in a cul-de-sac in your life and you feel lost and trapped, a new insight or awareness can come to you, enabling you to free yourself.\n\n– John O’Donohue, Echoes of Eternity\n\nQuestions are the piety of thought.\n\n– Heidegger\n\nbe a scar. do not be ashamed of living through something.\n\n– Nayyirah Waheed\n\nBe a brilliant light,\n\nEven in the darkest of night.\n\nDazzle like a firefly,\n\nOr sprinkle fairy dust……\n\nEither way, there will be light to trust.\n\nShine on the earth all around,\n\nAnd always make a joyful sound.\n\nBelieve in peace and love,\n\nSo The Now will be like Heaven above.\n\nHonor and trust beautiful life flow,\n\nTo make the path forward glow.\n\nForget not lessons from the past,\n\nAnd cherish every day until the last.\n\n– Sarah Melby\n\nThe individual is capable of both great compassion and great indifference. We have it within our means to nourish the former and outgrow the latter.\n\n– Norman Cousins\n\nKnow the ways of the ones who take care of you, so that you may take care of them.\n\n-Introduce yourself. Be accountable as the one who comes asking for life. Ask permission before taking. Abide by the answer.\n\n-Never take the first. Never take the last. Take only what you need.\n\n-Take only that which is given.\n\n-Never take more than half. Leave some for others. Harvest in a way that minimizes harm.\n\n-Use it respectfully. Never waste what you have taken.\n\n-Share.\n\n-Give thanks for what you have been given.\n\n-Give a gift, in reciprocity for what you have taken.\n\n-Sustain the ones who sustain you and the earth will last forever.\n\n– Robin Wall Kimmerer, Braiding Sweetgrass\n\nThe Sanctimonious Poets\n\nI’m sick of you hypocrites babbling about gods!\n\nRationality is what you have, you don’t believe\n\nIn Helios, nor the sea being, nor the thunder being;\n\nAnd the earth is a corpse, so why thank her?\n\nAs for you gods, be calm! You are decorations in their poems,\n\nEven though the energy has drained out of you names.\n\nAnd, Mother of Nature, if a word with immense\n\nenergy is needed, people remember yours.\n\n– Friedrich Holderlin\n\ntranslated by Robert Bly\n\nThe point of slowing downwards is stopping in time to catch one’s own rhythm in order to change life from within. Only by stopping time can we find that which is timeless and enduring and able to help us renew our lives and, in time, help the world turn around as well. Whether the issue is a problem in one’s own life or the course of life itself, in order to stop things in time, to make meaningful changes, we must stop time itself.\n\n– Michael Meade\n\nWe need the other half of the world, the world of the shadow, the inside of things.\n\n– C. G. Jung, Dream Analysis\n\nI thought my friends were damn fools, because they didn’t know any better way of conducting their lives. Still they conformed better than I to a code. I wanted to conform but I couldn’t so I wrote my poetry.\n\n– William Carlos Williams\n\nWe need to strengthen the conviction that we are one single human family. There are no frontiers or barriers, political or social, behind which we can hide, still less is there room for the globalization of indifference.\n\n– Pope Francis\n\nThe fact that the word ‘revolution’ originally meant restoration is more than a mere oddity of semantics.\n\n– Hannah Arendt\n\nChoose your leaders with wisdom and forethought. To be led by a coward is to be controlled by all that the coward fears. To be led by a fool is to be led by the opportunists who control the fool. To be led by a thief is to offer up your most precious treasures to be stolen. To be led by a liar is to ask to be lied to. To be led by a tyrant is to sell yourself and those you love into slavery.\n\n– Octavia E. Butler\n\nFoolish, selfish people are always thinking of themselves and the result is always negative. Wise persons think of others, helping them as much as they can, and the result is happiness. Love and compassion are beneficial both for you and others. Through your kindness to others, your mind and heart will open to peace.\n\n– Dalai Lama\n\nA wise\n\nand wisdom-filled evening to you!\n\nI not only look up to\n\nthe Elders and Mentors\n\nI have around me in my life,\n\nI look over to them,\n\naround them,\n\ndown to them,\n\nand equally parallel to them.\n\nWhat makes a mentor\n\na mentor?\n\nAge, and wisdom, and experience\n\ncertainly make for a good mentor.\n\nBut when I ask a child\n\nhow and why they can be\n\nso full of exorbitant energy\n\nand happiness,\n\nand they give to me\n\ntheir reasoning,\n\ndoes that make them my mentor\n\nin that moment?\n\nWhen I ask my partner\n\nhow it is they know how to love\n\nor cook so well,\n\nand they explain to me their answer,\n\ndoes that make them my mentor\n\nin that moment?\n\nWhen I ask of my roommate\n\nfor advice on a subject\n\nthat he happens to have\n\na lot more knowledge and education on,\n\nregardless of him being younger than me,\n\ndoes that make him my mentor\n\nin that moment?\n\nAnd when my neighbor\n\nwho is older than me\n\nasks me for consultation\n\non a remodel project\n\nthat he is undertaking on his own,\n\nand since construction is my business\n\nand I happen to know\n\nmore about remodeling than he does,\n\ndoes that make me his mentor\n\nin that moment?\n\nI say the answer\n\nto all of those questions\n\nis YES.\n\nWe all,\n\nregardless of age or gender,\n\nhave the capacity to be mentors\n\nat any given time\n\nand to any potential person.\n\nMentorship, in my humble opinion,\n\nis ignited by the person\n\nwho seeks to have the knowledge\n\nwhich is already in possession\n\nby the person being asked.\n\nAnd a mentor is a person,\n\nany person,\n\nwho happens to have the knowledge\n\nand experience sought after,\n\nbut who is willing to share it.\n\nEvery single one of us\n\nhas the capacity and potential\n\nto be a mentor\n\nat any given moment.\n\nAnd when we ask of others,\n\nwe are asking for mentorship.\n\nWe are all mentors,\n\nand we are all mentored.\n\nWhen needed,\n\nmay we all be humble\n\nand vulnerable enough\n\nto ask for mentorship.\n\nAnd when given the opportunity,\n\nmay we all be humble\n\nand loving enough\n\nto be a mentor.\n\nIt may be a give and take world,\n\nbut it is also\n\na give and ask world.\n\nIn other words,\n\nlet us love and be loved,\n\nand let us all be in realization\n\nof our need for each other.\n\nWild be. 🍁\n\n– Leaf Running-Rabbit\n\nOrphans are not people who have no parents: they are people who don’t know their parents, who cannot go to them. Ours is a culture built upon the ruthless foundation of mass migration, but it is more so now a culture of people unable to say who their people are. In that way we are, relentlessly, orphans. Being an orphan culture does not mean that we have no wisdom. But wisdom is being confused in our time with information. Wisdom is an achievement, hard earned and faithfully paid for; it’s not a possession….An orphan wisdom might be the only culture-making thing we can rightly, honourably, or faithfully claim. There is immense grief in knowing this well and going towards it anyway. That grief could be our way of working now, our labour. It could be our beauty, too.\n\n– Stephen Jenkinson, Orphan Wisdom\n\nTo search for small things worn by the deep is to be a poet.\n\n– Mark Nepo, The Way Under the Way\n\nMost of us achieve only at rare moments a clear realization of the fact that they have never tasted the fulfillment of existence, that their life does not participate in true, fulfilled existence, that, as it were, it passes true existence by. We nevertheless feel the deficiency at every moment, and in some measure try to find—somewhere—what we are seeking. Somewhere, in some province of the world or of the mind, except (accept? np) where we stand, where we have been set—but it is there and nowhere else that the treasure can be found. The environment which I feel to be the natural one, the situation which has been assigned to me as my fate, the things that happen to me day after day—these contain my essential task and such fulfillment of existence as is open to me. It is said of a certain Talmudic master that the paths of heaven were as bright to him as the streets of his native town. Hasidism inverts the order: It is a greater thing if the streets of a man’s native town are as bright to him as the paths of heaven. For it is here, where we stand, that we should try to make shine the light of the hidden divine life.\n\n– Martin Buber\n\nUnless it is stopped, the dominant culture will kill everything on the planet, or at least everything it can.\n\nEach holocaust is unique. The destruction of the European Jewry did not look like the destruction of the American Indians. It could not, because the technologies involved were not the same, the targets were not the same, and the perpetrators were not the same. They shared motivations and certain aspects of their socialization, to be sure, but they were not the same. Similarly, the slaughter of Armenians (and Kurds) by Turks did not (and does not) look like the slaughter of Vietnamese by Americans. And just as similarly, the holocausts of the twenty-first century will not and do not already look like the great holocausts of the twentieth. They cannot, because this society has progressed.\n\nAnd every holocaust looks different depending on the class to which the\n\nobserver belongs. The Holocaust looked far different to high ranking Nazi officials and to executives of large corporations—both of whose primary social concerns would have been how to maximize production and control, that is, how to most effectively exploit human and nonhuman resources—than it did to good Germans, whose primary concerns were as varied as the people themselves but probably included doing their own jobs—immoral as those jobs may have been from an outside perspective—as well as possible; may have included feelings of relief that those in power were finally doing something about the “Jewish Problem”; and certainly included doing whatever they could to not\n\nnotice the greasy smoke from the crematoria (constructed with the best materials and faultless workmanship). The Holocaust then also looked different to\n\ngood Germans than it did to those who resisted, whose main concerns may have been how to bring down the system. And it looked different to those who resisted than it did to those who were considered untermenschen, whose main concerns may have been staying alive, or failing that, dying with humanity.\n\nManifest Destiny looked different to Indians than it did to JP Morgan. American slavery looked different to slaves than it did to those whose comforts and elegancies were based on slavery, and than it did to those for whom free black labor drove down their wages.\n\nWhat will the great holocausts of the twenty-first century will look like? It depends on where you stand. Look around.\n\nIf you’re in group one, one of those in power, your post-modern holocausts will be at most barely visible, and at least a price you’re willing to pay, as Madame Albright said about killing Iraqi children. The holocausts will probably share similarities with other holocausts, as you attempt to maximize production—to “grow the economy,” as you might say—and as when necessary you attempt to eradicate dissent. This means the holocaust will look like a\n\nbooming economy beset by shifting problems that somehow always keep you\n\nfrom ever reaching the Promised Land, whatever that might be. The holocaust will look like numbers on ledgers. It will look like technical problems to be solved, whether those problems are increasing your access to necessary resources, dealing with global warming, calming unrest on the streets, or figuring out what to do about too many unproductive people on land you know\n\nyou could put to better use. The holocaust will look like houses with gates, limousines with bullet-proof glass, and a military budget that can never stop increasing.\n\nThe holocaust will feel like economics. It will feel like progress. It will feel like technological innovation. It will feel like civilization. It will feel like the way things are.\n\nIf you’re in the second group, the good Germans, you will continue to be co-opted into supporting the system that does not serve you well. Perhaps the holocaust will look like a new car. Perhaps it will look like lending your talents to a major corporation—or more broadly toward economic production—so you can make a better life for your children. Perhaps it will look like working as an engineer for Shell or on an assembly line for General Motors. Maybe it will look like basing a person’s value on her or his employability or productivity. Perhaps it will look like anger at Mexicans or Pakistanis or Algerians or Hmong who compete with you for jobs. Perhaps it will look like outrage at environmentalists who want to save some damn suckerfish, even (or especially) if it impinges on your property rights, or if it takes water you need to irrigate, to make the desert bloom, to make the desert productive. Maybe it will feel like continuing to do a job that you hate—and that requires so little of your humanity—because no\n\nmatter how you try, you never can seem to catch up. Maybe it will feel like being tired at the end of the day, and just wanting to sit and watch some television.”\n\n– Derrick Jensen\n\nThe journey to enlightenment involves shedding not collecting. It’s a continual process of opening and surrender, like taking off layer after layer of clothes, until we’re completely naked, with nothing to hide. But we can’t just pretend, making a big display of disrobing, then putting everything back on when no one’s looking. Our surrender has to be genuine.\n\n– Pema\n\nDEEPER BOND\n\nScathing tears set and takes no rest in silvery moon\n\nLit up because their bond was deeper and free it will never touch venom\n\nI will illuminate this world, its inner peace and spirituality lashes of the eyes\n\nThe depressed night even more than enough to brighten up my night\n\nUntil the morning sun begins to rise and I sing a song\n\nOur love story got backtracked tranquillity\n\nResting her head,\n\nFreed spirit over this shadow realm surreal\n\nI will let you carry me, as long I can catch your volatile dreams\n\nWish the illusion of division, you stay your course\n\nAnd never stray the other side of the moon.\n\n– Dr. Brajesh Kumar Gupta\n\nBe patient with yourself. Self-growth is tender; it’s holy ground. There’s no greater investment.\n\n– Stephen Covey\n\nDo you know what the Sacred is? It is that which serves as your partner in your search for the highest and deepest things.\n\n– Brendan Myers\n\nIf we only use the Dharma to judge and look for faults in others, and never in ourselves, it is entirely missing the point of what it’s intended for.\n\nEven if we find just a single fault in our own mind, it will bring us an infinite amount more benefit than doing nothing other than finding all of the faults in others.\n\n– Chamtrul Rinpoche\n\nThe planet is sick, in nature and culture, in need of urgent care from each of us.\n\n– Thomas Moore\n\nFriendship is a sheltering tree\n\n– Coleridge\n\nMay you in your innocence\n\nSail through this to that\n\n– Lucille Cliffton\n\nThe pith instruction is, Stay. . . stay. . . just stay.\n\n– Pema Chödrön on meditation.\n\nPlease, no more!\n\n~ Prayer of a spiritual worrier\n\nBring it on!\n\n~ Mantra of a spiritual warrior\n\nThe lonely child who travels through\n\nThe fearful waste and desolate fields,\n\nAnd listens to their barren tune,\n\nGreets as an unknown and best friend\n\nThe terror in him, and he sings\n\nIn darkness all the sweetest songs.\n\n– Chögyam Trungpa\n\nListening by Rumi\n\nWhat is the deep listening? Sama is\n\na greeting from the secret ones inside\n\nthe heart, a letter. The branches of\n\nyour intelligence grows new leaves in\n\nthe wind of this listening. The body\n\nreaches a peace. Rooster sound comes,\n\nreminding you of your love for dawn,\n\nThe reed flute and the singer’s lips:\n\nThe knack of how spirit breathes into\n\nus becomes as simple and ordinary as\n\nEating and drinking. The dead rise with\n\nthe pleasure of listening. If someone\n\nCan’t hear a trumpet melody, sprinkle\n\ndirt on his head and declare him dead.\n\nListen, and feel the beauty of your\n\nseparation, the unsayable absence.\n\nThere’s a moon inside every human being.\n\nLearn to be companions with it. Give\n\nmore of your life to this listening. As\n\nbrightness is to time, so you are to\n\nthe one who talks to the deep ear in\n\nyour chest. I should sell my tongue\n\nand buy a thousand ears when that\n\none steps near and begins to speak.\n\nAnything you are not willing to experience and open as, you will repeatedly confront. If you are afraid to feel anger, if you are unwilling to love as anger and dissolve open as anger, then you will continually struggle with anger in yourself and others. If you are afraid to feel, love, and open as insecurity, then you will necessitate threats to your security. Your very recoil will sustain the ripples of that which you fear, necessitating a confrontation with whatever you are unwilling to fully feel, be alive as, and open as.\n\n– David Deida\n\nThe positive energy and love we give to others, heals our own wounds.\n\n– Angie Karan\n\nPerhaps that you’re searching far too much? That in all that searching, you don’t find the time for finding?\n\n– Hermann Hesse, Siddhartha\n\nEither you look and see beyond language – as a first perception – or you see the world through the filter of your thoughts, by talking to yourself. Everyone knows what it is like to feel things directly. Intense emotions… don’t have a language. They are too intense in the first flash… Synchronizing mind and body is looking and seeing directly beyond language… you can see on the spot with wakefulness. Your eyes begin to open wider and wider, and you see that the world is colorful and fresh and so precise, every sharp angle is fantastic.\n\n– Shambhala Sacred Path of the Warrior pg 41\n\nLet us tenderly and kindly cherish, therefore, the means of knowledge. Let us dare to read, think, speak, and write.\n\n– John Adams\n\nWhen your mind drifts away from the dharma, that’s the demon. A demon is not something with a large, open mouth and fiery eyes.\n\nIf you have no confidence in the dharma, if you do not persevere in the dharma and only think about passing your whole life comfortably, you have a more dangerous demon right in your own mind.\n\n– Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche-Pith I\n\nSome moments in a life, and they needn’t be very long or seem very important, can make up for so much in that life; can redeem, justify, that pain, that bewilderment, with which one lives, and invest one with the courage not only to endure it, but to profit from it; some moments teach one the price of human connection: if one can live with one’s own pain, then one respects the pain of others, and so, briefly, but transcendentally, we can release each other from pain.\n\n– James Baldwin\n\nIf boundaries are created\n\nThen brotherhood becomes a mere eleven lettered word\n\nNo feelings of belonging remain\n\nWhen we perceive each other with an air of disdain\n\nAnd our pride becomes a concrete wall\n\nDividing us\n\nAnd poetry dies an untimely death\n\nWhen segregation sets in..\n\nIf my thoughts are mere words\n\nLost forever in the haze of separate identities\n\nThen my feelings are just worthless rantings of a lonely soul\n\nForever mocked, laughed at and made fun of\n\nAnd then poetry dies an untimely death\n\nWhen segregation sets in…\n\nIf we are not able to bridge this gap that we created\n\nAnd words and feelings take you further away from me\n\nThen I shall write no more\n\nAnd my poetry dies an untimely death…\n\n– Anita Limbu Moktan\n\nStrive to be uncynical, to be a hope-giving force, to be a steward of substance.\n\n– Maria Popova\n\nWhat we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.\n\n– Otto Rank\n\nIN GRATITUDE FOR SURVIVORS\n\nThe most psychologically and morally intelligent people I have met have suffered powerful challenges, hurts, abuse, and dehumanization and have found a way through to their own gifts, humanity, creativity and purpose. I believe these are the teachers we most need today – the ones who can help right the ship. Thank you, thank you, thank you for ever educating me and modeling profound courage.\n\n– David Bedrick\n\nI’m working on the world,\n\nrevised, improved edition,\n\nfeaturing fun for fools,\n\nblues for brooders,\n\ncombs for bald pates,\n\ntricks for old dogs.\n\nHere’s one chapter: The Speech\n\nof Animals and Plants.\n\nEach species comes, of course,\n\nwith its own dictionary.\n\nEven a simple “Hi there,”\n\nwhen traded with a fish,\n\nmake both the fish and you\n\nfeel quite extraordinary.\n\nThe long-suspected meanings\n\nof rustlings, chirps, and growls!\n\nSoliloquies of forests!\n\nThe epic hoot of owls!\n\nThose crafty hedgehogs drafting\n\naphorisms after dark,\n\nwhile we blindly believe\n\nthey are sleeping in the park!\n\nTime (Chapter Two) retains\n\nits sacred right to meddle\n\nin each earthly affair.\n\nStill, time’s unbounded power\n\nthat makes a mountain crumble,\n\nmoves seas, rotates a star,\n\nwon’t be enough to tear\n\nlovers apart: they are\n\ntoo naked, too embraced,\n\ntoo much like timid sparrows.\n\nOld age is, in my book,\n\nthe price that felons pay,\n\nso don’t whine that it’s steep:\n\nyou’ll stay young if you’re good.\n\nSuffering (Chapter Three)\n\ndoesn’t insult the body.\n\nDeath? It comes in your sleep,\n\nexactly as it should.\n\nWhen it comes, you’ll be dreaming\n\nthat you don’t need to breathe;\n\nthat breathless silence is\n\nthe music of the dark\n\nand it’s part of the rhythm\n\nto vanish like a spark.\n\nOnly a death like that. A rose\n\ncould prick you harder, I suppose;\n\nyou’d feel more terror at the sound\n\nof petals falling to the ground.\n\nOnly a world like that. To die\n\njust that much. And to live just so.\n\nAnd all the rest is Bach’s fugue, played\n\nfor the time being\n\non a saw.\n\n– Wislawa Szymborska\n\nAll good poets of the past, almost without exception, were at least bilingual if not trilingual.\n\n– Helen Vendler\n\nIn the future, brave men and women will write a Declaration of Interdependence that will be read and honored alongside the Declaration of Independence: proof of our evolution, revolution of our own growth and understanding. The open space of democracy provides justice for ALL living things – plants, animals, rocks, and rivers, as well as human beings. It is a landscape that encourages diversity and discourages conformity.\n\n– Terry Tempest Williams\n\nA person must be highly sensitive to attune to multiple and opposing domains: the nuanced thinker is condemned to walk the razors edge. We become an unemployed Samurai when we swallow both the red pill and the blue pill – the empirical and the mythical, to put it in another way. The unemployed Samurai swallows the whole of life in other words: the good, the bad and the ugly. He is not a social jus…tice warrior particularly: he fights for his own soul. This means must set himself strait before he pretends to set the community strait and decry the injustices of the world. It’s a question of becoming responsible and truthful as an individual, which might mean losing a few friends along the way or spending some time in the wilderness. If you don’t support your friends in their social warrior trip — or conservatism trip or science trip or religion trip or whatever they may be on for that matter — then that ‘friend’ might not have any more use for you. If you are not interested in ‘trips’ but in actual voyages, in deep truth rather than ideology, then you could become a pariah. But it’s worth it, and the alternative is grim.\n\n– Andrew Sweeny\n\nOn Compassion\n\nCompassion for others isn’t an abstract feeling you cultivate in your heart out of nowhere.\n\nWhen I see people speak about compassion in that way i…t’s usually denial, spiritual bypassing and a deep discomfort with being angry. Compassion isn’t a cause. It’s an effect. It’s not a phenomenon. It’s an epiphenomenon. It’s not the seed. It’s the the fruit.\n\nReal compassion never begins with the decision to ‘be compassionate’. Real compassion usually starts with some level of anger or judgment about the actions of another. We see them as a perpetrator. We demonize them. We label them. We write them off. We ask ourselves, “How could they have done that?”\n\nAnd then comes the learning – almost always unasked for, almost always unwelcome. And what is the learning about? It’s about what they had to go through to get to where they are today. It’s about learning all the ways in which they were victimized by life and defeated by forces and institutions so much bigger than them.\n\nCompassion sounds less like, “I forgive you,” and more like, “Fuck… you never had a chance. My God.” We ask ourselves, “How could they not have done that?”\n\nSelf-compassion comes from the same place. It begins with a fierce and burning self-hatred and shame for all the things you’ve done and not done and then, if you’re lucky, you come to realize that, given what was going on in your life, given what happened in the life of your parents and community, given what happened in the lives of your ancestors… you never had a chance either. And that is nothing but heartbreaking to see. You got let down by your culture. But it’s also a relief. You give yourself a fucking break for not being able to, all by yourself, stand up to the evils, poverties and oppressions of your day. This kind of learning is the breaking of the spell of competence (that you should always know what to do and do it well) and self-sufficiency (all by yourself).\n\nCompassion doesn’t come from a decision to be compassionate. That’s where repression comes from. It comes from learning.\n\nIn seeing this all, you see what was missing and, in seeing this, the world has a chance to be different. You wake up one day and you see that you might have some role to play in changing those things. You might have a role to play in making sure the next generation has a better shot than you did.\n\n– Tad Hargrave\n\nThis is my letter to the world,\n\nThat never wrote to me,–\n\nThe simple news that Nature told,\n\nWith tender majesty.\n\nHer message is committed …\n\nTo hands I cannot see;\n\nFor love of her, sweet countrymen,\n\nJudge tenderly of me!\n\n– Emily Dickinson\n\nWhoever told people that mind is opinions, thoughts, ideas, and consciousness? No. Mind is roof-tiles, fence-posts, tire-wheels, carriages, rocks, water, and clouds.\n\n– Dogen-zenji, via Gary Snyder\n\nAll my ancient twisted karma\n\nFrom beginningless greed, hate and delusion,\n\nBorn of body, speech and mind,\n\nI now fully atone.\n\n– Gatha of atonement, recited each morning and during the Fusatsu ceremony of renewing the precepts, performed on the full moon\n\nTo lead a life that goes beyond pettiness and prejudice and always wanting to make sure that everything turns out on our own terms, to lead a more passionate, full, and delightful life than that, we must realize we can endure a lot of pain and pleasure for the sake of finding out who we are and what this world is.\n\n– Pema Chödrön\n\nIf you can’t liberate yourself, who else will liberate you?\n\nIt you can’t train yourself, who else will train you?\n\nSo, pointing your finger at your own heart —\n\nAgain and again, train your own three doors in the Dharma!\n\n– Khenpo Ngakchung\n\nI’m lucky enough to occasionally be able to do something I love – write poems – and unlucky enough that what I love confuses and overwhelms me.\n\n– Mary Ruefle\n\nThe origins of poetry are clearly rooted in obscurity, in secretiveness, in incantation, in spells that must at once invoke and protect, tell the secret and keep it.\n\n– Mary Ruefle\n\nWords have a love for each other, a desire that culminates in poetry.\n\n– Mary Ruefle\n\nLove that friend, that person, that thing, whatever you like, you’ll be on the right path to knowing more thoroughly, afterwards; that’s what I say to myself. But you must love with a high, serious intimate sympathy, with a will, with intelligence, and you must always seek to know more thoroughly, better, and more.\n\n– Vincent Van Gogh, in a\n\nletter to his brother\n\nI am convinced that the first lyric poem was written at night, and that the moon was witness to the event and that the event was witness to the moon. For me, the moon has always been the very embodiment of lyric poetry.\n\n– Mary Ruefle\n\nThere is a world which poets cannot seem to enter. It is the world everybody else lives in. And the only thing poets seem to have in common is their yearning to enter this world.\n\n– Mary Ruefle\n\nBe gentle with yourself. This is a long and difficult journey. Your goals should be reasonable so as not to create frustration and disappointments. Be willing to crawl before you walk. Perfect each skill as you move along on the journey, and forgive yourself when you stumble, or even slide backward. Setbacks are temporary and meant to be instructive. Let yourself slide backward, observe what has occurred, get back on your feet, and move forward. Sliding backward is part of the pattern of growth. Just don’t slide backward and stay there. Don’t ever give up. Progress is made of perseverance. Never lose hope.”\n\n– Swami Rama\n\nTo succeed in this task of shaping the future, the will of the more comprehensive self must be functioning. The individual will can function in this capacity only through an acknowledged union with the deeper structure of reality. Even beyond union with the human community must be union with the Earth, with the universe itself in the full wonder of its being. Only the Earth can adequately will the Earth. If we will the future effectively it will be because the guidance and the powers of the Earth have been communicated to us.\n\n– Thomas Berry\n\nI hope to have gathered\n\nTo repay your kindness\n\nThe willow leaves\n\nScattered in the garden.\n\n– Matsuo Bashō\n\nThe books or the music in which we thought the beauty was located will betray us if we trust to them; it was not in them, it only came through them, and what came through them was longing. These things– the beauty, the memory of our own past– are good images of what we really desire; but if they are mistaken for the thing itself, they turn into dumb idols, breaking the hearts of their worshippers. For they are not the thing itself; they are only the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited.\n\nDo you think I am trying to weave a spell? Perhaps I am; but remember your fairy tales. Spells are used for breaking enchantments as well as for inducing them. And you and I have need of the strongest spell that can be found to wake us from the evil enchantment of worldliness which has laid upon us for nearly a hundred years.\n\n– C.S. Lewis, The Weight of Glory\n\nMake your ego porous. Will is of little importance, complaining is nothing, fame is nothing. Openness, patience, receptivity, solitude is everything.\n\n– Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nUtopia\n\nby Wislawa Szymborska\n\nIsland where all becomes clear.\n\nSolid ground beneath your feet.\n\nThe only roads are those that offer access.\n\nBushes bend beneath the weight of proofs.\n\nThe Tree of Valid Supposition grows here\n\nwith branches disentangled since time immermorial.\n\nThe Tree of Understanding, dazzling straight and simple.\n\nsprouts by the spring called Now I Get It.\n\nThe thicker the woods, the vaster the vista:\n\nthe Valley of Obviously.\n\nIf any doubts arise, the wind dispels them instantly."
