He belonged to Chishti–Nizami Sufi order. He was born and died at Chachran and was buried at Mithankot.\n\nHe mastered Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Saraiki, Punjabi, Sindhi, and Braj Bhasha, and also wrote poems in Saraiki, Punjabi, Urdu, Sindhi, Persian, and Braj Bhasha.\n\nHis most significant works include:\n\nDeewan-e-Farid (poem in Saraiki, 1882; in Punjabi, 1883 ; in Urdu, 1884)\n\nManaqabe Mehboobia (prose, in Persian)\n\nThe 20th century saw development of an entire branch of literary studies into the life and work of Khwaja Ghulam Farid, named faridiyat. Today, many religious and educational institutions in Pakistan and India are named after him (e.g., Government Khawaja Farid College in Rahimyar Khan, Pakistan) as are streets and town quarters. A Khwaja Ghulam Farid Award is awarded by the Government of Pakistan in literature, its recipients including Ismail Ahmedani, Noshi Gilani and others.[citation needed] In 2001, on Khwaja Ghulam Farid's birth centenary, Pakistan Post issued a memorial stamp."
