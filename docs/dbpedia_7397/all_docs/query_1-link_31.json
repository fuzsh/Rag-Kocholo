The variety of agricultural products such as wheat, barley,oily seeds, rice, ucalyptus, medical herbs; the existence of many palm and citrus farms; having mountains suitable for raising olives and Sugar Cane of this fertile plain. The abundance of water supplies, rivers, and dams, also has an influence on the fishery industries, which are prevalent in the area.\n\nClimate\n\nThe province of Khuzestan can be divided in, two regions plains with hot, dry, and mountainous regions mild and semi- warm.\n\nThe plain regions include south and west of province with hot and humid climate.\n\nHistory\n\nKhuzestan is the most ancient Iranian province and is often referred to as the \"birthplace of the nation,\" since this is where the Persians one of the branches of Aryan tribes first settled, assimilating the native Elamite population , and thus laying the foundation for the future dynastic empires of Achaemenid, Parthia, and Sassanid. The pre-Islamic Partho-Sassanid Inscriptions gives the name of the province as Khuzestan. Khuzestan is also, where the medical college and the town of Jundi Shapour located.\n\nFrench archeologists such as Jaquses De Morgan date the civilization here as far back as 8000 BC when excavating areas such as Tal-i Ali-Kosh. The first large scale empire based here was that of the powerful fourth millennium BC Elamites.\n\nArcheological ruins verify the entire province of Khuzestan to be home to the Elamite civilization, a non-Semitic, and non-Indo-European-speaking kingdom, and \"the earliest civilization of Persia\".\n\nIn fact, in the words of Elton L. Daniel, the Elamites were \"the founders of the first Iranian empire in the geographic sense.\" Hence the central geopolitical significance of Khuzestan, the seat of Iran's first empire.\n\nThe provincial capital, Ahwaz is the anagram of \"Avaz\" and \"Avaja\" which appear in Darius the Great' epigraph. This word appears in Naqsh-e Rostam inscription as \"Khaja\" or \"Khooja\".\n\n.\n\nAs the Seljuk dynasty weakened, Mehrdad l the Parthian (171-137 BC), gained ascendency over the region. During the Sassanid dynasty, this area thrived tremendously and flourished.\n\nThe Arab invasion thus brought Khuzestan under occupation of the Arabs of the Umayyad and Abbasid Khaliphates, until Ya'qub bin Laith as-Saffar, from southeastern Iran, raised the flag of independence once more, and ultimately regained control over Khuzestan, among other parts of Iran. Khuzestan From that point on, Iranian rullers would continue to rule the region in succession as an important part of Iran.\n\nDuring the Qajar era, Ahwaz flourished again with new buildings and industries.\n\nBeing on the border with Iraq, Khuzestan suffered the heaviest damage of all Iranian provinces during the Invasion of Iraq (1980-1988).What used to be Iran's largest refinery at Abadan destroyed, never to fully recover. Many of the famous nakhlestans (palm groves) annihilated, cities were destroyed, historical sites were demolished, and nearly half the province were distroyed by Saddam's invading army. This created a mass exodus into other provinces that did not have the logistical capability of taking in such a large number of refugees.\n\nHowever, by 1982, Iranian forces managed to push Saddam's forces back into Iraq. The battle of \"the Liberation of Khorram shahr\" (one of Khuzestan's largest cities and the most important Iranian port prior to the war) was a turning point in the war, and is officially celebrated everyyear in Iran.Today Ahwaz is a modern community nestled among the palm groves lining the Karoon River As a focal point of Iran’s oil industry and town is one the country’s economic capitals.\n\nIran National Heritage Organization lists 140 sites of historical and cultural significance in Khuzestan.\n\nUNESCO has designated an area in the province, called Arjan (known as Dasht e Arjan) as a biosphere reserve.\n\nHistorical Attractions:\n\nThe remaining of ruind ancient city of Sassani loor ( beginning of Islamic era ), remaing of the ruined city of Aelami Zafran Dasht, Domes of Amir Yousef, Baba Lang, Imam Reza Daymi Donabdar in Andimeshk.

As a result, the merchant and middle-classes comprise a significant percentage of the population.\n\nClimate\n\nGilan has a humid temperate climate with plenty of annual rainfall. The Alborz range provides further diversity to the land in addition to the Caspian coasts.\n\nLarge parts of the province are mountainous, green and forested. The coastal plain along the Caspian Sea is similar to that of Mazandaran.\n\nHistory\n\nRasht first mentioned in historical documents in 682 CE, but it is certainly older than this.\n\nThe first recorded encounter between Gilak and Deylamite warlords and invading Arabs armies was in the battle of Jalula in 647 AD. Arabs never managed to conquer Gilan. Gilaks and Deylamites successfully repulsed any Arab attempt to occupy their land. Gilan Province has seen theTurkish invasions of 10th and 11th centuries, Mongols invaders that plundered the city in 13th century and Armies of Russians and British.\n\nGilan was a major producer of silk beginning in 15th century. As a result, it was one of the wealthiest provinces in Iran. Silk trade, though not the production, and the single most important source of trade revenue for the as early as 16th century and until mid\n\nIn mid 19th century, a widespread fatal epidemic in silk worms paralized Gilan's economy, causing widespread economic distress. Gilan's budding industrialists and merchants were increasingly dissatisfied with the weak and ineffective rule of Qajars. Reoreintation of Gilan's agriculture and industry from silk to production of rice and introduction of tea plantations where a partial answer to decline of silk in the province.\n\nQajars established a central government in late 18th century, and lost a series of wars to Russia 1804-1813 and 1826-28), resulting in enormous gain of influence by the Russian empire in the Caspian Sea region and Gilanian’s cities of Rasht and Anzali occupied by the Russian forces. Anzali served as the main trading port between Iran and Europe.\n\nGilanis had played an important role in the Constitutional Revolution of Iran. Sepahdar Tonekaboni (Rashti) was a prominent figure in the early years of the revolution and was instrumental in defeating Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar. In later years (late 1910s), many Gilakis gathered under the leadership of Mirza Kouchak Khan Jangali.\n\nMirza Kochak Kahn became the most prominent revolutionary leader in northern Iran at this period. His movement, known as the Jangalis (Foresters Movement), had sent an armed brigade toTehran, which helped depose the Qajar ruler Mohammad AliShah. However, the revolution did not progress the way the constitutionalists had strived for, and Iran came to face much internal unrest and foreign intervention, particularly from the British, and Russian Empires. Gilan's contribution to the movement of Mirza Kouchak Khan Jangali known as the (Constitutionalist movement of Gilan), is glorified in Iranian history and effectively secured Gilan and Mazandaran against foreign invasions.\n\nTourism, People and Food\n\nThe province has an annual average of 8 million tourists, mostly domestic.
