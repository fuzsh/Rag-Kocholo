She has successfully published five collections of poetry. Her poetry collection published in Pakistan Includes:\n\nMohabatain Jab Sumar Kurna (When you count affections, 1993)\n\nUdas Honay Kay Din Naheen (These are not the days of sadeness, 1997)\n\nPehla Lafz Mohabat Likha (The first word of love, 2003)\n\nSelected poems like Ay Meeray Shareek-E-Risal-E-Jaan, Hum Tera Intezaar Kurtey Rahey (O my beloved, I kept waiting for you, 2008).\n\nIn 2008 her poems were read in U.K after translation at Poetry Translation Centre’s World Poets Tour.

Her mother Mrs. Sarwer Gillani was a professor of literature, Urdu and Persian languages. She is a member of younger generation of female poets. Her experience of living in US shows a notable impact on her significant number of poems. Living through Diaspora has increased the complexity of her poems and reinforced her sense of female identity and introduced a new revolution against restraint creative writers in Pakistani society. These ideas became the base of her poems like\n\nThis prisoner breathes\n\nTo catch butterflies…\n\nThe breeze rewrites\n\nCan someone bring me my entire being\n\nI say nothing anywhere\n\nThe flower is torn at the heart\n\nNoshi Gillani is most renowned Urdu poetess of eighties and eager with great creative dynamism. Her publications earn virtue of popularity because readers like her mushaira and nazams."
