Shridhar Swami wrote it on the banks of theriver BrahmaKamandalu in Baramati in the vicinity of the KashiVishveshwartemple. It literally means \"The Nectar of Shiva'sPlay\". In 1935,this book was one of the Hindu Scriptures that wasdesecrated bysome 1000 Dalit youths from the \"Untouchable YouthLeague\" at theSukene village in Niphad taluka of the Nasikdistrict. It has 14chapters (adhyaya) and 2453 couplets (ovis inMarathi). Mostly, itis based on BrahmottarKhanda from the SkandaPurana but some partsof it are from Linga Purana and Shiva Purana.It also has a 15thchapter but many are of the opinion that thiswas added later andnot composed by Shridhar Swami. The 11thchapter (adhyay) is called'Rudra Adhyay' and is considered themost important as per ShridharSwami. In the beginning of thechapter it talks about the importanceof wearing Rudraksha and howthey should be worn.

LifeThemain source of information on Mir's life is hisautobiographyZikr-e-Mir, which covers the period from his childhoodto thebeginning of his sojourn in Lucknow.[1] However, it is saidtoconceal more than it reveals,[2] with material that is undatedorpresented in no chronological sequence. Therefore, many ofthe'true details' of Mir's life remain a matter of speculation.Mirwas born in Agra, India (then called Akbarabad and ruled bytheMughals) in August or February 1723. His grandfather migratedfromHejaz to Hyderabad State, then to Akbarabad. His philosophy oflifewas formed primarily by his father, a religious man with alargefollowing, whose emphasis on the importance of love and thevalueof compassion remained with Mir throughout his life and imbuedhispoetry. Mir's father died while the poet was in his teens. HeleftAgra for Delhi a few years after his father's death, to finishhiseducation and also to find patrons who offered himfinancialsupport (Mir's many patrons and his relationship with themhavebeen described by his translator C. M. Naim).[3] Somescholarsconsider two of Mir's masnavis (long narrative poems rhymedincouplets), Mu'amlat-e-ishq (The Stages of Love) and Khwab okhyal-eMir (\"Mir's Vision\"), written in the first person, asinspired byMir's own early love affairs,[4] but it is by no meansclear howautobiographical these accounts of a poet's passionatelove affairand descent into madness are. Especially, as Frances W.Pritchettpoints out, the austere portrait of Mir from thesemasnavis must bejuxtaposed against the picture drawn by AndalibShadani, whoseinquiry suggests a very different poet, given tounabashederoticism in his verse.[5] Mir lived much of his life inMughalDelhi. Kuchha Chelan, in Old Delhi was his address at thattime.However, after Ahmad Shah Abdali's sack of Delhi each yearstarting1748, he eventually moved to the court of Asaf-ud-DaulahinLucknow, at the king's invitation.
