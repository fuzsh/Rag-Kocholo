        "text": "Do not go gentle into that good night,\n\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\n\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\n\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\n\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\n\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\n\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\n\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\n\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\n\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,\n\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\n\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\n\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nRage, rage against the dying of the light. -Dylan Thomas üíê\n\nEvery morning when I wake,\n\nDear Lord, a little prayer I make,\n\nO please do keep Thy lovely eye\n\nOn all poor creatures born to die\n\nAnd every evening at sun-down\n\nI ask a blessing on the town,\n\nFor whether we last the night or no\n\nI‚Äôm sure is always touch-and-go.\n\nWe are not wholly bad or good\n\nWho live our lives under Milk Wood,\n\nAnd Thou, I know, wilt be the first\n\nTo see our best side, not our worst.\n\nO let us see another day!\n\nBless us all this night, I pray,\n\nAnd to the sun we all will bow\n\nAnd say, good-bye ‚Äì but just for now!\n\n-Dylan Thomas üíê\n\nLike most of Charles Bukowski‚Äôs other works, Bluebird is a straightforward, hard-hitting, and rather gut-tugging poem. A literary punch to the gut. A hyper-dose of reality, so to speak. In this poem, Bukowski speaks of a bluebird in his heart. A bluebird that he repeatedly smashes down to hide away from prying eyes. He is too tough for the bluebird, he pours whiskey on it, smokes it down with cigarettes, so none of the whores, the bartenders, and especially none of his readers can see it. As a writer who makes his living by selling pain sealed under a hard casing of machismo, there is little room for vulnerability, let alone, a kindle of happiness. ( KRISTEL MARIE PUJANES).........[[ No copyright intended to music except voclas]]\n\nNo smoke without you, my fire.\n\nAfter you left,\n\nyour cigarette glowed on in my ashtray\n\nand sent up a long thread of such quiet grey\n\nI smiled to wonder who would believe its signal\n\nof so much love. One cigarette\n\nin the non-smoker's tray.\n\nAs the last spire\n\ntrembles up, a sudden draught\n\nblows it winding into my face.\n\nIs it smell, is it taste?\n\nYou are here again, and I am drunk on your tobacco lips.\n\nOut with the light.\n\nLet the smoke lie back in the dark.\n\nTill I hear the very ash\n\nsigh down among the flowers of brass\n\nI'll breathe, and long past midnight, your last kiss.\n\nEdwin Morgan\n\nAbout the poem: ‚ÄòNo Leaders Please' is a poem by Charles Bukowski, it's from one of his books, 'The Pleasures of the Damned'. This poem is a reminder to remain a free spirit and never letting anyone else decide who you are.\n\nThe tags that people provide you don't define you and that your independence is yours and yours alone. Although the poem doesn't mention leaders, the title does, and the content suggests a rejection of leadership.\n\nAbout the author:\n\nCharles Bukowski, (Henry Charles Bukowski, Jr.) was born August 16, 1920, Andernach, Germany and was brought to United States by his father at the age of two. He grew in America. He is known as a prolific underground writer who used his poetry and prose to depict the vices of urban society and highlight the typicality of America. Bukowski relied on experience, emotion, and imagination in his work, using direct language and violent and sexual imagery which is evident in his poems. He died March 9, 1994 in San Pedro, California, U.S.\n\nAgha Shahid Ali, an Indian-American Kashmiri poet, was born on 4 February 1949, New Delhi, India.

Agha was known for his unique blend of multiple ethnic influences and ideas in his work. His Hindu, Muslim and Western heritage are reflected in his works.\n\nAgha started publishing his work in the early 1970s but his collection \"A walk through the Yellow Pages\" was the reason he gained widespread recognition. His famous work include: \"A walk though the Yellow Pages\"(1987), \"The Half-inch Himalayas\"(1987), \"A Nostalgist's Map of America\"(1991), \"The Country Without a Post Office\"(1997), and \"Rooms are never Finished\"(2001), the later a finalist for the National Book Award.\n\nAgha Shahid Ali was later diagnosed with brain cancer and died of it on December 8 2001 in Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\n] \"On the Necessity of Sadness\" - üíêMikael de Lara Co\n\nüíê\n\nLet me tell you about longing.\n\nLet me presume that I have something\n\nnew to say about it, that this room,\n\nnaked, its walls pining for clocks,\n\nhas something new to say\n\nabout absence. Somewhere\n\nthe crunch of an apple, fading\n\nsunflowers on a quilt, a window\n\nlooking out to a landscape\n\nwith a single tree. And you\n\nsitting under it. Let go,\n\nsaid you to me in a dream,\n\nbut by the time the wind\n\ncarried your voice to me,\n\nI was already walking through\n\nthe yawning door, towards\n\nthe small, necessary sadnesses\n\nof waking. I wish\n\nI could hold you now,\n\nbut that is a line that has\n\nno place in a poem, like the swollen\n\nsheen of the moon tonight,\n\nor the word absence, or you,\n\nor longing. Let me tell you about\n\nlonging. In a distant country\n\ntwo lovers are on a bench, and pigeons,\n\nunafraid, are perching beside them.\n\nShe places a hand on his knee\n\nand says, say to me\n\nthe truest thing you can.\n\nI am closing my eyes now.\n\nYou are far away.\n\nTonight I Can Write (The Saddest Lines)\n\nTonight I can write the saddest lines.\n\nWrite, for example, 'The night is starry and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance.'\n\nThe night wind revolves in the sky and sings.\n\nTonight I can write the saddest lines.\n\nI loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.\n\nThrough nights like this one I held her in my arms.\n\nI kissed her again and again under the endless sky.\n\nShe loved me, sometimes I loved her too.\n\nHow could one not have loved her great still eyes.\n\nTonight I can write the saddest lines.\n\nTo think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.\n\nTo hear the immense night, still more immense without her.\n\nAnd the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.\n\nWhat does it matter that my love could not keep her.\n\nThe night is starry and she is not with me.\n\nThis is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.\n\nMy soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.\n\nMy sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer.\n\nMy heart looks for her, and she is not with me.\n\nThe same night whitening the same trees.\n\nWe, of that time, are no longer the same.\n\nI no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.\n\nMy voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.\n\nAnother's. She will be another's. As she was before my kisses.\n\nHer voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes.\n\nI no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.\n\nLove is so short, forgetting is so long.\n\nBecause through nights like this one I held her in my arms\n\nmy soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.\n\nThough this be the last pain that she makes me suffer\n\nand these the last verses that I write for her.\n\nTranslation by W. S. Merwin\n\nAlone is a poem that offers the reader a glimpse into the mind of Edgar Allan Poe. He was often seen as being different, and his writing, in many cases, was so dark that it alienated him. In this poem, he acknowledges that from a very young age he knew that he was different. He goes on to say that he never enjoyed the things that others did and he never found sorrow in that which others did. Poe describes many things in which almost everyone would gaze at in awe and wonder - like lightning, mountains, and other natural wonders - but he did not. These symbols also serve to give the reader a sense that time is passing by. Poe was drawn away from the natural beauty of these things by the \"demon\" in his view. This demon could be interpreted in many ways, but most likely represents death and his deep loneliness. In general, the title represents how Poe has always been alone and isolated in the way he perceived himself and all around him."
