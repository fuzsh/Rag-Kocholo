PESHAWAR:

A poetry and musical night organised on Wednesday by the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Directorate of Culture showed how many poets and writers have incorporated their visions for peace into their writing.

The session held in Nishtar Hall was dedicated to Saeed Khan, an Urdu poet from Hazara and his wife Noshi Gilani.

In the event that lasted till midnight, participants shared ideas and thoughts about how Khan’s poetry was not only confined to romantic literature but also reflected his views and analysis about society. Khan was described as a ‘young poet, introduced by the legendary poet Ahmad Faraz’.

His poetry was compared to Faraz’s and similarities were acknowledged in the progressive nature of their work and how its simplicity was able to appeal to younger generations.

Besides Khan, a number of poets including Hassan Abbas Raza, Zia Turk, Aziz Ejaz and Sajjad Babar also recited patriotic poetry, yearning for the restoration of peace in their troubled country.

Younger people were also present in the hall, despite many poets fearing that they do not fully appreciate this type of literature. Hindko poet Nasir Ali Saeed said that poetry needed to be ‘sugar-coated’ in order for it to appeal to youth. “Besides that, there are general worries that Urdu poetry is gradually losing its appeal,” he said.

Addressing the gathering, Minister for Culture and Information Mian Iftikhar Hussain said writers played a crucial role in bringing peace and stability in the country.
