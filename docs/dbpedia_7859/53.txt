Historical Significance

Founded in the 7th century BC, Samarkand has a history that is as ancient as it is rich. It became particularly prominent under the rule of Alexander the Great and later as the capital of the Timurid Empire under the reign of Timur (Tamerlane) in the 14th century. Timur sought to make Samarkand the center of his empire, bringing artisans from across the conquered lands to rebuild the city in unrivaled splendor.

Gur-e-Amir Mausoleum: The final resting place of Timur, this mausoleum is known for its stunning Persian dome and intricate interior decorations.

Shah-i-Zinda: A necropolis that includes mausoleums and other ritual buildings of 9-14th and 19th centuries. It is one of the most moving religious sites, with a long and beautifully tiled avenue of mausoleums.
