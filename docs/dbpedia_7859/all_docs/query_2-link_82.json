        "text": "In my last post, I explored an ancient Timurid Quran in terms of its artistic influences. It tempted me to dive further into the apparently unlikely friendship between an Imperial Chinese Dynasty, and a Muslim Persian Empire.\n\nThe Timurid Empire\n\nThe Timurid dynasty was the last nomadic empire before modernization to set foot in Inner Asia. It emerged in the second half of the fourteenth century and lasted for over a hundred years. It was born on the ruins of the former Chingissid Empire. Much of Chingissid history gets interwoven with that of the Mongols, one of the four ‘ulus’ that were split up among Chinggis Khan’s sons after his death. The Chaghatai ulus is where the Timurid dynasty came into existence is the territory of the Chagatai Ulus.\n\nHere comes the question: how did the new dynasty emerge? The Chaghatai dynasty, which had ruled for a hundred years or so, lost its political power by the middle of the fourteenth century, pulling the Chaghatai Ulus into disintegration. This was further triggered by Tarmashirin, a Chaghatai ruler, converting to Islam, against whom tribal chieftains rebelled, wanting to keep Chinggisid traditions pure of Islamic influences. This led to a rebellion against Tarmashirin, and he was deposed in 1334.\n\nAfter his deposition, the ‘ulus’ sank into a thirty-year-long anarchy, where East and West of the Ulus became Moghulistan and Transxonia. This was followed by Timur’s rise to power and the establishment of the Timurid dynasty. Timur’s rise to power is indeed an incredible story, and establishing an empire from tribal fiefdoms is certainly no easy task.\n\nThe Ming China\n\nThe Mongol Yuan dynasty was to be overthrown eventually, by Chinese nationals, but it was not that obvious in the fourteenth century. The dynasty was largely running things the same way Kublai Khan had. After managing to occupy China during the 1270s, but not having enough men to cover the country, the armies were usually stationed near the capital, with Mongol or Central Asian commanders.\n\nHowever, the once victorious Mongol army was not able to maintain its military power on a high level. It started to decline gradually from the end of the thirteenth century. By the 1340s, it no longer held the power to crush rebelion. Mismanagement and the lack of law and order led the Yuan Chinese society became less and less safe. As a result, semi-military forces were being formed in local governments, and bandits became stronger. As a result, the weapon-culture spread throughout the countryside. The relatively peaceful society was now heavily militarised, when Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu emperor)17, the first Ming emperor finally managed to complete the reunification of the country under a pure Chinese sovereignty.\n\nHowever, just like in the case of Timur, the way to reunite China under his own leadership took a very long time for Zhu Yuanzhang. While he was fighting the Mongols, he also needed to compete with rival rebel fellows.\n\nDrawing parallels\n\nTo begin with, both empires were born on the moribund ruins of the former Chingissid Empire during the second half of the fourteenth century. To say “ruins” in the case of the Mongol Yuan dynasty may sound exaggerated, for it was very much alive when Zhu Yuanzhang and other rebels were fighting the Mongols, but the Yuans were nowhere near as powerful as they were at the time of establishment.\n\nUnlike Zhu Yuanzhang, Timur did not need to fight a united army, since he was born two years after the collapse of the united Chaghatai ‘ulus’ in 1334.\n\nTimur and Zhu Yuanzhang were men of the very same age, and charisma, cashing on opportunities and combining them with their extraordinary skills to establish themselves. Interestingly, both of them reached the significant moments of rising to power at almost the same time. It is almost like, it was a stage in the lifecycle of the Chingissid Empire, which manifested in two different places, through two different leaders, but followed a similar path.\n\nAfter that though, the careers of the two dynasty founders became different, since Timur went to war to conquer more lands, while Hongwu (Zhu Yuanzhang) focused on consolidating his new-founded dynasty.\n\nApart from their heritage, and strong militaries, another very startling fact is that the Hongwu emperor and Timur died within a few years of each other, at around the age of seventy, to be succeeded by their grandsons, neither of whom survived over two or three years after rising to the throne.\n\nBoth grandsons were replaced by their uncles, sons of the founders, and both of them proved to be rather stable rulers. The first half of the fifteenth century was hallmarked by Shah Rukh in the Timurid Empire, and by the Yongle emperor in Ming China.\n\nWhat is more that both empires turned away from the early militaristic features during Shah Rukh’s and Yongle’s time. The former, leaned towards making the empire a Sultanate, focusing more on Islam, and making it a cultural center. Yongle too believed in the might of scholars, rather than the military, and in expanding China’s cultural boundaries.\n\nThe Timurid-Ming relationship\n\nYuan China encouraged free trade, but Ming China returned to the old Confucian school of thought: China at the center, and other states just vassals around it. Because of this, the dynasty established both, a monopoly over trade, travel, and foreign relations, as well as ties with the newly established Timurid Empire.\n\nAlthough it is entirely possible that the relationship between the Timurids and the Ming China might have been stronger than what we can assume from sources which survived, and we don’t have proof to say for certain, but it is entirely plausible that Ming China saw the newly emerged Turco-Mongol dynasty as a potential enemy, thus wanted to establish strong ties. Central Asia, foreign but related to both empires, was also a point of possible contention, as well as similarity. In the first two decades or so, the ties between the two kingdoms were next to none.\n\nWhilst embassy ties broke between Timur and his counterpart, when it was Shah Rukh’s time, things changed. Chen Cheng and Naqqash are the two ultimate authorities on the time, speaking of embassies, trade, and the likes.\n\nIn between this trade, an immense amount of art flourished, perhaps we may dive into it some day. For now, I shall sign off :’))"
