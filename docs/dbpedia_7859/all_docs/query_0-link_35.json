The square is dominated Ulugbke Madrasah a religious education mosque. In Uzbekistan this is one of the monumental buildings in the country. Standing there in the square, I can still imagine how busy and prosperous it was thousands years ago. The mosaic are so beautiful that we couldnâ€™t leave this place despite of the 40 degree celcius hot weather. #centralasia #uzbekistan #registansquare #buildings"
