Les tontons flingueurs by Georges Lautner (105′)

Homicides provide the punch lines in this classic gangster comedy. The trouble starts when dying mob boss “The Mexican” (Jacques Dumesnil) summons ex-gangster Fernand (Lino Ventura) to take care of some of his business, and as can only be expected, Fernand finds himself overwhelmed as the death count gets higher and higher. Adapted from the novel Grisby or Not Grisby by writer Albert Simoni, this film’s reputation has grown since its mediocre reception in the ‘60s and is now a staple of French television.
