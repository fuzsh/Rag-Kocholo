Rhodes ReFocus is a series of contemporary methodological and theoretical approaches to the interdisciplinary analyses and interpretations of international film directors, from the celebrated to the ignored, in direct relationship to their respective culture—its myths, values, and historical precepts—and the broader parameters of international film history and theory. The series provides a forum for introducing a broad spectrum of directors, working in and establishing movements, trends, cycles, and genres including those historical, currently popular, or emergent, and in need of critical assessment or reassessment. It ignores no director who created a historical space—either in or outside of the studio system—beginning with the origins of cinema and up to the present. ReFocus brings these film directors to a new audience of scholars and general readers of Film Studies. Titles in the series include: ReFocus: The Films of Corneliu Porumboiu Monica Filimon ReFocus: The Films of Francis Veber Keith Corson ReFocus: The Films of Andrei Tarkovsky Sergei Toymentsev ReFocus: The Films of Jia Zhangke Maureen Turim and Ying Xiao edinburghuniversitypress.com/series/refocint\n\nReFocus: The Films of Francis Veber Keith Corson\n\nEdinburgh University Press is one of the leading university presses in the UK.

The very existence of the ReFocus series is a much-needed addition to the field of film studies and I feel lucky to be a part of the broader project that they have created. Many thanks to Richard Strachan, Gillian Leslie, and everyone at Edinburgh University Press for being so helpful and patient throughout the entire process. I am grateful to Rhodes College for providing the travel funding that allowed me to attend a conference in Paris, leading to key conversations that helped me conceptualize this project. Also at Rhodes, a big thank you to Laura Loth for giving me the opportunity to talk through this material with an audience for my first public lecture about Veber. Many thanks to all of my students over the past few years at Rhodes, Memphis College of Art, and the University of Memphis for serving as a sounding board for many of the ideas that appear in the following pages. Much of this project was made possible by the help I received working on my French, which started from scratch shortly before taking on this project and ramped up quickly once my research started in earnest. Alors, merci pour tout, Émilie. And of course, Mina deserves a special thank you for keeping me happy and healthy throughout the entire process.\n\nC h apter 1\n\nFrancis Veber and the Canon\n\nT\n\nhe career of Francis Veber presents a paradox for auteurist film studies. A “Veber film” is as identifiable and idiosyncratic as those of any other French auteur, yet he is rarely invoked in discussions of post-nouvelle vague cinema. He is a filmmaker who has achieved success at home and outside of his native France, yet he is often omitted from histories of French cinema, particularly those written in English. Part of this has to do with Veber’s chosen mode of address, which is popular comedy. Clearly, the critical film canon is resistant to genre practices, placing value in both the self-consciously serious and non-commercial (or, at least, a less blatant commercialism than popular genre films). Veber is also a problematic figure due to his relationship with Hollywood. Veber has writing credits on eleven Hollywood films, with his screenplays being the most prominent recipient of the French-to-American adaptation treatment in the 1980s and 1990s; a phenomenon that would be coined “le remake.” Yet, other respected international auteurs have seen their films bowdlerized by Hollywood without it impacting their personal reputations as filmmakers, including François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard.1 Perhaps the biggest impediment to Veber receiving the auteur treatment is that he is primarily seen as a writer, not a director. Although he has directed twelve features, his unobtrusive, almost invisible visual style suggests a writer who stepped behind the camera simply to assure that his screenplays would not be reinterpreted or altered by someone else. Veber’s comments in various interviews put forth a seeming indifference toward the act of filmmaking, lacking the passion for technical details and mise en scène that are often associated with the director as auteur. But it is because of the ways that Veber fails to fit into traditional definitions of the auteur, not despite them, that he is such a compelling figure for analysis.\n\n2 t he fi l m s o f f rancis ve be r The ReFocus series offers the perfect venue for an exploration of Veber in that it utilizes the authorial subject while challenging the limitations of the canon, expanding parameters to welcome new directors into the broader conversation of film scholarship. Veber’s career intersects with central issues surrounding film authorship, commercial and industrial practices, and national cinema, generating questions that are increasingly pressing in a globalized and fractured cinematic landscape. Veber’s films look to the past, stylistically indebted to classic screen comedies and theatre. They are also incredibly prescient, as his remarkable run of box office hits in France were made within an unstable national film industry and, in turn, helped studios like Gaumont fully understand the continued need to produce films made explicitly for a French audience as opposed to, or at least in addition to, international co-productions made for a global audience. Spanning from his directorial debut Le jouet in 1976 to his final outing behind the camera with L’emmerdeur in 2008, this book will primarily cover the twelve films that Veber directed during his career while also addressing his work as a playwright and screenwriter, and the sizable body of American remakes of his projects. Veber’s relationship with Hollywood has not been completely passive. The most glaring example is Veber directing the remake of his own French film Les fugitifs (1986) as Three Fugitives (1989) for Disney’s Touchstone Pictures. This transnational adaptation—which in this particular case may be more accurately labeled a transnational repetition—is just one of the many Hollywood utterances of his career that will be explored in the coming chapters. The work he has produced reinforces common American perceptions about France’s poor taste in comedy while also falling victim to romanticized notions of working outside of the dominant film industry. Hollywood’s tendency to Americanize his films—a practice that Veber has been alternately victimized by from a distance, and guilty of as a participant—has hurt his artistic reputation, but comparative analysis of his French originals and their English-language remakes helps to unpack intent, reception, and subtext. In order to dedicate a single volume to Veber’s career, however, there must be more at play than a need to challenge the limitations of the canon or to use him as a symbol of Hollywood adaptation of foreign films. The primary impetus of this book ultimately rests in the value of Veber’s films, both in the quality of his writing and the underappreciated level of his directorial craft. It is true that Veber considers himself a writer first and foremost, but his work as a director makes a far more compelling case for an auteurist reading than his numerous outings as a screenwriter for other directors. His writing and directing function in unison, even if his approach to writing deviates from the ways in which other writer-directors think in images and camera movements when committing words to the page. Perhaps the best corollary to Veber is Billy Wilder, one of his cinematic inspirations. Considering a good script as the\n\nf rancis ve ber an d th e can on 3 foundational element of any successful film, Wilder also uses an unobtrusive visual style as a director to help emphasize the screenplay. Just as a musician plays their instrument in service of the song as opposed to an outward display of their virtuosity, Wilder and Veber direct in service of their writing. Like Wilder, Veber began as a journalist and eventually found comedy as his preferred medium for making broader social commentaries. Not coincidentally, the final film of Wilder’s career would be Buddy Buddy (1981), a remake of Veber’s L’emmerdeur (originally a stage play, it was also made into a film in France by Édouard Molinaro in 1973). Clearly there was a mutual respect between the writers, but the conflicts and failures of Buddy Buddy (which will be explored in Chapter 13) speak to the importance of the independent authorship that Veber sought to create for himself as a director.\n\nco m e d y , nat i o n a l c i n e ma , a n d ca n on Considering the quality and artistry of Billy Wilder’s directorial œuvre from the vantage point of the late 1960s, Andrew Sarris chose to keep the director out of the “Pantheon” in his book The American Cinema.2 Instead, relegating Wilder to the “Less Than Meets the Eye” category, Sarris takes umbrage with Wilder’s “penchant for gross caricature” and “visual and structural deficiencies.”3 Both of these criticisms have also been leveled against Veber. Although Sarris would soften his criticism of Wilder in subsequent years, the writer-director remains a figure often left out of discussions of cinema’s premier auteurs despite the fact that his films and career have generated a sizable body of scholarship and critical discourse.4 Of the fourteen directors in Sarris’s pantheon, only three (Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Ernst Lubitsch) are primarily associated with making comedies. Howard Hawks, another pantheon director in Sarris’s eyes, certainly made his fair share of iconic comedies—Twentieth Century (1934), Bringing Up Baby (1938), and His Girl Friday (1940) among them—but he has largely been championed for his ability to move between genres as disparate as Westerns, musicals, gangster films, and science fiction rather than through an isolated or even primary consideration of his comedies. Whether or not Billy Wilder deserves to be mentioned alongside the likes of Hawks, Chaplin, and Lubitsch is a question for another scholar on another day, but the fact remains that comedy and the filmmakers associated with the genre remain marginalized in the realm of film scholarship. Arguably, Sarris’s pantheon is unusually inclusive of comedy directors when compared to the broader scope of auteurist studies. The exclusion of comedy has been particularly pronounced in the scholarly consideration of French cinema. Film students in English-speaking countries could be forgiven for assuming that French cinema is dominated by\n\n4 t he fi l m s o f f rancis ve be r auteurist art cinema, as textbooks, monographs, art house releases, film festival selections, and home video distribution largely eschew genre filmmaking and popular cinematic entertainment made for a domestic French audience. While the work of Jacques Tati is an exception of French comedy deemed worthy of inclusion in most historical surveys, a film like La grande vadrouille (1966, Gérard Oury) is not routinely mentioned by English-language scholarship of French cinema. The most popular film in the history of the French box office before it was unseated three decades later by Titanic (1997, James Cameron), La grande vadrouille is rarely analyzed with much rigor and remains largely unavailable on DVD in North America. This speaks to one of the biggest problems in writing about a national cinema from an outsider’s perspective, as access often supersedes language as the primary obstacle to creating a complete portrait. Subtitles may not be the most elegant or complete way to engage with a film, but there is a level of understanding that can be gained regardless of the viewer’s level of familiarity with the spoken language on the audio track. While a large percentage of French films are available with English subtitles when released on DVD, only a small percentage of them are ever distributed outside of France. As Alan Williams points out in his introduction to Republic of Images: A History of French Filmmaking (1992), decisions regarding the films and filmmakers emphasized in his book were made with ease of access in mind.5 At the same time as he acknowledges the problematic nature of shifting film canons, Williams concedes that in his analysis, “emphasis has been placed on films which can be seen without much difficulty.”6 Even Williams’s title smartly points to the limitations of his project, creating “a history” as opposed to “the history” and choosing “filmmaking” over “film” to connote an emphasis on authorship in place of a comprehensive overview of all manner of national film production. Distribution of traditional art cinema spawns scholarship addressing the same set of films, which in turn reinforces distribution trends toward auteurist films moving forward. Subsequently, more scholarship is created on the same set of filmmakers, and so on and so forth. Recently there has been a noticeable shift away from this closed system as broad histories of French cinema have made strides to seriously consider genre films alongside those made by the usual suspects of auteur directors. Wiley Blackwell’s edited volume A Companion to Contemporary French Cinema (2015) includes sections relating to contemporary genre film and the current state of the national film industry, moving away from the self-consciously selective model of Alan Williams or the dense but equally selective history of Roy Armes’s French Cinema (1985).7 Rémi Fournier-Lanzoni’s comprehensive French Cinema: From Its Beginnings to the Present (2002) provides a breath of fresh air as it deftly balances analysis of major auteurs and film movements with the sort of popular genre films that equally define the national cinema\n\nf rancis ve ber an d th e can on 5 within France, giving readers a more complete account of film history from a French perspective as opposed to a cherry-picked overview based solely on the types of films that gain traction abroad.8 Fournier-Lanzoni extends this project further with French Comedy on Screen: A Cinematic History (2014), providing a standalone history of the genre that implicitly argues for comedy’s importance and unpacks the nuances of performance, narrative, and social commentary.9 In both books, Fournier-Lanzoni considers the work of Francis Veber, but the scope of the projects inadvertently reduces his work to anecdotal or representative examples of broader trends in genre and national cinema. In France, Veber’s work has often been glossed over or even casually dismissed by scholars. Claude Beylie’s Une histoire du cinéma français (2000) moves away from the strict narrative approach of most film histories to give an almost encyclopedic overview of French cinema, with standalone entries for various actors and directors.10 Beylie includes an entry for Veber that highlights his popular success and the attention he has garnered from Hollywood.11 This entry is fleeting and somewhat flippant, but Veber is included. The appearance of Veber reads like Beylie checking off boxes as he attempts to be as inclusive as possible; a brief detour from the book’s broader project of handling genre films (les policiers, comedies) alongside auteurist art cinema and global Francophone film culture (Québec, Africa). Réné Prédal, on the other hand, trades in Beylie’s descriptive approach for a fiercely evaluative assessment of Veber. Writing in 1984, Prédal discusses Veber alongside other writer-turned-directors Jean-Paul Rappeneau, Michel Audiard, and JeanCharles Tacchela, only finding value in the directorial output of the latter.12 When discussing the early ’80s career turn of Gérard Depardieu, Prédal facetiously refers to Veber as an “immortal writer-director” following a screed where he laments actors being too stupid to judge the quality of their projects and collaborators.13 For Prédal, Depardieu’s decision to work with Veber on La chèvre and subsequent comedies is a tragic fall from grace after his previous collaborations with Marguerite Duras or Maurice Pialat. Prédal sees the pairing of Depardieu and Pierre Richard—the duo would make three films together for Veber—as “purely mathematical” economic calculations, seeing Veber and popular comedy as the best example of the dominance of commerce over art within 1980s French cinema.14 Prédal’s venom for Veber may easily be chalked up to broader critical sentiments toward comedy. Fournier-Lanzoni makes the case that only two “pure” comedies have been awarded the César for Best Film and, therefore, the genre is looked down upon by both critics and the French film industry despite it being their “financial backbone.”15 Of course, this is not a uniquely French phenomenon. The César Awards were inaugurated in 1976 and in the same timeframe only one comedy has won the Academy Award for Best Picture (Woody Allen’s Annie Hall in 1977).16 The stark divide in scholarship, however, may be more\n\n6 t he fi l m s o f f rancis ve be r i­ ndicative of the difference between perspectives on the importance of comedy in France and the U.S. As Fournier-Lanzoni writes, “. . . scholarly work on French comedies (non-silent, that is) is close to non-existent, except for rare works dealing mainly with particular auteurs such as Jacques Tati or Sacha Guitry.”17 Furthering his point later on, he states that, “French cinema, too often restricted to the work of a few ‘masters’ such as Truffaut or Renoir, sits uneasily between French literature and film studies, and it seems imperative to bridge this gap by turning some of the concerns and methods of current film studies toward comedy and popular culture.”18 Fournier-Lanzoni’s history of French film comedy is an important first step, but more work needs to be done to bridge the gap. ReFocus: The Films of Francis Veber strives to add detail and complexities to the above works, placing Veber in conversation with a broader history of both French and American cinema while providing concentrated analysis of his films. Although he is a major cinematic figure with wide name recognition, a book-length analysis of Veber has yet to be published. The scholarly neglect of his directorial career is at once confounding and predictable. Few directors have played such a prominent role in shaping the cinematic identity of France over the past forty years, yet his chosen genre of comedy has relegated his work to the margins of film studies. Veber’s 2010 memoir Que ça reste entre nous (the title translates to “It stays between us”) remains the only book-length publication dedicated to his career.19 Lacking analysis and scholarly context, Que ça reste entre nous is yet to be published in translation, limiting its readership to French speakers. What I hope to accomplish in the following pages is to provide a long overdue academic treatment of Veber’s career that also gives English speakers increased exposure to a writer-director who has had a pronounced impact on French cinema and shaped British and American consumption of French culture as well. Placing his career in a framework of high/low art debates and the contours of popular cinema in France, issues of taste, genre, canon, authorship, and cultural specificity will be major points of emphasis. Veber serves as an ideal vessel for exploring the use of comedy to make social commentary and the interplay between globalization and cultural specificity due to both his commitment to working within the genre (all twelve of his directorial credits are comedies, as are the vast majority of his screenplays) and a unique career split between France and the U.S. Veber uses comedy to critique class and privilege, often through the prism of François Perrin/ Pignon, a bumbling but good-hearted recurring character in his films. The political dimensions of Veber’s films are central to how his work is read within France, where his films remain popular decades after their initial release. The cultural specificity of his work has led to an awkward global translation, as Hollywood studios often remake his films rather than distributing subtitled\n\nf rancis ve ber an d th e can on 7 or dubbed versions of the originals. The nature of French comedy, steeped in cynicism and absurdity, is often incompatible with the tastes of an American audience, yet the success of Veber in France has provided Hollywood with the hope that his scenarios (and later his directorial approach) could be molded to fit American tastes. A central figure in a national cinema that has fought to remain significant and independent in the face of Hollywood’s encroachment, Veber alternately speaks to the viability of comedies made for a domestic French audience and the pull of money and recognition provided by American studios. Regardless of Veber’s sojourn in Hollywood and the large body of American adaptations of his screenplays, he is undoubtedly French through self-definition, cultural sensibilities, and reputation. Still, he is critically underexplored relative to the reach of his work. The idea for this book coincided with conversations and conflicts in teaching a French Cinema course for undergraduates. In looking to craft a syllabus that gave students a rigorous understanding of a national cinema without falling into the familiar traps of exclusivity, I wanted to balance the greatest hits of auteurist filmmaking with popular genre films rarely seen outside of France, much less explored in the context of an American university classroom. Veber’s films became a useful entry point for addressing comedy, domestic box office, and the international ambitions of French screen artists and studios. Pointing to the past, the success of his films and their continued place in the national imagination recall mainstays like La grande vadrouille and Les tontons flingueurs (1963, Georges Lautner). At the same time, his career foregrounds massive domestic hits like Bienvenue chez les Ch’tis (2008, Dany Boon) and Qu’est-ce qu’on a fait au Bon Dieu (2014, Philippe de Chauveron) both in finding financial success at home in the face of competition from big budget imports, and in the inability to fully translate humor and social context to a global audience. Ultimately, using Veber in the course became part of a much broader conversation about the ways in which national cinemas get defined, reduced, and dismissed within academia. As an undergraduate I took a global survey of film history that, in essence, encapsulated the recurring tensions of studying national cinemas from an American perspective. The course was taught by a respected scholar deeply invested in the auteurist debates that had shaped his entry into the discipline during the 1960s and 1970s. Along with formal analysis and contemplation of stylistic hallmarks came an embedded evaluation of films and filmmakers, mimicking Andrew Sarris’s preoccupation with lists and hierarchies. The sense of argumentation and declarations about value at the heart of this brand of auteurist film studies was invigorating to me as a student, but it also showed glaring weaknesses when evaluating work located outside of the established critical canon. One comment remains seared into my mind and informs the way I think about and teach national cinemas. In addressing South Asian\n\n8 t he fi l m s o f f rancis ve be r cinema this professor said, “India makes more films per year than any other country in the world, but aside from Satyajit Ray they’re all terrible, so you don’t have to worry about them.” That was the entirety of the semester’s discussion of Indian cinema. Apparently, from this professor’s vantage point at least, Ray’s films embody the sophistication and aesthetic richness of European art cinema while the thousands upon thousands of other films made in India are low-budget, formulaic genre trash. In a single sentence the massive body of Bollywood films, to say nothing of the linguistic, cultural, and aesthetic complexities of regional Indian production, had been firmly dismissed. That a national cinema as exciting and complicated as India’s could be so easily misrepresented by an otherwise thoughtful scholar made me question the viability of our approach to understanding and defining global film culture. Keep in mind that this was in the early 2000s, right on the cusp of important works by Tejaswini Ganti, Ranjani Mazumdar, and others who have created a subsequent flood of scholarship on Indian cinema that has either put an end to such thinking or at least exposed it as outmoded and uninformed. This wave of scholarship has not only redressed past omissions by filling in gaps, but has also challenged the criteria for critical investigation by opening up film studies to genres, regions, and modes of production once deemed unworthy of inquiry. I am not presumptuous enough to think that this book will cause the sort of sea change in academic inquiry that followed the work of Ganti and Mazumdar, but I do hope to play a small role in expanding the parameters of scholarship on French genre cinema. Francis Veber’s career is long overdue for analysis and it is time that his films, and screen comedy as a whole, are taken seriously. It is important to clarify what this book is and is not. Biographical details will be interwoven into the analysis, but this is not a long-form biography of Francis Veber. Nor is it a comprehensive guide to every screenplay he has written or his frustrations working with various directors, although his experiences working solely as a screenwriter will appear when relevant. While there will be contextual information to help situate my readings of individual films, this book is not a history of the French film industry, comedy as a genre, or French popular culture in the aftermath of the student protests of May 1968. Instead, this book is organized around textual analyses of each of Veber’s twelve directorial credits. A comparative analysis of American remakes will be included to examine the nature of transnational adaptation and Veber’s ongoing frustration with Hollywood in contrast to his self-contained model of writing and directing his own films. In the case of L’emmerdeur, Veber’s directorial effort will be placed in conversation with its cinematic predecessors. But rather than opening in medias res with Veber’s 1976 film Le jouet—a film he made when he was 39 years old, and more than a decade into his career as a writer—a brief overview of his background will help to situate the chapters that follow.\n\nf rancis ve ber an d th e can on 9\n\nveb e r b e c o m e s a w r i t e r Francis Veber was born on July 28, 1937 in the affluent Paris suburb of Neuilly to a Jewish father and an Armenian mother.20 Shaped by World War II and the Nazi occupation of Paris, Veber’s earliest memories of his father consist of a depressed man in pajamas living in hiding lest he should be caught and sent to a death camp.21 This developmental understanding of identity would eventually transform into a connection between persecution and humor that informs Veber’s writing and worldview. As the second sentence of his memoir states, “Deux génocides, deux murs des lamentations dans le sang, tout pour faire un comique” (“Two genocides, two walls of lamentations in the blood, all make a comic”).22 More than a defense mechanism, the interconnectedness of humor and such intense pain suggests that Veber fully understands comedy’s potential to be political, serious, and resistant. His films ruminate over deep emotional pain and alienation, but manage to read as cheerful and optimistic. Being able to compartmentalize pain, expressing it in the subtext while crafting commercially viable material, is just one of the ways in which his sophistication as a writer is evident. It would be difficult to overestimate the impact for Veber of having key years of his childhood development take place during World War II. If the pain of the Holocaust would manifest into a defensive impulse for humor and a fondness for outsider characters, the aftermath of the war can equally be seen in his future work. Marshall Plan aid and the U.S. military presence in the 1950s and 1960s brought American money, soldiers, and culture to France, leaving a legacy of simultaneous goodwill, suspicion, and resentment toward Americans. Of course, Veber had to become a writer first before finding a way to use his experience and surroundings to craft a career’s work. The ability and inclination to write did not happen by accident. Both of Veber’s parents were writers, as were his grandfather, uncle, and great-uncle.23 It was an intellectual household where politics were passionately discussed and a stream of visitors livened the conversation. It was also a household where he saw the struggles and financial uncertainties of writing as a profession. Francis describes himself during his school years as a weakling who struggled in math, gravitating toward languages and philosophy instead.24 Despite his inclination toward the humanities, Veber chose to pursue the sciences after lycée and studied to become a surgeon, devoting four years toward learning science and medicine at the Bercy Institute in Paris before realizing that a life as a doctor was not for him.25 Veber then joined the army, and it was there that he became a writer, working as a journalist for the military magazine Bled while stationed in Algeria.26 Veber reviled the “imbecilic machismo” of officers and, instead, found camaraderie with other likeminded army journalists who shared his anti-military sentiments.27 One of his fellow journalists was\n\n10 t he fi l ms o f f rancis ve be r army p ­ hotographer Just Jaeckin, the future film director who would become best known for making the transformative softcore hits Emmanuelle (1974) and Histoire d’O (1975). As Veber remembers, “he seemed to be the least complicated of us all, and . . . without a doubt the most happy.”28 The same could probably be said for Jaeckin as a director in the anxiety-riddled French film industry of the 1970s. Upon leaving the army Veber wrote for the magazine Lui, describing it as a sort of French answer to Playboy.29 It was there that he met his wife Françoise; they first worked together on an interview with the legendary actor Jean Gabin.30 Eventually shifting to Radio Luxembourg, Veber never regarded the time he spent as a journalist during his late twenties as anything resembling his life’s calling.31 As he would remember four decades later, “I was a very bad journalist.”32 Perhaps this was because he was simultaneously working as a journalist and planning to write for other mediums and formats, co-writing a musical comedy for the radio and publishing short stories in the mid-1960s before moving into television and theatre by the end of the decade.33 He was credited as a writer on the swinging television detective series Agence Intérim in 1969, and staged his first play at the Théâtre Édouard VII the year before. The play, L’enlèvement, was a modest success, running for six months.34 Rather than exceptional pieces of writing, his work on television and for the stage between 1968 and 1969 serve as the nexus to his cinematic career. While writing for Agence Intérim he met the comic actor Pierre Richard, another future collaborator in film director Édouard Molinaro, and, through Molinaro, Gaumont producer Alain Poiré.35 L’enlèvement, on the other hand, made the transition into the realm of movies more explicit when it was adapted into a feature film as Appelez-moi Mathilde (1969, Pierre Mondy, Call Me Mathilde). A transnational co-production between the French company Mondex and Columbia Pictures, Appelez-moi Mathilde revolves around the abduction of a wealthy woman (Jacqueline Maillan) by a gang of fumbling criminals. Curiously, it is the only major work of Veber’s career organized around a central female character. Its stage origins are abundantly clear as the vast majority of the action takes place within a single confined space, a country barn that serves as a hideout for the criminals. The plot touches on Cold War paranoia and class divisions, but Veber’s play largely serves as a venue for broad comedy consisting of ethnic caricatures—Chinese, Spanish, and rural American stereotypes are all present—and slapstick sound effects to accompany physical gags. Veber’s subsequent penchant for dark humor and fixation on suicide appear in Appelez-moi Mathilde, as does the character name François, which would eventually transform into his recurring François Perrin/Pignon character. Veber wrote the screenplay alongside director Pierre Mondy and while the film laid the groundwork for his subsequent\n\nf rancis ve ber an d th e can on 11 projects, it was far from the big break that made everything else possible. “It was not very good,” Veber would recall in a 1981 interview with Christian Salé, “and I had to wait three years before I was able to work again.”36 Not sitting by idly until film opportunities presented themselves, Veber staged his own play Le contrat in 1969 (later to be adapted for screen and retitled L’emmerdeur) and wrote the French stage adaptation of British playwright Alan Ayckbourn’s How the Other Half Loves, which was staged in Paris as Du côté de chez l’autre in 1971. If waiting three years for another screen credit was painful, the payoff was certainly worthwhile. Le grand blond avec une chaussure noire (1972, Yves Robert, The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe) became a major box office success, selling 3.4 million tickets in France.37 It garnered interest outside of France as well, making Veber an in-demand screenwriter. Starring Pierre Richard as François Perrin, an innocent concert violinist unwittingly caught in the middle of an espionage power play, the comedy is premised on misunderstandings and double entendre.38 Perrin is picked at random to serve as a red herring for police surveillance when coming down an airport escalator at Orly, wearing mismatched shoes (hence the film’s title) and carrying a violin case. Thought to be a master spy, this common man stumbles his way through a series of close calls and projections on the part of those spying on him to create the false impression of intrigue, mastery, and malevolence. One example comes when Perrin talks to a fellow musician on the phone about a concert in Munich where he “butchered Prokofiev,” which is then taken by the secret police to suggest he is an assassin who was hired to kill a high-ranking Soviet official. The film’s commentary on Cold War paranoia is far more developed and focused than in Appelez-moi Mathilde, but it is also a didactic address of the growing surveillance state and threats to privacy. In case the audience misses the point of the narrative, the film ends with text on the screen showing a passage from Article 9 of France’s penal code (“Chacun a le droit au respect de sa vie privée” or “Everyone has the right to respect for his or her private life”). The incompetent criminals and hit men that populate Le grand blond avec une chaussure noire bring to mind both the gallows humor and fixation on gangster tropes of comedies like Les tontons flingueurs, but there are distinct elements that reflect Veber’s style and sensibilities. Yet the film does not belong to Veber, either within the traditional conditions of film authorship residing with the director or his memory of the project. “I didn’t like the director,” Veber would say about Yves Robert three decades later.39 “It’s bad to say bad things about someone who’s dead,” he explains with a mischievous humor, “but at the same time I don’t risk anything now.”40 When Gaumont asked for a sequel, however, Veber agreed to continue his association with Robert and share writing credit with the director. Le retour du grand blond\n\n12 t he fi l ms o f f rancis ve be r (1974, The Return of the Tall Blond Man) moves away from political commentary to satirize James Bond films and repeats gags from the initial film, this time having Perrin’s foot fall into a bucket of red paint at the airport to mirror the mismatched shoe from two years earlier. This element of the sequel partly explains the title change when Le grand blond avec une chaussure noire was remade by Twentieth Century Fox as The Man with One Red Shoe (1985, Stan Dragoti). In the immediate aftermath of his success with Le grand blond, Veber was constantly working. His 1971 stage play Le contrat was adapted to the screen in 1973 as L’emmerdeur by Édouard Molinaro, beginning a long line of collaborations between Veber and the director that include the dramatic comedy about labor negotiations Le téléphone rose (1975), their screen adaptation of Jean Poiret’s play La cage aux folles (1978), and the sequel La cage aux folles II (1980). Veber liked Molinaro personally, but the professional frustrations he had with Yves Robert were just as pronounced with Molinaro. From Veber’s standpoint, Molinaro required a finished screenplay to begin working and was unable to shape the material beyond what was already there on the page.41 Veber would also write the screenplay for the detective film Adieu Poulet (1975, Pierre Granier-Deferre, The French Detective) starring Lino Ventura, and declined screen credit for the Jean-Paul Belmondo spy spoof Le magnifique (1973, Philippe de Broca, The Man from Acapulco). Unhappy with the latter, Veber would remark that denying the use of his name is “the only recourse left to a writer when the film adaptation is bad.”42 Refusing to have his name appear in the credits, much less feeling that it was his only form of agency as a screenwriter, speaks to his growing frustrations. Veber claims to have written eighteen screenplays before Le jouet in 1976, all of them earmarked for other directors and only some of them realized on screen.43 More importantly, he found the collaborative relationship between writers and directors untenable. “I didn’t have any close relationships with directors,” Veber explains. “It’s why I started directing myself.”44 Reflecting on the solitary practice of writing and his growing displeasure at handing his creations off to someone else, he says, “I was always frustrated by what the directors were doing with my movies. Not saying that I would have done better, you know, but I would be closer to my music. The music I have in my mind when I’m writing.”45 After reading Veber’s screenplay for Le jouet his friend Claude Berri, a film director, urged him to take the plunge and start directing his own material. As Veber recalls, he took Berri’s advice to heart “and my life changed completely.”46\n\nf rancis ve ber an d th e can on 13\n\nno t e s 1.

Instead, the boy was staring directly at him. Not knowing anything about the boy or the reason for his gaze, Veber’s mind filled in the blanks by imagining that the child was the son of a millionaire who, if he wanted to, could point to the journalist and have his father purchase him. It was a thought that filled Veber with fear, premised only from a child’s stare and an odd indifference to being surrounded by toys. “The child didn’t buy me,” Veber recalls, “but the subject of Le jouet was born.”2 That this passing moment resonated with Veber so powerfully, staying with him for more than a decade before he used it as the foundation of a screenplay, suggests more than a writer’s need to cultivate personal experiences to craft stories. The lasting impression from this moment at the toy showcase signifies a profound sense of injustice bound to class division that reflects the political landscape of the years in which Le jouet was in creative gestation. The May 1968 demonstrations are the most visible manifestation of broader disaffection with de Gaulle, contemporary capitalism, and the power dynamics of daily life in France. The protests were also a venue for self-examination that can be seen in films, novels, plays, and music produced in France both before and after May ’68. The concerns over modern capitalism’s role in limiting critical thought and the diminished avenues for dissent permeate the era’s rhetoric, with both the press and the arts as key institutions vulnerable to corporate power and state control. France in the late 1960s was alternately without progress and progressing too fast, lacking effective redress of poverty, sexism, racism, and educational failures while reshaping the country into a simulacrum\n\n16 t he fi l ms o f f rancis ve be r of the United States in its architecture, infrastructure, and consumer culture. Didactic examples like 2 ou 3 choses que je sais d’elle . . . (1967, Jean-Luc Godard, 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her . . .) crystallize the combative nature of auteur directors toward the atmosphere of modern France. From the film’s opening shot, capturing the construction of a highway overpass, to the final frame of consumer products systematically arranged on a grass lawn, Godard’s commentary continually intersects with the political and social influence of the United States. The landscape of Paris, particularly its suburban fringes, was being transformed to look like America while its people were urged to act and think like Americans. More than the commentaries of a handful of nouvelle vague filmmakers in the limited milieu of 1968, Alison Smith argues in French Cinema in the 1970s: Echoes of May that the demonstrations of that year caused a cultural revolution, changing what mainstream audiences saw in the years to follow.3 Relaxed censorship and an altered mass consciousness brought with them films that carried on the legacy of May ’68 well into the following decade through formal experimentation, leftist political commentary, and the boom in softcore pornography.4 As the title of her book suggests, the 1970s were defined by the protests of the 1960s and its films were constantly grappling with the ideas and conflicts central to the uprising. Smith outlines three themes that are prominent in the discourse of postMay ’68 French cinema. First, “the possibility of destruction of hierarchical structures of society and of certain redistribution of power towards the base.”5 This, of course, is not limited to state power but also encompasses corporations and cultural institutions. Second, Smith points to “the famous desire for prise de parole on the part of those for whom others ‘spoke,’ articulated mischievously by one of the Sorbonne graffiti: ‘Je ne sais pas quoi dire, mais j’ai envie de le dire.’ ”6 The sentiment of the graffiti (translated: “I don’t know what to say, but I want to say it”) within the context of filmmakers and the movie industry equates to a call for expanded access to the materials and means for using cinema as a medium for free expression. Third, Smith points to 1970s French cinema’s recurring “notion that ‘everything is political,’ that the economic system and structures of power relations extend to cultural and sexual life and are to be combated there as well as in the workplace.”7 The idea that “everything is political” extends beyond the auteurist works at the heart of Smith’s analysis (those of Godard, Chris Marker, William Klein, and Alain Tanner) and, instead, suggests a need for close readings of a wide spectrum of films from the era. Comedy would play a central role in capturing the mood of France in the 1970s. As Fournier-Lanzoni observes, French comedies of the decade “appeared as a much more transparent medium since its thematic content translated not only the state of mind of an eventful era but also, uniquely, the\n\nt oy story 17 physical and emotional background of contemporary society.”8 As Le grand blond avec une chaussure noire illustrates, the satirizing of Cold War paranoia and the growing surveillance state is strengthened through the visceral connection to a character’s victimization, using Pierre Richard’s performance as a physical embodiment of an entire nation being unknowingly spied upon and used as pawns. Despite the film’s overt political commentary, Veber’s relationship to the wave of protest that changed France is not particularly strong. His films show an interest in class struggle and the dispossessed, but as Veber acknowledges in his memoir, he completely missed the May ’68 protests.9 Instead, he was holed up in isolation writing the play L’enlèvement. Nevertheless, his body of work functions as a window into the changing national political tenor throughout the years. Each of his films uses a contemporary setting, never delving into period piece reflection or speculative visions of the future. His films are of their time and, as such, channel the key issues and conflicts surrounding the eras in which they were made. Reading Veber as a political filmmaker follows both Smith’s argument that for French cinema in the aftermath of May ’68 “everything is political” and Fournier-Lazoni’s claims about the unique position of comedy to make social commentary, but it deviates from broader historical overviews of Europe in the 1970s. As Tony Judt argues in Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945, the ideological concerns and political activism of the 1960s were lost in the 1970s as unemployment and the aging of student protesters replaced communal concerns with self-interest.10 Judt’s observation is not another hand-wringing critique of the Me Generation’s vapid narcissism, but rather an appreciation of the seriousness of the economic climate. For a generation of young people entering adulthood who grew up enjoying the growth and prosperity of the postwar “miracle” years, the economic downturn of the 1970s, defined by job insecurity, inflation, and stagflation, was particularly distressing. Rather than seeing the broadly defined goals of the 1960s and the more localized concerns of the 1970s as mutually exclusive, French cinema in the aftermath of the May events suggest the melding of the two. This mix of revolutionary rhetoric from the 1960s and the very personal concerns of the 1970s are the contextual backbone of Le jouet. The film and its central character simultaneously seek to speak truth to power and argue that everyone should be afforded the opportunity to make a living.\n\nle f i l m After writing both Le grand blond avec une chaussure noire and Le retour du grand blond, the connection between Veber and the comedic actor Pierre Richard had been firmly established both professionally and within the public imagination.\n\n18 t he fi l ms o f f rancis ve be r\n\nFigure 2.1 François Perrin (Pierre Richard) expresses his solidarity with a subjugated Sioux chief (Paul Horn).\n\nIn fact, when Gaumont suggested a sequel to Le grand blond it was director Yves Robert who took convincing, not Veber or Richard.11 Curiously, considering Richard and Veber’s decade-long professional connection, the actor refers to Yves Robert as the possessive figure when describing Le grand blond, not the writer, highlighting deeply held assumptions about film authorship.12 Veber has stated that his writing is not only done in isolation, but that he crafts stories without thinking about the particulars of the film adaptation.13 If Veber’s claims are to be believed, the story and the characters exist on the page free from the needs of a studio or the sensibilities of possible collaborators. Obviously, this was not the case with Le retour du grand blond and it does not reflect his propensity as a director to write characters with particular actors in mind. For Le jouet, as a case in point, the screenplay was envisioned and executed for Pierre Richard.14 Three years Veber’s senior, Richard was born in 1934 and followed in his family’s theatrical footsteps, making his way to television and film through the success of earlier performances in music halls and cabaret theatre. FournierLanzoni connects Richard to the burlesque elements at the heart of Jacques Tati, Charles Chaplin, and Max Linder’s screen personas and physical comedy.15 Like them, Richard is a director as well as an actor, working behind the camera on seven films, starring in all of them, and contributing to the screenplays. Nevertheless, he has never been granted the same status as an auteur performer.16 Richard does not see himself as a continuation of Tati, but instead envisions his comedy in the mode of American performers like Danny Kaye, Jerry Lewis, and the Marx Brothers.17 His success in the early 1970s\n\nt oy story 19 came amid the deaths of French comedic icons Bourvil (who died in 1970) and Fernandel (who passed in 1971) and the end of Tati’s presence on the screen (his last theatrically released film, Trafic, came in 1971), allowing Richard to fill the void as France’s premier comedic actor.18 Richard’s performances are physical and chaotic, but underpinned by human frailty. Often oblivious to the surrounding world, Richard’s characters have a tendency to leave a wake of destruction in their path. Le jouet is a rare instance where his impact on the world around him is calculated and controlled. It is also a rare instance of restraint in a Richard performance, coming after a contentious start to shooting with Veber having to disabuse the actor of his clownish tendencies.19 Contradicting Veber’s claim that a conversation with Claude Berri prompted him to step behind the camera and direct his own screenplay, Richard assumes credit for the decision by recalling his own urging being the key factor in Veber taking on dual roles with Le jouet. Reading the screenplay, Richard says that he found the material to be profoundly original and impossible to fully realize by another director, so he recalls telling Veber, “You’re never satisfied with the directors of the films you write.” Remembering making a direct plea, Richard claims to have followed up this observation by telling Veber, “Do it yourself.”20 Regardless of whether the suggestion came from Berri or Richard, the decision to direct Le jouet himself placed Veber in an unfamiliar role of having to conceptualize performance, cinematography, and mise en scène as well as narrative and dialogue. Upon the suggestion that he direct, Veber remembers protesting that he didn’t “know anything” about filmmaking, but Berri reassured him by saying, “It’s not important. We’re going to choose a good technical advisor and everything will go well.”21 This sense that commitment to the material could supersede technical knowledge and directing experience not only freed Veber to step behind the camera for Le jouet, but informs the stripped-down aesthetics of his body of work as a director. Having been most closely linked to Yves Robert and Édouard Molinaro as collaborators, Veber’s visual style is much closer to Robert. Long takes and traditional editing between characters in medium shots and close-ups replace the frenetic handheld camera of Molinaro’s films, showing that although Veber did not personally like Robert, he did appreciate his approach to directing comedy in a manner that foregrounds performance and dialogue. While the camera placements are conventional, Veber’s approach on set was to workshop each scene in the moment. As Richard explains, it was as if Veber needed the “whirring of the cameras” to start conceptualizing and refining performance, turning the film set into a theatrical stage through constant blocking, notes on inflection, and repetition that typically reached upwards of thirty takes.22 His penchant for multiple takes did not follow an improvisational approach, but rather exhibited a playwright’s perfection in communicating dialogue and\n\n20 t he fi l ms o f f rancis ve be r tone. Veber’s directorial approach is to shape performances rather than have performances reshape his writing. The story of Le jouet revolves around an out-of-work journalist named François Perrin (Pierre Richard) and the levels of degradation inherent in modern corporate culture. Having been out of work for over a year, Perrin interviews for a position at France Hebdo, a weekly magazine owned by billionaire Pierre Rambal-Cochet (Michel Bouquet). Bearded at the beginning of the film, Perrin is asked by the interviewer to shave in order to conform to the corporate expectations. It is a small indignity that presages more to come. Having been hired, Perrin observes the cruelties and arbitrary nature of labor under Rambal-Cochet, with one of his colleagues at the magazine fired for having sweaty hands when greeting his billionaire boss. Perrin reports on a meeting of business executives led by Rambal-Cochet before being asked to write a story about the season’s newest toys, requiring a visit to a department store also owned by Rambal-Cochet. Inside the store, Perrin is spotted by Eric (Fabrice Greco), the billionaire’s young son. Eric has been sent by his father to choose anything in the store he wants, flanked by seven mid-level executives. In an act of defiance, Eric points his finger at Perrin and says simply, “Ça.” After briefly trying to reason with the child, the executive in charge (Michel Aumont) gives in to the child’s demand and negotiates with Perrin to come home with the child as his personal toy. Fearing that he will lose his job, Perrin agrees. Entering the Rambal-Cochet mansion packed in a wooden crate, Perrin is asked to serve as a personal plaything for a spoiled and mean-spirited child, going so far as to adopt the name Julien at the child’s request. The journalist shows resentment and defiance toward Eric, but develops a level of empathy over time as he understands that the child has been emotionally neglected by his father, with material gifts meant to substitute for parental love. Together, Perrin and Eric vent their frustrations by making their own self-published newspaper (named “Le jouet”), serving as investigative reporters to expose the numerous personal and professional misdeeds of Eric’s father. The arrangement ends, and Eric runs away to be with Perrin rather than return to boarding school. The final scene of the film shows the billionaire picking up his son in a limousine and explaining to Eric that Perrin is “nothing.” Eric opens the door to the car and runs back to Perrin on the sidewalk, leaping into his arms. Perrin looks back at Rambal-Cochet with one arm extended as if to ask, “What can I say? The child chooses me.” Ending in a freeze frame, the shot is a physical exclamation left for the spectator to ponder as the credits roll. The choice of the common man over vicious affluence is the culmination of a commentary on wealth and corporate culture that is embedded throughout, beginning with the opening shot of Le jouet. Mounted on a rooftop to capture an image of the Eiffel Tower from the distance of a few blocks, the camera pans right to find a slim white pennant flag flapping in the wind with a black hexago-\n\nt oy story 21 nal logo and the letters “FH.” Tilting down to show the side of the four-story building, the camera finds a figure walking into the large entrance. On the surface this appears to be a simple establishing shot, unambiguously placing the setting as Paris while using the FH logo to announce that the building is the headquarters of France Hebdo with the central character walking inside the front door. This is a function of the shot, of course, but there is also symbolic value to the simple pan. Shifting the image from the Eiffel Tower to an old building that is now the headquarters of a corporate holding, branded with a flag on top, there is the suggestion that national identity is being replaced by corporate identity. The image is just one instance where Veber displays an understanding of visual language that complements his dialogue, using symbols and motifs to reinforce the story’s themes. Veber has expressed an admiration of Orson Welles and his use of mise en scène to convey meaning, and Le jouet displays Veber’s most ambitious use of symbolic visuals.23 The axis of the film’s conflict, both external and internal, comes in the interview scene. Sitting down with body language expressing the anxiety and awkwardness of the job applicant, Perrin is caught off guard by the first question. After lighting a cigarette, France Hebdo’s editor-in-chief, Blénac (Jacques François) dryly asks Perrin, “Do you have much affection for your beard?” Perrin is confused, leading Blénac to clarify by saying, “I advise you to shave it off. Mr. Rambal-Cochet doesn’t like beards.” Perrin attempts both humor and tentative resolve by responding, “Maybe a good journalist can carry off a beard.” Blénac admonishes him, explaining that the magazine’s culture is completely under the control of Rambal-Cochet, and Veber uses a hard cut to clean-shaven Perrin riding in a France Hedbo car on his first day at work to emphasize his capitulation. The brevity of the interview has comedic effect, but its arbitrary nature gives voice to the sense of frustration in Perrin’s later admission that he had been out of work for seventeen months by showing that all he had to do was show up at France Hebdo. There are no questions about his background or qualifications, nor is there a discussion of what type of work he will be doing for the magazine. Only his facial hair is discussed. The demand is part of a power play, reinforced by the symbols of power on Blénac’s desk, from his gold cigarette case to his ridiculously large lighter. Blénac’s insistence that Perrin shave his beard not only touches on the arbitrary power plays in corporate culture, but also speaks to the continued resistance to countercultural fashion by elder power figures. Pierre Richard’s distinctive blond locks are even more untamed here than in other films, creating an impression along with the beard that Perrin is either an eccentric or a radical despite wearing a suit. His willingness to compromise his appearance for the sake of expediency is understandable given his joblessness, but this small indignity will be followed by others. It is not the first compromise for Perrin, however. Before being called in to speak with Blénac, Perrin sits on a couch in\n\n22 t he fi l ms o f f rancis ve be r the waiting area looking over back issues of the magazine he hopes to join as a writer. He flips through the pages quickly, looking for something of interest, only to be disappointed with the content. For Perrin, simply finding himself at this office is an indignity, working for an uninspiring weekly magazine owned by a vast conglomerate. As he soon finds out, his fears are well founded as the corporate control of the magazine interferes with his ability to work as a legitimate journalist. Perrin’s first assignment is to cover a business banquet for Rambal-Cochet managers and executives being held outside of one of his factories. The long shot establishing the setting recalls images from Ozu, Antonioni, and Godard showing the stark lifelessness of postwar industrial landscapes. Men in suits standing around a long table, showing moneyed traditions tied to the past forming an awkward alliance with modernism, with the shot serving as a gag in and of itself, echoing the absurdist imagery of Fellini, Buñuel, and Tati. The composition of the establishing shot is compelling, but ultimately an afterthought to a gag that dominates the scene. Seated at three long tables, the guests are served their meals while they wait for Rambal-Cochet to arrive. When the billionaire finally arrives he seats himself at the head of the long center table, his chair a meter away from the edge. Rather than adjusting his chair to get closer to the table, he pulls the table closer, leaving the rest of the guests to scramble to match their plates and drinks to the altered place settings. Fearful of the man’s power, no one questions the move or readjusts the table. Here, the desire of one supersedes the needs of many. Seated at the table, Perrin is disgusted but fails to act, his silence coming in the service of self-interest. His character—which would transform into François Pignon in subsequent films—is an innocent in many respects, but also complicit. At their best, Veber’s films blur the lines between right and wrong to transcend being simple morality tales. Veber has expressed his admiration for Frank Capra, but his films depart from Capra’s sincerity and straightforward object lessons.24 The premise of purchasing a man to be a child’s plaything is not an uncomplicated transaction with one party in the right while the other is being wronged. This moves away from Pierre Richard’s belief that audiences identify with his performances because he symbolizes the oppressed, victimized, and innocent.25 In Le jouet he represents all three, but he also slips into their converse roles, becoming at times an oppressor, victimizer, and guilty. Perrin shows complicity in how power is conceptualized and enacted. Before being spotted in the department store by Eric, Perrin and his photographer are given a tour of the toy section. Pointing out toys manufactured in Japan, Italy, England, and the U.S., the store’s saleswoman stops upon what she calls “an authentic American Indian.” It is a living, breathing man of Sioux heritage brought to France (and then the department store) from the Dakotas. He is wearing a feathered headdress and standing still enough to be confused for\n\nt oy story 23 one of the store’s mannequins. Continuing, the manager states that, “there are only a few left in stock.” If this is a joke about the extermination of indigenous people in the Americas, it is in poor taste. If it is a genuine statement about the man being for sale, it is just as bad. The photographer points out that it is the same Sioux man who had protested against the U.S. government a few months earlier. That action, presumably, led to his subjugation. Perrin laughs nervously and approaches the man, making a peace sign before shaking his hand and doing his best to communicate. Speaking slowly and mixing French with his limited English, Perrin says, “Américain mauvais, bad! Indien good, bon! I am with you.” The handshake lingers and Perrin struggles to break free of the embrace, making it clear that his show of solidarity has limitations. Once Eric stumbles upon Perrin and the executive explains that the child wants him to serve as his personal toy, there is a moment of frustration and confusion. Perrin paces in the store, glancing at the Sioux man standing across the aisle, and instinctively pleads to the executive, “He doesn’t want the Indian?” The show of solidarity just moments earlier, linking the leftist journalist to a broader global struggle against oppression, disappears as his instinct for self-preservation takes over. When presented with the possibility of being subjugated, Perrin attempts to assert his white privilege. The American Indian, he assumes, would be more amenable to subjugation. In this moment, despite his statements to the contrary, Perrin abandons his progressive worldview. It is a role reversal gag, but the joke has serious ramifications. The film is preoccupied with role-playing and the fluidity of outward identity. From Perrin assuming the name of Julien to the multiple iterations of dress-up and playacting, Eric and his friend-for-hire make a habit of escaping from their reality through costume and performance. Unlike childish masquerading, there are consequences to these performances. When the two drive around inside the mansion in a go-kart, Eric forces Perrin to pretend to be a traffic cop and humiliate one of the butlers. Hesitant to perform as a policeman, Perrin soon relishes the role, taking it a step beyond Eric’s imagined scenario by arresting the child and locking him inside of a cupboard. Perrin finds freedom in performing a character to combat the child’s cruelty, using the role-play scenario as a tool of defiance. At the same time, there is a sense that Perrin loses himself momentarily and relishes the power, albeit impermanent. Perrin plays another role, forced to wear a cowboy costume for horse riding lessons and, later, during a garden party for rich and influential friends of Rambal-Cochet. On the way to the riding lesson, Perrin fully understands the implications of outward appearance when he steps out of the car in the middle of Paris, intent on leaving behind Rambal-Cochet and Eric for good, only to find himself outside of the same department store from earlier and face to face with the Sioux man. From professing to be “with” him when they met to wearing the clothes of his oppressor, Perrin’s transformation is complete.\n\n24 t he fi l ms o f f rancis ve be r Yet the Western wear can also be used to counteract power, providing Perrin with plausible deniability to get revenge as he and Eric ruin the garden party under the guise of playing. Coinciding with a union protest that is kept safely at bay behind the gates of the estate, Perrin’s use of destructive performance is far more effectual than traditional protest. The most developed role-play scenario in the film surrounds Perrin and Eric pretending to be journalists. By starting an underground newspaper that will speak truth to power, Perrin reverses his first compromise of the film in agreeing to write for an apolitical corporate mouthpiece like France Hebdo. With Eric as the editor and Perrin as lead reporter, the duo publish an exposé of the scandalous personal life and business practices of Rambal-Cochet. Eric is given an object lesson when he witnesses his father walk into a country home and buy the house on the spot, forcing a family sitting at their dinner table to leave immediately once their price has been met. Told in flashback, the scene disrupts the narrative, but his sharing the story with Perrin indicates that the act of reporting has raised his consciousness. Whereas Rambal-Cochet wants his son to understand that everyone has a price and that wealth comes with great power, his son begins to understand that a free press provides a way to counteract such abuses of power. For Veber, Perrin’s reclamation of his journalistic integrity is more significant than a compromised character finding vindication. It functions along the lines of a common trope found in Hollywood musicals where a central character is a dancer, musician, or show person fighting against conformity with their art. The musical, therefore, argues for the value of musical people. In Le jouet, Veber uses a protagonist who is a journalist and romanticizes the act of writing to profess the value of his own profession. Using details from his own life, including an aside from one of the journalists about covering the Festival de Cannes, reinforces the idea that Perrin is a stand-in for Veber, or at least for the portion of his life spent at Bled, Lui, and Radio Luxembourg. The makeshift newspaper and the observations of Eric and Perrin tell only part of the story. The narrative explores spaces that neither character inhabits, underscoring both the abuses of power and the grotesque nature of compliance born out of self-interest. Following the release of the paper, which Perrin and Eric distribute to both the staff working at the mansion and colleagues at France Hebdo, Rambal-Cochet calls the editor Blénac into his office to upbraid him over the embarrassment. Asserting his power, Rambal-Cochet sits impassively behind his desk and demands that Blénac take his clothes off immediately. After a moment’s hesitation and a repeated demand Blénac concedes and slowly drops his pants. Sizing him up, Rambal-Cochet asks, “Who is the monster? Me for asking you to drop your pants or you for agreeing to show your ass?” It is a poignant question that does not redeem the billionaire, but allows him to make a valid point about culpability. This falls in line with the\n\nt oy story 25 film’s overall commentary, which is not just about the evils of wealth and power, but also the compromises made out of self-interest and fear that allow systemic abuses to remain unchallenged. Perrin voices the same question that Rambal-Cochet expresses in earlier dialogue. Talking to a governess who lives in fear working for the billionaire and suffers from awful treatment on the part of Eric, Perrin asks, “Why do you stay? Are governesses unemployed?” Aware that she needs work, he also tries to communicate to her that she has agency. At the same time, he is unaware that the question more directly implicates his own choices. Disturbingly, his agreeing to become Eric’s personal toy is not tied to a specific promise or contract. When the department store manager discusses the proposal there is no mention of money, only vague allusions and assumptions about job stability. Perrin does not agree to degrade himself in order to advance his financial situation. He does so simply to maintain his already meager status. Eric pushes his father’s offer to extremes when he is told that he can choose anything he likes from the store, but this is only made possible by the manager’s fear of intervening in a situation he knows is wrong. His fear that he will experience the wrath of his superior speaks to the propulsive inhumanity of power. Rambal-Cochet has never ordered the purchase or humiliation of Perrin, but his power is such, even in absentia, that underlings will discount their own better judgment and moral compass in the vague pursuit of pleasing their boss. To use a heavy-handed and extreme example, it recalls historian Ian Kershaw’s concept of “working toward the Führer” in that fear and self-interest can have disastrous momentum that have nothing to do with the explicit instructions of a leadership figure.26 By questioning the governess without also interrogating his own refusal to exert agency, Perrin stumbles upon the unspoken nature of the apparatus of labor that keeps the rich in power. This is all very heady subtext for a popular comedy, but Veber would acknowledge that Le jouet was envisioned as a departure from the “common comedies” he had written in the past, crafting a much more serious film instead.27\n\nle r e m ak e The primary response of audiences in France and abroad was not to the political underpinnings of Le jouet, but to the comedy. Veber’s inventive gags and Richard’s physicality combine for a film that is at once situated within the social milieu of France and universal in its appeal. The film played throughout Europe and even received a limited theatrical run in the U.S. in 1979 under the English title The Toy. Coming on the heels of the surprise box office success of La cage aux folles, which had opened in the U.S. in April of 1979 and grossed an astounding $20.4 million in North America, distributors hoped to\n\n26 t he fi l ms o f f rancis ve be r\n\nFigure 2.2 Jack Brown (Richard Pryor) is purchased by white executives (Ned Beatty and Don Hood) with the rebel flag lurking in the background.\n\nmine Veber’s back catalog for another crossover hit.28 Interest overseas did not stop there for Veber, as Billy Wilder optioned L’emmerdeur and adapted it as Buddy Buddy in 1981. Paramount signed Veber to write the screenplay for the English-language comedy Partners (1982, James Burrows), and Le jouet was optioned by Columbia and adapted as The Toy (1982, Richard Donner). The first of his directorial efforts to be remade in Hollywood—four more would follow over the years—The Toy challenges notions that there is universality in comedic gags and is a cautionary tale in adaptation, at least on an artistic level. Donner’s adaptation would make $47.1 million at the domestic box office, the fourteenth highest grossing film of 1982, laying the groundwork for future Hollywood remakes of Veber’s film regardless of negative critical response.29 The enthusiastic response at the box office to The Toy was primarily due to public fascination with its star, Richard Pryor. A little over two years removed from his near-death experience at his Northridge home, where Pryor lit himself on fire and suffered severe burns across his body, the notoriety surrounding the incident lifted Pryor’s public profile and for a few years turned him into Hollywood’s biggest box-office draw. The Toy followed Stir Crazy (1980, Sidney Poitier), Bustin’ Loose (1981, Oz Scott), Some Kind of Hero (1982, Michael Pressman), and the standup concert film Richard Pryor:\n\nt oy story 27 Live on the Sunset Strip (1982, Joe Layton) as post-Northridge releases that all over-performed at the box office.30 On paper, The Toy made sense. Pryor’s star was in ascendance, but the studio needed a readymade screenplay that would allow them to bypass time spent in development. Veber’s film had been a modest success in France with 1.25 million tickets sold, but Pryor could be slotted into Richard’s role, repeating his physical gags for an American audience largely unaware of the original text.31 In terms of short-term financial success, Columbia made the right decision. As far as respecting Veber’s material, tastefully transferring the narrative to an American setting, and providing a worthwhile venue for Pryor’s talents, The Toy is a confounding undertaking. As would be the case with almost all of Hollywood’s adaptations of Veber’s work (the lone exception being 2010’s Dinner for Schmucks), The Toy is remarkably faithful to the structure and details of the source material. The narrative arc remains unchanged and numerous gags are repeated with such proximity that it would not come as a surprise if Donner or his cinematographer Lázló Kovács used screenshots from Le jouet for framing and decorating their shots. Not that fidelity is the mark of a successful adaptation (in fact, I will be arguing the opposite in the following chapters), but modifications to crucial details in Veber’s original film account for the most troubling aspects of The Toy. In casting Pryor and changing the setting from Paris to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, The Toy reframes the central conflict along racial and geographic lines, creating a neo-slavery narrative. Whereas François Perrin performs the duty as Eric’s toy as an assumed extension of his employment as France Hebdo, Pryor’s Jack Brown is purchased outright. The transaction, framed in a medium shot with Jack at the center of the frame and an executive on each side of him, takes place in the toy section of a department store. Directly over Jack’s shoulder at the center of the frame is a Confederate flag (perhaps a piece of Dukes of Hazzard merchandise?). As the executives shower Jack with cash, he says, “I can’t be bought. No. This was settled in the Civil War. You can’t have slaves.” Two seconds later, Brown concedes and proves that he can indeed be bought. The dialogue shows that Donner and screenwriter Carol Sobieski are aware of the altered political subtext by casting Pryor and setting the film in the American South, but Jack’s fleeting protest and the muted commentary elsewhere in the film makes the slavery analogy subtext rather than text. The union protest outside of the garden party is replaced by an anti-KKK demonstration, but by and large Le jouet’s indictment of corrupting power, corporate culture, and self-interest is translated into a mélange of platitudes about love and friendship in The Toy. Underneath all of this is a cavalcade of debilitating racist tropes and the use of Pryor as a checklist for historical stereotypes of African Americans in Hollywood films. An out-of-work journalist, Jack does not get hired at a magazine like François Perrin. Instead, he accepts a job for the same company\n\n28 t he fi l ms o f f rancis ve be r working as a domestic servant and, later, a janitor. Emasculated by wearing a French maid’s outfit and adopting the expressive frightened posture of archetypal coon performers from the past like Mantan Moreland, Pryor’s image throughout the film is a throwback to the relationship between comedic intent and the black body on screen being rooted in humiliation and victimization. Moreover, Pryor’s performance is broad and clownish, completely departing from the restraint shown by Pierre Richard in Le jouet. Unfortunately, poor performances in films unworthy of his talents would be the rule, not the exception, of Pryor’s long sojourn in Hollywood. The ending of Le jouet, with Eric running away to choose Perrin over his father, is reversed into a saccharine sweet conclusion with Jack giving a heartfelt speech to the boy about his father’s deep love for him. Dampening Veber’s critique of wealth and power, the billionaire in The Toy, Jackie Gleason’s U.S. Bates, is ultimately redeemable. Donner’s film has no semblance of political purpose, replacing the critiques of Veber’s original with asides and allusions that fail to cohere. Eric’s governess is reimagined as a nymphomaniac lusting after Jack, and also a closet Nazi who watches Hitler speeches when alone in her bedroom. The cold, calculating, and intelligent young wife of RambalCochet becomes an empty-headed blonde trophy wife with prominent cleavage. Even the use of comic characters in the mise en scène is altered enough to change meaning, as Jack and Eric wear Spiderman pajamas in The Toy, an empty signifier, whereas the enormous cutouts of Marvel characters and the prominent placement of Captain America in early shots of Eric in Le jouet reinforce a broader commentary about the Americanization of French culture. Sobieski’s script changes the tone of the comedy, departing from Veber’s crafted dialogue with clumsy earnestness and juvenile wordplay. For example, the formal greeting from servants and staff of “Monsieur Eric” in Veber’s film becomes the recurring pun “Master Bates” in the remake. There is nothing inherently wrong with transforming the meaning of source material and the decision to use Le jouet’s premise to explore race could have made for a compelling film, but the rushed nature of the project, hoping to capitalize on Pryor’s newfound drawing power at the box office, never allowed it to be fully realized as a workable social commentary. In comparison to Veber’s film, The Toy both underscores the difficulty in adapting comedy for a new set of cultural sensibilities and makes the whiteness of Veber’s œuvre strikingly apparent. France has a long tradition of race-based satires and comedies dealing with African immigration, yet Veber’s films largely avoid direct discussions of identity politics despite his own self-identification as being Jewish and Armenian.32 What The Toy suggests, however, is not that Veber’s source material is bereft of racial commentary. The project of adaptation reveals that commentaries on identity are embedded within the broader themes of his plots and characters. Unlike Jewish writers who use novels to directly explore\n\nt oy story 29 their ethnic identity via Jewish characters—Philip Roth’s Portnoy’s Complaint (1969) and Saul Bellow’s Herzog (1964) come to mind—Veber’s body of work may reflect the approach of Bernard Malamud’s The Natural (1954), where the outsider Gentile character of Roy Hobbs can be read as an allegory of the Jewish experience in America. Veber’s development of François Perrin into the recurring character of François Pignon in the years following the release of Le jouet invites such symbolic examination.\n\nno t e s 1.

To the contrary, he continued in his previous mode of writing screenplays for other directors and enjoyed his greatest success to date with La cage aux folles in 1978. The following year Veber would write two films built around the recurring character named François Perrin. Based on a story concept by Alain Godard, Coup de tête (1979, Jean-Jacques Annaud) imagines Perrin (Patrick Deweare) as a hotheaded football player who seeks revenge against rival players from his club after he is falsely accused of rape and imprisoned. Not a particularly joyful premise, Coup de tête would be one of the most positive experiences of Veber’s career, citing Jean-Jacques Annaud years later as his favorite of all the directors he had worked with as a screenwriter.1 Like Veber, Annaud would transition into the role of a transnational director in the 1980s, making multinational co-productions for a global audience like Quest for Fire (1981), The Name of the Rose (1986), and The Bear (1988). The other screenplay from that year, Cause toujours . . . tu m’intéresses! (1979, Édouard Molinaro), again imagines Perrin as a journalist. Working for RTL (Radio Télé Luxembourg), there is a return to the Perrin character being used as a stand-in for Veber, or for the life of a writer at the very least. Like Le jouet, Perrin in Cause toujours . . . tu m’intéresses! is a frustrated journalist longing to do something more substantial, going so far as to pass himself off as a great writer when he meets a stranger. The division between writing as unfulfilling labor and a worthy profession marks much of Veber’s career, but if the screenplay is meant to be a reflexive commentary on his own displeasure with his marginalized status in the film industry, the promotion of the film is not a piece of supporting evidence. Above a mixed media image of the lead\n\n32 t he fi l ms o f f rancis ve be r actors, the names at the top of the poster for Cause toujours . . . tu m’intéresses! appear in bold capital letters: “GIRARDOT MARIELLE MOLINARO VEBER,” crediting the writer and using his name to sell the picture alongside the film’s stars Annie Girardot and Jean-Pierre Marielle as well as the director Édouard Molinaro. As the poster suggests, Veber had become much more than an anonymous screenwriter by the start of the 1980s. The successes of Le grand blond avec une chaussure noire, La cage aux folles, and his directorial debut Le jouet gave him name recognition and situated Veber as a key voice in France’s national cinema. Nowhere is this more evident than in his participation in Sunday Lovers (1980, Les séducteurs), a multinational comedic anthology with four separate stories made alternately in Italy, England, France, and the U.S. The Italian segment, “Armando’s Notebook,” is directed by Dino Risi and co-written by Age and Scarpelli (Agenore Incrocci and Furio Scarpelli), a famous writing duo who had been mainstays in Italy since their first screen credit in 1949. The British story, “An Englishman’s Home,” is directed by Bryan Forbes and written by Leslie Bricusse, a composer and sometimes screenwriter who enjoyed major successes with his song contributions to James Bond films and Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971, Mel Stuart). The American sequence, “Skippy,” is written and directed by Gene Wilder, still enjoying his peak stardom. Veber’s contribution, “The French Method,” again attached to Molinaro as the director, indicates that by the start of the 1980s the duo had become as synonymous with French comedy as Age and Scarpelli were with Italian cinema or Gene Wilder had become with the genre in Hollywood. Building on his growing reputation and having shown the ability to direct with Le jouet, Veber signed what he refers to as a “blank contract” with Gaumont in 1981, allowing him to choose his own projects and serve as both writer and director.2 This newfound freedom, backed by studio financing, could have been an invitation for Veber to dramatically depart from the stylistic and genre categories that had been representative of his work up until that point, but one of the defining characteristics of his career is showing practicality in creative expression. Remarking on the ability of certain American filmmakers to balance artistic ambition with commercial considerations, Veber points out the self-defeating nature of certain French auteurs, creating a national cinema where “there is a total divorce between the ‘success of esteem’ and the cinema of consumption.”3 Although he rejects the notion that he writes for a certain public, Veber also acknowledges the need for his material to connect with an audience. Testing his finished screenplays by reading them to friends, Veber makes a practice out of vetting his material in hopes of predicting audience response.4 He may write in isolation, allowing the narrative to take shape without the specifics of the final filmed product in mind, but his primary goal is to connect with an audience. Still, without the fears or filters of another\n\nm exican h oliday 33 director realizing his screenplays, the opportunity to make personal and political statements must have been apparent to Veber, as were the risks and responsibilities. On-demand projects like Le retour du grand blond and adaptations of preexisting work like La cage aux folles lack the same pressure that he would take on as a full-time writer and director. If Le jouet was a departure from his work as a screenwriter for hire in the 1970s, La chèvre would mark Veber’s assumption of total control over his work in the 1980s.\n\nle f i l m The production history of La chèvre supports Veber’s claims that he writes the majority of his screenplays without considering casting or production specifics. If he had known the difficulties of casting compatible lead actors and completing a film on location in Mexico, La chèvre would never have been written. Conceived as a buddy comedy with a clown blanc and a physically imposing straight man, the humor is built around polarities and repetition.5 Veber’s initial idea for the pairing was to cast Jacques Villeret as the clownish François Perrin and Lino Ventura as the hard-nosed Campana.6 The Italianborn Ventura had moved to France in his youth, came to acting after a successful run as a professional wrestler, and worked his way into leading roles by largely playing tough gangsters and detectives. On top of his well-established screen persona, Ventura had starred in three films written by Veber, playing a\n\nFigure 3.1 Campana (Gérard Depardieu) looks on as Perrin (Pierre Richard) sinks into quicksand in one of La chèvre’s many nods to pulp adventure tropes.\n\n34 t he fi l ms o f f rancis ve be r hit man in L’emmerdeur (1973), a police commissioner in Adieu poulet (1975), and a morally compromised businessman in “The French Method” segment of Sunday Lovers. Ventura agreed to do La chèvre, but for reasons that were never made clear to Veber, he refused to work with Villeret.7 Choosing to find another comic lead rather than lose Ventura, Veber’s reluctant second choice was Pierre Richard.8 On the cusp of shooting, however, Ventura made contract demands that could not be met by Gaumont and he dropped out.9 From a film that he had envisioned as a pairing of Lino Ventura and Jacques Villeret, Veber was left with Pierre Richard and a vacant co-star position right before they were set to leave for Mexico to begin shooting La chèvre. In 1981, if the recollections of the principals are to be believed, Gérard Depardieu seemed to be one of the least likely candidates to replace Lino Ventura in a buddy comedy opposite Pierre Richard. A year removed from winning the César for Best Actor in Le dernier métro (1980, François Truffaut, The Last Metro), Depardieu had become France’s premier dramatic actor and a sort of European corollary to a new generation of film stars in America—a connection that was solidified by his casting opposite Robert De Niro in 1900 (1976, Bernardo Bertolucci). Depardieu had made a few comedies, but his reputation remained closely aligned with serious dramatic roles. His breakthrough performance in Les valseuses (1974, Bertrand Blier, Going Places) comes in a film that is ostensibly a comedy, but of such a dark nature that it is difficult to consider it alongside traditional genre offerings. When Les valseuses was released in the U.S., for example, it was marketed as an art film, playing up critical analyses that read the story of marauding French youth as a commentary on a collective moral decay that followed May ’68.10 Regardless of his reputation or the way his films were sold, Depardieu had made traditional comedies like Inspecteur la Bavure (1980, Claude Zidi, Inspector Blunder), playing a gangster opposite Coluche’s fumbling detective. Produced by Claude Berri just a year before La chèvre, the memories of Veber and Pierre Richard must be taken with a grain of salt when they characterize the casting of Depardieu as a wholly unorthodox and unexpected choice for a comedy. As was the case with Veber’s decision to direct Le jouet, there is a discrepancy between his memory and the claims of Richard about where the idea to cast Depardieu originated. According to Richard, it was his idea to cast Depardieu and Veber came around to the idea almost immediately, convinced by his past work with Bertrand Blier that he could handle comedy.11 Conversely, Veber recalls the suggestion coming from his agent Jean-Louis Livi and having reservations because he thought of Depardieu in the same vein as a young Marlon Brando.12 Hosting a dinner with Depardieu and Richard before making a final decision, Veber recalls that he and producer Alain Poiré saw that the actors had instant chemistry and headed to Mexico shortly thereafter, revised cast in tow. Veber’s comments on the film in his\n\nm exican h oliday 35 memoir are almost exclusively comprised of colorful anecdotes about the misadventures on set in Mexico, ranging from Depardieu’s drunkenness and Richard’s sexual conquests to the difficulty of shooting in the jungle with an inexperienced Mexican crew and a Mormon polygamist stuntman in a gorilla costume.13 The intrigues of shooting aside, the final film is fascinating in its own right. The film opens in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where Marie (Corryne Charbit), the clumsy and unlucky daughter of powerful CEO Alexandre Bens (Michel Robin), is on vacation alone. After being mugged and left unconscious on the street, Marie is kidnapped by a local criminal and goes missing without a trace. Weeks later, with all options exhausted, Bens is pitched a crazy idea by one of his executives: to use a company employee, François Perrin (Pierre Richard) to find her. Perrin, as uncannily prone to disaster as Marie, is hired to follow in her footsteps to accidentally track her down. Assigning tough private detective Campana (Gérard Depardieu) to accompany Perrin and lead the investigation, the pair fly to Puerto Vallarta. To Campana’s chagrin, he must play along and keep Perrin under the false impression of being in charge. In a way, neither are in charge, as their search is guided by happenstance that could pass for divine intervention. Perrin and Campana are at odds once they start working together, largely because the serious private investigator is the victim of the destruction that is left in Perrin’s wake.
