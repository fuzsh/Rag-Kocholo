        "text": "According to all studies, the French share to following values :\n\nRights of man (or Equality)\n\nThe French language\n\nThe French health system\n\nSecularism (more than 90% for each of these four values)\n\nChristian faith (40% only)\n\netc...\n\nIs there a French humor ?\n\nThe least we can say is that Americans rarely understand and appreciate French humor. One of the reasons is that the French love their language and a large part of their humor is based on it, which make it harder for non-French speakers to understand (see an example in the NYT).\n\n\"I believe that nothing separates people more than their sense of humour\" (Theodore Zeldin)\n\nAs quoted by Hill (quoting Gruner), the French value Wit (intellectual, hostile, aggressive, sarcastic, cynical) as opposed to anglo-saxon Humour (emotional, affectionate, gentle, kindly, genial). A quote : \"French wit differs in its essence from Anglo-Saxon humour. It is more dependent on verbal felicity. It ranges from a mere happy accident of similar sound-the pun-to a shrewd criticism of society-the epigram. Always is it dependent on brilliance of language, on concise and sharp-pointed phrases. It thrusts like a rapier, and it is generally cruel. It wounds and mocks : it laughs at its object.\" (Huddleston)\n\nAll the studies show that 1/ the French declare that they are very unhappy with the society (and therefore they demonstrate, march in the streets, go on strike, etc.) and 2/ the same French declare that they are personnaly very happy, in their family, in their life etc. Below a few of these studies :\n\nWho was unhappy in France in 2005 i.e. what are the categories of people who were demonstrating or on strike or both all over the country (according to Le Parisien April 14, 2005) :\n\nHigh school students : huge strikes and demonstrations (200,000) since January against a reform of high school and baccalaureat (loi Fillon)\n\nTeachers : same reason\n\nResearchers : against public budgets being too small\n\nEmergency ward doctors : on strike for more staff\n\nDoctors (general practitioners) against a reform of Social Security which (as they think) favours specialists\n\nDoctors (specialists), God knows why\n\nJudges : for some reason\n\nPrison wardens : for more staff\n\nFarmers against everyting, including the European Agricultural Policy (of which they are the main beneficiaries)\n\nWine growers : for more public subsidies to compensate the diminishing price of wine ; traditionally, they block expressways and trash everything in city centers\n\nFishermen : blocking harbors to protest against the rising cost of petrol\n\nMy favorite French jokes (I assume they are French)\n\nQ. How many Frenchmen does it take to change a light bulb ?\n\nA. Just one, to hold the bulb : the world revolves around him.\n\nBeethoven was so deaf that his whole life long, he thought he was a painter\n\nQ. What's the quickest way to make a profit ?\n\nA. Buy a Frenchman for what he's worth and sell him for what he thinks he's worth.\n\nTwo monks are walking around the monastery cloister reading their breviaries. One of them is smoking a pipe : \" Did the father superior agree you could smoke ? \" queries his colleague. \" I asked him if I could smoke my pipe when I was reading my breviary and he said 'no!' \" . \"That was your mistake \" replies the first \" I asked him if I could read my breviary while I was smoking my pipe \"\n\nMore to come...\n\nThese days, the French do not have very high spirits :\n\nThe main reasons are well-known : the economic situation is very bad, the French regret the loss of influence and power of their country, they have lost confidence in their politicians, they feel that their values and beliefs do not match with the new world, etc. More generally, the huge demonstrations by the Yellow Vests (winter 2018-2019) illustrated a very important factor : the French do not trust anyone ! In fact, they trust nobody except their mayor ! All the polls give the same result : the trust in all institutions (the presidency, the unions, the political parties, etc) rarely exceeds 20% but for the mayor the number is much higher (58% in 2018). More about mayors in France.\n\nthe consumption of tranquilizers is the highest in Europe (x 5 since 1980) : see numbers\n\nnational mood has been constaly decreasing over the past 30 years (see the trend) and a high proportion (13%) declares he/she \"fears becoming homeless\", which is an amazing answer....\n\nyoung French people are much more worried about their future than in other countries (25,6% consider it promising as opposed to 54,01% in the US) : see a comparative poll.\n\nBUT : they are collectively un-happy and individually happy : in a 2006 survey they gave the following (contradictory) answers : \"are the French happy?\" : NO=70%, \"are you happy ?\" YES=80% ! (all the polls give the same result)\n\nThis confirmed by an international survey (source : TNS Opinion, 2010, 32 714 people in 25 countries, in Le Figaro Jan 20, 2011)\n\n- young Frenchmen are (relatively) optimistic for themselves (53%) but not for their country (17%) (for the USA, respectively 81% and 37%) ;\n\n- the numbers are close between Germany and France on one side (the pessimists), USA and UK on the other side (the optimists)\n\n- for young Frenchmen, globalization is more an opportunity than a threat for only 52%, compared to 91% for China (and 66% for Germany) ; more and more (educated) young French people choose to emigrate ;\n\n- globally, all the results show that young Frenchmen consider that they are (personally) relatively happy and (collectively) quite unhappy. Another French paradox ?\n\nWho is happy : me ! (and few other people : read Harriet's books : \"French Toast - Heureuse comme une AmÃ©ricaine en France\" and \"Joie de Vivre : the Secrets of Wining, Dining and Romancing Like the French\"."
