        "text": "French Movies and the Birth of the Cinematographe\n\nOver the decades, France has occupied an important position among the most significant movies to watch. The history of cinema begins precisely in France with French movies, at the end of the nineteenth century, when Louis and Auguste Lumiere invented the Cinematograph. France was at that time the most culturally advanced nation and Paris was the world capital of the arts.\n\nFrom universal exhibitions to the most vital artistic movements of literature and painting all seem to take place in Paris. The Lumière brothers exploit an intuition that had already been in the air for a long time and on which several inventors in various parts of the world were working.\n\nThomas Edison, the directors of Brighton school in the United Kingdom and other artists and inventors had patented their prototype for the projection of cinematographic images. But it was in the turmoil of Paris that the suitable conditions were created for the official presentation of the Cinematografo, the contraption created by the Lumière Brothers.\n\nThe history of cinema, especially at its origins, identifies with the history of French cinema. The first eccentric character of a long line of French artists who chose cinema to invent new languages ​​is George Melies.\n\nGeorge Melies Films\n\nAfter hundreds documentaries made by the Lumière brothers and their cameramen who they sent around the world to film real life George Melies arrives, and cinema takes the first of its countless turns.\n\nMelies, a Parisian magician and magician, was struck by the screening of the Lumière brothers at the Capuchin café. He absolutely wanted a copy of the Cinematografo to work on some of his projects, but the Lumiere refused to sell him one.\n\nDetermined not to give up, Melies had one built on his own. A few years later he created a futuristic soundstage in the garden of his house. It was a theater with completely glass walls and roof that let the sun’s rays filter through at any hour of the day.\n\nDepending on the light that Melies wanted to obtain, he chose the time to film the scenes. It was there that he made most of his films which were subsequently seen all over the world, surreal and dreamlike short films of rare beauty, which were colored by hand frame by frame.\n\nToo bad he did not know how to manage the entrepreneurial side of his business which ceased a few years later. The reason was not only Melies’ financial mismanagement, who instead of renting his films sold them, losing profits. But above all, the immediate birth of industrial cinema starting from 1896.\n\nThe Birth of film Studios\n\nIn 1896 and 1897 the two great French studios were born, Pathe and Gaumont, which immediately monopolize the market by cutting out the artisans and the small ones. independent directors like Melies. The artistic and individual decline of cinema began immediately after its birth.\n\nIn fact, the cinema immediately turned out to be a huge business. Crowds of people all over the world flocked to cinemas in front of the big screen to experience the stories in images. The industrial groups sniffed the business and immediately began to transform the cinema from art into an entertainment industry.\n\nThe first stars of the big screen were created who came from the Theater of the Comédie Francaise. The first were conceived and structured genres of films, according to the highest grossing at the box office. A mechanism that would have been perfected at much higher levels by Hollywood a few decades later.\n\nFrench Movies in the 1920s\n\nIn the 1920s, cinema probably reached its peak in France. It is the decade of the pictorial avant-gardes that mix with pure cinematographic art. While Pathe and Gaumont begin the serial production of standardized film products, there is a ferment in the art world that would not have been seen later.\n\nThis is the avant-garde cinema which in France produces a long series of masterpieces. From the impressionism of Abel Gance, Jean Epstein (with his grandiose masterpiece Cuore Fedele), to the first French surrealist films Come Entr’act by René Claire.\n\nImpressionism and the new avant-gardes: French cinema of the 1930s\n\nIn the 1930s impressionism blends with poetic realism with directors of the caliber of Julien Duvivier, Marcel Carné and Jean Renoir. The free and unclassifiable genius of the films of Jean Vigo, like Atalante and Zero for conduct.\n\nFrench Movies After the War\n\nAt the end of the fifties and sixties, French cinema was reborn after a long slowdown due to the Second World War. It reaches its maximum expression also thanks to a gentleman named André Bazin.\n\nHe was a film journalist who, by the inscrutable will of fate, brings together in his editorial staff of the Cahier du Cinema those who would have been the most important directors in the world in the following years.\n\nAn undertaking that would have been deemed impossible even by those who had the opportunity to travel the entire planet, with an infinite budget, in search of talents of this kind.\n\nInstead this gentleman, a little older than them, found them all in his little and unlucky editorial office: Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Claude Chabrol, Éric Rohmer, Jacques Rivette and Robert Bresson.\n\nAnd from these angry young people, half critics half directors, the new Wave of French cinema was born, the Nouvelle Vague. A movement that would spread all over the world, creating new waves almost everywhere, from the United States of America to Iran.\n\nThe key moment of the story was the Cannes Film Festival in 1959, where the first works bywere presented Francois Truffaut and Alain Resnais: it is Hiroshima Mon Amour and the 400 shots. Films are hugely successful by consecrating the new mode of independent and artistic production. In particular, The 400 Blows by Truffaut will become the symbolic film of the Nouvelle Vague.\n\nThanks to the Nouvelle Vague, a golden season of art cinema world-wide, a new revolution against the monopoly of the entertainment and film-product industry.\n\nFrom the ferment of the Nouvelle Vague came dozens of talented directors, including the extraordinary Jean Cocteau, who tried his hand at cinema with the eyes of a poet.\n\nAt that time France also hosted and produced the works of various directors who emigrated from other countries who found their highest expression in their French movies, such as Luis Bunuel.\n\nFrench Movies after the 1970s\n\nSince the beginning of the 1970s in France, as in the rest of the world, television has crushed the film market, reducing it to less than a tenth of what it was in the 1950s. Even the famous directors of the Nouvelle Vague see the takings of their films collapse.\n\nNot to mention directors like Jean-Luc Godard, real revolutionaries of the art of cinema who have become insignificant from a commercial point of view. The taste of the public becomes more and more homologated due to the bombing of television language: a low-level language.\n\nThe TV series begin to accustom the public to a different relationship with moving images. The visual and pictorial art that had influenced the art cinema, together with the musical rhythm of the montage and poetry, become completely secondary factors.\n\nPeople are fond of more than anything else serial characters, to the story, preferring more and more domestic laziness to the social ritual of cinematic viewing on the big screen. All the great European directors are in crisis, while the American market reinvents itself by producing increasingly commercial films.\n\nIn this period, a director such as Luc Besson made a name for himself. His filmography consists largely of commercial films. We are at a completely different level than a few decades earlier. Even in its country of origin, which has always supported an artistic vision, cinema is transformed into something more homologated.\n\nFrench Movies of the 90s\n\nIn the 90s there seems to be a certain revival of arthouse film that wants to follow in the footsteps of the Nouvelle Vague. Leos Carax, Olivier Assayas, Patrice Leconte, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Mathieu Kassovitz. There are some quality results, but they are isolated episodes. Each director works on his own and there is no comparison, it is the connection of ideas from the 60s.\n\nThen names such as emerge François Ozon, Xavier Giannoli and Michel Gondry. In fact, many of these directors are overrated. Their films are never really true arthouse films but rather hybrid products, halfway between genre and art films.\n\nIn short, the definitive conviction has been created that to please the public one must not experiment too much, and focus on products that work commercially. In this period the financial aspect of cinema predominates over any other vision. If a film does not make a profit, the director is out of the game.\n\nFrench Movies of the 2000s\n\nAt the beginning of the 2000s, things started to change again. Non-linear digital video cameras and editing software become low-cost means of expression for filmmakers who do not have access to finance because they are outside the logic of commercial production.\n\nMany things have changed since Jean Luc Godard’s 16mm experiments in the 1960s, but the spirit of digital cinema is the same: making a film to take the language of cinema to the next level is the filmography of an author. Digital, however, allows a much more radical reduction in production costs than the 16 mm of the Nouvelle Vague.\n\nTo date, the phenomenon of very low-cost films shot digitally is proliferating both in France and around the world. But this new type of film struggles to establish itself in the world of cinema distribution and marketing. The public has been used to it for decades since great studios to watch spectacular movies with great popular stars.\n\nThe marketing mechanisms for the release of a new film have remained exactly the same that Hollywood applied immediately after its birth. A massive advertising campaign to maximize profits in ever faster times.\n\nCinemas are exclusive distribution shops of mainstream cinema, sometimes of mainstream movies that are disguised as arthouse films, to cover even the small niche of audiences that are still looking for art films.\n\nIndependent cinema, on the other hand, thinks in a completely opposite way: it thinks in terms of decades. The purpose of the art film is to enhance itself more and more over time. Do not forfeit the maximum possible profits in the shortest possible time, and then be forgotten.\n\nFrench Films to Watch: Masterpieces of Cinema History\n\nMany French directors and films have become milestones in the history of cinema. French cinema is one of the cinemas that has experimented with the most innovative languages ​​and has given life to the most fascinating avant-gardes.
