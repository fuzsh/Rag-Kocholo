A perfectionist, he almost single-handedly changed the image of Sauvignon Blancs from Pouilly-FumÃ© and Sancerre in France's Loire Valley.\n\nRather than shrill, feisty whites tasting of grass, green beans, gooseberry or pipi de chat (the somehow more polite French term for cat's pee), Dagueneau's Sauvignons were statuesque, beautifully balanced wines with flavors reminiscent of citrus zests, apricot, fig, passion fruit and minerals. They cost as much as a Grand Cru from Burgundy's Cote d'Or, and consumers did not hesitate to pay: a Dagueneau wine was a work of art.\n\nHis funeral, which drew wine people from all over France, was held on a sunny afternoon one day before the start of the 2008 Pouilly-FumÃ© harvest. And many in attendance wondered whether his son, Louis-Benjamin, then 25, would be able to cope with this challenge, which even in calmer circumstances would have been daunting. The Dagueneau domaine consists of 27 acres of vines in Pouilly-FumÃ©, a couple of rows of vertiginously steep vines on the famous cru Les Monts Damnes in Sancerre, and a small vineyard in Jurancon. Merely harvesting and fermenting all those grapes would be an accomplishment; producing wines on a par with those of his father seemed beyond the realm of possibility.\n\nWe need not have worried. Louis-Benjamin has now completed two vintages on his own, and his 2008 and 2009 vintages are nothing less than splendid, fully the equal of any wine made by his father. The 2008 \"Pur Sang\" is the apotheosis of the Loire. Voluptuous yet finely etched, it wraps its flavors of crystallized grapefruit and lemon zests around the tongue. Grandiose. A vin de meditation. David Schildknecht in the Wine Advocate sums it up with: \"the 2009 collection â¦ promises to be the best group of Sauvignons rendered in that year.â¦ The 2008s are also superb.\"\n\nStill. It must have been agonizing, surreal?\n\n\"No, it was very easy. Everyone gave the best of themselves,\" Dagueneau says, sitting in the small house in front of the wine cellar that the Dagueneaus call La Maison d'Henri. It has an office downstairs and a couple of bedrooms on the second floor.\n\nI had lived in the Maison d'Henri for a couple of months in 1990 while researching a book on the Loire. At the time, Louis-Benjamin was a droll and dreamy little boy of 7. Now he's tall, muscular and bearded, and every bit as opinionated as his father.\n\nIn fact, it seems if I close my eyes, it sounds like Didier and not Louis-Benjamin who is talking. And, as articulate as his father was, Louis-Benjamin brings Didier and his convictions even more clearly into focus.\n\nSince he worked side by side with his father from 2004 on, he seems to take his success as a matter of course. \"I started working in the vineyards and tasting wines when I was 10,\" Dagueneau says. \"When Didier opened a great bottle â a Jayer, say, or an '89 Chinon Dioterie, or a Mas Jullien â we tasted and I listened to what he said and tried to find what he described in the glass.\n\n\"When I was about 14 or 15, I really started tasting Sauvignon Blanc. Our own wines. We'd taste those made from grapes that had been de-stemmed and from grapes that hadn't been de-stemmed, for example, wines that were filtered or not filtered, sulfured or not sulfured; wines aged in different types of barrels or barrels with different levels of toasting. We'd taste the lees, the grapes, oxidized wines.\"\n\nDagueneau went to several professional schools, earning a degree in viticulture and oenology. Before returning to the family property in 2004, he apprenticed with vintners as exigent as his father, spending at least a year with Francois Chidaine in Montlouis and Vouvray in the Loire and another year with Olivier Jullien at Mas Jullien in the Languedoc. He remains close to both.\n\n\"But I really learned everything from Didier,\" he says. \"In essence, a wine must reflect its terroir and its vintage. No. 1: Wine is made in the vineyard. Everybody says that, but no one does it. You need to be rigorous and to have good sense. Second: Respect for nature. We converted to organic farming back in the 1990s. We tried everything in the vineyards and the cellar. We kept what we liked, and we ignored the rest.\"\n\nSo-called natural wines have become an important trend â the word \"natural\" subject to many interpretations but often embracing some variation on the noninterventionist, less-is-more philosophy: no weed killers or commercial fertilizer in the vineyard, for example, and, when it comes to winemaking, no added anything, starting with sulfur, sugar and yeast, and no manipulations like controlling the temperature of fermentation, or fining or filtering the wine before bottling.\n\nLouis-Benjamin, like his father, thumbs his nose at the natural-wine dogma: \"We're noninterventionist, but it's not nature that prunes the vines or that presses the grapes,\" he says, and spells out some of the techniques they adopted and those they discarded.\n\n\"Working the soil â by plowing, sometimes with a horse â is something we kept. We don't use weed killers and we kept some of the infusions [essentially homeopathic vine treatments], others not. And we don't work with laboratory analysis. We decide the date of harvest by tasting the grapes. We decide if we've decanted the wine sufficiently by looking at the juice, and so forth. We rejected working without sulfur or without added yeasts. You can't make dry wines without yeast. There'll always be some residual sugar or, if the fermentation goes too slowly for lack of yeast, there may be some off-flavors like volatile acidity. We do everything to keep the fermentation temperature cool. We don't fine, but we do filter the wines.\"\n\n\"Another thing Didier taught me,\" Dagueneau says, obviously warming to the subject and sounding more and more like his father with every sentence, \"wine has a certain potential at harvest. Every intervention you make, if it's not at exactly the right moment, you lose something. You have to make the right decision at the right time in order to keep what nature has given.\"\n\nNow, in mid-October, Dagueneau is delighted with what nature has given.\n\nFirst, he became a father (of a son named Lou) on Sept. 20, a week before harvest began. And then he succeeded in bringing all his fruit in before the rains began at the beginning of October and is jubilant about the quality â comparing it to 2002, one of his favorite vintages.\n\nThinking back on the 2008 harvest, Louis-Benjamin reflected, \"I had a difficult moment of feeling that I was living Didier's life, that I'd stolen something. Then I realized that I was lucky. For me the hardest thing has been that my father didn't live to taste my first vintage. This is a regret that I'll always carry with me.\"\n\nJacqueline Friedrich is author of \"A Wine and Food Guide to the Loire.\"\n\nfood@​latimes.com\n\nCopyright Â© 2010, Los Angeles Times\n\n* The Wall Street Journal\n\n* SEPTEMBER 3, 2010\n\nSoul Food Ã la FranÃ§aise\n\nSavoring fouÃ©e, the puffy, delicacy-stuffed bread, is a mouthwatering trip into France's distant past\n\nBy JACQUELINE FRIEDRICH\n\n'Eat with your fingers. It's more practical.\"\n\nSay what?\n\nThe owner of a French restaurant advising French clients to eat with their fingers? Etiquette is so hard-wired into the French brain that its well-bred citizens attack chicken wings with bold knife and fork. We are, however, in La Grange Ã DÃ®me, a fouÃ©e restaurant in the French town of Montreuil-Bellay,, a breed of eatery known by few travelers. And fouÃ©e-restaurant fare practically defies cutlery.\n\nFouÃ©e is an ancient bread. History tells us that it was born as a way for bakers to test the heat of their wood ovens: they'd rip off a piece of dough, roll it out and stick it in the oven. Minutes later, out comes a puffed-up bubble of hot crust filled with air. Its closest relative may be the pita. But your standard pita is burlap to the fouÃ©e's gossamer.\n\nNature abhors a vacuum and so does a fouÃ©e. You prick it open and fill it with various stuffings, most of them dictated by local tradition, to wit: rillettes (unctuous pork spread called \"brown marmalade\" by novelist HonorÃ© de Balzac), mogettes (the VendÃ©e's celebrated dried white beans), Loire goat cheese and lightly salted butter.\n\nHere you have the mainstays of the honest-to-God fouÃ©e restaurant, a style of eatery pretty much limited to the Saumurois in the western stretch of the Loire Valley. The set menus vary little from one place to another and are usually fleshed out with mushrooms, a meat preparation, salad, dessert and serviceable regional wine.\n\nKilljoys might dismiss these as \"theme\" restaurants, but there's nothing Red Lobsterish about La Grange Ã DÃ®me or the best of its cousins. Their foodstuffs are based on ancient foodwaysâmany known to Rabelaisâand are resolutely home-grown.\n\nYour meal at La Grange Ã DÃ®me, for example, starts with a glass of sweet Chenin Blanc from the Coteaux du Layon to accompany a galipette, a large (locally cultivated) mushroom, stuffed and baked to melting crunchiness in the hearth.\n\nNext the fouÃ©es are brought from the hearth to be filled with rillettes, butter or, better yet, both. And along comes a lightly chilled Anjou rouge, in this case, a forthright Cabernet Franc.\n\nThe main course, confit de canard and mogettes, cooks in the hearth in a big casserole to lip-smacking crustiness. I stuffed everything into the fouÃ©es which I had already smothered with butter. Disgustingly delicious. Then came salad and tangy goat cheese, followed by the first strawberries of the season and topped with the best whipped cream I have ever eaten.\n\nLa Grange Ã DÃ®me, a 15th-century structure, was once the storage place for \"gifts\" (taxes, really) that commoners were obliged to give local lords. The heavy wood beams, the magnificent chestnut eaves all date from the building's origins. From time to time musicians perform medieval music, and the staff, at all times, wears period dress.\n\nThis, at first, made me fear terminal corniness. What the staff was actually wearing, howeverâlong skirts, embroidered vests and smocksâwas no different from what they wear during the numerous local fairs and reunions of wine brotherhoods. This is Plantagenet country. There is always a reason to don medieval garb and cue the local Jordi Savalls.\n\nWhat's more, it fits the setting. Montreuil-Bellay, an enchanting town on the river Thouet with an 11th-century chÃ¢teau, invites strollingâaround the fortress, the narrow streets, the lush river banks. And most of the other fouÃ©e restaurants are located in similarly captivating settings such as troglodyte cavesâenormous, hydra-headed labyrinths created when the stone was quarried for building the local chÃ¢teaux, churches and homes. Many now serve as winemaking or mushroom-cultivating cellars.\n\nAbout 13 miles west of Montreuil-Bellay you'll find some of the Loire's most remarkable troglodytes, among them DÃ©nezÃ©-sous-DouÃ©, its walls completely covered with enigmatic 16th- and 17th-century sculptures, and La Rochemenier, a 20-room troglodyte village, with farms and a chapel, of more than two acres. La Genevraie is, blessedly, part of this ensemble.\n\nLa Genevraie's setting is enchanting: A path curves down to the entry, bordered with flowering rosebushes. The main room is surely as close as a troglodyte cave can ever get to evoking a proper English tea parlorâwith its candles and vases filled with fresh roses, its window sills lined with antique dolls and its walls hung with old kitchen utensils.\n\nChopped mushrooms, cooked with carrots and seasonings, come stuffed into fouÃ©es. Then rillettes followed by rillauds, large cubes of pork which have been salted and simmered in water until fork-tender. These have been sliced into glistening little strips and piled onto superb mogettes. There is a break before cheese and dessert (excellent pear-and-chocolate tart) to tour the caves, see the oven and chat with the owner-baker.\n\nThe authenticity and the quality of the products served at both La Grange Ã DÃ®me and La Genevraie have been guaranteed by the Parc Naturel RÃ©gional Loire-Anjou-Touraine, which supervises activities associated with the Loire since it has been recognized as Unesco's largest World Heritage site. Two other restaurants are also recommended: Le Cave aux Moines, where fouÃ©es are served with mushrooms grown on the spot, and Le Moulin de Sarre, a working flour mill with a fouÃ©e restaurant adjunct.\n\nMany of the ever-increasing number of fouÃ©e restaurants don't make the grade. Le Clos des Roches, deep in the fields of Grezille, however, is every bit as good as the best.\n\nYou might want to bring a flashlight when dining here. From the parking area you must descend a rocky path to a dirt road, past a private home, before getting to the troglodyte that houses the restaurant. The fouÃ©es here are oblong rather than round and might win the gold medal for quality. The young server keeps them coming and lights a candle under a serving dish for the mogettesâwhich follow the rillettes and butter, accompanied by slabs of smoky VendÃ©e ham cooked in the wood oven. There's salad, excellent goat cheese from north of Angers and, for dessert, Tarte Tatin.\n\nEach of these restaurants is cavernous. They accept tour buses. Fear not. You're likely to be surrounded by locals out for a down-home feast.\n\nWHERE TO STAY\n\nChÃ¢teau de VerriÃ¨res (above)\n\nA 10-room gem in the center of Saumur, behind the National Riding Academy (Cadre Noir), with a dreamy park and a pool.

Most significant, PÃ©tillant Originel must be absolutely natural, a product of the grapes harvested and no more. It is illegal to add either sugar or yeast at any stage of the wine's production, although both are commonly used in Champagne.\n\nHyper-naturalists view these additions â not to mention the use of other additives such as enzymes and bentonite â as nothing more than chemistry, all of which undermines the purity of the wine.\n\nWhile eschewing additives may be a matter of principle for all Pet'Nat producers, for Montlouis vintners like Delecheneau and Jousset, it is also a matter\n\nof law, not to mention painstaking, meticulous work in vineyard and cellar, as\n\nJousset is about to demonstrate.\n\nA rangy 35-year-old with the square-jawed good looks of a latter-day Marlboro Man, Jousset explains that the barrel is filled with new, unfinished wine. The wine stopped fermenting in January while it still had 14 grams of residual sugar and has been kept in a refrigerated room since then.\n\nBehind him, a small assembly line of vintners suctions the wine from the barrel, through the spigots of the bottling machine and into bottles that are then capped like Coca-Cola. Jousset continues: Once warmer weather arrives, that residual sugar and any remaining natural yeasts will restart the fermentation and, in the process, produce the bubbles that make the wine sparkle.\n\n\"It dawned on me,\" recalled winemaker Delecheneau, 31, of Domaine de la Grange Tiphaine, \"I don't add sugar or yeast to my still wines, so why do I add them to my PÃ©tillant? This was in 2005. That's when a group of us started talking about PÃ©tillant Originel, although we called it 'Pet'Nat' at the time.\"\n\nHonest approach\n\nWhatever you call them, the wines are made, for the most part, by resolutely organic, doggedly noninterventionist vintners, among them Christian Chaussard, who, Delecheneau observes, inspired him and a lot of other young winemakers.\n\nWay back in the 1990s, when Chaussard was located in Vouvray â across the Loire River from Montlouis â he made a fizzy, not-quite-pÃ©tillant simply by letting his Vouvray re-ferment spontaneously in springtime.\n\nThose were the very early days of the hyper-naturalist, noninterventionist winemaking movement in France â when outliers like the Puzelat brothers (Clos du Tue-Boeuf) and Claude Courtois (Cailloux du Paradis) in Touraine and J.J. Brun in Beaujolais (Domaine des Terres DorÃ©es) began opting for organic or biodynamic farming and forswearing industrial yeasts, enzymes, sulfur, added sugar, added tannins â you name it â as well as just about any technique counseled by modern enologists.\n\nSince that time, hyper-natural winemaking has become a movement, spreading the gospel of \"natural wines\" throughout France and well beyond.\n\nAnd the Pet'Nat movement is spreading throughout France as well. Now relocated an hour north in the Coteaux du Loir appellation, Chaussard remains true to the cause, making a variety of quirky hyper-natural wines including Pet'Nats such as \"You Are So Happy,\" a herbaceous blend of Chenin and Sauvignon Blanc, and \"You Are So Bubbly,\" a foamy weave of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Grenache and Cinsault.\n\nOther popular producers such as Pierre and Catherine Breton in Bourgueil, Thierry Puzelat in Touraine, and Dominique Derain in Burgundy are among the growing number of eco-serious vintners adding some Pet'Nat fizz to their line of still wines.\n\nMost of these Pet'Nats from outside Montlouis are sweet â ranging from slightly off-dry to as sweet as Dr Pepper â and many hark back to old-fashioned styles of winemaking (appropriately called mÃ©thode ancestrale and mÃ©thode rurale) in the regions of Limoux and Gaillac.\n\nAn important subgroup is deep pink, in the style of Cerdon, a sparkling wine in the Savoie's Bugey appellation. Emile Heredia from the Domaine de Montrieux outside Vendome, for example, makes a Cerdon-like Pet'Nat called Boisson Rouge from old Gamay vines. Simon Hawkins of Domaine de Fontenay in the CÃ´te Roannaise makes a sudsy Gamay with the sweet-tart flavors of cranberry relish.\n\nMontlouis PÃ©tillant Originel is totally dry, however. And it differs from Pet'Nats in another significant way: Most, if not all Pet'Nats, are vins de table or vins de France â in other words, not part of any official wine group, with all the anarchy and qualitative differences that implies, from the urbane to the outlandish. Montlouis PÃ©tillant Originel is governed by law and aims to be reliably urbane.\n\nQuality charter\n\nJousset and Delecheneau, along with Xavier Weisskopf (Domaine des Rocher des Violettes) and Domaine Alex-Mathur wanted to make a PÃ©tillant that was not only ultra-pure but also a full-fledged wine â ripe, vinous, consistent in quality and fine enough to serve in Michelin-starred restaurants, but reasonably priced. (Most sell in France for $10 to $15.)\n\nTo this end, they drew up a quality charter with exigent requirements. In addition to abolishing the addition of yeast and sugar, the charter mandates low yields, greater ripeness of the grapes than is anticipated for most sparkling wines, as well as aging for a minimum of nine months before being disgorged.\n\n\"It's very difficult and very risky,\" Delecheneau says. \"The danger is that the wine might stop fermenting.\"\n\nLess consequential risks include off-flavors resembling beer or cider, which is why Jacky Blot of Domaine de la Taille aux Loups decided to add just a bit of yeast for the prise de mousse when making his very successful \"Triple Zero,\" a Montlouis PÃ©tillant.\n\nAccording to Delecheneau, his PÃ©tillant Originel is catching on nicely in the U.S. and the wines are beginning to surface in up-to-the-minute wine bars and shops in Paris like La Quincave and Cru et DÃ©couvertes.\n\nTo understand the simple yet huge pleasures that are PÃ©tillant Originel, try Xavier Weisskopf's 2006. Disgorged in 2008, it's rich and appetizing, lightly salty, with subtle, intriguing flavors of apple and stone. Downright gourmand. Add grace notes of ginger and you've got the 2007 version.\n\nWeisskopf sells almost his entire production of PÃ©tillant Originel to Denmark. \"They're crazy for natural wines,\" he explains.\n\nIt is also available in Southern California at Wine Expo and Hi-Times Wine Cellars. Indeed, availability of any Pet'Nats is spotty â though that is supposed to improve by early summer âit's a new product made in startlingly small quantities.\n\nRisks combined with the very newness of the wine explain why only four Montlouisiens currently produce it and why there is so little of it â roughly 20,000 to 25,000 bottles a year.\n\nBut as Delecheneau and Jousset point out, the wine has no track record. Other vintners may be waiting to see how it catches on; others may be experimenting until they get it right.\n\nThierry Bruneau, general manager and wine buyer for L'Ebauchoir, which specializes in hyper-natural wines, was impressed by what he tasted and intends to add a PÃ©tillant Originel to his list soon, most likely Jousset's 2008 \"Bubulle\" or his favorite, Delecheneau's 2008 \"Nouveau Nez.\"\n\n\"It was creamy, dry and mineral. I liked it a whole lot. They're a hard sell right now because people don't know them, but once they try them they really like them and order them again.\"\n\nfood@​latimes.com\n\nCopyright Â© 2010, The Los Angeles Times\n\n* T h e W a l l S t r e e t J o u r n a l\n\n* F O O D & D R I N K\n\n* A P R I L 2 , 2 0 1 0\n\nT h e F i r s t T a s t e o f 2 0 0 9\n\nS a m p l i n g a n e w B o r d e a u x v i n t a g e\n\n(I have no idea why the formatting is so weird!)\n\nB y J A C Q U E L I N E F R I E D R I C H\n\nF r o n s a c , F r a n c e\n\n[ w i n e ] B o n A p p e t i t /​ A l a m y\n\nA w i n e - b a r r e l s t o r e h o u s e a t C h â t e a u P o n t e t - C a n e t i n P a u i l l a c , F r a n c e .\n\nO n a c o l d , g r a y P a l m S u n d a y , a s v i l l a g e r s w a l k e d t o c h u r c h b e a r i n g b o u g h s o f b o x w o o d a n d l a u r e l , w i n e w r i t e r s f r o m P a r i s , N e w Y o r k , L o n d o n , S e o u l , A m s t e r d a m a n d b e y o n d , b e a r i n g l a p t o p s , i P h o n e s a n d s p i r a l n o t e b o o k s , d e s c e n d e d o n t h e C h â t e a u d e C a r l e s .\n\nT h e c h â t e a u l i e s o u t s i d e t h e v i l l a g e o f S a i l l a n s , n o r t h e a s t o f t h e c i t y o f B o r d e a u x , a n d o v e r l o o k s a n u n d u l a t i n g s w a t h o f v i n e y a r d s w i t h i n F r o n s a c , o n e o f m o r e t h a n 2 0 B o r d e a u x a p p e l l a t i o n s o n t h e r i g h t b a n k o f t h e G i r o n d e E s t u a r y .

A small appellation - for whites, rosÃ©s but mostly reds - it lies in southwest France, halfway between the cities of Agen, of prune fame, and Bordeaux, that hulking reminder that not all vineyards are created equal. Unless, of course, you find someone as gifted as Ãlian Da Ros to level the playing field.\n\nWhen 39-year-old Da Ros took charge of his father's 7.5 hectares of vines in the Marmandais he changed everything. Gradually increasing his holdings to 21 hectares, or just over 50 acres, he converted to biodynamics, a form of organic viticulture, bottled his own wine rather than deliver it to a local cooperative, and now sells to ambitious wine bars as well as to a Who's Who of Michelin-starred restaurants, from El Bulli in Spain to Roellinger in Cancale to the Auberge de l'Ill in Illerhausen.\n\nHappily, France has an ever-increasing number of vintners in the Da Ros mold- passionate artistes-vignerons who are determined to make great wine - no matter where their vineyards are. Some, like Da Ros, inherited land; others, with no land and modest budgets, looked for vines in the Valley of the \"Uns\" - unknown, undervalued, underdeveloped and underestimated.\n\nFor HervÃ© Leferrer (Domaine du Grand CrÃ¨s) and HervÃ© Bizeul (Domaine du Clos des FÃ©es), this meant all-but-abandoned hillsides in the Languedoc and Roussillon; for Alain and Isabelle Hasard (Domaine des Champs de l'Abbaye); for Maria Cuny (Domaine Marie Cuny, and for Jean-Marie Guffens (Guffens-Heynen) supposedly minor areas of Burgundy.\n\nLike Da Ros, each has had to push winemaking boundaries to fully realize - and even expand - the presumed potential of the appellation. Whatever nature did or didn't give them, they more than make up for with nurture. Most practice some sort of organic viticulture, pampering their vines like a Sunday gardener pinching back basil. Yields are extremely low, harvest is by hand, and the wines are bottled with little or no filtration. Each has sifted through years of experience to settle on the best winemaking methods they've learned along the way.\n\nDa Ros, for instance, studied in Montpellier, MÃ¢con and Strasbourg, then became the right-hand man to Olivier Humbrecht, the fine Alsatian vintner who bottles a wide range of wines terroir by terroir. That's what inspired Da Ros to make four different reds. A blend of varying percentages of cabernets sauvignon and franc, merlot, malbec (or cot), syrah and the local abouriou, each cuvÃ©e comes from a distinct terroir. The single vineyard Clos Bacquey is the top of the line. The 2004 is as scrumptious as it is soignÃ©, a silken weave of succulent black cherry, fleshy Agen prunes, gentle new oak and cinnamon. You'll be both amused and amazed.\n\nThe Domaine de la RomanÃ©e-Conti was HervÃ© Leferrer's muse. When he left his post as the domaine's director he scoured southern France before settling on five hectares in the appellation of CorbiÃ¨res in the Languedoc, at a price a tenth of anything he could have found in Burgundy. This was in 1989. Today, he has 19 hectares and makes Languedoc wines with Burgundian elegance, two whites and two reds, each as vibrant and streamlined as a Bach violin concerto. The graceful 2006 Blanc du Grand CrÃ¨s, a fragrant blend of roussanne and viognier, fresh as a mountain stream, offers delicate flavors of peach and passion fruit. The 2004 CuvÃ©e Majeure du Grand CrÃ¨s, Leferrer's top red, is chiefly syrah. Don't look for a blockbuster. This wine is all about harmony and subtlety.\n\nIf the wines from Domaine du Grand CrÃ¨s recall chamber music, those from Domaine du Clos des FÃ©es are downright symphonic. HervÃ© Bizeul, the owner, was quite the Parisian wine maven from the 1980s through the mid-'90s: he had won the Best Young Sommelier Award, owned a wine bar and was a wine journalist. While visiting the Roussillon, he happened on a vineyard in the Agly Valley, where he was convinced he could make superb wine. The vines were for sale. Bizeul bought them, extended his holdings to 19 hectares, and the rest is history, including the fact that his top cuvÃ©e, Petite SibÃ©rie, at 200 euros a bottle, nearly $300, is the most expensive wine in the region. Made from old grenache vines, it exudes aromas and flavors of very ripe black cherries, blackberries, white ash, and oak accents. Almost a meal in itself, it you want to sit with friends, sip it, talk about it and take another sip.\n\nLess voluptuous (and less expensive) but equally delicious is the cuvÃ©e Clos des FÃ©es, a velvet cushion of syrah, grenache, mourvÃ¨dre and carignan. It cries out for a perfectly roasted duck accompanied by potatoes mashed with the best sweet butter you can find. His 2006 Vieilles Vignes Grenache is a taut, strong white, with floral, verbena and tangerine zest accents. There are other bottlings, too, as well as Walden, Bizeul's optimistically named foray into the negociant business. A yummy, user-friendly red, it's well worth the 7 euros you'd pay for it.\n\nThere's something New World-ish about the Agly Valley. But Burgundy? Didn't those wine-savvy monks demarcate everything worth cultivating centuries ago? Apparently not. It's thrilling to find lip-smacking wines coming from unsung areas like the Couchois, where Alain and Isabelle Hasard created Domaine des Champs de l'Abbaye in 1997. Former psychologists, their love for wine landed them on the selling floors of the big wine merchant Nicolas. Last stop, Beaune, where they decided to make their own Burgundian pinot noir. In 1997 they bought vines in land designated as lowly passe-tout-grain, from which they turned out reds replete with joie de vivre. Today, they have 6.5 hectares, having sold off most of the passe-tout-grain land to trade up to a half hectare in Rully and 1.5 hectares of Mercurey. Most of their land, however, is still in the Bourgogne-CÃ´tes du Couchois appellation. Vinified by terroir, there are three pinot noir cuvÃ©es, each one an overachiever: The statuesque Les Vignes Martin, the structured and very delectable Les Rompeys, and the exotically perfumed Le Clos, which could be taken for a Volnay.\n\nThis Burgundy lover can't wait to taste the Hasards' first vintage of Mercurey, the 2006, which is still in barrel. As it happens, the Chalonnais and MÃ¢connais zones south of the CÃ´te d'Or, which include both Rully and Mercurey, are humming with activity, thanks to fanatical winemakers like the Hasards.\n\nJean-Marie Guffens, a Belgian who worked in Burgundy as a winebroker, was surely one of the pioneers. A force of nature, Guffens bought two hectares of MÃ¢con in 1980. Meursault would have cost ten times as much. Today, in addition to a negociant business, Verget, that spans Burgundy, Guffens, with his wife, Maine Heynen, owns 5.3 hectares, split between MÃ¢con and Pouilly-FuissÃ©. In the popular imagination Pouilly-FuissÃ© and MÃ¢con seem only too familiar; the first, an also-ran; the latter, an underachiever from which we never expected very much anyway. But the perfectionist Guffens turns out breathtaking whites that rival the Montrachets. His Pouilly-FuissÃ© La Roche and MÃ¢con Pierreclos are textured, splendid wines, works of art.\n\nChablis comes to mind when you taste Maria Cuny's 2006 Bourgogne-VÃ©zelay. It's chardonnay but so distinctive you forget about fruit in favor of terroir. It's a racy, ethereal wine with a stinging freshness and a rush of mineral and herbal tea flavors. Working as a shepherdess for SociÃ©tÃ© Roquefort, Maria was sent to apprentice with a shepherd named Yves Cuny. They married, and six children later the couple decided to return to his childhood home near VÃ©zelay. In 2000 they bought a small vineyard in the shadow of the town's basilica, part of the Unesco World Heritage site. Decimated by phylloxera, VÃ©zelay's slopes were abandoned for roughly a century until a local group replanted them. This year marks the 10th anniversary of AOC Bourgogne-VÃ©zelay status for chardonnay-based whites. Maria Cuny's wines prove that VÃ©zelay is a Burgundian cru to be reckoned with.\n\nJacqueline Friedrich is the author \"The Wines of France: The Essential Guide for Savvy Shoppers.\"\n\nTen wines to taste at Paris wine fair (This appeared as a sidebar to the above article. Ten stands to visit at the Salon.\n\nFriday, November 16, 2007\n\nThe Salon des Vignerons IndÃ©pendants, the largest wine fair of its kind, opens on Thursday in Paris, at Paris Expo, Porte de Versailles. The five-day event offers 1,000 wineries and attracts 160,000 visitors. Feeling bewildered already? We've picked 10 excellent winemakers from four regions. Row and stand numbers are in parentheses:\n\nChampagne: Grower Champagne is often cheaper and tastier than Champagnes from the big houses. Agrapart (S-14): Try the Grand Cru Blanc de Blancs, particularly the feisty, barrel-fermented CuvÃ©e l'Avizoise. Moncuit (H-9): Stellar grands crus from Le Mesnil, particularly vintage bottlings: the racy CuvÃ©e Pierre Moncuit-Delos RÃ©serve, and Hugues de Coulmet, a lightly sweet Champagne, perfect for dessert.\n\nBurgundy:Michel Magnien: ( J-33) CÃ´tes-de-Nuits at its most succulent: Try the Morey-St.-Denis Chaffots Premier Cru; the Morey-St.-Denis Millandes, and the Gevrey-Chambertin SeuvrÃ©es Vieilles Vignes. Machard de Gramont (C-64): Delectable Nuits-St.-George, including Les Hauts Poirets and Les Haut Pruliers. Goisot (E-7): Excellent, streamlined whites and reds from the outskirts of Chablis. Don't miss the old vines chardonnay and the Sauvignon de St. Bris.\n\nRhÃ´ne: Saladin (H-34): Cool ArdÃ¨che mountain RhÃ´nes by Elisabeth and Marie-Laurence Saladin. Chaveyron 1422 is the top of the line. Brusset (M-22): Ambitious Cairanne, Gigondas and simple CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne. Domaine Rabasse-Charavin (L-62): Don't miss Corinne Couturier's Cairanne CuvÃ©e d'Estevenas in both red and white. ChÃ¢teaux La Gardine/​St. Roch: (R-57): Delicious ChÃ¢teauneuf-du-Pape, CuvÃ©e des GÃ©nÃ©rations and the fine Lirac CuvÃ©e Confidentielle.\n\nBordeaux: If you have to choose just one, make it ChÃ¢teau Clauzet: (Q-41): Try the graceful, pedigreed St. EstÃ¨phe.\n\nOLIVIER ROELLINGER: MAISON DE BRICOURT Yes, Chef magazine, Winter 2008. I've used the author's cut as the editors sent me a .pdf file of the entire magazine and I don't have the wherewithal to separate out my piece.\n\nThe one with the spices. Mention the name Olivier Roellinger to any foodie and thatâs the reflex response. Like Marc Veyrat and his hat; like Michel Bras and Veyrat (again) with their wild herbs just gathered from the surrounding mountainsides; like Joel Robuchon and his mashed potatoes. The finely tuned use of spices seems to be a signature chez Roellinger. He uses over a hundred of them.\n\nMention spices to the chef, however, and his automatic reply, emphatically stated, is âItâs not fusion! Itâs the expression of this environment. Iâm inspired by soul of St. Malo and its place in history â of explorers, adventurers, and spice traders. By the aura and the force of Mont St. Michel. I subscribe totally to this spirit of openness to the world beyond our horizons.â\n\nOne quickly understands that to ask Olivier Roellinger what cooking means to him is, in a very real sense, to ask him the meaning of life.\n\nThe following history has â rightly â become part of the Roellinger legend. Now 53, at the age of 21 the future chef was nearly assassinated by five local thugs in what he describes as a Clockwork Orange-type attack. After months in the hospital, he spent two years at home, in a wheel chair, during which time he passed hours reflecting on mortality, on the meaning of life, and more practically, on his decision to study math and chemistry.\n\nâThey seemed insipid and pointless,â he recalls, â I wanted to do something to celebrate the joy of being alive.â\n\nAt about this time, his mother â having divorced Roellingerâs father years earlier â was having difficulty maintaining the family home and thought sheâd have to sell it. Roellinger was adamantly against this plan. He had been born in this house and wanted, at all costs, to keep it and make it live. He came up with mighty good scheme.\n\nAs it happened, while he was at home recovering, his pals from school came to visit everyday. To hear him tell it, the house was always buzzing with activity. As the friends tended to linger, Mme Roellinger felt they needed sustenance. She cooked big family-style meals. They ate. And thus was born the idea that saved the house: he, his mother, his wife Jane, and a friend Andre who still works with him, turned the house into a table dâhote. That was in 1982. In 1983 the influential guide Gault-Millau rewarded this improvised restaurant with a rating of 15/​20.Within two years Roellingerâs house had become a full-fledged restaurant, winning its first Michelin star in 1984; its second, in â88; and its 3rd in 2006.\n\nThe Maison de Bricourt itself is a handsome bourgeois home which dates from 1760. It is set back from the port of Cancale on a hill high above the bay of Mont St. Michel. As Roellinger points out, the house once belonged to Heurtaut de Bricourt, a shipowner from the Compagnie des Indes, the legendary firm that traveled the world in search of spices, silk, and exotic woods.\n\nâWhatâs unusual,â Roellinger points out,â is that there are something like 47 restaurants in Cancale and 46 of them are on the port. Iâm the only one in upper Cancale. But people from the region understood what I was trying to do and they supported me.â\n\nNow, with his various enterprises â among them, a cooking school (La Cuisine Corsaire), with baker Yannick Gautier, a bakery and tea salon called Grain de Vanille, and a spice shop called Entrepot dâEpices Roellinger â the chef seems to be colonizing upper Cancale. (Roellinger also owns the Chateau de Bricourt-Richeux, a small hotel/​restaurant in a 1920s villa set in a vast park outside of town on a cliff overlooking the bay of Mont St. Michel.)\n\nOne can âreadâ some of the history of the Maison de Bricourt house in its salon â with its unusually tiled fireplace and its vitrines filled with Breton and oriental faience. The three small dining salons look out on a pond populated by fat, satisfied-looking ducks, surrounded by a screen of bonsai and rhododendron. The rooms themselves have a studied spareness. There are few things and they are beautiful â handsome stained wood floors, for example, and elegant Limoges porcelain.\n\nThis aesthetic has carried over to Roellingerâs food such as an amuse-bouche of winkles in a subtly devastating horseradish cream sauce served on a bed of seasalt alongside a small slab of seabass delicately scented with green curry, and shrimp whose shrimp-iness is intensified by being served in their own juices.\n\nThis was the overture to Roellingerâs 170 euro âChefâs Desireâ menu which, on the night in question, comprised nine courses, including cheese and a medley of desserts. There are no âthrow-awaysâ here: the butter, made nearby, comes from Bordier, and is one of the most celebrated in France. (Bordier also supplies the selection of magnificent, perfectly ripened cheeses.) The inventive, palate-tingling condiments â also sold in Roellingerâs shop â are provocative accompaniments to various dishes.\n\nHis Celtic Mustard, for example, a vivid blend of mustard, seaweed, anchovy and cider vinegar, was served alongside John Dory. The fish, marinated briefly in hazelnut oil and ginger, was exquisitely fresh, a silken delicacy resilient enough to stand up to the zing of the mustard.\n\nIn addition to the caraway, the tamarind, the passion fruit, and the cardamom, Roellinger highlights local ingredients â from humble Paimpol beans to recherche Tsarskaya oysters raised with great TLC in the bay of Mont St. Michel. These came together in a succulent broth â a foam of the white beans and the fleshy oysters, flavored with citronelle and garnished with the leaves of baby Brussels sprouts. Heated just enough to warm the oysters, the flavors and textures were as rich, as distinct, and as fresh as if they had been served raw but seemed to marry into a satisfying whole when treated to this preparation.\n\nAnd every single ingredient â from the butter to the oysters â seems to come from someone Roellinger knows personally. Heâs one chef you wonât find in Paris, Las Vegas or Tokyo.\n\nâI donât know how cooks succeed in cities,â he declares. âI canât understand chefs who simply order ingredients â five kilos of lobsters, say. Every chef should be an ecologist. What we do is a sublimation of nature. I listen to the ocean; I watch it dance. Behind every product thereâs a fisherman, an oyster farmer, a history, work. I know all of my suppliers. I need this. The main thing a cook needs is to know what it means to love â a land, people. This is not just a craft. It all starts with the mother â chasing after her child with a bite of something to eat, which is necessary for life.â\n\nBeyond that, he adds, once again waxing oceanic, âCooking, for me, is a way of casting off the moorings. Itâs a form of liberty.\n\nBURGUNDY ARTICLE: AUTHORâS CUT\n\nThis is the Author's Cut (cf director's cut) of an article on Burgundy I wrote for the October 2007 issue of Food & Wine. Note that the three categories are theirs.\n\nMOVERS & SHAKERS\n\n1) Jean-Marie Guffens: Defy and Conquer or Serial ClichÃ© Killer: âThere is no reason for any bottle of wine to cost more than 35 euros.â Thus spake Jean-Marie Guffens when I visited him in 2005. Always controversial, Guffens, a Belgian wine merchant who created his own small domaine â Guffens-Heynen -- with his wife, and a larger, negociant business â Verget â with Jean Rijckaert (who has since gone out on his own) in the mid 1980s is not about to stop ruffling feathers any time soon. Just about every move he makes challenges conventional wisdom. He was one of the first producers to bottle his top-of-the-line wines\n\neg Meursault, with screw caps rather than corks. But thatâs minor. He has essentially redefined the role of negociant in Burgundy, setting new standards of excellence and rigor, and producing breathtaking whites from purchased grapes throughout Burgundy, from Chablis to Pouilly Fuisse. Perhaps even more astonishing, he has proved that white wines from the Maconnais can be as majestic and mindblowing as Cortons and Montrachets from top houses (cf the 2002 Guffens-Heynen Pouilly-Fuisse âLa Roche,â) And when he works within those exalted appellations, his wines are downright miraculous. The 2005 Verget Corton-Charlemagne was so deep, so layered and so long, it was almost a liqueur. Reality Check: in the USA it sells for $200. What happened to the 35 euro principle? Of course, Guffens was talking about the price his exporters pay. Still, itâs quite a multiple. Though it may not be too much to pay for a wine that sends you into wine orbit after a single sip.\n\n2) Claude Bourgignon: The Soil Whisperer: When Claude Bourgignon talks, friends of the earth listen. Nearly 20 years ago, Bourgignon, a Paris-born microbiologist, pronounced these fighting words: âThe soils of many of Burgundyâs appellations (depleted by the use of chemical fertilizers, insecticides and week killers) have no more life in them than the soils of the Sahara desert.â Since that time, Bourgignon has become the flying terroirist, advising winemakers the world over how to reanimate their soils and, thus, enhance the typicity of their wines, by using natural methods like plowing with a horse and digging in biologically correct fertilizers, ie compost. His list of Burgundian clients reads like a 3 Michelin-star wine list, starting with Romanee-Conti, Leflaive, and Lafon in Burgundy, Anselme (Jacques) Selosse in Champagne, Chateaux Ausone and La Tour Figeac in St. Emilion, Mas Daumas Gassac in the Languedoc, and Mas Amiel in the Roussillon. The author of the dense but inspirational Le Sol, La Terre et Les Champs (to be republished in 2008), Bourgignon works with his wife Lydia from their laboratory LAMS in northern Burgundy. Their website, www.LAMS-21.com, filled with pictures of crawly creatures that aerate and replenish soils, explains the philosophy. By the way, to work with Bourgignon, you donât have to practice biodynamic farming, but it helps.\n\n3) Ma Cuisine: BurgBuff Central: On a cobbled alley off the Place Carnot, this restaurant plays to a knowing crowd of regulars -- both local and visiting wine buffs for whom the place seems to be something of an HQ. The ambiance couldn't be friendlier, the food couldn't be more pleasant, and the reasonably priced, book-length wine list will make you drool. Pierre and Fabienne Escoffier, husband and wife sommeliers, count as friends many of the leading vignerons in the 30 to 50-something age range, vintners like Dominique Lafond, Philippe Charlopin, Eric Rousseau, Pascal Lachaux (Domaine Arnoux) and Jean-Marc Roulot. Not surprising, then, that youâll find many of their wines â on the list. Anne Gros bottlings, for example, start with her âsimpleâ Burgundies and run throught a 2001 Combe dâOrveau (75 euros) to her 2001 Richebourg (325 e); similarly Coche-Dury and Lafon are equally well represented. Big spenders will want the 2002 Meursault Caillerets (170e) from the former and the 2001 Meursault Perrieres (180e) from the latter. And the list goes onâ¦and onâ¦and on, with long sections in Bordeaux (you can do a sweeping vertical of Yquem â from 1928 to 2002) and the Rhone (12 vintages of Chateau de Beaucastel in Chateauneuf-du-Pape.) Pierre runs the dining room; Fabienne, the kitchen, from shich she serves flavorful Burgundian comfort food. Her jambon persille is terrific and a heaven-sent match for white Burgundy. To accompany red wine, opt for perfectly roasted half pigeon or duck breast that is as rich as sirloin steak. If creme caramel is on the dessert table, don't miss it. Using her grandmother's recipe, the chef creates a version that is silken and ultra-creamy, with hits of lemon and rum. Note that the Escoffiers also run a wine shop, Les Caves Sainte Helene, next door. Ma Cuisine, passage Ste. Helene, 03.80.22.30.22; cave-sainte-helene@​wanadoo.fr.; ma cuisine@​wanadoo.fr.\n\n4) Bouchard Pere & Fils: Big and Beautiful or Super-sized and Just Plain Super: Under the direction of Joseph Henriot, this important producer has become a true ambassador for the region. It is one of Burgundyâs largest grower-negociant houses â making wine from both its own vineyards (more than 230 acres, most of them Premier or Grand Cru) as well as from grapes and young wines that it purchases. Once an underachiever with a lot of good land, Bouchard is now virtually synonymous with quality, offering excellence and consistency at every level of its encyclopedic range. (Bouchard owns William Fevre, an outstanding producer of Chablis.) In France, such domaines are called âlocomotives,â as they drive their respective regions forward, making a strong presence on the world stage. No question: we all adore the artist-vignerons whose minuscule production sells out before we can our hands on a bottle. But we should give thanks to quality-driven big houses like Bouchard. Not only do the set a fine example, they insure that thereâs enough great Burgundy to go around so that the less obsessive among us might just possibly find Bouchardâs âLa Romaneeâ or its Beaune 1er Cru Clos de la Mousse, both exclusives, happens on a wine list or see its signature wine, Beaune 1er Cru Greves Vigne de lâEnfant Jesus â an embodiment of the âiron fist in a velvet gloveâ analogy -- in a shop where weâve gone to get a special bottle for an important birthday.\n\n5) Vincent Dureuil-Janthial : The White Knight: Every generation has its shining stars, its role models. For Burgundy, in the first decade of the 21st century, Vincent Dureuil, 37, is a vigneron who will inspire generations to come for his unerring precision -- his flair for choosing exactly the right nano-second to harvest, for exampleso that the grapes are super-ripe without being over-ripe, and his light touch with the wine press. He made his name with magnificent white Rullys , particularly the 1er Cru, old vines bottlings like Les Margotes and Le Meix Cadot. Rully is part of the Chalonnais, south of the Cote dâOr. Youâre not supposed to make whites here that rival Puligny-Montrachet. Dureuil does. And recently he expanded his reach into the coveted crus of Puligny where he makes a predictably superbChamps-Gains. Nor are his reds â a sensual Mercurey and exquisite Nuits-St.-Georges des Argillieres â to be ignored. Production is very limited. If you find a bottle, grab it. And if you come across his old vines Rully, buy a case.\n\n6) Frederic Magnien:The Red Baron or God Bless the Child (thats Got his Own):\n\nWeâre in 1993 or thereabouts. Dad (Michel) nixes son Fredericâs ideas for change, telling him, basically, to go forth, get a negociants license, buy grapes, make wine his way and show dad what he could do. Which is precisely what Frederic did, bottling the resulting wines under the Frederic Magnien label. With brilliant results. Now heâs making wine from pruchased grapes under his own label and he has taken over his fatherâs vineyard, producing wines under the Michel Magnien label. Like his good buddy Vincent Dureil, Magnien, 35, is a role model and is likely to be remembered as one of the greatest producers of Burgundy of his generation, though his forte is red wine. Dynamic, with the can-do spirit of a Pilgrim father, Magnien has apprenticed in both Australia and California. He cycles the Cote dâOr countryside, scoping out potential vineyard sites. (Heâs looking for chalky, stony soils and good morning sunlight.) He then thins clusters with a vengeance and sorts the harvested grapes meticulously, two, three or four times. There are numerous bottlings, from small parcels throughout the Cote dâOrâ including Grand Crus such as Clos de la Roche and Charmes-Chambertin. Extremely hard to pick a favorite here but I see that, in my two pages of notes on the Frederic Magnien 2004 Chambertin Clos de Beze (GC), I finished with âWhat more can you demand of a wine?\n\n7) Domaine Dujac: Expanding Family Values: It is a truth universally acknowledged that there can never be enough great Burgundy. The recent expansion of the Dujac familyâs wine business, then, is cause for celebration. Jacques Seysses,a previous generationâs role model, built his justly esteemed domaine in Morey-St. Denis from scratch, consistently producing elegant, fine-grained red Burgundies â from Morey-St-Denis Villages to the Grand Cru Clos de la Roche, to Premier Crus from Gevrey-Chambertin. Recently joined by his son Jeremy, the two have added a negociant arm â Dujac Fils & Pere â thus expanding their line in Morey and Gevrey-Chambertin and adding some Chambolle-Musigny and Puligny-Montrachet as well. And they keep growing. In 2005 they acquired a couple of very desirable hectares, including minuscule pieces of Le Chambertin, Bonnes Mares and Romanee St. Vivant, and somewhat bigger parcels of the Premier Crus Romanee les Beaux Monts and Les Malconsorts. And as the family grows, so does the wine business. Jeremyâs wife Diana is a UC Davis-trained enologist. In addition to the Dujac wines, hey make the wines for her parentsâ domaine, Snowden Vineyards in Napa, and theyâve invested in land in the south of France as well, Domaine de Triennes. As the Seysses family goes global, this Burgundy lover prays that theyâll never leave Morey-St. Denis. That theyâll continue to make heartstopping wines like the vigorous, monumental 2003 Clos St. Denis Grand Cru, a wine that exudes everything anyone could want in a Burgundy.\n\n8) Philippe Pacalet: Theme and Variations: The Theme: two grape varieties â pinot noir and chardonnay; the Variations â the infinite expressions each of these grapes can render in the diverse soils of Burgundy. Yet another type of role model, Pacalet, 43 and a University of Dijon-trained enologist, goes to great lengths â literally â to give voice to as many expressions as possible to these two noble varietals. He rents small, well-placed vineyards throughout the region â from Chablis in the north, to St. Aubin in the south, with stops in Chambolle-Musigny, Pommard, Corton Charlemagne and, particularly, Gevrey Chambertin, where he has parcels in Grand Crus like Charmes-Chambertin and Premier Crus such as Lavaux St. Jacques â and maintains winemaking facilities at key spots within each subregion. Sounds like a big operation. Yet, all told, Pacalet has only 7.5 hectares, about the size of small-to-mid-sized family winery. And in order for his grapes and his soils to truly speak, Pacalet practises what I have called hypernatural winemaking. He waves away questions about organic or biodynamic farming, saying, âYes, yes, but what Iâm after is vin de terroir, I donât care about labels. I care about the life of the soil.âBriefly, then, Pacalet uses indigenous (wild) yeasts, ferments his wines in wood vats with no added sulphur, and bottles his wines without filtering them â including the whites, when thatâs possible. Non-interventionist winemaking is risky business: flawed wines are legion. Not, however, the finely-tuned wines chez Pacalet, from a Chablis 1er Cru Beauroy thatâs fresh as a waterfall, to a silky Chambolle-Musigny, to a vibrant, structured Gevrey-Chambertin. Maybe heâs the Glenn Gould of Burguny wine.\n\n9) Dominique Laurent: The Wine Refiner: It is said that artisanal negociant Dominique Laurent is to red Burgundy what Jean-Marie Guffens is to white Burgundy. Thatâs not inaccurate. A former pastry chef, Laurent set up his negociant business in the Cotes de Nuits in the â90s and very quickly became the reference for very high quality, hand-crafted red Burgundys. But I prefer to compare Laurent,who doesnât actually grow the grapes and make the wine he sells, to one of Franceâs great cheese mongers or affineurs, as theyâre called in France: heâs someone who buys top-quality, freshly made product â in this case red Burgundy wine from, say, Chambolle-Musigny and Gevrey Chambertin, including Grand Crus like Bonnes Mares Clos de Beze â and then âraisesâ it with TLC, in his own cellars, in his own barrels. (Snarks say âwith 200% new oak.â) The wines are bottled by hand, barrel by barrel, without filtration or added sulphur. Almost inevitably bottle variations occur, so does the occasional mini-flaw, but the wines â like a slightly oaky though structured and succulent 2002 Chambolle Musigny â are polished, site-specific, exciting and delicious. And, when all is said and done, the Guffens analogy has its merits: both have played major roles in redefining â and significantly upgrading â the role of the Burgundy negociant.\n\n10) Domaine Jacques-Frederic Mugnier/​ Chateau de Chambolle Musigny: The Clos Comes Home: This excellent (and improving), minuscule domaine, known for its racy, seductive versions of Chambolle-Musigny â including Bonnes Mares and Musigny â more than doubled in size in 2004 after recuperating the 9 hectare Clos de la Marechale, a Premier Cru in Nuits St. Georges that Mugnier ancestors had previously leased to Faiveley for a period of 50 years. In honor of the repatriation â Mugnier is the sole owner of the plot â new cellars were built and extra staff hired. Itâs an important property, Mugnier, a former pilot,has proven to be a superb and a dedicated young vigneron, and the wine world will be watching to see how he fares with what had been Faiveleyâs signature wine. Full disclosure, I have a certain sentimental attachment to this wine, having bought six bottles of the â59 (then made by Faiveley, natch) at an auction in the Loire Valley for around $40 a bottle. (Everyone else was bidding on Bordeaux, Chinon and Vouvray.)\n\nMOST SOUGHT AFTER\n\n1) 1985 Romanee-Conti GC: Domaine de la Romanee-Conti: At a May 2007 sale at Christieâs Auction House, a case of â85 Romanee-Conti\n\nfrom the Domaine de Romanee-Conti made wine auction history â bringing down the hammer at $237,000. This comes out to roughly $20,000 a bottle. A track\n\nrecord of outstanding quality combined with achingly limited supply (about 600 cases yearly from a 1.8 hectare plot), guarantees that this wine head\n\nany list of sought-after bottles.Domaine de la Romanee Conti, or DRC, as it's known, is one of the most famous domaines in winedom, its various bottlings topping the wish-list of any wine geek worth her Riedel Burgundy glass. And the Grand Cru Romanee Conti, with its tiny production of amazingly nuanced, ineffably profound wine, is la crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me and is priced accordingly. its very worthy, nearly as regal stablemates â La Tache, Richebourg, etc â will also set you back a pretty penny.But Romanee-Conti\n\nleads the pack. Two bottles of the â86 brought in 10,000 euros when the cellars of Parisâs Hotel de Ville (City Hall) were auctioned off last year. For a mere\n\n6600 euros you can buy a bottle of the 2003 â at least thatâs what the website www.monmillesime.com promises.\n\n2) Domaine Leroy: 1996 Richebourg: Such is the aura of sanctity surrounding Lalou Bize-Leroy (despite the haute couture wardrobe) that I find myself referring to her as Notre Dame de la Cote dâOr. A perfectionistâs perfectionist, Bize-Leroyâs closest rival is the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti â of which she was co-manager until 1993. Perhaps biodynamic viticultureâs most prestigious convert, Bize-Leroy makes splendid wines â whether at Domaine Leroy or Domaine DâAuvenay. A bottle of the above mentioned Richebourg is on sale at 888 Euros (down from 1110 Euros) on www.chateauonline.fr.\n\n3) Henri Jayer: 1999 Vosne-Romanee âCros Parantouxâ: When he died in September 2006 at the age of 84, Henri Jayer was firmly established as Burgundyâs Obi-Wan Kenobi, the sage, mentor and guru for a generation of idealistic young vintners. While Jayer made a complete range of Burgundies â from Passe-Tout- Grains to Echezeaux â his most treasured bottlings must surely be the Vosne-Romanees he made from a tiny Premier Cru parcel at the top of the appellation called Cros Parantoux. You can buy a magnum of the â99 for 9500 pounds sterling from the respected British merchants Berry Brothers & Rudd.\n\n4) Comte de Vogue: 1999 Musigny Vieilles Vignes: One of the oldest and most celebrated domaines in Chambolle-Musigny, Comte de Vogue owns 70% of the Grand Cru Le Musigny, with a healthy percentage of old vines. (Thereâs also a minuscule amount of white.) A profound, structured and immensely concentrated wine, the 1999 might just be ready to approach in 2008 â if you can find it. . (Hint: it has been seen on the Berry Brothers & Rudd website âwww.bbr.com -- at 389 pounds sterling.)\n\n5) Comtes Lafon: 1999 Montrachet: Although the domaine is mostly associated with Meursault â where it produces truly noble wines â its most sought after cuvee surely comes from the small piece of the Grand Cru Le Montrachet which it bought in 1991. You can find the 2004 in specialist shops in Paris for close to 1200 euros. The more evolved â99, however, is probably the one to drool over now â if you can find it.\n\n6) Coche-Dury: â96 Corton Charlemagne: Top wine mavens â the self-same sages who pronounce Jean-Francois Coche the best white wine maker in Burgundy â have declared his â96 Corton-Charlemagne to be âperfectâ â scoring it 20/​20; 100/​100. This wine has also been seen on Berry Brothers & Rudd website â at 2100 pounds sterling.\n\n7) Domaine Leflaive: 2002 Chevalier (or Batard) Montrachet: Under the ascot-sporitng, oh-so aristocratic Vincent Leflaive, this domaine became the most celebrated producer of Puligny-Montrachet. Its wines, admired for their consistency, majesty, age-ability and deliciousness, became âmust tastes.â When Anne-Claude Leflaive inherited the domaine from her father she became an empassioned convert to biodynamics. Batard and le Chevalier, both whites of great depth, intensity and purity, are considered the most complex and long-lived. (And, when asked to bring a bottle to a very special dinner, Anne-Claude â in my limited experience â usually offers Batard.) Expect to pay about $600 a bottle for either of the two recommended above.\n\n8) Domaine du Clos de Tart: 2002 Clos de Tart: Under Sylvain Pitiotâs stewardship, the wines from this domaine have become more stylish, riper, and more forward â seemingly without having lost complexity or elegance. The 2002 Clos de Tart is one of the stars of the vintage â racy, vigorous and downright gorgeous.\n\n9) Bernard Dugat-Py: 2002 (or 2005) Mazis-Chambertin: It would be sadistic to have singled out Bernard Dugatâs Chambertin GC: there are only 200 liters of it and, as a result, the cuvee must have its own tailor-made barrel. Nevermind. Dugat makes thrilling wine -- always in small quantities â in a number of Gevreyâs most privileged plots. Always intensely concentrated and ultra-ripe, they are also pure, fresh and majestic.\n\n10) Armand Rousseau: 2002 (or 2005) Chambertin-Clos de Beze: Never flashy, the Rousseau style is discretion itself. Subtlety is the byword here. The wines are haunting, finely-tuned and distinctly terroir-driven. They also age remarkably well. The Clos de Beze is a monument.\n\nUNDER THE RADAR\n\n1) Arnaud Ente: 2002 (or 2004 or 2005) Meursault âSeve du Closâ: (Kermit Lynch has the 2005 at $125.) Cut to the chase: some of the most thrilling white Burgundies Iâve ever tasted come from this eco-friendly small domaine. Ente makes a range of spectacular, unfiltered Meursaults, all of which are breathtaking. Clos des Seves, made from century-old vines, is complex, layered, and so rich itâs almost viscous.\n\n2) Domaine Arlaud: 2005 Morey-St.-Denis 1er Cru âLes Ruchotsâ: ($110): An eco-friendly domaine with a new generation at the helm and very small quantities of some mighty fine Burgundy. There are only 200 cases of this beauty. Immediately seductive, with a hauntingly mingled nose, lush, ripe 2005 fruit and cascade-like freshness, it still needs a bit of time to shed its baby fat and let its majesty shine.\n\n3) Domaine Patrick Javillier: 2005 Meursault âles Tilletsâ: ($63) For another view of Meursault, try the atypical but utterly authentic versions from Javillier. Oakaholics beware: wood flavors donât dominate here. These are mellow yellows of purity, extremely ripe fruit and lots of marrowy texture. Javillierâs Meursault Charmes is, arguably, his most prestigious and complex wine but âles Tillets,âa lipsmacking fusion of butter, cream, preserved lemon, minerals and stone, is more widely available.\n\n4) Anne Gros: 2005 Chambolle-Musigny La Combe dâOrveau ($94): Supple yet structured, poised and precise, the fragrant reds from Anne Gros really do seem to have a feminine touch. Her piece of La Combe dâOrveau, too high on the slope to be part of the Grand Cru, may owe a good part of its freshness and fluidity to a location formerly deemed too cool to merit classification. Whatâs more, you can start drinking this wine now. Grosâ powerful 2005 Richebourg â five times the price â demands patience, not to mention the detective skills of Sherlock Holmes.\n\n5) Domaine Robert Arnoux: 2005 Vosne-Romanee: ($78) This is when you know youâre a goner: I could spend an entire evening simply swirling and sniffing this wine â black pepper, white pepper, mingled fruit, licorice. On the palate, itâs equally fine â wonderfully nuanced and racy. While waiting for it to age a bit, opt for the complex, refreshingly fluid 2004 Romanee St. Vivant â if, that is, you can find it.\n\n6) Coche-Bizouard: 2005 Meursault âLes Chevaliersâ: Finesse is the byword at this rising star of a domaine, from the overachieving Aligote and Chardonnay, to the seductive Monthelie, to the range of excellent Meursaults, including the concentrated, crystalline âLes Chevaliersâ and the impossibly long âCharmes,â so rich itâs a meal in itself.\n\n7) Domaine Georges Mugneret-Gibourg: 2004 Nuits St. Georges 1er Cru âLes Chaignotsâ: ($88) I dare you to spit this nuanced, lipsmacking red, a weave of plum, herbal tea, and forest underbrush with light oak accents. And you can drink it now, while Marie-Andreeâs splendid 2005s -- from classified parcels in Vosne-Romanee, Chambolle-Musigny, Gevrey-Chambertin and Clos Vougeot (downright mindblowing)-- gently come of age.\n\n8) Domaine de la Pousse dâOr: 2005 Volnay 1er Cru En Caillerets Clos des 60 Ouvrees (Monopole): ($87): Patrick Landanger, who made his fortune in prosthetic body parts, bought this renowned domaine in 1998, built state-of-the-art cellars, invested in new and even more prestigious vineyard plots and has been restoring Pousse dâOr to its rightful gloryThe Clos des 60 Ouvrees is essentially a cru within a cru in Volnay, one of the finest red-wine appellations of the Cote de Beaune. Totally owned by this domaine, the vineyard is further blessed by having very old vines. Not surprising, then, that the ripe,luscious and stylish 2005 bursts with upfront charm but that thereâs real depth, elegance and complexity not too far under the surface.\n\n9) Jerome Galeyrand: 2005 Bonnes-Mares: A dynamic young vigneron whose wines have improved dramatically since his first harvest in 2002, Galeyrand seems to have hit his stride with the 2005 vintage. Rich, fresh, ultra-pure and mineral, his range of reds (unfined, unfiltered and bottled by the phases of the moon) â from Cotes de Nuits to Gevrey âChambertin -- are so tasty youâll lick your lips with pleasure. The Bonnes Mares is impossible not to love.\n\n10) Jayer-Gilles: 2002 or 2003 Nuits St. Georges 1er Cru âLes Damodesâ: Plush, pure and blueberry-scented, this is a supreme example of Nuits St. Georges â succulent, fresh and elegant, even in the overheated 2003 vintage.\n\nAll the Rage in Paris? Le Fooding\n\nBy JACQUELINE FRIEDRICH\n\nFebruary 9, 2001\n\nPARIS -- Fooding is the buzzword of the moment here. Merging the English words food and feeling into a French noun, it was coined in early '99 by Alexandre Cammas in the hip Parisian magazine Nova. And ever since, le fooding has been on every Paris gastronome's lips as well as on food-oriented pages from Elle to the Air France in-flight magazine.\n\nAt the end of the year, Figaroscope, the weekly entertainment section of the daily Le Figaro, wrote, \"[Le fooding] has become a movement and might well turn into a phenomenon, stirring the consciences of gastronomic critics. Behind its trendy sounding name, le fooding seeks to give witness to the modernity and new reality of drinking and eating . . . in the 21st century. . . . [E]verything is fooding so long as audacity, sense and the senses mix. After Gault and Millau's nouvelle cuisine, le fooding?\"\n\nYes, yes, but what on earth does that mean? To get a better grip on this seemingly seminal locution, I called Mr. Cammas himself. An intense 29-year-old beanpole, he told me, \"In February '99 I was writing an article on hot restaurants with DJs, like Cafe Mosaic and Man Ray, and, just to fool around, I asked if le fooding threatened le nightclubbing. It was a play on words. At the time, le fooding didn't mean anything. But right away the word was picked up by journalists in other papers. And it was irritating to see how people interpreted it. A writer at Liberation said that to do fooding you had to go to a restaurant carrying two mobile phones, wearing a Paul Smith suit, eat expensive, mediocre food and have Catherine Deneuve at the table opposite you. So at Nova we felt we had to define it and do something to make people understand what we meant by the term.\n\n\"We realized that the word fooding combined two aspects of the dining experience that previously had not been taken as an entity,\" Mr. Cammas continued. \"Up until now, the focus was totally gastronomic and that was too limited. To eat with feeling in France is to eat with your head and your spirit, with your nose, your eyes, your ears, not simply your palate. Concentrating on gastronomy alone means that certain places are completely overlooked.\n\n\"My favorite example is Favela Chic. It's not a good restaurant -- far from it -- and I've read lots of reviews that say that. But those reviews don't give readers the necessary information. Readers ought to know that people go to Favela Chic for a drink, then a second drink, maybe a feijoada that isn't the best in Paris but that's not important, and then at midnight there's an incredible ambiance with people dancing on tables. It's a real party atmosphere. Merely to say the feijoada was overcooked tells you nothing about the place. Yet I think the person who invented Favela Chic has as much merit within that particular category as the person who has three Michelin stars. It's just that their work is different, but it all revolves around the table. It's fooding, but it's not gastronomy. Fooding isn't a recipe. There's no cuisine of fooding. There's no chef who created fooding. It's not fusion food plus a DJ plus design. Fooding is simply a word that my collaborators and I find more appropriate for talking about the universe of the table.\"\n\nTo interpret -- or, as Mr. Cammas says, to \"read\" -- the \"universe of the table,\" the Nova crew works with a mental grid of criteria that takes into account food, decor, music, ambiance, hospitality, the pulchritude of the servers and more. In early December Nova mounted a week-long Fooding Festival with an art exhibit at the \"water bar\" of the tony boutique Colette; as well as cooking demonstrations accompanied by a soundtrack at Bon Marche's lavish food market; a debate at Cafe Flore; and an awards dinner at Alcazar, the left-bank restaurant owned by the British food and furniture mogul Terence Conran.\n\nAmong the 18 honorees were La Favela Chic (for best musical ambiance); Thiou, a sizzling new Vietnamese restaurant in the seventh arrondissement (for best place in which to \"see and be seen\"); Bon, owned by the omnipresent aging rock star Johnny Halliday and designed by Philippe Starck (for the most convivial toilets); Le Verre Vole, an adorable wine bar in the 10th arrondissement (best wine cellar); Twins, an eight-table family restaurant on the quickly gentrifying Rue Oberkampf (best canteen); and L'Astrance (for best menu).\n\nWhere sheer gastronomic excellence and creativity are concerned, L'Astrance, which opened in October, was one of the most notable restaurant debuts of the year 2000. Of the Fooding award, co-owner Christophe Rohat told me recently, \"I have no idea what it means.\"\n\nAnd, frankly, its definition seemed elusive, if not superfluous, to me. After all, haven't people always chosen to go to one restaurant over another for all of the diverse reasons subsumed by the word fooding? \"Yes,\" Mr. Cammas agreed, \"many people did fooding before the word existed. But more people are doing this today than ever before. One michelines less than one does fooding.\" (The man likes to coin words: micheliner , v. int.: to make ones dining decisions based on the Michelin Guide.)\n\nAnd in France, at least, Cammas and Co. may be on to something. \"It used to be that the sole reason we'd choose a given restaurant was because we wanted to eat whatever its particular specialty was -- choucroute, foie gras, oysters, couscous. Fooding has changed all that,\" explained Christian Flaceliere, a wine writer and consultant who happens to be not only a sensible man but one of the first people with whom I ever discussed the fooding phenomenon. At 55, he takes a longer view of the gastronomic scene than Mr. Cammas, tracing dining patterns from high-calorie postwar cooking through the streamlined nouvelle cuisine of the 1970s to the present day, and he sees fooding as one of the grand crossroads in French gastronomy.\n\nBut Mr. Flaceliere disagrees with Mr. Cammas about what it is. To him, fooding is very much a combination of fusion food and up-to-the-minute restaurants. \"Le fooding is always new,\" he asserted. \"It's 'we happy few,' a discovery, a place about which you can say, 'You haven't been there? You must be out of it.' Like Korova,\" he added, referring to a hot restaurant owned by the omnipresent, yuppie TV personality Jean-Luc Delarue, at which the signature dish is chicken in Coca-Cola sauce.\n\nMr. Flaceliere made a typically French moue when I observed that Mr. Cammas rejects the reflexive linking of fooding to trendiness and that Mr. Cammas, after all, invented the word. (Indeed, he has even copyrighted it.) But such ideological dust-ups seem inconsequential when the two men, both close observers of the French food scene, agree that the national way of eating is undergoing a fundamental change, a tectonic shift thus far described only by the loopy word fooding. It could only happen here.\n\nParis wine bars thinking 'petit'\n\nBy Jacqueline Friedrich International Herald Tribune\n\n(Note: this is the version that appeared on the IHT website. A slightly different version appeared in print.)\n\nTHURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2005\n\nPARIS Who is Marcel Richaud? And why is his name printed on nearly every wine list and scrawled on the blackboard of nearly every wine bar in Paris?\n\nRichaud is the vintner who brought southern RhÃ´ne wine into the modern era. His CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne and his Cairanne - a CÃ´tes du RhÃ´ne village - are plush reds with succulent, ripe fruit, great freshness and purity of flavor, a welcome change from the scratchy, leathery, standard RhÃ´nes of yesteryear. So when you see a Richaud wine on a list, be happy. You can't go wrong here; the price is right and the flavor is delectable.\n\nWine styles change. Time was when every bistro offered Duboeuf Beaujolais alongside Jaboulet's Parallel 45 from the RhÃ´ne and Olga Raffault's Chinon. And a good wine bar owner would go out into the countryside, buy in bulk from his favorite vigneron, and bottle the decidedly rustic - though often charming - wine himself. That was maybe 20 years ago. Today's Parisian bistrotier steers clear of the big houses. Like a journalist chasing a scoop, buyers scour the major wine fairs - Vinisud, say, or the Salon des Vins du Val de Loire - and their collateral \"off\" tastings to find dynamic young vintners who make exciting, reasonably priced wine. So the good Paris wine bars, wine-oriented bistro or wine shop - like Lavinia near the Madeleine, Le Verre Vole on the Canal St. Martin, Les Papilles and the CafÃ© de la Nouvelle Mairie in the Fifth and Les Enfants Rouges in the Marais - are the best places to sample the delicious discoveries coming from every corner of the hexagon and to find out what's really happening on the French wine scene.\n\nWe are living in a golden age of French wine quality, despite the well-publicized crisis in sales. True, disgruntled southern growers from the hills behind Montpellier to the outskirts of Beziers have made headlines recently.\n\nBut producers like Richaud and Sylvain Fadat, who produces Domaine d'Aupilhac in the Languedoc, are making - and selling - wonderful wine. Fadat, however, was one of the precursors.\n\nThe heart of his production is a range of fragrant, spicy and elegant reds from the Montpeyroux subregion of the Coteaux du Languedoc. Like most Coteaux du Languedoc reds, they are made from a mix of grape varieties similar to that of southern France in general and Chateaneuf-du-Pape in particular. A quirkier Aupilhac red, however, has become wine bar favorite. His pure Le Carignan, a formerly overlooked, undervalued player in the southern mix, is a supple, characterful red with delectably juicy fruit.\n\nThe popularity of Fadat's Le Carignan evidences some of the anti-merlot sentiment that was so vividly expressed in the film \"Sideways.\" Indeed, the weirder the grape, the more wine lovers want to drink the wine. Bring on the Cinsault (another part of the southern mix), the Poulsard (the base of many of the Jura's light reds), and Gaillac's Le Len de l'El! By now, indeed, many wine lovers are wondering just when Petit Manseng is going to join the galaxy of superstar grapes.\n\nA staple of France's southwest, Petit Manseng is mostly associated with luscious, nectarlike sweet white wines from JuranÃ§on and Pacherenc de Vic Bilh, a stone's throw from both the Spanish border and the French resort town Biarritz. Perhaps the greatest ambassador of JuranÃ§on is Charles Hours, a bear of a man (coincidentally, his name is a homonym for \"bear\" in French).\n\nHis wines are as generous as he is and they seem to be on every Parisian list - whether the sumptuous sweet wine Clos Uroulat or Clos Marie, made from Petit Manseng's sibling, Gros Manseng.\n\nAnother dry white that is all but unavoidable on stylish Paris lists is a Muscadet from Jo Landron's Domaine de la Louvetrie. It's called Amphibolite, after the soils on which its grapes grow. The wine is neither chaptalized nor filtered. Chaptalization refers to the addition of sugar to fermenting grape juice to raise the alcohol level; filtration is a way of clarifying a wine. The resulting wine is very pure, mineral and fresh as a sea breeze.\n\nMost, if not all, of the above producers make \"natural\" wine. Richaud, for example, uses indigenous yeasts rather than adding industrial yeasts to start fermentation; he never chaptalizes or adds acid, and he does not filter his wines.\n\nEcologically friendly winemaking is one of the strongest new trends in French winemaking. It may take a number of forms - from \"agriculture raisonnÃ©e\" (literally, reasoned agriculture), to organic, to biodynamic (a system, in which vineyard operations are scheduled by the positions of the planets). In the RhÃ´ne, Richaud is joined by Domaine Gramenon, Dard & Ribo, Domaine Viret and Yves Cuilleron - all of whom also share shelf and blackboard space in up-to-the-minute Paris wine shops and wine bars.\n\nWhile the movement toward natural wines has been growing in force from Champagne to Corsica, the Loire Valley has been one of the leaders. Among the first to grab the imagination of the wine-loving public were the brothers Thierry and Jean-Marie Puzelat, who follow many of the same principles as Richaud in their relatively humble appellation, Cheverny.\n\nLocated in the Loir & Cher department, Cheverny's is a terrain more renowned for its chateaus, its white asparagus and its strawberries. Its wines, made chiefly from sauvignon blanc, gamay, pinot noir and cabernet franc, are direct, easy-going quaffers. The Puzelats' wines, however, seem to come from another world: the"
