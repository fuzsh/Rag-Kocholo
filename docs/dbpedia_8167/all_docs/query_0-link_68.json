With a career spanning over half a century, she made immense contributions to rock and roll, earning her the title of \"The Queen of Rock 'n' Roll\". Turner's early life was marked by hardship. Her parents, both sharecroppers, were unable to provide a stable home due to the tumultuous nature of their relationship and economic struggles. Despite these challenges, Turner found solace in music, singing in the church choir and later forming a musical duo with her sister. Her big break came when she joined Ike Turner's band, the Kings of Rhythm, in the late 1950s. Her powerful vocals quickly made her the star of the show and she adopted the stage name Tina Turner. Turner's professional and personal relationship with Ike was tumultuous and marked by domestic abuse. However, despite the personal turmoil, the duo produced a string of hits throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, including \"River Deep - Mountain High\" and \"Proud Mary\", which won them a Grammy Award. In 1976, Turner left Ike, and embarked on a solo career that would surpass her success as part of the duo. Her 1984 album Private Dancer was a commercial and critical success, earning her three Grammy Awards.
