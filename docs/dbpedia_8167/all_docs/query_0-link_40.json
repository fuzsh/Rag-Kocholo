        "text": "Born in Aix en Provence in 1989, TMM is a versatile artist.\n\nHe inherited his love for art from his familly. His father was a painter and his grandfather a sculptor, he grew up surrounded by creation since his childhood. Very early, when he was only 17, he discovered his aptitude for drawing. His passion for cartoons and comics fed his appetite for creation and his talent. He then used the personages that fascinated him and that fed his imagination as first models.\n\nHe grew up in Paris, in the Latin quarter, and got an education about cinema and music. His parents encouraged him to get familiarized with the great French, English and American classics.\n\nA cultural background that will forge the work of the artist. This openness of spirit, TMM owes it as well to his numerous trips and encounters. He decided to go alone in his adventures and imbued himself completely in the culture of the countries he visited. We can notice specially the influence of his trips to New York in 2011, which helped him to perfect his style. There, he discovered Pop Art which was determining in his latter work.\n\nThe way in which he paints and makes his collages took a turn as well when he met artist Joann Sfar. His compositions have become more elegant and eccentric with the passage of time."
