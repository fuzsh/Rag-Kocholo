With a \"flingue\" you can smoke them out!\n\nKnowing that, how would you translate \"flingue\" in slang english?\n\n\"A shooter\" would be one possibility.\n\nFlingue is quite common in french for any firearm.\n\nthink of the Gainsbourg song \"le poinçonneur des lilas\"\n\nY a de quoi devenir dingue\n\nY a de quoi prendre un flingue\n\n\"piece\" could be a good equivalent in English slang.\n\nXiancee is right! And in order to fuel this thread, I add two words connected with \"Flingue\":\n\n1/ flinguer (flinguer quelqu'un = to smoke somebody out)\n\n2/ flingueur (un flingueur / une flingueuse = a gunman / a gunwoman)\n\nAt that point, I refer to the Michel Audiard' movie which name is \"Les tontons flingueurs\". In that criminal underworld film, each boss has is own first dedicated gunman who is designed by \"première gâchette\" (“gâchette” here means “gunslinger” rather than a trigger)"
