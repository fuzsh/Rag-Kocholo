        "text": "If you were asked about the most delicious cuisine in the world, what countries would come to mind? According to most of the rankings I’ve read, France is often placed second, with Italy as the solid winner.\n\nIn 2010, UNESCO paid a gracious tribute to French gastronomy by inscribing it on the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list. Let’s try to understand why French cuisine is held in such high regard around the world, and what makes it special.\n\nIn this article, I will present you with a list of eight French foods you must try, a French cuisine overview, the top words and expressions for talking about food and cooking in French, and much more.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMust-Try French Dishes\n\nUnique French Products\n\nFood Vocabulary\n\nFrogs and Other Misconceptions\n\nLe Mot De La Fin\n\n1. Must-Try French Dishes\n\nTo begin with, here are the top eight dishes you should definitely try in France or in an authentic French restaurant. Some of these can be cooked just about anywhere with local ingredients but, especially for the cheesy meals, you often need the original imported product to make it taste and feel right.\n\n1 – Tartiflette\n\nTartiflette is one of the classic French dishes (and a personal favorite of yours truly), originating from mountainous regions such as the northern Alps. It has everything you could dream of: potatoes, fried onions, lardons (sliced bacon), a hint of white wine and garlic, and an unhealthy amount of reblochon, one of the tastiest cheeses ever conceived.\n\nAs long as you get the right ingredients, you cannot fail at cooking a Tartiflette. Just put everything but the cheese in a tray, slice a big reblochon in half along the width, and place each part on top of everything else. Put it in the oven until it looks glorious and golden.\n\n★ Tartiflette recipe\n\nUne tartiflette (Photo by David Harris under CC BY 2.0)\n\n2 – Steak Tartare\n\nDo you trust your butcher? Are you convinced their meat is fresh, high-quality, and kept refrigerated at all times? If that’s the case, then it’s time to experience the very best way to enjoy beef: raw.\n\nThe meat can either be prepared with a grinder (the lazy and lesser option) or minced with a knife (the flavorful yet tedious option—but good things come at a price, right?). Then, mix it with a bunch of herbs and condiments, a fresh egg yolk, capers, minced shallots, and I promise you the time of your life.\n\n★ Steak Tartare recipe\n\nUn steak tartare (Photo by insatiablemunch under CC BY 2.0)\n\n3 – Cassoulet\n\nCassoulet is a specialty from the Languedoc region based on white beans and slow-cooked meat. The name comes from the traditional cooking pot called cassole where the cassoulet simmers for over seven hours, through a very specific and controlled process.\n\nIt’s something that I’d recommend you try in a good French restaurant before you try it at home, because of the wide variety of ingredients and difficult cooking methods involved.\n\nWhen cooked properly, the duck leg confit is slow-cooked in duck fat which tenderizes the meat until it just melts in your mouth. It’s nothing like chicken—it’s just on a whole different level.\n\n★ Cassoulet recipe\n\nUn cassoulet\n\n4 – Crêpes\n\nLet’s start off with an important disclaimer: Crêpes are NOT pancakes (and vice-versa). The list of ingredients is very similar, but American-style pancakes are thick and fluffy while French crêpes are thin and delicate.\n\nYou can eat crêpes with sweet ingredients (jam, chocolate, brown sugar) or savory ingredients (bacon, spinach, mushrooms). We even have a special holiday for crêpes called La chandeleur (originally a Christian celebration that lost its religious meaning for most French people over the years).\n\n★ Crêpes recipe\n\nDes crêpes\n\n5 – Endives au jambon\n\nBeing a specialty from my home region, this recipe has always been close to my heart. It’s based on steam-cooked endives (“endives” or “chicory”) wrapped in cooked ham, bathed in béchamel sauce, and topped with grated cheese.\n\n★ Endives au jambon recipe\n\nDes endives au jambon (Photo by Jeremy Keith under CC BY 2.0)\n\n6 – Coq au vin\n\nAre you looking for French cuisine classics with sophisticated ingredients to impress your friends? Look no further.\n\nCoq au vin is a timeless classic: a casserole of chicken legs slowly stewed in red wine with herbs, spices, olive oil, and tons of fancy stuff that make for a rich and deep flavor.\n\n★ Coq au vin recipe\n\nDu coq au vin (Photo by Steven Depolo under CC BY 2.0)\n\n7 – Moule marinières\n\nOften found in the northern regions of France and in Belgium, moules marinières are usually served with fries and simply called moules frites (“mussels and fries”).\n\nThe eponymous marinière sauce is made with white wine and shallots (add some cream for a rich and delicious twist). This is a classic dish often found in inexpensive brasseries (simple French restaurants with a cheap lunch menu) in the Hauts-de-France region.\n\n★ Moules frites recipe\n\n8 – Fondue savoyarde\n\nTake a ton of mountain cheese (typically Comté, Beaufort, or Emmental) and melt it with white wine, garlic, and a bit of kirch. Serve it with bread, charcuterie (cold meat cuts) and more white wine, and there you have it: the most decadent of French specialties!\n\nBut how do you eat that? It’s simple enough: stick a piece of bread on a spike and dip it into the cheese right in the cooking bowl. Try not to lose your bread!\n\n★ Fondue savoyarde recipe\n\nLa fondue savoyarde (Photo by Camille Gévaudan under CC BY-SA 3.0)\n\n→ Learn more about French dishes with our free vocabulary list on FrenchPod101.com.\n\n2. Unique French Products\n\nNow that I’ve teased you with French recipes, let’s talk about another important aspect of French cuisine that doesn’t involve spending two hours in the kitchen or juggling five pans and long lists of bizarre ingredients.\n\nFrance is famous for a lot of unique products, many of which feature various region-specific twists: le vin (“wine”), le fromage (“cheese”), le pain (“bread”), and la charcuterie (“cold cuts”).\n\nThey all play a big role in the so-called Art de Vivre (“Art of Living”) that we pride ourselves on cultivating. The French sure love their wine, cheese, bread, and charcuterie, especially when all four are combined to make for the happiest apéro (“happy hour”).\n\n1 – “Wine is bottled poetry.”\n\n(Robert Louis Stevenson)\n\nFrench wine is produced across the entire country in large quantities (around sixty million hectoliters per year, or about eight billion bottles), making France one of the biggest wine producers in the world.\n\nMost wines are made to accompany food and this is where it gets tricky. Even though there are some general rules, such as “red wine is for red meat, white is for white meat and fish,” it’s more complex than that.\n\nWith thousands of different bottles of all shapes and colors, the wine department in a French supermarket is intimidating. Truth be told, it takes lots of research or serious oenology classes before you can choose the right bottle at the right moment. But don’t sweat it too much; unless you’re dining with experts, nobody will notice if the pairing isn’t perfect.\n\nWith so many styles, grape types, terroirs, and labels, it’s a whole world of rich and interesting flavors begging to be explored. You can sip it, drink it, share it, gift it, or even cook with it. Wine is a pillar of French culture.\n\nDu vin (“Wine”) (Photo by PRA under CC BY-SA 3.0)\n\n2 – “Life is great. Cheese makes it better.”\n\n(Avery Aames)\n\nI’ll do my best not to get too emotional in this section, as cheese is my personal weakness and I could praise it for hours.\n\nThere are around 1600 distinct French cheeses, each with a unique shape, texture, aroma, flavor, and other properties. They can be made from various kinds of milk and all have different levels of humidity, fat, and calcium.\n\nFrench President Charles de Gaulle once said: “How can you govern a country which has two hundred and forty-six varieties of cheese?” Fair enough, but we can simplify it by placing them into only eight categories.\n\nFrench cheese is not for the faint of heart. They range from the easy-going and fairly mainstream Brie to the robust and divisive Roquefort. But the most intense experience lies with the smelliest and most repulsive-looking pieces of the Plateau de fromages (“Cheese platter”).\n\nCheeses with a lot of character may not be for everyone but once you fall in love, you’re in for a treat. Nothing can compare to the hypnotizing scent of a Munster, and the rich texture of melted Reblochon will make you reach new heights of foodgasm.\n\nUn plateau de fromages (“A cheese platter”)\n\n3 – “Tout est bon dans le cochon.“\n\n(“Everything is good in a pig.” – French proverb)\n\nAnother classic French apéro, often served alongside wine and cheese, is charcuterie.\n\nIt covers a wide range of cold cuts, from ham to saucisson (dry-cured sausage), mortadella, smoked ham, cured ham, and much more.\n\nThe word charcuterie originally comes from chair cuite (“cooked flesh”). It can be cooked or raw and comes mostly (but not exclusively) from pork, with salt used as a preservation agent. It’s especially popular in southern France and in the mountains, but still widely enjoyed in the rest of the country.\n\nAn all-time classic of charcuterie is the saucisson sec: a thick dry-cured sausage eaten cold in thin slices, and best enjoyed with bread, wine, and friends.\n\n4 – Happiness is a Fresh Baguette\n\nWe’ve all heard of the iconic French baguette, and as you walk through the streets of any city in France, you’ll realize that there’s truth in the cliché. The French do stroll around with bread under their arm.\n\nHere are the golden rules of baguetiquette:\n\nYou can wipe your plate with it.\n\nYeah, you can hold it with your fingers and dip it in sauce. It’s fine. (And it makes washing dishes easier. Everybody wins.)\n\nDon’t put it on the plate.\n\nIn restaurants, bread is usually served in a basket. In general, you might notice that French people never place bread on their plate but rather next to it on the table.\n\nCover it with cheese…\n\n…or whatever you like, really. Paté is a prime choice; chocolate spread or crème de marrons (“chestnut paste”) are also highly recommended. Oh, yeah, don’t forget to try sticking squares of chocolate bars into a baguette, especially when it’s still warm.\n\nBite the end of the baguette.\n\nIt is scientifically proven that resisting the urge to bite the crunchy end of a freshly cooked baguette is impossible. It usually happens right in the street, seconds after you’ve left the bakery.\n\nDes baguettes (“Baguettes”)\n\n→ Make sure to stop by our free vocabulary list on Famous French Food, with recordings to perfect your pronunciation!\n\n3.

Frogs and Other Misconceptions\n\nThe worldwide popularity of French cuisine comes with a fair share of mistakes and misconceptions. Here are a few you might have heard about:\n\n1 – The Frog Fallacy\n\nThere’s a common belief, especially among the British, that the French are avid frog eaters. Some people even refer to French people as “Frogs.”\n\nFrog legs are indeed eaten in France but they’re not nearly as popular as you might think. I have lived in various regions of France for most of my life and not once have I encountered frog legs. Sure, I could have gone out of my way to find them and give it a try, but I’ve never seen it as a plat du jour (“dish of the day”) in a restaurant.\n\nIt seems to be more popular in the eastern regions where they are usually ordered as a delicacy in restaurants, or for special occasions. The legs are often grilled or deep-fried, but are occasionally boiled, baked, or stir-fried.\n\nInterestingly, they’re also eaten in Southeast Asia, parts of Europe, and the southern U.S. Archeologists found proof of frog-eating in the UK, dating back to 8000 years ago, which makes them the historical first frog eaters in Europe. Just sayin’.\n\nIt is true, however, that we eat escargots (“snails”). Then again, it’s a delicacy and absolutely not a common meal, but they’re still rather affordable and presumably delicious. Personally, I never got beyond the psychological barrier and I intend to keep on living a snail-free life.\n\n2 – The Croissant Conspiracy\n\nThere is a common belief that the French are eating a lot of croissants and usually having them for breakfast.\n\nHeck, just type “French breakfast” into your usual search engine and you shall find a sneaky croissant in almost every single photo! By the way, you’ll also see a LOT of food on the table, which is another fallacy.\n\nFirst of all, croissants are not that popular. Sure, it’s a classic viennoiserie (“pastry”) and I wouldn’t mind waking up with one of these buttery babies on the table. However, at best, we’d buy them on a Sunday to celebrate the day off and make breakfast special. Or maybe bring some to work in order to buy our coworkers’ good graces.\n\nOh, and by the way: Why would anyone buy croissants when you can have pains au chocolat (chocolate croissants) for roughly the same price?\n\nSecond of all, in France, breakfast is the least important meal of the day and you’ll rarely see tables full of cereals, bread, fruits, pastries, juices, and whatnot. Why is that? Because we put much more emphasis on lunch, so we wouldn’t want to be full when the time comes for the apéro.\n\nDes croissants (“Croissants”)\n\n3 – French Toast, French Bread, French Whatever\n\nFrench kiss? French lover? Yeah, we invented that, I’m fine with it.\n\nBut French fries? No. I have to give credit where it’s due and celebrate Belgium for their love of greasy food, amazing chocolate, and a mindblowing number of different beers!\n\nIf you want to have a good time with deep-fried chunks of potatoes dipped in a thick homemade Dallas sauce, Belgium is the place to be.\n\nWe simply call them frites (Literally: “fried”) and every educated French person knows they’re from Belgium.\n\nWhat about French toast? Nope. That’s actually Italian, dating back from ancient Rome. All credit goes to Apicus, a Roman from the fifth century, for this delightful recipe.\n\nIn France, we call it pain perdu (Literally: “lost bread” or “wasted bread”). How “wasted” became “French” is a mystery I’m not sure I want to solve.\n\n5.
