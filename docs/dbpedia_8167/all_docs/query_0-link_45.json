        "text": "Best French film ever?\n\nWho am I to judge this? On my own personal best-of list are Les Enfants du Paradis, La Grande Illusion, Le Dernier Metro, Pouic-Pouic, Les Aventures de Rabbi Jacob, 37Â°2 le Matin, Subway, Le Grand Bleu, Les Tontons Flingueurs, La Vie et Rien d'Autre, Cyrano de Bergerac and Le Pere Noel est une Ordure.\n\nWhat film are you most excited about in this year's French Film Festival?\n\nThat's a tricky question. I could say the 22 movies that have no local distributors. But maybe the most provocative and humanistic movie is The Clink of the Ice, directed by Bertrand Blier.\n\nWhat do you hope the festival will achieve?\n\nThat with every year, more Australians will come to appreciate French cinema, and that it will also help to build even stronger links between our two countries. I also hope that it encourages more people to come to the Alliance Francaise to learn French.\n\nHave you ever made an enemy through the selection (or non-selection) of a film?\n\nEach year, I guess. Whenever you make a selection, it's bound to attract hostility from some people. But in all sincerity, it's not a problem for me. It's part of the job.\n\nWhat drives non-French people to become francophiles?\n\nA spirit of adventure, the wish to know more about our culture and the dream of having a romance with a French man or woman!\n\nYou've worked in New Caledonia. Do you think Australians should be more conscious of French culture in the Pacific?\n\nI think that Australia is open to Pacific culture, including French culture. We [the French Embassy] work closely to bring more cultural events to Australia from French overseas territories.\n\nHave you been surprised by audience reactions?\n\nAlways - and usually in an unexpected and positive way. But occasionally I've also been a little disappointed because a movie that I really liked didn't find an audience.\n\nWhat does the French language express better than English?\n\nLove.\n\nThe best place in Sydney for\n\nFrench pastries?\n\nMy special chocolate cake is to die for. And my wife is number one when it comes to creating la galette des rois (the cake of kings), so I would have to say that home is the best place.\n\nAre there foods you miss from home?\n\nThere's nothing special that I miss, as the food here is so good. Well, maybe just a few French cheeses like reblochon, tome de Savoie or Beaufort.\n\nFrench films have a reputation for racy content. Is that reputation justified?\n\nDefinitely! In this year's festival line-up, it's hard to find a movie that's not provocative or doesn't feature a sex scene.\n\nAustralian wine: discuss.\n\nI have learnt to appreciate white wine during my stay in Australia. I really love it, as there are some very good ones here. I have had more difficulties with red wine, as most of them are too strong for me.\n\nHow does French theatre differ from Australian theatre?\n\nTheatre is universal - Moliere, Shakespeare, Goldoni, Chekhov, Ibsen or Corneille, have no borders. Wherever you are, actors deliver emotion, sweat, words and guts to the public, without a net.\n\nAny Carla Bruni music on your iPod?\n\nYes, three songs from her first album and four from the third one. I have 2926 tunes in my iPod: 65 per cent French and 35 per cent from elsewhere. I have a few Italian songs and only rock from Britain, the US and, of course, Australia.\n\nDo you make films?\n\nNot at all. I take photos. But I hope that one day there will be a \"Garnier\" movie on screen. I am counting on my daughter, Eve, to be a director and Alexandre, my son, to be an actor.\n\nWhat's the biggest misapprehension about French people?\n\nThat we can't understand cricket.\n\nIf you could ban one film on the grounds of artistic merit, what would it be?"
