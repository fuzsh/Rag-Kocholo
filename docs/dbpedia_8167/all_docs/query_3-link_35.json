Archives are incomplete –​documents (especially screenplays) more often than not lack useful details such as dates, names or attributions, handwriting can be almost impossible to decipher. Credits are unreliable, screenplays are not systematically preserved, and what about all those screenplays that never make it to the screen? We encountered all of these difficulties and many more in the researching and writing of this book. However, we also discovered a rich and underused resource that required us to think differently about cinema. If our previous work on stars and popular film had already taught us the importance of looking beyond the idea of the film as the text and the director as its author, this work on screenwriters emphasised this still further, by requiring us to think about the development phase, a moment when many films are still possible. During the development phase of this study, we quickly became aware that many books on screenwriters were also possible, and we were faced with many difficult decisions. This book, then, offers one possible approach to French screenwriters; the first written in English. We hope it will be the first of many.\n\nA note on translations Translations from the French are our own unless otherwise attributed. For economy of space, we have not provided the original French for quotations from secondary sources unless we felt it was essential to do so. All quotations from screenplays, including film dialogue, are given in French and an English translation is provided in brackets or in a note. Given the so-​called ‘untranslatable’ nature of many of the films we address (especially comedies), we have given priority to conveying the general sense, indicating any puns or double meanings in a note or in our analysis.\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nReferences and filmographies Page numbers or weblinks are provided where possible for French newspaper and magazine articles, but for those consulted in the Cinémathèque française press review collections and in some other archives, these are not available. We provide selective filmographies at the end of each chapter including information about directors, writers and adaptation sources if applicable. Dates given for films are for the year of release in France unless otherwise indicated. English (UK followed by US) titles are provided when they are available; we have not translated French titles where the film did not have a release in English-​speaking countries. We have not been able to include a full filmography –​let alone a full list of screenplays –​for many of our writers given the extensive nature of their outputs.

This conception of screenwriting is remarkably similar to that of Charles Spaak, an unlikely ally for Godard, who believed that ‘scriptwriting is an art whose laws may be rigid but are unknowable; creativity is and must remain a mystery’ (Crisp 2002: 206). One of the central aims of this book is to clarify and demystify the place and power of the screenwriter within film production, in creative and artistic terms, but also in the context of film criticism and film discourse more generally, whether that be in mainstream, popular or auteur cinema. In studies of French cinema, words have long been considered to be of secondary importance to the image. Given the primacy of the moving image for the definition of cinema, this is perhaps unsurprising, especially in light of film’s battle to be recognised as the ‘seventh art’. Isabelle Raynauld (1990: 24) begins her study of screenwriting in France by pointing out that the different professionals involved disagree about how to define the concept. She refers to a ‘battlefield for debates’ between cinema and literature, and between theoreticians and practitioners. Alison Smith (2004: 204) describes a ‘hysterical relation with the concept of the screenwriter’ in French cinema where, critically speaking, the role is seen as either dominant or completely eclipsed, while the reality is, of course, that screenwriting has remained an fundamental part of the industry since the coming of sound. What these studies show is the polemical focus on screenwriters and screenwriting throughout French film history; screenwriting tends to feature either as a rather vague, ill-​defined indicator of ‘quality’ (a ‘good’ film is a ‘well-​ written’ film), or as a trigger for anxiety around the status of cinema as an art form in its own right. Words, even when they are an integral part of cinema, as they have been certainly since the conversion era in the late 1920s, have been perceived as\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\n2\n\nScreenwriters in French cinema\n\nbelonging principally to other art forms (literature and theatre). They are thus seen as ‘polluting’ the purity of the cinematic art form, which derives essentially from images and how they are put together: mise en scene, cinematography and editing. Examples of how this perception has manifested itself can be seen in two of the best-​known controversies concerning the word/​image relation in French cinema history. The first of these is the ‘filmed theatre’ debates of the early 1930s and the second, the attack on the screenwriters of the post-​war tradition of quality by the future directors of the New Wave in the 1950s. In both of these examples, the involvement of screenwriters in the filmmaking process was criticised because they were seen first and foremost as dealing in words, not images: ‘men of letters, [who] look down on cinema because they undervalue it’ (Truffaut 2009: 48).1 René Clair had already articulated similar concerns in 1929, declaring that the ‘cinema must remain visual at all costs’ (Abel 1988: 39). A third word/​image debate that arose in the 1980s around the cinéma du look takes a rather different approach, criticising screenwriters for the insubstantial plots and feeble dialogue of films that privileged style over substance in an attempt to compete with Hollywood blockbusters (Frodon 1995: 575–​7; Austin 2008: 150–​2). It is notable that all these debates, which entail a fundamental mise en cause of the screenwriter, erupted at moments in French film history when the industry was arguably under particular threat in national terms: the coming of sound was a commercial disaster for the French film industry, which lost out to US-​and German-​patented technologies; in the post-​war period, cheap and highly popular US imports threatened to swamp a fragile French industry rebuilding itself after the Occupation; and in the 1980s, once again, Hollywood competition drew audiences away from domestic productions. Thus, in the French context at least, debates around screenwriting appear to be bound up with those relating to the survival of the national cinema. We would argue that this is linked to the central role that screenwriters have played in the evolution and development of French cinema since the coming of sound, if not before. They have held a central role in determining the images it has shown, the stories it has told and the ways in which it has told them, as well as the language it has used to do so.2 Within the French film industry, the role of the screenwriter has traditionally been divided into three key areas of practice: adaptation (by the adaptateur), screenplay construction (by the scénariste) and dialogue writing (by the dialoguiste). In this book, we will use the English terms adaptor, screenwriter and dialogue writer to refer to these three roles. In practice, of course, the boundaries between these three areas are often blurred and individual writers are frequently involved in more than one area. However, given the industry emphasis on these three areas of practice, they have proved useful for us in our investigation of screenwriters and their contributions to\n\n3\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nthe collective practice of filmmaking. Our study thus touches on questions linked to adaptation, such as approaches to source texts and the status of literary and theatrical adaptations; to narrative structures, such as what stories are told, how they are told and how characters are constructed; to the emergence and evolution of dominant genres, recurring themes or mythologies; and to dialogue and the role of words in what is frequently considered to be an essentially visual medium.\n\nHistorical background Both the role of screenwriters and these areas of practice have evolved considerably over the ninety years covered in this volume. Production practices, including screenwriting, have been influenced by technology, economic imperatives, political regimes, as well as aesthetic preoccupations throughout this period, which has seen several key moments of change. The first of these is the coming of sound in the late 1920s and early 1930s and the resulting emphasis placed on dialogue. The impact of sound on the development of classic realist cinema in France has been outlined by Colin Crisp (1997: 110), who highlights the role that popular theatre played in providing tried-​and-​tested scripts for wary producers in an industry where scriptwriters were lacking. We do not have space here to rehearse the well-​known debates surrounding the talkie and the critically derided yet extremely popular ‘filmed theatre’ that came to dominate French screens in the early 1930s and that has influenced the tradition of French comedy throughout the whole period covered in this book.3 What is notable in the context of our interest in dialogue, though, is the anxiety that the spoken word provoked among certain directors and critics, as creating a hybrid that was neither theatre nor cinema. Again and again we see evidence of a ‘split conception of sound’ (Devereux cited in Price 2010: 135), where speech is hived off from any other sounds. Complaints abound regarding the verbal incontinence of the film parlant, regarded by many critics as vastly inferior to the film sonore, which tested the aesthetic possibilities of the new technology through a wide range of innovative sound effects (O’Brien 2005: 68–​9). The debates raged on, with filmmakers such as René Clair and Charlie Chaplin positing the ideal of ‘a wordless cinema, not a soundless one’, while the possibilities of filmed theatre were defended by figures such as playwrights Marcel Pagnol and Sacha Guitry, who recognised the opportunities cinema offered them to reach wider audiences.4 Whatever the critical response, the popular success of French films parlants suggests that French audiences found a pleasure in hearing their own language spoken on the screen that extended well beyond an\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\n4\n\nScreenwriters in French cinema\n\nappreciation of the technological feat of lip-​synching. Martin Barnier’s work on multiple-​language versions of films in the early 1930s recognises that there were ‘push’ as well as ‘pull’ factors that stimulated audiences’ desire to hear their own language spoken on screen, a desire that was not limited to Francophones. For many Europeans, this desire was, at least in part, driven by the anxieties provoked by hearing an unknown language, most usually English, or rather, American (Barnier 2013). Studies of the conversion era demonstrate the popularity with audiences of the ‘new French talkies’, a popularity that was maintained throughout the decade as the market share for French films –​driven by audience demand –​grew from approximately 10 per cent throughout the 1920s to around 30 per cent during the 1930s (Crisp 1997: 9–​10).5 This hunger on the part of audiences to hear their own language on screen fuelled a demand for writers who specialised in dialogue. In France, many of those who stepped into this role already had established writing pedigrees as journalists or playwrights. While some would go on to successful careers as film directors (Pagnol, Guitry), others (for example, Marcel Achard, Henri Jeanson, Jacques Prévert) preferred to remain primarily on the writing side. One of the first training grounds for these new recruits to the production process was the Paramount-​Paris studio in St-​Maurice Joinville. The only studio that was purposely rebuilt for sound recording in the transition period, this was also the production outfit most responsible for the wave of filmed theatre that broke upon French screens in the early part of the 1930s, thus gaining a reputation for churning out large numbers of poor-​quality films. As Jeanson (1971: 164–​5) puts it in typical fashion in his memoirs: Watching a Paramount film, you would think that this company is open to all and buys any scripts on offer, from anyone. You would be wrong. […] Before crossing the threshold, you have to undertake a twenty-​minute training course in the porter’s lodge … After this, a secretary fills in a form […] that’s how I made my appearance at the Paramount court, a naturalised American.\n\nFollowing the Hollywood studio model, Paramount-​Paris employed a stable of screenwriters under contract: Jeanne Witta-​Montrobert (1980: 34), one of the most ubiquitous script ‘girls’ of the classical period, claims that there were no writers in Paris who did not at some point work for the company, which, in the early 1930s, rivalled the two major French studios, Pathé-​ Nathan and Gaumont-​Franco-​Film-​Aubert. However, by the mid-​1930s the effects of the worldwide depression led to the withdrawal of Paramount from France. Combined with the financial collapse of Gaumont and Pathé, this led to the extreme fragmentation of the French film industry during the latter part of the 1930s.6 The producer-​led system that came to dominate already existed in the early 1930s alongside these major studios, providing a pattern\n\n5\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nfor the stages of film production outside of a large studio context. Crisp (1997: 301) identifies the model outlined in manuals of the period for such small-​scale production companies, with five typical stages for the development of a script –​the synopsis, the traitement, the continuité, the continuité dialoguée and the découpage technique –​terms that are also foregrounded in a recent re-​edition of Francis Vanoye’s Scénarios modèles, modèles de scénarios (2008: 6). According to these manuals, the first three stages would concentrate on elaborating the narrative structures and characters, while the dialogue would be fully developed in the fourth stage, which would bring together the dialogue text and the scene text (Price 2010: 112 and 135). However, as Crisp (1997: 302) acknowledges, other accounts of film production in this period show that this five-​stage process was not always adhered to, and that dialogue writing, for example, might begin as early as the traitement and continue as an ‘ongoing procedure’ throughout the process ‘till shooting began (or even after)’.7 What also emerges from many of these accounts is the blurring of roles, however clearly designated they may be in the film’s credits. The simile ‘menteur comme un générique de film’ (‘as untruthful as film credits’), attributed to Prévert (d’Hugues 1994b: 445), sums up perfectly how these frequently bore little relation to the reality of who did what. Individual contributions are especially difficult to discern in terms of screenwriting, where collaborative writing and rewriting, sometimes at the behest of a producer, are common practices. Thus, many writers’ contributions –​ especially those with no official role (often wives or partners) or those who had yet to establish a reputation –​go unacknowledged. Even in the case of certain influential writers, such as Prévert and Jeanson from the 1930s to the 1950s, and Michel Audiard from the 1950s to the early 1980s, the full extent of their roles, which frequently extended beyond their credited contributions, often remains obscure. For example, star screenwriters were often involved from the initial pitch through the very earliest stages of script development, including casting decisions. Anecdotal accounts of directors (Marcel Carné, Henri Decoin), actors (Odette Joyeux, Arletty) and screenwriters (Jean Aurenche, Audiard) highlight the extent of the roles such writers played and their close links with the actors who would perform their lines. All of this underlines the role that certain writers played in shaping the overall production of the film; small wonder they were referred to as auteurs.8 Given the public demand for French-​language talkies on the one hand, and the critical contempt for ‘filmed theatre’ on the other, it was perhaps inevitable that when the role of screenwriter began to develop as a specialist category from around 1930, it did so in an atmosphere of increasing authorial antagonism with (at least some) directors. At the heart of this conflict, which continued throughout the classical period and beyond, is the conception of the role of words –​dialogue, and thus the dialogue writer –​in\n\n6\n\nScreenwriters in French cinema\n\ncinema, a subject debated at length by both directors and writers. For example, Crisp (1997: 291) cites Achard, one of Jeanson’s closest friends, who enjoyed great success in the theatre as well as in screenwriting, and who wrote in 1947:\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nFor me, film dialogue should be like the caption on a cartoon … you should aim at brevity, use short incisive phrases … The cinema has a realist vocation. You should get characters to speak as real people do, or as we believe they do.9\n\nCrisp (1997: 292) highlights the emphatic concern with brevity that occurs repeatedly in these debates: ‘those collaborating with dialoguists [are advised] to cut and cut again, as if one could castrate filmed theatre’. He goes on to cite Pierre Bost who, in a 1944 lecture to the IDHEC (Institut des hautes études cinématographiques), put his finger on the nub of the issue, the question of film authorship: ‘Films talk nowadays, and basically they [directors] regret it. They regret the silent days when they were masters of the ship’ (Crisp 1997: 292).10 This sense of nostalgia for silent cinema would re-​emerge, notably during the New Wave period. Another recurring critical issue is that of film’s relationship to the world it represents –​in both image and sound. Bost (Crisp 1997: 292), like Achard above, recognises the essential unreality of cinematic realism, a ‘transposition’ rather than a reproduction of the world, highlighting the need to stylise film dialogue ‘if it is to seem plausible, convincingly real’. The aim is not to record reality, but to fabricate a convincing illusion of it. The quest for ‘authenticity’ in dialogue would remain a major preoccupation of directors who wrote their own scripts after the New Wave (for example, Abdellatif Kechiche and Laurent Cantet), albeit with a very different understanding of what constituted authentic speech in film. Much of the anxiety surrounding ‘excessive’ wordiness derives from a desire to differentiate cinema from theatre. However, throughout the period covered by this volume, French film, especially comedy, has owed a considerable debt to theatre, drawing on the boulevard tradition, vaudeville and music hall (the caf’conc’), post-​1968 café-​théâtre, but also classical marivaudage, a linguistic comedy associated with many of Eric Rohmer’s films as well as more recent auteur screenplays, such as those of Kechiche. Further influences on screenwriters are revealed when we consider other genres that have featured in both mainstream and auteur French cinema. Melodrama, for example, also derived from theatre, can be seen from 1930s Poetic Realism to the later films of François Truffaut or Rohmer. Equally popular were historical dramas adapted from historical or contemporary fiction by, for example, Aurenche and Bost for Claude Autant-​Lara or René Clément or Jacques Natanson for Max Ophüls. The crime film, frequently adapted from popular literature in the post-​war period, inspired\n\n7\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nscreenwriters and directors of the mainstream, notably Audiard for Gilles Grangier in the late 1950s and for Georges Lautner in the 1960s, as well as cinephile New Wave directors such as Claude Chabrol, Godard and Truffaut. These genres reveal themes, tropes and figures that are both central to and challenged by French cinema from the classic to the contemporary period, namely an obsession with fatalism, the ‘ordinary’ hero and questions of (mistaken) identity. What this also shows is the complexity of film authorship in relation to influences but also, more fundamentally, in terms of who is involved in writing the screenplay. As we shall now see, this question has major implications on several levels, notably artistic recognition, legal entitlements and remuneration.\n\nThe author of the film: definitions The development of the screenwriters’ role throughout the 1930s led to questions around legal rights and remuneration (droits d’auteur). Screenwriters had enjoyed some protection since the establishment in 1917 of the Société d’auteurs, which included both screenwriters (scénaristes) and directors (metteurs en scène), and this increased further in 1918 when the names of both the screenwriter and the director started to be included in film credits. However, as we have seen, one of the constants found in all the periods covered is that credits frequently did not accurately reflect contributions: it was common for writers, and indeed directors, to find themselves in dispute with producers over questions of authorship. This issue erupted with a vengeance in the post-​war years. Among the considerable challenges facing the French film industry at this time –​post-​war reconstruction, the return of US competition, the Blum-​Byrnes agreements –​ the author question was flagged as a priority by both the newly formed Centre national pour la cinématographie (CNC) in 1944 and the equally new screenwriters’ trade union, the Syndicat des scénaristes, whose first president was Jeanson.11 And yet, it would take over a decade of wrangling before a law was passed, in March 1957, that attempted to clarify the legal status of film authors. This law listed those with a claim to co-​ authorship as follows: first, the author of the scénario; second, the author of the adaptation; third, the author of the spoken text; fourth, the author of musical compositions with or without words composed especially for the work; and fifth, the director (Jeancolas et al. 1996: 148). The strength of the screenwriters’ lobby can be seen here, with three of the five categories given to aspects of writing, while the director is named only in fifth position, after even the composer of the music. It is perhaps surprising that, in spite of the impact of the politique des auteurs and the overwhelming critical influence\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\n8\n\nScreenwriters in French cinema\n\nof auteurism in the years immediately following the passing of this law, it was not until 1985 that Jack Lang as Minister for Culture reviewed the situation to the benefit of the director as part of a set of protectionist laws (Prédal 2001: 46).12 And while it could appear that this law reversed the 1950s situation by neglecting screenwriters, we must not forget that since the New Wave, many more directors have also been credited as screenwriters of their films, giving them income from multiple roles, a trend that has been even more marked since 2000.13 A number of reports commissioned by institutions such as the CNC, the Guilde des scénaristes and even the Council of Europe over the last twenty years have addressed the development stage and the writing process and have raised the alarm about the chronic underfunding of screenwriting. In 2001, the producer Charles Gassot wrote a report for the CNC on feature film development that acknowledged the underscoring of screenwriters and made thirteen recommendations for supporting screenwriting (Gassot 2001). This report was followed by another, Le droit des auteurs dans le domaine cinématographique: coûts, recettes et transparence, commissioned by the CNC from producer René Bonnell in 2008, which looked more specifically at the rights of screenwriters as authors (Bonnell 2008). Simultaneously, public debates on the inadequate financial support for film development and protection of screenwriters’ rights were revived when the Club des 13, a group of film professionals including directors, producers and screenwriters, led by independent director Pascale Ferran, published their pamphlet, Le Cinéma du milieu n’est plus un pont mais une faille (Club des 13 2008). They identified a number of practices endangering the survival in France of mid-​ budget independent quality films, sometimes called ‘films du milieu’, and reviewed the main factors that undermine the work of screenwriters: underestimation of time needed for development; chronic underfunding; increased formatting of screenplays (2008: 43–​57).14 They also called for urgent institutional reforms of support-​ funding mechanisms for screenwriting and of the legal rights of screenwriters (2008: 291–​7). Their concerns were reinforced by other reports addressing funding for development, notably that of producer Pierre Chevalier (Chevalier et al. 2011) on the challenges of fiction screenwriting, that of Pierre Kopp (2013) on screenwriter remuneration, both commissioned by the Guilde des scénaristes, and the publication by the collective Scénaristes de cinéma associés, Scénaristes de cinéma: un autoportrait (SCA 2019).15 Kopp’s report also illustrates current screenwriting trends. Using a sample of 141 fiction films produced in France in 2010–​11, he shows that 59 per cent of these films are the product of writing partnerships between directors and screenwriters, while 32 per cent are written by the director alone and only 9 per cent by screenwriters working on their own (see Figure 0.1).\n\n9\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nFigure 0.1 Screenwriting roles: proportion of films written by director, screenwriter or both (Kopp 2013: 5).\n\nExamples of directors who normally write their films alone include Arnaud Desplechin, Olivier Assayas, Laetitia Masson, Maïwenn and Lucile Hadzihalilovic. Several chapters of this volume also refer to recent writing partnerships, such as those of Kechiche with Ghalia Lacroix, Noémie Lvovsky with Florence Seyvos, Jacques Audiard with Thomas Bidegain, Cantet with Robin Campillo, and Valeria Bruni Tedeschi with Lvovsky and Agnès de Sacy. These high-​profile auteur–​screenwriter partnerships have sometimes helped to give screenwriters more visibility, as did the development after 1990 of specific screenwriting pathways in the Fémis (Fondation Européenne pour les métiers de l’image et du son, successor of the IDHEC), which reaffirmed the distinction between screenwriting and directing as separate activities. Of course, film production and distribution has been radically transformed since 2000 by digital technology. Bonnell’s widely quoted report of 2013, Le Financement de la production et de la distribution cinématographiques à l’heure du numérique, was commissioned by the Minister of Culture and makes fifty precise recommendations for reforms required to adapt to the digital era, some of which relate directly to supporting screenwriting and authors’ remuneration and have led to some changes.16 If the post-​war period has been crucial for legally defining film authorship, the issue has also been central in critical debates. The emergence of the auteur-​director and the questioning of the screenwriter’s work developed throughout the 1950s as part of a clear editorial line of the Cahiers du\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\n10\n\nScreenwriters in French cinema\n\ncinéma in the writing of critics such as Chabrol, Godard, Jacques Rivette, Rohmer (signing as Maurice Schérer) and Truffaut. Their influence was felt not just in their writings for other cinema reviews such as Arts and L’Ecran français, but also in the adoption of a similarly auteurist line by rival publications, notably Positif. This frequently antagonistic and aggressive critical discourse gradually fashioned the politique des auteurs, according to which films were valued according to the director’s stylistic signature.17 This strategic editorial line –​these critics had ambitions to break into an industry that was in many ways a closed shop at this time –​relied on a cumulative process of promoting certain directors as film auteurs (Roberto Rossellini, Jean Renoir, John Ford, Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock). At the same time, these critics systematically attacked the tradition of quality, a type of filmmaking in which, they claimed, screenwriting, decors and stars prevailed over style (Mary 2006: 15). The new generation of critics put the blame for this firmly on established screenwriters of the post-​war period, citing a deficit of inventiveness in screenplays. They targeted above all Aurenche and Bost, Jeanson, and Jacques Sigurd, screenwriters who worked with a handful of high-​profile directors such as Yves Allégret, Autant-​Lara, Clément and Jean Delannoy, and to produce lavish mainstream literary adaptations dismissed by Truffaut (2009: 40–​1) in 1954 as ‘essentially scriptwriters’ films’. The founding article of this politique is generally agreed to be Alexandre Astruc’s 1948 evocation of the ‘caméra-​stylo’ [camera-​pen], in which he accuses screenwriters of ‘making idiotic transformations’ when adapting literary works, ‘lacking imagination’ and showing ‘laziness’. For Astruc (2009: 32–​3), cinema was being reduced to a show of images for their own sake or at the service of a narrative, when it should be seen as a means of expression ‘as flexible and as subtle as written language’. He identifies the main challenge for cinema as being ‘how to express thoughts’, and sees the medium’s potential to produce ‘the most philosophical meditations on human production’. To achieve this potential, the screenwriter and the director should be the same person, or rather, the former should cease to exist as a separate category if film direction is to be ‘seen as a true act of writing’: After having been successfully a fairground attraction, an amusement analogous to boulevard theatre, or a means of preserving the images of an era, [cinema] is gradually becoming a language […] a form in which and by which an artist can express his thoughts, however abstract they may be, or translate his obsessions exactly as he does in the contemporary essay or novel. That is why I would like to call this new age of cinema the age of the caméra-​stylo. (Astruc 2009: 31–​2)\n\nThe notion of the caméra-​stylo was a first step towards merging the writing and the directing roles into one. Truffaut further develops Astruc’s ideas on\n\n11\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nthe role of screenwriting in ‘A certain tendency in French cinema’, published in Cahiers du cinéma in January 1954, a scathing personal attack on a few screenwriters, most prominently Aurenche and Bost.18 This assault on the canon of psychological realism and its star screenwriters does not so much reject the screenplay as urge the profession to redefine its function, namely as a tool for the director in the preparation of mise en scene. Truffaut’s complaint centres on what he regards as overly influential screenwriters: I referred earlier to ‘scriptwriters’ films’ and Aurenche and Bost would certainly not contradict me. When they hand in their script, the film has already been made: in their view the metteur-​en-​scène is the person who decides on the framing … and unfortunately that is true. (Truffaut 2009: 54)\n\nAs we see when we examine the practice of Aurenche and Bost and other screenwriters dismissed in this way by Truffaut, the picture painted by the critic is far from the whole truth.19 In fact, the archives reveal a writing process involving screenwriters, the director, occasionally assistant directors, and frequently also the producer in a collaboration that is not always harmonious, sometimes beginning many years before a film eventually goes into production, and often lasting right through to the editing stage. And yet, the romantic ideal of the auteur-​director, developed and refined in numerous articles, discussions and reviews throughout this period, and further fed by the myth of the New Wave throughout the 1960s, fired the critical imagination such that its influence would be widespread and long-​lasting. This influence can be seen in the general press as well as in scholarly trends. Prior to the 1960s, film reviews in the general press systematically included a paragraph addressing the quality of the screenplay and the dialogue as well as the acting, and the mise en scene. Gradually, though, screenplays and screenwriters were overlooked in favour of greater emphasis on the director. The overwhelming critical focus on directors as auteurs not only had a devastating effect on the reputation of screenwriters, making them more vulnerable, especially when it came to the remuneration of their work as professional writers, it also undermined the critical recognition of other key contributors to film production: set designers, cinematographers, costume designers, producers and even actors. Screenwriters, then, have certainly suffered in terms of their prestige from the New Wave orthodoxy of the auteur-​director, but they did not disappear from the film industry –​far from it. As recent histories have emphasised, mainstream –​and popular –​film production continued alongside the New Wave and beyond. This not only ensured that established screenwriters, including Aurenche and Bost, Jeanson and Spaak, could continue writing well into the 1960s, but also that new writers could emerge. The new star of le cinéma du samedi soir, Michel Audiard, was unrivalled in the\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\n12\n\nScreenwriters in French cinema\n\nprofession in the 1960s and 1970s. Other screenwriters, mostly of comedies and escapist adventure entertainment, were also arriving on the scene, such as Gérard Oury, who wrote and directed the successful Louis de Funès-​ Bourvil comedies (for example, Le Corniaud/​The Sucker, 1965; La Grande Vadrouille/​Don’t Look Back … We’re Being Shot At!, 1966), and Francis Veber, who enjoyed repeated success on stage and screen with his recurring character François Pignon. This established a co-​existence of mainstream, genre-driven screenwriting trends producing record box-​office hits and popular classics on the one hand, and critically visible but less profitable auteur films on the other. Screenwriters flourished in both auteur and popular cinema. Jean Gruault, Suzanne Schiffman, Paul Gégauff and many others emerged and thrived in collaborative partnerships, in many cases with New Wave directors (Alain Resnais, Rivette, Truffaut, Chabrol). In the meantime, Oury and Veber paved the way for a new generation of comedy writers coming from the world of café-​théâtre and live performance in the late 1970s, for example Bertrand Blier, Coline Serreau, Jean-​Marie Poiré, Josiane Balasko and Michel Blanc, who would become prolific screenwriting directors of the 1980s. This decade is frequently characterised on the one hand by a spectacular cinema exemplified by the youth-​oriented films of Luc Besson and lavish heritage productions of Claude Berri, and on the other by the more personal films of a new generation of auteur-​directors such as Claire Denis, Léos Carax, André Téchiné and Assayas. Such accounts tend to identify the period with increased differentiation between auteur and mainstream cinema, but do not often foreground screenwriting, unless in terms of its shortcomings in the films associated with the cinéma du look. However, the 1980s also marked the confirmation of the popular auteur, a category that emerged in the 1970s, at least in part in reaction to the New Wave, and that includes auteur-​directors as well as screenwriter–​director partnerships. Examples include Claude Sautet working with Jean-​Loup Dabadie, Bertrand Tavernier with Aurenche or Colo Tavernier, and Patrice Leconte with Rémy Waterhouse, Jérôme Tonnerre or Gilles Taurand. These directors placed a great emphasis on screenwriting and screenwriters, returning to a more traditional-​style partnership, and arguably rehabilitating the specialist role of screenwriter. And this role is not confined to mainstream films: major figures of auteur cinema since the 1980s are also known for long-​term collaborations with writing partners, for example Denis with Jean-​ Pol Fargeau, and François Ozon with Marina de Van or Emmanuelle Bernheim. So, if one enduring legacy of the New Wave has been to establish a separation between auteur and mainstream cinemas, leading to a polarisation that has consequences for screenwriting practices (Club des 13 2008: 12), what this brief account shows is that, in fact, the distinctions between these\n\n31\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\ncategories are far from hermetic. The boundaries between popular and auteur cinema are blurred, but so are those between the functions of acting, writing and directing, with individuals moving between different roles and cinematic styles. Resnais, Chabrol and Truffaut, for example, may have laid the foundations for the politique des auteurs, but their later careers in particular are characterised by ‘quality’ films made in collaboration with screenwriters (Agnès Jaoui and Jean-​ Pierre Bacri for Resnais; Caroline Eliacheff and Odile Barski for Chabrol; Schiffman, Gruault and Jean Aurel for Truffaut). And prominent actors-​ turned-​ screenwriter-​ directors are prominent in mainstream film (the Splendid troupe, for example) as well as in low-​budget independent auteur films (Kechiche, Cantet, Bruni Tedeschi, Lvovsky and Maïwenn), often collaborating with other writers. There are also anomalous figures who established their reputation primarily as screenwriters as part of their eclectic artistic careers, including high-​profile writers who defy any categorisation, partly due to their prolific and versatile output. The most obvious example is Jean-​Claude Carrière –​ a transnational screenwriting giant with around 150 film credits to his name across French, German and US cinema, whose career has straddled both auteur and mainstream cinema –​but we could also cite Jean Cocteau, Marguerite Duras or Jorge Semprún, writers and cineastes whose artistic practice refuses to recognise boundaries between cinema and literature.20 Another noticeable shift since the New Wave is the perception of screenwriting as a stepping stone to directing. During the classical period, few screenwriters made the move to directing (notable exceptions are Henri-​ Georges Clouzot, Pagnol and André Cayatte); the more usual route was via an assistant director role. The weakening of the trade unions and the establishment of funding structures that enable successful writers to access support for directing have opened up the industry, and screenwriting has become a major route into directing. Pascal Bonitzer, Jaoui, Ferran, Campillo and Bidegain are just a few of those who have followed this career path. Screenwriters’ roles and their profile, then, have varied considerably in the French context (as elsewhere) according to the period and to the industrial and aesthetic contexts; unsurprisingly, given the contingent nature of filmmaking, they are still not clearly defined today. There are a number of underlying patterns in this variation that we highlight in the various chapters. Perhaps the clearest of these is how screenwriters move between a position of authorial power and one of a lack of visibility. As Carrière put it when accepting his honorary Oscar in 2014, ‘very often screenwriters are forgotten, or ignored. They are like shadows passing through the history of cinema. Their names do not appear in the reviews; very seldom. But still, they are filmmakers’.21 This issue of (in)visibility also presents a major challenge for research into screenwriters and screenwriting, and especially\n\n14\n\nScreenwriters in French cinema\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nfor a project that covers such a long period of time. This challenge is bound up with shifting roles, discourses and even terminology around writing for the cinema and, indeed, with the status of the screenplay as an object. We have therefore drawn on a number of key studies in the field to help define our terms and identify central discourses and debates, which we now outline.\n\nScreenwriting: definitions and discourses Pier Paolo Pasolini (2005: 187) famously articulated the screenplay as ‘a structure that wants to be another structure’. Drawing on this, Vanoye (2008: 11) highlights the transitional nature of the screenplay: neither literature nor cinema, it has an essentially practical function and is created not to last, but to become something else.22 For Vanoye (2008: 5–​6 and 11), this transitional nature is what prevents the screenplay from being seen as a worthy object of critical attention: ‘unstable and floating’, ‘a bad object due to its transitory nature, its lack of future’. Smith (2004: 204) suggests that –​ at least as far as critical discourse is concerned –​the transitional nature of the screenplay extends to its authors, and she identifies this as a key problem for recognition of the profession. Gabrielle Tremblay (2015: 12–​15) also focuses on the problem of institutional recognition of both writers and screenplays. She argues that the reluctance to recognise the latter as literary texts is grounded in the view that they are primarily utilitarian, and proposes moving away from this focus on the screenplay as an essentially unstable and transitory object, in order to focus on screenwriting as a process of constant development (2015: 46–​7). Other recent studies (for example, Maras 2009; Price 2010; Nelmes 2011) embrace this transitional status in order to theorise the screenplay both as an object and in terms of its function. This emphasis on the transitional, functional nature of the screenplay designates it as belonging to the realm of film practice, separated –​indeed, excluded –​from a parallel realm of discourse to which film criticism and film theory belongs. However, some scholars and practitioners (Chion 2007; Maras 2009: vii) argue that screenwriting belongs to both practice and discourse, and thus potentially offers a unique perspective on the filmmaking process. For example, Steven Maras (2009: 12) argues that ‘screenwriting is a practice of writing, but it is also a discourse that constructs or imagines the process of writing in particular ways’. He calls for a wider understanding of screenwriting that would break down the binary understanding of ‘proper’ (screenplay-​based) and ‘alternative’ approaches that has arguably fed the polemic around screenwriting and authorship (Maras 2009: 5–​6). He frames the screenplay’s transitional\n\n51\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nnature positively, considering it as an ‘intermediate entity […] destined to vanish into the film … transitional and transformational’ (Maras 2009: 6). Thus, ‘the screenplay’ is a term that encompasses a process of multiple iterations, revisions and amendments, and that facilitates the transformation from initial idea to film. Maras (2009: 42–​3) rightly emphasises that the ‘writing’ process involves conversations, collaborations and the elaboration of a whole variety of written screenplays, but also rehearsals and performance, mise en scene, filming and editing. He thus acknowledges and challenges the dominant idea of the screenplay as a ‘blueprint’ that somehow stands above the production process, rather than evolving as an integral part of it. Our study considers a range of screenwriting practices that lie at the heart of the filmmaking process, some of which emerge from individual approaches (Prévert’s ‘illuminated’ character plans and on-​set improvisation of dialogue; Spaak’s establishment of the milieu and characters preliminary to the narrative; Audiard’s use of overheard phrases; Kechiche’s intensive rehearsals with actors), while others are imposed by industrial or political structures (for example, the preparation of a continuity script for submission to the pre-​censorship committee or to a funding body). Maras’s study is very useful for conceptualising different screenwriting practices and how these have evolved over time. Likewise, Steven Price (2010) examines the screenplay in terms of its possible functions within the filmmaking process, addressing various different types and stages of writing, as well as specific conventions of the (Hollywood) screenplay (for example, at the most basic level, the separation of scene text, presented on the left of the page, and the dialogue text on the right). Vanoye’s French perspective (1979), on the other hand, approaches screenwriting from a more narratological angle, analysing different modes of narration in both film and written texts. In a later consideration of the screenplay first published in 1991, Vanoye (2008) builds on these modes to establish the idea of a screenplay dispositif, which could be defined as a set of principles for organising screenwriting strategies and a pragmatic modus operandum that allows the deconstruction of screenwriting devices. It involves narrative features, dramatic elements orchestrating audience emotions and sequential features organising the scene order (Vanoye 2008: 63), which are relevant to our discussion of innovative screenwriting strategies set up by several screenwriters featured in this volume for engaging with dialogue creation and authenticity.23 Dialogue is, of course, a key part of the screenwriter’s role; we have seen how the French industry very quickly separated off the function of dialogue writing and how those who specialised in this area quickly became the best-​ known writers, thanks to the direct impact of their work on audiences.\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\n16\n\nScreenwriters in French cinema\n\nNumerous studies address film dialogue from different perspectives. Jean Samouillan (2004) analyses dialogue in terms of both function and style, as does Sarah Kozloff (2000), who also theorises cinematic language in relation to cultural expectations around performance, genre and cinematic style, as well as broader issues such as gender and ethnicity. In addition, Kozloff considers the psychoanalytic dimension of screen dialogue, and the connection it establishes between screen and audience. This connection is also addressed by Michel Chion (1999) in his analysis of the voice in cinema, which we draw on in our considerations of the performance of dialogue. In Le Complexe de Cyrano, Chion (2008) focuses on dialogue in French cinema, examining the dialogue of specific films in relation to linguistic, social and cultural peculiarities. He also addresses the parallel but opposing tendencies of French cinema’s relationship to language: on the one hand, minimalist to the point of terseness; on the other, excessively verbose. These studies all argue strongly for a need to pay attention to this neglected aspect of film writing. In this volume, we make the case for considering dialogue as an integral part of the cinematic experience, from the verbal panache of Jeanson and Audiard to the muted speech of Spaak and Jean Grémillon’s early sound collaborations, and from the quasi-​literary scripted dialogue of Rohmer to the experimental dialogue dispositifs of Cantet or Kechiche. As scholarship on screenwriting has demonstrated, one of the main challenges in researching this field is to define the terminology so as to avoid confusion between the wide range of roles and concepts involved. These might range from pitching an idea to dialogue writing, from elaborating an original idea to adapting an existing text, from ‘writing in the camera’ or on the screen (Maras 2009: 2) to detailed plotting and storyboarding, and from initiating a film to trouble-​shooting on set.24 The terms used by film professionals and in the critical media are often ambiguous or imprecise. Furthermore, as Price (2013: 10–​17) points out, both the terms and their meanings have evolved since the days of early cinema, from the early ‘photoplay’ via ‘scenario’ or ‘treatment’ to today’s ‘screenplay’ or ‘shooting script’. Indeed the term ‘screenplay’ has shifted its meaning from referring to the films themselves in the 1910s and 1920s (screen plays) to the written text, from the 1940s onwards.25 The abundance of terms and their arbitrary use have required us to make choices for the sake of consistency. In this book, we use ‘screenplay’ as the general term, while ‘script’ is reserved for specific contexts, for example in compound words such as continuity script or shooting script. The very general French term ‘scénario’ is avoided in this book (unless we are referring to specific archive nomenclature) to avoid ambiguity with English, in which ‘scenario’ more usually refers to a situation. With regard to the writers themselves, we use the general term ‘screenwriter’ to refer to those involved at any stage or in any aspect of the writing process. More specific activities are\n\n71\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nidentified appropriately: ‘adaptor’, ‘dialogue writer’, ‘screenplay consultant’ and so on. We have tried throughout to distinguish between the potentially slippery terms author, auteur, writer-​director and screenwriter. The question of film authorship was a vexed one long before the debates occasioned by the politique des auteurs, as Jean-​Pierre Jeancolas et al. (1996) have outlined. Generally speaking, though, before the mid-​1950s, ‘les auteurs’ –​usually in the plural –​was used to refer to the screenwriters, and would occasionally include a director who had taken a hand in the writing. We recognise the contentiousness of this terminology, but in order to avoid confusion we use ‘auteur’ in the post-​New Wave sense of directors who may or may not work with screenwriters, but are regarded as stamping their worldview on their œuvre, while we refer specifically to filmmakers who both write and direct their films as auteur-​directors or writing directors. We employ the English term ‘author’ to refer to writers; those whose work is adapted for the screen as well as screenwriters or dialogue writers. This existing scholarship has been fundamental for us in setting out our approach, but also in defining and affirming our object of study. Following studies such as those of Andrew Spicer (2007) and Jill Nelmes (2014) on British screenwriters, Anubha Yadav (2010) on the history of screenwriting practices in Hindi cinema, and Lizzie Francke (1994) and Marsha Macreadie (1994) on women writers in Hollywood, this book traces the evolution of screenwriting in France by looking at major figures and their work. While there have been some publications in France on the subject of French screenwriters, these have tended to offer reminiscences and anecdotal accounts from those involved in the industry (SACD 1994; Ferrari 2006). A small number of historical analyses have focused on screenwriting in the French context (Raynauld 1990; 1997; Prédal 1994a), and there is also a growing body of work addressing individual writers, such as René Prédal (1994b) on Carrière, Jacqueline Van Nypelseer (1991; 1993) on Spaak, and André Heinrich (Prévert 1990; 1995), Arnaud Laster and Daniele Gasiglia-​ Laster (Prévert 1992) and Carole Aurouet (2003; 2012a; 2017), for example, on Prévert. Most recently, Brangé and Jeannelle (2019) have addressed the question of why screenplays –​these transitional objects –​have nonetheless attracted readers since the earliest days of cinema. However, there are, to our knowledge, no major studies in English addressing French screenwriters and their practice. We aim to complement studies such as, on the one hand, Price’s historical study of the screenplay (2013), which is largely Hollywood-​ based, with only two chapters addressing European screenwriting in the silent and sound eras, and on the other, Raynauld’s analysis of screenwriting in France (1990), which focuses on two key moments, the 1910s and the 1960s. We draw on both the French and the Anglo-​American traditions of film studies in order to contextualise these screenwriters and their place in\n\n18\n\nScreenwriters in French cinema\n\nthe professional sphere in relation to their own periods and also, by placing them in relation to one another, to consider their role in the development of the practice of writing for cinema.\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nMethodology As what precedes suggests, those who attempt to conduct research into screenwriters or screenwriting will soon find themselves confronted with a number of methodological challenges –​which at times can seem insurmountable –​posed by the nature of the writing process. First, this process, which is far from uniform, is difficult to pin down even in relation to individual film projects, because it is cumulative, progressing through many stages; contingent, influenced by many outside factors; and, in most cases, collective, involving more than one contributor. All stages of writing, from initial concept to adaptation, plot construction and dialogue writing, can be complicated by further multiple stages of rewriting by different people (for example, script doctors or consultants, as testified by Spaak, Audiard and Veber).26 This vagueness can work in both directions, with screenwriters often working uncredited as part of a team or to revise an existing screenplay, but also at times refusing to acknowledge their work. Screen credits, as we have seen, cannot be relied upon to provide the full picture of the production process. This problem of uncredited contributors is a serious one for screenwriting research, especially since it clearly affects certain groups more than others. For example, our research has uncovered many references to women who clearly contributed to screenplays although they were rarely, if ever, credited. These include Claude Marcy, a writer, actor and singer who was married first to Spaak and later to Jeanson, Ghislaine Autant-​Lara (née Auboin), assistant director, writer and occasional actor, and numerous other women with official or unofficial roles in the production process (script ‘girls’ such as Witta-​Montrobert, Suzanne Durrenberger and Françoise Giroud; wives and partners of directors or screenwriters).27 While this volume makes reference to a range of landmark women screenwriters from the New Wave onwards –​Agnès Varda, Schiffman, Serreau, Balasko, Lvovsky, Bruni Tedeschi, Maïwenn –​we have not been able to devote much space to women’s crucial role in the French film industry (see Vanderschelden 2012b, 2015b, 2016d; Nelmes and Selbo 2015). Had we had more space and time, we would have wished to include a chapter on the largely overlooked contribution of women to screenwriting in the classical period: those such as Colette, Solange Busso/Térac, Giroud, Colette Audry, Louise de Vilmorin and Annette Wademant who were recorded in the credits, as well as those who collaborated in less officially recognised ways. However, given the\n\n91\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nchallenges outlined above, this is a major project in itself, requiring painstaking archival research and triangulation of sources that need to be read between the lines. We hope that this can be rectified in future research; in the meantime, we would point readers to the groundbreaking Women Screenwriters: An International Guide (Nelmes and Selbo 2015), which includes many of the women listed in this introduction. Turning to the archives is one way in which we can explore further the collaborative relationships involved in film production and in the screenwriting process. Unfortunately, while archives are often available for classic and canonical films, they are usually much more difficult to find for mainstream films and, in particular, comedies. What do tend to be available for such productions are published screenplays –​often associated with the marketing of the films –​but these do not, of course, provide evidence of the process of development.28 Even when archives are available, such research is beset with its own methodological difficulties and challenges. In her consideration of Jacques Derrida’s Archive Fever, Carolyn Steedman (2001: 1175) reflects on the nature of the archive and of archival research, pointing out that ‘[a]‌rchives hold no origins […] Rather they hold everything in medias res, the account caught halfway through, most of it missing with no end ever in sight’. This is emphatically the case for screenwriting archives, which are always selective, even in the case of a remarkably complete collection such as that of Autant-​Lara, held at the Cinémathèque suisse in Lausanne. In spite of this selectivity, as Steedman (2001: 1176) argues, the archive confers authority on the historian in two ways: first, through the ‘fiction’ that ‘the authority comes from the documents themselves, as well as the historian’s obeisance to the limits they impose on any account that employs them’; but second, and ‘really’, ‘it comes from having been there’. This is doubly problematic: first, because of the object fetishisation that implies an idea of ‘truth’ or ‘origin’, even though we know that such objects are in need of contextualisation; and second, because it is a rare researcher who can claim to have seen and analysed every relevant document, given time and financial constraints. Hence, there is always a certain arbitrariness to what can be taken into account, and this book has been no exception. We have therefore deployed our archival research selectively. Where extensive consultation of archives has already been made by other researchers (e.g. Gasiglia-​Laster and Aurouet for Prévert; Carole Le Berre for Truffaut; Kelly Conway and Rebecca DeRoo for Varda), we have not repeated this. In other cases (Jeanson, Aurenche and Bost) we have drawn on selected archival material –​correspondence as well as screenplays –​while recognising that a genetic approach is not the only one possible for evaluating the overall contribution of screenwriters. We adopt a range of methodologies across our different case studies to permit us to analyse writers’ contributions both\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\n20\n\nScreenwriters in French cinema\n\ntextually and contextually, with a view to situating them within an industrial as well as an artistic framework. Perhaps the most fundamental difficulty we encountered, though, given the scope of this study, was in choosing which screenwriters to include. Inevitably, there are major –​even monumental –​figures of French screenwriting whom we have not been able to discuss, such as Bonitzer, Carrière, Jacques and Nina Companéez, Dabadie, Duras, Nicole Garcia, Giroud, Pierre Laroche, Serreau, Danièle Thompson, René Wheeler and many, many others. Although, inevitably, there has been some level of arbitrariness in our choices, resulting from the accessibility of archives and other sources and also, no doubt, personal preferences, we have made our selection according to three main criteria. First, given our focus on French specificities, we have prioritised screenwriters who have principally made their career within the French film industry, and predominantly in mainstream narrative fiction. Second, all of our chosen authors have been particularly influential in shaping practices or discourses around screenwriting, and in establishing or questioning canons. Each of them allows us to explore a particular facet of screenwriting practice. Finally, we wanted to ensure our case studies included examples of those whose primary contribution remained in the domain of screenwriting throughout their career, while recognising that –​especially since the 1970s –​screenwriting is a major route to directing, including for many who might not be obviously regarded as auteurs-​directors. Of course, focusing on individual writers is just one way of looking into screenwriting practices. We could have chosen to structure this volume around particular films, historical moments or key debates. By focusing on the writers, we are not attempting to follow an auteurist approach, substituting the screenwriter for the director as sole creative force in the development of a film. However, we do wish to acknowledge the influence of individuals who have tended to be sidelined in critical discussion. The writers we focus on in this volume are also influential within the film industry, as journalists, trade unionists, directors, critics, producers or actors, in addition to their writing. Investigating their activities, personalities, polemics and key contributions has offered us a different perspective from which to approach the importance of the relationships –​collaborations, but also confrontations –​that shape films just as much as writing, mise en scene, cinematography or editing do.\n\nResearch questions and chapter outline Our research questions have grown out of observations made during previous research projects into stars, film production and financing, genres,\n\n12\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\ncritical reception and analysis of the film press.29 These studies, which focus mainly on the contemporary period and the post-​war years, reveal very different critical attitudes to screenwriters in the immediate post-​war years and the contemporary period, suggesting a major change in the critical conception of the screenwriting role. Our first research question, therefore, asks what the various roles of screenwriters have been in the filmmaking process as adaptors, scénaristes (screenwriters) and dialogue writers, and how this has changed from the conversion to sound to the contemporary period. Second, we examine screenwriting practices that have emerged at different periods, and how they have shaped and been shaped by genre conventions, narrative preoccupations and aesthetics of French cinema. Third, we consider the role of dialogue and language, largely ignored in critical discourse on French cinema, with a couple of notable exceptions (Chion 2008; Vincendeau 2011). We reflect on the tension between word and image –​or, as André Gaudreault (2008) puts it, between ‘telling and showing’ –​that emerges in the very early days of sound film with the opposition not just between the film muet and the critically despised film parlant, but also in the distinction drawn between the latter and the more positively regarded film sonore. As Chion (2008: 7) points out, this tension persists in two parallel ‘traditions’ of French cinema; on the one hand, foregrounding spectacular dialogue, and on the other, featuring laconic, even tight-​lipped performances rooted in physicality. Fourth, we ask how screenwriting practices have evolved within a shifting industrial context since the coming of sound, with important institutional and technological changes (subsidies, authors’ rights, technical advances allowing more freedom and independence, from the introduction of lightweight cameras and fast film stock in the late 1950s to the digital revolution of the 1990s–​2000s). Throughout the study, certain fils rouges have guided us: the question of the screenwriter’s craft or method, and the way in which this may have shaped production practices; and the issue of the screenwriters’ visibility, which goes hand in hand with their legal and financial status, but also with their critical demise and rehabilitation. In addition, in our research we have encountered certain well-​known mythologies that have developed around the French film industry, largely in an effort to distinguish it from the ‘factories’ of Hollywood. France has thus developed its own cinematic mythologies, which operate on two levels: those that are established within the fictions, thanks to recurring characters, themes and preoccupations, many of which are developed by the screenwriters discussed in this volume; and those that exist around the making of those fictions, around the stars who come to embody those characters, certain directors canonised as auteurs, but also the mode of film production. In contrast to the streamlined production of the United States, French cinema\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\n22\n\nScreenwriters in French cinema\n\nis characterised as artisanal, ad hoc, a cinema of pals, almost always in crisis, and managing to produce films in spite of the ‘system’ (producers, censorship, the CNC, funding structures) rather than because of it. In this volume, we address and question the myths that have emerged around certain writers in critical discourses, as well as the narrative mythologies that the writers helped to shape in their films: from fatalism and the working-​ class (anti)hero to the small-​minded petit bourgeois; from the neurotic protagonist to the naive fool of comedy. We have arranged our chapters in largely chronological order to enable the reader to trace the evolution of the screenwriting role across the period covered (though there are, inevitably, some overlaps). The first chapter focuses on Spaak, described as the ‘dramaturge’ of classic French cinema, and considers the connection between screenwriting, genre and myth. We explore the narrative myths that are put in place at this moment when the classic French cinema is establishing itself and the role of this Belgian writer in developing them. The second chapter turns to Prévert, the ‘poet’ to Spaak’s dramaturge (Billard 1995: 256). Prévert is possibly the best-​known French screenwriter, and although his cinematic career was briefer than those of some of his contemporaries (Spaak, Jeanson, Aurenche), his association with Carné and the Poetic Realist classics of the 1930s is very well documented. He has frequently been characterised as the auteur of his films, but he was reluctant to assume this role, emphasising the importance of collaborations (with directors, actors, designers and composers). Prévert offers a rare example of a screenwriter-​myth, one who has been somewhat recuperated into the mainstream thanks to the success of his films and his poetry, in spite of the fact that his popular stance was always an oppositional one. The third chapter, which looks at Jeanson, shifts the focus to dialogue, and considers the relationship between screenwriter and actor. Jeanson is generally associated by critics with the bon mot, the witticism that bears the mark of its author much more than the character who delivers the line. And yet his dialogue is indelibly associated with some of the major stars of this period: Arletty, Jean Gabin, Martine Carol and, of course, Louis Jouvet. In this chapter, therefore, we focus on the mise en scene of dialogue, arguing that, in performance, language is an integral part of the cinematic experience, one that establishes a relation between the audience, actors and writer. The fourth chapter turns to questions of adaptation, especially literary adaptation. Taking as our focus the duo Aurenche and Bost, the most notorious screenwriters of the so-​called tradition of quality, we draw on archival material to consider their most fruitful professional relationship, with the director Autant-​Lara, and, in particular, their post-​war hit Le Diable au corps/​The Devil in the Flesh (1947). We look in detail at questions of adaptation, narrative structure and focalisation, key points of\n\n32\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nattack for the young critics of the Cahiers du cinéma in their denunciation of the cinéma de papa. Chapter 5, which covers the rejection of the tradition of quality of the 1950s and the development of the politique des auteurs, especially in the Cahiers du cinéma, acts as a transition between the ‘golden age’ of screenwriters and the emergence of the director-​as-​auteur and the New Wave. We consider three emblematic examples of auteur-​ directors who reclaimed authority over the writing stages as a way of staking their claim to the authorship of their early films: Truffaut with Les Quatre Cents Coups/​ The 400 Blows (1959), Varda with La Pointe courte (1954) and Cléo de 5 à 7/​Cleo from 5 to 7 (1962), and Rohmer with Six contes moraux/​Six Moral Tales (1963–​72). We revisit this overt takeover of the development process and the explicitly declared demise of post-​war screenwriters to reassess the extent to which the auteurist trends of the 1960s broke away from previous screenwriting practices to reposition the director at the centre of a writing process focused on mise en scene. Chapter 6 looks at the career of Michel Audiard, whose filmography as screenwriter and dialogue writer spans over thirty years, and whose practice stands in opposition to the Cahiers critics and New Wave films as evidence of the continued popularity of mainstream cinéma du samedi soir. It focuses more specifically on questions around screenwriting collaboration and Audiard’s role within recurrent production teams consisting of producer, director and the actor(s) for whom he claimed to tailor his dialogue (Gabin, Lino Ventura, Bernard Blier, Jean-​Paul Belmondo). In the 1950s, Audiard formed a productive trio with Grangier and Gabin, followed in the 1960s by an even more successful partnership with producer Alain Poiré, director Lautner, and his favourite actors. This chapter thus demonstrates that, contrary to frequent assumptions, the 1960s did not see off the author-​ screenwriter as a major contributor to film production; in fact, in Audiard, the decade witnessed perhaps the most successful screenwriter ever seen in France. The dialogue that he signed for classics such as Les Tontons flingueurs/​Crooks in Clover (Lautner, 1963) has greatly contributed to these films’ cult status. The final three chapters address more recent screenwriting practices, namely tradition and innovation in comedy writing, the foregrounding of ‘nonstandard’ dialogue in realist films featuring nonprofessional actors after 2000, and the autofictional narratives of ‘réalisa(c)trices’, women directors writing and staging themselves. Focusing on comedy screenwriting, Chapter 7 discusses how, from the 1960s, popular comedy writing continued to provide carefully crafted dialogue-​driven entertainment. On the one hand, we consider the comedies influenced by the French popular theatrical tradition, written single-​handedly (and increasingly directed) by Veber from the\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\n24\n\nScreenwriters in French cinema\n\nmid-​1970s into the new millennium, such as Le Dîner de cons/​The Dinner Game (1997). On the other hand, we examine the more subversive cult comedies that emerged in the late 1970s from the café-​théâtre revival, which experimented with truly collegial writing practices and opened the way for a new generation of actors who wrote for themselves and sometimes moved to directing their own screenplays. We look at two films written for the stage and adapted for the screen by the Splendid café-​théâtre troupe, Les Bronzés/​French Fried Vacation (Leconte, 1978) and Le Père Noël est une ordure/​Father Christmas is a Jerk (Poiré, 1981) as well as Gazon maudit/​ French Twist (1995), written and directed by Balasko, who also stars in a key role. The screenwriting of both Veber and the Splendid favours situation comedy and physical performance, but in both cases dialogue also plays an important role in renewing comedy modes. Like language, film dialogue is marked historically as well as geographically. Producing dialogue that sounds realistic has been a preoccupation of certain screenwriters since the coming of sound, as we have seen above. However, shifting definitions of realism in film have led to new understandings of what constitutes credible, authentic dialogue. Since 2000, one major consideration of certain writer-​ directors has been to use language to foreground social and geographical variation. Chapter 8 looks at the projects of two independent screenwriting directors, Abdellatif Kechiche and Laurent Cantet. They both implement screenwriting (and filming) dispositifs (Vanoye 2008) that combine auteur-​director control and collaboration with nonprofessional actors in order to film young people from multicultural urban France. Finally, Chapter 9 looks at practices of writing the self, considering three women screenwriting directors who often screen themselves as the female protagonist in their films, with varying degrees of personal narrative. Among other considerations, this final chapter investigates how Noémie Lvovsky and Valeria Bruni Tedeschi have forged close collaborative writing practices, sometimes casting each other in their respective films. Their screenwriting practices also share features with Maïwenn’s more solitary approach to writing. All three women have redefined film authorship by intentionally linking screenwriting, directing and performance. We began this introduction with a quotation from Godard’s Histoire(s) du cinéma. We conclude with a reference to Le Mépris/​Contempt (Godard, 1963), which offers a depiction of a screenwriter, Paul (Michel Piccoli), employed to rewrite a screenplay of Homer’s Odyssey. Paul finds himself caught in the middle of a battle between auteur film (represented by Fritz Lang) and popular cinema (embodied by Brigitte Bardot and Jack Palance). It is doubtless no coincidence that Godard presents the screenwriter as the weak link, willing to compromise and facilitate the corruption of art in the\n\n52\n\nIntroduction\n\n25\n\nservice of profit. Our study of selected screenwriters and their work acknowledges the challenges, negotiations and compromises at the heart of the filmmaking process, but in doing so aims to shed light on a role that, as Carrière said, has for too long remained in the shadows.\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nNotes 1 Truffaut is referring specifically to Jean Aurenche and Pierre Bost here, but it is worth noting that in these debates the masculine gender dominates, in line with a general sidelining of women writers. 2 Raynauld (1997) has shown the importance of the script in the development of early silent cinema, but by the 1920s, screenwriters were no longer an important part of the film industry (see also Török 1986). 3 See Abel (1988) and Icart (1988) for a detailed account of these debates, and O’Brien (2005) for a very useful critical and comparative study of the conversion of French and US cinema to sound technology. 4 René Clair is almost invariably credited as sole writer for his own films, but he too worked with numerous collaborators, including André Cerf (Gilles 2000: 51). 5 See also Lagny et al. (1986: 19) and O’Brien (2005). 6 See Crisp (1997) and Hayward (2005) for a more detailed account of the economic and industrial structures of 1930s French cinema. 7 For example, Prévert’s illustrated character and scene outlines contain dialogue suggestions, and Aurenche and Bost’s traitements for Autant-​Lara also include indications of dialogue, some of which remain in the finished films. 8 See, for example, Carné (1989: 92–​ 3), Decoin (undated letter to Jeanson c. 1946, Correspondence 42, SACD archive), Aurenche (1993: 85), Jeanson (2000: 83–​5) and Joyeux cited in Chedaleux (2016: 127). Audiard’s input in terms of selecting books to adapt and imposing his team of actors is discussed in Chapter 6. 9 Achard’s greatest theatrical success, Jean de la lune, was adapted for cinema in 1931 by Jean Choux and Michel Simon, and again in 1949 by Achard himself. 10 See Jean-​Pierre Jeancolas et al. (1996) for a detailed account of the debates surrounding this issue. Sarah Kozloff (2000: 8) shows that this conception of dialogue is not confined to France, nor to this period; she cites, for example, David Mamet’s notion that the perfect film should have no dialogue. She also highlights the gender bias that underpins this discourse, according to which masculinity is associated with taciturn strength, while unnecessary verbiage is a feminine characteristic (2000: 11–​13). 11 The Syndicat des scénaristes, founded in 1944 by Bost, Nino Frank, and Claude Vermorel and affiliated to the powerful Conféderation générale du travail (CGT), was the first trade union in France specifically for screenwriters (Jeancolas et al. 1996: 129; 168–​9). Prior to this, screenwriters belonged to the same union as directors and technicians, but were also protected by the\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\n26\n\nScreenwriters in French cinema\n\nsuccessor of the Société d’auteurs, the Association des Auteurs de Films (AAF), whose function was primarily to protect the rights of authors, and whose membership included film writers, directors and composers. In 1948–​49, the AAF was more or less subsumed by the Société des auteurs et compositeurs dramatiques (SACD), which had been set up in 1829 to protect the rights of theatrical authors and composers. See Jeancolas et al. (1996: 126–​39) on the difficult relations between the AAF, the SACD and the various film trade unions, due to their varying definitions of the term ‘auteur’. Today, the Guilde des scénaristes, established in 2010 from a merger of the Club des auteurs and the Union générale des scénaristes, is the only trade union representing screenwriters in France. 12 Olivier Alexandre (2015: 132–​3) highlights the power of the director as auteur, with the producer as ‘talent support’, in his essay on the ecology of French cinema. 13 This is not just true for independent filmmakers and auteur films but also for more commercial cinema. For example, Luc Besson received in excess of 500 million euros in 2015, including his director’s salary for that year, but also mainly his screenwriting royalties (Le Guilcher 2016: 291). For comedy, Dany Boon and Nakache and Toledano also exemplify this lucrative cumulation of roles. 14 See Vanderschelden (2009: 245–​7) for a discussion of specific points raised by Club des 13 on the undervalued writing stage and the prospects for film du milieu production. 15 Kopp’s survey covering 561 screenwriting contracts for 242 films produced between 2010 and 2011 (half the number of films produced in France in these two years) shows that, on average, the writing accounts for 3.3 per cent (about €230,000) of the total budget. For 50 per cent of films, it falls under 2.5 per cent (about €125,000) (Kopp 2013: 7). 16 Proposals 4 and 5 address the funding of the writing stages (Bonnell 2013: 168), while 48 to 50 suggest that authors should receive fair royalties through more transparent procedures (2013: 174). See Vanderschelden (2016b: 120–​8) for more information on the issues raised and recommendations made. 17 See de Baecque and Toubiana (2000: 97–​102) for a full definition, including the notion of ‘deliberate love [of a director] and desire to follow the body of work in the making’ and of ‘closeness and intimacy with the author’. 18 See, for example, de Baecque (1991: 99–​105) and Mary (2006: 94–​102) for full critical accounts of this key essay in French; and Hess (1974) and Caughie (1981) for critical discussions in English. 19 Indeed, Truffaut himself acknowledges this in private correspondence. See for example SACD archive, Jeanson correspondence (44), letter from Truffaut to Jeanson dated 11 April [1957] regarding the death of Max Ophüls, his film on Modigliani (that would be finished by Becker as Montparnasse 19), and the lack of obituary in the Canard enchaîné. Truffaut signs off: ‘Je suis très heureux d’avoir fait votre connaissance, d’autant que je vous sousestimais comme toujours lorsqu’on s’observe de trop loin; et puis Ophüls, qui entrait si\n\n72\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nIntroduction\n\n27\n\nbien dans l’esprit de chacun, n’avait pas son pareil pour réconcilier de vrais ou faux ennemis’ (I am very happy to have made your acquaintance, especially as I underestimated you as it is so easy to do from a distance, and of course, there is no one like Ophüls, who was so good at understanding everyone, for reconciling enemies, real or false). 20 See Prédal (1994b) on Carrière’s career, Bergomano (1985), Brossard (1985) and Günther (2002) on Duras, and Williams (2006) on Cocteau. 21 See ‘Jean-​Claude Carrière receives an honorary award at the 2014 Governor’s awards’. YouTube: www.youtube.com/​watch?v=3dOafuHB97U. Accessed 20 March 2019. 22 See also Carrière and Bonitzer (1990). 23 The writers in question are Truffaut, Varda, Rohmer, Cantet, Kechiche and Maïwenn. 24 See, for example, Jean-​ Paul Török (1986), Raynauld (1990; 2012), Chion (2007), Vanoye (2008) and Tremblay (2015) in French; Maras (2009), Price (2010; 2013) and Nelmes (2014) in English. 25 See also Maras (2009: 90–​6). 26 See, for example, Spaak (1977: 62–​ 4). Likewise, Audiard was not always credited for rewrites (Durant 2001: 425). Veber (2010: 83) was called in to rewrite the script of La Cage aux folles/​Birds of a Feather (Molinaro, 1978) and also worked on Le Grand Bleu/​The Big Blue (Besson, 1987). In addition, he appears to have rewritten Le Professionnel/​The Professional (Lautner, 1981), though only Michel and Jacques Audiard are credited alongside Lautner (Veber 2010: 150–​1). 27 Marcy helped out Jeanson during the war by lending her name to his clandestinely produced screenplays, but, as Billard (1995: 77) points out, most of her cinematic contributions were made in the wings and without credit. Ghislaine Auboin/​Autant-​Lara, wife and long-​term collaborator of Claude Autant-​Lara, received writing credits for Le Bon Dieu sans confession (1953) and Marguerite de la nuit (1955), but contracts and correspondence show she also contributed to several other films, including Le Blé en herbe (1954). When Aurenche (1993: 172) dismisses the ‘embêtant’ interference of Clément’s wife, he is referring to the journalist and screenwriter Johanna Harwood. Witta-​Montrobert’s memoirs (1980) show clearly how the role of the ‘script’ (continuity supervisor) could involve making screenplay decisions, frequently for pragmatic reasons. 28 For example, the screenplays of the Splendid comedies are packaged with the Collector edition of the DVD, while glossy illustrated screenplays of Besson’s films have been published through Intervista, a subsidiary of Besson’s production company, EuropaCorp. 29 Leahy (2002; 2007b; 2015a); Vanderschelden (2009; 2013; 2015a; 2016a; 2016b; 2016d).\n\n1\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nCharles Spaak: dramaturge and mauvais esprit\n\nCharles Spaak (1903–​75) is one of the earliest major screenwriters in French sound cinema, alongside Marcel Pagnol, Jacques Prévert and Henri Jeanson, and the first to start out by writing for the movies. He collaborated as writer on around 100 feature films in a career that spanned more than forty years, beginning in 1928 and ending in 1974, just a few months before his death in March 1975.1 Born into an eminent Brussels family, Spaak was destined to fail at the traditional family occupation of lawyer. In fact, as Janine Spaak (1977: 20) points out in her biography of her husband, few of the Spaaks went on from their studies to practise law, preferring careers in politics or literature. The former was the case for Spaak’s mother, Marie, who was Belgium’s first female senator, and elder brother, Paul-​Henri, one of Belgium’s most eminent post-​war politicians, who also served as the first president of the European Common Assembly (forerunner of the European Parliament) and secretary general of NATO. It was Spaak’s father, Paul, a lawyer by profession but a poet by vocation, who encouraged his son to pursue a career in the cinema. A ‘giant’ of French screenwriting, Spaak’s contribution is somehow less flamboyant than those of the dialogue writers Jacques Prévert and Henri Jeanson, whose bon mots uttered by the stars have entered popular cultural memory, or even of Jean Aurenche and Pierre Bost, authors of many of the high-​profile literary adaptations that characterised French quality cinema in the post-​war years. And yet, Spaak was one of the most sought after screenwriters of the classical period, described by Pierre Billard (1995: 256) as the ‘dramaturge’ of French cinema (in contrast to Prévert, the poet). He played a major role in shaping the classic French cinema, influencing the stories that were told and their recurring preoccupations. These include themes that are indelibly associated with 1930s French cinema, such as social class, fatalism, exile and nostalgia, and the construction of masculinity. In this chapter, we argue that Spaak is, in many ways, the most characteristic writer of the classic French cinema due to the extent and range of\n\n92\n\nDownloaded from manchesterhive.com © Copyright protected it is illegal to copy or distribute this document\n\nCharles Spaak\n\n29\n\nhis output. Like many screenwriters, his contributions ranged from last-​ minute script doctoring for Aux portes de Paris (Baroncelli and Barrois, 1935) for example, to adaptations of literary classics, such as Le Comte de Monte-​Cristo/​The Count of Monte Cristo (Vernay, 1943) or Thérèse Raquin (Carné, 1952), and from rehashing cinematic clichés for formulaic productions, such as Le Récif de corail/​Coral Reefs (Gleize, 1939), La "
