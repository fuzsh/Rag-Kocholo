I must confess I don’t know, just as you may not know what the French are doing in France. Now you may be wondering, “So, what is French etiquette?” Luckily, I can help with that!\n\nFrench etiquette and table manners aren’t things you can improvise. Dining etiquette, for instance, varies wildly from one country to the next, and French dining etiquette rules have the reputation of being quite rigorous.\n\nTo be fair, there are some misconceptions and many exaggerations out there about the importance of social etiquette in France. If you believe everything you read, you probably think we’re still wearing wigs and tights, and that you could go to prison for placing your fork on the wrong side of the plate.\n\nThe truth is: It all depends on what you’re doing in France and who you socialize with. French rules of etiquette are obviously not the same in the Kebab joint on the corner of the street as those at the fancy Alain Ducasse au Plaza Athénée where you can’t enter without a suit and a tie.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll simply cover the daily interactions of someone visiting or living in the country: Basic French etiquette. From French restaurant etiquette, to French etiquette rules for public transport, French business etiquette tips, or how to act in the shops. Stick with me and you’ll learn how to behave like a French gentleman with proper French etiquette in no time!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAround the Table: Etiquette in French Dining\n\nFrench Etiquette and Manners in Public Places\n\nFrench Greetings and Etiquette: Greeting People\n\nFrench Etiquette Tips When Visiting People\n\nFrench Etiquette Do’s and Don’ts for Public Transports\n\nProper French Etiquette in a Shop\n\nFrench Etiquette in Business: Conducting Business\n\nHow FrenchPod101 Can Help You Learn More French\n\n1. Around the Table: Etiquette in French Dining\n\nI’m sure you won’t be surprised to see the French dining étiquette making it first on the list. We do indeed have a lot of table rules: some of them are carefully taught by our parents, others are unspoken and wrongfully considered obvious.\n\nBut this isn’t especially a French obsession. Displaying good manners around the table matters all around the world, and France is by no means an exception.\n\nI won’t waste your time on the countless French table etiquette rules that—as subjective as they are—are more about common sense than local customs, such as:\n\nDon’t forget to compliment your host on their cooking skills, and if the food is gross, don’t be too vocal about it.\n\nDon’t splash sauce all over yourself or the tablecloth.\n\nYou should refrain from stealing the silverware or sticking your fork in anybody’s eye.\n\nNow that this is out of the way, let’s jump right into our Do’s and Don’ts around the French table!\n\nDon’t\n\nDon’t start eating or drinking before everyone is served.\n\nAs trivial as it may sound (even to me, although I was raised by these standards), this one is a big deal!\n\nIt doesn’t matter whether you’re in a burger joint or a many-stars restaurant, with friends, family, or business associates. It’s considered polite to wait until everyone is served before you start eating.\n\nAt home, you can speed up the process by serving the people around you. At the restaurant, you should wait until everyone gets their plate before you jump on yours. In a bar, you should wait until everybody’s facing a pint before raising your glass for a toast or a sip.\n\nDon’t\n\nDon’t eat with your mouth open, slurp, or produce lots of noise.\n\nIt may sound obvious to many Western cultures, but don’t take it for granted. In Japan, for instance, a country considered to have strict etiquette rules, it’s polite to slurp loudly on your Rāmen (noodle soup) to show that you’re having a good time. However, any other mouth noise is frowned upon. Confusing, right?\n\nIn France, when it comes to French etiquette at the table, you should simply refrain from producing any slurping, chewing, gargling, or burping sounds at the table, or really, in any public place.\n\nDo\n\nYou should be prepared for a lengthy meal.\n\nFrench dining is no joke. This is especially true for holidays and special occasions, such as Christmas dinner or birthday parties. But many casual meals with friends or a simple lunch with coworkers can easily escalate to a never-ending food-fest and drag on until the middle of the afternoon.\n\nFrench meals are slow to start and even slower to finish. Before you get to the starters, you may rinse your throat with the apéritif (appetizer): often a glass of wine or liquor, such as Pastis or Ricard, with some kind of snack (peanuts, smoked ham, olives, you name it). And before you’re excused from the table, there will be a LOT of talking.\n\nUnless you’re with close friends on a casual event, it’s usually considered rude to leave the table before the meal ends. Of course, if you have a reasonable excuse to do so, nobody will throw rocks at you, but it’s generally better not to be in a rush.\n\nSanté ! (“Cheers!”)\n\nOne more thing before we move on. If you’ve read any other guide about French dining etiquette, you must be wondering: But what about touching the cheese with my fingers, keeping my hands on the table, serving women first, or wiping the sauce with bread?\n\nWell… Many authors seem to be living in the 19th century and will shower you with strict instructions that only apply to high-end restaurants or a presidential dinner in Versailles. They fail to mention that most of these rules are way too uptight for a meal with friends or even a business lunch.\n\nHowever, if you’re interested in learning more about the subtleties of French dining etiquette, there’s a great number of books to pick from!\n\n→ Make sure to visit our vocabulary list about Utensils and Tableware, with audio recordings to practice your pronunciation. It’s freely available on FrenchPod101.\n\n2. French Etiquette and Manners in Public Places\n\nA lot of your time in France is likely to be spent in public places of all sorts: avenues, parks, squares, and halls. Let’s see how to behave without attracting unwanted attention or angry stares.\n\nDon’t\n\nDon’t sniffle your snot repeatedly, just blow your nose.\n\n/!\\ If you get grossed out just reading about snot, I suggest that you just skip to the next section.\n\nWhether it’s healthier to blow your nose in a tissue or to sniff hard and spit it out is still debated, and just like everything related to body fluids and germs, it’s really important to get it right when traveling abroad.\n\nIn many countries, blowing your nose is considered rude and disgusting, and there’s usually nothing wrong with sniffling as much as it takes to keep it inside.\n\nIn France, however, you’ll find that many people get irritated if you continue to sniffle your snot when you have a runny nose. And I can relate. The sound just gets on my nerves and makes me want to scream “Just blow your freaking nose already!”\n\nHowever, this doesn’t mean that you should blow your nose right at the dinner table. That would be bad etiquette.\n\nWiping your nose with a tissue is fine, but if you need more relief, just excuse yourself for a moment and find a private corner or move a few steps away and blow it quietly. Your friends will usually prefer one short blow to a sniffling concerto.\n\nElle se mouche. (“She’s blowing her nose.”)\n\nDo\n\nYou should be quiet and keep your voice down.\n\nThis is a good example of French etiquette and customs I had always taken for granted until I visited South America. Until then, I had only been in countries where it’s considered polite to speak quietly and refrain from yelling, shouting, or laughing out loud.\n\nYou can imagine the cultural shock of coming to a place where it’s perfectly acceptable to loudly express your emotions and where the noise level in the street is often much higher than in my home country. Just as it’s shocking to the French if you break this rule in their streets by being too loud.\n\nIt’s good French manners and etiquette to keep your voice down, not to a whisper, but to what we consider a reasonable level. Look around you when you’re outside, follow your friends’ lead, and you’ll get it right.\n\nDo\n\nYou can kiss and hug in public (within reason!).\n\nThe French are known for being very relaxed about public displays of affection. It’s common to see people kiss, hold hands, hug, or cuddle in the street or on the bus, and nobody will mind if you get tender with your lover in a public place. That makes it easy to practice your French kiss skills!\n\nBe careful, however: This only applies to kissing, hugging, and innocent stroking. If it gets more physical or erotic, or if there’s any nudity involved, it won’t be considered acceptable anymore (and possibly not legal, either).\n\nPublic displays of affection for same-sex couples is still a work in progress. Although the country is reasonably progressive in LGBT rights, two men or women kissing in public could still raise some eyebrows from the older or more conservative fringe of the population, especially outside of big cities.\n\nThink Green, turn off the shower!\n\n3. French Greetings and Etiquette: Greeting People\n\nWhen it comes to French etiquette, greetings in France can be a confusing or stressful experience if you’re not prepared for our typical air-kissing technique: La bise. I have covered it extensively in another article on How to Say Hi. Check it out to learn the ins and outs of this oh-so-French custom.\n\nDo\n\nYou should greet everyone when you join a group.\n\nWhen you join a group of French, it’s considered good French social etiquette to say “Hello” to everyone, and introduce yourself (simply stating your name is often enough), to whomever you haven’t met before.\n\nAt a business meeting, shake hands with everyone present when arriving and leaving. The French handshake is brief—one up and down movement—with a firm grip and eye-contact.\n\nWith friends and acquaintances, a handshake is the most popular greeting among men, and kissing on the cheek is common between women or between men and women.\n\nDon’t\n\nDon’t overuse the formal Monsieur and Madame.\n\nYou’ve probably read somewhere that the proper way to greet someone is to use Bonjour (Hello) with either Monsieur (Sir) or Madame (Madam). This is true if you want to explicitly express respect toward the other person, but with friends or coworkers of the same rank, you could sound stiff or overly formal.\n\nThere’s generally nothing wrong with using Monsieur or Madame when addressing shops’ or restaurants’ staff, but I usually find it too solemn for my taste.\n\nMademoiselle (Miss) has an old-fashioned ring to it and has lost a lot of its appeal after it started being overused in cheap pickup lines. I believe if someone is young enough to be called Mademoiselle, you don’t need to be formal and use the title. And if you want to use it with galant intentions, you’ve been warned!\n\n→ Learn more about how to greet people with our free vocabulary list on the Common Ways to Say Hello.\n\n4. French Etiquette Tips When Visiting People\n\nA person’s home is their castle, and when invited to your friend’s or colleague’s, it’s best to avoid missteps.\n\nDo\n\nYou should bring a small gift to your host.\n\nWhen invited for dinner, it’s polite to thank your host with a gift of some sort. There’s no strict rule on what you should bring, but for formal occasions, flowers or a bottle of wine are safe bets. In more casual company, wine works just as well as any liquor or delicacy (chocolates, an interesting appetizer).\n\nAmong friends, it’s common in France to make the meal a collaborative experience: someone brings the starters, others are in charge of the main, dessert, wine, appetizer, or cheese. Coordination is crucial. Double-check what you should bring so you don’t end up with a triple ration of cheese but no wine.\n\nYou don’t actually have to kneel when offering flowers to your host!\n\nDon’t\n\nDon’t be late or leave them hanging.\n\nPunctuality is highly appreciated in France, especially in business, but also among friends. When invited for dinner, it’s fine to show up slightly later than the set time. But in any other situation, you should do your best to be right on time.\n\nIf you’re running late or have to cancel, always inform your friends and don’t leave them hanging, waiting for you to show up. Even if you’re only one person among many, it’s polite to inform at least your host or the event organizer if you’re not going to make it on time, or at all.\n\n5. French Etiquette Do’s and Don’ts for Public Transports\n\nIf you’re visiting France as a tourist, there’s a good chance you’ll spend some of your time in public transports. All the rules about behavior in public places apply, but here are a few other recommendations to make everything smoothly polite.\n\nDo\n\nYou should wait in line when buying tickets or boarding.\n\nThis one actually applies to any line of people waiting for something, whether you’re waiting for your train tickets, your lunch, or your baguette. Be respectful to people around you and wait in line for your turn.\n\nIf you’re in a serious rush, you could ask them politely if they mind you taking over, but you should accept their decision if they refuse.\n\nWhen boarding your train or bus, don’t act like you’re in a barbaric mob – quietly wait in line by the doors. During rush hours, things could get messy, especially when the subway gets cramped, and some will try to take over so they don’t have to wait for the next train. But most of them will wait in a somewhat orderly line anyway.\n\nDon’t\n\nDon’t listen to your music on speakers or have loud phone conversations.\n\nRemember when I mentioned that you should stay quiet and avoid yelling or shouting? Let’s add some more transport-specific rules of savoir-vivre (good manners).\n\nIf you want a soundtrack to make your ride more entertaining, you should keep it to yourself by using headphones. Playing music on your phone’s speaker or giant boombox is considered tasteless and rude.\n\nAs for loud conversations, you’ll get a pass if you’re among friends, having a lively conversation. But when talking on the phone, you’re expected to keep your voice down as most people feel like they don’t need the details of your personal life.\n\nShhh…don’t wake them up.\n\nDo\n\nYou should give your seat to grandma.\n\nOn the city bus, tramway, or metro, where seats aren’t assigned, it’s polite and considerate to leave your seat to the elderly, pregnant women, and people with disabilities.\n\nMost public transports have priority seats dedicated to them, but you should be ready to offer them any other seat, regardless of how it’s labeled. However, you’re free to use any priority seat as long as they’re not taken. When doing so, just be extra aware of your surroundings and be ready to offer it to someone in need.\n\n→ Check out our vocabulary list on the Train or Bus Station to learn more vocabulary for your rides in public transports.\n\n6. Proper French Etiquette in a Shop\n\nDo\n\nYou should greet the staff and treat them well.\n\nTo understand how to properly interact with staff from any shop, restaurant, or administration, you have to know that France doesn’t live by the British-American rule of “The customer is always right.” In France, the client is a guest in the shop, and it’s often more important to the clerk to be treated with respect than to make the sale.\n\nIt’s hard to stress how important it is to understand this shift of power when interacting with sellers or waiters, especially when coming from the U.S. or the U.K., where client-staff interactions are handled in a wildly different manner.\n\nIn a nutshell: Politely greet them, smile, and treat them well. I’m not saying that you should be obsequious or overly submissive. Just treat them like human beings and acknowledge that they deserve respect for providing a service.\n\nDon’t\n\nDon’t bargain or discuss the prices.\n\nThis one is a no-brainer. Unless you’re buying fake Ray-Bans on a Sunday market, prices aren’t up for discussion and bargaining is just not a thing in France.\n\nIn most cases, prices are clearly displayed in shops to spare you the need to ask for them. And if you’re not happy with them, it’s more polite to walk away and compare your options than to start arguing with the employees.\n\nJean-Pierre looks like a nice guy but you don’t want to see him angry…\n\n→ For more vocabulary on this topic, have a look at our List on Shopping on FrenchPod101.\n\n7. French Etiquette in Business: Conducting Business\n\nDon’t\n\nDon’t use aggressive selling techniques.\n\nThere are many countries where it’s fine to jump on your customer as they walk through the door, or start talking numbers as soon as you start a business lunch. However, when it comes to French etiquette, business is supposed to be handled with more tact, and the French don’t respond well to this kind of behavior.\n\nWe don’t like to make hasty and impulsive decisions, especially in business. Deals are rarely finalized in the first meeting, and high-pressure sales tactics are likely not to work at all. It may even provoke enough reluctance to just ruin your efforts.\n\nDo\n\nYou should embrace criticism and interruptions.\n\nThis rule of etiquette in French business might sound a little counterintuitive, but this is what makes it so important!\n\nWhen presenting your ideas, either in a meeting or in a less formal setting, don’t get upset or frustrated if your colleagues interrupt you to ask questions or give some insight.\n\nConstructive criticism is highly regarded in France, and you should be ready to openly discuss the merits and flaws of your ideas. This is how your coworkers show their interest.\n\nJust keep your cool, you’re on the same team!\n\n→ Stop by our free vocabulary list on Business Meetings, with audio recordings to practice your pronunciation, on FrenchPod101.\n\n8.

Dates go with your signature on most official documents, and knowing how to write them will also make the booking of your train tickets a much smoother experience.\n\nLearning to write dates in French is simply an unavoidable aspect of learning the language, and it will make every aspect of your life much easier in the French-speaking world.\n\nToday, we’re going to learn how to tell or write the date, from the mythological names and numbers of the days of the week, to the years and months in French.

Without further ado, our guide on days, months, and dates in French, and every phrase you’ll need to know!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHow to Tell the Date\n\nHow to Say the Days of the Week\n\nHow to Say the Months\n\nHow to Say the Years\n\nMust-Know Phrases to Talk about Dates\n\nCelebrating Life and Wine in France!\n\nHow FrenchPod101 Can Help You Learn More French\n\n1. How to Tell the Date\n\nOnce you know the words for the days and months, telling the date in French is nothing complicated. Especially for those starting from American English, there’s just a few differences when it comes to dates in French language. Here are the most significant rules for writing dates in French to keep in mind:\n\n1- Dates in French Format: Day, Month, Year\n\nHow are dates written in French?\n\nUnlike the Month, Day, Year trinity of American dates, French starts with the day, then the month, and then the year. We write all three in a row, without commas or any other separator.\n\nFor example, here are some examples of how to write dates in French:\n\n14 juillet 1789 [French Revolution’s Bastille Day]\n\n27 décembre 1975 [Queen releases Bohemian Rhapsody]\n\nFor now, don’t worry about the translation of the months or how to pronounce the years. We’ll cover all that in a moment!\n\n2- To Le or not to Le\n\nHow to say dates in French depends on the formality of the occasion. In formal situations, giving dates in French can be done one of the following two ways:\n\nNous sommes + day of the week + le + day’s number (#) + month + year.\n\nNous sommes + le + # + month + year.\n\nFor instance, saying dates in French may look like this:\n\nNous sommes Lundi le 25 mai 1977.\n\n“It’s Monday, May 25, 1977.”\n\nNous sommes le 25 mai 1977.\n\n“It’s May 25, 1977.”\n\n[Star Wars – A New Hope hits the theaters.]\n\nIn informal situations, expressing dates in French will look like this:\n\nC’est + day of the week + le + # + month + year.\n\nOn est + day of the week + le + # + month + year.\n\nFor instance:\n\nC’est mardi le 21 décembre 2012.\n\n“We are Tuesday, December 21, 2012.”\n\nOn est mardi le 21 décembre 2012.\n\n“We are Tuesday, December 21, 2012.”\n\n[Mayan-based prophecy for the end of the world.]\n\nDatte (date fruit) not date (calendar date).\n\n3- How to Abstract from the Date\n\nThere are many ways to go about talking about dates in French. Some involve the whole set of information, as we’ve seen above, including the name of the day, number, month, and year. Others involve only one or two components, and knowing those structures will literally save the day.\n\nHere’s how to talk about the day:\n\nOn est lundi.\n\n“It is Monday.”\n\nJe vais à la piscine le mardi.\n\n“I’m going to the pool on Tuesdays.”\n\nIl va au marché tous les samedi.\n\n“He’s going to the market every Saturday.”\n\nNous sommes le 12.\n\n“It is the 12th.”\n\nNow, about the month:\n\nOn est en janvier.\n\n“It is January.”\n\nLe mois de juillet.\n\n“The month of July.”\n\nAnd finally, the year:\n\nOn est en 2019.\n\n“It is 2019.”\n\nEn l’an 2012\n\n“In the year 2012.”\n\nOr why not some combinations, using dates and years in French?\n\nNous sommes en mars 2015.\n\n“It is March 2015.”\n\nJ’ai un rendez-vous le 23 octobre.\n\n“I have an appointment on the 23rd of October.”\n\n4- How to Write the Date\n\nTo write dates in French on formal documents or letters, we use the following structure:\n\nDay of the week + le + # + month + year.\n\nExample:\n\nLundi le 15 mai 2030.\n\n“Monday, May 15, 2030.”\n\nYou can also write the date in a condensed format. It’s very similar to English, but with a twist: Once again, the order is day / month / year.\n\nIt looks like this : DD/MM/YY\n\nFor instance:\n\n05/07/96 (July 5, 1996) [Dolly the sheep is cloned.]\n\n23/04/05 (April 23, 2005) [YouTube is officially launched.]\n\nUn calendrier (a calendar)\n\n2. How to Say the Days of the Week\n\nWhen reading dates in French, you’ll have to know the names of the days of the week. Just like the months, French days don’t start with a capital letter.\n\nlundi Monday mardi Tuesday mercredi Wednesday jeudi Thursday vendredi Friday samedi Saturday dimanche Sunday\n\nAll these names come from Latin, and many from Roman mythology, and it’s not only good to know about it to impress your friends at a dinner party; it will also help you remember them!\n\nLundi (Monday) is the day of the Moon.\n\nLuna is the Latin word for “moon,” becoming lune in French, becoming lundi.\n\nIn English, “Monday” is the Moon Day, but it’s a bit more complicated than that. It derives from Old English “Mōnandæg” and Middle English “Monenday,” based on Latin dies lunae which translates to “day of the Moon.”\n\nMardi (Tuesday) is the day of the God of War.\n\nWhile the Greek God of War, Ares, was being torn apart by a vengeful Kratos, his Roman counterpart, Martius (or Mars in French) was becoming mardi.\n\nIn English, they use the Norse God of War, Tyr (or Tiw), later becoming Tiwesdaeg, and finally: “Tuesday.”\n\nMercredi (Wednesday) is the day of the Messenger God.\n\nFrom the Roman messenger God, Mercury (Mercure in French), it becomes mercredi.\n\nIn English, it comes from the Norse God, Odin the chief God of Asgard (also called Woden or Wotan), later becoming Wodnesdaeg, and then “Wednesday.”\n\nJeudi (Thursday) is the day of the God of Thunder.\n\nFrom the Roman God-in-chief Jupiter (equivalent of the Greek Zeus), it became Jeudi.\n\nIn English, the Norse God of Thunder was Thor (long before he joined the Avengers). It became Thorsdaeg and “Thursday.”\n\nVendredi (Friday) is the day of Beauty.\n\nFrom the Roman Goddess of Beauty, Venus, it became vendredi.\n\nIn English, the Norse Goddess of Marriage and the Hearth, Frigga (wife of Odin), later became Frigedaeg and then “Friday.”\n\nSamedi (Saturday) is the day of Time.\n\nBoth French and English words come from the Roman God of Time and Harvest, Saturn. While the English “Saturday” didn’t stray too far from its godly origins, the French version went a bit wild and evolved into samedi.\n\nDimanche (Sunday) is the day of the Lord.\n\nNot as sunny as the English word, but wrapped in a shroud of mystical mystery, the French dimanche comes from the Latin Dies Dominicus, which means the “Day of the Lord.”\n\nLa mythologie (Mythology)\n\n→ To learn how to pronounce the names of the days, make sure to check out our free vocabulary list on Talking about the Days on FrenchPod101.\n\n→ For the numbers of the days, stop by our vocabulary list on numbers with audio recordings.\n\n3. How to Say the Months\n\nUnlike in English, French months don’t start with a capital letter. You’ll also certainly be happy to know that they’re way easier to handle than our exceptions-riddled years. Let’s jump right in:\n\njanvier January février February mars March avril April mai May juin June juillet July août August septembre September octobre October novembre November décembre December\n\nHere are a few sentences using the names of the months:\n\nOn est en juillet.\n\n“It’s July.”\n\nL’année prochaine, il va neiger en janvier.\n\n“Next year, it will snow in January.”\n\nL’été commence fin juin et se termine fin septembre.\n\n“Summer starts at the end of June and ends at the end of September.”\n\nOn habite ensemble depuis mai 2012.\n\n“We’ve been living together since May 2012.”\n\n→ Go the extra mile with FrenchPod101 and learn how to pronounce the French months with our vocabulary list on Talking about Months.\n\n4. How to Say the Years\n\nIf you want to talk about the years and historical dates of all kinds, you’ll have to learn the numbers. There’s no way around it. Luckily, we have a comprehensive article about French Numbers that will teach you how to count from one to infinity!\n\nSure, you could just learn some key dates, such as the current one or the year of your birthday, but they’ll be much easier to remember once you know how the numbers work.\n\n1- How to Pronounce the Years\n\nYears are usually pronounced like any other big number, as follows:\n\n2019 Deux-mille-dix-neuf\n\nBut then, there’s a special case for all the years from 1100 to 1999.\n\nThese dates can be pronounced in two ways, depending on whether you’re counting the thousands or the hundreds.\n\nHere’s an example with the year 1910:\n\nThe “thousands” way: Mille-neuf-cent-dix.\n\nThis literally means “one-thousand” (mille) “nine-hundred” (neuf-cent) “ten” (dix).\n\nThe “hundreds” way: Dix-neuf-cent-dix.\n\nThis one literally means “nineteen hundred ten.” Instead of counting one-thousand and then nine-hundred, you’re counting “nineteen-hundred.”\n\nBoth forms are correct and equally accepted, but you should use the “hundreds” way only in oral communication. You always write years the “thousands” way. If you want to be safe, I recommend to always use the “thousands way,” but it’s good to know that some weird people count differently.\n\nMore examples of these two ways:\n\nDate Thousands way Hundreds way 1408 Mille-quatre-cent-huit Quatorze-cent-huit 1760 Mille-sept-cent-soixante Dix-sept-cent-soixante 1911 Mille-neuf-cent-onze Dix-neuf-cent-onze\n\nN’oublie pas la date de ton rencard. (Don’t forget the date of your date.)\n\n2- Année or An?\n\nThere are two ways to say “year” in French: Un an and Une année.\n\nThere’s no strict rule about whether you should use one or the other, but in most cases:\n\nAn is used with a specific number of years.\n\nExamples:\n\nJ’ai vingt-deux ans.\n\n“I am 22 years old.”\n\nIl y a trois ans.\n\n“Three years ago.”\n\nDans dix ans.\n\n“In ten years.”\n\nAnnée is used without numbers in many different expressions.\n\nExamples:\n\nL’année prochaine\n\n“Next year”\n\nToute l’année\n\n“All year”\n\nCela fait des années.\n\n“It has been years.”\n\nLes années 60\n\n“The sixties”\n\n5. Must-Know Phrases to Talk about Dates\n\nWe’ve seen how to assemble a French date from the day, the month, and the year. Now, it’s time to get more practical with some of the most important phrases and expressions about dates, as well as the common questions and answers.\n\n1- Le Premier\n\nIn English, all days are said using ordinal numbers, from 1st to 31st. This isn’t always the case, but for both Americans and the British, it’s the most common way to tell the date.\n\nIn French, all days use regular numbers, except for the first day of the month.\n\nLe premier mai\n\n“The first of May”\n\nLe deux mai\n\n“The second of May”\n\nLe trente-et-un mai\n\n“The thirty-first of May”\n\n2- What Day is it Today?\n\nIf you’re a time traveler or you just got out of a Game of Thrones marathon and lost track of the days, this is likely to be your first question.\n\nJust keep in mind that asking for the date in a foreign language is as tricky as asking for directions. You’ll find it easy to ask, but not to understand the answer. So, carefully learn your months, get fluent with French numbers, and you’ll do just fine!\n\n[Formal]\n\nQuelle est la date aujourd’hui ?\n\n“What is the date today?”\n\nQuel jour sommes-nous (aujourd’hui) ?\n\n“What day is it today?”\n\n[Casual]\n\nC’est quoi la date aujourd’hui ?\n\n“What is the date today?”\n\nOn est quel jour (aujourd’hui) ?\n\n“What day is it today?”\n\nNote that in form 1, the word aujourd’hui (today) is important. In most situations, the other person will get from the context that you’re asking about today, but there are some cases where you could be asking for Nicolas Cage’s birthday or about the next Hanson live concert.\n\nIn form 2, the word aujourd’hui is implied and could be omitted without creating any confusion. This is because the literal translation of this form really is: “What day are we?”\n\nCommon answers are:\n\n[Formal]\n\nNous sommes le 15 septembre.\n\n“Today is the 15th of September.”\n\n[Casual]\n\nOn est le 15 septembre.\n\n“Today is the 15th of September.”\n\nYou can also ask for more specific information, such as the day’s number or the year. Here’s how to do so:\n\n[Formal]\n\nLe combien sommes-nous aujourd’hui ?\n\n“What day is it today?”\n\nEn quelle année sommes-nous ?\n\n“What year is it now?”\n\n[Casual]\n\nOn est le combien aujourd’hui ?\n\n“What is the date today?”\n\nOn est en quelle année ?\n\n“What year is it now?”\n\nBe careful with question two. Don’t use it until you’re ready to tell your friends about your years of hardcore gaming in a bunker or your decade of solitary confinement in a Siberian prison.\n\n3- Le Prochain\n\nTo talk about the next whatever, you can use the word prochain (next). It could be the next week, month, weekend, year, decade, or century. Here’s how:\n\nLa semaine prochaine\n\n“Next week”\n\nLe mois prochain\n\n“Next month”\n\nL’année prochaine / L’an prochain\n\n“Next year”\n\nTo talk about the next days, you’ll more likely use demain (tomorrow) or après-demain (the day after tomorrow, or literally: “after-tomorrow” when translated).\n\n6. Celebrating Life and Wine in France!\n\nHow could I write about the dates without mentioning all of our yearly events and celebrations?\n\nWe have a fairly long list of holidays in France. Some are of religious origin, but lost most of their spiritual varnish and are now celebrated by everyone. Many of them have become an excuse for indulging in delicious food (nothing wrong with that!) or blind consumerism (I’m looking at you, Christmas). But celebrations such as la chandeleur (Candlemas) and its delicious Crêpes, or l’épiphanie (Epiphany), should absolutely not be missed.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the main events of the French calendar, be sure to check out our excellent article about the Must-Know French Holidays and Events in 2019.\n\nAnd for some lesser-known celebrations that will leave you happy and tipsy, stick with me for a while as we take off for the wine-growing regions of France!\n\n1- Les Vendanges\n\nThe vendange (grape harvest) is the process of harvesting grapes for the production of wine (the word doesn’t apply to the table grape). The same word is used for the grape that’s harvested during this process.\n\nL’époque des vendanges (or “The grape harvest season” in English) depends on the region, the weather conditions, and everything affecting the maturity of the grape. However, the vendanges traditionally takes place between the months of September and October (one month earlier than fifty years ago, courtesy of global warming).\n\nEntre septembre et octobre\n\n“Between September and October”\n\nThe grape can be harvested by hand or with machines. The former is the traditional method that is still used for high-quality vintage or sparkling wine, as both require a rigorous selection of grapes. It’s also used when the terrain doesn’t allow a mechanical harvest.\n\nThe latter is much faster and cheaper, but skips the selection process, mixing grapes of various levels of maturity and resulting in the final product being of lower quality.\n\nLe vignoble (The vineyard)\n\nEvery year, during les vendanges, wine-growers from all the wine regions of France hire thousands of short-term workers to help them with the manual harvest in a warm and cheerful atmosphere. It involves working eight hours a day, garden shears in hand, which is equally rewarding and exhausting, but definitely a cool way to jump on the winemaking train!\n\nContracts range from eight to fifteen days, and usually, no previous experience is required. However, it takes a good level of fitness, because the job is as physical as it gets.\n\nCheck out the official website of our national job agency: Pole-emploi. Or if you’re targeting a specific area, head to the regional page of your choosing, such as Auvergne, Rhones-Alpes or Grand-est.\n\n2- Le Beaujolais Nouveau\n\nEvery year, on the third Thursday of November, the Beaujolais nouveau (new Beaujolais) makes a big entrance. For the next few days, the French will be drinking this ruby red fruity wine with a solemn enthusiasm.\n\nLe troisième jeudi de novembre\n\n“The third Thursday of November”\n\nThe Beaujolais nouveau, or Beaujolais primeur, is produced in the vignoble du Beaujolais (Beaujolais vineyard) and can be sold right after the end of the vinification process. Thus, each year, restaurants and bars traditionally advertise the arrival of the new vintage of the beloved Beaujolais.\n\nThe new Beaujolais has arrived!\n\nThe official “launch” of the wine takes place in the town of Beaujeu, historical capital of Beaujolais, during the traditional celebrations of the Sarmentelles. There, after a procession of wheelbarrows filled with vine branches is ceremoniously set on fire, the first barrels of Beaujolais are pierced at midnight, and the rest is history.\n\n3- Wine Festivals\n\nThe Beaujolais is just one among many wine festivals throughout France. Another famous event is the Grand Tasting or Festival des grands vins (Superior Wines Festival) which takes place each year in the Louvre, where the most prestigious winemakers put on a show.\n\nCheck out The Wine Agenda from the LRVF website for more information on the numerous events and celebrations for wine-lovers in France!\n\nFestival du vin (Wine festival)\n\n7.
