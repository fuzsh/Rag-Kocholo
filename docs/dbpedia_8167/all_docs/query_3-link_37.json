Political system, civil society and institutions in Italy: The quality of democracy. Comparative European politics, 11(3). doi:10.1057/cep.2012.42\n\nItaly's economy and polity are considered to be continuously in turmoil. The recent multiplication of corruption affairs, the spreading of clientelistic practices, the internal economic crisis and the decline in the country's role on the European and international stages suggest that Italy is at a political and historical turning point. For the above stated reasons, it appears relevant to re-evaluate the state and quality of Italian democracy. On the basis of a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, this study aims to analyse the recent changes in Italian polity, economy and society in order to assess whether Italy can be considered as a 'deviant case' among European countries. In this article, we present a preliminary reflection on this research question and we outline the topics of concern that will be explored in this special issue. The first part of the article highlights the transformation of Italian democracy over the years with an emphasis on the persisting inconsistency between institutions and civil society. The second part of this article addresses the problem of the current political and economic crisis and the erosion of the democratic quality of Italian political and institutional settings. The third section addresses the question of whether Italy, in a comparative perspective, can be considered alternatively a 'backward' country in terms of democratic development, a political and institutional laboratory of future trends, an anomaly compared to other European democracies or, finally, a specific variation of common trends already characterizing other European democracies. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.\n\nRefuser de militer.

(2024). National or partisan representation: Do politicians' perceptions of the opinions of these voter groups depend on party characteristics? Acta politica.\n\nResearch shows that political parties are not equally responsive to the general public opinion and to their party voters' preferences. This study aims to explore this discrepancy in the context of politicians' perceptions of public opinion, recognising that the knowledge that politicians possess about public opinion is an important route for political representation. Are politicians better at perceiving the public opinion or their party voters' opinion? Departing from the approach of examining only one type of perception, this research investigates why some politicians have a more national-oriented pattern of perception, while others adopt a party-oriented pattern. Drawing on the literature on party responsiveness, this study develops and tests hypotheses regarding the role of party characteristics. Using survey data survey data from Belgium and Germany, the analysis reveals that, overall, party characteristics have a limited impact on MPs' perceptions of public opinion. However, a notable exception is intra-party democracy, which increases of politicians' propensity to better perceive the opinions of their own party voters compared to those of the general public.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/366792/3/partisan_national_difusion.docx\n\nPrendre parti pour la coca : de l'action collective au village à la mobilisation en faveur du MAS\n\nBusnel, R. (2023). Prendre parti pour la coca : de l'action collective au village à la mobilisation en faveur du MAS. Politix, 38(138), 201-223. doi:10.3917/pox.138.201\n\nPartant du suivi ethnographique d'une mobilisation paysanne dans le Tropique de Cochabamba (Bolivie), l'article interroge les formes d'attachement des cultivateurs de coca au Mouvement vers le socialisme (Movimiento al socialismo, MAS). En plaçant la discrétion des arrangements autour de cette culture controversée au coeur des relations entre le parti, sa branche syndicale et les populations paysannes de la région, il montre les continuités existantes entre « l'action collective au village » et les formes plus exceptionnelles de mobilisation « dans la rue ». En s'inspirant des travaux de Thomas Clay Arnold, l'article propose de conceptualiser ce continuum et l'attachement partisan qui en découle en termes d'économie morale. Celle-ci tourne autour du « bien social » de la coca, fédérant les collectivités villageoises autour du parti autant qu'il trouble leur rapport au politique et à la légalité.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/355541/3/POXBUSNEL.pdf\n\n2024\n\nComparing political participation profiles in four Western European countries\n\nROJON, S., PANKOWSKA, P. K., Vittori, D., & Paulis, E. (2024). Comparing political participation profiles in four Western European countries. European Journal of political research. doi:10.1111/1475-6765.12695\n\nAbstract Most studies of political participation have either focused on specific political behaviours or combined several behaviours into additive scales of institutional versus non‐institutional participation. Through a multi‐group latent class analysis of participation in 15 different political actions, conducted among citizens from four Western European countries, we identified five empirically grounded participant types that differ in their political engagement, socio‐demographic characteristics and political attitudes: ‘voter specialists', ‘expressive voters', ‘online participants', ‘all‐round activists' and ‘inactives'. While the same participant types were identified in all four countries, the proportion of citizens assigned to each type varies across countries. Our results challenge the claim that some citizens specialize in protest politics at the expense of electoral politics. Furthermore, our typological approach challenges previous findings on the individual characteristics associated with political (in)action.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/374165/3/rojonetal.pdf\n\nDo populist parties promote direct democracy? An empirical assessment in 29 countries in the last two decades\n\nAngelucci, D., Rojon, S., & Vittori, D. (2024). Do populist parties promote direct democracy? An empirical assessment in 29 countries in the last two decades. Contemporary politics. doi:10.1080/13569775.2023.2296748\n\nPopulism is often associated with direct democracy. However, empirical support for this connection remains limited. Analysing a unique dataset on national referendums across 29 countries, this study challenges the presumption that populists are more inclined to advocate for referendums. Surprisingly, populists exhibit this tendency primarily when in opposition. Despite the increasing inclusion of populist parties in coalition governments, their impact on facilitating national-level direct democracy is more complex than anticipated. Utilising V-DEM data over 30 years, we find that populists prima facie enhance the use of direct democracy. However, this effect is contingent on contextual factors, such as party system institutionalisation and the democracy's age, indicating a nuanced relationship between populism and direct democratic practices.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/372069/3/Angelucci.pdf\n\nDistinction within the ‘global north'? A Bourdieusian approach for analysing development discourse\n\nCorten, H. (2024). Distinction within the ‘global north'? A Bourdieusian approach for analysing development discourse: The case of U.S. and E.U. relations with the Colombian state (2016-2022): A comparative analysis. Discourse & society.\n\nThe paper conducts a comparative analysis of EU (91 texts) and US (93 texts) discourses concerning post-peace accord Colombia (late 2016 to mid-2022). Employing a Bourdieu-influenced methodology, our proposal aims to reconcile Post-Development theories with International Relations research. This innovative and multidimensional approach illuminates both discursive continuities within Global North while concurrently providing a framework that allows to identify and interpret internal political divergences. Our findings highlight a shared commitment to a liberal conception of peacebuilding, alongside internal distinction strategies employed to legitimize respective policies towards Colombia.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/373229/3/distinction-within-the-global-north.pdf\n\nThe Communist Party of Belgium and the muncipal elections of 24 November 1946: a deceptive breakthrough\n\nDelwit, P. (2024). The Communist Party of Belgium and the muncipal elections of 24 November 1946: a deceptive breakthrough. Journal of Belgian History, 54(1), 78-108.\n\nOn November 24, 1946, the first municipal elections in Belgium since the end of the Second World War were held. The Communist Party of Belgium (PCB-KPB), which had had relatively little presence in the municipalities until then, achieved what was to be its best electoral and political performance at this level. After the election, the communist leaders reported a significant electoral leap compared to the previous local elections - 1926, 1932 and 1938 - and they claimed that they had won twenty mayoral positions and that more than one hundred of their candidates had been elected as aldermen. Compared to pre-war elections, the result was an undeniable step forward and a potential lever for increased influence. But did this really turn out to be the case? This article tackles the question from two perspectives. The first concerns the data analysis of the election. What were the PCB-KPB's actual electoral and political results ? This is a highly complex question as no database for the 1946 municipal elections exists. Furthermore, information about the communal councils is often patchy or even missing. The second perspective concerns the PCB-KPB itself, notably in terms of its ambitions : how did the PCB-KPB experience and analyse its results on November 24, 1946 ?\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/372891/3/Pascal_Delwit_2024-1.pdf\n\nBeyond parliamentarism: How do citizens want to decide on divisive policies?\n\nVittori, D., Rojon, S., & Pilet, J.-B. (2024). Beyond parliamentarism: How do citizens want to decide on divisive policies? Comparative European politics. doi:10.1057/s41295-024-00379-3\n\nEuropeans, on average, are distrustful toward representative institutions. In recentdecades, to restore confidence in political institutions, several countries have imple-mented alternative decision-making processes. The literature has analyzed prefer-ences for these alternatives, such as direct democracy or technocracy, and their driv-ers. However, these analyses often treated these preferences in isolation, withoutconsidering that citizens might have more complex preferences involving multipleactors in the decision-making process. We test whether this complexity exists in anovel survey experiment where citizens are exposed to two different vignettes aboutdivisive policies in Italy. Our results indicate that, more than anything else, Italiancitizens prefer having their fellow citizens decide alone in referendums. However,they also favor consulting experts before Parliament's decision. Furthermore, wedemonstrate that while instrumentality is still crucial in evaluating the fairness ofthe processes, certain decision-making processes make losers of the policy outcomeas satisfied as specific groups winners. These findings hold significant implicationsfor citizens' policy evaluations, highlighting that the decision-making process mightinfluence their overall satisfaction with policies.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/370452/3/Vittori_et_al_CEP_2024.pdf\n\nEmbedding past, present and future crises: time and the political construction of the Covid-19 pandemic in the EU\n\nCrespy, A., Massart, T., & Moreira Ramalho, T. (2024). Embedding past, present and future crises: time and the political construction of the Covid-19 pandemic in the EU. Revue d'intégration européenne, 1-21. doi:10.1080/07036337.2024.2329995\n\nThis paper investigates the construction of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis by EU elites. It addresses the puzzling relationship between the spread of the new virus with a large-scale reconfiguration of economic governance in the EU which was unimaginable a few months earlier. Drawing from a constructivist approach to political economy, we argue that the discursive construal and framing of this crisis was instrumental to embed the emergency of the pandemic with broader levels of conjunctural, historical, and even civilizational temporal references. Providing a frame analysis of public statements by the heads of the European Commission, the European Council, and European Central Bank during 2020, we show how the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 was framed as a catalyst for tackling the EU's historical crisis of purpose, the socio-economic imbalances left over from the euro crisis, as well as the predicament of the climate crisis.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/372817/3/Published-version.pdf\n\nBeyond ‘responsibility vs. responsiveness': reconfigurations of EU economic governance in response to crises\n\nCrespy, A., Moreira Ramalho, T., & Schmidt, V. (2024). Beyond ‘responsibility vs. responsiveness': reconfigurations of EU economic governance in response to crises. Journal of European public policy, 31(4), 925-949.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic led to an important reconfiguration of economic governance in the European Union towards deeper economic integration. This fits uneasily with predictions of an inevitable political ‘lock-in' stemming from a responsibility-responsiveness dilemma, or an inexorably constraining politicisation. Investigating the evolution in discourses on and policies of economic governance in the EU, the papers in this collection approach the relationship between prevailing notions of responsible and responsive government as socially constructed and critically contingent upon politicisation processes. The special issue explores the reconfiguration of economic governance in the EU through multi-level analysis of politicisation, ranging from citizens' attitudes to conflicts over central banking mandates, using a variety of methodological toolkits. As the collection shows, the shift towards investment, fiscal sharing, and green transition in the new recovery programme followed the emergence of a form of ‘responsive responsibility' dating back to the aftermath of the euro crisis and which has led to the incorporation of responsiveness imperatives in prevailing notions of ‘responsible government'.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/370403/3/CrespyMoreiraRamalhoBeyondRV.pdf\n\nThe angry voter? The role of emotions in voting for the radical left and right at the 2019 Belgian elections\n\nJacobs, L., Close, C., & Pilet, J.-B. (2024). The angry voter? The role of emotions in voting for the radical left and right at the 2019 Belgian elections. International political science review. doi:10.1177/01925121231224524\n\nThis study examines the role of negative (anger, fear) and positive emotions in addition to political attitudes (political trust, populist attitudes, external political efficacy) as key determinants of voting behaviour. We rely on the RepResent voter survey conducted in 2019 in Belgium ( n = 3236) allowing us to assess the relationship between emotions, political attitudes, and the vote for radical right (VB, PP) and radical left parties (PTB-PVDA). Findings indicate that anger is significantly and positively related to voting for radical left and right parties, while controlling for key political attitudes and issue positions. Fear and positive emotions are not significantly more related to voting for radical parties than for other parties. The results suggest that anger should be more systematically integrated in electoral research. These findings call for further analysis on the causal mechanism linking emotions and voting behaviour, and the (in)direct effects of emotions on voting.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/368679/3/Jacobs_Close_Pilet_Accepted_Manuscript_IPSR.pdf\n\nDealing with a Violent Past and its Remnants in the Present\n\nMerlin, A., & Le Huérou, A.

(2024). Kicking off passion: the birth and rise of football in Belgium (1880-1914). Soccer and society.\n\nThe article explores the early advent and evolution of football in Belgium until WWI, highlighting the crucial role played by British expatriates andthe influence of Catholic and State schools. It traces football's journey from an elite pastime to a ‘popular' sport, articulating football development to prominent cleavages in the society, especially Church-State and Economic divides. The paper delves into the challenges of establishing football in Belgian society, including issues of numerous practical problems, amateurism vs. professionalism, the role of Belgians in the establishment of FIFA and the football's contribution to national identity pre-WWI.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/368904/3/KickingoffpassionthebirthandriseoffootballinBelgium.pdf\n\nShut up!

(2024). Explaining judges' opposition when judicial independence is undermined: insights from Poland, Romania, and Hungary. Democratization, 31(1), 47-69. doi:10.1080/13510347.2023.2255833\n\nOver the past decade, governing parties in Central and Eastern Europe have dismantled liberal democracy, violating the rule of law and limiting the power of judges. This article examines the opposition to these transformations, focusing on the role of judges in Poland, Hungary, and Romania. Drawing on an original survey, as well as a set of interviews with judges, the article shows that while in Poland judges have developed a unified opposition to the government in defending their independence, in Romania, in contrast, governmental measures have polarized judges into a divided opposition, while their mobilization has been rather non-existent in Hungary. Why do judges oppose governmental action limiting judicial independence in some contexts but not in others? The article shows that the nature and the sequencing of domestic transformations, coupled with ideational factors and interests-based calculations, explain judges' opposition at the collective and individual levels.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/367184/3/ExplainingJudgesOpposition.pdf\n\nPopulism and alternative models to representative democracy\n\nPilet, J.-B., & Gherghina, S. (2024). Populism and alternative models to representative democracy. Contemporary politics, 1-11. doi:10.1080/13569775.2024.2307092\n\nThis introduction to the special issue provides an overview of the state of the art in the study of populism and democracy. It outlines the current debates and identifies several questions that remain unexplored or underexplored. It elaborates on how the different articles in this special issue address these gaps in the literature in order to advance and consolidate our knowledge about the relationship between populism and alternatives to representative democracy. Those articles make a significant contribution to this debate and open important avenues for future research.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/368678/3/Pilet_Gherghina_2024_intro_special_issue.pdf\n\nHaut-Karabakh : vie et mort d'une enclave arménienne\n\nPapazian, T., Merlin, A., & Hohmann, S.

Income inequality as a benchmark for support for European integration\n\nEck, B., & Schreurs, S. (2024). Unequal perspectives? Income inequality as a benchmark for support for European integration. European Union politics. doi:10.1177/14651165231226054\n\nDespite growing attention to income inequality in debates about European integration, our understanding of its effect on European Union support remains limited. Using European Social Survey data from 2002 to 2020, we analyse how income inequality and pro-redistribution attitudes shape diffuse and specific forms of support for the European Union. We find no direct effect of country-level income inequality, while individual support for redistribution has a negative effect on both. In line with benchmarking theory, inequality emerges as a contextual moderator: in unequal national settings, egalitarian citizens are comparatively more supportive of further integration than in more equal countries. This effect persists when we control for income position, suggesting an ideological rather than utilitarian basis for benchmarking European Union attitudes. We discuss implications in light of debates about a social Europe.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/372001/1/doi_355645.pdf\n\n2023\n\nIntroduction to the Special Issue: EU Digital Policies and Politics\n\nBonnamy, C., & Perarnaud, C.

(2023). Autocratization as Ethnocratization?: How Regime Transformations Toward Autocracy Deteriorate Ethnic Relations. Nationalism & ethnic politics, 1-33. doi:10.1080/13537113.2023.2281732\n\nWhen a country becomes more autocratic, does it affect the relations between ethnic groups in a systematic way? Cross-national and case-based research witnesses how autocratization (the opposite of democratization) is becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly in societies where ethnic relations are politicized and polarized. However, we still lack sufficient know-ledge on how autocratization might have an impact on ethnic relations. The paper advances previous autocratization and ethnic studies. It hypothesizes that if a country autocratizes, this further deteriorates its ethnic relations (ethnocratization). It substantiates this claim through a mixed-method design. It starts with a longitudinal analysis at the ethnic group-level, to dem-onstrate how ethnic discrimination and domination are more probable during autocratization episodes. Next, it examines a collection of international reports on the predicament of ethnic majorities and minorities in countries undergoing autocratization episodes, to identify two causal mechanisms as the main incentives and justifications of the incumbent (and autocratiz-ing) elites: ideological legitimation and authoritarian experimentation. This research encourages scholars on autocratization and ethnic studies to join their efforts, to investigate how democ-racy and ethnic inclusion can decline in parallel and, thus, to show the reasons why they should advance together.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/367409/3/nep_article.pdf\n\nSupport for Deliberative mini-Publics among the Losers of Representative Democracy\n\nPilet, J.-B., Bedock, C., Talukder, D., & Rangoni, S. (2023). Support for Deliberative mini-Publics among the Losers of Representative Democracy. British journal of political science, 1-18. doi:10.1017/S0007123423000479\n\nAbstract The literature on deliberative mini-publics (DMPs) establishes a link between political dissatisfaction and support for DMPs. However, little is known about the sources of political dissatisfaction that trigger this support. Our research tackles this specific question and claims that citizen dissatisfaction is rooted in a position of ‘losers of representative democracy', which leads citizens to be more open to reforms that move away from the representative model. Building on the literature on loser's consent, we focus on the effect of voting for a party not associated with the government and of descriptive and substantive (under)-representation in support of DMPs. We rely on a comparative survey conducted across fifteen Western European countries. Supporters of opposition parties and those who are badly represented, both descriptively and substantively, are more supportive of DMPs. These findings have important implications for understanding the public appeal for deliberative democracy instruments.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/365666/3/Pilet_et_al_2023_onlinefirst.pdf\n\nPopulism and democracy: a reassessment\n\nBorriello, A., Pranchère, J.-Y., & Vandamme, P.-E. (2023). Populism and democracy: a reassessment. Contemporary politics. doi:10.1080/13569775.2023.2296717\n\nPopulism comes in so many forms, both historically and in its contemporary manifestations, that we cannot assess its relationship with democratic institutions as if it were homogeneous. In this article, we reconnect with the history of the first movements that have called themselves populists and draw on an understanding of populism as an egalitarian impulse against oligarchic tendencies, centred on anti-elitism and the defense of a democratic common sense. This genetic approach goes against the dominant definitions which tend to overstretch its range of application while assuming a form of anti-pluralism as part of its common features. Then, we draw attention to the diversity of conceptions of democracy within populist thought and practices and show that the types of democratic institutions favoured by populist movements, and their attitudes towards intermediary bodies, are highly contextual. Finally, we argue that populism's inherent ambiguities shed some doubt on its capacity to respond to the current challenges faced by representative institutions.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/370982/3/Populism-and-democracy-a-reassessment.pdf\n\nRegulating Disinformation and Big Tech in the EU: A Research Agenda on the Institutional Strategies, Public Spheres and Analytical Challenges\n\nBouza García, L., & Oleart, A. (2023). Regulating Disinformation and Big Tech in the EU: A Research Agenda on the Institutional Strategies, Public Spheres and Analytical Challenges. Journal of common market studies. doi:10.1111/jcms.13548\n\nThe growing influence of social media platforms, and the disinformation that circulates in them, has transformed the public spheres. How to deal with disinformation is an open normative, empirical and political question in contemporary democracies. In this article, we outline an agenda on the institutional strategies pursued in the European Union (EU), the normative understandings of the public sphere that such strategies imply, and the analytical challenges to undertake this line of inquiry. We argue that there is an emerging competition in the EU field of disinformation - constructed by actors coming from different pre-existing fields, such as journalism or foreign policy - not only to define what is ‘true' from what is ‘fake', but also to determine the sort of the public sphere and democracy we ought to strive for. This perspective allows us to anticipate which actors might be empowered (or disempowered) depending on how disinformation is addressed in regulatory terms.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/365881/3/JCMS.pdf\n\nDemocracy and pluralism after European integration: Incorporating the contested character of the EU\n\nWolthuis, B., Crum, B., Oleart, A., & Overeem, P.

Critical review of international social and political philosophy. doi:10.1080/13698230.2023.2216043\n\nRecent years have seen multiple controversies between the EU and its member states that revolve around different conceptions of what kind of polity the EU is, and what it should be. These controversies are particularly heated when fundamental democratic values are at stake. In this article, we address the fundamental tension between the assertion of common EU values and the pluralistic character of the EU polity, both among and within member states. The driving question of this article is how we can understand controversies between the EU and its member states in light of the presence of alternative conceptions of the EU and its democratic and pluralistic character. We reconstruct two opposing conceptions of the EU-the intergovernmental and the cosmopolitan conception-and then analyse how the disagreement between these fundamental conceptions plays out in five key controversies. We argue that the disagreement over what the EU is, and what it should be, is inherent to EU politics. The EU can only become democratic if it recognizes these conflicting understandings and provides political arenas in which the disagreements between them can be articulated, confronted, and resolved.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/365880/3/CRISPP.pdf\n\nEditorial: Decolonizing Rather than Decentring ‘Europe'\n\nOrbie, J., Alcazar III, A.

(2023). SLAPPs against journalists in Europe: Exploring the role of self-regulatory bodies. European journal of communication.\n\nReports show that media freedom is under pressure worldwide. Violence against journalists has a legal facet that takes the form of Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPPs) that aim at silencing critical speech. In 2022, the European Commission presented a directive and a complementary recommendation to protect people who engage in public participation, including journalists, from manifestly abusive court proceedings. This article explores the role that journalistic self-regulatory bodies perceive they (could) have in fighting SLAPPs, analysing 16 qualitative answers gathered via a questionnaire. Self-regulation has historically been a way to protect the independence of journalism and uphold its ethical standards. The open-ended responses help to understand how SLAPPs put into question the representations that media councils and professional associations use to construct their ‘professional jurisdiction' (Abbott, 2003), and therefore, their ‘territory' and the way in which they see their role in society. Our results provide food for thought on the handling of legal attacks against journalists.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/364797/3/Slapps.pdf\n\nContagion From Abroad. How Party Entry in Western Europe is Influenced by Party Family Members Abroad, 1961-2016\n\nVan De Wardt, M.-P., Pilet, J.-B., Schumacher, G., & van WITTELOOSTUIJN, A. (2023). Contagion From Abroad. How Party Entry in Western Europe is Influenced by Party Family Members Abroad, 1961-2016. Comparative political studies. doi:10.1177/00104140231204228\n\nNew parties are a key mechanism behind party system innovation as voters are offered new choices. To explain party entry (i.e. participation in a lower house election for the first time), the state-of-the-art has typically focused on domestic determinants. This, however, assumes that party entry takes place in an international vacuum. Building on the policy diffusion literature, we explore how party family members abroad influence party entry in the focal country. Based on a new dataset on the evolution of each party family in 17 Western European party systems between 1961 and 2016, including 2191 new parties, our mixed-methods approach combining spatial econometric models with pathway case analysis demonstrates that party entry is influenced by the entry and electoral success of their party family abroad. This has important implications for the literature on party entry and the international diffusion of policy platforms.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/365200/3/van-de-wardt-pilet-et-al-2023-CPS_onlinefirst.pdf\n\nExploring the Causes of Technocratic Minister Appointments in Europe\n\nPilet, J.-B., Puleo, L., & Vittori, D. (2023). Exploring the Causes of Technocratic Minister Appointments in Europe. Political studies. doi:10.1177/00323217231210129\n\nIn the last decade, the appointment of technocratic ministers has become more common than ever before in Europe. Yet, scholarly attention has mostly focused on the economic determinants that lead to the appointment of such political outsiders in governments. In contrast, political determinants have not been fully examined. This article aims to investigate the role of economic determinants, as well as institutional factors (e.g. electoral system), party-system characteristics (e.g. volatility, polarization) and cabinet-related factors (e.g. intra-cabinet heterogeneity, the strength of populist parties within the government). Using a novel data set comprising data for more than 7000 ministers, including around 900 technocrats, our analysis shows that the share of populist parties within the cabinets has the strongest effect on the likelihood of appointing technocrats in national government. However, institutional-level variables appear to have no effect on the levels of technocratic appointments.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/365249/3/pilet-puleo-vittori-political-studies-onlinefirst.pdf\n\nThe Lure of Technocrats: A Conjoint Experiment on Preferences for Technocratic Ministers in Six European Countries\n\nPanel, S., Paulis, E., Pilet, J.-B., Rojon, S., & Vittori, D. (2023). The Lure of Technocrats: A Conjoint Experiment on Preferences for Technocratic Ministers in Six European Countries. Political behavior. doi:10.1007/s11109-023-09904-8\n\nThe aim of this research is to gauge public support for ministers who did not followa typical “career politician” pathway prior to their nomination (i.e., those whonever held an elected office and are not affiliated to a political party) and to understandwhat drives this support. We use a web-based conjoint experiment fielded insix European countries, in which respondents are presented with pairs of vignettesdescribing the profile of hypothetical ministers and must state which of the two candidatesthey would personally prefer. The task is repeated five times, once for thePrime Minister office and once for four specialized minister positions. We find thatattributes associated with technocratic government almost always increase popularsupport for ministers. These preferences are stable across policy domains and areas prevalent in the case of the PM as in the case of specialized ministries. However,we identify substantial cross-country variations: pro-technocratic attitudes are moreprevalent in Italy, Poland and Spain than in the UK and Germany.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/365025/3/Panel_et_al_2023_onlinefirst.pdf\n\nHow the impossible became possible: evolving frames and narratives on responsibility and responsiveness from the Eurocrisis to NextGenerationEU\n\nCrespy, A., Massart, T., & Schmidt, V.

Rather than a sudden paradigm shift brought about by the pandemic, we argue that it occurred through successive episodes of reinterpreting the rules and layering on new instruments while fostering investment and fiscal sharing on top of the pre-existing ordoliberal regime. Through a discursive institutionalist lens, the paper supports these claims by studying the frames and narratives of French, German and EU leaders during three rounds of reforms, namely the flexibilization of the European Semester (2014-2016), the adoption of the Budgetary Instrument for Convergence and Competitiveness (BICC) (2017-2019), and the adoption of the Recovery and Resilience Facility (2020-2021). The analysis shows that an increased awareness of a responsiveness imperative, going beyond national constituencies, transformed European elites' conceptions of ‘responsible' government thus at least momentarily closing the gap between responsibility and responsiveness.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/365247/3/How-the-impossible-became-possible_published-version.pdf\n\nFrom liberalisation to regulation: managerial political work in the European digital copyright policy (2014-2019)\n\nBonnamy, C.

Journal of European public policy, 1-23. doi:10.1080/13501763.2023.2287227\n\nThe 2019 Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market represents an intriguing departure from the anticipated path of liberalisation in public policy. While it includes provisions seemingly aligned with the liberalisation of the Digital Single Market by relaxing digital copyright enforcement, it also introduces mechanisms that bolster digital copyright protection, signalling a shift towards market regulation. This paper explores why and how Jean-Claude Juncker's European Commission proposed a directive featuring robust regulatory elements despite initial promises of copyright deregulation within the Digital Single Market. Combining insights from political economy and political sociology, I examine the concept of ‘political work' as the practice of promoting, defending, and implementing a choice of public action. Within this framework, I identify a managerial dimension of political work involving political practices that influence the institutional structure and management of public action. Utilising a qualitative methodology involving twelve in-depth interviews with Commission officials conducted between 2018 and 2021, alongside document analysis, I demonstrate how Jean-Claude Juncker and his cabinet's managerial political work, encompassing organisational reforms within the Commission, played a pivotal role in steering the proposed policy towards regulation.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/365387/3/Bonnamy_Managerial_Political_work_Manuscript_POSTPRINT.pdf\n\nDo Mutually Reinforcing Cleavages Harm Democracy?\n\nPanzano, G. (2023). Do Mutually Reinforcing Cleavages Harm Democracy?: Inequalities Between Ethnic Groups and Autocratization. Democratization, 1-25. doi:10.1080/13510347.2023.2264196\n\nDo mutually reinforcing cleavages harm democracy? Evidence from specific cases suggests that autocratization can be related to the predicament of ethnic groups, if ethnicity is politicized and involves resource distribution. However, we know little about whether this is a cause of autocratization more broadly. The article demonstrates that, with increasing inequalities between ethnic groups, a country experiences a decline in its level of democracy and higher propensity to start autocratizing. The analysis thus advances previous contributions, focusing on individual inequalities and power-sharing institutions as explanations of democratization or democratic quality, in two ways. First, isolating autocratization as downturns in democracy levels and the onsets of related timespans (autocratization episodes), and comparing the impact of (economic, political, and social) types of inequalities between ethnic groups. Second, adopting a global sample of (democratic and non-democratic) countries since 1981, with an original data collection integrating expert surveys with survey data. Quantitative evidence confirms most expectations, particularly on economic inequalities between ethnic groups, and - although less precisely - economic, political and social dimensions combined. The findings have important implications for political regime and ethnic studies, showing that preventing the mutual reinforcement of sociocultural and economic cleavages is key to stabilize democracy.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/367413/3/dem_paper.pdf\n\nHow the impossible became possible: evolving frames and narratives on responsibility and responsiveness from the Eurocrisis to NextGenerationEU\n\nCrespy, A., Massart, T., & Schmidt, V.

Politics of the Low Countries, 5(1), 58-89. doi:10.5553/PLC/.000045\n\nThe use of referendums has become increasingly popular among both voters and parties. Yet, despite the diffusion of direct democracy in Europe during the last decades, referendums remain not a very common policy instrument in Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg). We establish that this trend could be attributed to a large consensus among mainstream (especially right) parties and voters against the use of direct democracy. Moreover, we confirmed the well-established line of demarcation with radical ideologies, which convey overall more support on the use of referendums than their mainstream counterparts. Additionally, and probably reflecting this new line of cleavage, we show that support for referendums among the voters relate to left-wing economic position, but also with culturally right-wing view. Overall, this article questions the relevance of the traditional left-right divide to explain support for direct democracy, as well as the capacity for (some) parties to align with their voters in terms of democratic demands.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/368882/3/Paulis-Rangoni-2023-preprint.pdf\n\n‘Democracy without Politics' in the European Commission's Response to Democratic Backsliding\n\nOleart, A., & Theuns, T.

Journal of common market studies, 61(4), 882-899. doi:10.1111/jcms.13411\n\nAbstract The debate on EU responses to democratic backsliding in EU member states has mostly been anchored on technocratic appeals to the rule of law and judicial independence, and on Poland and Hungary. In this article, we ask: What understandings of democracy have shaped the European Commission's response to democratic backsliding in recent years? After developing an understanding of pluralist democracy, we uncover the way in which the European Commission conceives of democracy through a discourse analysis of European Commissioners' speeches (2018-21) and a normative‐theoretical analysis. We identify the Commission's conception as a form of ‘democracy without politics', and argue that it matches the EU's policy choices in regard to democratic backsliding. We argue that a fuller, healthier and normatively more attractive conception of democracy encompasses more attention to political pluralism, agonistic contestation and the vibrancy of civil society.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/365879/3/JCMS.pdf\n\nLa «intergubernamentalidad» neoliberal y la politización de la UE: la transformación de los campos políticos nacionales y los nuevos europeísmos\n\nBouza García, L., & Oleart, A.

Revista española de investigaciones sociológicas,(183), 3-22. doi:10.5477/cis/reis.183.3\n\nLa década de 2010, iniciada con la crisis financiera, continuada con la de los refugiados y culminada con la del coronavirus en 2020, ha consolidado los enfoques teóricos en torno al campo político europeo como algo más que un entorno diplomático en el que gobiernos nacionales negocian políticas comunes. Sin embargo, la crisis del coronavirus ha dado lugar a una respuesta más rápida y decisiva que las anteriores, movilizando una cantidad de recursos sin precedentes y construyendo nuevos consensos a un ritmo no contemplado anteriormente. El artículo plantea desde la sociología política que las recientes crisis europeas revelan una transformación en las formas de ejercicio de la política que llamamos «intergubernamentalidad», un proceso compatible con la transformación de los campos políticos nacionales a través de la politización de la UE.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/365890/3/REIS.pdf\n\nTechnocracy above partisanship?

The American political science review, 1-9. doi:10.1017/S0003055423000527\n\nIn an influential recent study, Broockman and Skovron (2018) found that American politicians consistently overestimate the conservativeness of their constituents on a host of issues. Whether this conservative bias in politicians' perceptions of public opinion is a uniquely American phenomenon is an open question with broad implications for the quality and nature of democratic representation. We investigate it in four democracies: Belgium, Canada, Germany, and Switzerland. Despite these countries having political systems that differ greatly, we document a strong and persistent conservative bias held by a majority of the 866 representatives interviewed. Our findings highlight the conservative bias in elites' perception of public opinion as a widespread regularity and point toward a pressing need for further research on its sources and impacts.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/359579/3/Pilet_et_al_2023_onlinefirst.pdf\n\nTime to go: Paths of term limit resilience in sub-Saharan Africa\n\nCassani, A., & Tomini, L.

European political science. doi:10.1057/s41304-023-00432-x\n\nAbstract Empirical literature regarding which actors support the most participatory democracy is surprisingly scarce. Discussing the core ideological features of populist and post-materialist-centred parties, we expect that these parties emphasise participatory democracy more than their competitors. Additionally, populist parties should embody a monist demand for greater participatory democracy, while post-materialist-centred (PMC) parties should advocate a pluralist understanding of it. Drawing on party electoral manifestos, we verify these assumptions in several national elections across Europe. Our findings show mixed support for the theoretical expectations. Both post-materialist and populist parties support participatory democracy more than other parties, and their principles diverge. More precisely, our data confirm that PMC parties advocate a pluralist understanding of participatory democracy. Yet populist parties show a fuzzier picture. While populist radical right parties exhibit a monist profile, radical left populist parties are much more in line with post-materialist arguments.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/367182/1/doi_350826.pdf\n\nStudying dimensions of representation: introducing the Belgian RepResent panel (2019-2021)\n\nMichel, E., Feitosa Ribeiro, F., Lefevere, J., Pilet, J.-B., Van Erkel, P., & Van Haute, E.

European political science. doi:10.1057/s41304-023-00430-z\n\nThis research note presents the RepResent Belgian Panel (RBP). The RBP is a voter panel survey consisting of four waves fielded to a sample of voters in Belgium around the May 2019 federal, regional, and European elections in Belgium. It provides unique data on about 250 variables for a quota sample of the same respondents, pre-2019 elections (N = 7351), post-2019 elections (N = 3909), one year after the elections (N = 1996), and 2 years after the elections (N = 1119). The RBP panel dataset was designed to analyse voters' political attitudes and behaviours, notably on different dimensions of democratic representation, and with a specific focus on democratic resentment (e.g. citizens' attitudes towards democracy such as distrust and alienation, but also behaviours such as abstention, protest, or voting for anti-establishment parties). Its longitudinal structure allows to explore the political dynamics at play in Belgium throughout the lengthy government formation process. Finally, the last two waves of the RBP were fielded during the Covid-19 pandemic, allowing to explore public opinion before and during this global crisis. The RBP should be of interest to scholars of public opinion and electoral studies.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/359111/3/EPS2023.pdf\n\nLost in transition? Social justice and the politics of the EU green transition\n\nCrespy, A., & Munta, M. (2023). Lost in transition? Social justice and the politics of the EU green transition. Transfer, 29(2).\n\nFocusing on two key instruments, the Just Transition Fund and the Social Climate Fund, this article assesses to what extent the EU's pledge for a ‘just transition' has the potential to foster greater social justice while implementing the European Green Deal. We analyse the related objectives, policy tools and patterns of political conflict and find that both Funds have narrow objectives anchored in a reactive logic complementing existing social investment initiatives with a focus on reskilling the workforce hit by decarbonisation. Both instruments rely on multi-level investment aiming to generate green growth, combined with targeted compensation for the more vulnerable. This, we argue, is not conducive to a just transition that addresses the intersection of environmental and social problems in a holistic way. Finally, various political fault lines pose the threat that EU action will be insufficient to tackle exacerbated inequalities in the future.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/353441/3/CrespyMuntaTransfer.pdf\n\nCandidate visibility, voter knowledge, and the incumbency advantage in preferential-list PR\n\nBräuninger, T., Däubler, T., & Pilet, J.-B.

Party politics, 135406882311782. doi:10.1177/13540688231178265\n\nOur knowledge about how voters decide which candidate(s) to vote for under preferential-list proportional representation (PLPR) systems remains limited. In particular, it is debated whether incumbent MPs enjoy an electoral advantage over outsiders also under PLPR. We argue that such an incumbency advantage critically depends on candidate visibility (in the media) and differs across voters with varying levels of political knowledge. Our empirical analysis combines candidate information with rich individual-level voting data collected via “mock ballots” in the 2014 Belgian PartiRep election study. We show that the vote premium linked to incumbency increases with increasing media visibility, and while high-visibility incumbents outperform incumbents among the entire electorate, low-visibility incumbents enjoy an advantage only among knowledgeable voters. The results contribute to a better understanding of candidate voting and the incumbency advantage in PLPR. They also have implications for campaign strategies and the regulation of media access.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/359057/3/Brauninger_Daubler_Pilet_onlinefirst.pdf\n\nIt's not only about the leader.

Party politics. doi:It's not only about the leader. Oligarchized personalization and preference voting in Belgium\n\nResearch on the electoral personalization of politics has stressed a trend towards a greater role of top prominent political figures (party leaders and ministers). This trend was described as centralized electoral personalization. Yet, this trend is merely one side of a more complex story. No leader attracts all voters' support, and other candidates manage to stand out despite lower resources and visibility. Using a unique dataset of 47,239 actual ballot papers cast for the 2018 Belgian local elections, we show that candidates-level, lists-level and districts-level factors result in distinct preference voting behaviour. While these factors lead to unmistakable forms of (de-)centralized personalized forms of elections, we, furthermore, show that intermediary situations distinctively emerge. A significant number of ‘subtop' candidates stand out among candidates, by attracting support from voters who do not support the mere leader of the list. This ‘oligarchized personalization' would deserve greater attention in the literature.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/358131/3/Dodeigne_Pilet_online_first.pdf\n\nInformation or Accountability?

A Research Agenda on European Commissioners in National Parliaments. Journal of common market studies, 61(3), 853-864. doi:10.1111/jcms.13399\n\nAbstract Research on national parliaments in the EU has greatly expanded since the Treaty of Lisbon fully recognized their role in providing democratic legitimacy for EU decision‐making. However, the direct interaction between national parliaments and the European Commission has received little academic attention. This research note seeks to frame a research agenda that explores whether, and under which conditions, the Commission visits to national parliaments have the potential to develop from sites for inter‐institutional exchange of information to arenas for cross‐level accountability. We lay out a framework to capture the relation between national parliaments and the Commission based on three kinds of indicators: the formal set‐up, logic of interaction, and public communication. We illustrate the kind of evidence and range of variation that this agenda may unearth by applying this framework in an exploratory analysis of Trade Commissioner Malmström's visits to seven national parliaments in the EU.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/365889/3/JCMS.pdf\n\nBusiness as usual?

The Information society, 39(5), 282-295. doi:10.1080/01972243.2023.2241470\n\nThis article was motivated by the question whether gamification represents a substantial innovation in internal party democracy, by contributing to change the dynamics of power within parties. To answer this question, we examine the only known case of gamification in the field of internal party voting, launched by the Italian Movimento 5 Stelle. We expected that gamified internal votes would reduce the incumbent advantage and promote party activists. Our data, however, suggest that these decision-making processes follow the same logic as the traditional ones. We thus conclude that digital innovations often end up working as “business as usual”.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/372464/3/Biancalana.pdf\n\nA digital principal?

While the literature focused mainly on the relationship between voters and those parties, less attention has been given to the role of members' priorities in shaping parties' legislative activity. In this paper, we focus on a paradigmatic technopopulist case, the Italian Five Star Movement (FSM): one of the founding trademarks of the party was the involvement of the members in the party activities via a digital platform. FSM's digital platform included participative digital law-making features, which matched member priorities and élite policymaking. We built an original dataset which comprises the law-making activities of members and parliamentarians from 2013 to 2019.

A New Arena for Electoral Politics\n\nVan Haute, E., & Kernalegenn, T. (2023). Political Parties Abroad. A New Arena for Electoral Politics. Representation.\n\nThis Special Issue contributes to the growing literature on parties abroad. Expansive citizenship has transformed and reinforced the civic and political links between emigrants and their home country. Political parties face the dilemma of engaging or not in this new arena for electoral politics and must consider how. However, until recently the literature on transnationalism and on party politics has surprisingly largely overlooked this issue. This introduction identifies the existing gaps in the literature, and stresses two main questions that remains largely unanswered, namely (1) why and how parties decide to campaign abroad, and (2) how voters abroad are receptive to these campaigns and operate their party choice in this specific context. The five articles offer a mix of case studies and comparative perspective, and quantitative and qualitative analyses. This case selection allows to explore the diversity of strategies adopted by political parties abroad in different settings, with different tools. The results illustrate the impact of local party branches and entrepreneurs' outreach and local campaigns on mobilisation, turnout, and the result of elections, but also show that emigrants' vote choice is influenced both by the context of their country of origin and of their country of residence.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/357395/3/Proofs_Intro.pdf\n\nWhen the Far Right Makes the News: Protest Characteristics and Media Coverage of Far-Right Mobilization in Europe\n\nCastelli Gattinara, P., & Froio, C. (2023). When the Far Right Makes the News: Protest Characteristics and Media Coverage of Far-Right Mobilization in Europe. Comparative political studies, 001041402311690. doi:10.1177/00104140231169029\n\nWhen do the media cover far-right protests? News coverage matters for the entrenchment of the far right in contemporary democracies, but little comparative research has looked at what drives news attention to far-right mobilization. We apply a classic input-output process model of news selection bias to test the hypothesis that the visibility of far-right protests events depends on the characteristics of protest initiators, type of action, and reactions. We appraise this via logistic regressions on an original dataset of 5972 protest events retrieved from online press releases by far-right groups (input) and national quality newspapers (output) in 11 European countries (2008-2018). The analysis confirms that news media are particularly responsive to contentious action, protest around migration issues, and action-reaction chains between political opponents. Our findings shed light on the role of news organizations in the success of the far-right and on the pathways by which these movements shape public agendas.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/357484/3/Preprint_CPS_CastelliFroio.pdf\n\nThe establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office: integration with limited supranationalisation?\n\nSchmeer, L.

Journal of European integration, 1-25. doi:10.1080/07036337.2023.2196069\n\nIn 2017, member states established the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO), an EU body investigating and prosecuting offences against the EU financial interests. This article analyses the relation between the institutional design of the EPPO and sovereignty concerns of member states. Combining the core state powers framework with literature on Council negotiation dynamics, it argues that the Council was divided on the question of how far-reaching the authority of this new body vis-à-vis member states should be or to what extent member states should retain control over the body. A qualitative discourse analysis shows that the competition between states sharing a supranational position regarding the EPPO and those sharing an intergovernmental position resulted in the creation of a complex and ambiguous body. These findings contribute to the literature on agencification of Justice and Home Affairs as well as, more broadly, to scholarship on the construction of new types of authority.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/358184/3/Postprint.pdf\n\nWhen nationalism meets populism: examining right-wing populist & nationalist discourses in the 2014 & 2019 European parliamentary elections\n\nRodi, P., Karavasilis, L., & Puleo, L.

H. (2023). The political economy of a failed drug reform: Insights from Peru's main legal coca valley. International journal on drug policy, 117. doi:10.1016/j.drugpo.2023.104050\n\nAs the world's second largest coca producer, Peru has a flourishing market for coca for non-narcotic uses. With more than 20,000 hectares and approximately 35,000 officially registered farmers in the Peruvian legal scheme for coca cultivation and commercialization, this market is formally under the monopoly of the National Enterprise of Coca (ENACO). Nonetheless, ENACO only captures 2% of all coca produced nationally and has experienced a sustained reduction of farmers' participation and coca purchases within the legal trade. At different times, these problems have opened the way to demands from left-wing political parties, subnational governments, coca growers' organizations and even Peru's central drug control institutions to reform the legal coca market in Peru. However, none of these attempts have succeeded. Based on a policy analysis of the legal coca trade and analysis of official data, together with a case study of Peru's main legal coca valley (La Convención) this article seeks to understand the current crisis of the legal coca trade as well as the repeated failures of reform. Peru's political centralism and the historical marginalization of Andean culture help to explain the successful blocking of reform attempts to the legal coca trade.\n\nIs There an Alternative to Consensus?\n\nMarie, A., & Costa, O.

International journal of parliamentary studies. doi:https://doi.org/10.1163/26668912-bja10057\n\nConsensus is a key feature of the European Union. In the European Parliament, most legislation is adopted by a grand coalition between the left and the right. While this trans-partisan cooperation has always been informal, the epp and S&D groups agreed on a formal political coalition in 2014. For the first time in the ep's history, this grand coalition was based on a policy programme negotiated by the two groups' leadership. Based on roll-call vote data, this paper aims to understand the impact of this deal on actual coalition-building in the ep plenary. We find that the 2014 coalition deal provided a framework that incentivises legislative actors to increase their levels of cooperation on the issues on which they usually cooperate the least.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/356685/3/PARL_paper_submitted.pdf\n\nWhich political outsiders do Europeans prefer as ministers?\n\nRojon, S., Pilet, J.-B., Vittori, D., Panel, S., & Paulis, E. (2023). Which political outsiders do Europeans prefer as ministers? European Political Science Review, 1-21. doi:10.1017/S1755773923000048\n\nAbstract Previous research suggests that Europeans want more experts in government, but which experts do they want and why? Using survey data collected in 15 European countries, this study compared citizens' preferences for high-ranking civil servants, university professors, and business executives over traditional political actors (MPs and former ministers) as ministers in government. Overall, university professors were rated more positively than MPs or former ministers in almost all countries, whereas civil servants and business executives were only rated more positively than politicians in Poland, Italy, Spain, Greece, Ireland, and Belgium. While political distrust is a key predictor of preferring political outsiders, we also found that civil servants are not as appealing to politically distrusting individuals, depending on the country. Furthermore, while the demand for more expertise in government mainly influences preferences for university professors, the demand for more government by the people is connected to preferences for business executives and (to a lesser extent) civil servants. The latter finding challenges the common distinction between citizen and expert-oriented visions of democracy and the alleged ‘elitist' underpinnings of empowering non-elected outsiders.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/356281/3/Rojon_et_al_2023_ESPR_online_first.pdf\n\nWho do Europeans want to govern? Exploring the multiple dimensions of citizens' preferences for political actors in nine European countries\n\nPilet, J.-B., Vittori, D., Rojon, S., & Paulis, E. (2023).

Party politics, 135406882311539. doi:10.1177/13540688231153932\n\nMany studies have tried to identify citizens' views about which actors should govern and how. These studies have mostly looked at support for citizens or independent experts being given a greater role. Recently, Hibbing, Theiss-Morse, Hibbing and Fortunato have proposed a new battery of 21 survey items capturing the dimensions along which citizens' preferences for who should govern are organized. Testing their survey instrument among US respondents, they identified seven dimensions. In this study, we replicate their approach across nine European democracies, namely, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Ireland and the Netherlands. The replication allows, first, to compare citizens' preferences for political actors between the US and Europe, and within Europe. Second, it provides suggestions for how Hibbing and colleagues' battery might be adapted and re-used in other countries, enabling further cross-national comparative research on citizens' preferences for who should govern.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/356284/3/WhodoEuropeanswanttogovern.pdf\n\nA scandal effect?

(2023). The political construction of the ‘citizen turn' in the EU: disintermediation and depoliticisation in the Conference on the Future of Europe. Journal of contemporary European studies, 1-15. doi:10.1080/14782804.2023.2177837\n\nThe EU has recently organised a series of ‘citizen-centred' processes that may be indicative of a new pattern in terms of democracy and participation. The article begins with this observation in order to pose the following question: to what extent the introduction of ‘citizen participation' mechanisms in the Conference on the Future of Europe reflects a rupture with the EU's dominant understanding of democracy? While there are innovative elements in the Conference, which are described in detail, the article develops a normative critique of the underlying philosophy with which it was organised and constructed, as it followed an alternative legitimacy logic that fundamentally deviates from an agonistic public sphere perspective. The Conference illustrates a ‘citizen turn' that breaks away from the ‘participatory turn' described by Saurugger (2010) in that it decouples ‘citizen participation' from civil society and the idea of a European public sphere, both in discursive terms as well as in the ensuing political practices. The article concludes with a wider conceptualisation of what the ‘citizen turn' means for EU democracy, and why the disintermediation of European politics is coherent with the preexistent depoliticised EU political dynamics, conceived in the case of the Conference as ‘democracy without politics'.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/365884/3/CoFoE.pdf\n\nParticiper sans protester.

Journal of economic psychology, 102602. doi:10.1016/j.joep.2023.102602\n\nWe study the choice of multi-person bargaining protocols in the context of politics. In politics, citizens are increasingly involved in the design of democratic rules, for instance via referendums. If they support the rule that best serves their self-interest, the outcome inevitably advantages the largest group. In this paper, we challenge this pessimistic view with an original lab experiment, in which 252 subjects participated. In the first stage, these subjects experience elections under plurality and approval voting. In the second stage, they decide which rule they want to use for extra elections. We find that egalitarian values that subjects hold outside of the lab shape their choice of electoral rule in the second stage when a rule led to a fairer distribution of payoffs compared to the other one in the first stage. The implication is that people have consistent ‘value-driven preferences' for decision rules.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/355145/1/doi_338789.pdf\n\nDo technocrats boost the acceptance of policy proposals among the citizenry? Evidence from a survey experiment in Italy\n\nVittori, D., Paulis, E., Pilet, J.-B., & Rojon, S. (2023). Do technocrats boost the acceptance of policy proposals among the citizenry? Evidence from a survey experiment in Italy. Electoral studies, 81, 102566. doi:10.1016/j.electstud.2022.102566\n\nAre policies proposed by technocrats more easily accepted by citizens than those proposed by traditional partisan actors? This is a crucial question, as politicians increasingly rely on technocrats for resolving “wicked problems” such as financial, environmental, and health crises. To answer this question, we conducted a survey experiment among 5000 Italian respondents. At the time of our experiment, Italy was governed by a “grand coalition” of various technocratic and partisan actors, enabling us to realistically vary the proponents of different policy proposals. Overall, citizens are more likely to accept policies proposed by technocrats as opposed to party leaders. In particular, we find that technocratic proponents boost policy acceptance even more for economic and valence issues. Furthermore, we find that this “technocratic effect” is generally stronger among citizens who are more likely to disagree with the policy content.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/353700/3/Vittori_et_al_2023_pre_print_version.pdf\n\nTechnocratic Ministers in Office in European Countries (2000-2020): What's New?\n\nVittori, D., Pilet, J.-B., Rojon, S., & Paulis, E.

Political studies review, 147892992211400. doi:10.1177/14789299221140036\n\nAlthough Europeans are favourable towards the idea of being governed by ‘independent experts', and despite the burgeoning literature on technocratic ministers, we still miss important information about the profiles of technocrats in government. This article provides new insights into the characteristics of non-partisan, non-elected ministers and the roles they perform once in government based on a Technocratic Ministers' Dataset covering all governments in 31 European countries from 2000 to 2020. First, we show that average share of technocratic (as opposed to partisan) ministers in European cabinets rose from 9.5% to 14.2% over the last two decades. This increase is characteristic of all macro-regions, except Scandinavian countries. Second, technocratic ministers are assigned to a diversity of portfolios and not just finance and economy, which, respectively, account for only 15% of technocratic ministers. Finally, technocratic ministers do not hold office for shorter periods of time than partisan ones, except when they are part of caretaker cabinets.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/353702/3/Vittori_et_al_2023_PSR_pre_print.pdf\n\nHow Do Politicians Bargain? Evidence from Ultimatum Games with Legislators in Five Countries\n\nSHEFFER, L., JOHN LOEWEN, P., WALGRAVE, S., Bailer, S., BREUNIG, C., HELFER, L., Pilet, J.-B., VARONE, F., & VLIEGENTHART, R.

The American political science review, 1-19. doi:10.1017/S0003055422001459\n\nPoliticians regularly bargain with colleagues and other actors. Bargaining dynamics are central to theories of legislative politics and representative democracy, bearing directly on the substance and success of legislation, policy, and on politicians' careers. Yet, controlled evidence on how legislators bargain is scarce. Do they apply different strategies when engaging different actors? If so, what are they, and why? To study these questions, we field an ultimatum game bargaining experiment to 1,100 sitting politicians in Belgium, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, and the United States. We find that politicians exhibit a strong partisan bias when bargaining, a pattern that we document across all of our cases. The size of the partisan bias in bargaining is about double the size when politicians engage citizens than when they face colleagues. We discuss implications for existing models of bargaining and outline future research directions.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/355579/1/doi_339223.pdf\n\nBig ideas, little detail: how populist parties talk about referendums in Europe\n\nGherghina, S., Pilet, J.-B., & Mitru, B. (2023). Big ideas, little detail: how populist parties talk about referendums in Europe. Contemporary politics, 1-19. doi:10.1080/13569775.2023.2296734\n\nThe idea of increasing the power of the ‘pure people' at the expense of a ‘corrupt elite' lies at the core of populism. One way for populist parties to do this is to push for a greater use of referendums. Previous research shows that populist parties mention in general in their communications the referendums as suitable avenues for the direct involvement of the people in the decision-making process. However, we miss details about how they refer to referendums. This article addresses this gap in the literature and explores how populist parties talk about referendums in their election manifestos. It seeks to identify what type of referendum populist parties tend to support, and to analyze whether their support for referendums is generic or policy-specific. Our qualitative content analysis draws on the election manifestos used by 38 populist parties in 21 European democracies in national elections taking place between 2016 and 2023.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/366751/3/Ghergina_Pilet_Mitru_onlinefirst.pdf\n\nParliamentarians' Support for Direct and Deliberative Democracy in Europe: An Account of Individual-Level Determinants\n\nGherghina, S., Close, C., & Carman, C.

Frontiers in Political Science, 5, 1005385. doi:10.3389/fpos.2023.1005385\n\nDuring COVID-19 politics was radically transformed. Even though parliaments, parties, and parliamentary groups continued working, they did so mainly through digital means. Our aim is to investigate how political parties and their élites reacted to those changes. For this aim, we launched a pilot survey among party élites in Spain and Italy. We use descriptive statistics and multivariate OLS regressions to answer to our research questions. Our results point out that parties quickly adapted to executive online meetings, but meetings of other (representative) organs were far less frequent. As for the élites' adaptation and in particular privacy concerns, we find that socio-demographic characteristic of the élites matter and being member of a digital party are not crucial determinants, as we expected. Ideology, on the contrary, play a much relevant role, with right-wing élites being more concerned about privacy. Finally, younger and more educated respondents are more favorable toward moving some parties' activities in the on-line sphere.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/371292/1/doi_354936.pdf\n\n2022\n\nFame and factions: A process-tracing analysis of the 2019 leadership selection process in the Belgian French-speaking liberal party (MR)\n\nLegein, T., & Van Haute, E.

Frontiers in Political Science, 4, 1057051. doi:10.3389/fpos.2022.1057051\n\nThis study applies process-tracing methods to understand the 2019 leadership selection process in the Belgian French-speaking liberal party, MR, which is the oldest and second largest party in French-speaking Belgium. We triangulate a variety of sources to assemble a rich qualitative material that is used to contrast the formal rules and outcome of the race to the actual process. We show that the gatekeepers were not the ones ascribed in the statutes, that formal rules were bent to fit the profile of the race, and that the very nature of the race was much closer to a coronation than the results may suggest. We also uncover mechanisms through which party actors, especially the incumbent leader as steering agent, informally influence the process to the desired outcome, with the race being played prior to the validation of the candidacies. This analysis puts focuses on when and how key actors use their informal influence to weigh the process and influence the outcome of leadership races.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/352681/3/FOPS_Final.pdf\n\nHow many captains for a ship on electoral drift?

How many captains for a ship on electoral drift? Limiting the number of leadership candidates in the Flemish Christian-democratic party (CD&V). Frontiers in Political Science, 4, 1068207. doi:10.3389/fpos.2022.1068207\n\nMany Western parties have opened up the process of leadership selection to party members under the noble premises to democratize the party. Yet, this might just be window-dressing as party leadership selection is often a coronation rather than an open contest. We argue that the preparation phase preceding the actual election phase is crucial in understanding the balance between the impact of party members and the steering of the party elite. This study compares the preparation phase of two leadership contests after losing elections in one party, the Flemish Christian-democratic party in Belgium: one with a single candidate and one with an exceptionally high number of candidates. Our analysis, based on 22 in-depth elite interviews, demonstrates that leadership elections are influenced by a cluster of different influencing actors, but in particular by what we label the “last person standing” whose candidacy is identified as the most effective mechanism to influence the nomination process. Other (slightly less effective) influencing mechanisms include encouragements, discouragements and the diffusion of an ideal profile for the future party leader.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/370828/1/doi_354472.pdf\n\nIs Protest Only Negative? Examining the Effect of Emotions and Affective Polarization on Protest Behaviour\n\nBettarelli, L., Close, C., & Van Haute, E. (2022). Is Protest Only Negative? Examining the Effect of Emotions and Affective Polarization on Protest Behaviour. Politics and Governance, 10(4), 311-324. doi:10.17645/pag.v10i4.5665\n\nThis contribution sheds light on the link between affect and protest behaviors. Using data from a voter survey conducted around the 2019 elections in Belgium, we examine two dimensions of affect: a vertical one, i.e., negative and positive emotions towards politics in general, and a horizontal one, i.e., affective polarization towards fellow citizens. Our findings make three important contributions. First, we identify five distinct classes of respondents depending on their emotions towards politics (apathetic, angry, hopeful, highly emotional, and average). Second, we demonstrate that the combination of both anger and hope is more strongly associated with protest action than anger alone. By contrast, apathy, characterized by an absence of emotions towards politics, is negatively related to protest behavior. Third, we show that affective polarization is a key driver of protest behavior per se. We also show that the two dimensions of affect have distinctive effects. Yet they interact: Affective polarization towards political opponents compensates for the absence of emotions towards politics in general.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/351526/3/PaG2022.pdf\n\n“My guitar is my rifle”: Mexican migrants mobilising unconventionally through arts\n\nLara-Guerrero, L., & Rojon, S.

Comparative Migration Studies, 10(1). doi:10.1186/s40878-022-00321-0\n\nDiasporas can create, transform, and exploit transnational networks to engage in politi‐ cal movements in their homeland and in their hostland, engaging in both electoral and non‐electoral politics through political parties, political campaigns, and hometown organisations. However, the individual processes of subjectivation and its relation‐ship with arts as a form of political engagement have been under‐explored especially in contexts of violence and insecurity. This ethnographic paper sheds light on the micro‐level of diaspora mobilisation by introducing the concept of “subjectivity” as a key term to analyse the transnational and unconventional political practices organised by migrants. As a result, this research aims to answer the following questions: (1) How are Mexican migrants becoming diasporic political subjects and creating spaces of transnational political activism in reaction to the context of violence in their home‐ land? (2) What makes them resort to art as a repertoire of contention against violence in their home towns? The paper introduces empirical examples collected in Brussels during 19 months of fieldwork with members of the Mexican diaspora, including semi‐structured interviews with key informants and participant observation at political demonstrations, music rehearsals, charity concerts, gastronomic and artistic festivals, and political debates.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/351239/3/2022.pdf\n\nExecutive gladiators in the European arena: discursive intergovernmentalism in the politicization of the Covid-19 EU recovery plan\n\nOleart, A., & Gheyle, N.

Revue d'intégration européenne, 44(8), 1095-1111. doi:10.1080/07036337.2022.2085695\n\nAs the politicization of European integration is channeled through the media, it fundamentally implies a discursive power distribution between actors and institutions based on who and what type of argument is promoted. Scholars have started to hypothesize who will benefit from this expansion of debates to wider publics, predominantly using media logics to conclude with the notion of ‘discursive intergovernmentalism': where media spotlights enter, executives benefit. In this paper, we contribute to these nascent studies into the discursive empowerment of actors and institutions, by adding a critical notion. Taking our cue from Critical Discourse Analysis, we argue that media output should not only be theorized based on news values, but equally by accounting for existing institutional power (im)balances. To evaluate this argument, we draw on new intergovernmentalist theory, and empirically delve into the Spanish and Dutch media coverage of the (run-up to the) July 2020 NextGenerationEU recovery package.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/365888/3/JEI.pdf\n\nMetaphors, political knowledge and the basic income debate in Belgium: an experimental study\n\nVandeleene, A., Randour, F., Dodeigne, J., Heyvaert, P., Legein, T., PERREZ, J., & Reuchamps, M.

Metaphor and the social world, 13(2).\n\nThe framing impact of political discourses has long been attested for. Metaphors in particular are known to ease the understanding of complex concepts and processes. Yet, the question remains to what extent metaphors do work the same on different recipients? Based on an experimental design, we test a potentially key moderating variable in the study of political metaphors: political knowledge. Our experiment aims at determining the extent to which the confrontation of individuals to arguments and metaphors impacts their preferences regarding the implementation of a basic income in Belgium. In particular, we hypothesize that the marginal effect of metaphors as cognitive shortcuts decreases when political knowledge increases. Our findings suggest that some metaphorical frames are more successful than others, hereby supporting the idea that the aptness of the metaphorical frame is a key factor when conducting experiments. We conclude that political knowledge is an important variable when analyzing the framing effect of metaphors, especially when it goes about very low or very high levels of political knowledge. The insertion of metaphors in political discourses may easily succeed in rallying individuals behind a given cause, but this would only work if participants have a lower knowledge of politics.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/354561/3/VANDELEENEalMSWFinalProofs.pdf\n\nRegional inequalities as drivers of affective polarization\n\nBettarelli, L., & Van Haute, E. (2022). Regional inequalities as drivers of affective polarization. Regional studies, regional science, 9(1), 549-570.\n\nThis paper investigates divergences in levels of affective polarization across Belgian regions around the 2019 elections. Elaborating on the relative deprivation theory, we analyse the role of current and long- term socio-economic regional inequalities and of geographical distance separating regions. Empirically, we aggregate individual-level measures of affective polarization at the Belgian NUTS-3 level and use a gravity approach to explore the determinants of regional divergences. Our results show that regional variations in affective polarization are best explained by a current rural-urban divide and by how regions have performed economically in the last years. We also show that geographical proximity matters and reinforces the effects of economic deprivation.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/350131/3/PaperRSRS.pdf\n\nConflicts of sovereignty in contemporary Europe: a framework of analysis\n\nBickerton, C., Brack, N., Coman, R., & Crespy, A. (2022). Conflicts of sovereignty in contemporary Europe: a framework of analysis. Comparative European politics. doi:10.1057/s41295-022-00269-6\n\nContemporary conflicts of sovereignty in Europe have gone beyond the clash between national and supranational sovereignty. Sovereignty conflicts are increasingly occurring within member states. This paper develops a conceptual framework that distinguishes between foundational, institutional and territorial conflicts of sovereignty, elaborating on this taxonomy with reference to the historical evolution of the concept of sovereignty in Europe. It provides an account of why we have seen a proliferation in conflicts of sovereignty within European states. This is due in part to the notion of “shared” sovereignty. Central to European integration, this notion has introduced considerable institutional indeterminacy into the political systems of member states, leading to many of the institutional conflicts of sovereignty we see in Europe today. The struggle of national party systems to institutionalize societal conflict via partisan competition is another contributory factor. This has displaced conflict onto the terrain of how popular rule is institutionalized within the national state. In developing this framework, the paper provides a method for distinguishing between political conflicts tout court and those touching specifically upon sovereignty. Moreover, the framework helps us distinguish between those conflicts of sovereignty most destabilizing for a polity and those which are less so.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/342423/1/elsevier_326067.pdf\n\nAntagonistic understandings of sovereignty in the 2015 Polish constitutional crisis\n\nComan, R. (2022). Antagonistic understandings of sovereignty in the 2015 Polish constitutional crisis. Comparative European politics. doi:10.1057/s41295-022-00270-z\n\nSince the 2015 parliamentary elections in Poland, the government led by the Law and Justice party (PiS) has sought to win two interwoven battles: the restoration of ‘a strong state' internally and ‘regaining sovereignty' in the country's relationship with the EU. By examining the 2015 constitutional crisis in Poland, this article seeks to understand how and why a domestic dispute over the nomination of constitutional judges has transformed into a conflict of sovereignty in the EU polity. The paper shows that the claims to sovereignty of political, social, and legal actors reflect opposing conceptions of this principle as well as of democracy and the rule of law. PiS' understanding of State sovereignty is rooted in the past, echoes its Hobbesian conception, and is reminiscent of Carl Schmitt's notion of the political and of democracy. In 2015, this conception was pitted against the supremacy of the Constitution (legal sovereignty) and the ideal of shared sovereignty. Drawing on 20 parliamentary debates, this paper shows that the 2015 Polish constitutional crisis encapsulates a conflict of sovereignty over who holds the most legitimate representation of the people and who should have the last word in key political conflicts and constitutional settlements.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/342458/3/ComanCEP2022.pdf\n\nStanding up against autocratization across political regimes\n\nTomini, L., Gibril, S., & Bochev, V. (2022). Standing up against autocratization across political regimes: a comparative analysis of resistance actors and strategies. Democratization. doi:10.1080/13510347.2022.2115480\n\nResistance against autocratization is a neglected area of inquiry. Although we have solid knowledge of the structural pre-conditions, modalities, and patterns of autocratization, as well as the motivations and strategies used by authoritarian actors, very little is known about the actors resisting autocratization and their strategies. This article provides an answer to the following questions: why does resistance against autocratization matter and why do we need to address it? How to define it? Who are the actors involved and what are the main strategies adopted? This article contributes to the current debate on autocratization by providing a detailed discussion on the topic of resistance and a definition that can be operationalized for empirical research. It also addresses this issue in a comparative perspective by analysing resistance against autocratization across different types of political regimes, therefore overcoming the narrow focus on democratic backsliding in democratic regimes. Eventually, based on the analysis of selected cases of successful resistance, we conclude by formulating working hypotheses to be further investigated on the density of resistance networks and the shifting nature of resistance when moving from democracy to authoritarianism.\n\nhttps://dipot.ulb.ac.be/dspace/bitstream/2013/350235/3/Standingup.pdf\n\nEndiguer la vague.
