I was wondering if any of you can show me the best, the funniest comedy films that are not in English!\n\nI'll start with one I saw earlier this year:\n\nJapanese: Welcome Back, Mr McDonald\n\nReally funny comedy that's virtually a stageplay given how limited its locations are. It's about the very troubled production of a late night radio drama, where clashing egos and logic inconsistencies result in a wild ride of collaborative storytelling. Very amusing movie to watch late in the night.\n\nTakashi Miike's Happiness of the Katakuris.\n\nIt's a Japanese comedy/musical about a family who start a bnb and have to deal with all their guests dying.\n\nIt's much funnier and more joyful than it sounds. I first saw it at a film festival and it probably took me half an hour after exiting the theater to stop grinning and chuckling.\n\nLast I looked it was free on Tubi.\n\nHave some French movies!\n\n- Les Tontons Flingueurs (absolute classic starring Lino Ventura, a 1960s comedy about the French mob)\n\n- Les Visiteurs (Jean Reno & Christian Clavier play a medieval lord and peasant respectively, who are transported to modern-day (90s) France, incredibly silly hijinx ensue. Got a 2001 English-language remake titled Just Visiting that was so awful it almost bankrupted the production company)\n\n- Astérix & Obélix : Mission Cléopâtre (the best of all the live-action Astérix movies, stars a murderers row of legendary French comedic actors, but may be slightly inaccessible due to it being a pop-culture comedy with a lot of French references)\n\nHave some French movies!\n\n- Les Tontons Flingueurs (absolute classic starring Lino Ventura, a 1960s comedy about the French mob)\n\n- Les Visiteurs (Jean Reno & Christian Clavier play a medieval lord and peasant respectively, who are transported to modern-day (90s) France, incredibly silly hijinx ensue)\n\n- Astérix & Obélix : Mission Cléopâtre (the best of all the live-action Astérix movies, stars a murderers row of legendary French comedic actors, but may be slightly inaccessible due to it being a pop-culture comedy with a lot of French references)\n\nI'll also add: Le Diner des Cons.\n\nView: https://youtu.be/LECeBFUOaGM\n\nI don't know how it holds up today, but I saw The Intouchables ages ago and liked it. Is it a well known movie?\n\nView: https://youtu.be/34WIbmXkewU\n\nExtremely famous movie, and deservedly so. It's very good.\n\nAlso, if OP is looking for more modern movies, the first two OSS 117 films (Cairo Nest of Spies and Lost in Rio) are incredibly funny spy spoofs. Avoid the third at all costs.\n\nA true classic. It was part of my original selection but I figured 3 movies was ideal ^^\n\nGot a lesser US remake as Dinner For Schmucks.\n\nAlso, if OP is looking for more modern movies, the first two OSS 117 films are incredibly funny spy spoofs. Avoid the third at all costs.\n\nAge matters not as long as they're still funny!\n\nI appreciate all the recommendations so far! Lots of great-looking films I hadn't heard of before. Les Visiteurs/The Visitors in particular looks like something my mum might love!\n\nAge matters not as long as they're still funny!\n\nSome movies age poorly :/\n\nThe weird thing is that some of the more recent big French comedies have aged even worse (as anyone who's seen the third OSS 117 or Mais qu'est-ce qu'on a fait au bon Dieu Can attest ^^')\n\nIt's been a few years since I've seen it, and I'll have to give it a watch again soon. But it had me rolling around laughing when I first saw it.\n\nOh my god, it took me a while as I was going through the trailer, but I realised I've seen a Hindi adaptation of this. It's also pretty decent, though I watched that a lifetime ago. It got a sequel set on a cruise and island, but that one was insufferable.\n\nOh my god, it took me a while as I was going through the trailer, but I realised I've seen a Hindi adaptation of this.

There used to be so much plagiarism before the Internet became a thing. Stories, songs, aesthetics, right down to the editing and direction, everything was fair game. 😄\n\nI've heard the Hindi remake of Oldboy is almost shot-for-shot in many places, but naturally it shies away from any of the actually transgressive elements of the original. Had to keep it palatable for the Indian audience (and censors)!\n\nPost-2010, in the age of social media, it's much harder to get away with plagiarism, so adaptations are usually licensed, which also means there's fewer of them now.\n\nOh my god, it took me a while as I was going through the trailer, but I realised I've seen a Hindi adaptation of this. It's also pretty decent, though I watched that a lifetime ago.

Unapoletically excessive and trashy but if you can get into the vibe it's a great time.\n\nAlso, if OP is looking for more modern movies, the first two OSS 117 films (Cairo Nest of Spies and Lost in Rio) are incredibly funny spy spoofs. Avoid the third at all costs.\n\nAlso these. Love these movies. Wonderfully written and Jean Dujardin is marvelous but the comedy of of the films even extends to the way its shot and edited.\n\nIn fairness, it's been a while since I've seen it, so it may notnhold up, but I went through a period where I was obsessed with Wild Zero, a 2000 Japanese comedy horror movie partly focusing around real-world rock band Guitar Wolf who star as themselves in a story about a zombie outbreak induced by an alien invasion.

It's about the very troubled production of a late night radio drama, where clashing egos and logic inconsistencies result in a wild ride of collaborative storytelling. Very amusing movie to watch late in the night.\n\nHahahaha, this is what I thought to suggest when I saw the thread. Just an absolutely charming movie.\n\nSurvive Style 5+\n\nPure hilarious insanity, but this trailer doesn't really sell it as there's no context to anything shown:\n\nView: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LEH7nDkiPEk\n\nKikujiru\n\nA favourite of mine about a young boy trying to cross Japan to find his mum and a washed up gangster accompanies him:\n\nView: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vCg6zJC-Ubo\n\nCastaway on the Moon\n\nA romantic comedy about loneliness. A man tries to kill himself by jumping off a bridge in the middle of the city but wakes up on shore a tiny island in the middle of the city river. Decides to live there.\n\nView: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=061ZyqHhdCo\n\nFish Story\n\nA crazy anthology film where a comet is about to destroy the earth but a song released decades ago by a washed up Japanese band might just save the world.\n\nView: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WppQoL7OAbU\n\nHave some Czech films!\n\nFour Murders is Enough Darling.\n\nA dying spy hides something in an average schmuck's apartment, and suddenly various agencies are killing each other trying to get it, and he keeps winding up being blamed for it, leading everyone to think he's a sexy man of action and danger.\n\nView: https://youtu.be/y6FF9lOXlsY\n\nThe Mysterious Castle in the Carpathians.\n\nA comedy/fantasy with people finding a mad scientist's castle and attempting to thwart his evil plans. Some really fantastic fantasy sets and gadgets in this.\n\nSouth korean soldier, north korean soldier and a shot-down american pilot meet in a very remote little village in the mountains. It's part anti-war movie part comedy. Somehow it works.\n\nPost office worker from the city is send to the countryside, where he barely understands the people, because of their dialect.\n\nTreasure hunt for a sunken treasure, with a really idiotic but funny band of thieves, that don't know anything about boats or the sea.\n\nWeird people living in a weird house within a weird scenario.\n\nI haven't watched this in fifteen years, but I think it probably still holds up.\n\nSlim Susie is a swedish hillbilly crime comedy about a guy returning from the big city to his small hometown located in the middle of nowhere to try to find his missing sister. It's somewhat akin to a Coen brothers film, and is both very funny and a tad bittersweet.\n\nI don't know how available it is outside of Sweden, but I think it might be on Netflix. There will be some references that will be impossible to understand if you're not swedish, but for the most part it should be fine.\n\nTuva Novotny who plays Susie has a family with Alexander Skarsgård, and honestly I'm just a tiny bit jealous of him. She is amazing.\n\nJuzo Itami is a great director to check out. Tampopo is his most famous but I think Supermarket Woman is my favourite.\n\nView: https://youtu.be/sur_pxcpuoE\n\nIt's less laugh out loud and more amusing, but Jacques Tati's Playtime is an incredible achievement in filmmaking. The set was so big it had its own power plant.\n\n- YouTube\n\nEnjoy the videos and music you love, upload original content, and share it all with friends, family, and the world on YouTube.\n\nPlaytime is an incredible achievement in filmmaking.\n\nPlaytime is wildly impressive. It's one of those films where you can just freezframe on random and likely get something you could hang on a wall.\n\nIt's tragicomedy and German film\n\nI really liked this when it came out. I should probably do a rewatch."
