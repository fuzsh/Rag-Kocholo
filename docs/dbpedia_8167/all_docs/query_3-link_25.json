I am here again to give you another compilation of French movies which will not just provide daily entertainment, but will also provide you with an insight in the world of French cinéma.\n\nAt this point, you may already be becoming familiar with what distinguishes French cinema from the films of other cultures. I’d love to add to this, however, by providing you with another 31 movies- one for each day of July!\n\nIf you'd love to have a longer list, then the FREE e-book 365 Days of French Movies is perfect for you.\n\nDay 1: Diabolique\n\nDirected by: Henri-Georges Clouzot\n\nWritten by: Henri-Georges Clouzot and Jérome Geronimi\n\nYear: 1955\n\nSource: IMDb\n\nThe story revolves around a provincial boarding school run by sadistic headmaster, Michel Delasalle. After being murdered by his wife and mistress, strange events being to plague the school, but what is their origin?\n\nThis film might be an old one, but there are no thrillers like Diabolique. Critics regard this movie to be above many comparable psychological thrillers because of its unusual attention to characterisation and the physical details of the setting. With its unpredictable narrative twists and horrifying images and ambiance, this film brought its director, Henri-Georges Clouzot, universal acclaim and made him the legendary “French Hitchcock”.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 2: Le Salaire de la peur (The Wages of Fear)\n\nDirected by: Henri-Georges Clouzot\n\nWritten by: Henri-Georges Clouzot and Jérome Geronimi\n\nYear: 1953\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nAnother movie created by the legendary “French Hitchcock”, La Salaire de la peur. The Wages of Fear is a 1953 French film noir based on Georges Arnaud macho novel about the lives of the men who transport explosives for oil companies. The movie is purposely divided into two halves. The first, more slow paced half, explores the motivations of such men, and the greed and exploitation that entrap them The second part being a tense and suspenseful rollercoaster as the men drive through the mountains with their precarious cargo.\n\nTough and cynical, the film is ahead of its time in showing the brutal tactics of oil companies in developing countries. It is not an easy watch, money is shown as the primary motivating factor for all protagonists, but it’s a compelling film that will have you on the edge of your seat nonetheless.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 3: Violette\n\nDirected and written by: Martin Provost\n\nYear: 2013\n\nSource: Allocine\n\nNow to a more contemporary movie, Violette is a French biographical drama and the formation of the early French feminist novelist Violette Leduc.\n\nIn particular, it portrays the relationship between her and the renowned philosopher Simone de Beauvior, and how the lives and ideas of these two important women impacted on each other. This biopic presents issues such as sexuality, abortion, homosexuality, self-identity and women’s insecurities. This movie is not just beautifully crafted and executed, but the exceptional acting and story plot will also captivate your heart.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 4: La Commune\n\nDirected by: Peter Watkins\n\nWritten by: Peter Watkins and Agathe Bluysen\n\nYear: 2000\n\nSource: IMDb\n\nA critical and audacious film, La Commune is an unusual documentary-style, historical drama about the legendary Paris Commune of 1871. Peter Watkins, a noted filmmaker and critic, explores the fractured French political system in Paris during the Franco-Prussian war in his epic (6 hour) film. Although, this movie was greatly criticized for the unorthodox format it uses, the thought-provoking ‘breaking news’ style will take you back to the history of the revolutionary euphoria and of the radicalization of the working class in Paris. Moreover, this film presents a cynical critique of modern media and our contemporary perspectives of French society.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 5: Le Cercle Rouge (The Red Circle)\n\nDirected and written by: Jean-Pierre Melville\n\nYear: 1970\n\nSource: Cinefil\n\nLe Cercle Rouge is a 1970 French film about a former prisoner, an escaped convict, and an alcoholic former cop getting together to pull off an elaborate jewellery heist. However, Police inspector Mattei (Bourvil) will use all means at his disposal to stop them.\n\nThis volley of action, stunts, running, physical dexterity and frantic chases has one cool scene after another. On top of this,, this masterpiece is more than a story of heists and crimes, as Michael Mann would later emulate, the film examines the nature of crooks, and the men who hunt them down. More than just a thriller, this is a meditation on machismo, and a clear influence on contemporary directors such as Quentin Tarantino.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 6: Vivre Sa Vie (My Life to Live)\n\nDirected by: Jean-Luc Godard\n\nWritten by: Jean-Luc Godard and Marcel Sacotte\n\nYear: 1962\n\nSource: movieposters\n\nAn exploration to a Parisian woman’s descent into prostitution, Vivre Sa Vie is composed of twelve unconnected episodes, each presented with an introduction and brief summary, about the life of Nana (Anna Karina).\n\nThis innovative use of sound and vision is a clever device the director uses to explore and the outwardly beautiful but flawed and exploitative consumerist culture of that time in Paris: a seedy of cinemas, coffee bars, neon-lit pool halls, pop records, photographs, posters, pinball machines, jukeboxes. foreign cars, etc, etc… The film, is not just an unsettling critique of the sex-trade, it’s an existentialist exposition of the materialistic life that the world is currently living.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 7: La Cage aux Folles\n\nDirected and written by: Édouard Molinaro\n\nYear: 1978\n\nSource: Cinemapassion\n\nBe gay and fabulous while watching this comical, international musical sensation depicting the hilarious events that occur when a gay man attempts to pose as a straight one for the sake of his son’s future.

It is probable that you were living with your family, studying in schools like the other children in the neighbourhood, and playing freely, in short, you are living a perfectly normal life: unlike the girls in this surreal movie Innocence. You might be confused at first on why a (living) six year old girl will arrive inside a coffin but that is only one of the mysteries to uncover in this dark gothic fairy-tale. The girls are carefully handpicked and taken from their families at a very young age for unknown reasons. They are kept in a remote boarding school under the governance of two teachers, and mainly taught and trained with ballet and biology. They are ranked according to their age, which are shown through ribbons in their hair. But why?\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 9:A Prophet\n\nDirected by: Jacques Audiard\n\nWritten by: Jacques Audiard, Thomas Bidegain, Abdel Raouf Dafri, Nicolas Peufaillit\n\nYear: 2009\n\nSource: Ogisteproductions\n\nAnother award-winning movie, A Prophet showcases a great story about Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim) a young part Arab, part Corsican petty criminal. He arrives in the jail entirely alone and, because of his young age and ignorance, disadvantaged. However, his initiation into Corsican and Muslim subcultures, bravery and quick wit rise in the inmate community. This movie explores the connections between the brutal prison system and violent radical Islamic subculture prevalent in some parts of Europe. Although Audiard claimed that it is a fictional, it is easy for the viewers to draw their own parallels between violence, prison and gang warfare and extremism. It is also a film for any crime-flick fans looking for a great story.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 10: Le Million (The Million)\n\nDirected and written by: René Clair\n\nYear: 1931\n\nSource: Moviepostershop\n\nA hilarious movie from the 1930s; that takes us on a trip to the glory days of the ‘music hall’ school of entertainment.

Will he find it in time to claim the money? This is the major problem our leading man is facing, and he is ready to take any risk to find that small piece of paper.\n\nClair has this determined chase of one small, but important ticket accompanied with a light-hearted selection of theatrical dialogue sang by the actors and actresses. As a whole, the film might not match the technological perfection of contemporary movies, but it was still be regarded as a sophisticated masterpiece from the first true master of the ’talkie’.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 11: Cyrano de Bergerac\n\nDirected by: Jean-Paul Rappeneau\n\nWritten by: Jean-Paul Rappeneau, Jean-Claude Carrière, Edmond Rostand\n\nYear: 1990\n\nSource: Flickfacts\n\nDo you believe in true love? This may sound cheesy to cynics, but for hopeless romantics out there, you will find yourself relating to Cyrano de Bergerac, as he uses his passion to become a bridge to the happiness of the woman he loves. Cyrano is a brilliant swordsman, with a gift for words and poetry, but deprived of physical attractiveness by his enormous nose, and is therefore doomed by his insecurities to be forever lonely. Put into the position of helping his less eloquent friend win the heart of a woman both men love, he must decide between friendship and romance, risk and safety. The romanticism of Cyrano de Bergerac will make you fall in love and break your heart at the same time.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 12: Un long dimanche de fiançailles (A very long engagement)\n\nDirected by: Jean-Pierre Jeunet\n\nWritten by: Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Guillaume Laurant\n\nYear: 2004\n\nSource: Cinema\n\nAfter moving your heart with Cyrano’s tragedy, watch another lost-soul searching for that most elusive of emotions, happiness, Set during the aftermath of WW1, this concerns a young woman desperately searching for her missing-in-action fiancée. Part romantic drama, part mystery, and part war film, this unusual and sumptuously filmed movie offers something for everyone.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 13: Jeux d’enfants (Love Me if You Dare)\n\nDirected by: Yann Samuell\n\nwritten by: Yann Samuell and Jacky Cukier\n\nYear: 2004\n\nSource: Crazyhdsource\n\nThe third romantic movie for the week, Jeux d'Enfants is about the lives of two alienated people trapped in an increasingly complex and irresponsible game of dare. Maturing in style as the characters age and develop, this multi-layered and often cynical film shows the lengths some people will go to protect themselves from emotional vulnerability. Not a ‘Hollywood’ style wacky comedy, the characters are selfish and sometimes cruel, but nonetheless one which shows uncomfortable truths about the complexities of male/female relationships.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 14: Mesrine: Killer Instinct\n\nDirected by: Jean-François Richet\n\nWritten by: Jean-François Richet and Abdel Raouf Dafri\n\nYear: 2008\n\nSource: Listal\n\nFor numbers 14 and 15, let us dedicate two days to the gangster biopic of the infamous Jacques Mesrine. The first part, Mesrine: Killer Instinct, is about Jacques’ roots as a low-level thug involved in burglary and racketeering, which he perceived to be preferable to the life of a manual labourer. Tough, ruthless and resourceful, he climbs the ranks, delighted to have the opportunity to rebel against a government he distrusts.\n\nThe movie was received well by critics and movie viewers because of the exhilarating performance of Vincent Cassel. It also captured the rush of a criminal’s life, wherein a man do whatever he wanted and take whatever he wanted, simply because he is capable of doing it.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 15: Mesrine:Public Enemy #1\n\nDirected and written by: Jean-François Richet\n\nYear: 2008\n\nSource: Cidenet\n\nNow to the second part of our gangster epic; which explores the later years of this complex and divisive character’s life. Mesrine was declared as France’s Public Enemy #1 when he kidnapped a judge and received a maximum penalty in a maximum-security prison. While in prison, he wrote his memoirs and began to establish himself as a household name. Upon escape, he resumes his gleeful mayhem. What puts this film into a league of its own, isn’t the gangsterism, but its depiction of how Mesrine learnt to control the media, an arch manipulator, he remains a divisive figure in France to this day.\n\nThe two movies portraying the life of Mesrine will show you the twin faces of crime, both the power and the rush of success, and the heavy price paid in achieving it.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nSpeak, Listen, and Write French like a Native with Talk in French Complete Courses\n\nLearn French on your own terms with our comprehensive, self-paced beginner, intermediate, and advanced courses, each with a step-by-step plan tailored to your level.\n\nMaster French pronunciation and sound like a native with our pronunciation course.\n\nReceive personalized feedback and guidance from a dedicated French teacher.\n\nDay 16: 13 Tzameti\n\nDirected and written by: Géla Babluani\n\nYear:2005\n\nSource: Taringa\n\nDesperate for money, an aimless young man takes the identity of another, a decision that takes him into a brutal world where rich men gamble with the lives of the dispossessed.\n\nA stark black and white thriller about the cruelty of men, which shows the relationship between money, power and cruelty in the most disturbing way imaginable.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nSpeak, Listen, and Write French like a Native with Talk in French Complete Courses\n\nLearn French on your own terms with our comprehensive, self-paced beginner, intermediate, and advanced courses, each with a step-by-step plan tailored to your level.\n\nMaster French pronunciation and sound like a native with our pronunciation course.\n\nReceive personalized feedback and guidance from a dedicated French teacher.\n\nDay 17: La Pianiste (The Piano Teacher)\n\nDirected and written by: Michael Haneke\n\nYear: 2001\n\nSource: D.ratingmovies\n\nA controversial yet interesting exploration of human psychology, La Pianiste uses Freudian principles about female sexuality, and how they relate to masochism and sadism. La Pianiste is one of a new wave of sexual explicit films in European cinema where sado-masochistic relationships are explicitly expressed. Intentionally disturbing and unerotic, it is an unsettling depiction of the depths lonely people can reach in their quest for fulfilment.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 18: Les Bien-aimés (The Beloved)\n\nDirected and written by: Christophe Honoré\n\nYear: 2011\n\nSource: D.ratingmovies\n\nIs it better to love or to be loved? Director Christophe Honore presents the complicated love-life of a mother and a daughter in his movie Les Bien-aimes. Both the mother and the daughter are experiencing similar dilemma - they’re trapped in a love triangle. Light, yet engaging, this movie chronicles the characters’ lives and loves from the 60’s to the present day. The radiant background and plot of Les Bien- aimes are made even livelier by the frequent musical interludes (though Director Honore did not categorize it as a musical.)\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 19: Le Havre\n\nDirected and written by: Aki Kaurismaki\n\nYear: 2011\n\nSource: Msoundtracks\n\nAn aging shoe-shiner helps a young immigrant to the port of Le Havre, achieve his dreams.

Whether this is a movie or a documentary is debateable; it did pay dividends for the likeable star though, who has gained cult status once more.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 21: Ne le Dis à Personne (Tell No One)\n\nDirected by: Guillaume Canet\n\nWritten by: Guillaume Canet and Philippe Lefebvre\n\nYear: 2006\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nTell no one tells the story of a bereaved doctor whose attempts to get his life back are thrown into chaos when two further bodies are discovered near to where his wife was murdered.

Set in an anachronistic world where men were men, women were admiring and foreigners were shifty stereotypes, this wild satire has great fun at the expense of the Bond movies. Never knowingly politically-correct, its absurd humour will appeal to anyone who’s ever watched a thriller and shouted in exasperation at the illogicality of the plot.\n\nAvailable on Netflix: No (DVD only) or Amazon Instant Video\n\nDay 23: Indigenes (Days of Glory)\n\nDirected by: Rachid Bouchareb\n\nWritten by: Olivier Morelle and Rachnid Bouchareb\n\nYear: 2006\n\nSource: Xyface\n\nFor a long time, it was rare to find a movie depicting the brave sacrifice of the North African soldiers who fought for France during the World War II.
