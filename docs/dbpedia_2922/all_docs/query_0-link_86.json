The aim is to invite COSPAR Associates to publish essays expressing their opinions and positions on the important topics that affect international cooperation in space research and to publish comments on the essays. Comments on each published essay are also encouraged and should be submitted in time for publication in the next issue of Space Research Today. Essays should be submitted to the Editor by 1 February, 1 June or 1 October for publication in the subsequent issue. Len Fisk The Climate Crisis: A Time of Peril. A Time to Act. The climate of Earth is changing, imperiled by the relentless emission of greenhouse gases from our advancing civilization. The evidence of climate change is obvious to all except those who, for their own reasons, choose to remain oblivious. The Arctic sea ice cover is disappearing, creating land and sea conditions never experienced in human history. Sea levels are rising, imperiling coastal communities where much of humanity resides. Precipitation patterns are changing, resulting in long periods of drought, imperiling our sources of food and reducing habitable locations. There is a growing recognition of the need for action. The nations of the world have adopted the Paris Agreement, an international treaty on climate change, and pledged actions intended to limit global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius; actions that may not be sufficient, commitments that may not be fully met, but nonetheless, the Agreement and its adoption make a clear statement that action is needed. The United States government, which under its previous President withdrew from its commitments to act on climate change, is now, under its new President, fully committed by policy and action to address the climate crisis. Multi-national corporations, whether because their businesses are imperiled by climate change, or they sense economic opportunities, or they simply wish to be responsible corporations, are altering their business practices to address the climate crisis. The international science community, which for decades has warned of the pending climate crisis, is now realizing its worst fears; the climate is changing even more rapidly and with more pending disasters than were envisioned. At least, with its armada of orbiting satellites from many nations and ever more sophisticated modeling capabilities, if properly supported and coordinated, the international science community can predict with increasing accuracy the regional consequences of climate change and guide the inevitable adaptations that will be required. Moreover, guidance can be provided as to the effectiveness of mitigating actions, and to ensure that mitigating actions do not have unintended consequences. What is not fully appreciated is the urgency to act. The climate is changing rapidly. The damage caused by our past behavior is built into the climate system. Our window to take action, placing our planet on a path to being able to sustain our civilization, is closing. Delayed actions now will require more drastic and less likely to be successful actions in the future. We must replace vague promises to behave 3\n\nP:04\n\nresponsibly and the temptation to place the responsibility to act on some of us, as opposed to all of us, with a total commitment by the governments of the world and their people to address the existential threat of global climate change. We must with urgency mitigate the consequences of climate change that we still can and find ways to adapt to those we canât so that our generation and all future generations will have a planet that continues to sustain us. During the space race in the 1960s, competition between the United States and the Soviet Union yielded rapid progress in our capabilities to explore and use space, with each competing nation attempting through its demonstration of technological prowess to influence other nations and have them embrace its goals and objectives, even its form of government. The space race was not a race to a specific goal; rather, it was a competition for prestige and global influence, and it required massive investments, even transformations in economies, to succeed in this competition. The question then is whether we should encourage a competition for prestige and global influence on how best to address the climate crisis and whether doing so would motivate large investments and transformations to the economies of nations seeking this prestige and influence, resulting in more rapid progress in addressing the climate crisis. A competition for global influence would add a degree of self-interest for the competing nations rather than relying, as we do today, on encouraging their participation as an altruistic contribution to worldwide efforts to limit the damage from global climate change. Whatever the reasons for investing in addressing the climate crisis, whether it is for prestige and global influence, or out of a sense of responsibility, or in response to domestic or international pressure, it is essential that the accumulated investments are sufficient to protect the future of humanity. Nations with the resources and technical capabilities to address the climate crisis should share the technologies they are using with nations with fewer capabilities and be willing to provide resources to nations that are struggling to adapt to some of the worse impacts of climate change. The leaders of all nations should place the common interest to curb the emissions of greenhouse gases ahead of self-interest and lead their people accordingly. The religions of the world, whose teachings influence the actions of so many people, should encourage responsible behavior that will protect our planet from ourselves. The international science community, a model for how to cooperate when dealing with a global problem, should establish and promote a common understanding of the causes and consequences of global climate change and serve as an unbiased judge of the effectiveness and implications of our actions to mitigate and adapt. The international science community should harness the power of social media and spread the truth about global climate change and its consequences, and effectively dispel misinformation; the nations of the world should use social media to inform about actions being taken and commitments being made and achieved, along with their associated value. Never before in human history have we been faced with a more tenacious, more consequential threat to our way of life, to the progress our civilization has made, than the threat we are now experiencing from global climate change. We have global pandemics in which people die and economies are disrupted, as is now occurring. But pandemics can eventually be contained. Given the damage we have done to our climate and how difficult it will be to contain current and future damage, the climate crisis will be with us for a long time, and every person on Earth will be affected, directly or indirectly, profoundly impacting the trajectory of humanity. We are being called upon to act to address the climate crisis, with urgency, deliberately, and with guidance provided by science. For our sake and that of all future generations, we cannot fail to act. 4\n\nP:05\n\nCOSPAR Community Dr. Baker has published over 800 papers in the refereed literature and has edited nine books on In this section, we include profiles of COSPAR topics in space physics.
