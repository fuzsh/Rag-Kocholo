        "text": "Re-entry licensing in the United States is under the authority of the FAA. Under direction from the national space council, they recently finalized a streamlined regulatory process for both launch and re-entry activities, which you can read here (get cozy, it's a doozy).\n\nIf your goal is to be the manufacturer, you're probably better off working with a company that specializes in re-entry (see ideas below). That way you can avoid the nightmare of FAA licensing.\n\nSpace Stations\n\nDepending on your manufacturing process, this could be possible today. Companies regularly do research on the ISS and MadeInSpace and others are already doing manufacturing. If you go this route, you take advantage of the existing, proven ISS cargo infrastructure, with your equipment going up on any cargo launch and your products coming back on a SpaceX Cargo Dragon.\n\nThe easiest way to explore options here, especially for early experiments, would be to work with NanoRacks, which was launching racks of microgravity experiments to ISS before they started deploying CubeSats. Nanoracks, as well as Axiom Space, are also working on private space stations to continue this service after the ISS is retired.\n\nRe-entry capsules\n\nThere are companies working on re-entry capsules. I know SpaceWorks has made a lot of progress in this direction. If you aren't compatible with human space vehicles, they'd be good ones to talk to.\n\nReusable Launch Vehicles\n\nI've heard some reusable launch vehicle developers theorizing about using their vehicle for short-term microgravity missions. Imagine having a small factory on every Starlink satellite mission, activated after all satellites are released, with the upper stage returned only after production is complete."
