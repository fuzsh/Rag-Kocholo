        "text": "Friday Squid Blogging: Self-Repairing Fabrics Based on Squid Teeth\n\nReally:\n\nAs shown in the video below, researchers at Pennsylvania State University recently developed a polyelectrolyte liquid solution made of bacteria and yeast that automatically mends clothes.\n\nIt doesn’t have a name yet, but it’s almost miraculous. Simply douse two halves of a ripped fabric in the stuff, hold them together under warm water for about 60 seconds, and the fabric closes the gaps and clings together once more. Having a bit of extra fabric on hand does seem to help, as the video mainly focuses on patching holes rather than re-knitting two halves of a torn piece.\n\nThe team got the idea by observing how proteins in squid teeth and human hair are able to self-replicate. Then, they recreated the process using more readily available materials. Best of all, it works with almost all natural fabrics.\n\nAs usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.\n\nPosted on August 26, 2016 at 4:30 PM • 387 Comments\n\nSidebar photo of Bruce Schneier by Joe MacInnis."
