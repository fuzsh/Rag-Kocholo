In the summertime, it can be desolate, over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees C), and it reminds me of what I've imagined the real Death Valley in California to feel like on one of its cooler days. Because it diverges from the popular recreational lake, it is often deserted, and, being near a small airport where my runner friend had once flown me up in the air in what was to be his first \"solo\" flight, there is even an area next to the path where a small plane had once crashed. There are a few quail running around but few human runners out there, and sometimes the occasional cyclist will pass you by. Parallel with the left edge of the path is a string of tall wooden telephone poles that go off into an infinite vanishing point, and perched along long electrical wires, nearly equidistantly spaced, are several male red-winged blackbirds.\n\nIn the summer, as I would run along, I would hear them communicate with each other, and, to me, it is the most memorable bird call in the area. I don't encounter these birds 8 miles to the east in the hills past the bluffs where I live, where the robins, cardinals, hummingbirds, and doves dominate, but only in the prairie and marshy plains near the lake.\n\nIn my distance running trances I often notice patterns in things and compare the natural world to man-made machines, and so I am hyper-aware of the fact that they are sitting on electrical wires that are curved slightly due to gravity, and I often ponder the serendipity of their proximity to a small airport (artificial birds). But this superstitious congruence pales in comparison to an even more striking similarity--their vocal calls sound like AFSK (Audio Frequency Shift Keying) data transmissions. Some have described this sound as \"oak-a-leeeeeeee\" or \"conc-a-reeeeeee\". The first part sounds like some kind of initialization or ID, and it ends with a longer trill↗, a fast alternation between 2 frequencies, that \"eEeEeEeEe\" sound, like the roll of a tongue↗. Early, slower computer modems that used AFSK also performed a trill (alteration between two tones), which allows the transfer of information.\n\nI have had a lifelong fascination with birds as messengers, so as I hear these \"transmissions\", I visualize those birds as tiny communication nodes, in a peer-to-peer arrangement, balancing along a telephone wire, forwarding a message to each other along great distances. Sometimes it seems like my presence affects their call as I pass underneath their gaze. Are they warning others that there is a human in their territory? They have been known to aggressively dive bomb runners during their nesting season, but they never bothered me. I often wonder what information is encoded in that data stream and hope that one day we'll be able to translate their language. Human languages, and even many animal sounds, approximate the mysterious, fractal, power-law distribution known as Zipf's law.\n\nAnd why is their sound so fast and high-pitched? Even many intelligent larger animals like dolphins use fast, high-frequency sound in their whistles and clicks. Regardless of environmental or physical factors, in information theory, there is a unique benefit to higher-frequencies: they increase bandwidth, the amount of data that can be transmitted within a finite length of time. Human speech is lower frequency, by comparison. We can use words to convey complex meaning in compressed, symbolic ways, but could it be that some animals that lack words simply have no need for them since they transfer ideas directly, like texting a photograph to one another, a raw data transmission? Perhaps words are something our brains invented to compensate for this deficiency.\n\nI'm also fascinated with our primary source of energy, the Sun, and the clockwork-like orbits of its planetary bodies.\n\nEventually an idea began to coalesce that I could convert my earlier PacketRadio interface into a tiny, bird-sized node, sitting up high in the air, hence the name \"TrillSat\", akin to a tiny satellite (or a sitting bird), but earth-bound, not in orbit, which sends out an RF \"trill\" to other identical units sitting up high.\n\nI decided to begin working on a platform, a craft that would perch itself on wires attached to trees, able to communicate with other craft like itself, powered by the Sun, which climbs and lowers, rolling along a spiral axis as it trots along, the tilting of panels like the flapping wings of those birds, as a planetary mass changes it attitude.\n\nI began building TRILLSAT.\n\nT ethered\n\nR adio\n\nI nterfaced\n\nL aterally\n\nL eveled\n\nS piral\n\nA xis\n\nT racker\n\n(Click diagram to enlarge)\n\nThe Importance of Communicating When You Can't\n\nA few months after I began this project, in May 2016, a strong thunderstorm came through and took down part of our power grid for around 24 hours, and in March 2017, the same thing happened to a lesser extent, and my only communication was via my smartphone to some cell towers (which luckily were still in operation). Those birds that I mentioned took shelter during the storm, and after the storm passed, they flew back to those wires. They didn't care if those wires were energized or not, but they kept chirping, kept communicating. They are mobile, self-powered, self-balancing, peer-to-peer communication nodes.\n\nBut back at home at night, I was in darkness, with no heating or a/c, no refrigeration to keep my food preserved. Even my wireless landline telephone was down since many of its systems required power, even though their data lines were still up. All I had was the power in a few tiny USB powerbanks (which I had neglected to keep fully charged), flashlight batteries, my handheld AmateurRadio, and my smartphone. I also had my car, with its gasoline-fueled alternator that kept the lead-acid battery charged and could charge my smartphone via my 12-volt USB adapter as long as the fuel held out. Getting out of that dark house and driving around with the radio on gave me some semblance of civilization, although the roads were often covered in downed branches.\n\nLuckily, I still had those emergency channels, the cell towers were still on the air and not overloaded, and I could still text my family and friends to find out if they were affected, but this would only last as long as my batteries held out. Just checking the electrical company's website was slow and drained a lot of power to determine which areas were affected and what the estimated downtime would be.\n\nI live in a dispersed society in the wide expanses of the Midwest United States in the sense that my friends, family, and business functions are units separated by distances of many miles. Electronic communication and online shopping now removes the need for many of us to leave our homes and meet each other, so many of us keep in touch or do our work via the Internet, e-mail and text messaging.\n\nBut when you lose those communication channels, you get a harsh reminder of just how big the world is and just how far away you are. If you lose your water source (which we did a few times due to aging infrastructure) then you have to quickly find some, and the nearby stores will sell out of bottled water quickly. We live near the confluence of two giant rivers which provide us with abundant water, but those two rivers can also flood and meander around my city, essentially trapping us and forcing most of the traffic through the bottlenecks of our highway bridges. This would quickly gridlock and just won't cut it in a major disaster.\n\nHurricane Matthew hit Haiti in early October 2016, when I was working on this project, causing widespread loss of electricity and communication. I was well aware of this monster, as I was attending amateur radio classes at the time and passed my General Class license exam just six weeks later. Emergency communication is a mainstay of amateur radio, but I have to admit, I'm more the reclusive tinkerer type that likes to work on the systems and electronics; I don't volunteer my time like many other hams do. Instead, I focus on the things I can build, which is still \"advancing the art of radio\" I suppose, but it is indirect. I greatly value the work of those that provide the direct benefits of emergency communications when needed.\n\nBut I began to realize that this project could have solved my entire communication problem, allowing me to maintain wireless texting communication indefinitely, even if those cell towers, the Internet, and the power lines were down; even if my car ran out of fuel. All it needed was a distributed network of crafts like itself (and packet radio and APRS repeaters would help). Of course, the hams have done these kinds of things for decades, but, as far as I know, not in this particular way with a robotic, spiral tracking system and the interfacing of old and new low-cost technologies. It doesn't have to be a ham radio project at all. The packet radio could be substituted with a long range consumer protocol such as an ESP32 LoRa module (which has both benefits and drawbacks, but I wanted to further investigate the old Packet and AX.25 systems that pre-dated the World Wide Web and push it as far as I could, and there are a lot of hams out there that still have the equipment to interoperate with it. I missed out on its golden age in the 1990's as I turned my attention to the Internet--now I want to see what I missed.\n\nThe Tree-Climbing \"Satellite\"\n\nSo the idea is to elevate the electronics of a radio communication satellite, not into space, but just high enough above the earth to be useful, keeping the current draw as low as possible, keeping the unit small, lightweight, inexpensive, and weatherproof, and allow it to self-elevate, while at the same time, keeping it out of the shade (to allow for solar power).\n\nOne of the interesting things about trees is that they have the same need as this craft--they need to absorb solar energy, and so they branch out to collect more of it, shaping our forests in complex patterns. But they don't just blindly compete, as trees in different situations adapt differently. But in some cases, when competing nearby trees start to block the sun, trees will grow straight up, to get as high as possible into the canopy and out of the shade to collect sunlight. Even a solitary tree may grow tall which will keep its upper branches from shading the lower ones, but a tall tree can also allow more leaves to be illuminated. So trees tend to get very tall, which provides the elevation needed for VHF/UHF line-of-sight radio signals.\n\nOne problem with trees is that they block RF energy, and you can't just hang a solar panel on one because it will be in the shade (or eventually become shaded as the tree grows). Leaves are good at absorbing light, which is made up of high-frequency radio waves, and they also absorb some of the lower-frequency 2-meter/70 mm radio signals. So while the summertime produces the most light for a solar panel, it also causes leaves to grow which attenuates some of the signals the radio sends and receives, and this pattern reverses itself in the winter. So it is ideal to get the unit away from the tree.\n\nFixed-tilt solar panels in the northern hemisphere work best when they are tilted to the south, toward the equator, at an angle usually around the same value as the latitude. In St. Louis, where I live, this latitude is 38.6 degrees.\n\nSailing a Tether Sea\n\nThe tether is one of those things that has always intrigued me. In our material world, we don't seem to have superpowers; we can't levitate objects through psychokinesis, and we can't fly. We can't stretch out our arms like rubber bands and grab things far away, we can't leap tall buildings in a single bound like superman... But, if we cheat a little, and use very thin and long pieces of the material world, tethers, we can mimic that superpower.\n\nAs I child, I loved fishing with my grandfather and was a good caster, winning an award at my school camp. But when I was home in the suburbs, I used to tie magnets to string and fish metal objects in my room. Then I started expanding this concept and realized that I could attach motors and lights to electrical wires, and so I drove tiny electric cars (old 1970's toys with dead batteries that my neighbor gave me which I hard-wired) around on tethers. I lowered light bulbs into our storm sewers to look around. I flew kites that I modified with Christmas tree light bulbs and 9v batteries, raising them high into the night sky. And one day, I reached the pinnacle of child engineering and built a message-passing gondola system over my neighbor's house to my friend's 2-story window using hundreds of feet of high-strength monofilament fishing line.\n\nMy brother and I loved to swing on our disc swings each day, polypropylene rope tethered to tree branches. We played tetherball against each other for years and became very good at it. And I used to fly electric planes and helicopters on tethered wires, as wireless electric RC flying vehicles were not available during my childhood due to less advanced magnet and battery technology. In cub scouts, I competed in the Space Derby, the \"flying\" analog to the Pinewood Derby, wooden spaceships with propellers that were guided along tethers. And of course, Spiderman was my favorite childhood superhero, a boy scientist who used chemical tethers to scale buildings. I didn't like Batman as much. Although Batman had his grappling hooks, somehow this seemed inconsistent with his character--he was a bat, not a spider. And in the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, I was well aware that his space transmitter used a tether, connected to a swaying tree, of all things, that produced power...\n\nWhen I was in my teens, I began designing floating RC vessels that I could steer out on a lake, and fantasized about lowering a camera into the depths (telepresence), but I never continued with those ideas. Decades later, however, I resumed working on RobotDesigns that used tethers, hugely unappreciated machines, often called \"winch\" or \"hoist\" robots.\n\nAs I started to imagine this project, I wondered, \"How do I get the entire unit up into the sky?\". I thought about High-Altitude Ballooning, but they don't remain stationary, and regulations won't allow me to just moor a tethered balloon high in the air forever. Quadcopters/drones are noisy and use huge amounts of power. But those birds... those birds just sit on the wires and chirp.\n\nBack to those tethers.\n\nThe epiphany occurred after I quickly calculated that at 38.6 degrees in the Northern Hemisphere, a rope tied to a branch high up in a tree can be pulled out toward the southern sun and staked into the ground away from the tree, in perfect alignment for solar panels. And I had just such a tree in my yard, known as the \"Tree of Heaven\" a tenacious tree native to China and written about in ancient Chinese literature, but semi-invasive in my state of Missouri, the same tree depicted in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith. I live in an older, inner ring suburb, and this tree probably gained root in my semi-urban environment.\n\nUnfortunately, at low latitudes, the tangent function in trigonometry tells us that the opposite side of the right triangle quickly grows much longer than the adjacent side (the height) if you increase the angle, approaching infinity. So this would only practical at relatively high latitudes. Raising the height (increasing the adjacent side) also increases the length (the opposite side) more than a 45 degree angle. At my latitude, a rope tied 40 feet up will require 50 horizontal feet away from the tree.\n\nBecause this rope leaves the tree at an angle, it will eventually leave the shade and reach full illumination if the angle is correct (as long as there isn't anything else higher around blocking the sun). Wonderful, I thought.\n\nSo I began designing my craft to traverse an angled tether. Although very different in materials, purpose, and design, it brought back fond memories of Gantenbrink's Upuat-2 robot climbing the mysterious angled shaft in the Great Pyramid of Giza in the early 1990's, since the Upuat, coincidentally, also had to traverse almost the same upward angle and used a rope-climber mechanism. The Upuat was also beautifully symbolic of the mysterious journey of building complicated things such as robots themselves; such a journey is as if you are walking through a dark tunnel of hidden physics until you bump into one of its walls.\n\nBut unlike the shaft in the pyramids, a weighted tether can never be perfectly straight, as physics tells us this would require infinite force--there will always be a catenary curve to some degree.\n\nConnecting a rope or synthetic line high up in a tree is not as difficult as it seems. Just tie the end of the rope to a weight and throw it up into the tree. It will often wrap itself around a branch, and if you are lucky, you can lower this weight back to the ground. You can then create a slipknot and pull this up to the tree to secure the line.\n\nOf course, one could also lift a pulley up into the tree to create a \"gondola\", which could be used to hoist the radio high into the air like raising a flag on a flagpole, but I wanted this unit to be self-propelled and self-contained, so I built a hoist mechanism into the unit itself which would have to be powerful, yet light enough to lift its own weight up that sloping triangle on along its catenary arc.\n\nI soon realized that much of the design problems were similar to the problems that a ship or vessel at sea encounters, as a craft hanging on a 1-dimensional tether behaves in many ways like ships at sea, in this case a sea of rope, and the same types of stabilization techniques can be considered (flywheel stabilization, masts/sails, keels). The vessel does not float in water however, so buoyancy is out of the equation, but it tilts toward port (left) and starboard (right) sides like a ship, and has some similarities to a gondola lift and cable car, yet in this case the cable is stationary and the motor is on-board. But it also shares similarities with \"airships\", which float in air, such as zeppelins or dirigibles. Instead of a keel, they have weighted \"gondolas\". It's interesting that they also chose to name the zeppelin undercarriage a gondola when it really isn't a cabled gondola. And zeppelins share something else in common--they hung radio antennae from them, a design now known to hams as the \"zepp\" antenna, which I explored for use on this craft.\n\nIn January, 2018, while performing the final programming, I watched the 2015 documentary Sky Line for the first time and noted similarities to the \"space elevator\" of science-fiction. One of the engineers even mentioned the peculiar design similarities between spacecraft and underwater craft. And I also built a haptic communication system using the tether itself, so it really is a distinct medium.\n\nI have lived my entire life in the land-locked center of the United States and nautical hobbies are hard to cultivate here, but I nevertheless developed a lifelong fascination with water projects and buoyancy.\n\nI sometimes dream about building a water vessel that could be launched in the Missouri River, reminiscent of the book Paddle-to-the-Sea, reaching the confluence with the Mississippi and making its way out to the Gulf of Mexico. I've also thought about an airborne version, a glider or projectile that is launched and lands from base to base, sending out packets during its brief times in the air.\n\nBut at the moment, at least for me, I am dealing with a different medium, a Sea of Tether.\n\nEquations That Haunt My Dreams\n\nBefore I began designing the craft, I knew that it would have to be within the realm of feasibility, that the energy and forces I needed would have to be within its design constraints. This was almost impossible for me to calculate ahead of time, due to so many unknowns (strength of my materials in their various structural arrangements, weight of the various parts and subsections of parts, motor torque and speed under various voltages, currents, and loads, friction, algorithmic implementations in various CPUs/languages, interaction with nature). This is also complicated by complex, dynamic interactions that have to be balanced to create a practical application, so I relied heavily on my intuition, creating simple models of various fragments, shaping the design as I went along. I designed in stages, leaving gaps to allow me to calibrate and fill in the unknowns later, hoping they would still be in the ranges that I allotted earlier, making course corrections if I caught them early enough. These gaps were very unnerving as time went by, hoping that my work wouldn't be in vain. In retrospect, I wish I would have paid more attention to certain details, but, again, it was impossible for me to know ahead of time what those details were (out of the hundreds) that would later become the most important.\n\nI knew early on that there were several science (physics and even information theory) equations that could come back to haunt me, but I underestimated the sheer number that I would have to familiarize myself with, many of which I haven't revisited since my college years. Equations are relationships in a language of mathematics, and relationships (relations) are how human knowledge comes into existence. Without relationships, we would see the world as random, meaningless.\n\nI studied basic physics (mechanics and heat) and the higher maths in high school and college in the 80's and early 90's, and used some Linear Algebra at work, but I never had a reason to really apply abstract physics or math concepts at home (although I did take a couple of classes in complexity mathematics in recent years). So I knew about force, mass, vector resolution, trigonometry, and differential equations, but they are by no means my strengths. And I had forgotten all about those parametric equations from calculus...\n\nThe most obvious equations were:\n\nStatic equilibrium of 2 ropes and a weight (similar to the weighted catenary equation with 2 ropes at different heights and angles lifting a weight above the ground)\n\nCapstan (how to size a capstan to create friction needed to hold a particular force)\n\nTorque (finding the force based on radius for my capstan and rotating motors)\n\nGyro angular momentum (how to compute the inertial forces of a gyro based on its speed and mass)\n\nPendulum (finding the period of swing based on length of the rod)\n\nF=ma, Newton's Second Law of Motion and its related centripetal force equation\n\nCenter of mass (for balancing)\n\nVarious electrical laws (output of solar panels vs. power needed for radio/electronics/motors vs. storage capacity and output currents)\n\nAlgorithms that have to work within time and space constraints of the CPU/microcontrollers\n\nWork, power, and thermodynamics (the sun is hot, the winter is cold, information processing/motors create heat; heat radiates, conducts, and convects, but components/materials are only designed to work within a specific temperature range)\n\nLambert's cosine law and other optical equations (for computing solar efficiency at various angles, and sun position using LDR)\n\nHooke's law (for making estimates about the elastic behavior of the tether, panels, and planetary rod)\n\nTrigonometry (for kinematics, parametric equations, trochoid and cycloid paths through space, oscillations, changes of angles, the hyperbolic cosine \"catenary\" and its fascinating relationship to e)\n\nDid I get out my pencil and paper and setup the problems and do the calculations? In most cases no, I bounded a lot of the concepts and used my intuition, knowing that those perfect solutions were in there somewhere, inside those bounds, but I'd never know exactly where there were unless I did a full analysis after the fact. The human brain is a great tool for allowing us to do this--it can get us close, like Captain Kirk, but most of us can't satisfy the precision of Mr. Spock.\n\nI knew that the craft would have to be light enough to pull it high in the air, the capstan would have to be able to withstand significant compression, torsion, and shear stress, the motor/gearbox would have to have significant torque, the gyro would have to either spin very fast or be fairly heavy, and that I would have to balance the craft carefully. But I also knew that the power usage for the various line-of-sight radio transmitters at my frequencies would have to be relatively high in order to function over a wide geographic area without a lot of nodes. I love the idea of amateur radio low-power \"QRP\" but decided on a fairly old, inefficient, and inexpensive packet radio digital mode to be practical and work with existing systems/packet networks.\n\nThe system is experimental, but it is an experimental design intended to be a practical system, as I like to build systems, servers, things that do work for us and am not captivated by analysis or data gathering, which I'll expand upon later.\n\nBut as the project went on, it was luckily barely in the ranges needed to demonstrate all of the concepts that I tried to cram into it, and the question of whether some of those things I bounded were outside of my bounds began to haunt me, and I felt like Kirk alone in his ship, far from his friend Spock. Some things work well, some not so well. But that's why it's TRILLSAT-1, my first prototype. I don't know if I will ever build a second, but it will take years of additional refinement to reduce weight, improve its balance and motor algorithms, and create a more robust and weatherproof frame. There are some short-term modifications that I can make to balance the craft properly (as I explore at the end of this essay), but I wanted this craft to represent my original vision.\n\nSo it is intended to serve as a proof of this particular arrangement of concepts, an arrangement and design that fascinates me. My father, for example, built a few musical instruments in his life, his visual designs being quite beautiful, but, he couldn't perfect the sounds that emanated from them. It is difficult to find that optimal balance of competing constraints, as our individual strengths are usually concentrated into a few, but not all areas. I found that most of my time was spent on the things that I was least experienced with, trying to get those things up to the same level of quality as the things that I had already mastered, and this was as close as I could get on Attempt Number One.\n\nKeeping Costs Down\n\nMy primary design constraint was to keep the costs down, not only for my sake (as I don't have a lot of disposable income) but for the sake of learning, education, and fostering excitement in electronics and adding to the wonder of the world around us. When costs are low, things become available to the masses, and one can afford to experiment and break things. Almost anything can be achieved if you throw enough money (and thus manpower) at it, but this is often a hasty approach that misses the point, leaves tiny things overlooked, and you miss the craftsman's journey. You miss the opportunity to teach yourself something new about the Universe. When you start such a project to build a new \"object\", something that has never existed in the material world, to me, the point isn't to create that object at all, the point is to understand it, to understand how it fits into the natural laws of the world, to understand why the natural world allows such things to exist (or not exist), to understand our limitations in Time, Space, and Energy, and to dissolve any delusions we may have had due to our assumptions.\n\nLuckily, at the time of this writing in 2018, we live in a golden-age of low cost electronics, and there is so much information available that you could spend several lifetimes and never fully understand all of its forms. And 3D printing now allows us to more easily experiment with the mechanical world, too. Have you ever noticed how amazing toys are? Many children's toys are extremely good teaching tools, and even as adults we still don't have all of them understood. They encapsulate ideas and concepts, the real magic within our world.\n\nSo the first thing I decided was to use 2 inexpensive WiFi-capable CPUs (Raspberry Pi Zero, which I later replaced with the Raspberry Pi Zero W when it was released, and the ESP8266) and then later incorporated 2 more (the ATtiny 1634 which is under 2 US dollars each), and all of the major parts would be designed with Free and Open-Source Software, printed on an open-hardware based 3D printer (the cost of bulk plastic being fairly low), and then programmed it myself. I relied on many different communication protocols, such as a hardware and software UART (reminiscent of my old C64 days), and the more recent I2C and 1-Wire protocols. I built my own systems, too, programming my own XMPP server, Morse Code decoder server, and an AX.25 PBBS server and APRS client. I chose to use a popular Chinese amateur radio transceiver, which was one of the least expensive available (using DSP in-place of analog radio circuits). I didn't use expensive pre-etched PC boards, but simply wired point-to-point \"dead bug style\" on generic boards or glued the parts directly to the 3D-printed substrate. I built as many circuits as I could where practical, using low-cost circuit designs and common electronics (the 2N3904 transistor was used throughout, for example) which removed the need to buy as many custom interface boards or chips (I built my own packet radio interface, my own high-power H-Bridge, etc). For major things like the solar panel, batteries, ball-bearings, DC-DC boost converters, and Qi charger, I decided to buy Chinese parts online, since the US equivalents were simply too expensive, but the internal solar cells and some IC's are American and the Lithium-ion cells are Japanese. However, after I had already purchased the parts, my country placed import tariffs on solar panels and aluminum, so it is unknown what the actual costs of these parts (or their equivalent) will be in the future.\n\nChina is in a golden age of tech manufacturing that reminds me of my country, just after WWII. In the 2016 documentary Shenzhen: The Silicon Valley of Hardware they show huge DIY parts stores that allow individuals to rapidly prototype just about anything. We have nothing like this where I live (and our largest electronics parts store chain filed for bankruptcy while I was working on this project), but I am lucky to have a local electronics store called Gateway Electronics that still offers individual parts in bins that can be browsed and examined. My country still has some very sophisticated and high-quality integrated circuit companies, however, but the chips go straight from the factory into surface-mount consumer electronics and the individual tinker/prototyper is often overlooked. This is where China excels, yet the trade-off is in the documentation. Many Chinese integrated circuits have no English language datasheets whatsoever. The maker movement in my country is adapting to much of this, and many new-generation electronics/robotics stores are now available online with many good teaching resources, yet this comes at a slight premium. So I bought the bulk of my electronics from large distributor warehouses in Minnesota and Texas.\n\nI went to big-box home improvement stores to find cheap raw materials and bolts/nuts, mostly Chinese, but some from the USA and other countries, and for the really unique stuff, I had to disassemble consumer products, re-purposing them.\n\nBut even after being very careful to keep the costs low, the sheer number of parts nickel-and-dimed me to the point where the total cost ended up being around $390 US, larger than I expected.\n\nRepurposing Household Products\n\nRepurposing is a rather new word and wasn't used when I was young, but it has recently become a very popular term since the maker movement of the 21st century took hold. I was 10 years old in 1980, and so I acquired a lot of 1970's-era \"hand-me-downs\" from neighbors, a term that was often used to describe second-hand items. Around the turn of that decade, people had tired of crafting, the peak of the macrame fad had passed, and consumerism was ramping up again. It didn't matter if an item was of inferior quality (which many of them were), but as long as it was purchased from a manufacturer with a brand name, you were cool. I witnessed this firsthand--I would hang out with my neighbor during the day and beg him to play with his mass of cardboard boxes full of unique and creative '70's-era games and toys (many of which he acquired from his older siblings that had moved away), but they were passe. Peer-pressure was forcing us all to change--if we didn't wear name-brand clothing to school, we were ostracized as being backward or poor.\n\nI was one of the kids who didn't grow up with as much money as the families around us. My father owned a discotheque for a short while during the late '70s, and for a time, I used to wear the biggest hand-me-down bell-bottom jeans in my elementary school, like a little Six-Million Dollar Man, but I didn't get stuck in the 70's for long. When British New Wave music and 8-bit computers arrived, I realized, this is a really cool time. I bonded with the '80s, yet will always miss the simplicity and warmth of the '70s. The '70s wasn't just about style, however, it was full of substance. My father was an audiophile and built a quadraphonic stereo system for his discotheque, which was ahead of its time. Four-channel sound wouldn't be appreciated or understood by consumers until 3 decades later--the home-theater/surround sound movement of the 2000s. For substance, the '80s was a dark age where style ruled supreme.\n\nI also have an interest in film, and if you watch some of those coming-of-age 80's American films, you'll see that they frequently depict class divisions, the cool kids with all of the new products juxtaposed with the poor kids that were stuck with old things from the 1970's and couldn't move out of that decade. This was all too true.\n\nIn 1987, we visited my cousin for Thanksgiving who lived in the affluent Chicago suburb of Highland Park, and she drove us to a party (while the Men Without Hats, Pop Goes the World was playing on the radio). Although she lived with her parents in modestly small house, the other houses in her neighborhood were essentially Gatsbyesque mansions, many still containing separate servant quarter buildings from the last century. We drove past the houses where Risky Business and Weird Science were filmed. I asked her about her public high-school and was shocked to find out they had carpeting and a pool, which mine had lacked.\n\nWhat I saw in that place and time was just like those films. John Hughes captured this suburban class divide in a lot of his films (and shot many of them in that city such as Ferris Bueller and Sixteen Candles).\n\nAfter that day, I realized that, films, while large part fiction, are always connected in large-part to reality. Whether it is art imitating life, or the other way around, it didn't matter--there was a connection. I later studied film in college, realizing that its power was far more vast than most people realize, and in recent decades I've been philosophically deconstructing such concepts. Fictional stories and factual \"hi-stories\" are identical in pattern, structure; only the inputs, the details, vary.\n\nSince my family didn't have much money in the '80s, I repaired a lot of things around the house (and the neighbors' houses) and felt like the kid in The Last Starfighter. I repaired our washers, dryers, sinks and toilets, air conditioners, automobiles, wired my neighbors' telephones, put chips in computers, fixed people's projectors, radios and televisions. It was sometimes an annoyance, but there were those times, working with my father and grandfather that were special when we tried to fix our old, sometimes poorly made, machines, furniture, or tools.\n\nThis was especially significant with my father, as English was not his native language, so we had trouble communicating complex ideas (he often used allegory and symbols), but when we had a machine open (often engineered by people of countries foreign to both of us, using methods foreign to both of us) and were trying to figure out how it worked, the geometric shapes, the spatial relations of the parts, the varying forces were a universal language that transcended our limited words. It was those times that we saw the same things and knew that each other shared the same things. So something as trivial as fixing household machines, in retrospect, was profound.\n\nMy father grew up in a world of wood, metal and radios, but I grew up in a world of plastic and computers, some of those 70's hand-me-downs I often re-purposed for my projects, so I frequently saw things fatigue and break, warp and discolor, melt, etc. One of my earliest childhood memories is when my brother and I sat in our green, molded plastic chairs at a little round table where we used to draw pictures, close to the gas oven in the winter, since it was warmer over there, and my brother suddenly started sinking in his chair as it melted. Observing these materials during my formative years unknowingly helped me develop a language of the plastic (polymer) medium which I didn't realize until I built my first 3D printer in 2015.\n\nIn 1980, the film My Bodyguard came out, also set in the Chicago north-side. I had read the book by Joe Claro before I saw the film, and loved it. Linderman, played by Adam Baldwin, was my favorite character. Not only did he stand up to bullies, he was poor and built his dream motorcycle piece-by-piece from used and discarded parts.\n\nE.T. came out in 1982 when I was 12 years old. Hughes captured the class divide, but Spielberg captured a different feeling of the 80's American suburbia, a feeling of wonder. E.T.'s transmitter, by the way, was an assembly of \"repurposed\" consumer products.\n\nSo for this project, I used 12 different consumer products in interesting ways:\n\nBlack & Decker AS6NG cordless screwdriver (main drive motor and planetary gearbox)\n\nLite-On LDW-411S DVD-ROM (BLDC 3-phase spindle motor for gyro/fan)\n\nX-Dragon 14 Watt Solar Charger (main power source, contains two 7-watt solar panels with Sunpower cells and a 5v regulator)\n\n(2) iKits PBM-G-G102 Power Banks (power storage and charging, 20400 mAh total, contains 6 Panasonic NCR18650B Lithium-ion cells and charge controller/boost converter)\n\nBaofeng UV-5RA Radio Transceiver (I essentially turned it into a packet radio TNC by building an interface, controlling its flash, PTT, and LCD display programatically and adding software modem)\n\nSyba SD-CM-UAUD USB Sound Adapter (for Bell 202 AFSK tone generation for the packet radio)\n\nEarbud headphones (contained small rare earth magnets that I used with 2 digital Hall-effect sensors)\n\nSlingshot shot (for gyro weights)\n\nDaisy steel BBs (for planetary weight/damping)\n\nTOMOL Super Bright COB LED mini flashlight (removed 100-lumen white COB LED board to use as spotlight)\n\nOld kitchen cabinet (removed 4 Amerock Self-Closing Hinges and added them to the Ark door)\n\nBlueberry produce container (cut to create clear plastic PET rain covers for the tiny LDR Tubes)\n\nHacks\n\nWhile re-purposing is a 21st-century trend, I am still a product of the 1980's movies like Wargames and Real Genius, and being a kid during the microcomputer generation, I never grew out of the need to show off my ingenuity, so this project wouldn't be complete without a series of hacks↗ as well.\n\nUV-5RA flash programming for frequency and LCD control\n\nBuilding an XMPP Server on the ESP8266\n\nIncorporating my Morse Decoder\n\nVirtual UART and bypassing Raspberry Pi hardware I2C bug\n\nSending a beacon on the APRS frequency while AX.25 sessions are in progress on another frequency using a single tuner\n\nWriting an AX.25 BBS using Unix techniques\n\nIf you can master construction, deconstruction, and finding hidden paths via logic and experimentation, you have access to knowledge and bring your dreams into existence. Linderman can build a motorcycle, E.T. can send a message millions of miles away to his home people, so surely I can build a terrestrial analog of a spacecraft. Perseverance and wonder is all I need.\n\nA Space-Elevator-Spacecraft\n\nIn 1945, writer Arthur C. Clarke first proposed the concept of \"Extraterrestrial Relays\", which today we call the geostationary communication satellite. While he is remembered for his authorship of science fiction, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, he is not always remembered for his earlier work as a radar specialist in the RAF and later work in mathematics, physics and space exploration.\n\nToday, modern technology makes it possible for people to create their own communication satellites, such as the CubeSat↗ project, but even today, it is still expensive for individuals. Even before CubeSats, hams were building OSCAR↗ satellites. And in many ways, today people can now easily control their own spacecraft. The modern telepresent and telecommanded quadcopter drone is one example, equipped with a camera and different types of sensors, motors, and radio equipment. The only difference is that the planet they are exploring is Earth (terrestrial), and not one more distant with a different gravity, atmosphere, weather, and temperature (extraterrestrial). Today there are a variety of inexpensive tiny microelectromechanical systems, MEMS↗ sensors that used to be large, expensive, and in the domain of the aerospace industry, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and inertial measurement units (IMUs). This is post space-age stuff, and the main hurdle preventing people from building real spacecraft is overcoming that extremely fast escape velocity of approximately 25,000 mph (40,000 km/h). To get something into space, it has to be launched at approximately 33 times faster than a speeding bullet and the speed of sound, Mach 33.\n\nBut my design goals were neither to create a robust radio station nor re-invent the drone--there are a variety of better ways to do this. I wanted to create something that was small and self-contained, something that emulated an actual satellite or distant spacecraft, and do it with extremely low cost. After deciding to raise the entire station into the air, I had no idea at the time that it would begin to share similarities with the space elevator of (at the time of this writing) science fiction.\n\nThirty-four years after Clarke proposed his relays, in 1979, he published The Fountains of Paradise, being one of the first descriptions of a space elevator↗ that most people had ever read. It's strange how obscure this idea remained during the 20th century (and even today). If built one day, the benefits will be enormous. Unlike my craft, however, a real space elevator has to have an unbelievably strong tether, has to travel a lot farther, but could also take advantage of centripetal force that counteracts gravity, the elevator getting lighter as it ascended at a rate that exceeds the inverse-square law. I thought about creating a sort of counterbalance in my initial designs, before I settled on the capstan drive, using the mass of a weight with its pulley attached to a tree branch to pull the weight of the craft upward, reducing the energy needed for its drive motor (like a garage door opener, for example)--but this added more complexity and external dependencies to the craft.\n\nBy the way, this capstan-driven craft cannot actually traverse a space-elevator tether. The tether would be large and the tension would be immense and immediately disintegrate the capstan and crush the frame. You'd have to build a crawling/climbing style mechanism, not a wrap-around capstan. But the same issue that prevents its use in a real space elevator is an advantage at lesser forces. The capstan can withstand tensions/compression that might be too much for a standard winch/takeup wheel, as the strong forces pulling at opposite ends to raise the craft are redirected at the capstan. This is why you'll see heavy and powerful capstan winches and horizontal windlasses in industrial operation, and large hydraulic ones in use on ships. The mechanism is simple and has less moving parts. And they don't have to deal with reeling in and out a spool of tether which changes the weight/balance, the radius, torque, RPM and tension calculations, and the space needed for storage.\n\nA craft like TrillSat, if hardened for the conditions of space, could also orbit the earth and still work for a reasonable period. The International Space Station, for example, uses similar consumer technology↗ (AX.25 packet radio on a low-power transmitter) to communicate back down to the surface. At the time of this writing, they have two 5 watt Ericsson HTs on-board in their Columbus module, and I am designing mine around a Baofeng UV-5RA 4 watt HT.\n\nElon Musk's Tesla Roadster and Starman driver was launched aboard the SpaceX Falcon Heavy on its test flight on February 6th, 2018 (which I watched live via Internet stream) while I was building the TRILLSAT-1 Ark and Test Frame and it wasn't even space-hardened, yet it is now orbiting the sun like a tiny red planet. But just as fascinating to me is that there is also a tiny toy car on board, traveling through the solar system. A car within a car, self-similarity.\n\nIs TRILLSAT-1 a true spacecraft? It depends on your definition. Are the Apollo or Mercury capsules spacecraft? Today some of them now sit in museums. They don't orbit the earth, but even today, they do still orbit the sun, they just do so from a low earth altitude. No man-made object has ever left the gravitational influence of our sun, captured by the primary influence of another star. It will be many thousands of years before this happens to Voyager 1. The Earth itself is a spacecraft. But perhaps those lonely wanderers of the interstellar medium, like the timeless Voyagers, are the \"true\" spacecraft.\n\nThis project incorporates a lot of my interests: computers and robotics, vending machines, vessels and self-contained machines that survive the elements, and, of course, communication systems. Successfully communicating with an autonomous entity somewhere else in space and time is fascinating, and if the machine is alone, somewhere off in earth's wilderness, it is tremendously exciting; a lonely, ancient sentry, always on duty to send us a courteous reply when asked, like a tower cathedral for an old monk friend living his life in solitude while still carrying on functions to assist humanity. Like Spock, he doesn't have to be fully human, just humane.\n\nThis is also an attempt to coexist with Nature, creating a crude entity that reminds me of that bird on a wire, but I also borrowed ideas from the Tree (photovoltaics in place of photosynthesis, move slowly to track the sun, materials that create the desired infrared (heat) reflectivity and emissivity, redirecting the flow of water, etc). It will need to contain its own power storage and will derive its energy from the Sun. It will also have zero reliance on the Internet or mobile cell infrastructure. It will encounter clouds, wind, rain, hail, ice, snow, and animal life. It will have to compensate for both the rotation of the Earth (day/night cycles) and also its tilt in relation to the orbit around the Sun (height of the Sun in the changing seasons). It has no real-time clock, so it will ask us for the time of day or pay attention to solar noon. It will have to overcome the curvature of the earth, since it uses line-of-sight radio frequencies. It will need to incorporate failsafes, manual overrides, and redundancy since it will be difficult to reach if a problem occurs. It will contain multiple radios for different functions and will use a low-bandwidth link (1200 bps) for long-distance communication so data transfers will take time, which simulates the operation of a distant spacecraft with weak signals (except that there is no significant latency created by the speed of light). It will contains its own gyroscopic inertial stabilization and reaction wheel, and it will be \"orbited\" by a planetary \"space pod\" in complete electrical isolation from the rest of the craft, like Dave Bowman leaving the Discovery One in 2001: A Space Odyssey, reminiscent of the human centrifuge tests of NASA astronauts, a cyclical movement that mimics the planetary pull of gravity, even using gravity to change the attitude of the craft, that can dock and undock at will. It evokes the exciting VertiBirds↗ of my youth, round and round, flying on a rod, while balancing on a tether.\n\nThe craft is a Fractal microcosm of itself.\n\nDesign\n\nInvisible Forces and Fractal Self-Similarity\n\nThere is a point in the design of a machine where my subconscious decides something is optimal, and I know intuitively when this point arrives as I sense a multiplicative gain in a surprising way, sometimes I sense several. Often the search for these gains begins to shape the project in a fractal, self-similar, and recursive way. It is likely that something engineered to work in the real-world becomes fractal, as fractal shapes are often the results of optimization around a complex set of constraints, but it's not the whole picture. Our minds are also fractal cathedrals, spaces consisting of wondrous halls and twisting catacombs, shaping our very recognition. When I'm on the correct path, the gains assert themselves time and time again. When I'm not on the correct path, they are few and far between. Nature may abhor a vacuum, but it adores fractals.\n\nHave you ever stared at Jackson Pollock drip/pouring-style painting for any length of time? We have one at our local museum, and the room was empty one day, and I had a chance to stare at it by myself for several minutes. It's quite a different experience to observe it for a length of time than to just walk by and dismiss it as random noise. The longer you observe it, the more interesting it becomes. There is a fractal hidden within it.\n\nThis is not to say that any design is the right one. I learned in my earlier designs that there is no perfect design and there is no bad design, each design has its unique place in Nature. But fractal designs can be very efficient for my uses as they provide me, personally, with more benefits than I would likely otherwise see in my life--but this is just my subconscious can see the shape, it is within my capacity. Another exotic design that might appear alien or inappropriate to me may down the road be preferable, but I simply lack the context and awareness to realize it. So I rely on my subconscious to remind me of these larger patterns and guide some of my decisions. Inventors, such as Edison, have intentionally induced a hypnagogic state to do this, but, while working on my film project years ago, I learned that such a state is not needed--the ideas will assert themselves when they find an appropriate time. Time is part of the equation, and our conscious mind cannot see into time, it cannot see your personal Zeitgeist, but your subconscious can.\n\nPerhaps most mysterious to me is that I had written about such a robot years ago at the beginning of the millennium: the main character in my screenplay had built a device with almost the same core specifications: solar charging in cyclical fashion, separate microcontroller core, internal gyro, camera, balance algorithms, reset network, surrounded by a spiral or helix, discovery of bugs, a wooden rectangular storage box and central pole, interaction with birds, and control via \"texting\" before SMS was even in common use. But like a dream, the details were different.\n\nI tend to get very philosophical in my writings, examining ontological and metaphysical concepts, and this \"technical work\" is no exception. Did my mind conceive of a symbol that I obsessed over and tried to make real? If so, how could it have conceived of a \"functioning machine\" as I would have no way of knowing if the machine had actually worked or what its purpose would be until I built it? Is this the awesome power of the subconscious? And this complex combination did work. Or was it simply a lens into a future worldline where I saw something I had already created and then, in cargo-cult fashion, simply emulated that thing? Since how would I have accounted for the actions of other people, that lived their lives independently of me and suddenly matched certain sequences in my story?\n\nBesides Edison, if you look at creative inventors like Arthur C. Clarke or Nikola Telsa, their work had very odd characteristics. And Albert Einstein is one of my heros. How is it possible that Einstein's intuition was so accurate without experimental verification? Mathematics, when aligned with reality, can lead you to thousands of destinations if you have no physical signposts--how did he know which path would be the right one?\n\nIt's curious that I seem to repeat myself, building essentially the same type of system in different ways and never tire of this. What are these invisible forces compelling me to create such an object? I seem to be seeing/feeling a particular shape or geometry that is difficult to explain, but I have no idea \"where\" it exists. One thing I've learned about myself is that I seem to build things according to a power law↗, that once I learn the core principles or rules to a system, if I am intrigued by them, I make an attempt to ramp up the difficulty/complexity on my next project, as if I'm trying to see a magnified expression of these rules. Interestingly, this new design took me down the path of \"real\" invisible forces such as gravity, inertia, and inductance. Rather than design a gear/lever system to tilt the solar panel, the orientation of the drive motor causes a shift in balance, rather than use extra stabilizing tethers a rotating inertial mass inside the craft was chosen. Rather than connect to an external power port, wireless inductive charging was used. Rather than plug the unit into a wall socket, it receives its energy from a star millions of miles away. And in many cases the motion of the motor had additional, overloaded functions (the solar panel tilt also drives a capstan winch and tilts a light and camera, the gyro is also a heating/cooling fan and reaction wheel, the power port is also a planetary pod docking base, the same MISO line is used for the light, programming, hall-sensor, and Morse communication, etc).\n\nWhat the heck am I talking about?\n\nFirstly, the craft is designed to operate in a very \"fractal\" environment, suspended by trees, absorbing power from a cyclical sun with passing clouds, withstanding weather (which is chaotically fractal), and has to be high enough to provide line-of-sight (and adequate radiation patterns) above fractal irregularities in the surrounding terrain. It is \"arboreal\" in the sense of something inhabiting a tree, yet it also fulfills the second definition of arboreal, that it is of the tree, it is like a tree.\n\nWhile the machine is not organic, like a lifeform, it turned out to be very fractal-like in other ways, containing branching, complex self-similarity, but also containing elements of recursion, symmetry and inversion.\n\nI'm a Logician, not an Analyst\n\nEven though I like to analyze my own creations (which is really a form of comparison), throughout my life, many have incorrectly assumed that I was an analyst, scientifically-minded, that I tend to \"over-analyze\" subjects and have a need to dissect things in order to understand them. It is easy to make this mistake, as my interests are in many cases the same as in the science and engineering fields (finding or pushing up against the boundaries of the natural world), but there is a subtle, but very important distinction: I understand the world through creation (modeling) and comparison, and I don't get any enjoyment at all from dissection and measurement (what most people consider to be \"scientific\" analysis). My tools are reason, rational thought, and logic, and I use high-level comparison. I choose rationalism over empiricism, as I believe the mind is a better \"measurement tool\" than our artificial tools.\n\nSo I tend to avoid using measuring equipment in my work. Instead of finding precise boundaries, I stay well within the bounds of those lines and take advantage of logical inference of the inner machine created within. I don't use an oscilloscope but get by with multimeters or math calculations, yet I even forgo those tools, too, in lieu of my precious theoretical and experimental models, to \"try it and see if it works\" first, leaving any error checking for later... It can be pretty crude, I admit, and I do appreciate the people that do the hard work to gather and analyze the data that I don't, but my view is perhaps understandable since one of my greatest fears is that I will get stuck in the abstract, mental world forever, always measuring but never getting a chance to transfer my inner ideas to the physical world, like unmanifested, lost Dreams, a sleep from which I cannot awaken. The line between the real and the imaginary is old and faded, so I have to periodically wipe away the dust.\n\nSo I tend to operate very differently than scientific researchers, whose career is full of empirical instruments, statistics and graphs. I also purposely don't introduce the rigor of an engineer. Instead, I focus my time/energy/knowledge to maximize my own understanding of the world.\n\nImproving Upon My Earlier Projects\n\nI took what I learned from my earlier OswaldBot and PacketRadio projects and improved upon them. The former is a Python 2, XMPP-based home automation robot running on a Raspberry Pi B+, the latter is a packet radio interface for a Baofeng UV-5RA running on a Raspberry Pi 2. I also taught myself Lua for this project so that I could easily incorporate an ESP8266 running the wonderful NodeMCU.\n\nTo reduce cost and power usage for this project, I used a Raspberry Pi Zero W and a Syba SD-CM-UAUD USB sound adapter instead of the Pi 2 and UCA202 which I used previously. I changed the Python GPIO module from RPi.GPIO to Pigpio, changed the software modem from Soundmodem to Direwolf, and I had to bypass Prosody and Chirp and write my own XMPP server and UV-5R programming code. I also changed from a hardware to software UART in one case.\n\nI applied better event-driven programming practices as well, to keep the CPU/power usage low and to prevent communication deadlocks. I could no longer rely on my lazy, brute force loops.\n\nLessons from My Father\n\nMy father was a designer, not by profession, but by natural ability. He was many things, all largely unrecognized within the time he lived: artist, inventor, audiophile. He was even his own Stradivarius, not an Italian musical instrument woodworker and craftsman--he was Persian--but he was also a musical instrument woodworker and craftsman.\n\nHis best creation, in my opinion, was a beautiful santur↗, a Persian percussion-stringed instrument using walnut wood and coconut shells. For weeks I watched him build it, and curiously, TrillSat, my hunk of plastic and silicon, is about the same rough dimensions and weight. Now that I think about it, the santur is also a \"quantized\" communication machine, being a \"hammered\" dulcimer, but it emitted warm sound, not cold, packet radio signals. But he might have liked my project if he was alive to see it, as he once assembled a 4-channel audio system in the 1970's, years ahead of its time, building the speaker cabinets from scratch and wiring the crossovers, and he loved shortwave radios. TrillSat, in a way, is a \"string\" instrument, too.\n\nI have pieces of his mind, contain fragments of his perfectionism, but don't hold the entire key. I can see into the world of my father yet am more distant from it and have a more difficult time reaching it. My father made attempts in his life to bring \"perfect\" things into the material world from another, perfect, world, an ideal world that he could only reach in his mind.\n\nHe also mirrored this in other ways, trying to bridge worlds. He built a discotheque in the 1970's and a few years later tried to start an import-export business, transferring objects between different worlds, until his country's revolution crushed any hope for that dream.\n\nAnd because he came from a different culture, he had different customs, and while he couldn't always transfer \"objects\" between two very different cultures, I sometimes witnessed him transferring \"magic\" instead, his knowledge.\n\nOne of the most memorable experiences was a kite he built for me. Within the span of around 30 minutes, he built a flying kite out of wrapping paper, glue, and a thin wooden stick unlike the designs in my country. While my childhood books were full of the traditional \"diamond\" style kite, he built an Indian \"patang\" style kite, a square kite with a curved bow, and it flew wonderfully.\n\nMy father had a mercantile mindset and chose the best designs of those available between cultures, appreciating the best goods and products made in the world, regardless of where they came from, not limiting himself or fixating on any one people or culture's traditions. He also switched between languages, often using the particular word that was most representative of an idea, regardless of its language of origin. And design was more fundamental than culture, it was universal and underlying, and this topic also provided a way for us to communicate with each other, as I mentioned earlier, as we could see the same thing.\n\nSo I learned to see design as a way to express one's freedom, that the constraints weren't one's culture, they were form, shape, efficiency, natural law. But, unlike my father, I was slow to know where those bounds were, gaining most of my worldly knowledge from American books which often didn't tell me whether or not this knowledge was a best practice, convention, or whether it had fundamental limits.\n\nThanks, Dad, this is my kite.\n\nFinding the Right Design\n\nI didn't design the craft until I had first built the new radio interface and programmed the AX.25 PBBS code, as I had to confirm that I at least had something useful to hoist into the air, or there was no real purpose for the robotic platform at all. I only enjoy experimenting as long as I know that there will eventually be a tangible benefit. Knowledge for its own sake is, by definition, useless and perhaps even an outright illusion, keeping us in a state of perpetual inaction. But once applied to our physical world, knowledge becomes an invaluable thing.\n\nIt took approximately one year for me to program the radio and PBBS (2016), and one year to design/build the robotics (2017) and perform basic programming of the microcontrollers, although the final programming has gone into 2018 and it will take even more time to perfect the algorithms.\n\nI have several notebooks containing my sketches and notes over this two-year span, along with my Internet blog, that documents the evolution of my design, although I had kept the details secret until this article was published. As I tend to prefer, it was all thought-experiment except for a few models that I made out of pencils and twine to confirm the final concept, and I have to admit that rotating the parts around in OpenSCAD later helped me eliminate a lot of problems before they ever reached the physical stage. I wanted to create a smaller and cheaper radio audio/programming interface and add smaller computers such as the Pi Zero or the ESP8266, as I mentioned above, but there was no real reason to make them smaller unless the unit had to be lightweight, low-cost and low-power--a solution in search of a problem, and if this was possible, this opened up the idea that the entire base station could be raised into the air. Before those red-winged blackbirds inspired me, I started to pay attention to High-Altitude Ballooning, which led me to take a closer look at APRS, which I had previously ignored. This is a fascinating hobby, but there is a transience to it that disturbs me--besides the FAA regulations, the balloons eventually float outside of useful radio range and are intended for short-term testing or data-logging. But again, I'm not an analyst--I don't enjoy capturing or analyzing data, but I want the craft to do something. I like to set up servers more than sensor networks.\n\nI needed to get it high above the earth, so my next idea was to design a pole-climbing robot, and I spent several weeks trying to come up with a simple wheeled mechanism that allowed the unit to drive up and down a pole that might serve a dual-purpose, such as a purple martin birdhouse or flagpole, both of which another of my childhood neighbors once had in his yard.\n\nBut friction became a problem. The friction needed to hold the wheel against the pole had to be great enough to overcome its weight, so I couldn't use weights themselves to apply more friction unless I added long levers and would need a more complicated spring mechanism. And I didn't want to spend months of mechanical engineering/prototyping a gripping-style or hand-over-hand climber, either, and insisted on the simple wheeled design. Since I've designed various winch bots in the past (but never actually built one until now) I decided to instead use a rope tied to the top of the pole and winch the bot up and down--problem solved. But now the entire point of the design was lost--here I have a pole and rope that need to be erected first; it might as well be an antenna mast and guy wires, standard radio equipment. Heck, there's no reason to even create the winch at all, just mount the craft at the top of the pole and be done with it... But I wanted a spacecraft.\n\nThe birdhouse idea, though, kept me thinking about those red-winged blackbirds sitting on wires, sitting on tree branches, reminding me of my childhood tree-based message-passing gondola system, and I realized that what I really needed to do was winch/hoist the entire craft into a tree, and trees have been used by ham radio enthusiasts for years as antenna supports. As I mentioned earlier, I did the calculations to confirm that the angle needed for a solar panel at my latitude could in practicality become the angle of the rope itself and the sun never goes behind the north side of the tree in my hemisphere. Now I was intrigued. Yes, it would be subject to sway and rotation in the wind... now I have the opposite--a problem in search of a solution.\n\nBut my early designs varied between a traditional on-board winch (with a take-up reel) and a capstan winch. I didn't want to create a gondola lift, as then its propulsion would be controlled by an external \"bullwheel\" and wouldn't be self-contained. If I used two traditional winches, opposed to each other, they could also \"land\" the craft at various places and control their own rope tension, but this required 2 powerful motors, tension-monitoring sensors, and dynamic calculations of the torque of the two spools. As one spool collected the tether, its diameter would increase, lowering the torque and requiring it to slow down to match the other spool which was losing its tether, decreasing its diameter. Another issue was locking the spools--if the gears weren't locked when the motors stopped, the rope tension, which is very high, would act like a lever on the large spools from the weight of the craft, and it would simply cause the motors/spools to unwind and the craft would come down.\n\nI could have used a hanging weight in the tree to overcome some of craft's own weight, getting by with just one spool, but it meant that an external, \"out-of-band\" mechanism was required, and I wanted this thing to be self-contained and autonomous like a spaceship.\n\nThe capstan solves these problems--it solves the locking problem, the torque, weight, storage, and changing RPM problems. It doesn't require tension sensors or take-up reels, but it does require proper rope tension, capstan design, and friction on the capstan, and it can do it all with just a single motor.\n\nNow, how do I orient the capstan along the tether: longitudinal, transverse, or hanging downward? I immediately thought transverse, like a front-wheel drive car engine, allow the capstan to balance and \"roll\" along the top of the taut tether. In this case, the horizontal capstan would be called a \"windlass\", but balance was a problem, so I decided that I would have to add a hanging weight to change the center of mass underneath the rope. But when I decided to add the mechanism to tilt the solar panel from the same motor, add the rope guides and keep water out of the horizontal motor, the complex mechanical problems became apparent.\n\nNext, I explored longitudinal, and this had many benefits, and the craft began to take on the shape of a cordless drill or gun. Think about this: a pistol or cordless drill is something you point along one axis while allowing rotation along the same axis while maintaining that fixed point. This works very well if your axis is the tether since the weighted portion (where the bullets or the battery is stored) hangs under gravity. But the capstan was at the worst possible angle and would need strong, frictionless guides. The solar panel tilt mechanism was simpler, since it just required a crankshaft at the end of the capstan, but again, there was the problem of water entering the motor mechanism. There was another upside, though: activating the motor would jerk and tilt the entire craft, which wasn't a big problem, but it could also jerk in opposition of any oscillations caused by the wind, acting as an active damping system. Now I was further intrigued.\n\nBut I kept returning to the downward orientation, which naturally kept out the water, but there was no way for me to tilt the solar panels unless I oriented the capstan upward and attached a complicated lever/pushrod mechanism which again allowed water to enter the shaft.\n\nI obsessed over this problem for weeks until one day it hit me--keep the capstan pointing downward but allow gravity to perform the tilt, not a mechanism. This also allowed the tension in the tether to hold the gondola against the battery box, securing the assembly. I still using a balance technique like in the transverse design, but this one was much better. Previously, I was considering the weighed craft to be a stationary heavy unit that pushed against a lighter solar panel, but due to the lever effect, a rotating planetary weight on a rod of sufficient length can be relatively light and still tilt the heavier weight of the craft. It didn't just eliminate the need for a tilt mechanism and eliminate problems with water entering the motor, since the capstan was at the end of the craft, a planetary \"space pod\" was also free to roam without interfering with the tether at all. And the space pod could actively damp wind oscillations, even including a passive ball damper inside it, and then another thought hit me: instead of solely using active damping, which may be difficult, use something fixed in space, rotational inertia, which led me to creating the gyroscope. And conveniently, the gyroscope is along the same axis as the drive motor, allowing it to also act as a counter-rotating reaction wheel. Wonderful.\n\nThe design didn't come without drawbacks, however. I can't just attach the craft to an already existing tether like a true space elevator, I have to at least untie the bottom end and feed it through the mechanism. And I still had to overcome the problems of friction in the 4 guides that change the direction of the tether around the capstan unit, properly distributing the weight along the rope, and calculating the angle, length, and weight of the planetary pod to allow full range of motion for the solar panel.\n\nBut it was not long after this point that I began to realize that the device was now truly a ship, it even began to look somewhat like an aircraft carrier at sea, later with even a pontoon boat hanging underneath, tilting port and starboard in the wind, with a long keel underneath, and a capstan winch, gyroscopic stabilizer (which even looks like a captain's wheel), just like those on the decks of real ships. The planetary pod tilts the craft like a sail while anchoring the craft when near the ground, and the Qi Dock that juts underneath the rear could be imagined to be a propeller or rudder; the nautical analogies are abundant.\n\nThis is a new adventure for me, since being in the land-locked center of the United States, I have no nautical experience other than fishing in a lake with my grandfather and a scuba class in a swimming pool, but, like in the Twain stories, we do have the awesome confluence of two great rivers, the Mississippi and Missouri, along with flat ferries, tugboats, and river barges. And it has some similarities with those very river bridges that those barges travel underneath (St. Louis has many bridges), as the rigid solar panel frame is somewhat like a box girder, supported primarily at the ends by the tether like a bridge with a heavy weight in the center. And the orbiting mass that changes its angle during its orbit is reminiscent of many amusement park rides.\n\nNearing the end of this project, I finally knew where to look for future solutions--not in modern tech manuals, but in the the structural engineering of bridges and carnival rides and in the ancient knowledge of my ship-building ancestors, as weights, ropes, levers, pulleys, sails, knots and rigging, and hydraulic and marine engineering goes back to antiquity. This expanded my quest for knowledge into realms that I had not considered and will keep me interested for years.\n\nI finally found the right design.\n\nPolo and the Pony Express: The T Acronyms\n\nThis project uses tethers (ropes), and ropes date back to pre-historic times, so there are a lot of ancient analogies, both nautical and equestrian, that can be used to describe it, and there are a lot of T acronyms that match the satellite-like \"T-shape\" of the craft itself. The letter T is integral throughout, for the \"Tether\" hangs from a \"Tree\", mimics a \"Transcontinental Telegraph Transmission\" to send \"Texts\"; even a telegraph pole or tree looks pictographically like a T. T is so common in English usage, in fact, that its Morse code representation is simply a single dash (-), or \"dah\" (something I took advantage of in my NEAT directional UI for a Morse-code based roguelike game in 2015).\n\nIt is called TrillSat (Tethered, Radio-Interfaced, Spiral Axis Tracker), but the prototype is called TRILLSAT-1, to denote that it is my first attempt, although I may use the terms interchangeably. The name is an intentional variation of \"TSAT\", a particular type of single-axis solar tracker that it improves upon (Tilted axis), as opposed to a VSAT (Vertical axis) or HSAT (Horizontal axis), which I explain in more detail later.\n\nTROT (Tethered Rocking Orbiting Tracker) is the name that I gave to the capstan-driven, robotic solar tracker, the distinct platform that both elevates the craft and tilts the panels to harvest energy for the other systems. I called it TROT to represent the two-beat gait of a horse as it \"trots\" along the tether, tilting back and forth with a planetary mass on rod that orbits around, kind of like an ancient polo player swinging a mallet as the horse trots. Note that the T-shape of a polo mallet, or stick, is actually the ideal design for the planetary mass, something I noticed when creating it.\n\nIt also seems to \"swim\", like an Olympic freestyle swimmer tilting back and forth in the water, or \"buck\" like a rider on a mechanical bull with an outstretched arm, but the equestrian analogy had more overall similarities. TROT doesn't include the contents of the hanging Radio Box, and one could put whatever they want into that box, really, but I used it to house the CPU and Radio systems for TRILLSAT-1.\n\nTHUMP (Tethered Haptics Using Morse Pulses) is an experimental backup haptic Morse code system that is intended to communicate with the TROT platform when all other higher systems are offline. Using the same polo rider analogy, you could think of it as the rider using the reins (tethers) to send signals to the horse by pulling on the bit (mouthpiece). In the case of THUMP, you are tapping (thumping) on the tether (reins) to send signals to the TROT mechanism (horse) via the accelerometer (bit).\n\n\"Cable thumpers\", also called surge wave generators, have been the names for industrial testing devices for decades. Thumpers send a high-voltage electrical wave pulse down the cable to generate an underground thumping sound at the location of a fault (for fault detection), but this system does the reverse--it sends a thumping sound down the cable (a mechanical wave pulse) which then generates an electrical pulse at the location of the craft (for Morse code communication).\n\nThe acronym concisely includes the exact description of the haptic system while also representing the action of making that sound (verb), mimicking the sound it makes (onomatopoeia), and representing the sound itself (noun).\n\nSo TROT with THUMP forms a skeleton platform like a horse with reins, with a central saddle with saddlehorn for stabilization (the Gyrofan), and two hanging pannier saddlebags (the Circuit Boxes) that allows basic autonomy and manual control of a single-tether, solar powered robot, but it's not the full system. I then added the rider (the higher-level algorithms), loaded up the saddlebags with mail, so to speak, and turned it into a pack horse.\n\nLike the short-lived Pony Express↗ that once traveled between my state of Missouri and California before the first Morse Code transcontinental telegraph, it then becomes TRILLSAT-1, a useful XMPP-to-AX.25 radio communication relay.\n\nThe Electromechanical Machine\n\nExploded Diagram\n\n(Click diagram to enlarge)\n\nPETG 3D-Printed Modules\n\nI completed most of the programming first and left the engineering until later, since I wanted to first confirm that the packet radio and XMPP system would work as I envisioned. I chose to prioritize the most difficult pieces of this project first, with the most unknowns, so that as I solved (or failed to solve) problems, I would develop more knowledge of its capabilities and could then adjust the rest of my design around these capabilities, as needed. It created a lot of excitement as I solved new problems and discovered new possibilities, but it was also demoralizing as time went on, as I had nothing to show for my work for a long time. Up until the very end, the craft was a series of solved problems, disparate pieces and modules, nothing was unified or coherent. The conscious mind needs a focal point, the mysterious \"object\" that I have written about before. To converge thought, to focus, naturally eliminates extraneous possibilities, simplifying the equation at hand. It's almost as if the immaterial world resolves itself, manifesting into something real, the 3Dprinter being an analogy of this process.\n\nTRILLSAT-1: My First Prototype\n\n(Click diagram to enlarge)\n\nI split the craft into five major sections:\n\nThe Solar Panel Frame Assembly\n\nTwo opposing Circuit Boxes\n\nThe central Battery Frame\n\nThe motor Gondola\n\nThe Planetary Assembly\n\nExcluding the Circuit Boxes, I call the mechanical/solar platform TROT (Tethered Rocking Orbiting Tracker). The Circuit Boxes essentially turn the TROT platform into a full XMPP-to-Packet radio station, but the TROT platform is a distinct robotic and power-harvesting mechanism on a single tether that could be used for a variety of other purposes.\n\nThe size of the modules was primarily dictated by the approximately 200×200 mm maximum print area of my RepRap Prusa i3 printer, which matched well with the width of the solar cells and also the diameter of the Gyrofan (coincidentally, a compact disc fits almost perfectly).\n\n18 Unique 3D-Printed Parts\n\nThe Solar Panel Frame Assembly\n\nThe Solar Panel Frame encapsulates solar cells in a rigid, weatherproof frame which covers the entire top of the craft, all other modules hang underneath, shaded from the sun. It is a sandwich of clear acrylic on top, solar cells and temperature sensor in the middle, PETG (reinforced by aluminum angle bar) on the sides in the form of Corner Trim, Side Trim Left, Side Trim Right, two supporting Braces, and aluminum sheet metal on the bottom, acting as both a heat sink and optional RF ground. This sandwich was sealed and secured in place with acetic-acid free, clear silicone caulk around the edges which also helps to add rigidity (like a partial, crude composite laminate).\n\nThe Circuit Boxes are directly underneath, one at each end, leaving a gap for the tether and cooling airflow, and each of them contains its own smaller, custom circuit board: Circuit Board A in the Radio Box, and Circuit Board B in the Power Regulation Box. Since the enclosures hang underneath the panel, I designed the pieces so that assembly takes place with the entire unit flipped upside-down, in ITSO orientation, resting on the solar panel. This provides a stable base for me to easily assemble the modules, and the screws are easily accessible. It also provides just enough visibility and access to allow the threading of the tether through the guides and grooved bearings, but it is a bit cumbersome, requiring needle nose pliers, tape and wire. It also allows me to test the entire unit indoors, including the planetary motor, while it is upside down. It can't actually traverse a rope or tilt the panels in the inverted orientation, so I designed a wooden Ark and Test Frame for this, but I can access the USB charger and battery packs to charge them without solar power during testing, and I can monitor and check the motors and sensors. The accelerometer can even detect that the unit is inverted to allow it enter Test Mode or Demo Mode automatically.\n\nSide Trim Left and Right\n\nThe sides of the Solar Panel Frame Assembly are reinforced by a box girder-like structure of side trim which also provide wire channels between the Circuit Boxes and Battery Frame.\n\nCorner Trim\n\nTwo corner trims cap the ends of the solar panels, acrylic and aluminum sheets, provide the end tether guide holes and allow the Circuit Boxes to be mounted underneath.\n\nBrace\n\nTwo braces add structural support to the frame assembly and also incorporate a tether guide. The open rectangular holes allow rainflow and reduce weight.\n\nThe Circuit Boxes\n\nThe Circuit Boxes contain inset boxes and screw mounts for all circuit boards, and some are even two-level mountings with circuits placed atop one-another so that I could cram in all of the circuits that I needed. For example, the UV-5RA radio is mounted atop the packet interface, Power Regulation ATtiny microcontroller is mounted atop the battery charger board, and the 5v boost converter is mounted atop the battery series relay.\n\nAll inter-module wiring is confined to the wire channels on the sides of the craft, crossing through the Battery Frame wire guides. Each Circuit Box has an aluminum cover panel which can be grounded for RF shielding. The Solar Panel Assembly heatsink can also be grounded to complete the shielding on the opposite side of the boxes.\n\nThe Radio Box\n\nThe Radio Box contains the 2 main WiFi-enabled CPUs and the amateur radio transceiver. In actual use, the craft is tilted so that the Radio Box is the higher end, nearest the tree.\n\nThe Window\n\nAll good spaceships have windows, right? This piece is not 3D printed since it had to be transparent and is a section of clear acrylic (the same type used to cover the solar panels) that acts as a window. This allows an LED Spotlight to shine down, an optional camera to take photo/video, and information on the radio's illuminated LCD display to be seen.\n\nThe Acrylic Separator\n\nThe Acrylic Separator separates the Window from the aluminum cover panel, mainly serving to prevent water from flowing underneath the panel which was too difficult to print into the Radio Box due to the underlying voids for the circuits.\n\nThe Power Regulation Box\n\nThe Power Regulation Box is at the lower end, nearest the ground. I formalized this to a left/right Trillsat Standard Orientation (TSO) and Inverted Standard Orientation.\n\nMany of the functions of the Power Regulation Box switch high and low current at various frequencies, containing its own dedicated microcontroller, boost and buck converters, different types of transistors, inductors, and DPDT relays.\n\nCPU Holder\n\nThe CPU Holder is simply a small shelf that sits above the Lithium-ion charger board to mount one of the ATtiny Microcontrollers (Huckleberry). In my first design, I had two charger boards, one atop the other, but I later damaged one of the boards which forced me to come up with a better design that only used one board and incorporated the microcontroller, so I simply designed a small mount into the shelf with holes for cable ties to secure the chip in place.\n\nQi Dock\n\nThere is also a dock which I added later, which contains a Qi wireless charging coil and circuit board. The Qi Dock covers half of the box, protruding downward with sloping sides to allow a tight tolerance for a rotating mass with a Qi receiver (Planetary Space Pod). Logistically, this isolation of the Power Regulation Box was ideal, as it reduced the wiring needed, but it also had the benefit of distancing (inverse-square law) any stray RF caused by the regulated power switching that could interfere with the audio or radio modulation.\n\nThe Battery Frame\n\nThe central Battery Frame is in the center, the nexus, or bottleneck, between the two Circuit Boxes, and is the most complex single part, structurally rigid with high compressive and tensile strength, bolted to the aluminum lower panel of the Solar Panel Frame as it has to withstand rather large mechanical forces. It contains wire channels and slots for the Battery Cover.\n\nTwo Battery Boxes\n\nWhen bolted to the aluminum, the Battery Frame forms two small boxes, which I call the Battery Boxes, which house two energy-dense Lithium-ion battery packs (3 parallel cells each). In between the two boxes is a 3-axis accelerometer (which contains its own temperature sensor) and a separate temperature sensor in-between the solar panels, which sits at the center of the 3 axes. It contains two 624vv grooved ball-bearings, acting as pulleys, and four custom, stainless steel, high-current electrical terminals that are exposed externally and are electrically isolated from the solar panel, secured in place. The cells are temperature-monitored and temperature-regulated by using all 3 heat transfer methods (radiation/emmissivity, conduction, and convection), being protected by an aluminum shield which can be grounded and is held in place by a lower Gondola.\n\nBattery Cover\n\nA cut and bent piece of aluminum sheeting acts as a Battery Cover, turning the Solar Panel Assembly and Battery Frame into true Battery Boxes. This cover protects the batteries and accelerometer from the spinning Gyrofan and is held in place by the Gondola and upward forces of the tether. If the Battery Boxes overheat in the summer, the cover acts as a heat sink, in conjunction with the Gyrofan. The underside of the Battery Cover is covered with insulating tape to prevent short-circuits as it pushes up against the battery wiring.\n\nFan Duct\n\nWhen the Gondola is assembled to the Battery Frame, it forms an active fan duct for the batteries, as the Battery Frame includes just enough space to allow the Gyro to fit inside. At the time of this writing, there are few ventilation shafts outside of the Gondola, which will eventually need to be added for effective ventilation.\n\nThe Gondola\n\nThe Gondola is the distinct, pyramidal, protruding carriage underneath the assembly that also contains it's own custom, dedicated microcontroller and Circuit Board C, along with the fan motor, which also serves as a Gyrofan, the H-Bridge and drive motor, various sensors, and pulleys. It is a \"gondola\" in the sense of a combination of a zeppelin gondola and gondola lift, which have different definitions, but it really isn't either of them, since it carries an on-board capstan winch, the gem-like zenith of the pyramidal assembly. The Gondola, from top to bottom in TSO orientation, is a sandwich of the Gyrofan, Motor Housing, Sensor Endcap, and Pulley Frame, in that order. The Gondola can be easily removed to open the Battery Boxes and test the Gyrofan.\n\nGyrofan\n\nThe Gyrofan is a gyroscope wheel with 12 pitched spokes that act as fan blades at high rpms. It contains 24 spherical cavities around the outer edge to house heavy steel balls to provide gyroscopic momentum, along with tiny ejection holes, through which a pin can be inserted to pop the balls out of the cavities during adjustment/calibration. The Gyrofan can only be tested easily when the Gondola is removed, using jumper wires to maintain the electrical connection, since it is invisible once inside the Fan Duct. This is experimental.\n\nMotor Housing\n\nThe Motor Housing is the large, finned section of the Gondola which supports the Gyrofan BLDC motor and Circuit Board C, but also houses the screwdriver drive motor and planetary gearbox.\n\nMagnet Holder\n\nInside the Motor Housing, attached to the screwdriver shaft, is the Magnet Holder which supports two rare-earth magnets, offset by 90 degrees. The holder was necessary to ensure correct angles of the magnets, as manual placing is difficult, aiding in adjustment/alignment with the Hall-effect sensors.\n\nLDR Tubes\n\nAttached to the 45-degree side fins of the Motor Housing are two LDR Tubes which house CdS Photoresistors (commonly called LDRs, Light Dependent Resistors). There are holes in the tubes and in the Motor Housing fins for the LDR wires. The Tubes are covered with thin, clear PET plastic that I cut from of an old blueberry produce container to prevent rain from entering. The tubes need to be lined with opaque inner-tubes to prevent sideways light leakage through the translucent white PETG which can skew the readings.\n\nEndcap\n\nThe end of the Motor Housing is capped with the Endcap, which insets into the housing to mechanically secure the top of the screwdriver and align two digital Hall-effect sensors (also offset by 90 degrees) just outside the diameter of the Magnet Holder. It also includes an external shaft for a DS18B20+ temperature probe, designed to allow outside air to quickly convect and conduct through the shaft for external air temperature sensing.\n\nPulley Frame\n\nThe Pulley Frame is mounted to the Endcap and also contains two 624vv ball-bearing pulleys. The taut tether applies upward force to the pulleys which helps to keep the Pulley Frame, Endcap, Gondola and Planetary Assembly firmly in place.\n\nThe Planetary Assembly\n\nThe Planetary assembly fits inside the pulley frame to the steel, hexagonal shaft from the drive motor, and the entire, heavy assembly is held in place by the force of the tether, which is quite strong. So the Capstan is strong enough to withstand these forces as well as also supporting and connecting an aluminum Planetary Rod to the orbiting Planetary Mass or Space Pod.\n\nCapstan\n\nThe Capstan is the powerhouse of the entire craft--it is like the Sun at the center of our solar system, the source of power for propulsion and orbit of the Planetary Mass, requiring a careful shape to achieved effective operation. I've been experimenting with a variation of this shape in my newer Camstan.\n\nPlanetary Rod\n\nThe Planetary Rod was not 3D-printed due to strength/weight limitations and is a solid aluminum rod that connects the orbiting mass to the Capstan. Its angle and length are critical, which are not adjustable and are printed into the Capstan and Planetary Mass. Since the Planetary Mass is heavy, the rod tends to bend and shift the drive motor shaft off-axis, so the rod hole in the Mass had to be offset to compensate for this unexpected difference. Slots had to be hacksawed into the ends of the rod to allow epoxy to form a mechanical bond with the PETG plastic (also slotted) to prevent the rod from rotating (since PETG is impervious to most glues).\n\nThe Planetary Mass or Space Pod\n\nThe Planetary Mass is the rotating mass, a hollow sphere, with an interior geometry, filled with steel balls acting as both a single, weighted mass and a ball mass damper, connected to the Capstan, that orbits the central drive motor axis. I also call it the Planetary Space Pod, since it has flattened side to allow tight tolerance for a planar, Qi receiver coil and ESP32 LoRa board (something I may add in the future) which can orbit around and dock at the Qi Dock, but at the time of this writing, it is only a placeholder a"
