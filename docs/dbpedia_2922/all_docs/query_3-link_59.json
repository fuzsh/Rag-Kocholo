        "text": "This depends on conditions such as the service area, class of service and the region in which you wish to operate. Detailed information can be found in Article 5 of the Radio Regulations. Based on the provisions under Article 5, practically every country which is signatory to the Radio Regulations determines how the spectrum is then ‘allocated’ on its territory.\n\nIn order to reduce the risk of causing or receiving harmful interference we do not generally support the submission of filings which do not conform with Article 5 of the Radio Regulations and which seek to operate on a non-interference / non-protection basis.\n\nSatellite operators are responsible for paying the relevant cost recovery fees set by the ITU for satellite filings.\n\nOfcom charges satellite operators on a cost recovery basis, as set out in our notice of charges.\n\nOnce all necessary information has been received from an operator, Ofcom aims to submit the relevant information to the ITU within 10 working days. If this is not likely to be possible, for example due to queries that need to be resolved or an abnormally high workload, we will provide an indication of how long we expect to take.\n\nOfcom will assess the efforts made by the operator to coordinate the satellite filing. If we are satisfied that reasonable efforts have been made to complete such coordination and that the satellite is not likely to cause, nor suffer from, interference from other networks, we may submit the notification request to the ITU. We may also impose additional conditions on the operation of the satellite network / system. Further guidance is available in our Procedures for the management of satellite filings (PDF, 532.2 KB)."
