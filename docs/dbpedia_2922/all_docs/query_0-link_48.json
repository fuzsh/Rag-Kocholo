The discussion is fascinating and a valuable set of observations for those who are not in the business. Why big rockets sometimes do less. Why little rockets sometimes cost more. And why every rocket has its very own, perfect mission.\n\nThere is no single, best rocket. Different rockets do different things. As it turns out, the design of a rocket flows directly from the mission the rocket is intended to do, and there are many different missions. Any given rocket is optimal for a specific orbit and payload. Its efficiency falls off as we move away from that perfect case.\n\nThe entire Blog is comprehensive and available at: https://bit.ly/42BIAOA\n\n[ANS thanks Tory Bruno, CEO of ULA and the Medium platform for the above information]\n\n+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+= +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+= +=+=+=+\n\nNeed new satellite antennas?

NASA first noticed issues with AIM’s battery in 2019, but the probe was still sending a “significant amount of data” back to Earth. NASA says AIM has now become unresponsive. Launched in 2007, AIM studied noctilucent or night-shining clouds, which can last hundreds of years in the Earth’s upper atmosphere. It was only meant to operate up for two years, but it’s provided data for multiple groundbreaking studies, including a study that found methane emissions are causing night-shining clouds to form more frequently. (ANS thanks Engadget for the above information)\n\n+ The world’s first 3D-printed rocket launched successfully on Wednesday, marking a step forward for the California company behind the innovative spacecraft, though it failed to reach orbit. Billed as less costly to produce and fly, the unmanned Terran 1 rocket launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida at 11:25 pm (0325 GMT Thursday) but suffered an “anomaly” during second-stage separation as it streamed towards low Earth orbit, according to a livestream broadcast by aerospace startup Relativity Space.

WASHINGTON — NASA is projecting spending nearly $1 billion on a tug to deorbit the International Space Station at the end of the decade to provide redundancy for safely disposing of the station. NASA released additional details March 13 about its fiscal year 2024 budget proposal. An outline of the proposal, published by the White House March 9, requested $27.2 billion for the agency, a 7.1% increase from 2023 that roughly keeps pace with inflation. One of the biggest new initiatives in the budget is the ISS deorbit tug, which would be used to perform the final lowering of the station’s orbit to ensure it reenters over the South Pacific. NASA first indicated its plans for the tug in a request for information last August, but offered few specifics about the vehicle in the budget request. [ANS thanks Jeff Foust of Space News for the above information]\n\n+Is it possible that SpaceX has succeeded in making orbital launches boring? Increasingly, the answer to this question appears to be yes. On Friday the California-based company launched two Falcon 9 rockets within the span of just a little more than four hours. At 12:26 pm local time, a Falcon 9 rocket carried 52 of SpaceX’s Starlink satellites into low-Earth orbit from a launch pad at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. A mere 4 hours and 12 minutes later, another Falcon 9 rocket delivered two large communications satellites into geostationary transfer orbit for the Luxembourg-based satellite company SES from Cape Canaveral, Florida. This broke SpaceX’s record for the shortest duration between two launches. However, the overall record for the lowest time between two launches of the same rocket still belongs to the Russian-built Soyuz vehicle. In June 2013, Roscosmos launched a Soyuz booster from Kazakhstan, and Arianespace launched a Soyuz from French Guiana within two hours. Those launches were conducted by two separate space agencies on separate continents, however. More may be found at https://bit.ly/42xueil.

Europe is in the forefront here, contributing to building the Gateway lunar station and the Orion spacecraft – set to return humans to our natural satellite – as well as developing its large logistic lunar lander, known as Argonaut. As dozens of missions will be operating on and around the Moon and needing to communicate together and fix their positions independently from Earth, this new era will require its own time. Timing is a crucial element, adds ESA navigation system engineer Pietro Giordano: “During this meeting at ESTEC, we agreed on the importance and urgency of defining a common lunar reference time, which is internationally accepted and towards which all lunar systems and users may refer to. A joint international effort is now being launched towards achieving this.” More information at https://tinyurl.com/ANS-078-Lu nar-Time.

Their Terran 1 will try to become the first 3D-printed, methane-fueled rocket to reach orbit. “There are a number of firsts here potentially on this rocket,” said Josh Brost, vice president of revenue operations at Relativity Space. “It has the chance of being the first liquid natural gas / liquid oxygen rocket to make it to orbit. It has, by far, the highest 3D-printed content of any rocket in history. We’re sitting at about 85% by mass, where I don’t think any other rocket has gone past maybe 4%.” Compared to a traditional rocket that has more than 100,000 parts, this 3D-printed rocket has less than 1,000 parts.

Initially developed by David Rowe, VK5DGR, an international team of radio amateurs are now working together on the project. FreeDV is open-source software, released under the GNU Lesser Public License (LPGL) version 2.1. The modems and Codec 2 speech codec used in FreeDV are also open source.\n\nHardware and software developers can integrate FreeDV into their projects using the FreeDV API. To operate FreeDV, radio amateurs either run the FreeDV GUI application on Windows, Linux and OSX machines or use the SM1000 FreeDV adaptor. Either method allows hams to use a single-sideband HF radio to send and receive FreeDV signals. To learn more about FreeDV, go to https://www.freedv.org.\n\nAmateur Radio Digital Communications (ARDC) is a California-based foundation with roots in amateur radio and the technology of internet communication. The organization got its start by managing the AMPRNet address space, which is reserved for licensed amateur radio operators worldwide.\n\nAdditionally, ARDC makes grants to projects and organizations that follow amateur radio’s practice and tradition of technical experimentation in both amateur radio and digital communication science. Such experimentation has led to advances that benefit the general public, including the mobile phone and wireless internet technology. ARDC envisions a world where all such technology is available through open source hardware and software, and where anyone has the ability to innovate upon it.

All satellites, whatever their function, use radio waves to transmit information to the surface of the Earth. Just as light pollution can hide a starry night sky, radio transmissions can swamp out the radio waves astronomers use to learn about black holes, newly forming stars and the evolution of galaxies.\n\nIn a paper published March 3,2023, Christopher Gordon De Pree, Deputy Electromagnetic Spectrum Manager, National Radio Astronomy Observatory; Christopher R. Anderson, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering at the United States Naval Academy; and Mariya Zheleva, Assistant Professor of Computer Science, University at Albany, State University of New York, call for creation of a national radio dynamic zone.\n\nThis zone would be similar to existing radio quiet zones, covering a large area with restrictions on radio transmissions nearby. Unlike a quiet zone, the facility would be outfitted with sensitive spectrum monitors that would allow astronomers, satellite companies and technology developers to test receivers and transmitters together at large scales. The goal would be to support creative and cooperative uses of the radio spectrum.\n\nAs the problem of radio pollution continues to grow, scientists, engineers and policymakers will need to figure out how everyone can effectively share the limited range of radio frequencies. One solution that astronomers have been working on for the past few years is to create a facility where astronomers and engineers can test new technologies to prevent radio interference from blocking out the night sky.\n\nSuch a zone doesn’t exist yet, but our team and many people across the U.S. are working to refine the concept so that radio astronomy, Earth-sensing satellites and government and commercial wireless systems can find ways to share the precious natural resource that is the radio spectrum.\n\n[ANS thanks The Conversation for the above information]\n\n+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+\n\nNeed new satellite antennas?

It would require the FCC to “modernize its rules to encourage operators to base their operations in the United States,” said House Energy and Commerce Chair Cathy Rodgers (R-Wash.), “and incentivize operators to be responsible stewards of space and spectrum in a global marketplace.”\n\n+ The Secure Space Act (HR 675) would prohibit the FCC from granting satellite licenses to foreign entities the U.S. deems a threat to national security or domestic supply chains.\n\n+ Launch Communications Act (HR 682) would streamline the process for accessing certain spectrum for performing commercial spacecraft launches and reentries.\n\n+ Precision Agriculture Satellite Connectivity Act (HR 1339) would compel the FCC would to review rule changes that could help promote space-based communications for the agriculture market.\n\n+ Advanced, Local Emergency Response Telecommunications Parity Act (HR 1353) would facilitate the use of satellites as providers of connectivity for emergency services in areas hit by natural disasters or otherwise lacking wireless communications.\n\n[ANS thanks SpaceNews for the above information]\n\nAMSAT-INDIA Participates in Science Carnival\n\nTo celebrate National Day of India on February 28 one of the biggest Science Carnival 2023 was organised by Gujarat state – India at prestigious Science City Ahmedabad during 28th February to 4th March 2023.\n\nAMSAT-INDIA was specially invited to participate in this biggest scientific exhibition for mass awareness on Amateur Radio & Satellite Communication!\n\nAMSAT-INDIA Regional Coordinator Rajesh Vagadia VU2EXP & team member Sakshi Vagadia VU3EXP did huge efforts to mass promote AMSAT activities amongst all sort of visitors which includes young kids, school-college students, budding engineers, IT Programmers, general public, professionals from various industries, scientists from renowned organization like ISRO, PRL, IPR, VSSE, ISR, officers from BSF, Police, Fire dept and citizens from every walk of life!

According to Roscosmos, the maneuver, lasting 375.8 seconds, changed the station’s velocity by 0.7 meters per second.\n\nNASA spokesperson Sandra Jones told SpaceNews March 7 that the spacecraft would have approached within about 2.7 kilometers of the station without the maneuver. She did not identify the satellite involved in the close approach to the station other than an “Argentine earth observation satellite launched in 2020.” Other sources said the satellite was NuSat-17, also called NewSat-17, one of 10 satellites launched in November 2020 by Satellogic, headquartered in Buenos Aires.\n\nA Satellogic spokesperson said late March 7 it received a conjunction data message, or CDM, from the 18th Space Defense Squadron, the Space Force unit that handles space situational awareness activities, about this close approach.\n\nThe orbit of NewSat-17 and the other nine satellites launched in 2020 have been gradually decaying, and are now crossing the orbital altitude of the ISS. That is an increasing concern for ISS operations as it and other Earth observation satellites typically operate in higher sun-synchronous orbits that will decay if not actively deorbited at the end of the missions.\n\nThe March 6 maneuver, NASA said, will not affect upcoming spacecraft going to and from the station. However, amateurs using the ARISS repeaters will want to be sure to have updated Keplerian elements that take the new orbit into account.\n\n[ANS thanks SpaceNews for the above information]\n\n+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+\n\nWant to fly the colors on your own grid expedition?\n\nGet your AMSAT car flag and other neat stuff\n\nfrom our Zazzle store!\n\n25% of the purchase price of each product goes\n\ntowards Keeping Amateur Radio in Space\n\nhttps://www.zazzle.com/amsat_gear\n\n+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+\n\nChanges to AMSAT-NA TLE Distribution\n\nTwo Line Elements or TLEs, often referred to as Keplerian elements or keps in the amateur community, are the inputs to the SGP4 standard mathematical model of spacecraft orbits used by most amateur tracking programs.

ANS publishes news related to Amateur Radio in Space including reports on the activities of a worldwide group of Amateur Radio operators who share an active interest in designing, building, launching and communicating through analog and digital Amateur Radio satellites.\n\nThe news feed on http://www.amsat.org publishes news of Amateur Radio in Space as soon as our volunteers can post it.\n\nPlease send any amateur satellite news or reports to: ans-editor [at] amsat.org\n\nYou can sign up for free e-mail delivery of the AMSAT News Service Bulletins via the ANS List; to join this list see: https://mailman.amsat.org/postorius/lists/ans.amsat.org/\n\nANS-064 AMSAT News Service Weekly Bulletins\n\nTo: All RADIO AMATEURS\n\nFrom: Radio Amateur Satellite Corporation\n\n712 H Street NE, Suite 1653\n\nWashington, DC 20002\n\nDATE 2023 Mar 05\n\nNew Satellite Distance Records\n\nIO-117 continues to provide a lot of DX fun for amateur satellite operators. Numerous satellite operators have reported receiving the ARRL’s Worked All States and DX Century Club Satellite awards lately as well as CQ Magazine’s Worked All Zones Satellite award (25 of 40 zones are required for the satellite award). For an example about the distances that can be worked via this satellite in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), two QSOs got very near the 13,000 km mark recently.\n\nOn February 11, 2023, Dave Fisher, KG0D, worked Lucky Bijanki, VU2LBW. The distance between KG0D in CN88kd and VU2LBW in MK82tv is 12,939 km.\n\nUnfortunately for this claim, Hector Martinez Sis, W5CBF, worked Oleg Vakochine, A65BR, on January 29, 2023 at 21:00 UTC. The distance between W5CBF and A65BR is 12,996 km.\n\nNote that only real-time QSOs will be considered for distance records. Under the ARRL’s current interpretation of their award rules, satellite QSOs involving delayed messaging or store-and-forward systems are not valid for WAS, DXCC, or VUCC. Thus, QSOs made over multiple orbits using this method will not be considered for inclusion in the AMSAT Satellite Distance Records archive.\n\nAlso please note that the distance calculator at k7fry.com/grid is used to calculate all distances for AMSAT records purposes. This may not provide the most accurate distance under the most recent geodetic datum standards, but it is a consistent reference.\n\nAnyone who wants to claim a distance record via an amateur satellite should check the current list at https://www.amsat.org/satellite-distance-records/ and email n8hm at arrl.net if they complete a new record distance. Audio and/or video of the QSO is encouraged but not required.\n\n[ANS thanks Paul Stoetzer, N8HM, AMSAT Executive Vice President, for the above information]\n\n+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+\n\nThe 2023 AMSAT President’s Club coins are here now!\n\nTo commemorate the 40th anniversary of its launch\n\non June 16, 1983, this year’s coin features\n\nan image of AMSAT-OSCAR 10.\n\nJoin the AMSAT President’s Club today and help\n\nKeep Amateur Radio in Space!\n\nhttps://www.amsat.org/join-the-amsat-presidents-club/\n\n+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+\n\nVUCC Satellite Standings as of March 1, 2023\n\nVUCC Satellite Award/Endorsement Change Summary for February 01, 2023 to March 01, 2023.\n\n[table “89” not found /]\n\nCongratulations to the new VUCC holders.\n\nHL2WP is first VUCC Satellite holder from South Korea and PM47\n\n[ANS thanks Jon Goering, N7AZ, for the above information]\n\n+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+\n\nNeed new satellite antennas?

Weekly updates are completely adequate for most amateur satellites. TLE bulletin files are updated Thursday evenings around 2300 UTC, or more frequently if new high interest satellites are launched. More information may be found at https://www.amsat.org/keplerian-elements-resources/\n\nThis week there are no additions or deletions to the weekly AMSAT TLE\n\ndistribution.\n\n[ANS thanks Ray Hoad, WA5QGD, AMSAT Orbital Elements Manager, for the above information]\n\nARISS News\n\nAmateurs and others around the world may listen in on contacts between amateurs operating in schools and allowing students to interact with astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station. The downlink frequency on which to listen is 145.800 MHz worldwide.\n\nQuick list of scheduled contacts and events:\n\nJumeirah College Dubai, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, telebridge via VK4KHZ (***)\n\nThe ISS callsign is presently scheduled to be NA1SS\n\nThe downlink frequency is presently scheduled to be 145.800 MHz\n\nThe scheduled crewmember is Sultan Al Neyadi KI5VTV\n\nContact is go for: Tue 2023-03-07 08:45:03 UTC 27 deg (***)\n\nThe crossband repeater continues to be active. If any crewmember is so inclined, all they have to do is pick up the microphone, raise the volume up, and talk on the crossband repeater. So give a listen, you just never know.\n\nComments on making general contacts\n\nI have been seeing a lot of traffic on Facebook and I suspect on other social media sites with people asking why they are not hearing the crew make general contacts. First off the crew is very busy on the ISS and they simply may not have the time to just pick up the microphone and talk. Also, one needs to be aware of their normal daily schedule. I have listed below the constraints that we at ARISS have to follow in order to schedule the school contacts. Hopefully this will help you better schedule your opportunities.\n\nTypical daily schedule\n\nWakeup to Workday start= 1.5 hours\n\nWorkday start to Workday end=12 hours\n\nWorkday end to Sleep= 2 hours\n\nSleep to wakeup= 8.5 hours\n\nThe crew’s usual waking period is 0730 – 1930 UTC. The most common times to find a crew member making casual periods are about one hour after waking and before sleeping, when they have personal time. They’re usually free most of the weekend, as well.\n\nSSTV events are not that often. So please check out https://www.ariss.org/ for the latest information or watch for the ARISS announcements.\n\nAnd don’t forget that the packet system is active.\n\nAs always, if there is an EVA, a docking, or an undocking; the ARISS radios are turned off as part of the safety protocol.\n\nARISS Radio Status\n\nColumbus Module radios:\n\nIORS (Kenwood D710GA) – STATUS – Configured.
