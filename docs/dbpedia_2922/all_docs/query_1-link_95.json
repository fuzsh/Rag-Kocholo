        "text": "Internet of things (IoT) has been proven to be a ubiquitous technology for several existing and new applications. It can provide both accuracy and sustainability in the emerging services and applications. IoT has several advantages and it can provide different levels of coverage in different geographical locations and contexts. There are several applications in which the wide coverage, low power and reliability of the communication have very high priorities. Conglomeration of IoT and satellite networks can make it very attractive for these applications. In this article, we present the general features, motivation and deployment issues of satellite based IoT networks. We present the applications where these satellite based IoT networks can play important roles. We also present the hybridization of narrowband IoT and satellite networks which can provide a long term sustainable network solution for several applications.\n\nIn the recent years, world has witnessed the ubiquitous applications of Internet of things (IoT) for many different scenarios. There are several critical applications where the results are essential and the mission has to be successful at any cost. Such applications are well known as mission critical applications. These applications are really critical and deal with very serious situations such as disaster management, rescue operations and military applications. IoT can provide both accuracy and sustainability in these applications. IoT in fact, is suitable for several critical applications because it can be deployed at locations where human presence is not possible due to the dangers to human life. In such cases, collection of information can be done through IoT sensors and it can be sent directly to the processing hubs. These days we find several mission critical applications where both increased reliability and coverage have very high priorities. Hybridization of IoT and satellit...\n\n—This paper focuses on the use of satellite communication systems for the support of Internet of Things (IoT). We refer to the IoT paradigm as the means to collect data from sensors or RFID and to send control messages to actuators. In many application scenarios, sensors and actuators are distributed over a very wide area; in some cases, they are located in remote areas where they are not served by terrestrial access networks and, as a consequence , the use of satellite communication systems becomes of paramount importance for the Internet of Remote Things (IoRT). The enabling factors of IoRT through satellite are: 1) the inter-operability between satellite systems and sensors/actuators and 2) the support of IPv6 over satellite. Furthermore, radio resource management algorithms are required to enhance the efficiency of IoT over satellite. In this work, we provide an integrated view of satellite-based IoT, handling this topic as a jigsaw puzzle where the pieces to be assembled are represented by the following topics: MAC protocols for satellite routed sensor networks, efficient IPv6 support, heterogeneous networks interoperability, quality of service (QoS) management, and group-based communications. Index Terms—Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Remote Things (IoRT), machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, satellite communications, wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs).\n\nMany regions in developing countries do not have any access to communication networks even though the number of devices connected through the Internet of Things (IoT) is increasing significantly. A small satellite platform could provide global network coverage in low Earth orbit to these remote locations at a low cost. This paper describes the overall mission architecture and the implementation of remote IoT using a 1U volume in 6U CubeSat platform named KITSUNE. In KITSUNE, one of the missions is to leverage IoT for building a network of remote ground sensor terminals (GST) in 11 mostly developing countries. This paper evaluates the capacity and coverage of a satellite-based IoT network for providing remote data-collection services to these countries. The amount of data that could be collected from the GSTs and forwarded accurately to the users determines the actual capacity of the Store and Forward (S&F) mission. Therefore, there are several proposed parameters to estimate this ca...\n\nThis chapter presents an overview of possibilities for existing Satellite Communication Systems utilization to provide Internet of Things Services. It is shown that existing Satellite Communication Systems provide traffic transmission for Internet of Things Systems with Cloud Architecture. The propositions on possibility of Fog and Edge computing implementation in Satellite Communication Systems are proposed. The ways for Low-Earth Orbit and Geostationary Orbit Satellite Communication Systems modernization for Fog and Edge computing implementation for the Internet of Things Systems are presented. To increase the efficiency of IoT data processing and the reliability of Internet of Things Data Storage, it is proposed to generate an Orbital Cloud Data Storage in Geostationary Orbit, which consists of several Geostationary Orbit Satellites - Cloud Computing Data Centers. Methods for access provision to the Orbital Cloud Data Storage using Geostationary Orbit High-Throughput Satellites a...\n\nOne of the key drivers for next-generation mobile communications, 5G, is the support of the Internet of Things (IoT) with billions of objects being connected to the Internet with low latency. The 5G technology will support the realization of smart cities, smart environments, and big data applications. Within the 5G framework, the terrestrial services can be augmented with the recent development of High Throughput Satellite (HTS) systems and mega-Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations. In this paper, we investigate the integration of 5G technology and IoT by means of an aerial component composed of drones and satellites for a rural scenario. The prospected system can provide enhanced services, e.g., fire alarm detection, smart agriculture, animal tracking, and plant disease control. A use case of an agriculture application consisting of a number of areas whose sensor data are collected via drones is described. The proposed architecture consists of the drones connected to a satellite system to provide the necessary network control and connectivity. Subsequently, the satellite segment is connected to the terrestrial network and then to the cloud. In this study, we refer to a rural area scenario where drones are used to detect fire alarms collecting sensors data on the field, aggregating them, and then delivering messages via satellite to a control center. An analytical model has been developed to characterize the distribution of the time to detect and deliver an alarm. This study depends on many parameters; in particular, we have investigated the impact of the area size served by a drone, the maximum sensors range, and the sensor duty cycle.\n\nExtending the internet of things (IoT) networks to remote areas under extreme conditions or for serving sometimes unpredictable mobile applications has increased the need for satellite technology to provide effective connectivity. However, existent medium access control (MAC) protocols deployed in commercial satellite networks were not designed to offer scalable solutions for the increasing number of devices predicted for IoT in the near future, nor do they consider other specific IoT characteristics. In particular, CubeSats—a low-cost solution for space technology—have the potential to become a wireless access network for the IoT, if additional requirements, including simplicity and low demands in processing, storage, and energy consumption are incorporated into MAC protocol design for satellite IoT systems. Here we review MAC protocols employed or proposed for satellite systems and evaluate their performance considering the IoT scenario along with the trend of using CubeSats for I..."
