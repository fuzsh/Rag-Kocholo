        "text": "4.2 How to submit an application by mail or using a recognized courier service\n\nThe applicant is encouraged to submit their application electronically following the instructions provided in Section 4.1 of the AO. However, if the applicant is unable to submit their application electronically, please communicate with stim-stem@asc-csa.gc.ca no later than November 16, 2022, at 1:00 p.m. (ET) to obtain instructions on how to submit a paper application by mail or using a recognized courier service.\n\nApplications by mail or using a recognized courier service must be received at the CSA no later than November 23, 2022, at 1:00 p.m. (ET).\n\nThe onus is on the applicant to ensure that their application is complete and that all documents are received by the CSA within the prescribed deadline. The CSA is not responsible for any delays under any circumstances, and will refuse applications that are received after the stipulated deadline.\n\n5.3 Evaluation Process\n\nOnly applications that have passed the eligibility assessment listed in Section 5.1 will be given further consideration.\n\nOnce the eligibility criteria are confirmed, evaluators will assess the screened applications according to the criteria listed in Section 5.2 and described in more details in Appendix C. The evaluators will include experts in the fields relevant to the proposals. Evaluators may include representatives of the Government of Canada and of other countries, as well as representatives of other governmental and non-governmental agencies and organizations. If applicable, a multidisciplinary evaluation committee will be formed to evaluate interdisciplinary applications.\n\nAn application must receive an overall minimum score of 65%, as well as achieve the minimum thresholds specified in Table 2, in order to be deemed eligible for funding.\n\nBefore a final decision is made, the CSA's program manager responsible for this AO may seek input and advice from other organizations, including municipal, provincial, territorial and federal governmental agencies and organizations.\n\nA selection committee made up of CSA experts may carry out a strategic overall selection based on CSA and Government of Canada priorities, such as:\n\nAlignment with the priorities of the CSA and of the Government of Canada;\n\nRegional geographic distribution;\n\nDiversity among universities and postsecondary institutions;\n\nRepresentation of PIs who identify as a woman and/or an Indigenous Person.\n\n6.2 Access to a suborbital flight opportunity (Stream 1)\n\nAs stated in Section 3.2 of this AO, recipients under Stream 1 may obtain the access to a test campaign from the CSA, and have their payload fly aboard an aircraft from the National Research Council Canada (NRC)'s fleet (possibly in Ottawa, Ontario) or on a stratospheric balloon (in Timmins, Ontario), depending on the functionality and purpose of the payload. To be eligible, each team responsible for the development of a payload under Stream 1 of this AO will have to deliver a Safety Data Package to the stratospheric balloon or aircraft payload manager. An assessment will then be performed to ensure that the payload meets all the requirements for a safe flight. The test campaign would occur approximately two (2) years after the issuance of the grants to the recipients.\n\nAlso, it should be noted that any access to a suborbital flight is at the entire discretion of the CSA. Projects will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, which could include but not be limited to a financial evaluation, facilities availability and suborbital flight availability.\n\n6.3 Access to Launch Opportunities (Stream 2)\n\nAs stated in Section 3.2 of this AO, recipients under Stream 2 may have the unique opportunity to launch their CubeSat into space, operate their satellite for up to a maximum of twelve (12) months and conduct their scientific experiment and/or validation of their science-related technology development from space. The CSA intends to procure launches for eligible CubeSats only. To be eligible, each CubeSat funded under this AO will have to successfully meet certain requirements, including but not limited to the following:\n\nMeet all of the launcher's interface design and safety requirements in a timely manner (requirements will be confirmed subsequently to selected recipients);\n\nObtain the appropriate licenses for all required radio frequencies in a timely manner; and\n\nHave access to ground station facility or facilities.\n\nAlso, it should be noted that any access to a launch opportunity is at the entire discretion of the CSA. Projects will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, which could include but not be limited to a financial evaluation, facilities availability and launch availability.\n\nTwo types of orbits are currently being considered by the CSA. It is recommended that the proposals submitted under this AO be developed considering one of the following two types of orbits:\n\nInternational Space Station (ISS) orbit: Nominal orbit at 400 km altitude and 51º inclination; or\n\nHigh inclination orbit: Nominal orbit at 400-500 km altitude and sun-synchronous inclination.\n\nThe CSA intends to launch eligible CubeSats approximately two (2) years after the issuance of the grants to the recipients. As such, grant recipients under Stream 2 must aim at completing their CubeSats (including having obtained the appropriate radio frequency licenses and having implemented or confirmed access to a ground station facility or facilities) within two (2) years after their project start date. The implementation schedule in the applicants' proposal under Stream 2 must reflect this timeline.\n\nThe CSA will be the liaison with the launch service provider(s). As such, the CSA will ensure that all integration requirements identified by the CUBICS teams are made known to the launch service provider(s) just as all the requirements demanded by the launch service provider(s) are made known to the CUBICS teams. No CUBICS team is to liaise directly with the launch service provider(s).\n\n7.1 Available Funding and Duration\n\nTransfer payments will be made through grant agreements. The total funding available under this AO is currently expected to be approximately $3.4 million. The two (2) funding categories are:\n\nStream 1: Maximum grant of $150,000 for a payload project, over a maximum period of up to two and a half (2.5) years;\n\nStream 2: Maximum grant of $350,000 for an end-to-end CubeSat project (2U or 3U), over a maximum period of up to three (3) years. Proposals under Stream 2 must include the development of a CubeSat, the use of a payload during an operation phase, data collection and analysis.\n\nFor this AO, the CSA intends to fund up to four (4) projects under Stream 1 and up to eight (8) projects under Stream 2. However, the overall number of grants awarded and their value can vary, are at the entire discretion of the CSA, and could depend, for example, on the availability of funds and the results of the evaluation process.\n\nGiven the objectives of this AO and the limited available budget, an eligible recipient (Canadian university or postsecondary institution) may submit multiple applications; however, if two or more applications are submitted with the same designated PI, the CSA reserves the right to select only one of these projects. An eligible recipient may submit only one application for the same project.\n\nThe CSA reserves the right to reject any proposals or reduce the amount of the grants at its entire discretion.\n\nApproved proposals will be eligible for a total amount of government assistance (federal, provincial, territorial and municipal) of up to 100% of total project costs.\n\nTo determine the amount of funding that it will allocate, the CSA will take into account the availability of CSA funds, the total cost of the project, and other confirmed sources of funds provided by other stakeholders and the applicant. The CSA reserves the right to reject any application or reduce the amount of the grants at its entire discretion.\n\nApplicants must identify all sources of funding in their applications and confirm this information in a funding agreement if the project is selected for funding. Upon completion of a project, the recipient must also disclose all sources of funding.\n\n8.5 Organizations in Quebec\n\nAn organization in Quebec whose operations are partially or fully funded by the province of Quebec may be subject to the Act Respecting the Ministère du Conseil exécutif (L.R.Q., c. M-30).\n\nUnder Sections 3.11 and 3.12 of this Act, certain entities/organizations, as defined in the meaning of the Act, such as municipal bodies, school bodies, or public agencies, must obtain authorization from the Secrétariat du Québec aux relations canadiennes (SQRC), as indicated by the Act, before signing any funding agreement with the Government of Canada, its departments or agencies, or a federal public agency.\n\nConsequently, any entity that is subject to the Act is responsible for obtaining such authorization before signing any funding agreement with the Government of Canada.\n\nQuebec applicants must complete, sign and include the M-30 Supporting Documentation form with their application.\n\n8.7 Open Access Publications\n\nIn the event that publications result from the project, the CSA wishes to promote the dissemination of findings that result from the projects it funds as quickly and to the greatest number of people as possible. Improved access to scientific results not only allows scientists to use a broader range of resources and knowledge, but also improves research collaboration and coordination, strengthens citizen engagement and supports the economy.\n\nThe CSA promotes the use of open access publication and archiving by recipients in order to facilitate the widest dissemination of findings that result from its funded projects. Thus, recipients are invited to publish their articles in a timely manner by using one of the following methods:\n\nAccessible online repository (institutional or disciplinary) so that the publication is freely accessible.\n\nJournal offering open access to articles.\n\nIt should be noted that these two methods are not mutually exclusive and that recipients are encouraged to use both.\n\nFinally, the CSA wishes to receive a courtesy copy of the publications (if not freely accessible) or hyperlink (if freely accessible) and its digital object identifier (DOI). These will be used to improve accessibility by including them in the CSA publications directory.\n\nB.3 Suggested Technical and Scientific Disciplines for Team Members\n\nTable B-1 represents a typical CubeSat project team structure based on experiences of CubeSat building teams. The structure for a payload team is similar to the CubeSat team. The differences between the two are highlighted in the table. Short team descriptions are also presented in the sections below the table.\n\nTable B-1 Typical CubeSat Project Team Composition Role Assignment Responsibilities Principal investigator (PI) Teacher / Professor Responsible for the budget, is the interface with the CSA, and assigns responsibilities to team members. The PI could also take the role as the project manager (PM) or use this opportunity to train a student to be the PM. Co-investigator(s) (Co-I) Teacher / Professor Supports the PI in all responsibility areas. Since the Co-Is can be from different postsecondary institutions, it is essential that the PI and Co-I(s) maintain regular communications. Project Manager (PM) Teacher / Professor with 1 Student Although the PI should be in direct contact with their team members to ensure optimal training, the PM (if a student takes this role) may be a conduit between the PI and the team for ad hoc communications. It is essential that the PM collaborate with all the team leads. The key responsibility is monitoring the progress of the work packages (WP) as well as planning the schedule and budget. Team lead 1 student per team There should be a team lead for the following aspects:\n\nScience (Stream 1 and 2)\n\nElectrical (Streams 1 and 2)\n\nMechanical (Streams 1 and 2)\n\nSoftware (Streams 1 and 2)\n\nSoftware (Streams 1 and 2)\n\nSystems (Streams 1 and 2)\n\nPublic Engagement (Outreach) (Streams 1 and 2)\n\nEach team lead is responsible for the delivery of the assigned WP.\n\nTeam member 1-5 students per team It is recommended that each team be assigned a minimum of one team member in addition to the team lead. This will ensure a backup in each key activity.\n\nPlease note:\n\nWhile it is possible for a student to play more than one role on the team, it is not recommended. What is most important to the project is that each member shall understand their role(s) and responsibilities right from the beginning. The team size depends on the experience of its members with space projects. CSA recommends a size of 5-10 students for Stream 1 and 10–20 students for Stream 2. Teams shall be composed of students from different cohorts to facilitate knowledge transfer if some team members graduate during the project.\n\nB.3.1 Science\n\nThe science team is a pillar of the project team, that is meant to be interdisciplinary, when it comes to tackling complex scientific questions. It is responsible for ensuring that the intended science objectives of the proposal are achieved through the payload or the CubeSat project, by contributing to the mission development, implementation and validation. The science team should involve at all times student(s) from a science faculty.\n\nB.3.2 Electrical\n\nThe electrical team looks after the power subsystems, onboard computer (OBC), interface board, attitude control subsystem, harness, circuit board design and manufacturing (or procurement) and assembly as well as electrical systems integration and testing.\n\nB.3.3 Mechanical\n\nThe mechanical team looks after the satellite structure manufacturing and assembly (including solar panels), deployment mechanism, thermal design, inhibits design and installation as well as all bill of materials (BOM). Some previous CubeSat projects (not related to this AO nor to CCP) have failed the final/progress safety review when the satellite structure could not fit smoothly into the deployer. The importance of the mechanical subsystems must not be overlooked.\n\nB.3.4 Software\n\nAlthough most of the CubeSat hardware can be purchased as a turnkey solution, turnkey software solution is not feasible. Each CubeSat has its own unique payload and hardware. The software team is responsible for writing and testing codes to ensure proper functioning from ground to space and from space to all subsystems onboard the CubeSat.\n\nB.3.5 RF Communications\n\nThe RF communications team is responsible for the design of the communication subsystem including the antenna design. It is typically the team responsible for setting up the ground station and determining the operations schedule.\n\nB.3.6 Systems\n\nThe systems team is responsible for defining and tracking the requirements of the project. It is also the responsibility of the system team to define all of the testing required, the mechanical ground support equipment (MGSE) and the electrical ground support equipment (EGSE). It supports every team in requirement definition and validation and, as such, works closely with every team. Students will gain experience in systems engineering.\n\nB.3.7 Public Engagement\n\nEach team is responsible for developing a public engagement plan that outlines how it will raise awareness of the project with the general public. The plan should include communications objectives and activities that will be developed and undertaken to achieve these objectives, as well as target audiences. Examples of public engagement activities include (but are not limited to): web content, social media activity, reaching out to the media, public presentations, and presentations to students (elementary, high-school or peers). These activities are effective tools in stimulating interest among students and the general public, but also a learning opportunity for students involved in CUBICS to develop communication skills that will serve them throughout their careers, such as experience in speaking in front of audiences and learning to communicate complex concepts to different audiences. Teams are encouraged to include students from Communications departments, and to coordinate their activities with their institution's Communications, Public Affairs or Media Relations units, as appropriate.\n\nB.4 Development Time\n\nThere are certain factors that influence the development time of a payload or CubeSat. A few of them are listed below:\n\nTeam experience with space projects: a payload or CubeSat can be built successfully only if the development guidelines are followed and milestones are respected;\n\nComplexity of the payload or CubeSat: as the satellite size becomes larger, there is more volume and power generated. The tendency is then to put in multiple payloads or a more complex payload. Consequently, building a 3U CubeSat is typically more difficult than building a 2U CubeSat. The same logic applies for the payload.\n\nBuild versus buy: Several CubeSat suppliers sell components as well as turnkey CubeSats. Buying commercial-off-the-shelf components offers the advantage of a shortened development time.\n\nThe need for testing: a CubeSat is not retrievable once it is launched. Thorough testing is primordial to the success of a satellite project. As such, it is important to allocate sufficient time in the schedule for testing each subsystem, especially for a larger or more complex CubeSat.\n\nProjects under Stream 1 (standalone scientific payload projects) should be completed within two and a half (2.5) years or less, including the test campaign (if applicable), while projects under Stream 2 (end-to-end CubeSat projects) should be completed within three (3) years or less, including the operation phase of the CubeSat (if applicable), data collection and data analysis.\n\nAs per Section 6.2, the CSA may fly eligible payloads (Stream 1) approximately two (2) years after the issuance of the grants to the recipients. Similarly, as per Section 6.3, the CSA may launch eligible CubeSats (Stream 2) approximately two (2) years after the issuance of the grants to the recipients.\n\nTable B-2 presents the timeframe planned for each stream. The CSA highly recommends that PIs recruit student team members early enough to be able to start projects immediately upon the signature of the grant agreement.\n\nB.5 Licensing Requirement\n\nThe use of RF requires close coordination to avoid unwanted interference and unauthorized usage that can jeopardize public safety. In Canada, the coordination is managed by the Directorate of Spectrum Management and Telecommunications within Innovation, Science & Economic Development (ISED). Communications with a satellite also necessitates an operations license from ISED. The procedures are fairly complex for first-time applicants, but ISED prepared a useful (and still relevant) reference document for CCP teams, entitled \"Guidance in preparing licence applications for projects funded through the CSA's Canadian CubeSat Project\".\n\nAll CubeSats that carry an instrument or payload that falls within the definition of Remote Sensing Space System (defined as one or more remote sensing satellites, the mission control centre including other facilities used to command and operate the satellites, and the facilities used to receive, store, process or distribute raw data from the satellites, even after the satellites are no longer in operation) are required to apply for a license under the Remote Sensing Space Systems Act (RSSSA). The enforcement of the RSSSA is the responsibility of Global Affairs Canada (GAC).\n\nB.7 Design and Test Reviews\n\nDesign and test reviews are essential to the success of every satellite project. They consist of meetings during which the teams present the progress of their project and the results of tests conducted on their CubeSat (Stream 2) to the CSA review team. The responsibility of the CSA review team is to assess whether there is any design issue and whether the progress satisfies the milestones. The end-goal is that the CubeSat meets all the safety requirements of the launch provider (Stream 2), hence maximizing the probability of its launch into space. As such, each CubeSat funded under Stream 2 of this AO will have to successfully pass all design and test reviews, as well as meet other requirements, including but not limited to those outlined in Section 6.3, to potentially gain access to a launch opportunity and be placed into orbit.\n\nFor Stream 1, even if the payload is not anticipated to be launched into space at the end of the project, the CSA expects the payload to reach a maturity level sufficient to be integrated into a platform such as an aircraft or a stratospheric balloon for demonstration.\n\nNASA Systems Engineering Handbook is a comprehensive guidebook on design reviews that includes a full list of deliverables for reviews. For CUBICS, the CSA has adjusted the requirements for design and test reviews to be commensurate with a typical college/university payload or CubeSat project. The project stages associated with each design and test review are described in the subsections below, while Table B-2 presents the timeframe planned for each of these stages. It also compares the timelines between a standalone scientific payload project (Stream 1) and an end-to-end CubeSat project (Stream 2).\n\nB.7.1 Mission Concept Review (MCR)\n\nAt MCR, each CUBICS team will have to answer these questions:\n\nIs the mission objective and the payload planned to be used still the same as those mentioned in the proposal?\n\nAre there any significant project changes since the proposal was written?\n\nWhat is the plan for the satellite operation? (Stream 2 only)\n\nThe MCR is an in-house activity in which all team members should participate.\n\nB.7.2 Preliminary Design Review (PDR)\n\nAs the name suggests, PDR is an opportunity for the CUBICS teams to present the preliminary design of their payload or CubeSat. The key expectations from the review team are as follows:\n\nThe complete list of components of the payload or of the CubeSat;\n\nThe layout of the components in the CubeSat (Stream 2 only);\n\nAn analysis that demonstrates that the requirement on power, mass and volume will be met;\n\nConcept for the CubeSat onboard or payload operations software development;\n\nUpdated schedule and detailed work breakdown structure (WBS); and\n\nBOM that conforms with NASA flammability and off-gassing requirements (Stream 2 only & for an ISS launch only).\n\nEach team should plan to have a minimum of one individual attend the PDR, with a typical team representation being 3 to 5 individuals.\n\nB.7.3 Critical Design Review (CDR)\n\nIn the CDR, the role of the review team is to ensure that the payload (Stream 1) or CubeSat (Stream 2) is ready for manufacturing, assembly, integration and testing (AIT). The reviewers will focus on:\n\nDetailed design of each subsystem;\n\nRequirements verification and compliance matrix;\n\nExamination of electrical circuit, harness and the handling of battery;\n\nLocation of inhibits and separation springs in the design;\n\nThe assembly, test and integration plan of the payload or CubeSat; and\n\nThe test procedures of the payload or complete CubeSat.\n\nEach team should plan to have a minimum of one individual attend the CDR, with a typical team representation being 3 to 5 individuals.\n\nB.7.4 Vibration and Environmental Tests (Stream 2 only)\n\nTeams will, at a minimum, be required to have their assembled CubeSat vibration-tested. Depending on the launcher selected, teams may be asked to carry out additional tests such as TVAC or EMC.\n\nFor the vibration and TVAC tests, any recognized facility is acceptable. Those wishing to call upon the services of the David Florida Laboratory (DFL) in Ottawa should note that the CSA cannot provide this service as part of this AO. If teams require such services, they must plan for such an expense in their budget.\n\nThe CSA will require the testing facility to forward a copy of the test results for its review and approval.\n\nUpon review of the vibration tests, the CSA will provide feedback to each team regarding their respective test results. In the event of a test failure, a strategy regarding how to move forward will be discussed and agreed upon.\n\nB.7.5 Demonstration Readiness Review (DRR) (Stream 1 only)\n\nThe DRR serves as a final milestone for Stream 1. The review will focus on:\n\nVerification and validation of payload requirements;\n\nLaboratory test results that demonstrate that the expected performance in space is achievable.\n\nB.7.6 Flight Readiness Review (FRR) (Stream 2 only)\n\nThe CSA intends to procure the launch service capacity for eligible CubeSats. If a launch opportunity is confirmed, the launch service provider will use the FRR to confirm that the completed CubeSats meet all the safety requirements. As a minimum, the following will be required:\n\nFit check report that confirms all dimensions are within the specifications of the launch service provider;\n\nVibration test report that confirms that the CubeSat meets the vibration requirement; and\n\nBattery test report that confirms safe operations of the battery;\n\nMass property.\n\nAgain, depending on the launcher selected, additional test reports might be required by the launch provider.\n\nEach team should plan on having a minimum of one (1) individual attend the FRR, although 2 to 3 representatives would be better.\n\nTable B-2 Planned Schedules and Meeting Locations Project Stage Phase Standalone Scientific Payload Project (Stream 1) End-to-End CubeSat Project (Stream 2) Location Mission Definition A 2 months 2 months MCR Milestone KOM + 2 months KOM + 2 months Local Preliminary Design B 6 months 6 months PDR Milestone KOM + 8 months KOM + 8 months SeeTable Note1 Detailed Design C 7 months 7 months CDR Milestone KOM + 15 months KOM + 15 months SeeTable Note1 AIT D 8 months 8 months Vibration and/or Environmental Tests D KOM + 23 months KOM + 23 months SeeTable Note2 DRR Milestone KOM + 24 months N/A SeeTable Note2 FRR Milestone N/A KOM + 24 months CSA\n\n(St-Hubert) Suborbital Demonstration (Stream 1) Milestone TBD N/A TBD Launch (Stream 2) Milestone N/A TBD TBD"
