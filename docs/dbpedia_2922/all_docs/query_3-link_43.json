In the recent years the activities of small satellite has been increased hence the future of small satellites in space industry. There will be soaring amount of launches in the next few years. Large constellations of small satellites are in execution stage hence it is predicted that there will be rapid change in the perception standards of satellite industries. This revolution in small satellites is due to the success of scientific goal of various national space agencies. They had succeeded in improving the interests of young amateur scientists and students. This article is dedicated to the urge of space policies that provides security and secure access to space for co-existing with different satellite users for cooperation internationally. The Article is a summary of existing policy domains and emphasis on the need for an integrated policy between various satellite operators to bring functional ecosystem in various space orbits. It also discusses about the legal issues when suppliers have different regulations with respective to various non - space faring countries, space does not belong to any nation or group and that right should be protected by all.\n\nKeywords: small satellites, earth orbit, space policy, constellations, space debris, law regulators\n\nAbbreviations\n\nSATâ€™s, satellites; LEO, low earth orbit; GER, global exploration roadmap; RR, radio regulations; MIFR, master international frequency register; SCT, secretariat of communications and transportation; FTBL, federal telecommunications and broadcasting law; IARU, international amateur radio union\n\nIntroduction\n\nSpace is a new frontier. It has open access to humankind for any peaceful activity. Space does not belong to any government nor limited to a particular organization or an individual. This reason acknowledges that all objects in space should be considered equally significant. It could be a small satellite or a large satellite, the responsibilities and liabilities have to be same. Any satellite either small or large must not create any interference or inconvenience to the operations of other satellites. The only space mission that has to be treated with top priority and negates the above said about equality of satellites is when considering a human space flight or operations that control the safety of human. Thus, there is huge importance of satellites that operate for the safety of human space flight and the safety of life back on earth.\n\nThe article discusses about the creation of space environment that is in harmony with all types of operation for small satellites. The small satellites neither should create interference to other operation in earth orbit nor be exploited by other satellites and their operators. The newly regulated space environment will allow co-existence of small satellites with other satellites for promoting space activities and their benefits. In about a decade there will be 10,000 small satellites mostly in Sun Synchronous Orbit either in operation or in dead mode; this data is calculated on the demand need of launchers. All the CubeSats will board powerful launchers as they share their ride with larger satellites. This forces them involuntarily to stay in orbit longer. A well-structured regulation has to be made because these non-operating satellites in orbit hinder the use of particular orbit for a long period due to its incapability of de-orbiting or moving to a graveyard orbit.\n\nAn international integrity has to be maintained by providing structured policy, systematic measures and recommendations of how operating and non-operating small satellites have to be held liable. Presently, the national space agency or the local government will be held liable or will be obliged to take responsibility if any damage occurs due to the space object made by an individual or organization. However this cannot be the same for a small satellite working with amateur frequency thus a well framed legal regulation has to be created. The user/manufacturers/operators of small satellites had to be educated before the launch of their small satellites about legal policies. The main topics that are studied in depth are Maneuverability, Orbital Debris, and Orbital Designation. These are the zones where the small satellite operators and users need to be educated. They should allocate fund and budget in terms of both capital and time to learn about identifying, quantifying and prioritizing domestic/international legal risks. This is very important, as they will be able to face any legal challenges. The operator irrespective of the volume and mass of the satellite must follow internationally recognized guidelines. This will help to mitigate space debris and to function properly to coordinate with Federal Law on the Authorization of Space Activities and the Establishment of a National Registry.\n\nLicensing, registration and documentation\n\nManeuverability\n\nPolicy consideration for small satellites\n\nImportant aspects of the launch\n\nConclusion\n\nThe main goals of this policy had been formulated on the principles of promoting international co-operation between the operators and users of different sizes of satellites, for the betterment of proposed future human space flight, preventing damages caused by man-made debris and improving the life of humans by continuing space exploration in a mutual peaceful environment. The policy outcome is to protect all the users of space and prosperity of human society.\n\nThere are fleets of satellites formation flying in close range are working with standards along with space database association. Orbit data exchange format standard. When we lose control of the satellite it creates fear on other spacecraft operators nearby. Or optimizes the satellite by using drag force may have impacts on nearby satellites. Hence satellite servicing is important in constellations. It is very important to know international and national rules for small satellites because the space missions should not cause harmful interference to other services or another satellite network, as a result, all frequencies should be recording in the MIRF after doing the coordination process face to ITU.\n\nThe nationalized procedure is different for example the national law of Mexico describes who are the regulatory authorities and are their capacities attributions. The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) is a federal entity that does the coordination procedure face the ITU and it will be the contact point. The procedure continues in parallel with another federal entity which is the Federal Institute of Telecommunications that grants orbital resources licenses. According to the Federal Telecommunications and Broadcasting Law (FTBL) in article 76 there are four types of Orbital Resources licenses such as Commercial Use, Private Use, Public Use and Social Use. The assigning depends on the service to offer, frequency bands to use and the procedure of coordination with another satellite network. These tasks of obtaining various permissions and licenses from both national and international recognition keep the small satellite manufacturer shy away.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe Ministry of education and science of the Russian Federation in the framework for implementation of the Program for increasing the competitiveness of Samara University among the world leading scientific and educational centres for 2013-2020 years supported this work.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nAuthors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\n\nReferences"
