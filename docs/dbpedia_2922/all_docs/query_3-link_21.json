        "text": "Summary\n\nLike many spacefaring nations, Australia has a regulatory framework to implement its international obligations to authorise and continually supervise national space activities in Australia and by Australians overseas.\n\nThe Space (Launches and Returns) Act 2018 (Cth) and its supporting Rules establish two regulatory regimes for outer space:\n\na licensing and permitting regime to regulate space activities; and\n\na liability regime to allocate liability to operators where damage occurs.\n\nAlways check with the regulator for their latest official direction, guidance and information.\n\nWhen do I need a licence or permit?\n\nYou will need a licence or permit if you intend to conduct space activities in Australia, or from overseas as an Australian national.\n\nThe Space (Launches and Returns) Act 2018 (AUS) requires a licence or permit for the following space activities:\n\nLaunch Facility Licence – required to operate a launch facility in Australia;\n\nAustralian Launch Permit – required to launch a space object from Australia;\n\nAustralian High Power Rocket Permit – required to launch a rocket that does not reach outer space but is considered a ‘high power rocket’;\n\nOverseas Payload Permit – required for Australian nationals to launch Australian payloads from overseas;\n\nReturn Authorisation – required to return a space object to Australia, or to return an Australian space object outside of Australia; and\n\nAuthorisation Certificate – required to authorise activities which are otherwise prohibited under the Act.\n\nWhy do I need a licence or permit?\n\nIt is a criminal offence under the Space (Launches and Returns) Act 2018 (AUS) to conduct space activities without a licence or permit.\n\nOffences against the Act will attract a penalty of up to 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of up to AUD$1.15 million for an individual.\n\nIn the case of a corporation, an offence will attract a fine of up to AUD$21 million.\n\nThere are liability consequences for operators who conduct space activities without holding the proper licences and permits.\n\nIn the event of a claim for compensation, you will not benefit from the same limits to liability that would have applied if you held appropriate authorisation under the Act.\n\nWhat licences or permits will I need?\n\nThe Space (Launches and Returns) Act 2018 (AUS) regulates – through issuing licences and permits – Australian launches and returns, launch facilities and high power rockets. The Act operates extraterritorially – it also applies to Australian nationals (including Australian entities) conducting space activities from other countries.\n\nLaunch Facility Licence\n\nIf you intend to operate a ‘launch facility‘ in Australia, you will need to hold a launch facility licence.\n\nA ‘launch facility’ includes:\n\nAny fixed or mobile facility that is specifically designed or constructed to be capable of launching a space object.\n\nThis also includes all other facilities necessary to conduct a launch, such as mission control facilities.\n\nIn addition to the launch facility licence, you may also need an Australian launch permit to conduct a launch from the launch facility that you own or operate. If the launch facility is provided by a third party, that third party is responsible for obtaining the necessary launch facility licence, but you will need to obtain the Australian launch permit.\n\nAustralian Launch Permit (For Launches Within Australia)\n\nIf you intend to conduct a space launch from Australia, you will need to hold an Australian launch permit. This permit covers the ‘launch’ of a ‘space object’ from a fixed or mobile launch facility or from aircraft in flight in Australian airspace. A permit may also authorise the return of space objects.\n\nA ‘space object’ includes:\n\nAny object or part that is intended to reach ‘outer space’, which, for the purposes of this legislation only, means, to reach an altitude higher than 100 kilometres above sea level.\n\nNote that the delimitation between airspace and outer space is a matter of international controversy, and you should not assume that the 100 kilometre limit applies in any other context.\n\nA ‘launch’ includes:\n\nAny attempt to launch the object or any part of it into outer space.\n\nWhere appropriate, a single permit may be granted to authorise multiple space objects or a series of launches without needing a separate permit for each space object or launch.\n\nAustralian High Power Rocket Permit\n\nIf you intend to launch a rocket that does not reach outer space but is nonetheless a ‘high power rocket’, you will need an Australian high power rocket permit. This permit covers the launch of a high power rocket from a fixed or mobile launch facility or place in Australia.\n\nA ‘high power rocket’ includes:\n\nAny rocket fitted with an active control system or propelled by motors with a combined impulse greater than 889,600 Newton seconds.\n\nYou may also need to consider obtaining other licences or permits required by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority under aviation law.\n\nOverseas Payload Permit (For Launches Outside Australia)\n\nYou will need to hold an overseas payload permit if you are an Australian citizen, resident or entity who intends to conduct a space launch from outside Australia. This permit covers the launch of space objects from a fixed or mobile launch facility or place outside Australia.\n\nReturn Authorisation\n\nYou will need to hold a return authorisation if you intend to return a space object to Australia, or return an object to a place outside Australia. Where appropriate, a single return authorisation may be issued to cover a series of returns without needing a separate authorisation for each.\n\nA ‘return’ includes:\n\nAny attempt to return a space object from an area beyond 100 kilometres above sea level.\n\nAuthorisation Certificate\n\nAn authorisation certificate is an approval to conduct an activity that would otherwise be prohibited under the Space (Launches and Returns) Act 2018 (AUS). The certificate covers any activity that is conducted without a licence or permit, such as operating a launch facility, or conducting a launch or return.\n\nThis authorisation is intended to add flexibility and discretion to the licensing regime, allowing temporary exceptions for unforeseen technologies or circumstances that are not captured under the current regulatory framework.\n\nIMPORTANT TO KNOW\n\nAn overseas payload permit only meets Australian requirements for launching a space object overseas. You will also need to hold the proper authorisations to launch from your host country.\n\nUSE CASE EXAMPLE\n\nAngela wants to know what licences or permits she will need for her space operations.\n\nAngela from ANGELS Aerospace is planning to launch a sounding rocket from New Zealand under a launch services agreement with Andromeda Space.\n\nAngela has programmed the rocket to make its landing in a remote area in Western Australia. Angela is an Australian citizen and will be a responsible party for the launch in New Zealand.\n\nOverseas Payload Permit: As the responsible party for the launch, Angela will need to apply for an Overseas Payload Permit to launch her rocket from New Zealand as an Australian citizen.\n\nReturn Authorisation: Angela will also need a Return Authorisation to authorise the return of her rocket to Western Australia.\n\nNew Zealand Licenses and Permits: As the launch will be conducted under a launch services agreement, Andromeda Space will be responsible for holding the necessary NZ licences or permits to launch Angela’s rocket.\n\nLink sources\n\nVisit the Australian Space Agency’s website for more information on the 2019 Rules.\n\nhttps://www.industry.gov.au/regulations-and-standards/space-regulation\n\nVisit the Australian Space Agency’s website for more information on the proposed application fees under the 2018 Act.\n\nhttps://consult.industry.gov.au/space/cost-recovery-implementation-statement/\n\nVisit the Parliament of Australia’s website for more information on the background and purpose of the 2018 Act.\n\nhttps://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/bd/bd1819a/19bd015\n\nHow do I get a licence or permit?\n\nHow will my application be assessed?\n\nThe Space (Launches and Returns) Act 2018 (AUS) and its supporting Rules set criteria and application requirements that an applicant must satisfy before obtaining a licence or permit.\n\nThe supporting Rules consist of:\n\nSpace (Launches and Returns) (General) Rules 2019 (AUS)\n\nSpace (Launches and Returns) (High Power Rocket) Rules 2019 (AUS) – commencing on 30 June 2020\n\nSpace (Launches and Returns) (Insurance) Rules 2019 (AUS)\n\nThe Australian Space Agency will not start assessing applications for high power rocket activity until 30 June 2020.\n\nRequirements:\n\nYou are technically competent to operate the launch facility;\n\nYou have obtained all necessary environmental approvals under Australian law;\n\nYou have an adequate environmental plan for the construction and operation of the launch facility;\n\nYou have sufficient funding to construct and operate the launch facility;\n\nThe risk of the launch facility causing substantial harm to public safety or damage to property is as low as is reasonably practicable;\n\nThere are no reasons relevant to the international relations, or the national security or defence of Australia to deny a launch facility licence; and\n\nYou meet any other criteria prescribed by the Space (Launches and Returns) (General) Rules 2019 (AUS).\n\nRequirements:\n\nYou are technically competent to conduct the launch and return;\n\nYou meet the insurance/financial requirements for the launch and return;\n\nThe risk of the launch and return causing substantial harm to public safety or damage to property is as low as is reasonably practicable;\n\nUnless otherwise approved by the Minister, the space objects concerned are not and do not contain a nuclear weapon, a weapon of mass destruction or a nuclear power source;\n\nThere are no reasons relevant to the international relations, or the national security or defence of Australia to deny a launch permit; and\n\nYou meet any other criteria prescribed by the Space (Launches and Returns) (General) Rules 2019 (AUS).\n\nAdditional Criteria:\n\nThe launch vehicle is effective and safe as is reasonably practicable having regard to the purpose of the launch;\n\nThe flight path is effective and safe as is reasonably practicable, having regard to the purpose of the launch, the design of the launch vehicle and the launch safety standards in the Flight Safety Code;\n\nThe risk hazard analysis for each launch and any connected return is consistent with the Flight Safety Code; and\n\nThere is adequate planning to address the environmental impacts of the launch or launches and any connected return.\n\nRequirements:\n\nYou are technically competent to conduct the launch;\n\nYou meet the insurance/financial requirements for the launch;\n\nThe risk of the launch and return causing substantial harm to public safety or damage to property is as low as is reasonably practicable;\n\nThere are no reasons relevant to the international relations, or the national security or defence of Australia to deny a launch permit; and\n\nYou meet any other criteria prescribed by the Space (Launches and Returns) (High Power Rocket) Rules 2019 (AUS).\n\nAdditional Criteria:\n\nThe high power rocket is effective and safe as is reasonably practicable having regard to the purpose of the launch;\n\nThe flight path is effective and safe as is reasonably practicable, having regard to the purpose of the launch, the design of the rocket and the launch safety standards in the Flight Safety Code;\n\nThe risk hazard analysis for the launch is consistent with the Flight Safety Code; and\n\nThere is adequate planning that addresses the environmental impacts of the launch.\n\nRequirements:\n\nYou meet the insurance/financial requirements for the launch and return;\n\nThe risk of the launch causing substantial harm to public safety or damage to property is as low as is reasonably practicable;\n\nUnless otherwise approved by the Minister, the space objects concerned are not and do not contain a nuclear weapon, a weapon of mass destruction or a nuclear power source; and\n\nThere are no reasons relevant to the international relations, or the national security or defence of Australia to deny an overseas payload permit.\n\nRequirements:\n\nYou are technically competent to conduct the return;\n\nYou meet the insurance/financial requirements for the launch and return;\n\nThe risk of the return causing substantial harm to public safety or damage to property is as low as is reasonably practicable;\n\nUnless otherwise approved by the Minister, the space objects concerned are not and do not contain a nuclear weapon, a weapon of mass destruction or a nuclear power source;\n\nThere are no reasons relevant to the international relations, or the national security or defence of Australia to deny a launch permit; and\n\nYou meet any other criteria prescribed by the Space (Launches and Returns) (General) Rules 2019 (AUS).\n\nAdditional Criteria:\n\nEach return is effective and safe as is reasonably practicable having regard to the purpose of the return, the design of the space object and the Flight Safety Code;\n\nThe risk hazard analysis for each return is consistent with the Flight Safety Code; and\n\nYou have the appropriate environmental approvals and environmental plans for conducting the return.\n\nThis additional criteria will not apply to payloads returning to a place or area outside Australia.\n\nUnder Rule 119 of the General Rules, the Minister must consider various factors in deciding whether to issue an authorisation certificate.\n\nConsiderations:\n\nWhether you are technically competent to conduct the activity concerned;\n\nWhether the Commonwealth is at risk of being exposed to liability for damage;\n\nWhether there is an unsatisfactory risk of liability to the Commonwealth if insurance is not held;\n\nWhether the risk of causing substantial harm to public safety or damage to property is as low as is reasonably practicable;\n\nWhether your activities involve a nuclear weapon or a weapon of mass destruction of any other kind;\n\nWhether there are reasons relevant to the international relations, or the national security or defence of Australia to deny an authorisation certificate; and\n\nWhether a permit or licence would be more appropriate to authorise the conduct.\n\nHow can I get started with a licence or permit?\n\nHow much does an application cost?\n\nCurrently, fees under the Space (Launches and Returns) Act 2018 (AUS) are still under consideration. The draft Cost Recovery Implementation Statement from the Australian Space Agency suggested an estimate of fees to assess applications. However, the Australian Space Agency is not currently charging fees for applications, pending a further round of consultations (see here under ‘Fees’). The Australian Space Agency will release the finalised fees and costings after further consultation and after a policy decision has been approved by the Government.\n\n5. Prepare and submit your application\n\nAs far as possible, you should ensure that all information contained in your application is true, accurate, and complete.\n\nUpdating information during the application process may cause unnecessary delay, although the Rules specifically allow for updates.\n\nWhat happens if my application is rejected?\n\nIf your application for a licence or permit is rejected, you are entitled under the Act to seek external review of the decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.\n\nIf you are aggrieved by a particular decision, you should seek legal advice on your available options.\n\nComparing foreign licensing regimes\n\nKey features:\n\nThe New Zealand space licensing regime does not charge fees for an application, or for holding a licence or permit.\n\nNew Zealand currently recognises licences from certain jurisdictions as meeting their licence or permit requirements.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand offer equivalent space licences and permits.\n\nPrimary regulator:\n\nThe primary regulator of space activities in New Zealand is the NZ Space Agency.\n\nWant to learn more about space law in New Zealand? Visit our article on New Zealand space law.\n\nKey features\n\nThe United States offers three different licences and permits: Launch/Re-entry Vehicles Specific Licence, Operator licence, Experimental Permits for Reusable Suborbital Rockets.\n\nThe costs of launching activities in the United States depends on various factors, including: the launch vehicle used, size and destination of the payload and insurance requirements, among others.\n\nLicence holders are required to make a reciprocal waiver of claims with the relevant parties involved in launch or re-entry services under which each party agrees to be responsible for personal injury to, death of, or property damage or loss sustained by it or its own employees resulting from an activity carried out under the applicable licence.\n\nSpace operators are subject to ongoing monitoring by the Federal Administration Authority to ensure compliance with licence conditions.\n\nGovernment regulators:\n\nThe regulation of space activities in the United States is split between several federal government agencies:\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC)\n\nThe National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n\nThe Department of Commerce\n\nWant to learn more about space law in the United States? Visit our article on United States space law.\n\nKey features\n\nThe United Kingdom offers licences for three primary licence activities: Operator, Spaceport and Range Control.\n\nThe granting of licences is controlled by the prescribed Regulator.\n\nRegulations, including insurance requirements, are still in the process of being drafted.\n\nPrimary regulator:\n\nThe primary regulator of space activities in the United Kingdom is the UK Space Agency.\n\nWant to learn more about space law in the United Kingdom? Visit our article on United Kingdom space law.\n\nKey features\n\nFrance separates ‘launch’ and ‘command’ phase, enabling ease in apportioning liability in the case of damage.\n\nFrance offers obtainable licences in addition to case-by-case authorisation, with lack of clarity surrounding costs.\n\nThe French space licensing regime has clear insurance requirements and regulations regarding liability.\n\nPrimary regulator:\n\nThe primary regulator of space activities in France is Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES).\n\nWant to learn more about space law in France? Visit our article on French space law.\n\nKey features\n\nLaunches are conducted through the Indian government, and there is an established commercial framework with government owned launch provider ‘Antrix’.\n\nIndian launch vehicles have flight heritage, having successfully launched hundreds of foreign space objects.\n\nThere is a lack of legislation, leading to potential for discretion and uncertainty.\n\nPrimary regulator:\n\nThe primary regulator of space activities in India is the Indian Space Research Organisation.\n\nWant to learn more about space law in India? Visit our article on Indian space law.\n\nKey features\n\nUnlike other space-faring nations, China does not have comprehensive laws to regulate space activities.\n\nLicence holders are subject to continuing supervision and obligations under Chinese regulations.\n\nInsurance for space activities is compulsory under the Chinese regulatory regime.\n\nPrimary regulator:\n\nThe primary regulator of space activities in China is the State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence (SASTIND).\n\nWant to learn more about space law in China? Visit our article on Chinese space law.\n\nCould I be liable if my space activities cause damage?\n\nThe Space (Launches and Returns) Act 2018 (AUS) imposes liability consequences on operators who cause damage to others in the course of their operations, or conduct space activities without holding the necessary authorisations or insurance coverage. Part 4 of the Act establishes rules and procedures to determine the liability of operators when damage to persons and property occurs.\n\nYou can learn more about your insurance obligations and the Australian space liability regime by accessing our article on liability and insurance.\n\nWhat to do next\n\n1. Enquire about insurance coverage for your operations\n\nAs a holder of a licence or permit, you will be required to hold a minimum amount of insurance.\n\nYou should contact an insurer to discuss your coverage.\n\n2. Become familiar with your licence conditions\n\nIf you are granted a licence or permit, you will be required to comply with conditions prescribed by the Act, its supporting Rules and your licence or permit itself.\n\nStandard conditions involve general compliance with provisions of the Act and reporting changes of circumstance to the Minister.\n\nImportant to know\n\nContravening a licence condition has serious implications under the Act:\n\nBreaches attract a penalty of $210,000 and could potentially result in your licence being revoked or suspended.\n\nIn the event you cause damage as a result of a breach, your liability will not be limited.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat happens if my information changes during the application process?\n\nIf you become aware of any changes to information that is relevant or required under your application, you must update your application and notify the Minister of the change.\n\nHow long will it take to process my application?\n\nThe Space Activities (Launches and Returns) Act 2018 (AUS) does not set a statutory timeframe for processing applications.\n\nThe time it will take to process your application will depend on the licence or permit you are applying for and the completeness of the information you have provided.\n\nIt is recommended that you keep in close contact with the Australian Space Agency regarding updates on your application.\n\nWhat is the process for reviewing a decision to reject my licence/permit application?\n\nThe Administrative Appeals Tribunal will conduct an external review.\n\nAn external review will examine the legality, procedure and merits of the original decision, and make a fresh decision in relation to your application.\n\nThe right to external review is not limited only to a decision to reject your application. It also applies to other adverse decisions under the Act, such as the suspension or revocation of a licence or permit.\n\nRelated articles\n\nLaws Applicable to Liability and Insurance\n\nLearn more about the Australian space liability regime, the rules and procedures for determining liability, and your options and o...\n\nRead more\n\nAviation Law\n\nIn addition to Australian space law, space activities that operate through Australian airspace are generally regulated by the Civi...\n\nRead more\n\nSpectrum Regulation\n\nUse of the electromagnetic spectrum is the main way we communicate with objects in space.
