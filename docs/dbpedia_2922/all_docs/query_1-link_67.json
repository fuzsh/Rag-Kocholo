        "text": "Progress in spaceflight research has led to the introduction of various manned and unmanned reusable space vehicle concepts, opening up uncharted opportunities for the newborn space transport industry. For future space transport operations to be technically and commercially viable, it is critical that an acceptable level of safety is provided, requiring the development of novel mission planning and decision support tools that utilize advanced Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) technologies, and allowing a seamless integration of space operations in the current Air Traffic Management (ATM) network. A review of emerging platform operational concepts is conducted, highlighting both the challenges and the opportunities brought in by the integration with conventional atmospheric air transport. Common launch and re-entry planning methodologies are then discussed, where the physical and computational limitations of these approaches are identified and applicability to future commercial space transport operations is assessed. Attention is then turned to the on-orbit phase, where the unique hazards of the space environment are examined, followed by an overview to the necessary elements required for space object de-confliction and collision avoidance modelling. The regulatory framework evolutions required for spacecraft operations are then discussed, with a focus on space debris mitigation strategies and operational risk assessment. Within the atmospheric domain, possible extensions and alternatives to the conventional airspace segregation approaches are identified including promising Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) techniques to facilitate the integration of new-entrant platforms. Lastly, recent modelling approaches to meet on-orbit risk criteria are discussed and evolutionary requirements to improve current operational procedures are identified. These insights will inform future research on CNS/ATM and Avionics (CNS + A) systems and associated cyber-physical architectures for Space Traffic Management (STM).\n\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) is a new observation innovation technology intended to help modernize the air transportation framework. It gives foundational innovation to enhancements identified with the cutting edge Air Transportation System. Since ADS-B will wind up planning compulsory by 2020 for most airspaces, it is imperative that viewpoints, for example, limit, applications, and security are examined by an autonomous research group. One of the objectives of ADS-B is to expand security of air activity. While the security of ADS-B was already addressed, in this paper we show that assaults are both simple and essentially practical, for a reasonably complex assailant. Created and confirmed as a reasonable low-cost swap for ordinary radar, ADS-B permits Air Traffic Controller to screen and control planes with more prominent accuracy and over a far bigger rate of the world's surface than has at any point been conceivable some time recently. The ADS-B convention has no implicit security instruments, which renders ADS-B frameworks powerless against an extensive variety of pernicious assaults. This study first abridges the assaults and issues that have been accounted for in connection to ADS-B security. From that point, it overviews both the hypothetical and useful endeavors which have been beforehand directed concerning these issues, including conceivable security measures. The work and functionality performed by the space satellite will be taken over by highly sophisticated and dedicated point satellites which are concentric towards aircraft navigation. The point satellite which is kept at the distance of just 200 to 440 miles to avoid atmospheric interference. Lesser distance will help in speedy communication and most importantly will support ADS-B ground requirements, hence curbing the problem of signal shortage over oceanic regions, which is one of the main short comes in Aviation Transport Tracking.

The value of formation flight is assessed using a coupled systems engineering and science evaluation model, driven by Model Based Systems Engineering and Observing System Simulation Experiments. Albedo errors are calculated against bi-directional reflectance data obtained from NASA airborne campaigns made by the Cloud Absorption Radiometer for the seven major surface types, binned using MODIS' land cover map â€“ water, forest, cropland, grassland, snow, desert and cities. A full tradespace of architectures with three to eight satellites , maintainable orbits and imaging modes (collective payload pointing strategies) are assessed. For an arbitrary 4-sat formation, changing the reference, nadir-pointing satellite dynamically reduces the average albedo error to 0.003, from 0.006 found in the static reference case. Tracking pre-selected waypoints with all the satellites reduces the average error further to 0.001, allows better polar imaging and continued operations even with a broken formation. An albedo error of 0.001 translates to 1.36 W/m 2 or 0.4% in Earth's outgoing radiation error. Estimation errors are found to be independent of the satellites' altitude and inclination, if the nadir-looking is changed dynamically. The formation satellites are restricted to differ in only right ascension of planes and mean anomalies within slotted bounds. Three satellites in some specific formations show average albedo errors of less than 2% with respect to airborne, ground data and seven satellites in any slotted formation outperform the monolithic error of 3.6%. In fact, the maximum possible albedo error, purely based on angular sampling, of 12% for monoliths is outperformed by a five-satellite formation in any slotted arrangement and an eight satellite formation can bring that error down four fold to 3%. More than 70% ground spot overlap between the satellites is possible with 0.5Â° of pointing accuracy, 2 Km of GPS accuracy and commands uplinked once a day. The formations can be maintained at less than 1 m/s of monthly Î”V per satellite.\n\nIn an era of significant air traffic expansion characterised by a rising congestion of the radiofrequency spectrum and a widespread introduction of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are being exposed to a variety of threats including signal interferences, adverse propagation effects and challenging platform-satellite relative dynamics. Thus, there is a need to characterize GNSS signal degradations and assess the effects of interfering sources on the performance of avionics GNSS receivers and augmentation systems used for an increasing number of mission-essential and safety-critical aviation tasks (e.g., experimental flight testing, flight inspection/certification of ground-based radio navigation aids, wide area navigation and precision approach). GNSS signal deteriorations typically occur due to antenna obscuration caused by natural and man-made obstructions present in the environment (e.g., elevated terrain and tall buildings when flying at low altitude) or by the aircraft itself during manoeuvring (e.g., aircraft wings and empennage masking the on-board GNSS antenna), ionospheric scintillation, Doppler shift, multipath, jamming and spurious satellite transmissions. Anyone of these phenomena can result in partial to total loss of tracking and possible tracking errors, depending on the severity of the effect and the receiver characteristics. After describing GNSS performance threats, the various augmentation strategies adopted in the Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management and Avionics (CNS+A) context are addressed in detail. GNSS augmentation can take many forms but all strategies share the same fundamental principle of providing supplementary information whose objective is improving the performance and/or trustworthiness of the system. Hence it is of paramount importance to consider the synergies offered by different augmentation strategies including Space Based Augmentation System (SBAS), Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS), Aircraft Based Augmentation System (ABAS) and Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). Furthermore, by employing multi-GNSS constellations and multi-sensor data fusion techniques, improvements in availability and continuity can be obtained. SBAS is designed to improve GNSS system integrity and accuracy for aircraft navigation and landing, while an alternative approach to GNSS augmentation is to transmit integrity and differential correction messages from ground-based augmentation systems (GBAS). In addition to existing space and ground based augmentation systems, GNSS augmentation may take the form of additional information being provided by other on-board avionics systems, such as in ABAS. As these on-board systems normally operate via separate principles than GNSS, they are not subject to the same sources of error or interference. Using suitable data link and data processing technologies on the ground, a certified ABAS capability could be a core element of a future GNSS Space-Ground-Aircraft Augmentation Network (SGAAN). Although current augmentation systems can provide significant improvement of GNSS navigation performance, a properly designed and flight-certified SGAAN could play a key role in trusted autonomous system and cyber-physical system applications such as UAS Sense-and-Avoid (SAA)."
