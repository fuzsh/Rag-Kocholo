        "text": "The Glenn Lightsey Research Groupâ€™s Space Systems Design Lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology is sponsoring a 1U CubeSat mission that will include a digital robot. The primary function of the GT-1 satellite is to serve as an educational proof of concept and satellite bus demonstrator. Georgia Tech will use this mission as an opportunity for undergraduates to get involved in all facets of a space mission, from design to implementation and support.\n\nGT-1 will test a prototype deployable antenna and solar panels, which can be used for future missions derived from the same baseline design, and with inclusion of additional experimental equipment. It will operate with AX.25 protocol telemetry."
