        "text": "Two different people from two different worlds do a testament that will change their world forever. Keng is a young boy who left his hometown to study in Bangkok and lives with Tai, a friend who is the same age as him. Keng's dream is to pursue further study in China in order to look after his mom, with whom he was separated. Life starts to change unexpectedly. He has to help Boang, a boy who delivers drugs, from being attacked by a group of gangsters in which 'Hia Song' and Nick are the members. After that, that gangster group constantly harasses both because they think Keng and Boang secretly store good drugs. Consequently, Keng has to flee home to reside with Boang in a remote place. From that day, they start to understand each other; a tale of friendship and love between two teenagers is born.
