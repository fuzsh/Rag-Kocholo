        "text": "UPDATE June 17, 2020: I swapped out four titles. Gone are Saraband, War and Peace, The Cloud-Capped Star, and Lawrence of Arabia. The first three didn’t feel like favorites any longer on recent rewatches. As for Lawrence, while I know I liked it, none of it has really stuck with me except for a couple of spare moments, it just didn’t belong. In their place, I added The Wolf House (La Casa Lobo), Sing Street, Sorry to Bother You, and Young Frankenstein. The first three are recent movies that really struck a chord with me. YF is an old, old favorite that I thought had lost its appeal, but when I showed it to my wife, all the magic returned.\n\nThe bad news for the list overall is that it’s (slightly) more heavily weighted towards English-language films. The good news is that it’s (slightly) more recent and fresh. Also not quite so dominated by Ingmar Bergman. Unfortunately I don’t have reviews to link to for the new entries, however.\n\nIt’s been a few years since I updated my list of favorite films. Which makes sense because I’ve seen so few movies in those years that I have nothing “new” to add, at least in terms of something I hadn’t seen before. Still, every now and then I’d revisit a movie and think “Maybe this one is too high, I should move it down a little.” Or “I really do love this, I should make room for it on my list.” Tastes change. So I thought I’d take a stab at it. But as I agonized over chart positions, I was struck by how meaningless all this ranking stuff is. I would mentally pit one film against another to determine which I “liked” “more” and almost always the answer was… “well, it depends.” And then there was the question of what deserved to be in the prestigious Top 100 and what would be relegated to the less-flashy “Top 101-250” (ugh, I’ve always hated that clunky title) list.\n\nSo I said to hell with it. No more numbers, no more ranking. I took my previously ranked top 100, crammed it together with my unranked 101-250, threw out some movies I wasn’t quite as smitten with anymore, added some I had grown fonder of, then alphabetically ordered them into one egalitarian superlist. And I liked it! Okay sure, if you put a gun to my head and asked me to name my #1 all-time fave, chances are I’m gonna blurt out Fanny and Alexander, but goddamn it I can’t be bothered to wring my hands over what should be #74 and what should be #75. I could really throw caution to the wind and just list all the movies I love without making it conform to a nice round number. But hell, there’s got to be some hand-wringing over these things, that’s part of the fun.\n\nOkay, enough prelude, here we go!

First of all, I regret that I don’t have better reviews to link to for a lot of these. Some of them are very brief (I think one is just a quote from the movie!) and a couple aren’t especially positive. But oh well. Some of them I just never wrote a decent review for, and I sure don’t have the time to do it now.\n\nAlphabetization can be tricky when dealing with foreign language titles. I’ve tried to go with the titles most commonly used in America. For Pratidwandi and Jana Aranya I used the English translations because I suspect that’s what Criterion will do when they eventually release them. I also maintained consistency in ordering without using leading articles, as in El Norte and I Fidanzati. One English title presented a problem: Betrayed is just as commonly referred to as When Strangers Marry. I opted for the former to match Warner’s DVD release.\n\nThere were 27 revisions to the list. I didn’t remove any films that were in my previous top 100, but gone from the old “101-250” list are:\n\nAmélie\n\nAnnie Hall\n\nBand of Outsiders\n\nClose-Up\n\nCrimes and Misdemeanors\n\nCry of the City\n\nLe Doulos\n\nDying at Grace\n\nF for Fake\n\nForce of Evil\n\nGoodbye Solo\n\nUn homme qui dort\n\nHoop Dreams\n\nKanal\n\nKill Bill\n\nThe Letter Never Sent\n\nLove and Death\n\nMetropolis\n\nNapoleon\n\nThe Phenix City Story\n\nPlay Time\n\nPsycho\n\nSerenity\n\nTalk to Her\n\nViridiana\n\nWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\n\nWild Strawberries\n\nWoody Allen loses big here. He simply creeps me out now to the point where I can’t enjoy his movies like I used to. Likewise, Talk to Her is a great movie but problematic to a degree I can no longer ignore. It’s a shame to lose three documentaries but as much as I admire the ones I removed and would recommend them, they’re not films I would go back to or are special to me. I also lost three noirs, but replaced them with three that are dearer to me. I just watched Wild Strawberries again the other day, and while I think it’s fantastic, it’s just not crying out to me to be included. There’s nine other Bergmans on the list so it’s probably okay. Let’s see, what else? I felt that Wallace & Gromit were already covered well enough with Wrong Trousers. Some of these are movies I could easily have in my library and yet I haven’t felt compelled to buy them, which made them easy cuts. And then there’s some I still really like but there were others I preferred to include.\n\nSo let’s get to the additions:\n\nThe Big Combo\n\nBlazing Saddles\n\nCocorico Monsieur Poulet\n\nDistant Voices, Still Lives\n\nDuck Season\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back\n\nThe Enigma of Kaspar Hauser\n\nFemale on the Beach\n\nIn the Heat of the Sun\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade\n\nThe Kid With a Bike\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\n\nLost in America\n\nLove Exposure\n\nMind Game\n\nThe Organizer\n\nPickup on South Street\n\nLa Promesse\n\nQuadrophenia\n\nRide the Pink Horse\n\nSmiles of a Summer Night\n\nThe Son\n\nSpirited Away\n\nSwimming to Cambodia\n\nThat Obscure Object of Desire\n\nThe Wind Will Carry Us\n\nA Zed and Two Noughts\n\nSome of these were added because recent rewatches warmed me up to them: Distant Voices, Mind Game, and Smiles of a Summer Night. Those were all in the past month and really were the impetus for redoing this list. A couple — The Empire Strikes Back and Lord of the Rings — are populist choices that I realized I was snubbing purely out of snobbery. Likewise, some are old favorites that I maybe don’t “rate” as highly as others for whatever reasons, but they have a special place in my heart: Lost in America, Last Crusade, Swimming to Cambodia and Blazing Saddles. As you can see, we have our three new noirs. And I realized that the Dardenne brothers are more precious to me than I previously gave them credit for, with three new entries. I’m pleased to bring slightly more animation to my list as well.\n\nSome notes on the list as a whole…. there are 21 films that I’ve only seen once. I was going to list them, but screw it, I’ve done enough listing things for one day. Almost all of them were on the chopping block at some point as I agonized over what to include. After all, to what extent can you call a film a “favorite” if you haven’t even bothered to see it a second time? But sometimes a single viewing can leave a big impact, and they’re all movies I look forward to seeing again, when the time is right (sadly, six of the 21 still have no decent home video release in this country).\n\nOnly seven films directed by women on my list, which I’m not proud of. There are several others I would call honorable mentions, but there’s no denying that females are under-represented in my list. Part of this I can blame on an industry that is extremely gender-imbalanced. But I should really do more to seek out films by women. Also there are only a scant few movies by African-Americans, another area where my filmic education has room for expansion. Doing a bit better as far as international cinema goes. By my quick count, there’s 110 films in languages other than English (plus two silents of foreign origin).\n\nIn addition to the 9 Ingmars, there are 8 films by Satyajit Ray, and 5 each by Akira Kurosawa, Alfred Hitchcock, and Ming-liang Tsai.\n\nThree of the four people in that Boogie Nights screenshot have passed away in recent years. William H. Macy, watch your back!\n\nI’ve made my lovely wife sit through about 60 of these. Some she really loved, but boy, there were some she really really hated.\n\nAlright, that’s enough nerding out over my own damn list. Thanks for reading!\n\nThe Wolfpack – This is an interesting story, but it seems like it should have been more interesting. The buzz around the film was that “these boys learned everything they know from the movies!” so I expected the movie-watching to figure more into how the Angulos’ minds and personalities were shaped. But either that wasn’t a big factor or it wasn’t touched on. The movies were just their entertainment. And as a cinephile, I guess I was disappointed that their cinematic obsessions appeared to be mainly Tarantino and Batman. I guess overall it was engaging but it wasn’t what I’d imagined the story to be, which is why expectations are bad. Rating: Good (73)\n\nCall Me Lucky – I don’t think Barry Crimmins is an especially funny comedian (he’s okay) but he is a compelling individual. I’ve really got nothing else to say about this. A solid doc. Rating: Good (75)\n\nRiffraff (rewatch) – I don’t buy as many DVDs/Blu-Rays as I used to, but I still sometimes make hasty purchases for movies I don’t really need to have in my collection. Riffraff is right on the edge. It’s very entertaining, and I enjoyed my second viewing. But will there ever be a third? When am I going to wake up and say to myself, “Man, I really want to watch Riffraff today”? I can’t picture it, but for now I’ll hold on to it. Rating: Very Good (86)\n\nThe Wrong Man (rewatch) – On the fence about this one, too. I’ve always maintained this is underrated Hitchcock, and I still do. It’s not edge-of-your-seat thriller stuff, but there’s a lot of noir and new wave atmosphere to it. But having seen it three (maybe four?) times now, I’m not sure I would gain anything from an additional viewing. Another one I’m keeping “for now”. Rating: Very Good (85)\n\nMukhsin (rewatch) – No doubts about keeping this one, I just wish I had a decent copy of it. Sadly, it looks like Yasmin Ahmad’s “Orket trilogy” (as well as the director herself) is going to fade further into obscurity, without ever getting a proper release. The third film in the trilogy is the lightest and loveliest of them, even if one can’t help missing Sharifah Amani (though her sisters do an excellent job). I don’t like “championing” movies and telling people they “should” watch this or that. But it would please me if the trilogy (starting with Sepet) gained a wider audience, and maybe attracted the attention of a studio willing to do a worthy home release of the films. Rating: Very Good (88)\n\nAbout Elly – One of Farhadi’s best, almost up there with A Separation. I would try to avoid reading anything about the content of the film. In fact, I shouldn’t say any more myself. An excellent study of human behavior and relationships. Rating: Very Good (87)\n\nZoolander (rewatch) – I got Carrie to rewatch this with me, even though she’s not a fan. She is still not a fan. I’m slightly less of a fan. There aren’t as many big laughs as I thought there were. On the other hand, very very little about the movie bugs me, and almost everything is worth at least a smile. It’s a stupid movie, but it’s a stupidity that speaks to me. It’s a comfortable stupidity. Rating: Good (77)\n\nBedazzled – On the flipside, this movie (the Harold Ramis remake, not the original) is the stupidity that speaks to Carrie… and not to me. I tried to embrace the absurdity of it, get into the spirit of what they were trying to do. It didn’t happen. I had one good laugh, when Fraser is talking with all the sand in his mouth. The rest of it just didn’t do it for me. I can’t decide if Brendan Fraser is the worst choice or the best choice, but one thing I’m sure of is that they tried to nerd him up waaay too much in the beginning. It doesn’t work for Fraser, and it doesn’t work for where the character ends up. Rating: Poor (52)\n\nEdge of Doom (rewatch) – Ah, we’re back to Noirs I Probably Didn’t Need to Buy. EoD is great, it’s a dark as hell movie with real tension and real bitterness. If I was building a library of Film Noir You Should See, it would have a spot. But for my personal collection? Do I need to see it a third time? I don’t think so. Besides, it can get kind of annoying after a while to watch Farley Granger run around and getting mad about a “I want a big funeral!” Because even though this is his best work besides They Live By Night, Granger is a lousy actor. Rating: Very Good (86)\n\nThree years ago, I watched Jonas Mekas’s epic 5-hour “diary film”, As I Was Moving Ahead Occasionally I Saw Brief Glimpses of Beauty. I fell in love with it and placed it among my top 100 films. Mekas’s home movies were edited into a sustained ecstatic burst of joy and delight, a celebration of love, family, nostalgia. And yet it was with some hesitation that I made a blind purchase of this new Blu-Ray collection, featuring this, his first diary film. Would the gamble pay off?\n\nWell, yes and no. Walden is much in the same spirit, jittery handheld footage melded with an often unrelated soundtrack, highlighting moments that Mekas felt worth highlighting. And some of these moments are indeed beautiful and sweet and filled me with that same sense of joy. But too often Mekas is more concerned with events than moments. Early in the film, the first appearance of The Velvet Underground. Near the end, John and Yoko’s “bed-in”. Significant events in cultural history, but even though Mekas was there, the personal perspective is lacking. And he doesn’t bring anything to make them interesting, either. It’s just… yep, you were there to film it.\n\nAlthough some two hours shorter than As I Was Moving, it feels longer. When the movie gets into that wonderful, random rhythm it’s fascinating. But there are three sections where it gets rather bogged down. One is a visit with Stan Brakhage and his family. While there are a few items here and there that elicit a smile — Stan’s wife Jane riding a mule, for example — it spends too long just documenting rather than finding the special parts. It’s boring in the way we expect home movies to be boring. Another section spends far too long at the wedding of film historian (and with Mekas, co-founder of the Anthology Film Archives) P. Adams Sitney. Clearly Sitney was a close friend… so why does this feel so distant and impersonal? It’s mostly a bunch of people milling around in a tent. And lastly, there’s a section entitled “Wendy’s Wedding”. I don’t know who Wendy is, but for what must be 7 or 8 interminable minutes, we watch her dance in a nightclub, wearing her bridal gown and caught in stuttering fragments by the strobe light. Fun and interesting for maybe a minute or two. Mekas tries our patience.\n\nIf this sounds like a lot of kvetching, it’s because I had hoped for a more consistently enjoyable experience. Mekas is perhaps still finding his voice here (speaking of his voice, his spoken musings on the soundtrack are still wonderful). One of the most memorable aspects of As I Was Moving was his clear love for his wife and children. This was before they were part of his life, so some of the best scenes here are when he delights in the loves and children of others. I would say about 70% of the film is what I wanted… the rhapsodic observations, the latching on to images of beauty, the reminder to take a minute to enjoy life rather than just living it. He needs to apply more of his personal touch to that other 30%. Hopefully Lost, Lost, Lost will be more successful in that regard. Rating: Good (73)\n\nIMDb\n\nI’ve slowed down in my movie consumption, and slowed down even more with writing about them. So here’s a quick and dirty brain dump of the films I’ve seen in the past few months that didn’t get reviewed:\n\nEx Machina – Premise felt both clever and too familiar. It had some engaging Kubrickian style, but my interest waned a bit as it went on. Rating: Good (78)\n\nIt Follows – Disappointing throwback with a lot of nonsense. The kind of movie that makes you go “Why don’t they just…?” and that’s annoying. Mildly scary. Rating: Fair (62)\n\nThe Dark Matter of Love – A documentary of special interest to me and Carrie, because we’ve been tossing around the idea of adoption/fostering. Obviously it can be a rewarding experience, but there are right ways and wrong ways, and this shows some of the wrong. Interesting story, but I’d like to see a broader perspective. Rating: Good (77)\n\nThe ‘Burbs (rewatch) – Showed this to Carrie, I think it might have been on Halloween. It didn’t hold up quite as well as I’d hoped (Carrie rightfully accused the plot of getting tiresome), but there’s some pretty funny bits in it. Lots of quotables. Rick Ducommin is so great. Rating: Good (75)\n\nSpooky Buddies – Hoo boy. We briefly developed a masochistic taste for these Air Bud spinoffs featuring 6 golden retriever puppies getting into wacky adventures. Most of the cuteness factor is annihilated by the paper-thin characters, awful jokes, and overall cheapness. Somehow we made it all the way through this one, maybe because it was Halloween or maybe because of the novelty of seeing Harland Williams in it. I rated this a lot lower at first, but in retrospect it wasn’t that horrible. Still… not good. Rating: Poor (44)\n\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 – Well, certainly if you care, you’ve seen it already and know what kind of problems it has. The series has always been spotty, but this was definitely the weakest and least enjoyable. Rating: Fair (61)\n\nThe Martian – It has some moments and the production is very convincing, but the dialogue and story are both full of clichés (how many times did we hear some variation of “we ran the numbers”?). There’s no real tension as Damon instantly “sciences the shit” his way out of pretty much every obstacle. Rating: Poor (57)\n\nPitch Perfect 2 – In the music biz, they call this the Sophomore Slump. While it doesn’t exactly copy the first movie, there’s nothing that fresh here. I’m struggling to remember any of the funny bits… or any of the songs. Rating: Fair (65)\n\nStar Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens – Sure, you could nitpick the shit of it like a giant nerd, or you could take a chill pill and enjoy one of more entertaining big-budget-blowouts in recent memory. I just had a lot of fun at this movie, and I enjoy most of the new characters. Is it a retread? Sure, in a way, but I think the franchise needed a return to its roots. Looking forward to seeing where this goes next. Rating: Very Good (87)\n\nAnne of Green Gables – Carrie shared one of her childhood favorites with me. I never read the book and knew little about the story, but I found it pretty enjoyable. Great performances by Dewhurst and Fansworth. And a lovely, bucolic atmosphere. Some minor complaints, but I’ve forgotten most of them. Rating: Good (74)\n\nIndia’s Daughter – Yeah, this is super fucked-up and will make you cry and make you angry. While the film seems to be singling India out and wagging a finger, it reminds us at the end that other countries (including the US) have a long long way to go in how we handle rape. Rating: Very Good (86)\n\nSingin’ in the Rain (rewatch) – Carrie had never seen it, it was time. Pleased to say it went over very well. The “Broadway Medley” part bothers me less and less each time. It didn’t feel as long as I remembered it. I could still do without it, but that “crazy veil” portion is really something. I also wish there was a little more Debbie Reynolds in it, she’s not nearly as prominent as I thought she was. But at least we get a generous serving of Jean Hagen, who is frickin’ hilarious. Rating: Great (94)\n\nWorld of Tomorrow – Don Hertzfeldt’s latest popped up on Netflix, so I took the opportunity to check it out (even though I could have easily done so earlier). His best work? I’m still fond of Billy’s Balloon but it’s been a long time, I’d have to reevaluate it. It’s definitely witty, clever, original and moving. He’s approaching the sort of hopeful sadness that I love in Vonnegut… this feels like a very Vonnegut kind of movie. Rating: Very Good (87)\n\nIt’s Such a Beautiful Day – I also took the opportunity to finally see this other Hertzfeldt. This hit a lot of similar notes, but with a more personalized touch. The first part I didn’t think was that great, but it gets better as it goes on. Rating: Very Good (85)\n\nExporting Raymond – I don’t think I’ve ever watched more than 3 minutes of “I Love Raymond”, but I heard show creator Phil Rosenthal on a podcast and he was so delightful that I wanted to check out his documentary about trying to adapt the show for a Russian audience. Lots of interesting bits here, from the ex-military chauffeur who enjoys studying seashells, to the obstinate costume designer who insists that a busy housewife dress in haute couture. Would like to see a little more probing about the roots of the cultural differences, but an enjoyable watch. Rating: Very Good (80)\n\nApproaching the Elephant – Documentary in the “fly on the wall” Frederick Wiseman/Allan King style about some young starry-eyed folks trying to start up a Free School in New Jersey. A thought-provoking look at good intentions gone wrong… or right, depending on your opinion. There are a few moments of triumph, but for the most part, to me it looked like barely-contained chaos… and a lot of disfiguring accidents just waiting to happen. At times the adults become children when trying to treat the children like adults. Rating: Good (77)\n\nXiao Kang – This isn’t a movie, it’s a trailer for the Vienna Film Festival. But it’s by Ming-liang Tsai, so of course I was gonna watch it. It’s a minute or so of Kang-sheng Lee poking around in a forest. I love Lee and I love Tsai, but let’s be honest… whether I’m rating this as a short film or as a trailer, it doesn’t do much for me. Rating: Poor (48)"
