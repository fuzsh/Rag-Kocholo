        "text": "For other people named Christopher Lambert, see Christopher Lambert (disambiguation).\n\nChristophe Guy Denis Lambert (/ˈlæmbərt/; French: [lɑ̃bɛʁ]; born 29 March 1957),[1] known professionally as Christopher Lambert, is a French actor, novelist, and producer. He started his career playing supporting parts in several French films, and became internationally famous with the role of Tarzan in Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes in 1984. For his performance in the 1985 film Subway, Lambert received the César Award for Best Actor. His best-known role is Connor MacLeod in the 1986 cult adventure-fantasy film Highlander and the subsequent movie franchise series of the same name. He also played the thunder god Raiden in the first film adaptation of the video game Mortal Kombat (1995). Other films he is known for are I Love You (1986), The Sicilian (1987), Knight Moves (1992), Fortress (1992) and its sequel Fortress 2: Re-Entry (2000), Absolon (2003), White Material (2009), Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2011), Kickboxer: Retaliation (2016), and for producing N'oublie pas que tu vas mourir, (1995), the French comedy film Neuf Mois (1994) and its American remake Nine Months (1995).\n\nEarly life[]\n\nLambert was born March 29, 1957, in Great Neck, New York, the son of Yolande Agnès Henriette (née de Caritat de Peruzzis; * 1928)[2] and Georges Lambert-Lamond (1910–2003)[3], a French diplomat then at the United Nations.[1][4][5] His father was a French Jew.[6] Lambert was raised in Geneva from infancy and moved to Paris in his teens.[7]\n\nCareer[]\n\nLate 1970s to 1984: Early roles and breakthrough[]\n\nChristopher Lambert started his career playing supporting parts in several French films: Ciao, les mecs (1979), Le bar du téléphone (1980), Asphalte (1981), Une sale affaire (1981), Putain d'histoire d'amour (1981), Douchka (1981), Légitime violence (1982) and one episode of Cinéma 16 (1982).\n\nAround that time director Hugh Hudson had just finished his Academy Award-winning film Chariots of Fire (1981), and Warner Brothers was desperate to hire him to direct another film. After looking at all their available scripts he chose to do a film adaptation of novelist Edgar Rice Burroughs' iconic character Tarzan, a man who was raised by an unknown species of great apes in the jungle. Hudson wanted an unknown to play the part and tested many young actors. Lambert got the role partly due to his myopia, because when he took off his glasses it seemed he was always looking into the distance.[8]\n\nGreystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes was released in 1984 and met with great critical acclaim for both Lambert and its director. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards and won a BAFTA Award, as well as a César Award amongst other nominations.[9]\n\nThat same year, he also played a lead role in a French film called Paroles et musique, opposite Catherine Deneuve, Richard Anconina and Jacques Perrin.[10]\n\n1985 to 2000: International fame[]\n\nIn 1985, Lambert played the lead in Luc Besson's stylistic film Subway, about a man being hunted in the underground subways of Paris.[11][12] The film was a success at the French box office as well as critically acclaimed.[13] Lambert was awarded a César Award for Best Actor the next year.[14]\n\nOn the 7th of March 1986, premiered Russell Mulcahy's Highlander.[15] In the film, Lambert starred as Connor MacLeod from the Scottish Highlands, known as the Highlander, one of a number of immortal warriors who can be killed only by decapitation. After initial training by another highly skilled immortal swordsman, Ramirez played by Sean Connery, MacLeod lives on for several centuries, eventually settling in New York City, running an antiques shop. Macload falls in love with a police forensic scientist named Brenda. He also finds out that he must face his greatest enemy, the Kurgan, played by Clancy Brown, who wishes to kill MacLeod and to obtain \"the Prize\" – which gives special abilities to the last living immortal warrior, vast knowledge and power which could enslave the human race. The film became a cult hit and was an international box-office success, as well as his most famous role. The rock group Queen composed and performed the soundtrack, and Lambert also appeared as MacLeod in the music video for Queen's \"Princes of the Universe\".[16] Also that year, Lambert took the leading role in Marco Ferreri's I Love You.[17] The film was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and was nominated for the Silver Ribbon at the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists.[18]\n\nLambert played the leading role in the troubled production of The Sicilian, directed by Michael Cimino, based on the Mario Puzo book by the same name and started its American theatrical run on the 23rd of October 1987.[19] He stars as Salvatore Giuliano an egocentric bandit who fights the Church, the Mafia, and the landed gentry while leading a populist movement for Sicilian independence. The studios trimmed down the director's cut of the film. It was released in 1987, and was less successful than his previous pictures, receiving a lukewarm reception by critics and being only marginally profitable. However the director's cut received better reviews upon its release in France.\n\nIn 1988, he starred in Agnieszka Holland's To Kill a Priest, in which he played a character based on Jerzy Popiełuszko and his murder under the Polish communist regime.

In it Lambert reunited with director Russell Mulcahy and fellow actor Sean Connery.[21] Mulcahy didn't like the screenplay right from the start, and the production team was lured to shoot it in Argentina to reduce production costs; the country however was going through a financial crisis. Much of the script wasn't filmed and the final result is a patchwork.[22] Its poor performance was possibly a result of the bonding company's interference with the director; Mulcahy reportedly hated the final product so much he walked out of the film's world premiere after viewing its first 15 minutes. For similar reasons, Christopher Lambert threatened to walk out of the project when it was nearing fruition. However, due to contract obligations, he did not.\n\nThat year he got his first producer credit in the French film Génial, mes parents divorcent by Patrick Braoudé.[23]\n\nIn 1992, he appeared in three projects.

S. Anderson's movie adaptation of the popular video game series Mortal Kombat.[30] The plot of the film follows the warrior monk Liu Kang, the actor Johnny Cage, and the soldier Sonya Blade, all three guided by the god Raiden, on their journey to combat the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung and his forces in a tournament to save Earth. Mortal Kombat spent three weeks as the number-one film at the U.S. box office, earning over $122 million worldwide.
