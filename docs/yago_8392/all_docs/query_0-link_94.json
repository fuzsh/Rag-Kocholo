        "text": "CHRISTMAS COMES BUT ONCE A YEAR, AND WHEN IT DOES THE TV SCHEDULES ARE THE SAME AS THEY WERE 12 MONTHS AGO.\n\nCandles burning low, Lots of Mistletoe, Lots of vintage shows, Cheesy Films, and more. It’s a time when adverts on TV go into overdrive, and subsequently the so-called top toys suddenly become hard to find, but they were there just a minute ago, they were honestly, I saw them!!!!!. (which is I think a bit of a conspiracy to make us spend, spend, spend, set up by the toy companies themselves who as we all are aware are in cahoots with the sweet companies who do the same at Halloween), it’s also when Turkeys decide maybe it’s a good time to take that long overdue vacation to… Turkey, where else?\n\nAnd then it starts, we get overzealous and very talkative DJs playing all those old songs on the radio. Plus, various TV channels dedicating whole days, weeks, and even months to the likes of Shaking Stevens, Elvis Presley, Mariah Carey, Kirsty McColl and the Pogue’s, Johnny Mathis, Greg Lake, Andy Williams, Bing Crosby (with or without David Bowie,) Slade, Queen and Wizard, all of whom have their hits from three decades or more ago dusted off and aired again and again.\n\nWe must also mention Sir Cliff Richard, who just keeps going and produces some great Christmas numbers that do convey the true meaning of the season, even if the BBC do refuse to play them, which I think is wrong, but we won’t get into that here and now, or Cliff might just get a bit Wired for Sound and turn into a Devil Woman.\n\nThe same old songs are heard on loop from the 1st of November through till the 26th of December, with Elton John stepping into Christmas, Paul McCartney and Wings hoping to spread A Wonderful Christmas time, the Wombles inviting everyone to have a Wombling Merry one, the band Mud telling us how lonely they will be without a certain person, Chris Rea still driving home to make the big day, Elvis purveying his thoughts on having a Blue Christmas, John and Yoko asking for War to Be Over, and Jonah Louie pleading with us to Stop the Cavalry. Plus, we are invited to feed the world over and over by a lineup of artists that are now no longer so popular, in the form of Band Aid 1 and 2. (Give us yer money). Yes, everyone, in the words of Noddy Holder “Itssssss Christmas”, (Bah Humbug, sour Clementines and has anyone seen the nutcrackers).\n\nI have always wondered why there is always a shortage of new songs at Christmas, after all they have all year to get ready for the festive season, and they do it for Eurovision year on year, (but maybe don’t use that as an example), it’s not like it’s a surprise that Christmas is coming, it happens every 25th of December after all. But maybe it’s because your granny tells you that the old songs are the best, (see what I did there) and we are in fact stuck in the proverbial rut, when it comes to festive songs, and it seems that is the same for movies too.\n\nWhen the season of joy starts to be mentioned it is inevitable that many people start to have thoughts of movies that are shown every year. (is this anticipation or dread?). But why are these same films always shown? Well, its’ because they are familiar, and to many are the embodiment of what Christmas is. The films I am thinking of, and you are too most probably, are movies that we have grown up with, and associate with the yuletide season because we first saw them at Christmas, and because they are associated with a nice time of the year from maybe our childhood, we return to them again and again, but also sit and watch them with our children and grandchildren, so they in turn associate them with nice times and festive frolics.\n\nFor each generation there is a Christmas classic from the silver screen, The Wizard of OZ, The Sound of Music, and Mary Poppins are regulars on the TV screens in the UK, and even though these are not strictly Christmas movies, they are always linked with that time of year more than any other season.\n\nAnd there are evergreen classics such as The Snowman with that amazing soundtrack by Howard Blake. And Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, and so many others.\n\nOf course, there are movies that are set during the so-called period of goodwill to all, that do not radiate any tidings of great joy, Gremlins, Silent Night Deadly Night, and more recently the rather odd, Fatman, and the very irreverent and no holds barred foul language fest that is Violent Night.\n\nThen there are examples such as Bad Santa, which is most definitely not for the youngsters.\n\nIt’s also something of a weird and funny thing that we love to be scared especially at this time of year, and ghost tales are told by parents to their kiddywinks in the hope that they will settle down and await the arrival of Santa. Hang on a minute! Let’s rewind. So, you tell your child a scary tale and then send them to bed with them knowing that at some point during the night, a large man dressed in red and white with a big beard will break into their house, steal their milk, cookies, mince pies, and anything else that is left lying around that is edible, and let a reindeer into the kitchen so that it can chomp on the carrots for Christmas dinner,(which I think you will find is against all the health and safety rules, so there goes your clean food certificate).\n\nThis intruder also leaves dirty footprints all over the place, and steals the Elf on the shelf. And you really expect them to sleep? But its ok, the burglar or should I say festive thief makes up for his intrusion by leaving an array of gifts, which in theory could be seen as a bribe, but no one wants the police involved, do they?\n\nI think one of my earliest memories of a festive film, was the 1951 version of A Christmas Carol, entitled Scrooge, and starred Alistair Sim in the title role. This is the traditional Dickens tale of ghosts, melancholy and warmth that was brought to the screen by director, Brian Desmond Hurst, and featured the talents of Mervyn Johns, Hugh Williams, Michael Horden, Kathleen Harrison, and Jack Warner.\n\nThe score for the film was the work of Richard Addinsell, who wove into his original music compositions, elements from traditional carols and an arrangement of nursery rhymes such as, Oranges and Lemons, here we go round the Mulberry Bush, and others. The composer also incorporated the familiar sound of a church choir singing Silent Night and other Christmas carols. The soundtrack was a wonderful accompaniment to the narrative and underlined the drama purveying true emotion.\n\nAt times a darker sound being achieved for scenes that included the Ghost of Marley and the ghost of Christmas yet to come. A fifteen-minute suite from the soundtrack was recorded by the BBC Philharmonic under the baton of Rumon Gumba in 2003, for a Chandos records compilation, entitled The Film Music of Richard Addinsell.\n\nThe suite encompassed all the principal thematic material from the score. The compilation also included music from other movies that Addinsell had worked on, these included, Goodbye Mr Chips, Love on the Dole, Blithe Spirit, The Black Rose, Out of the Clouds, Tom Browns Schooldays, The Admirable Crichton, and Dangerous Moonlight which featured Addinsell’s timeless and powerful composition entitled The Warsaw Concerto. The retelling of the famous Dickens tale is a triumph, as is the score.\n\nThe tale of A Christmas Carol is one that has been committed to celluloid many times, and even has taken animated form in films such as Mr. Magoo’s Christmas Carol in 1962.\n\nIt’s a story that lends itself well to cinematic re-imaginings, and I would think that everyone is familiar with the tale in some form or another, whether it be a serious incarnation, or a musical adaptation as in the 1970 version of the story entitled Scrooge with Albert Finney in the title role, supported by Alec Guinness, Edith Evens, Michael Naismith, David Collings, and Kenneth Moore.\n\nDirected by Ronald Neame, the film featured songs and music penned by Leslie Bricusse.\n\nThen there is the version of the tale which stars George C Scott, that is so underrated, with many favouring this than all others. especially the score by Nick Bicat and The Muppet Christmas Carol, where Kermit and the gang take on the roles of the well-known characters with Michael Caine playing Scrooge.\n\nAll these versions and so many more are crammed into the TV schedules for Christmas, there are so many in fact, it’s a wonder that we have the time to watch them all, thank goodness for catch up TV, which will allow us to watch up until Easter and beyond.\n\nA film that I always enjoy is the Holly and the Ivy, a heartwarming and intimate tale, that was released in 1952, it’s a warm but at the same time sobering story about an English minister and his family reunited at Christmas time. Their tale includes a remembrance of their World War II trials. Which goes to make this a poignant and emotion filled story.\n\nDirected by George Moore O Ferrall, the movie starred Ralph Richardson, Celia Johnson, John Gregson, Denholm Elliot, and Margaret Leighton, and had a score by esteemed British composer Malcolm Arnold. Arnold incorporated numerous Christmas songs and carols into the soundtrack and added to these dramatic and romantic tones. The score boasts a rousing and suitably emotive medley of Christmas songs which is still to this day featured in concert.\n\nThe Fantasy or suite features The Holly and The Ivy, Joy to the World, The First Noel, Away in a Manger, I saw three Ships, etc. I saw it performed at the Brighton Dome a few years ago as an encore and it was a fitting conclusion to a concert of British film music. And yes, it was Christmas.\n\nAnother movie that is a regular on our TV screens on and around the festive season is It’s a Wonderful Life, which was directed by Frank Capra and starred James Stewart. It’s a tale of sorrow and one of hope, that has stood well the test of time. Released in 1947, this is a classic in every sense. The film also starred Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Henry Travers, and Thomas Mitchell. George Bailey (Stewart) has lived his life helping so many people in the small town of Bedford Falls, and although George has often thought of travelling and seeing other places, he never seems to have found the time to do so. He runs a building company and loan business, which his Father established, and he has carried on in his dad’s footsteps helping others.\n\nBut the greed filled Mr Potter (Barrymore) wants the town for himself and is intent on buying it up to control it and its people. The only thing stopping him is George, but after a sum of money goes missing when it is lost, George finds himself in an awkward position, and realises that if he cannot find the money he could go to jail. Which would leave the way open for Potter to carry out his plan. George decides that he cannot face being accused and also that he has let his friends and family down, so thinks that the best way is to commit suicide, thinking if he were not there or even had not been born, that things would have been better for all concerned. His family however disagree, and they pray for him, their prayers are heard in heaven, who dispatch an angel named Clarence to help George, Clarence is told if he succeeds then he will earn his wings. So, Clarence goes about trying to convince George that if he were not around how bad things would have been or at least how different things would have turned out.\n\nThis is a heartwarming piece of cinema and its story I think is not unlike A Christmas Carol. The score is by Dimitri Tiomkin and is a soundtrack that has been available on LP CD and now on digital platforms. All you need on a Christmas weekend is a nice glowing fire, some delicious nibbles, and The Sound of Music, It’s a Wonderful Life and then Mary Poppins in that order.\n\nChristmas TV does have a habit of repeating itself each year, the TV companies thinking to themselves “Well it worked last year and the year before, in fact it worked back in 1968, so why not now”? And why not indeed, does anyone even notice? I can only talk for the UK here, but at Christmas time we invariably get a lot of historical movies and war films being screened, now these are really nothing to do with Christmas, but again I think it’s a case of the film was popular at that time of year, so they continue to show it every time the festive season starts. Dads movies include, The Great Escape for example, which I can guarantee will be on at some time over the festive holiday, along with Zulu, Where Eagles Dare, The Dirty Dozen and maybe even Kelly’s Heroes.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, these are all great movies, and every one of them has a brilliant score, but every year, really! (and Dad is normally asleep when they are on, but he is sitting on the remote, so everyone has to watch them). But what is the alternative?\n\nThink about it, Yes, the dreaded brain numbing waste of air time reality shows,(cue the Psycho strings) or the mundane and send you to sleep quiz shows, (more sinister strings Maestro please) and the talent, or untalented shows, which again raises the question, does Britain really have talent or is it all about the judges here? I am sure if you looked back you would see a schedule from a few years ago that was almost identical to the one that is being shown this year.\n\nLike I say all great movies yes, but why not shake it up a bit and instead of showing The Wizard of Oz, live dangerously and show Return to Oz, just a thought. The Christmas TV schedule is full of non-festive films that are mostly associated with December the 25th or around about that time because they have been shown on the box at this time, but there are many films that are shown over and over at Christmas that themselves are set during the season of good will. Some are syrupy, filled with melancholy and warmth but others have a darker side.\n\nGremlins, for example wasreleased in 1984, Joe Dante directed this horror/comedy which has a lot going for it and has remained popular over the years. It did spawn a sequel, yes, Gremlins 2, but this is best left unmentioned, as they should have left the story where it concluded in 1984. Gremlins is a quirky, madcap fast paced tale about little monsters that literally rip their way through the small town of Kingston Falls. Malice and mayhem ensue, as our hero Billy, who is a quiet and mild-mannered bank teller unwittingly releases a whole gang of malevolent loonies after gaining a new pet and violating two of three simple rules that came with it: No water or food after midnight and no bright light. (see I told you read the instructions).\n\nAfter he does this the original pet spawns more of the same, but the new ones are different, they are not cute or cuddly, but violent and murderous. They set out to destroy the town and eliminate anyone or anything that gets in their way (that poor dog). So, when your washing machine blows up or your TV goes on the fritz, before you call the repair man, turn on all the lights and look under all the beds. Because you never can tell, there just might be a gremlin in your house.\n\nThe infectious score was by Jerry Goldsmith, who’s Gremlin rag is just as, and if not more mental and quirkier than the film. At the time of the film’s release, a soundtrack album was issued on vinyl, which had just a selection of the score represented on side A, the other cues being songs from the movie, but thankfully Goldsmith’s masterful soundtrack did get a full release later, and there is a thirty-four-track album available now on digital platforms.\n\nOne cannot help but think of the movie when hearing Goldsmith’s music, it is a score which works on so many levels, and not only supports the darker moments but wonderfully punctuates the comedic moods in the story. It also has a subtle and lullaby like central theme to accompany Gizmo (he is the nice one).\n\nAnother movie set at Christmas is Home Alone, the original in the series being the best in my humble opinion, and although it might be a nice idea to leave a troublesome child at home for Christmas whilst you swan off on holiday, who would actually do that? As once could be seen as a mistake, but after that, surely social services should be informed. I am sure Kevin would appreciate some honesty here from his parents, a simple “Look kid we don’t like you” would suffice, yes? The first movie was brilliant and it’s a film that I would gladly sit and watch right now, I felt sorry for those poor wet bandits who did not know what hit them. Joe Pesci is superb as is his buffoon like partner Marv played by Daniel Stern. Macauly Culkin is the star of the movie though and is a cherub like but at the same time sinister Dennis the menace character. Culkin did the first two movies as Kevin, but Home Alone 3, was certainly a lack lustre affair, and being minus Culkin also meant that it was less popular, going straight to video in the UK. Every movie after this in the series got progressively worse, the concept becoming rather stale and unappealing. The music for the first two tales in the series was by John Williams, and his score for the original movie is in a word joyous.\n\nHis artistry on the film shows us why he is still one of the most sought-after composers of film music today. The music being precise and supportive throughout, the composers timing for the comedic and hap hazard thieves being a highlight. Williams created new Christmas slanted themes such as Somewhere in my Memory for the movie and combined these with already established festive melodies.\n\nThe Carol of the Bells acting as a foundation of the work, with the composer building everything around this and his original central theme, fashioning a dramatic, sometimes dark, and suspenseful soundtrack, that also contains numerous moments of poignancy, melancholy and levels of emotion that are affecting as well as being effective. The original score is embellished with popular Christmas songs, which are also colourful and supportive, and add much to the impact of the storylines many moods and scenarios. It is without a doubt one of the composers most entertaining works.\n\nI suppose a Christmas movie or a film that is shown at that time of year does not really have to be about Christmas or indeed contain nice warm thoughts and actions. As in Die Hard, and Lethal Weapon etc. It is more about the individual who is watching the movie, and if they associate it with the festive season. But so as not to confuse things I will for the next couple of examples at least stick with more traditional fare.\n\nAn example that I think is very overrated is Santa Claus the Movie, I have always thought that the film was a wasted opportunity, with lack lustre performances and FX that when you see them now are quite badly executed. The best thing about the movie is probably the score by Henry Mancini, and this is even somewhat disappointing in areas. When originally released the soundtrack was issued on an LP record, then a CD became available and then much later the score was re-issued onto CD again but with far superior sound quality (or so they told us). But even then, some collectors were not happy with it. The movie was I thought a pointless exercise,\n\nDudley Moore was not good as Patch the wayward Elf, and John Lithgow seemed to be somewhat uncomfortable in his role, however David Huddleson was a wonderful Santa, it’s a modern-day tale of how Santa fails to keep up with modern tech as in the production of toys etc and keeping up with the ever-growing demand from children all over the world. With one of the big man’s elves Patch basically going over to the dark side after being manipulated by an unscrupulous company executive.\n\nIt was directed by Jeannot Szwarc and was to be the last major fantasy film produced by the Paris-based father-and-son production team of Alexander and Ilya Salkind, who were responsible for making us believe a man could fly in the Superman movies.\n\nMancini’s score was cliched and far too sentimental, and yes I know the film too was filled with sentimentality and sugary lines and scenarios, but it was a score that I thought fell short and although there were a few “Nice” moments, it was under par and whimsical.\n\nIts also a score and movie that certainly does not improve with age, as the music has not stood the test of time well and the storyline is predictable, and the effects stand out like the proverbial sore thumb. But remember this is just my opinion.\n\nA movie that also had an elf as its main focus was Elf, (well there’s a surprise). This is I have to say on my nice list of movies that should be watched every Christmas, very much like Hocus Pocus must be seen at Halloween. It is a far-fetched and somewhat predictable film, but also is a fun filled romp that like Home Alone has some classic screen moments and slaying one liners and situations.\n\nThe central character Buddy the Elf is played convincingly by Will Ferrell, who accidently is taken to the north pole one Christmas by Santa after baby Buddy hides in Santa’s sack whilst he is delivering presents. Buddy is raised as an Elf at the North pole, (even if he is a very tall one). Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) tries to guide him but things become increasingly difficult as Buddy reaches adulthood. It is then that Buddy decides he will go to New York and find his real Father Walter Hobbs (James Caan), who is a successful businessman, and it soon materialises that he is in desperate need of some Christmas spirit.\n\nThings don’t go exactly to plan and Buddy ends up upsetting his new family, but on Christmas eve Santa finds himself being pursued in central park by the mounted park rangers after his sleigh breaks down, and its then, Buddy to the rescue, as the Elf enlists the help of everyone to generate some much needed Christmas spirit so that Santa and his reindeer can escape and carry on delivering presents around the world. The film is an hilarious and emotional tale, with an effective and catchy score by composer John Debney.\n\nThe music was released at the time of the film being in cinema’s and is available on digital platforms, with an expanded edition of the score being released a little while ago onto compact disc.\n\nLet’s go back to the connection between ghost stories and Christmas shall we. like I have already said not all ghost tales are Christmas based or even related, but it is something of a tradition that ghost tales and Yuletide go hand in hand. So, there are normally a fair few movies that deal with the paranormal around on the small screen at the festive time of the year. The Others, The Haunting, The Legend of Hell House, The Innocents, The Amazing Mr Blunden, and Ghost.\n\nAll of which are regulars mostly for late night viewing, except for maybe The Amazing Mr Blunden. Which although a Ghost story has to it a kind of Railway Children ring. The score for Mr Blunden was by Elmer Bernstein, who composed a quintessentially British sounding work for the movie. It was a soundtrack that went unreleased for many years and was finally issued onto CD in 2019, thirty-seven years after the film was originally in cinemas in 1972. The movie was based upon the 1969 novel written by Antonia Barber entitled The Ghosts and directed by Lionel Jefferies. A mysterious old solicitor visits a Mrs. Allen and her young children in her squalid, tiny Camden Town flat, and makes her an offer that she cannot really say no too. Her and her family of three children become the housekeepers to a derelict country mansion in the charge of the solicitors. After a while the two eldest children meet the spirits of two other children who died in the mansion when it was gutted by fire a century before.\n\nThe children prepare a magic potion that allows them to travel backwards in time to the era of the ghost children in a bid to help them. The movie featured Laurence Naismith, Graham Crowden and Dorothy Allison, with Lynne Frederick and Gary Miller as the mortal children, who attempt to put things right. It also contained performances from Diana Dors, and Madeline Smith.\n\nAn effective ghostly tale that will delight many younger film buffs. Staying with Ghost tales and Elmer Bernstein, we could not discuss paranormal events on the small screen at Christmas without mentioning the 1984 movie Ghostbusters, it’s a firm favourite with many of all ages, and is one that screens regularly. It is a movie that does show signs of time not being kind to it, but nevertheless is still entertaining in a zany kind of way, and recently we have seen more additions to the Ghostbusters franchise via streaming channels such as Netflix.\n\nIt’s a film that is certainly not just for Christmas but can be returned to at any time of the year. I suppose because it was so quirky and different, is why it remains so popular.\n\nThe other ghost films I mentioned as in, The Others etc, are all in my opinion terrifying tales, The Haunting from 1963, especially being one that is superbly unsettling and harrowing. It’s a film to sit down and immerse oneself in, maybe even on Christmas night, but please do not watch it alone. At Christmas,\n\nTV channels tend to show an entire series of movies or at least the movies that are available to them from the series, such as Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, etc,(even though they had already been shown on one of the other channels around a week before), and I remember last year one of the channels screened the entire Rocky series, over two nights just after Christmas, I did think at the time they missed a trick as they should have shown at least the first three on Boxing Day!!!!!But maybe that’s just too cliched even for British TV.\n\nWe can take comfort in the fact that whatever TV channels have lined up for us, it will invariably be familiar, as in repeats of various shows such as Morecombe and Wise, which is no bad thing (I hope they show the one with the Singing in the Rain sequence or the Andre Previn or even The Stripper).\n\nAnd whilst talking about musicals, (yes, I mentioned Singing in the Rain-which leads us nicely into this). Musicals do feature large at Christmas time. Whether they be old or more recent, the musical seems to appeal to all, the films shown could be or are invariably things such as The Sound of Music, or even West Side Story (the original).\n\nChristmas seems to be a time that TV companies think is the time to burst into song. I don’t mind a musical, especially if its Sondheim, his Into the Woods is brilliant. But channels such as the BBC seem to favour the more traditional type of movie musical as in Fiddler on the Roof, South Pacific, Oliver, Paint your Wagon, Camelot, The King and I, etc, etc etc, and let’s not forget The Wizard of Oz which was also a musical.\n\nSo, if you love Lerner and Lowe, or favour Rogers and Hammerstein, or maybe prefer something more contemporary like La La Land and The Greatest Showman, there will be I am sure something on the box for you this year. Then there are the old faithful’s as in Disney’s animated tales, not necessarily Christmas based but always welcomed at this time of year. With some of these being musicals as well as magical animated stories. Then there are the Gothic horrors from the likes of Hammer, Amicus, and American International etc, and we always have the old TV shows as in the Christmas specials, from the likes of Eric and Ernie, and repeats of Open all Hours, Only Fools and Horses, and there is the Doctor Who Christmas special, where he or she will probably save the world again.\n\nPlus, on Christmas day a guilty pleasure in the form of Call the Midwife.\n\nSo, I suppose the TV companies have got it right, because at Christmas all we really want is to relax and feel comfortable, Yes? So, sit back, turn the lights down, get the nuts and nibbles ready, and look out for those ads for Easter Eggs. It’s like jumping in your own private time machine and going back a few years for a bygone Christmas of Entertainment sometimes, but its familiar and there are very few surprises, which can at times be something of a comfort. With songs that we probably know all the words to, and films where we could easily play every character and know what music comes in where. Happy Easter everyone."
