A Man Called Sledge (1970)

James Garner (TV's "Maverick" and "The Rockford Files"), in a decidedly different change-of-pace role, is a ruthless outlaw who leads his gang of thieves in search of a fortune in gold.

Sledge (Garner) learns of a gold cache stored in a prison fortress and gathers his gang to pursue the loot. His partners in crime include Dennis Weaver (TV's "Gunsmoke" and "McCloud"). Claude Akins and John Marley. Against a backdrop of double crosses, dirty dealings and revenge, their gold lust end in a hail of bullets, two-fisted action and cold-blooded murder.

An offbeat spaghetti western in the tradition of Sam Peckinpah, A Man Called Sledge was directed and co-written by famed screen actor Vic Morrow (The Blackboard Jungle, Twilight Zone: The Movie)
