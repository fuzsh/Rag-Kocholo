        "text": "\"How much gold?\"\"Enough for a man to die on: More than that, maybe.\" Thus the subject and the theme are indicated very early on in Vic Morrow's \"A Man Called Sledge,\" which isn't quite an Italian western (Morrow and most of his leading cast are, of course, Americans) though it was produced in Italy, and though it has in common with many Italian westerns that it cares mostly about its theme and not so much about the people or the places or the sociology or the mythic potential of the old American West.All of which leads to a certain abstractness in movies like \"A Man Called Sledge,\" and though, one may add, a certain purity as well, the end result is really a certain dullness—for no universal theme can, taken by itself, make up for the people and the places and even the mythic potential that might find their way into any less single-minded fiction.The gold in question is part of a regular shipment sent from the mine in an armed convoy so cautious that it travels only by day, and by night holes up in such unfortunate hiding places as the maximum security cell block of a prison where Sledge (James Garner), guided by The Old Man (John Marley), takes his band of outlaws to steal it. They do, and then set about learning the bitter lesson — more convincing in literature than in life — that gold cannot buy happiness and the wages of sin is death.That really is the point to \"A Man Called Sledge,\" and it is not such an interesting point that a very good movie can come from it despite Mr. Morrow's fancy directing and destiny-driven dialogue. I should say that at almost any given moment \"A Man Called Sledge\" is a bit better than most Italian westerns and quite a bit better than many recent American westerns — and that it is still not good enough to satisfy the demands of its type.In a movie so given to decorative technique and to purple patches at one level or another, it may seem unfair to pick and choose. But I was especially taken with two sequences. One involves the mounted troops guarding the gold—who at the sound of a horn take up a variety of fancy formations that do more to recall the Spanish Riding School than the Old Frontier, but that are nevertheless fun to watch. The other is the final shoot-out—in a deserted, sun-baked Mexican town full of menacing alleys and meaningful junctures. This is not so much a film location as symbolic space, and one need only squint through politically colored glasses to see it in the form of the radical didactic cinema of Glauber Rocha.\n\nThe CastA MAN CALLED SLEDGE, directed by Vic Morrow; screenplay by Mr. Morrow and Frank Kowalski; director of photography, Luigi Kuveiller; music by Gianni Ferrio, produced by Dino De Laurentiis; released by Columbia Pictures. At neighborhood theaters. Running time: 90 minutes.
