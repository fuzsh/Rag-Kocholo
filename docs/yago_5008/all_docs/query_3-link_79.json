        "text": "Set in the Old West, the film follows a man named Sledge. Sledge is an outlaw and a skilled gunfighter who spends many days roaming the land, searching for gold and treasure. Although he is also in love with a woman, he has always made the hunt for vast riches a higher priority instead of settling down.\n\nSoon, Sledge meets an older man who tells him about a massive amount of gold hidden in prison. The older man knows this information because he was recently locked up in this prison for crimes he had committed. Sledge becomes curious and decides to team up with the older man, along with recruiting other men in an attempt to steal the gold. Sledge realises the only way to steal the gold is to be put in there as a prisoner himself, break free and take the gold with hopes that no one will notice the suspicious activity.\n\nThanks to Umbrella Entertainment, this film has recently been re-released on DVD. While the age of the film is evident, the transfer of the film itself still holds up quite nicely on DVD, even more so with the added 2.0 Dolby Audio. The film’s audio track, including the soundtrack and effects like gunfire, was also noticeable and positive.\n\nActor James Garner is exceptionally pleasing in the role of Sledge. I felt the actor was pleasant as a character who wants gold and nothing else in life. He was also convincing as an outlaw and a skilled man with a gun that people shouldn’t mess with.\n\nAs a plot, it’s quite simple but never really unpredictable. An outlaw who is determined to get gold for himself sounds very basic. Still, to my surprise, the third act of this film was extremely entertaining as it introduces an unexpected villain, which leads Sledge to a final and entertaining shootout, taking on many men. The film’s ending was also rather satisfying to me.\n\nOverall, I quite enjoyed watching A Man Called Sledge, even more so since it’s been released on DVD with a Dolby Audio 2.0 Track. It’s a fun Western film about a man who desires to find gold for himself. The plot is simple, but it still surprised me in many ways. This includes an unpredictable villain and a pleasing third act involving a shootout. Are you seeking a classic Western film? Well, I suggest you hunt A Man Called Sledge down on DVD today.\n\n6.1/10\n\nThank you for visiting!\n\nWalkden Entertainment is also available on multiple platforms!\n\nFor more information, click here: https://linktr.ee/walkdenentertainment"
