Thanks!)\n\nProbably the Disney film with the most unique or “exotic”-sounding title, Treasure of Matecumbe is one of those more forgotten Disney films. And as been common with recent films I’ve reviewed here, it’s directed by Vincent McEveety. It should be known that the film is on Disney+, but with the disclaimer, “This program is presented as originally created. It may contain outdated cultural depictions.”.\n\nSo, is this a treasure worth unearthing or better left buried? Read on to find out!\n\nAnd remember, SPOILERS AHEAD!"
