        "text": "Forty years ago, in the early hours of July 23, 1982, a horrible, preventable tragedy occurred on the outdoor set of TWILIGHT ZONE: THE MOVIE, a Warner Bros. production being filmed at Indian Dunes, California. Actor Vic Morrow was playing a soldier who has to cross a river carrying two Vietnamese orphans in his arms while a helicopter is shooting at him and explosions are going off around him. Instead of using a stunt double and two dummies, the director insisted that Morrow film the scene with the two children actually in his arms in a shot that would include the helicopter and the explosions. At 2:20AM, “Action!” was called, the explosions went off and shook the copter so badly that it crashed into the river killing Morrow and the children, a six-year-old girl, Renee Chen, born in Taiwan, and a seven-year-old boy, Myca Dinh Le, the son of parents born in Vietnam. Neither child was an actor. I want you to remember those names. Whenever this tragedy is recalled, usually only Vic Morrow is mentioned, sometimes accompanied by the phrase, “and two children.” The children had names and they had parents who have names also. Two of them were on the set that night and watched the horror unfold in front of their eyes. Those parents were Dr. Daniel Le, father of Myca, and Shyan-Huei Chen, mother of Renee. The other parents, Kim-Hoa Le, mother of Myca, and Mark Chen, father of Renee, had attended the filming the night before and had to work a full day afterwards, so they opted not to join them the second night when the tragedy occurred.\n\nThe children had been recruited for this scene and their parents paid in cash because it was illegal under California law to have children working at night without a special permit. No such permit had been sought. The parents of the children insisted that they’d never been told there would be explosions and a helicopter in the scene with them and the dangers inherent in such a situation. Associate producer George Folsey had done the recruiting, asking for help from a Dr. Harold Schuman, who had called his friend Peter Chen, who recommended his niece, Renee, and put Schuman in touch with his brother Mark Chen. Chen then contacted a friend, Dr. Daniel Le, who thought his son, Myca, might be interested. Folsey had been considering other children, but he thought these two might be most suitable for the scene and he brought the children to director John Landis on location a week before the filming of this scene and he’d approved them on the spot. Both children were reportedly eager to participate, clearly excited at being in a movie.\n\n(My short overview relies solely on information from the book, Outrageous Conduct: Art, Ego and the Twilight Zone Case, by Stephen Farber and Marc Green,1988/Ballantine Books, a detailed account of the accident, its aftermath and the manslaughter trial of those accused.)\n\nHow many people involved in the production knew it was illegal to have these children on the set at night? An attempt was made to keep it a secret from anyone at Warner Bros., the studio producing the film, who might have shut down the scene had they learned it. Executive Producer Frank Marshall (working closely with another Executive Producer, Steven Spielberg) certainly knew about the children and signed a check for $2000 to pay the parents $500 per child in cash per each night of filming. Production manager Dan Allingham knew. First Assistant Director Elie Cohn knew. Second Assistant Director Anderson House knew. In fact, House was alarmed to find a fire safety officer on set, Jack Tice, who also sometimes worked as a certified teacher-welfare worker responsible for the safety of children working on the set. If Tice had seen the children that night, he would have shut down the shoot immediately. Elaborate precautions were taken, including asking the parents of the children to insist that they and their children were only friends of Folsey visiting the set.\n\nHow many people knew how dangerous the explosives and their placement were? The helicopter pilot Dorcey Wingo did and was angered when an earlier shot featuring explosives endangered his copter. Various other camera and special effects crew members knew. There were concerns about mortars shooting off explosions and their placement under huts in the village set and how close to the copter the debris would fly. Warnings by these professionals to director Landis were brushed off. No one had the guts to stand up to him and insist on greater precautions. A key factor in the case is the decision by James Camomile, the special effects technician in charge of setting off the explosions, to fire them all on signal when, from his vantage point, he couldn’t see how low the helicopter was over the river and therefore how close to the explosions it would be.\n\nUltimately, it was director John Landis who ignored the warnings, and failed to plan things out in advance and coordinate the cameras, explosions and copter movements sufficiently. Instead of shooting closeups of the actors in the water and then substituting a stuntman and two dummies for the long shot, as would have been normal, Landis insisted on getting the actors, the copter and the explosions all in one shot and that’s what happened, a recipe for disaster that ended in three horrible, senseless deaths. Throughout the trials, Landis insisted on blaming the “experts” for not communicating with each other and doing their jobs right, deflecting any argument that he was the one on set that night who called all the shots.\n\nExecutive Producer Frank Marshall was on set that night, witnessed the accident, and fled the scene immediately afterwards. He evaded attempts to serve him a subpoena, never testified and was never deposed. Steven Spielberg was not on set that night and tried to distance himself from Landis’ segment. He even tried to walk away from the production, but Warner Bros. insisted he live up to his contract and direct the segment of the movie he’d been signed for. He was never deposed and never testified. At this point in his career, riding high on the success that summer of E.T., Spielberg certainly had enough clout to break his contract and walk away.\n\nAs I re-read this account, I wondered how anyone on the crew could have so easily allowed children to be put in such a life-threatening situation. How much of a role did racism–conscious or unconscious–play in this sequence of events? If the two children were white, would more alarm bells have gone off? Would someone have stepped forward and raised enough concerns to change the scene or shoot it differently? We never hear about the instances where danger was averted because someone stood up on set and said “No, you can’t do that!”\n\nUltimately. Landis, Allingham, Wingo, Folsey, and special effects coordinator Paul Stewart would all be charged with involuntary manslaughter and all would eventually be acquitted. Camomile got immunity as a prosecution witness. Landis should never have been allowed on a set again for the rest of his life, but instead went on to direct some of his biggest hits, including TRADING PLACES, THREE AMIGOS and COMING TO AMERICA, as well as INTO THE NIGHT, SPIES, and BEVERLY HILLS COP III. There were civil suits by the families of the victims and all were settled out of court.\n\nOn the set of TRADING PLACES, star Dan Aykroyd, who’d also appeared in TWILIGHT ZONE: THE MOVIE, was quoted in Outrageous Conduct: “When asked about the Twilight Zone crash, Aykroyd said, ‘That was an industrial accident, nothing more.'” If he really said that, I consider it one of the most heartless, callous and unfeeling statements made in the aftermath of the tragedy.\n\nWas justice done? Not in my eyes.\n\nVic Morrow was a special favorite of mine, considering that he was born and raised in the Bronx. I loved his TV show, “Combat!” (1962-67) and enjoyed him in many movies and TV appearances. Four years before the Twilight Zone shoot, he had starred in a Japanese science fiction movie I’m very fond of, MESSAGE FROM SPACE (1978), which I’ve written about here.\n\nA movie of his that came out after his death was an Italian crime movie, 1990: THE BRONX WARRIORS (1982), in which he played a hit man sent on a mission into the no-man’s land of the Bronx, all filmed on location in our home borough.\n\nAfter his death, I wrote a piece about him in my short-lived fanzine, Lowbrow Cinema.\n\nLast year, I watched some episodes from a DVD box set of Season 1 of “Combat!” In “Survival” (Season 1/#23), directed by Robert Altman, Morrow has a scene in which he’s been seriously wounded and abandoned by his squad members and has to cross a river, dazed, amidst a flurry of explosions in an alarming foreshadowing of his TWILIGHT ZONE scene.\n\nIn the audio commentary on a later episode, “The Battle of the Roses” (Season 1/#26), the director Sutton Roley recounts how he spoke to Morrow the night before the Twilight Zone tragedy and how Morrow insisted that his work on “Combat!” was always safe, but here he was doing things a stunt man should do and he only agreed because it was his chance to work on a major feature. In other accounts, Morrow allowed how he must have been crazy to agree to do the river scene.\n\nWhat kind of career could Morrow continue to have had he survived? We’ll never know. Here’s a shot of him from his segment of the four-part TWILIGHT ZONE movie. The helicopter scene was reportedly not used at all. (I’ve never seen the film myself and never will.)\n\nWhat kind of profession would have drawn the interest and devotion of Renee Chen and Myca Dinh Le? These were bright, personable children of accomplished parents, Mark and Shyan-Huei Chen and Dr. Daniel and Kim-Hoa Le. We never had a chance to find out.\n\nThanks to Chris Poggiali for finding these other pictures related to the tragedy:\n\nRe-reading Outrageous Conduct and writing this piece has been extremely difficult and heartbreaking for me, but I wanted these children to be remembered. There were a lot more damning things I could have shared about Hollywood’s reaction to this tragedy and the famous names that came to Landis’ defense, and the abrupt shutdown of the investigation into this tragedy by the National Transportation Safety Board. I’m still re-reading the book and haven’t even gotten to the rationale for acquitting the defendants, but I wanted to post this on the anniversary date. Maybe I’ll add a postscript later. In any event, you can buy the book and look it up yourselves. I remember hearing about this event on the news on a car radio the day after and being absolutely heartsick. I still am 40 years later.\n\nI only wish I had better pictures of Renee Chen and Myca Dinh Le.\n\nRemember their names."
