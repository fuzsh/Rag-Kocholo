        "text": "Bass player Peter Stålfors – Dream Evil\n\nInterviewed by: Anders Sandvall\n\nThanks to Niels Andersen at Oktober Promotion for setting up this interview\n\nThanks to Century Media for the promo pictures of the band.\n\nPromo pictures taken by: Patric Ullaeus (rEvolver Film)\n\nThe Swedish powerhouse of heavy metal Dream Evil is back with a new album. This new the one is called METAL GODS and will comes out at the end of July 2024. The bands previous album SIX was released 2017. A lot has happened in the band with guitarist Markus Fristedt (Mark U Black) back in the band since 2013, they have a new drummer in Sören Fardvik that came in the band 2019. This Gothenburg band is all about heavy metal and nothing else. I had a talk with bass player Peter Stålfors about how the past albums have done, the new/old members, the work with the new album, the guest on lead guitar Tommy Johansson (ex- Sabaton), Chris Amott (ex-Arch Enemy) and Jonathan Thorpenberg (The Unguided), how it is to work in the infamous Studio Fredman. This year the legendary album THE BOOK OF HEAVY METAL turns 20 years old and the band turns 25 years old so I had to ask if the band is going to do something with that. METAL GODS is one of the better albums this year and if you like the first ones with the band DRAGONSLAYER, EVILIZED and THE BOOK OF HEAVY METAL you will not be dissappointed with this new output. This is what Dream Evil should sound like because this is Dream Evil and nothing else. Go out and buy METAL GODS right now. Enjoy…..\n\nHi Peter, how are you doing today? Are you ready to kick off the interview?\n\nI’m great thank you. You bet!\n\nWhat has the band been up to since the release of the 2017 year album SIX?\n\nEven if Fredrik says that we are the laziest band on the moon some stuff has been going on of course. We’ve done some festivals, a tour in the UK, a live stream on Facebook and then some songwriting for the upcoming album Metal Gods which will be released on July 26.\n\nWere you happy with the outcome of SIX and did the band do any touring on the album?\n\nActually, in retrospect we didn’t feel very happy with the outcome of SIX so we felt that we needed to produce a great album. And that isn’t just dug out of the ground.. It’s actually some work. And the pandemic got in the middle of everything as well.. so there was no touring in connection with SIX, just some shows and festivals.\n\nWhen Dream Evil isn’t active what do you guys do? I know that Fredrik Nordström has his own studio but what about the rest of the band, do you all have regular jobs or so?\n\nYes we do, and that is also a big part of why things doesn’t happen very quick when it comes to releasing new albums.\n\nNiklas works as an indoor sales person, I work in an IT company, Markus works at Volvo and Sören has his own firm working with concrete foundations.\n\nWhy did guitarist Dannee Demon leave the band back in 2013 and was his departure expected?\n\nFrom both sides we had different opinions about the music style of Dream Evil. Dannee is more into Finnish troll-metal and that is something Dream Evil will never play..he he. So he felt that he couldn’t create what he wanted. So it wasn’t unexpected.\n\nHe was replaced with Mark Black that returned to the band, was it easy to get him on board again?\n\nMark left in 2007 because he got two kids only one year apart.. He couldn’t keep up with the day job, Dream Evil and his family..so he needed to focus on fewer things.. In 2013 his kids were bigger and he could focus on the music a bit more. And we just asked him if he wanted to come back and if he had the time for it.. And he came back right away.\n\nHow was it to be a musician and in a band during the Covid pandemic? What did you do during the pandemic?\n\nThe pandemic sucked in so many ways. A lot of shows being cancelled and you should only meet with few persons.. so we saw that other bands did live streams on Facebook so that was one thing.. and we focused on other things like jobs and family at that time.\n\nThe new album METAL GODS\n\nWhen did the band start to write material to METAL GODS?\n\nIn the spring of 2022 we started out in small scale and kept it going until the summer of 2023 when we were ready to record. We started the recording in September 2023.\n\nWho in the band writes the music and lyrics?\n\nWe all write music. I took a big role writing lyrics on this album as the other didn’t want to do that so much. So I’m involved in almost every song on Metal Gods.\n\nAs always the band’s lyrics are funny with a twisted sense of humor, and METAL GODS is no exception to that rule. It feels like you guys doesn’t take yourself too serious and never did?\n\nNo, we never have taken our selves serious. Metal should be fun and loud with a cold beer in each hand.\n\nWhat inspires the band to write lyrics?\n\nThat is a tough question, sometimes it just something you hear on the news or in a film that lights up an idea for writing lyrics. I saw this documentary on Netflix about a serial killer in Los Angeles who they called the Night Stalker.. that became the lyrics for one song on the album.\n\nDid you record any bonus tracks for the digi version of the album or for the Asian market?\n\nYes, we always do. We recorded fourteen songs. Ten are released on the “normal” version and there is one extra on the Japanese release. And we have three more songs to release. We don’t know when or where yet.\n\nDid you use all of the songs you wrote or were there any songs that was left behind?\n\nThere are always songs left behind.. Songs that are not completed, arranged, lyrics are missing or they’re not good enough.\n\nWhat are the longest songs “Chosen Force” (5.09), “Insane” (4.30) and “Night Stalker” (4.37) about?\n\nChosen Force is meant as the fourth song in the series of “chosen”-songs. First it was “The Chosen ones”, then it was “Chosen Twice”, after that “The Unchosen one” and now “Chosen Force”. The lyrics of Chosen force is just an idea of a super army that comes and help people in need that are faced with a deadly threat.\n\nInsane is about a cheating girlfriend. And Night Stalker is about Richard Ramirez who were a serial killer in LA in the 80’s. It’s impossible though to get all facts in to the lyrics as the music was written first and the lyrics second.. So all facts are not in there..\n\nWas Seth Siro Anton (Paradise Lost, Exodus, Rotting Christ etc) given free hands to create the art work to the album?\n\nNot really. Niklas and Seth worked a lot with the ideas and the colors. But Seth is of course the main artist of the front cover.\n\nOn METAL GODS you added some guest appearances from Chris Amott (Arch Enemy), Jonathan Thorpenberg (The Unguided) and Tommy Johansson (Sabaton, Majestica), which songs are they playing on and was it easy to convince them to join forces with you?\n\nIt’s not the first time we have guests performing on our albums. Fredrik and Mark thought it would add some extra flavor to the album so Fredrik asked them and there was no trouble getting them to play as I understand. Jonathan has been involved writing music for two songs (Metal Gods and The Tyrant Dies at Dawn) so for him doing a guest solo on “the tyrant” was a natural thing. Chris plays the solo on Born in Hell and Tommy plays the solo on Masters of Arms.\n\nHow come the album is named METAL GODS and who came up with the title?\n\nRight beside Studio Fredman is another studio where our friend Roberg Kukla works, he and his friend Jonathan Thorpenberg (Th Unguided) writes songs together, and at some point they decided to try and make a Dream Evil style song and they did, they created the music and the lyrics for the chorus on the song Metal Gods which we all thought was fantastic and we wanted it on our album. Robert came up with the title.\n\nWhy did drummer Pat Powers leave the band back in 2019?\n\nIn Pat’s early music career, he was a guitarist. And after playing drums in Dream Evil for 13 years he felt it was time for him to stretch his legs and to try to start his own band as a guitarist. He did so, the band was called “Crawl back to Zero” and later changed name to “Cronic”\n\nIs the new drummer Sören Fardvik a solid member in the line up today and how did he end up in Dream Evil?\n\nYes, you bet he’s a solid member. He’s been that from the start. We grabbed him and we will never let him go.. he he.. He’s a really great drummer. He was recording drums at Studio Fredman right after that Pat told us that he wanted to walk his own way, I don’t know for what band he recorded the drums for, but anyway, Fredrik recognized his awesome skills behind the drums and also what a truly nice guy he is. So Fredrik asked him to try out for a couple of songs and that was that.\n\nThe last song on the album is titled Y.A.N.A what does that stand for?\n\nYou Are Nothing At all. And also Yana is a past girlfriend of Marks where the relationship didn’t end so well…\n\nAt the end of May the first single “Metal Gods” was released and it currently got about 98000 hits on Youtube, what can you tell us about the video to the song?\n\nIt’s filmed by Patric Ullaeus, the Metal Video God, at Studio Fredman in Göteborg in front of green screen and put together at rEvolver studios. Not much more to say about that as Patric did all the work, we just stood there looking silly… he he..\n\nMetal Gods (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\n\nAre there any plans to shoot more videos for any of the songs on the album?\n\nYes we filmed a video for Chosen Force which was released on June 27th. And we hope to film another video for Fight in the night in the near future.\n\nChosen Force (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\n\nMany bands and artists consider their latest album to be their best one, is that also the case with Dream Evil and METAL GODS?\n\nI guess it’s the feeling of new material which you’re not tired of yet which gets that reaction that the latest is the best. And I can honestly say in my opinion that our best album is our first, but this one is without question our second best album. But that’s my opinion. We’ve got some really good reviews so far and some persons say this is the best album we’ve made.. Who knows, the future will tell. I any case, we are very proud of the outcome of Metal Gods and it is a really strong album with great songs all the way.\n\nDo you have any personal favorite song on the album, if so which one and why?\n\nIt’s really hard to pick as I think all songs are great.. But if I could only choose one, maybe Night Stalker. I love the opening riff and the different parts in the song and how they all connect with a brilliant chorus. The favorite song changes over time.. last month it was Chosen Force.\n\nHave you ready any reviews of the album? Do you care about what critics have to say about your work?\n\nYes, I have read some reviews and I’m very happy with what I’ve been reading so far, only very positive reviews.\n\nI care about what the critics have to say but the fact is also that the critics don’t know everything, all people have their music preferences and that goes for critics as well. The reviews are the critics opinion, anyone can be a critic.\n\nAs on old fan of the band since the very beginning I have to say I love METAL GODS! I really think the band has managed to incorporate the feeling of the first albums with some heavy and edgy metal music. Are you happy with the outcome or do you feel the band should have done anything different in retrospect?\n\nI am and We are very proud of the outcome, so no. Maybe get the album released faster, it was recorded in October 2023.\n\nIs Dream Evil here to stay?\n\nWe’ve been here since 1999 and we have no plans to go anywhere.\n\nStudio and production\n\nWith METAL GODS you returned to Studio Fredman, how was it to once again create music there?\n\nIt feels a little bit like home. We did not only record there, we’ve rehearsed a lot there as well and we did our live stream from there.\n\nI can’t think of any other place to record.\n\nBand member Fredrik Nordström produced the album but what’s it like to work with him in the producers seat? What’s his strongest feature as producer?\n\nFredrik has led the producing, but he wasn’t alone. We’ve worked together on this album producing. The strongest feature of Fredrik is his long experience, over the top sound quality and know how of everything about sound, tech, song arrangement and to recognize quality.\n\nHe also mixed the album but who mastered it?\n\nFredrik both mixed and mastered the album.\n\nHow long did it take overall to record METAL GODS?\n\nWe started out with the drums in September 27 and all recordings were all done by November 3. Then some mixing and finally mastering done by November 23.\n\nPast present and future\n\nEarlier this year Dream Evil was booked to perform in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmo as well as two other cities in Sweden but the show was postponed to winter, why?\n\nOur plan was to have this tour also as a promotion tour for our new album. But as the release took so much longer than we expected we had to postpone the tour.\n\nThe booking agency also canceled the shows with Jorn Lande and F.M and when people requests their money back or just asking what happened the agency keeps quiet, according to above mentioned bands hasn’t the agency full filled their commitments, do you know anything about that?\n\nWe don’t have the full picture of this yet. We’ve talked to different people and as far as we know tour is still happening.\n\nAny plans on heading out on tour now that METAL GODS is out?\n\nWe have the tour in Sweden in October and then we’re also in the middle of planning an Australian tour in November.\n\nIs the band big enough to take on a headline roll or are you heading out as supporting act if you’re heading out on tour?\n\nThe tours mentioned in the question above are both headline tours.\n\nHow was the show you did at Sweden Rock Festival in June? Did the band try out any of the new songs live?\n\nSweden Rock festival was fantastic, what a great crowd, totally mind blowing. We’d just released the single Metal Gods so we opened with that track. Totally awesome festival!\n\nDo you get any requests from the rest of Europe to come out and perform live?\n\nYes we have, but we haven’t confirmed anything yet.\n\nDo you think fans of your old albums DRAGONSLAYER (2002) and THE BOOK OF HEAVY METAL (2004) is going to like METAL GODS?\n\nAbsoFuckingLutely! It’s in that vein..\n\nTHE BOOK OF HEAVY METAL turns 20 years this year, any plans on celebrate that?\n\nWell, we haven’t planned anything but you never know what Century Media has planned. I think we did a 10 year anniversary already. But I’m not sure.\n\nAnd Dream Evil celebrates 25 years as a band this year correct? Are you going to make anything out of that?\n\nThat is true.. Fredrik started to form the band in the fall of 1999.. I joined in early 2000 so it’s soon 25 years – that’s insane. No, we haven’t planned anything but we’ll be on tour in Australia this fall so maybe we can celebrate with some kangaroos or something.. ha ha ha\n\nWhen you first started the band could you ever imagine being active 25 years into the future?\n\nNo, not at all. I don’t think anyone thought that. For Fredrik at least it was just to record one album. But things worked out and it was fun so why stop when it’s fun.. And it still is. That’s why we still do this.\n\nHow come the members got rid of your aliases/bandnames?\n\nThat is just our silly sense of humor. Me, Niklas and Fredrik never had aliases and when Gus (Konstaninos) left the band in 2004 and Markus joined Fredrik said that he needed an alias Mark U Black.\n\nSo when Patrik joined in 2006 he took the alias Pat Power and when Mark left and Daniel joined it was his time for an alias.\n\nSo when we released In The Night in 2010 Fredrik came up with the brilliant idea that we all should take aliases.. Why not (after 10 years) so we did. But we are grown up now.. we don’t need aliases anymore.. ha ha ha\n\nAnd why has the band taken down its website?\n\nWhen we set up the Dream Evil Official on Facebook we felt it was easier to just use that place for updates and information. So instead of putting in time for an updated website that no one in the band had interest in we just made a redirect from the address to the Facebook page.\n\nIs the band active on any of the social platforms? Which one do you prefer?\n\nWell, we have an Instagram as well dreamevilband (DreamEvilOfficial was taken). And as we all can administer the Facebook page it’s the preferred one of course.\n\nOn Spotify Dream Evil has got over 260 000 listeners/month, it feels that the band is pretty popular out there?\n\nYes it’s nice to see. I guess Spotify is where you reach most of your listeners even if a hard copy of an album makes you feel much happier.\n\nWhat are your thoughts regarding the streaming industry? Is it OK that people can listen to your music for free rather than going out and physical purchase a Dream Evil album?\n\nIt’s mixed emotions. I mean it’s good that you can reach a very wide audience through Spotify but I get a bit pissed off when I see the enormous profits that Spotify make and what the band earns for having the music up there. But I guess we wouldn’t sell 260000 copies of the album if we took our music down from Spotify so what can you do. I use Spotify myself so who am I to complain.. really.\n\nThe band is heading to Australia and perform, for how many dates are you booked and is it the first time you’re down there?\n\nYes, how great isn’t that! The dates and places are not official yet but I can say that it’s in late October and November. And it is our first tour in Australia.\n\nYou’re also performing at Prog Power in USA, is the band excited to perform there?\n\nYou bet! We’ve had some troubles in the past getting there. But this time it will happen. And I have heard so much positive things about this festival so we can’t wait to get there.\n\nAre you going to do more shows in USA and not only the Prog Power gig?\n\nAt this time it will only be Prog Power. The visa only cover the dates of the festival so there is no time for anything else.\n\nIs there a huge interest for Dream Evil in USA and Asia?\n\nLooking at statistics from Spotify it shows that USA is our biggest fan base by far. Asia, Japan in particular was a big fan base in early 2000 but it seems to have dropped a bit.\n\nAre you happy with the band have done so far as a band with albums and playing live.Or do you wish you have played more or have done more albums that you have done?\n\nI’m very happy with what we’ve done so far and all the experiences I have had with Dream Evil. It was a big childhood dream to record an album and to go on a tour, and that dream has been fulfilled many times over. Also having a regular job and a family makes the band a fun side project and not a full time job to get tired of. Every time we do something together it’s like a trip with good friends having fun together. It’s all about what your goals in life are and this has been perfect for me.\n\nThere are some troubled times in the world with the war in The Ukraine and the Israel-Palestine conflict, what’s your thoughts on the situation in the world today?\n\nIt’s worrying. I can’t believe why they keep the wars running. It’s wrong in all ways. Enough is enough. I mean I read that the Russians have lost about half a million personnel in their special military operation.. How can that be justified to carry on an attack on a neighbor country? I feel for the Ukrainian’s and for those in Russia against the war.\n\nCould you give the readers three reasons why they should buy METAL GODS?\n\nIt’s a NEW Dream Evil album\n\nIt’s in my opinion Very good\n\nIf you liked DragonSlayer and/or The book of Heavy Metal you will love this one.\n\nAnd what would you like to say to the ones who haven’t heard the brilliant metal music from Dream Evil yet?\n\nGive it a listen, who knows you might just love it.\n\nMy time is up but before I leave you I have to thank you so much for making this interview with me and metal-rules.com. I love METAL GODS and I really hope to see you performing live soon! I have missed Dream Evil and I’m so glad that you are back! I wish you and the band all the best in the future, do you have any final words of wisdom to share with fans and readers worldwide?\n\nI guess you already drawn everything out from me so there’s only one thing left to say and that is – Heavy Metal In the Night\n\nwww.facebook.com/DreamEvilOfficial\n\nInstagram\n\nLabel\n\nwww.centurymedia.com\n\nFacebook Page / Instagram Page /"
