        "text": "‘Twilight Zone: The Movie’: The full story of a tragic helicopter disaster\n\nThe 1983 sci-fi anthology movie Twilight Zone: The Movie was meant to pay homage to the classic television show by Rod Serling that ran between 1959 and 1964. The film is made up of four stories directed respectively by John Landis, Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante and George Miller, with Landis writing an original story and the latter three directors remaking episodes from the original series.\n\nWith the likes of Dan Ackroyd, Albert Brooks, and Scatman Crothers joining original cast members Burgess Meredith, Patricia Barry, Peter Brocco and several others, Twilight Zone: The Movie ought to have been a celebration of one of the most beloved science fiction series of all time, but it is largely remembered for a horrifying accident that took place during its production, leaving a dark shadow over its release and legacy.\n\nIt was during the filming of John Landis’ segment ‘Time Out’, a reimagining of the episode ‘A Quality of Mercy’, that tragedy struck. Vic Morrow plays a bigot who is transported through a series of historical moments to witness the effect his prejudice can have, and during the Vietnam War scene, Morrow’s character is meant to carry two Vietnamese children to safety.\n\nChild actors Myca Dinh Le and Renne Shin-Yi Chen had been hired illegally by the producers of the film, and as a helicopter in the scene suddenly lost control and crashed into the ground, they, along with Morrow himself, were tragically killed, while each of the six helicopter passengers were seriously injured. There was a distinct lack of safety measures on the set of the production, particularly surrounding the use of child actors, and both Le and Chen were hired without the required permits, while several labour violations also took place.\n\nAt Indian Dunes in Santa Clarita, California, known for being used in The Color Purple and Escape from New York, Vietnam War veteran Dorcey Wingo was piloting the helicopter for the rescue scene, but when preparing for the next scene, a mortar effect was detonated, leading to the chopper’s rotor to detach from its tail. The helicopter fell towards Morrow, Le and Chen, with the former two being decapitated by the rotor blades and Chen being crushed by the helicopter itself. All three died instantly.\n\nIf the initial tragedy wasn’t bad enough, then the aftermath continued to provide stress for all involved, as legal action and investigations were undertaken to find out which such a terrible incident had occurred. Landis and many of the crew members were charged with involuntary manslaughter, though no one was found to be criminally liable. The result was that new procedures surrounding on-set safety were implemented across the film industry.\n\nThe trials saw much to-and-fro about who was to blame. Some claimed that the mortal effect had been detonated too early, while others argued that Landis himself had ignored warnings about the stunt. It came to light that the parents of Le and Chen had not been informed that their children would be anywhere near explosives or danger of any kind. They eventually collected millions of dollars from a series of civil lawsuits, but no amount of money could ever replace their dear kin.\n\nSpielberg, who ended his friendship with Landis shortly after, said the incident made everyone “sick to the centre of our souls”, noting: “No movie is worth dying for. I think people are standing up much more now than ever before to producers and directors who ask too much. If something isn’t safe, it’s the right and responsibility of every actor or crew member to yell ‘Cut!'”\n\nTwilight Zone: The Movie ought to have been a homage to a classic science fiction TV series, but it ended up being a moment of genuine tragedy. Its release, though profitable, was marred by the harrowing loss of life, but it still serves as a reminder to directors and producers to perform their due diligence and ensure the safety of their cast and crew members as an absolute imperative.\n\nWhat is The Twilight Zone?\n\nThe Twilight Zone, created by Rod Serling and originally airing between 1959 and 1964, is one of the most iconic and influential science fiction TV series of all time. With a combination of sci-fi, fantasy and psychological drama, Serling’s show managed to explore the deeper and darker side of the human psyche through a speculative fictional lens, with each episode provoking the thought of its widespread audience.\n\nSerling also provided the show’s narration and his opening line to each episode: “You’re travelling to another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind” became synonymous with the mystery and intrigue that ran throughout each story. Quite simply, The Twilight Zone is one of the most enduring and vital pieces of science fiction to ever be assimilated into our wider pop culture history.\n\nWhat is Twilight Zone: The Movie about?\n\nTwilight Zone: The Movie was released in 1983, based on Rod Serling’s original TV show. Consisting of four segments directed respectively by John Landis, Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante and George Miller, plus a prologue featuring Dan Aykroyd and Albert Brooks discussing the mystery and allure of Serling’s series, the film was intended as an homage to Serling, but was sadly marred by the tragic on-set accident that claimed the lives of three of its actors.\n\n‘Time Out’ featured a bigot, played by Vic Morrow, who travels through a series of historical periods, learning of the effects and consequences his prejudice has on others and gaining empathy along the way. ‘Kick the Can’ saw a group of retirement home residents learn the joy of playing children’s games once again, emboldening their spirits. ‘It’s a Good Life’ had a teacher experience the god-like powers of a strange young boy. Finally, ‘Nightmare at 20,000 Feet’ focused on a man’s encounter with a fearsome creature on an aeroplane’s wing during a stormy flight."
