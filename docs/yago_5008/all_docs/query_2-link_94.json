        "text": "The 1960s saw oodles of television programs with war themes, particularly World War II. It happens when a program is successful on one network and the others try to cash in on that success.\n\nCop shows such as Hill Street Blues, Kojak, Columbo and others ruled the airwaves for a time. Then it was doctor shows like Marcus Welby, M.D., Dr. Kildare, Ben Casey, St. Elsewhere and others.\n\nScience fiction had its turn with Star Trek, Lost in Space, The Twilight Zone, Land of the Giants and The Time Tunnel. There were also the lawyers with Perry Mason, L.A. Law and Matlock.\n\nDon't forget the Westerns like Bonanza, Rawhide, The Big Valley and Gunsmoke.\n\nEven though there were only three television networks in the '60s – NBC, CBS and ABC – there were 10 series with World War II as a backdrop: Rat Patrol, Hogan's Heroes, McHale's Navy and 12 O'Clock High were among the more popular shows.\n\nIn 1965, no war series was hotter that Combat!, starring Vic Morrow. The show ran on ABC from 1962-1967.\n\nMorrow was born Victor Morizoff on Valentine's Day, 1929, in the Bronx, New York. Morrow starred in tons of movies on television and the big screen. He earned an Emmy nomination for his role in Combat!\n\nIn 1965, Morrow visited the local ABC affiliate, New Bedford's WTEV Channel 6, on County Street to promote Combat! In 1980, after changing its call letters to WLNE, Channel 6 moved to nearby Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nMorrow died on July 23, 1982. He was decapitated in an on-set accident while filming Twilight Zone: The Movie."
