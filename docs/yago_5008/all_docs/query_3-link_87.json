        "text": "I’ve read tons of movie star biographies, but the highly readable “The Garner Files” by James Garner and Jon Winokur (out Nov. 1 from Simon and Schuster) is the first one I’ve seen where an actor provides capsule reviews of all his movies. Even more unusually, Garner rates all but one of them from zero to five stars. The ones he ratest most highly are “The Americanization of Emily” (1964) and “The Notebook” (2004) with five stars; and “The Great Escape” (1963) “Grand Prix” (1966) and “Murphy’s Romance” (1985) with four apiece.\n\nGarner is not stingy with zingers for those films he rates at the other end of the spectrum. Some excerpts:\n\n“Mr. Buddwing” (1966). Zero stars. “Worst picture I ever made. What were they thinking? What was I thinking?”\n\n“One Little Indian” (1973). One quarter-star. “I’ve done some things I’m not proud of. This is one of them.”\n\n“The Fan” (1981). One-half star. “Can there be more than one ‘worst-picture-I-ever-made’?\n\n“How Sweet It Is!” (1968). “Loved Debbie Reynolds. Loved Paul Lynde. Loved Terry Thomas. Hated the movie.”\n\n“The Pink Jungle” (1968). “I made this thing for the money and I’m lucky it didn’t wreck my career.”\n\n“A Man Called Sledge” (1970) One-half star. “I wish I could remember why I let Dino De Laurentiis talk me into making this turkey. The poster says, ‘Not suitable for children.’ It should have read ‘Not suitable for human consumption.’ ”\n\n“The Castaway Cowboy” (1974) One-half star. “M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E,” he writes of this Disney production. “The best thing in it is the Hawaiian scenery.”\n\n“Up Periscope” (1959). One star. “Another piece of crap that Warner Bros. stuck me in while I was under contract.”\n\n“The Girl He Left Behind” (1956). “It was awful and I was awful, but it was the best I could do at the time.”\n\n“Shoot-Out at Medicine Bend” (1957). “The movie isn’t worth a damn. I was under contract, so I had to do what they put in front of me.”\n\n“They Only Kill Their Masters” (1972). Two stars. “I’d rather not talk about it.”\n\nThe only one of his 46 features that Garner doesn’t assign a star rating to is “The Distinguished Gentleman” (1992). “I can’t remember a thing about this picture,” he writes. “I can live with that.”"
