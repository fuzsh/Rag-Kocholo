        "text": "Soul singer Percy Sledge called Louisiana home, but he always had a place to stay in Gastonia.\n\nSledge, best known for his 1966 hit, “When a Man Loves a Woman,” died Tuesday at 74.\n\nLocal club owner Charles Gunn said he’s sad to know he’ll never hear Sledge sing in Gaston County again.\n\nFrequent face in town\n\nGunn first hosted a visit from Sledge in 1971.\n\n“When he had that song out, ‘When a Man Loves a Woman,’ everybody was after him,” said Gunn.\n\nAnd Gastonia got him 23 times, according to Gunn.\n\nThe smiling, gap-toothed singer didn’t hesitate to play events in town over the course of decades, Gunn said.\n\nGunn said he called Sledge’s agent in November, hoping to book another date.\n\n“His agent said he had cancer real bad and wouldn’t be touring anymore,” Gunn said.\n\nThe disease ultimately took Sledge’s life.\n\nPrivate person, singing success\n\nBut Gunn remembers a vivacious, gracious Sledge.\n\nGunn featured Sledge on the stage of the former Dino’s Restaurant and Club. Sledge always stayed after the show and signed autographs until everyone was satisfied, but he also liked some time alone, Gunn said.\n\n“We always wanted him to go to the Shrimp Boat with us, but he was a private person,” said Gunn.\n\nBefore he became famous, Sledge worked in the cotton fields around his hometown of Leighton in northwest Alabama and took a job in a nearby hospital.\n\nHe spent weekends playing with a rhythm-and-blues band. A hospital patient heard him singing and recommended him to a record producer.\n\nKey to the city\n\nFormer Gastonia Mayor Jennie Stultz remembers listening to Sledge on the radio when she was a teenager.\n\nStultz said she was thrilled years later when she had the opportunity to meet Sledge and present him with a key to the city.\n\nStultz remembers Sledge saying that when he first started coming to Gastonia, he feared he wouldn’t have a place to stay or might be arrested because of race relations in the country at the time. He never imagined he’d be given a key to the city.\n\nBut Sledge never struggled for a place to stay when he was in town, Gunn said.\n\n“People would take him home instead of having him stay in a hotel. Everybody loved Percy,” said Gunn.\n\nGunn said his love for Sledge and his music never waned, and getting the news of the musician’s passing was tough.\n\n“I think he got better with age,” Gunn said. “He was well known in Gastonia. People really loved him. We’re really going to miss him.”\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.\n\nSong’s staying power\n\n“When a Man Loves a Woman”\n\n- Featured in movies including “The Big Chill,” “The Crying Game” and a 1994 Meg Ryan drama named for the song's title.\n\n- Re-released after being featured in Oliver Stone’s Vietnam War film “Platoon” in 1987 and reached No. 2 in Britain.\n\n- Took Michael Bolton to the top of the charts in the 1990s\n\n- Ranked by Rolling Stone magazine as No. 53 on its list of the greatest songs of all time.\n\nStar’s staying power\n\nPercy Sledge had a handful of other hits between 1966 and 1968, including “Warm and Tender Love,” “It Tears Me Up,” “Out of Left Field” and “Take Time to Know Her.”\n\nHe returned to the charts in 1974 with \"I'll Be Your Everything.\"\n\nSledge was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nHe was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame in 1993 and the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nSource: The Associated Press"
