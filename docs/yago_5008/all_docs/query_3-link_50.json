        "text": "\"When SLEDGE hits town it stays hit!\"\n\nJames Garner (TV's 'Maverick' and 'The Rockford Files'), in a decidedly different change-of-pace role, is a ruthless outlaw who leads his gang of thieves in search of a fortune in gold in this explosive western adventure. Sledge (Garner) learns of a gold cache stored in a prison fortress and gathers his gang to pursue the loot.
