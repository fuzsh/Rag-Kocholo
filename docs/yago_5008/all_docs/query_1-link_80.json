        "text": "A Man Called Sledge (1970)\n\nJames Garner (TV's \"Maverick\" and \"The Rockford Files\"), in a decidedly different change-of-pace role, is a ruthless outlaw who leads his gang of thieves in search of a fortune in gold.\n\nSledge (Garner) learns of a gold cache stored in a prison fortress and gathers his gang to pursue the loot. His partners in crime include Dennis Weaver (TV's \"Gunsmoke\" and \"McCloud\"). Claude Akins and John Marley. Against a backdrop of double crosses, dirty dealings and revenge, their gold lust end in a hail of bullets, two-fisted action and cold-blooded murder.\n\nAn offbeat spaghetti western in the tradition of Sam Peckinpah, A Man Called Sledge was directed and co-written by famed screen actor Vic Morrow (The Blackboard Jungle, Twilight Zone: The Movie)\n\nStarring :\n\nJames Garner, Claude Akins, Dennis Weaver\n\nDirector :\n\nVic Morrow\n\nRunning time : 92 Minutes"
