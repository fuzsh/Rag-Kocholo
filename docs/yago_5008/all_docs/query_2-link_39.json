        "text": "Good morning, and welcome to the Essential California newsletter. It’s Sunday, June 16. I am Christopher Goffard, a Times reporter and sometime podcaster. Here’s what you need to know to start your day:\n\nRevisiting the deadly ‘Twilight Zone’ movie set disaster\n\nEl Niño makes an exit, but La Niña could bring dry conditions back to California\n\nSwanky airport lounges are arriving at LAX\n\nAnd here’s today’s e-newspaper\n\n‘Crimes of The Times:’ The ‘Twilight Zone’ disaster cast a harsh light on Hollywood\n\nI’ve been writing a new series called “Crimes of The Times,” looking at old criminal cases — the famous, the obscure and everything in between.\n\nOne of the most infamous cases from my childhood was the “Twilight Zone” movie-set disaster of 1982. Growing up in Los Angeles, it was hard to escape the terrible footage on the nightly news of the plunging helicopter that killed Vic Morrow and two children. The subsequent trial of director John Landis and four associates went on for 10 months.\n\nAll five defendants were acquitted of involuntary manslaughter, but the trial did not put to rest questions of moral culpability. The children — My-Ca Le, 7, and Renee Chen, 6 — should not have been on that movie set at 2 a.m.. Landis had known he was breaking labor laws.\n\nThomas Budds, the L.A. County sheriff’s detective assigned to the case, told me it was originally described as an “industrial accident.” Now 78 and long retired, he recalls stepping onto the crash site in Indian Dunes and being struck by the reek of gasoline from pyrotechnic explosives.\n\nSome people associated with the production were hesitant to talk to him, for fear of being blackballed in Hollywood. But Budds conducted hundreds of interviews that shaped his abiding view of Landis as an arrogant, overbearing filmmaker who had demanded a big special-effects spectacle in hopes of outshining his more famous peers, like Steven Spielberg.\n\n“I think he wanted to be the breakout guy,” Budds told me.\n\nIn other installments of the series, I talk to Marcia Clark about the challenges of prosecuting the obsessed stalker who murdered actress Rebecca Schaeffer, a landmark case that inspired the nation’s first anti-stalking laws.\n\nI revisit the case of William Leasure, the LAPD traffic cop with the forgettable face and the bland-as-vanilla manner who happened to moonlight as a contract killer.\n\nAnd I tell the story of Paul Morantz, the crusading attorney who took on the Synanon rehab cult and reached into his mailbox to find retaliation in the form a rattlesnake.\n\nAs older cases fade into the past, it’s harder to find key participants who are able to talk about them. One goal of Crimes of The Times is to find these living links to the past, whenever possible, and get their voices on the record.\n\nIn coming weeks, I’ll be writing about the McMartin preschool case; a little-remembered figure from the Charles Manson saga; the 1910 bombing of the Los Angeles Times; and the bizarre recovered-memory prosecution of George Franklin.\n\nIs there a crime you want us to write about? Send tips my way.\n\nThe week’s biggest stories\n\nCalifornia weather\n\nEl Niño makes an exit, but La Niña could bring dry conditions back to California.\n\n‘Significant’ weekend warming will give Southern California a short break from June gloom.\n\nDisney\n\nHeading to a Disney theme park?
