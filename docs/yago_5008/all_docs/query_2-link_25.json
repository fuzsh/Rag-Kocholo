It has a SW edge to it and Garner plays an out of character, for him, bastard, who rules his gang with determination. Some suggest homosexual tendencies between the gang members, but I can’t see it. Just a bunch of outlaws who are staying alive by the mercy and cooperation of the rest of the gang. When pain in the ass Marley destroys this trust and pits one against the other the gang falls apart. Not a great SW but a change of pace film with many familiar faces. Morrow plays the part of the Scout on the painted horse of the professional guards protecting the gold shipment.\n\nI’ve been to the town shown at the end of this film in 2005 and it still looks the same. That’s one great things about the Spanish locations, they were real towns or sets still used as tourist attractions today. Even the ruins can be located if you know where to look.\n\nI love it. Great finale shootout and a spaghetti feel throughout. Top 20 for me; Five stars; as 18.95 on 20 ... etc. Long time since I've seen it but I seem to remember (I think it's this) when a crucifix is tied to a gunhand - as a splint - for a shootout ... great spaghetti irreligeous touch (forgive me Lord).\n\nThe whole final shootout has a lot of religious symbolism/imagery, including that great touch of having the crucifx as a splint, which I love. If I remember right, Hooker and the Old Man are waiting for Sledge in a crumbling church too.\n\nI’m glad to see other people enjoy this one. I’ve read a lot of reviews that rip it to pieces, but I’ve always enjoyed it. And Sledge’s gang is one of my favorite movie gangs, lots of cool characters, not just Garner, Marley, Akins and Weaver. Here’s a trailer I found at Youtube that has some of the movie’s really quirky soundtrack. Enjoy!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zu5tgU-LZaI\n\nMAN CALLED SLEDGE 1970 James Garner, Dennis Weaver, Laura Antonelli\n\nThis is a masterful, exciting, violent, beautiful, tense, well directed, superbly cast SW.\n\nI have given it a 5 star vote and I PREFER this MAN CALLED SLEDGE 1970 much more\n\nthan that “Great Silence” 1968 which is good but ruined by that Jean Louis Trintignant ???\n\nMy Vote for A MAN CALLED SLEDGE is 17 out of 20 .\n\nObviously a matter of preferences and personal tastes but, quite frankly, trying not to be judgmental in view of such statements is a hard an stoic exercise.\n\nTrintignant “ruined” The Great Silence? Wow!\n\nApart from the fact that The Great Silence is one of the very best (top 6-7) SW and one of the best 10-20 westerns ever.\n\nLike I said: There are as many opinions (possible) as ass holes…\n\nYes Manco there are many ARS or A-SS HOLE BIGOT Opinions set in stone and STUPID\n\nSTUPID and BIGOTED A-ss Hole “opinion” “Great Silence 68” is a Top 5 or Top 20 ???\n\nSTUPID and BIGOTED A-ss Hole “opinion” “Great Silence 68” had a \"good \" cast ???\n\nThe Great Silence 1968 is a Good, enjoyable SW but it IS NOT Top 5 or Top 20\n\nit has a SECONDARY “B” cast in Trintignant, Kinski and Mcgee and those are FLAWS.\n\nTrintignant is NOT a good actor , not a SW actor and is usually in ultra boring dramas :-\\\n\nA TOP RATED “A” cast would have been something like F.NERO J.PALANCE L.PALUZZI.\n\nI would give The Great Silence a score of 12 out of 20.\n\nHi Alko\n\nNothing personal I was replying to Manco and he did infer that TGS is \"beyond criticism\"\n\nand referred to As-s holes in a way I disliked.\n\nOther posters on this thread have praised MAN CALLED SLEDGE 1970 and given\n\nit even higher scores than I did.\n\nI have never said that TGS is NOT a good, well made, pleasing SW but I have every\n\nright to point out clear FACTS like the cast being SECOND RATE and Trintignant’s dramas.\n\nKinski is good in many SWs/Giallos/Horror but he is NOT a leading man but supporting.\n\nAlso you Alko should NOT assume that everyone has TGS in their top 20 or top 5\n\nbecause I HAVE NOT and prefer the other Sergio Corbucci SWs like MERCENARIO 1968\n\nYou see I like to judge a SW or a FILM on facts, merits, analysis and also important\n\nTo JUDGE a SW / Film properly you MUST BE ABLE to UNDERSTAND the words.\n\nIf you like me speak “perfect” English and Italian then a SW or Film must be in either.\n\nIt is NOT fair or correct to review and criticize a SW of Film if you did NOT understand\n\nthe words completely and absorbed everything that each character said and felt.\n\nJust watching the pictures and understanding nothing of the words/feelings is BAD.\n\nNo wonder we have been getting some very INCORRECT reviews and allegations that\n\nANTHONY STEFFEN (He is an all time SW great) was somehow “wooden” ??? ???\n\nLook to DeNiro, Streep, Wooden Allen, Bogart, Pacino for any WOODEN specimens !! :’("
