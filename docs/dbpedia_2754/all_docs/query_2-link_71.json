        "text": "Why are the Application Codes of PAHs changed? ***NEW***\n\nIs there any further explanation as to how to select an Application ID?\n\nWhy do the Jokers contain the phrase \"not to declare\"?\n\nIs there a description concerning confidentiality handling and confidential substances?\n\nIs there additional information on rules and handling for Parts Marking?\n\nWhat is the obligation on Recyclate Information for Material Data Sheets?\n\nIs there additional information regarding the requirement of a Standard Material Number according to Recommendation IMDS001?\n\nHow can the Analysis Weight be different than the Calculated Weight?\n\nWhat is the reason for \"weighted means\" in IMDS rather than just means?\n\nIs there a better explanation for the permitted ranges in Recommendation 001?\n\nWhat is Specific Weight and how should it be entered?\n\nWhy are the Application Codes of PAHs changed?\n\nNew restrictions were applied to the following 8 PAHs due to the review of REACH Annex XVII. Therefore, new Application Codes were introduced for these 8 PAHs.\n\n205-99-2 Benz(e)acephenanthrylene\n\n56-55-3 Benz[a]anthracene\n\n50-32-8 Benzo(a)pyrene\n\n192-97-2 Benzo(e)pyrene\n\n205-82-3 Benzo[j]fluoranthene\n\n207-08-9 Benzo[k]fluoranthene\n\n218-01-9 Chrysene\n\n53-70-3 Dibenz[a,h]anthracene\n\nThe two new Application Codes “Repetitive skin contact (required according to REACH 1907/2006 EC Annex XVII Entry 50)” and “Not applicable (no repetitive skin contact)” have now to be used instead of the 8 PAHs mentioned above. These previous Application Codes are no longer available.\n\nFor the mentioned 8 PAHs in tires, Application Code selection is also limited to the two new Application Codes.\n\nThe Application Codes \"Not Applicable\" and \"PAH in lubricating oil” were set to the status \"hidden\". They can no longer be selected in newly created components. Other PAH Application Codes can still be used for other PAHs.\n\nIs there any further explanation as to how to select an Application ID?\n\nApplication codes are related to some legal requirements on certain substances or substance groups. The application codes relate to how the material is used in a component (part). Although it might appear that application codes are related to a material, in actuality it is only possible to select an application code when the material is first attached (referenced) by a component. There may other material nodes or semi-component nodes in the path between the material and the component. It is the usage on the component that determines the appropriate application code.\n\nThere is a large number of application codes that can be used, but only a few are valid for each circumstance. In order to assist the user, IMDS only presents application codes relevant to the situation. The \"possible\" application codes depend on: the material classification, the basic substance, and the % of basic substance in the material. If you do not find an expected application code, then either the material classification is incorrect or the % of the basic substance in the material is too high.\n\nThe attached file (downloadable Excel file, updated August 2023) indicates which application codes are permissable in each situation. For ease of use, the tabs in the file relates to a specific substance category: Lead, Hexavalent Chromium, Mercury, Cadmium, Nickel and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons. The first column of \"Applications\" worksheet shows all applications with their text applicable to the substance. The following columns show all material classifications. The resulting table shows the valid applications for a substance within a material of the specified classification. Only where an entry appears in the column is the combination of application and material classification valid. If there is an additional percentage value (e.g. x ≤ 4%), the application is valid only when the percentage of the substance in the material does not exceed the stated percentage value.\n\nWith IMDS Release 12.2, the user is responsible to actively select the correct application code.\n\nHere you can find an IMDS Steering Committee document on the application changes for your support (Version: June 2016).\n\nWhy do the Jokers contain the phrase \"not to declare\"?\n\nJokers/wildcards can be used to replace “highly confidential substances” in the material formula. However, the user MUST NOT use a joker/wildcard as a substitute for a declarable or prohibited substance on the GADSL or Renault lists or for a substance that requires an application code. Use of the phrase “not to declare” reminds the user of this.\n\nDue to the requirement that every time the GADSL is updated, the user is required to review all of his materials that contain a joker/wildcard, it is suggested that the use of jokers/wildcards be reduced/eliminated the next time the material is updated and instead use the actual substance and mark it “confidential”.\n\nIs there a description concerning confidentiality handling and\n\nconfidential substances?\n\nMaterials have to be reported in their final state. For example, if using a polymer such as ABS, you do not report the chemicals that are used for polymerizing ABS. You use an ABS pseudo-substance from the system. Similarly, in paints and adhesives, only the “cured” product is to be reported. However, you do need to report all additives like e.g. pigments, flame retardants, and fillers. You can go to Substance Search and select a substance group to see substances in that group. By using pseudo-substances, where applicable, much of the concern about proprietary formulations is laid to rest.\n\nFor the confidential substances: Technically, you can use a joker/wildcard as a substitute for highly confidential substances. However, you cannot use a joker/wildcard for any substances that is declarable or prohibited according to GADSL, application relevant, on a Renault list or an SVHC on the REACH candidate list. But every time one of these lists changes you have to check your entries with a joker/wildcard and certify that the joker/wildcard does not replace a substance which now can be found on the above mentioned lists. That’s a lot of work.\n\nOEMs would prefer if you use the IMDS functionality of marking substances as confidential instead of using jokers/wildcards. Most substances – those not declarable or prohibited according to GADSL, application-relevant, on a Renault list or an SVHC on the REACH candidate list – will have a checkbox next to confidential when added to the tree structure. Should you check the box, only specific users who have been granted “Trust user” status by a Company Administrator in your company can see the actual substance in the tree structure. All other users will only see the expression “confidential substance”. This includes both users in your own IMDS company and OEMs – users in your OEM or in their offline system will not be able to see what the substance is. All they will know is that since it is marked confidential, it cannot be on the GADSL, require an application code, be a joker, or SVHCs on the REACH candidate list.\n\nShould the status of the substance change, for example it will be added to one of the lists , the Company Administrator of the material creating company and users of the company who request notification on settings will receive an e-mail indicating that resubmission is required as the substance can no longer be marked confidential.\n\nYou can mark up to 10% of the substances in a material as “confidential” without generating an IMDS warning.\n\nIs there additional information on rules and handling for Parts\n\nMarking?\n\nPlease find the answer in this document.\n\nWhat is the obligation on Recyclate Information for Material\n\nData Sheets?\n\nWith IMDS Release 14.0 (active since May 2023) the IMDS Steering Committee published a new Recommendation IMDS025. This Recommendation can be found in the IMDS after Login under Help > Recommendation. All requirements for entering recyclate information are described in this document.\n\nIs there additional information regarding the requirement of a\n\nStandard Material Number according to Recommendation IMDS001?\n\nThe standard material number field is only available for material classifications 1x - 4x. This number is from a numbering schema that uniquely identifies the chemical composition of the metal. Different parts of the world use different standards. One of the more popular numbering schemas is the UNS (Unified Numbering System), although the Japanese standard is JIS. Another schema is the VDeH which only encompasses Steels and Irons.\n\nIt should be noted that not all materials in classification 1x - 4x are manufactured to a norm or have a standard material number. A missing value in this field is not an automatic reason for rejection (which is why lack of a value does not result in a warning or error in IMDS).\n\nPrior to Release 4.1 it was impossible to add a standard material number e.g. for copper alloys. Therefore, data without standard material number are still valid, if they were created before IMDS Release 4.1. Please check the release date on materials of this classification.\n\nHow can the Analysis Weight be different than the Calculated\n\nWeight?\n\nIf tolerances were not allowed, the Calculated weight would always equal the Analysis weight. However, since tolerances are allowed, there are sometimes differences.\n\nIn the check function to release an MDS, the system compares the “Measured Weight” of the parent with the “Sum of the Measured Weight” of the children (Calculated Weight).\n\nHowever, Analysis checks the measured weights of the entire tree structure.\n\nFor further information, please read How can I find where I've used a particular substance or how can I analyze MDSs or how can the Analysis function be best used?\n\nWhat is the reason for \"weighted means\" in IMDS rather than\n\njust means?\n\nIf the sum of all single means from sub-nodes in a product structure tree is not 100% a correction of these means is necessary. For doing so, the ranges are used as weighting coefficient. Large ranges are corrected more, smaller ranges less.\n\nCalculating the means is carried out according to the formula\n\n(min + max) / 2 (= arithmetic mean)\n\nHowever, there are exeptions to this rule, e.g. if the sum of all arithmetic means plus fix values is larger or smaller than 100%.\n\nTo give you an example with one MDS containing two materials with ranges:\n\nA 30 - 51% (arithmetic mean 40.5%)\n\nB 49 - 60% (arithmetic mean 54.5%)\n\nThere are no further nodes on this level and no rest. The sum of the arithmetic means is 95%.\n\nTherefore, a correction of these means is necessary in order to reach 100%. For doing so, the ranges (21 for the first node and 11 for the second node) are used as weighting coefficient.\n\nFor splitting up the missing 5% the sum of all ranges is needed:\n\n21% + 11% = 32%\n\nCorrective value for material A: 5% / 32% x 21% = 3,28125%\n\nCorrective value for material B: 5% / 32% x 11% = 1,71875%\n\nThe following weighted means are the result:\n\nA 40,5% + 3,28125% = 43,78125%\n\nB 54,5% + 1,71875% = 56,21875%\n\nIt is also possible that the sum of all substances in one case is 99.99999% and in another 100.000001%. These differences to 100% are a result of rounding-off differences if there are many nodes and many corrective values to be calculated.\n\nIs there a better explanation for the permitted ranges in\n\nRecommendation 001?\n\nTo determine the range permitted and not receive the Recommendation 001 warning\n\nNote your material classification.\n\nUse the Material classification to find the right table - most will use the 3rd table.\n\nNote your lower limit.\n\nSelect the correct row in the table paying particular attention to the breakpoints. If it is on the border, the higher row in the table is used.\n\nFind the associated M value.\n\nAdd M to the lower limit to get the maximum allowable upper value that will not generate a warning.\n\nPlease note that while the IMDS System allows you to send an MDS with warnings, it is up to your customer to decide whether to accept a warning or not.\n\nWhat is Specific Weight and how should it be entered?"
