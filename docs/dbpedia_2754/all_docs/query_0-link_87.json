Much happier with it now Good ol' Harley Quinn as a jester (joker) playing card I did for funsies. Thought I'd give colouring entirely with the pen tool a try and I'm really pleased with how it looks. Also quite happy to actually finish, I'm in the habbit of drawing lots atm but finishing very few of them, I get bored or excited by a new idea and off i go. *Roll eyes* Hope you like!
