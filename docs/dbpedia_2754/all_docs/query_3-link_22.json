        "text": "Without further ado, here’s the answer: Brazil. Yes, France’s longest border is with Brazil, a country on an entirely different continent. Not with Spain, Belgium, or any other European nation. Even though most people only think of the European part when they think of France.\n\nYou’re probably starting to see the pattern with all these trick questions in our quizzes (I’ll have to switch things up to keep you on your toes for our next one, haha).\n\nHere are the details about France’s longest border and about the Guianas.\n\nFrance’s longest border\n\nFirst of all, for those who are new to following us and don’t know that we never make things up, here is the proof from Google.\n\nHere’s an infographic with the length of all 11 borders France shares with neighbors — on different continents.\n\nSo while the longest border France shares is with Brazil via the Guianas region, France’s longest border in Europe (or let’s say Metropolitan France‘s longest border) is in fact with Belgium, which narrowly beats out Spain.\n\nFrench Guiana\n\nFrance is not just in Europe! A relatively large French overseas region is located on the South American continent and borders Brazil. It’s called French Guiana.\n\nIt’s the last remaining part of the mainland Americas that’s still part of a European nation.\n\nAs such, French Guiana is legally just as French as metropolitan France back in Europe, unlike many overseas territories that have particular jurisdiction in some countries.\n\nThere is no such distinction with French Guiana, except the obvious geographic one. Residents of French Guiana are full citizens of France. The French Guiana territory is fully a part of France.\n\nIt’s part of the European Union (EU).\n\nSo since it’s entirely part of France, that territory’s border with Brazil (730 km) means France’s longest border is there, not in Europe.\n\nThe Guianas region\n\nBy the way, this is a fascinating part of the world, relatively remote and isolated. It would be an awesome spot for those who want to avoid overcrowded, touristy places.\n\nThe Guyanas region (the name means “land of many waters”) is not just comprised of that French territory, as 5 different European countries colonized 5 distinct Guianas:\n\nFrench Guiana\n\nBritish Guiana (now the independent nation of Guyana)\n\nDutch Guiana (now the independent nation of Suriname)\n\nPortuguese Guiana (now a region of Brazil)\n\nSpanish Guiana (now a region of Venezuela)\n\nThe Guyanas region was one of the international trips that I had booked for 2019 in my quest to visit every country in the world (to visit Guyana and Suriname). But, after a change of plans, I was able to cancel my non-refundable booking for free, thanks to a pro tip I will share in an upcoming article.\n\nMake sure you join 90,000+ Canadian travelers and sign up for our free newsletter to get all our content (and 50% off flight deals from your city)!\n\nWant to get more content to discover awesome destinations?\n\nSummary\n\nSo there you have it: France’s longest border isn’t with a country in Europe, but instead with Brazil, thanks to the little-known French territory of French Guiana on the South American continent.\n\nWhat would you like to know about the borders of France or the Guianas?
