        "text": "1.\n\nMTV 03:31\n\nA nation drowns in its reflection, the rotting corpse of history Bring a death to perfection, designer lies you bought for free In your thirst for importance you fall to greed and tyranny All of my greatest friends are the acne of society He was his own slave, his own slave, his own Fucked up values bruise all that i love They hurt you , the hurt you, they forced you to hide Watch them, their cultural suicide At the borders, torn up families are piled up in their sheds The safest place in the real world is the most dangerous in my head Defected generation with the blood of their youth on their hands Defected generation; hope I never have a fan He was his own slave, his own slave, his own.. Fucked up values bruise all that I love They hurt you , they hurt you, they forced you to hide Watch them , their cultural suicide\n\n2.\n\nSunken Ship 03:30\n\nGrim faces and Grimm's fairytales Isn't it sad, a friendship gone stale? Let's find a sunken ship and sail home Another cup of tea won't do me any good The only time I speak I'm misunderstood The reason things are sad and beautiful is the same Layla When I'm far away I miss your human hum Part of me will vanish when your memories go numb Thank you for your time, your peace, your empathy Layla\n\n3.\n\nInto The Shadows 02:32\n\nThe young man walked into the sea To dive into a mystery The current carried him too deep And he was swollowed Into the darkness he was pulled Along his neck the serpents coiled But still a mystery there stood For him to follow If the waves carry him back home With all the secrets he'll return Unless he'd rather drown alone Into the shadows\n\n4.\n\nOver the 01:01\n\n5.\n\nhills 04:42\n\nPlease pass the moonlight in the jar I can't see through this dark forest far A world held together with ducktape I'm just another harmless mistake I can't fall asleep because I know what's on the other side Lost under the covers, it's the only place left to hide Between the dark sea and the night you can't tell where the world ends If they would take me away no one would notice Please pass the moonlight in the jar with broken wings you cant get very far I am walking in the mist When you fade away you wont be missed No where to go, Im hanging on the edge of here Be my cradle, crib, cage... Youre still wrapped up in the morning He has a heart that no one sees Are you here to take me back home Over the hills and far away Where the wild children go to play Over the hills and far away\n\n6.\n\nOn the Cycle 05:14\n\nThe River whispered to run to the rescue And love was the fabric of the all All... The wisewoman of my clan Said dont run away again I can see you, I can see you I can see you hurt Got two spirits trapped inside I know, im not the only one I can hear you I can hear you, At least were no alone All of the masks ive worn for this eternity Have caused my face to fade away Way... The wisewoman of my clan Said dont run away again I can see you, I can see you I can see you hurt Got two spirits trapped inside They clash and rage and love and burn. I can hear you I can hear you, At least were no alone Wanna see me, close your eyes Trust your sight and youll be blind Connections are the strings that bind the all The wisewoman of my clan Said dont run away again I can see you I can see you I can see you hurt I remember when I was you I could feel all that you do All the love and all the pain On the cycles turn...\n\n7.\n\nBroken Toys II 04:06\n\nOne time a kid loved us, then he grew up Oh we are the broken toys Loved one moment, then thrown away, By the girls and boys Got no place in history books Got no lasting home Faded to return to the plastic heap where we come from We're all made of the same material no one is special We chip and rust, then we get tossed A junkyard burial To be replaced, to be erased, lost in oblivion When our kid's no longer a kid A childhood hero's is gone. From the factory to the fire Our fate is one we bare All that matters was a time, A moment we hold dear For a moment we helped make a kid feel less alone For a moment we helped make a kid feel less alone\n\n8.\n\nFar From Home 03:09\n\nIt all goes to teach you faith I followed her across the face Of the earth just to make sure She wouldn't be alone No better place to go I'm far from home and Ill make sure we'll stay warm For a city that never sleep you have a lot of dreams Silent magic follows you Along with all our love for you You'll go where you belong Your ripples stay when youre gone Don't be scared, Ill be there I know the nightmares burn It all goes to teach you strength I followed her across the face Of the earth just to make sure I wouldnt be alone You could be whatever you wanted to be Remember the colors we couldnt see? Though, my friend, we couldnt sleep, We had a lot of dreams\n\n9.\n\nAn Unsuspecting Sperm 03:45\n\nCome and look at all the pretty things that I got I need all the things the TV tells me that I want Go to the grocery store and look at all the things youre made of Mostly mac & cheese, coca cola, chemicals and Ketchup I am the sum of my grocery list and all of my things will get me Nowhere... Go out to town and everyone is smiling People are so swell, everyone is happy, yeah... But they only smile cause theyre forced to, they wear masks of botox Wonder why it's okay for you to lie when you're a grown up Get away, your polite indifference is scaring me It will get you Nowhere... Thank you \"mr. god\", for putting me on this earth Thank you for the ride, and for my lovely birth What a miracle, yeah, such is life Just a piece of cake, a nice carnival ride But I'm not supposed to be here, I was an accident, a mistake My parents didn't want me, they were just bored drunk, or Fell in love or something.. and an unsuspecting sperm won the fucking race, And now I'm Nowhere\n\n10.\n\nLost on Borders 03:35\n\nI'm four years younger He's all dressed in green Solders come to take my brother Away from me As the wind shudders, Whereever you go, Just please come home Marching on As kids we looked toward The time we'd be called Remember, remember You're still a child And just take care 'cause Im not ready To meet your ghost Marching on How can they call it freedom Standing stained in blood They sacrifice all my brothers To kindle their burning world The northern wind stirs the spirits lost on borders The northern wind stirs the spirits lost on borders\n\n11.\n\nTo Die Alone 01:38\n\nGoodbye my friend, our season's at an end I'm lost in dreams, you're lost in time Dogs & old men run away to die alone\n\n12.\n\nDust 04:23"
