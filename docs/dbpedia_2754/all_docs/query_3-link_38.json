        "text": "The U.S. – México border is the area 100 kilometers or 62.5 miles, north and south of the international boundary. This area was defined by the La Paz Agreement La Paz Agreement (epa.gov) in 1983. The Texas border makes up about half of the U.S. – Mexico border, stretching 1,254 miles from the Gulf of México to El Paso.\n\nFour Mexican states share borders with the state of Texas. In order from the southeast coast to the northwest desert:\n\nTamaulipas\n\nNuevo León\n\nCoahuila\n\nChihuahua\n\nThe Texan border includes two federally recognized tribal nations, creating tri-national regions:\n\nKickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas near Eagle Pass\n\nYsleta del Sur Pueblo in El Paso\n\nSome binational sister-city communities along the Texas border are:\n\nBrownsville and Matamoros\n\nMcAllen and Reynosa\n\nRio Grande City and cities Miguel Alemán and Camargo\n\nLaredo and Nuevo Laredo\n\nEagle Pass and Piedras Negras\n\nDel Rio and Ciudad Acuña\n\nPresidio and Ojinaga\n\nEl Paso and Ciudad Juárez\n\nThe Texas border has a population of around 3 million residents. The population density is very different among the frontier, rural, and metropolitan areas.\n\nFor example, Kenedy County has 0.2 people per square mile while El Paso County has 874 people per square mile.\n\nIn Texas, compared to non-border region, the border region has lower infant mortality rates and less heart disease and stroke. Unfortunately, there are higher obesity, diabetes, cervical cancer, and caesarian section delivery rates. There's also more risk for certain contagious diseases such as tuberculosis and Zika. Many people lack access to primary, preventive, and specialty medical care.\n\nThe table below compares important factors in border and non-border areas of Texas.\n\nDemographics of Border and Non-Border Areas of Texas\n\nFactor Texas Border Texas Non-border Population size 2.8 million 27.7 million Population under 18 years of age 29% 25% Hispanic ethnicity 88% 35% Below poverty level 24% 16% Uninsured* 27% 17% Do not speak English very well 30% 12% At least a high school diploma 73% 86% Foreign-Born 24% 16%\n\nData sources: Population size from Texas Population Projections Program, October 2022 projections for 2024 with high migration scenario.
