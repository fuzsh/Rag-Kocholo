        "text": "For those who remember, “The Purple Hotel” ( the Hyatt located at Lincoln and Touhy in Lincolnwood), who have not seen what has taken place there, come on back! What was a hotel where “The Boys” hung out, is now a complex of homes and businesses at the edge of Lincolnwood, and very close to the city. One of the dining spots that has taken our area by storm, Fat Rosie’s Taco & Tequila Bar has planted its roots at 4504 , and tonight, Frank, Cary ,Jane and I went to visit her.\n\nThe story goes that Scott Harris, while in Mexico, met an Agave farmer with a pet donkey. The donkey had worked with the farmer in his fields for over 20 years. While to most people, they would say great, but this farmer treated Fat Rosie as if she was part of the family. The farmer and the donkey had bonded over the years. Scott admired what he saw: man and animal as a family, each loving and caring for the other. One night, over shots of tequila he promised the farmer that one day he would open a tequila bar and name it after the beloved donkey, and thus we have Fat Rosie.\n\nJane and I have visited the Lincolnshire location since it first opened, but to be honest, only had Tacos and burritos. Tonight, at the newest location, Lincolnwood, on the spot where once upon a time, there stood a Purple Hotel, we enjoyed a menu that will knock your sox off! We began our evening with drinks and several forms of guacamole. Chunky avocado mixed with mango, red onions, radish, microgreens served with banana chips! Morita Pineapple and the traditional Pico de Gallo- all tasty.\n\nThe fajita menu is divine: flat grilled red and yellow bell peppers, poblano peppers & red onions, served with rice and beans garnished with grilled cebollitas- we had chicken, steak and shrimp so we could mix and match.\n\nWe also shared some wonderful enchilada de mole filled with wood grilled chicken, covered in Oaxacan mole negro & melted queso Chihuahua, served with rice and beans. The empanadas de Carne were delicious. Mexican ground beef stuffed turnovers, served with tomatillo-avocado salsa, queso fresca and sliced radish.\n\nOur server, Sally was right on bringing us samples of almost each items on the menu. We enjoyed our appetizers, then the salad ( this was composed of the typical greens but with shrimp and calamari and just the perfect amount of dressing). The Ensalada Calamari Arajillo had garlic marinated calamari tossed with arugula, sauteed corn, fresno peppers & lime juice with Mojo de ajo “sweet garlic”- one of the best salads EVER!\n\nI watched as a giant burrito went by. I learned later that this is a 3 pound larger-than-life burrito stuffed with grilled steak, rice, beans, lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream, queso Chihuahua, french fries & avocado with habanero salsa. This is served with rice and beans. If you can eat in 12 minutes or less- it is FREE!\n\nWe were too busy enjoying our dinner to see if the gentleman was able to get his free.\n\nAs we dined, I thought of changing the words of a musical from “I Could Have Danced all Night” to “I Could Have Dined All Night”. We ate slowly, thanks to Sally making sure we finished each menu item before bringing the next. This allowed us to savor all the flavors of the kitchen. It is truly the best way to eat ethnic food.\n\nWhile we did not get into the taco menu ( quite huge) we did eat from all the categories allowing for meat, fish and poultry items. We enjoyed all the sauces and the MOLE was amazing. Before we got to dessert, Sally brought us ( with the help of General manager, George), a shot of tequila- smooth as a baby’s skin!\n\nOur desserts was made up of three items. Leche flan , Ice cream with Churros and small donuts (bunuelos) that were to die for!\n\nOur experience at this new Fat Rosie’s Tacos & Tequila Bar was one that will be remembered for a long time. I know that we will be going back as there are many more items to try. This location is very easy to get to-4504 West Touhy Avenue ( at Lincoln Avenue) just East of the Edens Expressway.\n\nThey are open :\n\nMonday-Thursdays 11:30 am- 9:30 p.m.\n\nFridays and Saturdays 11:30 am- 10 p.m.\n\nSundays 11 a.m.- 9 p.m.\n\nPhone number847-594-3100 plenty of free parking ( indoors)\n\nvisit www.fatrosies.com\n\nThey have locations in: Lincolnshire, Frankfort, Naperville and Schaumburg as well ( I think we will see more in time)."
