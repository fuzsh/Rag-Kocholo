        "text": "Original Solitaire\n\nGame info: Spider type; 2 decks (104 cards); no redeal\n\nGame time: Medium\n\nDifficulty level: Medium\n\nSkill level: Skill\n\nChance of winning: Low; about 1 in 15; 6.7%\n\nObject of the game: On the tableau, create eight suites of thirteen cards each, in a descending suit sequence from King to Ace.\n\nSolitaire Rules\n\nFoundations\n\nThe foundations are not built directly.\n\nThe 10 piles are tableau and foundations at the same time and all building is on the tableau.\n\nWhen a playable sequence (an entire suite of 13 cards) becomes exposed it is automatically moved to a foundation.\n\nThe game is won if all 8 sequences are discarded (when you discard the whole deck in 8 sequences and nothing is on the tableau).\n\nThe Joker\n\nWhenever the Joker becomes available, it may be played as a \"wild\" card.\n\nThe Joker can be moved as a single card to any tableau pile. Cards in correct sequence are then built on the Joker.\n\nThe Joker, no matter how deep it is in a column, can also be moved along with a suit sequence under or above it.\n\nTableau (Ten columns with six cards in the first four columns and five cards in the remaining ones. The top card of each column is face up.)\n\nBuild down regardless of suit (for example, a 5 can be played on a 6 ).\n\nThe top card of each pile is available for play on another tableau pile.\n\nCards of the same suit and in descending sequence may be moved as a unit to another pile (groups of cards not of the same suit cannot be moved).\n\nNothing can be placed on an Ace (a King cannot move, except to a blank space).\n\nSpaces may be filled with any available card or packed sequence.\n\nStock (Fifty cards)\n\nClick once on the stock to deal a new row of cards to the tableau.\n\nThere is no redeal.\n\nSimilar games\n\nSpider\n\nSpider Build and Play\n\nSpider Classic\n\nSpider Four Decks\n\nSpider One Suit\n\nSpider Reversed\n\nSpider Three Decks\n\nSpider Traditional\n\nSpider Two Suits\n\nSpider Two Suits Four Decks\n\nSpiderCell"
