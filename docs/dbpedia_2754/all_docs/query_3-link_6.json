        "text": "In the United States, Former President Donald Trump made worldwide headlines with his push to build a wall along the United States-Mexico border in order to keep out illegal immigrants. While many people have vocalized their opposition to the plan, the United States would not be the first nation to construct a wall along its border. Around the world, there are several nations that have border walls, fences, or barriers. These usually serve the purpose of controlling the border, keeping out illegal immigrants and preventing smuggling. Other nations use barriers when there are disputed or unclear borders.\n\nAs of December 2021, border walls are located in the following nations: North Korea and South Korea; Hong Kong; South Africa and Mozambique; Egypt; Kuwait and Iraq; Spain; Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan; South Africa; Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan; Uzbekistan and Afghanistan; Botswana and Zimbabwe; India; Saudi Arabia and Yemen; Brunei and Limbang; Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan; Bulgaria; Saudi Arabia and Iraq; Hungary; Macedonia, and Israel."
