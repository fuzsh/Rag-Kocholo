        "text": "Welcome to the beginning of an extraordinary new collectible series with No Borders Playing Cards. Each deck in this series is not just a tool for play; each edition is a piece of collectible art, designed to captivate and inspire.\n\nFollowing the triumph of our Victory Playing Cards, we've heard your calls for more borderless designs. In response, we've collaborated with our longtime friend, the talented Pedro Oyarbide, to bring you six unique, borderless back designs that blend practicality with unmatched Joker and the Thief style.\n\nThese decks are more than just a new offering; they're a response to our community's desire for functional, collectable, beautiful, and competitively priced playing cards. Be part of this exciting journey and help us turn these artistic visions into reality!\n\nGrand-Prix is a tribute to the timeless allure of racing, with a checkered pattern that speaks to both classic racing flags and a modern aesthetic. It's a tasteful celebration of automotive passion and competitive spirit, subtly infused with our brand's distinct character. This design stands as a symbol of precision and movement, inviting players to a game where every hand is a quiet echo of the racetrack's excitement.\n\nCutback is an exuberant homage to the carefree surfer's lifestyle, its design rich with the warm hues and rhythmic patterns reminiscent of the rolling waves and vibrant beach-scapes from Bali to Bondi. This deck is a celebration of the surf culture's soul and the art of play: spontaneous, lively, and boldly embracing life's ebb and flow both on the wave, and on the card table.\n\nThunderbolt is a dynamic evolution of the classic border design seen on the original Joker and the Thief decks reimagined into a striking, borderless pattern! The thunderbolt's sharp angles bring an energetic rhythm to the game, representing the almost electrical surge felt when holding a winning hand. This deck is a bold statement, a flash of creativity that embodies the spirit of those who choose to use Joker and the Thief cards and dare to play boldly!\n\nThe Honeycomb exudes a timeless elegance with its geometric precision, offering a sleek, classic aesthetic for the modern card enthusiast. Its design is purposefully clean and uncomplicated, ensuring a seamless integration into the daily routine of any discerning player. This deck stands as a paragon of practicality, designed to accompany its bearer from the quietest of reflections to the liveliest of gatherings.\n\nThe Crazy Back is a visual representation of the unpredictable and dynamic essence of the Joker and the Thief, key archetypes of our brand. Woven into an abstract tapestry, the words \"Joker\" and \"Thief\" forms a chaotic dance across the canvas, encapsulating the spirit of mischief and strategy. This design stands as a bold testament to the enigmatic nature of the game, inviting players to embrace the unexpected twists that each card may bring.\n\nEach deck features an identical tuck box with a viewing window on the back of the box to identify which deck is which.\n\nEach deck is complete with a perforated foil seal.\n\nEach deck features the same royal cards, ace of spades and Joker and Thief card.\n\nEach deck has a unique back design"
