It appears that other websites did re-publish this with the name of the Humane Society and the telephone number intact.\n\nThis led to the Humane Society getting crank calls from the public - which must have been irritating to say the least - we have enough problems in animal rescue without crank calls. So the message to anyone who wishes to circulate stories like this is - don't put real names or telephone numbers on them or they cease to be harmless entertainment and become a nuisance to people that are trying to do good with limited time and recourses.\n\nThanks to -\n\nThat'll Do Border Collie Rescue, Vancouver BC, Canada for making us aware."
