        "text": "August 6, 2020\n\nFantastic! I don't want to give out any spoilers but I loved the way Joker and Rosemary bicker and clash from the very beginning! You know that when they fall for each other, it's going to be delicious! Rosemary has found herself in a horrific dilemma and doesn't know how to get herself out. She has other women depending on her too. Will it happen? When she meets Joker, will she see past the constant joking and Tom Foolery? And what is with Rosemary wanting to become a Pinkerton Agent? Joker cannot believe it! She can't put herself in harm's way - he wont let her! But then, he doesn't have any say in it... Loved this book and the way Rosemary was such a strong, yet vulnerable woman. She and Joker were made for each other!\n\nAugust 12, 2020\n\n(3.5 stars) - Joker's kinda crazy\n\n[PTSD WARNING: THIS STORY REVOLVES AROUND SEX TRAFFICKING, WHILE NOT GRAPHIC IN DETAIL, SENSITIVE READERS MAY FIND IT TRIGGERING]\n\nRosemary responded to an offer for a mail order bride, but ends up accepting another man when she's stood up by her prospective groom at the train station. Unfortunately, her new intended actually just wants her for his collection of women to abuse, & she realizes that if she doesn't escape quickly, she's going to get an education that she might not survive - or want to\n\nThe story is pretty short, so things happen fast, but if you're like me & don't like drawn out suspense, that'll suit just fine.\n\nJoker's intro was kinda cringey. The overdone laughing was overmuch but the rolling around was edging too close into needs-a-psychiatrist territory. Thankfully that was short-lived. After that, he just seemed overly juvenile.\n\nWhen he discovers his connection to Rosemary, it shakes him up (as it should). At least, she helps stabilize him & he does some maturing - without having to give up his slightly weird sense of humor.\n\nWhile the rescue wasn't totally believable, it was fun & I enjoyed it\n\n*Clean romance level: passionate kisses, marriage bed talk, as well as sex trafficking & sexual menace\n\nAugust 22, 2020\n\nJokers Wild\n\nJoker was the nickname of a Pinkerton agent who loved to take down killers and people who broke the law. Joker had sent for a mail order bride only to leave her at the depot and then she was picked up my an outlaw who was picking up women and trading or selling them as whore to who ever wanted them. Rosemary was the bride left at the train depot and Espinosa saw her and took her to his cabin where he had seventeen other girls. Joker and his friend Jack showed up at the cabin and got Jacks wife free and then took care of the outlaws and brought the women back to his sisters inn. Rosemary went to the Pinkerton office and signed up to be a Pinkerton agent after she married Joker. This story has a lot of intrigue and hunting of slaves or women to be traded in Mexico. This is my review and mine alone. Norma Gorrill\n\nAugust 10, 2020\n\nRosemary and Joker's story was full of intense moments. Rosemary arrives to become a Mail-order bride, but her Groom doesn't show up. So Rosemary takes up with the first man that shows interest. Unfortunately, it's a big mistake and she ends up in a human trafficking ring with other women. Joker is her rescuer and becomes her husband. Joker is a Pinkerton Agent and uses his bride as bait to catch the sleazy head of the human trafficking ring. I did enjoy the book, but craved Rosemary giving the sleaze a good swift kick in the gut or beating him with the butt of a gun like she had to endure. If you like clean stories about Pinkerton Agents, you want go wrong with 'Joker's Wild'. I received this book from the publisher. The thoughts and comments are my own.\n\nSeptember 6, 2020\n\nThis was another cute book! Not quite as good as some of the others I've read by Ginny, but still a cute read! Rosemary had headed to Texas as a mail-order bride. She didn't know she was being used as bait! After she's rescued, she decides to join the Pinkertons. She's paired with Joker, the man who originally asked her to come to Texas. The second time she's taken, can she rely on Joker to save her? Joker didn't mean to hurt anyone, he just wanted to catch his man, and figured a jilted bride would be a good plan. When he meets Rosemary, he realizes he wants to protect her. When they marry and she becomes his Pinkerton partner, will he lose his heart? Good read!!\n\nI received a complimentary copy of this book, was not required to leave a review, and the opinion expressed is my own.\n\nOctober 9, 2021\n\nThe Empress and her Joker\n\nRosemary gets stood up by her mail order groom, and is almost immediately taken in by a smooth talking gentleman who promises her the moon. Although, he’s not a gentleman, but a sex trafficker.\n\nJoaquin, who is known as Joker, is a Pinkerton. He saves Rosemary as well as all the other women held hostage.\n\nI would have given this five stars, but oh mylanta! I could not hardly tolerate Rosemary! Joker rescues her and the others from further abuse, and she snaps him every few minutes? What was her problem? I really did not like her at all. Thankfully, she redeemed herself at the end.\n\nAugust 8, 2020\n\nThis Pinkerton Agent story is REALLY different than most. Rosemary goes to Abilene as a mail order bride but is abandoned by her \"groom\". Martin Espinoza persuades her to take him on and she soon learns to regret. Joker sort of \"accidentally\" rescues her . They squabble constantly, but soon realize they are attracted to each other. This is a fast moving, action packed story\n\nApril 25, 2023\n\nJoker’s Wild\n\nAnother short story taking place in the Wild West. This book is action packed and deals with mail order brides being taken for trafficking purposes. When Pinkerton Agent known as Joker rescues a house full of kidnapped mail order brides, he did not expect to end up married one of them.\n\nSeptember 6, 2020\n\nGood book\n\nThis book was exciting from the first to the last! I loved the sassy characters. It actually had a story and there wasn't swearing, or any pornography. My kind of book!\n\nSeptember 14, 2020\n\nThis Was Different\n\nIf you enjoy a quirky hero, this romance is for you. Be aware that although t are few graphic details, this story starts with a scene involving women who have been abused. The author handled it well, and created a heroine who was strong and competent enough to get her and others out of a fix--thanks to the joker. A good read.\n\nJune 9, 2023\n\nJoker!\n\nIf you read the Pinkerton series, \"Agent for...\" this is the sequel or follows the story of an Agent for Meghen. I really enjoyed this super fast, well written story. Lots of adventure, you love Joker and are cheering Rosemary on from the beginning.\n\nAugust 12, 2020\n\nHolder's Wild (Border Brides Book 9)\n\nThis is the ninth book in the series and it is about a young woman that finds love with a Pinkerton\n\nAugust 25, 2020\n\nI enjoyed reading this book! I recommend this book to anyone who likes western romance."
