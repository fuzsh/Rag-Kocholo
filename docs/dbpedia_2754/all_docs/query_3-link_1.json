        "text": "A border is a real or artificial line that separates geographic areas. Borders are political boundaries. They separate countries, states, provinces, counties, cities, and towns. A border outlines the area that a particular governing body controls. The government of a region can only create and enforce laws within its borders .\n\nBorders change over time. Sometimes the people in one region take over another area through violence. Other times, land is traded or sold peacefully. Many times, land is parceled out after a war through international agreements.\n\nSometimes, borders fall along natural boundaries like rivers or mountain ranges. For example, the boundary between France and Spain follows the crest of the Pyrenees mountains. For part of its length, the boundary between the United States and Mexico follows a river called the Rio Grande. The borders of four countries divide Africaâs Lake Chad: Niger, Chad, Cameroon, and Nigeria.\n\nBorders âparticularly national borders âaffect travel and migration. People can usually move freely within their own countryâs borders , but may not be allowed to cross into a neighboring country .\n\nWhen neighboring countries have similar wealth and political systems, their borders may be open and undefended. For example, citizens of the 27- country European Union may travel freely among any of the member states . Only five EU membersâBulgaria, Cyprus, Ireland, Romania, and the United Kingdomârequire travelers from other EU states to present a passport or ID card at the border .\n\nOn the opposite extreme, the Korean Demilitarized Zoneâthe border between communist North Korea and democratic South Koreaâis the most heavily militarized border in the world. The zone, which is 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) wide and 243 kilometers (151 miles) long, separates the two countries with barbed-wire fences, land mines, and armed guards. Citizens of most countries must have a passport and official permission to enter the borders of North Korea. North Koreans must also have official permission before they leave the secretive nation .\n\nEvery country has its own rules about who may travel , work, and reside within its borders . Visas and work permits are government documents issued to non- citizens that limit the type of work or travel they may do in the country , and for how long. The United States issues âgreen cardsââofficially known as permanent resident cardsâthat allow non-Americans to live and work inside the borders of the U.S. and be protected by its laws.\n\nBorder Protection\n\nMost countries have some sort of military or law-enforcement presence along their borders . Countries protect their borders for several reasons. One is to keep out invaders. This is especially true in areas where two or more countries have fought over the same land for many years. Cambodia and Thailand, for example, have disputed the territory of the Preah Vihear Temple for more than a century. Cambodian and Thai military units are positioned along the border near Preah Vihear Temple, and skirmishes often result in deaths on both sides.\n\nSometimes, borders serve to keep citizens in. Most governments with these âclosed bordersâ are not democratic . In addition to North Korea, nations such as Myanmar and Cuba rarely allow their residents to cross their borders .\n\nBorders can also serve to protect resources. Sometimes, the borders of U.S. congressional districts protect ethnic, religious, or economic communities. Citizens within these borders often vote as a unit, based on shared political beliefs. The areaâs representative in the U.S. House of Representatives must be a ware of the interests within his or her districtâs borders . The concerns of a representative from the urban area of St. Louis, Missouri, for instance, are less likely to be issues affecting farmers than a representative from rural Missouri, which is dominated by agriculture. The representative from rural Missouri would be less likely to be concerned with issues surrounding public transportation, which is much more common in cities.\n\nBorder Disputes\n\nMany border disputes occur when people fight over natural resources . For instance, Sudan and Egypt have quarreled for decades over a region called Halaâib. This triangle of land along the Red Sea is rich in the mineral manganese, which is essential to iron and steel production. It is also used as an additive in unleaded gasoline. The Sudanese government claims the land rightfully belongs to Sudan, but it currently belongs to Egypt.\n\nMany times, political borders divide groups of people who share a common religion, culture, ancestry, or language. The border between North Korea and South Korea, for example, is a purely political one; the Korean people share a united history, culture , and language . The nation of Germany was divided between East Germany and West Germany from 1949-1989. Like the Korean border , this was a purely political division, between the democratic West and the communist East. Germany reunified in 1990, and the border disappeared.\n\nMany times, one ethnic group wishes to break off and form its own, independent state . This can lead to civil war.\n\nThe area of southeastern Europe on the Balkan Peninsula (known as the Balkans ) has a long history of ethnic conflict and disputed borders . The country of Yugoslavia was created from many small political units after World War I. After World War II, Yugoslavia became a communist country under Marshal Josip Broz Tito. Despite Yugoslavia âs many different languages , cultures , and religions , Tito and his successors were able to maintain a stable nation until the fall of communism in the early 1990s.\n\nAfter the fall of communism, however, democratic movements swept central and eastern Europe. Autocratic rulers were unable to maintain power. In the Balkans , ancient feuds began to resurface. Bosnians, Serbs, Croats, Macedonians, and Slovenians began vying for control of the region . Even within these national groups, ethnic or religious minorities pursued independence: Bosnian Serbs sought independence from Bosnia, while citizens of the Kosovo region sought independence based on their Muslim identity. The area that used to be Yugoslavia now consists of seven countries: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. The crimes surrounding the border disputes between these countries are so numerous and graphic that an entire court in the Inter national Criminal Court is devoted to them: the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY)."
