Created in 1953, the Korean Demilitarized Zone is the most militarized zone and border in the world.\n\nIn Europe, Vatican City, which is surrounded by Italy, is the smallest country in the world covering just 0.2 square miles.\n\nJust like Vatican City, San Marino is another nation that is surrounded by Italy. The country covers an area of just 24 square miles and comprises a population of roughly 33,000.\n\nThe only country that Ireland shares its borders with is the United Kingdom. Similarly, the United Kingdom also shares land borders only with Ireland.\n\nThe Scandinavian country, Denmark shares its borders with Germany.\n\nSaudi Arabia is the only country with which Qatar shares its border.
