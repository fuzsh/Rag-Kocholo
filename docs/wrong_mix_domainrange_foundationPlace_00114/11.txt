So if any of you frequent the water cooler you will have seen my post ( http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/528088-the-1-challenge ) on raising charity money. But I have a question closer to home to ask all of you. I have the chance to set up “an event” that has no overhead cost, but needs marketing. Basically how it works is a pub is willing to sponsor the event, and offer something like a free drink, door prize that kind of think but I would need to sell tickets. 100% of the sale price goes to the cause. Now here is my question for locals: can you think of a way/place where I could sell tickets, on short order, for a random party/pub?

I would offer it to the people I work with but the “pub scene” isn’t exactly what the office is into, and we are a small place so to really make this work out I’d need to somehow grab random people on the street.

I haven’t decided if I’m doing it yet, but if any of you have an idea I could borrow/steal on how to sell tickets I just might go for it. Right now I cannot think of a way that might have a fair chance of success.
