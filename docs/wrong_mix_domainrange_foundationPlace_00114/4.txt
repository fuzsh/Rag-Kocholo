I'm honored and excited to be on the Governing Board of the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)! OpenSSF brings together two passions of mine, open source software and security, and I look forward to collaborating with the other elected representatives and the community in 2024. #devsecops #opensourcesoftware #security
