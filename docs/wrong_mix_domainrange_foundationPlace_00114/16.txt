Right there with ya brother! Here is today’s PNW Smoke map (upper right hand corner, select HMS Smoke Plumes). I’m in the hazardous purple triangle in Southern Oregon. Honestly, we have been socked in for a month now and it’s depressing. Sinus headaches, I miss my daily walks, businesses are suffering and I dread changing the air filters on the cars - layers of soot daily. There was a fire so close, we were in a level 2 area (be ready for evacuation). 2nd year in a row. We’re in the Rogue Valley - hills to the left and right so the smoke just collects.

Though this is not a pleasant event by any means, I am thankful that I know that it will clear up soon enough. People in other countries wakes up to this everyday of their life with barely any chance of it clearing up at all.

So… this article came across my news feed:

Worst in the world: Edmonton took dubious honour in air quality rankings | CBC News

Out of 85 cities world wide… we had the worst air quality. And it isn’t anything we did. Just happens there are 560+ wildfires in BC and the wind… sorta pushed it this way.

What dubious honor has your city/town/office received lately. Or not so lately?

That or post cute pictures. Because, cute.
