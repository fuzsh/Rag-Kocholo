If the people causing the overages have managers bring it up to them. If the boss is their manager show hime the policy that is in place and ask him if you should throw it out the window or enforce it. Don’t be a door mat as people will tend to take advantage because they know they can. Your phone provider should be able to send alerts when folks are going over. Have you thought of looking at pooled minutes for all company phones?\n\nDepending on where you are the economy isn’t so bad.\n\nNext time he says something stupid to you, move forward towards him till you are about 18\" from his face. Just stare at him, but keep a smile on your face. If he says anything, or ask anything, just stare, tilt your head sideways and answer the question politely.\n\nIt’s ok to blink, but don’t look away. After he is done berating you - look at him and say these words: “I need your advice on something”. This empowers him and might make him believe that you feel his opinion or advice on something might matter. Ask him how he would have handled the situation that he berated you on (not in those words).\n\nWhen you make someone feel important, and they believe you are sincere, you will be surprised on how they act or treat you.\n\nI worked for a tyrant (old ex-military Eastern European) boss once-upon-a-time… it was one of those “desperation” type jobs that you take just to fill the gaps until something better comes along… this guy was a piece of work. He literally asked co-workers if they wanted to go outside and scrap… (he was 6 foot 3 ish… possibly 260-280 lbs)… he also got wind of some naked pictures one of the female sales reps had shared with one of the male sales reps, and he forced the male sales rep to share the photos with him… His favorite saying was “If you don’t like it, take your shoes and go!” hmmm WTF… of course I’ll take my shoes!\n\nI lasted 2 years until he finally decided to direct his BS in my direction… over an OEM sticker a customer had dropped in the parking lot, that I did not notice (umm I don’t hang out in the parking lot… I work behind the counter here, servicing PCs)… he tried his best to yell at me and blame me… I basically erupted in a store full of employees and customers and told him where to go, and how to get there, using every colorful 4 letter word that came to mind. I knew I wasn’t coming back. I took my shoes and left. I was the service manager at the time. Not long after that Alberta Corporate and Consumer Affairs starting investigating their shady sales practices, and both locations (Calgary where I worked and Edmonton) were closed down… karma?\n\nAnyway… I won’t say I handled it the best… I bit my tongue and bit my tongue, and then exploded (after 2 years)… but I will say I had no regrets, making $10 an hour at the time I wasn’t about to put up with abuse on top of poverty… so while I don’t always recommend it, I was young enough to just remove them from my resume all-together and carry on… onward and upward… and… well I have to say … the look of shock on his face from being told off, still makes me smile.\n\nMaybe… don’t bite your tongue until it erupts… would be my small bit of wisdom.\n\nFirst, actively look for employment elsewhere - it’s worth sacrificing your small free time to escape a hostile work environment.\n\nSecond, talk to him about his treatment of you and how you don’t appreciate it. When doing this, it’s important to address it in the appropriate tone. You need to speak in a confident, self-assured manner, but try not to be hostile. If you come off as meek or unsure, he won’t really listen and respect your voice, but if you attack him (verbally, of course), it has the potential to make things much worse.\n\nThird, document anything that you see as bullying. I’m not aware of Canada’s laws on the matter, but some places have laws to protect employees from harassment/bullying. You may have a legal case against him. While that may sound intimidating, it may be the only option to protect yourself, your co-workers, and anyone who may fill your spot once you leave."
