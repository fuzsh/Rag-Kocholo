But I have a question closer to home to ask all of you. I have the chance to set up “an event” that has no overhead cost, but needs marketing. Basically how it works is a pub is willing to sponsor the event, and offer something like a free drink, door prize that kind of think but I would need to sell tickets. 100% of the sale price goes to the cause. Now here is my question for locals: can you think of a way/place where I could sell tickets, on short order, for a random party/pub?\n\nI would offer it to the people I work with but the “pub scene” isn’t exactly what the office is into, and we are a small place so to really make this work out I’d need to somehow grab random people on the street.\n\nI haven’t decided if I’m doing it yet, but if any of you have an idea I could borrow/steal on how to sell tickets I just might go for it. Right now I cannot think of a way that might have a fair chance of success."
