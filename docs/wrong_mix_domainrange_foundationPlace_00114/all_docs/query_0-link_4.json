        "text": "Today in History:\n\nJune 14, 1822\n\nCharles Babbage, a renowned mathematician and inventor, presented a paper to the Royal Astronomical Society. In this paper, he unveiled his design for a revolutionary machine - the Difference Engine.\n\nThe Difference Engine was the first example of a mechanical computing machine. It was a marvel of its time, showcasing Babbage’s ingenuity and foresight. The British government, recognizing the potential of such a device, funded the building of the Difference Engine.\n\nHowever, despite the support, Babbage never actually completed the construction of the Difference Engine. But this did not diminish the impact of his innovative design. The Difference Engine, along with his later Analytical Engine, spurred future designs of working mechanical computers. These machines laid the groundwork for the modern computing systems we use today.\n\nInterestingly, in 1991, a working Difference Engine was constructed using Babbage’s original plans. This endeavor proved that Babbage’s designs were not only innovative but also functional.\n\nRead More\n\nAlso of interest on June 14th\n\n1900 – Hawaii becomes a United States territory.\n\n1949 – Albert II, a rhesus monkey, rides a V-2 rocket to an altitude of 134 km (83 mi), thereby becoming the first mammal and first monkey in space.\n\n1951 – UNIVAC I is dedicated by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n1959 – Disneyland Monorail System, the first daily operating monorail system in the Western Hemisphere, opens to the public in Anaheim, California.\n\n1962 – The European Space Research Organisation is established in Paris – later becoming the European Space Agency.\n\n1967 – Mariner program: Mariner 5 is launched towards Venus.\n\n1986 – The Mindbender derails and kills three riders at the Fantasyland (known today as Galaxyland) indoor amusement park at West Edmonton Mall in Edmonton, Alberta.\n\n1994 – The 1994 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot occurs after the New York Rangers defeat the Vancouver Canucks to win the Stanley Cup, causing an estimated C$1.1 million, leading to 200 arrests and injuries.\n\n2002 – Near-Earth asteroid 2002 MN misses the Earth by 75,000 miles (121,000 km), about one-third of the distance between the Earth and the Moon.\n\nBirths on This Day\n\n1903 – Alonzo Church, American mathematician and logician (d. 1995)\n\n1909 – Burl Ives, American actor and singer (d. 1995)\n\n1929 – Johnny Wilson, Canadian-American ice hockey player and coach (d. 2011)\n\n1961 – Boy George, English singer-songwriter and producer\n\n1969 – Éric Desjardins, Canadian ice hockey player and coach\n\n1972 – Matthias Ettrich, German computer scientist and engineer, founded KDE\n\n1973 – Sami Kapanen, Finnish-American ice hockey player and manager\n\n1978 – Steve Bégin, Canadian ice hockey player\n\n1986 – Matt Read, Canadian ice hockey player\n\n1987 – Andrew Cogliano, Canadian ice hockey player\n\nDeaths on This Day\n\n1907 – William Le Baron Jenney, American architect and engineer, designed the Home Insurance Building (b. 1832)\n\n1949 – Albert II, rhesus macaque, animal astronaut, and first mammal in space\n\n1977 – Alan Reed, American actor, original voice of Fred Flintstone (b.1907)\n\n1980 – Charles Miller, American saxophonist and flute player (b. 1939)\n\n1994 – Henry Mancini, American composer and conductor (b. 1924)\n\n2014 – Isabelle Collin Dufresne, French actress (b. 1935)\n\n2016 – Ann Morgan Guilbert, American actress and singer (b. 1928)\n\nHolidays Today\n\nJune 14th (nationaltoday.com)\n\nThe Funnies:\n\nAI Contribution of the Day:\n\nCopilot\n\nSure, here’s a classic recipe for a Bourbon Old Fashioned:\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 sugar cube (or 1/2 teaspoon of simple syrup)\n\n2-3 dashes of bitters\n\n2 ounces of bourbon\n\n1 orange peel slice\n\n1 maraschino cherry\n\nIce cubes\n\nInstructions:\n\nDrop the sugar cube into an old fashioned glass\n\nAdd dashes of bitters and a teaspoon of water\n\nMuddle until the sugar is fully dissolved\n\nPlace the ice cubes in the glass\n\nPour the bourbon into the glass\n\nGently stir\n\nExpress the glass with an orange peel slice before adding it as garnish\n\nAdd a maraschino cherry for garnish\n\nEnjoy your Bourbon Old Fashioned!

I can grill, but I can’t cook so everything I have been eating comes out of the microwave. I have cleaning, laundry, and yard work to do. I can do all the chores, but being disabled, it is harder to do. It will be a loooong weekend."
