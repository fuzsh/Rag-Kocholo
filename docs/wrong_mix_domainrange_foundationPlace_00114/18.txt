I’m on my way to becoming a versatile meshing expert with Pointwise. Structured, unstructured, overset, hybrid…you name it, and I’ll discretize it for you with hexahedra, tetrahedra, pyramids, prisms, etc…all in Pointwise!

I grew up in rural eastern Oregon, studied Aerospace Engineering, and ultimately graduated with an M.S. degree before joining Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works division in Fort Worth, TX. At Lockheed, I worked on active/passive flow control technology development for applications relating to propulsion integration such as inhibiting boundary layer separation in serpentine inlet ducts and exploring yaw vector control through fluidic injection inside of nozzles. A couple of years later I was transferred within the organization to their Palmdale, CA facility in what I refer to as my classified box in the Mojave Desert where I spent the next eight years doing “stuff.”

In 2010 I moved on to General Atomics Aeronautical Systems in San Diego, CA to provide propulsion integration and CFD expertise for their uninhabited Predator C prototype aircraft before joining Rescale—a startup company in San Francisco, CA whose cloud-based web application caters to engineers and scientists with high performance computing needs. This past April I returned here to Fort Worth, TX to work with Pointwise’s Sales & Marketing team.

One word that best describes how you work: Perceptive

What software or tools do you use every day?

I’ve primarily been using Pointwise every day since I hit the ground running this past April in order to hone my skills against a variety of meshing applications and exercise Pointwise’s extensive capabilities. I also use Outlook and Spark for correspondence and collaboration. For my preference towards command line driven interfaces, I’ve installed Cygwin where I can navigate around the file system and network while editing files with vim, sed, and awk. Lastly, I have a program which I wrote, and run in the background, to help me keep track of how much time I have spent towards any given task.

What does your workspace look like?

I’ve taken up residence in one of Pointwise’s offices in Fort Worth which has apparently been the office of a few other current and former employees, so it has a lot of history associated with it that I’m still working to uncover. It includes not one, but two windows which is important since I’ve spent the majority of my career thus far in a classified box out in the Mojave Desert. Asides from the windows, it has a pretty substantial bookcase, a corner desk, and two other desks that provide a few different options for where I’m going to sit on any given day.

What are you currently working on?

I’ve been working diligently towards gaining some proficiency with Pointwise. As a former user of Gridgen and a few other CFD preprocessing related software tools (e.g. GridTool, ICEM, ANSA, Chimera Grid Tools), Pointwise’s learning curve has been by far the most seamless. Part of the reason for this is due to how the entities within Pointwise (i.e. connectors, domains, blocks, etc.) are consistently used throughout the software regardless if you are creating a multi-block structured mesh, overset mesh, unstructured mesh, or hybrid mesh.

The ability within Pointwise to create these various types of meshes and export the results to a wide selection of different solver-specific file formats ensures that diverse engineering teams can effectively collaborate and share their meshing strategies collectively for an assortment of meshing applications. Further, these capabilities provide some insurance that the computational meshes that are expertly created—and the time invested in generating them—aren’t wasted in case an organization opts to change solvers for any number of reasons (e.g. cost, support, etc.). Most preprocessors only support proprietary mesh formats which restrict their use to specific solvers; thereby, limiting their utility.

Here’s a look at some of the meshes I’ve created over the past few weeks with no prior Pointwise experience:

What would you say is your meshing specialty?

As with several others here at Pointwise, I set out on my professional career with the propulsion integration CFD group at Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics Company right here in Fort Worth, TX where users primarily used Gridgen for multi-block structured meshes (with both point-matched and non-matching interfaces) in conjunction with Lockheed’s Falcon solver and FieldView. They say your past shapes your future, and I’m definitely more inclined towards creating multi-block structured meshes for their cell count efficiency and prevailing accuracy in comparison to unstructured meshes.

Any tips for our users?

In my short time here I have discovered a wealth of resources that range from case studies, best meshing practices, how-to videos, tutorials, workshops, current events in CFD, and so forth that prospective, new, and experienced Pointwise users can leverage to become more familiar with the software and its comprehensive list of features. I would advocate that users set aside some time to explore the resources available on our website and reference them often as needed. Links to the various resources are listed below for convenience.

Secondly, customers shouldn’t hesitate to reach out to our technical experts here at Pointwise with any specific questions they may have related to their ongoing meshing projects. Let us demonstrate how to accomplish a given task with your specific project in a screen sharing session so you can quickly resolve any issues or have any questions answered pertaining to your current meshing task in real-time.

What project are you most proud of and why?

Given my short tenure at Pointwise thus far, I would probably say I’ve become pretty good at using the keyboard shortcuts within Pointwise and continue to expand my abilities in this regard. Perhaps I could work on an app that quizzes your knowledge of all the Pointwise Accelerators to help customers commit them to memory. It’s all about the little things…

In addition to the other meshes that have already been depicted, I also wrapped a multi-block structured mesh around a louver used for ventilation between walls. This normally would be an extremely tedious structured meshing task, but Pointwise helps expedite building these meshes with its built-in copy, paste, and transform capabilities.

What CFD solver and postprocessor do you use most often?

I typically use FUN3D and ParaView most frequently. As I mentioned, I used FieldView quite a lot in the past; although, I haven’t had access to a license recently—do we have one lying around somewhere? Anyone?

I also use both SU2 and PyFR solvers on occasion as they continue to mature. Both development teams are active in advancing the state-of-the art in CFD while helping to democratize CFD tools and making them more accessible for everyone.

Are you reading any interesting technical papers we should know about?

I’ve primarily been absorbing everything related to meshing recently which has included some of Dr. Steve Karman’s work with parallelization for large scale Octree mesh generation, Dr. John Steinbrenner’s work on construction of prism and hex layers from anisotropic tetrahedra (both will be presented at AIAA’s 2015 Aviation conference), and John Chawner’s post on Pointwise’s Another Fine Mesh blog titled Accuracy, Convergence and Mesh Quality from a few years ago.

Do you plan on attending any conferences or workshops this year?

I’ll be at AIAA’s Aviation conference from June 21st through June 26th with the rest of the Pointwise team, and I’m looking forward to all of the events we have planned for our prospective and current users including the Let’s Talk Meshing session scheduled for Sunday, 21st June, the reception afterwards, and meeting everyone at our booth Tuesday through Thursday.

What do you do when you’re not generating meshes?

I’ve been a distance runner for almost my entire life, and while I don’t run competitively anymore, I still enjoy getting out and stretching my legs now and again; though, I’m still re-acclimating to the humidity and summer temperatures here in Fort Worth. I also picked up golf as an opportunity to see some sort of greenery while outside of my classified box in the Mojave Desert. It’s grown on me in the years since, and I can definitely appreciate the persistence that professionals of the game must practice to make everything seem simple.

What is some of the best CFD advice you’ve ever received?

Today’s CFD tools are much more streamlined for users than they once were. The underlying models have become a lot more removed, or abstracted away, from new or novice users. Users often run the risk of coupling a poorly crafted mesh with inappropriate solver settings with their simulations. These missteps affect even more experienced users who may be limited in the amount of time they have available for completing an analysis. In either situation, today’s robust generalized flow solvers will likely converge to an answer that may be non-physical or misrepresent the intended flow problem entirely. It’s important that CFD practitioners have a full understanding and complete mastery of the tools that they’re using in order to leverage them correctly and provide meaningful results.

Furthermore, sometimes the 80% answer (a.k.a. back-of-the-envelope or first-order solution) is enough, and expensive simulation isn’t always necessary. It’s invaluable to be well-versed in both the physics relating to the flow problem in addition to the appropriate CFD numerics or best-practices to determine when one is a more favored and valuable approach in any given situation.

If you had to pick a place to have dinner, where would you go?

Either Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil would both be at the top of my favorites list which is fortunate now that both are nearby once more.

Have you ever been to the Idaho Potato Museum? If not, you should go. They’ll give you a free potato at the end of the tour…or at least they used to. I’ve been there several times. The museum sits in my hometown of Blackfoot, Idaho.

It was back home where I became a pilot and where I spent all my free time bumming around the local airport working on airplanes. Next, I moved to Arlington, Texas where I ended up studying Aerospace Engineering at The University of Texas at Arlington. Before receiving my bachelor’s degree in 2009, I worked as a Quality Assurance Engineer on the Boeing 787 program at Vought Aircraft. The following spring, as I wrapped up my junior year, I was offered an internship at Pointwise on the Technical Support team. I took it immediately.

I spent my first summer at Pointwise working with Carolyn Woeber, the manager of our support team. At the time I was responsible for the functional testing of Gridgen and one of the earlier releases of Pointwise. During the summer I learned enough about grid generation to be productive and knew that I’d be doing CFD from then on.

After receiving my bachelor’s degree I started my second internship at Pointwise, this time on the Sales & Marketing team as an applications engineer working with Chris Sideroff. Chris now distributes and supports our software in Canada. I meshed, and meshed, and meshed, every day, all day, all summer. In just a few months I had generated meshes for geometries in nearly every application area where we have a customer. I was hooked.

I continued working as an intern at Pointwise throughout graduate school. During that time I was working mornings at Pointwise, taking a full course load in the afternoons at UTA, and spending my nights in the CFD lab performing vertical axis wind turbine design optimization. As an intern at that time I helped support the sales process and generated content for webinars, videos, and articles. Most of my original work is still floating around our website.

Just before I wrapped up my master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering at UTA in 2011, I was offered a full time position with Pointwise as a Senior Engineer on the Sales & Marketing team. Since then I’ve been heavily involved in the production of our technical marketing content and sales process.

My primary area of responsibility is new sales. In order to sell our software, I work closely with prospective customers to help strengthen their CFD process by introducing them to Pointwise. Often an engineer will contact us with a meshing problem and it’s my responsibility to determine if Pointwise is the right fit for their application and help them discover the solution throughout a fully supported evaluation. This is a very technical process and one where I’m always learning about new CFD applications and challenges.

One word that best describes how you work: Wholeheartedly

What software or tools do you use every day?

I live in Outlook. Supporting everyone who is thinking about evaluating Pointwise and those currently working an evaluation means I’m reaching out to potential customers, working with system administrators on installation, fielding technical questions with engineers, and discussing terms and prices with buyers. I work hard to achieve inbox zero by the end of the day because that means I was able to help everyone who reached out to me.

Google Chrome is my window into all our online and web accessible content. I use Chrome to access and manage our Glyph script exchange on GitHub. Throughout the day I’ll look for any Pointwise or meshing questions that arrive via CFD Online. I use TweetDeck to monitor various feeds and tweet events and other CFD related content. Our YouTube page is where we host all our video content and I’m actively uploading new videos and responding to comments. We use YouTrack to log feature requests and bugs in our software, so I keep an eye on that and log any requests that come from discussions with any clients I’m working with. Our internal wiki provides a ton of useful information and is where we work with our developers to define the requirements for new features. I’m currently working on a couple new feature requirements that I can’t wait to share with you! But most of my time spent in Chrome is working with Sage CRM, our customer relationship management software where I track all incoming evaluation requests, quotation requests, and those evaluating the software.

Throughout the day I’ll use Pidgin to chat with my coworkers. A quick message can save a phone call or an email. I use vim when writing or editing Glyph scripts and Cygwin to access my remote Linux workstation to run CFD calculations or generate large meshes. The Microsoft Office suite of tools such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, no matter how hard I try to find alternatives, keep me productive. I record a lot of videos including webinars, in-depth meshing videos, and tutorials for #TutorialTuesday. Camtasia makes it easy to capture my screen so I can produce content and get it online quickly. And it goes without saying, but I use Pointwise every single day.

There are two more tools I use that I couldn’t do my job without: GoToMeeting and the phone. GoToMeeting has become such an important part of my job that I can’t imagine working without it. When someone would like to see Pointwise in action, or show me something they’re working on and get feedback, in about a minute I can have a meeting up and running. Often one GoToMeeting session will save an entire day’s worth of email, and I can record it and send it to the client. The phone is similar in that a single phone call can save time, it’s more personal, and allows us to escape the computer for a few minutes.

What does your workspace look like?

I’ve moved around our building a lot. I worked in two different conference rooms during my internships, spent a summer in our server room running CFD calculations, worked for about a year in a corner, then an office, and now a corner office. I have a great view of downtown Fort Worth, three large desks, a couple bookshelves, and a plant.

I like to make wherever I’m working comfortable, and by that I mean cluttered with little gizmos and fun stuff. I’ve amassed a small collection of bobble heads against my will and a few really nice aircraft models. Some of the more fun stuff sits on my desk. The Useless Machine provides a lot of entertainment and they have a great return policy—if you don’t find it completely useless, return it for a full refund. Last year I assembled the Strandbeest kit by Gakken and it’s earned a permanent place on my desk. My wife is a Research Scientist at the University of Texas at Arlington’s Research Institute (UTARI) and works in the Biomedical Technologies group. While working on a project involving casting, she made a cast of her hand, which she painted green, and which I stole and proudly display on my desk. I get a kick out of the awkward stares when customers drop by to chat. My wife is very creative and has contributed a number of laser cut wood models to my collection.

What are you currently working on?

A lot of things. I get anxious when I’m not working, so I always have something to do. Most of the work I do is in support of those evaluating Pointwise. I can’t reveal specifics, but what I can say is that during any given week I could be meshing an automotive geometry, a full aircraft, a turbine blade, writing a Glyph script to automate part or all of a meshing process, making a video to demonstrate a particular feature or workflow, or running a CFD calculation to validate a particular meshing strategy. When someone commits to an evaluation, I’m 100% all in to help them discover Pointwise and offer the same level of support they can expect once they become a customer.

Lately I’ve been working on the DrivAer, a realistic external automotive geometry proposed by the Institute of Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics at the Technische Universität München. Often automotive geometry is extremely complex, and the DrivAer is no different with over 15,000 unique surfaces. Working with others in this industry I’ve found that a lot of engineers use discrete automotive models (STLs) and meshing algorithms that are tuned for surface wrapping. The difficulty with this approach is that discrete geometry can degrade accuracy and lacks the topological information that analytic models can provide. However, to take advantage of analytic models coming from CAD requires geometry cleanup and robust meshing strategies. Our goal with this project has been to demonstrate such strategies and best practices for cleaning complex analytic CAD often encountered in the automotive industry and automatically generate boundary layer resolved grids. The project has been successful and we’ll be presenting this work coupled with shape deformation and optimization at the 10th OpenFOAM Workshop.

I’ve been involved with our webinars and videos since we started producing them back in 2010. I began by producing only the technical content, then drove the software while others presented, and now I organize and produce our webinars with a customer and/or a software partner. Pointwise webinars give people the opportunity to see the software being used in the real world and for many different applications. At the moment I’m working on our next webinar which will go live later this summer. I’m also involved in producing short tutorials in a segment we call #TutorialTuesdays on YouTube and Twitter, along with longer videos that demonstrate the entire meshing process.

What would you say is your meshing specialty?

As I’ve mentioned, one of my roles is pre-sales support during the evaluation stage. Therefore, I must be well versed in our software and best practices so I can help new users get up to speed quickly. That being said, I’d say my meshing specialty is unstructured viscous meshing using T-Rex.

Having worked many different meshing applications over the last few years I’ve come to appreciate the intricacies of getting something rather automated to do what I need it to do for a complex geometry. I know how T-Rex works, I know how and when to apply it, and I know how to get it to do what I want. The secret is all in the surface mesh.

Any tips for our users?

If you’re stuck, contact us. Zach already mentioned it in his post, but I’ll reiterate. Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have a question, comment, or concern. Believe it or not, we love hearing from you. The more feedback the better! We are your grid generation subject matter experts and are available to help in any way we can. Feel free to contact us by phone (1-800-4PTWISE), email (support@pointwise.com), the web, or request a GoToMeeting invitation.

It’s probably scriptable. Glyph scripting is a powerful tool. It gives you access to every command in the Pointwise user interface. However, unlike in the GUI, with Glyph you can string together multiple commands and write your own macros and features. I call this hacking Pointwise since you can get the software to do some pretty incredible things like solving a Rubik’s Cube or playing Pong. A more productive application would involve splitting multiple connectors simultaneously. In Pointwise you would have to split one connector at a time. Another great application is taking a connector, copying, translating, and then stretching it to fit between two points. These three separate tasks can be combined into a single script.

T-Rex is all about the surface mesh. The quality of a volume mesh is highly dependent on the quality of the surface mesh. Keep in mind that when running T-Rex you are advancing elements off of the surface mesh. If your surface mesh quality is poor, the volume mesh will also be poor. So if you encounter a poor quality element in the volume, look at the surface mesh in the vicinity. Not always, but more often than not there is a spacing or something else not set correctly on the surface. Below are my recommendations before generating a volume mesh using T-Rex.

Select all the domains on the surface of your geometry (exclude match domains) and examine the area ratio. The area ratio should be less than 4 everywhere. If you find you have a high area ratio, chances are there is a spacing mismatch at a node. When advancing elements off the surface, smaller elements will reach isotropy (T-Rex stop criteria) sooner than larger elements. This means that if you have a large area ratio you have a small element adjacent to a large element and when advancing into the volume mesh the front could stop prematurely.

With the surface domains still selected, examine the maximum included angle. Keep this as low as possible. Geometry is going to dictate this, so high angles may not be avoidable all the time. I like to keep my max angle less than 150. If I have an element that’s higher than that I’ll decide whether I need to modify the surface mesh in that region either by joining domains, or by approximating the geometry to eliminate the poor angle.

Assuming you haven’t assembled the block yet, take your grid into Grid, Merge and ensure you have no lamina connectors. Lamina connectors on the interior of your grid indicate gaps in the surface mesh and should be fixed or else a watertight volume cannot be generated.

What project are you most proud of and why?

It’s a tie between two Glyph scripting projects. I began working on the first project just before I was hired full time. It was a project for a Quiet Aircraft Technology program member and I worked with Nick Wyman to automate the meshing for conical and chevron jet nozzles. The Glyph scripts we wrote automatically generated overset, multiblock structured grids given an input nozzle geometry. We developed a user interface for each script that exposed all the meshing parameters necessary to generate the grids from scratch so the end-user wouldn’t have to load up the Pointwise GUI. Once the grid had been generated, the script would export all the component grids and PEGASUS control file used for the overset grid assembly. Acoustic simulations were performed, requiring the grids to be of very high quality. To give you an idea how much time this saved the engineers, assembling a single grid by hand would take one to three days depending on the complexity of the nozzle. The script reduced that to under an hour.

The second project was a Glyph scripting library I wrote to elevate the order of linear elements generated using Pointwise. Using the grid coordinate enumerator written in Glyph by David Garlisch, a Senior Engineer on our Product Development team, I was able to gain access to the grid model, compute the nodal locations for the additional points including placing them on the CAD geometry where appropriate, and generate the higher order connectivity for each element. The script was successfully coupled with a script generated by Cameron, Compression Systems that automatically generated multiblock structured finite element grids for open-faced centrifugal impellers. In the end we had a set of automated tools for generating higher order hexahedral grids to improve the prediction of centrifugal impeller failure modes.

What CFD solver and postprocessor do you use most often?

When I need to validate a meshing strategy for a particular application or when I’m working on a project that requires I run a calculation, I rely on a few open source CFD solvers. I’m primarily using OpenFOAM on my Linux workstation for incompressible, steady and unsteady simulations. I’ve been using OpenFOAM for more than five years now and worked with David Garlisch to develop a plugin so Pointwise users can seamlessly export a grid to OpenFOAM without the need to run any additional meshing utilities.

Recently I’ve been using Caelus, a restructured derivative of OpenFOAM that runs on my Windows machine. Because it was forked from OpenFOAM, it’s an environment I’m comfortable working in. That being said, under the covers Caelus is different. Solvers are only included if they’ve been validated against published data, the turbulence models and wall functions have been rewritten, and a number of library enhancements have been made including updated interpolation and gradient schemes.

I’m also using SU2, an open source CFD solver developed out of Stanford University. I have SU2 running on both my Windows machine and my Linux workstation and primarily use it for external aerodynamics calculations. Over the past couple years we’ve done a lot of work with the SU2 team. Last year we hosted a webinar and discussed supersonic aircraft shape design using the Lockheed Martin 1021, a test case from the AIAA Sonic Boom Prediction Workshop. As part of the project I wrote a Glyph script to generate free form deformation boxes and export the data to SU2 for shape deformation. A few months later we held a joint workshop at Stanford where we walked through the entire CFD process using Pointwise and SU2.

For postprocessing I use a mix of ParaView, EnSight by CEI, and Tecplot. My OpenFOAM environment is setup to load results directly into ParaView, and I’m using both EnSight and Tecplot for grid visualization and solution visualization. Our first joint webinar was hosted by Tecplot and we discussed an automated methodology for optimizing the aerodynamic performance of vertical axis wind turbine rotors, my master’s work. We’ve hosted a couple webinars with CEI. One involved North American Eagle and an attempt to break the land speed record, another with CRAFT Tech and analysis of cavitation and acoustics of a water injection pump.

Are you reading any interesting technical papers we should know about?

A few. I’m reading John Steinbrenner’s Construction of Prism and Hex Layers from Anisotropic Tetrahedra which describes T-Rex and more specifically the evolution of cell combination techniques. I’m also reading Aeroacoustic Simulations of a Nose Landing Gear using FUN3D on Pointwise Unstructured Grids by V.N. Vatsa, M.R. Khorrami, J. Rhoads, and D.P. Lockard. Both papers will be presented at AIAA Aviation. While working on the DrivAer grids and simulations I’ve been reading Experimental and Numerical Investigation of the DrivAer Model by A.I. Heft, T. Indinger, and N.A. Adams.

Recently I had the opportunity to attend one of Edward Tufte’s courses on Presenting Data and Information. John Chawner recently wrote an article describing a few of the highlights. After taking the course I started reading Beautiful Evidence. It’s a great book and I especially enjoyed the chapters on sparklines and the fundamental principles of analytical design.

Do you plan on attending any conferences or workshops this year?

Absolutely! This month alone I’ll be at three different conferences and workshops. June 15th-19th I’ll be in Montreal at TurboExpo. Please drop by the booth and we can chat about your turbomachinery meshing applications. The following week I’ll be at AIAA Aviation. Be sure to attend our Let’s Talk Meshing Workshop on June 21st before the conference. You’ll learn how to use our latest overset meshing tools, get an introduction to Suggar++, see some new Pointwise features, I’ll be teaching you how to get started with Glyph scripting, and our president will present the product roadmap for Pointwise. You won’t want to miss it. The week after Aviation I’ll be in Ann Arbor, Michigan at the 10th OpenFOAM Workshop. There I’ll be presenting our work on the DrivAer automotive model. Come by and I’ll show you how Pointwise seamlessly integrates with OpenFOAM. The last week of July I’ll be in Orlando, Florida at the AIAA Propulsion and Energy conference.

What do you do when you’re not generating meshes?

Sleep.

Just kidding. I have a lot of different hobbies from running CFD on a Raspberry Pi to building a home flight simulator. After graduate school I started reading again and am a big fan of Daniel Suarez and his books. Right now I’m reading Beautiful Evidence by Edward Tufte, To Sell Is Human by Daniel H. Pink, The Everything Store by Brad Stone, and IT by Stephen King.

I do a lot of gaming on iOS, Android, PC, and the PS4. A few years ago I fell into indie gaming and discovered a unique world of art I never knew existed. I could recommend a dozen or more great indie titles, but anything by Amanita Design is absolutely perfect. Samorost, Machinarium, and Botanicula will leave you speechless.

Something else I discovered by chance was coffee. Those who know me know I’m coffee crazy. I’ve amassed a collection of more than ten different coffee makers, all manual brewers with different filtering mechanics. I could go on all day about coffee and the science and art of brewing but I won’t. Instead all I’ll tell you is that real coffee doesn’t taste like Starbucks or a K-cup. A real cup of coffee brewed properly will highlight flavors you never knew existed. Imagine drinking a cup of coffee so sweet that you don’t need to add sugar and so smooth that milk and cream are no longer necessary. The Hario V60 is the most natural way to brew a cup of coffee and gives you control of the brew ratio, grind size, water temperature, bloom time, and brew time. If you want to learn more you can visit my blog. Unfortunately it hasn’t been updated in a while, but there’s plenty of great content.

Few of my hobbies would be fun without someone to share them with. My wife’s a great sport and supportive of everything I do. The two of us do everything together and have recently taken up fishing near our home. She’s a phenomenal cook, a great travel companion, and my best friend. When I’m not generating meshes I’m spending time with her, sipping a coffee and relaxing.

What is some of the best CFD advice you’ve ever received?

“All models are wrong, but some are useful.” –George E. P. Box

If you had to pick a place to have dinner, where would you go?

My wife and I love to eat and try new restaurants wherever we go. Here in Fort Worth, Texas I would recommend Rodeo Goat for the best burger in DFW. If I were back home in Blackfoot, Idaho it would be Rupes. Be sure to try the fry sauce. In San Antonio, Texas I’d say Boudro’s on the Riverwalk. Seattle, Washington would be Elliott’s Oyster House, probably the best seafood place I’ve been to. In San Jose, California you’ve got to drop by Pizza Antica on Santana Row and when you’re finished walk across the street to the Tesla shop just for fun. In New York City definitely Xi’an Famous Foods for some authentic Chinese. If you’re in Albany, New York be sure to try Dave’s Gourmet & Exotic Burgers. It’s the only burger place I know of that sells a python, camel, and kangaroo burger. And lastly, when in Montreal you must visit Le Gourmand Restaurant.

I grew up in India in a small city called Karnal which also happens to be the hometown of late astronaut Kalpana Chawla.

I finished my schooling with an International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma in 2011. One of the IB Diploma requirements was a 4000 word essay on a topic of my choice. I wrote my essay on designing an airfoil to minimize wake turbulence. To run some experiments I built a small wind tunnel at home. Of course the project was naive and simplistic, however it made me want to learn more about fluid dynamics. That’s how I ended up at Georgia Institute of Technology for a BSc in Aerospace Engineering.

At Georgia Tech I had the opportunity to do some undergraduate research in CFD, or I should say, to begin to understand the challenges and complexities associated with it. All I can tell you about my results is that they were on the correct order of magnitude…most of the time. But, it made me want to learn more about CFD. So, when Pointwise offered me an internship it was a no brainer!

This summer I’m learning about grid generation with the Pointwise Support Team. Be it asking support engineers a ton of questions, or be it bugging the developers with (invalid) bugs, I am learning new things every day!

After this summer I am headed to Sweden for grad school. I will be starting my master’s at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. I am pretty stoked about the CFD classes I will get to take! My thesis will hopefully also be related to a CFD topic.

One word that best describes how you work: Sincerely

What software or tools do you use every day?

I use Google Chrome and Safari as my web browsers. Since my machine does not have Microsoft Office, I use Google Docs for taking notes and sharing documents with my colleagues. I watch all the Pointwise training videos on YouTube.

What does your workspace look like?

I work downstairs in the Support wing in Claudio Pita’s office. In addition to putting up with my questions, he also has to share his workspace with me.

My desk is pretty austere, except for the iMac on which I work. Besides the computer, there is always a Pointwise coffee mug filled with water in the morning and coffee in the afternoon. You may also see some merchandise from tech companies that John Chawner seems to have an endless supply of.

What are you currently working on?

Pointwise recently released version 17.3R3. I was involved in the regression testing process. As part of the process, I worked through the tutorials in this latest Pointwise version to make sure that the content of the tutorial workbook is still relevant. I also helped verify that the bug-fixes for this version were working as intended.

I am currently writing Do-It-Yourself (DIY) tutorials for the website. These small exercises demonstrate basic concepts and “tricks” that allow users to generate grids more effectively.

Other than that, I am working on creating a series of unstructured grid families for the trap wing geometry that was used in the 1st High Lift Prediction Workshop. Right now I am focusing on four grid families. The first two will employ different surface meshing algorithms – Delaunay and Advancing Front. Both of these will then use the Delaunay algorithm for volume grid generation. The second two grid families will be T-Rex versions of the first two (for enhanced boundary layer resolution using anisotropic tetrahedra). This project will serve as a benchmark for future studies and workshops.

What would you say is your meshing specialty?

I am still new to grid generation and CFD in general. Creating grids for the trap wing geometry is helping me learn a lot about unstructured meshing. I am hoping that by the time I am done generating grids for this project I will have a strong grasp on the best practices and techniques for unstructured meshing – both with and without anisotropic tetrahedral extrusion (T-Rex).

Any tips for our users?

“Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” – Abraham Lincoln

I remember using Pointwise for a research project at Georgia Tech. I opened the software for the very first time, imported my geometry, and started meshing right away. I didn’t spend time “sharpening the axe.” As a result, I was extremely inefficient.

There are a variety of tools such as the DIYs and tutorials demonstrating meshing techniques, tips, tricks, and best practices available on YouTube . Spending a little time on these tutorials upfront will save you a lot of time later on.

What project are you most proud of and why?

I would go with my ongoing project of grid generation for the trap wing geometry.

There are a lot of iterations involved in the design process because we want to adhere to good meshing practices while at the same time maintaining similar characteristics across different grid families. So I have had to revisit the grids I already created due to design decisions that were made further along in the process. That being said, it is a great project to work on!

The luxury of being surrounded by grid generation experts means that I am learning about the best meshing practices, getting instant feedback, and learning handy tricks to save time – a much more pleasant experience than me trying to figure out everything on my own on a Friday night in the Aerospace computer lab at Georgia Tech.

What CFD solver and postprocessor do you use most often?

I don’t have much experience with CFD solvers and postprocessors, yet. I have only used ANSYS Fluent for one of my projects to analyze transonic flow around a DLR F6 Wing. I used one of the structured grids submitted for the workshop.

Are you reading any interesting technical papers we should know about?

I’m reading John Steinbrenner’s Construction of Prism and Hex Layers from Anisotropic Tetrahedra to learn more about T-Rex and cell combination techniques.

Do you plan on attending any conferences or workshops this year?

Yes! I am attending AIAA Aviation on June 23rd in Dallas. I will be at the Pointwise booth most of the time, but I am hoping to catch a presentation or two as well.

What do you do when you’re not generating meshes?

Making myself a latte in the upstairs kitchen.

Every now and then I also like taking a break from the hustle bustle of the city to go hiking. I prefer wilderness hiking because of the peace and quiet. It helps me relax. It also makes me appreciate the little things when I get back – like a warm and dry bed. However, I also enjoy hiking on well marked trails from one town to another, which is quite popular in Europe. In summer of 2013 I hiked the entire Kerry Way in Ireland. I did not mind having a Guinness and some fish & chips after long hikes and chatting with the locals. It was a pretty neat way of travelling the country! Last summer I hiked with a group of from Georgia Tech in Everest National Park in Nepal. Yes, we got a pic of THE Mount Everest.

It was a breathtaking hike with spectacular scenery and a unique cultural experience. This summer, I am hoping to hike the Kungsleden trail in Sweden.

Besides hiking, I also enjoy learning languages. I have been learning German for three years now and am pretty much fluent in it. I usually wake up twice or thrice a week at 4:30 am for my Swedish Skype tuition. I am trying to learn as much as I can now so that I can pick up the language faster once I move to Sweden for graduate school. I am also taking beginner French lessons on Skype every Sunday.

What is some of the best CFD advice you’ve ever received?

For the trap wing geometry project that I am working on I needed a farfield that is located at 50 times the body length. I was advised to divide such a big farfield into an inner and an outer farfield. This approach had two significant advantages:

My block(s) initialized 10-15 times faster.

It allowed me to have greater control over grid resolution in the vicinity of the wing.

If you had to pick a place to have dinner, where would you go?

Have you ever tried Indian-Chinese cuisine? It is the “Chinese” food you will find in India and is absolutely phenomenal! My favorite place is Princess Garden in New Delhi.

OK, I’ve got to come clean. I don’t rigorously mesh that often. As part of the product development team, the grids I spend most of my time with are those meshes submitted by our talented users. They are typically ones that expose, ahem, “new features” in Pointwise that aren’t quite ready for the limelight. Joking aside, the meshes that I do see remind me regularly that Pointwise is used by many incredibly gifted individuals across the world. It’s one of the most gratifying feelings as a software developer to know that your software is genuinely helping people.

As for some background on myself, I was born and raised in Texas – more specifically, a suburb of the city of Tyler in East Texas. They call Tyler the “Rose Capital of the World.” I suppose because “Rose Capital of the Universe” sounded too presumptuous. That said, I do love Texas, and I hope to spend as much of my life here as possible. My only complaint is that there are still a few days out of the year when it’s cold.

I am one of those peculiar individuals who knew very early on what I wanted to be. In my youth, access to my family PC unlocked a fascination with computers that has never faded. My curiosity frequently got me into trouble however. As the third of four children, I often bore the blame whenever the family computer acted up. Perhaps the consternation that I was bested by a machine inspired me to devote my life to its mastery. Whatever the case, I began teaching myself to program in C++ by my early teens. I was hooked. In 2012, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Dallas. Shortly after, I landed an excellent job at Pointwise. I’m fortunate enough to work daily with some of the most gracious and intelligent individuals in CFD and software.

What software or tools do you use every day?

I’m glad you asked! Unquestionably, the most important tool I use is my text editor. I would be performing a disservice to my profession if I did not take this opportunity to excessively extol the virtues of my editor of choice – namely, vim. My first taste of vim came during a lecture from one of my college professors. I was shocked to see how quickly and effortlessly he manipulated his code without touching the mouse. This was magic. I had to learn these secret arts. Since then, I’ve discovered that learning vim is a bit like climbing a mountain: daunting at first, a long way down, and full of endless wonder! (He’s still talking about a text editor, right?)

Paired with vim, I use Microsoft’s magnum opus that is Visual Studio for code compilation and debugging. I use Cygwin for tools like grep, find, rsync, and xterm. MaxTo is an excellent window management tool I use to organize windows on my desktop. I also use Perforce for software versioning and revision control. Finally, I will give major kudos to AutoHotkey for enabling me to fill in all the small gaps that aren’t covered by dedicated software.

What does your workspace look like?

I work in a cozy cubicle located in one of Pointwise’s first floor offices in Fort Worth. This particular downstairs office houses only developers. We lovingly call it “the developer dungeon.” In practice, however, it is probably more like a library as often only the sound of keystrokes break the silence. On more than one occasion, I’ve noticed guests in our downstairs office feel the curious need to whisper while here.

As for my desk, I try to keep things organized. I use two monitors: one in landscape and the second in portrait. My keyboard is the Das Keyboard 4 Ultimate. Its distinguishing feature is that its keys are completely blank and very clicky. I use a completely vanilla dell mouse as I’ve yet to find a wired, left-handed mouse that is more useful. For audio, I use Audio Technica’s M50 headphones – highly recommend for the price! The keen observer will also spot an aging Mac-mini that I occasionally use for odd jobs related to development. Other than that, I’ve got the basics: a phone, a notepad, a notebook, and a fountain pen.

What are you currently working on?

Recently, I have been working on upgrading Pointwise to use Qt5. For the unaware, Qt (pronounced “cute”) is a platform agnostic framework that is used for application development. While Qt’s most recognizable feature is its platform appropriate graphical user interfaces, it also provides low-level cross-platform features such as an extensive set of data structures and utilities. Pointwise has used Qt4 until this point. When my work is complete, Pointwise will employ Qt’s latest and greatest offering that is Qt5.

Other than that, I’m juggling several bugs that are assigned to me. I prefer to have several ongoing tasks. Having the ability to switch to something new should I hit a rough spot on a current task is often helpful. Commonly, I find that a good way to solve a tough problem is to give yourself some space and revisit it later with a clear mind.

What would you say is your meshing specialty?

As a product developer at Pointwise, I am more focused on maintaining and improving our code than specifically meshing. To that end, I have the fortunate position of being able to work on many aspects of the software. Therefore, I don’t have a “specialty” per say. I try to keep myself as well versed on as many aspects of the code as possible. I enjoy learning new things, so I am always eager to take on new challenges. Pointwise is really fascinating software in that it employs a wide range of software techniques and disciplines.

Any tips for our users?

Personally, I enjoy figuring out new software. However, even I find the process intimidating at the outset. My personal recommendation when learning any software is to never be afraid to explore it. This also applies to Pointwise. Don’t hesitate to try a feature, task, checkbox, etc. just because it is unfamiliar. It might be exactly what you need! Very often, the only way to truly understand how a tool works is to use it frequently and try it across varied scenarios.

To this end, Pointwise even gives you a leg up. It may sound simple, but Pointwise offers task selection sensitivity. That is, tasks are enabled only for entity selections that make sense. This very quickly pares down the number of options you have to explore. For example, you might select a connector and explore all the tools that work with a connector. While exploring, you might just find something you didn’t know Pointwise could do!

What project are you most proud of and why?

A good candidate would be the Align View to Surface task. It may seem deceptively simple, but a fair amount of work was done behind the scenes to keep this task running smoothly. My work on this is particularly gratifying as it is quite handy tool. I’m also a bit biased because this particular task was quite enjoyable to work on.

A close second would probably be the work I did to improve the Orient task for structured domains. Previously, it could be quite difficult to determine orientation of complex structured domains – even more confusing when multiple domains enter the picture. Therefore, I added code to draw inset, surface aligned arrows indicating the I,J, and normal directions of the domain. This seemingly trivial task held a few challenges that I enjoyed facing.

Honorable mentions would probably go towards my work on the Y+ Calculator App, the Leap Motion controller, and the upgrade to CGNS 3.1.4. Each one was a fairly involved undertaking and therefore felt rewarding to work on.

What CFD solver and postprocessor do you use most often?

Aside from demo scenarios, I’m not sure if I’ve ever run a solver to completion. Typically, my focus with solvers and post processors is to check the validity of the grids Pointwise exports. As I am one of the developers responsible for maintaining our ANSYS Fluent plugin, I am familiar Fluent’s case file format and the import process. ParaView is another tool I am familiar with and often use it to help verify a number of other file formats.

Are you reading any interesting technical papers we should know about?

No technical papers, but I am reading several technical books in my spare time. At the moment, I am dividing my time between three: Real-Time Rendering by Tomas Akenine-Möller, OpenGL 4.0 Shading Language Cookbook by David Wolf, and finally Real-Time Collision Detection by Christer Ericson.

Do you plan on attending any conferences or workshops this year?

Yes! Earlier this year, I attended AIAA’s Aviation 2015 conference in Dallas, Texas. Later, I will be attending the 24th International Meshing Roundtable in Austin, Texas. I’m looking forward to gaining more insight into the meshing community at the upcoming event.

What do you do when you’re not generating meshes?

When I’m not helping to create the best meshing software in the world, I divide my time between several things: church, family, friends, hobbies, and pastimes. As alluded to earlier, most of my family lives in Tyler, Texas. I enjoy visiting them when I can, and the two-hour trip from Fort Worth is easily manageable over a weekend.

As for hobbies, I unfortunately have too many. I dabble in 2D vector graphic art as well as 3D renders. I’m also an amateur digital music composer with slight experience as a pianist. One of my more outlandish hobbies is repairing and modifying video arcade cabinets.

Unsurprisingly, I also like programming in my spare time. Sadly, I have a proclivity for starting more projects than I can finish. Thus, there are too many to name individually. However, one of my more current software projects involves integration with the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset.

When time affords, I also enjoy traveling. I especially enjoy visiting national parks. A friend and I recently made a hectic eleven day road trip across the western United States. Starting from Fort Worth Texas, we were able to cram in visits to Sequoia National Park, Yosemite, Lake Tahoe, Redwood National Park, Glacier National Park, Devil’s Tower, Mount Rushmore, Badlands National Park, and Rocky Mountain National Park.

What is some of the best CFD advice you’ve ever received?

“Everyone has different opinions on what a makes a good mesh. There isn’t a single answer. An ugly grid, however, likely has problems.”– John Chawner

If you had to pick a place to have dinner, where would you go?

Every so often, I get tired of burying all my excess cash in the backyard. On those days, I enjoying eating a nice steak at the Reata Restaurant in Fort Worth, TX. I have eaten few steaks that come close to matching the excellence that is a Reata steak.

While I started off my college career in computer aided design, I never went into the engineering world of meshing before I made the switch back to my first love of computers. I can remember my days on the Commodore VIC-20, programing a stick figure to run across the screen and jump, then saving that code to the cassette drive. I think I was 9. I pieced together parts of my first 8088 when I was 11. So, to say I am a lifelong computer nerd is no exaggeration. After college, I worked in IT for the healthcare industry, and software development industry for healthcare systems. This gave me a great deal of experience in older systems, as well as cutting edge technology. As a result, I am experienced in many systems from AS400 and SCO UNIX, to the latest in Red Hat Enterprise 7 and Windows Server 2012 R2 along with the network infrastructure from token ring to fiber. All of this experience in old and new technology has prepared me for an office of high-tech users, like Pointwise. Often do we find creative ways to make a patchwork of various versions of Linux and Mac communicate in a Microsoft Active Directory environment.

I have been with Pointwise for over two years now, and I have to say, I have never been happier. The team here genuinely cares about the customers, and that leads to us working together better than any company I have previously been employed. Being able to work with the entire team at Pointwise to make sure the customers have great support and an excellent experience with the software makes the late night and weekend server rebuilds worth every minute.

One word that best describes how you work: Ever-changing

What software or tools do you use every day?

I use various tools for various tasks every day. The most common are Server Manager and Remote Desktop Connection Manager from Microsoft along with a terminal emulator from Cygwin for remote management of servers. However the application that is always open on my workstation is Google Chrome. With more applications becoming accessible from a browser interface, I use Chrome to access our Spiceworks server for network management, our wiki database, and Sage CRM to support the customer care system.

What does your workspace look like?

My desk is pretty simple, just my workstation, a phone, and the all-important coffee. My workspace, however, extends to the server room and the workspace of every employee at Pointwise. Our server room consists of racks of servers, some are standalone servers to control and house the build process for the developers, and others provide our virtual environment for a slew of virtual servers that supply the everyday applications such as Microsoft Exchange, Sage CRM, and many others.

What are you currently working on?

Aside from the everyday, ever-changing tasks of supporting an office full of high-tech users, I am currently working on the plans to replace the phone system at Pointwise. We will soon be moving to a cloud based VOIP system that will not only give us more capabilities and flexibility to assist our customers, but protect the system from obsolescence and disaster.

What would you say is your specialty at Pointwise?

I think my specialty at Pointwise is my adaptability. The IT world is always changing and the system admin must change with it. Our staff is highly technical and that means the company’s needs are always pushing the cutting edge of technology. Whether it is replacing an entire phone system or configuring a workstation to support 512GB of RAM, tell me what you want, and I will make it happen.

Any tips, tricks, or advice for our users?

Be nice to your IT guys. Aside from fixing issues with workstations, the IT guys have many systems on the back-end to maintain. When it comes to IT, it is what the users don’t see that make the everyday possible.

What project are you most proud of and why?

With several projects successfully completed, such as moving services to Active Directory Authentication, a new backup system, and some major revisions to Sage CRM, I would have to say the one I am most proud of has yet to be completed. The phone system upgrade has already been a major task of planning and coordination. Between upgrading our fiber bandwidth, planning the building’s analog needs, and finding the best system that fits our needs, when it is complete, this will be my proudest accomplishment.

Have you recently read any books or articles we should know about?

Do Firefly comics count? Yes, I am a Browncoat. So much so, that I had my fiancé’s engagement ring custom made in Sweden to match the Serenity ship with a yellow gemstone as the engine in “full burn.” Other than that, I read technical, political, and space exploration articles.

Do you plan on attending any conferences or workshops this year?

The IT team here at Pointwise alternate years going to Spiceworld, the annual conference for the Spiceworks product we use to assist in managing the network. It is a great conference of training and talking to many vendors of IT infrastructure.

What do you do when you’re not surrounded by engineers making meshes?

Probably fishing, camping, boating, and anything near or on a lake. I am currently restoring a 1979 Silverline cabin cruiser boat. If I am not on the lake, my fiancé and I are on my Harley motorcycle getting lost on the road.

What is some of the best advice you’ve received?

There are so many Firefly quotes I can think of right now, but I think for the best advice I have ever received, I would have to look further back in history for the quote.

“You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, not look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the specters in books. You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me, you shall listen to all sides and filter them from yourself.” – Walt Whitman.

If you had to pick a place to have dinner, where would you go?

I guess, since I have a Whataburger tattoo on my leg, the answer should be Whataburger, but I really like Mexican food. So, while Whataburger holds a special place in my heart going back to my childhood, I would have to say a good hole it the wall, family owned, Mexican food restaurant would be my choice.

Chris Sideroff is the owner and principal director at Applied CCM Canada (www.appliedccm.ca). Applied CCM Canada is the Canadian distributor for Pointwise, offers OpenFOAM-based development and support services, and is the primary developer of the OpenFOAM derivative, Caelus.

What do you see are the biggest challenges facing CFD in the next 3 years?

I think an obvious one is meshing – which means Pointwise is safe for a while. Seriously though, I think a big issue with meshing is a disconnect between what the mesher (software and/or user) creates and what the solver wants. I believe it’s deeper than what mesh adaption can do or has been promising to do (for a quite some time). Every numerical implementation of a CFD solver has made some assumptions – this is how we discretize the Navier-Stokes equations so they can be solved numerically. One or more of these assumptions always has a geometric consideration; hence the dependency on some characteristic of the mesh elements’ shapes.

As I see it there are two main issues. First, it tends to be very difficult, in a general sense, to identify exactly how much a mesh metric affects solution accuracy. The relationships among the assumptions are non-linear so rarely is there an opportunity to isolate and study the influence of one metric. Second, what, where and how these assumptions are made differs between CFD solvers. It’s kind of like if you don’t know the target you’re aiming for, how do you expect to hit the bulls-eye? In my opinion, it’s going to require much closer collaboration between those who develop meshing software and those who develop solver software. If we can reduce or eliminate the influence of the element shapes on solution accuracy, then there is some hope of significantly reducing the mesh generation burden. Then we can begin to think about things like automation and adaption.

The other big challenge is exploiting parallel architectures. Also let be me clear here and state that I don’t believe “the cloud” is our savior. There is more than enough hardware at our disposal even in a relatively low-cost desk-side workstation but we’re simply not using it. Traditionally we think of running CFD on the CPU core – one CFD process per core. But within modern workstation there are hundreds and sometimes thousands of unused processing units. I’m using the term unit here very generically. An obvious one you often hear about is general purpose computing on graphics cards, also known as GPGPU computing. There are a few others like multi-threaded cores, co-processors and ISA vector extensions. As an example, I was reading an article on HPCWire that mentioned the upcoming Power9 architecture from IBM would need 2,000 parallel operations at a time to keep a single core busy.

On the flip side, if you look at the www.Top500.org list of fastest supercomputers in the world you will find computers with more than 100,000 cores are commonplace and there are several with over a million. Combine that with what a single core can do and we’ll soon be talking about billion process simulations. Then the trillion cell challenge that Tecplot has posed will not seem so outrageous. In the CFD world, we have only touched the tip of the iceberg about understanding how to exploit all these resources. In this instance I feel the challenge is educating CFD engineers more about computer science so we can better utilize the resources already at our disposal.

John: As you know, I think NASA’s CFD Vision 2030 Study is a very comprehensive assessment of where CFD is today versus where we need it to be in the year 2030. Meshing and exascale computing were only two of the things they cited. How do you feel about the report overall? Did they get it right? Did they miss anything?

Chris: In the context of CFD for aerospace I think they got it right. I say in the context of aerospace because I’m sure CFD users in this field, particularly in the U.S. who have access to many of the excellent aero-centric CFD codes, may disagree with my point about the disconnect between mesh quality and solution accuracy. My argument was more general, in the context of CFD usage in more than one industry that use commercial or openly available solvers, where mesh quality can be a barrier to robustness and reliability.

In regard to my parallel computing comment, I think my point of the available parallel resources at the desktop is not addressed. One of their grand challenges was a large eddy simulation of a full-scale aircraft across the flight envelope. Clearly, that’s only going to be possible on the largest supercomputer available at the time, even by 2030. The overwhelming usage of CFD is still going to occur on the desktop so it seems to me even small improvements in the bigger portion of the “usage pie” would lead to more profound improvements in the applicability of CFD.

My general feeling is it was an excellent report that demonstrates leadership both from NASA as a leader in aerodynamics and for aerodynamics as a leader for CFD. While maybe it’s not applicable to all areas of CFD, it should prove to be a good reference point for other industries.

What are you currently working on?

We are working madly to complete our next release of Caelus, 5.10 (www.caelus-cml.com). Caelus is our fork of OpenFOAM. The first release was about bringing open-source CFD to Mac and Windows. The second release was about improving numerical aspects, in particular improving accuracy near walls and reducing sensitivity to mesh quality. We also added new infrastructure based on Python that will make it much easier to use and automate Caelus. The upcoming release, slated for this October, among other things will reintroduce of compressible solvers and turbulence models, the majority of which were written from scratch. OpenFOAM is not known for its compressible capabilities so we took some time to develop some new solvers that should improve that reputation.

Aside from that I am also quite busy working with our Pointwise customers. When I get questions from customers, I like diving in with their meshing projects, particularly if scripting is involved.

I’ve also been spending time trying to raise awareness of Applied CCM and Pointwise throughout Canada. One in particular is Pointwise’s #TutorialTuesday on Twitter, where Pointwise tips, tricks, and tutorials are posted every Tuesday. Through this, I’ve created a couple of videos demonstrating meshing a submarine hull geometry with both structured and unstructured techniques. I plan on using these meshes in some Caelus tutorials as well.

I am continually working on several projects involving Caelus and OpenFOAM. Applied CCM conducts a significant amount of internal research and development on new solvers, tools and methods. Things like our adjoint solver useful for shape optimization, our tangent solver useful for parameter optimization, and our high-speed transient solver that is significantly faster and more scalable than traditional transient solvers, are examples of technologies that have come out of our internal development projects.

John: OK, I have to ask. Why does the world need another variant of OpenFOAM? Where do you think Caelus fits into the OpenFOAM galaxy and the overall CFD universe? More directly, why would I want to use Caelus for my CFD versus something else?

Chris: Would it come as a shock to you that we’ve have been asked this question before? To which I usually reply with our technical reasons for doing so but perhaps I’ll take the opportunity to give some more philosophical reasons.

There is a general lack of cohesiveness among the development and use of OpenFOAM. To explain why I say this let me start with some context. For an open-source project to be successful, both in the terms of technical ability and social health, the process for making decisions must be transparent. It does not necessarily need to be democratic – simply transparent. You often hear the term “benevolent dictator” applied to leaders of many of the larger projects. Linus Torvalds of Linux and Guido van Rossum of Python are two good examples. There needs to exist a dynamic two-way dialog between the maintainer and the community. The maintainer makes decisions unilaterally but like any successful leader they do so while at least heeding their user’s advice and feedback. As I see it, this does not occur with OpenFOAM or if it does it is not obvious.

The community around OpenFOAM is vibrant and continually growing but there is little communication between the maintainers of OpenFOAM and the community. So there’s all these people doing what they love around OpenFOAM but because there’s no dialogue and legitimate way of contributing ideas back, there is a lot of fragmentation. Furthermore, because OpenFOAM provides no proof of verification, validation or algorithmic code review, the community is left to do so on their own leading to further fragmentation. In my opinion, this lack of cohesiveness is significantly hampering it. As you mention, there are other OpenFOAM projects but I have yet to see the cohesiveness I was speaking to like you see in other successful open-source projects. At least that’s how I see it.

We hope to change that model with Caelus. We try to have an open, two-way dialogue with users. For users that have developed their own extensions to Caelus, provided they’ve been satisfactorily tested and documented, we will happily add them to the distribution. We also do not require reassignment of copyright of the contributed code. Verification, validation, and code review is part of our Caelus development process now – and we are open about it. The plan is to make test cases the tutorials so that when a user looks to a tutorial as a guideline, those settings are relevant rather than only applicable to trivial cases. We started this already but will take some time to develop a significant body of test cases and documentation. As a community around Caelus grows, we may look to the community to help maintain certain portions of it but ultimately we will remain the benevolent dictators.

So that was the ideological thought process. Why would people want to use Caelus? First, it is built, tested and supported on Linux, Mac and Windows. It’s no secret the most prevalent desktop OS is Windows so those people were getting no love from OpenFOAM. Yes, there are a number of projects that have enabled OpenFOAM on Windows but many require the user to figure out how to compile it and again were not officially supported by OpenFOAM. The development environment on Windows is far different from on Unix-based operating systems so what compiles on Linux can be very difficult to compile on Windows. And most users probably don’t even want to bother compiling the software – as users they’re perfectly happy with binaries. This was our assumption when making this decision, now validated since the initial release of Caelus where Windows downloads outnumber the other two platforms 2 to 1.

OpenFOAM is known to be sensitive to mesh quality. There are schemes and settings available to counteract this – which often don’t help – but because the documentation and tutorials are so limiting, users are often immediately turned off. So unless you have an expert at your disposal, getting even converged solutions can be an exercise in futility. The second release of Caelus was a first step in remedying this. I’m not going to profess to you that all the issues can be fixed and will work on every case in one release but it’s a step in the right direction. There are a few other items that contribute to mesh sensitivity and it will take us a little longer to develop and test. I would also like to mention, that we release Caelus bi-annually – April and October – to keep things moving forward at a predictable pace. The version numbers reflect that. The first was 4.10 for Oct 2014, the second was 5.04 for last April, 5.10 for this October and so on.

John: Thanks for your candor and transparency, to use your word. I’m hoping this incites a dialog in the comments on this article.

How did you get to be where you are today?

I grew up in a really small town in northwestern Alberta, Canada (find Edmonton on a map and go northwest until you stop seeing civilization). Particularly, since I grew up before the internet got going, I wasn’t exposed to much outside of hockey. I do recall always having a love for airplanes and pretty much anything that flew. Plus, I was naturally good at math and science.

My path to getting into CFD wasn’t exactly direct. Out of high school, I started my freshman year of engineering in a local college that had a transfer program to the University of Alberta for subsequent years. That year didn’t go so well and I was asked to rethink my future as an engineer. The petroleum industry in Alberta at the time was booming so I got a job as a truck driver on a frack crew (yes, the so-called “evil” fracking you hear of in the news regularly). To make a long story shorter, after a couple of years as a truck driver, I had a rare moment of clarity where I decided that wasn’t the life for me anymore. I quit within a week. I also want to mention that being a truck driver is not a bad thing – I actually liked doing it, learned a ton and worked with a lot of great people – but it just didn’t jive with the expectations I had for myself.

I managed to get back into engineering school and eventually enrolled in the Mechanical Engineering program at the University of Alberta in Edmonton and graduated in 2000 with honors. During my senior year, as I was thinking about join the work force, I found myself a little disillusioned with the types of jobs available in Alberta. Nearly all my classmates were moving on to very prosperous careers in the petroleum industry but the aero-itch was still there for me. As fate would have it, during the final semester of my degree, the instructor in my compressible flow course, Dr. Jeff Yokota, suggested I consider grad school. Jeff was a totally unconventional professor – think long hair, many earrings, plaid unbuttoned shirt with a plain T-shirt, jeans and sneakers [John: Sounds like every math professor I had.] – but for whatever reason he resonated with me. Before becoming a professor, Jeff was a CFD researcher at NASA Glenn (then called Lewis) so he had lots of cool stories, knowledge, and experiences to share. So grad school with Jeff working on CFD was an obvious choice. I finished my MSc in 2003 which was about developing inverse design methods for axial turbomachinery cascades using CFD.

That work lead to me my PhD in Syracuse. While that’s what led me there, I ended up working on something completely different (applying CFD in the indoor environment). It still of course involved CFD but with commercial software instead of in-house developed codes. In retrospect, the opportunity to try many different approaches and tools was the best thing for me. Although there was no way I knew it at the time, probably the most influential aspect on how I got to where I am today was Gridgen. That was how you and I were introduced.

John: Because I’m an Orangeman (Syracuse class of 1984), Pointwise has been providing my alma mater with free software for many years. And when I was on campus for an engineering career fair, that’s when you and I met. One thing led to another and you began work at Pointwise.

Who or what inspired you to get started in your career?

I hope no one I know takes offense to this but probably no one but myself. There are many who have helped me get where I am but I honestly feel my passion for science, math, computers and fluid dynamics is just part of my genetic makeup.

What advice do you have for young people entering the field today?

Here’s some advice I gave that helped a new graduate student at one of the local universities get a job in our field.

Be motivated to learn about and be good at many things. We all have our one or two passions but it’s important to have a broad skill set. Things like learning to program. Don’t learn one. Learn as many as you can. Low level languages like C and C++ and high level languages like Python and Tcl/Tk are good to know in our field. I should note, while Matlab is OK for simple analysis and data post-processing, you do not learn about the science of computing with it (hardware operation, memory management, IO, numerical methods (see below). That and it’s horrifically slow. Another one is the Linux operating system. It is very common in the CFD world, it’s free and easy to install.

Be interested in the fundamentals of numerical methods. Things like quadrature, interpolation, root finding, Lagrangian vs Eulerian, linear and non-linear systems form the foundation of the finite element method, finite volume method and others. By the way, having a thorough understanding of linear algebra (non-linear systems are converted to linear ones so it all ends up being linear) is a very desirable knowledge skill. Learn about the FEM, FVM and finite difference method, or even Lattice Boltzmann. These methods form the foundation of numerical analysis software such as ANSYS (FEM), Fluent (FVM) or PowerFLOW (LBM). You don’t see FDM much anymore but it’s good to be aware of it. If you really want to roll your sleeves up and get dirty, take a look at Caelus or OpenFOAM.

While it’s good to have experience with commercial CAE software, it’s important to have at least a cursory understanding of what’s inside them. You don’t just want to be a “crank turner.” Even if your passion is designing fluid systems, and the software is simply one tool of many, understanding how it works will make you much more productive and enable you to make better decisions about the results. I use the “garbage in, garbage out” analogy with CFD a lot. Just because it can produce pretty pictures doesn’t mean it’s correct. In fact, more times than not the results will be wrong. One has to work hard to get a “right” one.

I’ve seen what employers look for in candidates and they want someone that’s worth the money. Engineers with graduate degrees who work with CFD, typically expect higher salaries. That means employers commensurately demand more out of them and will be more cautious about who they hire. Because hiring people in these fields is a bigger investment, the risk to the company goes up. Clearly someone who can do many diverse tasks has more value and therefore the potential to reward the company’s investment goes up.

John: You realize I was able to graduate from Syracuse with an undergraduate degree in engineering without taking any linear algebra, right?

Chris: I’m surprised it wasn’t a required course.

John: Seriously, when it comes to hiring new college grads, my approach has been that skills can be taught; therefore, hire for aptitude. In other words, learn the fundamentals, learn how to learn, and you’ll be a strong candidate. Plus be a solid communicator.

Chris: I totally agree with that statement. The role of university is to learn how to learn. My advice about “skills to learn” are topics you should learn on your own. That’s the beauty of grad school – it offers the freedom and flexibility to develop skills while you learn. I am not sure it’s necessarily the role of the employer to teach those skills but having any of these sure looks good to an employer. Let’s not even open a discussion about the generally abhorrent writing and communication skills most engineers have.

How do you know Pointwise?

The company/people: I used to work there. The software: I used Gridgen in graduate school.

John: I think it’s important to make readers aware that you left because you had an entrepreneurial itch you wanted to scratch and a desire to do more programming. It would’ve been great if you were still here.

Chris: That’s right. I had a lot of fun working at Pointwise and have a lot of respect for the people and company.

Can you share with us your favorite tools and resources that help you get your job done?

Linux and in particular a Bash shell: Honestly, I don’t know how people develop software without it. By the way, you’re a lunatic if you’re using a C shell. Korn shell and zsh are OK though.

Stack Overflow: Honestly, I don’t know how people develop software without it or even before the internet.

Pointwise: Honestly, I don’t know how people make meshes without it.

Vim: Honestly … I need not say more.

Everything else I have an open mind about.

If we were to visit you, where’s a good place to go out for dinner?

I haven’t fully explored Ottawa’s eatery scene but there’s an excellent vegetarian restaurant called the Green Door on Main St near St. Joseph’s College. I’ve taken the most hardened carnivores there and they’ve all given it the thumbs up, including myself. Ottawa has an almost ridiculous number of Shawarma restaurants so if Mediterranean food blows your hair back you’d be in heaven here.

John: I was hoping for a poutine recommendation.

Chris: Right, I forgot about your affinity for it. So far the best poutine I’ve had are at what they call here “chip shacks” –your typical little mom-and-pop burger joint. My favorite so far is Casse-Croute Limbour on Rue St. Louise in Gatineau, QC along the Gatineau River near the Chelsea dams.

John: OK, I guess veggies it is the next time I come to visit. Thanks for taking the time for all these questions.

If America was a Ping Pong table, I would be the ball. I grew up in Ohio, bounced out to California during the dotcom implosion, bounced back to Ohio to work at a wind tunnel, and finally bounced down to Texas where I’ve been for 13 years. Everything you’ve heard about Texas is true. It is a dry heat. Houses are cheap. Individuals can be all hat, yet have no cattle.

I grew up in Columbus, Ohio. My parents encouraged me to follow my interests which tended towards airplanes at a young age. I eventually attended The Ohio State University where I earned both a Bachelors and Master’s degree in Aeronautical Engineering. As a student there, I also worked part time at the OSU Aero/Astro Research Laboratory. I got to see how the sausage was made, doing everything from milling model parts on the Bridgeport to calibrating wind tunnel instrumentation using mercury! During that time, I also worked at Beechwold Ace Hardware. I credit that experience with teaching me how to help customers.

My proudest moment at OSU was being part of the team that built and raced a human powered vehicle during the 1994 International Human Powered Vehicle Association (IHPVA) Championship held in Eureka, California. Our vehicle was called the Buckeye Bullet and it was fast. To keep the weight down, we built it out of fiberglass, Kevlar and aluminum. We had a crushing defeat that involved, unfortunately, a parked Ford F-150. The whole project was one of the best learning experiences I’ve ever had.

For graduate school, I worked on two projects. The first was a wind tunnel study of tail icing effects on a de Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter; this even involved a short stint at Cleveland’s NASA Glenn where the flight testing took place. If you want to read the final report, you can get it here (yes, my one and only NASA publication and my name is spelled wrong on the coversheet).

The second and most important project in graduate school was the focus of my Master’s thesis: elliptical airfoils. The unique advantage of elliptical airfoils is that their performance is independent of whether the air is coming or going. I ran transonic wind tunnel tests and CFD analyses for our candidate airfoils. The whole research project was in support of the Boeing X-50 Dragonfly program, an experimental canard-rotor-wing (CRW) aircraft. Two prototypes were built and flown. They both crashed and the program was cancelled in 2006.

In the moments between graduate school projects, I started a fun shareware software project called the Super Numerical Airfoil Creation Kit, or SNACK for short. I eventually changed the name to DesignFOIL. The goal was a simple Windows software tool that would automagically generate NACA airfoil coordinates for wings and then run them through a virtual wind tunnel. The project is still going strong today.

My first long-term job in the real world was at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics in Fort Worth, Texas. I was a store separation engineer for ten years, starting on the F-16, moving to the F-22, then ending up in Advanced Development Programs (i.e. The Skunkworks). My goal was to make sure that anything dropped from a high-speed airplane didn’t “float” back and destroy the airplane. I was honored to receive a Lockheed Aero Star Award in 2011 for some store separation simulations I did that saved the customer a few bucks.

In addition to the fun aviation-related stuff, I wrote an adventure novel called Red Hope after being inspired by the Mars Curiosity rover landing in 2012. The process of turning a one-page idea into a 58,000 word novel was very educational. I’ve clawed my way up to 12,475 on the Amazon best seller list; the guy in 12,474th place is proving to be a formidable challenger.

In 2012, a rare opportunity came up to join the Pointwise team. My work here has allowed me to expound upon the CFD roots that I established in graduate school. Grid generation is really the foundation for any good CFD solution, so it has to be done right. The subject of grid generation is pretty big, so I’m learning something new every day. One of the cool benefits of being at Pointwise is that I get to meet a lot of great people who are working on fascinating projects.

Current position: Senior Engineer

Current computer: Windows7 64-bit, Xeon CPU @ 2GHz, 12GB of RAM

One word that best describes how you work: Easygoing

What software or tools do you use every day?

I use Pointwise every day, all day. For ancillary tasks, I use Outlook, Excel and Word. For DIY videos, I use Snagit to perform screen captures and PowerDirector to edit the Pointwise tutorial videos. For graphics generation, I use a combination of Paint Shop Pro and Paintbrush (yes, the Windows default). Believe it or not, I still use Notepad quite a bit too.

What does your workspace look like?

My desk is in a state of organized clutter. I know where everything is and which stack it’s in. My main monitor doubles as a post-it note holder. My desk is the last stop on the technical magazine rounds, so I literally have a Magazine Mountain on my desk with occasional avalanches.

What are you currently working on?

My regular work involves helping our customers use Pointwise in the most efficient manner possible. This involves answering daily questions, teaching our training classes, and producing tutorials for the software.

What would you say is your meshing specialty?

Between the two major styles of gridding, unstructured is definitely my strong suite. However, I’m working on a structured grid project to help refine my skills in that area. If I had a specialty here, it would probably be software installation, which is no small task if you consider how many operating systems we support. Somebody once said that I could install Pointwise on a potato. That was probably exaggeration.

Any tips for our users?

If you run into an issue that is holding back your progress, please contact us immediately. Email us at support@pointwise.com or call us at 1-800-4PTWISE. We are here to answer your questions from 8:00am to 5:00pm. If you don’t contact me, I’ll be forced to finally deal with Magazine Mountain or waste time trying to install Pointwise on taters.

What project are you most proud of and why?

I’m proud of the video tutorials that we make. These seem to be very popular and we have a lot lined up for production. I’m also proud of the features that I’ve helped get put into Pointwise. Probably the one you might recognize is the orient command for structured domains.

What CFD solver and postprocessor do you use most often?

I get to tinker with a lot of codes throughout the customer support process. With regard to solvers, that includes the likes of Fluent and OpenFOAM mostly. The same goes for postprocessors. Depending on what the customer is working with, I’ll find myself using Tecplot, EnSight, ParaView, etc…

Are you reading any interesting technical papers we should know about?

It’s not exactly a paper, but John D. Anderson Jr.’s “A History of Aerodynamics” is perfect for anybody interested in why aeronautical engineering looks the way it does.

Do you plan on attending any conferences or workshops this year?

I just attended the Metacomp (CFD++) Symposium in Pasadena, CA. I usually attend one of the AIAA conferences every other year. This year I was at the AIAA Aviation conference in Dallas.

What do you do when you’re not generating meshes?

When I’m not at Pointwise, my spare time is spread among three things. My family first and foremost. My wife and I spend a lot of time with our children, trying to get them excited about learning. Second is my hobby airfoil software called DesignFOIL. Lastly is my budding attempt at authoring a novel called Red Hope. Oh, and the Rubik’s Cube: I’ve been a speed cuber for about ten years with my average solve time running around 60 seconds. At one point, I was the 649th fastest cuber in the world.

What is some of the best CFD advice you’ve ever received?

Get Pointwise. And make sure double-precision graphics is enabled (Edit/Preferences/Graphics).

If you had to pick a place to have dinner, where would you go?

I have two little children, so my restaurant needs are simple. However, the best place for a 10th anniversary dinner is the Reatta Restaurant in downtown Fort Worth. For all other occasions, there is Subway.

“I am not an engineer.” I have found that since I started working at Pointwise six years ago, I say that quite often especially after I mention that I work for Pointwise which develops preprocessing software used for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). See, CFD engineers are passionate about meshing and even if they are not currently working in an engineering environment, as it was with my white water rafting guide (an engineer), when they hear “computational fluid dynamics” they become outright giddy and starry-eyed and begin talking about the meshes and CFD analyses they have done. So, I quite often find myself stopping them and saying, “Oh, I am not an engineer but you can keep telling me about your mesh.” I am, however, the full-time marketing person for Pointwise.

What software or tools do you use every day?

At any given time through the day, I have at least these five programs open and am actively working with them: Outlook, Constant Contact, Excel (usually two different workbooks open on each screen), Spark, an instant messaging program, and Asana, task management software.

What does your workspace look like?

Sticky notes galore. Asana is excellent at keeping all project participants abreast of where one is at any given moment for a task or project but sometimes there are miscellaneous bits of information and/or to-dos passed on to me on a daily basis that are not meant to be tasked in Asana or anywhere else except on a sticky note on my desk. When I anticipate my day to be extra fulfilling, I will also create my “MUST DO” list on a sticky and gleefully check off each item when completed.

What would you say is your meshing specialty?

In order to figure out what my meshing specialty was, I decided earlier this week to import a file of Herbie the Love Bug into Pointwise and start meshing. With my awesome Pointwise mousepad that is jam packed with accelerators in hand, I began. I chose the route of jumping in and clicking buttons rather than doing a few tutorials which lead very quickly to an IM to support. My support guy, John Dreese, was wonderful. He did not say, “We have tutorials for this,” but instead, he listened to what I wanted to do, showed me the next steps and then explained what was happening behind the scenes. Best support I’ve gotten from anywhere in a while. One might say that I was getting special treatment since I am a co-worker but aside from him coming to my desk to help, I wasn’t. I’ve seen our support team at work and they all must have a bit of teacher in their persona because they all seem to truly enjoy helping our clients solve their problems and teaching them ways to better use Pointwise. So, I clicked buttons, selected various surfaces, adjusted attributes (aka colors on Herbie), clicked “Assemble Models” and waited. While waiting, I was able to do some soul searching and realized that my meshing specialty, though it may never be creating meshes, is looking over an engineer’s shoulder while they rotate a grid for me and saying things like, “That angle works best,” “The colors here probably could be more vibrant,” and, of course, “I need that screenshot in hi-res, thank you!”

My day-to-day specialty is that of a marketing coordinator. For most events, such as webinars, webcasts, our newsletter, The Connector, and fun events like The Meshy Award or the current Wallpaper contest (which, I am very eager to see your entry for the contest), I develop and coordinate project timelines, proof content and design elements, manage the editorial procedures, create and/or manage the creation of the promotional materials and analyze the results. When I am not working on projects like above, I manage our conferences, advertising, promotional goodies and T-shirts, help coordinate events like our user group meetings, and well do anything and everything one might do in relation to marketing.

What are you currently working on?

I am currently juggling the coordination and promotion of our next webcast which will be about our collaboration with OpenVSP, the Wallpaper contest which allows “meshcassos” a chance to show off their grids, our November issue of The Connector, revamping how we collect and track customer demographics, prepping for the rest of the conferences for this year and next. Plus, I just finished helping prepare Pointwise’s winning poster for the International Meshing Roundtable.

Any tips, tricks, or advice for our users?

This, of course, is a selfishly motivated piece of advice: share your images of your grid—with me preferably. When I saw my first few grid images I thought these grids are functional art. The colors, the structure, the three-dimensional depth; a grid created for computational analysis is something one can also place in a frame and exhibit on a wall. In fact, I framed a turbo grid image and am giving it to my dad for a Christmas present because he found it to be so beautiful. This form of beauty should be shared; not just sit in a folder waiting to be solved on. Deadline for the Wallpaper contest is 30 October.

Have you recently read any books or articles we should know about?

I wish I did. I went from being an avid reader who would literally stay up all night to finish a book to being a person who, to no fault of the book, has been trying to complete Odd Apocalypse for at least the past four months. My next book to read will be Red Hope written by my co-worker, John Dreese. I’m quite curious to see if I will like it.

Do you plan on attending any conferences or workshops this year?

I attended AIAA Aviation this year in Dallas. We held a Pointwise reception the Sunday before the conference. It was a fun event and I enjoyed meeting new people at the reception and saying hello to familiar faces that we do not see often.

What do you do when you’re not surrounded by engineers making meshes?

I feel like I am answering a question on a dating site (I enjoy taking long walks, searching for new restaurants, eating good food, dabbling in photography, and playing the piano J). Currently, most of my time is spent trying to nurture an old 1927 home back to health. The professionals have done their magic and it is now up to me to finish the work. Time for the flooring, texturing and painting to begin. Wish me luck on the toilet and sink installations.

What is some of the best advice you’ve received?

There are two pieces of advice that have stuck with me over the years and they work well together. First is to trust yourself. When decisions overwhelm you and you don’t know which choice will take you past go, trust yourself, make the decision that feels right and then go with it.

The second piece of advice was, “Remember why you love… (insert here).” Life can be overwhelming. As a single-parent overwhelming is almost my norm but when my kid is being really annoying, or the house is falling apart or work gets too hectic, I remember why I love those things. It helps makes it easier to get through the tough moments when you remember all the good reasons you are going through them.

If you had to pick a place to have dinner, where would you go?

This decision is very dependent on my cravings that day. It’s a harder question to answer than one might think. See, I love eating. Unfortunately my culinary abilities match my love for food only in my dreams. I rank my actual abilities for cooking as, “I haven’t killed anyone yet” and, “the kitchen hasn’t completely burned down yet.” Therefore, I am on a never ending quest to find places the serve foods that match my dream culinary abilities. I recently found this at Taverna’s in downtown Fort Worth. The Risotto al Parmigiano con Salsa Tartufata was phenomenal. The texture was the perfect combination of firm and creamy and the black truffle sauce….I have no words to describe how it so perfectly complimented the risotto and brought such depth to each bite. On an average day, I love to eat at hole-in-the-wall places or food trucks that serve great food. I’m waiting for Taco Heads to complete the construction on its storefront so I can eat there more often. Their food truck’s hours do not always coordinate with my schedule. Great, I made myself hungry, time for lunch.
