        "text": "SINCE American Idol's debut, the panel has seen a rotation of judges.\n\nHere's everything viewers need to know about this season's selection of panelists.\n\nWho are the American Idol judges?\n\nReturning to the judges' table for American Idol season 22 are Lionel Richie, Katy Perry, and Luke Bryan.\n\nMeanwhile, Ryan Seacrest is back as the reality show's host.\n\nSeason 22 marks the seventh time Lionel, Katy, and Luke have returned to Idol's judges' panel.\n\nHowever, this season will be Katy's last as her time on Idol is coming to an end so she can focus on new music.\n\nKaty Perry\n\nOn May 16, 2017, Katy was the first judge to sign on for ABC's rebooted version of Idol.\n\nAt the time, the Dark Horse singer told her fans: \"I am honored and thrilled to be the first judge bringing back the American Idol tradition of making dreams come true for incredible talents with authentic personalities and real stories.\n\n\"I’m always listening to new music and love discovering diamonds in the rough.\n\n\"From mentoring young artists on my label, or highlighting new artists on my tours, I want to bring it back to the music.\"\n\nOn February 12, 2024, Katy revealed season 22 is going to be her last.\n\nThe Grammy Award nominee confirmed to Jimmy Kimmel: \"So I think this will probably be my last season for Idol.\n\n\"I love Idol so much. It’s connected me with the heart of America, but I need to feel that pulse of my own beat.\n\n\"I love the show so much but I wanna go and see the world and maybe bring new music.\"\n\nLuke Bryan\n\nOn September 24, 2017, Luke became the second judge to sign on for American Idol season 16.\n\n\"I’m so excited and proud to announce that I will be one of the three judges,\" the country music star said in a statement.\n\n\"I’m excited at the chance to help some deserving artists reach their dreams.\n\n\"To be in a position in my career to help facilitate this along with the other judges is just a complete honor. It’s gonna be a blast.\"\n\nLionel Richie\n\nOn September 29, 2017, Lionel was the third and last judge to sign on for Idol season 16.\n\nRegarding the opportunity, the Sail On hitmaker shared: \"I am very excited to be joining Katy, Luke, and Ryan on American Idol.\n\n\"As a singer, songwriter, and producer, I feel I can bring a great deal of experience to the table. It’s going to be so much fun!\"\n\nBefore he officially joined the long-running series, Lionel was in talks to join the earlier seasons but it never panned out.\n\nHe explained to The Hollywood Reporter: \"I was a touring artist, so I didn’t really lock in because I was always on the road...but I’d see it in a hotel room and pick it up here and there.\n\n\"As time went on, [original judge] Simon [Cowell] and I became very good friends.\n\n\"Simon said, 'Would you like to stop by for a minute?' And I did. I met Ryan for the first time...\n\n\"...And then segue to now, I never in a million years would think that I would be sitting here talking about, 'OK, kid, now you need to raise your voice a little more and you need to get your personality together.'\n\n\"But the point is, we have the knowledge, You wake up one morning and realize we know exactly where you are because we were there.\"\n\nWhere can I watch American Idol?\n\nOn February 18, 2024, Idol is scheduled to debut its 22nd season.\n\nEvery Sunday, viewers can tune in to a new episode at 8 pm EST via ABC.\n\nAfter the new episodes premiere, fans can stream the competition on either the ABC app or Hulu.\n\nFilming for the audition segments of the season began on September 19, 2023."
