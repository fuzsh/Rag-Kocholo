        "text": "Kelly Clarkson famously won the first-ever season of American Idol back in 2002. However, she doesn’t think she would have stood a chance if she competed against Season 2 winner Ruben Studdard.\n\nThe singer-turned-talk show host welcomed Studdard to today’s episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show, where they gushed over each other’s musical talents.\n\n“I’m not lying. You know I’ve said it for 20 years. I’m so glad we weren’t on the same season. I was like, ‘He would’ve wiped my face,'” Clarkson said, to which Studdard replied, “I actually said the exact same thing about you.”\n\nClarkson continued the trip down memory lane as she praised Studdard’s close friendship with Clay Aiken, who came in second place during his season of American Idol.\n\n“One thing I love, though, about y’alls season — you and Clay have such a great rapport, relationship, you’re so fun to be around,” she said. “You’re still touring together.”\n\nShe wasn’t not wrong. In fact, the duo recently went on a 20th anniversary tour.\n\n“It was really fun. It was fun to actually have an opportunity to meet the people that voted for us,” Studdard said. “These people brought their pictures. They brought their shirts from our Idol tour. It was really super nostalgic so we were super excited to do the tour together.”\n\nClarkson often opens up about her time on American Idol. She recently revealed that she “got in trouble” for refusing to wear makeup on the long-running singing competition show. The “Breakaway” singer also admitted that she “hates” rewatching her old performances while bonding with Season 3 winner Fantasia Barrino.\n\nAccording to Clarkson, she was once “forced” to rewatch some of her clips from Idol.\n\n“There’s not enough wine in the world,” she quipped. “Literally, I watched it — I had to watch it. Dude, I feel like if I got through that, I can do anything! I was like, ‘I did that!’”"
