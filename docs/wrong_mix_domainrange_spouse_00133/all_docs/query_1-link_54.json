        "text": "For the past 20 years, \"American Idol\" has helped discover some of the biggest names in pop, country, R&B and beyond. As “Idol” winners and contestants have had success in the music industry, many have been awarded with GRAMMY wins and nominations.\n\nSeason 20 wraps up with the finale on May 22, when HunterGirl, Leah Marlene and Noah Thompson will compete to be the latest \"American Idol\" winner. This season has seen several contestants who play instruments or are also songwriters; the talent has been touted as some of the best Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan have seen in their five seasons as judges.\n\nWill any of this year's finalists end up in the GRAMMY ranks with their \"Idol\" predecessors? Time will tell, but for now, see how many \"American Idol\" winners and contestants have scored GRAMMY Awards and GRAMMY nominations.\n\nSeason 1 winner Kelly Clarkson and Season 2 winner Ruben Studdard were the first \"Idol\" winners to be nominated for a GRAMMY, both receiving nominations in 2004. Clarkson became the first \"Idol\" winner to win a GRAMMY two years later, when she scooped up two awards: Best Pop Vocal Album for Breakaway, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for her smash \"Since U Been Gone.\"**\n\nClarkson became the first \"Idol\" contestant to win a GRAMMY for an album twice in 2013, when she won the Best Pop Vocal Album GRAMMY for 2011's Stronger. To date, Kelly Clarkson has won three GRAMMYs and has received 15 nominations.\n\nSeason 4 winner Carrie Underwood has won eight GRAMMYs and has received a total of 16 nominations, making her the \"Idol\" contestant with the most GRAMMY wins and nominations. Her most recent win came in 2022, when she won Best Roots Gospel Album for her 2021 release, My Savior.\n\nUnderwood is the only \"Idol\" winner (and contestant) to win Best New Artist. Until 2022, she was the only \"Idol\" alum to even be nominated for the coveted award, but her fellow country star Jimmie Allen joined that rare rank.\n\nAlong with Underwood, Clarkson and Studdard, Season 3 winner Fantasia Barrino and Season 6 champion Jordin Sparks are the only other winners to be nominated for a GRAMMY. Though Season 5 winner Taylor Hicks hasn't technically received a nomination, he was featured on Jimmy Fallon's 2012 album Blow Your Pants Off (on the track \"Friday\"), which won Best Comedy Album in 2013.\n\nSeason 8's Adam Lambert is the only \"Idol\" runner-up to be nominated for a GRAMMY. He was nominated for a Best Male Pop Vocal Performance GRAMMY for \"Whataya Want From Me\" in 2011.\n\nPerhaps two of the most remarkable GRAMMY-winning \"Idol\" alums are Jennifer Hudson and Tori Kelly. Each have two GRAMMYs to their name, but clearly \"Idol\" viewers and judges didn't see the star within: Hudson placed seventh on Season 3, and Kelly was cut before the top 24 on Season 9.\n\nAnother GRAMMY-nominated finalist who finished outside of the top 3 is Chris Daughtry, who placed fourth on Season 5. Daughtry has been nominated for four GRAMMYs, all of which came in 2008 thanks to his eponymous debut album and its hits \"It's Not Over\" and \"Home.\" (Fellow Season 5 contestant Ace Young co-wrote \"It's Not Over,\" making him another GRAMMY-nominated \"Idol\" star, as the single earned a Best Rock Song nomination.)\n\nMandisa, who placed ninth on Daughtry's season, is also a GRAMMY-winning finalist, as her 2013 album, Overcomer, won a Best Contemporary Christian Music Album GRAMMY in 2014. (She has received five nominations overall.)\n\nSeason 8's third place contestant, Danny Gokey, has also had a successful career in Christian music. He has been nominated for three GRAMMYs, with two of his albums receiving Best Contemporary Christian Music Album nods and his song \"Haven't Seen It Yet\" earning a Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song nom.\n\nA number of \"Idol\" alums have proven you don't have to win \"American Idol\" to win a GRAMMY or earn a GRAMMY nomination. Whatever the outcome of Season 20, be sure to keep watch on your favorite contestants — you might just see them on the GRAMMY stage one day.\n\nCarrie Underwood On Creating Her First Gospel Album, 'My Savior,' Working With CeCe Winans, & Making \"Legacy Music\"\n\nFifteen years into his career, Adam Lambert is primed for the after-party. In fact, the pop star has made an entire EP for the occasion — fittingly titled Afters.\n\nThe six-track project, which drops July 19 via More Is More Records, finds the big-voiced singer trading the expansive covers of his last LP, 2023's High Drama, for a no-holds-barred romp that takes listeners from the club to the after-party to the bedroom and beyond.\n\n\"It's my love letter to our nightlife culture,\" Lambert tells GRAMMY.com on a phone call from New York City. And though he admits to recording the bulk of Afters in L.A., the project is imbued with the club kid spirit of New York's queer community — from the primal sexuality dripping off dual lead singles \"LUBE\" and \"WET DREAM\" to the strutting, ballroom-ready kiss-off (and nearly NSFW title) of follow-up track \"CVNTY.\"\n\nAhead of the EP's release, the queer GRAMMY nominee (and frequent Queen collaborator) celebrated his new musical chapter with a special party at The Standard High Line's nightclub Le Bain. Organized by legendary NYC nightlife impresario Susanne Bartsch as part of her famous On Top! event series, the soiree felt like a full-circle moment for Lambert as he watched drag artists like God Complex and ShowPonii slay the house down boots to his new music.\n\n\"I've always really been drawn to that kind of world,\" Lambert says of the thriving LGBTQIA+ party scene. \"I think even way back before '[American] Idol,' I remember being in L.A., when I was in my early twenties and trying to find the parties. They were pretty underground at the time, where people would dress up and wear crazy makeup. And of course, I was there in my platform boots, stompin' in. So I've always sort of sought out that community. I love it.\"\n\nBelow, Lambert takes GRAMMY.com through the colorful and unapologetically queer inspirations that led to Afters, from the '90s house sounds of Crystal Waters to finding freedom in radical creative expression — and, of course, plenty of sex.\n\nFeeling Free — And Sexy\n\nI've always loved electronic dance music, I've always loved house. And it's interesting because, for a long time, it was considered sort of \"niche\" for a gay person to make dance music. And now it just feels like it makes sense. [Laughs.] It's so obvious, you know?\n\nI was working so hard for so long and on tour for so long, and I did a lot of tours with Queen and on my own stuff. I was so focused on my career for so many years, and then as the pandemic kind of faded and we were getting into that next chapter, I made some time for a social life. Which was much needed. That's what kind of inspired me to want to make this music.\n\nI just wanted to make something that felt like my actual social life — that felt like my life. I'm in a relationship, we've made lots of friends in L.A., we have lots of after-parties. We socialize, we go out, we go to clubs, we go to bars. I wanted to make music for that.\n\nMy private life is...exciting is how I would probably put it, and passionate. So it's definitely fueled from that. The music is written in first person, but it's also sort of meant to inspire the listener to want to feel that type of freedom as well. You listen to something about sex and hopefully it makes you go, \"Yeah! I feel sexy!\"\n\nOvercoming Post-'American Idol' PTSD\n\nWhen I first came out the gate after Idol, I did a big old performance [at the 2009 American Music Awards]. I got in trouble for kissing the guy and having sexy dance moves and stuff, and that gave me a little dash of almost a PTSD of, like, \"Oh, OK, there's a line that I can't cross. And if I do, I could risk losing everything.\" And that fear drove me down a certain path where I felt like I had to hold back a certain amount.\n\nThat was very much a reflection of where we were at as a society at the time, and what the mainstream was able to digest. The music industry was a different game back then. There were a lot more gatekeepers, a lot more obstacles that I encountered. Now, the industry has shifted so much, just in terms of how people get music, how you can reach your listener, how you can make music, what kind of label situation you have set up. There's a lot less filtering going on. That's what also inspired me to want to make something that was more liberated.\n\nMy perspective has shifted a lot. That fear early on came from a place of, \"I don't want to lose this opportunity.\" There was a little dash of imposter syndrome in there. You know, coming off of \"Idol,\" feeling like, \"Oh my god, how did I get here?\" It happened so fast. And I think just having stayed in the game over the last 14 years has given me a sense of confidence. It's given me a sense of belonging.\n\nI've found more of who exactly I am over that time. Working with Queen has been a real boost in confidence as well, and has allowed me to sort of feel like I've earned something.\n\nSetting The Mood\n\nI love music that puts you in a mood, in a headspace. And that's what I wanted Afters to be. That's why I called it Afters. It was, yes, you could totally listen to these at a club, but it's also, like, lyrically, when you go to a club and then you go to an afterparty, the rules are out the window. You can do whatever you want, you know? And people feel that freedom.\n\nThere's something to be said about growing up a bit and maturing as a performer. You feel less of a need to prove something [vocally]. I think I'm finding less of an impulse to be, like, \"Look what I can do!\" and more, \"Look what I can make you feel.\" The \"less is more\" thing does start to become more obvious.\n\nAs I've gotten a little older, too, my voice has shifted a bit. And I have, like, lower parts of my voice that I haven't really dug into before that I definitely did on this project. Which is kind of a fun experiment. I just wanted to do something that was more vibey.\n\n'90s House & '20s Hyperpop\n\nI like going into a project with, like, a reference and a direction. It gives you sort of a roadmap…I have a whole playlist of newer stuff that I kept adding. A lot of it's somewhat obscure, but then there's artists out there that I think are really cool, like Slayyyter [or] COBRAH. A lot of the DJs that I really like — Chris Lake is amazing. Even stuff like Disclosure… I really love them. I just wanted to make music that made me move.\n\nI found myself gravitating towards a similar sound over and over again — sort of a dirty house, kind of sexy tech-house sound. Certain textures and sonics that I started noticing as a pattern of the stuff that I liked.\n\nI love a good, soulful house vocal, always…Like Crystal Waters or any of those. I love that, like, '90s house vibe. And obviously \"DEEP HOUSE\" [on Afters] has a little bit of that. So does \"WET DREAM,\" where you get into that soulful pocket. It's so fun to sing from that place.\n\nQueer Voices In The Studio\n\nIt was really important for me to make sure there were queer people in the room when I was writing these songs. Back when I was first starting, the major label writing setups that I was put into, there weren't many queer people. And that's changed so much — there's more and more queer people in the music space. Definitely top-line songwriters, and then even more and more, I'm finding producers that identify as queer, and that's really exciting. 'Cause it makes everybody less afraid and just willing to sort of go for it.\n\n\"WET DREAM,\" I did with Sarah Hudson and JHART and Ferras, who I've known for ages. Vincint and Parson James worked with me on \"LUBE.\" Just people that I really admire. Vincint did some background vocals on \"LUBE,\" actually, which is cute. Vincint and I did a collab on his project recently as well, so that was cool that we got to each kind of add to each other's project.\n\nA lot of the songwriters are friends of mine who I've known for a long time. I was like, \"Do you want to do a song?\" Which makes the writing process so much fun.\n\nQueer Rebellion & Sexual Healing\n\nI think, right now, people want to find freedom. I think people want to find an escape. There is a lot of sociopolitical energy right now that's kind of dark and negative, that's coming at us from the right wing, super-conservative side of the world. Some of that can make us feel dark as well, and kind of discouraged.\n\nBut I also think there's a lot of us, including myself, that feel like that lights a bit of a rebellious flame in us, and makes us want to shine brighter and be bolder and be wilder and crazier than we are. And [I] see that out and about: people are more and more expressive, emotionally, with their identity [and] how they want to explore [it].\n\nThere are members of our community that want to explore their gender identity; there are members of our community that want to explore their feminine side or their masculine side. There's, I think, more acceptance in that exploration and that expression right now than there's ever been. It's f—ing great. It's always been there in the [LGBTQIA+] community, but you're just seeing it on display a little bit more. People are more comfortable going there and exploring it, and I love that.\n\nThere's less and less shame around sex than there's ever been. We're more mainstream than we've ever been — there's more with social media and [pauses] other types of media on the internet. And that's really exciting. 'Cause sex is f—ing great. And healing, and wonderful, and exciting. It's our human right to explore our sexuality, and I see more people feeling freer in that.\n\nFinishing With A Climax\n\nOne of the Afters songs, \"FACE,\" was actually created a while ago. I wrote that with Pete Nappi, like…four-ish years ago? During the pandemic, I think. But it sounded very different. And once I started getting more house tunes together, I kinda was like, \"OK, can we take this idea and evolve it into a higher BPM and a dancier kind of direction?\"\n\nWe sped it up, we added a bigger beat to it, more of a four-on-the-floor feel to make it feel \"club.\" But it's definitely the last track on the EP for a reason. 'Cause it slows down compared to the other songs a bit. If the rest of the EP is foreplay, it's sort of like the home run. [Laughs.] It's like once you get that person that you've been into all night into the bed, what happens?\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nWatch Henry Moodie Share His Epiphone Guitar\n\nStill Barking After All These Years: Dr. Dog On Low-Key Longevity And Their New Self-Titled Album\n\nCults' Evolution: Madeline Follin & Brian Oblivion Discuss Their Upcoming Album 'To The Ghosts'\n\nKoe Wetzel On How New Album '9 Lives' Helped Him Tap Into His Feelings\n\nThe New GRAMMY GO Music Production Course Is Now Open: Featuring GRAMMY Winners Hit-Boy, CIRKUT, Judith Sherman & More\n\nAfter the cookouts and kickbacks of Memorial Day weekend, getting through the workweek is never easy. But you made it through — and now it's time for another weekend of however you decompress. As always, killer jams and musical food for thought have arrived down the pipeline.\n\nAs you freshen up your late-spring playlist, don't miss these offerings by artists across generations, moods, genres, and vibes — from K-pop to classic country and beyond.\n\nEminem — \"Houdini\"\n\nIt looks like Dua Lipa isn't the only artist to name-drop Erik Weisz this year. In a recent Instagram video with magician David Blaine, Eminem hinted at a major career move, quipping, \"For my last trick, I'm going to make my career disappear,\" as Blaine casually noshed on a broken wineglass.\n\nWith Em's next album titled The Death of Slim Shady, fans were left in a frenzy — was he putting the mic down for good? If \"Houdini\" is in fact part of Eminem's final act, it seems he'll be paying homage to his career along the way: the song includes snippets of Em classics \"Without Me,\" \"The Real Slim Shady,\" \"Just Lose It\" and \"My Name Is.\"\n\nThe superhero comic-themed video also calls back to some of the rapper's iconic moments, including the \"Without Me\" visual and his 2000 MTV Video Music Awards performance. It also features cameos from the likes of Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, and Pete Davidson — making for a star-studded thrill ride of a beginning to what may be his end.\n\nRead More: Is Eminem's “Stan” Based On A True Story? 10 Facts You Didn't Know About The GRAMMY-Winning Rapper\n\nMaya Hawke — 'Chaos Angel'\n\n\"What the Chaos Angel is to me,\" Maya Hawke explained in a recent Instagram video, \"is an angel that was raised in heaven to believe they're the angel of love, then sent down to do loving duties.\"\n\nChaos Angel, the third album by Maya Hawke, out via Mom+Pop Records, is an alt-rock treasure with a psychologically penetrating bent. Smoldering tracks like \"Dark\" and \"Missing Out\" plumb themes of betrayal and bedlam masterfully.\n\nJessie Reyez & Big Sean — \"Shut Up\"\n\nBefore May 31, Jessie Reyez's 2024 releases have come in the form of airy contributions for Bob Marley: One Love and Rebel Moon. And for the first release of her own, she's bringing the heat.\n\nTeaming up with fellow rapper Big Sean for \"Shut Up,\" Reyez delivers some fiery lines on the thumping track: \"They b—es plastic, that b— is a catfish, oh-so dramatic/ And I'm sittin' pretty with my little-ass t—es winnin' pageants.\" Big Sean throws down, too: \"B—, better read the room like you telepromptin'/ And watch how you speak to a n—a 'cause I'm not them.\"\n\nFoster the People — \"Lost In Space\"\n\nIndie dance-pop favorites Foster The People — yes, of the once-inescapable \"Pumped Up Kicks\" fame — are back with their first new music since 2017's Sacred Hearts Club. The teaser for their future-forward, disco-powered new song, \"Lost in Space,\" brings a psychedelic riot of colors to your eyeballs.\n\nThe song is equally as trippy. Over a swirling, disco-tinged techno beat, the group bring their signature echoing vocals to the funky track, which feels like the soundtrack to an '80s adventure flick.\n\n\"Lost in Space\" is the first taste of Foster The People's forthcoming fourth studio album, Paradise State of Mind, which will arrive Aug. 16. If the lead single is any indication — along with frontman Mark Foster's tease that the album started \"as a case study of the late Seventies crossover between disco, funk, gospel, jazz, and all those sounds\" — fans are in for quite the psychedelic ride.\n\nArooj Aftab — 'Night Reign'\n\nArooj Aftab landed on the scene with the exquisitely blue Vulture Prince, which bridged modern jazz and folk idioms with what she calls \"heritage material\" from Pakistan and South Asia. The album's pandemic-era success threatened to box her in, though; Aftab is a funny, well-rounded cat who's crazy about pop music, too. Crucially, the guest-stuffed Night Reign shows many more sides of this GRAMMY-winning artist — her sound is still instantly recognizable, but has a more iridescent tint — a well-roundedness. By the strength of songs like \"Raat Ki Rani\" and \"Whiskey,\" and the patina of guests like Moor Mother and Vijay Iyer, this Reign is for the long haul.\n\nLearn More: Arooj Aftab, Vijay Iyer & Shahzad Ismaily On New Album Love In Exile, Improvisation Versus Co-Construction And The Primacy Of The Pulse\n\nWillie Nelson — 'The Border'\n\nBy some counts, Willie Nelson has released more than 150 albums — try and let that soak in. The Red Headed Stranger tends to crank out a Buddy Cannon-produced album or two per year in his autumn years, each with a slight conceptual tilt: bluegrass, family matters, tributes to Harlan Howard or the Great American Songbook. Earthy, muted The Border is another helping of the good stuff — this time homing in on songwriters like Rodney Crowell (\"The Border\"), Shawn Camp (\"Made in Texas\") and Mike Reid (\"Nobody Knows Me Like You.\") Elsewhere, Nelson-Cannon originals like \"What If I'm Out of My Mind\" and \"How Much Does It Cost\" fold it all into the 12-time GRAMMY winner's manifold musical universe.\n\nExplore More: Listen To GRAMMY.com's Outlaw Country Playlist: 32 Songs From Honky Tonk Heroes Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Merle Haggard & More\n\nATEEZ — 'GOLDEN HOUR : Part.1'\n\nSouth Korean boy band ATEEZ last released new material with late 2023's The World EP.Fin: Will. Now, they're bringing the K-pop fire once again with their 10th mini-album, GOLDEN HOUR Part.1.\n\nReleased in a rainbow of physical editions, the release was teased by a short clip for \"WORK,\" where ATEEZ pans for gold like old prospectors in an off-kilter desert scene, then proceeds to throw the mother of all parties. As for the rest of GOLDEN HOUR, they bring flavors of reggaeton (\"Blind), wavy R&B (\"Empty Box\") and reggae (\"Shaboom\") — further displaying their versatility as a group, and setting an exciting stage for Part.2.\n\nLearn More: Inside The GRAMMY Museum's ATEEZ & Xikers Pop-Up: 5 Things We Learned\n\nAyra Starr — 'The Year I Turned 21'\n\nBeninese-Nigerian singer and GRAMMY nominee for Best African Music Performance Ayra Starr pays homage to the big two-one with her second album, The Year I Turned 21, which she's been teasing all month. We've seen the crimson, windswept cover art; we've soaked up the 14 track titles, which reveal collaborations with the likes of ASAKE, Anitta, Coco Jones, and Giveon. Now, after small tastes in singles \"Commas,\"\"Rhythm & Blues\" and \"Santa\" (with Rvssian and Rauw Alejandro), we can behold what the \"Rush\" star has called \"excellent, sonically amazing\" and \"unique, because I've been evolving sonically.\"\n\nWatch: Ayra Starr’s Most Essential “Item” On The Road Is Her Brother | Herbal Tea & White Sofas\n\nAdam Lambert — \"LUBE\" & \"WET DREAM\"\n\nThe \"American Idol\" and Queen + Adam Lambert star is turning heads — for very good reason. He's going to release AFTERS, a new EP of house music and an unflinching exploration of queerness and sex-positivity. \"I throw many house parties and my aim was to create a soundtrack inspired by wild nights, giving a voice to our communities' hedonistic desires and exploits,\" Lambert explained in a press release.\n\nThe first two singles, \"LUBE\" and \"WET DREAM,\" achieve exactly that. From the pulsing beat of \"LUBE\" (along with the \"Move your body like I do\" demand of the chorus) to the racing melody of \"WET DREAM,\" it's clear AFTERS will bring listeners straight to a sweaty dance floor — right where Lambert wants them.\n\nWallows Talk New Album Model, \"Entering Uncharted Territory\" With World Tour & That Unexpected Sabrina Carpenter Cover\n\nAn event Presenting Sponsor, Sephora had makeup artists set up next to the stage, giving guests some glam. Participating sponsors Dyson and The Hartford also had activations for guests to enjoy; Dyson provided styling stations for hair touch-ups and curated an immersive listening experience with the Dyson Zone™ noise-canceling headphones, while The Hartford hosted an interactive, augmented reality graffiti wall.\n\nAs Sephora's SVP of Personalization, Anna E. Banks explained on stage, the brand is committed to creating \"the world's most inclusive beauty community.\" She added that Sephora supports individuals' creativity and ingenuity — whether it's through the products they choose to sell or the looks they feature in their campaigns. As one of the brand's new programs, Sephora Sounds will work to \"continue to push for more diversity and representation\" across the industry, \"breaking down barriers and ushering in marginalized voices.\"\n\nKeynote speaker Ty Stiklorius brought much of the room to tears with tales of sleazy record execs, thwarted dreams, and how she took the road less traveled to decades of success in the music industry. Donning a stunning maroon suit, Stiklorius detailed how she became not only John Legend's manager, but also his film and TV producing partner, his business partner in several companies, and the co-founder of several social impact groups working to reduce incarceration and level the playing field in terms of universal opportunity.\n\n\"It's literally impossible to be a woman,\" Stiklorious said, quoting America Ferrera's powerful speech from the Barbie movie. She expressed frustration at the fact that women are always expected to be extraordinary — whether it's as a wife, a mother, or in the workplace — and dismissed antiquated notions that women can't be leaders in the music industry while having a family. To wit, Stiklorious created her company, Friends At Work, to give more women and more marginalized people a place to thrive in the industry, to be appreciated, recognized, and paid appropriately.\n\nAfter all, Stiklorious reminded the room, women still have a long, long way to go to achieve any sort of parity in the music industry. While women dominate the major categories at this year's GRAMMY Awards, a recent study by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that, while women make up more than half the population and the market for music, they only take up about 35 percent of the Billboard Hot 100. Only 6.5 percent of music producers are women, and less than 20 percent of the songwriters of last year's top songs were women. In fact, Stiklorious said, \"nearly a quarter of the most popular songs of the last 12 years were penned by just 12 men.\"\n\n\"Think about how those 12 men are shaping audience perfections and beliefs about romantic relationships, wealth, health, and any number of topics,\" Stiklorious said, before referencing a story she recently wrote for the L.A. Times in which she makes the case that, if the top women performers added just two women songwriters to some of their sessions and some of their songs, we'd reach gender parity in the songwriter space in just four years.\n\n\"It's not that big of an ask, actually,\" she said. \"With the growing power of female performers, those who routinely top the charts can change the lives of women songwriters and our culture, because the status quo isn't good for anyone, regardless of their gender identity, we all lose out on untapped and underappreciated talent.\"\n\nThe end of Stiklorious' speech was met with a rousing standing ovation.\n\nAfter performances from Beth Million and Rawan Chaya, People Executive Editor Melody Chiu took the stage for the event's panel, which featured recording engineer Marcella Araica, GRAMMY winning country artist Carly Pearce, and GRAMMY nominee Jordin Sparks. They talked about role models, the barriers they've faced in the industry, becoming mothers, and how they learned that \"no\" is actually a complete sentence.\n\nSinger/songwriter Emily King won the room over with tracks like \"Medal\" and \"This Year.\" After King's set, Ruby Marchand, the Recording Industry's Chief Awards and Industry Officer, wrapped up the event by thanking members of the Recording Academy staff and board in the audience for their hard work on the event and in driving new membership.\n\nDiving into her thoughts on the concept of trust, Marchand said women in the music industry \"have to learn to trust each other, because we're here to help and guide and support, and sometimes even help somebody through some critical thinking and get back on track.\"\n\nWomen in the industry also have to learn to trust themselves, Marchand said. If women can all learn to be fearless and to trust in themselves, their decisions, and their strength, the sky's the limit.\n\nThe Recording Academy's GRAMMY House Returns For GRAMMY Week 2024; Immersive Pop-Up Experience To Feature The Third Annual #GRAMMYSNEXTGEN Party"
