        "text": "'Dark Horse' singer Katy Perry knows what she wants in the New Year, and she is going to do everything to manifest it.\n\nKaty Perry and her longtime fiancé, 'The Hobbit' actor Orlando Bloom, are currently planning a wedding in 2024, but that is not the thing she is manifesting this year.\n\nSo, what is it that the 'American Idol' judge wants to make happen in 2024?\n\nKaty Perry Reveals The One Thing She Wants In 2024\n\nKaty Perry has always been full of energy and positive vibes, so it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise that the one thing she is manifesting in 2024 is \"a great time.\"\n\nThe pop icon took to her Instagram Story to share a video of her pouring De Soi, a non-alcoholic beverage, which she co-founded, to help promote Dry January. When pouring the beverage, she says she is going to 'have a great time' in the New Year, helping to prove that you don't need alcohol to have fun.\n\nAccording to their website, De Soi is \"blended with mood-boosting adaptogens like L-theanine and ashwagandha\" and each of the flavors \"gives you the buzz you crave without the booze.\"\n\nKaty Perry wore a puffy purple dress as she sported dark makeup and bright red lipstick while promoting the De Soi drink brand.\n\nThe company's mission is, \"We put the fun in functional. Inspired by the French ethos of pleasure and restraint, De Soi is a range of non-alcoholic apéritifs made with natural adaptogens.\"\n\nPerry is a co-founder of De Soi. She stated that she was looking for a way to \"make a more considered choice for happy hour.\"\n\nKaty Has Big 2024 Plans\n\nLast year, Katy Perry revealed that a wedding with Orlando Bloom is still being planned, but the couple were having trouble deciding on a location.\n\n\"There's still a plan, but the location is challenging,\" Perry revealed on 'The Drew Barrymore Show' last September. \"I love a big celebration. I am all about big, fun, exotic, great celebrations. So, hopefully, soon.\"\n\nAlthough the journey to finding her better half was challenging, she said after she put in the work, she found love with 'Pirates of the Caribbean' actor Orlando Bloom.\n\n\"I've always had a 'am I enough' hang up. I've always had a challenging time with love and relationships and maybe not being attracted to the right kind of people sometimes,\" Perry said on the talk show last year. \"And to be attracted to someone who is kind and consistent and showed up for me. So I did all the work to do that and it's paid off.\"\n\nKaty Perry and Orlando Bloom are parents to their daughter, Daisy. \"I wanted to change all of the energy and Orlando and I were very intentional on having Daisy,\" Perry explained. \"We had decided, it was no accident. It was time.\"\n\nAt this time, there is no date planned for Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom's wedding, but fans can expect it to happen sometime this year."
