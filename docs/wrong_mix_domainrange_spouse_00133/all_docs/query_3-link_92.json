        "text": "It seems Russell Brand has changed his mind about his “death do us part” pledge.\n\nThe British comedian filed for divorce Friday after 14 months of marriage to singer Katy Perry. Documents filed in Los Angeles cite “irreconcilable differences.”\n\nEarlier this month on Ellen DeGeneres’ talk show Brand, 36, denied divorce rumors, saying, “I’m really happily married. … I’m married to Katy. Perpetually, until death do us part was the pledge. I’m still alive.”\n\nAlive, yes. Genuine, not so much.\n\n“Sadly, Katy and I are ending our marriage,” Brand said in a statement Friday. “I’ll always adore her and I know we’ll remain friends.”\n\nThat remains to be seen. TMZ reports that Brand’s filing may have caught Perry, 27, by surprise. In the divorce documents, Brand also asks that each party pays his or her own attorney fees and that rights to their “community property assets” be determined.\n\nUh-oh, sounds like someone forgot to get an ironclad prenup.\n\nThe end appeared imminent after the couple spent Christmas apart, reportedly because of a massive fight. While Perry was pictured swimming sans wedding ring in Hawaii, Brand was spotted 7,000 miles away at a pub in his native England. In the days that followed, Brand was photographed minus his wedding ring, too.\n\nThe couple met at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards and were engaged four months later. They married in a lavish ceremony — complete with elephants — in October 2010 in India.\n\nThey hardly seemed like a well-suited couple, what with Brand’s brash comedy and Perry’s upbringing in an evangelical home.\n\nStill, they were effusive in their praise for each other.\n\nBrand, who overcame substance abuse and sex addiction, credited Perry in March for giving him strength. “For a long while, what I do professionally was all that mattered to me really,” he said. “Now I think, well, whatever I do, I’ll just go back to her, and that’s incredibly comforting.”\n\nPerry seemed ready for a lifelong commitment too.\n\n“He’s someone I can count on, a life partner,” she told USA Today in August 2010. “And I’m wildly attracted to him. I do feel a little bit like Priscilla Presley.”\n\nPerhaps that wasn’t the best analogy, considering Elvis and Priscilla didn’t live happily-ever-after either.\n\nNO CRUISE, NO DUBAI, LOHAN STICKING CLOSE TO HOME: In a quiet week on the Lindsay Lohan news front, we finally have something to report: The actress will be ringing in 2012 from her home in Los Angeles.\n\nThis is news?\n\nSadly, it became news when erroneous reports started surfacing about where the 25-year-old would be spending New Year’s Eve. First, she was to attend a celeb fete aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2 cruise ship. Not true, her rep said. Next up, she was jetting off to a private party in Dubai. Also false, the rep said.\n\n“She will be spending New Year’s Eve in Los Angeles with a few close friends and family.” her publicist clarified.\n\nYawn!\n\n‘BRIDESMAIDS’ ACTOR TO PLAY THE GROOM: In a week that has already seen a half dozen reported celebrity engagements, “Bridesmaids” actor Chris O’Dowd added his own to the list.\n\nO’Dowd, 32, proposed to girlfriend and British TV personality Dawn Porter, 32, the day after Christmas while vacationing in Guernsey.\n\n“I’m so bored of all this happiness and sex. I’m getting married,” O’Dowd tweeted Thursday.\n\nPorter added via Twitter: “I guess he liked it, coz (sic) he put a ring on it. #engaged.”\n\nYOU’D THINK SHE KNOWS BETTER: Say it isn’t so. Rihanna and Chris Brown posted “love” tweets that appear to be meant for each other.\n\nBreezy (aka Brown) kicked things off by writing, “Love U more than u know!”\n\nTwo minutes later, Ri-Ri (as in, Rihanna) replied, “I’ll always love you #1love.”\n\nPerhaps Rihanna opened the door earlier this month when she appeared to communicate via Twitter with Brown’s mother, who wrote (in all caps), “Hello lady I miss you and love you!!!!!! You know who you are!!!!!” To which Rihanna responded, “Miss+Love u 2”\n\nIt makes one miss the days when telephones kept such insanity private.\n\nRihanna and Chris Brown’s violent breakup in 2009 left Rihanna badly bruised and Brown facing felony charges of assault and making criminal threats. He eventually pleaded guilty to felony assault and was sentenced to community labor and anger management treatment.\n\nNOT WANTED — DOG FECES-SMELLING RENTAL: There’s a big stink brewing in Georgia.\n\nAcademy Award-winning “Precious” actress Mo’Nique is suing her landlords because, in part, her house smells like dog feces, wet dog and urine. Oh yeah, and there’s an overflowing septic tank, mold problem and broken security gate.\n\nMo’Nique is demanding she be let out of her $22,000-a-month rental contract. The actress signed a two-year lease in March. She filed her lawsuit in response to a suit by her landlords, who claim she owes $370,000 in unpaid rent and other charges. The actress says she had a verbal agreement with the landlords that allowed her to vacate the contract with 60 days notices because of the problems.\n\nNEW BEAU FOR LADY GAGA: For the dozen or so who care, Lady Gaga has gone public with her boyfriend, Taylor Kinney of “Vampire Diaries.”\n\nBut wait, there’s more. The couple are reportedly shopping for houses in Pennsylvania. And holding hands in public.\n\nOK, that’s it. Now back to the real news.\n\nRAPPER AVOIDS MORE TIME IN SLAMMER: Rapper Flesh-n-Bone struck a plea deal and won’t face additional jail time for allegedly beating his wife, TMZ reports.\n\nThe “Bone Thugs-n-Harmony” rapper — whose real name is Stanley Howse — was arrested in January and later charged with inflicting corporal injury on a spouse, threatening her and false imprisonment.\n\nAs part of the deal, Howse pleaded guilty to false imprisonment in exchange for dropping the other charges. He was sentenced to three years probation, time served in jail, 100 hours of community service, participation in a domestic violence program and $400 donation to a battered women’s shelter.\n\nHowse’s attorney Shepard Kopp told TMZ, “Flesh has always maintained his innocence of these charges, but it was best for his family and Bone Thugs to put this case behind him.”\n\nRAT PACK PERFORMER DIES: Singer and actress Kaye Stevens, who rose to fame by performing with the Rat Pack, died Wednesday in Central Florida following a battle with breast cancer and blood clots. She was 79.\n\nStevens performed with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and Joey Bishop during her career. She also sang solo at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas and the Plaza Hotel’s Persian Room in New York City. A favorite of Johnny Carson’s, she also frequently appeared as a guest on “The Tonight Show.”\n\nHer big break came while she was playing a lounge at The Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas. When illness sidelined Debbie Reynolds, Stevens stepped in to perform in the main room and became an instant hit.\n\nShe also appeared in six movies, earning a Golden Globe nomination in 1964 for “The New Interns.”\n\nTODAY IN HISTORY\n\nToday is Saturday, Dec. 31, the 365th and final day of 2011.\n\n1759: Arthur Guinness founded his famous brewery at St. James’s Gate in Dublin.\n\n1775: during the Revolutionary War, the British repulsed an attack by Continental Army generals Richard Montgomery and Benedict Arnold at Quebec; Montgomery was killed.\n\n1879: Thomas Edison first publicly demonstrated his electric incandescent light in Menlo Park, N.J.\n\n1909: the Manhattan Bridge, spanning the East River between Manhattan and Brooklyn, was officially opened to vehicular traffic.\n\n1946: President Harry S.

Actress Eileen Heckart died in Norwalk, Conn., at age 82.\n\n2006: The death toll for Americans killed in the Iraq War reached 3,000. Hundreds of Iraqis flocked to the village of Ouja (OO’-juh) where Saddam Hussein was born to see the deposed leader buried in a religious compound 24 hours after his execution. Ordinary Americans paid their respects to former President Gerald R. Ford, walking slowly by his flag-covered casket in the U.S. Capitol.\n\n2010: Tornadoes fueled by unusually warm air pummeled the South and Midwest, killing a total of eight people in Arkansas and Missouri.
