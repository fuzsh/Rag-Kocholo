        "text": "When watching Netflix's Virgin River, it's hard to realize that the actors that play Mel and Jack aren't together in real life — Alexandra Breckenridge and Martin Henderson are just THAT good at acting and have incredible chemistry.\n\nBut Virgin River fans will be thrilled to know that Alexandra has been happily married since 2015, and it seems her real-life relationship is a lot less drama filled than her on-screen one.\n\nAlexandra, who also played Sophie in NBC's This Is Us, is married to Katy Perry's lead guitarist Casey Hooper. Casey is also a member of the band SurfMaster and was featured in Katy Perry's documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me.\n\nThe couple met years ago at a Grammys after party while they were both living in California. At the time, Alexandra was pursuing her acting career and securing roles in shows, including American Horror Story and The Walking Dead. Casey was nearing the end of a world tour with pop-star Katy Perry.\n\nThe pair hit it off immediately and eventually had an intimate wedding in Dunton Springs, Colorado, on September 13, 2015.\n\nA year after they got married, the couple welcomed their first son, Jack (the name is a little ironic, isn't it), and 15 short months after their daughter Billie was born. The family of four left the City of Angels behind for a quieter family life in a two story home in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n“The rural areas of Georgia have an amazing sense of community we were lacking in L.A.,” Alexandra told Atlanta Magazine in 2019. Outside of Atlanta (a.k.a the Hollywood of the South), the couple is still able to pursue their careers in entertainment while prioritizing family time and a slower pace of life that they couldn't find in Los Angeles.\n\nSo, what about Martin Henderson's relationship status? Well, it's a little complicated. The 48-year-old New Zealand native has never been married.\n\nHe is currently in a relationship with an interior designed named Penny, who he lives with in New Zealand. Before Penny, Henderson was in a serious relationship with Mexican Instagram influencer Aisha Mendez, though they broke up in January 2021.\n\nSo, there you have it. While Mel and Jack aren't together in real life, Alexandra certainly has her fairytale love story!"
