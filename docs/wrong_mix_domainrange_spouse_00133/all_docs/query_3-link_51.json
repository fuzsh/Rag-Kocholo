I'm like 'Here's the calendar, pin it, this is exactly where I'm going to be on this day,' and it's amazing and we plan way, way ahead.\"\n\nThat same year, Perry confessed things aren't always smooth sailing between the two.\n\n\"Orlando and I‚Äôs initials are O.K. We continuously put in the work to make sure they aren‚Äôt üö®K.O. [knocked out]üö®,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"Find yourself a partner that will go down to the mat with you and get back up every time. I love you my fighter @orlandobloom ü•ä‚ô•Ô∏è.\"\n\nIn the comments section of the upload, the British actor penned, \"I love you and our love ‚ù§Ô∏è bombsüí•wouldn't have it any other way üòç.\"\n\nThe pair became engaged in 2019, but in 2022, the pop star admitted they didn't have a wedding date yet.\n\n\"There's still a plan but the location is challenging,\" she spilled on an episode of The Drew Barrymore Show. \"I love a big celebration. I am all about big, fun, exotic, great celebrations. So, hopefully, soon.\""
