After a brief chat with Chef Natasha about her life before Bravo, a difficult childhood and troubled marriage, and Michelin-star restaurant (now ranked number one in the world) that she worked in, we get into what ya all wanna talk about, this current season of Below Deck Sailing Yacht. Natasha chats with us about how she was cast, what filming was like, and how she is handling watching herself each week on the TV as the show airs. Natasha is more than game to answer our rapid fire questions about all of her cast mates including seasoned Bravo vet Captain Glenn. Speaking of her cast mates, there seems to be something brewing in the coming weeks with Chief Stew Daisy Kelliher which we had to, and were more than eager, to ask Natasha about. Coming off a season of probably the best chef in Below Deck history, we chatted with Natasha about Chef Rachel - where they met and became friends -, other past Below Deck Chefs, and whether she felt pressure to fill Rachel‚Äôs shoes. Natasha explained the similarities and differences between being a cast member on Below Deck Sailing Yacht and a ‚Äúreal life‚Äù charter, pet peeves of colleagues as well as charter guests, who she would replace of her current season‚Äôs cast mates, the best and worst thing about the Bravo experience, any regrets she had, how it changed her as a person and last, but certainly not least, how she wants to be remembered from this season of Below Deck Sailing Yacht. Of course having Chef Natasha at our disposal, we chat about food - the best restaurants in the world, what foods are overrated, what foods are underrated, any food pet peeves she has, and how easy is she to go to dinner with when someone else is cooking. Yup, we cover it all! @living_vicariously_through_me @behindvelvetrope @davidyontef #belowdeck #sailingyacht #bravotv #chefnatashaüë©‚Äçüç≥ üë©‚Äçüç≥ üë©‚Äçüç≥\".",
