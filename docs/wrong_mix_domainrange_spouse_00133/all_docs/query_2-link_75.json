        "text": "In the American equivalent of Channel 5 snapping up Big Brother after its cancellation by Channel 4, it looks as if American Idol could soon be back on US TV… on a totally new network.\n\nIt's very early days but The Hollywood Reporter has revealed that Idol producers Fremantle are currently in talks with NBC to revive the once-mighty musical competition for primetime soon.\n\nSuch a deal would be a massive shock since American Idol originally aired for 15 seasons on NBC's rival network Fox, wrapping up less than a year ago with a star-studded finale on April 7, 2016.\n\nThere's no indication exactly where American Idol would fit in NBC's primetime schedule, since the network has autumn and spring covered, with The Voice and America's Got Talent in the summers.\n\nObviously there is no judging panel lined up at this very early stage, but it's worth noting that original American Idol judge Simon Cowell does have a relationship with NBC as both producer and star of America's Got Talent.\n\nCowell originally helped spin off the UK hit Pop Idol for Fox in the US back in 2002, but left nine seasons later to concentrate on Fox's short-lived US version of The X Factor.\n\nFox made the decision to end American Idol with its 15th season in 2016 after years of ratings decline.\n\nIts series finale reached a three-year surge of 13 million viewers - but that was a far cry from the 22.77 million who tuned in at the end of season one or the 38.1 million who tuned in to see Ruben Studdard named winner in 2003.\n\nAt the 2016 TCA press tour, Fox chairmen and CEOs Gary Newman and Dana Walden admitted it was a \"pretty emotional\" decision to drop the show that had once been the network's biggest hit.\n\n\"You know, it was not an easy decision. American Idol has been such a vital part of Fox for its run and we spent a lot of time talking with producers about the future of American Idol,\" Newman explained.\n\n\"Collectively we arrived at the conclusion that it was time to bring the show to an end. But we wanted to do it in a way that felt special and celebratory and treated the show the way it deserved to be treated.\"\n\nWe're sure Fox isn't very pleased by the prospect of its one-time cash-cow ending up on a rival network. NBC has yet to confirm or deny that it is in talks with Fremantle."
