His debut album, Soulful, reached the number one position on the Billboard 200. He has since released seven other albums.\n\nIn 2008, he starred as the lead character in the national tour of the musical Ain’t Misbehavin’.\n\nFantasia Barrino (Season 3)\n\nFantasia’s version of the jazz standard “Summertime” is commonly regarded as one of the best performances in American Idol history.\n\nAfterwards, her debut single “I Believe” reached the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, and she also went on to win a Grammy for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for her song “Bittersweet.”\n\nNotably, she also starred as the lead character Celie in the Broadway production of The Color Purple, and reprised her role in the 2023 film version.\n\nCarrie Underwood (Season 4)\n\nThe country singer has taken home a whopping eight Grammy awards and sold over 85 million albums. Her major hits include “Before He Cheats,” “Jesus, Take the Wheel,” and “Cowboy Cassanova.”\n\nOn May 20, nearly two decades after taking home the season 4 winning title, Underwood reflected on her initial audition with a throwback photo.\n\n“contestant number #14887 received her golden ticket to Hollywood! I can’t believe it has been almost 20 years since auditioning for @AmericanIdol!,” she wrote on the Instagram caption.\n\nTaylor Hicks (Season 5)\n\nTwo years after his win, Hicks played Teen Angel in the Broadway revival of Grease. He then went on to have his own Las Vegas Residency in 2012.\n\n“It’s a true full-circle moment for me,” Hicks told The Hollywood Reporter of his Sin City venture, as his original American Idol audition took place in Las Vegas.\n\nHicks has released two official albums, Taylor Hicks (2006) and The Distance (2009).\n\nJordin Sparks (Season 6)\n\nWhen she took home her victory at the age of 17, Sparks became the youngest American Idol winner in the show’s history. Her hits include “Tattoo,” “No Air,” and “Battlefield.”\n\nShe has released four studio albums, and is currently working on her fifth. “I want to be able to record the music that I want to record because I want to record it, not because it has to meet certain criteria,” she told People. “I want to make it for me, and I want to believe in it, and I want to love it.”\n\nSparks has also starred in Broadway productions of In The Heights and Waitress.\n\nDavid Cook (Season 7)\n\nCook’s debut single “Time of My Life,” reached the number three position on the US Billboard Hot 100 charts.

To be honest, I probably wouldn’t have released some of the singles. I don't want to represent myself in a way that isn't me. I wanted to be a part of the writing process. That made it more stressful; having to write an album while you are on tour is overwhelming,” he said.\n\nDon't Miss...\n\nKaty Perry doesn't think Jelly Roll is good replacement for her on American Idol [INSIGHT]\n\nAmerican Idol fans ‘concerned’ about Wynonna Judd after finale performance [REACTION]\n\nAmerican Idol fans floored as Katy Perry rocks giant dress with special meaning [WATCH]\n\nPhillip Phillips (Season 11)\n\nPhillips is best known for his single “Home,” which reached the number six position on the US Billboard Hot 100 charts.
