        "text": "\"American Idol\" has officially kicked off the pressure cooker that is Hollywood Week. Which contestants cracked and which soared into the next round?\n\nOne contestant who felt the stress on Monday night's episode was Kelsie Dolin. The 18-year-old from Boone County, West Virginia blew the judges away in her audition singing Kelly Clarkson and Adele songs.\n\nDolin has been open on the show about her lack of performance experience. Aside from her \"Idol\" audition, the only time she's sung in front of a crowd, she said, was at church, where she froze up from nerves.\n\nDolin said music has been her outlet through hard times, including after the recent death of her grandmother, who was like a mother to her.\n\n\"I’m not really confident in myself because growing up, I guess I’ve always felt like I was on the back burner,\" she said. \"Or like, at Thanksgiving, when you have turkey or mac and cheese, I guess other people are the main things, and I’d be the mashed potatoes. No one really pays attention to ‘em.\"\n\nLucky for Dolin, \"Idol\" brought back beloved singers from seasons past to give contestants some much-needed pointers and pep talks before hitting the stage. These returning mentors were Season 2 winner Ruben Studdard, Season 6 winner Jordin Sparks, Season 7 winner David Cook, Season 9 winner Lee DeWyze, Season 10 runner-up Lauren Alaina, Season 10 third-place finalist Hailey Reinhart and last season's winner, Chayce Beckham.\n\n\"I know it’s intimidating. I know it is so overwhelming,\" Alaina told Dolin. \"However, this show was created for Kelsies. You are what 'American Idol' is all about. This is your moment. You get to decide who you are and what you are gonna be.\"\n\n'American Idol': Season 4 finalist Nadia Turner returns for daughter's shocking audition\n\nClutching the microphone with a trembling hand, Dolin sang \"Things a Man Oughta Know\" by Lainey Wilson to roaring applause.\n\n\"She’s never even had a mic,\" judge Luke Bryan quipped after Dolin left the stage. Judge Katy Perry added, \"She’s never seen a mic.\"\n\nJudge Lionel Richie revealed to a teary-eyed Dolin that she made the cut into the next round.\n\n\"I hope I made my grandma proud,\" Dolin said through tears.\n\nAnother contestant who struggled with confidence but rose to the occasion was Fritz Hager. The 22-year-old security officer from Tyler, Texas sang a gritty, raw rendition of \"Unsteady\" by X Ambassadors.\n\n\"I haven't really processed the whole thing yet,\" Hager said through tears after finding out he would also advance. \"I'm just so grateful.\"\n\nSam Finelli, more fan favorites say goodbye\n\nBut not every contestant can survive Hollywood Week.\n\nOne singer who hit the end of his \"Idol\" journey was Sam Finelli, who gave an inspiring audition after opening up about his life with autism.\n\n‘American Idol’: Luke Bryan wants to 'ugly cry' after autistic singer's inspiring audition\n\n\"I'm thankful for this experience,\" Finelli said after his elimination. \"I learned that it's OK to be different. It's OK to put yourself out there even though you have a hard time doing it. It's gonna be hard, but I'm not gonna give up.\"\n\nOthers who said goodbye were viral singing babysitter Delaney Renee, deep-voiced Luke Taylor, energetic uncle Thomas Patrick Moran and Zaréh, whose mother Nadia Turner finished in the Top 8 on Season 4 of \"Idol.\"\n\nKaty Perry fakes out frontrunner Nicolina\n\nUniversity student Nicolina floored the judges with her powerful performance of \"She Used to Be Mine\" by Sara Bareilles in her audition.\n\nAnd the 18-year-old from Toronto, Canada continued to establish her dominance in the competition on Monday's episode, with a soaring rendition of Billie Eilish's \"everything i wanted.\"\n\n‘American Idol’: Formerly homeless singer blows Katy Perry away with judge’s own song\n\nBefore taking the stage, Nicolina opened up about her family's struggles, saying that music helped her process her feelings during her parents' divorce.\n\n\"Everything kind of went downhill with my family,\" she said. \"A lot of emotions came with that. Through singing, I've learned how to use those emotions for the better and not let them get me down.\"\n\n'American Idol': Katy Perry gives last platinum ticket to a young 'superstar' in the making\n\nThe song seemed like a slam dunk, but Perry made her sweat, splitting the group of contestants Nicolina performed with into two rows.\n\n\"Front row, you are going through,\" Perry said as a shocked Nicolina stood in the back row.\n\nBut after a dramatic pause, Perry added: \"Back row, you are also going through.\""
