        "text": "Katy Perry was born on Oct. 25, 1984. That makes her a Scorpio sun with a Scorpio moon. This also means that she was born on a new moon — which means that, throughout her life, she craves to experience everything possible and is unafraid to start over and go in vast new directions.\n\nOrlando Bloom was born on Jan. 13, 1977. That makes him a tenacious Capricorn sun with a passionate Scorpio moon. From looking at his birth chart, I can see that he has a high predominance of earth and water planetary energy.\n\nY-E-S! In fact, their sparks are off the chart! Bloom’s moon is in the exact same place as Perry’s. This often denotes a strong and lasting connection, as they have shared interests, camaraderie and harmony. Romance, trust and cooperation? Yup."
