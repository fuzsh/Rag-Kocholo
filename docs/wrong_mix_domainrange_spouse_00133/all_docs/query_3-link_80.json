        "text": "Lady Gaga and her boyfriend Michael Polansky spent the weekend in Las Vegas—a pretty rare moment for the couple, which tends to keep things extremely low-key. However, not only were these two spotted at a U2 concert recently:\n\nBut they were also seen at Katy Perry's residency!\n\nGaga and Michael have been dating since December 2019, and got together right around New Year's. Back in August 2021 (so, like, two full years ago), a source told Entertainment Tonight that the pair was “the real deal” and that Michael was Gaga's “rock” amid the pandemic and her hectic filming schedule.\n\n“Michael is her North Star,” ET’s source said at the time. “He is such a grounding and guiding presence for her. They are the real deal. He loves Lady Gaga, but he’s in love with Stefani. He loves the theatrics and her artistry, but he is very happy being out of the spotlight and letting her shine.”\n\nMore recently in March of 2023, there were some tabloid reports that Gaga and Michael were over, with a source telling Radar Online, “They broke up a few months ago. It was amicable. They’re still friends.”\n\nThe outlet also reported that the couple had been having disagreements about marriage and kids, which caused “their relationship [to] hit a wall.” However, this news wasn't confirmed by...anyone. And considering Gaga and Michael's Vegas date night this weekend, it seems as though these two are very much still together!\n\nThis has been an update."
