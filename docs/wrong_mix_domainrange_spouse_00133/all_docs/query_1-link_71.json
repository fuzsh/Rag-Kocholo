        "text": "AMERICAN Idol judge Katy Perry has hit back at the criticism she received for being mean to contestants.\n\nFellow judge Luke Bryan called out the \"tense\" moment as they appeared on The View.\n\nThe panel welcomed Katy, Luke, and Lionel Richie to the talk show on March 28.\n\nThey talked about the current season of American Idol, as well as some solo projects the singers are currently working on.\n\nLuke discussed the intensity of Hollywood Week, as Sunny Hostin asked him what twists and turns can fans expect?\n\nKaty, 38, chimed in and said that Hollywood Week is \"tough, it's real life. People lose their voice.\"\n\n\"Well, we had one Hollywood Week-,\" Luke said, touching Katy's shoulder. \"I mean Katy had to get really - she had to get on somebody pretty good.\"\n\n\"I don't want to spoil too much, but it was one of the more tense moments we've ever had on the show,\" he added.\n\n\"It was pretty intense,\" Katy said, looking down at the table.\n\nJoy Behar asked: \"What did you do? Yell at somebody?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah,\" Lionel chimed in.\n\nKaty defended herself and said: \"You know, I stick up for those underdogs and I don't - all of us - we have so much respect for music and the game and the whole thing.\n\n\"And so, when someone is not taking it respectfully, we call it out.\"\n\nHollywood Week airs on April 2 at 8pm ET on ABC.\n\n'SOUR NOTE'\n\nWith six seasons under her belt, Katy has had plenty of memorable moments on the show.\n\nBut, some fans said that she has been mean to contestants.\n\nRecently, Katy made viewers furious after she \"shamed\" a 16-year-old contestant.\n\nPaige Anne, who also works as a snow cone employee at Tropical Sno in Idaho Falls, Idaho, tried to secure her spot in the next round of the competition by delivering the sweet treats to the judges.\n\n\"This is my signature flavor called the sour patch kid,\" she explained before taking her spot on the oval American Idol mark.\n\n\"It has blue raspberry, with watermelon and sour spray,\" she shared as Katy replied: \"Oh!\" while taking a bite.\n\nPaige went on to sing Pink's What About Us for her audition, garnering mixed signals from the judges.\n\nKaty said: \"That end stuff? That was the sour patch. That was the finishing touch, which made it you.\n\n\"In the beginning, it was just ice. Not a whole lotta flavor. So it was a real flip. It was like, she's not ready and then at the end it was like, oh OK, she may be able to compete.\"\n\nLionel voted yes to pass the teen through to the next round.\n\nBut Katy said no, explaining: \"I don't think you're yet ready. It's a no for me.\"\n\nLuke ended up giving Paige her second yes in order to move on to Hollywood.\n\nFans online, however, ripped Katy for her decision.\n\n\"I’m super shocked Katy said she isn’t ready! I know it’s not all about the voice, but her voice is one of the best of the competition! That is a winning voice!\" wrote one critic at the time.\n\nAnother reacted: \"There is something wrong with Katy Perry this season. She must be having trouble in her personal life because her attitude is strange and she's putting people through who shouldn't go through and then she seems to come down pretty hard on attractive young women so I would say the problem was not in the contestant but in Katy Perry.\"\n\nHowever several agreed with Katy, with one fan writing: \"Have you noticed how Katy can't say 'no' to anyone... she is always called jealous. Meanwhile Luke and Lionel say 'no' all the time and Katy saved so many people. Misogyny is crazy.\"\n\nIt's not the first time Katy has come under fire for her comments to contestants this season.\n\nSAY WHAT?\n\nEarlier this season, contestant Sara Beth Liebe auditioned and the judges could not believe she was 25.\n\n\"You look 16,\" Luke said, as Katy countered: \"Fifteen.\"\n\n\"I have three kids, so that's like,\" Sara Beth started to say.\n\nKaty got up out of her seat and turned around, placing her hands on the table by Luke and fanning herself.\n\n\"If Katy lays on the table, I think I'm gonna pass out,\" Sara Beth chuckled.\n\n\"Honey, you've been laying on the table too much,\" Katy shot back.\n\nLuke laughed and the contestant seemed OK with it at the time but later spoke up about it on her Tiktok page.\n\n'WASN'T SUPER KIND'\n\n\"At the start of my audition, before I sang, I mentioned that I had three children. That I was a young mom,\" she said on TikTok.\n\n\"And Katy Perry 'made a joke,'\" Sara Beth continued, putting the last three words in quotes, \"that wasn't super kind.\"\n\n\"I don't really have too much to say on my feelings about it because I feel like it's probably pretty self-explanatory.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I mean it was embarrassing to have that on TV and it was hurtful and you know, that's that.\n\n\"But, I did want to take this opportunity to just say that women supporting and uplifting other women is so cool and I think that mom-shaming is super lame.\"\n\n\"And I think that it's hard enough to be a mom and it's hard enough to be a woman,\" Sara Beth said.\n\nThe contestant ended: \"I don't think there's really anymore to it. If you love your babies and you're a good momma then that's all that really matters, and other comments just don't feel necessary.\""
