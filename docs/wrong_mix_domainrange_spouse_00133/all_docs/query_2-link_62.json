        "text": "American Idol Season 12 winner Candice Glover has released her new single, “Cried,” on iTunes today.\n\nProduced by The Underdogs, “Cried” arrives off of Glover’s debut album Music Speaks, currently set for a Feb. 18, 2014 release on 19/Interscope Records. The forthcoming record also includes tracks produced by Harvey Mason Jr., Rodney Jerkins and Jackie Boyz.\n\nPHOTOS: ‘American Idol’ Season 12 Finale in Pictures\n\nSet against a lush piano arrangement written to showcase Glover’s powerful vocals, the South Carolina native sings of a lost relationship and crying for “all of the pain that you brought/and I cried for all of the heartache you caused/I tried to be the girl that never complains/ but holding it in/is driving me insane/so I cried.” The song is currently available for download on iTunes.\n\nEarlier this month Glover took the stage at the Soul Train Awards to honor Legend Award recipient Dionne Warwick. The tribute also featured performances by Gladys Knight, Ronald Isley, Eric Benet, Ruben Studdard, Kenny Lattimore and Bobby V. Glover.\n\nThe Soul Train Awards airs Dec. 1 at 8 p.m. PST on BET and Centric.\n\nWatch the lyric video for “Cried” below:"
