        "text": "See the complete list of American Idol winners.\n\nAmerican Idol just wrapped its 22nd season, after months of looking for the latest aspiring singer to join its long history of superstars that have gained successful careers from the competition since it launched in 2002.\n\nThroughout the show’s 22-year history, viewers have seen singers from all genres and of all ages take the crown–and also a mix of celebrity judges helping the contestants through the competition, starting with OGs Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul leading all the way up to the current panel of Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan.\n\nOn May 21, Abi Carter rose above the competition, beating finalists Jack Blocker and Will Moseley for the Season 22 crown. During the finale, she performed her original song “This Isn’t Over” and a rendition of Billie Eilish’s “What Was I Made For?”\n\nSpeaking to Billboard when the top 10 was announced, Carter said, “I want to be an artist. I’ve never felt so passionately about something. I went to school and got a psychology degree because I figured if I can’t express my emotions through something artistically, maybe I can just help other people express their emotions. I was going to be a family therapist.”\n\nSee below for a complete list of American Idol winners.\n\nSeason 1\n\nThe first season of American Idol premiered on June 11, 2002, and a 20-year-old Kelly Clarkson stood in front of judges Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson in Dallas, Texas to audition with Etta James’ “At Last” and Madonna’s “Express Yourself.” Season 1’s hosts were Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman.\n\nJudges: Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson\n\nWinner: Kelly Clarkson\n\nSeason 2\n\nSeacrest became the lone host of the series following Dunkleman’s departure in season 2. The final two contestants were both male this season, with Clay Aiken and Ruben Studdard competing for the win. Studdard took the title after performing his winning song “Flying Without Wings.”\n\nJudges: Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson\n\nWinner: Ruben Studdard\n\nSeason 3\n\nThe third season was won by Fantasia Barrino, who defeated Diana DeGarmo by a small margin of votes. Season 3 also introduced the world to Jennifer Hudson.\n\nJudges: Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson\n\nWinner: Fantasia Barrino\n\nSeason 4\n\nIdol‘s fourth season crowned Carrie Underwood as the winner, and the then-21-year-old songstress went on to become a Grammy-winning country superstar. Bo Bice was the runner-up.\n\nJudges: Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson\n\nWinner: Carrie Underwood\n\nSeason 5\n\nThough Taylor Hicks was named the winner, the fifth season of American Idol gave the music industry a number of other stars, including Chris Daughtry, Kellie Pickler and Katharine McPhee (the runner-up).\n\nJudges: Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson\n\nWinner: Taylor Hicks\n\nSeason 6\n\nJordin Sparks became the youngest winner of American Idol at age 17.\n\nJudges: Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson\n\nWinner: Jordin Sparks\n\nSeason 7\n\nSeason 7 was known for its David vs. David finale, as David Cook and David Archuleta faced off for the title. Both contestants went on to release albums and kick off a career in music.\n\nJudges: Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson\n\nWinner: David Cook\n\nSeason 8\n\nThis marked the first season with a new judge, as the OG trio welcomed Kara DioGuardi to the panel. During the finale in 2009, Kris Allen won against Adam Lambert.\n\nJudges: Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul, Randy Jackson and Kara DioGuardi\n\nWinner: Kris Allen\n\nSeason 9\n\nThis was the first season without Paula Abdul, and the team brought on Ellen DeGeneres as a new judge.\n\nJudges: Simon Cowell, Ellen DeGeneres, Randy Jackson and Kara DioGuardi\n\nWinner: Lee DeWyze\n\nSeason 10\n\nSimon Cowell also left the series this season, marking the first of many judge changes during the course of the show. The countrified finale saw Scotty McCreery win the title over Lauren Alaina. McCreery was the youngest male winner, at 17 (same age as Jordin Sparks).\n\nJudges: Randy Jackson, Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler\n\nWinner: Scotty McCreery\n\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\n\nSign Up"
