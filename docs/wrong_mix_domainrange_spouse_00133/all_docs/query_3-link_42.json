        "text": "Katy Perry’s teenage dream is coming true.\n\nThe “Chained to the Rhythm” singer told People in a new interview that her family with fiancé Orlando Bloom could expand “hopefully in the future.”\n\n“I’m a planner,” Perry, 37, told the magazine while promoting De Soi, her new non-alcoholic sparkling drink. “So we’ll see.”\n\nThe couple — who started dating in early 2016 and announced their engagement three years later — welcomed daughter Daisy Dove in August 2020. Their nuptials have been pushed back multiple times, in part due to the pandemic.\n\n“It was just such an interesting thing having a child during COVID because everything paused besides that,” Perry told People. “I love the experience I’m having with my daughter now.”"
