        "text": "MEGHAN Trainor has been left begging to take over as judge on American Idol after Katy Perry's departure.\n\nThe I Kissed a Girl singer walked away from the show after Season 22.\n\nMeghan, 30, appeared on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, opening up about her \"dream job.\"\n\n\"I've done every interview in the world and said that that is my dream job and I have emailed three awesome people who work in that world,\" she revealed.\n\nThe Me Too singer added, however, that those people \"don't really have the full say but I begged.\"\n\nWhile it's unknown who will fill Katy's seat after she leaves the show, Meghan does have a leg up on the competition.\n\nShe has hosted international iterations of the competition series, and both Luke Bryan and host Ryan Seacrest previously said she would be a good fit for the show.\n\nRyan, 49, speculated about the Massachusetts native appearing on the show in an interview with Entertainment Tonight.\n\n\"She was very good,\" he said.\n\n\"Meghan is a super talent too, and she's got a great sense of humor. She's fun and she's spontaneous.\"\n\nLuke, 47, agreed.\n\n\"I think Meghan's always been real fun. You know, that's kinda been her brand, to have fun. [She's] real witty, so certainly.\"\n\nMeghan hasn't been chosen yet, however.\n\n\"I have begged for this job,\" she told Andy, 56.\n\n\"I haven't heard any updates, so check my emails, but that is my dream job. I want to drive to work at American Idol and then drive home.\"\n\nKaty, 39, serves as a judge alongside Luke and Lionel Richie.\n\nShe announced her impending departure from the show in February amid major criticism from viewers.\n\nTAKING KATY'S PLACE\n\nIn the months since her announcement, rumors have swirled about who would replace her.\n\nKelly Clarkson, who won the first season of American Idol, was rumored to be in the running.\n\nShe set the record straight in her own interview with Entertainment Tonight.\n\n\"I can't do that, only because I promised my kids,\" she said.\n\n\"I was like, 'I wanna be there as much as I possibly can.' And it would put me in LA, and that's why I had to quit The Voice, which I love that team. And I miss them so much.\"\n\nKelly, 42, said that she's putting her children – River, nine, and Remington, eight – first, doing her best to be present in their lives.\n\n\"I wanted a life for us. And we enjoy the park every day, and we enjoy each other,\" she said.\n\n\"As a parent – people get this – you only get so much time until they don't want to hang out with you. That's the reason [I can't do Idol]. It's my kiddos.\"\n\nMEGHAN'S DREAM\n\nThis isn't the first time Meghan has spoken about her American Idol dreams.\n\nEarlier this month, she appeared alongside her husband, Daryl Sabara, and her brother, Ryan Trainor, on ET's Spilling The E-Tea.\n\nHer Spy Kids star husband asked if she might be interested in taking the job during the appearance.\n\n\"There's nothing I want more in life than to be a judge on American Idol,\" the All About That Bass singer said.\n\n\"That is my ultimate bucket list dream come true. Please, please consider me on your show. Please American Idol! Please! I'm ready. Alright, yeah, I would love to.\"\n\n\"That was good. That was good, Daryl replied."
