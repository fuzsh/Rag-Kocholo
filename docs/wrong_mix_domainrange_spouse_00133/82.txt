American Idol winner Ruben Studdard has tied the knot with fianc√©e Surata Zuri McCants.

The couple, who have been dating for two years, married near Studdard's hometown of Birmingham, Alabama on Saturday.

Around 200 of their closest family and friends attended the ceremony, reports OK!.

Studdard, 29, met his new wife at an in-store record signing at a Wal-Mart store near Atlanta.

He told The Birmingham News: "I was signing copies of my CD and she came in to get one signed for her friend who couldn't get off from work.

"We started talking, and she was telling me about her friend. But I just looked at her and thought: 'She is so beautiful.'"

He added: "God has given me a beautiful wife. I am looking forward to having fun with her and enjoying all the blessings that have come my way so far."

Studdard, nicknamed the 'Velvet Teddy Bear', beat Clay Aiken in the final of American Idol in 2003.
