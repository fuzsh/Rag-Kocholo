The couple first revealed their exciting baby news in November with a video of their son Olivier wearing a “BIG BRO” sweatshirt while waving excitedly to the camera.

“Soon to be a family of four 2024,” a wooden block read alongside a baby onesie that featured the words, “Baby Studdard.” A baby scan was also placed on display.

Last month, the singer shared a carousel of maternity photos on Instagram showing Studdard and his wife all dressed up as Moore-Studdard cradled her baby bump in a rust-colored gown.

“Celebration of Life, Love and New Beginnings,” Studdard wrote. “We can’t wait to welcome the newest addition to Team Studdard. @kristin_studdard I love you darling!!!”

In the first snap, Moore-Studdard wore a long gown while caressing her bump. She and Studdard also flashed beaming smiles as they held each other's hands.

Another sweet photo showed Studdard planting a kiss on his wife’s cheek as the pair closed their eyes.

“OUR LOVE 🤎✨#maternityphotography #maternity," Moore-Studdard shared as she reposted the photos on her Instagram.
