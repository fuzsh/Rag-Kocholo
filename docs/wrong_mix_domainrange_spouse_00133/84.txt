Ruben Studdard has become a father for a second time after welcoming a daughter with wife Kristin Moore-Studdard on Thursday.

The 45-year-old American Idol alum and his spouse are already parents to three-year-old son Olivier.

'We are thrilled to welcome baby Henri into our lives. Big bro Olivier can’t contain his excitement,' the couple said in a statement shared with People.

Henri's moniker has a sentimental meaning as she was named in tribute to Moore-Studdard's late father Henry.

The Studdards' bundle of joy weighed six lbs., 14 oz. at birth.

Ruben and Kristin announced they were expecting their second child last November in an Instagram post.

In a joint post, they shared a video of their son dressed in a shirt that read: 'Big bro.'

The caption said, 'Surprise! We’ve been keeping a little secret. I’ve been soaking up this blissful baby bubble. Family of four coming 2024.'

And in February the Sorry 2004 singer posted maternity photos featuring him and his wife formally dressed.

'Celebration of Life , Love and New Beginnings. We can’t wait to welcome the newest addition to Team Studdard,' he wrote to his 200,000 followers.

The devoted husband added, '@kristin_studdard I love you darling!!!'

Last September Moore-Studdard expressed her love for her spouse as she wished him a happy birthday on social media.

'HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the most loving, caring, and supportive husband and father. You mean the world to us. Wishing you a fantastic birthday filled with all the things you love and cherish the most,' she penned.

Studdard was previously married for three years.

In November 2011 he and Zuri McCants separated citing 'irreconcilable differences.'

At the time, the singer's lawyer Byron Perkins said: 'Ruben Studdard and Zuri McCants Studdard have separated, and they are in the process of seeking a dissolution of their marriage.

'They each request the public respects their privacy during this trying time in their lives.'
