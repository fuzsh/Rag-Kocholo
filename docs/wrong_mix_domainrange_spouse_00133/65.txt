“Orlando had planned this for a while,” a source close to the couple told People. “He wanted it all to be special.” And to accommodate Perry's more traditional parents, Bloom made sure to ask for permission first before popping the question. “Katy’s family knew he was proposing. He talked to her parents about it before...Katy was very surprised and shaking with happiness...They both want kids together and will prioritize this.”

Perry later spoke about the proposal during a Capital Breakfast with Roman Kemp interview. “It was Valentine’s Day and I had to work that day,” she said, via People. “I just remember meeting him at dinner at this place, this Italian restaurant, because when I get a pass, I just want to stuff my face with pasta. So I get there and, I mean, he’s like clean-shaven. He’s not wearing tennis shoes. I’m like, ‘Ah shit, something is going down!’ We were ordering everything, and I was like, ‘Who is this person?!’”

Bloom then took her onto a helicopter after dinner. “I got on a helicopter and he asked me to marry him, and then we landed on this building and then went downstairs and my family and friends were there and the most flowers you’ve ever seen.

Because of their hectic jobs, the couple has to spend a lot of time apart, but they still find the time to make it work.

“That's part of the job, right?” Bloom told People on July 27. “You have to do the groundwork together, create the feeling of trust and safety so that you can spend time apart and do everything that you need to do and still feel tethered to that person, so that you can go on a journey together.”

August 2019: Bloom opens up about his future marriage to Perry.

During an appearance on Today, Bloom spoke about their future, emphasizing a need to connect prior to walking down the aisle. “It’s important to me that we are aligned—I’ve been married and divorced, and I don’t want to do it again,” Bloom shared. “And we’re both fully aware of that. She’s remarkable and so I’m always so impressed with that and I’m encouraged.”

December 2019: Perry and Bloom postpone their wedding.

Concerns about what the date change may mean for the couple should be kept at bay, the source adding, “They’re beyond in love.”

[But] they are very excited.”

I have definitely tested him, like…‘oh yeah, you think you can handle me?’”

She also touched on the activities they're doing while homebound. “We have a LEGO room in our house. It was a TV room,” she said. “He gets these Legos that are super hard to do… and he’ll make those in two days and then he displays them on the wall, like a championship Lego wall. I was like ‘oh, you’re a lot handier than I thought you were. Can you hang this thing for me, please?’”

June 2020: Perry recalls her struggles following a past breakup from Bloom.

During an interview with radio show Q on CBC, Perry got candid about her mental health following a split from Bloom in 2017. Perry told Power, via Daily Mail and CNN, that “my career was on this trajectory when it was going up, up and up and then I had the smallest shift, not that huge from an outside perspective, but for me, it was seismic,” she said. “They say if a ship is one degree off from their navigation, they'll land on a different continent.” Perry added, “I had given so much out, and it literally broke me in half. I had broken up with my boyfriend, who is now my baby daddy-to-be. And then I was excited about flying high off the next record. But the validation did not make me high, and so I just crashed.”

Perry said she even contemplated taking her own life during this period. “Gratitude is probably the thing that saved my life, because if I didn’t find that I would have wallowed in my own sadness and probably just jumped,” she said. “But I found the ways to be grateful. If it gets really, really hard I walk around and say, ‘I am grateful, I am grateful!’ even though I am in a shitty mood.”

July 2020: Perry confirms she won't wed Bloom in 2020.

She also confirmed that after the coronavirus pandemic cancelled wedding plans around the world, she and Bloom would not marry this year. “We cannot plan anymore in 2020, because those plans are always canceled,“ she admitted, dispelling rumors of two ceremonies. “I honestly, never heard of the other wedding, I only knew of one wedding. Of course, that will come in the future, but for now, we want to deliver a healthy child. And that's what's coming up.”

August 2020: Perry speaks about she and Bloom's rocky journey to parenthood.

For the latest issue of People, Perry got candid about her relationship with Bloom, including past breakups and their excitement for a new baby. “It's really about an individual journey that makes the whole thing better. We both had to decide to go on that journey separately because it's not my half and your half that makes a whole,” Perry told the outlet. “It's my wholeness and your wholeness that makes this whole thing happen.”

According to the outlet, the track “Champagne Problems,“ off Perry's upcoming Smile album addresses their challenges as a couple. “It's a song that really talks about how intense it's gotten and how many things we have had to go through. Yes, we have problems. Everybody has challenges in a relationship,” she explained. “If it's a real relationship, it's going to challenge you into your best self. I really understand what Justin Timberlake said about, ‘You're my mirror,’ because it's true. They bring up all this stuff you can't really see about yourself.”

She continued, “It's a never-ending evolution, so it's not peachy-keen jelly bean all the time, but it's nice to have been able to show each other all the good, bad and everything in between, and really fight for our best selves. Now, we just joke, like yeah, we still have things to work out—but champagne problems! We've gotten through a lot of hell.”

As for becoming a parent, Perry told People there are several qualities she hopes her daughter will inherit from Bloom. “Of course you admire someone that usually has traits you want more of. I want to be more spiritual and more centered, and that's him,” she explained. “He wants to be more organized and good with thinking about big picture stuff. Those are traits that we really aspire to learn about each other.”

As for their elusive wedding, Perry told the outlet, “I tried to do it this year and it poo poo-ed on me so ask me again in another year! I went through the whole freakin' process. Right now, we're just so focused on this [pregnancy], which is exciting. Let's hope [2021] is different than '20.”

“I wasn’t very maternal, and I think that probably stems from some childhood stuff,” she said. “[Then] Orlando, I got to see what a great dad he was with his first child, Flynn, who is now 11.
