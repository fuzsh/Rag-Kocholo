Here’s our process.\n\nHealthline only shows you brands and products that we stand behind.\n\nOur team thoroughly researches and evaluates the recommendations we make on our site. To establish that the product manufacturers addressed safety and efficacy standards, we:\n\nEvaluate ingredients and composition: Do they have the potential to cause harm?\n\nFact-check all health claims: Do they align with the current body of scientific evidence?\n\nAssess the brand: Does it operate with integrity and adhere to industry best practices?\n\nWe do the research so you can find trusted products for your health and wellness.\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nThe ketogenic diet involves consuming a very low amount of carbohydrates and replacing them with fat to help your body burn fat for energy. Health benefits can include weight loss and lowering your risk for certain diseases.\n\nThe ketogenic diet (or keto diet, for short) is a low carb, high fat diet that offers many health benefits.\n\nIn fact, many studies show that this type of diet can help you lose weight and improve your health (1).\n\nKetogenic diets may even have benefits against diabetes, cancer, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s disease (2, 3, 4, 5).\n\nHere is a detailed beginner’s guide to the keto diet.\n\nKeto basics\n\nThe ketogenic diet is a very low carb, high fat diet that shares many similarities with the Atkins and low carb diets.\n\nIt involves drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat. This reduction in carbs puts your body into a metabolic state called ketosis.\n\nWhen this happens, your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy. It also turns fat into ketones in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain (6).\n\nKetogenic diets can cause significant reductions in blood sugar and insulin levels. This, along with the increased ketones, has some health benefits (6, 7, 8).\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe keto diet is a low carb, high fat diet. It lowers blood sugar and insulin levels and shifts the body’s metabolism away from carbs and toward fat and ketones.\n\nThere are several versions of the ketogenic diet, and what you eat depends on the type. They include:\n\nStandard ketogenic diet (SKD): This is a very low carb, moderate protein and high fat diet. It typically contains 70% fat, 20% protein, and only 10% carbs (9).\n\nCyclical ketogenic diet (CKD): This diet involves periods of higher carb refeeds, such as 5 ketogenic days followed by 2 high carb days.\n\nTargeted ketogenic diet (TKD): This diet allows you to add carbs around workouts.\n\nHigh protein ketogenic diet: This is similar to a standard ketogenic diet, but includes more protein. The ratio is often 60% fat, 35% protein, and 5% carbs.\n\nHowever, only the standard and high protein ketogenic diets have been studied extensively. Cyclical or targeted ketogenic diets are more advanced methods and primarily used by bodybuilders or athletes.\n\nThe information in this article mostly applies to the standard ketogenic diet (SKD), although many of the same principles also apply to the other versions.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThere are several versions of the keto diet. The standard (SKD) version is the most researched and most recommended.\n\nKetosis is a metabolic state in which your body uses fat for fuel instead of carbs.\n\nIt occurs when you significantly reduce your consumption of carbohydrates, limiting your body’s supply of glucose (sugar), which is the main source of energy for the cells.\n\nFollowing a ketogenic diet is the most effective way to enter ketosis. Generally, this involves limiting carb consumption to around 20 to 50 grams per day and filling up on fats, such as meat, fish, eggs, nuts, and healthy oils (6).\n\nIt’s also important to moderate your protein consumption. This is because protein can be converted into glucose if consumed in high amounts, which may slow your transition into ketosis (10).\n\nPracticing intermittent fasting could also help you enter ketosis faster. There are many different forms of intermittent fasting, but the most common method involves limiting food intake to around 8 hours per day and fasting for the remaining 16 hours (11).\n\nBlood, urine, and breath tests are available, which can help determine whether you’ve entered ketosis by measuring the amount of ketones produced by your body.\n\nCertain symptoms may also indicate that you’ve entered ketosis, including increased thirst, dry mouth, frequent urination, and decreased hunger or appetite (12).\n\nSUMMARY\n\nKetosis is a metabolic state in which your body uses fat for fuel instead of carbs. Modifying your diet and practicing intermittent fasting can help you enter ketosis faster. Certain tests and symptoms can also help determine whether you’ve entered ketosis.\n\nA ketogenic diet is an effective way to lose weight and lower risk factors for disease (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\nIn fact, research shows that the ketogenic diet may be as effective for weight loss as a low fat diet (13, 14, 15).\n\nWhat’s more, the diet is so filling that you can lose weight without counting calories or tracking your food intake (16).\n\nOne review of 13 studies found that following a very low carb, ketogenic diet was slightly more effective for long-term weight loss than a low fat diet. People who followed the keto diet lost an average of 2 pounds (0.9 kg) more than the group that followed a low fat diet (13).\n\nWhat’s more, it also led to reductions in diastolic blood pressure and triglyceride levels (13).\n\nAnother study in 34 older adults found that those who followed a ketogenic diet for 8 weeks lost nearly five times as much total body fat as those who followed a low fat diet (17).\n\nThe increased ketones, lower blood sugar levels, and improved insulin sensitivity may also play a key role (18, 19).\n\nFor more details on the weight loss effects of a ketogenic diet, read this article.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nA ketogenic diet can help you lose slightly more weight than a low fat diet. This often happens with less hunger.\n\nDiscover more about this condition\n\nDiabetes is characterized by changes in metabolism, high blood sugar, and impaired insulin function (20).\n\nThe ketogenic diet can help you lose excess fat, which is closely linked to type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and metabolic syndrome (21, 22, 23, 24).\n\nOne older study found that the ketogenic diet improved insulin sensitivity by a whopping 75% (25).\n\nA small study in women with type 2 diabetes also found that following a ketogenic diet for 90 days significantly reduced levels of hemoglobin A1C, which is a measure of long-term blood sugar management (26).\n\nAnother study in 349 people with type 2 diabetes found that those who followed a ketogenic diet lost an average of 26.2 pounds (11.9 kg) over a 2-year period. This is an important benefit when considering the link between weight and type 2 diabetes (24, 27).\n\nWhat’s more, they also experienced improved blood sugar management, and the use of certain blood sugar medications decreased among participants throughout the course of the study (27).\n\nFor more information, check out this article on the benefits of low carb diets for people with diabetes.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe ketogenic diet can boost insulin sensitivity and cause fat loss, leading to significant health benefits for people with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.\n\nThe ketogenic diet actually originated as a tool for treating neurological diseases such as epilepsy.\n\nStudies have now shown that the diet can have benefits for a wide variety of different health conditions:\n\nHeart disease. The ketogenic diet can help improve risk factors like body fat, HDL (good) cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and blood sugar (28, 29).\n\nCancer. The diet is currently being explored as an additional treatment for cancer, because it may help slow tumor growth. (4, 30, 31).\n\nAlzheimer’s disease. The keto diet may help reduce symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and slow its progression (5, 32, 33).\n\nEpilepsy. Research has shown that the ketogenic diet can cause significant reductions in seizures in epileptic children (3).\n\nParkinson’s disease. Although more research is needed, one study found that the diet helped improve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (34).\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome. The ketogenic diet can help reduce insulin levels, which may play a key role in polycystic ovary syndrome (35, 36).\n\nBrain injuries. Some research suggests that the diet could improve outcomes of traumatic brain injuries (37).\n\nHowever, keep in mind that research into many of these areas is far from conclusive.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nA ketogenic diet may provide many health benefits, especially with metabolic, neurological, or insulin-related diseases.\n\nAny food that’s high in carbs should be limited.\n\nHere’s a list of foods that need to be reduced or eliminated on a ketogenic diet:\n\nsugary foods: soda, fruit juice, smoothies, cake, ice cream, candy, etc.\n\ngrains or starches: wheat-based products, rice, pasta, cereal, etc.\n\nfruit: all fruit, except small portions of berries like strawberries\n\nbeans or legumes: peas, kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, etc.\n\nroot vegetables and tubers: potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, parsnips, etc.\n\nlow fat or diet products: low fat mayonnaise, salad dressings, and condiments\n\nsome condiments or sauces: barbecue sauce, honey mustard, teriyaki sauce, ketchup, etc.\n\nunhealthy fats: processed vegetable oils, mayonnaise, etc.\n\nalcohol: beer, wine, liquor, mixed drinks\n\nsugar-free diet foods: sugar-free candies, syrups, puddings, sweeteners, desserts, etc.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAvoid carb-based foods like grains, sugars, legumes, rice, potatoes, candy, juice, and even most fruits.\n\nYou should base the majority of your meals around these foods:\n\nmeat: red meat, steak, ham, sausage, bacon, chicken, and turkey\n\nfatty fish: salmon, trout, tuna, and mackerel\n\neggs: pastured or omega-3 whole eggs\n\nbutter and cream: grass-fed butter and heavy cream\n\ncheese: unprocessed cheeses like cheddar, goat, cream, blue, or mozzarella\n\nnuts and seeds: almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds, etc.\n\nhealthy oils: extra virgin olive oil, and avocado oil\n\navocados: whole avocados or freshly made guacamole\n\nlow carb veggies: green veggies, tomatoes, onions, peppers, etc.\n\ncondiments: salt, pepper, herbs, and spices\n\nIt’s best to base your diet mostly on whole, single-ingredient foods. Here’s a list of 44 healthy low carb foods.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nBase the majority of your diet on foods such as meat, fish, eggs, butter, nuts, healthy oils, avocados, and plenty of low carb veggies.\n\nTo help get you started, here’s a sample ketogenic diet meal plan for one week:\n\nMonday\n\nbreakfast: veggie and egg muffins with tomatoes\n\nlunch: chicken salad with olive oil, feta cheese, olives, and a side salad\n\ndinner: salmon with asparagus cooked in butter\n\nTuesday\n\nbreakfast: egg, tomato, basil, and spinach omelet\n\nlunch: almond milk, peanut butter, spinach, cocoa powder, and stevia milkshake (more keto smoothies here) with a side of sliced strawberries\n\ndinner: cheese-shell tacos with salsa\n\nWednesday\n\nbreakfast: nut milk chia pudding topped with coconut and blackberries\n\nlunch: avocado shrimp salad\n\ndinner: pork chops with Parmesan cheese, broccoli, and salad\n\nThursday\n\nbreakfast: omelet with avocado, salsa, peppers, onion, and spices\n\nlunch: a handful of nuts and celery sticks with guacamole and salsa\n\ndinner: chicken stuffed with pesto and cream cheese, and a side of grilled zucchini\n\nFriday\n\nbreakfast: sugar-free Greek, whole milk yogurt with peanut butter, cocoa powder, and berries\n\nlunch: ground beef lettuce wrap tacos with sliced bell peppers\n\ndinner: loaded cauliflower and mixed veggies\n\nSaturday\n\nbreakfast: cream cheese pancakes with blueberries and a side of grilled mushrooms\n\nlunch: Zucchini and beet “noodle” salad\n\ndinner: white fish cooked in olive oil with kale and toasted pine nuts\n\nSunday\n\nbreakfast: fried eggs with and mushrooms\n\nlunch: low carb sesame chicken and broccoli\n\ndinner: spaghetti squash Bolognese\n\nAlways try to rotate the vegetables and meat over the long term, as each type provides different nutrients and health benefits.\n\nFor tons of recipes, check out these 101 healthy low carb recipes and this keto shopping list.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nYou can eat a wide variety of tasty and nutritious meals on a ketogenic diet. It’s not all meats and fats. Vegetables are an important part of the diet.\n\nIn case you get hungry between meals, here are some healthy, keto-approved snacks:\n\nfatty meat or fish\n\ncheese\n\na handful of nuts or seeds\n\nketo sushi bites\n\nolives\n\none or two hard-boiled or deviled eggs\n\nketo-friendly snack bars\n\n90% dark chocolate\n\nfull-fat Greek yogurt mixed with nut butter and cocoa powder\n\nbell peppers and guacamole\n\nstrawberries and plain cottage cheese\n\ncelery with salsa and guacamole\n\nbeef jerky\n\nsmaller portions of leftover meals\n\nfat bombs\n\nSUMMARY\n\nGreat snacks for a keto diet include pieces of meat, cheese, olives, boiled eggs, nuts, raw veggies, and dark chocolate.\n\nAlthough getting started on the ketogenic diet can be challenging, there are several tips and tricks that you can use to make it easier.\n\nStart by familiarizing yourself with food labels and checking the grams of fat, carbs, and fiber to determine how your favorite foods can fit into your diet.\n\nPlanning out your meals in advance may also be beneficial and can help you save extra time throughout the week.\n\nMany websites, food blogs, apps, and cookbooks also offer keto-friendly recipes and meal ideas that you can use to build your own custom menu.\n\nAlternatively, some meal delivery services even offer keto-friendly options for a quick and convenient way to enjoy keto meals at home.\n\nLook into healthy frozen keto meals when you’re short on time\n\nWhen going to social gatherings or visiting family and friends, you may also want to consider bringing your own food, which can make it much easier to curb cravings and stick to your meal plan.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nReading food labels, planning your meals ahead, and bringing your own foods when visiting family and friends can make it much easier to stick to the ketogenic diet.\n\nMany restaurant meals can be made keto-friendly.\n\nMost restaurants offer some kind of meat or fish-based dish. Order this and replace any high carb food with extra vegetables.\n\nEgg-based meals are also a great option, such as an omelet or eggs and bacon.\n\nAnother favorite is bun-less burgers. You could also swap the fries for vegetables instead. Add extra avocado, cheese, bacon, or eggs.\n\nAt Mexican restaurants, you can enjoy any type of meat with extra cheese, guacamole, salsa, and sour cream.\n\nFor dessert, ask for a mixed cheese board or berries with cream.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWhen eating out, select a meat-, fish-, or egg-based dish. Order extra veggies instead of carbs or starches, and have cheese for dessert.\n\nAlthough the ketogenic diet is usually safe for most healthy people, there may be some initial side effects while your body adapts.\n\nThere’s some anecdotal evidence of these effects often referred to as the keto flu (38). Based on reports from some on the eating plan, it’s usually over within a few days.\n\nReported keto flu symptoms include diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting (39). Other less common symptoms include:\n\npoor energy and mental function\n\nincreased hunger\n\nsleep issues\n\nnausea\n\ndigestive discomfort\n\ndecreased exercise performance\n\nTo minimize this, you can try a regular low carb diet for the first few weeks. This may teach your body to burn more fat before you completely eliminate carbs.\n\nA ketogenic diet can also change the water and mineral balance of your body, so adding extra salt to your meals or taking mineral supplements may help. Talk to your doctor about your nutritional needs.\n\nAt least in the beginning, it’s important to eat until you’re full and avoid restricting calories too much. Usually, a ketogenic diet causes weight loss without intentional calorie restriction.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nMany of the side effects of starting a ketogenic diet can be limited. Easing into the diet and taking mineral supplements can help.\n\nWhile the keto diet has its benefits, staying on it in the long term may have some negative effects, including risks of the following:\n\nlow protein in the blood\n\nextra fat in the liver\n\nkidney stones\n\nmicronutrient deficiencies\n\nA type of medication called sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for type 2 diabetes can increase the risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, a dangerous condition that increases blood acidity. Anyone taking this medication should avoid the keto diet (40, 41).\n\nMore research is being done to determine the safety of the keto diet in the long term. Keep your doctor informed of your eating plan to guide your choices.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThere are some side effects to the keto diet about which you should speak to your doctor if you plan to stay on the diet long term.\n\nHere are answers to some of the most common questions about the ketogenic diet.\n\nCan I ever eat carbs again?\n\nYes. However, it’s important to significantly reduce your carb intake initially. After the first 2 to 3 months, you can eat carbs on special occasions — just return to the diet immediately after.\n\nWill I lose muscle?\n\nThere’s a risk of losing some muscle on any diet. However, protein intake and high ketone levels may help minimize muscle loss, especially if you lift weights (50, 51).\n\nCan I build muscle on a ketogenic diet?\n\nYes, but it may not work as well as on a moderate carb diet (52, 53). For more details about low carb or keto diets and exercise performance, read this article.\n\nHow much protein can I eat?\n\nProtein should be moderate, as a very high intake can spike insulin levels and lower ketones. Around 35% of total calorie intake is probably the upper limit.\n\nWhat if I am constantly tired, weak, or fatigued?\n\nYou may not be in full ketosis or be utilizing fats and ketones efficiently. To counter this, lower your carb intake and revisit the points above. A supplement like MCT oil or ketones may also help (42, 43).\n\nMy urine smells fruity. Why is this?\n\nDon’t be alarmed. This is simply due to the excretion of by-products created during ketosis (54).\n\nMy breath smells. What can I do?\n\nThis is a common side effect. Try drinking naturally flavored water or chewing sugar-free gum.\n\nI heard ketosis was extremely dangerous. Is this true?\n\nPeople often confuse ketosis with ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is dangerous, but ketosis on a ketogenic diet is usually fine for healthy people. Speak to your doctor before starting any new diet.\n\nI have digestion issues and diarrhea. What can I do?\n\nThis common side effect usually passes after 3 to 4 weeks. If it persists, try eating more high fiber veggies (55, 56).\n\nWhat is the difference between a keto and a ketogenic diet?\n\nPeople often refer to the ketogenic diet colloquially as the keto diet, so these terms refer to the same thing.\n\nHow much weight can I lose in 1 week on keto?\n\nIn the first week of the keto diet, the weight you lose is typically water weight. Anecdotally, people report losing about 1 lb (0.5 kg) to 10 lb or more (5 kg).\n\nLearn more about weight loss after 1 week on keto.\n\nIs keto good or bad for you?\n\nA ketogenic diet can be great for people who:\n\nare overweight\n\nhave diabetes\n\nare looking to improve their metabolic health\n\nIt may be less suitable for elite athletes or those wishing to add large amounts of muscle or weight.\n\nIt may also not be sustainable for some people’s lifestyles and preferences. Speak with your doctor about your eating plan and goals to decide if a keto eating plan is right for you.\n\nWhile following the ketogenic diet, you reduce your carbohydrate intake and replace it with healthy fats. This can help your body to use fat for energy, encouraging weight loss and possibly reducing the chance of developing certain health issues.\n\nThat said, consult your doctor prior to engaging in the diet for an extended period of time, as it may have some side effects. More research is needed to understand its long-term effect on the body.\n\nRead the article in Spanish."
