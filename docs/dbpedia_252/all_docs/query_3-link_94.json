        "text": "You don’t really know a language until you’ve learned its slang. And when it comes to English, many people agree that Australian slang is the richest, liveliest and funniest slang you could learn. Sure, there’s always British English, but the Brits don’t call their barbecue “barbie”. And that’s a missed opportunity. Wouldn’t you agree? How can you have just a plain, dull barbecue when you could have a “barbie”? The Aussie slang is the best slang.\n\nTop 10 Popular Australian Slang Terms & Words\n\nLet’s start with the basics: core Australian slang vocabulary. Here’s a list of popular Australian slang terms you probably heard before but didn’t know what they meant.\n\n1. Ta – Thank you\n\nYou can also use “thanks heaps” when you are really grateful to someone for doing something for you or “cheers” to combine both “thank you”‌ and “goodbye” ‌in a single word. For example, “cheers” is a perfect choice for leaving the shop after the barista gives you your coffee.\n\n2. Brekkie – Breakfast\n\nAlthough it sounds like breakfast for kids, brekkie is the Australian meal everyone has in the morning.\n\n“So… what did you have for brekkie today?”\n\n3. Barbie – Barbecue\n\nWell, I don’t mind if you call me a “barbie girl” now.\n\n4. Crikey! – An Exclamation of Surprise\n\nFamously used by Steve Irwin. It’s similar to the British English slang “blimey!”.\n\n5. Cake Hole – Mouth\n\nThere’s no better replacement for the word “mouth”. Why isn’t everybody using this?\n\n6. Ankle-Biter – A Small or Young Child\n\nIt can also refer to a small, aggressive dog like a chihuahua.\n\n7. Bogan – An Uncultured or Unsophisticated Person\n\nA “bogan” is an uncouth or unrefined person regarded as being of low social status. The term is usually pejorative, but it can also be regarded as a joke between friends.\n\n8. Bush Telly – What You Watch at Night When You Are Camping\n\nYou heard “telly” before, but “bush telly”? That’s a new one. Basically, when you are camping, you can’t watch traditional television, so you watch the “bush telly”: the campfire, the stars or just… the bush.\n\n9. Bikkie – Biscuit\n\nYou’ll ask for a “bikkie” just to hear yourself say it.\n\nThere’s also the very cute expression “to cost big bikkies”, meaning that something is very expensive.\n\n10. Mate – Friend\n\nOi, mate! This one’s a classic. You ought to use it. Additionally, you can also say “cobber”.\n\nAustralian Slang Phrases Only Local Aussies Know\n\nAustralian slangTranslation ace! excellent, very good agro aggressive arvo afternoon Aussie salute brushing away flies with your hand avo avocado bathers/cozzies/togs swimsuit billabong a pond in a dry riverbend billy teapot bities biting insects bizzo business bloke man or guy bloody very bludger a lazy person bonzer great, awesome, first-rate booze bus police car used for catching drunk drivers bottle-o liquor shop bouncy mouse kangaroo brolly umbrella Bruce an Australian bloke Buckley's chance no hope bush forest cabbie taxi driver cactus beaten, dead, finished, not working chewie chewing gum chokkie chocolate Chrissie Christmas chuck a darkie get angry cobber friend coldie beer convo conversation crikey mikey snake dag a funny and likeable person daks trousers or pants defo definitely devo devastated dingo’s breakfast no breakfast dinkum unquestionably good or genuine dog’s breakfast complete chaos, mess esky portable cooler exy expensive fanny vagina footy football furphy erroneous or improbable story g’day! good day! grog alcohol hard yakka hard work in the nuddy naked joey baby kangaroo kindie kindergarten lappy laptop lippie lipstick liquid laugh vomit lollies sweets Maccas McDonald's mad as a cut snake very angry mozzie mosquito mushie mushroom nowt nothing oldies parents outback the vast (usually arid) interior and rural part of Australia pash a passionate kiss polly politician pressie present rightio right, ok roadie a beer you buy to take away with you roo kangaroo servo gas station she’ll be right it’ll be alright sheila woman or female sickie sick day sky gator airplane smoko cigarette break snag sausage sparkie electrician Straya Australia Strewth! exclamation meaning God’s truth sunbake sunbathe sunnies sunglasses tallie 750ml bottle of beer tea dinner thongs flip-flops truckie truck driver tucker food u-ey (pronounced “u-ee”) u-turn woop woop the middle of nowhere ya you yonks a long time you beauty! fantastic, great\n\nFunny Australian Slang Phrases\n\nIf it weren’t for this list, you’d need an Australian slang translator when you hear these Australian slang phrases! Use them in your day-to-day conversations and Aussies might think you’re one of their own.\n\n1. What’s the John Dory?\n\nWhat’s going on?\n\nJohn Dory is an edible fish found on the coasts of Africa, Southeast Asia, New Zealand, and – of course – Australia. There’s no secret story to it apart from the fact that it just rhymes with ‘story’. So, instead of asking, “what’s the story?”, in Australian slang, you ask “what’s the John Dory?”.\n\n2. Chuck a sickie\n\nCall in sick without actually being sick.\n\nIf you ever took a day off work pretending to be sick, you’re guilty of chucking a sickie. “I’m chucking a sickie to go to the beach. Wanna join?”\n\n3. Fair dinkum!\n\nHonest, true or genuine.\n\nPopular Australian exclamation often used to emphasize or seek confirmation (if used with the proper intonation) of the genuineness or truth of something. “This pork barbie is fair dinkum!”\n\n4. Wrap your laughing gear ‘round that\n\nEat that.\n\nWhat’s your laughing gear? Your mouth, of course. So, when you wrap your laughing gear ‘round something, you… eat it. It can be used in either a friendly or threatening way.\n\n5. Carrying on like a pork chop\n\nTo behave foolishly.\n\nLet me get my Australian slang translator for this one. 😅\n\nIt seems that this phrase has had a lot of variations:\n\nCarrying on like a pork chop in Jerusalem on a Saturday.\n\nCarrying on like a pork chop at a Jewish wedding.\n\nCarrying on like a pork chop in a synagogue.\n\nWhile the original message referred to an object that is out of place, the modern meaning has slightly shifted. So, when you hear someone using this Australian slang phrase, know that they are referring to someone who behaves foolishly, makes a fuss, complains, or rants.\n\n6. Dog’s breakfast\n\nComplete chaos, mess.\n\nYou can think of it this way: what does a dog’s breakfast consist of? Leftovers. Chicken bones or maybe a half-eaten pizza from last night. So, if something is really messy or disordered, then it looks like a dog’s breakfast.\n\n7. Do the Harry\n\nDisappear.\n\nThe complete phrase is known as “to do a Harold Holt”, which is rhyming slang for “bolt”. The story behind this Australian slang phrase is related to Harold Holt, the 17th prime minister of Australia. In 1967, Mr. Holt disappeared, presumably by drowning, while swimming along Victoria’s coast.\n\nSome say he “did the bolt” from his responsibilities as a prime minister.\n\n8. No worries, mate, she’ll be apples\n\nEverything will be fine.\n\nAlso known as “she’ll be right”, these positive expressions reflect the Australian way of looking at unfortunate events. There’s no point in worrying about anything, as it will all be alright in the end.\n\nLoading poll ...\n\nComing Soon\n\nWhat's your favorite Australian slang term?\n\n{{ row.Answer_Title }} {{ row.Answer_Title }} {{row.tsp_result_percent}} % {{row.Answer_Votes}} {{row.Answer_Votes}} ( {{row.tsp_result_percent}} % ) {{ tsp_result_no }} {{row.tsp_result_percent}} % {{row.Answer_Votes}} {{row.Answer_Votes}} ( {{row.tsp_result_percent}} % ) {{ tsp_result_no }}\n\nWhat You Need to Know About Aussie Slang\n\nWhether you want to move to the Australian paradise, spend a holiday there to visit the Irwin family’s Australia Zoo, or just learn the Australian slang because you feel like spicing up your English vocabulary, there are a few things you need to remember:\n\nthe term for Aussie slang and pronunciation is “strine”;\n\nAustralian slang is often characterized by making words as short as possible but also as cute and as funny as possible!\n\nif you want to sound like a true Aussie, you should speak through clenched teeth to stop blowflies from getting into your mouth.
