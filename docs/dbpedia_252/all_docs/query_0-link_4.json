        "text": "NEW YORK — Columbia Athletics and the Columbia men's soccer program learned of the loss of Stephen Mang-Lok Low, Class of 1972. Low passed away Wednesday, August 18, in New York at the age of 72.\n\nLow came to Columbia in 1969 and played three seasons for the Lions. In 1970, he anchored a Lions defense that earned the program's first trip to the NCAA Tournament, earning one of four bids to participate in the New York State Regional Playoff of the NCAA Championships. Co-captained by Rocco B. Commisso '71SEAS, '75BUS and Len Renery '71CC, Columbia went 9-4-0 that season, which marked the most wins in program history at the time.\n\nLow and men's soccer greats Renery and Mike Vorkas '71CC were all named to the 1970 NSCAA All-Region First Team. The trio are the first three NSCAA All-Region picks in Columbia soccer history. Low was also named All-Ivy League that year, along with teammates Renery, Vorkas, Commisso and Omar Chamma '71CC. He followed it up with another All-Ivy selection in his final season as a Lion in 1971.\n\nLow is survived by his wife, June Suk-Yee Low; son, Dwight; two daughters, Sonia and Sophia; and four grandchildren.\n\nViewing hours will be held on Friday, August 27, from 3-7 p.m., and Saturday, August 28 from 9-10:30 a.m. at Ng Fook Funeral Services, LLC, New York, NY.\n\nThe funeral procession will be held at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday at Ng Fook Funeral Services, LLC, New York, NY with officiating. Burial will be held at Evergreens Cemetery, Brooklyn later that day at 11:30 a.m."
