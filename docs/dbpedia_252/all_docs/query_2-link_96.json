        "text": "This article is about the Gem Type. You may be looking for another Pearl.\n\nPearls were servants on Homeworld, acting as custom-made Gems with the purpose of serving their owner. All Pearls shown have been voiced by Deedee Magno-Hall.\n\nRole[]\n\nMain article: Caste System\n\nPearls were low-ranking Gems in the strictly regimented Homeworld hierarchical system, functioning as attendants to high-ranking Gems. They combine the duties of a variety of different service roles, such as a lady-in-waiting (tending to and making requests on behalf of her master), footman (opening doors and announcing their master's arrival), and secretary (carrying out clerical tasks). While not primarily an entertainer like a Spinel, Pearls do nonetheless act as companions and provide simple luxuries such as singing, dancing, and projecting visual entertainment via holograms. One of their most unique functions is their ability to hold and store inside their Gem a seemingly limitless number of their owner's belongings.\n\nPearls are seen as status symbols of the Gems who own them. While Peridot describes them as \"someone's shiny toy\" and also mentions that there are hundreds of them on Homeworld, it is nevertheless implied that they're reserved only for noteworthy Gems of high social standing such as the Diamonds and aristocrats like Sapphires. She underlies this by commenting that the idea of a Peridot owning a Pearl is unprecedented. Pearls may also be earned by committing a significant act of merit, as \"Eyeball\" believed she would be rewarded with her very own Pearl for capturing Rose Quartz.\n\nGems that are worthy of a Pearl could be Gems that have served great purposes or are rare such as Sapphires, Morganites, Jades, Aquamarines, Emeralds, Garnets, and of course, Diamonds. All Gems with a high status are allowed to have Pearls.\n\nPearls live to serve and their identity is fundamentally tied to their owner. They are expected to be utterly submissive and obedient, simply waiting on their owners and not acting independently in any way. Yellow Pearl even claims that her feelings \"are irrelevant\" when Steven asks her what she likes to do. When formed for the first time, their Gem emerges from a holographic oyster after they learn their superiorâ€™s preferred name. They are expected to consistently exhibit subservience by remaining silent unless spoken to and remaining a few paces behind their superior when walking with them. It is physically impossible for a Pearl to disobey a direct order from their owner,[1] and are normally dismissed with the phrase \"that will be all\" generally followed by the owner clapping her hands twice when they are no longer needed. There are exceptions to these rules depending on who the Pearl belongs to, such as those of the Diamonds. Yellow Pearl is able to get away with talking down to Gems higher in the caste system whenever she feels they would disturb Yellow Diamond, and clearly relishes the opportunity to do so. White Pearl was seen (and feared) as an extension of White Diamond's will, making even the other Diamonds tread lightly in her presence.\n\nFurthermore, while a Pearl has to obey their owner, they can get around it if there is a loophole. For example, if someone orders their Pearl not to tell anyone a secret, the Pearl can show evidence towards the truth like their memories. If something has compromised the order in any way, the Pearl will be free from it.\n\nPearls were made and repaired in The Reef, which also served as a boutique and trinket shop of sorts where their owners could obtain things for them to use and wear.\n\nPhysical Characteristics[]\n\nPhysically, all Pearls appear to have a slender, androgynous form and a beak-like nose. They can also be \"customized\" by owners in color and appearance, allowing them to have very noticeable differences from each other, unlike most other types of Gems who would normally wear near identical uniforms and have very similar, if not exact, colors. One can have the option to have a default Pearl.\n\nMost Homeworld Pearls tend to wear some form of skin-tight, balletic clothing, such as a singlet or body suit, with a flowy sheer material attached to reflect a certain element of their owner's clothing. The position of their gemstone also matches that of their owner, but there can be exceptions like Pink's second Pearl.\n\nA default setting Pearl would have an ivory complexion, light cyan eyes, and peach hair styled in a point. They would wear a short dress with all four of the Diamonds' colors. The top half has puffy blue shoulders, an amber-colored top with a V neck, a pink diamond-shaped cutout at the bottom, and a light yellow trim along the bottom. The bottom half has a pink skirt with pink transparent drapes over it and pale blue ballet flats.\n\nNotable Pearls[]\n\nPearl- A renegade default setting Pearl and the sole confidant of Pink Diamond, later known as Rose Quartz. She, along with Rose, founded the Crystal Gems.\n\nBlue Pearl - A quiet Pearl who served Blue Diamond.\n\nYellow Pearl - A sassy Pearl who served Yellow Diamond.\n\nPink Pearl, AKA Volleyball - Pink Diamond's first Pearl, who was taken away and mind controlled by White Diamond when Pink \"misbehaved\" one too many times.\n\nOther Pearls[]\n\nRhodonite's component Pearl - One of Rhodonite's component Gems, who previously belonged to a Morganite before deciding to remain permanently fused with her owner's Ruby bodyguard. Her gemstone is on her chest.\n\nSame Old World[]\n\nIn the Flashback of Lapis Lazuli in \"The Same Old World\" the silhouette of a Gem that appears to be a Pearl with hair similar to Yellow Pearl. It is most likely Yellow Pearl as her silhouette is almost identical and she would have been on Earth at this time, but it has yet to be confirmed.\n\nSteven Universe: The Movie[]\n\nA Pearl can be seen from behind in an unknown gem city watching Steven's message.\n\nImage Gemstone Physical Information Other Info Pearlâ€™s gemstone is located in an unknown place. Pearl has very light green skin, unknown colored eyes, and ivory hair. She was seen in the beginning of Steven Universe: The Movie.\n\n\"Volleyball\"[]\n\nHolograms of several Pearls modeling various outfits are seen at The Reef. It is unclear if these holograms were based on actual Pearls, or if they're merely examples of what a Pearl can look like.\n\nImage Gemstone Physical Information\n\nHer gemstone is located on her navel. It is oval.\n\nShe has short thick pixie cut hair. She wears a bodysuit with short puffy sleeves and a diamond-shaped cut out at her navel. A short sheer skirt is attached to the bodysuit.\n\nHer gemstone is located on her chest. It is oval.\n\nShe has a bob cut hairstyle and wears a simple sleeveless crop top with a skirt that fans out into large sheer ruffles. Her gemstone placement is unknown. She has long thick hair with two diamond-shaped bows. She wears a sleeveless one strapped bodysuit with a knee-length sheer skirt attached at the abdomen.\n\nHer gemstone placement is on her navel. It is oval.\n\nHer hair is very short with a sheer veil-like accessory at the back of her head. She wears a sleeveless, three quarter length bodysuit with a diamond insignia on her stomach. A short sheer skirt is attached around her waist. Her gemstone is located on her chest. It is oval.\n\nShe has pixie style hair cut with long bangs covering one of her eyes.\n\nShe wears a wide-rimmed pointed hat and a sleeveless bodysuit with a short sheer skirt attached to her waist.\n\nHer gemstone is located on her sternum. It is oval.\n\nShe has a very angular bob cut hairstyle with bangs covering her forehead. she wears a short dress with long sheer sleeves and a belt.\n\n\"Homeworld Bound\"[]\n\nAubergine Pearl - A Pearl who acts as a tour guide ever since the dismantling of the empire. In her debut episode, she can be seen leading a tour group comprised of Topaz, two corruption-scarred Nephrites, a Sapphire from the Era 3 ball, and a Peridot with square-shaped hair and bushy eyebrows.\n\nLevel 2 Canon[]\n\nLevel 2 Canon Section\n\nThis section contains informations on a subject that is considered \"level 2 canon\" and may be contradicted by the TV series.\n\nPearl - One of the three playable characters from Soundtrack Attack, having fled Homeworld because she was tired of taking orders.\n\nLonely Pearl - A Pearl that was accused of treason and left behind during The Rebellion. She was later Corrupted in the Diamonds' attack on Earth, becoming a moth-like creature.\n\nPearl Fusions[]\n\nMega Pearl - The fusion of Pearl and Pink Pearl, who debuted in the episode \"Volleyball\".\n\nTrivia[]\n\nPearls being seen as lesser and weaker Gems is likely a reference to the fact that pearls in real life arenâ€™t minerals but mineraloids.\n\nThe fact that pearls are made in biological processes and are associated with organic life also supports this.\n\nAccording to Ian Jones-Quartey, if Yellow Pearl and Blue Pearl fuse together they would form a bigger Pearl with combined colors.[2] This was later seen with Mega Pearl.\n\nAs revealed in Steven Universe The Movie, when a Pearl is first formed, a holographic clamshell will surround their gemstone. In this state, someone can claim ownership of said Pearl by stating their name, as well as make customizations to them.\n\nAlthough it is never stated within the show, Rebecca Sugar has gone on record to state \"Our Pearl never belonged to White, but White is involved of Pearls in general, so there is a connection, and thatâ€™s all I can really say at the moment.\" at SDCC 2019. This implies that White Diamond is directly involved with the creation of Pearls.[3]\n\nReferences"
