        "text": "What does this program do?\n\nAlso known as the Section 502 Direct Loan Program, this program assists low- and very-low-income applicants obtain decent, safe and sanitary housing in eligible rural areas by providing payment assistance to increase an applicant’s repayment ability. Payment assistance is a type of subsidy that reduces the mortgage payment for a short time. The amount of assistance is determined by the adjusted family income.\n\nWho may apply for this program\n\nA number of factors are considered when determining an applicant’s eligibility for Single Family Direct Home Loans. At a minimum, applicants interested in obtaining a direct loan must have an adjusted income that is at or below the applicable low-income limit for the area where they wish to buy a house and they must demonstrate a willingness and ability to repay debt.\n\nApplicants must:\n\nBe without decent, safe and sanitary housing\n\nBe unable to obtain a loan from other resources on terms and conditions that can reasonably be expected to meet\n\nAgree to occupy the property as your primary residence\n\nHave the legal capacity to incur a loan obligation\n\nMeet citizenship or eligible noncitizen requirements\n\nNot be suspended or debarred from participation in federal programs\n\nProperties financed with direct loan funds must:\n\nNot have market value in excess of the applicable area loan limit\n\nNot be designed for income producing activities\n\nBorrowers are required to repay all or a portion of the payment subsidy received over the life of the loan when the title to the property transfers or the borrower is no longer living in the dwelling.\n\nApplicants must meet income eligibility for a direct loan. Please select your state from the dropdown menu above.\n\nWhat is an eligible rural area?\n\nUtilizing the USDA Eligibility Site you can enter a specific address for determination or just search the map to review general eligible areas.\n\nHow may funds be used?\n\nLoan funds may be used to help low-income individuals or households purchase homes in rural areas. Funds can be used to build, repair, renovate or relocate a home, or to purchase and prepare sites, including providing water and sewage facilities.\n\nHow much may I borrow?\n\nUsing the Single Family Housing Direct Self- Assessment tool, potential applicants may enter information online to determine if the Section 502 Direct Loan Program is a good fit for them prior to applying. The tool will provide a preliminary review after a potential applicant enters information on their general household composition, monthly income, monthly debts, property location, estimated property taxes, and estimated hazard insurance. Potential applicants are welcome to submit a complete application for an official determination by USDA Rural Development (RD) regardless of the self-assessment results. Upon receipt of a complete application, RD will determine the applicant’s eligibility using verified information and the applicant’s maximum loan amount based on their repayment ability and the area loan limit for the county in which the property is located.\n\nWhat is the interest rate and payback period?\n\nEffective August 1, 2024, the current interest rate for Single Family Housing Direct home loans is 4.875% for low-income and very low-income borrowers.\n\nFixed interest rate based on current market rates at loan approval or loan closing, whichever is lower\n\nInterest rate when modified by payment assistance, can be as low as 1%\n\nUp to 33 year payback period - 38 year payback period for very low income applicants who can’t afford the 33 year loan term\n\nHow much down payment is required?\n\nNo down payment is typically required. Applicants with assets higher than the asset limits may be required to use a portion of those assets.\n\nIs there a deadline to apply?\n\nApplications for this program are accepted through your local RD office year round.\n\nHow long does an application take?\n\nProcessing times vary depending on funding availability and program demand in the area in which an applicant is interested in buying and completeness of the application package.\n\nWhat governs this program?\n\nThe Housing Act of 1949 as amended, 7 CFR, Part 3550,\n\nHB-1-3550 - Direct Single Family Housing Loans Field Office Handbook\n\nWhy does USDA Rural Development do this?\n\nUSDA Rural Development’s Section 502 Direct Loan Program provides a path to homeownership for low- and very-low-income families living in rural areas, and families who truly have no other way to make affordable homeownership a reality. Providing these affordable homeownership opportunities promotes prosperity, which in turn creates thriving communities and improves the quality of life in rural areas."
