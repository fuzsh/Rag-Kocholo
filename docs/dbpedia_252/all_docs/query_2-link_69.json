        "text": "Municipal water networks within industrialized countries typically rely on centralized treatment to manage piped water quality. Optimal water quality at the tap, however, requires well-maintained piped distribution networks, and performs best when piped systems are fully pressurized. In low-income cities such as Dhaka, water distribution networks are inadequately maintained and typically supply intermittent service; as such, they are vulnerable to recontamination during negative pressure events. Among populations accessing these types of improved water sources in urban settings (e.g. shared taps), it is unknown if consistent treatment to provide chlorinated water at the point of collection would have a significant health benefit. Furthermore, almost all previous studies of water treatment interventions in low-income countries have been unblinded with self-reported diarrhea as the main outcome, casting doubt that reported impacts of water disinfection on diarrhea are not due entirely to social desirability bias. Stanford University in collaboration with icddr,b will conduct a randomized evaluation to assess the impact on access to automatically chlorinated water on water quality and child health.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.

This study assesses the impact of a multi-faceted intervention between 2017 and 2021 to reduce lead-tainted turmeric in Bangladesh. The intervention involved: i) disseminating findings from scientific studies via news media that identified turmeric as a source of lead poisoning, ii) educating consumers and businesspeople about the risks of lead chromate in turmeric via public notices and face-to-face meetings, and iii) collaborating with the Bangladesh Food Safety Authority to utilize a rapid lead detection technology to enforce policy disallowing turmeric adulteration. Before and after the intervention, evidence of lead chromate turmeric adulteration was assessed at the nation's largest turmeric wholesale market and at turmeric polishing mills across the country. Blood lead levels of workers at two mills were also assessed. Forty-seven interviews were conducted with consumers, businesspeople, and government officials to assess changes in supply, demand, and regulatory capacity. The proportion of market turmeric samples containing detectable lead decreased from 47% pre-intervention in 2019 to 0% in 2021 (n = 631, p < 0.0001). The proportion of mills with direct evidence of lead chromate adulteration (pigment on-site) decreased from 30% pre-intervention in 2017 to 0% in 2021 (n = 33, p < 0.0001). Blood lead levels dropped a median of 30% (IQR: 21-43%), while the 90th percentile dropped 49% from 18.2 μg/dL to 9.2 μg/dL 16 months after the intervention (n = 15, p = 0.033). Media attention, credible information, rapid lead detection tools and swift government action to enforce penalties all contributed to the intervention's success. Subsequent efforts should evaluate if this is an example of an effective intervention that can be replicated to reduce lead chromate adulteration of spices globally.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.envres.2023.116328\n\nView details for PubMedID 37286126\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging, bat-borne pathogen that can be transmitted from person-to-person. Vaccines are currently being developed for NiV, and studies have been funded to evaluate their safety and immunogenicity. An important unanswered question is whether it will be possible to evaluate the efficacy of vaccine candidates in phase III clinical trials in a context where spillovers from the zoonotic reservoir are infrequent and associated with small outbreaks. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of conducting a phase III vaccine trial in Bangladesh, the only country regularly reporting NiV cases.METHODS: We used simulations based on previously observed NiV cases from Bangladesh, an assumed vaccine efficacy of 90% and other NiV vaccine target characteristics, to compare three vaccination study designs: (i) cluster randomized ring vaccination, (ii) cluster randomized mass vaccination, and (iii) an observational case-control study design.RESULTS: The simulations showed that, assuming a ramp-up period of 10days and a mean hospitalization delay of 4days,a cluster-randomized ring vaccination trial would require 516years and over 163,000 vaccine doses to run a ring vaccination trial under current epidemic conditions. A cluster-randomized mass vaccination trial in the two most affected districts would take 43years and 1.83 million vaccine doses. An observational case-control design in these two districts would require seven years and 2.5 million vaccine doses.DISCUSSION: Without a change in the epidemiology of NiV, ring vaccination or mass vaccination trials are unlikely to be completed within a reasonable time window. In this light, the remaining options are: (i) not conducting a phase III trial until the epidemiology of NiV changes, (ii) identifying alternative ways to licensure such as observational studies or controlled studies in animals such as in the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Animal Rule.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.027\n\nView details for PubMedID 34426025\n\nAbstract\n\nImproving compliance with environmental regulations is critical for promoting clean environments and healthy populations. In South Asia, brick manufacturing is a major source of pollution but is dominated by small-scale, informal producers who are difficult to monitor and regulate-a common challenge in low-income settings. We demonstrate a low-cost, scalable approach for locating brick kilns in high-resolution satellite imagery from Bangladesh. Our approach identifies kilns with 94.2% accuracy and 88.7% precision and extracts the precise GPS coordinates of every brick kiln across Bangladesh. Using these estimates, we show that at least 12% of the population of Bangladesh (>18 million people) live within 1 km of a kiln and that 77% and 9% of kilns are (illegally) within 1 km of schools and health facilities, respectively. Finally, we show how kilns contribute up to 20.4 mug/[Formula: see text] of [Formula: see text] (particulate matter of a diameter less than 2.5 mum) in Dhaka when the wind blows from an unfavorable direction. We document inaccuracies and potential bias with respect to local regulations in the government data. Our approach demonstrates how machine learning and Earth observation can be combined to better understand the extent and implications of regulatory compliance in informal industry.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1073/pnas.2018863118\n\nView details for PubMedID 33888583\n\nAbstract\n\nMultiple bacteria, viruses, protists, and helminths cause enteric infections that greatly impact human health and wellbeing. These enteropathogens are transmited via several pathways through human, animal, and environmental reservoirs. Individual qPCR assays have been extensively used to detect enteropathogens within these types of samples, whereas the TaqMan array card (TAC), which allows simultaneous detection of multiple enteropathogens, has only previously been validated in human clinical samples.In this methodological comparison study, we compared the performance of a custom 48-singleplex TAC relative to standard qPCR. We established the sensitivity and specificity of each method for the detection of eight enteric targets, by using spiked samples with varying levels of PCR inhibition. We then tested the prevalence and abundance of pathogens in wastewater from Melbourne (Australia), and human, animal, and environmental samples from informal settlements in Suva, Fiji using both TAC and qPCR.Both methods exhibited similarly h specificity (TAC 100%, qPCR 94%), sensitivity (TAC 92%, qPCR 100%), and quantitation accuracy (TAC 91%, qPCR 99%) in non-inhibited sample matrices with spiked gene fragments. PCR inhibitors substantially affected detection via TAC, though this issue was alleviated by ten-fold sample dilution. Among samples from informal settlements, the two techniques performed similarly for detection (89% agreement) and quantitation (R2 0·82) for the eight enteropathogen targets. The TAC additionally included 38 other enteric targets, enabling detection of diverse faecal pathogens and extensive environmental contamination that would be prohibitively labour intensive to assay by standard qPCR.The two techniques produced similar results across diverse sample types, with qPCR prioritising greater sensitivity and quantitation accuracy, and TAC trading small reductions in these for a cost-effective larger enteropathogen panel enabling a greater number of enteric pathogens to be analysed concurrently, which is beneficial given the abundance and variety of enteric pathogens in environments such as urban informal settlements. The ability to monitor multiple enteric pathogens across diverse reservoirs could allow better resolution of pathogen exposure pathways, and the design and monitoring of interventions to reduce pathogen load.Wellcome Trust Our Planet, Our Health programme.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S2542-5196(21)00051-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 33964239\n\nAbstract\n\nAir pollution in the form of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been linked to adverse respiratory outcomes in children. However, the magnitude of this association in South Asia and sources of PM2.5 that drive adverse health effects are largely unknown. This study evaluates associations between short-term variation in ambient PM2.5 and incidence of pneumonia and upper respiratory infections among children in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We also perform an exploratory analysis of the PM2.5 source composition that is most strongly associated with health endpoints. We leveraged data from health surveillance of children less than five years of age between 2005 and 2014 in Kamalapur, Bangladesh, including daily physician-confirmed diagnoses of pneumonia and upper respiratory infection. Twice-weekly source-apportioned ambient PM2.5 measurements were obtained for the same period, and Poisson regression adjusted for time-varying covariates was used to estimate lagged associations between ambient PM2.5 and respiratory infection. We use complementary matching and stratification approaches to evaluate whether these associations vary across PM2.5 source composition. Total PM2.5 mass was associated with a modest increase in incidence of pneumonia, with a peak effect size two days after exposure (rate ratio = 1.032; 95% confidence interval = 1.008-1.056). We did not identify a significant association between PM2.5 and upper respiratory infection. Stratified and matching analyses suggested this association was stronger among days when ambient PM2.5 had a higher mass percent associated with brick kiln and fugitive lead emissions.: This study suggests that elevated ambient PM2.5 contributes to increased incidence of child pneumonia in urban Dhaka, and that this relationship varies among days with different source composition of PM2.5.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118073\n\nView details for PubMedID 34496331\n\nAbstract\n\nLead (Pb) exposure is a major public health problem worldwide. Although high levels of Pb in blood in Bangladesh have been documented, the dominant Pb sources contributing to human exposure in rural Bangladesh have not been determined. Here, we first obtained blood from pregnant women from three rural Bangladeshi districts who were previously assessed by a case-control and sampling study, and we then conducted semistructured in-depth interviews to understand Pb exposure behavior and finally collected samples of the suspected Pb sources. We measured the Pb isotopic composition of both potential Pb sources and 45 blood samples in order to understand which of three sources predominate: (1) food from Pb-soldered cans, (2) turmeric, or (3) geophagous materials (clay, soil, or ash). The Pb isotope ratios of the three sources are distinct (p = 0.0001) and blood isotope ratios are most similar to turmeric. Elevated lead and chromium (Cr) concentrations in turmeric and a yellow pigment used in turmeric processing are consistent with reported consumption behavior that indicated turmeric as a primary contributor to blood Pb. The Pb isotopic composition analyses combined with a case-control and sampling approach provides evidence that turmeric adulterated with the yellow Pb-bearing pigment is the main Pb exposure source in these districts and illustrates the need to assess drivers and practices of turmeric adulteration, as well as the prevalence of adulteration across South Asia.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.est.9b00744\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000488993500041\n\nView details for PubMedID 31525910\n\nAbstract\n\nAdulteration is a growing food safety concern worldwide. Previous studies have implicated turmeric as a source of lead (Pb) exposure due to the addition of lead chromate (PbCrO4), a yellow pigment used to enhance brightness. We aimed to assess the practice of adding yellow pigments to turmeric and producer- consumer- and regulatory-factors affecting this practice across the supply chain in Bangladesh. We identified and visited the nine major turmeric-producing districts of Bangladesh as well as two districts with minimal turmeric production. In each district, we conducted semi-structured interviews and informal observations with individuals involved in the production, consumption, and regulation of turmeric. We explored perceptions of and preferences for turmeric quality. We collected samples of yellow pigments and turmeric from the most-frequented wholesale and retail markets. We collected samples of turmeric, pigments, dust, and soil from turmeric polishing mills to assess evidence of adulteration. Interviews were analyzed through an inductive, thematic coding process, with attention focused on perceptions of and preferences for turmeric quality. Samples were analyzed for Pb and chromium (Cr) concentrations via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and x-ray fluorescence. In total, we interviewed 152 individuals from across the supply chain and collected 524 samples of turmeric, pigments, dust, and soil (Table S3, Table S4). Turmeric Pb and Cr concentrations were highest in Dhaka and Munshiganj districts, with maximum turmeric powder Pb concentrations of 1152 μg/g, compared to 690 μg/g in the 9 major turmeric-producing districts. We found evidence of PbCrO4-based yellow pigment adulteration in 7 of the 9 major turmeric-producing districts. Soil samples from polishing mills contained a maximum of 4257 μg/g Pb and yellow pigments contained 2-10% Pb by weight with an average Pb:Cr molar ratio of 1.3. Turmeric wholesalers reported that the practice of adding yellow pigments to dried turmeric root during polishing began more than 30 years ago and continues today, primarily driven by consumer preferences for colorful yellow curries. Farmers stated that merchants are able to sell otherwise poor-quality roots and increase their profits by asking polishers to adulterate with yellow pigments. Adulterating turmeric with lead chromate poses significant risks to human health and development. The results from this study indicate that PbCrO4 is being added to turmeric by polishers, who are unaware of its neurotoxic effects, in order to satisfy wholesalers who are driven by consumer demand for yellow roots. We recommend immediate intervention that engages turmeric producers and consumers to address this public health crisis and ensure a future with Pb-free turmeric.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.envres.2019.108722\n\nView details for PubMedID 31550596\n\nAbstract\n\nShallow tubewells are the primary drinking water source for most rural Bangladeshis. Fecal contamination has been detected in tubewells, at low concentrations at the source and at higher levels at the point of use. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess whether improving the microbiological quality of tubewell drinking water by household water treatment and safe storage would reduce diarrhea in children <2 years in rural Bangladesh.We randomly assigned 1800 households with a child aged 6-18 months (index child) into one of three arms: chlorine plus safe storage, safe storage and control. We followed households with monthly visits for one year to promote the interventions, track their uptake, test participants' source and stored water for fecal contamination, and record caregiver-reported child diarrhea prevalence (primary outcome). To assess reporting bias, we also collected data on health outcomes that are not expected to be impacted by our interventions.Both interventions had high uptake. Safe storage, alone or combined with chlorination, reduced heavy contamination of stored water. Compared to controls, diarrhea in index children was reduced by 36% in the chlorine plus safe storage arm (prevalence ratio, PR = 0.64, 0.55-0.73) and 31% in the safe storage arm (PR = 0.69, 0.60-0.80), with no difference between the two intervention arms. One limitation of the study was the non-blinded design with self-reported outcomes. However, the prevalence of health outcomes not expected to be impacted by water interventions did not differ between study arms, suggesting minimal reporting bias.Safe storage significantly improved drinking water quality at the point of use and reduced child diarrhea in rural Bangladesh. There was no added benefit from combining safe storage with chlorination. Efforts should be undertaken to implement and evaluate long-term efforts for safe water storage in Bangladesh.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01350063.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0121907\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000352133600126\n\nView details for PubMedID 25816342\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC4376788\n\nAbstract\n\nPromotion and provision of low-cost technologies that enable improved water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices are seen as viable solutions for reducing high rates of morbidity and mortality due to enteric illnesses in low-income countries. A number of theoretical models, explanatory frameworks, and decision-making models have emerged which attempt to guide behaviour change interventions related to WASH. The design and evaluation of such interventions would benefit from a synthesis of this body of theory informing WASH behaviour change and maintenance.We completed a systematic review of existing models and frameworks through a search of related articles available in PubMed and in the grey literature. Information on the organization of behavioural determinants was extracted from the references that fulfilled the selection criteria and synthesized. Results from this synthesis were combined with other relevant literature, and from feedback through concurrent formative and pilot research conducted in the context of two cluster-randomized trials on the efficacy of WASH behaviour change interventions to inform the development of a framework to guide the development and evaluation of WASH interventions: the Integrated Behavioural Model for Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (IBM-WASH).We identified 15 WASH-specific theoretical models, behaviour change frameworks, or programmatic models, of which 9 addressed our review questions. Existing models under-represented the potential role of technology in influencing behavioural outcomes, focused on individual-level behavioural determinants, and had largely ignored the role of the physical and natural environment. IBM-WASH attempts to correct this by acknowledging three dimensions (Contextual Factors, Psychosocial Factors, and Technology Factors) that operate on five-levels (structural, community, household, individual, and habitual).A number of WASH-specific models and frameworks exist, yet with some limitations. The IBM-WASH model aims to provide both a conceptual and practical tool for improving our understanding and evaluation of the multi-level multi-dimensional factors that influence water, sanitation, and hygiene practices in infrastructure-constrained settings. We outline future applications of our proposed model as well as future research priorities needed to advance our understanding of the sustained adoption of water, sanitation, and hygiene technologies and practices.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/1471-2458-13-1015\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000329290200003\n\nView details for PubMedID 24160869\n\nAbstract\n\nNipah virus, a paramyxovirus whose wildlife reservoir is Pteropus bats, was first discovered in a large outbreak of acute encephalitis in Malaysia in 1998 among persons who had contact with sick pigs. Apparently, one or more pigs was infected from bats, and the virus then spread efficiently from pig to pig, then from pigs to people. Nipah virus outbreaks have been recognized nearly every year in Bangladesh since 2001 and occasionally in neighboring India. Outbreaks in Bangladesh and India have been characterized by frequent person-to-person transmission and the death of over 70% of infected people. Characteristics of Nipah virus that increase its risk of becoming a global pandemic include: humans are already susceptible; many strains are capable of limited person-to-person transmission; as an RNA virus, it has an exceptionally high rate of mutation: and that if a human-adapted strain were to infect communities in South Asia, high population densities and global interconnectedness would rapidly spread the infection. Appropriate steps to estimate and manage this risk include studies to explore the molecular and genetic basis of respiratory transmission of henipaviruses, improved surveillance for human infections, support from high-income countries to reduce the risk of person-to-person transmission of infectious agents in low-income health care settings, and consideration of vaccination in communities at ongoing risk of exposure to the secretions and excretions of Pteropus bats.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.07.011\n\nView details for PubMedID 23911335\n\nAbstract\n\nChildren in low- and middle-income countries face an increased risk of impaired cognitive development due to contaminated environments, poor nutrition, and inadequate responsive stimulation from caregivers. Implementing multi-component, community-level interventions may reduce these risks; however, there is little evidence supporting implementation of these interventions at scale. We assessed the feasibility of implementing a group-based intervention that included responsive stimulation, maternal and child nutrition, water and sanitation, and childhood lead exposure prevention through the government health system in Chatmohar, Bangladesh. After implementation, we conducted 17 in-depth interviews with frontline health service providers and 12 key informant interviews with their supervisors and managers to explore the facilitators and difficulties implementing such a complex programme within the health system. Factors facilitating implementation included: high quality training and skill level of providers, support from community members, family, and supervisors, positive relationships between providers and participants, and provision of children's toys and books free of cost. Difficulties included increased workload of the providers, complicated group-based yet stage-specific delivery where providers had to manage a large group of mother-child dyads representing many different child age-groups at once, and logistics difficulties in providing toys and books through a centralised health system process. Key informants made suggestions to ensure effective government-level scale-up including engaging relevant NGOs as partners, identifying feasible ways to make toys available, and offering providers meaningful even if non-monetary rewards. These findings can be used to shape the design and delivery of multi-component child development interventions to be delivered through the health system.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/hpm.3647\n\nView details for PubMedID 37132061\n\nAbstract\n\nBats, rodents and monkeys are reservoirs for emerging zoonotic infections. We sought to describe the frequency of human exposure to these animals and the seasonal and geographic variation of these exposures in Bangladesh. During 2013-2016, we conducted a cross-sectional survey in a nationally representative sample of 10,002 households from 1001 randomly selected communities. We interviewed household members about exposures to bats, rodents and monkeys, including a key human-bat interface-raw date palm sap consumption. Respondents reported observing rodents (90%), bats (52%) and monkeys (2%) in or around their households, although fewer reported direct contact. The presence of monkeys around the household was reported more often in Sylhet division (7%) compared to other divisions. Households in Khulna (17%) and Rajshahi (13%) were more likely to report drinking date palm sap than in other divisions (1.5-5.6%). Date palm sap was mostly consumed during winter with higher frequencies in January (16%) and February (12%) than in other months (0-5.6%). There was a decreasing trend in drinking sap over the three years. Overall, we observed substantial geographic and seasonal patterns in human exposure to animals that could be sources of zoonotic disease. These findings could facilitate targeting emerging zoonoses surveillance, research and prevention efforts to areas and seasons with the highest levels of exposure.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s10393-023-01628-9\n\nView details for PubMedID 37099204\n\nAbstract\n\nThe majority of disease transmission during the 2014-16 West Africa Ebola epidemic was driven by community-based behaviors that proved difficult to change in a social paradigm of misinformation, denial, and deep-seated distrust of government representatives and institutions. In Liberia, perceptions and beliefs about Ebola during and since the epidemic can provide insights useful to public health strategies aimed at improving community preparedness. In this 2018 study, we conducted nine focus groups with Liberians from three communities who experienced Ebola differently, to evaluate behaviors, attitudes, and trust during and after the epidemic. Focus group participants reported that some behaviors adopted during Ebola have persisted (e.g. handwashing and caretaking practices), while others have reverted (e.g. physical proximity and funeral customs); and reported ongoing distrust of the government and denial of the Ebola epidemic. These findings suggest that a lack of trust in the biomedical paradigm and government health institutions persists in Liberia. Future public health information campaigns may benefit from community engagement addressed at understanding beliefs and sources of trust and mistrust in the community to effect behavior change and improve community-level epidemic preparedness.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s12889-023-15559-1\n\nView details for PubMedID 37046227\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID 6886773\n\nAbstract\n\nThe WHO recommends vaccines for prevention and control of typhoid fever, especially where antimicrobial-resistant typhoid circulates. In 2018 the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC), implemented a TCV campaign. The campaign targeted all children aged 9-months through 14-years within NMMC boundaries (∼320,000 children) over 2 vaccination phases. The phase 1 campaign occurred from July 14-August 25, 2018 (71% coverage, ∼113,420 children). We evaluated the phase 1 campaign's programmatic effectiveness in reducing typhoid cases at the community level.We established prospective, blood culture-based surveillance at 6 hospitals in Navi Mumbai, offering blood cultures to children presenting with fever ≥ 3 days. We employed a cluster-randomized (by administrative boundary) test-negative design to estimate the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign on pediatric typhoid cases. We matched test-positive, culture-confirmed typhoid cases with up to 3 test-negative, culture-negative controls by age and date of blood culture and assessed community vaccine campaign phase as an exposure using conditional logistic regression.Between September 1, 2018-March 31, 2021, we identified 81 typhoid cases and matched these with 238 controls. Cases were 0.44 times as likely to live in vaccine campaign communities (programmatic effectiveness, 56%, 95%CI: 25%-74%, p=0.002). Cases ≥ 5-years-old were 0.37 times as likely (95% CI: 0.19-0.70; p-value = 0.002) and cases during the first year of surveillance were 0.30 times as likely (95% CI: 0.14-0.64; p-value = 0.002) to live in vaccine campaign communities.Our findings support the use of TCV mass vaccination campaigns as effective population-based tools to combat typhoid fever.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/cid/ciad132\n\nView details for PubMedID 36947143\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Sanitation interventions typically result in modest increases in latrine access, and any gains in latrine access and use are often not sustained over time. Sanitation programs also rarely include child-focused interventions such as potties. We aimed to assess the sustained effect of a multi-component sanitation intervention on access to and use of latrines and child feces management tools in rural Bangladesh.METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal substudy nested within the WASH Benefits randomized controlled trial. The trial provided latrine upgrades, child potties and sani-scoops for feces removal, along with behavior change promotion to encourage use of the delivered hardware. Promotion visits to intervention recipients were frequent during the first 2 years after intervention initiation, decreased in frequency between years 2-3, and ceased after 3 years. We enrolled a random subset of 720 households from the sanitation and control arms of the trial in a substudy and visited them quarterly between 1 and 3.5 years after intervention initiation. At each visit, field staff recorded sanitation-related behaviors through spot-check observations and structured questionnaires. We assessed intervention effects on observed indicators of hygienic latrine access, potty use and sani-scoop use and investigated whether these effects were modified by duration of follow-up, ongoing behavior change promotion and household characteristics.RESULTS: The intervention increased hygienic latrine access from 37% among controls to 94% in the sanitation arm (p<0.001). Access among intervention recipients remained high 3.5 years after intervention initiation, including periods with no active promotion. Gains in access were higher among households with less education, less wealth and larger number of residents. The intervention increased availability of child potties from 29% among controls to 98% in the sanitation arm (p<0.001). However, fewer than 25% of intervention households reported exclusive child defecation in a potty or had observed indicators of potty and sani-scoop use, and gains in potty use declined over the follow-up period, even with ongoing promotion.CONCLUSION: Our findings from an intervention that provided free products and intensive initial behavior change promotion suggest a sustained increase in hygienic latrine access up to 3.5 years after intervention initiation but infrequent use of child feces management tools. Studies should investigate strategies to ensure sustained adoption of safe child feces management practices.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ijheh.2023.114149\n\nView details for PubMedID 36913791\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Reliable and valid measurement of early child development are necessary for the design of effective interventions, programs, and policies to improve early child outcomes. One widely used measure in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III (Bayley-III). Alternatively, the Bangladeshi-adapted Ages and Stages Questionnaire Inventory (ASQ:I) can be administered more quickly, inexpensively, and with less training than the Bayley-III. We aimed to assess the concurrent validity of the Bangladeshi-adapted ASQ:I with the Bayley-III in children 4-27months old in rural Bangladesh.METHODS: The sample was a sub-sample (n=244) of endline participants from an evaluation of an early child development intervention (July-August 2018). We assessed concurrent validity between internally age-standardized domain-specific and total scores using Pearson correlations both overall and stratified by age and intervention status. We also assessed correlations between scores and variables theoretically related to child development including maternal education and stimulation in the home.RESULTS: The overall correlation between ASQ:I and Bayley-III total scores was moderate (r=0.42 95%CI: 0.30-0.53), with no systematic differences by intervention status. Overall, concurrent validity was highest for the gross motor domain (r=0.51, 0.40-0.60), and lowest for the fine motor domain (r=0.20, 0.04-0.33). Total ASQ:I and Bayley-III scores were positively correlated with child stimulation and maternal education.CONCLUSION: The Bangladeshi-adapted ASQ:I is a low-cost tool that can be feasibly administered in rural Bangladesh, is moderately correlated with the Bayley-III, and can be used to measure child development when human, time, or financial resources are constrained.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s12887-022-03800-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 36859070\n\nAbstract\n\nWater, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) improvements are promoted to reduce diarrhoea in low-income countries. However, trials from the past 5 years have found mixed effects of household-level and community-level WASH interventions on child health. Measuring pathogens and host-specific faecal markers in the environment can help investigate causal pathways between WASH and health by quantifying whether and by how much interventions reduce environmental exposure to enteric pathogens and faecal contamination from human and different animal sources. We aimed to assess the effects of WASH interventions on enteropathogens and microbial source tracking (MST) markers in environmental samples.We did a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis, which included searches from Jan 1, 2000, to Jan 5, 2023, from PubMed, Embase, CAB Direct Global Health, Agricultural and Environmental Science Database, Web of Science, and Scopus, of prospective studies with water, sanitation, or hygiene interventions and concurrent control group that measured pathogens or MST markers in environmental samples and measured child anthropometry, diarrhoea, or pathogen-specific infections. We used covariate-adjusted regression models with robust standard errors to estimate study-specific intervention effects and pooled effect estimates across studies using random-effects models.Few trials have measured the effect of sanitation interventions on pathogens and MST markers in the environment and they mostly focused on onsite sanitation. We extracted individual participant data on nine environmental assessments from five eligible trials. Environmental sampling included drinking water, hand rinses, soil, and flies. Interventions were consistently associated with reduced pathogen detection in the environment but effect estimates in most individual studies could not be distinguished from chance. Pooled across studies, we found a small reduction in the prevalence of any pathogen in any sample type (pooled prevalence ratio [PR] 0·94 [95% CI 0·90-0·99]). Interventions had no effect on the prevalence of MST markers from humans (pooled PR 1·00 [95% CI 0·88-1·13]) or animals (pooled PR 1·00 [95% CI 0·97-1·03]).The small effect of these sanitation interventions on pathogen detection and absence of effects on human or animal faecal markers are consistent with the small or null health effects previously reported in these trials. Our findings suggest that the basic sanitation interventions implemented in these studies did not contain human waste and did not adequately reduce exposure to enteropathogens in the environment.Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S2542-5196(23)00028-1\n\nView details for PubMedID 36889861\n\nAbstract\n\nThere is a paucity of recent research on direct water quantity measurement for personal and domestic hygiene. We aimed to measure the water quantity used for personal and domestic hygiene and to explore the reasons and determinants for variation of water usage. We conducted this study from September 2014 to June 2016 in a low-income urban community in Dhaka. In 12 households, the team conducted a day-long bimonthly ethnographic observation for one year to measure the volume of water used per activity per person. They conducted 28 in-depth interviews to explore the reasons for changes of water usage. Participants used a median of 75 L (61-100) of water per capita per day (LCPD) and of this 75 LCPD they used a median of 39 LCPD (26-58) for personal hygiene. Women used less water than men. Individual and social norms, beliefs, and weather determinants determined personal hygiene. Water availability determined domestic hygiene (e.g., washing dishes, toilets and bathrooms). This study helps to elucidate a range of determinants of water usage of the participants from the participants' perspective. The quantity of water used for domestic and personal hygiene and its relationship to fecal-oral transmitted disease can be explored in future research.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/ijerph192315656\n\nView details for PubMedID 36497732\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC9737866\n\nAbstract\n\nLead adulteration of spices, primarily via Pb chromate compounds, has been documented globally as a growing public health concern. Currently, Pb detection in spices relies primarily on expensive and time-consuming laboratory analyses. Advancing rapid Pb detection methods, inclusive of their accuracy and precision, would improve field assessments by food safety inspectors, stakeholders, and the public in the hope of reducing Pb exposure risks at its source. Here, we present two field procedures for Pb detection: portable X-ray fluorescence analysis (pXRF) and a simple colorimetric test. We assess their efficacy to detect Pb and its chemical form in seven spice types, including powders, spice-salt mixtures, and dried roots, compared to the proven laboratory technique, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Lead concentrations measured using pXRF and ICP-MS were within 5% of each other for spice powders and 24% for dried roots. By pXRF, spice samples were analyzed within collection plastic bags without preparation, resulting in a detection limit of 2 mg Pb/kg for spice powders, which is comparable to national food standards. The colorimetric test utilized here targets hexavalent chromium, making the method selective to Pb chromate adulteration assuming that this is its dominant source in spices. Color development, and thus detection, was observed when Pb concentrations exceeded approximately 5-70 mg/kg in dried turmeric roots and 1000 mg/kg in spice powders; however, it was ineffective for the spice-salt mixture. We show that pXRF analysis and a colorimetric assay provide information that may improve field decisions about Pb adulteration in a range of spice types, helping to minimize Pb exposure.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1021/acs.est.2c03241\n\nView details for PubMedID 36343212\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Cholera remains a public health threat for low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Asia and Africa. ShancholTM, an inactivated oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is currently in use globally. OCV and oral poliovirus vaccines (OPV) could be administered concomitantly but the immunogenicity and safety of coadministration among children aged 1-3 years is unknown.METHOD: We undertook an open-label, randomized, controlled, inequality trial in Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Healthy children aged 1-3 years were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: bivalent OPV (bOPV)-alone, OCV-alone, or combined bOPV+OCV and received vaccines on the day of enrollment and 28 days later. Blood samples were collected on the day of enrollment, day 28, and day 56. Serum poliovirus neutralizing antibodies and vibriocidal antibodies against V. cholerae O1 were assessed using microneutralization assays.RESULTS: A total of 579 children aged 1‒3 years were recruited, 193 children per group. More than 90% of the children completed visits at day 56. Few adverse events following immunization were recorded and were equivalent among study arms. On day 28, 60% (90% Confidence interval, 53%-67%) and 54% (46%-61%) of participants with co-administration of bOPV+OCV responded to polioviruses type 1 and 3 respectively, compared to 55% (47%-62%) and 46% (38%-53%) in the bOPV-only group. Additionally, >50% of participants showed a ≥4-fold increase in vibriocidal antibody titre responses on day 28, comparable to the responses observed in OCV-only arm.CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of bOPV and OCV is safe and effective in children aged 1-3 years and can be cost-beneficial.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/cid/ciac782\n\nView details for PubMedID 36136760\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Sanitation, Hygiene Education and Water Supply in Bangladesh Programme (SHEWA-B) was a 5-year intervention aiming to improve water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices among 20 million rural residents through community hygiene promoters. This analysis evaluates the impact of SHEWA-B on knowledge, behaviour and childhood diarrhoea outcomes.The evaluation included repeated cross-sectional surveys and health surveillance in matched cohorts in intervention and control clusters. Cross-sectional surveys and structured observations at baseline, midline, and endline assessed the availability of WASH technology, caregiver knowledge and behaviour. Fieldworkers collected monthly health data in a subset of control and intervention households to determine the prevalence of diarrhoea.Of 5091 households surveyed, participants residing in intervention clusters showed minimal improvements in knowledge, reported behaviour, or use of WASH technology compared to the control clusters. During structured observations, intervention households increased more than control households at handwashing before preparing food and after cleaning a baby's anus when comparing endline to baseline, but these changes were not seen when comparing endline to the midline. The prevalence of childhood diarrhoea remained similar in both groups before (10.2% in intervention, 10.0% in control) and after (8.8% in intervention, 11.7% in control) midline changes were made to improve the intervention. Intervention clusters showed no improvement in diarrhoea over time compared to control clusters.SHEWA-B's community-based WASH promotion did not yield the intended impact on knowledge, behaviour or health. Greater priority should be given to approaches that have demonstrated effectiveness. Including rigorous evaluations would broaden the evidence base to support and improve large-scale programmes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/tmi.13813\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000852794600001\n\nView details for PubMedID 36096154\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Household-level sanitation interventions have had limited effects on child health or environmental contamination, potentially due to low community coverage. Higher community-level coverage with safely managed sanitation can reduce opportunities for disease transmission.METHODS: We estimated associations between community sanitation coverage, environmental fecal contamination, and child health among 360 compounds in the control arm of the WASH Benefits trial in rural Bangladesh (NCT01590095). In each compound, we enumerated E. coli in environmental samples and recorded the 7-day prevalence of caregiver-reported diarrheal disease and acute respiratory infections (ARI) in children under five. We observed indicators of latrine access and quality among all neighboring compounds within 100m of study compounds. We defined community coverage as the proportion of neighboring compounds with (1) at least one latrine, and (2) exclusively hygienic latrines (improved facility observed to safely contain feces), within both 50m and 100m of study compounds. We assessed effect modification by population density and season.RESULTS: Adjusted for confounders, study compounds surrounded by 100% coverage of at least one latrine per compound within 50m had slightly lower log10E. coli counts in stored water (Deltalog=-0.13, 95% CI -0.26, -0.01), child hand rinses (Deltalog=-0.13, 95% CI -0.24, -0.02), and caregiver hand rinses (Deltalog=-0.16, 95% CI -0.29, -0.03) and marginally lower prevalence of diarrheal disease (prevalence ratio [PR]=0.82, 95% CI 0.64, 1.04) and ARI (PR=0.84, 95% CI 0.69, 1.03) compared to compounds surrounded by <100% coverage. Effects were similar but less pronounced at 100m. At higher population densities, community latrine coverage was associated with larger reductions in E. coli on child and caregiver hands and prevalence of diarrheal disease. Coverage with exclusively hygienic latrines was not associated with any outcome.CONCLUSION: Higher community sanitation coverage was associated with reduced fecal contamination and improved child health, with stronger effects at highly local scales (50m) and at high population densities. Our findings indicate that the relationship between community sanitation coverage, environmental contamination, and child health varies by definition of coverage, distance, and population density. This work highlights significant uncertainty around how to best measure sanitation coverage and the expected health effects of increasing sanitation coverage using a specific metric. Better understanding of community-level sanitation access is needed to inform policy for implementing sanitation systems that effectively protect community health.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ijheh.2022.114031\n\nView details for PubMedID 36058111\n\nAbstract\n\nMeta-analyses show that small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) reduce child wasting and stunting. There is little information regarding effects on severe wasting or stunting.We aimed to identify the effect of SQ-LNS on prevalence of severe wasting (weight-for-length z-score < -3) and severe stunting (length-for-age z-score < -3).We conducted a two-stage meta-analysis of individual participant data from 14 randomized controlled trials of SQ-LNS provided to children 6 to 24 mo of age. We generated study-specific and subgroup estimates of SQ-LNS vs. control and pooled the estimates using fixed-effects models. We used random effects meta-regression to examine study-level effect modifiers. In sensitivity analyses, we examined whether results differed depending on study arm inclusion criteria and types of comparisons.SQ-LNS provision led to a relative reduction of 31% in severe wasting (Prevalence Ratio, PR 0.69 (0.55, 0.86), n=34,373) and 17% in severe stunting (PR 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.90), n=36,795) at endline. Results were similar in most of the sensitivity analyses but somewhat attenuated when comparisons using passive control arms were excluded: PR 0.74 (0.57, 0.96), n=26,327 for severe wasting and PR 0.88 (0.81, 0.95), n=28,742 for severe stunting. Study-level characteristics generally did not significantly modify the effects of SQ-LNS, but results suggested greater effects of SQ-LNS in sites with greater burdens of wasting or stunting, or with poorer water quality or sanitation.Including SQ-LNS in preventive interventions to promote healthy child growth and development is likely to reduce rates of severe wasting and stunting.

Air pollution in many areas of South Asia is seasonal, with large spikes in particulate matter (PM) concentration occurring in the winter months. This study exploits this seasonal variation in PM concentration through a natural experiment.OBJECTIVE: This project aims to determine the causal effect of PM exposure during pregnancy on pregnancy and child health outcomes.METHODS: We will use an instrumental variable (IV) design whereby the estimated month of conception is our instrument for exposure to PM with a diameter less than 2.5 mum (PM2.5) during pregnancy. We will assess the plausibility of our assumption that timing of conception is exogenous with regard to our outcomes of interest and will adjust for date of monsoon onset to control for confounding variables related to harvest timing. Our outcomes are 1) birth weight, 2) pregnancy termination resulting in miscarriage, abortion, or still birth, 3) neonatal death, 4) infant death, and 5) child death. We will use data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in relevant regions of Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, along with monthly gridded data on PM2.5 concentration (0.1°*0.1° spatial resolution), precipitation data (0.5°*0.5° resolution), temperature data (0.5°*0.5°), and agricultural land use data (0.1°*0.1° resolution).RESULTS: Data access to relevant DHSs was granted on June 6, 2021 for India, Nepal, Bangladesh, August 24, 2021 for Pakistan, and June 19 2022 for the latest DHS from India.CONCLUSIONS: If the assumptions for a causal interpretation of our instrumental variable analysis are met, this analysis will provide important causal evidence on the maternal and child health effects of PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy. This evidence is important to inform personal behavior and interventions, such as the adoption of indoor air filtration during pregnancy as well as environmental and health policy.INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/35249.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2196/35249\n\nView details for PubMedID 35947440\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI) are leading causes of death in children. The WASH Benefits Bangladesh trial implemented a multicomponent sanitation intervention that led to a 39% reduction in the prevalence of diarrhea among children and a 25% reduction for ARI, measured 1 to 2 years after intervention implementation. We measured longer-term intervention effects on these outcomes between 1 to 3.5 years after intervention implementation, including periods with differing intensity of behavioral promotion.METHODS AND FINDINGS: WASH Benefits Bangladesh was a cluster-randomized controlled trial of water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition interventions (NCT01590095). The sanitation intervention included provision of or upgrades to improved latrines, sani-scoops for feces removal, children's potties, and in-person behavioral promotion. Promotion was intensive up to 2 years after intervention initiation, decreased in intensity between years 2 to 3, and stopped after 3 years. Access to and reported use of latrines was high in both arms, and latrine quality was significantly improved by the intervention, while use of child feces management tools was low. We enrolled a random subset of households from the sanitation and control arms into a longitudinal substudy, which measured child health with quarterly visits between 1 to 3.5 years after intervention implementation. The study period therefore included approximately 1 year of high-intensity promotion, 1 year of low-intensity promotion, and 6 months with no promotion. We assessed intervention effects on diarrhea and ARI prevalence among children <5 years through intention-to-treat analysis using generalized linear models with robust standard errors. Masking was not possible during data collection, but data analysis was masked. We enrolled 720 households (360 per arm) from the parent trial and made 9,800 child observations between June 2014 and December 2016. Over the entire study period, diarrheal prevalence was lower among children in the sanitation arm (11.9%) compared to the control arm (14.5%) (prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.81, 95% CI 0.66, 1.00, p = 0.05; prevalence difference [PD] = -0.027, 95% CI -0.053, 0, p = 0.05). ARI prevalence did not differ between sanitation (21.3%) and control (22.7%) arms (PR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.82, 1.05, p = 0.23; PD = -0.016, 95% CI -0.043, 0.010, p = 0.23). There were no significant differences in intervention effects between periods with high-intensity versus low-intensity/no promotion. Study limitations include use of caregiver-reported symptoms to define health outcomes and limited data collected after promotion ceased.CONCLUSIONS: The observed effect of the WASH Benefits Bangladesh sanitation intervention on diarrhea in children appeared to be sustained for at least 3.5 years after implementation, including 1.5 years after heavy promotion ceased. Existing latrine access was high in the study setting, suggesting that improving on-site latrine quality can deliver health benefits when latrine use practices are in place. Further work is needed to understand how latrine adoption can be achieved and sustained in settings with low existing access and how sanitation programs can adopt transformative approaches of excreta management, including safe disposal of child and animal feces, to generate a hygienic home environment.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT01590095; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01590095.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pmed.1004041\n\nView details for PubMedID 35939520\n\nAbstract\n\nPrecise enteric fever disease burden data are needed to inform prevention and control measures, including the use of newly available typhoid vaccines. We established the Surveillance for Enteric Fever in Asia Project (SEAP) to inform these strategies.From September, 2016, to September, 2019, we conducted prospective clinical surveillance for Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S Typhi) and Paratyphi (S Paratyphi) A, B, and C at health facilities in predetermined catchment areas in Dhaka, Bangladesh; Kathmandu and Kavrepalanchok, Nepal; and Karachi, Pakistan. Patients eligible for inclusion were outpatients with 3 or more consecutive days of fever in the last 7 days; inpatients with suspected or confirmed enteric fever; patients with blood culture-confirmed enteric fever from the hospital laboratories not captured by inpatient or outpatient enrolment and cases from the laboratory network; and patients with non-traumatic ileal perforation under surgical care. We used a hybrid surveillance model, pairing facility-based blood culture surveillance with community surveys of health-care use. Blood cultures were performed for enrolled patients. We calculated overall and age-specific typhoid and paratyphoid incidence estimates for each study site. Adjusted estimates accounted for the sensitivity of blood culture, the proportion of eligible individuals who consented and provided blood, the probability of care-seeking at a study facility, and the influence of wealth and education on care-seeking. We additionally calculated incidence of hospitalisation due to typhoid and paratyphoid.A total of 34 747 patients were enrolled across 23 facilitates (six tertiary hospitals, surgical wards of two additional hospitals, and 15 laboratory network sites) during the study period. Of the 34 303 blood cultures performed on enrolled patients, 8705 (26%) were positive for typhoidal Salmonella. Adjusted incidence rates of enteric fever considered patients in the six tertiary hospitals. Adjusted incidence of S Typhi, expressed per 100 000 person-years, was 913 (95% CI 765-1095) in Dhaka. In Nepal, the adjusted typhoid incidence rates were 330 (230-480) in Kathmandu and 268 (202-362) in Kavrepalanchok. In Pakistan, the adjusted incidence rates per hospital site were 176 (144-216) and 103 (85-126). The adjusted incidence rates of paratyphoid (of which all included cases were due to S Paratyphi A) were 128 (107-154) in Bangladesh, 46 (34-62) and 81 (56-118) in the Nepal sites, and 23 (19-29) and 1 (1-1) in the Pakistan sites. Adjusted incidence of hospitalisation was high across sites, and overall, 2804 (32%) of 8705 patients with blood culture-confirmed enteric fever were hospitalised.Across diverse communities in three south Asian countries, adjusted incidence exceeded the threshold for \"high burden\" of enteric fever (100 per 100 000 person-years). Incidence was highest among children, although age patterns differed across sites. The substantial disease burden identified highlights the need for control measures, including improvements to water and sanitation infrastructure and the implementation of typhoid vaccines.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S2214-109X(22)00119-X\n\nView details for PubMedID 35714648\n\nAbstract\n\nThe incidence of enteric fever, an invasive bacterial infection caused by typhoidal Salmonellae (Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi), is largely unknown in regions without blood culture surveillance. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether new diagnostic serological markers for typhoidal Salmonella can reliably estimate population-level incidence.We collected longitudinal blood samples from patients with blood culture-confirmed enteric fever enrolled from surveillance studies in Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Ghana between 2016 and 2021 and conducted cross-sectional serosurveys in the catchment areas of each surveillance site. We used ELISAs to measure quantitative IgA and IgG antibody responses to hemolysin E and S Typhi lipopolysaccharide. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to fit two-phase power-function decay models to the longitudinal antibody responses among enteric fever cases and used the joint distributions of the peak antibody titres and decay rate to estimate population-level incidence rates from cross-sectional serosurveys.The longitudinal antibody kinetics for all antigen-isotypes were similar across countries and did not vary by clinical severity. The seroincidence of typhoidal Salmonella infection among children younger than 5 years ranged between 58·5 per 100 person-years (95% CI 42·1-81·4) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to 6·6 per 100 person-years (4·3-9·9) in Kavrepalanchok, Nepal, and followed the same rank order as clinical incidence estimates.The approach described here has the potential to expand the geographical scope of typhoidal Salmonella surveillance and generate incidence estimates that are comparable across geographical regions and time.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.For the Nepali, Bengali and Urdu translations of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S2666-5247(22)00114-8\n\nView details for PubMedID 35750069\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: While the prevalence of undernutrition in children has decreased in many low- and middle-income countries since the 1990s, overweightand obesity have increased. Frequent consumption of sugar-sweetened food might have contributed to this change, although very little is known about sugar-sweetened food consumption in early life.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the association between individual, household and maternal factors, and the primary outcome, prevalence of sugar-sweetened food consumption in 6-24-month-old children in Bangladesh.METHODS: Multistage sampling was used to select households with children 6-24 months in rural Chatmohar, sub-district of Bangladesh (n=1635). Research assistants conducted a 24-hour qualitative dietary recall questionnaire with the enrolled child's primary caregiver to measure maternal and child dietary patterns. We examined factors associated with the prevalence of child sugar-sweetened food consumption with multivariate logistic regression models. We conducted tests of heterogeneity to explore differential associations between child sugar-sweetened food consumption prevalence and household income by maternal nutrition knowledge and wealth.RESULTS: Primary caregivers reported that 62% of toddlers had consumed sugar-sweetened food in the past 24 hours. Higher prevalence of child sugar-sweetened food consumption was associated both with a higher dietary diversity score (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.29) and with a higher prevalence of maternal sugar-sweetened food consumption (OR: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.97, 3.28). At higher levels of maternal nutrition knowledge and wealth, more household income was associated with lower prevalence of child sugar-sweetened food consumption.CONCLUSIONS: Almost two-thirds of 6-24-month-old children in rural Chatmohar, Bangladesh had consumed sugar-sweetened food in the last day. This is a high and concerning prevalence and the associated factors identified in this study should be investigated further to identify potential areas of intervention to decrease the prevalence of child sugar consumption in Bangladesh.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/jn/nxac119\n\nView details for PubMedID 35709397\n\nAbstract\n\nGirls' menstrual experiences impact their social and educational participation, physical and psychological health. We conducted a pilot study to assess the acceptability and feasibility of a multi-component intervention intended to support menstruating girls; improve menstrual care knowledge, practices, and comfort; and increase school attendance.We conducted a pre/post evaluation of a 6-month pilot intervention in four schools (2 urban, 2 rural) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We selected 527 schoolgirls (grades 5 to 10; aged 10 to 17years) for a baseline survey and 528 girls at endline. The intervention included: 1) Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) packs- reusable cloth pads, underwear, carry bags and menstrual cycle tracking calendars, 2) education curriculum- pictorial flipcharts, puberty related-booklets, and teachers' training to deliver puberty and MHM sessions, 3) maintenance- improvements to school sanitation, provision of disposable pads in the school office, provision of chute disposal systems for disposable pads, and gender committees to promote a gender-friendly school environment and maintenance of intervention facilities. We estimated intervention uptake and intervention effect by calculating prevalence differences and 95% confidence intervals using fixed-effects logistic regression.The intervention uptake was more than 85% for most indicators; 100% reported receiving puberty education, 85% received MHM packs, and 92% received booklets. Reusable cloth pads uptake was 34% by endline compared with 0% at baseline. Knowledge about menstrual physiology and knowledge of recommended menstrual management practices significantly improved from baseline to endline. Reported improvements included more frequent changing of menstrual materials (4.2 times/day at endline vs. 3.4 times/day at baseline), increased use of recommended disposal methods (prevalence difference (PD): 8%; 95% Confidence Interval: 1, 14), and fewer staining incidents (PD: -12%; 95% CI: -22, -1). More girls reported being satisfied with their menstrual materials (59% at endline vs. 46% at baseline, p<0.005) and thought school facilities were adequate for menstrual management at endline compared to baseline (54% vs. 8%, p<0.001). At endline, 64% girls disagreed/strongly disagreed that they felt anxious at school due to menstruation, compared to 33% at baseline (p<0.001). Sixty-five percent girls disagreed/strongly disagreed about feeling distracted or trouble concentrating in class at endline, compared to 41% at baseline (p<0.001). Self-reported absences decreased slightly (PD: -8%; 95% CI: -14, -2).Uptake of cloth pads, improved maintenance and disposal of menstrual materials, and reduced anxiety at school suggest acceptability and feasibility of the intervention aiming to create a supportive school environment.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s12889-022-13478-1\n\nView details for PubMedID 35655267\n\nAbstract\n\nWastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approach for COVID-19 surveillance is largely based on the assumption of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding into sewers by infected individuals. Recent studies found that SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater (CRNA) could not be accounted by the fecal shedding alone. This study aimed to determine potential major shedding sources based on literature data of CRNA, along with the COVID-19 prevalence in the catchment area through a systematic literature review. Theoretical CRNA under a certain prevalence was estimated using Monte Carlo simulations, with eight scenarios accommodating feces alone, and both feces and sputum as shedding sources. With feces alone, none of the WBE data was in the confidence interval of theoretical CRNA estimated with the mean feces shedding magnitude and probability, and 63% of CRNA in WBE reports were higher than the maximum theoretical concentration. With both sputum and feces, 91% of the WBE data were below the simulated maximum CRNA in wastewater. The inclusion of sputum as a major shedding source led to more comparable theoretical CRNA to the literature WBE data. Sputum discharging behavior of patients also resulted in great fluctuations of CRNA under a certain prevalence. Thus, sputum is a potential critical shedding source for COVID-19 WBE surveillance.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128667\n\nView details for PubMedID 35339834\n\nAbstract\n\nThe West African Ebola Virus Disease epidemic of 2014-16 cost more than 11,000 lives. Interventions targeting key behaviors to curb transmission, such as safe funeral practices and reporting and isolating the ill, were initially unsuccessful in a climate of fear, mistrust, and denial. Building trust was eventually recognized as essential to epidemic response and prioritized, and trust was seen to improve toward the end of the epidemic as incidence fell. However, little is understood about how and why trust changed during Ebola, what factors were most influential to community trust, and how different institutions might have been perceived under different levels of exposure to the outbreak. In this large-N household survey conducted in Liberia in 2018, we measured self-reported trust over time retrospectively in three different communities with different exposures to Ebola. We found trust was consistently higher for non-governmental organizations than for the government of Liberia across all time periods. Trust reportedly decreased significantly from the start to the peak of the epidemic in the study site of highest Ebola incidence. This finding, in combination with a negative association found between knowing someone infected and trust of both iNGOs and the government, indicates the experience of Ebola may have itself caused a decline of trust in the community. These results suggest that national governments should aim to establish trust when engaging communities to change behavior during epidemics. Further research on the relationship between trust and epidemics may serve to improve epidemic response efficacy and behavior uptake.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pntd.0010083\n\nView details for PubMedID 35085236\n\nAbstract\n\nSchoolchildren frequently transmit respiratory and gastrointestinal infections because of dense person-to-person contact in schools. We piloted a low-cost handwashing intervention among elementary schoolchildren in Bangladesh. We trained teachers to lead behavior change communication sessions using flipcharts to encourage students' handwashing before eating, after defecating, and after cleaning school toilets; provided handwashing stations (reservoirs with taps and stool + basin + soapy water solution [mix of 30 gm detergent with 1.5 L water] + pump top bottle with steel holder); and formed hygiene committees for maintenance and covering the recurrent cost of detergent. We evaluated intervention acceptability, feasibility, and potential for sustainability at 1 and 14 months after the intervention. At baseline, of 300 before eating events, no one washed hands with soap, and 99.7% (299) did not wash hands at all as soap was unavailable. Out of 269 after toileting events, 0.7% (2) washed hands with soap, and 88% (237) did not wash hands. After 4 weeks of the intervention, 45% (87/195 before eating events), 83% (155/186 after toileting events), and 100% (15/15 after cleaning toilet events) washed both hands with soapy water as children found it accessible, low cost, and child friendly. After 14 months, 9.4% (55/586 before eating events) and 37% (172/465 after toileting events) washed both hands with soapy water for health benefits. The intervention was acceptable and feasible; it overcame limited access to soap and water and was affordable as schools covered the recurrent costs of detergent. Further research should explore long-term habit adoption and impact on health and attendance.\n\nView details for DOI 10.4269/ajtmh.20-1335\n\nView details for PubMedID 34844216\n\nAbstract\n\nIn low- and middle-income countries, most latrines are not accessible to young children. We explored how to modify existing pit latrines to make them child friendly. We conducted four focus group discussions with mothers to explore barriers to child latrine use. We then enrolled 20 households with a child aged 3-7 years old to test six enabling technologies developed based on the identified barriers. Two to three weeks after installing the selected enabling technologies in each household, researchers conducted 19 in-depth interviews with caregivers to explore the technologies' acceptance and feasibility. Common barriers included the discomfort of squatting on a large pan, fear of darkness, and fear of a slippery floor. Of the potential solutions, a ring to stabilize the child while squatting in the latrine was preferred by children and was affordable and available. A wooden board with a smaller hole than the usual pan reduced fears of falling and helped eliminate discomfort but was inconvenient to handle and clean. A transparent fiberglass roof tile was affordable, available, increased visibility, and kept the latrine floor dry. In conclusion, the fiberglass roof tile and stability ring were two affordable and locally available technologies that facilitated latrine use by children aged 3-7 years.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/ijerph182111092\n\nView details for PubMedID 34769612\n\nAbstract\n\nPteropus bats are the natural reservoir for Nipah virus, and in Bangladesh, it is transmitted to people through consumption of raw or fermented date palm sap. Our objective was to understand seasonal patterns of bat feeding on date palm sap at a location where sap is collected year-round. Seven nights each month over three years, we mounted infrared cameras in four trees to observe bats' feeding behavior at date palm trees harvested for fermented sap production. We described the frequency of bat visits, duration of bat visits, and duration of bat-sap contact by month and by year. We captured 42,873 bat visits during 256 camera-nights of observation, of which 3% were Pteropus and 94% were non-Pteropus bats. Though the frequency of Pteropus bat visits to each tree/night was much lower than non-Pteropus bat visits, Pteropus bats stayed in contact with sap longer than non-Pteropus bats. Frequency of bat visits was higher during winter compared to other seasons, which may arise as a consequence of limited availability of food sources during this period or may be related to seasonal characteristics of the sap. Seasonal alignment of sap consumption by humans and bats may have consequences for viral spillover into humans.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s10393-021-01561-9\n\nView details for PubMedID 34609649\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Meta-analyses show that small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNSs) reduce child stunting and wasting. Identification of subgroups who benefit most from SQ-LNSs may facilitate program design.OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify study-level and individual-level modifiers of the effect of SQ-LNSs on child growth outcomes.METHODS: We conducted a 2-stage meta-analysis of individual participant data from 14 randomized controlled trials of SQ-LNSs provided to children 6-24 mo of age (n=37,066). We generated study-specific and subgroup estimates of SQ-LNS compared with control and pooled the estimates using fixed-effects models. We used random-effects meta-regression to examine study-level effect modifiers. In sensitivity analyses, we examined whether results differed depending on study arm inclusion criteria and types of comparisons.RESULTS: SQ-LNS provision decreased stunting (length-for-age z score < -2) by 12% (relative reduction), wasting [weight-for-length (WLZ) z score < -2] by 14%, low midupper arm circumference (MUAC) (<125mm or MUAC-for-age z score < -2) by 18%, acute malnutrition (WLZ < -2 or MUAC < 125mm) by 14%, underweight (weight-for-age z score < -2) by 13%, and small head size (head circumference-for-age z score < -2) by 9%. Effects of SQ-LNSs generally did not differ by study-level characteristics including region, stunting burden, malaria prevalence, sanitation, water quality, duration of supplementation, frequency of contact, or average compliance with SQ-LNS. Effects of SQ-LNSs on stunting, wasting, low MUAC, and small head size were greater among girls than among boys; effects on stunting, underweight, and low MUAC were greater among later-born (than among firstborn) children; and effects on wasting and acute malnutrition were greater among children in households with improved (as opposed to unimproved) sanitation.CONCLUSIONS: The positive impact of SQ-LNSs on growth is apparent across a variety of study-level contexts. Policy-makers and program planners should consider including SQ-LNSs in packages of interventions to prevent both stunting and wasting.This trial was registered at www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO as CRD42019146592.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/ajcn/nqab278\n\nView details for PubMedID 34590672\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Small-quantity (SQ) lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNSs) provide many nutrients needed for brain development.OBJECTIVES: We aimed to generate pooled estimates of the effect of SQ-LNSs on developmental outcomes (language, social-emotional, motor, and executive function), and to identify study-level and individual-level modifiers of these effects.METHODS: We conducted a 2-stage meta-analysis of individual participant data from 14 intervention against control group comparisons in 13 randomized trials of SQ-LNSs provided to children age 6-24 mo (total n=30,024).RESULTS: In 11-13 intervention against control group comparisons (n=23,588-24,561), SQ-LNSs increased mean language (mean difference: 0.07 SD; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.10 SD), social-emotional (0.08; 0.05, 0.11 SD), and motor scores (0.08; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.11 SD) and reduced the prevalence of children in the lowest decile of these scores by 16% (prevalence ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.92), 19% (0.81; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.89), and 16% (0.84; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.92), respectively. SQ-LNSs also increased the prevalence of children walking without support at 12 mo by 9% (1.09; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.14). Effects of SQ-LNSs on language, social-emotional, and motor outcomes were larger among study populations with a higher stunting burden (≥35%) (mean difference: 0.11-0.13 SD; 8-9 comparisons). At the individual level, greater effects of SQ-LNSs were found on language among children who were acutely malnourished (mean difference: 0.31) at baseline; on language (0.12), motor (0.11), and executive function (0.06) among children in households with lower socioeconomic status; and on motor development among later-born children (0.11), children of older mothers (0.10), and children of mothers with lower education (0.11).CONCLUSIONS: Child SQ-LNSs can be expected to result in modest developmental gains, which would be analogous to 1-1.5 IQ points on an IQ test, particularly in populations with a high child stunting burden. Certain groups of children who experience higher-risk environments have greater potential to benefit from SQ-LNSs in developmental outcomes.This trial was registered at www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO as CRD42020159971.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/ajcn/nqab277\n\nView details for PubMedID 34590116\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Previously, we demonstrated that a water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutritional intervention improved linear growth and was unexpectedly associated with shortened childhood telomere length (TL) (Lin et al., 2017). Here, we assessed the association between TL and growth.Methods: We measured relative TL in whole blood from 713 children. We reported differences between the 10th percentile and 90th percentile of TL or change in TL distribution using generalized additive models, adjusted for potential confounders.Results: In cross-sectional analyses, long TL was associated with a higher length-for-age Z score at age 1 year (0.23 SD adjusted difference in length-for-age Z score (95% CI 0.05, 0.42; FDR-corrected p-value = 0.01)). TL was not associated with other outcomes.Conclusions: Consistent with the metabolic telomere attrition hypothesis, our previous trial findings support an adaptive role for telomere attrition, whereby active TL regulation is employed as a strategy to address 'emergency states' with increased energy requirements such as rapid growth during the first year of life. Although short periods of active telomere attrition may be essential to promote growth, this study suggests that a longer overall initial TL setting in the first two years of life could signal increased resilience against future telomere erosion events and healthy growth trajectories.Funding: Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.7554/eLife.60389\n\nView details for PubMedID 34494545\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Global annual reports of visceral leishmaniasis or kala-azar (\"black fever\") reduced from 200,000 cases in 2012 to 23,804 in 2015. India, Bangladesh and Nepal reported 80% of the global cases in 2012, but 39% in 2015. We sought to identify major amenable barriers to early diagnosis of kala-azar in peripheral areas of Mymensingh district, an area of Bangladesh that was highly endemic for kala-azar.METHODS: We conducted sequential exploratory mixed methods research. Qualitative data were first derived from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions among 29 patients diagnosed with kala-azar, their families, and neighbours. Preliminary results from qualitative analysis were used to design a structured questionnaire, which was administered to collect data on the processes leading to the diagnosis of kala-azar from 102 patients. Qualitative and quantitative data were integrated consistent with the chronology for kala-azar patients seeking care. The study was conducted from September 2011 to May 2012 in Fulbaria and Gaffargaon sub-districts of Mymensingh.RESULTS: The median delay from fever onset to confirmatory diagnosis of kala-azar was 60 days, with 38% of the cases diagnosed within 30 days. Public health facilities and Gaffargaon sub-district achieved high proportions of early diagnosis. Individual barriers to early diagnosis were low awareness of symptoms and treatment facilities, poverty, and traditional beliefs. Other factors were the remoteness of health care centres, wet season transport difficulty, mis-diagnosis as typhoid, limited availability of rK-39 testing at the community level, and the inclusion of splenomegaly in the case definition.CONCLUSIONS: Targeted community awareness campaigns appropriate for underprivileged communities will increase care seeking and consequently diagnosis. Improved diagnostic guidelines and a strong referral chain for kala-azar will accelerate diagnosis. These steps will contribute significantly to the National Kala-azar Elimination Program of Bangladesh, especially during the post-elimination era.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.parint.2021.102421\n\nView details for PubMedID 34280530\n\nAbstract\n\nWastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising approach for estimating population-wide COVID-19 prevalence through detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in wastewater. However, various methodological challenges associated with WBE would affect the accuracy of prevalence estimation. To date, the overall uncertainty of WBE and the impact of each step on the prevalence estimation are largely unknown. This study divided the WBE approach into five steps (i.e., virus shedding; in-sewer transportation; sampling and storage; analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater; back-estimation) and further summarized and quantified the uncertainties associated with each step through a systematic review. Although the shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA varied greatly between COVID-19 positive patients, with more than 10 infected persons in the catchment area, the uncertainty caused by the excretion rate became limited for the prevalence estimation. Using a high-frequency flow-proportional sampling and estimating the prevalence through actual water usage data significantly reduced the overall uncertainties to around 20-40% (relative standard deviation, RSD). And under such a scenario, the analytical uncertainty of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was the dominant factor. This highlights the importance of using surrogate viruses as internal or external standards during the wastewater analysis, and the need for further improvement on analytical approaches to minimize the analytical uncertainty. This study supports the application of WBE as a complementary surveillance strategy for monitoring COVID-19 prevalence and provides methodological improvements and suggestions to enhance the reliability for future studies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cej.2021.129039\n\nView details for PubMedID 33642938\n\nAbstract\n\nThe illness cost borne by households, known as out-of-pocket expenditure, was 74% of the total health expenditure in Bangladesh in 2017. Calculating economic burden of diarrhea of low-income urban community is important to identify potential cost savings strategies and prioritize policy decision to improve the quality of life of this population. This study aimed to estimate cost of illness and monthly percent expenditure borne by households due diarrhea in a low-income urban settlement of Dhaka, Bangladesh. We conducted this study in East Arichpur area of Tongi township in Dhaka, Bangladesh from September 17, 2015 to July 26, 2016. We used the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of three or more loose stool in 24 hours to enroll patients and enrolled 106 severe patients and 158 non-severe patients from Tongi General Hospital, local pharmacy and study community. The team enrolled patients between the first to third day of the illness (≤ 72 hours) and continued daily follow-up by phone until recovery. We considered direct and indirect costs to calculate cost-per-episode. We applied the published incidence rate to estimate the annual cost of diarrhea. The estimated average cost of illness for patient with severe diarrhea was US$ 27.39 [95% CI: 24.55, 30.23] (2,147 BDT), 17% of the average monthly income of the households. The average cost of illness for patient with non-severe diarrhea was US$ 6.36 [95% CI: 5.19, 7.55] (499 BDT), 4% of the average monthly income of households. A single diarrheal episode substantially affects financial condition of low-income urban community residents: a severe episode can cost almost equivalent to 4.35 days (17%) and a non-severe episode can cost almost equivalent to 1 day (4%) of household's income. Preventing diarrhea preserves health and supports financial livelihoods.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009439\n\nView details for PubMedID 34115764\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: The intense interactions between people, animals and environmental systems in urban informal settlements compromise human and environmental health. Inadequate water and sanitation services, compounded by exposure to flooding and climate change risks, expose inhabitants to environmental contamination causing poor health and wellbeing and degrading ecosystems. However, the exact nature and full scope of risks and exposure pathways between human health and the environment in informal settlements are uncertain. Existing models are limited to microbiological linkages related to faecal-oral exposures at the individual level, and do not account for a broader range of human-environmental variables and interactions that affect population health and wellbeing.METHODS: We undertook a 12-month health and environmental assessment in 12 flood-prone informal settlements in Makassar, Indonesia. We obtained caregiver-reported health data, anthropometric measurements, stool and blood samples from children<5years, and health and wellbeing data for children 5-14years and adult respondents. We collected environmental data including temperature, mosquito and rat species abundance, and water and sediment samples. Demographic, built environment and household asset data were also collected. We combined our data with existing literature to generate a novel planetary health model of health and environment in informal settlements.RESULTS: Across the 12 settlements, 593 households and 2764 participants were enrolled. Two-thirds (64·1%) of all houses (26·3-82·7% per settlement) had formal land tenure documentation. Cough, fever and diarrhoea in the week prior to the survey were reported among an average of 34.3%, 26.9% and 9.7% of children aged<5years, respectively; although proportions varied over time, prevalence among these youngest children was consistently higher than among children 5-14years or adult respondents. Among children<5years, 44·3% experienced stunting, 41·1% underweight, 12.4% wasting, and 26.5% were anaemic. There was self- or carer-reported poor mental health among 16.6% of children aged 5-14years and 13.9% of adult respondents. Rates of potential risky exposures from swimming in waterways, eating uncooked produce, and eating soil or dirt were high, as were exposures to flooding and livestock. Just over one third of households (35.3%) had access to municipal water, and contamination of well water with E. coli and nitrogen species was common. Most (79·5%) houses had an in-house toilet, but no houses were connected to a piped sewer network or safe, properly constructed septic tank. Median monthly settlement outdoor temperatures ranged from 26·2°C to 29.3°C, and were on average, 1·1°C warmer inside houses than outside. Mosquito density varied over time, with Culex quinquefasciatus accounting for 94·7% of species. Framed by a planetary health lens, our model includes four thematic domains: (1) the physical/built environment; (2) the ecological environment; (3) human health; and (4) socio-economic wellbeing, and is structured at individual, household, settlement, and city/beyond spatial scales.CONCLUSIONS: Our planetary health model includes key risk factors and faecal-oral exposure pathways but extends beyond conventional microbiological faecal-oral enteropathogen exposure pathways to comprehensively account for a wider range of variables affecting health in urban informal settlements. It includes broader ecological interconnections and planetary health-related variables at the household, settlement and city levels. It proposes a composite framework of markers to assess water and sanitation challenges and flood risks in urban informal settlements for optimal design and monitoring of interventions.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.envint.2021.106679\n\nView details for PubMedID 34126296\n\nAbstract\n\nWastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been regarded as a potential tool for the prevalence estimation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the community. However, the application of the conventional back-estimation approach is currently limited due to the methodological challenges and various uncertainties. This study systematically performed meta-analysis for WBE datasets and investigated the use of data-driven models for the COVID-19 community prevalence in lieu of the conventional WBE back-estimation approach. Three different data-driven models, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were applied to the multi-national WBE dataset. To evaluate the robustness of these models, predictions for sixteen scenarios with partial inputs were compared against the actual prevalence reports from clinical testing. The performance of models was further validated using unseen data (data sets not included for establishing the model) from different stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Generally, ANN and ANFIS models showed better accuracy and robustness over MLR models. Air and wastewater temperature played a critical role in the prevalence estimation by data-driven models, especially MLR models. With unseen datasets, ANN model reasonably estimated the prevalence of COVID-19 (cumulative cases) at the initial phase and forecasted the upcoming new cases in 2-4 days at the post-peak phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study provided essential information about the feasibility and accuracy of data-driven estimation of COVID-19 prevalence through the WBE approach.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147947\n\nView details for PubMedID 34051491\n\nAbstract\n\nLead exposure is harmful at any time in life, but pre-natal and early childhood exposures are particularly detrimental to cognitive development. In Bangladesh, multiple household-level lead exposures pose risks, including turmeric adulterated with lead chromate and food storage in lead-soldered cans. We developed and evaluated an intervention to reduce lead exposure among children and their caregivers in rural Bangladesh. We conducted formative research to inform theory-based behavioral recommendations. Lead exposure was one of several topics covered in the multi-component intervention focused on early child development. Community health workers (CHWs) delivered the lead component of the intervention during group sessions with pregnant women and mother-child dyads (<15 months old) in a cluster-randomized trial. We administered household surveys at baseline (control n=301; intervention n=320) and 9 months later at endline (control n=279; intervention n=239) and calculated adjusted risk and mean differences for primary outcomes. We conducted two qualitative assessments, one after 3 months and a second after 9 months, to examine the feasibility and benefits of the intervention. At endline, the prevalence of lead awareness was 52 percentage points higher in the intervention arm compared to the control (adjusted risk difference: 0.52 [95% CI 0.46 to 0.61]). Safe turmeric consumption and food storage practices were more common in the intervention versus control arm at endline, with adjusted risk differences of 0.22 [0.10 to 0.32] and 0.13 [0.00 to 0.19], respectively. Semi-structured interviews conducted with a subset of participants after the intervention revealed that the perceived benefit of reducing lead exposure was high because of the long-term negative impacts that lead can have on child cognitive development. The study demonstrates that a group-based CHW-led intervention can effectively raise awareness about and motivate lead exposure prevention behaviors in rural Bangladesh. Future efforts should combine similar awareness-raising efforts with longer-term regulatory and structural changes to systematically and sustainably reduce lead exposure.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.envres.2021.111292\n\nView details for PubMedID 33971132\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Nitrate is a widespread groundwater contaminant and a leading cause of drinking water quality violations in California. Associations between nitrate exposure and select adverse birth outcomes have been suggested, but few studies have examined gestational exposures to nitrate and risk of preterm birth (before 37 wk gestation).OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between elevated nitrate in drinking water and spontaneous preterm birth through a within-mother retrospective cohort study of births in California.METHODS: We acquired over 6 million birth certificate records linked with Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development hospital discharge data for California births from 2000-2011. We used public water system monitoring records to estimate nitrate concentrations in drinking water for each woman's residence during gestation. After exclusions, we constructed a sample of 1,443,318 consecutive sibling births in order to conduct a within-mother analysis. We used separate conditional logistic regression models to estimate the odds of preterm birth at 20-31 and 32-36 wk, respectively, among women whose nitrate exposure changed between consecutive pregnancies.RESULTS: Spontaneous preterm birth at 20-31 wk was increased in association with tap water nitrate concentrations during pregnancy of 5 to <10mg/L [odds ratio (OR)=1.47; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.29, 1.67] and ≥10mg/L (OR=2.52; 95% CI: 1.49, 4.26) compared with <5mg/L (as nitrogen). Corresponding estimates for spontaneous preterm birth at 32-36 wk were positive but close to the null for 5 to <10mg/L nitrate (OR=1.08; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.15) and for ≥10mg/L nitrate (OR=1.05; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.31) vs. <5mg/L nitrate. Our findings were similar in several secondary and sensitivity analyses, including in a conventional individual-level design.DISCUSSION: The results suggest that nitrate in drinking water is associated with increased odds of spontaneous preterm birth. Notably, we estimated modestly increased odds associated with tap water nitrate concentrations of 5 to <10mg/L (below the federal drinking water standard of 10mg/L) relative to <5mg/L. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8205.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1289/EHP8205\n\nView details for PubMedID 33949893\n\nAbstract\n\nCommunity health workers (CHWs) are key to implementing community-based health interventions and quality can be enhanced by better understanding their lived experiences. The WASH Benefits, Bangladesh trial engaged 540 female CHWs to promote varying health intervention packages. We report on factors influencing their lived experiences during the trial, to aid future recruitment, training and retention of CHWs. Nine focus groups and 18 in-depth interviews were conducted with CHWs. Focus groups and interviews were transcribed and thematic content analysis performed to summarize the results. All CHWs described experiencing positive working conditions and many benefits both socially and financially; these contributed to their retention and job satisfaction. Their honorarium was commonly applied towards their children's education and invested for income generation. CHWs gained self-confidence as women, to move unaccompanied in the community and speak in public. They earned respect from the community and their family members who helped them manage their family obligations during work and were viewed as a resource for advice on health and social issues. Many participated in family decision-making from which they were previously excluded. Health programs should foster a positive experience among their CHWs to aid the recruitment, retention and development of this important human resource.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/ijerph18073389\n\nView details for PubMedID 33805884\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: In low- and middle-income countries, children experience multiple risks for delayed development. We evaluated a multicomponent, group-based early child development intervention including behavioural recommendations on responsive stimulation, nutrition, water, sanitation, hygiene, mental health and lead exposure prevention.METHODS: We conducted a 9-month, parallel, multiarm, cluster-randomised controlled trial in 31 rural villages in Kishoreganj District, Bangladesh. Villages were randomly allocated to: group sessions ('group'); alternating groups and home visits ('combined'); or a passive control arm. Sessions were delivered fortnightly by trained community members. The primary outcome was child stimulation (Family Care Indicators); the secondary outcome was child development (Ages and Stages Questionnaire Inventory, ASQi). Other outcomes included dietary diversity, latrine status, use of a child potty, handwashing infrastructure, caregiver mental health and knowledge of lead. Analyses were intention to treat. Data collectors were independent from implementers.RESULTS: In July-August 2017, 621 pregnant women and primary caregivers of children<15 months were enrolled (group n=160, combined n=160, control n=301). At endline, immediately following intervention completion (July-August 2018), 574 participants were assessed (group n=144, combined n=149, control n=281). Primary caregivers in both intervention arms participated in more play activities than control caregivers (age-adjusted means: group 4.22, 95% CI 3.97 to 4.47; combined 4.77, 4.60 to 4.96; control 3.24, 3.05 to 3.39), and provided a larger variety of play materials (age-adjusted means: group 3.63, 3.31 to 3.96; combined 3.81, 3.62 to 3.99; control 2.48, 2.34 to 2.59). Compared with the control arm, children in the group arm had higher total ASQi scores (adjusted mean difference in standardised scores: 0.39, 0.15 to 0.64), while in the combined arm scores were not significantly different from the control (0.25, -0.07 to 0.54).CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that group-based, multicomponent interventions can be effective at improving child development outcomes in rural Bangladesh, and that they have the potential to be delivered at scale.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The trial is registered in ISRCTN (ISRCTN16001234).\n\nView details for DOI 10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004307\n\nView details for PubMedID 33727278\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: In December 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified the first typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) (Typbar-TCV). While no safety concerns were identified in pre- and post-licensure studies, WHO's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety recommended robust safety evaluation with large-scale TCV introductions. During July-August 2018, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) launched the world's first public sector TCV introduction. Per administrative reports, 113,420 children 9 months-14 years old received TCV.METHODS: We evaluated adverse events following immunization (AEFI) using passive and active surveillance via 1) reports from the passive NMMC AEFI surveillance system, 2) telephone interviews with 5% of caregivers of vaccine recipients 48 hours and 7 days post-vaccination, and 3) chart abstraction for adverse events of special interest (AESI) among patients admitted to 5 hospitals using the Brighton Collaboration criteria followed by ascertainment of vaccination status.RESULTS: We identified 222/113,420 (0.2%) AEFI through the NMMC AEFI surveillance system: 211 (0.19%) minor, 2 (0.002%) severe, and 9 (0.008%) serious. At 48 hours post-vaccination, 1,852/5,605 (33%) caregivers reported one or more AEFI, including injection site pain (n=1,452, 26%), swelling (n=419, 7.5%), and fever (n=416, 7.4%). Of the 4,728 interviews completed at 7 days post-vaccination, the most reported AEFI included fever (n=200, 4%), pain (n=52, 1%), and headache (n=42, 1%). Among 525 hospitalized children diagnosed with an AESI, 60 were vaccinated; no AESI were causally associated with TCV.CONCLUSIONS: No unexpected safety signals were ident"
