        "text": "RENO, Nev. - Nevada's Sean Dollars was named to the Doak Walker Award Preseason Watch List, The PwC SMU Athletic Forum announced Tuesday. The Forum annually presents the award to the nation's most outstanding college running back.\n\nDollars is the second Nevada player to be named to a 2024 preseason watch list, joining fellow running back Patrick Garwo III, who was named to the lists for the Allstate Wuerffel Trophy and the Allstate AFCA Good Works Team.\n\nDollars returns to Nevada for his sixth and final season this fall. Last year, in his debut season for the Wolf Pack, Dollars led the team in rushing (527 yards), carries (151), and rushing touchdowns (six) while starting 10 of the 11 games in which he appeared. Sharing the load with quarterback Brendon Lewis and fellow running back Ashton Hayes, Dollars had a season-high 82 yards on the ground Nov. 11 at Utah State, and had one two-score game (Nov. 4 against Hawai'i). Dollars was also a threat coming out of the backfield, catching 18 passes for 77 yards.\n\nNevada will Launch the Jeff Choate Era Saturday, Aug. 24, when it hosts new ACC member SMU at 5 p.m. at Mackay Stadium. Choate spent the past three seasons (2021-23) as co-defensive coordinator and inside linebackers coach at Texas, helping lead the Longhorns to a Big XII title and College Football Playoff appearance in 2023. Prior to his time in Austin, Choate served as head coach at Montana State from 2016-20, leading the Bobcats to a pair of FCS playoff berths, including a run to the semifinals in 2019.\n\nNevada Football's \"Drive For 25,\" a message to Wolf Pack fans to get Mackay Stadium to at least 25,000 attendees for the Aug. 24 opener against SMU, continues its push as season ticket prices for 2024 begin for as low as $99 for adults and $60 for children 12 and under. Family 4-PACK's are also available and include four General Admission season tickets and complimentary parking for only $400â€”a total savings of $200. Three-game mini-plans and single-game tickets for the Wolf Pack's seven-game home slate are also available by visiting MyNevadaTickets.com or by calling (775) 348-PACK.\n\nThe PwC SMU Athletic Forum Board of Directors will name ten semifinalists in November, and three finalists, as voted on by the Doak Walker Award National Selection Committee, will also be announced in November. The committee will cast a second vote in December to determine the recipient.\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#26 Ashton Hayes\n\nRB\n\n6' 0\"\n\nRedshirt Sophomore\n\n#4 Sean Dollars\n\nRB\n\n5' 9\"\n\nRedshirt Senior\n\n#2 Brendon Lewis\n\nQB\n\n6' 2\"\n\nRedshirt Junior\n\nPatrick Garwo III\n\nRB\n\n5' 9\"\n\nSixth Year"
