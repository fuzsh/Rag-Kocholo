        "text": "There are more than 150 different types of headaches. Some of the types include migraine, tension-type, cluster, sinus, and hypnic headaches.\n\nWhile headaches can sometimes be painful and debilitating, a person can treat most of them with simple pain medications. However, repeated attacks or certain types of headaches could indicate an underlying health condition.\n\nHeadaches are often divided into two main categories: primary and secondary.\n\nA primary headache is not due to another condition. In contrast, a secondary headache has a separate underlying cause, such as a head injury or sudden caffeine withdrawal.\n\nThis article explores eleven of the most common types of headaches, along with their causes, treatment, prevention, and when to speak with a doctor.\n\nHeadaches are a common issue. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that headache disorders affect around 40% of the global population. Headaches are among the top three most common neurological conditions among all age groups.\n\nA headache with migraine often involves intense throbbing pain on one side of the head.\n\nA person may experience a heightened sensitivity to light, sound, and smell. Nausea and vomiting are also common.\n\nAround 25% of people with migraine experience an aura before or during the headache. These are visual and sensory disturbances that typically last 5–60 minutes and include:\n\nseeing zig-zagging lines, flickering lights, or spots\n\npartial loss of vision\n\nnumbness\n\ntingling\n\nmuscle weakness\n\ndifficulty speaking or finding words\n\nBe aware that aura symptoms could also indicate stroke or meningitis. Anyone experiencing these for the first time should seek immediate medical attention.\n\nMigraine headaches tend to be recurrent, and each episode can last from a few hours to several days. For many, it is a lifelong condition.\n\nHealth experts do not fully understand the exact causes of migraine. However, it often runs in families and is more common in people with certain preexisting conditions, such as depression and epilepsy.\n\nTriggers of migraine could include:\n\nstress\n\nanxiety\n\nsleep disruption\n\nhormonal changes\n\nskipping meals\n\ndehydration\n\nsome foods and medications\n\nbright lights and loud noise\n\nTreatment\n\nTreatment will depend on various factors, including how severe the symptoms are, how often they occur, and whether the person experiences nausea and vomiting.\n\nTreatment options include:\n\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as:\n\nibuprofen\n\nnaproxen\n\naspirin\n\nacetaminophen\n\ntriptans, such as sumatriptan, which require a prescription\n\nantiemetics, such as metoclopramide, to manage nausea and vomiting\n\nNeurostimulation techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), may also help.\n\nA person can also ease migraine episodes by:\n\nresting in a dark, quiet place\n\nplacing an ice pack or a cold cloth on the forehead\n\ndrinking water\n\nPeople with chronic migraine should speak with a healthcare professional about preventive treatment. They may diagnose chronic migraine if a person has an episode on more than 15 days per month or if symptoms occur on at least 8 days a month for 3 months.\n\nDrug options for migraine prevention include:\n\ntopiramate (Topamax)\n\npropranolol\n\namitriptyline\n\nOther management choices to consider are dietary changes, stress management, and acupuncture.\n\nLearn more about managing migraine at home.\n\nTension-type headaches affect most people at some time. They are the most common type of primary headaches. Research states that around 78% of adults will experience a tension-type headache at some point.\n\nThey present as a dull, constant pain on both sides of the head. Other symptoms can include:\n\ntenderness of the face, head, neck, and shoulders\n\na feeling of pressure behind the eyes\n\nsensitivity to light and sound\n\nThese headaches can last from 30 minutes up to several days.\n\nThe exact causes of tension headaches are unclear. However, stress, anxiety, and depression are common triggers. Other potential triggers include:\n\ndehydration\n\nloud noise\n\nlack of exercise\n\ninsufficient quality sleep\n\nposture\n\nskipped meals\n\neyestrain\n\nTreatment\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) painkillers, such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and aspirin, are usually very effective in stopping or reducing pain. Individuals experiencing headaches for more than 15 days per month should consult a healthcare professional, as this may indicate chronic headaches.\n\nLifestyle changes and some treatments may help prevent tension headaches. These can include:\n\ngetting enough sleep\n\nregular exercise and stretching\n\nimproving sitting and standing posture\n\nhaving an eye test\n\nmanagement of stress, anxiety, or depression\n\nacupuncture\n\nLearn more about tension-type headaches.\n\nA note about sex and gender\n\nSex and gender exist on spectrums. This article will use the terms “male,” “female,” or both to refer to sex assigned at birth. Click here to learn more.\n\nCluster headaches are severe and recurrent headaches. They are relatively uncommon affecting 1 in 1000 adults, and are six times more likely to affect males than females.\n\nPeople with cluster headaches describe an intense burning or piercing pain behind or around one eye.\n\nOther symptoms can include:\n\nwatering eyes\n\nswollen eyelid\n\na blocked or a runny nose\n\nsensitivity to light and sound\n\nrestlessness or agitation\n\nCluster headaches usually come on suddenly and without warning and last between 15 minutes and 3 hours. People can experience up to eight attacks a day.\n\nThese attacks tend to occur in daily clusters and can persist for weeks or months. They also tend to start at consistent times, often a couple of hours after falling asleep at night.\n\nAny person experiencing these symptoms, which can sometimes resemble hay fever, should consult their healthcare professional.\n\nThe cause of cluster headaches is unclear, but they are more likely to occur in people who smoke. People should also avoid alcohol during attack periods.\n\nTreatment\n\nTreatment aims to reduce the severity and frequency of the attacks. Options include:\n\noxygen therapy\n\nsumatriptan\n\nverapamil\n\nsteroids\n\nmelatonin\n\nlithium\n\nDeep-brain stimulation and vagus nerve stimulation also show promise in treating cluster headaches that do not respond to medication.\n\nLearn more about cluster headaches.\n\nExertional headaches are due to strenuous physical exercise, with the following triggers:\n\nrunning\n\njumping\n\nweightlifting\n\nsexual intercourse\n\nbouts of coughing or sneezing\n\nThese headaches are usually very short-lived but can sometimes last up to 2 days. They present as throbbing pain throughout the head and are more common in those with a family history of migraine.\n\nIndividuals experiencing exertional headaches for the first time should speak with a healthcare professional as they could be a sign of something more serious.\n\nTreatment\n\nTreatment for exertional headaches includes using:\n\nOTC pain relief\n\nbeta-blockers, such as propranolol\n\nindomethacin\n\nSometimes, exertional headaches may result from cardiovascular issues. If so, a healthcare professional may recommend tests to check a person’s cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health.\n\nLearn more about exertional headaches.\n\nA hypnic headache is a rare condition that usually begins when people are in their 50s. However, it can start sooner. People also refer to them as “alarm clock” headaches, and they wake individuals during the night.\n\nA hypnic headache consists of mild-to-moderate throbbing pain, usually on both sides of the head. It can last up to 3 hours, while other symptoms may include nausea and sensitivity to light and sound.\n\nPeople can experience several attacks each week. The cause of hypnic headaches is not clear, and there are no known triggers.\n\nAlthough hypnic headaches are generally harmless, an older adult who experiences any unusual headaches for the first time should seek medical advice. A healthcare professional may wish to rule out migraine and cluster headaches.\n\nTreatment\n\nTreatment options for hypnic headaches include:\n\ncaffeine\n\nindomethacin\n\nlithium\n\nLearn more about hypnic headaches.\n\nA medication-overuse headache (MOH) — sometimes known as a rebound headache — is a common type of secondary headache. They occur in around 1-2% of the general population. MOH headaches generally occur in people who have migraine or tension-type headaches.\n\nMOH headaches typically happen first thing in the morning when a person wakes up. The location and pain vary from person to person. They may also experience nausea, irritability, and difficulty concentrating.\n\nThese headaches are the result of regularly taking medication for headache disorders. However, a person may take them more often, or take more of them, because their pain is not responding.\n\nA doctor may diagnose MOH if a person has a headache disorder and has also taken pain relief medication at least 15 days in a month.\n\nDrugs that can cause MOH when they wear off include:\n\nopioids\n\nacetaminophen\n\ntriptans, such as sumatriptan\n\nNSAIDs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen\n\nTreatment\n\nThe only treatment for MOH is to stop taking the medication causing the headaches. However, anyone stopping medication should only do so under the supervision of a healthcare professional. They can help devise a plan and may prescribe alternative medications to ease the withdrawal process.\n\nAfter stopping the drug, a person is likely to experience:\n\nworsened headaches\n\nnausea and vomiting\n\nincreased heart rate\n\nlow blood pressure\n\nsleep disturbance\n\nrestlessness, anxiety, and nervousness\n\nA healthcare professional may prescribe medication, such as antiemetics, to help relieve these symptoms to manage nausea and vomiting. The symptoms usually last for 2–10 days but can persist for up to 4 weeks.\n\nA healthcare professional will advise on suitable pain relief medication to use after resolving an MOH.\n\nThe following steps can help prevent MOH:\n\navoiding the use of codeine and opioids\n\nlimiting the use of pain relief medication for headaches\n\nusing preventive medications for a chronic migraine\n\nLearn more about rebound headaches.\n\nSinus headaches occur with sinusitis — an inflammation of the sinuses. It usually results from an infection or an allergy.\n\nThe symptoms consist of a dull, throbbing ache around the eyes, cheeks, and forehead. The pain may worsen with movement or straining and can sometimes spread to the teeth and jaw.\n\nOther possible symptoms include:\n\nfacial pressure or pain\n\nreduced sense of smell\n\nnasal discharge\n\na blocked nose\n\nfever\n\nfatigue\n\near pain\n\nbad breath\n\ncough\n\ndental pain\n\na general feeling of being unwell\n\nSinus headaches are quite rare. If there are no nasal symptoms, a headache of this nature is more likely to be a migraine episode.\n\nTreatment\n\nSinusitis usually clears on its own in around 4 weeks.\n\nTreatment options include:\n\nrest\n\ndrinking fluids\n\nOTC pain relief\n\nnasal decongestants\n\nsalt water nasal sprays or solutions from the pharmacy\n\nantihistamines\n\nsteroid nasal sprays, available by prescription\n\nantibiotics, if there is a bacterial infection\n\nPeople should speak with a healthcare professional if symptoms do not improve after 3 weeks or become severe.\n\nTo diagnose the underlying cause of sinusitis, a healthcare professional may refer an individual to an ear, nose, and throat specialist. In some cases, minor surgery may be necessary to drain the sinuses.\n\nTips for preventing sinusitis include avoiding smoking and other known triggers or allergens.\n\nLearn more about treating sinus infections.\n\nA high caffeine intake — more than 400 milligrams (mg), or around 4 cups of coffee per day — can sometimes lead to headaches.\n\nIn people consuming more than 200 mg of caffeine daily for over 2 weeks, withdrawal may result in migraine-like headaches.\n\nThese typically develop 12–24 hours after stopping caffeine consumption abruptly. They peak at 20–51 hours and can last 2–9 days.\n\nOther possible symptoms include:\n\ntiredness\n\ndifficulty concentrating\n\nreduced mood or irritability\n\nnausea\n\nThe effects of caffeine vary from person to person, but reducing intake could decrease the risk of getting headaches. Limiting caffeine consumption may also help people who have chronic migraine.\n\nLearn more about caffeine withdrawal headaches.\n\nSometimes, a person develops a headache immediately or soon after a head injury.\n\nOTC pain relief often resolves this. However, if symptoms are severe or worsen over time, an individual should seek immediate medical attention.\n\nAlways call an ambulance for a serious head injury or if the following symptoms occur after a head injury:\n\nunconsciousness\n\nseizures\n\nvomiting\n\nmemory loss\n\nconfusion\n\nvision or hearing problems\n\nPost-traumatic headaches can also develop months after the original head injury, making them difficult to diagnose. They can sometimes occur daily and persist for up to 12 months.\n\nEven a small blow to the head can result in a traumatic brain injury.\n\nLearn more about head injuries.\n\nConsuming excessive alcohol can lead to a throbbing headache the following day or even later that day. These migraine-like headaches usually occur on both sides of the head and can worsen from movement.\n\nSomeone with a hangover headache may also experience nausea and sensitivity to light.\n\nTreatment\n\nThere are no cures for hangovers, but it is possible to relieve symptoms by drinking plenty of water and eating sugary foods. OTC painkillers may help reduce or stop the headache.\n\nSymptoms of hangovers tend to go away within 72 hours.\n\nWays of reducing the risk of a hangover include:\n\ndrinking in moderation\n\nnot drinking on an empty stomach\n\ndrinking water between alcoholic beverages and before going to bed\n\nLearn more about managing a hangover headache.\n\nHeadache and migraine resources\n\nTo discover more evidence-based information and resources for headaches and migraine, visit our dedicated hub.\n\nHeadaches are a common issue, but most people can manage them with OTC pain relief, such as acetaminophen.\n\nHowever, anyone who experiences severe, persistent, recurrent, or worsening headaches should consult a healthcare professional.
