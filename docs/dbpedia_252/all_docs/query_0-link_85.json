        "text": "Originally a disciple of classic Disney animator, John Ewing (The Jungle Book, 101 Dalmatians), and the ancient art of hand-drawn animation at the Freelance School of Animation in Auckland, New Zealand, I later went on to become an animation instructor myself, before heading back into the classroom to study 3D animation and video editing at the University of Massachusetts, and then motion graphics and design with the School of Motion.\n\nMy love of teaching has led me into the realm of ESL for much of the last 10 years, and as such, my portfolio is slightly less prolific as a result. Nevertheless, I have endeavoured to keep my creative chops sharp through further studies online as well as a variety of freelance projects, and would be a reliable and professional choice for your animation or design requirements. So drop me a line!"
