Safety is the primary goal of all parking restrictions. Restrictions also support the diverse needs of the City's on-street parking users and stakeholders. Parking citations/tickets are issued to improve compliance with these restrictions.\n\nA customer service portal is available that provides the current status of parking citations and alerts users when new citations have been issued to a license plate. The information available comes directly from our parking citation database in real time to ensure accuracy. With this website, you can view the current amount due, appeal or pay a citation (if timely), check the status of your appeal, and view any associated photos that may have been taken at the time of issuance.\n\nYour parking citation number is required to pay a parking citation. If you do not have the citation number, provide the license plate number and state for the vehicle cited.\n\nGo to the Customer Services Portal\n\nFailure to Pay\n\nParking citations that remain unpaid will result in a lien against the vehicle registration including additional fees and penalties. The amount due may also be forwarded to the Delinquent Accounts Program for collection.\n\nNOTE: If your citation is delinquent, you may owe additional penalties and interest that are not included in the amount due. For more information, contact the City Treasurer's Delinquent Accounts Program.\n\nLow Income Payment Plan Options\n\nPayment plans are available to customers who qualify as low income.
