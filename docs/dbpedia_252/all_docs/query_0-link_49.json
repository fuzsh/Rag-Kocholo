However, at some point he appears to have been superceded in the centre back stakes by the likes of Scott Cuthbert and Darren O'Dea which possibly contributed to his release from the club at the conclusion of the 2003/4 season.\n\nWhen a trial with St. Johnstone in August '04 failed to yield a contract offer, Low saw out the season with local side Wishaw Juniors. Remarkably, given that he had been a regular in the Scotland U19 team only the previous season.\n\nAnother season in the juniors with Kilsyth Rangers brought him to the attention of Elgin City manager and former Scotland defender Brian Irvine who offered him another crack at the senior game in summer 2006. Sadly the hapless Highlanders were something of a shambles at the time and Low's performances seem to have been characterised by red cards and own goals. After conceding fifteen goals in three games (including five in a humiliating cup exit to non-league Deveronvale) a new manager replaced Irvine in January '07 and Low found himself a casualty of the new regime, 'reinstated' to Junior outfit Shotts Bon Accord.\n\nLow has since remained in the West Region Junior circuit. Leaving relegated Shotts for Petershill in summer 2008 and heading on to Bellshill Athletic in February 2009, the latter a swap deal involving former Celtic Boys Club player Martin Lauchlan (ex-Partick and St. Johnstone). He moved on to Thorniewood United in summer 2010.\n\nPlaying Career\n\nTeam League Appearances League Goals 2001/02 Celtic 0 0 2002/03 Celtic 0 0 2003/04 Celtic 0 0 2004/05 St. Johnstone (Trial) 0 0 Wishaw ? ? 2005/06 Kilsyth Rangers ? ? 2006/07 Elgin City 13 0 Shotts Bon Accord ? ? 2007/08 Shotts Bon Accord ? ? 2008/09 Petershill ? ?
