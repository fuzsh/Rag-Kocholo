        "text": "Prior to submission, please carefully read and follow the submission guidelines detailed below. Manuscripts that do not conform to the submission guidelines may be returned without review.\n\nSubmission\n\nTo submit to the editorial office of Aidan G. C. Wright, please submit manuscripts electronically through the Manuscript Submission Portal in Microsoft Word or Open Office format.\n\nThe Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science is now format free for initial submissions. That means that for first submissions manuscripts can be submitted in any reasonable format and will not be returned for formatting style.\n\nIf you are invited to revise your manuscript after an initial round of reviews, you will be asked to format the manuscript according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association using the 7th edition. Accepted manuscripts may be copyedited for bias-free language (see Chapter 5 of the Publication Manual). APA Style and Grammar Guidelines for the 7th edition are available.\n\nHandling editors will use a checklist to assist in tracking adherence to key submission requirements related to reporting standards and transparency. We make the checklist available to submitting authors to assist in manuscript preparation.\n\nSubmit Manuscript\n\nAidan G. C. Wright, PhD\n\nEditor, Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science\n\nDepartment of Psychology\n\nUniversity of Michigan\n\n2nd Floor, East Hall\n\n530 Church Street\n\nAnn Arbor, MI 48109\n\nGeneral correspondence may be directed to the editor's office.\n\nThe Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science is now using a software system to screen submitted content for similarity with other published content. The system compares the initial version of each submitted manuscript against a database of 40+ million scholarly documents, as well as content appearing on the open web. This allows APA to check submissions for potential overlap with material previously published in scholarly journals (e.g., lifted or republished material).\n\nMasked reviews\n\nMasked reviews are optional and must be specifically requested in the cover letter accompanying the submission. For masked reviews, the manuscript must include a separate title page with the authors' names and affiliations, and these ought not to appear anywhere else in the manuscript.\n\nFootnotes that identify the authors must be typed on a separate page.\n\nMake every effort to see that the manuscript itself contains no clues to authors' identities, including grant numbers, names of institutions providing IRB approval, self-citations that indicate that the citation pertains to the authors, and links to online repositories for data, materials, code, or preregistrations (e.g., Create a View-only Link for a Project).\n\nTypes of articles\n\nViewpoint papers\n\nViewpoint papers are brief papers about important topics related to psychopathology and clinical psychology and discuss new developments in research, innovations, weaknesses of the field, and current debates. The goal of viewpoint papers is to provide a platform for and generate discourse about important issues in the field, which are supported by empirical evidence but go beyond that. Viewpoint papers should be brief (no more than 1200 words, including references but exclusive of title page, no more than 10 references, no abstract, and no more than three authors). They do not require pre-approval for submission, but authors considering submitting a viewpoint paper are welcome to reach out to the Editor, Aidan Wright, in advance to discuss it.\n\nBrief report\n\nThe manuscript should not exceed 5,000 words when including the abstract, body of the text, tables, table captions, figure captions, footnotes, author notes, appendices, and references in a word count.\n\nNote that supplementary materials and figures are not included in the word count.\n\nBrief reports can have a maximum of two figures (there is no table limit).\n\nRegular article\n\nThe manuscript should not exceed 9,000 words when including the abstract, body of the text, tables, table captions, figure captions, footnotes, author notes, appendices, and references in a word count.\n\nNote that supplementary materials and figures are not included in the word count.\n\nExtended article\n\nExtended articles are published within regular issues of the journal (they are not free-standing). This article type is reserved for manuscripts that require extended exposition beyond the length of a regular article (e.g., reporting results of multiple experiments, multifaceted longitudinal studies, cross-disciplinary investigations, or studies that are extraordinarily complex in terms of methodology or analysis).\n\nExtended article submissions do not require preclearance from the editorial office. However, they should include a cover letter that provides a justification for this format.\n\nSubmissions that exceed 9,000 words without a justification will be returned for shortening.\n\nCommentary\n\nCommentaries on articles previously published in the Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science are also considered for publication. Commentaries may contain original data relevant to the topic at hand but are not required to do so. They are subject to the same editorial criteria and standards as any other manuscript. If a commentary is deemed acceptable for publication, authors of the original submission are given the opportunity to reply to the commentary. Commentaries and replies should typically have a maximum of three authors, 1,200 words, and 10 references. Deviations from this format may be requested by emailing the editor. A commentary and reply will be published together. Except under rare circumstances, there will be only one round of comment and reply.\n\nReplications and Registered Reports\n\nThe Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science publishes direct replications. Submissions should include “A Replication of XX Study” in the subtitle of the manuscript as well as in the abstract.\n\nThe Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science also publishes Registered Reports. Registered reports require a two-step review process. The first step is the submission of the registration manuscript. This is a partial manuscript that includes hypotheses, rationale for the study, experimental design, and methods. The partial manuscript will be reviewed for rigor and methodological approach.\n\nIf the partial manuscript is accepted, this amounts to provisional acceptance of the full report regardless of the outcome of the study. The full manuscript will be reviewed for adherence to the preregistered design (deviations should be reported in the manuscript).\n\nCover letters\n\nCover letters are not required, though authors are welcome to include one if there is additional relevant information related to processing or handling the article that it would be helpful for the editorial team to know.\n\nOpen science badges\n\nArticles are eligible for open science badges recognizing publicly available data, materials, and/or preregistration plans and analyses. These badges are awarded on a self-disclosure basis.\n\nAt submission, authors must confirm that criteria have been fulfilled in a signed badge disclosure form (PDF, 42KB) that must be submitted as supplemental material. If all criteria are met as confirmed by the editor, the form will then be published with the article as supplemental material.\n\nAuthors should also note their eligibility for the badge(s) in the cover letter.\n\nFor all badges, items must be made available on an open-access repository with a persistent identifier in a format that is time-stamped, immutable, and permanent. For the preregistered badge, this is an institutional registration system.\n\nData and materials must be made available under an open license allowing others to copy, share, and use the data, with attribution and copyright as applicable.\n\nAvailable badges are:\n\nOpen Data:\n\nAll data necessary to reproduce the reported results that are digitally shareable are made publicly available. Information necessary for replication (e.g., codebooks or metadata) must be included.\n\nOpen Data: Protected Access:\n\nA Protected Access (PA) notation may be added to open data badges if sensitive, personal data are available only from an approved third-party repository that manages access to data to qualified researchers through a documented process. To be eligible for an open data badge with such a notation, the repository must publicly describe the steps necessary to obtain the data and detailed data documentation (e.g. variable names and allowed values) must be made available publicly.\n\nOpen Materials:\n\nAll materials necessary to reproduce the reported results that are digitally shareable, along with descriptions of non-digital materials necessary for replication, are made publicly available.\n\nPreregistered:\n\nAt least one study’s design has been preregistered with descriptions of (a) the research design and study materials, including the planned sample size; (b) the motivating research question or hypothesis; (c) the outcome variable(s); and (d) the predictor variables, including controls, covariates, and independent variables. Results must be fully disclosed. As long as they are distinguished from other results in the article, results from analyses that were not preregistered may be reported in the article.\n\nPreregistered+Analysis Plan:\n\nAt least one study’s design has been preregistered along with an analysis plan for the research—and results are recorded according to that plan.\n\nNote that it may not be possible to preregister a study or to share data and materials. Applying for open science badges is optional.\n\nManuscript preparation\n\nAs noted above, initial submissions of manuscripts no longer have formatting requirements. Any reasonably clear and easy to follow format will suffice. Manuscripts that are invited for resubmission following an initial round of review will be asked to conform to the following guidelines.\n\nPrepare manuscripts according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association using the 7th edition. Manuscripts may be copyedited for bias-free language (see Chapter 5 of the Publication Manual).\n\nDouble-space all copy. Other formatting instructions, as well as instructions on preparing tables, figures, references, metrics, and abstracts, appear in the Manual. Additional guidance on APA Style is available on the APA Style website.\n\nBelow are additional instructions regarding the preparation of display equations, computer code, and tables.\n\nDisplay equations\n\nWe strongly encourage you to use MathType (third-party software) or Equation Editor 3.0 (built into pre-2007 versions of Word) to construct your equations, rather than the equation support that is built into Word 2007 and Word 2010. Equations composed with the built-in Word 2007/Word 2010 equation support are converted to low-resolution graphics when they enter the production process and must be rekeyed by the typesetter, which may introduce errors.\n\nTo construct your equations with MathType or Equation Editor 3.0:\n\nGo to the Text section of the Insert tab and select Object.\n\nSelect MathType or Equation Editor 3.0 in the drop-down menu.\n\nIf you have an equation that has already been produced using Microsoft Word 2007 or 2010 and you have access to the full version of MathType 6.5 or later, you can convert this equation to MathType by clicking on MathType Insert Equation. Copy the equation from Microsoft Word and paste it into the MathType box. Verify that your equation is correct, click File, and then click Update. Your equation has now been inserted into your Word file as a MathType Equation.\n\nUse Equation Editor 3.0 or MathType only for equations or for formulas that cannot be produced as Word text using the Times or Symbol font.\n\nComputer code\n\nBecause altering computer code in any way (e.g., indents, line spacing, line breaks, page breaks) during the typesetting process could alter its meaning, we treat computer code differently from the rest of your article in our production process. To that end, we request separate files for computer code.\n\nIn online supplemental material\n\nWe request that runnable source code be included as supplemental material to the article. For more information, visit Supplementing Your Article With Online Material.\n\nIn the text of the article\n\nIf you would like to include code in the text of your published manuscript, please submit a separate file with your code exactly as you want it to appear, using Courier New font with a type size of 8 points. We will make an image of each segment of code in your article that exceeds 40 characters in length. (Shorter snippets of code that appear in text will be typeset in Courier New and run in with the rest of the text.) If an appendix contains a mix of code and explanatory text, please submit a file that contains the entire appendix, with the code keyed in 8-point Courier New.\n\nTables\n\nUse Word's insert table function when you create tables. Using spaces or tabs in your table will create problems when the table is typeset and may result in errors.\n\nAcademic writing and English language editing services\n\nAuthors who feel that their manuscript may benefit from additional academic writing or language editing support prior to submission are encouraged to seek out such services at their host institutions, engage with colleagues and subject matter experts, and/or consider several vendors that offer discounts to APA authors.\n\nPlease note that APA does not endorse or take responsibility for the service providers listed. It is strictly a referral service.\n\nUse of such service is not mandatory for publication in an APA journal. Use of one or more of these services does not guarantee selection for peer review, manuscript acceptance, or preference for publication in any APA journal.\n\nSubmitting supplemental materials\n\nAPA can place supplemental materials online, available via the published article in the PsycArticles® database. Please see Supplementing Your Article With Online Material for more details.\n\nAbstract and keywords\n\nAll manuscripts must include an abstract containing a maximum of 250 words typed on a separate page. After the abstract, please supply up to five keywords or brief phrases.\n\nAuthor contribution statements using CRediT\n\nThe APA Publication Manual (7th ed.), which stipulates that \"authorship encompasses…not only persons who do the writing but also those who have made substantial scientific contributions to a study.\" In the spirit of transparency and openness, the Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science has adopted the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) to describe each author's individual contributions to the work. CRediT offers authors the opportunity to share an accurate and detailed description of their diverse contributions to a manuscript.\n\nSubmitting authors will be asked to identify the contributions of all authors at initial submission according to the CRediT taxonomy. If the manuscript is accepted for publication, the CRediT designations will be published as an author contributions statement in the author note of the final article. All authors should have reviewed and agreed to their individual contribution(s) before submission.\n\nCRediT includes 14 contributor roles, as described below:\n\nConceptualization: Ideas; formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and aims.\n\nData curation: Management activities to annotate (produce metadata), scrub data and maintain research data (including software code, where it is necessary for interpreting the data itself) for initial use and later re-use.\n\nFormal analysis: Application of statistical, mathematical, computational, or other formal techniques to analyze or synthesize study data.\n\nFunding acquisition: Acquisition of the financial support for the project leading to this publication.\n\nInvestigation: Conducting a research and investigation process, specifically performing the experiments, or data/evidence collection.\n\nMethodology: Development or design of methodology; creation of models.\n\nProject administration: Management and coordination responsibility for the research activity planning and execution.\n\nResources: Provision of study materials, reagents, materials, patients, laboratory samples, animals, instrumentation, computing resources, or other analysis tools.\n\nSoftware: Programming, software development; designing computer programs; implementation of the computer code and supporting algorithms; testing of existing code components.\n\nSupervision: Oversight and leadership responsibility for the research activity planning and execution, including mentorship external to the core team.\n\nValidation: Verification, whether as a part of the activity or separate, of the overall replication/reproducibility of results/experiments and other research outputs.\n\nVisualization: Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically visualization/data presentation.\n\nWriting—original draft: Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically writing the initial draft (including substantive translation).\n\nWriting—review and editing: Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work by those from the original research group, specifically critical review, commentary or revision: including pre- or post-publication stages.\n\nAuthors can claim credit for more than one contributor role, and the same role can be attributed to more than one author.\n\nGeneral Scientific Summaries\n\nPlease provide a General Scientific Summary (GSS) of the paper on the manuscript file below the abstract.\n\nThis should be a brief (2–3 sentences) statement that, in nontechnical language, explains the contributions of the paper.\n\nThis is not a simplified version of the abstract, which highlights the details of your study and its findings for other specialists who know the history of the research, will be able to comprehend a description of methodology, and can determine the significance of your results amidst more technical language.\n\nRather, assume that the reader is an intelligent, interested individual who might know something about abnormal psychology, but may not know technical terms or abbreviations such as ERP, SEM, endophenotype, error-related negativity, or mediation.\n\nExamples are included below:\n\n\"This study suggests that some approaches to subtyping eating disorders in adolescence, specifically those that include _____, _____, and _____, may be more useful than _____in predicting outcomes in young adulthood.\"\n\n\"Decreased motivation to seek out rewarding experiences is a key symptom in depression. This study supports the notion that for depressed individuals, this decrease in motivation is more likely due to lower anticipation that an activity will be pleasurable than by the ability to actually experience pleasure during the activity itself.\"\n\nReferences\n\nList references in alphabetical order. Each listed reference should be cited in text, and each text citation should be listed in the references section.\n\nExamples of basic reference formats:\n\nJournal article\n\nMcCauley, S.

The standards offer ways to improve transparency in reporting to ensure that readers have the information necessary to evaluate the quality of the research and to facilitate collaboration and replication.\n\nThe JARS:\n\nrecommend the division of hypotheses, analyses and conclusions into primary, secondary, and exploratory groupings to allow for a full understanding of quantitative analyses presented in a manuscript and to enhance reproducibility;\n\noffer modules for authors reporting on replications, clinical trials, longitudinal studies, and observational studies, as well as the analytic methods of structural equation modeling and Bayesian analysis; and\n\ninclude guidelines on reporting on of study preregistration (including making protocols public); participant characteristics (including demographic characteristics; inclusion and exclusion criteria) psychometric characteristics of outcome measures and other variables, and planned data diagnostics and analytic strategy.\n\nThe guidelines focus on transparency in methods reporting, recommending descriptions of how the researchers’ own perspectives affected the study, as well as the contexts in which the research and analysis took place.\n\nPlease note that for quantitative JARS, this includes the reliability estimates for the measures in the sample(s) analyzed in the study (note this includes methods like self-reports and interviews as well as tasks and behavioral paradigms), effect size estimates, confidence/credibility intervals, exact p-values (to at least three digits). Additionally, we interpret the standard of including the sample size in the abstract to mean the final analyzed sample size(s). If the study uses a subset of a larger sample (e.g., only examining those with particular demographics, a portion of participants were excluded for poor data quality), then the sample size reported in the abstract should not be the larger sample size but only the size after exclusions were made.\n\nReporting year(s) of data collection\n\nAuthors are encouraged to disclose the year(s) of data collection in both the Abstract and in the Method section to appropriately contextualize the study.\n\nConstraints on generality\n\nIn a subsection of the discussion titled \"Constraints on generality,\" authors should include a detailed discussion of the limits on generality (see Simons, Shoda, & Lindsay, 2017). In this section, authors should detail grounds for concluding why the results are may or may not be specific to the characteristics of the participants. They should address limits on generality not only for participants but for materials, procedures, and context. Authors should also specify which methods they think could be varied without affecting the result and which should remain constant.\n\nParticipant description, sample justification, and informed consent\n\nAuthors must include a detailed description of the study participants in the Method section of each empirical report, including (but not limited to) the following:\n\nage\n\nsex\n\ngender\n\nracial identity\n\nethnicity\n\nnativity or immigration history\n\nsocioeconomic status\n\nclinical diagnoses and comorbidities (as appropriate)\n\nany other relevant demographics (e.g., disability status; sexual orientation)\n\nIf some of these were not collected, the manuscript should state that they were not collected. In both the abstract and in the discussion section of the manuscript, authors must discuss the diversity of their study samples and the generalizability of their findings (see also the constraints on generality section below).\n\nAuthors must justify their sample demographics in the Discussion section. If Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) or all-White samples are used, authors should justify their samples and describe their sample inclusion efforts (see Roberts, et al., 2020 for more information on justifying sample demographics).\n\nThe Method section also must include a statement describing how informed consent was obtained from the participants (or their parents/guardians), including for secondary use of data if applicable, and indicate that the study was conducted in compliance with an appropriate Internal Review Board.\n\nTransparency and openness\n\nAPA endorses the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines developed by a community working group in conjunction with the Center for Open Science (Nosek et al. 2015). Empirical research, including meta-analyses, submitted to the Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science must at least meet the “requirement” level for all aspects of research planning and reporting. Authors should include a subsection in the method section titled “Transparency and openness.” This subsection should detail the efforts the authors have made to comply with the TOP guidelines. For example:\n\nWe report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study, and we follow JARS (Appelbaum et al., 2018). All data, analysis code, and research materials are available at [stable link to repository]. Data were analyzed using R, version 4.0.0 (R Core Team, 2020) and the package ggplot, version 3.2.1 (Wickham, 2016). This study’s design and its analysis were not pre-registered.\n\nLinks to preregistrations and data, code, and materials should also be included in the author note.\n\nData, materials, and code\n\nAuthors must state whether data and study materials are posted to a trusted repository and, if so, how to access them. If they cannot be made available, authors must state the legal or ethical reasons why they are not available. All submissions must include the code and output of the models reported in the manuscript. These must be in a widely legible format (e.g., file that can be opened with basic text editing software or saved as a PDF). The only exception to this requirement is for code to calculate basic descriptive statistics (e.g., means, variances, standard deviations, Pearson correlations). Code may be submitted as supplemental materials or submitted to a trusted repository. Trusted repositories adhere to policies that make data discoverable, accessible, usable, and preserved for the long term. Trusted repositories also assign unique and persistent identifiers. Recommended repositories include APA’s repository on the Open Science Framework (OSF).\n\nIn a subsection titled \"Transparency and Openness\" at the end of the method section, specify whether and where the data and material will be available or include a statement noting that they are not available and why. For example:\n\nAll data have been made publicly available at the [trusted repository name] and can be accessed at [persistent URL or DOI].\n\nMaterials for this study are not openly available. Interested parties may request access by emailing the corresponding author.\n\nMaterials for this study are not available because they are restricted access by the publisher.\n\nThe code behind this analysis/simulation has been made publicly available at the [trusted repository name] and can be accessed at [persistent URL or DOI].\n\nPreregistration of studies and analysis plans\n\nPreregistration of studies and specific hypotheses can be a useful tool for making strong theoretical claims. Likewise, preregistration of analysis plans can be useful for distinguishing confirmatory and exploratory analyses. We encourage investigators to preregister their studies and analysis plans prior to conducting the research via a publicly accessible registry system (e.g., OSF, ClinicalTrials.gov, or other trial registries in the WHO Registry Network).\n\nThere are many available templates; for example, APA, the British Psychological Society, and the German Psychological Society partnered with the Leibniz Institute for Psychology and Center for Open Science to create Preregistration Standards for Quantitative Research in Psychology (Bosnjak et al., 2022).\n\nArticles must state whether or not any work was preregistered and, if so, where to access the preregistration. Preregistrations must be available to reviewers; authors may submit a masked copy via stable link or supplemental material. Links in the method section should be replaced with an identifiable copy on acceptance. For example:\n\nThis study’s design was preregistered; see [STABLE LINK OR DOI].\n\nThis study’s design and hypotheses were preregistered; see [STABLE LINK OR DOI].\n\nThis study’s analysis plan was preregistered; see [STABLE LINK OR DOI].\n\nThis study was not preregistered.\n\nPermissions\n\nAuthors of accepted papers must obtain and provide to the editor on final acceptance all necessary permissions to reproduce in print and electronic form any copyrighted work, including test materials (or portions thereof), photographs, and other graphic images (including those used as stimuli in experiments).\n\nOn advice of counsel, APA may decline to publish any image whose copyright status is unknown.\n\nDownload Permissions Alert Form (PDF, 13KB)\n\nPublication policies\n\nFor full details on publication policies, including use of Artificial Intelligence tools, please see APA Publishing Policies.\n\nAPA policy prohibits an author from submitting the same manuscript for concurrent consideration by two or more publications.\n\nSee also APA Journals® Internet Posting Guidelines.\n\nAPA requires authors to reveal any possible conflict of interest in the conduct and reporting of research (e.g., financial interests in a test or procedure, funding by pharmaceutical companies for drug research).\n\nDownload Full Disclosure of Interests Form (PDF, 41KB)\n\nIn light of changing patterns of scientific knowledge dissemination, APA requires authors to provide information on prior dissemination of the data and narrative interpretations of the data/research appearing in the manuscript (e.g., if some or all were presented at a conference or meeting, posted on a listserv, shared on a website, including academic social networks like ResearchGate, etc.). This information (2–4 sentences) must be provided as part of the Author Note.\n\nEthical Principles\n\nIt is a violation of APA Ethical Principles to publish \"as original data, data that have been previously published\" (Standard 8.13).\n\nIn addition, APA Ethical Principles specify that \"after research results are published, psychologists do not withhold the data on which their conclusions are based from other competent professionals who seek to verify the substantive claims through reanalysis and who intend to use such data only for that purpose, provided that the confidentiality of the participants can be protected and unless legal rights concerning proprietary data preclude their release\" (Standard 8.14).\n\nAPA expects authors to adhere to these standards. Specifically, APA expects authors to have their data available throughout the editorial review process and for at least 5 years after the date of publication.\n\nAuthors are required to state in writing that they have complied with APA ethical standards in the treatment of their sample, human or animal, or to describe the details of treatment.\n\nPlease include in the Author Note information regarding your research ethics committee approval (i.e., institution granting approval, study name, or study #).\n\nDownload Certification of Compliance With APA Ethical Principles Form (PDF, 26KB)\n\nThe APA Ethics Office provides the full Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct electronically on its website in HTML, PDF, and Word format. You may also request a copy by emailing or calling the APA Ethics Office (202-336-5930). You may also read \"Ethical Principles,\" December 1992, American Psychologist, Vol. 47, pp. 1597–1611.\n\nOther information\n\nSee APA’s Publishing Policies page for more information on publication policies, including information on author contributorship and responsibilities of authors, author name changes after publication, the use of generative artificial intelligence, funder information and conflict-of-interest disclosures, duplicate publication, data publication and reuse, and preprints."
