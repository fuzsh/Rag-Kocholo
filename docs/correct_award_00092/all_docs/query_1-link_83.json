A detailed inventory of the collection's contents is available on request.\n\nIn 1978, a portion of the Gabriela Mistral Library, approximately 900 books, was donated to the Barnard Archives by Dorothy Dana, Mistral’s life-long companion, translator of her work, and Barnard alumna. In 2009, after the passing of Dorothy Dana, it was determined by the Barnard Library Dean Carol Falcione and Doris Atkinson, the executor of Dorothy Dana’s estate, that the Gabriela Mistral Library would be best used if returned to Chile and reunited with another portion of Mistral’s library. In exchange, the National Library of Chile and the Division of Libraries, Archives, and Museums (Dirección de Bibliotecas, Archivos y Museos or DIBAM) provided Barnard Archives and Special Collections with microfilm copies of the entirety of Mistral’s literary archive."
