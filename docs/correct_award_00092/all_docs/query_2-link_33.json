        "text": "The first Nobel Prize in literature to be awarded to a Latin American writer went to the Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral. Famous and beloved during her lifetime all over Latin America and in Europe, Mistral has never been known in North America as she deserves to be. The reputation of her more flamboyant and accessible friend and countryman Pablo Neruda has overshadowed hers, and she has been officially sentimentalized into a \"poetess\" of children and motherhood. Translations, and even selections of her work in Spanish, have tended to underplay the darkness, the strangeness, and the raging intensity of her poems of grief and pain, the yearning power of her evocations of the Chilean landscape, the stark music of her Round Dances, the visionary splendor of her Hymns of America.\n\nDuring her lifetime Mistral published four books: Desolation, Tenderness, Clearcut, and Winepress. These are included in the \"Complete\" Nobel edition published in Madrid; the Poem of Chile, her last book, was printed years after her death. Le Guin includes poems from all five books in this volume, with particular emphasis on the later work. The intelligence and passion of Le Guin's selection and translation will finally allow people in the North to hear the originality, power, purity, and intransigence of this great American voice.\n\nStrongly drawn to Mistral's work as soon as she discovered it, Le Guin worked on this translation for five years.\n\nSelected Poems of Gabriela Mistral was first published by the University of New Mexico Press as a hardcover in 2003, and softcover in 2011.\n\nNotes from Ursula\n\nThis is the first presentation in English and Spanish of a really substantial selection of the poetry of Gabriela Mistral — the first Latin American, and the only Latin American woman, to receive the Nobel Prize.\n\nAll five of Mistral’s books — Desolacion, Ternura, Tala, Lagar, and Poema de Chile — are fully represented, with an introductory note and a biographical sketch for each.\n\nThis translation was a labor of love for many years. There is no other voice in poetry like Mistral’s, from the miraculous clarity of her rounds and lullabyes, to the fiery rage of her love poems, to the dark complexity and visionary power of her late work. I hope this book may begin to restore this amazing poet to the recognition she deserves. Most of all I hope it comes to the hands of readers who will love her.\n\n— Ursula K. Le Guin\n\n2011\n\nFor the last several years I have been working on a translation of the Chilean poet and Nobel Prize winner Gabriela Mistral. (She was about a half-generation older than Pablo Neruda, and I think he learned a great deal from her.) Her Nobel was the first ever given to a South American writer.\n\nWhat translations there are of Mistral are not easy to find, and many of her most powerful poems have never been put into English. The University of New Mexico Press published it in September, 2003.\n\nI fell in love with Mistral when I first read her, and the love only grows deeper as I work with her words and try to understand and to reflect her passion and her art. Here are three of her poems and my versions.\n\n— Ursula K. Le Guin\n\n2003"
