        "text": "De Gabriela Mistral\n\nA selection of Christopher Joannon\n\nIllustrated by Bernadette Ojeda\n\nSimplicity and mystery are perhaps the two words that best describe Gabriela Mistral's poetry. In this anthology poems have been collected that confirm that his work was inspired - in the words of the Swedish Academy when it awarded him the Nobel Prize for Literature - by \"powerful emotions.\"\n\nAlso available in ebooks:\n\nFORMAT\n\nRecommended for 8 to 12 years\n\nDesign: Book with painted edges\n\nBinding: Hardcover\n\nSize: 23 x 16 cm\n\nPages: 60\n\nVintage: 2011\n\nISBN: 978-956-8209-72-8\n\nREVIEW\n\nFor Gabriela Mistral the joys and sorrows of childhood were a recurring theme in her life; his much celebrated poem \"We were all going to be queens\" is perhaps the best example of this. Gabriela Mistral did not have children, something she always wanted, but this did not prevent her from writing very remarkable lullabies and children's rounds. \"Sleep, sleep, Christian child\" is the expression of a deep love for those who have come to this world.\n\nChristopher Joannon.\n\nAUTHORS\n\nGabriela Mistral He was born in 1889 in Vicuña, a small town located where the Elqui Valley ends. Her father was a school teacher, a profession that she also practiced at the early age of 15. Very concerned about Chilean education, she wrote about the need for a law to ensure primary education. She is one of the most important writers in Chilean history, which earned her the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1945 and the National Prize for Literature in 1951."
