        "text": "Full Name: Lucila Godoy y Alcayaga\n\nProfession: Poet and Educator\n\nBiography: Gabriela Mistral, a pseudonym for Lucila Godoy y Alcayaga, became the first Latin American to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for her poetry in 1945.\n\nBorn into a humble background in rural Chile, she first rose to prominence in 1914 with her collection “Sonetos de la muerte” (“Sonnets of Death”) for which won she a literary prize. Desolación (“Desolation”), a collection of her early works was published in 1922. Other major volumes include Ternura (“Tenderness”) 1924, and Tala (“Destruction”) in 1938.\n\nIn her early working life Mistral worked as a teacher and educator in Chile and Mexico, including meeting a young Pablo Neruda, whose literary development she encouraged. Later in life Mistral worked for the UN, taught at American universities as a professor and served Chile as its consul in Madrid.\n\nHer poetry is passionate and spiritual often championing the underdog, with themes of childhood and maternity running throughout.\n\nBorn: April 7, 1889\n\nBirthplace: Vicuña, Chie\n\nGeneration: Lost Generation\n\nStar Sign: Aries"
