        "text": "(1889–1957). In 1945 the Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral became the first Latin American woman to win the Nobel prize for literature. Throughout her life she combined writing with a career as an educator, cultural minister, and diplomat; her diplomatic assignments included posts in Madrid, Lisbon, Genoa, and Nice.\n\nOf Spanish, Basque, and Indian descent, she was born Lucila Godoy Alcayaga on April 7, 1889, in Vicuña, Chile. She grew up in a village of northern Chile and became a schoolteacher at 15, advancing later to the rank of college professor.\n\nHer reputation as a poet was established in 1914 when she won a Chilean prize for three Sonetos de la muerte (Sonnets of Death). They were signed with the name by which she has since been known, which she coined from those of two of her favorite poets, Gabriele d’Annunzio and Frédéric Mistral. A collection of her early works, Desolación (1922; Desolation), includes the poem Dolor, detailing the aftermath of a love affair that was ended by the suicide of her lover. Because of this tragedy she never married, and a haunting, wistful strain of thwarted maternal tenderness informs her work. Ternura (1924, enlarged 1945; Tenderness), Tala (1938; Destruction), and Lagar (1954; The Wine Press) evidence a broader interest in humanity, but love of children and of the downtrodden remained her principal themes."
