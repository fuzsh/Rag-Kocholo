And let my cry of pain rise in\n\nthe dawn, braided into the singing of birds!\n\nJanuary 6, 2022\n\nA woman is singing in the valley. The shadows falling blot her\n\nout, but her song spreads over the fields.\n\nHer heart is broken, like the jar she dropped this afternoon\n\namong the pebbles in the brook. As she sings, the hidden wound\n\nsharpens on the thread of her song, and becomes thin and hard.\n\nHer voice in modulation dampens with blood.\n\nIn the fields the other voices die with the dying day, and a\n\nmoment ago the song of the last slow-poke bird stopped. But her\n\ndeathless heart, alive with grief, gathers all the silent voices into\n\nher voice, sharp now, yet very sweet.\n\nDoes she sing for a husband who looks at her silently in the\n\ndusk, or for a child whom her song caresses? Or does she sing for\n\nher own heart, more helpless than a babe at nightfall.\n\nNight grows maternal before this song that goes to meet it; the\n\nstars, with a sweetness that is human, are beginning to come out;\n\nthe sky full of stars becomes human and understands the sorrows\n\nof this world.\n\nHer song, as pure as water filled with light, cleanses the plain\n\nand rinses the mean air of day in which men hate. From the throat\n\nof the woman who keeps on singing, day rises nobly evaporating\n\ntoward the stars.\n\nApril 26, 2021\n\nI have dedicated the year 2021 to reading various literary classics which I have neglected until now for various reasons. The last one I finished reading is this anthology of the Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral's work, her being notable as the first Latin American author to win the Nobel Prize in Literature back in 1945. The impetus for me to finally read Mistral being her countryman Alejandro Jodorowsky naming her as an inspiration in his \"Psychomagic\".\n\nI ended up quite liking this, despite not getting all the references to obscure corners of Christian mysticism and Spanish-language authors that are rather obscure in the Germanic cultural sphere which I inhabit. Fortunately, the edition I read had a bunch of footnotes explaining all the surrounding cultural context that might be lost on readers outside the Hispanosphere. The symbolism which Gabriela Mistral uses throughout her poetic career is very varied but remains consistent in revolving around the same recurrent themes: Journeys through deserts, forests and mountains as metaphors for spiritual development; plants as metaphors for individual human souls; frequent allusions to classical Greco-Roman mythology; multiple female protagonists that are obvious representations for different sides of the author's own personality. Many of the poems have a surrealistic dream-like feel with delirious melancholic atmosphere and abstract metaphysical philosophising holding everything together. Later on, the poems become more ambitious with clearly defined narratives and multiple viewpoint characters while using more symbolism related to the sea and the cosmos. It's an interesting and satisfying experience to see an author's writing style change so much through their career yet remain the output of the same creative personality.\n\nAll in all, I have to say that Ms. Mistral very much deserved her Nobel Prize if this compilation is a good representation of her poetic work. It is a long time ago a historically important poet I had slept on for too long has impressed me this much with only Georg Trakl coming close.\n\nMay 12, 2021\n\nI'm conflicted about this poetry collection (and honestly quite disappointed because I love Gabriela Mistral, she is a gay icon and the fact that she was the first Latin American woman to obtain a Nobel prize is amazing)\n\nI thought most of the poems were simple and plain, they lacked expertise or a magical writing style. Most followed a similar tune (melancholy or celebration) but that did not bother me much.\n\nThis is one of the poems:\n\n\"I crossed valley, plain and river, and the singing made me sad.\"\n\nAnd then there's some that look like this (it sounds way better in Spanish):\n\n\"Although he goes at your side,\n\nlike a twin cherry of burnished red,\n\nwhen sin puts its mark on you,\n\nhe abandons your body and gathers up your soul.\"\n\nI'm going to give this 3 stars just because I didn't enjoy the content matter much and I don't think it was something that I loved, but I also don't think it was bad, it was just somewhere in the middle.\n\nAugust 23, 2016\n\nOverall, I preferred Langston Hughes' translation though I can't give any examples to show why. I did like the accompanying woodcut illustrations by Antonio Frasconi that this volume included.\n\nMay 15, 2015\n\nI did not like the early poetry of Gabriela Mistral, although it is evidently much beloved in Chile. Way too overwrought and sentimental for my taste.\n\nBut in her middle years she found a voice that resonated with me. She moves out into the world with ideas and imagery that connect nature and the spiritual with the personal. Birds and flowers, water and sky, frame her words and thoughts.\n\nThis parallels her own journey from local teacher to world traveler and diplomat working for children, traditional cultures, the dispossessed, peace.\n\nDeath makes a frequent appearance. She sees the world's trials and sorrow.\n\n\"Here the path breaks it,\n\nhere breezes lift it,\n\nwind flurries toss it,\n\nand something I don't know\n\nhurls it to earth again.\"\n\nAlways, Mistral noted the mysteries of life.\n\nBorn in 1889, Gabriela Mistral won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1945. 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of that award.\n\nThis edition of her selected poems also contains wonderful woodcuts by Antonio Frasconi and text in both Spanish and English.\n\nShelved as 'xx-dnf-skim-reference'\n\nJune 18, 2016\n\nSome reviews for this on GR are for a different edition, and some editions seem to be much different. ISBN 0801812569 and 080181197X are both in my edition, by Johns Hopkins Press, the coppery-brownish cover. This one does have facing-page translations, 3 pre-faces, and a few illustrations by Frasconi. The translator, Dana, explains why translations cannot do the poet justice, and so, since I do not read Spanish, I decided only to skim the book.\n\nI do quite like \"The Other\" which begins:\n\n\"I killed one of me,\n\none I did not love.\n\nShe was the flame\n\nof mountain cactus.\n\nShe was drought and fire,\n\nthirstless.\"\n\nI also like that the 'index' is a list of the poems as sorted by \"themes.\" Not sure I agree with the interpretation thereof, but it's a help.\n\nJune 6, 2015\n\nTo get lost in her poetry is to spend time in paradise. Dame La Mano, what love poems should be.\n\nAugust 11, 2016\n\nمنذ عشرين عاما وفي صدري\n\nوقد شقّ بخنجر\n\nوضع بيت شِعر هائل ، متطاول\n\nكالموجة الشاسعة في البحر\n\n[image error]\n\nMay 10, 2022\n\nI finished this sensational selection of poetry last night and have been trying to decide how to review it. I decided the best way is to just quote a couple of the poems. I knew this was going to be a good book when I read this opening poem titled \"The Strong Woman\":\n\nI remember your face, set deep in my days,\n\nwoman of the blue skirt and sunburnt forehead,\n\nwhom I saw in my childhood, in my land of ambrosia,\n\nbreak the black furrow open in fiery April.\n\nIn the tavern, lifting the vile cup and drinking deep,\n\nwas the man who fixed a child to your white breast;\n\nand under the searing brand of that memory\n\nthe seed slipped from your hand, serene.\n\nIn January I watched you reap your child's wheat,\n\nand not understanding, kept watching you\n\nwith eyes widened by both tears and wonder.\n\nAnd even now I'd kiss the mud on your feet,\n\nfor among a hundred city women, I've never seen your face,\n\nand still I follow your shadow in the furrows with my song.\n\nAnother poem that I thought was outstanding is one I think most mothers would agree with titled \"Let Him Not Grow Up\":\n\nMay my little boy\n\nstay just as he is.\n\nHe didn't suck my milk\n\nin order to grow up.\n\nA child's not an oak\n\nor a ceiba tree.\n\nPoplars, meadow grasses,\n\nthings like that grow tall.\n\nMy little boy\n\ncan stay a mallow-flower.\n\nHe has all he needs,\n\nlaughter, frowns, skills,\n\nairs and graces.\n\nHe doesn't need to grow.\n\nIf he grows they'll all come\n\nwinking at him,\n\nworthless women\n\nmaking him shameless,\n\nor all the big boys\n\nthat come by the house.\n\nLet my little boy\n\nsee no monsters coming.\n\nMay his five summers\n\nbe all he knows.\n\nJust as he is\n\nhe can dance and be happy.\n\nMay his birthdays fit\n\nin the length of a yardstick,\n\nall his Easters\n\nand his Christmas Eves.\n\nSilly women\n\ndon't cry. Listen:\n\nthe Sun and the stones\n\nare born and don't grow,\n\nthey never get older,\n\nthey last forever.\n\nIn the sheep fold\n\nkids and lambs\n\ngrow up and die:\n\nbe damned to them!\n\nO my Lord, stop him,\n\nmake him stop growing!\n\nStop him and save him,\n\ndon't let my son die!\n\nJune 16, 2024\n\nGabriela Mistral found inspiration in the beauty of nature, the laughter of children, the history of her native Chile, feminist struggle, and most of all in grief. The mournfulness of her poetry is arresting, trapped by the anguished cry in her soul, and liberated by her lyrical verse.\n\nFor a Nobel Prize in Literature laureate writing in Spanish, the sparsity of her poetry in English translation is dumbfounded. Ursula K. Le Guin's bilingual collection \"Selected Poems of Gabriela Mistral\" is a rare gem, bringing to light a poet whose literary output is world class par excellence. With 164 poems, this is one of the largest anthologies of her work in the English language to date. Be it the changing time or fashion, or the predominant disinterest in poetry in the English-speaking world, it is difficult to see how this author ended up in partial obscurity a century after the publication of her first book.\n\nLe Guin chose a few poems from \"Desolation\" (1922), a collection that is dominated by the emotions felt by a young woman who has lost her only love through death. The love poetry here is a deep sigh of loss, of unfulfilled dreams and emotions that never found birth into reality. The same anguish persists in many poems from \"Tenderness\" (1924), though here we also find her at her happiest, especially in the songs targeted towards children. An educator by profession, Mistral understood well the necessities of a young heart. Nature also starts shining in her verses, and akin to the ancient people of South America, she strives for the symbiosis between the natural and spiritual world. Nature's moods mimic those of the pulsating soul breathing in the poet's mind. As a river, this theme flows into the poems from \"Clearcut\" (1938), which take the man's cruelty into the suffering of the nature. The horror of wars trembles with terror in the souls of her heroines, either recounting their personal tragedies, or the painful history of Latin America. We never leave that anguished voice, angry with God and man by the time we get to the poems from \"Winepress\" (1954), a collection sombre in its grief at the suicide of her only (adopted) son. It is impossible to ignore the soulfulness of \"Anniversary\", in which a mother's love breaks down into exasperation.\n\nSelections from her symbolist epic \"Poem of Chile\" (published posthumously in 1967), and four unpublished works complete this edition. The closing poem \"Electra in the Fog\" is a surprising discovery, for it embodies Gabriela Mistral's mastery, both as an erudite poet, but also one which celebrated feminist concerns in literature, and foremost one that treasured the deep bond between mother and child.\n\nLe Guin's translation (at her own admission) stays away from the strict replication of rhyme and meter. Instead, the translator focused on the melody of Mistral's poetry, a feat which she achieved with excellence. As readers, we find ourselves taken by the hand to listen to a poet's song, that, although mournful, it exalts our souls.\n\nFebruary 20, 2016\n\n\"Ni por juego digas\n\no exageración\n\nque nos separamos\n\ntierra y mar, que son:\n\nella, sueño y él\n\nalucinación\"\n\nNovember 19, 2018\n\nMistral is a magnificent poet but very difficult to translate into English. Le Guin has done an amazing job of compiling such a diverse assortment of Mistral's poems, and should be commended for making them available in the one place. But the translations themselves don't always work, and I found myself shocked at times by Le Guin's flat interpretations of Mistral's short, condensed lines. The decision to cram both Spanish and English versions on the same page was also unfortunate.\n\nJanuary 15, 2023\n\nThere is a consistent longing and a dreadful potency in Mistral's poetry that comforts the soul and startles the mind and yet for me it felt somehow distant and unreachable. I think, however, that if I ever become pregnant I just might be able to understand it.\n\nLong live the queen mother of Chilean letters!\n\nAugust 5, 2011\n\nMistral creates vivid characters out of anything: a country, an orchard, the sea, the thin air. These characters tend to tell a quiet, everyday tale where the revelations of more romantic poets would be unnecessary. Mistral is a more reserved Whitman, ready to praise everything but not quite as willing to let it all out at once. While at times her purpose is almost lost in the ebb of her conversational verses, the strong sense that the world operates for a positive purpose is never lost.\n\nFavorite poems:\n\nWe Were All Going To Be Queens\n\nEpilogue: The Last Tree\n\n--\n\nI shall leave what I had\n\nof ash and firmament,\n\nmy flank full of speech\n\nand my flank full of silence;\n\nthe loneliness I gave myself,\n\nthe loneliness they gave me,\n\nand the tithe I paid the lightning\n\nof my gentle, severe God.\n\n(From \"The Last Tree\")\n\nJuly 3, 2008\n\nI fell in love with a translation of \"She with a Missing Finger\" when I stumbled upon it in the 1962 volume of the Hudson Review. I had to read more. Gabriela Mistral was a wonderful talent, underappreciated and undertranslated.\n\nNovember 26, 2016\n\nloved this poet - I wish that I could have read Spanish to be able to appreciate the original text.\n\nAble to to convey such depth of feeling and also able to paint an entire landscape.\n\ndefinitely added to my list of favorite poets!\n\nDecember 22, 2017\n\nUna obra poética llena de simbolismos, que sabe a campo, a agricultores, a tierra mojada, a corcho de vino, muy propia de su forma conservadora pero a la vez progresista de ver la vida, de enseñar y de aprender de Gabriela Mistral, sobre todo muy Latinoamericana.\n\nMay 6, 2024\n\nThere is a stark contrast between the first half of this book, featuring poems Mistral wrote early in her life from 1922 to 1938, and the second half, which is the collection Winepress from 1954. The first poems are a bit more hopeful, despite their topics of despair and death, and deal with a search for God – in short, not the kind of poetry that connects with me. But after winning the Nobel Prize in 1945 and experiencing the Spanish Civil War, World War II, and the deaths of several friends (according to the introduction in this collection), Mistral’s poetry becomes more focused on reflections on pain, suffering, and death. The opening line of the first poem is a stark declaration:\n\nI killed one in me:\n\none I did not love.\n\n(Another translation, not in this edition, reads: “I killed a woman in me …”)\n\nAlthough death and nature did appear as themes in her early work, the expressions in these later poems are less of a search and more of a lament, eulogy, or remembrance; less openly speaking of God and more grounded in images of the natural world, even if the verse retains a sense of the spiritual. And when she does describe prayer, as in “The Liana,” it is more connected to nature, and rooted (pardon the pun, as you will see) in death: “My prayer is, and I am not. / It grows, and I perish. / I have only my hard breath, / my reason and my madness. / I cling to the vine of my prayer. / I tend it at the root / of the stalk of night.” Her prayer is her poem, taking root in the decay of her old (perished) self, cultivated in the dark night of twentieth-century suffering.\n\nMistral uses fewer words and more direct images in these later poems, and I love them far more than her early work. I feel her later two books contain the stronger lyrics.\n\nSeptember 19, 2021\n\nReview of Winepress, included in Selected Poems\n\nGabriela Mistral, Chile’s religious, conservative counterpart to the more radical Pablo Neruda … is what I thought before actually reading any of her poetry. On reading this, a selection from her last complete collection, I find poetry that is rather elemental, grief-stricken and unearthly. Published in 1954, nine years after winning the Nobel Prize and three years before her death, Le Guin explains in her introduction that Mistral foregrounded the title of the collection in an earlier poem. “In death’s wide winepress,” Mistral wrote, “still you will not trample out my breast!”, evoking the crush of mortality, the squeeze of blood-purple juices. It is a fittingly visceral, vital image for a death-lurking collection that is nonetheless filled with the defiance of that final exclamation mark.

No conocía a la autora, para seros realistas. Pero buscando y viendo la repercusión que realizó esta mujer, no dudé en incorporarla en mi reto personal.\n\nMistral recibió el Premio Nobel de Literatura en 1945. Fue la primera mujer iberoamericana y la segunda persona latinoamericana en recibir un Premio Nobel.\n\nPor supuesto sus poemas me han gustado, y esta edición es maravillosa, con esas solapas tan coloridas.\n\n«Enseñar siempre: en el patio y en la calle como en la sala de clase. Enseñar con actitud, el gesto y la palabra».\n\nMarch 19, 2018\n\nUrsula is fiercely independent in her translations, what I can make of it, most easily identified for me is the removal of exclamation. She (according to Le Guin herself and my view of a small sample on poetry foundation) favors a more quiet, weird interpretation which I like a lot, in contrast to other translators who forced meter and/or rhyme and disproportionately accentuated the motherly tone on the work. Le Guin has no problems removing \"recalcitrant\" poems from completed collections, a hatchet job on Desolación. She includes the originals which is wonderful, and useful to understand the meter and rhyme if you have enough sense of Spanish to attempt pronunciation if not comprehension.\n\nJanuary 21, 2023\n\nMistral’s poems themselves were amazing (though some tested my Spanish), and on their own they merit five stars. However, Le Guin’s translations often left me flat, as they often overlooked, misrepresented, or outright changed some pretty key structures, words, and contexts. I admire her efforts, and if they were her own poems, they would be good and occasionally great, but the English translations show the very real limits of poems translated by somebody who didn’t speak the language (as Le Guin herself noted).\n\nMistral’s poems: 5 stars\n\nLe Guin’s translations: 2 stars\n\nMarch 24, 2022\n\nMesmerizing in Mistral's capacity to render complex emotions so evocatively, from the thrill and jealousy of passionate love to profound grief, the quiet celebrations of living and the compassionate eye toward suffering. This book contains selections from all four of her publications, which spanned several continents. I can see why her poems for children are so widely popular among Latin American schools and look forward to introducing them to my own children."
