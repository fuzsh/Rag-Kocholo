        "text": "CLAS Seed Grant Nobel Laureate, Gabriela Mistral, was more than just a simple Chilean poet during the 19th and 20th century; in addition to writing, she played an active role in the development of Mexican and Chilean educational systems, the League of Nations, and held the role of Chilean consul. For her services as a poet-diplomat, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1945, making her the first recipient from Latin America. She has become a canonical figure in Latin American Literature and history, as well as an icon of LGBT rights.\n\nCurrently the National Library of Chile is developing a digitalized archive, and is expected to be completed by the summer of 2014. Elizabeth Horan, Professor, Department of English is leading a four-week Summer Seminar along with David William Foster, Regents Professor, School of International Letters and Cultures and Gary Francisco Keller, Regents Professor and Director, Hispanic Research Center to gain a new understanding of Latin America. Horan states, “These archives are of transnational importance; they reveal how poets and artists, educators and politicians have worked with and between the governments of Chile and Mexico, and international organizations such as the League of Nations, the United Nations, and the Organization of American States.” Horan recently traveled to Chile to help promote her new book on Mistral, present her research at two conferences, and establish connections for the upcoming seminar."
