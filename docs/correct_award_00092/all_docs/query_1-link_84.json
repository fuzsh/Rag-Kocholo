        "text": "The Nobel Prize in Literature 1945\n\nGabriela Mistral\n\n(Lucila Godoy y Alcayaga)\n\n\"for her lyric poetry which, inspired by powerful emotions, has made\n\nChile (1889--1957) her name a symbol of the idealistic aspirations of the entire Latin\n\nAmerican world\"\n\nGabriela Mistral was the first Latin American woman to win a Nobel Prize in Literature. She was born in Vicuña in northern Chile\n\nin 1889. Her parents were Petronila Alcayaga, a school teacher of Basque descent and Jeronimo Godoy Alcayaga Villanueva, a\n\nvagabond poet and school teacher of Indian and Jewish ancestry. Mistral's birth name was Lucila Godoy Alcayaga. Lucila and her\n\nolder sister Emelina were raised in Montegrande by their mother after the father deserted them when Lucila was three years old.\n\nAt the age of nine, Lucila started attending school, but did so for only three years. At school she discovered her love of poetry and\n\nstarted writing her own poems. She also assumed the name Gabriela Mistral. She continued her education at home with the help\n\nof her sister who was a teacher and who encouraged Gabriela to become a teacher as well. At age sixteen she moved to La Cantera to take a job and fell in love with a young railway worker. The relationhip didn't last and two years later the young man committed suicide. The only item found in his posession was a postcard from Mistral. This affected her deeply and she wrote Sonetas de la Muerte (Sonnets of Death) to express her feelings.\n\nIn 1918, she was appointed director of a secondary school for girls located in rural Punta Arenas. The rough terrain of Punta\n\nArenas became an inspiration for a series of poems entitled Patagonian Landscapes. In 1922 Mistral accepted the invitation of\n\nJose Vasconcelos, the Mexican minister of education, to start educational programs for the poor in Mexico. She introduced mobile\n\nlibraries to rural areas to make access to literature easier for everyone. Later, she edited a book of poetry and prose entitled\n\nReadings for Women. In addition, she traveled to other countries to study their methods of teaching. In 1923, Mistral was\n\nawarded the title \"Teacher of the Nation\" by her own government.\n\nIn 1922, she published the first volume of her collected poems entitled Desolacion (Desolation). In it she expressed her feelings\n\ntoward pain and death. Ternura (Tenderness), published in 1925, was a collection of poetry for children which celebrated the joys\n\nof birth and motherhood. Her later collections were Questions (1930) and Tala (1938). She also wrote fables and continued\n\npublishing in periodicals. The dominant themes in her poetry were love, death, childhood, maternity, religion and the beauty of\n\nnature and of her native land. She also had a burning desire for justice."
