        "text": "Gabriela Mistral (Chile 1889-1957 United States) was the first Latin American writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, in 1945. Famous for her poetry for children and her career as a rural teacher, Mistral was also an outstanding intellectual. This lecture offers an insight of some of the most significant moments of her life and to follows her path from her literary beginnings to her consecration as Chilean poet and a personality recognized in Latin America and abroad. In this context, this lecture also addresses her performance as an intellectual woman who participated in public discussions and left her mark in the Latin American history.\n\nIn this seminar, we will focus on the figure and literary career of Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral (1889-1957). We will examine the historical, political, and cultural context in which the first recipient of the Nobel Prize for literature from Latin America lived and wrote. Throughout her texts, we will analyze the way in which Mistral managed to open a space for women in the Latin American intelligentsia of the first half of the Twentieth century, in the context of a strong gender exclusion. We will analyze aspects such as religiosity, indigenismo, labor, motherhood, education, and feminism. Moreover, through her journeys around the world, Mistral established friendships and intellectual networks with important Latin American writers such as Victoria Ocampo, Alfonso Reyes, Ciro Alegría, Pablo Neruda and Cecília Meireles, which it was part of her Americanista project. Thus, we will study how through Mistral's life and work, the main topics, problems, and debates of her time were articulated. This seminar will be conducted in Spanish.\n\nThe Chilean poet, educator, and Nobel laureate Gabriela Mistral (1889 ‐1957) is an example of a Latin American queer intellectual who was instrumental in instituting sexual and racial normativity through nationalist discourse. This article expands the scope of the inquiry into Mistral’s sexual identity by examining her status as “race woman,” a public position that she fiercely claimed, as opposed to any public nonnormative sexual stance. 1 Within the Latin American public, Mistral upheld the heterosexual matrix. But was her queerness completely out of public view? Certainly, Mistral alluded to reproductive sexuality every time she spoke of race. She consistently portrayed herself as the spokesperson of Latin America—which she referred to as “our race” [nuestra raza]— posing as the mixed-race mother of the nation. Mistral devoted many prose pieces to the subject of a Latin American unified culture achieved through individual and social reproduction. Well known for her defense of the indigenous peoples of Latin America, she frequently and vigorously alluded to the process of mestizaje. Through the stance of race woman Mistral aided the state in managing Latin America’s racially heterogeneous populations, regarded as a problem since the Wars of Independence. Both publicly and privately she addressed topics ranging from the classification and hierarchical ordering of racial “mixings” to the status of black Latin Americans in nationalist discourse, from desirable mestizaje in the Latin American territory to dangerous mestizaje beyond the watchful purview of the state. It is tempting to separate Mistral’s sexual and racial identities, envisioning one as private and the other as public, one secret and the other on strident display. Typically, the quandary of a subject such as Mistral is to be analyzed one identity at a time. The story of her romantic life is separated from the story of her public career, even as her public figure unfolds in accordance with the narrative of repub\n\nThis study reveals the strategies behind Gabriela Mistral's literary and consular activities in Brazil during the two and a half year period leading up to that nation's declaring war against the Axis (Germany and Italy) in August of 1942. Mistral's allies within Itamaraty helped make her a public representative of anti-fascism during this time. They facilitated the translation and publication of her work in Brazil, and her addresses to the Brazilian academies and contacts with other writers, where the Chilean writer shows a clear understanding of Brazil's importance to the war's outcome. At the same time as Mistral's wartime discourse in Brazil decisively influenced her successful Nobel Prize candidacy, her correspondence registers her increasingly acute estrangement from Chile, including strained relations with Pedro Aguirre Cerda amid her grave concern for Chile's wartime foreign policy. To counter the atmosphere of mistrust and the documented insecurity of her wartime correspondence, Gabriela Mistral systematically expanded her already immense social network. She moved from the fishbowl or Río to the stronghold of Petrópolis, where she made her homes into way-stations for debriefing anti-fascist travelers in the circuit to and from Washington D.C. In all, during Mistral's residence in Brazil she served multiple masters and uniquely bridged otherwise non-overlapping, outlying nodes of writer-diplomats, war refugees, translators, performers, and more.\n\nAbstract As John Stephens asserts in “Retelling stories across time and cultures”, few retellings are a simple replica of the previous textual layer on which they rely. Shaped by well-known stories, her social and feminist preoccupations and her preferred textual mode, poetry, Mistral subverts four cautionary tales. In this article I engage in a comparative reading of Gabriela Mistral’s poetic retellings of Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. These poetic appropriations were composed between 1924 and 1928, revealing Mistral’s avant guard understanding of children’s rights and, particularly, girls’ undermined position in society. I contend that far from a romanticized idea of childhood, Mistral’s poems reproach child labor, adult neglect, abuse and abandonment, revealing the poet’s ethics of care and radical understanding of children’s status, especially that of Latin American girls’ in early XXth century. Besides, by exposing previous layers of orality, by changing the narrative mode into poetry, by revealing the multilayered cultural compost on which these retellings depend, Mistral appropriates these tales to make them culturally relevant for Latin American girlhoods.
