        "text": "As the United States waged war against Filipino insurgents, the British writer and poet Rudyard Kipling urged the Americans to take up “the white man’s burden.”\n\nTake up the White Man’s burden—\n\nSend forth the best ye breed—\n\nGo send your sons to exile\n\nTo serve your captives’ need\n\nTo wait in heavy harness\n\nOn fluttered folk and wild—\n\nYour new-caught, sullen peoples,\n\nHalf devil and half child\n\nTake up the White Man’s burden\n\nIn patience to abide\n\nTo veil the threat of terror\n\nAnd check the show of pride;\n\nBy open speech and simple\n\nAn hundred times made plain\n\nTo seek another’s profit\n\nAnd work another’s gain\n\nTake up the White Man’s burden—\n\nAnd reap his old reward:\n\nThe blame of those ye better\n\nThe hate of those ye guard—\n\nThe cry of hosts ye humour\n\n(Ah slowly) to the light:\n\n“Why brought ye us from bondage,\n\n“Our loved Egyptian night?”\n\nTake up the White Man’s burden-\n\nHave done with childish days-\n\nThe lightly proffered laurel,\n\nThe easy, ungrudged praise.\n\nComes now, to search your manhood\n\nThrough all the thankless years,\n\nCold-edged with dear-bought wisdom,\n\nThe judgment of your peers!\n\nSource: Rudyard Kipling, “The White Man’s Burden,” Literature (February 4, 1890), 115."
