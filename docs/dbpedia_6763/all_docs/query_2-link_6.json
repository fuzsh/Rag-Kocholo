        "text": "By Mishall Bhathena\n\nIn 1907, Rudyard Kipling was awarded the Noble Prize for his “power of observation, originality of imagination, virility of ideas, and remarkable talent for narration.” His work, ‘The Eyes of Asia’, which was published over a decade later, is a testament to this statement. But it wasn’t meant to be ‘imaginative’.\n\nIn 1916, Kipling was approached by the British Intelligence Department in the midst of the First World War to essentially write something to convince people in Britain and abroad of the value of the British war effort and, more specifically, the use of Indians at the front, considering India was Britain’s most valuable colony at the time. Thus came together ‘The\n\nEyes of Asia’, a collection of four letters that Kipling wrote and published in 1917, in which he pretended to ventriloquize the voice of the Indian sepoy on the front lines of the war and gave his interpretation of what he thought the sepoys experienced during the war.\n\nA reading of the work today, especially from a post-colonial Indian mindset like mine, shows a number of blaring moments within the text where Kipling clearly did not choose to show the experience of the soldier and instead wanted to prove a sense of colonialism and orientalism through the work. It served a greater purpose than simply being his version of what he thought happened during the war; it was a form of propaganda for the thousands of people that read it. It furthered colonial stereotypes and a classically British interpretation of how they thought Indians would have behaved.\n\nOne that comes across as almost comedic is the experience that one of the narrators has on his first visit to London. Kipling unnecessarily exoticizes the character of Bishen Singh, the narrator. Although the rest of his writing seems to rival that of most great writers of English, it is amusing to see the words in his text that Kipling thought an Indian would falter at. From descriptions of St. Paul’s Cathedral as a “temple”, although most Indians were well exposed to Christianity due to its status as a colony, to the almost out of nowhere references to caste within Britain itself, Bishen seemingly messes up the fundamental spellings of common English words like “baronness” and “earl”, while still perfectly using “extol” or “countenance”, with no issue at all. Santanu Das, a researcher on the experiences of Indians in the First World War, describes this as “infantilization” of the Indian sepoy, a common occurrence within writings on the sepoys by white officers during the First World War.\n\nThe most interesting part is that there exists a collection of letters, actually written by Indian soldiers, that was published by David Omissi near the start of the 21 st century. These letters are not only valuable historical resources, but they also come from the very same collection\n\nof letters that Kipling used as inspiration while he wrote the book. Their true value is seen when they are compared to Kipling’s work, and then any reader can clearly see the parts of Kipling’s writing that were fabricated for vested interests. Kipling, who considered himself “Hindustani”, having been born in India to greatly privileged white parents, used his text to portray a version of his ideal sepoy. A man who fought a war with reverence for ‘his king’,” was obsessed with caste and religion, had a childlike understanding of English, was almost obsessed with a war that was not even his to fight, and had a fascination with only certain aspects of the West that the government approved of, like the Underground and agriculture, while still professing a sense of minority in comparison to his colonial overlords, who have reached an almost unachievable sense of greatness in comparison to India and those who live within it.\n\nOmissi’s letters painted a completely different picture of a sepoy who did not want his loved ones nor himself to join the war and acknowledged the value of certain Western aspects, but not in a sense of reverence but in a sense of wanting to add them to his own life back home. Like when they were exposed to the normalised education of women, one soldier writes to his grandfather, saying, “You ought to educate your girls as well as your boys, and our posterity will be the better for it”. This sentiment was not one that was special, but one that is seen in numerous different letters by Sepoys. Omissi’s sepoys show little to none of the exoticization and infantilization that are common throughout Kipling’s work.\n\nKipling today is a rather controversial figure, having become well known even today for another one of his exoticizing works, The Jungle Book. But, post-World War 1, Kipling’s legacy has been called into question a number of times, with one writer even calling him “the bard of empire”, but India seems to want to continue its connection with Kipling. In 2019, it came out that the government was spending close to the equivalent of £1 million to restore Kipling’s house in Mumbai, while hundreds of homes across Mumbai older than his are being ignored. In a period of time where statues are being torn down for colonial legacies, this raises a valuable question: should Kipling and his legacy be continued, or should we treat him as a coloniser alone?\n\nLike any other contentious part of history, it is useless to completely stop talking about Kipling. It is essential to acknowledge that he did in fact exist, that he did write beautiful pieces of literature, and that he was a classical part of the Anglo-Indian experience in the 19th and 20th centuries. But it is essential to simultaneously acknowledge the racism, orientalism, and colonialism he perpetuated through all his work, and it should be a requirement for readers of his work and him to be made aware of this, simply to prevent history from repeating itself as it often does. Kipling’s anti-Indian propaganda is simply another valuable indicator of Britain’s colonial past and the millions of people affected by it.\n\nBibliography:\n\nMulk Raj Anand, Across the Black Waters (New Delhi, 2011).\n\nShrabani Basu, ‘“The Story of 1.5 Million Soldiers That Served in WW1 Has Been Forgotten over the Years”’, South Asia@LSE, (2018).\n\nGail Braybon, Evidence, History and the Great War: Historians and the Impact of 1914-18 (2008).\n\nOrmonde Maddock Dalton, The Waddesdon Bequest : Jewels, Plate, and Other Works of Art Bequeathed by Baron Ferdinand Rothschild (London, 1927).\n\nS.
