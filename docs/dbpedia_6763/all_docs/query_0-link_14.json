        "text": "Born in British India in 1865, Rudyard Kipling was educated in England before returning to India in 1882, where his father was a museum director and authority on Indian arts and crafts. Thus Kipling was thoroughly immersed in Indian culture: by 1890 he had published in English about 80 stories and ballads previously unknown outside India. As a result of financial misfortune, from 1892-96 he and his wife, the daughter of an American publisher, lived in Vermont, where he wrote the two Jungle Books. After returning to England, he published “The White Man’s Burden” in 1899, an appeal to the United States to assume the task of developing the Philippines, recently won in the Spanish-American War. As a writer, Kipling perhaps lived too long: by the time of his death in 1936, he had come to be reviled as the poet of British imperialism, though being regarded as a beloved children’s book author. Today he might yet gain appreciation as a transmitter of Indian culture to the West.\n\nWhat is it today’s reader finds so repugnant about Kipling’s poem? If you were a citizen of a colonized territory, how would you respond to Kipling?\n\nTake up the White Man’s burden–\n\nSend forth the best ye breed–\n\nGo bind your sons to exile\n\nTo serve your captives’ need;\n\nTo wait in heavy harness,\n\nOn fluttered folk and wild–\n\nYour new-caught, sullen peoples,\n\nHalf-devil and half-child.\n\nTake up the White Man’s burden–\n\nIn patience to abide,\n\nTo veil the threat of terror\n\nAnd check the show of pride;\n\nBy open speech and simple,\n\nAn hundred times made plain\n\nTo seek another’s profit,\n\nAnd work another’s gain.\n\nTake up the White Man’s burden–\n\nThe savage wars of peace–\n\nFill full the mouth of Famine\n\nAnd bid the sickness cease;\n\nAnd when your goal is nearest\n\nThe end for others sought,\n\nWatch sloth and heathen Folly\n\nBring all your hopes to nought.\n\nTake up the White Man’s burden–\n\nNo tawdry rule of kings,\n\nBut toil of serf and sweeper–\n\nThe tale of common things.\n\nThe ports ye shall not enter,\n\nThe roads ye shall not tread,\n\nGo mark them with your living,\n\nAnd mark them with your dead.\n\nTake up the White Man’s burden–\n\nAnd reap his old reward:\n\nThe blame of those ye better,\n\nThe hate of those ye guard–\n\nThe cry of hosts ye humour\n\n(Ah, slowly!) toward the light:–\n\n“Why brought he us from bondage,\n\nOur loved Egyptian night?”\n\nTake up the White Man’s burden–\n\nYe dare not stoop to less–\n\nNor call too loud on Freedom\n\nTo cloke (1) your weariness;\n\nBy all ye cry or whisper,\n\nBy all ye leave or do,\n\nThe silent, sullen peoples\n\nShall weigh your gods and you.\n\nTake up the White Man’s burden–\n\nHave done with childish days–\n\nThe lightly proferred laurel, (2)\n\nThe easy, ungrudged praise.\n\nComes now, to search your manhood\n\nThrough all the thankless years\n\nCold, edged with dear-bought wisdom,\n\nThe judgment of your peers!\n\n(1) Cloak, cover.\n\n(2) Since the days of Classical Greece, a laurel wreath has been a symbolic victory prize.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\nThis is an excerpt from Reading About the World, Volume 2, edited by Paul Brians, Mary Gallwey, Douglas Hughes, Azfar Hussain, Richard Law, Michael Myers, Michael Neville, Roger Schlesinger, Alice Spitzer, and Susan Swan and published by Harcourt Brace Custom Books.The reader was created for use in the World Civilization course at Washington State University, but material on this page may be used for educational purposes by permission of the editor-in-chief:\n\nPaul Brians\n\nDepartment of English\n\nWashington State University\n\nPullman 99164-5020\n\nThis is just a sample of Reading About the World, Volume 2.\n\nReading About the World is now out of print.
