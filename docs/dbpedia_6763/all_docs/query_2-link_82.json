        "meta_description": "Rudyard Kipling and Winston Churchill both covered the Boer War as newspaper correspondents, working respectively for the Friend of the Free State and the Morning Post, and in later days, both authors looked back on the Boer War in their autobiographies. Kipling devoted a chapter of his autobiography Something of Myself to his experience of the war, while Churchill described his adventures, including his spectacular escape from a Boer prison in My Early Years. Kipling also devoted several short stories to the subject, two of which (“A Sahib’s War” and “The Captive”, both published in Traffics and Discoveries in 1904) offer an interesting complement to his autobiographical account. Kipling and Churchill witnessed the war in fairly similar conditions, observing the fighting at close range and enjoying friendly contact with British soldiers. Yet this common experience resulted in opposite visions and discourse: Churchill presented the Boers as loyal enemies, to be fought but respected. Kipling, on the contrary, saw them as treacherous guerrillas who deserved due punishment, and he heavily emphasized the threat they represented to the British Empire.

        "text": "4Kipling and Churchill witnessed the war in fairly similar conditions, observing the fighting at close range and enjoying friendly contact with British soldiers. Yet this common experience resulted in different visions and discourses: Churchill basically presented the Boers as loyal enemies, to be fought but respected. Kipling, on the contrary, saw them as traitors who deserved due punishment, and he heavily emphasized the threat they represented to the British Empire.\n\n5The purpose of this article is to study the information these texts provide on the Boer War, but also to analyse these conflicting accounts of a single event to see how diverging ideological discourses can be elaborated through the sifting—and sometimes distortion—of historical facts.\n\n6The Boer War broke out in October 1899, but it had been growing increasingly inevitable since the breakdown of negotiations between Paul Kruger, President of the Transvaal, and the Cape Colony governor, Alfred Milner, at the conference of Bloemfontein in May. Britain had been trying to expand the domination of its Cape colony ever since the 1860s, when diamonds were discovered in Kimberley. After the first Boer War, the Transvaal had been declared an independent Republic. The discovery of gold in 1866 made the British all the more eager to reassert their domination on this area. Their main justification was the unfair way in which the uitlanders, including British settlers, were treated by the Boers, who taxed their profits while denying them civil rights.\n\n7The first concrete attempt was the Jameson Raid of December 1895, when Dr Leander Starr Jameson, with a force of 500 men, crossed the border of British Bechuanaland to support an uitlander uprising in Johannesburg. Although the raid failed and was officially disapproved of by the British government, it gave the Boer republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State an excuse for arming heavily, in response to which the British reinforced their military presence in the area. This growing tension resulted in an ultimatum issued by Paul Kruger on October 9, 1899, ordering the British to withdraw all their troops from the border of Transvaal within 48 hours, failing which war would be declared.\n\n8In London, Kruger’s ultimatum was greeted derisively. For the British government, this was just one more colonial outbreak, which would be duly crushed in a matter of weeks. Winston Churchill recalls that, as he sailed to South Africa, his fear and that of senior officers was that the war would be over by the time they reached the country:\n\nThe general opinion among the staff was that it would all be over before they got there. Some of our best officers were on board, and they simply could not conceive how “irregular, amateur” forces like the Boers could make any impression against disciplined professional soldiers. If the Boers broke into Natal, they would immediately come up against General Penn Symonds. [. . .] The fear of the Staff was that such a shock would so discomfort them that they would never again try conclusions with regular forces. All this was very disheartening, and I did not wonder that Sir Redvers Buller often looked so glum. (MEL, p. 246)\n\n9The unfolding of the war, however, belied his fears. From October to December 1899, the British suffered severe military losses at the hands of the Boers. The towns of Mafeking, Kimberley and Ladysmith were besieged as early as October 1899. A few months later, the British suffered three successive defeats at Stormberg, Magersfontein and Colenso during the Black Week of December 1899.\n\n10The situation changed in early 1900 with the appointment, on January 10, of Lord Roberts as Commander in Chief, in replacement of Sir Redvers Buller. Despite some further setbacks at Spion Kop (23–24–25 January 1900) and Vaal Krantz (5–6–7 Frebruary 1900), British troops managed several decisive victories, such as Paardeberg in February 1900 and the relief of Mafeking in April of the same year, before the capture of Pretoria on June 5, 1900.\n\n11At that stage, most people believed the war to be over. President Kruger fled to Europe, and Lord Roberts went back to England, leaving Lord Kitchener as Commander in Chief. However, the London Government refused to negotiate with the Boers, demanding their complete surrender. According to Winston Churchill:\n\nThis was a mistake destined to cost us dear. There were still many thousands of wild, fierce, dauntless men under leaders like Botha, Smuts, De Wet, De la Rey and Herzog who now fought on in their vast country not for victory, but for honour. (MEL, p. 368)\n\n12The apparent victory therefore turned out to be in fact only the beginning of a new phase of the war. Lord Roberts had redeployed most troops, leaving contingents of inferior quality. Boer commandos then resorted to guerrilla warfare, and systematically re-occupied any place left by the British after it had been supposedly pacified. This prompted the British to develop a counter-strategy, which involved burning down Boer farms to prevent the civilian population from providing shelter and weapons for the fighters. The people thus deprived of their home and sustenance were then gathered in what came to be known as “concentration camps”. This policy enabled the British to gradually gain a lasting hold on the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, finally leading to the Peace of Vereeniging in May 1902.\n\n13Both Kipling and Churchill’s direct experience of the conflict was limited in time. Churchill was sent to South Africa before the war was even declared: “The Boer ultimatum had not ticked out on the tape machines for an hour before Oliver Borthwick came to offer me an appointment as principal War Correspondent of the Morning Post.” (MEL, p. 244) He sailed on October 11th 1899, arriving on the 31st of the same month, and left the country after the capture of Pretoria in June 1900.\n\n14Kipling’s contact with South Africa was in a way more protracted, since he wintered there every year from 1900 to 1907. This means that, contrary to Churchill, he had time to witness both the second phase of the war and the effects of the peace of Vereeniging. But his experience was both less continuous and less direct. His time on the staff of the Friend of the Free State only lasted from March 21st to April 1st 1900, and his visits to the front stopped after the battle of Kari Siding in March 1900. However, this does not mean he lost all interest in the conflict and its aftermath. His bitterness about the Peace of Vereenigin is obvious in Something of Myself:\n\nAt long last, we were left apologizing to a deeply-indignant people, whom we had been nursing and doctoring for a year or two; and who now expected and received all manner of free gifts and appliances for the farming they never practiced. We put them in a position to uphold and expand their primitive lust for racial domination, and thanked God we were “rid of a knave”. (SoM, p. 124)\n\n15Besides, it was probably not a coincidence that Kipling left the country for good shortly after the Liberal Government granted self-government to the Republic of Transvaal.\n\n16The authors’ experience differed not only in length but in nature. Churchill took part in the war as a man of action. Although he had come as a war correspondent, he became directly involved in the fight when he helped rescue a train under attack on November 15th 1899. The operation itself was a mitigated success: the engine, with some of the troops, managed to escape, but the rest, including Churchill, were captured by the Boers. He therefore spent the next three months as a prisoner of war before he managed to escape. After his return to freedom, he joined the South African Light Horse as a Lieutenant, thus unusually combining the functions of war correspondent and fighting officer. In this capacity, he took part in the battle of Spion Kop and the relief of Ladysmith, as well as the capture of Pretoria.\n\n7 David Gilmour, The Long Recessional—The Imperial Life of Rudyard Kipling, NY, Farrar, Straus and Gi (...)\n\nIn that same week, the creator of Mulvaney was driven in a cart with a fellow journalist to watch his first battle, an inconclusive skirmish at Karee [sic] Siding, a few miles north of Bloemfontein. Although hoping for a reasonably quiet picnic, they came under fire when British cavalry drifted in their direction and attracted the enemy’s attention.\n\n18This statement ought to be somewhat qualified. The battle was the first time Kipling saw soldiers under fire, and he was much better acquainted with the army’s fighting and living conditions in South Africa than he was in India. But it is true that Kipling himself does little to contradict this impression. He introduces the episode with the words: “So there had to be a battle [. . .]” (SoM, p. 118) and makes no allusion to any other attempt to go to the front.\n\n19This discrepancy in actual experience may explain the difference in length between the two accounts. Churchill’s version spreads over ten chapters and 210 pages, while Kipling hastens over the event in a dozen or so pages. The reason might be that for Churchill, autobiography—largely based on the despatches he had sent as a war correspondent—was the main means of expression on the subject. For Kipling on the contrary, Something of Myself was little more than a complement to the fiction and poetry he had written at the time, and a way to justify himself after undergoing much criticism about his jingoistic attitude.\n\n20Yet setting aside this difference, both autobiographies can be said to obey similar narrative strategies. Written some thirty years after the facts, these texts fulfil a twofold and somewhat contradictory logic of narration and analysis. On the one hand, the authors strive to make the war as vivid as possible to readers remote in time and space. To achieve this, they resort to devices largely borrowed from fiction.\n\n21The crucial episode in Churchill’s biography is probably his defense of the armoured train attacked between Escourt and Colenso, followed by his capture by the Boers and his subsequent escape from the prison of the State Model Schools in Pretoria. This was of course detrimental to his status as a war correspondent, as he was away from the scene of action for a month, from mid-November to Christmas 1899, a period which included the Black Week. Yet he turns the episode to his advantage by becoming the hero of his own adventures, related in a way which owes much in structure to the thriller, and in tone to the novel of adventure. Admittedly, Churchill ruins the suspense of his own story by revealing, as soon as he mentions his capture, that he eventually escaped. Yet the tale remains an effective page-turner, as the reader wonders how, alone in enemy territory, on foot and with no money to speak of, he will manage to reach safety. We eagerly follow his progress as he escapes from the prison, secretly jumps on board an enemy train at night, then finds shelter in a British colliery where he is forced to hide down a mineshaft, before one last ride as a stowaway on a Boer train brings him to Lourenço Marques, in Portuguese East Africa, out of reach of the enemy.\n\n22Kipling has little such heroism to boast of, but he effectively banks on his role as external observer to emphasize the mind-boggling dimension of the war. Using strict internal focalisation, he tells things exactly as he saw them, or rather as he failed to see them. Both fighting sides remain invisible and are only identified through the sound of their respective weapons. The issue of the battle of Kari Siding is evoked in a few paratactic sentences:\n\nThen to the left, almost under us, a small piece of hanging woodland filled and fumed with our shrapnel much as a man’s moustache fills with cigarette-smoke. It was most impressive and lasted for quite twenty minutes. Then silence; then a movement of men and horses from our side up the slope, and the hangar our guns had been hammering spat steady fire at them. More Boer ponies on more skylines; a flurry of pom-poms on the right and a little frieze of far-off meek-tailed ponies, already out of rifle range.\n\n“Maffeesh,” said the correspondent, and fell to writing on his knee. “We shifted ’em” (SoM, p. 121)\n\n23The incongruous dimension of the war is aptly rendered through the unexpected metaphor of the smoke-filled moustache. The battle is a series of disconnected actions, whose authors are barely identified by the pronouns “our” or “them”. Kipling, renouncing for once his role as omniscient narrator, leaves the other correspondent to draw the inconclusive conclusion that the enemy has been “shifted” (rather than beaten or forced to retreat).\n\n24Representing the enemy, both in terms of actual description and in terms of ideological discourse, was indeed one of the most problematic aspects of a war involving so few pitched battles. Boer soldiers are physically absent from Something of Myself, except for the elusive figures mentioned earlier, nor do they appear in “A Sahibs’ War”. This may be due to the very limited time Kipling spent on the front line. Churchill, on the other hand, came into direct contact with the enemy several times, including the moment of his capture, and is more precise in his evocation:\n\nMy mind retains its impression of these tall figures, full of energy, clad in dark, flapping clothes with slouch-storm driven hats, poising on their levelled rifles hardly a hundred yards away. (MEL, p. 265)\n\n25Even the definition of the enemy is problematic. For Churchill, it was clearly limited to Boer commandoes. These also appear in Kipling’s works, including Something of Myself (“Each commando had its own reputation in the field, and the grizzlier their beards the greater our respect”, SoM p. 123). But they only play a very minor part, and clearly in his eyes, the real foe was the double-dealing farmer who, protected by his oath of neutrality, gave shelter to fighters and hid weapons under the thatch of his roof, when he did not wait himself for a suitable opportunity to shoot unwary Englishmen. This makes for a contradictory representation of the enemy, where the respect due to white men and the admiration for the Boers’ fighting skills contend with the contempt for an enemy who does not respect the rules of traditional warfare and is therefore seen as a traitor.\n\n26To take the full measure of this ambiguous discourse, it is interesting to compare the same situation as it is presented in Something of Myself, “A Sahibs’ War” and My Early Life. In Something of Myself, Kipling and his companions stop at a farm:\n\nAt last, we came to a lone farmhouse, in a vale adorned with no less than five white flags. [. . .] Here,’ said my guide and guardian, “we get out and walk. Our driver will wait for us at the farmhouse.” But the driver loudly objected. “No, sar. They shoot. They shoot me.” “But they are white-flagged all over,” we said. “Yes, sar. That’s why”, was his answer [. . .] (SoM, p. 119)\n\n27Despite the suspicious impression created by the superfluity of white flags, and its contradiction with the drivers’ fear, nothing happens. The little group of Englishmen come and go unhurt without, it seems, meeting anyone.\n\n28The same episode appears in “A Sahibs’ War”, where it is however spiced up for dramatic effect. The disposition of the house is the same, as is the initial situation of Englishmen stopping at a farmhouse which has sworn neutrality. From this starting point, Kipling gets much more precise than in Something of Myself. Umr Singh and Kurban Sahib, the main characters of “A Sahibs’ War” actually meet the inhabitants of the house, who are all physically monstrous:\n\nThere was an old man in the verandah—an old man with a white beard and a wart upon the left side of his neck; and a fat woman with the eyes of a swine and the jowl of a swine; and a tall young man deprived of understanding. His head was hairless, no larger than an orange, and the pits of his nostrils were eaten away by a disease. He laughed and slavered and sported sportively before Kurban Sahib. (“ASW”, p. 97)\n\n29The Boers’ personality matches their physical appearance, and the whole scene is carefully built up to enhance their betrayal. The three characters (an old man, an idiot child, and a woman) are obvious non-combatants. They give the visitors a warm welcome: “The man brought coffee and the woman showed us purwanas from three General-Sahibs, certifying that they were people of peace and goodwill” (“ASW”, p. 97). The shock is all the greater when the visitors get shot at, as soon as their backs are turned: “He [the old man] stood in the verandah firing swiftly with a gun, the woman beside him and the idiot also—both with guns.” (“ASW”, p. 98). The ideological message, merely hinted at in Something of Myself, is here clearly spelt out: the Boers use weapons even when they are not soldiers, they break their oaths of neutrality, they sham kindness to lure visitors into a trap, they fire at people who do not threaten them and, worst of all, they shoot the enemy in the back. This is contrasted with the fair play of the English Kurban Sahib: “He did not cover the old man or the fat woman with his rifle. That was not his custom.” (“ASW”, p. 98).\n\n30Churchill makes a general allusion to situations of this kind:\n\nThis long-drawn struggle bred shocking evils. The roving enemy wore no uniforms of their own; they mingled with the population, lodged out and were succoured in farmhouses whose owners had taken the oath of neutrality, and sprang into being, now here now there, to make some formidable and bloody attack upon an unwary column or isolated post. (MEL, p. 369)\n\n31On the whole, his account tallies with Kipling: the Boers had no respect for the rules of traditional warfare since the civilians broke their oath of neutrality, while the soldiers did not wear uniforms and tended to act by surprise. However, Churchill is careful to limit his statement to the last phase of the war. He admits that Boer farmers provided illegal help to their own side, but he makes no allusion to either farmers or commandos threatening civilians, their actions being always directed at British troops.\n\n32More than Kipling, Churchill is also ready to pay homage to the abnegation and courage of the enemy, taking the Boer general Louis Botha as his example:\n\nHe had entered the invasion of Natal as a burgher; his own disapproval of the war had excluded him from any high command at its outset. This was his first action. But as a simple private burgher serving in the ranks he had galloped on ahead and in front of the whole Boer force in the ardour of pursuit. (MEL, p. 268)\n\nI had enough military law to know that a civilian in a half uniform who has taken an active and prominent part in a fight, even if he has not fired a single shot himself, is liable to be shot at once by drumhead court-martial. None of the armies in the Great War would have wasted ten minutes upon the business. [. . .] I need really never have been alarmed. The Boers were the most humane people where white men were concerned. Kaffirs were a different story, but to the Boer mind the destruction of a single white man’s life, even in war, was a lamentable and shocking event. (p. 272)\n\n34The contradiction in the representation of the enemy can in fact partly be solved by taking into account the respective dates on which these texts were written. “A Sahibs’ War”, was published in 1904, when Kipling’s feelings rankled with the Peace of Vereeniging. The evocation of the Boers is therefore much darker than in Something of Myself, which was written thirty-four years later.\n\n35Something of Myself and My Early Life share the characteristic of having been written after WWI, and this considerably modifies the vision of both the war and the enemy, since Kipling and Churchill, while endeavouring to give the reader the illusion that the war is taking place before his eyes, consciously and explicitly work their knowledge of later events into the text. One recurrent scene in both autobiographies is that of the author meeting his former Boer foes—which have become today’s friends since the Boer Republics, with some predatory view on German South West Africa, decided to fight on Britain’s side in WWI—on a perfectly equal and amiable footing during social occasions, and reminiscing on the Boer War as an almost pleasant common memory. For Kipling, this is the occasion of giving the Boers credit for fighting skills which the military authorities of 1914 completely lacked:\n\nI had the felicity of meeting Smuts as a British General, at the Ritz during the Great War. Meditating on things seen and suffered, he said that being hunted about the veldt on a pony made a man think quickly, and that perhaps Mr Balfour (as he was then) would have been better for the same experience. (SoM, p. 123)\n\n36Churchill exploits the comic potential of the situation when he remembers introducing Louis Botha, the former Boer general, now Prime Minister of Transvaal, to his mother during the Imperial Conference of 1906. Louis Botha, who had been responsible for Churchill’s capture after the armoured train episode, merely remarked: “He and I have been out in all weathers” (MEL, p. 268).\n\n37The intervention of WWI not only modified the representation of the enemy, but that of the war. Churchill’s evocation of the conflict is thus pervaded with a sense of adventure, an idea that things were not so much dangerous as exciting:\n\nWe lived in great comfort in the open air, with cool nights and bright sunshine, with plenty of meat, chicken and beer. [. . .] Altogether there was an air of grace and amenity about this war singularly lacking fifteen years later on the Western front. (MEL, p. 333–336)\n\n38Representing the enemy was not the only problem of the Boer War. It also challenged the representation of one’s own side. The fact that the Boers were not as easily defeated as expected gave cause for reflection, and the theme of the lesson to be learnt is recurrent throughout Kipling’s texts on the subject. The expression is used just as explicitly by Churchill: “Let us learn our lessons. Never, never, never believe any war will be smooth and easy, or that anyone who embarks on that strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter” (MEL, p. 216).\n\n39Churchill blames the general bungling of the war on the fact that Britain was completely unprepared for any serious conflict: “The British War Office of those days was the product of two generations of consistent House of Commons Parsimony, unbroken by any serious call” (MEL, p. 245), and that same idea underlies not only Kipling’s vision in Something of Myself, but also one of his most famous poems, “The Islanders”, published in 1902.\n\n40Churchill was very vocal about the military mistakes of the war, and in particular the incompetence of Sir Redvers Buller. He thus contends that the heaviest defeats could, for the most part, have been avoided, while some victories could have been won much earlier than they actually were, as for instance the relief of Ladysmith:\n\nThe conquest of this hill would render the Boer position around Colenso untenable, and would open the passage to the river. This was a sound and indeed fairly obvious plan, and there was indeed no reason why it should not have been followed from the very beginning. Buller had not happened to think of it before. (MEL, p. 336)\n\n41Kipling, though not so well acquainted with the finer points of military tactics, had on the other hand an acute perception of the material problems of the war, witnessed during his long stays in the Cape, which included for instance numerous visits to military hospitals. Though he was curiously lenient on the question of concentration camps, which he defended as a manifestation of British generosity in sheltering the enemy, he was otherwise bitterly critical on the way the war was administered. He pointed out that the greatest number of casualties was due not to battles, but to disease (“Our own utter carelessness, officialdom and ignorance were responsible for much of the death rate”, SoM p. 116), and he saw this mismanagement as a heavy British responsibility not only towards their troops, but towards the whole country they were fighting in (“And remember that, till we planted disease, the vast sun-baked land was antiseptic and sterilized—so much so that a clean abdominal Mauser-wound often entailed no more than a week of abstention from solid food”, SoM p. 117).\n\n42For all this criticism, classic tales of British heroism are not absent. Churchill pays due homage to the courage of the troops, even in defeat as in the case of Spion Kop:\n\nHere we learned that after General Woodgate had been killed, Colonel Thorneycroft had been placed in command of all the troops on the summit and was fighting desperately. [. . .] The white flag had already gone up once and the Boers had advanced to take the surrender of several companies, but Thorneycroft had arrived in a fury, had beaten down the flag, and heavy firing had been resumed at close quarters by both sides. (MEL, p. 326)\n\n43Kipling’s subject is not so much courage in battle, as the less visible forms of heroism ranging from the abnegation of the Tommy who goes out to war leaving all his loved ones behind with no hope of a glorious future to look forward to when he comes back, to the comradeship between soldiers who save each other’s lives or assist their neighbour in his last moments, or wounded men bearing physical pain without complaint.\n\n44It is interesting to notice that in Kipling’s case, the traditional rhetoric of heroism is transferred from British soldiers to those coming from the colonies. “A Sahibs’ War” is a case in point. Kurban Sahib, the Englishman, is the perfect gentleman soldier, patriotic and chivalrous. But he dies, shot by the Boers, without having committed any noteworthy act of bravery.\n\n45The real hero of the story is in fact Umr Singh, his Punjabi servant. He is cunning, astute, faithfully devoted to his master and not overburdened by scruples about taking human life, qualities which are repeatedly presented as far more useful, in the present context, than Kurban Sahib’s somewhat outdated ideals. Australian troops also play a prominent part in “A Sahibs’ War”, and Umr Singh describes them as “Dark, tall men, most excellent horsemen, hot and angry, waging war as war, and drinking tea as a sandhill drinks water” (“ASW”, p. 94).\n\n46“A Sahibs’ War” stands apart among Kipling short stories as possibly the only one where the English do not have the upper hand. Kurban Sahib, for all his gentlemanly behaviour, is killed quite early on, and his revenge is entirely in the hands of people from the colonies or the newly created dominions. The crafty Umr Singh achieves, with the sole help of Sikandar Khan, the capture of the Boer farm. He does not himself deal justice to the inhabitants because this is a white men’s war, but this is promptly done by the fearless Australians, who appear as the true Sahibs of the title.\n\nThe racial twist of the Dutch [. . .] was to exploit everything they could which was being done for them, to put every obstacle in the way of any sort of development, and to take all the cash they could squeeze out of it. (SoM, p. 113)\n\n48The Boers were not only the prodigal sons of Empire, they were a threat to its unity, indeed to its very existence: should their revolt be successful, it might entice other colonies to get rid of British domination. This is stated in “A Sahibs’ War”: “It is for Hind that the Sahibs are fighting this war. Ye cannot in one place rule and in another bear service. Either ye must everywhere rule or everywhere obey” (“ASW”, p. 90). Interestingly enough, Kipling does not write this argument in his own name, but puts it in the mouth of the Punjabi Umr Singh, as if the cause of Empire was so obviously just in this war that even colonized people were ready to take it up of their own accord.\n\n49Kipling was also keenly aware of the religious, cultural and material problems raised by colonial participation in the Boer War. One problem which comes up in both Something of Myself and “A Sahibs’ War” is the food problem linked to religious restrictions. Kipling remarks in Something of Myself:\n\nIn this same ghost-train an Indian officer’s servant (Muhammedan) was worried on a point of conscience. “Would this Government-issued tin of bully-beef be lawful food for a Muslim?” I told him that, when Islam wars with unbelievers, the Koran permits reasonable latitude of ceremonial obligations; and he need not hesitate. (SoM, p. 114)\n\n50This experience also served as material for an episode of “A Sahibs’ War”, when Umr Singh remarks:\n\nI have eaten from the same dish as Sikandar Khan—beef too, for aught I know! He said, on the night he stole some swine’s flesh in a tin from a mess-tent, that in his Book, the Koran, it is written that whoso engages in a holy war is freed from obligations. (“ASW”, p. 93)\n\n51If the Boer War was a threat to the Empire, it was also, paradoxically, the first time when colonies and new dominions fought alongside England. Though Kipling’s story is entitled “A Sahibs’ War”, it is almost entirely about the feelings of solidarity which spring up between colonized people, overcoming religious, social and geographical barriers as they fight against a common enemy. Umr Singh first deeply resents the presence of the Pathan Sikandar Khan, before finally relenting: “But the man said truly, ‘We be far from our homes and both servants of the Raj. Make truce till we see the Indus again’” (“ASW”, p. 93). Never once, though, do these colonized people see the Boer War as an attempt to crush the effort of brethren fighting for independence.\n\n52The representation of the Boer War is thus fraught with contradictions and ambiguities. Guerrilla warfare imposed new modes of representation shifting away from the battle scene, and induced a heavy emphasis on treachery. Yet the usual association of allies and enemies with good and evil was also deeply challenged, as Churchill paid homage to the enemy, while the jingoistic Kipling proved bitterly critical of the British handling of the war. For all these changes, certain traditional topoi remain, such as the scene of the regiment holding out unto the last in front of the enemy, used by Churchill in his evocation of Spion Kop.\n\n53Above all, the confrontation of these different texts show how both authors could have different perspectives on, or even conflicting views, of this single event. Moreover, their respective opinions and modes of narration also varied considerably in time. This might be due to historical events: the First World War, for instance, turned the Boer War from the first guerrilla war into the “last war of the gentlemen”. It might also be connected with their situation during the war: Churchill had to heavily self-censor the tale of his escape in his despatches, so as to protect the people who had helped his flight. Writing about it thirty years later, he had no such restriction and his tale is, as a result, considerably more detailed.\n\n54But most interesting is to notice how thinly drawn the line is between fact and fiction. Kipling attributes his own experience to invented characters, while Churchill structures the tale of his flight in My Early Life, very much like a Rider Haggard story. This, of course, challenges our relationship to the text, and in particular the temptation to consider the autobiographical accounts of eye-witnesses as reliable historical documents while fiction should be relegated to the field of imagination and entertainment. Both Kipling and Churchill leave the reader to pick his way among narratives which, misleading though they may be, prove all the richer for their ever shifting light."
