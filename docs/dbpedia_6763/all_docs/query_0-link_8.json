        "text": "Joseph Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936) was a prolific writer and journalist who wrote extensively about India. He was born in Bombay in 1865, and sent to England to study at age five, away from his parents. He returned to India in 1882, and lived with his family at Lahore for several years. There he began working as a reporter for the Lahore-based newspaper, the Civil & Military Gazette. He also began writing and publishing poems and stories, at first collaboratively with other family members (especially his sister, Alice), and then eventually under his own independent signature. Between 1886 and 1888, Rudyard Kipling published a large number of short stories and poems related to Anglo-Indian life. He left India in 1889, but continued to write about India while living first in the United States and then in England. Several books published over the course of the next decade, including The Jungle Book and Kim, would become extremely influential depictions of everyday life in India during the British Raj.\n\nWritings by Rudyard Kipling on this site:\n\nEchoes (1884; collaborative volume with 32 poems by Rudyard Kipling)\n\nQuartette (1885; collaborative volume with numerous contributions from Rudyard Kipling)\n\nDepartmental Ditties (1886)\n\nPlain Tales from the Hills (1887; collaborative volume with short stories by Rudyard Kipling and Alice Kipling)\n\nSoldiers Three (1888; A.J.
