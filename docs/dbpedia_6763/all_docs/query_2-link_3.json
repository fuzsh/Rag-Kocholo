        "text": "His relationship with India is rooted in profound love. Kipling so describes India through the voice of Kim: “A fair land — a most beautiful land is this of Hind — and the land of the Five Rivers is fairer than all…” and today scholars have finally taken a less emotive approach and Kipling is now recognised as one of the most authentic voices of the life and character of the British Empire, Empire being an historical fact and not a political view.\n\nKipling wrote to Margaret Burne-Jones : “When you write ‘native,’ who do you mean? The Mahommedan who hates the Hindu; the Hindu who hates the Mahommedan; the Sikh who loathes both; or the semi-anglicised product of our Indian colleges who is hated and despised by Sikh, Hindu and Mahommedan...”. I challenge any expat who has lived in a non-western country to admit he has not been reflecting on stereotypes such as ‘native’ and “non-native” and to admit he has not been undergoing reflections on cultural differences and what means being us or they, what is the impact of our presence in their land, etc…\n\nIn a poem by Kipling:\n\nWE AND THEY\n\nAll good people agree,\n\nAnd all good people say,\n\nAll nice people, like Us, are We\n\nAnd every one else is They:\n\nBut if you cross over the sea,\n\nInstead of over the way,\n\nYou may end by (think of it!) looking on We\n\nAs only a sort of They!'\n\nKipling was born in India and was raised mainly by Indian servants, to the degree that he had to be reminded to speak English when in the presence of his parents. His work has the evocative power it has because he decided to use many fragments of the Indian language, simply because as any expats know, he couldn’t have done otherwise. Certain things must be expressed necessarily in one language, or they will lose their flavour and their meaning will be washed out and allowed to faint away.\n\nHe drew his universe of flavours, smells, noises and sounds not only from the recollections of the time spent with his Indian ayah, the word for nanny that is still used even in Kenya, but also from his young years in Bombay and Lahore where he used to visit opium dens, bazaars and gambling houses, absorbing the chaotic life of the city. India was intense and captivating. In his words \"the heat and smells of oil and spices and puffs of temple incense, and sweat, and darkness, and dirt and lust and cruelty, and, above all, things wonderful and fascinating innumerable.\" Nowhere in his writing we perceive he wishes of seeing India or south Africa, where he will spend long periods later, or anywhere else changing their traditions, religions, and culture. He obviously had his own culture, as any of us, and might have not fully understood or subscribed all that the foreign ones entailed, but that didn’t mean he ever advocated for a conversion or transformation of those lands and their people. In his words again: Indians \"should be allowed to enjoy the practical benefits of the Raj peace and justice, quinine and canals, railways and vaccinations without having to submit to Western notions on education and religion.\"\n\nThis aspect makes his writing all the more interesting to me and I believe it can give a much deeper insight into what being a traveller, an expat or a full time settler in other countries means. It also brings to light what being curious, respectful and understanding of traditions and customs it’s all about, in a much more meaningful way than the sugar-coated propaganda I often hear in westerner’s rhetoric speeches about these topics, with their banned words, because they might conjure monsters of the past we want to forget have even existed, and their forced appreciation, turned into a dogma you must abide to in order to be considered non-racist.\n\nSo, I encourage you to go back to reading the works of Kipling with an open mind and an open heart and to visit and honour his ashes that are buried in Westminster Abbey in Poets' Corner next to the graves of Thomas Hardy and Charles Dickens with no fear or shame to be learning from a man who wasn’t perfect, who lived his life in his times, not ours, and has known cultural diversity from within.\n\nhttps://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/batemans"
