        "text": "Rudyard Kipling is buried in 'Poets' Corner', Westminster Abbey, London, England. He lies next to Charles Dickens.\n\nBurial Stone of Rudyard Kipling\n\nPhotograph by Mike Reed\n\nKipling was born in Bombay in India and enjoyed an idyllic and spoilt childhood. However, at the age of six his parents sent him and his sister to school in England and they lodged at a house in Southsea with a uncaring woman who they were forced to call 'Auntie Rosa'. One of Auntie Rosa's many punishments was to stop Kipling reading (his first love) and as a result he took to reading in bad light which seriously exacerbated his short sightedness.\n\nAfter attending the United Services College, Westward Ho! he returned to India (Lahore) where he worked as a journalist. He soon began to get poems and stories published in the newspaper and these were later collected in the form of Departmental Ditties (1886) and Plain Tales from the Hills (1888).\n\nKipling was a considerable poet who had a good ear for colloquial speech - as evidenced in poems such as Tommy and Danny Deever. His poetry was very popular with the general reading public and he was seen by many as the unofficial poet laureate. His perceived association with British imperialism has, recently, led to a decline in his reputation. However, his poems If and The Way Through the Woods are regularly voted among the nation's favourite verse.\n\nKipling's son John was killed at the Battle of Loos in the First World War, but his body and grave were never clearly identified - which left Kipling with a terrible sense of uncertainty."
