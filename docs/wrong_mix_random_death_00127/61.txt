I am looking for any information on Julia Ann Gardener.She would be my 4th Great Grandmother.All that I have on her is the following:

Parents:?

Born:January 16, 1842

Place:?

Died:September 3, 1921

Place:?

Married:1854

Place:Minnesota

Spouse:Benjamin Franklin Young

Children:Sarah Ann Young. I don't have anyone else, and I'm sure there are more.Sara was born 9-18-1855 in Florence, MN.

I have so many doubts about the dates that I do have.If correct, she would have married when she was 12 and had Sarah when she was 13.Benjamin, her husband was born in 1818, that would have made him 35 when they married, 24 years her senior.Supposedly, he is a descendant of Touch-The-Clouds and Blue Bird.I have a paper from the US Dept of the Interior that lists the genealogy from Touch-the-Clouds to my Great Grandmother.

I would be more than willing to share what little information that I have.

Thank you,

Brandi Jones
