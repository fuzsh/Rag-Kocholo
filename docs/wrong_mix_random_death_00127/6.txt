Notes for Dorothea Groth

Teacher who graduated from Platteville Normal School. May not have ever taught. Her obituary, which appeared in the Winona Daily News on May 28, 1956 (p. 13) says she suffered a long illness before dying at Winona General Hospital. It indicates she had lived at Huron, South Dakota, before moving to Winona in 1909.
