        "text": "Historical context\n\nThe American Revolution was a political movement and war that eventually led to American independence from Great Britain. As colonies of Britain, America paid taxes but did not have representation in British government. In 1765, colonists protested the Stamp Act, which they viewed as unfair taxation. Protests escalated in the 1770s, and the British government imposed new legislation that limited the colonies' self-governance. Within three years, the colonies established a Continental Congress, went to war with Britain, and declared independence. The war ended in 1781 with Britain's surrender to American forces at Yorktown.\n\nCulturally relevant pedagogy considerations\n\nIn many ways, the American Revolution can feel foreign to modern students. The distance of time combined with the socio-political changes in our communities can make this event feel distant. Consider how concept-based inquiry questions can help students draw connections between themselves and historical actors who are in many ways very different from them. Challenge yourself to explain exactly why this event from the past matters to students today, not just in terms of why it should matter but a compelling argument that connects with what students believe does matter. Concepts like power, justice, fairness, and more can help draw connections between what students believe to be important and how this history influences the way we define those concepts today.\n\nClassroom ready resources\n\nThe Boston Massacre (Upper Elementary School)"
