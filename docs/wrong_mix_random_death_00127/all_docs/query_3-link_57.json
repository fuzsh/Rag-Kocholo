I trace my ancestry as follows: Benjamin Franklin, was the father of Littleberry Franklin, who was the father of Allen Franklin, who was the father of Avery Franklin, who was the father of Asa Franklin, who was the father of my father George Avery Franklin. In previous research Brent Holcomb said that Benjamins father could have been Thomas Franklin, but since there were three Thomas's within the area, he didn't want to make a guess.Are there descendants of either Benjamin Franklin or Ephraim Franklin. Who can help me with the name of their father ? Any help will be deeply appreciated.\n\nMy 4grandfather was Benjamin Franklin, a farmer in Edgefield County, South Carolina. I'm aware of his descendants, down through George Avery Franklin ( my father ), but I wish to establish the name of Benjamin's father.Was it Thomas Franklin? What was the maiden name of his mother? Also who were some of Benjamin's other children? Benjamin's son was Littleberry (Berry) Franklin. Berry was the father of Rev.Allen Franklin who was the father of Avery B. Franklin, who was the father of Asa Calhoun Franklin,who was my grandfather. Any help appreciated. Also, who were the children of Benjamin other than Berry ?\n\nNeil M. Franklin Rowena Franklin was born around 1790-1795 in North Carolina and married William Bayless probably around 1810-1815. Their children were: Josiah Franklin born 1818, in Alabama, Hiram Montgomery Franklin about 1819, Mariah Elizabeth Franklin about 1820, Samuel Lewis Franklin about 1823, Mary Jane Franklin about 1827. I believe her husband William Franklin died in 1828 and she moved with the family to Arkansas, then Missouri and later Kansas where she died in 1881. Her father may have been Josiah Franklin. Would appreciate any info on this family line. Thank You. Nancy Weaver Robert Franklin, born about 1810 in New York, married Jane Elliot or Margaret Elliot of the River Clyde in England.

Hilary Westin I am researching Franklins from Crawford County, Illinois, Vigo and Sullivan Counties in Indiana, and we believe (but no proof yet) Hopkins County, Kentucky. Seeking Emory Earl Franklin (born 17 Oct 1896; died 10 Feb 1951). His father was George Franklin (born 31 Aug 1865; died 10 Jun 1939) George's father was John R. Franklin (born 1828; died 12 Jan 1888). We have proof thus far for our Franklin line, including spouses and children. We believe Johns father was James P. Franklin born in Kentucky (possibly Hopkins) and think he was married to a Rebecca Jackson. This is theory, not proven.

Deborah Scheibly (Franklin) Our most wanted Franklins are the parents of Thomas Powell Franklin. We have a lot of info on Thomas P. Franklin and his wife, but very little on his parents. Thomas P. Franklin married Dolly Maria Scott on 27 May 1858 in Campbell County, Virginia.\n\nOn the marriage certificate, Thomas gave his place of birth as Ohio and fathers name as Henry Franklin.

(email address good until June, 2003) Marsha Sneed-Folks I am searching for any information on the parents and/or siblings of Thomas Franklin. He was born in Virginia in 1806 (taken from Mercer County Cemetery Book). I know he spent much of his life in Tennessee and Missouri. I have record of his marriage on 15 Dec 1824 to Eliza Mulvaney in Knox County, Tennessee. He is in the Sevier County Tennessee. census until 1850. All of his children were born in Tennessee. John, Thomas, Hannah, William, Sarah, Payne \"Mack\", and finally, Utitia and Isaac (twins).\n\nAbout 1855, the family moved to Princeton, Mercer County, Missouri. Thomas died there 16 Jul 1870. His wife, Eliza, died there on 4 Mar 1893.\n\nThe names Thomas and John appear often in the family line. My great-grandfather was Payne \"Mack\" Franklin.

The family was said to have resided in Tioga County, New York prior to moving to Allen County, Ohio. I can find no evidence of Thomas in Tioga County, New York, nor Tioga County, Pennsylvania. Children of Thomas and Hannah are: Eli Franklin, born 1802 New York; Clarissa Franklin, born 1805 New York, married George Russsell and resided in Wayne Coounty, Indiana; John Henry Franklin, born 1810 New York, married Sarah Chenoweth; James Franklin, born 1812, married Sarah Hanthorn; Thomas Franklin, born 1815, married Rebecca ______ ; William Franklin, born 1817, married Lidia ______ ; Elisha Franklin, born 1820, married Mary J. ______; Joseph Franklin, born 1822, married Sydney ______; Harriett Franklin, born 1823, married Samuel Russell; David Franklin, born 1825, married Malinda Meeks, residing in Madison County, Indiana, then to Kansas. Tami R. Sherrill I am searching for the parents and sibling of Synthia Franklin. She married Moses Oliver Walters probably in Rankin County, Mississippi in 1850. She died about 1860. She was the mother of Henry Craig Walters, Sarah J. Walters, Earle Walters and Frank V. Walters. Claudia Doggett Benjamin Franklin, son of William Franklin and Hannah Eveness, was baptized at Ramsgate, Kent, England, on 15 Aug 1819. He came to Tasmania, Australia, as a convict in 1844 and married another convict, Margaret Sullivan. They then moved to Victoria, Australia and raised their family there.\n\nIn the IGI there appears to be eight siblings all baptized in Kent. I have not done any research further back than this.\n\nHilary Franklin My end-of-line Franklin is Singleton Franklin. He was born in Georgia in 1792, married Candace Temple in Hancock County, Georgia, in 1817.\n\nThey apparently had six children: a girl born about 1818; a girl born about 1820/1821; a boy born about 1823; Alex H. Franklin, born about 1827; Lucius Franklin, born Nov 1828; Ann Franklin, born 1835.\n\nAll were born in Hancock County, Georgia. Candace died before 1847/48, when Singleton moved with the three youngest children, Alex, Lucius and Ann, to Marion County, Georgia, where he is listed in the 1850 census, then to Neshoba County, Mississippi, where he is listed in the 1860 census.\n\nIts Singleton's son Lucius (Quintus) Cincinnatus who is my ancestor. I would love to find out more about all of his siblings. I can't find any records before the marriage in 1817 for Singleton. Any information would be greatly appreciated!\n\nDiana Gunnarson Searching for Mary/Mara Franklin who married William B. DaVall, Sr. on 19 Dec 1744 in Southold, Suffolk County, New York. Their children were: Willliam DaVall, Jr., Samuel DaVall (married Hannah), PhinehasDaVall (married Jemima Howell) and Jemima DaVall (married Mr. Jessup). Florence Norback I am trying to confirm the parentage of William John Franklin, born 17 Feb 1858; died 18 Feb 1931 Ontario, Canada. He married 8 Nov 1876 to Annie Lavina Doughty, born 18 Dec 1863; died 21 Feb 1914 Ontario, Canada. They had 20 children: Frederick, William, James, Hannah, Daniel, Annie, George, Martha, Charles, Susanna, Albert, Percy, Hattie, Lillie, Stanley, Herbert, Laura, Ethel, Ernest and Ralph. His parents may have been Benjamin Franklin and Mary Ann Turner. Any information would be appreciated. Willow Brown I am looking for the parents of Col. Edward L. Franklin, who served in World War I. He was born in Albany, N.Y. in 1884. The death certificate only gives his mother's maiden name as Rogers, there is no first name. His father's name is John. I believe he had a sister named Marjorie. Other relatives include a Rev. Roger G. Franklin and an Alice Franklin, but I'm not sure how they are related. It is my understanding that the family was there for quite awhile. Any help would be appreciated. Kathy Morley I am seeking information on the following Alabama Franklin families which I feel may be related in some way:\n\n1) Willson and Temperance Tempy (Straughn) Franklin of Covington County, Alabama. Willson born about 1780 South Carolina or Georgia, died about 1836 Loango, Alabama, wife Tempy born about 1788 North Carolina or South Carolina, died about 1868 Loango, Alabama. Children, all born in Loango, Covington County, Alabama: William H. Franklin, born 1823, died 1896; James Wilson Franklin, born Oct 1825, died between 1900 and 1910; John A. Franklin, born 1827, died 1909; Serena T. Franklin, born 1830, died after 1910; and Green T. Franklin, born 1832, died 1901.\n\n2) Josiah L. and Mary (Farmer) Franklin of Butler and Covington counties, Alabama. Josiah born about 1794, Georgia, wife Mary born about 1796, Georgia. Children: Josiah Franklin, born about 1825; Unity Ann Franklin, born about 1827; Sarah Ann Franklin, born about 1829; Thomas Jefferson Franklin, born Mar 1832, died 1904; Martha Ann Franklin, born 1833, died 1914; and Mary Farmer Franklin, born 1839, died 1914. Lisa R. Franklin My earliest Franklin ancestor is James R. Franklin, born about 1822 in North Carolina, according to the census. He married Margaret Ann Morris, born about 1826 in Tennessee.\n\nAssuming that they may have married in her birthplace, the only county in Tennessee with both Franklins and Morrises is Sumner County. There is a young James living next to a William on the 1840 Sumner County, Tennessee census. Dont know if this is the same as James R. Franklin.\n\nTheir first child, a boy, was named William Franklin. Their next sons were named James Marion Franklin, Sherrod Franklin, and Nathanial Franklin. Their daughters were named Mary Franklin, Nancy Franklin and Martha Franklin. I descend through their son James Marion Franklin. William was killed in the Civil War and was not married.\n\nThe Franklin trail seems to be from North Carolina to Tennessee in the 1840s, through Georgia to Mississippi by 1853. James R. and Margaret were last found on the Winston County, Mississippi census in 1860, but not on the 1870 census. James Marion Franklin, their son, lived in Mississippi, Texas and died in Oklahoma. Thanks, Nancy Hamilton Martin Franklin, born about 1830 in County Tipperary, or County Limerick, Ireland; died 1906, Minnesota. He married Bridget Kirby, born about 1835, Ireland, location unknown.\n\nChildren:\n\n1) John Franklin, born 1862 Pennsylvania; died 1943 Minneapolis, Minnesota. He married Annie Maher, daughter of Pat and Ann (ORourke) Maher.\n\n2) George Franklin, born 1865, Pennsylvania, died 1906, Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\n3) Ellen Franklin, born 1867, Goodhue County, Minnesota. She married Edward OConnor.\n\n4) [female infant], born 1870, died during childbirth with mother, Goodhue County, Minnesota\n\nPatrick Maher, born about 1836 in Ireland. He married Ann ORourke (born about 1838 in Ireland.)\n\nChildren:\n\n1) Ann Annie P. Maher, born 1868, Goodhue County, Minnesota; died 1949, Minneapolis, Minnesota. She married John Franklin (see above)\n\n2) Katherine Maher, born 1858 Wisconsin, married David W. Franklin, Goodhue County, Minnesota\n\n3) William Maher\n\n4) John Maher\n\n5) Lizzie [Elizabeth?] Maher\n\n[Possibly other children.]\n\nI believe that the Franklins, Kirbys, Mahers, and ORourkes named above originated in the Doon area of Counties Limerick/Tipperary.\n\nA cousin of mine was in Minneapolis, doing some lookups for Martin, when she just happened to see an entry for a Mrs. Martin Franklin! Further research into this developed that she was Margaret (take your pick of several surnames), previously married to a Bryan/Bernard Mullaney. After doing some detective work, and with help from my cousin looking for obituaries, I was able to determine that this Patrick in the 1880 census was in fact Margarets son by way of Bryan. In the same census, the John mentioned is also Margarets son by way of Bryan! My grandfather John was living with another family at that time, I believe. I was able to make the connection to Mullaneys from an obituary for George Franklin which listed him as a step-brother to Patrick and John. Margaret died at the Little Sisters Of The Poor home in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on 16 Sep 1913. Her previous husband, Bryan, died in Red Wing, Minnesota in 1870 I believe, and that is the year Martins wife Bridget died. As you my know, Red Wing is only about 10 miles from where Martin lived. How he met Margaret, I have no idea.\n\nI also found out that Martins son George, actually preceded Martin in death, dying 11 Apr 1906 in Minneapolis. His surname was spelled Franklyn. The informant on his death certificate is John Franklin. Fathers name listed as Martin. No mothers name given. No spouse name mentioned in obituary, so I dont know if George ever married. His death certificate lists Red Wing as place of birth, but I think that may be in error.\n\nAny and all help is appreciated. Steve in Montana My Franklins are around Chelsea, London, England from 1800 onwards. Prior to that they are from Wiltshire. I also have a Luke Franklin who emigrated to US in 1850/1 and settled in Whiteside County, Illinois. His son James W. Franklin and family ended up in Clinton County, Iowa.\n\nOn the Whiteside County website I have found the burial indexes for Luke and family (but not James W.) at Cottonwood Community Cemetery. From the Illinois Statewide Marriage Index online I have found that James M (W!) Franklin married Elizabeth Rudman and, Martha C. Franklin married Ernest H. Husman, in Whiteside County. Pete Franklin, in Surrey, England I am looking for any information on my family from Pontotoc County, Mississippi. William Oscar Franklin married Augusta V. Tutor. Jerry L. Holloway Earnest Franklin married Iona Middleton. I do not have any dates on them. Their daughter, Grace Franklin, married William Andy Mitchell. No dates on this either. Their daughter was Effie Mildred Mitchell. She married Harry Walter Cleveland. Irene Treihart My end-of-line individual is John Franklin, born 25 Dec 1835, Ithaca, Tompkins County, New York; died 15 Dec 1921 at Tacoma, Pierce County, Washington. My earliest record of him is the 1860 census where he is listed living in Watkins Post Office, Dix Township, Schuyler County, New York, with the Josiah D. Payne family where his profession was listed as machinist (page 822, HH 70/71). The 1865 New York State census shows John Franklin to be an owner of a foundry in Watkins, Schuyler County, New York at the foot of Decatur Street. Family papers indicate that he was operating the foundry as early as 1861. The census of 1850 from Fayette, Seneca County, New York, lists a John Franklin age 16 living with the Samuel and Triphina Wagoner family. The family included John Franklin, 4 children with the surname Jolly (ages 7-14), and 1 Wagoner, age 1. Only John was listed as going to school. I am not sure, of course, that this is my John Franklin.\n\nJohn Franklin married Sarah Jane Smith of Caroline, Tompkins County, New York, in 1861. Her grandfather, Benjamin T. Leggett, and grandmother, Elizabeth DeWitt, were early settlers in Tompkins County. John was in business in Watkins (now Watkins Glen) until late in 1870, when he sold the business and moved to Dubuque, Iowa. He lived in Iowa and then bought a farm in Grant County, Wisconsin, working also as a machinist in local industry. In 1889, he moved to Tacoma, Washington, where he became a lumber mill superintendent.\n\nJohn Franklins death certificate in Tacoma, Washington, lists his parents as David Franklin and Sarah. However, this information was submitted by his second wife, and as she gave an incorrect birth year and some errors in regard to children of the first marriage, I feel I cannot rely on her information on parents. There is a David Franklin listed on 1840 New York census in Tompkins County, town of Groton with a son and 3 daughters, and again on the 1850 census with 2 sons (Levi and Morgan) and 3 daughters. However, his wife was Olivia and there is no record of a son John. This David is a descendant of the David Franklin and Mary Hubbard line. Laurel Franklin Dearborn Im looking for information about John Franklin born, early 1800s in Tennessee or Alabama. Married Sarah Caroline Manly/Manely in Marshall County, Alabama They had one known son, John W. Franklin, born 1858 to 1860 in Alabama. John, Sarah, and infant son, John, are listed in 1860 Marshall County, Alabama census. In 1870 there is a 10-year-old John W. Franklin listed in the house of Nancy Click in Jackson County, Alabama. I believe Nancy and Sarah are sisters. I have a little more information but cant confirm any of it. Betty Pigg William Brawner Franklin, my 5th great-grandfather, was born about 1760 in Durham Parish, Charles County, Maryland. He married about 1779 to unknown first wife and they had at least 5 children:\n\nAsa Franklin\n\nKatherine Franklin married Eli Bowie (my line)\n\nJames Franklin\n\nSarah Franklin\n\nAnna Jane Franklin\n\nHis first wife died between 1798 and about 1806. After her death, William and five children migrated to Stony Point in Abbeville District, South Carolina. Here he married 2) Sarah White. There were at least three children of this marriage:\n\nGeorge Franklin\n\nDrucilla Franklin\n\nLouisa Franklin\n\nI believe William B. Franklin had at least three more children: Elizabeth Franklin, Mary Franklin and ______ but I dont have birth dates for them.\n\nWilliam B. Franklin died in Dec 1815 in Abbeville District, South Carolina, where his estate was probated in 1816.\n\nWilliam B. Franklins parents are said to be William Franklin and Elizabeth Brawner. I would appreciate any evidence to confirm or refute this and would also like to find the name of his first wife.\n\nI subscribed to the FFRU for years and have all issues up through Vol 43 but dont recall seeing anything on this Charles County, Maryland line.\n\nSeveral years ago, Cecil D. Franklin and his brother George W. Franklin published a book Tracing Our Roots: A Franklin Genealogy on this line. They devoted eight pages to the line prior to the arrival of William B. Franklin in South Carolina. Most of the book relates to the familys migration to Alabama and back to Georgia.\n\nA Mr. Ted Olmstead has provided me with a good deal of research from primary sources.\n\nA Dr. Ben Franklin shared with me the results of some professional research which he had commissioned. This relates to the Charles County, Maryland Franklins but not directly to William B. Franklin.\n\nA 1791 list of subscribers to repair the Durham Parish Church, Charles County, Maryland lists the following Franklins: Francis B., Zephaniah, Sr., Zeph, Jr., Priscilla, Hezekiah, James, John, William R., Edward, William and John D.\n\nI have copies of William B. Franklins estate settlement documents from the Abbeville County, South Carolina courthouse.\n\nIn Tracing Our Roots, Cecil Franklin notes that William B. Franklin was a veteran of the American Revolution, having served with the Maryland Troops in Continental Service. He also links William B. back to a John Franklin who emigrated to the Maryland Colony prior to 1700 and died there at the age of 105 years. This John Franklin left a will which was probated on 24 Dec 1760 in Charles County.\n\nCecil Franklin provided some source citations but I have found some errors in the book and do not know how much weight can be given to his conclusions. I believe Cecil was in his 80s when the book was printed am almost certain that he is now deceased. The index to the book lists more than 700 names, mostly related to families that moved on to Alabama and Georgia, and I always check the index when a query is posted on the Franklin List. So far there has not been a hit.\n\nMy Franklin link is via Katherine Franklin (born about 1774, Charles County, Maryland; died 24 Jun 1844, Abbeville County, South Carolina) daughter of William B. Franklin (born about 1760 Charles County, Maryland; died Dec 1815, Abbeville County, South Carolina) and his unknown first wife.\n\nBowies, Brawners and Franklins were members of Durham Parish Church. Ted Olmstead questions whether William B. Franklins mother was a Brawner as Cecil Franklin states in his book.\n\nPlease let me know if this line is of interest to you.
