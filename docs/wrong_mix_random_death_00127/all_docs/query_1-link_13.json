Mrs. Frank Lefavor\n\n[Source: Minneapolis Daily Tribune (MN) Aug. 30, 1870] tr. by mkk\n\n- Mrs. Frank Lefavor, a young married woman in Pilot Mound township, Fillmore county, died on the morning of Aug. 23d, from the effects of an abortion produced by the administration of medicines, as is alleged, at the hands of Mr. Thomas McIntire, on whose farm she and her husband were living as tenants. Her age was fifteen years, and the marriage took place in March last. An investigation is to be had. Morris Lewis\n\n[Source: Mower County Register (MN) May 9, 1867] tr. by mkk\n\nSUDDEN DEATH. - We are pained to learn of the death of Morris Lewis, of Turin, Lewis Co., New York, which occured on Saturday last at Foreston Fillmore County, Minnesota. The deceased was on a business visit in the West and had only a few weeks since bought considerable property in this place among which was a third of the Bank Block. He was a robust healthy looking man but caught a very severe cold which settled on his lungs and caused pneumonia of which disease he died as above stated. He was an old acquaintance of Mr. C. J. Paddock, of the firm of Paddock Bros, of this place; was strictly honest and a man of considerable wealth and influence, and had he lived would no doubt have been a permanent resident of Austin. Catherine Link\n\nSource: Duluth News-Tribune (Duluth, St. Louis County, Minn.) Thursday, 18 Apr. 1907; transcribed by FoFG mz\n\nPRESTON, Minn., April 17. â Mrs. Catherine Link, widow of John Link, died at the home of her son, Albert Link, at this place on the 14th from old age. Mrs. Link was 93 years of age, and was born in Germany, settling in Preston township in 1866. Litchfield Boy\n\n[Source: Minneapolis Daily Tribune (MN) June 11, 1871] tr. by mkk\n\n- A little boy, son of Mr. Litchfield, of Etna, Fillmore county, died suddenly on the night of June 3d. The physician thought it a case of sun-stroke, but it is possible that inhaling the fumes of slaughtered potato bugs was the cause of death; the boy had been thus engaged in the field."
