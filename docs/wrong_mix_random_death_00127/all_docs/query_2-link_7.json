Dr. Henry Franklin Hoyt (1855-1930) was born in St. Paul, accompanied the Yellowstone Expedition of David Stanley in 1873 as part of the railway route survey crew, graduated from the Columbia Medical College, was a friend of Henry McCarty, alias \"William Bonney\" and alias \"Billy the Kid,\" in Tascosa, Texas, and later served as a major and Chief Surgeon under the command of General Arthur MacArthur, Jr., during the Filipino Insurrection. When Charlie Pitts/Sam Wells, a member of the Jesse James/Cole Younger gang, was killed by a posse outside of Madelia, Minnesota, following the attempted robbery on the Northfield, Minnesota, Bank in 1876, his body was unclaimed after being placed on exhibit in the State Capitol building and, under Minnesota law, was donated to a medical school for dissection and his remains eventually were given by Frank W. Murphy, the Minnesota surgeon general, to Dr. Henry F. Hoyt. The body initially was shipped to Rush Medical School in Chicago, where Dr. Henry Hoyt intended the skeleton for his office, but the school refused to accept it due to its damaged condition. In a subsequent attempt to bleach the bones over the winter while he took a job in Las Vegas, Dr. Hoyt weighted them down in a sealed box in Lake Como one night, but one end of the box floated up sufficiently to be seen through the ice and was discovered by a young boy, August Robertson, hunting muskrats a short time later and became a focus for citizen alarm until Dr. Hoyt gained word of the controversy from newspaper accounts sent to him by a friend and was able to recover the skeleton from the Ramsey County sheriff. The skeleton disappeared later and was never found, although there was a skeleton included in a museum at Savage, Minnesota, that some claim is the remains of Charlie Pitts. Dr. Hoyt reportedly met Jesse James at the Old Adobe Hotel in Hot Springs, near Las Vegas, in 1879, while James dined with Billy the Kid. Henry Franklin Hoyt was the author of A Frontier Doctor, published by Houghton Mifflin Company in 1929, with an introduction by Frank B. Kellogg, which was an account of frontier and pioneer life in New Mexico and Texas. Henry Hoyt was a native Minnesotan, the son of Lorenzo Hoyt (1828-1909) and Sarah Philadelphia Terrell Hoyt (1832-1915) and the grandson of Benjamin F. Hoyt (1800-1875,) Elizabeth Haney Hoyt (1803-1873,) Henry Keeling Terrell (1808-1908,) and Jane Forsyth Cameron Terrell (1813-1891,) and graduated from the University of Minnesota. He worked as a rodman on a survey crew for the St. Paul & Pacific RailRoad and also helped on a survey of the U.S./Canada boundary. In 1874, he studied medicine in St. Paul with his uncle, John Henry Murphy, a doctor, interned at Church/St. Luke's Hospital in St. Paul and, in 1876, attended Rush Medical School in Chicago. In 1877, he prospected and also practiced medicine in Deadwood, Dakota Territory, and then went to the Texas panhandle, where he supplemented his medical practice income by working as a cowboy. In 1877, after traveling ten miles outside of Deadwood, Dakota Territory, to see one of his first patients, who had a serious gunshot wound, Hoyt was paid with a considerable pile of gold dust, but upon his return to town, he was shocked to find that a good part of the dust did not contain gold and Hoyt henceforth carried with him in his medical saddlebag a bottle of acid to test the validity of his payment. He eventually arrived at Tascosa, Texas, in the middle of a smallpox outbreak, and became an immediate hero after saving the life of Piedad, the adopted daughter of Casimero Romero, the wealthiest of the pastores in that town, when he made a paste of water and gunpowder and smeared it over her skin, which was covered with the pustules of smallpox. He met Bat Masterson and Billy the Kid at Tascosa, Texas. Hoyt reportedly gave the Billy the Kid a lady's watch, which Hoyt had won in a poker game, for the Kid to present as a gift to his sweetheart, Duvelina, and, just before Hoyt departed for Las Vegas, New Mexico Territory, Billy the Kid presented him with a sorrel racehorse, \"Dandy Dick,\" formerly owned by Sheriff William Brady, whom the Kid had killed during the Lincoln County War. Hoyt resided for a time at Las Vegas, where for extra money, he tended bar at the Exchange Hotel, and then moved his practice to Bernalillo, New Mexico. In September, 1881, two months after Billy the Kid's death, Hoyt returned East. In March, 1882, he received his M.D. degree from the Columbus (Ohio) Medical College, then returned to St. Paul, where he became chief surgeon for the Great Northern RailRoad and then for the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy RailRoad. In 1888, Hoyt married a widow, Ella Owens Gray, who had a son by her first marriage, and the couple later also had a son, Terrell Hoyt, of their own. Hoyt was the head of the St. Paul health department from 1883 until 1884 and from 1888 until 1894. During the Spanish-American War, Hoyt served with the U. S. Volunteers in the Philippines, from 1898 until 1899, where he participated in 25 battles, was wounded, and received the Silver Star for gallantry in 1925. After his discharge in 1902, Hoyt practiced medicine in El Paso, Texas, and in 1910, he moved to Long Beach, California, where he remained until his retirement.
