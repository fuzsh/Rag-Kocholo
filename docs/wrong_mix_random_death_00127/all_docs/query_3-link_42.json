Nevertheless, he had numerous interests in medicine, including experimentation, shrewd observations about health and disease in himself and others, civic activities, and inventions of medical devices. These achievements show his capacity for detailed, perceptive insights; his fastidiousness in recording his observations; and his thoughtful analyses of scientific phenomena and human conduct. In medicine, perhaps uniquely in his life, his major interests intersected: scientific pursuits, civic activities, amused scrutiny of human behavior, and the desire to improve the lot of his fellow man.\n\nBenjamin Franklin and the neurosciences.\n\nPubMed\n\nFinger, Stanley\n\n2006-01-01\n\nBenjamin Franklin (1706-1790), who is better known in other fields, especially colonial politics and international diplomacy, was an early, major contributor to the neurosciences from the New World. Among his accomplishments are: experiments on medical electricity as a possible cure for the palsies and hysteria; the first descriptions of how electricity affecting the brain can cause a specific type of amnesia; supporting the idea that cranial shocks might provide a cure for melancholia; showing that the cures performed by the Mesmerists to remove obstructions, including nerve blockages, rest on gullibility and suggestion, and recognizing the dangers, including those to the nerves, posed by exposure to lead. Franklin?s neuroscience was firmly based on experiments, careful observations, and hard data ? and finding clinical relevance for new discoveries was always on his mind.\n\nBenjamin Franklin's Evolving Views on Race and Ethnicity\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLapham, Steven S.; Saunders, Andrew\n\n2005-01-01\n\nMore telling than his negative comments about Germans' shortcomings, was Benjamin Franklin's early attitude to slavery.

Yet, often overlooked is the fact that Benjamin Franklin recognized that passing electricity through the head could affect memory for the traumatic event. Franklin described his findings on himself and others in several letters from the mid-1700s, 2 of which were published in his lifetime. What he observed was confirmed in 1783 by physician Jan Ingenhousz, who was one of his correspondents. Although Ingenhousz had lost his memory for his electrical accident and was confused immediately afterward, he felt strangely elated and unusually sharp the next morning. Hence, he called for clinical trials with patients with melancholia who were not responding to more conventional therapies. After Franklin received Ingenhousz's letter, he also called for clinical trials. Neither man, however, tied the possible new cure for melancholia to the memory loss--nor did the operators that began to treat some patients with melancholia successfully with cranial shocks. Only much later would the amnesia be thought to be associated with the cure. 2006 APA, all rights reserved\n\nBenjamin Franklin, Philadelphia's favorite son, was a membrane biophysicist.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Da-Neng; Stieglitz, Heather; Marden, Jennifer; Tamm, Lukas K\n\n2013-01-22\n\nBenjamin Franklin, mostly known for his participation in writing The Declaration of Independence and work on electricity, was also one of the first scientists to seek to understand the properties of oil monolayers on water surfaces.

Though at first taking a backseat to many of his other scientific and political endeavors, Franklin went on to experiment with oil, spreading monomolecular films on various bodies of water, and ultimately devised a concept of particle repulsion that is indirectly related to the hydrophobic effect. His early observations inspired others to measure the dimensions of oil monolayers, which eventually led to the formulation of the contemporary lipid bilayer model of the cell membrane.

Franklin outlined his plans for a college providing practical and classical instruction to prepare youth for real-world pursuits in his 'Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania' (1749), and Franklin's spirit of learning to serve society guides PENN to the present day. This is evidenced by the series of articles in this special issue of Neurosignals, describing research conducted by seasoned and newly recruited PENN faculty, addressing consequences of the longevity revolution which defines our epoch at the dawn of this millennium. While aging affects all organ systems, the nervous system is most critical to successful aging. Thus, the articles in this special issue of Neurosignals focus on research at PENN that is designed to prevent or ameliorate aging-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. This research could enhance our chances of aging successfully in the continuing longevity revolution, and the essay here provides context and background on this research.\n\nBenjamin Franklin's place in the history of medicine.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuth, E J\n\n2007-12-01\n\nBenjamin Franklin's seemingly endless curiosity and his prolific contributions in diplomacy, politics, literature, and science may well justify calling him the most eminent man in eighteenth-century American life. One portion of these contributions still striking for the insights and productivity it shows was in medicine. He saw the value in inoculation against smallpox. He was aware of the placebo effect. He, in effect, launched the first American medical school. He devised a flexible urethral catheter. He identified lead poisoning as a cause of abdominal pain and peripheral neuropathy. He accurately described psoriasis well before RobertWillan. These contributions in medicine of his time were not then notably influential, but they certainly illustrate the versatility of his intellect.\n\nBenjamin Franklin's Pictorial Representations of the British Colonies in America: A Study in Rhetorical Iconology.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nOlson, Lester C.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nInvestigates the underlying reasons for the fundamental shift in Benjamin Franklin's portrayals of the British colonies in America.

These conditions caused him considerable pain, markedly decreased his mobility, and likely contributed in indirect ways to his decline and eventual death from a pulmonary disorder. This article examines Franklin's risk factors for gout and stones, both as Franklin understood them and as we know them today. Significantly, both of these disorders are associated with high blood levels of uric acid, a metabolic by-product. Franklin's risk factors included his gender, genetics, diet, drinking, advanced age, psoriasis, and exposure to lead. Although it is impossible to assign a weight to each of these factors, it can be shown that a number of factors, each capable of raising uric acid levels, converged and conspired against him.\n\nBenjamin Franklin, electricity, and the palsies: on the 300th anniversary of his birth.\n\nPubMed\n\nFinger, Stanley\n\n2006-05-23\n\nBenjamin Franklin was involved not only with the nature of electricity but with its possible medical utility. He conducted electrical experiments on people with palsies, notably those caused by stroke, to see if electricity from machines could restore movement. Franklin recognized that electricity was not the miraculous cure it was hoped to be, and he presented his findings in 1757 as communication to the Royal Society. Although he did not provide names or individual case studies in this communication, subsequently published in 1758, his personal letters reveal that he treated at least two important colonists: James Logan, William Penn's secretary and a prominent public official in Pennsylvania, and Jonathan Belcher, governor of several provinces. Franklin's private letters shed light on how he conducted his clinical \"tryals\" and why he drew the conclusions he did in his report to the Royal Society.\n\nElectrotherapy for melancholia: the pioneering contributions of Benjamin Franklin and Giovanni Aldini.\n\nPubMed\n\nBolwig, Tom G; Fink, Max\n\n2009-03-01\n\nThe electrical induction of seizures with a therapeutic aim began in 1938, but the history of electric currents to relieve mental illness began 2 centuries earlier with the pioneering work of the Italian Giovanni Aldini and the American Benjamin Franklin.These early experiments are described demonstrating that the electrical force encouraged hopeful applications. This history emphasizes the unique contribution in the induction of grand mal seizures as the therapeutic basis rather than the role of electricity alone.\n\nMedical electricity and madness in the 18th century: the legacies of Benjamin Franklin and Jan Ingenhousz.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeaudreau, Sherry Ann; Finger, Stanley\n\n2006-01-01\n\nBenjamin Franklin had at least two accidents that resulted in electricity passing through his brain. In addition, he witnessed a patient's similar accident and performed an experiment that showed how humans could endure shocks to the head without serious ill effects, other than amnesia. Jan Ingenhousz, Franklin's Dutch-born medical correspondent better known for his discovery of photosynthesis, also had a serious accident that sent electricity though his head and, in a letter to Franklin, he described how he felt unusually elated the next day. During the 1780s, Franklin and Ingenhousz encouraged leading French and English electrical \"operators\" to try shocking the heads of melancholic and other deranged patients in their wards. Although they did not state that they were responding to Ingenhousz's and Franklin's suggestions, Birch, Aldini, and Gale soon did precisely what Ingenhousz and Franklin had suggested. These practitioners did not appear to induce convulsions in their mentally ill patients, but they still reported notable successes.\n\nBenjamin Franklin and his glass armonica: from music as therapeutic to pathological.\n\nPubMed\n\nFinger, Stanley; Zeitler, William\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn 1762, Benjamin Franklin, then in London, wrote a letter to a colleague in Italy describing his latest invention, a musical instrument he called the \"armonica,\" which was based on how rubbing a wet finger on the rims of wine glasses could produce musical tones. In contrast to earlier sets of wine glasses that could be tapped or rubbed, Franklin put a set of glass bowls differing in size on a horizontal rod turned by a food treadle, thus freeing both hands for touching the rotating glasses and allowing musicians to play more than two glasses at a time, as well as eliminating the nuisance of water tuning. Franklin played his instrument for pleasure, to manipulate the \"passions\" (emotions) and to treat melancholia. Nevertheless, late in his lifetime some individuals began to view glass armonica music differently, alleging it could cause nerve damage and mental problems. Here, we look at how Franklin used his glass armonica to manipulate the passions and examine what he must have thought about it supposedly causing health problems. We present Franklin as an empiricist, whose focus was more on results than theories; as an astute student of human behavior understanding the power of charms and other \"nonsense\"; and as a man of medicine living in an era when much was being attributed to the nerves, even though next to nothing was really known about the underlying nerve force.

At the time, the Leyden jar, the first capacitor, had just been invented, and Franklin performed experiments to determine the source of the spark and shock that occurred on discharge of the jar. In these experiments, he used Leyden jars and Franklin squares (parallel-plate capacitors) that could be disassembled and reassembled. These devices later became known as dissectible capacitors. One of the more interesting results Franklin obtained was that an electrified capacitor containing a dielectric could be disassembled, the electrodes discharged, and the capacitor reassembled without sacrificing its ability to produce a spark and shock. This result is contrary to what one expects from todayâs theory for capacitors involving ideal dielectrics (those possessing polarization and no other special properties such as surface effects): all charge is on the electrodes, and once they are discharged the capacitor is no longer electrified. During the years since Franklinâs observations, additional experiments have been performed and various explanations offered for the cause of Franklinâs results. In this paper, we first review the details for Franklinâs experiments, and then we describe a very simple experiment that can be performed today with a parallel-plate capacitor that gives results similar to Franklinâs. Next we discuss the experiments of Addenbrooke and Zeleny, performed in the first half of the 20th century, which provide plausible explanations for Franklinâs observations. Finally we describe the relationship of Franklinâs dissectible parallel-plate capacitor to another important 18th century inventionâVoltaâs generator of static electricity, the electrophorus.\n\nFinal Report of the Evaluation of the Benjamin Franklin Urban League Street Academy, ESEA Title I 1969-1970.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTeaching and Learning Research Corp., New York, NY.\n\nThe purpose of the Benjamin Franklin Urban League Street Academy Program is to help students stay in school, help dropouts to return to school, or help students enter the job market.

C.; Stolzenburg, M.\n\n2006-12-01\n\nOne of Benjamin Franklin's most famous experiments was the kite experiment, which showed that thunderstorms are electrically charged. It is not as commonly noted that the kite experiment was also one of the the first attempts to make an in situ measurement of any storm parameter. Franklin realized the importance of making measurements close to and within storms, and this realization has been shared by later atomspheric scientists. In this presentation we focus on a modern version of Franklin's kite--instrumented balloons--used for in situ measurements of electric field and other storm parameters. In particular, most of our knowledge of the charge structure inside thunderstorms is based on balloon soundings of electric field. Balloon measurements of storm electricity began with the work of Simpson and colleagues in the 1930's and 1940's. The next major instrumentation advances were made by Winn and colleagues in the 1970's and 1980's. Today's instruments are digital versions of the Winn design. We review the main instrument techniques that have allowed balloons to be the worthy successors to kites. We also discuss some of the key advances in our understanding of thunderstorm electrification made with in situ balloon-borne instruments.\n\nBen Franklin.

Skinner.\n\nPubMed\n\nRing, Malvin\n\n2006-01-01\n\nAmong Benjamin Franklin's papers was a letter from a young British immigrant, R. C. Skinner, asking for a loan of only twenty dollars to help this young man begin the practice of dentistry in this country. Although we don't know what the great man's response was to this appeal, Skinner went on to achieve fame in his profession. He was the first dentist ever, in this country, to be appointed to a hospital staff; he established the first free dental clinic for the poor; and he authored the first book on dentistry ever published in America, earning him the title \"The Father of American Dental Literature.\" From a newspaper advertisement of 1794, further information has been gleaned about Skinner's practice: he not only did conventional dentistry, but also supplied missing eyes, ears, noses and legs. This was a forerunner of the contemporary subspecialty of prosthodontics termed \"maxillofacial prosthetics\". An interesting list of Skinner's services and his fees for each, gives us a good picture of what dentistry was like in Colonial America.\n\nAnd Now, a Message for Today's Students from Ben Franklin.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLevy, Tedd\n\n1991-01-01\n\nSuggests that Benjamin Franklin's autobiography contains many useful messages for today's students.

It outlines the initial - and not always positive - reception of Franklin's work on electricity by the community of French scientists in the 1750s. It sketches Franklin's subsequent elevation into the pantheon of French Enlightenment heros, and it details his work as a \"civic scientist\" while American envoy to France in the 1770s and 1780s, notably his service on the government-sponsored commissions that repudiated the scientific and medical claims of Franz Anton Mesmer. This presentation concludes by examining a few features of Franklin's career that are not completely congruent with our notion of what a \"civic scientist\" might be, a contrast that is intended to illuminate both Franklin and the concept of \"civic scientist.\"\n\nBen Franklin's Scientific Amusements\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHerschbach, Dudley\n\n2003-04-01\n\nAs an American icon, Benjamin Franklin is often portrayed as wise and canny in business and politics, earnestly pursuing and extolling diligence, sensible conduct, pragmatism, and good works. Also legendary are some of his inventions, particularly the lightning rod, bifocals, and an efficient wood-burning stove. The iconic image is misleading in major respects. Today, surprisingly few people appreciate that, in the 18th century, Franklin was greatly esteemed throughout Europe as a scientist (termed then a \"natural philosopher.\") He was hailed as the \"Newton of Electricity.\" Indeed, until Franklin, electricity seemed more mysterious than had gravity in Newton's time, and lightning was considered the wrath of God. By his own account, Franklin's studies of electricity and many other phenomena were prompted not by practical aims, but by his playful curiosity--which often became obsessive. Also not generally appreciated is the importance of Franklin's scientific reputation in enhancing his efforts to obtain French support for the American Revolution.\n\nBen Franklin's Junto Revisited.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMerriam, Sharan\n\n1979-01-01\n\nDescribes the Colonial Junto organized by Benjamin Franklin in 1727 as a discussion club to debate politics, morals, and natural philosophy, and the later American Philosophical Society which extended (and continues) the subject knowledge.

D.\n\n2006-12-01\n\nObservations of the 1761 and 1769 transits of Venus were crucial to the early development of American geoscience. Accurate longitude measurements were needed for that, the Mason-Dixon survey, the 1804-1806 Lewis and Clark expedition to Oregon, and the westward expansion of the new republic [Woolf, \"The Transits of Venus: A Study of 18th Century Science,\" Princeton, 1959]. As founder of the American Philosophical Society Benjamin Franklin promoted the transit observations, and procured a large telescope for the Philadelphia group. While serving as ambassador to France he observed that a \"dry fog\" from the 1783 Laki eruption in Iceland had obscured the Sun, and suggested that as a cause of the unseasonably cold weather of that summer and winter. Although the longitude, solar parallax and Sun-Earth distance measurements have long since been improved on, observations of the dark lunar eclipse just before the June 6, 1761 transit are still valuable for identifying a very large volcanic eruption that spring, using Benjamin Franklin's method. Many observers worldwide, while making a final check on their clock/longitude, found the May 18, 1761 totally eclipsed Moon very dark or even invisible, e.g., Wargentin (Stockholm Observatory) could not see the Moon for 38 minutes even with a 2-ft telescope [Phil. Trans. 52, 208, 1761-1762]. Whereas the totally eclipsed Moon is illuminated only by sunlight refracted by the Earth's atmosphere, I conclude that it was severely obscured, thus meeting Benjamin Franklin's first condition.

He constructed a system of bells, one of which was attached to a conductor that was suspended vertically above his house. The device is illustrated in a well-known painting of Franklin (Cohen, 1985). The elevated conductor acquired a potential due to the electric field in the atmosphere and caused a brass ball to oscillate between two bells. The purpose of this study is to extend Franklin's idea by constructing a set of 'chimes' which will operate both in fair and in foul weather conditions. In addition, a mathematical relationship will be established between the frequency of oscillation of a metallic sphere in a simplified geometry and the potential on one plate due to the electrification of the atmosphere. Thus it will be possible to calibrate the 'Franklin Chimes' and to obtain a nearly instantaneous measurement of the potential of the elevated conductor in both fair and foul weather conditions.\n\nFranklin, Lavoisier, and Mesmer: origin of the controlled clinical trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nHerr, Harry W\n\n2005-01-01\n\nIn 1784, a Royal Commission headed by Benjamin Franklin and Antoine Lavoisier designed a series of ingenious experiments to debunk France's greatest medical rogue, Anton Mesmer, and his bizarre healing of illnesses based on his bogus theory of animal magnetism.

L.; Thordarson, T.\n\n2006-12-01\n\nBenjamin Franklin was one of the first to recognize the connections between volcanic eruptions and climate. Shortly after the 1783-1784 Laki eruption, he postulated that the dry fog over much of Europe was likely caused by a volcanic eruption in Iceland, that the winds would have transported the gas and aerosol over much of the Northern Hemisphere, and that the cold winter of 1783-84 was caused by this dry fog. We used the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE climate model to examine the chemical conversion and transport of SO2 gas from the Laki eruption (64.10Â°N, 17.15Â°W) and used the resulting aerosol concentrations to model the climate response. Using our calculated aerosol distribution, we conducted a 10-member ensemble simulation with ModelE coupled to a q-flux mixed-layer ocean. The mean of these runs reproduced the extensive radiative cooling (-1 to -3Â°C) that occurred during the summer of 1783 across much of Asia, Canada, and Alaska and produced a strong dynamical effect in summer as the Laki eruption forces a significant weakening of the African and India monsoon circulations. This is seen in cloud cover and precipitation anomalies and resulted in significant warming (1 to 2Â°C) from the Sahel of Africa to northern India. This is a very robust result and has been observed after the last 3 large high-latitude volcanic eruptions, EldgjÃ¡ (939), Katmai (1912), and Laki, all of which produced large reductions in the flow of the Nile River. In the winter of 1783-1784 our model reproduced the significant negative temperature anomalies over the Northeastern United States, and smaller cooling produced over Europe. That winter was one of the coldest on record over these areas and our model results confirm that Laki could have been partially responsible for these anomalies.\n\nFranklin's Philadelphia Academy and Basedow's Dessau Philanthropine: Two Models of Non-Denominational Schooling in Eighteenth-Century America and Germany\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nOverhoff, Jurgen\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Academy of Philadelphia (today known as the University of Pennsylvania), founded through Benjamin Franklin's influence in 1751, and the Dessau Philanthropine, founded by Johann Bernhard Basedow in 1774, were arguably the first non-denominational schools in the eighteenth century.

The instrument immediately became popular and inspired compositions by Wolfgang Mozart, who had the opportunity to hear and play one at the house of Franz Anton Mesmer. Armonica music was used by Mesmer in his sÃ©ances, because he felt it could promote healing by propagating a mystical fluid that he called animal magnetism through the body. After Mesmer's theories were debunked by a highly respected panel of scientists, the armonica fell out of vogue. Because Franklin was on the panel that examined the discredited mesmerism, he indirectly contributed to his own invention's demise.\n\nAttenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR FT-IR) Spectroscopy as a Forensic Method to Determine the Composition of Inks Used to Print the United States One-cent Blue Benjamin Franklin Postage Stamps of the 19th Century.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrittain, Harry G\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThrough the combined use of infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy and attenuated total reflectance (ATR) sampling, the composition of inks used to print the many different types of one-cent Benjamin Franklin stamps of the 19th century has been established. This information permits a historical evaluation of the formulations used at various times, and also facilitates the differentiation of the various stamps from each other. In two instances, the ink composition permits the unambiguous identification of stamps whose appearance is identical, and which (until now) have only been differentiated through estimates of the degree of hardness or softness of the stamp paper, or through the presence or absence of a watermark in the paper. In these instances, the use of ATR Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectroscopy effectively renders irrelevant two 100-year-old practices of stamp identification. Furthermore, since the use of ATR sampling makes it possible to obtain the spectrum of a stamp still attached to its cover, it is no longer necessary to identify these blue Franklin stamps using their cancellation dates.

D.; Moore, C. B.; Rison, W.\n\n2006-12-01\n\nMost people know that Ben Franklin invented the lightning rod and that his rods have successfully protected structures for over 250 years. What people don't know is that he invented them on the basis of two misconceptions. The first, that an elevated pointed conductor would discharge a thunderstorm, thereby preventing lightning. The second, that, should the first process fail, the elevated conductor, by virtue of its pointed tip, would serve as a preferred receptor for any lightning strokes that did occur. It has long been known that grounded, elevated, pointed conductors can not discharge thunderstorms and experiments conducted at the Langmuir Laboratory during the 1990s have shown that moderately blunt, rather than pointed, rods are the best receptors for lightning strokes. Nevertheless, Franklin's incorrect ideas about lightning rods persist in many minds, even among some people in the lightning protection business.\n\n58.

Between 16% (chromium) and 71% (selenium, manganese) of the variation in metal concentrations was explained by tissue and age, except for selenium and arsenic, which were only explained by tissue. Of 35 possible differences (seven metals in five tissues), 24 significant age-related differences were found in Franklin`s gulls, with young generally having lower concentrations of metals in all of their tissues than adults. A notable exceptionmoreÂ Â» was the liver; young had significantly higher concentrations of selenium, chromium, manganese, and arsenic than did adults. Three notable findings were the following: young had significantly higher concentrations of selenium, chromium, manganese, and arsenic in their liver than did adults; young had 30 times as much chromium in the liver than adults; and adults had greatly elevated concentrations of cadmium in feathers, kidney, and liver.Â«Â less\n\n75 FR 14257 - Pricing for Bronze Medals\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-03-24\n\n...

Peery, Jr. died at his home in Silver Spring, MD of natural causes on 30 November 2010. His full life began in St. Joseph, MO (home of the Pony Express) on 4 March 1922. His father was a railway mail clerk, so his family moved frequently. Most of his childhood was spent in southeastern Minnesota. He enlisted in the army in 1942, and served in campaigns in North Africa and Italy. After his discharge in 1945, he enrolled in the University of Minnesota, earning a BS in Physics in 1949. One of his early hobbies was to build and fly model airplanes. His intention to pursue aeronautical engineering changed to physics, but after receiving a MS in physics from Fisk University in 1955, he decided on a career in astronomy. He told the editors of the PBS series The Astronomers (1991, in which his career is highlighted) he thought it was shamefully absurd not to know what made the stars shine. So he began PhD studies in astronomy at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor). His dissertation was on the complex eclipsing binary VV Cephei, where a compact hot star passes behind a cool giant star, revealing the structure of that giant's atmosphere. This task was especially demanding because of the complexity of the system's spectrum and the formidable array of observations assembled by Ben's advisor, Dean McLaughlin. Fortunately, Ben's strong physics background enabled him to design and construct one of the first oscilloscope measuring engines, which his fellow students called the PeeryScope. The final (1961) dissertation is an impressive combination of observational and astrophysical analysis. His degree was obtained in 1962; he had already begun a career at the University of Indiana, where he taught and did research (1959--1976). The Indiana years were highly productive. In addition to his own research, he was advisor on six PhD dissertations, and a master's thesis. Several of his students have also had productive careers.

Hess Medal at the AGU Spring Meeting Honors Ceremony, which was held on May 27, 1998, in Boston, Massachusetts. The Harry H. Hess Medal recognizes outstanding achievements in the research of the constitution and evolution of Earth and its sister planets.A meaningful understanding of the Earth and planets requires explaining their differences. This explanation of planetary processes is difficult partly because it entails a wide range of scalesâfrom microscale, operating at the atomic level, to macroscale, determined by boundaries thousands of kilometers apart. David Stevenson's graduate study was mainly in theoretical condensedmatter physics, but he is remarkable in his grasp of large-scale planetary processes such as mantle convection and the dynamos. He is also remarkable in his âinstinct to attack the jugular,â that is to go for the most important problems and for the versatility of his approaches thereto.\n\n75 FR 65227 - Revocation of Class E Airspace; Franklin, TX\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-10-22\n\n...-0603; Airspace Docket No. 10-ASW-9] Revocation of Class E Airspace; Franklin, TX AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.

Overall, changes in operating revenues and expenditures in these jurisdictions have corresponded with changes in the local economy. The combined operating expenditures of Benton County, Franklin County, Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland, expressed in current dollars, tripled between 1975 and 1985, increasing from $18.1 million to $55.0 million, an annual average increase of 11.8 percent. During this time, the population of the Benton-Franklin MSA increased from 100,000 to 140,900 people, and the national all-items price index for urban consumers doubled, increasingmoreÂ Â» from 161.2 to 322.2. Adjusted for inflation, per capita expenditures by these governments increased only slightly during this period, from $361.8 in 1975 to $390.3 in 1985. Employment in the Benton-Franklin MSA rose from 40,080 workers in 1970 to a peak of 75,900 in 1981 before declining to 61,100 in 1985, primarily due to the loss of 9,928 jobs in the Washington Public Power Supply System after 1981. The MSA's population followed a similar trend, with a slight lag. In 1970, total population in the Benton-Franklin MSA was 93,356 people. The MSA's population grew rapidly during the late 1970s, reached a peak of 147,900 persons in 1982, and then declined to 139,300 in 1986. 23 refs., 16 figs., 14 tabs.Â«Â less\n\n77 FR 35391 - Franklin Budget Car Sales, Inc.; Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2012-06-13\n\n...

Franklin, 1923-2007\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRao, Joe; Degrasse Tyson, Neil\n\n2007-12-01\n\nRenowned astronomer and astronomy popularizer Kenneth L. Franklin died early Monday morning, June 18, 2007, in Boulder, Colorado, two weeks after undergoing heart surgery. He was 84 years old. Kenneth Linn Franklin, the only child of Myles and Ruth (Houston) Franklin, was born March 25, 1923 in Alemeda, California. Ken obtained his Ph.D. in astronomy in 1953 at the University of California, Berkeley. From 1954 to 1956 he was a research fellow in radio astronomy at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, Carnegie Institution of Washington, DC. While there, he and Bernard F. Burke discovered radio emissions from the planet Jupiter. They announced their find on April 6, 1955, at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS). In 1956 Ken joined the staff of the American Museum-Hayden Planetarium, where he later served as chairman and chief scientist. Over the course of thirty years he wrote and/or presented innumerable sky shows for the planetarium sky theater, taught popular and technical courses in astronomy, and answered questions from the public. Ken was frequently consulted by local industries engaged in the space program, as well as by the news media and publishers. He was often interviewed on local and national radio and television, especially when a celestial event of special interest was due to occur. On the first page of the November 1966 issue of Sky & Telescope, in comments about the upcoming Leonid meteor shower, Franklin stuck his neck out. Based on some calculations that he'd made, he said he felt we were going to be in for a \"interesting display.\" His was one of the few forecasts that suggested the '66 Leonids might be memorable. As it turned out, he was right â that year observers experienced the now-legendary Leonid meteor storm. From 1973 to 1979, Ken was the AAS's public-affairs officer. For two decades he also served in the society's Harlow Shapley Visiting Lecturer Program, speaking at one or two colleges each year. Ken was an active\n\n2.

The numismatic record has proven to be the most enduring, albeit one of the most selective, records of the progress of history. Matters of health, and especially of military medicine, have been central to the endeavors and indeed the survival of many cultures and societies. Many such themes in the national and international history of military medicine are preserved in the medallic record. Coins and medallions thus constitute one record of the chronology of this profession, one parallel to that of the more traditional history to be found in oral and written records. This account presents a four-part classification of medical coins and medals of military interest. These examples include (1) medals that portray military surgeons and physicians; (2) medals that commemorate special events of military medicine: (3) coins that portray the themes of the discipline of military medicine and health; and (4) a miscellaneous group that includes such examples as disease \"touch pieces\" and the militarily worn medals of such bodies as the International Red Cross and the Order of St. John, the latter of which are awarded inter alia for contributions to prehospital care in the field. A representative photo archive of such exemplars is included in this account.\n\n14 CFR Appendix A to Part 1221 - Congressional Space Medal of Honor\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2013 CFR\n\n2013-01-01\n\n... 14 Aeronautics and Space 5 2013-01-01 2013-01-01 false Congressional Space Medal of Honor A Appendix A to Part 1221 Aeronautics and Space NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION THE NASA SEAL AND OTHER DEVICES, AND THE CONGRESSIONAL SPACE MEDAL OF HONOR Pt. 1221, App. A Appendix A to Part 1221...\n\n14 CFR Appendix A to Part 1221 - Congressional Space Medal of Honor\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-01-01\n\n... 14 Aeronautics and Space 5 2011-01-01 2010-01-01 true Congressional Space Medal of Honor A Appendix A to Part 1221 Aeronautics and Space NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION THE NASA SEAL AND OTHER DEVICES, AND THE CONGRESSIONAL SPACE MEDAL OF HONOR Pt. 1221, App. A Appendix A to Part 1221...\n\nHow Rosalind Franklin Discovered the Helical Structure of DNA: Experiments in Diffraction\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBraun, Gregory; Tierney, Dennis; Schmitzer, Heidrun\n\n2011-01-01\n\nRosalind Franklin, a chemical physicist (1920-1958), used x-ray diffraction to determine the structure of DNA.

Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy (MeDALL; EU FP7-CP-IP; project no: 261357; 2010-2015) studied the complex links of allergic diseases at the clinical and mechanistic levels by linking epidemiologic, clinical, and mechanistic research, including inÂ vivo and inÂ vitro models. MeDALL integrated 14 European birth cohorts, including 44,010 participants and 160 cohort follow-ups between pregnancy and age 20Â years. Thirteen thousand children were prospectively followed after puberty by using a newly standardized MeDALL Core Questionnaire. AÂ microarray developed for allergen molecules with increased IgE sensitivity was obtained for 3,292 children. Estimates of air pollution exposure from previous studies were available for 10,000 children. Omics data included those from historical genome-wide association studies (23,000 children) and DNA methylation (2,173), targeted multiplex biomarker (1,427), andÂ transcriptomic (723) studies. Using classical epidemiology and machine-learning methods in 16,147 children aged 4Â years and 11,080 children aged 8Â years, MeDALL showed the multimorbidity of eczema, rhinitis, and asthma and estimated that only 38% of multimorbidity was attributable to IgE sensitization. MeDALL has proposed a new vision of multimorbidity independent of IgE sensitization, and has shown that monosensitization and polysensitization represent 2 distinct phenotypes. The translational component of MeDALL is shown by the identification of a novel allergic phenotype characterized by polysensitization and multimorbidity, which is associated with the frequency, persistence, and severity of allergic symptoms. The results of MeDALL will help integrate personalized, predictive, preventative, and participatory approaches in allergic diseases.

Named for American patriot and inventor Ben Franklin, who discovered the Gulf Steam, the 50-foot Ben Franklin was built between 1966 and 1968 in Switzerland for deep- ocean explorer Jacques Piccard and the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation. The submersible made a famous 30-day drift dive off the East Coast of the United States and Canada in 1969 mapping the Gulf Stream's currents and sea life, and also made space exploration history by studying the behavior of aquanauts in a sealed, self-contained, self-sufficient capsule for NASA. On July 14, 1969, the Ben Franklin was towed to the high-velocity center of the Stream off the coast of Palm Beach, Florida. With a NASA observer on board, the sub descended to 1,000 feet off of Riviera Beach, Florida and drifted 1,400 miles north with the current for more than four weeks, reemerging near Maine. During the course of the dive, NASA conducted exhaustive analyses of virtually every aspect of onboard life. They measured sleep quality and patterns, sense of humor and behavioral shifts, physical reflexes, and the effect of a long-term routine on the crew. The submarine's record-shattering dive influenced the design of Apollo and Skylab missions and continued to guide NASA scientists as they devised future marned space-flight missions.\n\nHow Rosalind Franklin Discovered the Helical Structure of DNA: Experiments in Diffraction\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBraun, Gregory; Tierney, Dennis; Schmitzer, Heidrun\n\n2011-03-01\n\nRosalind Franklin, a chemical physicist (1920-1958), used x-ray diffraction to determine the structure of DNA.

Franklin wrote the following: \"The results suggest a helical structure (which must be very closely packed) containing 2, 3 or 4 co-axial nucleic acid chains per helical unit, and having the phosphate groups near the outside.\"2 This was 16 months before J. D. Watson and F. Crick published their description of DNA, which was based on R. Franklin's x-ray photos. How they gained access to her x-ray photos is a fascinating tale of clashing personalities and male chauvinism.2,3\n\nGold Medal Award for Life Achievement in the Practice of Psychology: Charles Silverstein\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAmerican Psychologist, 2011\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe American Psychological Foundation (APF) Gold Medal Awards recognize distinguished and enduring records of accomplishment in four areas of psychology: the application of psychology, the practice of psychology, psychology in the public interest, and the science of psychology.

Summer Olympic Games medal tallies have been associated with national wealth, and also social development and healthcare expenditure. It is uncertain however, how these socioeconomic factors translate into Olympic success. The objective of this study was therefore to examine the relationship between population muscle strength and Olympic medal tallies. Methods and Results This study of handgrip strength represents a cross-sectional analysis of the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study, which is an ongoing population cohort study of individuals from high-, middle-, and low-income countries. Within participating countries, households from both urban and rural communities were invited to participate using a sampling strategy intended to yield a sample that was representative of the community. Households were eligible if at least one member was aged 35â70 years and if they intended living at the same address for a further four years. A total of 152,610 participants from these households, located in 21 countries, were included in this analysis. Handgrip strength was measured using a Jamar dynanometer. Olympic medal tallies were made over the five most recent Summer Games. There was a significant positive association between national population grip strength (GS) and medal tally that persisted after adjustment for sex, age, height, average daily caloric intake and GDP (total and per capita). For every 1kg increase in population GS, the medal tally increased by 36% (95% CI 13â65%, p = 0.001) after adjustment. Among countries that won at least one medal over the four most recent Summer Olympic Games, there was a close linear relationship between adjusted GS and the natural logarithm of the per capita medal tally (adjusted r = 0.74, p = 0.002). Conclusions Population muscle strength may be an important determinant\n\nBen Franklin: A Curiosity-Driven Scientist, a Service-Driven Citizen\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHerschbach, Dudley\n\n2003-04-01\n\nAt the age of 42, Franklin retired from his prosperous printing business, ``to have leisure to read, study, and make experiments.\" The scope of his scientific work was remarkable. Beyond his key contributions to understanding electrcity, Franklin wrote major papers on population growth, on meterology, on heat conduction and evaporation, charted the Gulf Stream, studied bioluminescence and the stilling of water waves by a surface layer of oil. He also advanced arguments in favor of conservation of mass and the wave theory of light. Although always alert for practical applications, his style was that of an explorer, eager for adventure and insight. However, Franklin did not consider science as important as public service. He promoted many civic projects in Philadelphia, including a circulating library, fire department, paving of streets, hospital, and was the prime mover in founding the American Philosophical Society and an academy that evolved into the University of Pennsylvania. As well as publishing the most widely read newspaper in the colonies and his bestselling almanac, he became public printer for several of the colonies and postmaster. He lived in England 14 years as a trade representative, largely struggling in vain. At the age of 70, he undertook a decade of service as minister to France, achieving against great odds crucial diplomatic triumphs.\n\n38 CFR 3.802 - Medal of Honor.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n..., Compensation, and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation Special Benefits Â§ 3.802 Medal of Honor.
