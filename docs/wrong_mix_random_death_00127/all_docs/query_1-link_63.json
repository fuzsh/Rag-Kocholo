        "text": "Jeanne Rodriguez, 69, of Moorhead, MN, died December 22, 2023, in her home, surrounded by her loving family.\n\nJeanne Elizabeth Anderson was born November 1, 1954, in Moorhead, to Jalmer and Alice (Jacobson) Anderson. She graduated from Moorhead High School in 1972 and obtained a degree in Education from Concordia College in 1976. After college, she traveled to Monterrey, Mexico where she taught English in the American Institute and where she met Humberto Rodriguez. Jeanne returned to the U.S. and taught in Appleton, WI for some time before returning to Monterrey to teach again at the American Institute and to reunite with Humberto. They were married on July 10, 1982, at Our Savior’s Lutheran Church in Moorhead. The family lived for some while in Monterrey and had two sons, Eric, born in 1984 and Bryan, born in 1988 until they moved to Moorhead in 1990. Jeanne began teaching Spanish at Ben Franklin Junior High in Fargo and shared her experience in Spanish and world languages when needed at Fargo North High School and Carl Ben Eielson Middle School. She retired from teaching at the age of 62.\n\nJeanne’s life revolved around her faith, family and friends. She was active and filled many roles at Our Savior’s Lutheran Church in Moorhead, including organizing volunteers, serving funeral lunches, organizing donation drives for Churches United and Dorothy Day House and serving on church boards. She was devoted to her family and had a special bond with her sister, Phyllis, who helped to raise her. Jeanne was a social butterfly and enjoyed gatherings of her retired teacher friends and attending movie nights at a friend's house. She had the ability to remember the names and faces of her past students which always made them feel special.\n\nJeanne is survived by her husband, Humberto, and sons, Eric and Bryan, all of Moorhead; also, her brother Steve Anderson, of Barnesville, MN. She was preceded in death by her parents; her sister, Phyllis Smilonich and her brother, Bryce Anderson.\n\nThe funeral with Livestream will be Friday, January 5, 2024, at 11:00 A.M., with visitation for one hour before the service, at Our Savior's Lutheran Church, Moorhead, MN. Interment will be at Comstock Lutheran Cemetery, Comstock, MN."
