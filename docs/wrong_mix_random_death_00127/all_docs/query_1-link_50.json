        "text": "CAN DO, Inc. honored Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Northeast Pennsylvania as its Partner of the Year during CAN DO’s 60th annual dinner June 7.\n\nCAN DO President and CEO Kevin O’Donnell presented the award to Ken Okrepkie, Northeast PA Regional Director for Ben Franklin Technology Partners, in appreciation of Ben Franklin’s long relationship with CAN DO and its continued support of the organization’s economic development efforts.\n\nThe Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Northeastern Pennsylvania is part of a state-funded economic development initiative created in 1983. They link early-stage technology firms and established manufacturers with funding, people, technology, universities and other resources to help them prosper. In the process, Ben Franklin aims to help fuel economic growth for all of northeastern Pennsylvania.\n\n“On behalf of the Ben Franklin Technology Partners board of directors and the staff and team that support our organization, I appreciate the opportunity to receive this prestigious award,” Okrepkie said. “Henry Ford said, ‘Coming together is a beginning, keeping together is progress and working together is success. From Valmont (Industrial Park) to Humboldt (Industrial Park), tens of thousands of people work for companies that CAN DO has recruited. Other communities are no doubt jealous to have to compete with an organization that brings the highest professionalism and detail to each and every deal. CAN DO embodies an energy and persistent spirit that continues to move this community forward.”\n\nIn Hazleton, Ben Franklin has been instrumental in its support of CAN DO’s strategy to diversify its efforts from industry recruitment only to the start up of new businesses within the community and the creation of an entrepreneurial ecosystem to help launch businesses with local roots and the desire to stay and grow.\n\nThrough their financial support, technical guidance and introduction to the operational methods of other business incubators, Ben Franklin assisted CAN DO and CAN BE, CAN DO’s organization for business entrepreneurship, in launching the Hazleton Innovation Center in the Valmont Industrial Park in 2005, which has led to the creation of many new businesses.\n\nO’Donnell said, “Through the years, we at CAN DO have been fortunate to collaborate with many partners who have supported our efforts to make Greater Hazleton and all of Northeastern Pennsylvania a great place for industries and entrepreneurs to locate, start new businesses and create jobs. Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Northeast Pennsylvania is a valued partner whose support has been so vital to CAN DO, especially to the success of our CAN BE entrepreneurial development efforts.”\n\nAdditionally, Ben Franklin has assisted established local manufacturers in creatively applying new technology and business practices to achieve industry leadership. As an advocate of the Keystone Innovation Zone and their promotion of innovative community-wide infrastructure, businesses in downtown Hazleton, the CAN DO Corporate Center, as well as the CAN BE Innovation Center, have benefited from the work of Ben Franklin Technology Partners.\n\nIn addition to his work with Ben Franklin Technology Partners, Okrepkie’s contributions to CAN DO and to the area include serving as Chairman of the CAN BE Committee and as a member of CAN DO’s Executive Committee.\n\nIn the photo, Ken Okrepkie, left, receives the Partner of the Year Award from Kevin O’Donnell."
