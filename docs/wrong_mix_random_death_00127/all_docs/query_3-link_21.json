        "text": "Notes\n\nThe references cited below offer a selective account of the most important commentary on Franklin’s book, particularly work written on the memoir since the simultaneous appearance of the 1964 Yale edition and of Robert Sayre’s pioneering study of American autobiography, The Examined Self. I have emphasized the sources that were most helpful to me, and I have tried to clarify the many instances in which this study differs from well-established lines of interpretation. Franklin’s critics have not always shared his interest in curtailing verbal disputes, but it was my intent to keep to Franklin’s standards of modest diffidence in the disagreements that I document here. Although each note number links to a specific place in the text, I have tried to replicate the experience of a bibliographic essay in the notes as a whole, so that readers who are inclined to do so may postpone consulting any annotation until they have finished the entire book.\n\nINTRODUCTION: Accident and Design\n\nCHAPTER 1: Great Works and Little Anecdotes\n\nCHAPTER 2: Imposing Forms\n\n10. The motto for Sincerity is an especially vivid instance of the manner in which Franklin’s explanatory precepts repeatedly dramatize the constant and bewildering interchange between any given virtue and its opposite, not the silencing of economically disadvantageous traits that Mitchell Breitwieser detects in his admittedly “quick survey” of these complicated ethical statements. See Cotton Mather and Benjamin Franklin: The Price of Representative Personality (New York: Cambridge UP, 1984), pp. 282–85.\n\nCHAPTER 3: The Scramble of Life\n\nCHAPTER 4: Litera Scripta Manet\n\n2. The Yale editors print the draft of annotations that Franklin prepared for Pitt’s act. See P, 21.459–62. The wording of the annotations suggests that Franklin may have intended to call Pitt’s attention to the 1754 Albany Plan of Union or at least take a copy of the plan itself to the meeting in which Pitt had intended to ask for Franklin’s comments.\n\nCHAPTER 5: Some Uses of Cunning"
