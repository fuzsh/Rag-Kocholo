There will be a Celebration of Life held at the Green Roof Area Center (located behind the Credit Union) in Paynesville on Saturday, June 26, 2021, from 10 a.m. to 12 noon. Cyrill was known by all as John. He was born in August 1950 and raised in the Paynesville area, graduating from Paynesville High School. John was a welder all his life. It is what he knew, and he did it well. He was the best in our eyes. He had a lot of pride in his work. If you're going to do something, do it well and be proud of it, he would always say to his girls. He retired from welding at Bobcat in Litchfield. He was enjoying his retirement doing what he lovedÉfishing and hunting. John met Terry (Sander) and married in 1971. Later divorced, they had three daughters: Dawn Koltes of Eden Valley and Sonja Arceneau and Heather Lee, both of Paynesville. John remarried to Judi Schultz; she has one daughter (Kristine) and three sons (Justin, Cory, and Jacob). John's passion was hunting and fishing. He participated in many local fishing tournaments with his brother-in-law David and every year he went deer hunting with his brother Les and grandsons Cameron, Jared, and Justin. He had planned this fall to go turkey hunting for the first time with his grandson Jake; he was so excited, making sure he had everything he would need. John loved his family; family was everything to him. He always told his girls it may be difficult, you may not always agree, but nothing good or forever is easy. Family is forever; family is work. He was always right. John was the quiet type, did not say a whole lot, but when he did everyone around him would listen, especially family. John had a tough couple of years, including multiple surgeries and triple bypass heart surgery in August 2020. That was a surprise to all of us, but he was a fighter and was not going to let that slow him down. You would always see John sitting outside on the picnic table or the chair and watching the traffic go by with a smile and waving at all who honked their car horn. He probably knew everyone who drove by. While outside he would be playing with the kids, tinkering with his boat, fixing on something, taking a nap, or enjoying the weather. If you did not see him sitting outside in his chair, he was up at Hilltop having coffee with the locals catching up on the latest news. Dad/John taught his girls to take responsibility for all their actions, deal with the consequences if any, and learn from them and grow from them. That is what makes you, you. We (your girls) love you Dad. John is survived by his daughters Dawn (Ron) Koltes of Eden Valley, Sonja (Dan) Arceneau of Paynesville, and Heather (Michael) Lee of Paynesville; wife Judi Fredrick and her four children; nine grandchildren, Jared (Valerie), Harley, Jake, Taylor, Jaxon, Amrit, Justin, Olivia, and Cameron; six great-grandchildren, Aiden, Ava, LeRoy, Bennett, Greyson John (due June 2021), and Giovanni (due September 2021); brothers, Les Fredrick of Dalton, Minn., and Allen and Steve Fredrick of Paynesville; and sisters, Millie (David) Peschong and Barb Fredrick of Paynesville, Irma (Donald) Pittman of DeGraff, Minn., and Rosie Smith of Benson, Minn. He was proceeded in death by his parents Charles and Cornelia Fredrick; sister Pauline Houck; and sons-in-law LeRoy Schmitt and Chad Lieser. We would like to give a sincere thank you to Jessie and Jen for finding our dad at the boat landing that Thursday night and starting CPR and to the two nurses who also came to help until the ambulance arrived. Thank you to the Paynesville Ambulance and CentraCare Hospital staff who did all they could for our dad. We deeply appreciate all you did for our dad. The family of John Fredrick says thank you!\n\nElmer Neu, 81, Paynesville\n\nElmer J. Neu, 81, of Paynesville died on Saturday, June 12, 2021, at his home near Paynesville.
