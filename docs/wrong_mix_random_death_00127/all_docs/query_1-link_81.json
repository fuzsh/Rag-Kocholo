        "text": "Franklin Joseph Bollwitt, 87, a resident of Fergus Falls, died Sunday, June 2, 2024 at Sanford Health in Fargo, ND.\n\nFrank was born on June 2, 1937 in Ewing, Nebraska, the son of Frank and Marcella (Emsick) Bollwitt. He grew up in Ewing and graduated from Ewing High School in 1955. After high school, Frank served in the United States Army for 9 months.\n\nOn September 11, 1965, he married Janet Rae Warden at St. Leonard's church in Madison, Nebraska.\n\nThrough the years he had many trucking jobs in Nebraska, South Dakota and Minnesota. He was an agent for American Freight in Fergus Falls and then drove for Metz bakery until retirement. After retirement, Frank enjoyed meeting his old trucking buddies for breakfast and also kept his CB radio handle, \"High Pockets\", so he could chat across America.\n\nFrank was a member of Our Lady of Victory Catholic Church, where he served as an usher for many years. He was also active in Knights of Columbus in his earlier years, helping with bingo, fish fries and selling Christmas trees with the Boy Scouts. Frank and Janet joined the \"Newcomers Club\" when they moved to Fergus Falls. It was through this club, they created friendships that have lasted a lifetime.\n\nHe enjoyed gardening activities, helping with planting at his daughter and son-in-law's farm. He also enjoyed helping farmers around his homestead. Some of his favorite activities were camping with friends and family and making homemade pies over the campfires. Frank enjoyed watching wrestling from a young age. He looked forward to his nightly call from his little brother, Leroy, while they watched \"Wheel of Fortune\" together. Family get-togethers were a highlight for Frank, because he knew it meant great food and desserts, but most importantly it was a great excuse for him to break out his home-made ice cream. Frank enjoyed travelling across America and abroad, experiencing the world. The joy it brought him and his family was well worth it even though he suffered from motion sickness.\n\nPreceding him in death were his parents; brothers, Benjamin and Leroy; sister, Darlene and step-father, Joe Wiebelhaus.\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Janet of Fergus Falls; daughters, Brenda (Glen) Halbakken of Pelican Rapids, Rebecca (Chad) Sherva of Moorhead, Amy (Paul) Hicks of Fergus Falls; grandchildren, David Halbakken, Luke (Hannah) Halbakken, Michael Halbakken, Daniel Halbakken, Donovan Young, Justin Halbakken, Alyssa Halbakken; step-grandson, Jordan Sherva; great-grandchild, Navie Halbakken as well as numerous extended family members.\n\nA memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. Sunday, June 16, 2024 at Our Lady of Victory Catholic Church with visitation one-hour prior to the service at the church.\n\nAssistance provided by Olson Funeral and Cremation, Fergus Falls.\n\nOnline condolences may be sent to www.olsonfuneralhome.com"
