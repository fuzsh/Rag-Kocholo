The Cease Family Funeral Home of Bagley assisted the family with arrangements.\n\nJohn was born on June 17, 2022, in Bemidji, MN, to Matthew and Heather (Pixler) Leavell.\n\nJohnny loved his family. He loved snuggling with Dad in the evening. His favorite toys were whatever his brother and sisters had, especially cars, school buses and tractors. He loved his chickens and gardening with Mommy. He had a special bond with, and loved his daycare family. John attended and was loved by Thriving Life Church.\n\nHis light shone bright in his life and he will be tremendously missed.\n\nJohn is survived by his parents, Matt and Heather Leavell; his siblings, Elizabeth, David, and Emelia; his grandparents, Suzen Pixler, and Randy and Diane Leavell; his adoptive grandparents, Terry and Loralee Nennich; his great grandpa, Carl Leavell; and many aunts uncles, cousins, and other loved family members.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his grandfather, David Pixler.\n\nMessages of condolence may be sent to ceasefuneralhome.com\n\nErick (“Doc”) Reeber, who lived his childhood dream of being a small-town country doctor, passed away peacefully in his sleep at age 93 surrounded by family.\n\nErick was born in Brooklyn, NY, the child of immigrants Paul (Pinchas) and Ray (Rivka) (nee Schacter) Reeber. Erick grew up in a tiny one room studio apartment behind the corner drugstore his father ran. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School at age 16, then won a New York Regents Scholarship, attending the University of Buffalo with a major in mathematics. In his junior year of college, he was awarded a Regents Scholarship covering the cost of medical school and received his Doctor of Medicine from the University of Buffalo in 1956.\n\nWhile an undergraduate, he met and fell in love with Jane Mitchell Larke. They soon married and remained married until her death in 2012. Together, they had four children.\n\nAfter medical residency in Elmira, NY, Erick joined the Navy Medical Corps where he was stationed in San Francisco and sailed the Pacific Ocean. When his active duty ended, he continued in the Navy Reserves achieving the rank of Commander before retiring from service after 34 years. While serving his country, he earned the Armed Forces Service Medal for his years of service.\n\nHe joined a medical practice in Thief River Falls, MN in 1959, followed by a solo practice in Frazee, MN.\n\nIn 1964, he joined the Clearwater Clinic in Bagley, MN where he built up his practice, eventually leaving to again have a solo practice in Bagley. He kept the clinic open until 1995 when he “retired”.\n\nErick loved all aspects of medicine, whether delivering babies, figuring out a subtle medical issue that other doctors missed, serving on the local hospital board, or working with other doctors to address issues in health care.\n\nAnd, yes, he made house calls, sometimes via snowmobile.\n\nHe took great pride in having some of the lowest fees of any family doctor in Minnesota and was happy to take a jar of honey or a side of beef as payment. For financially struggling patients, as long as they had always made monthly payments (even just a dollar a month), he sometimes provided a small low interest loan to cover an emergency expense.\n\nHe was considered an excellent doctor, not only by his patients, but by other doctors as well for his ability to diagnose difficult cases. Specialists to whom he had referred patients sometimes wrote to tell him, “If you had not told me where to look, I would not have found the problem.” Yet, when the University of Minnesota’s Medical School asked him to join their faculty, he said he preferred to remain a small-town country doctor. After closing his practice, he continued to fill in at the VA hospital until he had a small stroke at age 69. He remained active on many medical and cultural boards well into his eighties.\n\nIn 2014, he moved to Grand Forks to Valley Senior Living on 42nd street, where he was known for his stories, jokes, and poetry recitations.\n\nErick was also an avid stamp collector, bird watcher, and supporter of local cultural, scientific, educational, and art organizations. The Royal Philatelic Society of London made him a Fellow for his contributions to the understanding of Madagascar British Consular Mail. He and Jane traveled the world to bird watch. He served for many years on the board of “Farm by the Lake” in Bagley and contributed to many other local organizations.\n\nSurviving him is his brother Morton (Zelda) Reeber, his sister-in-law Anne Schneider, four children–Larke (Jack Fendell) Reeber, Katherine (Leo) Arnold, Andrew (Debbie) Reeber, Martha (Van) Janway, eight grandchildren–Crystal (Ron) Blue, Erick (Emily) Arnold, May Fendell, Caitlin (Jason) Buschmann, Samuel (Soumya Suresh) Fendell, Rae Vander Werf, Corianne (Josh) Petersen, Benjamin Reeber, eight great-grandchildren, one foster great-grandchild, four nieces and nephews, and five great-nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his wife, his parents, and an infant granddaughter.\n\nBurial was at Fort Snelling on July 15 with full military honors. His wife Jane’s ashes were interred with him. There will be a memorial event for both of them in Bagley on September 14. For details, email reebermem@yahoo.com or call 218-308-6361. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that contributions be made to the “Farm by the Lake” in Bagley or another cultural, educational, scientific, or art organization.\n\nJustin Aaron Lindgren, 43, son of Doug & Colleen Lindgren of Bagley, passed away in Tempe, AZ on June 21, 2024.\n\nFuneral services will be held on Friday, July 12th, 3 p.m. at the Cease Family Funeral Home in Bagley. Visitation will be held one hour before the service. Lunch will be served immediately following the service in the Bagley American Legion Auditorium. Burial will be in the Bagley City Cemetery at a later time.\n\nJustin was born June 23, 1980, at the Clearwater County Memorial Hospital in Bagley. He graduated from Bagley High School in 1998, Bemidji Vo-Tec, and attended Bemidji State University for several years. He worked in the food and beverage industry for many years in the Bemidji/Duluth area where he made some amazing friends, and many became like family to him. He also was a Service Writer for Firestone Tires in Duluth before he moved to Phoenix, AZ, in January of 2015 where he worked for several different restaurants and finally for the last 4.5 years at Dick’s Sporting Goods as an Order Fulfillment Manager.\n\nHe is survived by his parents; Doug & Colleen (Smith) Lindgren of Bagley; brother Jeremiah Lindgren of Fargo, ND; sister Rebekah (Jhonny) Jimenez of Clearbrook; niece Payton Jimenez; nephew Johnny Jimenez; special “adopted” niece Sadie of Phoenix; God Father Lyle Smith and God Mother Marie Boon; many special aunts, uncles, cousins, too many friends to list and his beloved fur baby Lunna who saw him through all the highs and lows after his precious dog Tessa passed.\n\nJustin loved hugs and gave them to everyone. Whether you wanted one or not he just knew you needed or wanted one and you got it. He loved spending time with his friends in Phoenix no matter what they were doing (especially if it involved sports such as watching the Twins, Dodgers or the Cleveland Browns, for some reason), off-road jeeping with Cole Christensen, watching TV/hanging out or spending time with Marlon Chee on the Shooting range, telling bad jokes or going out to eat as both guys were so very special to him. He loved phone calls and just talking whether to family or friends. One other pass time was calling his siblings with jokes, starting to laugh and simply hanging up just to call back a bit later with another. The sad part of all this is that Justin was moving home the middle of July to begin a new job in Fargo after being away for 9 years.\n\nJustin will be missed by so many people he touched in one way or another. “Remember all the good times.” he would say and he always knew if you needed a hug. So, just ask and he will send one down to you from the Heavens.\n\nHe is joining his Grandparents, Cousins, Tessa and other family and friends in Heaven.\n\nMarilyn Jean Lewis was born on April 18, 1932 in Bagley, MN. Her parents were Oscar Edward Lewis, an attorney, and Laura Margaret (Jensen) Lewis, a teacher.\n\nMarilyn was also known as Jeanie when she was growing up.

Marilyn attended Bagley High School, graduating in 1950 as the valedictorian in her class. In high school she received awards for Instrumental Music, Band, Speech, Vocal Music, and Hi-Life.\n\nAfter high school Marilyn attended Macalester College, where she met Edward Rasmussen.

Marilyn loved talking to anyone she met, and the funnier and cleverer the conversation could get, the better.\n\nShe was an avid water skier and snowmobiler while she lived in Bagley, raising her family. After moving to the Twin Cities, she became an avid cross-country skier, skiing on many beautiful trails around Minnesota. She loved any time with her kids, grandkids and great grandkids. She had many fall “leafing” trips around Lake Itasca and the North Shore, as well as many fishing trips to Upper Red Lake with her kids. Marilyn enjoyed traveling with friends and daughters to other fun and beautiful places.\n\nMarilyn is survived by her four children: Jon Rasmussen (Deborah Capouch) of Bloomington; Pamela Rasmussen (James Johnson) of Minnetonka; Paul Rasmussen (Cynthia Mireault) of Bagley; and Susan Rasmussen (Karl Erickson), of Blackduck; six grandchildren: Harmony Kane (Stephen); Amanda Phakonkham (Says); Derek Rasmussen; Katrina Rasmussen; Justen Rasmussen (Michelle); and Laura Hawk (Jared); and five great-grandchildren: Ava, Ian, and Eli Phakonkham, Saoirse Kane, and Harper Hawk.

Visitation will be two hours prior to the service. Interment will be at the Shevlin City Cemetery in Shevlin, MN under the direction of the Cease Family Funeral Home in Bemidji.\n\nKeith was born on September 6, 1947, to Douglas and Jennie (Wobbema) Barcus in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. In 1956, they moved the family to Shevlin, Minnesota. Keith was baptized and confirmed at the Clearwater Lutheran Church in Shevlin. Keith attended Shevlin Elementary School and Bagley High School, graduating in 1965. In 1966, Keith was drafted into the United States Army and served his country with honor during the Vietnam War from 1967 to 1968. After serving his Country, Keith attended the VoTech in Bemidji for carpentry. His first job was with Nu Ply. Keith then worked for Northwestern Bell and retired from Quest Telephone in 2004. Keith married Linda (Clemenson) Barcus on January 21, 1983, in Nashville, Tennessee. Together they joined their loving families. He was a shining example of what it means to be a loving husband, dad, father-in-law and grandpa!\n\nKeith loved the great outdoors! He was known as “Rambo” by all his family and friends. He had the most loving heart and was a friend to everyone he met. In the fall, he would spend time hunting on his family farm in Shevlin with his kids and grandkids. Montana was another favorite spot to hunt with his hunting buddies. After retirement, he spent many years traveling to Colorado, elk guiding for Beaver Creek Outfitters. Most recently, he hunted at his son’s farm in Pinewood from his Taj Mahal deer stand. During the winter months, Keith would be the first one to brave the ice to set up the spear house on Lake Bemidji while the rest of us were bringing in our docks. Besides spearing northern, he was the self-appointed lake road crew making sure all the roads were plowed for everyone to get to their fish houses. In the spring and summer months he spent endless hours at his Family Resort – Wildview Lodge on Little Island Lake in the Bovey area. His kids and grandkids have amazing memories, great life lessons, hunting and fishing, driving the golf cart, gardening, swimming with the cousins, and visiting with all the resort guests. Recently, Keith became known as the “King of Gopher Trapping,” rising at dawn to tirelessly control the critters plaguing local farmers. Known for his incredible luck, Keith seemed to win a gun at every banquet he attended. Keith had simple pleasures too; he found joy in watching Wheel of Fortune and spent his evenings checking his gopher traps.\n\nKeith was truly like no other. His loyalty to his family and friends was unparalleled, a testament to his generous spirit and kind heart. His bond with veterans was deep-rooted and meaningful. Throughout his life, Keith demonstrated immense strength and resilience, particularly in his journey to overcome the scars of war. His active participation in the Vietnam PTSD group not only provided him with a support network, but also played a crucial role in his life. Keith found solace and companionship in his fellow veterans, as they shared their experiences, hardships, and triumphs. Additionally, Keith was an avid member of the In Country Vietnam Motorcycle Club. Keith’s involvement in these groups not only brought him joy and purpose but also served as a testament to his unwavering resilience and determination. Every year, he eagerly participated in the Ride for the Troops, always riding behind the group to assist anyone whose bike encountered engine trouble.\n\nKeith is survived by his beloved wife Linda and leaves behind a cherished legacy in his children and grandchildren: Sheila (John) Eckman and their children Kendra (Cameron) and Caden of Fosston, Minnesota; Mandi Fontaine (Jarrod) and her children Brendyn (Alex) Scouton and Sean (Rylee) Fontaine, great-grandchildren Carter and Luca of Wrenshall, Minnesota; Eric (Jana) Norgaard and their children Matthew and Jack of Bemidji, Minnesota; and Chris (Jenny) Norgaard and their children Addie & Gunnar of Bismark, North Dakota.

She made new friends easily and they were an eclectic group, varying from Japanese anime fans to aspiring WWE wrestlers. While working at Blockbuster, she had to learn how to pronounce “bag” in an East Coast accent, as the customers did not understand her when she asked in her MN accent, “do you wanna ‘beg’ for that?” Sarah enjoyed going to movies, hanging out with her friends and touring local historic sites with her big sister, such as the memorials in Washington, D.C. Sarah enjoyed her time on the East Coast, but decided to move back to Bagley, MN to be closer to the rest of her family in 2004.\n\nOn September 2, 2006, Sarah married Jerod Anderson at the home of Jill and Jeff Anderson.

Johnson “Johnny” (B. 03/27/1934; D. 06/15/2024) died at the age of 90. He was the son of Nels and Dena (Sunderland) Johnson. Born and raised on a small farm north of Bagley, he obtained his GED at age 30. He was drafted into the Army in January 1957 and honorably discharged 2 years later. Like many at the time, it was his first adventure outside of the county and it started with train and bus rides to Seattle, WA for training before his post in Germany. He did a lot of driving there and when he returned home, he stopped in Minneapolis for his first used car. He met Nancy Harmon in Bagley and they married on March 12, 1965. The west was calling to both of them, so they hooked up their small trailer and followed Hwy 2 the 1,000 miles to Kalispell, MT where they made their home until she passed in October 2016. They had been married over 51 years. They were devoted to each other and poured countless hours of love and attention onto whichever small white dog they were raising at the time. They both learned to play acoustic and bass guitar and provided worship services for nursing home residents. Johnny believed in the healing power of prayer and maintained that deep faith and ability to pray even when all other memories had faded.\n\nJohnny made a career out of his ability to repair small engines. He continued fixing and repairing small engines into their retirement years by buying used items at garage sales, fixing and painting them to look new with Nancy doing the bookkeeping. By far, their most notable sale was a riding lawnmower to singer/actor Jim Nabors. They even had a chance to play music while he sang on their front porch.\n\nThey made several trips back to MN to visit family and friends and welcomed all when we ventured to their neck of the woods. They used their camper to winter in Arizona a few times and made several national park trips with Nancy’s mother, Ida. Johnny could be a bit of a clown – climbing a tree like a monkey into his 50’s or riding a bicycle sitting on the seat backwards. That’s probably when he developed his favorite phrase “I don’t know if I’m a’comin or a’goin.” He and Nancy played a lot of pool and worked on several jigsaw puzzles when there wasn’t a garden or lawn that needed tending. Garage and auction sales provided plenty of opportunities to spend their free time and find great finds for their engine repair business. They also did daily Bible devotions together.\n\nFamily moved Johnny to MN when it became apparent that his memory loss was more than he could handle. He had been alone for almost five years and felt so blessed and happy to be surrounded by staff and other residents at the memory care assisted living in Monticello. He provided piano music daily to staff and residents until he lost the ability with a bout of COVID.\n\nJohnny is survived by sisters-in-law, Carol Olsen (Staples, MN) and Carrie Harmon (Clearbrook, MN), and several nephews and nieces.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents; wife, Nancy; sister, Joyce Dobson; nephew, Allen Dobson; and brothers-in-law, Alvin (Betty) Harmon, David Harmon, and Donald Olsen.\n\nA Celebration of Life is planned for both Johnny and Nancy on Sunday, June 23, 2024, at Saron Lutheran Church, 311 Lake St S, Big Lake, MN 55309, at 1:00 pm followed by a luncheon. A burial service will be held in Kalispell, MT on a later date.\n\nThe Peterson-Grimsmo Funeral Chapel in Monticello, MN is assisting with arrangements. www.peterson-grimsmochapel.com.\n\nAdeline May Gohl Beltz passed away peacefully on June 8, 2024, at Sanford Bemidji Medical Center with her daughter Kim at her side.\n\nAdeline was born May 31, 1933, at home in southeast Bagley to Joseph and Beata Gohl (delivered by midwife Feranda Foldo a neighbor).

He grew up in Fosston and graduated from Fosston High School in 1956. Following high school, Bruce was a merchant marine on ships in the Great Lakes.\n\nBruce entered the United States Army in September of 1961. He received his honorable discharge in September of 1963 and relocated to Cedar Rapids, Iowa where he worked at Collins Radio. In 1968, while in Springfield, Iowa, he was walking to his car and was struck by a drunk driver. He suffered a traumatic injury that left him with a long recovery.\n\nBruce purchased a place south of Bagley where he operated a sawmill for 15 years. He remembered his days on the Great Lakes and the polluted waters that he encountered. So, at the age of 51, Bruce went to Bemidji State University and majored in aquatic biology. He graduated in 1994 and was immediately hired as an observer, trained in Seattle, Washington, and was sent out to sea. He worked and had many experiences off the coast of Alaska. After his retirement, he returned to his 80 acres south of Bagley. In 2021, he moved in to Bagley.\n\nBruce was an avid reader and liked to study history. His dog, Shadow, was his constant companion and never left his side.\n\nSurvivors include his sister, Madreen Evans of Plymouth, MN; numerous nieces and nephews and many friends; and his friend and caregiver, Merry. Also surviving him is his dog, Shadow.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents; and three brothers, Arlon, Walton, and Winton.\n\nHarold Joseph Shellum, a husband, father, and friend, died peacefully on March 30, 2024, at 105 years old.\n\nHarold was born in 1919 and grew up with five siblings in Minnesota, where he studied in Bagley and graduated with math and social studies degrees from Bemidji State Teacher’s College in 1941. During this time, Harold also developed a lifelong interest: football, which he played, coached, and later devoutly watched for the rest of his life.\n\nAfter a brief stint teaching, Harold entered the Army Air Force at the onset of WWII, bypassing basic training. After a minor detour in the service, he was admitted to the Cadet program and the University of Chicago for Meteorology training. Upon completion of his cadet program, Harold was initially sent to New Guinea, and after that he followed the war throughout the South Pacific Theater, forecasting the weather for the pilots in such locations as Australia, the Admiralty Islands, the Philippines, Okinawa, and Korea. Harold remained in the reserves after WWII ended, during which time he was promoted from First Lieutenant to Captain. He was hired into the US Weather Bureau in 1947 until he was called to Active-Duty status in 1952 for the Air Force, then resumed his work after being honorably discharged in 1953. Harold worked for the National Weather Service until his retirement in 1979, living in Colorado, Maryland, and finally, California, where he, his wife Ruth, and two daughters Roberta and Cynthia settled. Harold ended his weather bureau career as a Lead Forecaster at the San Francisco station.\n\nHarold’s life was so much more colorful than just his military and career accomplishments. Wherever he went, he was funny, kind, and sociable, befriending others and becoming involved in his community. He met his lifelong partner Ruth on a road trip to California. Married in 1947, they moved several times with Harold’s career advances. Since they lived far away from their families in Minnesota, many vacations were spent visiting their families in the Bagley area and the Appleton area- and on the way Harold insisted the family visit many of the National Parks. In retirement, Harold and Ruth continued to love traveling, once again visiting family and treasured old friends in many different locations.\n\nAfter 63 years of marriage, at the age of 92, Harold lost his beloved wife Ruth to cancer. Adjusting to a new life as a widower, he continued to play pinochle with the guys. He kept up his hobby of woodworking- making an altar and plant stand, and other cabinetry for his church. He also took up swimming at the YMCA in Monrovia until the age of 101, when the pool closed in the pandemic. He loved seeing family and was thrilled to be asked to represent 2 decades of football alumni at Bemidji State U and to be the Grand Marshall of the Homecoming parade when he was 96. He was so happy that many family members and old friends made it to California to celebrate his 100th birthday. He made several trips back to MN to see family- his last one being at the age of 103!! Always, exercising, he kept moving until 3 ½ weeks before he passed away. Harold had been a singer his whole life but in his old age he was frequently caught humming and singing old hymns and melodies.\n\nTo his friends and family, Harold’s impressive ability to recall facts and numbers was unmatched. He could recite facts and information from decades past, and recount stories as if they were recent accounts. This benefited historians as he was able to share his military experience with the Library of Congress as a WWII veteran.\n\nSuffice it to say, Harold never stopped being a light to those around him. In his 105 years, he cultivated a life of friends and family who remember him fondly and admirably, from his singing to his service in the Air Force to his commitment to God and the love for his entire family. Though Harold’s wife Ruth and seven siblings preceded him in death, his legacy lives on in his daughters Roberta and Cindy (Jim), grandchildren Gretchen (Louis), Kari (Michael), Christian (Gabby), Jenny (Travis), Elizabeth (Ryan), Keira, and eight great-grandchildren.\n\nA Celebration of Harold’s life is planned at the American Legion Hall in Bagley, MN at 11:30 am, June 9, 2024, with lunch to follow. If planning to attend, please RSVP to Marilyn Ames at 218-407-2086.\n\nAlice Effie Ramsrud, 101, of Bagley, Minnesota died on Thursday, January 11, 2024, at the Sanford Bemidji Medical Center in Bemidji, Minnesota.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held on (Alice’s 102 Birthday) Saturday, June 1, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. at Bethel Lutheran Church in Bagley, Minnesota.

He learned a variety of skills while there (including dog robber? haha), logging and other conservation skills and living in a military type setting.\n\nGerald was in Oslo, MN working on his car when he said, “Ma came out and told me the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, and I knew my fate was sealed”. He joined the US Navy in 1942 and served aboard the Destroyer, US Arleigh Burke, as a 40MM gunner and was a planker (the first crew to serve aboard a new naval vessel). Gerald received numerous medals and war time ribbons, including a purple heart. History also shows that the squadron of destroyers he served with, received a Presidential Citation for the most perfect battle in Naval History at the Battle of Cape St. George, which is still used today to train Naval tactics. When a plane was shot down, and the crew of his destroyer rescued the pilot, the pilot’s name was Pappy Boyington.\n\nWhen the war ended, Gerald left his shipmates in 1946 and came back to MN, where in 1947 he married his soul mate Edna Davis. When the young couple homesteaded in Clover Township, Gerald cut the trees, cleared the land, and built a small cabin himself. Gerald and Edna raised three sons: Jerry L, Joel, and Steve. Through the years Gerald farmed and was a logger and later a cement mason. When formal training was not an option to learn masonry, Gerald prayed that God would teach him and he became a natural at his trade, and even worked in supervisory positions.\n\nGerald served in the capacity of the township clerk in Clover for 60 years. He and Edna were charter members of Clover Chapel. In later years, they became members of the First Baptist Church of Clearbrook. He was a longtime member of the Clearbrook Legion Post 256, a life member of the Bemidji VFW Post 1260, and a life Member of Bemidji DAV.

He had an older sister, Anna. He was baptized at Little Norway Lutheran Church of rural Fertile before moving with his family to the farm south of Fosston in 1943. He attended Willow Grove Country School through 8th grade before earning his diploma from Fosston High School in 1958. He was confirmed in his faith at Hope Lutheran Church in Fosston. As a boy, he enjoyed drawing pictures of bucking broncos and rodeos he imagined, participating in all kinds of 4-H activities, riding horse, trapping around the lake, and singing baritone in the school choir.\n\nAfter high school, he dairy and grain farmed with his father and grandfather briefly before enlisting in the Army and serving at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico until 1965. After discharge, Oran returned home to Fosston where he resumed farming alongside his father, purchasing the operation from his parents in 1977 and continuing until 1997. Oran was united in marriage to Geri Mahto on November 22, 1980, at First Baptist Church in Clearbrook, Minnesota. After their marriage, he lived with Geri and her two children, Kris and Robin, on the farm and they welcomed their daughter, Sarah, in 1981. Together, Oran and Geri enjoyed participating in church functions, growing a garden, serving on the Rosebud Township Board, visiting and playing games with friends, and watching the kids in all their school activities. Geri passed away in 2003.\n\nAfter farming, Oran drove a medical transportation van for several years, which allowed him to get to know many new people in various towns in the area. He was known for his personable, patient, and gentle care of the people he transported. It was through this work that he was fortunate to meet Bonnie Cudmore, a nurse in Bagley. Bonnie and Oran were married at Faith Lutheran Church in Bagley, Minnesota on September 30, 2005. Oran then moved into town where they lived until his passing. Together, Bonnie and Oran enjoyed traveling and spending time with Bonnie’s three children, Kristin, Scott, and Michelle and their families. They took up bowling and would often take day trips around the area where they would visit quilt shops (for Bonnie) and find cafes to eat at (for Oran). Along the route, Oran would check out and comment on how crops were growing. He was forever a farmer. Later in life, Oran drove school bus for the Fosston School District. Oran enjoyed his grandchildren, Ben and Heidi, and was always, always there to help Sarah and Tom with anything they needed.\n\nOran loved northwestern Minnesota, Coca-Cola and donuts, being a devoted husband, dad, and grandpa, hearing jokes, Sarah’s lap dog, Max, and his generational farm he was extremely proud to pass on. Most of all, though, Oran loved people and being of quiet service to others. Alzheimer’s somehow could not alter these special things about him. He will be deeply missed.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his wife, Geri Underdahl, his parents, Art and Alvina Underdahl, his sister, Anna, as well as several beloved members of his extended family.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Bonnie Underdahl; daughter, Sarah (Tom) Steinbrenner, grandchildren, Ben and Heidi; stepchildren Kris (Ana) Culton, Rob (Jessica) Mahto, Kristin (Kirk) Willberg, Scott Cudmore, and Michelle Cudmore, several step-grandchildren and step-great grandchildren; and a few dear cousins.\n\nGary Trisco Sr., 77, of Wilton, MN passed away on Thursday, April 18, 2024, at Bemidji Sanford Medical Center under hospice care.\n\nFuneral services will be held on Monday, April 29, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. at the Cease Family Funeral Home Chapel in Bagley, MN.

He was baptized at St. Joseph’s Catholic Church in Bagley on March 2, 1947.\n\nHe was raised by his grandparents Leo and Frances Trisco on a farm on the Clearwater/Beltrami County line in Shevlin Township. This was where he first got introduced to working the soil and driving, which were his true passions.\n\nOn Mach 30, 1968, he married Gladys Traaseth in Shevlin. To this union three children were born Christopher, Angela, and Gary. They later divorced and he and Bonnie Collins added twin boys Colin and Everett in 1996 to complete his family.\n\nGary attended grade school in Shevlin and Bagley starting in seventh grade. Books were not his thing and he stayed on the farm helping his grandparents and neighbors with milking cows and working the fields.\n\nAt 18 he went to work for Darst Inc. in the potato fields near Gonvick. Soon after he bought his own tandem wood truck with a wire boom to haul wood. Truck driving was in his blood as he then hired on to drive for Fillipi truck lines out of Warren, and back to Clearwater County to drive for Bagley Trucking. In the early 1970’s he purchased his own semi-truck and started hauling grain mostly to Duluth. Wood hauling was still an interest as he bought a trailer with a center mount boom and did custom hauling. Later he would lease his truck to Gessell Concrete out of Bagley and haul cement from Duluth. Nearing retirement he went to work for Danny Wilde working the fields and breathing in the aroma of the soil and the crops. He never lost his passions for working the soil and truck driving.\n\nHe is survived by his children, Christopher Trisco, Angie (Reg) Wallin, Gary (Renee) Trisco, Collin Trisco, and Everett Trisco; grandchildren, Kristi Trisco, Amaris Trisco, Taylen Trisco, Celina Trisco, Alexia Theis, and Lindsey Theis; mother, Lorraine Schlosser; brother Larry Trisco; sisters, Julie (Scott) Anderson and Jody Caldwell.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his father Glenden, grandparents, infant sister, brother Kenny Trisco, and granddaughter Katherine Trisco Leckner.\n\nMessages of condolence may be sent to ceasefuneralhome.com.\n\nCaroline Frances Bakke (Geller), 91, of passed away on February 14, 2024, at the St. Cloud Hospital in St. Cloud, Minnesota.\n\nMemorial Services will be held on Saturday, May 4, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. at the Cease Family Funeral Home Chapel in Bagley, Minnesota with a visitation one hour prior.

She grew up the middle child of seven siblings, attended Bagley School and graduated in 1968. After high school, Peggy’s heart guided her to enroll in the Bemidji Area Vocational Technical Institute for nursing where she graduated with her LPN license. On April 3rd, 1970, Peggy married her high school sweetheart Clyde Lloyd Knutson in Grand Rapids, MN. Together they settled and built a home southwest of Bagley which they filled with what she cherished most, their four children. She continued working as an LPN through the birth of their three boys but in 1980 after the birth of their daughter she found the saying “boys are easier” to be true! It was at this time she chose instead to focus on taking care of her kids, later working as a nurse’s aide in the late 80’s and then working part time at the family owned, Bagley Bakery, up until her cancer diagnosis in 2022.\n\nPeggy enjoyed many hobbies but none more than spending time with her family, even her husband believe it or not! Camping at Long Lake, Heart Lake & her son Patrick’s cabin; ranger rides wherever the roads and trails would take them; enjoying her son Brian’s homemade pizza invites, sucker spearing every May over her birthday with the whole Knutson & Maruska clans. She loved to travel and covered nearly the whole state of Arizona on adventures while visiting her son Shawn, including for the birth of 2 of her grandkids. Peggy loved Irish music and a trip to Ireland in 2000 left a lasting appreciation for her family’s heritage along with a trip to Scotland with her sister two years later in 2002. Even her more modest hobbies included being dragged on shopping and craft show excursions with her daughter Heather, chatting with friends and family on the computer or iPad while playing games and even a little stop here or there at the casino with her daughter, sister, brother or grand-daughters. As one can tell, the theme to Peggy’s hobbies was always simply that she loved her family and spending time with them any way possible. When she couldn’t, she would read books until all hours of the night or work on her diamond painting in her quiet time.\n\nThose who knew Peggy well understood that her sense of humor came with a sassy, spunky and spicy attitude! She had a knack for banter and could disarm even the most staunch of pessimists. Being argumentative and playful in the most endearing of ways was a specialty unique to her. Peggy was all these things because she approached every day and each person in her life with the love she held in her heart. It is for this reason her absence will be so profoundly missed in the lives of her family and friends, and yet the love she shared will continue to be carried in us all.\n\nPeggy is survived by her husband of 53 years, Clyde Knutson of Bagley, MN; her sons Brian Knutson of Bagley, MN; Patrick (Michelle) Knutson of Bagley, MN; Shawn (Becky) Knutson of Mesa, AZ; and her daughter Heather (Michael) Stenseng of Clearbrook, MN. 7 grandchildren and 2 great grandchildren.
