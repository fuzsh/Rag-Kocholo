This new facility will make it easier for residents to reduce, reuse, repair and recycle. The existing mobile household hazardous waste collection sites will not continue after 2024. Read more.\n\nMany household products you use to clean your kitchen and bathroom, maintain your car and home, and control animals and insects contain hazardous materials. If a container has the words caution, warning, danger or poison on the label and still has product inside, it is considered hazardous and does not belong in the trash. Bring these items to Ramsey County's free household hazardous waste collection sites for safe disposal.\n\nAll empty containers, except propane tanks, may be placed in the trash.\n\nAll propane tanks (full or empty) can be brought to Ramsey County's free household hazardous waste collection sites for safe disposal.\n\nGas cans and other fuel containers will not be returned at mobile collection sites. Pick them up later at our year-round collection site in Saint Paul or use that site directly when dropping of gasoline."
