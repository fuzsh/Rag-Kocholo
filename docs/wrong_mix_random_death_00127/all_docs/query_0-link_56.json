        "text": "Advanced Estate Planning Techniques in Minnesota\n\nIrrevocable Life Insurance Trusts (ILIT)\n\nAn irrevocable life insurance trust is a type of trust designed to own a life insurance policy. The purpose of an irrevocable life insurance trust is to remove the value of the life insurance policy from the estate while still allowing your family to benefit from the proceeds of that policy.\n\nAn irrevocable trust may not be cancelled or revoked. Most irrevocable trusts require that you select someone other than yourself to be the trustee. Since you are giving up control of the assets and will not be able to cancel this arrangement, the IRS does not include the assets of an Irrevocable trust in the grantorâ€™s estate for estate tax purposes.\n\nIf you have an estate that is close to having to pay estate tax, an ILIT is a great way to provide cash to the family to pay those estate taxes while not increasing the value of your gross estate.\n\nFamily Limited Partnerships\n\nBy using a Family Limited Partnership clients may be able to reduce their estate tax bill, maintain control over the assets owned in the Family Limited Partnership, and achieve asset protection for the assets held in the Family Limited Partnership. The idea is to control everything, but own nothing.\n\nBy transferring fractional interests to your family members during your life, you are able to take advantage of valuation discounts for lack of marketability and lack of control. These discounts are regularly recognized by the IRS. Family Limited Partnerships save estate taxes by discounting the value of limited partnership interests that you create and then gifting the discounted limited interests. You are using less of your Gift Tax Exemption by utilizing this strategy.\n\nOther Advanced Estate Planning Techniques\n\nWhile Irrevocable Life Insurance Trusts and Family Limited Partnerships are a couple of advanced planning techniques to minimize taxes and protect assets, there are many other advanced planning trusts including Charitable Remainder Trusts, Charitable Lead Trusts, Qualified Personal Residence Trusts, Domestic Asset Protection Trusts to name a few.\n\nIf you feel that your situation is complex, you should speak with a Minnesota estate planning attorney who is familiar with these planning concepts"
