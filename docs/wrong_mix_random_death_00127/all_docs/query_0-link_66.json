ALEXANDER9 BUTTERFIELD (CYRUS8, BENJAMIN7, BENJAMIN6, BENJAMIN5, JOSEPH4, BENJAMIN3, BENJAMIN2, BENJAMIN1) was born 9 March 1793 in NY333,334,335,336, and died 19 November 1867 in Newfane, Niagara Co, NY337,338. He married LUCINDA PEASE ~ 1814 in (NY), daughter of JOSIAH PEASE and NANCY PARSONS. She was born ~ 1798 in ME339,340,341, and died 19 November 1867 in Newfane, Niagara Co, NY342.\n\nNotes for ALEXANDER BUTTERFIELD:\n\nAlexander Butterfield and his wife Lucinda Pease Butterfield settled in the town of Kempville (later called Olcott), Niagara Co, NY, in 1814. In the same year he was acting Postmaster in Kempville. Niagara County Historian records show him to have been postmaster in 1817. U.S. Postal Service records show he was official Postmaster from 1820 to 1841. He owned and operated a tavern in Kempville in what is now Kruger Park, in 1819. He was elected \"Censor\" of the Niagara County Medical Society in 1823. He was appointed Commissioner of Schools when the town of Newfane, Niagara Co. NY was organized in 1824. He was Justice of the Peace sometime after 1824. He operated the Kempville Hotel in 1833.\n\nThe Codicil to Alexander Butterfield's will is dated 18 June 1866, but in the petition for probate it is stated he died in the town of Newfane, NY on or about 17 November 1856. There is some question naturally, as to when he died-one or the other must be a typographical error.\n\nSource: The Butterfield Family, Lucy Farris Heidenreich\n\n1850 Niagara Co, NY Census (roll 561 pg 409B), besides three of their children also living with Alexander and Lucinda Butterfield are: Nancy Holmes age 80, f, b.

Buel, Caleb Budlong, and James Warden presented certificates that entitled them to a public examination which was duly given and they were recommended to the Regents for the degree of M.D.\n\nIn 1818, these gentlemen qualified for a medical degree: David M.

Her early life was spent in Hatfield, IL, where she fitted herself for teaching. For about 8 years she successfully maintained as principal a flourishing seminary for young ladies. She relinquished her school to become thge wife of Wellington Butterfield. Their married life was spent at Lockport, NY, at Marquette and Horicon, WI and Minneapolis, Minn. From their home at Horicon, Mrs Butterfield for a quarter of a century dispensed a charming hospitality to a wide circle of admiring friends and acquaintances--a circle not bounded by state lines.\n\nSoon after her removal to Minneapolis, she and her husband became charter members of the Monday club, one of the three oldest literary clubs in the city, and to the work of this club she devoted the wealth of a mind enriched with stores of learning and wisdom, until her advancing years compelled her to relinquish the duties of active membership in the club. She and her husband were continued on the records of this club as honorary members, and this pre-eminence, vouchsafed to but few persons by this club, marks the esteem in which she has ever been held by the members and the large circle of those who are familiar with this club and its excellent literary work.

His Uncle, Wellington taught in Lockport, NY, so Milton may have taught in a school there.\n\nIn 1849 Milton and Martha settled in Troy, AL until the purchase of land in Union Springs, AL, where they opened their own school. Milton taught Math, Science, History, Government and Music. Milton continued to teach school until the outbreak of the War Between the States (1861). The War Dept records from the US Adjutant General's Office show him as Captain M. Butterfield, of the Alabama 23rd. The Alabama 23rd was captured at the Battle of Vicksburg (June or July 1863) and later exchanged. He stopped at his home in Union Springs prior to returning to the Confederate Army, this was the last time his family ever saw him.\n\nHe was attached to a scouting expedition during the siege of Atlanta. Milton was wounded at Stone Mountain, GA near Atlanta, on 19 August 1864, by unexploded shrapnel, while writing a letter to his wife, and died of his wounds. He was buried near Stone Mountain by his colored [sic] body-servant, Ward. The servant delivered the letter to Milton's wife Martha along with a letter from Milton's Commanding Officer. These letters were sent to the Department of Archives and History in Montgomery, AL and cannot now be located.\n\nThe servant Ward was never able to locate the grave when he and Martha Batchelder Butterfield went there after the war.\n\nSource: \"The Butterfield Family\" Lucy Farris Heidenreich\n\nMore About MILTON BUTTERFIELD: Burial: Unmarked Grave, Stone Mountain, GA\n\nCause of Death: KIA, Seige of Atlanta by unexploded shrapnel\n\nInterests/Hobbies: music\n\nMilitary Service: 12 October 1861, Enlisted Co B, 23rd Regiment, AL Infantry; 20 June 1862 appointed Captain435,436\n\nOccupation: Bet. 1845 - 1861, Teacher437,438\n\nProperty: 1850, Real Estate Value-$1000; 1860 Real Estate Value $10,000 & Personal Propery Value $5000439,440\n\nResidence: ~ 1848, Removed to Orion, Pike Co, AL; by 1860 Macon Co, AL\n\nNotes for MARTHA BATCHELDER: According to her diary Martha spent her childhood in Northfield, Franklin Co, Mass, with an aunt, and may have been an orphan. Her parentage has not been ascertained but it is assumed that she ties in somehow to the Bachilor family of New Hampshire. She was a school teacher, who in 1846, accepted a teaching position in or near the City of Lowndesboro, Lowndes Co, AL. During the summer of 1847 she took a boat on the river from Benton, Lowndes Co, AL to New Orleans, LA where she boarded a River Boat \"The Alexander Scott\". She travelled thus to Cincinnati, OH, and took an overland stage and the train cars to Sandusky, OH where a sister lived. Among her many stops was Lockport, NY. While in Niagara she took in the wonders of the Falls, and from her diary, a husband as well. She continued on her journey through the Erie Canal and arrived at Springfield, MA where she was met by another sister. She remained a few days and went on to Nashua, NH. Milton arrived there on 17 July 1847. They were married by Rev. D. D. Pratt.\n\nIn 1849 they settled in Troy, Pike Co, AL until the purchase of land in Union Springs, where they opened their own school. Martha taught French, Latin, English Literature and Geography.

Later, when I was ten years old, or in 1883, we moved back to Union Springs, and Cousin Ed [Edward Milton Butterfield], his wife and three girls were living there - Emmett, Estelle and Sunshine. There were the only kinfolk we had in the South, and so we very jealously claimed kin.\" \"...but I am glad that you wrote me. Where is Emmett?

The property was procured from the Foster Estate for the Episocpal Church and the Carnegie Library, permission was given by Mr Butterfield not to remove the graves but to build over them, several graves were on the spot and premission was granted from all those interested at the time the buildings were constructed. Now as to who is buried on this lot, I dont know.\n\nOn May 3rd 1879 my father repaired a gold watch for E.M.

Butterfield.\n\nThere were a few children in the family, it sees Emmett and Julian, he was quite a small boy and used to go to the country with a boy name Frank Hubbard and they hunted together, it seems the old home was on north Pararie Street and also down near what was know as the old Tom Martin home, just this other side of the bridge that crosses the Central of Ga R.R.\n\nMy oldest sister used to write us that she saw Ed Butterfield quite often and he must have moved to Birmingham, as the letter written here regarding the lots was from Birmingham, to let the graves remain.\n\nAs for as the school proposition the old teachers were a Mr McMurray, Prof McIver, M.R. Simmons and J.M. Banks, there were many private schools that I attended, being Misses Carrie and Nilla Norman, Miss Carrie Threadgill, Mrs McGowan, Mrs Honie, Mrs Mabson, Miss Kittie _ urch [Purch, Burch], these go back to the time I was 6 years old, and there was a Mrs Tanner, which I forgot to mention, your people may have been connected with one of the above. The name ACADEMY for a school came Later on. I am giving you the names of the oldest teachers.\n\nAs for the Millinary business these are the following names, Miss Mary Graves, Miss Kate Coleman, and my mother who was in the business when I was a small boy. The place she could have had a dress and milinary shop would have been the upper part of North Pararie St. that was where the shops were during those days, they were all wooden shacks and are torn away, and built up.\n\nYours very truly, Col.
