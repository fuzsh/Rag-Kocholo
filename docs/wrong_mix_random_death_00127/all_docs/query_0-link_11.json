There is also an 18 year old in the household named \"Grant\" Greenup. Frank's younger brother is named \"Edmond Grant\", so he may be the young man in their household. Edmond Grant was born Feb. 1867 [5]\n\nName 'Sex Age Race Est.

The census states that he emigrated from the US into Canada in 1909. His religion is Methodist, and his birth date is listed as December of 1860. This is doubtful, since he was six months old on the 1860 census (above), a census that was taken in June of 1860.\n\nName RoleSex Age Birthplace Frank Greenup HeadMale 51USA Fanny GreenupWife Female 38USA Edith Greenup Dau.

Senff on 20 Apr 1882 in Cass Co., MN. They had 6 children in the Gull River-Motley, Cass Co., MN area before moving to Grand Prairie Twp., Barnes Co., ND, where they had 4 more children. Elmira died there on 6 Jun 1903 when she was only 36 years old. She was buried in Morton Cemetery just up the road from their farm. Frank remarried to Fannie Heath of KY on 27 Nov 1908 and they moved to Alberta, Canada where they had 2 children, Benjamin Franklin Greenup Jr. who died when he was about 4 yrs. old, and Sybil Pansy Greenup-Demuelenaere, who lives in Canada.\n\nThe biography states that Benjamin Franklin Greenup lived near his daughter Edith Belle Kingsbury in Alberta, Canada. It gives the following information about his other children: His oldest daughter, Emma May Hurd-Schroeder lived in Paso Robles, CA. Son George Edwin Greenup died in the 1920 flu epidemic in Lansford, North Dakota, as did his wife, Ethel. Another son, Charles Benjamin Greenup disappeared after the death of his mother, and was heard from only a couple of times after that.
