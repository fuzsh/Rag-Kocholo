        "text": "By JUDY BUSWICK\n\nLONDON — If you’ve been to London and seen the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace, circled skyward on the London Eye, and marveled at the wax figures in Madame Tussaud’s, then put the Benjamin Franklin house on your list of places to see on your next trip to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe newly refurbished boarding house where Franklin lived for almost 16 years is not far from Trafalgar Square. Opened in January to commemorate Franklin’s 300th birthday, this house is so new on the tourist scene that hotel concierges and an information booth receptionist had to look up the street address on-line for some visitors in my tour group in late-March.\n\nUnlike most historical houses, this museum tour relies predominantly on audio-visual projections and a costumed guide who is more theatre than fact-teller, though she divulges “the essentials of Benjamin Franklin’s life,” as one visitor reported.\n\nThe Georgian townhouse is on quiet Craven Street, somehow sequestered from the double-decker buses and commuters at nearby Charing Cross Station. The house has little furniture, merely a chair or two for props. There are no paintings on the walls, nor elaborate window treatments. But you are engaged from the moment you walk in.\n\nTour groups of up to 12 meet in the Arches, a vaulted tunnel between Villiers and Craven Streets. Hopefully a sign will soon point inside to the New Players Theatre box office, where the tour gathers. Our group of six was soon entering the front door of Franklin’s boarding house, distinguished from its adjoining house fronts only by a brass plaque and a small sign on the fence.\n\nOnce inside, we were cautioned to be careful on the steep, narrow stairs that led to the basement kitchen room. Here we found the obligatory plaque of Franklin’s history (the only reading on the tour), a small cabinet of artifacts, and a glass-box hole in the floor showing bones discovered during renovations. (One of the boarding house tenants had run an anatomy school.) Promptly, a four-minute video was offered to outline the causes of the American Revolution and the contributions of Benjamin Franklin as statesman, scientist, inventor, philosopher, and writer.\n\nThe door opened and we were greeted by the bewigged and costumed Polly Stevenson, the daughter of Franklin’s landlady and (later) wife of Doctor Hewson who ran the anatomy school. With Polly, we entered Mrs. Stevenson’s parlor on the first floor. Slides were projected across the mantel top and onto shuttered windows, as Polly spoke with the invisible inhabitants in the house, revealing her appreciation of Dr. Franklin. We learn that he discussed his science experiments with her, praised her upcoming marriage, and later advised her on child-rearing techniques. Polly never spoke to us.\n\nAs we moved between rooms and upstairs to Dr. Franklin’s parlor, we learned about the Enlightenment and the topics that captured Franklin’s interest. Sound projections included household noises and the voices and footsteps of guests coming to talk about science.\n\nRevered as a leading scientist in his day, Franklin suggested daylight savings time in 1784 (years before it was implemented in World War I). He created bifocals. He studied the Gulf Stream currents and winds, thus assisting sea captains, and he recommended fresh air and smallpox inoculations. Most famously, he studied lightning and the use of lightning rods as conductors of electricity. Familiar paintings depict him in a thunderstorm flying a kite with a key attached, and so “with a knuckle to the key” he made history.\n\nFranklin was in London on the eve of the American Revolution, working to find diplomatic solutions to the Crown’s taxation policies. His wife wrote to telling him of rioting in the streets of Philadelphia. His son wrote reminding him that law-abiding citizens live by established rules. His Craven Street home was the first de facto U.S. Embassy, but he had to flee as war was declared.\n\nAfter our 45-minute tour concluded, we stood outside watching the next group enter Franklin’s world. A woman from Los Angeles who had found the tour at the Charles Dickens House “boring” said, “Franklin was an amazing person. Even though I knew a lot about him, they (the house tour programmers) increased my interest.”\n\nA history teacher from California, praised the London Walks tour that he and his wife had taken the day before, but said this tour was “an interesting experience,” as well. And a tourist from Minneapolis explained that her mother in Arizona had sent her a news clipping about the Franklin House opening. She offered, “I’m glad I did come.”\n\nJudy Buswick is a free-lance writer who lives in Chelmsford."
