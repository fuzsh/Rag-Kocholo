        "text": "Making fun of corporate brands embarrassing themselves online is like shooting fish in a barrel. It’s not hard, but washing off the resulting splatter of blood, scales, innards and half-digested crab is, so no one wins.\n\nHonestly though, what the hell Franklin?\n\nReally?\n\nOK maybe Alphaville should tread carefully here, given some readers see our ~cough~ somewhat different approach to news and commentary as at odds with mainFT’s brand.\n\nBut like Meb Faber we prefer our trillion-dollar asset management groups to be boring. Stick to solid, sober and purportedly smart investing. Don’t tweet that 60/40 retirement portfolios should include “assets” where it gleefully says “speculation is a feature, not a bug”.\n\nEspecially when said asset manager was famously named after Benjamin Franklin, because according to founder Rupert Johnson he “epitomised the ideas of frugality and prudence when it came to saving and investing”.\n\nWe get that Franklin needs to revamp itself. Despite a spate of aggressive M&A swelling its assets to $1.4tn, its share price has sagged over the past decade, giving it a current market cap of $13.6bn. That’s less than AppLovin, Domino’s Pizza and the world’s biggest producer of frozen potato chips. It’s only barely enough for inclusion into the S&P 500.\n\nBeyond the obvious and well-documented challenges of being a very traditional active asset manager in a world that mostly loves alternatives and passive funds, Franklin also has a rep for being a bit old-fashioned.\n\nPromoting crypto therefore probably seems like an obvious, fellow-kids way to seem more cool and edgy.\n\nAnd yes, if those in charge of important stuff give control of the main X account to the bitcoin ETF’s hype team for a day, who really cares?\n\nBut we’d suggest that Franklin should have other priorities.\n\nWith about 40 per cent of its assets in fixed-income funds, Franklin could benefit from the peak-rates wave of money coming back into bonds. So it should focus on fixing poor performance there — Morgan Stanley points out that its five-year results have been mediocre — rather than fiddling around with crypto and devaluing its brand with silly laser-eyed stunts (it didn’t work for Tom Brady either)."
