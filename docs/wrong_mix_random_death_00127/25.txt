SUDDEN DEATH. - We are pained to learn of the death of Morris Lewis, of Turin, Lewis Co., New York, which occured on Saturday last at Foreston Fillmore County, Minnesota. The deceased was on a business visit in the West and had only a few weeks since bought considerable property in this place among which was a third of the Bank Block. He was a robust healthy looking man but caught a very severe cold which settled on his lungs and caused pneumonia of which disease he died as above stated. He was an old acquaintance of Mr. C. J. Paddock, of the firm of Paddock Bros, of this place; was strictly honest and a man of considerable wealth and influence, and had he lived would no doubt have been a permanent resident of Austin.

- A little boy, son of Mr. Litchfield, of Etna, Fillmore county, died suddenly on the night of June 3d. The physician thought it a case of sun-stroke, but it is possible that inhaling the fumes of slaughtered potato bugs was the cause of death; the boy had been thus engaged in the field.
