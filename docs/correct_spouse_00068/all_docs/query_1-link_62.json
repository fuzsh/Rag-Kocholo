        "text": "A couple of years ago we received an email from a reader with an account of her situation dealing with PTSD after infidelity. We had wanted to post her email back then but she felt that she wasn’t ready yet. Last week she wrote us again and decided it was time to share her story.\n\nHere it is…\n\nIs There a Time Limit for PTSD After Infidelity?\n\nby “mellowjello”\n\nIt’s been almost 4 years since Linda and Doug’s “D-Day”, and my husband’s and mine took place just a few months before theirs did. Four years! I can’t believe it! It’s been almost four years since my soul was destroyed, since my heart was cut into a million pieces.\n\nAfter 45 years of marriage—not the best, but certainly not the worst—the pain was indescribable. Both emotionally and physically. Fortunately, my husband’s affair lasted only 3-1/2 weeks. Unfortunately, it involved a young woman who was like family to us. She was like a daughter to me, someone I truly loved and had always nurtured and helped in any way I could.\n\nMy help consisted not only of emotional support and psychological help because she had emotional and psychological problems that were quite severe at times. I also provided financial support. I wanted my husband to love her as much as I did, even though he didn’t seem to care for her like I did, so I never told him of her problems such as bulimia, shop-lifting, compulsive activity, addictive behavior, etc. I had such good intentions.\n\nShattered\n\nThen my world shattered. I was destroyed. I won’t go into the details of how he came back home to me, but he had an awakening and he came back to me. I wanted and needed him to come home, but I was not the same person. I couldn’t understand everything that was happening to me both emotionally and physically.\n\nHe did his best to comfort me and to nurture me. My “illness” frightened him, but all he wanted to do was to make up in some way for what he had done. He made a commitment to me and I made one to him, because no matter what, everyone should know that it takes two people to make a marriage fail and it takes two people to make it successful.\n\nWe clung to each other as my horrible symptoms continued. I couldn’t keep any food down. I was frightened to death to leave the house, thinking that everyone was looking at me and that they all knew what a fool I had been and that I couldn’t keep my husband happy in my marriage.\n\nWhat Does Betrayal From Infidelity Have To Do With Posttraumatic Stress Syndrome?\n\nThe Lingering Shadows of the Past\n\nI had nightmares of the other woman and my husband every night for over a month. I would wake up in a sweat, then shivering that would start inside of me and my whole body would begin to shake uncontrollably. Next I would start to sob and no matter how I tried, I couldn’t stop.\n\nThis went on almost every night for almost a month before things started to slow down a bit. With the support of my husband, who never left my side during all of my recovery, I made it through the craziness.\n\nEmotional Turmoil and Seeking Support\n\nI am a very emotional person. Getting control of my emotions has never been an easy thing for me to do. During my recovery I have seen several therapists. They all tell me that by thinking about her I give her power, but they can’t tell me where the “on-off” switch is so I can turn off my thoughts of her.\n\nAt first hardly an hour in the day went by without my thinking of her and what she had planned over 10 years to do to me to steal my life. Then slowly, I thought of her less and less. Now, after almost four years, I still get triggers, but not as often as I used to.\n\nConfronting Memories in Familiar Places\n\nOne challenge is that we spent 43 years of our marriage in the town where she lives. We were born and raised there, so naturally, we often return for family events. These visits are tough for me. During these times, I am constantly reminded of her and fear running into her at the store. I must confront these fears, and I usually need to talk about them.\n\nThe Burden of Unshared Pain\n\nI’m learning that my friends and family are tired of hearing about her. They worry that I might still be obsessed with thoughts of her, or even mentally ill. It hurts to know I have no one to express my anger to about her, or my wishes for her failure in life and work. As a spiritual person, I also feel guilty for wishing harm on anyone. Even someone who tried to destroy my life.\n\nSearching for Understanding and Healing\n\nFor four years, I’ve searched the internet for answers to why I can’t forget her and the pain she deliberately caused. She admitted to my husband that she had loved him for over a decade when she first kissed him. Despite this, I have managed to separate my feelings for my husband, whom I deeply love, from those I hold for the other woman. (OW)\n\nSomewhere I came across the explanation of “PTSD” (post traumatic stress disorder) and it seems to describe me. Now, admittedly, I don’t have it as badly as some soldiers who have been traumatized in combat, but I have been traumatized…terribly traumatized!\n\nThe Challenge of Moving On\n\nI know I can tell people that over and over and the ones who control their thoughts and their minds can look at me and say, “Just get over it!”. Hearing that hurts more than I can say. Everyone is different and my psyche has been damaged…no doubt.\n\nIntellectually, I know what I have to do to get over this, I know what I should think, or not think, about her. Somehow, my brain doesn’t listen to me, even though intellectually it knows what’s truly best for me.\n\nStruggling with Acceptance and Understanding\n\nSomeone I love dearly…a family member…said to me the other day, that I should get over it. I tried to explain what has happened to me and how I feel. I told her about how my marriage is stronger than ever and that my husband and I have cultivated this beautiful love and respect for each other, and she had the gall to say to me that she thought that I was trying to talk myself into believing that.\n\nGetting Over an Affair: Dealing with Triggers After an Affair\n\nHow hurtful that statement was to me. How sad that she thought that I was actually trying to convince myself of my marriage and love success story.\n\nI know one thing for sure, I will never talk to her again about my private feelings. I guess I trust too much. It’s been the hardest lesson to learn, that there are people who just don’t understand, or care about, my inner feelings.\n\nThe Endless Battle with PTSD After Infidelity\n\nWhat I am trying to say, or ask, with all these words is…is there a time that PTSD should actually be over?\n\nEven if there isn’t an actual medical diagnosis of PTSD, it sure feels like that’s what has happened to me. It scares me that I am under the gun, time wise, to be over all this pain and suffering and never respond to any triggers or stimuli again. I don’t want to go back to therapy. I think I know as much as the therapists.\n\nIntellectually I understand what I have to do…it doesn’t work emotionally…I’ve tried it, over and over!\n\nAll I want is to have someone I can talk to about my feelings. Not a therapist…a friend, but I think I might be hurting the friendship by talking about the OW! I want to stop it. I don’t want to be set off by triggers. I don’t want to hurt. I don’t ever want to have another dream about her. I don’t want to be afraid that I will see her when we visit our hometown. I just don’t want to have thoughts of her interrupt my life anymore. I want to be free of her.\n\nIs there a time limit for PTSD?\n\nI don’t think so and I’m tired of people judging me!!!"
