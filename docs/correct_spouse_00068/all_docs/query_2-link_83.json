That yearning for nature's calm and how impactful it is on our health is what I dive into today with my guest, Dr. Josh Axe, in this episode on Biohacking Bestie.\n\nDr. Axe emphasizes how engaging in outdoor activities can help in biohacking practices and nurture the nervous system – as well as the importance of addressing the root causes of health issues, and advocating for an environment that supports our physical, psychological, and spiritual well-being.\n\nWe also discuss the importance of strengthening the body internally rather than solely focusing on treating symptoms with external solutions.\n\nDr. Josh Axe is a doctor of natural medicine and a clinical nutritionist with a passion for helping people get healthy by using food as medicine. He founded one of the largest functional medicine clinics in the United States and runs the popular health website www.draxe.com, where you can find recipes, natural remedies, videos, nutrition advice, and fitness tips. Dr. Axe is a board-certified doctor of natural medicine (DNM), earned his doctorate in chiropractic at Palmer College (DC), and is a certified nutrition specialist (CNS) from the American College of Nutrition.\n\nListen as we discuss…\n\n(00:00) Living in Nature\n\n(03:30) Environment, Mindset, and Health\n\n(15:41) Fatherhood and Identity Issues\n\n(22:48) The Importance of Purpose and Becoming\n\n(34:31) Overcoming Limiting Beliefs Through Success\n\n(44:45) Navigating Relationships and Personalized Nutrition\n\n(50:56) Nutrient-Dense Foods and Ideal Farming\n\n(57:34) Holistic Approach to Health and Healing\n\n(01:05:25) Promotion of \"Think This, Not That\"\n\n… and more!\n\nGrab my brand-new book: Biohack Like a Woman.\n\nOrder now on Amazon: http://bit.ly/3TYMz5Z\n\nFind more from Aggie:\n\nStart optimizing your health here: https://biohackingbestie.com/\n\nGet daily Biohacking Bestie tips here: https://www.instagram.com/biohackingbestie/\n\nGet a 7-Day FREE meal plan here: https://www.fitasfuck.co/mealplan\n\nFind more from Dr. Josh Axe:\n\nWebsite: https://draxe.com/\n\nInstagram: @drjoshaxe\n\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/user/doctorjoshaxe\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\n\nSundays: Go to https://sundaysfordogs.com/aggie to get 40% off of your first order.\n\nHosted on Acast.

With multitudes of studies being done on everything from fat loss, fasting, and nutrition - without a single menstruating woman included in the study.\n\nHealth and wellness isn’t one size fits all. Males are solar with 24 hour hormonal cycles, while females are lunar with a 28 day hormonal cycle that is deeply connected to the moon. So our approaches to health need to be completely different.\n\nThat’s why we also discuss the damage being done to women as we live in a world that’s less and less attuned to their natural cycles and the true health impacts of suppressing emotions for the sake of keeping others happy.\n\nDarin Olien is co-host of the Emmy™ Award Winning, #1 Netflix docu-series, Down to Earth with Zac Efron. Spending nearly 20 years exploring the planet discovering new and underutilized exotic foods and medicinal plants as a Superfood hunter Darin developed, Shakeology – grossing over $4 Billion in sales since 2008 for Beachbody. He also created a plant-based Ultimate Reset 21-day detoxification program for the company. From his years of experience within the health space, he wrote his New York Times best-selling book, “SuperLife: The five fixes that will keep you healthy, fit and eternally awesome”. He is also the founder of Barukas™, the most nutrient-dense nut in the world coming from the Savannah “Cerrado” of Brazil.\n\nWe also discuss:\n\n(00:00) - Travel, Wellness, and Authenticity\n\n(06:14) - Safety and Authenticity in Relationships\n\n(15:25) - Navigating Truth, Emotions, and Relationships\n\n(26:44) - Women's Health and Hormonal Insights\n\n(41:45) - Cultivating Presence and Self-Care\n\n(50:54) - Understanding Women's Monthly Nutritional Needs\n\n(55:02) - Biohacking and Hormone Balance\n\n(01:04:32) - Understanding Female Fertility and Support\n\n(01:10:54) - Finding Balance in Nature and Wellness\n\n… and more!\n\nGrab my brand-new book: Biohack like a Woman.\n\nOrder now on Amazon: http://bit.ly/3TYMz5Z\n\nFind more from Aggie:\n\nStart optimizing your health here: https://biohackingbestie.com/\n\nGet daily Biohacking Bestie tips here: @biohackingbestie\n\nGet a 7-Day FREE meal plan here: https://www.fitasfuck.co/mealplan\n\nFind more from Darin Olien:\n\nInstagram: @darinolien\n\nWebsite: https://darinolien.com/\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\n\nFatty15: go to https://fatty15.com/aggie to get 15% of your first order.\n\nHosted on Acast.

Conscious parenting might be the answer you're looking for.\n\nThis approach goes beyond Western psychology to draw wisdom from those in the West, which are often nuclear and individualistic.\n\nIn the latest episode of Biohacking Bestie, I get to speak to Dr. Shefali on everything conscious parenting while blending Western science and Eastern practices. We discuss how conscious parenting starts with self-awareness, reflecting on your own childhood experiences and any negative patterns you might repeat.\n\nDr. Shefali also shares how understanding child development is also key. Some stages can be challenging, but that doesn't mean you're a bad parent – it's just a normal part of growth. Additionally, your child is an individual with their own path. They are not here to fulfill your needs or make you happy. They are not a therapist, savior, or a way to improve your marriage. They are simply your child, here to learn and grow.\n\nDr. Shefali crafts a unique approach, merging Western psychological principles with Eastern philosophical insights. Renowned for her expertise in family dynamics and personal growth, she conducts courses worldwide. Two of her books, \"The Conscious Parent\" and \"The Awakened Family,\" have been New York Times bestsellers. Dr. Shefali continues to inspire lives.\n\nWhat we discuss…\n\n(01:57) Why a blend of science and Eastern practices is golden, even in parenting\n\n(03:54) Eastern traditional practices that Dr. Shefali had to divorce\n\n(06:55) Practices for parents to-be\n\n(08:43) The biggest pitfalls of modern parenting\n\n(12:51) Self-forgiveness and grace for fulfilled parenting\n\n(17:10) The power of awareness for your partner relationship patterns\n\n(19:16) Common motherhood patterns across different cultures\n\n(21:04) Practices mothers can embrace to have a more mind-to-heart connection\n\n(29:27) What a conscious parenting approach should look like\n\n(36:18) Connection between conscious parenting and biohacking\n\n…and more!\n\nDon’t forget:\n\nGrab my brand-new book: Biohack Like a Woman.\n\nOrder now on Amazon: http://bit.ly/3TYMz5Z.\n\nFind more from Aggie:\n\nStart optimizing your health here: https://biohackingbestie.com/\n\nGet daily Biohacking Bestie tips here: https://www.instagram.com/biohackingbestie/\n\nGet a 7-day FREE meal plan here: https://www.fitasfuck.co/mealplan\n\nFind more from Dr. Shefali:\n\nWebsite: https://www.drshefali.com/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/doctorshefali\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/doctorshefali\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/DrShefali\n\nHosted on Acast.

Societal norms have tried to dictate our worth and capabilities, forcing us to dim our light just to fit in.\n\nBut when you prioritize your physical and mental fitness, everything else falls into place. Living life on your terms has nothing to do with your IQ or degrees. It's about having the audacity to challenge the status quo, push past your comfort zone and put your wellbeing first.\n\nStop playing by rules that don't serve you. It's time to awaken the unstoppable force within and unapologetically go after the life you deserve. Get fit, stay woke and watch your transformation unfold.\n\nIn the latest episode of Biohacking Bestie, I get to speak to Jennifer Cohen.
