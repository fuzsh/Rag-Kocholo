        "text": "How many books are there with “wife” in the title? The answer is many, many many! Here’s an updated version of a post I wrote in 2016. Since then, I’ve read more “wife” books. And today, I went down the rabbit hole to add more to the TBR. There’s something intriguing about books like this, like you’re getting an inside look into a story.\n\nHere are the “wife” books I’ve reviewed. I apologize for a couple of the short reviews. They’re from early times in my blogging life when I was still figuring things out:\n\nThe Aviator’s Wife by Melanie Benjamin – historical fiction about the public and private lives of Anne Morrow and her famous aviator husband, Charles Lindbergh. I really liked this book. Melanie Benjamin takes on a well-known subject and fills in the gaps by letting the reader imagine how Morrow felt during her early marriage and later when Charles left her and their five children alone for long stretches. 4 stars\n\nThe Banker’s Wife by Cristina Alger – When a private plane disappears over the Swiss Alps and reports of a wreckage follow, Annabel Werner must now accept that her husband Matthew is dead. I enjoyed the fast-paced tension of this intriguing story, which gives readers an imaginative glimpse into the lives of the ridiculously wealthy. Plot lines are nicely tied together, with several interesting clues and finish with a satisfying conclusion and a couple of surprises. This is the perfect book for readers who enjoy stories about the glamour of high living, fashion, expensive art and sophisticated characters. 3.5 stars.\n\nMy Lovely Wife by Samantha Downing – In this debut thriller/dark humor novel, a picture-perfect marriage has shocking secrets beneath its shiny facade. But Millicent and her husband play a secret deadly game. And when the stakes and pressure rise, they take greater risks to keep their secret hidden, until the dynamics of their marriage betray them. This is a good book for readers who like thrillers and dark humor. 4 stars\n\nThe Other Wife by Kathleen Irene Paterka – secret lives and a tale of bigamy pit two wives against each other. This is the kind of book that you pick up, read for fun, and move on. Put your analytical mind on the shelf and enjoy the escape! 3 stars\n\nThe Paris Wife by Paula McLain – I never knew about Ernest Hemingway’s wives and was very interested in learning about his first wife, Elizabeth Hadley Richardson and their six-year marriage, spent mostly in Paris, where they immersed themselves in the world of the Lost Generation and mingled with famous writers, poets and artists. 4 stars\n\nThe Perfect Wife by Blake Pierce – This is a short and fast-paced thriller about a young couple on the rise, the author’s debut in a series, in which Pierce’s characters are just coming to life. Although characters are not fully developed and the plot line is wild and unbelievable, the story moves well and is a solid 3-star read.\n\nThe Pocket Wife by Susan Crawford – Dana Catrell isn’t sure what happened at Celia Steinhauser’s house that afternoon. The only thing she knows is that her neighbor is dead. As she tries to piece together the events, Dana vaguely remembers an argument after a lot of drinks. Alcohol isn’t the only reason Dana can’t remember, however. She’s on a manic bipolar disorder climb and headed for a crash. 3.5 stars\n\nSea Wife by Amity Gaige – What would you do if your spouse asked you to pick up and embark on a year-long sailing trip in Panama? Michael Partlow had been feeling the itch to get away from suburban life in Connecticut. Now it’s just a matter of convincing his wife, Juliet that a trip like this with their two young children, is what they desperately need. Michael may be restless, but Juliet suffers from debilitating depression. I’d describe this as suspenseful literary fiction that looks at the complexities of marriage and parenthood. 4 stars\n\nThe Shoemaker’s Wife by Adriana Trigiani – Italian family saga of immigration, near-misses in love and brushes with greatness during the turn of the century. I enjoyed reading about Italy at the turn of the century and life in the Italian Alps. An entertaining read and a great way to escape to another time and place. 3.5 stars\n\nThe Silent Wife by A. S. A. Harrison – Suspenseful story about what’s beneath the surface of a seemingly happy marriage. Jodi Brett and Todd Gilbert have a smooth way of being together and it’s worked for twenty-some years. Then we get to know them a little better. When the balance is upset, we see how far a person will go to make things right. 4 stars\n\nThe Time Traveler’s Wife by Audrey Niffenegger – unusual love story between a wife and a husband who lives in different times, made into a popular movie – 2 stars (this is just my opinion – I know a lot of people who liked this book!) We read this for my book club a long time ago. Some of us liked it. I’ve never seen the movie. Maybe I’d like it better if I did. What do you think of this book?\n\nThat’s just the tip of the iceberg! This list keeps growing! Here are more that have caught my eye:\n\nHis Lost Wife by A. J. Wills\n\nThe House of Lost Wives by Rebecca Hardy\n\nThe Italian Wife by Kate Furnivall\n\nThe Jeweler’s Wife by Madeline Connelly\n\nThe Lost Wife by Georgina Lees\n\nThe Lost Wife by Susanna Moore\n\nThe Lost Wife by Alyson Richman\n\nMr. Emerson’s Wife by Amy Belding Brown\n\nThe Pilot’s Wife by Anita Shreve\n\nThe Railwayman’s Wife by Ashley Hay\n\nThe Traitor’s Wife by Allison Pataki\n\nThe Twilight Wife by A.J. Banner\n\nThe Wife by Alafair Burke\n\nThe Wife by Meg Wolitzer\n\nThe Winemaker’s Wife by Kristin Harmel\n\nThe Wives by Tarryn Fisher\n\nThe Wrong Wife by Maya Alden\n\nThe Zookeeper’s Wife by Diane Ackerman\n\nWhat do you think about all these “wife” books? Can you add to my lists? Leave a title in the comments and I’ll update the list."
