        "text": "If you don't take care of what's going on the subconscious of people's minds, at best the term I use is you're going to be the the greatest version of your limited self. If you really get that statement it's very profound right so you you're stuck within the parameters of your blind spots, right these beliefs of inadequacy and security and scarcity which to me a universal their prime or they're very deep, then we develop survival mechanisms. Adaptations compensate And then on top of that our physiology is going to just by natural cascade reflect whatever's going on internally, which is as you know, as a doctor, usually a mild state of fight or flight, sympathetic nervous system, cortisol, adrenaline, noradrenaline, that whole storm of hormones that really is doing us a disservice. It's affecting people sleep and weight gain, all of the things that people are dealing symptomatically on the surface, to me are a byproduct of the fact that human beings currently are designed to survive. Everything is a potential perceived threat, whether it's being what your boss is going to say, or your spouse is going to say, well, your parents are going to say, or am I going to be able to pay rent? Or am I going to be okay in the future? Am I going to realize my dreams? Am I ever going to quit smoking? Am I going to lose weight? All of these sort of unanswerable questions inspire this internal sort of fight and battle that people have. That to me is the disease the absence of ease that then manifests over time into some physical symptoms. So that's why I get super passionate about this because you can do all the work externally . . if you don't address what's going on mentally and emotionally for somebody, at best, you're just making the window dressing look good, while the back of the shop is just on fire.” -Peter Crone"
