        "text": "Peter Crone: How to dissolve barriers to happiness â The Life Lessons Podcast with Simon Mundie\n\nIntroduction and appreciation\n\nSimon expresses his excitement and admiration for Peter Crone's work and message.\n\nSimon mentions that he resonates with Peter's ideas about getting out of our own way and letting go of limiting stories.\n\nSimon asks Peter if he has anything to add.\n\n\"I love your message, I love your outlook, I love your attitude... really resonates with me.\"\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with anyone... Most people find that very liberating.\"\n\nPeter's gratitude for the impact of his work\n\nPeter expresses his gratitude for the positive impact his work has had on people's lives.\n\nHe appreciates when people are curious about his background and how it has shaped him.\n\nHe hopes his enthusiasm will inspire Simon's audience as well.\n\n\"Thank you... moving and touching for me to be with people who have been impacted by my work in a positive way.\"\n\n\"I love your enthusiasm... hopefully that will cascade into your audience.\"\n\nRealizing there's nothing wrong with us\n\nPeter acknowledges that many people feel liberated when they understand that there's nothing inherently wrong with them.\n\nThe self-help industry often perpetuates the idea that we need fixing, but Peter believes in the power of embracing our inherent worthiness.\n\nHe quotes his own saying about there always being somewhere to get to until we realize there isn't.\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with you... the whole self-help industry perpetuates the idea that there is something wrong with you.\"\n\n\"There's always somewhere to get to until you realize there isn't.\"\n\nThe journey of self-fixing versus self-exploration\n\nPeter talks about the journey of trying to fix oneself versus embracing one's imperfections and exploring one's potential.\n\nHe emphasizes the importance of reconciling any deeper-seated insecurities or inadequacies, which leads to freedom and liberation.\n\nPeter contrasts the idea of control and improvement with the idea of exploration and embracing one's potential.\n\n\"That becomes reconciled... that's Freedom, that's Liberation... much more a journey of exploring one's potential versus trying to fix one's imperfections.\"\n\n\"Exploration vs. control and trying to improve... that's something I really want to dig into.\"\n\nPeter's unique and formative childhood\n\nPeter acknowledges that his childhood was unique and challenging.\n\nHe shares that his mother passed away when he was seven, which was confusing and difficult to process at such a young age.\n\nThe death of his mother was a pivotal moment in his life, shaping his perspective on uncertainty and the nature of life.\n\nThe loss of his father, who didn't return from work one day, had an even greater impact as he became Peter's sole caretaker.\n\n\"That was obviously both trying but confusing... not really much a seven-year-old can do in terms of processing the death of a parent.\"\n\n\"That was a much bigger moment in my life... than my mum dying... the real turning point for me.\"\n\n\"That was a real cosmic slap around the face... not really understanding the nature of life, or why... all the questions of like why me and this isn't fair.\"\n\nThe impact of the loss of Peter's father\n\nPeter reflects on the immense pain and loss he experienced when his father didn't come back from work, leaving him as an only child.\n\nHe describes the strong bond and adoration he shared with his father, who had been his sole caretaker after his mother passed away.\n\nLosing his father had a profound impact on Peter's understanding of life and led to a deep exploration of spirituality and acceptance of life's uncertainties.\n\n\"That was really... a real cosmic slap around the face... not really understanding the nature of life... all the questions of like why me and this isn't fair.\"\n\n\"I couldn't have asked for a better dad... just a very cuddly teddy bear type man... who just adored me... I got a lot of it.\"\n\n\"That was definitely a unique experience for any child... was obviously formative in the man that I became.\"\n\nPeter's academic struggles\n\nPeter experienced difficulties in his studies and predictions due to personal circumstances.\n\nDespite expecting to achieve good results, he fell short due to missed time.\n\n\"I was looking at the Oxford and cambridges and you know the predicted I was doing foray levels which at the time was an anomaly...they thought I could take on another one.\"\n\nThe pivotal moment of isolation\n\nPeter recalls a significant moment of complete isolation and desperation in his bedroom after his dad's passing.\n\nHe reflects on the profound sense of loneliness and separation he felt at that time.\n\n\"At the time my personal subjective experience was of complete and utter loneliness, isolation, and with that, a degree of desperation.\"\n\nCompassion for others' loneliness\n\nPeter's own experience of isolation and loneliness has given him a deep understanding and compassion for others who may feel disconnected.\n\nHe explains that even those who are not physically alone can still experience emotional loneliness.\n\n\"Even though mine was visceral and actual, everybody else's, which is experiential, is nonetheless very similar... I have an immense amount of love and compassion for when people feel that sense of desperation, feel that sense of isolation.\"\n\nSuffering born from separation\n\nPeter and Simon discuss the suffering that most people experience, which is rooted in the identification with the separate self and the feeling of separation.\n\n\"The suffering that most of us experience beyond the pain of that is inherent in life is born of that identifying with that 'I am' and that feeling of separation.\"\n\nPeter Crone's journey to becoming a trainer for celebrity clients\n\nPeter talks about leaving his thesis and visiting a friend in California instead\n\nDespite never leaving his hometown before, he ended up with a high-profile job training celebrities\n\nHe got the opportunity to train special clients that were previously trained by another trainer named Bob\n\n\"So within 20 minutes of leaving Tom having had this workout interview talked some numbers you know, I get home and at that point again I'm showing my age but there was a fact that had my whole whole itinerary of my flight to New York where I'm staying my contact you know people there and you know there was just a level of efficiency that I had aspired to throughout my life but it was in action you know it was the actual demonstration of it so those were some of the pinch me moments but in a way that really resonated with me so it felt very natural it didn't at no point did I feel like I was an imposter or you know over my boots or whatever they say you know it was um yeah it was it was a very very natural integration and yet something that I feel incredibly best to have got to experience\"\n\nPeter Crone's background and perception\n\nPeter Crone reflects on his experience working with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.\n\nHe admired their impeccable preparation and dedication to their craft.\n\nHe emphasizes that they were \"students of their industry\" and masters in their own right.\n\nThey lived authentic lives and did not simply \"mail it in\" for the sake of money.\n\nCrone believes that perception plays a key role in how people tend to view celebrities like Cruise and Kidman.\n\n\"They just lived great lives... for the most part, they're just genuine people.\"\n\nPerceptions of celebrities and authenticity\n\nCrone acknowledges the varying perceptions people have of celebrities based on their public image.\n\nHe believes that some celebrities are authentic and create a genuine connection with their audience.\n\nHowever, there are others who have a complete front and engage in pretense.\n\nCrone mentions that this observed pretense is especially prevalent in politics.\n\n\"I would say Tom and Nicole are much more at the authentic end... there's a much greater resonance between how most people probably perceive them and who they are.\"\n\nPeter Crone's transition to the Mind Architect\n\nCrone states that he always had a sense of impending transition in his life.\n\nDespite enjoying his work with Cruise and Kidman, he felt a deeper calling and believed he had more to offer.\n\nThe natural accent point for him was when Cruise and Kidman went through separation, combined with his interest in the mind and deeper questions of life.\n\nCrone had discussions about consciousness, philosophy, and spirituality with Nicole Kidman.\n\n\"I'm my own version of Tom in a different industry... I'd always been fascinated with the Mind... so it was a very natural segue for me.\"\n\nThe work of the Mind Architect and dissolution of problems\n\nCrone describes his work as a dissolution process rather than problem-solving.\n\nHe suggests that the human identity, formed during childhood, is a construct and a walking conversation.\n\nHis aim is to remove the narrative and dialogue that hinders individuals, such as feelings of inadequacy or lack of love.\n\nThrough dissolution, a deeper reality can be revealed.\n\nDissolving barriers to happiness in performance\n\nPeter Crone asserts that beneath our external identities, our true essence is freedom.\n\nThe process of awakening or enlightenment can be seen as the realization and embodiment of this freedom.\n\nBarriers to natural performance can arise when the mind attributes significance to events, particularly in high-pressure situations like major sporting events.\n\nThe significance of the mind creates tension and anxiety, interfering with what athletes would otherwise do naturally.\n\nThe dissolution process that Peter Crone brings to athletes helps them step into a state of inner freedom, allowing for effortless performance.\n\n\"What gets in the way is the significance of the mind then attributes to the event...it gets in the way of what they would otherwise do quite naturally.\"\n\nThe impact of significance on performance\n\nThe significance attached to major events, potential winnings, and societal expectations can alter the chemistry of an athlete's brain.\n\nWhen an event carries high stakes and personal implications, there is an increased likelihood of tension and anxiety manifesting in the body.\n\nThis tension and anxiety create barriers to natural and effortless performance.\n\nDissolving the significance through the process of inner freedom helps athletes return to a default state of effortless performance.\n\n\"The significance of the mind...gets in the way of what they would otherwise do quite naturally.\"\n\nDissolution and flow\n\nThe concept of dissolution aligns with the experience of flow, where the sense of self dissolves, and one is fully absorbed in the present moment.\n\nFlow involves a sense of effortless performance and a lack of self-consciousness.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, self-consciousness and pressure can lead to choking or impaired performance.\n\nDissolving self-consciousness and embracing inner freedom can help athletes tap into flow-like states, allowing for optimal performance.\n\n\"[Flow] is the dissolution of the experience of self...and the opposite of that is choking...self-imposed pressure...self-consciousness.\"\n\nCultural influences on self-consciousness\n\nCultural and societal factors can contribute to varying levels of self-consciousness.\n\nCertain societies, like the British, tend to be more self-conscious, concerned about how others perceive them.\n\nThis concern for appearances can be mentally and emotionally draining for individuals.\n\nHowever, this self-consciousness can also be seen as a survival mechanism, rooted in our primal instincts for protection and social acceptance.\n\n\"The Brits tend to be rather more self-conscious...because it's about appearances...it's a survival mechanism.\"\n\nJourney from babyhood to self-consciousness\n\nBabies exist in a state of pure being, devoid of self-consciousness.\n\nThe transition from uninhibited, unself-conscious babyhood to a state of self-awareness and self-consciousness involves various factors.\n\nNature and nurture both play a role in shaping an individual's self-perception and guiding fictions about themselves.\n\nThese guiding fictions can range from beliefs about being unlovable or unlikable to core shame.\n\nThe process of dissolution involves letting go of these guiding fictions and reconnecting with the inherent is-ness of one's existence.\n\n\"Once you get over that [self-consciousness], it's...very liberating.\"\n\nStruggle with self-value\n\nBabies don't know their name, nationality, or religion, and may struggle with self-value.\n\nConfidence in conforming, but lack of connection to others, can also cause a struggle with intimacy.\n\n\"Every human being arrives with their set limitations.\"\n\nInfluence of nurture on limitations\n\nOur circumstances, parents, teachers, lovers, and jobs trigger the limitations we arrive with.\n\nThese external factors are like epigenetics, shaping how our limitations are expressed.\n\n\"We will attract the circumstances...that will then trigger the limitations that we arrive with.\"\n\nViewing insecurities from a different perspective\n\nRather than seeing insecurities as a result of past events, they are already present and attract circumstances to trigger them.\n\nThis perspective allows for a more empowering outlook and a sense of responsibility in shaping one's life.\n\n\"No one's a victim... It's like no I might not understand how exactly the circumstances of my life have come together but nonetheless in a way I am asking for life to present me with this opportunity for some form of growth and insight to occur.\"\n\nPatterns of Pain and Suffering\n\nAccumulation of pain and hurt in our lives leads to suffering and a desire to avoid re-experiencing it.\n\nThe fear of getting hurt again drives people to avoid situations similar to their past painful experiences.\n\nThe mind holds on to past pain, causing people to constantly relive it and perpetuate their suffering.\n\n\"The suffering is the thing that gets perpetuated because people want to avoid that.\"\n\nDissolving barriers to happiness\n\nIdentify and understand why certain behaviors are sabotaging relationships or causing neediness and withdrawal.\n\n\"Why would it be that you would sabotage in your case a relationship or why would you be needy or why would you become withdrawn if you're scared of someone losing you, leaving you? What must you think about yourself? Which then, as you said, goes to more the core beliefs about someone's persona.\"\n\nHelp individuals uncover their core beliefs and thought patterns that contribute to their feelings of inadequacy.\n\n\"I will help them guide them to be able to reveal it for themselves so then they're like well I can see that...maybe I just feel like I'm not good enough.\"\n\nEncourage individuals to bring evidence to support their beliefs and challenge their validity.\n\n\"I would want to bring some evidence for that, aside from current affairs and whatever they're going through, or their latest relationship or their last relationship...where can you remember some of those things happening in your life that gave you the same experience of not being good enough.\"\n\nFacilitate a process of investigation and self-reflection to help individuals determine the truthfulness of their beliefs.\n\n\"Through the process of Investigation, I take them, sort of, on a journey where they can investigate the truth of that belief and ask them if it's an actual truth, yes or no, even though for them it feels very true.\"\n\n\"It's disidentifying from our identification with thoughts and feelings.\"\n\nUncovering childhood experiences that shape self-perception\n\nGuide individuals to recall and explore moments from their childhood that have shaped their self-perception.\n\n\"I can remember when I was eight and I was at primary school...this girl Jenny, she was making fun of me in the hallway...you know, I felt inadequate because...she represented the female...so now any female authority figure...they're wondering why they can't seem to ascend the ranks...they find they get very nervous in the boardroom meetings but they don't understand why.\"\n\nHighlight the impact of early experiences on later beliefs and behavior patterns.\n\n\"From that moment forth, especially as it relates to the feminine, I felt inadequate...but they're still stuck in the trap of who I am relative to the feminine is inadequate.\"\n\nConnect present emotions and behaviors to past childhood incidents.\n\n\"Gosh, I haven't thought about this for years, but I can remember when I was eight...and she told me that my drawing looked like poo...but that was pivotal for that child...they're still stuck in the trap of who I am relative to the feminine is inadequate.\"\n\n\"They're still stuck in the trap of who I am relative to the feminine is inadequate.\"\n\nDissolving the idea of oneself\n\nEmphasize the dissolution of the idea of oneself as a pathway to happiness.\n\n\"It's the emancipation not of circumstance, but of the idea of myself and the way that I react to circumstance.\"\n\nHighlight the paradox of self-consciousness and the limitations of ego-driven identification.\n\n\"We can only point to who we are, we can't actually see it because we're the Seer...that's sort of the beautiful Zen Cohen kind of like Paradox of I am Consciousness and I can only witness Consciousness, which is Myself by seeing that that is not me.\"\n\nEncourage disidentification from limiting thoughts and stories about oneself.\n\n\"It's disidentifying from our identification with thoughts and feelings...it's a disidentification from our identification with thoughts, with the stories we hold about ourselves, whatever they may be.\"\n\n\"It's disidentifying from our identification with thoughts and feelings.\"\n\nAwakening to True Identity\n\nPeter Crone discusses the realization that he is not just his physical form or the things associated with it.\n\nBeing Consciousness, rather than the human form, can be difficult in society.\n\nThe understanding of the body as an interface rather than the essence of identity.\n\n\"Even over here in the Declaration of Independence...the presumption is that what I want is in our future.\"\n\nThe Pursuit of Happiness\n\nPeter Crone's quote on happiness: \"True happiness is the absence of the search for happiness.\"\n\nPursuing happiness in the future perpetuates suffering and discontent.\n\nThe belief that happiness is always tied to external circumstances and achievements.\n\n\"The absence of the search for happiness is true happiness...and that can only happen when there's the absence of resistance.\"\n\nResisting Circumstances\n\nResisting circumstances creates personal resistance and adds to the difficulty of the situation.\n\nAcknowledging that life is the way it is, and accepting it without blame or resistance.\n\nDealing with circumstances directly rather than beating oneself up and perpetuating suffering.\n\n\"How about you just deal with the circumstance and not beat the [ __ ] out of yourself and blame life...that's a double whammy.\"\n\nConditional Love vs. Acceptance\n\nRomantic love is often conditional, based on certain expectations and conditions.\n\nA different kind of love exists between a mother and child that is accepting and all-embracing.\n\nAcceptance and love are synonymous and include accepting oneself.\n\n\"Acceptance...is all embracing, it is all accepting and within that, it includes me.\"\n\nMisconception about Love\n\nLove is often misunderstood as being sacrificial.\n\nWomen, in particular, may feel the need to constantly extend their love to their spouse or children, even at the expense of their own well-being.\n\nThis can lead to emotional breakdowns and imbalance.\n\nIt's important to understand that love should be inclusive and should include one's own preferences and needs.\n\n\"Love includes her and her own preferences...it just gets rid of the sadly replete form of judgment and wrong-making that we have in society.\"\n\nThe Transformation Power of Self-Love\n\nWhen individuals prioritize self-love and include themselves in the circle of love, their perspective can completely transform.\n\nThis transformation not only affects their view of themselves but also their health and relationships.\n\nSometimes, this shift leads to the end of certain relationships, as individuals realize that they deserve to be with someone who honors and values them.\n\n\"It's a win-win at the end of the day...the relationship has the former ended because the woman found a sense of self-value.\"\n\nThe True Nature of Love\n\nLove is often confused with romance, but it is much more powerful and inclusive.\n\nLove means accepting and embracing others for who they are, without judgment.\n\nLove also involves having personal preferences and boundaries, but without derogatory judgment towards others.\n\n\"Love is the most powerful energy in the way that we relate to one another...I accept you for who you are with everything that's got you.\"\n\nThe Power of Acceptance\n\nAccepting oneself is key to finding inner peace and happiness.\n\nMany people spend years and resources trying to fix themselves, but true transformation comes from acceptance.\n\nAcceptance leads to the ability to accept others and events, creating a cascade of positive changes in life.\n\n\"The more you accept yourself, the more everything starts falling in place...it's much easier to accept other people, it's much easier to accept events.\"\n\nShedding the Idea of Yourself\n\nRather than constantly trying to fix oneself, it is essential to let go of the image of who we think we should be and accept who we currently are.\n\nBy transcending deep-seated patterns and integrating helpful aspects while discarding those that hold us back, we can become a new version of ourselves.\n\nChanging our internal perception leads to thinking, feeling, and behaving differently, which ultimately creates a different life.\n\n\"I'm really getting rid of the idea of yourself to give birth to another version of yourself...you become a high-frequency version of yourself.\"\n\n\"Accepting Cascade just goes...everything starts falling in place.\"\n\n##ing Where You're At\n\nIt's okay to be where you are and to be who you are right now.\n\nThis acceptance can bring immense relief and create space for new possibilities.\n\n\"So it's okay you're where you're at, you're who you are and what if just for right now that's precisely where you're meant to be. And at that moment usually people feel an immense amount of relief which is the space that gives them the opportunity to see something new.\"\n\nLetting Go of Resistance\n\nStop resisting and allow yourself to be present in the moment.\n\nResisting what is happening can create unnecessary suffering.\n\n\"So stop wriggling around, stop resisting.\"\n\nRecommendations for Further Exploration\n\nPeter Crone's work can be found on social media platforms like Instagram.\n\nHe also offers courses and workshops for those who want to go deeper into his teachings.\n\nPeter Crone's official website is petercrone.com.\n\n\"For people who want to find your stuff, you know because it is so valuable, just point them in the direction of the Dizzy Heights of social medias Instagrams, usually the best place. Peter Crone official and then my website is just my name petercrone.com where they can also find there's much deeper Dives if people wanted to do workshops or courses that I've been doing over the last year or so.\""
