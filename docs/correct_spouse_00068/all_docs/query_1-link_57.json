        "text": "Mental health is something we all have. And just like physical health, it’s something we need to take care of. Mental health is not just good or bad. It exists on a scale, which everyone experiences differently. You might move up and down this scale depending on what’s going on in your life. We all feel anxious from time to time or have days when we feel low. But for some people, these feelings progress to more serious problems. We use the term mental health problems in this information to describe illnesses or conditions you might be diagnosed with, like depression and anxiety.\n\nYou might also hear people talk about their mental wellbeing. There’s no set meaning for this term. People often use it to describe how they’re feeling and coping in daily life.\n\nWhat does good mental health mean?\n\nGood mental health means more than just not having a mental health problem, like depression. It can mean different things for different people, but it may include being able to:\n\nFeel positive about yourself (positive self-esteem)\n\nBuild and maintain good relationships with others\n\nBe able to learn or work well\n\nCope in a positive way with the stresses of daily life\n\nFulfil your own potential\n\nMake decisions\n\nContribute to your community\n\nGood mental health and wellbeing allows us to connect with others and enjoy life.\n\nMental health is a major part of living with Crohn’s or Colitis. Research suggests that people living with Crohn’s or Colitis may be twice as likely to experience mental health problems, like anxiety and depression, as the general population. And around half of all people with the Crohn’s or Colitis say it has affected their mental health in some way.\n\nLiving with a long-term condition like Crohn’s or Colitis can trigger lots of different feelings and emotions. You might feel shocked or a sense of disbelief when you are first diagnosed and find it hard to adjust. You may feel anxious, frustrated, sad, scared, or angry about having the condition and dealing with distressing symptoms. Not knowing what might happen in the future may make you feel helpless and uncertain. You may feel very isolated or even ashamed about your condition.\n\nThese feelings are completely normal, and many people with Crohn’s or Colitis experience them from time to time. It’s not a sign of weakness. Long-term health conditions are a lot to deal with, and it’s natural that you might struggle to cope sometimes. Give yourself time and space to accept your feelings. For some people, these negative feelings can become overwhelming. This can lead to mental health problems like stress, anxiety, and depression.\n\nIt can be helpful to understand more about your mental health, recognise the feelings and know what you can do. Getting support in place and developing coping strategies can help. You’re not alone. We’re here to help.\n\nA mood diary or mood tracker app can help you keep a record of how you’re feeling. You can also share this with your IBD team.\n\nCrohn’s, Colitis and mental health problems can be taboo subjects and difficult to talk about. The more you can share with friends, family, and your healthcare team, the better it can be. Encourage them to try the In My Shoes: 24 Hours with Crohn’s or Colitis app. This app allows anyone to experience first-hand what it might be like to have Crohn’s or Colitis.\n\nOur Talking toolkit can help you start the conversation. If you want to tell people about your condition and your mental health so they know how it affects you, the toolkit can help. You will find tools, tips, and support to start a conversation that can change lives.\n\nThere seems to be four main areas that trigger feelings of anxiety and depression in people with Crohn’s or Colitis. These include:\n\nThe impact of the condition itself, including dealing with unpredictable and invisible symptoms\n\nAnxiety about new treatments\n\nWorries about body image\n\nStigma associated with a condition like Crohn’s or Colitis\n\nOf course, there are other things that can affect your mental health too. Even just trying to navigate healthcare systems can be stressful and add to the mental load. You may worry about what the future holds. And you may have other stresses in your life, whether they relate to your Crohn’s or Colitis or not.\n\nYou are more likely to experience poorer mental health at certain times such as:\n\nWhen you’re first diagnosed with Crohn’s or Colitis\n\nDuring a flare-up of your symptoms\n\nNeeding to go into hospital for treatment or surgery, especially if you may need a stoma\n\nStarting a different treatment for your Crohn’s or Colitis\n\nTaking steroids, as these can cause extreme highs and lows in your mood\n\nLiving with ongoing invisible symptoms such as fatigue or pain\n\nIt can help to be aware of the times when you may be at greater risk of changes in your mental health. You can then get the help and support you need.\n\nStigma and isolation\n\nFeelings of stigma and isolation are common when living with a condition like Crohn’s or Colitis. Certain symptoms can make you feel worried or ashamed about what others think of you. You may also have negative feelings about yourself, which can be just as hard to deal with.\n\nSymptoms like diarrhoea, pain and fatigue can limit how much you can go out with friends and family. This may set you apart and increases isolation. This can be hard for others to understand when your symptoms are not visible. These feelings can increase the risk of depression or anxiety.\n\nFinding a community of people who understand what you’re going through can really help. Crohn’s & Colitis UK have Local Networks across the country. You can connect with people online through our Facebook Forum. We also offer Virtual Social Events to anyone across the UK affected by Crohn’s or Colitis.\n\nWe know that people with Crohn’s or Colitis are at greater risk of mental health problems like stress, anxiety, and depression than the general population. At the same time, mental health problems, like stress, can have a negative effect on gut symptoms. People who have both mental health problems and Crohn’s or Colitis can end up in a cycle, with each one making the other worse.\n\nThe link between Crohn’s and Colitis and mental health may be partly caused by something called the gut-brain axis. The gut-brain axis is a direct two-way link between the gut and the brain. It can help to explain the close link between mental and physical health in conditions such as Crohn’s and Colitis.\n\nIt’s not clear exactly how this link works, but there are several ways your gut and brain communicate. These include through nerve signals, hormones and other chemicals produced by your brain or gut. Your gut microbiome is also thought to be involved. This is the trillions of bacteria and other micro-organisms that live in your gut.\n\nInflammation in your gut may be directly linked to your mood and emotions through these different pathways. Keeping gut inflammation under control may help to improve your mental health. Your Crohn’s or Colitis medicines can help with this.\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that antidepressant medicines may help to reduce gut symptoms and flare-ups in Crohn’s and Colitis. Some studies have also shown that if you have depression, taking antidepressants may reduce your risk of developing Crohn's or Colitis. This may be through reducing gut inflammation. We need results from larger studies to be sure whether antidepressants can help in Crohn’s and Colitis.\n\nStress\n\nSome stress is a natural part of life. The sort of stress that you might experience if you’re taking an exam or running a marathon is often helpful as it can make you feel more alert. But when stress becomes a problem, it may also cause negative feelings, like making you feel irritable, overwhelmed or tense. Stress can have physical effects too. It might contribute to sleep problems and headaches, or trigger panic attacks. Some symptoms, like diarrhoea and fatigue can be like those of Crohn’s or Colitis.\n\nYou may be more likely to experience increased stress if you’re living with a long-term condition like Crohn’s or Colitis. And it may have a greater impact on you too. There’s some evidence that stress might make your Crohn’s or Colitis symptoms worse and increase the risk of a flare-up.\n\nThere is some evidence that stress of major life events, like losing your job, moving house, or losing a loved one can trigger a flare-up up to three months later. These are situations you may not be able to avoid. It’s important to be aware of how you are feeling as this can prompt you to get as much support as possible.\n\nThese anxieties are not always constant but may just appear in certain situations. For example, you might feel anxious if you do not have easy access to a toilet, but then return to normal when you reach home.\n\nYou may worry about treatment with medicines because of concerns about side effects. Or you may feel anxious about needing hospital treatment or surgery, even if the risks are small.\n\nThese feelings might come and go. But for some people, they can lead to ongoing problems with anxiety, or an ‘anxiety disorder’. You are more likely to have anxiety problems when your condition is active and you are dealing with symptoms. But anxiety can make gut symptoms worse. Finding ways to manage your anxiety can reduce your chances of having a flare-up and needing steroid treatment. You can read more about how to improve your mental wellbeing and getting help for mental health in the section How to look after your mental health.\n\nAnxiety can cause both emotional and physical symptoms. These can include:\n\nFaster, irregular, or more noticeable heartbeat\n\nFeeling lightheaded and dizzy\n\nHeadaches and muscle aches and pains\n\nSleep problems\n\nFeeling tense, nervous, or restless\n\nFeeling like you can’t stop worrying\n\nFeeling low or tearful\n\nHaving difficulty concentrating\n\nIt may not always be easy to recognise that anxiety is the reason you’re acting differently. Some of the symptoms may be like those of Crohn’s or Colitis. Others, like a fast heartbeat or feeling dizzy, could also be symptoms of anaemia. This is a common complication in people with Crohn’s or Colitis, when you have a low number of red blood cells in your blood.\n\nFind about more about anxiety from Mind or Anxiety UK.\n\nLow mood and depression\n\nEveryone feels low or down from time to time. There are lots of reasons why Crohn’s or Colitis can make you feel low too. Getting a diagnosis, developing new symptoms or side effects, and managing existing ones are just some.\n\nThere are things you can try to help improve your mood. Find out more in the section How to look after your mental health.\n\nDepression involves having a low mood, but it’s more than that. You may have depression if:\n\nYour feelings of low mood are so bad that they interfere with your daily life\n\nYou have had a low mood that’s lasted for weeks or months\n\nYou're most at risk of depression when your Crohn’s or Colitis symptoms are worse. As well as the stress and worry of dealing with symptoms, inflammation in your gut may affect your mood. But coping with the fluctuations and unpredictability of the condition can cause ongoing stress. This means you may experience anxiety and depression even if your symptoms are well controlled.\n\nIf you have depression, you might feel:\n\nSad, upset or tearful\n\nEmpty or numb\n\nLow in confidence or self-esteem\n\nHopeless\n\nMore tired than usual or have difficulty sleeping\n\nLike you’re not getting any enjoyment or pleasure out of life\n\nYou may not feel able to concentrate on everyday things. You may also avoid social activities you used to enjoy. Some people self-harm or have suicidal thoughts if they’re feeling really low.\n\nPost-traumatic stress\n\nMany people with Crohn’s or Colitis experience traumatic events because of their condition. This might include needing a hospital stay, having surgery on your bowel or dealing with severe symptoms. Some people develop post-traumatic stress following this kind of event. In post-traumatic stress, you keep experiencing stress symptoms over a long period of time after the event that caused it. You may also have nightmares, flashbacks, find it hard to concentrate and feel constantly worried about potential threats. You’re also more likely to experience problems with depression, anxiety, and fatigue.\n\nPost-traumatic stress may also cause changes in your body that affect the course of your Crohn’s or Colitis. You may be more likely to have flare-ups and a poorer disease outcome.\n\nIf you’ve been through a traumatic event, like a hospital stay, be aware that this could have a lasting effect on how you feel. It’s important to seek help when you need it. Read more in the section on Getting the help you need.\n\nEating problems\n\nFood can hold many challenges for people with Crohn’s or Colitis. You may feel that certain foods trigger your symptoms, which can put you off eating. This can be upsetting if you usually enjoy food. Medicines like steroids can affect your weight and this can change how you feel about eating too.\n\nThese challenges can lead to behaviours like binge eating, skipping meals, or restricting food. This means you may risk not getting enough nutrients from food, which can complicate your condition.\n\nFor some people, restriction of food may become severe, until they will only eat a narrow range of ‘safe’ foods. This is called Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID). Nearly 1 in 5 people with IBD have some symptoms of ARFID. Talk to your IBD team if you recognise these symptoms. They may be able to refer you to a dietitian, who can support you to improve your nutrition.\n\nYou can also develop eating disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia if you have Crohn’s or Colitis. If you think you may have anorexia or bulimia, speak to your IBD team or GP. They are treatable. Find out more about eating well with Crohn’s or Colitis in Food.\n\nBeat have more information about eating disorders.\n\nFind a community of people who understand what you’re going through. Crohn’s & Colitis UK have Local Networks of volunteers across the country.

There are different types of talking therapies.

But it’s worth remembering that good mental health is generally linked to a lower risk of problems and complications.\n\nFeeling better can take time. Everyone is different, and people respond to therapy differently. Seek as much support as you can until you find what works best for you.\n\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)\n\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) aims to help you accept difficult emotions and experiences. With Crohn’s or Colitis, these may include difficult thoughts and feelings you might have about living with your condition. At the same time, ACT encourages you to adopt positive life values and commit to actions and changes that move towards these values.\n\nACT can help you to engage with different situations that you might normally avoid if you’re worried about symptoms. You learn to accept and be open to living with emotions, concerns and beliefs that may be holding you back.\n\nThere are ACT workbooks and online programmes you can try.\n\nMindfulness-based therapies\n\nMindfulness involves focusing on the present, and noticing when we are stuck in patterns of worrying about the past or future. Mindfulness-based therapies build on mindfulness techniques in everyday life, like yoga and meditation. They can involve training in mindfulness through meditation and group discussions.\n\nMindfulness can be helpful for Crohn’s and Colitis, as a way of developing skills for managing stress. This can be useful when you’re dealing with a flare-up. Mindfulness-based therapies have been shown to help with things like anxiety and depression.
