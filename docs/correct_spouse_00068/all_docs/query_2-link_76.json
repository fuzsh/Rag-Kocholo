        "text": "Hello friends, welcome back to the show. My guest today is Peter Kron. He's a performance coach to athletes, professionals and celebrities, and we are talking about how to defeat your limiting beliefs. The beliefs and subconscious narratives that we hold shape our behaviour, health, relationships and performance, but by its very definition, the subconscious is difficult to tap into. So today, expect to learn how to step into the narrative loop of your own self-image. Why not feeling like you're enough is such a common occurrence,\n\nhow to be less hard on yourself, what our most dangerous inner monologues are, and much more. But now, it is time for the wise and wonderful Peter Crone. Peter Crone, look at the show. Thank you for having me, young man. Good to be here. What do you describe what you do for work? How do you describe it? Well, I mean the moniker that I've commonly become known as is the mind architect. In terms of what does that mean, my main product I tell people is freedom, really liberating people from the constraints of particularly\n\ntheir subconscious mind. So the primal patterns that have us as human being suffering anyway, I emancipate people from that mental prison. Why is the subconscious so important with that given the fact that a lot of people see their suffering coming from external factors or internal obvious triggers. Where does the subconscious fit into this? It's sort of the quintessential part of the iceberg that you can't see. You know, we've all seen those memes a million times as it relates to business and whatever it is. Like, you know, you can just see the tip that's someone's persona as we know them perhaps.\n\nBut until you get to the deep-aceted programming that really was created during the formative years of our childhood. And these are the constraints that we function within. And so if you really want to make any kind of lasting change in your life or any dramatic change and you've got to be able to access what are the parameters that a human being currently functions in versus sort of just changing the superficial behaviors which and you've got to be able to access what are the parameters that a human being currently functions in versus sort of just changing the superficial behaviors which a lot of people's, you know, are constantly trying to do and then they wonder why they revert back to old habits.\n\nHow much, how important is our subconscious in between the two? We've got the external factors. Is it that iceberg analogy? Do you think that what we see and what we perceive is only a small amount of what causes suffering or happiness? I mean, the immediate answer is yes. I mean, it's important, as important as the foundations of a house. You know, you could say, well, you know, really like this particular tap. You know, it's like gorgeous and it's gold-plated. Okay, that's awesome, but like, you know, where does that go in your master bathroom, and that's part of a 5, 6,000 square foot home, and all of it doesn't mean jack,\n\nunless you've got a solid foundation. If you built a foundation for a house that can only hold a 2,000 square foot building, then you can dream and aspire as much as you want for this beautiful, sprawling mansion, but it's not going to work. So, that's the equivalent in terms of construction, but that's someone's life. They want to make money. They want to have a beautiful relationship. They want to be in great shape.\n\nThey want to live for a long life. All of the things that people dream and aspire to can't happen if you're functioning within a foundation, aka, you're subconscious that won't permit it, won't make space for it. What does it mean to have a conversation or to interact with something which, by its very definition, is below the threshold of our unconsciousness? We're talking about trying to interact with something which by its very definition is below the threshold of our unconsciousness. We're talking about trying to interact with something which is purpose-built to not be noticeable. Yeah. So what does it mean to have a conversation with that? How do you even begin?\n\nYeah. Oh, it is. No. Well, you have to talk to Peter Kroner, obviously. That's why you're here. Peter. So yes, it gets a bit slippery and it's why I use the term reverse engineer. So where there's smoke, you know, where there's fire, right? Like so there's an implication. So the way that I work, certainly is when somebody does work with me and athlete and entertain a businessman, or whoever it might be, whatever it is that they believe they're dealing with, they're going to be able to present their story, their scenarios, their symptoms. And for me, that reveals, okay, if you experience depression, anxiety, addiction, relationship problems, financial problems, and ongoing disease, some sort of chronic condition, then it's\n\nrevelatory to me, meaning I'm able to go, oh, okay, if you deal with this particular superficial situation, then that tells me a lot about what must be beneath the surface. So it's a bit of a, I'd say it's actually a lot of a gift, but it's also, it is difficult for the individual to be able to just access their own subconscious, because it's sort of behind the eyes, literally and figuratively. So it takes somebody who's willing either to get reflection from somebody who knows how to listen in a powerful way, or to be able to sit still long enough to really inquire,\n\nlike through meditation as one example. What must I believe about myself at the deepest level that has me think, feel, and behave in a certain way that elicits these results versus just trying to change behavior? Most people function in the world of action, right? You go and see a specialist or an expert and they're like, oh, you do this, do that, shouldn't do that. Stop, it's all in the realm of behavior.\n\nSo that's maybe going to make some sort of transitory difference, but it's not going to be long-lasting if you haven't changed the fundamental code in the way that you view yourself, because you're still eventually going to have the same thoughts that lead to the same feelings, that then will create automatically actions, the habits, and the consequential results. So you've got to go to the center of who you are as a being if you want to make any kind of long-lasting profound change in your life. So that's what it looks like, is it's slippery, it's difficult, it takes a lot of intuition and invariably it takes reflection. You know, this is why I think relationships are beautiful because you\n\nmay not be going to see a pedicrone or a Therapeutic or someone who's worth their salt, but you know, you might have a girlfriend or a boyfriend or a husband or a wife or a mother-in-law And they trigger this shit out of you. Well, there's your therapist You know, it's like they pissed me off. They upset me You know, and okay great. Well, then that's just helping you to see, whereas your foundation to use the metaphor I gave earlier, a little bit shaky, where you aren't able to be with the circumstances of life without getting upset, that's the revelation process. So usually most people don't want to look at it as themselves. No, it really is my mother-law. If you met her, you would agree. Yeah, she's a bitch. Everyone around her says that she's a bitch.\n\nYeah, and you've got all the evidence to confirm, okay, great. Well, then you're stuck because you're right about the fact that you're a victim of circumstance. And that's one of the most powerless places for people to be. So life will continue to help you to see what's going on in your subconscious. It's just, are you paying attention?\n\nIt's obvious to me, sometimes you see people or you meet people and they have a, it's like a flavor to that imbues all of the things that they do. All of the different interactions, whether they be in a relationship, whether they be at work, whether it's to do with their fitness, their health, their happiness, whatever it might be, everything kind of has the same tenor. You know, it's like all on the same sort of frequency somehow. Everything's a bit it's a little bit passive-aggressive or it's a little bit kind of overly defensive or it's a little bit vulnerable or it's a little bit they don't take stuff seriously and it always seems\n\nto happen across a lot. And there is a unifying thread that brings all of that together. I'm going to guess that that is these unknown unknowns that sit in the subconscious. Yeah, it's, you know, if you're sitting in a world, a construct, then it's kind of like, it doesn't matter what you do, who you're with, what you wear, what you say, everything is being informed by that fundamental construct. Right, so right now, for example, we're all on planet Earth, you know, I don't know how big your audience is, I'm assuming it's not beyond the globe, but maybe it is. Welcome\n\nto those who are listening. Well, it's first intergalactic podcast, yeah, precisely. Yeah. But I'm going to guess that for the most part, people are on planet Earth somewhere. And one of the constructs that we all fall prey to, that we all have to abide by the laws of physics, is called gravity. Doesn't matter if you're in the UK or here in the states,\n\nor you're in Iceland, or Tim Buck too, or Australia. If you stand on a wall, don't go on a very high wall, but if you go on a two, three-foot wall and you jump, you're going to go down, hence why I don't want people to be on a massive wall. I don't want to eat injuries on this intergalactical podcast. But anyway, the point is that is a construct that we function within. And it doesn't matter where you go, that's going to be the case, right, that you're going to be able to jump\n\nto a certain degree, but you're always going to come back down. So likewise, in somebody's subconscious, whatever it is, your particular flavor to you said, you know, there's this sort of certain quality that is consistent in people's behavior, it's because they're being informed by the same construct for them. For someone that might be the world of, they don't feel like they're good enough, which everyone can relate to. So in their particular way of interacting\n\nin relationships in the workplace, in their home, in their body, there's this undercurrent of perfectionism. You know, Dave and he can't like ever kind of relax, you know, it's like he's always got to have his shit together and he's always well put together and, you know, he can't really tell you that things didn't go well because that would look bad. And he's being informed by the fact that at the deeper level, he doesn't feel good enough and so compensatory, like mechanism, the way that he's learned to protect himself and survive is to become a perfectionist, right?\n\nSo that's again where we could reverse engineers. He's someone's superficial behaviors the way that they consistently get the same results and then it will reveal Oh, okay, I can see that at a young age because his brother got more attention was a better athlete or was more successful in the school play, you know, or had greater academic results. Then Dave, relative to his older brother, felt somewhat inadequate and he made that mean that he wasn't good enough and then he developed his survival mechanisms, right? So that's what everyone's dealing with. They've got their own flavor of their personality. And even the word persona, right?\n\nAnd Greek relates to when they were doing plays, they would wear a mask and use this ballhorn to speak through as actors. And that was called the persona. It was a mask. And even though you see there's persons on the planet like that persona is something really that I'm revealing for somebody in the most compassionate, loving ways, nothing wrong with it, but it is going to be an obstacle\n\npotentially to the things that you want to create in your life. And if I can bring light to the constraint so that you can step outside of them, then you have a bigger bandwidth, you become more expanded and you have a greater life. So if you're into that kind of stuff. I like the analogy of it being your own personal laws of physics. I think that's really really cool. That you have certain things and you could look at somebody else and they're a different universe.\n\nAnd in their universe, perhaps the laws of physics actually manifest a little bit differently. And that could be the way that they deal with setbacks. And in your physical universe, the way that you're substrate, the source code within your subconscious is written that you have this program. If bad thing happens, run program, shit, your pants.exe or whatever it might be. Right.\n\nBut for this other person, he's like, well, he deals with it fine or she deals with it fine. How can that happens? Yeah. Yeah. And it's at that level that we can really say there's no such thing as choice, it's trigger and response, trigger and response. Right. So when you become increasingly aware of your code of your deep-seated programs, now we could say that there's a semblance of responsibility, right, which is access to\n\nBeing a powerful human being so if I know the mechanism to run me by virtue of how I've been conditioned over time Then I have a choice if I'm in the program. There's no choice It's just literally external stimulus, internal reaction. And we see this, you know, people in traffic, someone cuts you off, it's like, yeah, you fucking idiot. You know, it's like, that's not a choice response. That is purely automated. And it can lead to a lot of, you know, blood and scuffed fists and whatever, you know, but it's, if you start to go, wow, I'm under the impression that like a piece of metal and plastic with a human being in it driving that I don't even know who they are. That reaction is saying that I'm giving them power over my emotional state. Now when you broke it\n\ndown, it's like it's completely nonsensical. I don't even know who that person is. And I'm saying they are in charge of my internal wellness, right? And when you see that, it's like, well, why would I give that person so much command over my emotional well-being? Well, you wouldn't, if you were like a rational, intelligent, like responsible human being, and that starts to give that idea of self-responsibility. I'd be like, okay, that person coming in front of me in the traffic adds maybe like one to two seconds in my day. But I watched crap TV for three hours a night.\n\nLike, really is that really going to change the fact that I'm not a multi-millionaire with a six-pack and dating a supermodel or whatever that person wants? Like, no, I mean, you start to go, hang on a minute, I'm just a victim of my own conditioning. Not even a victim of circumstance, I'm a victim of my own programming that I'm oblivious to and becoming a powerful human being is to reveal the programming that I have by virtue of my childhood, which is no slow in parents.\n\nIt's not like my mom and dad's fault, they're doing the best they can within that programming. So we get out of the blame game too and go, oh, hang on, is this sentient being a soul who's incarnated? I've taken on this code. And perhaps we could say that my opportunity is to reveal the code and transcend it so that I step into a much broader expanded version myself and consequently great thing shop in my life. Boom and the story. It's interesting. It's interesting thinking about just how much deep programming we can do. Is there a state where you can get to where you've\n\ndissolved so much subconscious that it's actually a disadvantage? Not that I'm aware of. You think that most people just have more to do? Well, I don't know how your work and your vision of the subconscious maps onto sort of dissolving of the ego and letting go, etc. But yeah, I can imagine a world within which people became so enlightened or they became so detached from their subconscious and what their actual internal programming is supposed to do. For instance, your body keeps you breathing all the time. You don't consciously have to think about that. It is a subconscious action that keeps that going.\n\nAnd there's a lot of wisdom inherent just in the way that we are. Now, a lot of that also manifests in a malignant or a non-adaptive, non-effective manner. But there's also certain things you put your hand in a fire. You don't really actually need to be taught not to do it. Your body is able to react in that sort of a way. I'm aware that that's slightly less cognitive and cerebral and a little bit more sort of within the body that's more embodied. But still, I wonder whether there is too far.\n\nIt would appear that you haven't found someone that's pushed it too far yet. No, because again, like I said earlier, when I was speaking specifically about the subconscious, I didn't say we're getting rid of everything that's part of your subconscious, like being able to get out of bed in the morning and walk over to the toilet and take a leak or then go to the kitchen and get a glass of water. That's part of your subconscious. If you remember, which most people won't, but if they're a parent, they certainly see it, which is as a three-month-old, they can't do that. Right? So part of the habituation of what it means to be a human and certainly an adult or after we get to about the age of two and we have\n\nfunctions like walking, running, balance. That's great aspects of the programming of the subconscious. But what I said is we want to remove the constraints, not like remove every piece of programming that you've ever downloaded and developed. No, that would, that probably wouldn't look pretty. So it's really specifically to what I would consider these primal pieces of code that are all in the realm of survival. They're fundamentally based in fear. That's the, they're the constraints of the subconscious that I'm reconciling and dissolving for people. Like, I love the fact that you know how to ride a bike or you can ride a motorcycle or at speed around a corner.\n\nLike, you know, good for you. But if you do it from a perspective of I am trying to impress my girlfriend on the back because I'm scared that no one loves me, yeah, you know, that might not end well, right? So, you know, like that goes back to the, oh, mate Dave, you know, is trying to show off all the time. What are the most, nothing against all the days out there.\n\nYeah, to every, every Dave's pissing himself at the moment. And what are some of the most common patterns or constraints that you encounter in people subconsciously? And if you got like a top of the pops, top three or something? Top 10, I go, it's my book. You know, I've delineated what I consider be 10 prime or one. So obviously, and for, you know, self-evident reasons, I'm not going to list them all here\n\nbecause it's part of my book. But the one that I just gave is probably the most common, which is not feeling like we're enough. And that can manifest in different ways. Like I'm not pretty enough, smart enough, rich enough, you know, thin enough, whatever it is, sexual enough. Like that whole domain of not enoughness is itself a dis-ease that human beings all can relate to and many people are defined by. So helping people to transcend that and see that's just a piece of code, it's not a truth, it's something that you've got evidence for based on the way that you were brought up as I said using Dave and his older sibling. It could be somebody who wasn't picked for the footy team or you know the hockey team or you team or the first time they went on\n\na date and they really felt like they were attracted to someone. They never heard back from them. They've used that external evidence as a means of triggering an internal dialogue that I would assert they actually arrived with. It wasn't like something happened that gave it to you. It was external stimulus was what turned it on very much like epigenetics. And that's just in the emotional realm. So, then you'll spend the rest of your life and most part trying to compensate for that. People pleasing perfectionism, you've got to look sexy,\n\nyou've got to be wealthier, you've got to be thinner. As a way of offsetting, the deep seated belief that you're not enough in the first place, which only continues to perpetuate it. That's the madness, right? Of these compensatory patterns that people use, all they're doing is actually sustaining the very deep-seated fear that we're trying to mitigate. Whoops. And then you wonder why people need to drink so much. Yeah, well, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy in that way, right? Yeah.\n\nYeah. But every time that you do it, even if you fix the problem, even if you spend enough time to do the thing, to make the thing happen or not happen that you were afraid of happening or not happening, even if you do that, it's still reinforcing, I am the sort of person who dot dot dot needs to do this in order to make the situation feel good, to feel loved, to feel sufficient. Yeah, it's um, it doesn't surprise me that people get into adulthood and they have these unexamined challenges in life. Yeah, I mean there's just the feeling, the blanket of like what do people deal with?\n\nLike that, a whole umbrella of what we could call suffering. I mean, the usual suspects, like anxiety, depression, sleeplessness, addiction, relationship woes, lack of finances, disease is a huge one. The body starts to manifest over time, the chronic internal sense of absence of ease. And that's gonna affect some sort of tissue system over time. It's just what people call life nowadays, and it becomes normalized in my world. It's not normal at all. It's very unnatural, actually, for people to be suffering.\n\nSo pain is one thing. If you fall over your scuff, your knee, you kick the coffee table accidentally with your toe, or maybe not accidentally, you know, your pest is going to hurt. That's pain. But suffering as it relates to the psychological and emotional state for human being to me is optional once you understand these deep-seated patterns. And that makes for a very different experience of being human. And would certainly make for a very different world than the one that we currently live in.\n\nHow do people step into the narrative loop of how they see themselves? Just this recursive echo chamber of your own thoughts in your own head, da da da da da da da, this problem, this problem, this problem. How do people start a break point in that? Listen, learn to listen. You know, if you're with one of your mates, girlfriend, you know, a family member, your sister, your mom, it doesn't really matter if someone's struggling with something.\n\nAs an observer of their experience, we tend to come naturally, hopefully, from a position of loving compassion and we want to make a difference. We want to, oh, it's okay. My mother, certainly, with a child who's fallen over they're crying or they're upset because they didn't get picked for a team or they're hungry and they're cranky. We hold space for that person naturally. If your friend's struggling with something that gone through a breakup, you're like, oh, it's all right, mate, you know, don't worry, we'll figure it out.\n\nLike the energy that we bring to that is love and compassion as a holding. When it comes to her own dialogue, we tend to berate the shit out of ourselves. So listen is the first place. I did a live during the whole COVID thing. The girl who was hosting it said, gosh, I've got to talk better to myself, to her point about her own sort of negative dialogue. I said, actually, what about if you just listen better to yourself?\n\nAnd it really was like in that moment, you could see that she really was like, oh my gosh, I never looked at it like that. So if we understand, like we were saying earlier, these things are habituated, meaning your conditioning from your subconscious is just arising by virtue of the container that you're in through no fault of your own, then that dialogue is, it's already there. It's too late, right? Like it's already risen and the conversations that we have in our head, that's a byproduct of whatever construct you're still stuck in. So it's really about listening to, wow, like,\n\nI really am quite awful to myself. The conversation that's going on in my head is really quite derogatory. And if it was a friend of yours speaking that way about themselves, your tendency would be to like, mate, mate, no, that's not you, you know, you're amazing. And unless it was a guy who cut you in traffic, and then you're like, no, you are a dick. You are a dick, yeah. I'm sorry.\n\nSo having more love and compassion for self, but through the facility of listening to the thoughts versus being the thoughts. The trouble is with an individual is that the thoughts arise in our head, they're so close to us. versus being the thoughts. The trouble is with an individual is that the thoughts arise and I head they're so close to us. Listening to somebody else as this illusion of space, it's much easier to feel removed from their situation or their narrative. But when we're sitting in the car by ourselves or in the shower, we're just about to go to bed, wherever we are usually\n\nby ourselves, there's this dialogue and it feels like that's that's that voice in my head, that's who I am. And it's really not, it's inherited, it's something that you've learned over time to just believe to be the self and set off like, what if that was like this, you know, mildly annoying roommate you have. And if you could look at it through that lens and go, wow, what was my roommate talking about now? And that would at least start to spark the listening facility, faculty of a human. Then you can investigate the validity of what you're listening to. Is it really true? Like, one of the very sort of quick tips I tell people, is put a question mark at the end of everything that you hear in your head. Just put a question mark.\n\nYou're a fucking idiot. You're a fucking idiot. I mean, it still might be a yes, but. I don't know, but at least you get to have a conversation about it versus it's just a bold statement. I really like the idea of trying to create that space, trying to create that third party perspective between you and your thoughts.\n\nIt took me, man, I must have first heard you are not to your thoughts on some pithy Instagram quote, probably, like eight years ago in between a funny cat video and a bootie picture. And it's taken me, it's, honestly, took me until a couple of years ago to really, really genuinely understand and truly inculcate that I'm not, that the voice that appears in your head is no more you than the voice that you, Peter Krohn, are giving to everybody that's listening\n\nright now. It's not, it's just this bizarre conglomeration of things that are happening now and things that have happened in the past, and it just pops up and you're totally right, you should question absolutely everything that your mind says, because you don't know what you're going to think next. I don't know what I'm going to think next. Any more than I know what you're going to say next. When you genuinely realize that, you think, oh God, well, I mean, that means maybe that I shouldn't have quite so much faith and trust in the words that appear in my own sort of mental landscape.\n\nYeah, that then, to me, what that pulls for and what it listens is the ability to observe. Like, it's almost like a fascination, a curiosity that inspires, right? Versus it's the ability to observe. It's almost like a fascination, a curiosity that inspires. Versus, it's a factual, gospel dialogue that I'm hearing in my head. It's like, wow, I'm curious to see what crap I'm going to come up with today. Let's see what garbage narrative, I can pay attention today and see if I can transcend that. Most people buy straight into it and that defines their emotional state. And if their mind is telling them you're useless, what's the point, and there's going to be an apathy in a resignation and a lethargy in their body,\n\nand then they're not going to take action. First is, I had a beautiful group of seven women at my house as a sort of a retreat event. And, you know, one of the women there, they're all well to do, they've got resources, they're educated, they're smart, was really caught in this world of playing the second fiddle, you know, like for her, she was just not that special. But there's no evidence for that, like in reality, other than whatever she would attribute to that narrative, right? Oh, well, because of this and because of that. Like, she's using circumstantial evidence to confirm a narrative that is\n\ncompletely debilitating for her. And I said, well, what if I told you you were the most important person on the planet? And I mean, you look at her eyes, well, what if I told you you were the most important person on the planet? And I mean, you look at her eyes, like, you know, just the idea of stepping into that arena, that conversation. No more true than the one that she's not very special, but boy, does it give a entirely different experience of herself, to begin with, she said, God, that'd be so uncomfortable. But it's only uncomfortable relative to what you've become accustomed to, which is that you know, no one gives a shit about you.\n\nYeah, do you want the familiar, the familiar hateful discomfort of self-loathing, or do you want the new scary discomfort of being the person in the center of the stage? Yeah, and for her, I was using that. It's not that everyone needs to be sent to stage, but like to use it purely as a point of comparison, if you were the most important person on the planet, like literally, like that's not that everyone needs to be center stage, but like to use it purely as a point of comparison, if you were the most important person on the planet, like literally, like that's a statement of fact, not like I'm just having fun, like how would you feel?\n\nAnd like you could see the interpretation, but the mild excitement for her was sort of around the arena of a relationship, like, you know, for her to be not that special, and then she wondered why she's single, it's like, well, hello, you know, it's like it's simple physics, right? But if you're the most important person in the planet, you're going to have suitors left right and center just by virtue of the shift in your own frequency and your own energy, which you're going to give rise to the people that you attract, not because you're going to be walking\n\naround from a position of arrogance, like she would never get back, because she was too familiar in her own sense of inadequacy. But just to be able to nudge the needle into a place of some semblance of self-worth, that would then be the precursor to men being attracted to her versus like energetically, just the way she just holds herself a body. It's a little bit like she's cowering and the way she dresses. And you know, all of that is an extension of her own dialogue. So you change the narrative, that is physics. You now have a different vibratory state, you function from a different frequency,\n\nyou think differently, you feel differently, you act differently, and consequently you get different results. I mean, it just works every time. So the way that we interpret as well, right? Because the same situation could be experienced by two different people and the frame that they go into that experience with, they could have completely differing results.\n\nSomeone could not get the job in a particular job application and come out with it and think, you know what it is, I did everything, that I nailed it, I absolutely nailed it, gave it my all, it just wasn't my day. That different version of a different person would come in and say, you know, it was because I wasn't enough of this or I should have done more of that or whatever it might be. So we actively seek for\n\nevidence in the external world that proves to us the predetermined narrative that we decided to go into the exchange within any case. So it's almost like, it's unfolcifiable in a way. Any contrary evidence to what it was that we wanted or we predicted was going to happen is going to be discounted because that's imposter syndrome, right? That's when you say, oh, no, no, no, no, that that was just a fluke or that doesn't always happen to me or whatever excuse you want to give it, yeah, precisely. And all of the stuff, even if it isn't true, or even if it's super rare, all of the other stuff that's in there that does confirm the narrative we went into it with,\n\nwe think, oh yeah, yeah, that's the true me. That's, that always happens. No, you always see that happening. Not that always happens. You always manage to find it, the needle in the haystack. Yeah, yeah, because the number one priority and prerogative of any egos to be right. I mean, having done this for 20 years, it was just fascinating to\n\nmeet and consistently see that pattern of like, wow, people would rather be right about their inadequacies and securities and their limitations than actually create the life that they apparently espouse about wanting to have. And when you see the madness of that, you really see one of the fundamental flaws of the ego, which is self-righteousness, right? And this is what we see in relationships, like what is one of the ways that people garner any sense of self-alews, well, if I can make somebody else wrong, whether it's\n\nmy wife, my kids, my parents, my neighbors, for the fucking fact that they haven't trimmed the head yet, or whatever it is, you'll find anything to make someone else wrong, which is really another means of trying to garner desperately some sense of self-value. We just do it through a narrative, which itself by definition is limited. So people get to be right consistently. I'm like, wow, wow, that's, you know, congratulations. You're right about your insecurities and your inadequacies.\n\nThat's so, so fucking inspiring, you know, you have become the architect of your own misery. Yeah. That's the old expression you probably saw between your cat videos and your booties in one another pithy quote of yours. But it says, you know, you fight for your limitations and their yours, right? So I remember this was one of my professional golfers, like I actually ended up cadding for him. Love the guy, we had a lot of success, we tripled his winnings in two years,\n\nbut he hadn't actually got the win, but tripling somebody's business in two years is significant, you know, whatever it is, like for him, an average million a year as a player and we got to 3.5 in our second year, you know, that it is like for him and average million a year as a player and we got to 3.5 in our second year You know, that's a that's a good return, right? But you know, I remember this one green we steps on it hit it into so it was a powerful like he's Quote you know playing within the parameter of what you're trying to accomplish and anyone in those golf you want to make the part and make a birdie\n\nI handed in the pattern you said watch me three put this so the part and make a birdie. I handed him the pattern and he said, watch me three-part this. So now that's not conscious, that's him being scared because it was a bit of a tricky part, but it's his way of justifying and offsetting any potential failure, but at least even if he did three-part it, where he garners a little bit of self-pr pride is I was right about it. Even though like that shitty on a scorecard, it's not going to help us in the tournament, but that's how subtle yet, how destructive the ego can be. So it's a protective, it's like a prophylactic mechanism, isn't it? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Get to be right. Well done. Congratulations. I'm so inspired. You're never going to meet anyone. No one loves you and you're a dog shit at whatever your career is like. Yeah, wow. How do I sign up for that program?\n\nWe don't need me the my dark attack. I mean clearly you're just like you know how you don't have millions of people following your programs. I know. Sistine Chapel of dog turds here. Yeah. Yeah. You've got to talk about limitations and stuff. You've got to quote that says life is as difficult as you are limited. What does that mean? Well, it's sort of within the realm of everything we discuss, which is I like to use metaphors. I think it helps people to understand.\n\nSo if somebody went to a yoga class and I've gone with many of my athletes who are extraordinary athletes in their field, but you know, they've never been to yoga or they've rarely been. And so we're back to the cysteine-chapelid dog ship, which is their practice. And they're like, wow, this is so difficult. And like, no, it's not difficult. You're just stiff. So it reveals their constraints. And likewise to myself, it's not like I'm some sort of handy bendy go, you know, candy yogi. Like, you know, I've got tight shoulders from whatever I do and like my hamstrings. And so that reveals equally my constraints through the practice of yoga, but obviously the more\n\nyou practice it, the more you can expand. So likewise with the mind, you're going to be triggered, you know, or you're going to see your quote, quote, tight hamstrings emotionally and mentally where you have some constraint. So then life appears difficult. It's not difficult. It's just you're looking through a lens of inadequacy. For somebody who doesn't have that lens, the same circumstance occurs as either easy or an opportunity. So external can be the same, but as you were saying earlier, two, three, five million minds are going to have a different interpretation based on their quote-unquote mental flexibility. So for me, one of my favorite quotes to myself is, can I be with this?\n\nWhich for those people aren't so familiar with my work, it's maybe sort of an uncommon series of words, and it might sound a little poetic or as a tarot, but what I'm really saying is, whatever is unfolding, whatever circumstance that I'm being presented with, can I be with it without being quote, quote, emotionally triggered or affected? I don't slip into frustration, anger, disappointment, depression, anxiety, I'm able to hold space for whatever is happening and stay internally quite centered. So that's again where life is as difficult as you're limited, but for that reason, life is the gift to reveal where we are limited so that life becomes less difficult because\n\nwe expand our quote-unquote perceived limitations. Well, that's the Marcus Aurelius and also the Shakespeare line, right, which is the universe is change and life itself is but what you deem it. Then two people can see the same situation in completely different ways, which means that you can also see the situation in a completely different way. But there are what I like that you've brought up there is that\n\nit's not as if changing your subconscious is going to make all of the situation the outcomes of the situation is necessarily change. You're not going to be better at yoga by having a better subconscious an opportunity. He said it's opportunity or it's going to be easy. And that's nice, that it's not just about, it's not outcome focused. So necessarily about whether or not you do or don't, it's about how you interpret doing or daunting. Yeah, and there's a little subtlety in there, like, you know, I also, like you would, you know, the Shakespeare quote, he said, nothing is either good nor bad, only thinking makes it so. Right. So again, that points to the fact that life is the way it is, but then it's our own interpretation that's going to give our subjective perspective.\n\nBut then I would also say that there is some power in shifting the subconscious that would actually elicit a different response without the practice of that. So to continue the yoga theme, response without the practice of that. So to continue the yoga theme, it would require a proper case study, but for those people who are internally constrained, they went to a yoga class and we could, you know, as best as possible quantify their ability to do yoga. And then if we did shift their subconscious, it's my assertion that actually they would be better at yoga without having practice opening up because there would be a softness about them. There would be better at yoga without having practice opening up because there would be a softness about them, there would be a release. So that's a power, I have seen it time and time again with my athletes, like so many beautiful stories where\n\nwithout shifting anything to do with their technique or their profession, but having a different mindset, they got an instantaneous different result. Like, one of my baseball players hadn't had a home run for almost the span of an entire season. It was over two seasons, but almost the length of a six-month season. And he wasn't one of the big hitters who traditionally get 30 home runs a year or whatever. And he wasn't a small guy who might get five or six home runs. But he was sort of middle of the pack, 15, 16 home runs. And he hadn't had any for about five and a half months, again, over two seasons. And it was starting to really piss him off. And he's getting paid millions of dollars. So there's a certain degree of pride. He's also getting teased by his teammates,\n\nbecause that's what you know, guys doing a clubhouse or a locker room. And so literally he was sitting in the parking lot of the baseball stadium about two or three hours before the game calls me. I was new to the sport. I mean, I'm obviously a Brit. Like, where do we play baseball? It's rounders, you know? Which I don't know if that even exists anymore. But anyway, so I'm talking to this guy, and I took him to a place of complete acceptance, like profound acceptance, not only the fact that he hadn't, which is reconciliation of his history, because we're always fighting our past. Like, we haven't been able to digest something or accept something.\n\nAnd then that gets superimposed to a future where we're worried that there's going to be perpetuated. Right? That's basically how the brain is functioning from a place of prediction and protection. We're using our history to predict something and then we're trying to protect ourselves from it, not realizing what we're actually doing is perpetuating the history that we've yet to actually reconcile. That was a lot there if people want to rewind that and really get that, that would be a lot of value. Anyway, he suddenly realized, okay, it's what's happened. And I said, if you never hit a home run ever again in your life, could you be okay? It's not what we want. It's certainly not what I'm here to help you with. But emotionally, could you go, you know what, okay, that could well be the case,\n\nunlikely, but I'm going to find profound acceptance. We got him to a place where he was genuinely okay with it. That night, second at bat, we're playing St. Louis Cardinals, boom, home run, right? And I mean, the text that I got from after the game is just like, you know, it's like worth the price of entry in my work. It's just so fun and gratifying to see the instantaneous results of people get when there's a shift in mindset. So I love real life stories like that where you can see that when you look through different eyes, you will immediately see a different world versus trying to change the world that\n\nyou don't like, but keeping the same eyes. That's tiring. It's very rare that you're ever going to encounter any sort of situation in which being more tense or more uptight or adding pressure to it is going to help. Almost never, you know? And it's easy to say it in yoga where the whole point of the practice\n\nis to be relaxed and to breathe into the places. And it's quite slow usually and quite sort of placid, painful, but placid. But even if you take MMA, fighters don't want to go in there being tense and having applied more pressure to themselves than they need, they need to be alert, but they want the training to take over.\n\nThey don't want the front brain to be too active. They just want to be seeing and feeling and moving. And yeah, the same in baseball as well. Yeah. Only sport for sure, but we could say just in life generally, you know, I don't know if painful and placid is like what you have on your rumble profile or how girlfriends describe precisely precisely what I aim for. Yeah, it is, it is painful but placid. Just what every girl's looking for. Yeah, it's that, you know, physiologically is a reflection of self protection, isn't it? Like, you know, if someone was to come running at you, there's an instantaneous primal reaction to brace for impact, right? That's detention.\n\nAnd that's the holding. So if we look at that energy psychologically what's happening is when positioned in when we're in a position of any kind of self-preservation, it may not be overtly obvious, but people internally serve you in a state detention. There's a there's a perceived threat and that's how most people live their lives. There's this perceived threat that boss leaves you a message or you got a, you know, your late coming home from the golf course and you know, last time you did that that the girlfriend or the wife got upset.\n\nAnd, you know, you're in your car, it's fancy, it's got nice leather and however many cup holders and, you know, whatever convinced you to buy the damn thing. And now you're like, oh wow, I'm gonna get into quote unquote trouble, which would be a remnant of when I was a child and I was told off by my dad. And it's the same emotional response, but something that's being created over a future event\n\nthat hasn't happened yet. And that whole cycle is how most people live their lives. It's just like these continual perceived threats and it's exhausting. And they're one of the world, especially here in the States, is so medicated. So let's say that someone, yes, self-medicated, let's say that someone is attuned to this. People that are listening, I'm blown away constantly by just how insightful the audience\n\nthat listens to this show are. I swear that they inhabit a different part of the internet to the part that I usually see on Twitter, because the comment section of... Yeah, but just the comment section of my videos appeared nothing like the ones that I see anywhere else on YouTube, which is awesome. So let's say that as there probably is,\n\nthere's people that are listening who are mindful. They've got that insight into a little bit of metacognisms, they've got a sliver of awareness into their own programming. What next? What next? They realize that they have patterns that aren't serving them. They've got these limitations. They're aware of the limitations and they want to change. Yeah. What next?\n\nHelp others, you know, pay it forward. That to me is the immediate response is because if we were to look at the arc of mastery, most human beings are going to come from a position of, we start with that, which we're oblivious to, right? And that's where we have compassion. We have patience with each other, hopefully, to realize that we're all functioning within our own limitations, most of which we are completely oblivious to.\n\nSo as you become aware of a pattern, maybe through a series of relationships and you recognize, wow, I've had the same thing show up or in my career, and I'm the consistent theme. So maybe that's a bit of a clue. You know, I used to think it was my ex, but then it was the other ex, and then it's like, wait, I'm the one that's in all of those relationships.\n\nSo shit. So then we become aware of a pattern that was previously a constraint. So now we're conscious of it and that's going to take some practice and work to actually overcome that pattern. So to answer your question again about your audience being somewhat tapped in and aware and they've done their own work, maybe they're in that space, if they're aware of their patterns and maybe they've transcended many of them, I would assert there's still going to be subtle ones, you know, unless your audience is able to walk on water and manifest shit out of thin air, then there's still work to be done. Because of course, I'm doing that every day, but anyway.\n\nSo the point is the more that we can help those who are oblivious, we're paying it forward and in so doing, like any teacher, as you teach your craft, then you become more proficient in it. So that would be the next iteration of their own evolution, is to take, obviously, where requested, don't do this shit unsolicited, you're going to meet with a lot of defense and self-protection. Just pointing out people's patterns without them asking you to doesn't usually go well. So it's wherever you see the opportunity to make a difference to help somebody recognize\n\nwhy they have this tendency to self-sabotage. That person now is going to be reinforcing their own insights and simultaneously, like I do with you, I use metaphors and analogies on the fly. Some of course I've used before, but oftentimes many of them are just born of the moment. And so then I'm a beneficiary of my own mind's capacity to create an analogy that even I haven't heard before by virtue of our conversation. But that only happens if I'm going quote, you know, here, not necessarily helping you personally, but I am paying forward my insights to society.\n\nSo that would be my response is, you know, help others. Once you can kind of, to a certain degree, get out of your own way, now you get to have the joy and gratification of helping others to do the same. You encourage people to ask the question, who would I be without all of my concerns? I really, really love that. Can you explain why it's an important question? Yeah, who would you be in the absence of your concerns is really an invitation to look at what becomes available once we step out of the constraints in this case of what we've\n\nbeen talking about, the subconscious. And it really appeals to what I would assert is our innate inherent quality of being a free being, an unlimited, a boundless. This is why you watch movies like Limitless with Bradley Cooper or Lucy. I think it was with Scarlett Johansson. Wherever there's this sort of cellular version of superhumans and even LaHole,\n\nsuperhero movies that we all love like, love and have seen, they appeal to a bigger aspect of what it means to be human, like what is my potential? And so that question certainly gets a lot of attention and it really is inspiring for people to go, wow, gosh, like who would I be in the absence of my concerns? It's really just appealing to and triggering\n\nwhat I would, is actually our true nature to come forward, you know, with the real Chris step forward, not the Chris that is, you know, thinking that, oh, well, because of this and what my dad said and this, you know, this job didn't work out that I'm, you know, I'm an okay guy, but I'm kind of like, you know, I'm not doing as well as I could or that constraint, that limitation is direct opposition to what I would assert is your abundant nature. So the question really just helps to, feel to that deeper sense of true boundlessness.\n\nIsn't it bizarre that it feels like everything that is in our subconscious that's part of the source code of who we are is compelling us to be less than we could be if you think about what our genetic predisposition is even in terms of our Revolution, we're wired towards unsatisfactoryness. We are wired towards anxiety and threat response and identification and then Even if you say, okay, so tonight it's not technically a blank slate, right? You've got things that are there that are a part of you by virtue of being the species that you are.\n\nAnd then you arrive in this world and you spend the first decade and a half to two decades to for some people three or four decades without really starting to question the things that you've accumulated along the way, the people that brought you up, the interactions you had during formative years, and all the traumas you went through, and all the successes that you went through, and what they told you about who you are, and then you get to this point where you think, right,\n\nit's time for me to kind of open up the hood of this vehicle and have a little bit of a look underneath. And man, it's a wonder to me that people find any degree of enlightenment, because there's so much conspiring to make life challenging. Yeah. Oh, no, it is. And I take a look under the hood,\n\nI'm assuming you have that point in your life, what are you talking about? People get plastic surgery. So we... No. No, although you are in LA, so I guess that that might be the first place that your mind goes to for a reason. I'm just thinking of all the midlife crisis and the stupid things that humans do, like no judgment, but like that would not necessarily\n\nhappen if to your point they did discover what was really going underneath the hood of like, wow, I spent four decades thinking that I'm useless or I'm worthless. Yes, it is. But I would assert, you know, that's the beauty of this paradigm of why we're here as human beings, you know. That is the mechanism by which we get to evolve and to discover our true nature is that we need the resistance of perceived constraint. That's the game that we're here to play as you arrive with your bucket of fears. Life will present you at the circumstances to trigger them and then the winner, so to speak, or success is the person who gets beyond them. And that's a different way of looking at the arc of\n\nwhat it means to be human. I've got many clients who've got more money than time. I've worked with a couple of dozen billionaires over the years and that doesn't mean that they are by any stretch of the imagination, the most successful people I've ever met. They could be the most, you know, hostile, angry, you know, detached, lonely, isolated, depressed, anxious, as well as anybody else. And so it's not to be found in this sort of external material, trappings. Success to me is the degree to which you've discovered true in a piece and freedom. So it changes the game.\n\nSo yes, it is at one level bonkers. And it's like, well, what the hell? You know, what are we all doing here? And all the questions that people eventually ask, as you said, oftentimes in the third or fourth decade on the planet. But it's like, well, to me, it's like you're here to transcend constraint, discover freedom, and then inspire others to do the same. That's the game that I play. What are the questions, have you got? I really like who would I be in the absence of my concerns?\n\nIs there anything else that people can use to meditate on for the next couple of days? I mean, the traditional one from Ramana Mahashi, you know, one of my coin quotes, inspirations, he was a traditional Indian guru. He would have, you know, a satsang like in his ashram, people would come and have these dialogues and questions. He was renowned for the question, who am I? Very simple, who am I?\n\nAnd the immediate response to most people would be like, well, I'm Chris, you know, it's like, you know, and I'm 30, whatever years old and love me, like, but if you go a little beyond that, like, okay, really? Like, were you born Chris or was that given to you? You know what I mean? It's like, you come out the womb. It's like, hey, what's going on, everyone?\n\nI'm Chris, nice to meet you. Like, can I get some milk or something from someone's baby? You know, I mean, we had no quote, quote labels, right? We're being resentient. We sleep, we eat, we poop. Like, you know, there's the process of the organism. But the persona has yet to be established. And so you look at something like nationality religion.\n\nLike that baby, that babies that are being right born right now around the planet. They have no clue about being Christian, Catholic, Muslim, Hindu, like that doesn't mean anything, you know. So these are the things that get accumulated over time. So if we can start to question who am I beyond the labels that I've accumulated over time, without judgment of the labels, but it just really opens up to a much more unified perspective of being human. It was certainly would mitigate all of the nonsense that we see around religious wars and racism\n\nand all of that crap. That's just based in pure ignorance and the fact that people are attached to their labels and they want to make other people wrong for their labels. It's like, really, that's how intelligent this species is. I mean, we're not even close to an advanced society. It's like it's just complete nonsense. So, dude, I've thought so much about how challenging it would be for any of the civilization that wants to become space-faring\n\nor colonizer galaxy. We don't know much about what aliens could look like. We don't know whether they're silicon based or carbon based. We don't know much about what aliens could look like. We don't know whether they're silicon based or carbon based. We don't know whether they exist underwater or anything. One of the things that I can almost guarantee you about any of their extraterrestrials is that their civilization could not be much more emotionally charged or in equivalent than ours. charged or an equivalent the hours. Right. If you turn the emotional set point of this species up by another 10% or 15% or something, nothing's getting done.\n\nAbsolutely nothing's getting done. When you think about that, I genuinely believe that it's true. When you think about that, you're like, oh my God, we are close to terminal velocity for emotionality of an advanced species. That's mental to realize that. Right. Yeah. Yeah, it's, I mean, it's something that I sit and vacillate a lot just by virtue of the\n\nfact that's how my mind thinks. But I look at society today and it's, you know, excuse my friends, we're fucking embarrassing, you know, as a species. Like the fact that somebody is going to discern that because of someone's skin color that they are in some way a lesser person, whatever the color is, it's black, it's your Asian, you're Hispanic, like, like, it's just, it just speaks to the absolute pure ignorance of the human being. Then we have the audacity to think that we're the smartest on the food chain. It's like, no, you're literally killing the planet, your own home. Look at our species.\n\nWe harm ourselves, but we talked about the dialogue and then certainly the dog-shit food that people put in their systems, the alcohols, the drugs. Like, that's literally poison. So you're harming yourself, you harm others, whether it be through verbal or, you know, critical derogatory and then even physical abuse and harm. And then we harm our planet. We've got the trifecta of stupidity. Right? And then you wonder why you can't fucking have a good relationship. It's like, are you kidding me? You're a moron. I'm saying that with love and compassion. And again, I really want to emphasize because it seems like, oh, Peter Groan, like he's\n\nsaying, no, I'm saying it as objectively. I include myself in the gamut at one point. Like I feel like I'm doing a good job of like, you know, slipping out of this stupidity at least. But I love the old quote of like, oh, as human beings, we only use 10% of our brain, right, or whatever it is. I'm like, how accurate can even that statement be if you're only using 10% of your brain? Like, if you're only using 10% of brain, then any of the assumptions that arise out of that limited perspective is probably going to be pretty inaccurate. So you just see the stupidity of the vicious cycle by which we, as going to say, function\n\nas human beings, it's really just, you know, survive. We don't really function. So anyway, you know, that's, you know, to your alien point, I always find it funny as well that like if aliens were to come and apparently that's going to be the next narrative in this whole COVID bullshit and this new world order or whatever's going on. Like now let's start to get them worried about aliens and propagate the fear underlying that you know these the madness that's going on is because that's you know triggering all of the fear responsive. So even in our response to an alien invasion it would be we would because by virtue of the fact that we're designed to protect\n\nourselves, it would be a perceived threat. So, oh, they're bad. Let's kill them and you see the movie arrival, right? Like, here's this intelligence species, it will actually try to gift you a different way of communicating that gives you an insight into the future, like that's obviously the movie script. But hang on a minute, if like these people have ships and they're around us and they can fly around and go through time and they're in different places, like I'm going to make a pretty confident assertion, they're way smarter than we are. So then how about we just listen instead of just trying to kill them, right? But no, it shows again, like the guy that goes to yoga, he's tight.\n\nOkay, there's something that you're not familiar with and it creates, you know, the fear response, which is showing that you're scared. It's a threat, right? So again, it just shows that as a species, we're functioning in fear and that's why for the most part, everything is so deleterious in our lives, on our planet, in our relationship.\n\nSo anyway, I got my soap box there for a minute because I'm like, holy shit shit like we are so unavolved It's like we are so immature. It's ridiculous. We're gods put for the wisdom man. That's it. Yeah gods But just shitty gods is Daniel Schmackton Berger said well Peter Krun, ladies and gentlemen If people want to check out more of your stuff or keep up to date with what you're doing, where should they go? Well, I'll be flying around in spaceships with my new buddies who've got the intelligence. Perfect. Perfect.\n\nThey can find me the dizzy heights of Instagram, Peter Krohn official, and then on my website pdakrohn.com. So pretty simple. And for Facebook users, I think I have Peter Krohn mind-hockey tech. I love it. Yeah, I'm not too afraid with all that shit. Dude, thank you very much for your time today.
