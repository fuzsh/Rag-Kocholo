Peter’s dad started raising him, but tragedy struck again when his father, the sole pillar of his support, perished in the MS Herald of Free Enterprise ferry disaster in March 1987 when Crone was just 17.\n\nThe loss of both parents left Peter with a profound sense of loneliness, propelling him to strive for an extraordinary life in honor of his father’s wishes.\n\nPeter is not married and does not have any children.
