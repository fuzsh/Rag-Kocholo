It was not immediately clear what had happened but was eventually ruled an accident. She was an alcoholic who fell and injured herself. Buried in Olney Cemetery Vault, Pendleton, OR. Her parents were both from France. Name also given as LaFontaine, as in her burial records. Two Olga Temples seem to have been in Umatillo Co., OR, at about the same time, given that this Olga died as a Temple and was buried as one. The other Olga, of whom only her marriages are known, has not been placed. It may be that Olga did marry two other men, but if so, in each case, she had to have returned to her original married name about a year after marrying the second one. That seems implausible. Parents: Gustave LA FONTAINE-126907 and Aglae PINSON-126908.\n\nSpouse: Ralph E. TEMPLE-9812. Olga G. LA FONTAINE and Ralph E. TEMPLE were married after 5 June 1917 in OR.51091"
