INC., Publishers INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL INDEX V > HILL DIRECTORY CO., Inc., publishers of Southeastern Directories (publishers of the Winston- Salem City Directory since 1932), present to subscribers and the general public, this, the 1959 edition of the Winston-Salem City Directory, which also includes City View, Hanes, Montview and Park Ter- race. Confidence in the growth of Winston-Salem's industry, population and wealth, and in the advance- ment of its civic and social activities, will be maintained as sections of this Directory are consulted, for the Directory is a mirror truly reflecting Winston-Salem to the world. The enviable position occupied by HILL'S Directories in the estimation of the public, has been es- tablished by rendering the best in Directory service. With an unrivaled organization, and having had the courteous and hearty cooperation of the business and professional men and residents, the publishers feel that the result of their labors will meet with the approval of every user, and that the Winston-Salem Directory will fulfill its mission as a source of authentic information pertaining to the community. Four Major Departments The four major departments are arranged in the following order: — I. THE YELLOW PAGES constitute the first major department of the Directory. This embraces a complete list of the names and addresses of the business and professional concerns of the city and vi- cinity, arranged in alphabetical order under appropriate headings — a catalog of all the activities of the city and vicinity. Preceding this catalog, likewise grouped under appropriate headings, are the adver- tisements and business cards of firms and individuals desiring to present a more complete list of their products or services than is possible in the catalog itself. The Yellow Pages represent reference ad- vertising at its best, and merits the attention of all buyers and sellers seeking sources of supply or mar- kets for goods. In a progressive community like Winston-Salem, the necessity of having this kind of in- formation up-to-date and always immediately available, is obvious. The Directory is the common in- termediary between buyer and seller, and plays an important role in the daily activities of the com- mercial, industrial and professional world. II. THE ALPHABETICAL LIST OF NAMES of residents and business and professional concerns is the second major department, printed on white paper. This is the only record in existence that aims to show the name, marital status, occupation and address of each adult resident of Winston-Salem, City View, Hanes, Montview and Park Terrace, and the name, official personnel, nature and address of each firm and corporation in the community. III. THE DIRECTORY OF HOUSEHOLDERS, INCLUDING STREET AND AVENUE GUIDE, is the third major department, printed on green paper. In this section, the numbered streets are arranged in numerical order, followed by the named streets in alphabetical order; the numbers of the residences and business concerns are arranged in numerical order under the name of each street, and the names of the householders and concerns are placed, opposite the numbers. The names of the intersecting streets appear at their respective crossing points on each street. Special features of this section are the designation of tenant-owned homes and the listing of telephone numbers. IV. THE NUMERICAL TELEPHONE DIRECTORY, on blue paper, is the fourth major department. Community Publicity The Directory reflects the achievements and ambitions of the community, depicting in unbiased terms what it has to offer as a place of residence, as a business location, as a manufacturing site and as an educational center. To broadcast this information, the publishers have placed copies of this issue of the Directory in Directory Libraries, where they are readily available for free public reference, and serve as perpetual and reliable advertisements of Winston-Salem and vicinity. The Winston-Salem Oui-of-Town City Directory Library Through the courtesy of the publishers of the Winston-Salem City Directory, a Directorv Library is maintained in the offices of the Winston-Salem Chamber of Commerce for free reference bv the gen- eral public. This is one of more than 700 Directory Libraries installed in the chief cities of the U. S. and Canada by members of the Association of North American Directory Publishers, under whose super- vision the system is operated. The publishers appreciatively acknowledge the recognition by those progressive business and pro- fessional men who have demonstrated their confidence in the City Directorv as an advertising medium, with assurance that it will bring a commensurate return.

In 1752-53 a small group of Pennsylvania Moravians, a Protestant denomination of Bohemian ori- gin, carefully selected and bought a large tract of land in Piedmont Carolina at the three forks of the Yadkin River. They named the tract \"Wachovia\" after the Austrian estates of Count Nicholas Louis von Zinzendorf, an early protector-patron of the sect. Two settlements were established, Bethabara in 1753 and Bethania in 1759. In 1766 a new settlement was carefully laid out in the center of the Wachovia tract and built according to definite plans. The tranquility-loving Moravians named their new town Salem, meaning \"peace.\" The small town grew rapidly under the care of the industrious fathers. A water system was estab- lished and dwellings, stores, and shops built. Tobacco was even then an important crop. The fathers con- secrated a graveyard, \"God's Acre,\" and founded a girls' school which has developed into the Salem Academy and College of today. The Revolutionary War brought to the thriving town Nathanael Greene's soldiers, and in 1781 Corn- wallis passed through Salem. The years after the war until the middle of the 19th Century were marked by such events as the establishment of the Nissen Wagon Co. in 1787; a visit from George Washington in 1791; the dedication of the Home Moravian Church in 1800; the first edition of Blum's Almanac in 1828; and the opening of the first bank in 1847. Cotton and wool manufacturing companies had been organized! and Salem by 1850 was a prosperous center of religion, learning and industry. By an act of legislature in 1849, Forsyth County was created from Stokes County. The county seat was established one mile north of Salem Square. In 1851, again by act of legislature, the new county seat was named \"Winston\" in honor of Major Joseph Winston, Revolutionary War hero. Salem was incorpo- rated in 1856; Winston in 1859. Winston developed rapidly as an industrial center and market. The year 1872 saw the first tobacco auction and the opening of the first tobacco factory. In 1885 the Chamber of Commerce of Winston and Salem was organized by far-sighted leaders who realized that together the two towns must build for the future. By the time of consolidation, Winston was already known for its textiles, hosiery, blankets knit goods, tobacco products, and tobacco market. In 1913, by popular vote, Winston and Salem were consolidated as Winston-Salem the \"Twin City\" The new city took as its motto \"Urbs Condita Adiuvando,\" meaning \"A City Founded Upon Co-operation.\" This motto puts into modern phraseology the old Moravian concept of \"Unitas Fratrum \" \"A Unitv of Brethren.\" Winston-Salem today is the leading industrial city of North Carolina and one of the South's leading industrial cities. The annual value of Forsyth County's manufactured products is over $1,000,000,000. Main Hall, Salem College, with Historic Heme Moravian Church (1£00) in Lsli Foreground The best of the old and the best of the new blend to make a progressive city still marked by a deep religious atmosphere, a love for music and arts, and a zeal for broad educational development.\" As did their fathers of yesterday, far-sighted citizens of today build always for the greater city of tomorrow.
