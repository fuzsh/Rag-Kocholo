        "text": "Hello J. Forbes,\n\nI looked up William Couche and Ellen Crone in the usual databes with no success. I think they must have been Church of Ireland. I asked someone I know who has the book for St Finbarre's cathedral (Protestant). Here is what he replied:\n\nHi Geraldine the name Crone is in the book eight times and Couch is there three times.some are recorded as foundlings.\n\nThe book is available to purchase at St.Fin Barre's Cathedral, that is where I bought it.\n\nThe name Crone also appears in the \"Register of the parish of the Holy Trinity \" Christ Church Cork. 1643-1669.\n\nSo maybe William Couche was Protestant? I think this may give you some clues as to how to proceed, now we know some Couches were definitely Protestant. I see that Thomas Crone was RC in his marriage document in 1833, but you don't know if he was related to Ellen,do you?\n\nThe Protestant records are in the RCBL in Dublin.https://www.ireland.anglican.org/about/rcb-library/online-parish-records\n\nThis looks as if it could keep someone busy for years, and I wish you good luck in your search\n\nHi Shayems\n\nThankyou so much for your reply and taking the time to answer as its very hard to get the records for this area however Ancestry has released information from the 20 plus volumns of the Casey collection which documents people in this area of Cork. However its still very difficult to access the information you require and did not get very far with it. The Couch/e records for my lot seem to fall into a few categories as I have found out Soem came from Cornwall others were in Ireland for many years some going back to 1650. I did find some information from Castlelyons a few days ago about a Richard, Henry and William who were there in 1766 from a Vicar in Castlelyons Thomas Clery is the reputed Popish Priest.Not one Friar resident in Parish which appears to be a religious census of Cork On this census record are noted on the 31 March 1766 Joshua Brown - Vicar of Castlelyons with Edward, John, Thomas and Christopher Couch as Protestants. These names recurr in my Couch/e relatives' children.\n\nThere is an Edward Couche bootmaker born in 1820 married 1845 Elizabeth Christie, father Silas Christy Mariner. Grooms father is noted as Aaron Couche and spouse Ann Cox father Robert who married in Killalole Clare IRE in 1845. Jane Couche is married in St finbars Cork and Ross to James Dawson in 1837 where my William and Ellen Crone were married in the same year also. There is a Mary Couche married about 1802 to a Dawson also suspect they may be related. Also some Couches appear to have married Regans also . My own William Couche Superintendant of Police came to Victoria, Australia and married about 1865 a Mary Ann Mc Carthy family from Tipperary father michel mother Margaret Darcy who were in London befor ethe children immigrated. There are a also a number of other Couches ie Henry, Edward. Richard etc who also came to Australia in 1800s I dont know if connected to mine or yours.\n\nCould you possibly give me more information about the dates and marriages of your Couche families ie Henry Couche bootmakers were from Mitchelstown and comprised the Peter Robinson settlers and migrated to Ontario about 1825 with similiar names I also found a Margaret who came to US and died there with a husband named Henry on her death records which you may have already have. I also have seen other records of a Couche who married a Driscoll think father was Henry in Evergreen St Cork-is he your family? the other lot is from Cornwall and Devon some being the Peter Robinson settlers some left behnd also The names Christopher Edward, Richard, John, James, William and also Samuel appear quite regularly.\n\nJust a last note is that my Ellen Crone 1812-77?? appears to be part of the wealthy Crones of Doneraile given her sons childrens names and I wondered if these were in your family also childrens names in my direct ancestor William Couche ancestor 1845?-1913 in Victoria Australia i know one William wa s in the Public Serice Stamps office quite high up and others were also involved similiarly think they were related to Castlelyons lot too Anyway hopefully we can compare notes and share our research as It is a bit overwhelming at the moment\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you\n\nJeanne"
