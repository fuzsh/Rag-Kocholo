In a closer sense, “thermal analysis” means a group of methods derived from simple experiments where the temperature of a sample was recorded as a function of time if a constant rate of heat flows into or out of the sample (“heating curve”, “cooling curve”). In contemporary thermal analyzers the sample together with a reference is subjected to a temperature program, and either their temperature difference is measured, or the difference of heat energy flowing in or out of them. Commercial devices are offered by different companies; for special applications, also home-made setups are used occasionally. Often, the measurement of the thermal signals is combined with the continuous measurement of the sample mass or with the analysis of gaseous particles emanating from the sample. Meanwhile, a variety of textbooks about thermal analysis are available on the market, and to some of them we refer in this book. It was not the intention of the author to repeat all things that were already written; rather a practical guide should be given how some typical problems occurring in materials science can be solved by methods of thermal analysis. This comprises not only the experimental part. Whenever reasonable, the holistic interpretation of a thermoanalytic measurement should include an explanation of all experimental observations on a thermodynamic basis, which is nowadays often possible with commercial or freeware software. One possible representation of such “thermodynamic assessment” of a system is a phase diagram (or constitution diagram). At least some basic knowledge about phase diagrams is inevitable; unfortunately, such a knowledge is often sparsely taught at universities, at least outside the mineralogical departments. The book is divided into three sections. “Thermodynamic basis” describes the physical quantities that are most relevant for the interpretation of thermal analysis measurements and gives an introduction to typical phase diagram features like mixed crystals, eutectics, and peritectics. Some crystal structures that are shown there were drawn with the freeware program VESTA by Momma and Izumi (2011). Already here the relation between thermodynamic properties and measurements is shown. The second section “Techniques” describes the methods “Differential Thermal Analysis” (DTA), “Differential Scanning Calorimetry” (DSC), “Thermogravimetry” (TG), and “Evolved Gas Analysis” (EGA), with examples and together with their combinations. The last section “Applications” brings examples (mainly from the author’s own work) for typical practical problems that can be solved by thermal analysis. This is not always the “big science”, because some tasks like the characterization of raw material batches seem perhaps somewhat boring; nevertheless, it is often necessary and well done by thermal analysis. https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110743784-201\n\nVI | Preface Here I want to mention two old (german) textbooks, which gave me a guide into the field of thermal analysis: The book “Differentialthermoanalyse” by Dietrich Schultze (1969),1 who was working in the field of crystal growth of inorganics for decades, can hold as a paragon for this book. It is, however, one half century old, and since that, technical options and numerical methods of analysis were much improved. I am grateful to Dr. Dietrich Schultze that he read major parts of the book manuscript and gave me valuable hints. The booklet “Phasendiagramme” by Peter Paufler (1981)2 is quite mathematical, even if written in a time when computers were room-filling mainframes, but the quantitative presentations found there are the basis of current software packages like FactSage 8.0 (2020), which are available nowadays. I have to acknowledge the work of numerous undergraduate students from Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and other universities, who did practical courses in my laboratory: some of their measurements of phase diagrams are included in this book as examples. Also, I have to thank the students who made internships with me, as well as many Bachelor, Master, and PhD students who worked in the thermoanalytic laboratory. The proofreading and comments by Dr. Nora Wolff and Prof. Dr. Joachim Bohm are highly acknowledged. Last but not least, I want to thank my dear colleagues from Leibniz-Institut für Kristallzüchtung Berlin (Germany) for the great working opportunities that they offered me through almost three decades and for the amiable atmosphere that I always found among them.

In his experiments, the sample was heated with constant electric power W = Uh ⋅ Ih (Uh and Ih are the voltage and current of the heater) and sample temperature T was recorded by a thermocouple (see Section 1.3.1) at constant time increments. It turned out that the measured heating rate Ṫ = d T/ d t was not constant, because endothermal reactions in the sample (e. g., dehydration processes or phase transitions) resulted in temporally smaller T.̇ It will be described in Section 2.1 how such a type of heating (or cooling) experiments was developed further to the modern technique of differential thermal analysis (DTA). The experimental setup of Le Chatelier corresponds to the scheme in Fig. 1.1. If during time t, the amount of heat energy Q=W ⋅t = Uh ⋅ Ih ⋅ t\n\n(1.1)\n\nis transferred to one mole of a sample, then its temperature increases under isochor (volume constant; ΔV = 0) or the more typical isobar (pressure p = const.; often, p = 1 bar = 105 Pa) conditions by ΔQ , cV ΔQ ΔTp = , cp\n\nΔTV =\n\n(1.2) (1.3)\n\nwhere cV and cp are proportionality parameters called the specific heat capacities of the material under the given conditions, V or p = const. Especially for technical purposes, the amount of substance is often given by the mass m = nM, where n is the number of moles, and M is the molar mass.

For 1 mol = 72.63 g pure germanium, the temperature rises almost linearly up to the melting (fusion) temperature Tf = 937 °C and remains constant there until the heat of fusion (or “latent heat”) ΔHf = 36 945 J is brought in. A solid solution (or “mixed crystal”) with composition 0.9Ge + 0.1Si (1 mol = 68.18 g) starts melting at a higher temperature and, in contrast to pure Ge, T remains not constant. Instead, T rises smoothly over an extended temperature range up to ≈ 1050 °C, where melting is finished.\n\n1.1 Specific heat capacity | 3\n\nFigure 1.2: Calculated temperature development of 1 mol pure germanium or of a solid solution (cf. Section 1.5.1.2) of 0.9 mol Ge + 0.1 mol Si upon heating.\n\nHow long takes the melting of 1 mol Ge if a constant heating power of 100 W is used?\n\nPetit and Dulong (1819)2,3 reported that for many solid chemical elements, the specific heat capacity approaches 25 J/(mol K) (1.5) at room temperature (Fig. 1.3). For very low temperature, cp (T) follows a T 3 law (see Fig. 1.8) and vanishes at absolute zero (1.6). Neumann and Kopp4,5 found that cp (T) of a chemical compound Am Bn is nearly the sum of the cp (T) of its composing chemical elements (1.7). lim cp = 3R ≈ 25 J/mol K\n\nT→298 K\n\n(Dulong–Petit),\n\nlim cp = 0,\n\n(1.6)\n\nT→0\n\ncp(Am Bn ) (T) ≈ mcp(A) (T) + ncp(B) (T)\n\n(1.5)\n\n(Neumann–Kopp).\n\n(1.7)\n\nExperimental cp (T) data are the basis from which “chemical potentials” like H, S, and G (cf. Section 1.2) can be derived and are of great importance for this reason.

For other, partially more accurate methods, the reader is referred, e. g., to Höhne et al. (1996), Navrotsky (2014).6 For nearly all chemical elements and for many binary compounds like oxides, sulfides, and halides accurate data are available from printed references, online resources, or other databases, e. g., Barin (1995), NIST (2020), FactSage 8.0 (2020). If for other substances, measurements are not possible, then their cp (T) functions can be estimated with the Neumann–Kopp rule (1.7) from the components. In Fig. 1.4, this is performed for the chalcopyrite-type compound CuInS2 . The black curve shows experimental data obtained by Neumann et al. (1987) from dynamic calorimetry measurements in a Setaram heat flow calorimeter; the authors claim an experimental error of ±1 J/(mol K). The blue curve is the weighed sum of the contributions cpCu (T) + cpIn (T) + 2 ⋅ cpS (T), which for low T is in very good agreement with the experimental data. Difficulties arise at all kinds of phase transitions in one of the phases, here the α/β transition of sulfur and the melting point of indium. Moreover, it is obvious that the slope of the blue curve is significantly too high. This difference can be understood because vibrations of atoms are the most important contribution to cp , which will be discussed in Section 1.1.3.1. However, the nature of the bonds in metals (Cu, In) and molecular crystals (S) is much different from the bonds with covalent and ionic contributions in a crystal like CuInS2 . Thus it is sometimes more appropriate to use fairly similar substances as components for the Neumann–Kopp calculation. The red curve in Fig. 1.4 demonstrates this and is the sum cpCuS (T) + cpInS (T) from FactSage 8.0 (2020) data. This curve always presents slightly smaller values than the black one, but the\n\n6 Alexandra Navrotsky (born 20 June 1943).\n\n1.1 Specific heat capacity | 5\n\nFigure 1.4: cp (T ) data for CuInS2 measured by Neumann et al. (1987) compared to data obtained by adding the FactSage 8.0 (2020) data for the chemical elements or for CuS + InS, according to Neumann–Kopp (1.7).\n\ndifference is not much larger than the experimental error. Besides, the slope is very similar. An even better calculation of cp (T) functions is possible if data for another phase with very high structural similarity are available; an example can be found in Section 3.3.5. For most substances, the function cp (T) rises monotonously with T; the slope is steep at low T and becomes flatter near room temperature. Jumps occur at first-order phase transitions, and λ-shaped maxima are typical for second-order transitions. Figure 1.3 shows this for nickel, where cp has a local maximum at TC = 354 °C. Such singular temperatures are called Curie7 points and are often connected with a transformation of a ferromagnetic (or ferroelectric) phase or structure below TC to a paramagnetic or paraelectric phase above TC . The following phenomena can be observed for different types of phase transitions (see also Section 1.4.2): 1st-order transition: A certain amount of latent heat energy is required to perform the transition from the low-T to the high-T phase. This latent heat is released again during the back transition from high-T to low-T. The transition occurs sharply at a specific Tt , the two phases are in equilibrium there, and cp is discontinuous at Tt . Examples: melting, evaporation, α (orthorhombic) ↔ β (monoclinic) transition of sulfur at 96 °C, α (bcc, body-centered cubic) ↔ γ (fcc, face-centered cubic) transition of iron at 912 °C. 2nd-order transition: No latent heat is required to perform the transition, and the transition is continuous. This means that some order parameter starts to change continuously in the low-T phase and reaches its final (high-T) value at the tran7 Pierre Curie (15 May 1859–19 April 1906).\n\n6 | 1 Thermodynamic basis sition point (often called critical point) Tc . Examples: ferroelectric and ferromagnetic transition, such as Ni in Fig. 1.3, “critical points” where liquids and gases cannot be distinguished. It is sometimes difficult to determine a phase transition to be clearly of 2nd order, because small heats of transition might be overseen. Examples are, e. g., NH4 Cl (ΔH = 3950 J/mol), BaTiO3 (ΔH = 197 J/mol), and SiO2 (α/β quartz, ΔH = 499 J/mol). Glass transition: Glasses are metastable phases where ordering of atoms or molecules appears only between close neighbors and wide range ordering (like in crystals) is not present. Typically, glasses show a glass transition point or range Tg , and in this range, cp rises by a certain amount Δcp . Glasses are more brittle below and more rubber-like above Tg . In DSC heating curves (see Section 2.1 and Fig. 1.5) a larger cp leads to a shift of the curve in the endothermal direction. Different points on the curve may be used to define the glass transition, among them the “fictive temperature” Tf ≈ Tmid . (Tf is defined by the size of areas below the curve, and Tmid is the middle of the transition range.)\n\nFigure 1.5: DSC measurements (top: heating, bottom: cooling) with 10 K/min of 17.62 mg Na–Gd phosphate glass (NaPO3 /Gd(PO3 )3 with 60% Gd phosphate), cf.

In the time average, for harmonic oscillators, we have Upot = Ukin , and it can be shown that Ukin = kB T/2 per degree of freedom (where kB is the Boltzmann8 constant). Consequently, we have the energy contribution U ′ = kB T per degree of freedom. Every atom has 3 degrees of freedom, and in the limit case (where all oscillations are allowed), U = 3NA kB T\n\n(1.8)\n\nis the total molar inner energy of the system (where NA is the Avogadro9 constant). cV corresponds to the amount of energy required to change the temperature of the system (1.2), cV = (\n\n𝜕U J ) = 3NA kB ≈ 25 , 𝜕T V mol K\n\n(1.9)\n\nand gives in this limit case the value of Dulong–Petit (1.5). The energies of the 3N vibration modes allowed in 1 mole of a substance are different, and the number of modes that can be excited becomes smaller for lower T. A detailed analysis (see textbooks for solid-state physics) results in the T 3 dependence of cV (T) mentioned above and in cV (0 K) = 0 (1.6). In the following, we will give only a short introduction into such a treatment for a one-dimensional hypothetical solid. The central positions of atoms inside the crystal lattice are defined by the crystal structure, and at T > 0 the atoms vibrate around these central positions. In a good approximation, atoms can be considered as mass points. Figure 1.6 shows this for the simple case of a one-dimensional chain of mass points with mass m and distance a. The forces between neighboring atoms are symbolized by springs with spring constant α. Under the assumption of undamped free oscillations for the nth atom, the equation of motion is given by mẍn = −α(xn − xn+1 ) − α(xn − xn−1 ) = α(xn−1 + xn+1 − 2xn )\n\n(1.10)\n\nand can be solved by the ansatz xn = A e−i(ωt−nqa)\n\n8 Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann (20 February 1844–5 September 1906). 9 Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro (9 August 1776–9 July 1856).\n\n(1.11)\n\n8 | 1 Thermodynamic basis\n\nFigure 1.6: Left: Linear monoatomic vibration chain.

A graphical presentation of this function is shown in Fig. 1.6. The wavenumber q of a vibration state corresponds to the wavelength λ = 2π/q, and possible values for λ range from λ = 2a (q = π/a) to λ = ∞ (q = 0); the latter is a vibration of the rigid lattice. Near q = 0, ω is proportional to q, and the slope 𝜕ω/𝜕q = v is the speed of sound in the lattice. The number of possible vibration modes is equal to the number of atoms N in the (one-dimensional) chain; in other words, each atom produces exactly one “eigenfrequency” or vibrational mode. A detailed analysis of the three-dimensional case results in 3N vibration modes and finally in equations (1.8) and (1.9). The vibrational energy of these modes is a function of q, and at temperature T, only modes with vibrational energy ≲ kB T can be excited. Consequently, the number of possible vibration modes (or “phonons”) rises with T, and this is also the origin of the cp (T) ≈ cV (T) functions, which are typically found by experiment. It should be noted that the chain in Fig. 1.6 represents the simplest case where only one type of atoms is bound in one direction. In a real crystal, bounds in three directions are formed, and usually more than one sort of atoms are present. Then dispersion relations are more complicated, as compared to Fig. 1.6. The type of modes 10 Leonhard Euler (15 April 1707–18 September 1783).\n\n1.1 Specific heat capacity | 9\n\nshown there with ω(q = 0) = 0 is an “acoustic mode”. If atoms with different masses m, m′ are constructing the crystal, then additionally “optical modes” are formed with ω(q = 0) ≠ 0. 1.1.3 Contributions to cV 1.1.3.1 Lattice vibrations: Debye theory Equation (1.8) gave the inner energy for the limit case that all possible vibration modes (phonons) are excited. More generally, it is given by ∞\n\nU(T) = ∫ g(ω)x(ω, T) d ω,\n\n(1.13)\n\n0\n\nwhere the spectral distribution function g(ω) d ω gives the number of eigenfrequencies between ω and ω + d ω, and x is the vibration amplitude. Debye11 assumed an approximation for g(ω) = {\n\n9Nω2 /ω3D , 0,\n\n0 ≤ ω ≤ ωD , ω > ωD ,\n\n(1.14)\n\nwhich means that only vibration states up to some arbitrary Debye frequency ωD = 2πνD are considered.

It is higher for materials with strong (rigid) bonds and lower if weak (soft) bonds prevail. Some examples (data mainly from the textbook by Kittel, 200412 ) are given in Table 1.2.

By this method Haussühl et al. (2021) obtained ΘD = 676 K for LiAlO2 . 1.1.3.2 Other contributions Not only phonons, but also other particles or quasi-particles inside solids can carry momentum and contribute this way to cV . Conductors, and especially metals, bear a high density of electrons resulting in a specific heat contribution cVe = γT,\n\n(1.16)\n\nwhere γ = π 2 kB2 /2ϵF holds for free electrons (ϵF is the Fermi13 energy). The function cVe is linear in T and relevant especially for low T. Also, magnetic moments and moving atoms or ions can substantially contribute to cV . Examples are AgI, ZrO2 , and CaF2 , where the cations or anions become mobile below the melting temperature and contribute not only to electrical conductivity (“fast ion conductors”), but also to cV (Mehrer, 2007). Why cVe can be relevant especially for low T ?\n\n1.2 Derived thermodynamic potentials 1.2.1 Enthalpy The internal energy U introduced in (1.8) and (1.13) describes the potential and vibrational energy contained in the material itself. In a real system the material has a certain volume V and is exposed to a pressure p. It should be noted that for systems where surface energy can be neglected (phases sufficiently large and phase boundaries with low curvature), p and T are constant over the whole system. The quantity H = U + pV\n\n(1.17)\n\nis called the enthalpy and is the sum of the internal energy with the amount of work (“volume work”) that must be performed to create the phase volume V against the system pressure p. Such as U, H is a thermodynamic potential (= state function) because it depends only on the actual status of the system and not on the way how this status was reached. 13 Enrico Fermi (29 September 1901–28 November 1954).\n\n1.2 Derived thermodynamic potentials | 11\n\nIt is usually difficult, if not impossible, to measure the total amount of Ĥ stored inside a phase, because the energy balance of all contributions to U is often unknown. Contrarily, the enthalpy change of a system from an initial state i to a final state f, ΔH = Hf − Hi ,\n\n(1.18)\n\ncan usually be measured because ΔH = Q (the heat added to the system, provided that p = const. and no other work except volume expansion work is done by the system). To circumvent the problem of absolute H measurements, it is useful to determine “standard conditions” and a set of basic substances where the H values are fixed at these standard conditions. For this purpose, the US National Bureau of Standards defined T0 = 25 °C = 298 K and p0 = 1 × 105 Pa = 1 bar as the “standard ambient temperature and pressure” (see, e. g., Chase et al., 1982). Under these conditions, Hi = H0 = 0 is defined for every chemical element in the phase state that is stable under these conditions (Fig. 1.7). The function H(T) is usually smooth except at first-order phase transitions, where it jumps by an amount called the heat of fusion (ΔHf ), heat of vaporization (ΔHv ), or in general the heat of transition (ΔHt ). Some first-order transitions for ̂ sulfur can be seen in Fig. 1.7. In contrast to this, Fig. 1.8 shows “absolute” H(T) data for metallic Li below room temperature.\n\nFigure 1.7: H(T ) functions for three chemical elements at 1 bar. Sulfur undergoes a monoclinic ↔ orthorhombic phase transition at 95 °C (transition enthalpy ΔHt ), melts at 115 °C (fusion enthalpy ΔHf ), and vaporizes at 469 °C (vaporization enthalpy ΔHV ). Silver and argon show no transitions in this T range.\n\nThe enthalpy of most chemical compounds is strongly negative, because just the release of (binding) energy is the main reason why chemical compounds are formed from the elements. Some examples can be found in Table 1.3. Compounds with H > 0 are not stable and are either entropically stabilized (see Section 1.2.2) or exist only metastable, because their decomposition is hindered by kinetic reasons. The latter case is more typical and is found in Table 1.3 for two chlorine oxides, which are ex-\n\n12 | 1 Thermodynamic basis\n\nFigure 1.8: Measured cp (T ) data for lithium below room temperature (Alcock et al., 1994).

For this substance, Schmidt et al. (2007) observed by DSC an irreversible phase transition, which peaks at 199.4 °C to a high-T phase, which is another indication of the unstable nature of the substance. Most compounds of “noble” metals, like Au2 O3 in Table 1.3, possess very small enthalpies. This is the reason why already a small energetic activation, e. g., by heating, usually decomposes such compounds—in the case of Au2 O3 at 150…160 °C. Silver forms compounds that are slightly more stable but are so sensitive that silver halides can be partially decomposed by the energy of light. This was invented by Schulze (1719)14 and gave the basis for the first (still fleeting) photograms. Silver(I) oxide Ag2 O is stable only at low T < 200 °C under oxidizing conditions (Fig. C.31). 14 Johann Heinrich Schulze (12 May 1687–10 October 1744).\n\n1.2 Derived thermodynamic potentials | 13\n\nThe enthalpy of substances for other temperatures, different from the standard value for T0 = 25 °C, can be calculated by T\n\nH(T) = H0 + ∫ cp (T) d T\n\n(1.19)\n\nT0\n\n̂ K) = 0, then (1.19) represents the from experimental cp (T) data. If we start with H(0 area under the cp (T) curve in Fig. 1.8. cp (T) rises with T 3 only for low T ≲ 50 K and approaches quickly the Dulong–Petit value 25 J/(mol K) (1.5) and then slowly changes; consequently, for many substances, H(T) is an almost linear function at high T. Enthalpy H, entropy S (see Section 1.2.2), and Gibbs15 free energy G (see Section 1.2.3) are thermodynamic potentials (state functions). According to Hess’16 law, the value of such a potential does not depend on the path of the reaction, like depicted in Fig. 1.9. With Hess’ law the dependence of reaction enthalpies on T can be calculated, and also transformation enthalpies under nonequilibrium conditions.\n\nFigure 1.9: Hess’ law: Δr H1 =Δr H2 +Δr H2 .\n\nHess’ law is the basis for the Born17 –Haber18 cycle and can be used to calculate lattice energies of compounds, which otherwise are not available. This lattice energy corresponds to the inner energy U in equations (1.8) and (1.19). Figure 1.10 demonstrates this for magnesium oxide: If the formation enthalpy ΔHf = −602 kJ/mol is known, e. g., from calorimetric measurements, U lattice can be calculated from this circle. Data for the four energies or enthalpies from the left side (blue labels) can be found elsewhere in the literature, and from these values we obtain U lattice = −3882 kJ/mol. 15 Josiah Willard Gibbs (11 February 1839–28 April 1903). 16 Germain Henri Hess (7 August 1802–30 November 1850). 17 Max Born (11 December 1882–5 January 1970). 18 Fritz Haber (9 December 1868–29 January 1934).\n\n14 | 1 Thermodynamic basis\n\nFigure 1.10: Born–Haber cycle for MgO: ΔHf = ΔHsub +E ion +ΔHdiss +E aff +U lattice .

The statistical interpretation is related to the Shannon19 entropy used in information theory and corresponds to the average information density in a system of symbols (or atoms). In the statistical interpretation the entropy S is a measure of “uncertainty” of a given state; in other words, it is a measure of the number of equivalent arrangements of parts (e. g., atoms) setting up the system. This is shown in Fig. 1.11 (a) for the case of a planar lattice where all possible sites are occupied by atoms. Another equivalent possibility for the atoms does not exist, and the probability for the shown state is P = 1. Not so in Fig. 1.11 (b), where two atoms are missing: 48 options exist for selecting the first missing atom, and 47 options remain for the second missing atom, but it is indistinguishable which atom was missing first. This means that 48×47/2 = 1128 equivalent microstates exist, which result in the same macrostate “plane lattice” with 48 sites. If Pi is the probability of the ith microstate, then S = −kB ∑ Pi ln Pi i\n\nis the entropy of the corresponding macrostate.\n\n19 Claude Elwood Shannon (30 April 1916–24 February 2001).\n\n(1.20)\n\n1.2 Derived thermodynamic potentials | 15\n\nFigure 1.11: Statistical interpretation of entropy: (a) 1 possible option to distribute 6 × 8 = 48 = n atoms on n lattice sites. (b) shows one of 48 × 47/2 = 1128 equivalent options to arrange f = 2 faults (e. g., unoccupied sites or vacancies) on 48 lattice sites.\n\nFor the arrangement from Fig. 1.11, this is demonstrated in Fig. 1.12. The system has N atom sites that are either “faulty” (f sites) or occupied (N − f sites). The number of possible arrangements of faulty sites (= number of microstates) is 1 N! =Ω= P (N − f )!f !\n\n(1.21)\n\nand grows drastically with f to a maximum value, which is obtained for f = N/2. The result of (1.21) for N = 48 is shown by the bar plot in Fig. 1.12.\n\nFigure 1.12: Derivation of entropy S for the ensemble shown in Fig. 1.11 with different numbers of missing atoms. The number Ω of equivalent microstates is maximum if 50% of the sites are faulty.\n\n16 | 1 Thermodynamic basis In closed systems in equilibrium, P is often identical for all microstates, and (1.20) simplifies to S = kB ln Ω,\n\n(1.22)\n\nwhere S(f ) is shown by the line plot in Fig. 1.12. In a real system with f > 0 and at T > 0, all faulty sites are initially ordered (Ω(t = 0) = 1); this ordering drops with time t. It will be shown in Section 1.2.3 that increase of S is the driving force for increasing the “uncertainty” of the system. The thermodynamic interpretation of S does not depend on the atomistic nature of matter but can be related to it. Figure 1.13 (a) shows an ideal lattice, where the atoms are connected by chemical bonds. We can assume that this solid is formed because the creation of every bond reduces the internal energy of the material (compared to sole atoms) by a certain amount E. In Fig. 1.13 (b), some vacancies are introduced, which increase the disorder, or the “uncertainty”, of the system and increase its entropy S. If for this purpose, n bonds had to be broken, then the energy Q = n ⋅ E was used. Assuming that this process is performed under equilibrium conditions, it is reversible, and the relation ΔS =\n\nQrev T\n\n(1.23)\n\ndescribes the entropy change of the system.\n\nFigure 1.13: Thermodynamic interpretation of entropy: (a) all atoms occupy lattice sites and form ideal bonds. (b) faults (here vacancies) are introduced, and some “dangling bonds” are created. For this process, a certain amount of energy Q was used.\n\nIn analogy to equation (1.17) the entropy can be derived from the specific heat capacity by T\n\nS(T) = S0 + ∫ T0\n\nand we have S0 (0 K) = 0.\n\ncp (T) T\n\nd T,\n\n(1.24)\n\n1.2 Derived thermodynamic potentials | 17\n\n1.2.3 Gibbs-free energy 1.2.3.1 Pure substances The enthalpy H introduced in Section 1.2.1 is a measure of the amount of energy added (or extracted) from a system. However, this process is usually not reversible: Even if lattice vibrations are considered undamped (contribution U in equation (1.17)) and if the volume work can be restored (contribution p ⋅ V in equation (1.17)), the entropy S of the system increases upon heating. Once the disorder of a system becomes larger, this is in general an irreversible process. It is useful to define the “free energy” (or Gibbs energy) G = H − TS = U + pV − TS,\n\n(1.25)\n\nwhich is the amount of energy that can be reversibly added or extracted from the system. As H and S, G is a thermodynamic potential. This means that for a given state (xi , T, p) of a system, G does not depend on the way this state was reached. In his seminal paper on heterogeneous equilibria, Gibbs (1874–1878) derived this thermodynamic potential by combining the principles of maximum entropy: “For a closed system with fixed internal energy, the entropy is maximized at equillibrium” and of minimum energy “For a closed system with fixed entropy, the total energy is minimized at equillibrium”.\n\nFor elevated T (room temperature or beyond), H changes only weakly (see, e. g., Fig. 1.7), and the same holds for S. From (1.25) it is obvious that G(T) is a function that drops nearly linearly for most phases and systems. Figure 1.14 demonstrates this for the three aggregation states of sodium chloride. The solid phase develops the strongest binding forces between atoms, this way reducing H and resulting in the most negative Gsol [0 ∘ C] = −430.877 kJ/mol. The energy gain by bonding is less significant in the liquid (Gliq [0 ∘ C] = −415.818 kJ/mol) or even smaller in the gas with much weaker attractive forces between atoms (Ggas [0 ∘ C] = −244.230 kJ/mol). On the other hand, the degree of disorder and, consequently, the slope −S of the G functions become larger in this order. The result is that solid, liquid, and gas phases have the lowest G and become stable one after the other with larger T. For all solid curves in Fig. 1.14, we assumed that p = 1 bar. The influence of p on S and H is usually small for condensed phases (solids, liquids). In contrast, gases show high compressibility, which leads to a high dependency of atomic interactions on pressure. For lower p, Ggas (T) shifts to bottom left, leading to an intersection with Gliq (T) at lower T, which means that Tboil drops with p. If for sufficiently small p, the intersection is below Tf , then the liquid phase is never stable, and the substance undergoes sublimation, which is a first-order phase transition from the solid to the gas, and vice versa. This is shown by the dashed curve in Fig. 1.14.\n\n18 | 1 Thermodynamic basis\n\nFigure 1.14: G as a function of T for the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of sodium chloride (NaCl); G(T ) for the gas is drawn for two pressures p = 1 bar and p = 10−6 bar. Tf – fusion point, Tboil – boiling point, Tsubl – sublimation point.\n\n1.2.3.2 Mixture phases The Gibbs energy of a mixed phase Φ can be expressed as the sum GΦ = G0 + Gid + Gex ,\n\n(1.26)\n\nwhere G0 is the scaled contribution of the pure components. In systems with two components A and B, this is the straight line G0 = xGB + (1 − x)GA\n\n(1.27)\n\nconnecting the values for the pure components, where x is the molar fraction of component B (see Fig. 2.45). If A and B can be mixed in one phase (e. g., in a solid or liquid solution), then the disorder of this phase grows, and this enhances its entropy S. This is basically a statistic effect, which is independent of the chemical nature of the corresponding atoms. Nevertheless, increasing S results with (1.25) in a reduction of G for T > 0 and hence in a stabilization of the phase. This stabilizing Gibbs energy contribution Gid to GΦ (1.26) appears without energetic interaction of the species (ΔH id = 0, hence obeying Raoult’s20 law), C\n\nGid = −RT ∑ xi ln xi i\n\n(C components)\n\n= −RT[x ln x + (1 − x) ln(1 − x)] (2 components), 20 François Marie Raoult (10 May 1830–1 April 1901).\n\n(1.28) (1.29)\n\n1.3 Thermoelectricity, thermocouples | 19\n\nand lowers the Gibbs energy of the phase for intermediate compositions; the effect is maximal if the concentrations of all components are equal (x = 0.5 for systems with two components). Also, for mixture phases with high number of components (C ≳ 5), the maximum Gid is reached for identical concentrations for all components, and unexpected metallic or compound mixture phases, called “high-entropy alloys”, were reported (HEAs; see Section 1.5.3.5). Simplify equation (1.28) for the case of C components with identical composition. How large is the impact on GΦ for C = 6 at T = 1000 K?\n\nThe contribution Gex summarizes deviations from the ideal behavior, which result, e. g., from attraction or repulsion or from complicated shapes of the interacting species. In cases where the components are very similar and for very high temperature, Gex can sometimes be neglected, and the phase behaves ideal. If a mixed liquid phase and a mixed solid phase are in equilibrium, then a “mixed crystal” system is formed, which will be described in Section 1.5.1.2.\n\n1.3 Thermoelectricity, thermocouples 1.3.1 Phenomenological description The transport of heat and electrons in solids is coupled, and these coupling effects are called thermoelectric effects, among them, Seebeck21 and Peltier22 effects. Both effects are reciprocal. Compared to these effects, Thomson23 and Bridgman24 effects are usually small. The Seebeck effect gives a physical basis for thermocouples. Seebeck: Two different metals A and B (or other conductors) are electrically connected in a way schematically shown in Fig. 1.15, and the connections are held at different temperatures. Then a thermovoltage ΔU AB = ΣAB ΔT appears between both connections. A detailed treatment shows that Σ is a second-rank tensor. However, the tensor description is necessary only for most anisotropic materials like crystals (cf. the two different values for Sb crystals in Table 1.5) and textures, but not for isotrope polycrystals like thermocouple wires (Nye, 1957).25 Peltier: In a setup similar to Fig. 1.15 an electric current is created by applying a voltage between poles (1) and (3). Then, in addition to the Joule26 heating RI 2 (where R 21 Thomas Johann Seebeck (29 March 1770–10 December 1831). 22 Jean Charles Athanase Peltier (22 February 1785–27 October 1845). 23 William Thomson, 1.

The Peltier and Seebeck coefficients are related by ΠAB = TΣAB , which implies that Π is also a second-rank tensor. Thomson: Additional heating and cooling ±τA I𝜕T/𝜕x also appears if the system of different wires in Fig. 1.15 is replaced by one single wire A and, at the same time, a temperature gradient is opposed to it. The Thomson effect describes the temperature dependence of the Seebeck effect, which can be expressed as 𝜕ΣAB /𝜕T = −τA (T)/T + τB (T)/T. Bridgman: Additional heating and cooling appears in one material if the current density inside the wire changes with x. This may result from nonconstant crosssection, but also due to variable crystallographic orientation inside the wire. If the measurement of ΔU AB in Fig. 1.15 is performed without current flow, e. g., by compensation, then it depends only on the temperature difference ΔT, and ΣAB is a materials parameter of the combination A–B. If, moreover, one of the welding points is placed in a thermostat (e. g., T1 = const. = 0 °C in ice/water), then the thermovoltage depends only on the temperature of the other welding point and can be used to measure T2 . This is technically used by thermocouples (Table 1.4), which are available for a wide range of temperatures and chemical environments. For very low temperatures, however, thermocouples cannot be used as ΣAB → 0 for T → 0. Thermocouples are based on the Seebeck effect and represent an important device for temperature measurements in thermal analysis.\n\n1.3 Thermoelectricity, thermocouples | 21 Table 1.4: Thermovoltage (in mV, DIN EN 60584-1) of several common thermocouples, positive pole first.

Consequently, thermocouples must be handled with care, and strong bending of the wires must be avoided. For thermocouples made of platinum (type S or B), oxidizing conditions are optimal. If heated for long time under strongly reducing conditions, alloying with C, S, As, or volatile metals (Ga, Bi) may occur (“platinum poisons”). This can affect the measured ΔU AB and finally destroy the thermowire. The Peltier effect is used mainly for refrigerators without moving parts for application in households, laboratory, and industry. “Camping coolers” that can be run by the 12 V DC power supply of cars, cooling stages for microscopes, and coolers for SDDs (silicon drift detectors) in EDX are examples. As the Peltier and Seebeck effects are reciprocal, the same materials show high efficiency. It should be noted, however, that the Seebeck effect is mainly used with thermocouples for measuring T, where the total height of the signal is not so important, and mainly long-term stability is required. In contrast, for Peltier coolers, high efficiency is inevitable to overcome the Joule heating (which is always present) by the thermoelectric cooling effect. Some data can be found in Table 1.5.\n\n22 | 1 Thermodynamic basis Table 1.5: Absolute Seebeck coefficients for several materials near room temperature, mainly after Paufler (1986).

The latter restriction is necessary because atoms of different chemical elements are of course different; nevertheless, chemical compounds can form phases. In every system where gases exist (including thermal analyzers), these gases form usually one phase only, because under not too extreme conditions (see, e. g., Senesi et al., 1997), all gases intermix in arbitrary ratio. This is not always so for the liquid aggregation state of different substances. Substances of similar chemical nature can often (but not always) be mixed in their liquid (molten) states: – Many molten metals form one liquid metallic phase, but, e. g., liquid Pb shows with many other liquid metals a “miscibility gap” with two separate liquid phases (Teppo et al., 1991). – Water mixes in arbitrary ratio with lighter alcohols like CH3 OH (methanol) and C2 H5 OH (ethanol), but from 1-butanol upwards the mutual miscibility is increasingly limited at room temperature (Barton, 1984). – Ionic compounds are often miscible in the liquid state if their anions are identical or similar. 27 Enrico Fermi (29 September 1901–28 November 1954).\n\n1.4 Phases | 23\n\nIf the liquid aggregation states of compounds cannot be mixed, then they form two or even more liquid phases, e. g., water and oil. The miscibility of different solid substances depends on even more conditions. Besides a sufficient degree of chemical similarity (like given above), some crystallographic aspects are important, which will be described in the next subsection.\n\n1.4.1 Some crystallography A vast majority of solids appears in crystalline state. Crystals are not necessarily large (and often beautiful) specimen that can be found in mineralogical collections worldwide or as gemstones, in technical devices like computers, lasers, light emitting diodes (LEDs), or some sensors. Nearly every stone, every nail in the hardware store, and even parts of our human bodies are crystalline at least on a microscopic scale. Besides crystals, two other types of solids exist: Glasses are solids that exist metastably in nonequilibrium. This leads to some specific features like glass transitions, where thermal analysis curves show characteristic effects, like those shown in Fig. 1.5. Glasses have no sharp melting point; instead, they become softer upon heating beyond the glass transition until they finally form a melt, usually, with high viscosity. From the structural point of view, glasses are short-range ordered over a range of a few interatomic distances but are disordered over longer distances. Quasicrystals were discovered by Shechtman et al. (1984)28 and represent ordered solids on short and long distances. It should be mentioned, however, that the existence of structures possessing as well short-range as long-range order, but no translational symmetry in three dimensions (what accurately meets the definition of quasicrystals, too), was very detailed dealt with already more than 20 years earlier by Dornberger-Schiff (1964),29 who named them OD-structures (orderdisorder-structures), and by Bohm (1967, 1968),30 who named them metacrystals. The thermodynamic behavior of these still somewhat exotic materials is very similar to “normal” crystals (see below); but from the structural point of view, they are significantly different, because quasicrystals have no translation symmetry. This means that the atomic arrangement of quasicrystals cannot be built up by stacking smaller structural units (“unit cells”) periodically in three dimensions like shown for a crystal in Fig. 1.16. This is an exclusive property of crystals.\n\n28 Daniel “Dan” Shechtman (born 24 January 1941). 29 Katharina Boll-Dornberger, or Käthe Dornberger-Schiff (2 November 1909–27 July 1981). 30 Joachim Bohm (born 25 March 1935).\n\n24 | 1 Thermodynamic basis\n\nFigure 1.16: 2 × 2 × 1 stacking of orthorhombic unit cells. The dimensions along the x, y, z axes in the orthorhombic system (Table 1.6) are the lattice parameters a ≠ b ≠ c. In the orthorhombic system the angles between axes are ∡(b, c) = α = ∡(c, a) = β = ∡(a, b) = γ = 90∘ .\n\nIt is beyond the scope of this book to give here an extensive introduction into the science of crystallography. For this, the reader is referred to other print or web resources, e. g., Kleber et al. (2021),31 Borchardt-Ott (2012),32 Julian (2015), IUCr (2020). However, it is important to know that crystals are stackings of identical unit cells in all three dimensions of space. Figure 1.16 shows this schematically for a stacking in two dimensions; stacking in the third was not drawn for better recognizability. Every unit cell (e. g., the gray cell in the origin of the coordinate system in Fig. 1.16) contains a set of atoms at specific coordinates inside the cell. These atoms must occur in the stoichiometric ratio of the substance, because all cells are identical: a copper unit cell contains only Cu atoms, a sodium chloride unit cell contains Na+ and Cl− as 1 : 1, and a cane sugar unit cell contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in the ratio 12 : 22 : 11, because the chemical sum formula is C12 H22 O11 . The atomic positions inside the cell, together with the geometrical dimensions of the unit cell a, b, c, α, β, γ, describe the crystal structure of the substance. Crystal structures are often determined by diffraction of X-ray radiation. The most general shape of a unit cell is the parallelepiped. Such volume is limited by three pairs of identical parallelograms with arbitrary sides a, b; b, c; and c, a. 3𝔻 stacking of parallelepipeds gives a triclinic lattice, which can be described by triclinic coordinates. A triclinic lattice has either no symmetry elements, except the identity 1, or it has besides 1 the inversion center 1̄ (spoken “bar one”), which combines an atom A at coordinates xA , yA , zA with an identical atom at coordinates −xA , −yA , −zA . The translations are symmetry elements of every lattice too. More options do not exist, and these sets of possible combinations of symmetry elements are called a space group. Hence we can conclude that only two space groups (P1 and P 1)̄ are compatible\n\n31 Wilhelm “Will” Kleber (15 December 1906–27 August 1970). 32 Walter Borchardt-Ott (16 November 1933–19 January 2012).\n\n1.4 Phases | 25\n\nwith a triclinic lattice. The letter P stands for a “primitive” lattice, because it has lattice points only at the corners of the unit cells, like the orthorhombic lattice in Fig. 1.16. Besides P, in general, the following lattices exist: F (face centered = one additional lattice point on every face center); I (german innenzentriert = body centered = one additional lattice point in the center of the unit cell); C, A (lattice points on the faces where z or x points out; R (rhombohedral lattice, see caption of Table 1.6).

(2016),33 consists in its first position of an italic letter (P, I, F , A, C, R) describing the lattice type. Then for up to three symmetrically independent directions (so-called viewing directions), symmetry elements are given: 6, 4, 3, 2, 1 for rotation axes, where 1 is the identity; 6,̄ 4,̄ 3,̄ 2̄ ≡ m, 1̄ are combinations of a rotation with an inversion (rotoinversion), where m is a mirror plane, and 1̄ is the inversion center. Symbols like 32 stand for screw axes, and letters like c, b, a, d, n for glide planes. Space 2 group symbols like P m ≡ P2/m mean a 2-fold axis 2 standing orthogonal on a mirror plane m.\n\nSubstances with triclinic crystal lattices are found seldom in nature, and lattices with higher symmetry are more common. Organic solids often have monoclinic or orthorhombic lattices. Very simple inorganics (many metals, simple oxides, or halides) are often cubic. However, this is only a general trend: for example, Zn is hexagonal, Sn is tetragonal, and Ga is orthorhombic. With the number of symmetry elements, also the number of possible combinations of these symmetry elements, and hence the number of space groups, grows significantly. In total, 230 space groups where shown to exist, and each of them is compatible with one of seven lattices given in Table 1.6. In the beginning of this section, some preconditions for the miscibility of liquids were given, and it was mentioned that the requirements for solids are even harder:\n\n33 Theo Hahn (3 January 1928–12 February 2016).\n\n26 | 1 Thermodynamic basis\n\nIt is a necessary but not sufficient condition for complete miscibility of different crystalline solids that they have identical crystal structure, which implies that they belong to the same space group. Another requirement is that their lattice parameters may not be too different, which typically means that the lattice constants should not differ by more than ≈ 10 . . . 15 %.\n\nA small selection of the thousands known crystal structures is shown in Figs. 1.17 and 1.18, and in the caption, for each structure, the space group and the required lattice parameters are given. All structures from Fig. 1.17 are cubic, and from Table 1.6 we see that only one lattice parameter (the edge length a of the unit cell) is independent. The tungsten structure in Fig. 1.17 (a), already solved by Davey (1925),34 is identical with the body centered cubic (bcc) lattice, but copper in Fig. 1.17 (b), taken from the famous collection by Wyckoff (1963),35 corresponds to the face centered cubic (f. c. c.) lattice. This difference of crystal structures does not allow the formation of an unlimited series of mixed crystals between them, and hence in the solid state, W and Cu will form separate phases if they coexist in a system. (It should be mentioned, however, that a minor “rim” mutual solubility is not forbidden, see Section 1.5.1.2).\n\n̄ a = 3.158 Å), (b) Cu (WyckFigure 1.17: Four simple cubic crystal structures.

In this structure, every cation is octahedrally coordinated to six anions, and vice versa. (The coordination polyhedra are not shown in Fig. 1.17.) CsCl is an exception and crystallizes in a crystal structure shown in Fig. 1.17 (d) and received its name from this substance. Here the coordination polyhedron is a cube (also not shown). Figure 1.18 shows two different structures of the compound CaCO3 . Both modifications can be found as minerals in nature, but only the calcite structure is thermodynamically stable under ambient conditions. The aragonite modification has a higher 34 Wheeler Pedlar Davey (19 March 1886–12 October 1959). 35 Ralph Walter Graystone Wyckoff (9 August 1897–3 November 1994). 36 Sidney Cyril Abrahams (28 May 1924–9 February 2021).\n\n1.4 Phases | 27\n\nFigure 1.18: Crystal structures of two modifications of CaCO3 in polyeder projection (Ca2+ blue, C4+ brown, O2− red, Ca2+ is octahedrally coordinated by six O2− , C4− is planar coordinated by three O2− ̄ to CO2− 3 anions.

In contrast to Fig. 1.17, the structures in Fig. 1.18 where drawn with coordination polyhedra to make their structural similarity more obvious. However, calcite 2+ contains planar CO2− in octahedral (6-fold) coordina3 (carbonate) anions, and Ca 2+ tion, whereas the Ca coordination is 9-fold in aragonite. 1.4.2 Phase transitions 1.4.2.1 Structural aspects A phase transition is often associated with a significant change of the atomistic structure of matter, where usually its symmetry also changes. We have to compare and discuss the crystal structures of the phases involved, which is performed in the framework of crystallography and their terminology. Here we give only a very brief overview; for details, the reader is referred to the textbooks on crystallography mentioned in Section 1.4.1. The symmetry of a crystal can be described by its space group. 230 space groups in three dimensions are described in the “International Tables for Crystallography” (Hahn et al., 2016). Each of these groups can be attributed to one of the seven 37 Hans Lemmich Juel Bäckström (18 December 1896–1 August 1977).\n\n28 | 1 Thermodynamic basis coordinate systems given in Table 1.6. For the subject of this book, transitions between solid phases are often relevant, e. g., between the aragonite and calcite structures of CaCO3 (Fig. 1.18). Also, melting, the transition between a solid (crystalline) phase and a liquid, is a phase transition. However, also a liquid can undergo a phase transition to another liquid phase, e. g., the nematic/smectic transition of liquid crystals (Lavrentovich and Terent’ev, 1986). Crystals may contain different types of symmetry elements, among them, 6-, 4-, 3-, and 2-fold rotation axes, which generate rotations with angles of 60∘ , 90∘ , 120∘ , or 180∘ , respectively, and their multiples. Besides, rotoinversion axes, screw axes, and glide planes are possible in crystals. In quasicrystals, however, also “noncrystallographic” axes can occur, which generate, e. g., 5- or 10-fold symmetry. In liquids and in ceramic and metallic textures, ∞-fold rotation axes are also observed, which means that rotations by infinitesimally small angles are possible.\n\nA change of the crystal structure can mean that atoms or ions have to move by diffusional steps over significant distances. Cesium chloride is an example: this substance undergoes at Tt = 470 °C a transition from the CsCl crystal structure (space ̄ to the NaCl structure (space group Fm3m), ̄ group Pm3m) which is stable at T > Tt (see Fig. 1.17). During this large structural change, even the coordination of the ions is changed, which means almost a reconstruction of the crystal structure, and this transformation is called a reconstructive phase transition, following the classification of Buerger (1951).38 Reconstructive transitions are accompanied by a change of enthalpy; for the CsCl transition, this is ΔHt = 3765.6 J/mol. The substance SiO2 can appear in a wide variety of modifications, and Fig. 1.19 shows two of them: α-quartz is stable at ambient conditions and is the most abundant modification in nature. Already below Tt = 573 °C = 846 K the [SiO4 ] tetrahedra start to turn and stretch slightly, and this process is finished at Tt . The atomic coordinates in the resulting β-quartz modification Fig. 1.19 (b) are only slightly different from those of the α (“low quartz”) modification shown in the left drawing. It is called a displacive transition, because the transition proceeds by slight displacements of atoms without breaking bonds between them. Christy (1993) points out that the distinction between displacive and reconstructive phase transitions is somewhat subjective and proposes a classification according the symmetry relationships between the modification; then for a “type I” transition, the space group of one modification should be a subgroup of the space group of the other modification. For the α − β transition of quartz, this is the case, because the low-T space group P32 21 is a subgroup of P62 22. For the CaCO3 modifications aragonite and calcite shown in Fig. 1.18, structural relationships are not as obvious as for quartz. In both modifications, planar CO2− 3 complex ions are connected via Ca2+ ions; however, the aragonite structure is denser packed (the density of calcite is 2.711 g/cm3 , aragonite 2.930 g/cm3 ), and every Ca2+ is 38 Martin Julian Buerger (8 April 1903–26 February 1986).\n\n1.4 Phases | 29\n\nFigure 1.19: Crystal structures of two modifications of SiO2 in polyeder projection (data from Kihara, 1990, Si4+ blue, O2− red, (a) α-quartz at T = 298 K (P32 21, a = 4.9137 Å, c = 5.4047 Å). (b) β-quartz at T = 848 K (P62 22, a = 4.9965 Å, c = 5.4570 Å.)\n\ncoordinated to 9 O2− for aragonite, rather than to 6 O2− for calcite (Reuß, 2003). However, again small rotations and deformations of the coordination polyhedra can convert one modification into the other. In contrast to quartz, the symmetry is significantly ̄ and orthorhombic changed here between rhombohedral (trigonal, space group R3c) (space group Pmcn). If a solid substance undergoes a phase transition and changes its crystal structure to a new modification, then it becomes a new phase. In equilibrium, sometimes two (or at a triple point, even three) modifications may coexist; then each modification forms a separate phase.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, the modification that is stable at higher T has often a higher symmetry. If the subsequent modifications are named by greek letters, then one often starts with α for the modification that is stable immediately below the melting point, and with lower T, β, γ, . . . are following. However, exceptions occur, and, e. g., α-quartz is more stable at lower T than β-quartz. 1.4.2.2 Thermodynamic aspects An alternative classification of phase transitions was introduced by Ehrenfest39 (Jaeger, 1998) and relies on the behavior of derivatives of thermodynamic potentials. In the Ehrenfest classification, a phase transition of order n shows a discontinuity in the nth derivative of a thermodynamic potential. This means that for a first-order transition, from equation (1.25) we obtain (𝜕G/𝜕p)T = V and (𝜕G/𝜕T )p = −S, and hence V and S undergo abrupt changes at a first-order transition (also, H = 𝜕(G/T )/𝜕(1/T ) is discontinuous). For a second-order transition, the first derivatives of G change continuously, but the second change abrupt, e. g., (d H/ d T )p = cp , see equation (1.19). Transitions of third or higher order are rarely reported, and experimental evidence is tenuous (Kumar, 2003; Janke et al., 2006).\n\n39 Paul Ehrenfest (18 January 1880–25 September 1933).\n\n30 | 1 Thermodynamic basis For thermal analysis, the most significant difference between first- and second-order transitions is that a heat of transition Q = ΔH appears only for the former. In Fig. 1.7, all three steps in the H(T) curve of sulfur result from first-order transitions, and also the transitions of selected substances used for the calibration of thermal analyzers (see Table 2.2) are without exception of first order, because only a significantly large latent heat (transformation, often melting) leads to a sufficiently large DTA or DSC peak. Landau (1936)40 introduced a thermodynamic approach for second-order transitions, where an order parameter Q results in the excess Gibbs energy term 1 1 1 G = H − TS = A(T − Tc )Q2 + BQ4 + Q6 2 4 6\n\n(1.31)\n\n(A, Tc , B, C are constants), which describes the behavior of measurable physical quantities M such as specific heat capacity, polarization, or atomic positions near secondorder phase transitions by expressions of the type M ∝ |Tc − T|−α ,\n\n(1.32)\n\nwhere Tc is the transition (sometimes called “critical” or Curie41 ) temperature, and α ≈ 21 is the “critical exponent”. Second-order transitions proceed by different mechanisms: Small movements of atoms and turns of coordination polyhedra are one option (“displacement type”), but some compounds like the 1 : 1 CuZn alloy (β/β′ brass) show “order–disorder” transitions between a body-centered disordered cubic struc̄ at high T) and a CsCl-type ordered Pm3m ̄ structure at low T. ture (space group Im3m In both structures the atoms sit on identical sites in the crystal lattice, but the distribution of Cu and Zn over these sites is different (Yeomans, 1992). The cp anomaly of nickel in Fig. 1.3 results from a ferromagnetic/paramagnetic second-order transition of this metal, which was also observed by DSC measurements (Lopeandía et al., 2008) and neutron diffraction (Drabkin et al., 1969). The transitions between a ferroelectric phase (at low T) and a paraelectric phase (with higher symmetry, at high T) are usually of the second order; an example with high technical relevance is lithium niobate Li1−x NbO3 , which crystallizes from the melt in the paraelectric R3c̄ phase and transforms below the Curie temperature TC ≈ 1020 °C to a ferroelectric R3c phase (TC depends on x, Carruthers et al., 1971). Dohnke et al. (2004) observed this transition by weak DSC effects. For a comprehensive introduction to the Landau theory, the reader is referred, e. g., to Salje (1990).42 From the structural point of view, first-order transitions are often reconstructive and proceed at one specific transition temperature Tt . At Tt , low-T and high-T phases coexist in equilibrium, but immediately below or above Tt , one of the coexisting 40 Lev Davidovich Landau (9 January 1908–1 April 1968). 41 Pierre Curie (15 May 1859–19 April 1906). 42 Ekhard Salje (born 26 October 1946).\n\n1.5 Phase diagrams |\n\n31\n\nphases disappears. The melting of ice to water at Tf = 0 °C is a good example. H(T) jumps at Tt from a value for the low-T phase to a different value for the high-T phase discontinuously, and hence transitions of first order are often called “discontinuous transitions”. However, it should be taken into account that this is strictly true only for pure substances (one component). Some phases like mixed crystals, which will be discussed in Section 1.5.1.2, show melting over a finite T range. Also, this melting needs a certain heat of fusion ΔH and is therefore clearly of first order, but the term “discontinuous transition” could be misinterpreted, because the melting process is not restricted to a fixed value Tf . Second-order transitions are from the structural point of view often displacive. They are smeared over a transition range of typically several 10 K or even more, and they are (at least in theory) not accompanied by a latent heat of transformation. It was already mentioned at the end of Section 1.1.1 that the discrimination if a transition is in fact of second order or “weakly” first order is often not straightforward. Not only the enthalpy increment necessary to perform a first-order transition, but also the cp (T) maximum (λ; see the Ni curve in Fig. 1.3) connected with a second-order transition results in an increased demand of energy during heating cycles in DTA or DSC measurements. As described in Sections 2.1 and 2.3, this can be interpreted as “weakly” first-order transitions. In the FactSage 8.0 (2020) databases, we find, e. g., ΔHt = 498.9 J/mol for the displacive transitions α-quartz → β-quartz (Fig. 1.19) and ΔHt = 183.3 J/mol for the displacive transition aragonite → calcite (Fig. 1.18), which are very low compared to a reconstructive transition between solid phases (CsCl, Figs. 1.17 (c) and (d), ΔHt = 3.7656 kJ/mol) or melting (for CsCl, ΔHf = 15.8992 kJ/mol). At the melting point of NaCl (Tf = 800.65 °C = 1073.8 K, Fig. 1.14), the entropy of the solid phase liq sol is SNaCl = 143.655 J/(mol K), and the entropy of the liquid phase has the higher value SNaCl = 169.878 J/(mol K). How large is the heat of fusion (melting enthalpy ΔHf )? Hint: Use equation (1.25).\n\n1.5 Phase diagrams In this chapter, we present the most prevailing types (topologies, geometries) of x − T phase diagrams, where x stands for the concentration, and T stands for the temperature. Other possible coordinates for phase diagrams (pressure p, magnetic or electric fields H,⃗ E,⃗ …) are not so relevant here because the variation of T for different sample compositions x is a basic principle of thermal analysis. Whenever possible, concentrations should be given as molar fractions x of the components. Moreover, it is sometimes useful to choose components in such a way that their chemical formula units contain a similar number of atoms or ions. For instance, instead of SrO–Ga2 O3 (2–5 atoms), we can choose SrO– 21 Ga2 O3 (2–2.5 atoms) as components. The reason is that the slope of phase boundaries is substantially determined by the number of microstates of the system and hence by its entropy (see Section 1.2.2), and this scales with the number of interacting species.\n\n32 | 1 Thermodynamic basis 1.5.1 Binary phase diagrams without intermediate compound 1.5.1.1 Lever rule Why three phases cannot coexist in a phase field (area) of an isobar binary phase diagram?.\n\nBinary phase diagrams in concentration–temperature (x − T) coordinates contain phase fields (areas) with one or two coexisting phases. In Fig. 1.20 the gray fields contain only the phase Φ1 or Φ2 . Within both fields, every point designates specific thermodynamic conditions (a concentration of the corresponding phase x and its temperature T) where this phase is stable.\n\nFigure 1.20: The lever rule for a binary system B–A. The gray regions are phase fields where only one phase Φi is stable. (Often Φ1 is the melt, and Φ2 is a solid solution.) The compositions x Φ1 and x Φ2 and their amounts NΦ1 and NΦ2 of both phases that are in equilibrium for an overall (system) composition x0 can be derived from the “lever” or “tie line” at the corresponding temperature T0 .\n\nIt is not so for the white phase field Φ1 + Φ2 around the diagonal of the phase diagram. There every point, say (x0 , T0 ), describes only the state of the whole system, which is composed of two phases in this field. The system must be isothermal, because phase diagrams are constructed for thermodynamic equilibrium. Hence an isotherm is represented by a horizontal line in the diagram. The blue horizontal line in Fig. 1.20 is such an isotherm; it connects the states of Φ1 and Φ2 , which are in equilibrium at the temperature T0 with concentrations x Φ1 and x Φ2 , respectively. The full blue line is called a “tie line”. Figure 1.20 describes a “mixed crystal” system. Such systems will be described in Section 1.5.1.2, but the exact kind of the system is not relevant for the discussion here; it is only important that the 2-phase-field is neighbor to 1-phase-fields. A tie line is an isotherm in a phase diagram that connects equilibrium states.\n\n1.5 Phase diagrams |\n\n33\n\nThe tie line in Fig. 1.20 allows us to determine not only the concentrations x Φ1 and x Φ2 for both equilibrium phases, but also the corresponding amounts N Φ1 and N Φ2 . The lever rule x Φ2 − x0 N Φ1 = N Φ2 x0 − x Φ1\n\n(1.33)\n\nsays that the tie line can be considered as a mechanical lever suspended at x0 . The two loads act on both ends of the lever and are inverse proportional to the corresponding amounts of the phases. In Fig. 1.20 the point x0 is slightly left from the center of the 2-phase-field, closer to the Φ1 field. Consequently, the ratio N Φ1 /N Φ2 is the length of the (longer) right lever arm divided by the (shorter) left arm. We will show in the following sections that different types of horizontal (isotherm) phase boundaries may occur. Such isotherms include – eutectic lines (Section 1.5.1.3) – peritectic lines (Section 1.5.2.2) – monotectics (Section 1.5.1.4) – phase transitions (Section 1.4.2) and can result from the properties of one specific phase (e. g., phase transitions) or from the interaction of two or more phases (e. g., eutectics). However, the same process always appears at the same temperature. Then the enthalpy change of the system is only dependent on the amount of material that undergoes the transition. Plots of the related DTA or DSC peak area A(x0 ) are linear, because the lever rule (1.33) is a linear function of the sample composition x0 . Such plots were already introduced by Tammann (1905)43 and can be used, e. g., for the determination of the composition where an effect has its maximum. In Section 3.3, we show this for the determination of the “eutectic point”, but other applications are possible too. The idea behind the lever rule can be extended also to systems with three or more components. This is the concept of “barycentric coordinates” introduced by Möbius (1827).44 For three components A, B, C, this is demonstrated by the mechanical model in Fig. 1.21, where the blue dot represents the overall composition of the system x0(A) , x0(B) , x0(C) . The concentration values are not necessarily scaled with respect to pure A, B, C. Instead, the three phases Φi (i = 1, . . . , 3) are used as a basis. The aggregation state of Φi is not relevant; variable compositions (e. g., melts) are also possible. For details, the reader is referred, e. g., to Vince (2006), Wolfram Research (2020).45\n\n43 Gustav Heinrich Johann Apollon Tammann (16 May 1861–17 December 1938). 44 August Ferdinand Möbius (17 November 1790–26 September 1868).\n\n34 | 1 Thermodynamic basis\n\nFigure 1.21: The barycentric theorem as extension of the lever rule (Fig. 1.20) to ternary systems.

At high T, only one phase field liquid exists with variable composition ranging from pure A (x = 0) to pure B (x = 1). Also, at low T a phase field solid exists with only one phase, which is a “solid solution” or synonymous “mixed crystal”. The variable composition of this phase can be expressed in different ways, e. g., as A1−x Bx . If the real composition is not relevant or not known, then spellings like (A,B) are sometimes used, or A:B for very small concentrations (doping) of, e. g., A in B. In the liquid + solid field, both phases coexist, and the equilibrium concentrations xliq and x sol of the liquid and solid mixture phases for every temperature between the melting points of the pure components can be obtained if a horizontal “tie line” is drawn at this temperature. Figure 1.22 (b) shows two options, which can be considered as limit cases for the crystallization of a melt with an arbitrary starting composition x0 : 45 Stephen Wolfram (born 29 August 1959).\n\n1.5 Phase diagrams |\n\n35\n\nFigure 1.22: Binary phase diagram A–B, where both components show complete miscibility in the liquid and solid states. (a) with labels for the three phase fields; (b) shows possible crystallization paths during cooling of a melt with initial composition x0 .\n\n1.\n\nCooling of the homogeneous melt proceeds down to T1 , where crystallization of a solid solution with composition x sol starts with an infinitesimal amount of the solid. For a lower temperature T ′ (T2 < T ′ < T1 , not shown in Fig. 1.22 (b), the sol\n\n2.\n\ncorresponding tie line would result in another x ′ < x sol , which is in equilibrium liq with another x ′ < x liq . This process continues until T2 is reached, and one homogeneous solid solution remains, which has the same composition x0 like the initial melt. This process has the name ⇒ equilibrium crystallization. Again, cooling of the homogeneous melt proceeds down to T1 , where an infinitesimal amount of a solid with composition x sol crystallizes. However, if the initially crystallized material cannot equilibrate continuously with the remaining melt, then the melt depletes by the higher melting component (here B), and its composition moves downward the upper phase boundary (“liquidus”) toward the pure component A. Accordingly, then the finally crystallizing material solidifies at TfA and is almost pure A. This process of component segregation has the name ⇒ Scheil46 –Gulliver47 crystallization.\n\nThe crystallization path of real systems is often intermediate between equilibrium and Scheil–Gulliver crystallization. Especially for the typical cooling rate T ̇ ≈ 10 K/min during thermal analysis, equilibrium often cannot be reached, and the process corresponds more to Scheil–Gulliver.\n\nAbove the upper phase boundary in Fig. 1.22, the whole system is liquid, and correspondingly this boundary is called the liquidus (or liquidus line) of the system.

Under some simplifying conditions, both lines can be described analytically with the following Schröder48 –van Laar49 equations, which are valid in this simple form if no excess Gibbs-free energy contributions are involved (Gex = 0, see Section 1.2.3.2 and Schröder, 1893; van Laar, 1908): x\n\nsol\n\n=\n\nexp [− exp [−\n\nx liq = exp[−\n\nΔHfA R\n\n( T1 −\n\nΔHfA R\n\n( T1 −\n\n1 )] TA\n\n1 )] TA\n\n− exp [−\n\nΔHfB 1 1 ( − )] × x sol R T TB\n\n−1\n\nΔHfB R\n\n( T1 −\n\n1 )] TB\n\n,\n\n(TA ⋚ T ⋚ TB ).\n\n(1.35) (1.36)\n\nEquations (1.35) and (1.36) describe a lens-shaped 2-phase-field between liquidus and solidus, similar to Fig. 1.22. The lens becomes broader for large ΔHfA and ΔHfB and is asymmetrical (flatter on one side and steeper on the other side) for very different values of ΔHfA and ΔHfB . However, both lines are monotonously rising or falling, without intermediate extrema. If, however, such extrema are found experimentally, then a Gex ≠ 0 term is required for a numerical description of the system. Such terms often appear for the solid phase, and they often give a positive contribution to the Gibbs-free energy of this phase, which destabilizes the solid with respect to the liquid and leads to a local minimum of liquidus and solidus. Uecker et al. (2017)50 reported such a minimum for the pseudo-binary system LaLuO3 –LaScO3 close to LaLuO3 , with ca. 10 % LaScO3 . With their data, we obtain Gex ≈ 1 kJ/mol. In contrast, pseudo-binary systems between near rare-earth scandates REScO3 were found by Uecker et al. (2013) almost ideal and could be described satisfactorily by the Schröder–van Laar equations (1.35) and (1.36), because the chemical and crystallographic similarity of the components is higher in comparison to LaLuO3 –LaScO3 . If in a mixed crystal system, liquidus and solidus have a local extremum, then this must be a common extremum for both curves. This means that it must appear at the same composition xaze and the same temperature Taze . The point xaze , Taze is called the azeotrope point. There crystallization occurs without segregation: liquid and solid in equilibrium have the same composition xaze .\n\nIt should be noted that from the thermodynamic point of view, only the type of the phase transition (first-order) is relevant for the description by the Schröder–van Laar equations (1.35) and (1.36), but not the aggregation state of the involved phases. Hence also the evaporation of liquids or first-order transition between solids leads to a similar topology of the phase diagram. Abriata et al. (1982) reported the system Zr–Hf, 48 Iwan Schröder (PhD thesis in St. Petersburg, Russia, 1890). 49 Johannes Jacobus van Laar (10 July 1860–9 December 1938). 50 Reinhard Uecker (born 11 May 1951).\n\n1.5 Phase diagrams |\n\n37\n\nwhere both components undergo subsequent transitions hexagonal 󴀘󴀯 cubic 󴀘󴀯 liquid with complete miscibility of the components in all three phases. Correspondingly, the binary phase diagram shows two stacked 2-phase fields “hexagonal + cubic” and “cubic + liquid”, which separate “hexagonal” (bottom) from “cubic” (middle) and then “liquid” (top). Very often, the phases in mixed crystal systems are not ideal, and then the topology of the binary phase diagram can significantly deviate from the ideal lens shape in Fig. 1.22. As an example, LaLuO3 –LaScO3 was mentioned above, and Fig. 1.23 shows the system KCl–KI, which also deviates significantly from ideality and is discussed controversially in the literature. This system was reported by Wrzesnewsky (1912) with an azeotrope point at x ≈ 0.45, and Le Chatelier (1894) found the azeotrope at x ≈ 0.50. More recently, Sangster and Pelton (1987) reviewed the data on this system and proposed a small (4 %) solubility of KI in KCl and a rather large (45 %, equivalent to x = 0.55 in Fig. 1.23) solubility of KCl in KI with an intermediate miscibility gap.\n\nFigure 1.23: Blue lines: calculated (but incorrect!) binary phase diagram KCl–KI with an azeotrope near x = 0.4 and a miscibility gap. The red dotted lines indicate hypothetical alternative boundaries of this gap. Compare with the correct version in Fig. 3.25.\n\nThese discrepancies can be explained by slight variations of the phase diagram. First, a minimum in the liquidus can be explained by an azeotrope, like shown in Fig. 1.23, or by a eutectic, like shown in Fig. 1.24. The difference is that below the azeotrope, one single solid solution phase is stable, and below the eutectic, a two-phase mixture. However, solution phases are stabilized mainly by the Gibbs-free energy of mixing (equation (1.29)), which is proportional T. Consequently, all solutions become less stable upon cooling, which can result in “demixing”. For the KCl–KI system, this means that below the lower dome-shaped phase boundary, an initially homogeneous\n\n38 | 1 Thermodynamic basis\n\nFigure 1.24: Binary phase diagram A–B, where both components show complete miscibility in the liquid state and no miscibility in their solid phases. (a) With labels for the four phase fields; (b) shows the crystallization path during cooling of a melt with initial composition x0 .\n\nK(Cl,I)ss solid solution decomposes into two isostructural solid solutions K(Cl,I)ss (I) + K(Cl,I)ss (II) with different compositions. Like for the demixing of a van der Waals51 gas, the demixing equilibrium curve (shown in Fig. 1.23) surrounds a spinodal curve, where demixing is expected to occur spontaneously. The spinodal is not shown in this figure. Between the equilibrium and spinodal curves, one mixed phase can metastably exist. It should be noted that the demixing process is often accompanied only by weak enthalpy changes, because the crystal structures on both sides of the phase boundary are similar or identical. Besides, demixing requires diffusive steps that tend to proceed slowly, which smears the small thermal effect over a long period. Hence the observation of demixing is often performed by alternative methods. Schultz and Stubican (1970), e. g., observed dark/light contrasts from demixing lamella with ≈50…200 Å thickness in oxide systems by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Direct measurements of demixing by thermal analysis are rare; see, e. g., Velazquez and Romero (2020). The miscibility gap shown by the blue curve (and with slightly different parameters by the dotted red curves) marks the stability limits. This means that below these lines, one homogeneous K(Cl,I)ss phase is not thermodynamically stable. However, like for monotectic demixing in a liquid phase (see Section 1.5.1.4), phase separation requires overcoming some energy barrier. This is possible inside a “spinodal” curve given by 𝜕2 G/𝜕x 2 = 0. Hillert (1961)52 has shown that “upward diffusion” can lead to periodic concentration fluctuations there. In Section 3.3.2, we will show by experimental data that the blue lines in Fig. 1.23 are an incorrect representation of the KCl–KI system, because there unlimited mutual miscibility at least for high temperatures is assumed. It turns out that rather the upper red dotted phase boundary approaches the truth. 51 Johannes Diderik van der Waals (23 November 1837–8 March 1923) . 52 Mats Hilding Hillert (born 28 November 1924).\n\n1.5 Phase diagrams |\n\n39\n\n1.5.1.3 Eutectics In the beginning of Section 1.4, we pointed out that the conditions for mutual miscibility of liquids are significantly less restrictive than for solids: the latin similia similibus solvuntur means basically that we have a good chance that the melts of similar chemical compounds can form one single phase. It is not so for solids, where additionally identical crystal structure is required (see note on p. 26). A eutectic system A–B occurs if A(liq) and B(liq) are miscible, and A(sol) and B(sol) not, or at least not completely. In the easiest case the mutual solubility of B in A(sol) and of A in B(sol) is negligible; then the result is a binary phase diagram shown in Fig. 1.24. In Section 1.2.3.1, we have seen that a pure substance, e. g., A, has its melting point TfA there, where the Gliq (T) = H liq (T) − T ⋅ Sliq (T) curve of the liquid phase falls below Gsol (T) = H sol (T) − T ⋅ Ssol (T) of the solid phase. If we add some B to the system, then Gsol (T) is not influenced because no solubility occurs. In contrast, Sliq (T, x) is significantly increased by the larger disorder resulting from the B particles (1.20). The solid/liquid phase boundary is more and more bent downward, because Sliq (T, x) continuously grows with x. The same discussion can be performed starting at pure B, and under ideal conditions (no excess enthalpy or entropy), we can derive the equations x liq = 1 − exp[− x liq = exp[− ′\n\nQA 1 1 ( − )], R T TA\n\nQB 1 1 ( − )] R T TB\n\n(1.37) (1.38)\n\nfor both liquidus curves. In analogy to (1.35) and (1.36), also (1.37) and (1.38) are often called the Schröder–van Laar equations. Both curves intersect at the eutectic point (xeut , Teut ). If a sample with composition xeut is heated, then it melts completely at the temperature Teut . Thermal analysis will produce a sharp peak that is not different from the melting peak of a pure substance. Samples with x ′ < xeut start to melt at Teut and first form a melt with composition xeut (which is richer in B) under the release of A(sol). Upon further heating, this A(sol) dissolves continuously in the melt until the liquidus is reached and a clear melt with composition x ′ is formed. Also, samples with x ′′ > xeut start to melt at Teut , but under the release of B(sol) until, after passing of the liquidus, a single melt phase with composition x ′′ is formed. In Fig. 1.24 (b) the reverse case is shown, where a melt x0 is cooled until the crystallization of B(sol) starts at T1 . Consequently, the melt depletes in B, and with further cooling, its composition moves toward xeut (gray dashed arrow). This eutectic melt composition is reached at Teut , and then the remaining melt completely crystallizes. A practical example for the determination of a eutectic phase diagram is given in Section 3.3. We will show there that it is useful to plot the area of the eutectic DTA peak A versus the sample composition x. Already Tammann (1905) showed that the\n\n40 | 1 Thermodynamic basis functions A(x) rise linearly from both components to xeut , because for every sample composition at the identical temperature Teut , the first portion of melt with identical composition xeut is formed. Consequently, the required amount of heat, which is proportional to A, depends only on the portion of the sample that melts at Teut . According to the lever rule (Section 1.5.1.1), this portion rises linearly from both pure components (no eutectic melt formed) to xeut (100 % eutectic melt formed); see also Rycerz (2013). Haseli et al. (2021) investigated the pseudo-binary eutectic system KCl-Na2 CO3 by DTA, in combination with scanning electron microscpy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of quenched melts. Besides standard measurements with rates of Ṫ = ±10 K/min, for the determination of xeut , the authors performed heating/cooling runs with rates down to ±1 K/min. It was the purpose of these slow rates to gain, with a better thermal resolution of the system, a better separation of the eutectic peak from the liquidus shoulder close to it. As expected, this better resolution was obtained; nevertheless, the Tammann construction proved superior for the determination of the eutectic composition. We will show later that crystallization takes place often below the equilibrium temperature where it should occur, a kinetic phenomenon called supercooling. Figure 2.21 demonstrates this for pure gold. The degree of supercooling depends on the thermal conditions and on the phase to be crystallized. If near a eutectic point the crystallization of one phase is kinetically prohibited, then nonequilibrium crystallization can occur. Nakamura et al. (2013) observed this in the system LiF–BiF3 , where crystallization of the intermediate phase LiBiF4 can be kinetically hindered for BiF3 -rich compositions. As a consequence, DTA peaks related to a metastable LiF–BiF3 eutectic were observed. In such cases, it is useful to extend the liquidus curves of the neighboring phases below Teut . In Fig. 1.25, this was done by overlaying three (FactSage 8.0, 2020) calculations: 1. A full calculation, where all solid phases and the Al2 O3 /Er2 O3 melt (liquid) are taken into account. 2. A calculation where the right constituent of the eutectic (α-Al2 O3 ) is made dormant, which means that it is not allowed to be formed. This results in the dashed right extension of the Er3 Al5 O12 liquidus below Teut . 3. A calculation where the left constituent (Er3 Al5 O12 ) is made dormant. This results in the dashed left extension of the α-Al2 O3 liquidus below Teut . If in an experiment the crystallization of one neighboring phase is kinetically hindered, then the formation of the other phase may occur at these dashed lines. In the shaded, almost triangular region below both dashed lines, self-organized eutectic structures can occur. Orera et al. (2012) gives an overview on the production of such structures by directional solidification of eutectic melts. The preparation and measurements of optical and mechanical properties of Er3 Al5 O12 /α-Al2 O3 eutectic metamaterials were described by Nakagawa et al. (2005).\n\n1.5 Phase diagrams |\n\n41\n\nFigure 1.25: Phase diagram Al2 O3 –Er2 O3 calculated with FactSage 8.0 (2020). According Wu and Pelton (1992), for the eutectic between Er3 Al5 O12 and Al2 O3 , we have Teut = 1802 °C and xeut = 0.805. The liquidus curves of these two phases are prolongated below Teut .\n\n1.5.1.4 Monotectics Not all liquids (melts) can be mixed in arbitrary ratio. Already in the introduction to Section 1.4, we pointed out that substances with very different chemical nature (like water and oil) can hardly be mixed in any condensed phase. However, for inorganics with often ionic or metallic bonding, the chemical similarity may not be so strong like it seems on the first look: Some metals cannot be mixed in molten state, and some “network forming” oxides tend to form complex anions. Silicates and borates, e. g., have often complex anions of the kinds [SiO4 ]4− , [Si2 O7 ]6− , [BO3 ]3− , [B2 O5 ]4− , and so on. If such complex anions occur in a system together with simple oxides, like CaO, sometimes, a homogeneous melt cannot be formed; rather, a miscibility gap (“demixing”) may occur. The CaO–SiO2 system is an example of high technical relevance, especially in the building materials industry for the production of portland cement; there a miscibility gap occurs for SiO2 -rich melts (Eriksson et al., 1994).53 A miscibility gap in the melt leads to monotectic melting, and the topology of a simple monotectic system is shown in Fig. 1.26. In this system, both components are immiscible in the solid state, but complete miscibility in the molten state occurs only above some critical temperature Tc . Below Tc the mutual equilibrium solubility limits are described by the dome-shaped line in the center of the diagram. It should be added that demixing occurs usually not immediately below the solid dome, because the phase separation requires some activation energy. To overcome this energy barrier, the second derivative of the Gibbs energy 𝜕2 G/𝜕x 2 must be negative. The points where 𝜕2 G/𝜕x 2 = 0 are the “spinodals” of the system and are shown as a dashed line inside the monotectic region of Fig. 1.26. Impressive tomographic pictures of Al–In alloys with monotectic demixing were obtained, e. g., by Kaban et al. (2012). 53 Gunnar Eriksson (born 7 February 1942).\n\n42 | 1 Thermodynamic basis\n\nFigure 1.26: Phase diagram A–B with monotectic demixing of the melt between x ′ and x ′′ (apex at Tc ). The solid “dome” shows the equilibrium boundary of demixing; inside the dashed region spinodal demixing occurs. x ′ is often called the monotectic composition xm , Tm is the monotectic temperature, and xeut is the eutectic composition.\n\nFor potential laser applications, Klimm et al. (2002) investigated the pseudo-binary phase diagram YCa4 O(BO3 )3 –GdCa4 O(BO3 )3 . Both materials crystallize in identical monoclinic crystal structures with space group Cm, and as a result of their chemical and structural similarity, an almost ideal mixed crystal system is formed. With the measured Tf and ΔHf for both components, the phase diagram follows almost perfectly the Schröder–van Laar equations (1.35) and (1.36). However, an experimental problem occurred for high concentrations of the Y-phase (x ≳ 0.45), because mixed crystals Gd1−x Yx Ca4 O(BO3 )3 had to be prepared by melting together pure YCa4 O(BO3 )3 and GdCa4 O(BO3 )3 : Only during the first heating, single melting peaks were observed for the pure Gd- and Y-compounds at 1490 or 1504 °C, respectively. During the second heating run, the Y-rich compositions showed several (typically, 5) endothermal peaks, and after the measurements, the samples were obviously inhomogeneous. Figure 1.27 shows the interior of three DTA crucibles after such measurements, and only pure GdCa4 O(BO3 )3 crystallizes homogeneously and optically clear. The sample composition in Fig. 1.27 (b) is already in the range where multiple DTA peaks occur, and within the almost clear matrix, small orange regions can be observed (some of them are red encircled). This phase separation is further enhanced for the DTA sample of pure YCa4 O(BO3 )3 in Fig. 1.27 (c). Chemical analysis of the sample revealed that the orange region in Fig. 1.27 (c) is almost pure Y2 O3 , and the bright region is a mixture of three different borate phases. We can conclude that above the compound YCa4 O(BO3 )3 inside the ternary system Y2 O3 –B2 O3 –CaO, a miscibility gap exists, which leads to this phase separation. Nevertheless, Ye and Chai (1999), Hüter et al. (2012) and many other authors demonstrated that the growth of bulk crystals from such 2-phase melts is often possible.\n\n1.5 Phase diagrams |\n\n43\n\nFigure 1.27: Oxyborates RECa4 O(BO3 )3 (RE = Gd, Y) after DTA measurements above their meltin"
