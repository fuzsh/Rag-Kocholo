Fundamentals of Fastener Metallurgy and Heat Treatment, April 18 & 19, at Industrial Fasteners Institute. Learn basic concepts of fastener metallurgy and heat treating with an enhanced curriculum that will be taught over two-full days. https://ow.ly/o21Q50QHUE2 Students will gain an understanding of mechanical properties and how designers can influence or change them with thermal treatments. Common thermal treatments for fasteners, including the actual process and equipment mechanics use, will be explored. The course is heavily focused on carbon and alloy steel; however, the theory behind solution hardening and aging will also be discussed. In this new class format, additional material related to common industrial fastener strength standards, like ISO 898/1 and SAE J429, has been added as well as several practical exercises intended to reinforce and hone understanding of the material. Although this is a fundamentals course, students should have some understanding of engineering and/or metallurgy. This course is designed for engineers and technical associates. Although some areas could be explored in much greater detail, the subject matter will be best understood by individuals who have a background in engineering materials and mechanics. Pricing for this two-day course is $900 and FREE for IFI members. #fasteners #fastenertraining #fastenerschool #manufacturing\n\nWe just added three new recordings of recent Speedy Webinars: -Preventing Metal Fatigue -Design for Reliability -Electroplating Fundamentals Each is about 30 minutes long. Our Speedy Webinars are short, focused training on metallurgy and metals engineering topics that apply to product design and manufacturing. They are geared to design, manufacturing, and quality engineers. Each webinar covers a narrow topic, explaining fundamental metallurgical concepts that are crucial to know to design and manufacture successful products. And each webinar teaches practical take-aways you can use right away. Imagine spending just 30-minutes to learn one engineering approach or concept that you can use right away. Would that be worthwhile? How about learning two or three? And gaining a better understanding of the fundamentals of each topic.

Our Test Series questions have consistently matched the actual data and question types in the GATE MT exam. Here‚Äôs a perfect example: üìå Why TestUrSelf Stands Out: 1. Unprecedented Accuracy: We don't think any other institute has questions that align so precisely with the actual GATE MT exam data. 2. Proven Track Record: Since GATE MT 2019, TestUrSelf has been the only online platform producing AIR-1. Our comprehensive test series is a testament to our dedication to excellence in Metallurgical Engineering. 3. Direct Exam Questions: A significant number of questions from TestUrSelf's Test Series appear directly in the GATE MT exam, providing our students with an unparalleled advantage in their Metallurgy studies. Our commitment to quality and precision in preparing GATE MT aspirants has been validated time and again. If you're aiming for top ranks, TestUrSelf is your go-to resource. Join us today and experience the difference in GATE preparation for Metallurgy and Metallurgical Engineering!

Ginzburg, Robert Ballas digsell https://lnkd.in/eX-dsqrc This volume compiles information from physics, metallurgy, and mechanical and electrical engineering to epitomize the fundamental characteristics of flat rolling steel. Flat Rolling Fundamentals is drawn from in-depth analyses of metal properties and behaviors to technologies in application. The book provides a full characterization of steel, including structure, chemical composition, classifications, physical properties, deformation, and plasticity. The authors present different types of rolling mills and the defining physical analytical parameters.They also discuss the effects of hot rolling on steel and the role of lubrication and thermomechanical treatments to minimize these effects. This book presents qualitative and quantitative advances in cost-effective ‚Ä¶ Read More ¬ª https://lnkd.in/eSx6vQNm\n\nOne of the procedures for the quality control of LIBs is metallographic investigation of the cap and case of the battery, the spot welding, or the electrodes. Since these parts are made of different materials, they require different preparation methods. Join Us for our free #webinar \"Metallographic Preparation of Lithium-Ion Batteries\" on Thursday February 8th at 10am est. This webinar explores the various preparation methods as well as the target of each preparation and discusses the results.
