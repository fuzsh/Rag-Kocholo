P: MATH 11100 (not MATH 11000) taken within the last 3 terms with a grade of B or better or an appropriate ALEKS placement score taken within the last 12 months.\n\nMATH 15900 is a one-semester version of MATH 15300-15400. Not open to students with credit in MATH 15300 or MATH 15400. This course covers college-level algebra and trigonometry and provides preparation for MATH 16500, MATH 22100, and MATH 23100.\n\nPHYS 28500 Introduction to Biophysics (3 cr.) P: MATH 16600 or MATH 22200 or MATH 23200.\n\nThis course is an introduction to biophysics. The goal is to present important biological phenomena from a physics perspective. Briefly, we will begin with a review of biology from single molecules to cells with an emphasis on time scales and length scales. We will subsequently explore both static and dynamical phenomena in biology."
