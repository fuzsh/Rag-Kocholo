The discovery of his Thermal Law, subsequently referred to as the Third Law of Thermodynamics, for which in 1921 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (of the year 1920) represented perhaps his most outstanding and most widely recognized accomplishment. But there were many other important advances and actions connected with NERNST.We mention his work on the thermomagnetic effects in metals performed already during his thesis, his fundamental contributions to electrochemistry, his specific-heat measurements at low temperatures supporting the new quantum theory, his Presidency of the PhysikalischTechnische Reichsanstalt in Berlin, and his diplomatic initiatives for reaching an earlier ending of the First World War. Already from this listing we can see that a description of the life and the activity of WALTHER NERNST is similarly rewarding as it is difficult, if one attempts to present at least their main aspects in a satisfactory way. In addition to many shorter and sometimes also longer articles devoted to the memory of NERNST,which are quite valuable in this connection, three authors have covered this subject in the past in the form of books. Motivated by the memorial events on the occasion of the 100th birthday of NERNST in 1964, the low-temperature physicist KURTMENDELSSOHN first presented the highly noteworthy and valuable book on the great scholar and his times [Mendelssohn (1973)l. He had personally witnessed NERNST during his last creative period at the Physical Institute\n\nV\n\nvi\n\nWalther Nemst: Pioneer ofphysics and of Chemistry\n\nof the University of Berlin. Unfortunately, many times the fluent description suffered from incorrectness. EDITHVON ZANTHIER, the daughter of NERNST, who had supplied MENDELSSOHN with material, expressed her opinion on the book: “In it there appear peculiar points, which really do not correspond to the nature of my father. [Zanthier (1978)l. As a source of the history of science the book by MENDELSSOHN can be compared perhaps with the “History of the Thirty Years War” (1790) by FRIEDRICH SCHILLER in terms of its role as a secondary source. In 1989 there appeared the shorter biography by HANS-GEORG BARTEL in the German language, in which an attempt was made to correct these inaccuracies at least regarding the most important points [Bartel (1989)l. As a volume within a series of biographies at the popular-science level it was limited to a relatively small size. The works by DIANA K. BARKAN from the middle or the end of the 1990s are oriented more historically-epistemologically [Barkan (1995); (1999)]. Unfortunately, its great value is scattered in various directions. The historian of science DIETER HOFFMANN (Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Berlin) hence remarked about this book in his review: “The core of Barkan’s study, where she deals with the growth of modern physics and Nernst ’spivotal role in the process, is the best part of her analysis. However, her study is less detailed and insightful in its presentation of other parts of Nernst s scientific work. Indeed, those research topics in which he was engaged after the First World War are more or less neglected. [Hoffmann (1999)l. Also the life of NERNST during the First World War is treated quite inadequately. Furthermore, there are several more incorrect points. It is the goal of the present book to try and overcome the mentioned deficiencies of its predecessors. The book attempts to bridge the inseparable unity of biography and historical epistemology in the case of WALTHER NERNST, in many ways an exceptional human being and scientist, and his activities within the many fields mentioned above. In addition to the description of his life and the rise of h s academic career up to reaching the very high peak in the second decade of the 20th century, special attention has been given to his activity during the First World ”\n\n”\n\nPreface\n\nvii\n\nWar and the subsequent time. Aside from some special treatments, up to now this period - from 1914 until his death in 1941 - has been covered only relatively briefly or in a summarizing way. This is in contrast to its importance. The period contains NERNST’s actions during both World Wars, his attitude toward fascism, his occupation as Rector of the University of Berlin and as President of the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt, as well as his contributions to the electroacoustic musical instruments and to cosmology and astrophysics, which are frequently underrated in value. The treatment in the book is supported by presenting quotations written by NERNST, his students, coworkers, colleagues, and members of his family. In this case sources have been cited, which up to now were used only rarely or not at all. An attempt to include only such statements the validity of which could hardly be questioned was made. Sometimes for the discussion of physical or physical-chemical facts, a mathematical presentation has been used. In this case, an opinion of the physical chemist HANSJAHN, having some importance in NERNST’S biography, served as a good example: “Because it is a frmitless endeavor ... to want to aim at a goal along bumpy, impassable secret paths, where the mathematical analysis has prepared already royal roads. [Jahn (1895): IV]. In the attached name index to a large extent completeness has been observed regarding the (different) spellings, the first names, the years of the birth and the death, the titles of nobility, and any other information. Due to the enormous amount of material, in this book too, some aspects could be treated only indirectly or marginally. In this case we have in mind NERNST’S popularity as an academic teacher and his role as “father of the institute family”, his attitude toward women, his love of motor cars and of traveling, in particular to Italy, but also the occupation with more special scientific problems. However, this did not noticeably affect the intended goal of a comprehensive treatment of the unique personality of WALTHER NERNST and his important achievements in science, technology, and society. We hope that the present book has come reasonably close to this goal. Certainly, a total realization of it was not possible. Because of the large ”\n\n...\n\nVlll\n\nWalther Nemst: Pioneer ofphysics and of Chemistry\n\ncomplexity of the subject “WALTHER NERNST”,after one has treated it there always remains the fact that something had been left out whch deserves to be discussed in the future. We thank World Scientific for taking up the publication of our book, and we are especially grateful to Senior Editor Ms LAKSHMI NARAYANAN from the Singapore Office for handling capably and promptly our many questions. Prof. Dr. DIETER HOFFMANN and Dr. ULRICH SCHMITT (Institute of Physical Chemistry, University Gottingen) deserve thanks for their friendly advice and their support in connection with the sciencehistorical questions.

(quoted after [Dobel (1968)]), JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHEhad expressed his opinion on the development of the sciences, which at the same time implied the importance of the pre-occupation with the history of science. In the introduction to the historic part of I s ((Farbenlehre))GOETHE has remarked “Indeed, a history of the sciences, as long as it is treated by human people, shows quite a different and highly educative meaning, than If discoveries and opinions are only arranged one after another.” [Goethe (1893): XI]. So it is necessary and rewarding at the same time to illuminate with a few words the historic development preceding the scientific activity and work of WALTHER NERNST, in which physical chemistry as a special discipline of physics occupies the central place. The development of chemistry into an exact science happened around the turn of the 18th to the 19th century. Still in 1786 IMMANUEL KANT had denied chemistry this status: “So as long as no concept, which can be constructed, is found regarding the ‘chymischen’ actions of matter upon one another, i. e., no law about getting closer or more apart of the parts can be formulated, according to which, say, in proportion to their densities ... their movements including their consequences can be made clear and be depicted a priory in space (a requirement which hardly ever ”\n\n1\n\n2\n\nWalther Nernst: Pioneer ofphysics and of Chemistry\n\nwill be fulfilled), so ‘Chymie’can never become more than a systematic art, or an experimental doctrine, but never a proper science, since its principles are only empirical and do not allow a description a priory in a clear picture, hence, it cannot make the principles of ‘chymischer’ phenomena in the least understandable, because they are incapable of applying mathematics. [Kant (1786): XI. Although at this time to a large extent this remark had lost already its validity, it still emphasizes the necessary connection of the chemisby with the mathematics and due to the latter with the physics as a requirement for its transformation into an exact science. In Section 4.12 a few aspects of the historic development of the relations between chemistry and mathematics or mechanics, at the time treated as part of this discipline, will be discussed. Here only a few points from the history of physics and chemistry ftom the end of the 18th until about the third quarter of the 19th century shall be mentioned, which were important for the rise of the classical physical chemistry, for the completion of which NERNST then played a decisive role. The early history of these mutual relations extends to the time before 1600. During this period great scientists have demonstrated close relations between the chemical substances and their mutual transfonnations and measurable quantities such as weight (mass), temperature, and time. ANDREAS LIBAVIUS, the founder of the quantitative chemical analysis and the discoverer of the spiritus fumans Libavri (SnC14), connected the relationship (affinity) between salts with their crystal size, mass, and magnetism, as well as smell and taste. For the 17th century above all ROBERTBOYLE must be mentioned. His law of gases, which was discovered independent of h m also by EDMEMARIOTTE, and which, hence, is named after both scientists, quantitatively connects the pressure p , the volume V, the temperature T, and the amount n of the substance with one another: p - V-’ for T = const. and n = const. BOYLEconsidered the qualitative and the quantitative determination of the compositions of the substances as the main task of the chemists. Also he had introduced the vacuum into the chemical experimental technique. ”\n\nDevelopment ofphysics and Physical Chemistry,fvom about 1800 until IS70\n\n3\n\nThe natural scientist HERMAN BOERHAAVE from Leiden was similarly versatile and brilliant as the British BOYLE. His work ((Elements chimiaeii of 1732 contains data on the freezing and boiling points, on the values of the heat of solution, mixture, and reaction, as well as on the thermal expansion of the materials. BOERHAAVE distinguished between purely chemical compounds and their mixtures. The Russian universal scholar MIKHAILLOMONOSOV advanced the mathematical and physical side of chemisby. He is credited with the discovery of the conservation of mass in the case of chemical reactions, one of the most fundamental laws of chemistry. The French scholar ANTOINE LAURENT LAVOISIER had also discovered this law a little later independent of his Russian colleague. It is said that LOMONOSOV had coined the word “Physical Chemistry” for the first time. He had emphasized: “The chemistry of mine is mathematical. (see also Section 4.12). The activity of CARL FRIEDRICH WENZEL working in Saxony was highly important. In Freiberg he had recognized the influence of the amount of substance upon the result of a chemical reaction. The relationship between chemical substances he assumed to be inversely proportional to their time of solution in a given solvent. These examples and names in place of many others may be sufficient in order to demonstrate how strongly chemistry was dominated by quantitative and thereby actually by physical ideas until the end of the 18th century. Of course, this was a great advance for its development. Now quantitative laws with far-reaching consequences could be discovered. At the beginning of this development one can place the dissertation of JEREMIAS BENJAMIN RICHTER from 1789 of the University of Konigsberg, which was devoted to the application of mathematics in chemistry (see Section 4.12). The law of the equivalent proportions (1792) also originates from RICHTER. In 1807 WILLIAM HYDE WOLLASTON formulated its general version: “Chemical elements always combine with each other following the ratio of certain compound masses (so-called equivalent masses) or integer multiples of these masses leading to chemical compounds.” At this time also two additional fundamental laws of the mass balance of chemical reactions were found. We refer to the law of ”\n\n4\n\nWalther Nernst: Pioneer of Physics and of Chemistry\n\nconstant proportions by JOSEPH LOUIS PROUST from 1799 (“In a certain chemical compound elements always appear in the same mass ratio.”), which JOHN DALTONextended in 1803 in terms of the law of the multiple proportions (“If two different chemical compounds contain the same elements, then there appear simple number ratios between the element masses.”). Based on these laws in the beginning of the 19th century DALTON justified the model of the elementary nature of chemical compounds based on the assumption of atoms, which he treated in his book “A New System of Chemical Philosophy published in 1808. Thereby the foundation was created for quantifLing and mathematizing the chemistry. Therefore, more than LAVOISIER, DALTONis to be counted as the true founder of chemistry as an exact science, as has been noted already by the philosopher FRIEDRICH ENGELS:“The new epoch starts in chemistry with the atomistics (so Dalton, not Lavoisier, the father of the newer chemistry) and correspondingly in physics with the molecular theory ... [Engels (1 968): 5521. Essentially, the only common feature of the atomic theory of DALTON and the classical antique theory of DEMOCRITUS was the name of the treated objects, which goes back to the Greek &zopoq (‘indivisible’). Also this doctrine had been highly controversial. Prepared during the 16th century, perhaps during the 17th century the opinions collided with each other most strongly. For example, RENE DESCARTES represented the doctrine of the continuity; on the other hand his contemporary PIERRE GASSENDI followed the leading Greek atomist DEMOCRITUS. If the existence of atoms and, hence, a discontinuous structure of matter would be physically real, then between the atoms there should exist the empty space, i.e., the vacuum so strongly opposed by DESCARTES. The reality of the vacuum was demonstrated by the investigations by OTTOVON GUERICKE, in particular by his famous experiment performed in 1654 at the Reichstag in Regensburg using the Magdeburg hemispheres, by his construction of a vacuum pump, and also by the first proof of the chemical effect of the empty space by means of the extinction of a candle. In this way the validity of the atomic opinion had gained special weight. ROBERT BOYLE criticized the qualitative doctrines of the elements by ”\n\n”\n\nDevelopment ofPhysics and Physical Chemistryfrom about 1800 until 1870\n\n5\n\nARISTOTLEand by PARACELSUS, which were dominating during his time. He taught that the corpuscular or the atomic theory best explains the experimental experience and the existence of the vacuum. According to his opinion the atoms represent matter without any special quality, an idea which was contested, for example, by his contemporary NICOLAS LEMERY.\n\nAMADEOAVOGADRO from Piedmont worked out a molecular hypothesis, which is expressed in the law published in 1811 and named after him: “Under the same conditions (pressure, temperature) the same volumes of gases contain the same number of particles.” Since initially AVOGADRO’S paper remained unrecognized, in I8 14 AND& MARIEAMPERE expressed the same hypothesis. Although the atomic or the corpuscular understanding of matter turned out to become an essential basis of chemistry and physical chemistry, even up to the times after 1900 one could find important scientists such as ERNST MACH and WILHELM OSTWALD, who considered the existence of atoms and molecules to be physically unreal, in contrast to, say, WALTHER NERNST. In addition to the atomic theory, in particular thermodynamics and the theory of electricity represented further pillars upon which the structure of physical chemistry could be erected. The development of thermodynamics started from the interest to understand the physics of heat engines, in order to improve their efficiency. During the first half of the 19th century the most essential theoretical foundations have been created. Among the most important scientists who had contributed to these advances we must mention in particular SAD1 CARNOT, RUDOLFCLAUSIUS, JULIUSROBERT MAYER, HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ, JAMES PRESCOTT JOULE, and JOSIAH WILLARD GIBBS.In Section 5.5.1 this development will be treated in more detail. Together with the thermodynamics, the thermochemistry or the chemical thermodynamics developed into one of the most important disciplines of the physical chemistry. The evolution of the theory of electricity and of the electrochemistry was closely connected with each other in this \"electric age”, as the 19th century was called by FELIXPWER [Pinner (1918)l. In 1780 in Bologna the medical doctor LUIGI GALVANI had discovered a new kind of elec-\n\n6\n\nWalther Nemst: Pioneer of Physics and of Chemistry\n\ntricity in the behavior of the thighs of dead frogs placed close to an electrostatic generator. This new lund could be counted in addition to the atmospheric and the frictional electricity. GALVANI interpreted his discovery in terms of a vitalistic point of view. On the other hand, during the years from 1792 until 1796 for the interpretation of the galvanism ALESSANDRO VOLTAcreated the concept of the contact electricity, which became highly important for the electrochemistry. In this work VOLTA had benefited from the previous studies of FRIEDRICH ALBRECHT CARL GREN and JOHANN CHRISTIAN REIL. In 1798 in Jena JOHANN WILHELM RITTER founded the electrochemistry by associating the galvanism with chemical effects [Ritter (1798)l. Only after 1810 the Englishman GEORGEJOHN SINGERcoined the word “Electrochemistry”. Prior to this the term galvanism had been used exclusively. For the development of the electrochemistry during the first decade of the 19th century, in addition to the investigations by Sir HUMPHRY DAVY, JONS JAKOB BERZELIUS, and others, those by THEODOR GROTTHUSS are important. For example, already in 1805 the latter presented first ideas about the electrolyk dissociation, where, however, he considered the electric current to represent the cause of the dissociation. In 1857 RUDOLFCLAUSIUS interpreted this phenomenon statistically. The completion of the theory of the electrolytic dissociation fundamental to the natural science was achieved about 30 years later by the brilliant Swedish physicist SVANTE ARRHENIUS (see Section 3.4). In the history of electrochemistry we must emphasize the activity of MICHAELFARADAY also in this field. He created the basic terms electrode, electrolyte, anode, cathode, anion, and cation (see Section 3.4), and in 1832 he discovered the fundamental laws of electrolysis: (1) n = (zF -l-q, (2) rn = ( z F p q M , where y1 denotes the amount of substance precipitated electrolytically, z the valency of the ion, q the electric charge, rn the precipitated mass, A4 the mole mass, and F = eflL FARADAY’s constant (eo elementary charge, NLLOSCHMIDT number). For the theory of the electrolytes the investigations by WILHELM HITT O W on the transport of current within electrol9c solutions were highly\n\nDevelopment ofphysics and Physical Chemistryfrom about 1800 until 1870\n\n7\n\nimportant. Based on these studies in 1853 he discovered the transport law of the ions, which allowed a quantitative treatment of the mass transport in an electric field. In particular GIBBSand HELMHOLTZ applied thermodynamics to electrochemical systems in equilibrium or in the absence of a current. So already in 1847 HELMHOLTZ had recognized the equivalence between the so-called electromotoric force (e.m. f, potential difference between the electrodes of a galvanic cell in the state of equilibrium) and the heat of reaction. In 1882 he found that the voltage of the cell can be particularly well described in terms of the free energy of the reaction. NERNST extended these scientific advances in his fundamental studies on electrochemistry. In the 19th century for scientific experiments and as a current source the column developed by VOLTA and named after him played an important role. The discovery of FARADAY’S laws led to new current sources, the galvanic elements, of which we mention those of JOHN FREDERIC DANIELL, WILLIAM GROVE,and ROBERTWILHELM BUNSEN.During his search for a new galvanic element, in 1854 the German physician JOSEPH SINSTEDEN invented the lead-acid storage battery, which five years later was improved by the French physicist GASTON PLANTE.Only in 1886 the inventor HENRI TUDORfrom Luxemburg developed the first technically suitable lead accumulator. The discovery of the dynamo-electric principle was extremely important for the generation of current. It had been recognized first in 1853 by the Hungarian physicist ANYOS JEDLIK, who initiated its technical application in 1861 with the construction of a dynamo engine. However, this principle became widely known only in 1866 when WERNERVON SIEMENS found it independently of JEDLIK and also built a dynamo engine. This then led to a rapid upturn of the electric technology. In the subsequent “electric age the major innovation initially dealt with the electric light generation, to which also NERNST contributed significantly utilizing his electrochemical and physical experience (see Section 4.9). Among the fxst scientists working in the field of the classical physical chemistry in the sense of today we can count ROBERTWILHELM BUNSEN ”\n\n8\n\nWalther Nernst: Pioneer of Physics and of Chemistry\n\nand AUGUSTFRIEDRICH HORSTMANN. Since 1859 the former worked on the spectrum analysis of the chemical elements together with GUSTAV ROBERT KIRCHHOFF. The paper by HORSTMANN on the vapor pressure and the heat of evaporation of ammonium chloride, which appeared in 1869, can be looked at as the first publication in the field of the chemical thermodynamics. Also HANS LANDOLT and HANS JAHN, which later will be mentioned several times, have achieved important results withm the physical chemistry. Already in 1855 LANDOLT organized a physicalchemical colloquium at the Polytechnic Institute in Aachen. On the completion of the classical physical chemistry the physical chemist WILHELMJOST fi-om Gottingen has noted: “Physical chemistry as a distinctjield of chemistry, at least for practical purposes, originated in Germany during the lastjijlh of the 19th century. Who were the leading men of that period, i. e., born before 1860? They were Arrhenius, van’t HOE and W Ostwald, followed by Nernst - about ten years younger than the other three. [Jost, W (1966): 13. ... Physical chemistry in Germany started in Leipzig, and then spread by way of Gottingen to Berlin, there to experience an unprecedentedjlowering in a mutual exchange with all of Germany, and with the world.” [Jost, W (1966): 141. In this last listing mainly the academic career and the development of the scientific impact of WALTHER NERNSTis sketched. “\n\nChapter 2\n\nYouth and University Period (1864 - 1887) 2.1\n\nAncestors and Parents\n\nALBERTEINSTEIN had finished his obituary for his highly esteemed colleague WALTHER NERNST with the words “He was an origrnalpersonality; I have never met any one who resembled him in any essential way” [Einstein (1942): 1961, focusing on the human being and the scientist. NERNST occupied this unique position within human society in some sense also within his family. His ancestors have been craftsmen, tenants of an estate, ministers, and lawyers. Also his sons would not have pursued a career in science, even if they were not killed during the First World War. The name ‘Nernst’ is the Low German version of ‘Ernst’, having the meaning of ‘earnest’, ‘firmness’, and ‘fight’. This interpretation of his name fits WALTHER NERNSTvery well, and likely also in some sense many of his ancestors, which can be traced back into the 17th century. Around this time they lived in or near Prenzlau, a small village located in the Uckermark about 95 km north of Berlin. Originally, they worked as craftsmen in the village, as the cooper CHRISTIAN NERNSTand h s son, the carpenter JOHANNES CHRISTIAN. However, the great-grandfather of WALTHER NERNST, JOHANN DAVIDwas already a minister at the St. Mary’s Church of this village. His grandfather PHILIPP NERNST,a second lieutenant of the cavalry, leased a farm in Potzlow, 13 km south of Prenzlau. He had distinguished himself as an officer in the Napoleonic Wars, similar to his brother HERMANN, who later became chief postmaster. This great-uncle of WALTHER had been given the honorable task by the Field Marshal BLUCHER to deliver the news of the victory in the Battle of\n\n9\n\n10\n\nWalther Nernst: Pioneer of Physics and Chemistry\n\nWaterloo (June 18, 1815) to the Prussian King FRIEDRICH WILHELM I11 in Berlin. WALTHER's father GUSTAV originated from the marriage between PHILIPP NERNST and ELISEMAGDALENA MITTERBACHER. He became a lawyer. He married OTTILIE NERGER, a daughter of the fanner KARL SPERLING. AUGUST NERGERand AUGUSTE During his term of office as a judge in the small Western-Prussian town of Biiesen (today Wqbrzeino in Poland, Fig. 2.1) on June 25, 1864 WALTHER HERMANN NERNST was born as the third child to the married couple. There followed still two furtber children. Soon &exwards the f h i l y moved to Graudenz (today Grudziqdz, Wojewod District TordPoIand, Fig. located 2. l), about 26 lun north-west of Briesen, since the father had been promoted to county judge.\n\nFig. 2.1 The topography of Briesen and Graudenz (section of a modern map of Poland).\n\n2.\n\nigh School in Graudenz\n\nWALTHERspent his childhood and youth in this small town located on the Vistula (Wisja). This town as well as the demesne Engelsburg located nearby (Fig. 2.2) had an important influence on his whole subsequent life. His uncle RUDOLF NERGERhad leased this f m i n g estate, where he lived together with his wife ANNA.Here WALTHERspent many days during the holidays and on weekends. Because of these visits and the\n\nYotith m d University Period (1864\n\n~~\n\n1887)\n\n11\n\nassociated experiences, he developed a life-long love of the country, the farming, and his only passionate sport activity, namely the hunting of small game. Since this youth period until the end of his life the open nature outside the cities played an important role for NERNST. In a later chapter we will mention the estates purchased by him, at which he spent a large part of his spare time and eventually the final period of his life, and where he died. It happened on the demesne Engelsburg near Graudenz, where in 1891 the lecturer Dr. NERNST from Gottingen received the news of his appointment as a Professor of Physical Chemistry. The importance, which NERNST attributed to his visits to Engelsburg, resulting in his love of the country life, can be seen from the fact, that after the death of his father he left his inheritance to his aunt ANNA,in order that she could keep up the demesne after the death of the uncle. Furthermore, he gave the name RUDOLF to his oldest son (Fig. 2.2), and he named his youngest daughter ANGELA,having a connection to Engelsburg because of the Latin word angelus meaning Engel in German. The school education of WALTHERNERNST was provided by the Royal Protestant Gymnasium (high school) of Graudenz, which he entered in 1874. In order to illustrate the broad and even high teaching level of this institution, we list a selection of books mentioned by H. KRETSCHMANN, the Principal of the Gymnasium, to be added to the teacher’s library during the period 1882 - 1883 [Kretschnann (1883): 391: for history the third volume of “World History by LEOPOLD vON RANKE,and the second volume of “Germany in the 18th Century” by KARL, BIEDERMANN, for classical philology ctDe agriculturaii by CATO, and {c Bibliotheca scriptorum classicorum )) by WILHELM ENGELMANN, for the area of art, ancient history, and archaeology “The Ethics ofthe the “Handbook of the Roman Antiques Greek” by LEOPOLD SCHMIDT, by JOACHIM MARQUARDT and THEODOR MOMMSEN, the “Handbook of the Biblicul Archaeology” by CARL FRIEDRICH KEIL, the “Laukoon Studies by HUGO BLUMNER, and “Pictures of History: a Series of the outstanding Buildings o f all Cultural Epoches by JOSEFLANGL, for theology “The History ofthe Holy Scriptures” by EDUARDREUSS, and ”\n\n”\n\n”\n\n”\n\n12\n\nWaltherNernst: Pioneer ofPhysics and Chemistry\n\nin some sense on their own matters “The Principal’s Co?zfirencesofthe State of Pmssia by HEINRSCH WILHELM ERLER. ”\n\nFig 2 2 WAIAHER NERNSI (1) with the dog Tyras, the cousins EDITH(2) and FRIDA NERGER(3), his aunt ANNANERGER(4), his wife EMMA( 5 ) , and his children GUSTAV (6), HILDF(7), and RUDOLF (8) at the demesne Engelsburg in 1904\n\nIn addition to these areas of the humanities, also the fields of rnathematics and the sciences were well represented. The second volume of the “~extbookof Analysis ” by RUDOLF LIPSCHSTZ treating differential and integral calculus has been purchased. Twelve years later the mathematics textbook by NERNST focused on these subjects. The Gyinnasiurn also completed its stock of the works by CARL FMEDRICH GAUSS published since 1863 by the Royal Society of the Sciences in Gottingen. This institution will play an important role in the life of NERNST.In addition, a book by FRSEDRICH AUGUST QUENSTEDT dealing with petrology is mentioned by K ~ T S C H ~ Also A ~ .we must mention the highly acclaimed “Physics De~ion~strations - Inst~ctions for ~ x p e r i ~ e nin t s Lessons at G y ~ n a s i u ~ iHigh s , Schools, and Business Schools ” by ADOLFFERDSNAND WESNHOLD, who introduced the subject of Experimental Physics\n\nYouth and llniversity Period (1564 1887) ~\n\n13\n\ninto the curriculum of the Technical Schools in Chemnitz, focusing in particular on Electricity and Electrical Engineering. Furthermore, he was the author of a number of well-received textbooks of Physics to be used for school instructions. ‘The strong interest of the Gymnasium in wellfounded instructions in the sciences can also be seen from the selfproclaimed goal of a “continuity of the instructions in the description of nature” [Kretschnann (1883): 371, but also from the high quality of the respective teachers. As an example we mention MAX BROSIG, who had studied and got his PhD in Breslau. Prior to his employment in Graudenz, he had worked as an assistant at the Mineralogy Museum of the University of Breslau and then as a teacher at the Agricultural School in Marienburg (Malbork). Therefore, it is not surprising that the highly gifted and interested WALTHER NERNSTutilized the available opportunities at school for gaining a broad and all-round knowledge in the humanities and the sciences, from which he profited during his whole life. Since his school period he demonstrated a strong inclination toward the Latin language. It is said that he read Latin texts to his father and that he delivered a brilliant graduation speech in this language at the Gymnasium of Graudenz. The close relations of WALTHER to the theatre and to the dramatic art are likely a result of the humanistic instructions at the Gymnasium in literature and the languages. At any rate, they remain a characteristic feature of the later scientist. He had seen all stagings at the theatre of Graudenz, and in his youth he was so strongly attracted to the dramatic art and poetry, that for some time he desired to devote himself later to one or the other. Even without taking it up as a profession, the scientist NERNSTwas always a good actor. He was able in an excellent way to mimic the surprised or the naive person. Probably it was also one of his typical acting performances, with which in the beginning of August 1905 during his first lecture in Berlin he presented his greatest discovery, the Third Law of Thermodynamics, in such a way as if it had occurred to him just at this moment. Sometimes NERNSTpresented himself even as a poet. It is said that already in 1899 as a Full Professor of Physical Chemistry in Gottingen\n\n14\n\nWalthur Nemst: Pioneer of Physics and Chemistry\n\nhe has tried to produce a play written by himself at a small theatre in Berlin. However, this project failed since prior to the first night the theatre went bankrupt (which was likely not due to the play written by NERNST). Unfortunately, title, text, and content of this play are lost. What has survived is a “physical fairy-tale” entitled “Between Space and Time”, which NERNSTwrote in 1912 together with LOTTEWARBURG, a daughter of his colleague and friend in Berlin, EMIL WARBURG. Here we want to present the English translation of this tribute to the Special Relativity Theory of EINSTEIN ([Nernst and Warburg (1957)l): “Orice upon a time there lived a famous young scientist near the throne of a mighty king. What he was teaching was new and unique and could not be understood by the people. Therefore, they admired and revered him more than any other person. One day he came up with a revolutionary and challenging theory. A horrible tremor could be felt in the scientific community, since nature appeared to be shaken in its eternal laws. When the king heard about this, he calledfor the young scientist and said: Yfyou are unable to prove in an experiment the validity ofyour theory, which has already severely disturbed the most gified minds in my kingdom, you will have to sacrifice your head because of your theory. ’ The young scientist answered Yti this case have a light ballfabricatedpom a light metal. Then using the force of our electric machines, we will hurl it into space with such an enormous speed that it will race through space with light velocity slrsperidedfreely within the ether. My theory s q s that in the interior ofthis ball our time is brought to a standstill. % f o r example, we fill it with Jlowers, they will continue to blossom with the same ,fragrance, since our time cannot aflect them. And I f during spring we hurl the ball into Space at the right constellation of the planets, within a year it must retimi, and I can prove the validity of my theory. ’ Immediately, the king gave the order to prepare everything until spring including the last detail. All technicalpeople of the kingdom were called upon to assist the scientist and to follow his instructions. m e young queen, well knownfar and wide because of her beauty, had a magnIJcentphysical laboratory built, which she gave as a present to the scientist, and in which she visited him every d q . However, it happened that the young scientist and the beautifirl queenfell in love with each other, and one day a servant ofthe palace caught the two while they were entbracing each other. When this was reported to the hmg, he became very angry and had them brought to him in chains. Then he ordered that they be kept imprisoned in the interior of the ball. According to\n\nYouth and UniversityPeriod (1864\n\n~\n\n15\n\n1887)\n\nhis horrible plan of revenge, just at the moment when the.fainting desire qf the fettered lovers had reached its climax and when the metal ball was filled with the thrill of their hopeless passion, they would be sent into space in a never ending agony. So instead of being.filled with .flowers, the metal ball had turned into aprisonfor two unfortunate human beings. Now while the captain, who had to keep watch iri fiont of the only window of the ball, went a w q for a short moment, the chained scientist succeeded to melt the iron by means of an electric short and to free himself and then also the queen. Nearly senseless from the ecstasy due to their recovered,freedom, the two lovers embraced each other. At this moment the guard returned. Beirig.frightened by what he had to see, he closed the switch, which released the electricforce hurling away the ball. Within a fraction of a second the ball disappeared into the air with an immense noise, and after less than a few minutes it had reached light velocity. Hence, according to the theory of the scientist, time had come to a standstill, and simultaneozisly the lovers were united in an eternal kiss. In general, one believes that the ball follows a long, stretched trajectory through space similar to a comet, and that from time to time only for a short moment and invisiblefor the people on Earth because of the high velocity, it also comes close to our planet. In this case we feel its effect, when a human being is hit by the rays of an excessive feeling of love. According to the calculations of the scientist, until today the hall remains filled with a never-ending tenderness.’’\n\nEINSTEIN hiinself has noted such artistic tendencies of NERNST, because in his obitusuy for his unique colleague he said: “At the same time he was interested in literature and had such a sense o j h u m o r as is very seldom found with men who carry so heavy a load of work. [Einstein ( 1942): 1961. On Easter 1883 WALTHER NERNST graduated from the Gymnasium of Graudenz ranking as primus ornnium.

In fact, because of the excellent instructions at the Gymnasium and in particular due to the influence of his teachers, perhaps of Professor ROHL, and last not least because of the laboratory installed in the basement of the house of the family, in the end WALTHERdecided to study the sciences and mathematics. As reported by ERIKA CREMER, regarding his excellent marks at graduation from the Gymnasium, later NERNST is said to have summarized: “I graduated from the Gymnasium with distinction, I obtained my PhD with an average grade, I almost failed at the Habilitation, so it is only good that I did not have to pass any further examinations. [Cremer (1987): 1851. ”\n\n2.3\n\nUniversity Studies in Zurich and Berlin\n\nThe last statement attributed to NERNSTmust be qualified, if not revised. We must keep in mind that both with his dissertation as well as with his Habilitation (postdoctorate lecture qualification) within a period of only nine years NERNST has worked out laws of science the importance of which we can see Gom the fact that today they are directly connected with his name. Before we start with this discussion in the following, we have to point out that his wish to study science already indicates an important feature of NERNST,which characterizes the activities of the student and even more those of the scientist during his whole life. We refer to his strong interest in everything which is modern and current in the exact sciences and in technology, in order to explore its technical use. If the new subjects were leading to questions having solutions with far reaching theoretical implications and promising practical applications, he pursued them vigorously. During the decade, in whch NERNSTattended the gymnasium, a mentality had developed because of the rapid industrial growth, emphasizing scientific and technical knowledge and supporting t h s effort strongly. During this period sometimes even palaces were built for scientific re-\n\nYouth and University Period (1864\n\n~~\n\n17\n\n1887)\n\nsearch. Just at the time when NERNSTgraduated from the Gymnasium of Graudenz the opening of such a building was celebrated in Berlin. It was in this building where exactly 22 years later NERNST started his directorship of the Physical-Chemical Institute of the University of Berlin. The strong change in the prestige of science during the last quarter of the 19th century can be illustrated, for example, by the fact that at the end of the second decade JUSTUS VON LIEBIG was drawing only laughter from his schoolmates and his teacher, when he said that he wanted to become a chemist. Even in 1869 JACOBUS HENRICUS VAN’T HOFF met complete lack of understanlng by his parents when he told them a similar plan. What a different situation was met by WALTHERNERNST when he signed up already in April 1883 as number 6676 in the list of the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Zurich, in order “to devote himself to the study of physics, chemistry, and mathematics as we can read in his handwritten curriculum vitae [UAHUB: I, 31. Perhaps he has chosen this place as his first University, since at the time its scientific departments were still very young and, hence, quite modern. The University had been founded in 1833, and the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule (ETH) in 1854. In his German curriculum vztae from 1890 NERNST mentioned as his academic teachers in Zurich only the chemist VICTORMERZ and the mathematician ARNOLD MEYER, in the Latin (( Vzta Lipsia 6 4 1890)) [UAG] in addition the physicist HEINRICH WEBER, whose perception of the properties of some chemical elements at low temperatures from the year 1875 will become important in connection with the Thermal Theorem of NERNST. In his textbook in connection with the deviations from the law of DULONG-PETIT, NERNSTrefers to this point: “In the case of the most pronounced deviations, boron, carbon, silicon, H. F: Weber (1875) has shown, that for these elements the specifzc heat strongly increases with the temperature and approaches the value expected from the law ofDulong-Petit. [Nernst (1909a): 1741. Having obtained a certificate for leaving from July 26, 1883, WALTHER NERNST left Zurich, and on October 29, 1883 he enrolled at the Friedrich-Wilhelms University in Berlin for studying the sciences, ”\n\n”\n\nWalther Nemst: Pioneer of Physics and Chemistry\n\n18\n\nbeing registered under the number 902 during the term of office of the 74th rector, the classical philologist ADOLF JOHANN WILHELM KIRCHHOFF. This has been his first contact with the a h a mater, at which more than a quarter of a century later he achieved important scientific successes as a researcher and a teacher, and where in 1921/22 he held the ofice of the 112th rector. However, at the time he left the University of Berlin already after one semester with a certificate for leaving from April 19, 1884 in order to continue his studies in Zurich again. In his curriculum vitae mentioned above, as his academic teachers in Berlin he primarily refers to the physical chemist HANS LANDOLT (Fig. 2.3), who at the time as a Full Professor of Chemistry was still working at the Royal Agricultural Academy (Landwirtschafliche Hochschule) in Berlin. In 1905 NERNSTbecame his successor at this Chair at the University of Berlin. In addition, he also refers to HERMANN GEORG HETTNER, professor of mathematics at the University, in the German version and in the Latin version to the professor of physics at the Royal Agricultural Academy RICHARD BORNSTEN. As we can see from a document of the University, “Hector and Senate of the Royal Friedrich- Wilhelms T Jniversity of Berlin attest by means of lhis certijicate ,for leaving, that Mr. Walther Nernst” has attended a laboratory course in the T h e m . I,aborat. of the former at the Agricultural Academy, and a course on “D$ fkrential Calculus and Introduction into Analysis” as well as “Problem ofDVjerentia1 Calculus of the latter. However, this document also indicates, that NERNSThas attended three other courses: “Introduction to the l‘heory of Telescopes by the astronomer WILHELM FORSTER, as well as “Quantitative chemical Analysis and “Qualitative chemical Analysis by the professors of chemistry FERDINAND TIEMANN and SIGISMUND GABRIEL,respectively (quoted from [Schultze (1992): 49- 501). ”\n\n”\n\n”\n\n”\n\n”\n\nFig. 2 . 3 HANSHEINRICHLANDOLT(1905) drawn by his student WALTERADOLFROTH.\n\nYouth and University Period (I864 1887)\n\n19\n\n~\n\nApparently, the courses offered in organic chemistry by AUGUST WILHELM VON HOFMANN and KARL THEODOR LIEBERMANN did not interest NERNST. Possibly, he did not attend the courses by HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ, because, as reported by MAX PLANCK, they “did not mean any real benejt. Apparently, Helmholtz was never well prepared, he always spoke with a faltering voice, ... , in addition, he continuously had errors in his calculations at the blackboard, and we felt that he was bored during his lectures much the same as we were ourselves. As a result, his students gradually disappeared. ” [Planck (1967): 81. Perhaps, in the sequence of his studies NERNSTfollowed a plan, which placed in particular theoretical physics at a later stage in Graz, where he realized it then in the fall of 1885. In Berlin NERNST could not attend lectures by GUSTAV ROBERT KIRCHHOFF, since he abstained from lecturing due to health reasons. Anyhow, according to PLANCK, his lecture “seemed to be presented by heart in a d v and monotonous way”, such that the students “did admire the speaker, but not that what he did say. [Planck (1967): 91. The new matriculation at the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Zurich during the summer term in 1884 carried the number 6985. After one semester NERNSTleft this university with a certificate for leaving dated August 4, 1884. In 1913 accompanied by M A X PLANCK, NERNST traveled again to Zurich in an important mission: ALBERT EINSTEIN, being Professor of Theoretical Physics at the ETH since August 1912, should be and was persuaded to come to Berlin. ”\n\n2.4\n\nGraz: The “Second Scientific Home”\n\n2.4.1\n\nUniversity and physics in Graz, Ludwig Boltzmann and Albert von Ettingshausen\n\nThe University of Graz, where NERNSTenrolled during the fall of 1895, was older than the two others, which he had attended before. In 1585/86 it was founded for the first time by Archduke KARLI1 and was given to the Jesuits in the spirit of the counter-reformation. Therefore, from 1763\n\n20\n\nWaltherNernst: Pioneer of Physics and Chemistq\n\nuntil 1805 the Jesuit LEOPOLD BlWALD was the first Professor of Physics. It was credited to him, that the physics of NEWTON was known in Graz. In 1767 his work ctPhysica generalis)) appeared. Prior to BIWALD, JOHANNES KEPLERhad worked in Graz from 1594 until 1600 and had written his { ( ~ y s ~ e cr io us ~ o g r ~ p ~ i c u ~ } ~ . However, in 1782 Emperor JOSEPH I1 degraded the University to a Lyceum, and only in 1827 Emperor FRANZ I effected the second foundation of the University, which since then carries the name Karl-FranzensUniversity. During the year of NERNST’S birth Graz obtained another academic teaching institution: the Joanneum, founded in 18 11 and serving for the ~ i c u l ~ a l - t e c ~ n ieducation, cal was raised to Technical Highschool, the Technical University of today. Ten years before NERNST took up his studies in Graz, the new building of the Physics Institute (Fig. 2.4) was completed. At this time AUGUSTTOEPLER occupied the Chair of Physics.\n\nFig. 2.4 The Physics Institute o f the ~ ~ l - F r a n z e ~ - U ~ vofe Craz rsi~\n\nYouth and UniversityPeriod (1864 - 1887)\n\n21\n\nIn 1876 LUDWIGBOLTZMANN (Fig. 2.5) became hts successor. Primarily because of h m NERNSTwent to Graz, since in his works on the statistical foundation of thermodynamics this outstanding theoretical physicist had introduced a new concept in physics, which had been created by chemistry in the beginning of the 19th century: the atomic structure of matter. BOLTZMANN was a student of the physicist JOSEF STEFAN from Vienna. To the latter we owe, among other things, important works on the theory of heat, electrodynamics, and the kinetic theory of gases. Already at the age of 25 years, in 1869 he became Full Professor of Mathematical Physics in Graz. From 1873 until 1876 he occupied the Chair of Mathematics in Vienna. Then followed his second period in Graz, this time as Director of the Physics Institute, which he developed into a world center of physics. In 1890 BOLTZMANN moved to Munich in order to occupy the Chair of Mathematical Physics. When in 1894 he became the successor of STEFAN in Vienna, NERNST was supposed to take over his Chair in Munich. Following an intermezzo from 1900 until 1902 at the University of Leipzig, BOLTZMANN returned to his still unoccupied Chair in Vienna, which he did not leave any more until his voluntary death in 1906. However, the theoretician BOLTZMANN was also a good experimentalist. For example, during a research visit at the Physics Institute of HELMHOLTZ in Berlin, he was able to c o n f m experimentally some results derived theoretically from the electrodynamics of MAXWELL. During his second period in Graz BOLTZMANN achieved highly important and fruitful advances. Starting from a generalization of the MAXWELL distribution law of the molecular velocities of a gas, derived so far only for the equilibrium state, to nonequilibrium conditions, he had derived the so-called BOLTZMANN transport equation, interpreted mechanically for the first time concepts of the phenomenological thermodynamics, and formulated the H-theorem. In 1877 BOLTZMANN derived the logarithrmc relation between the phenomenological entropy S, introduced by RUDOLF CLAUSIUS, and the so-called thermodynamic probability W S 1nW. The latter represents the number of the microscopic configurations of a particular state. In this way one obtained an access to thermodynamics,\n\n-\n\n22\n\nWalther Nemst: Pioneer of Physics and Chemistry\n\nbased on the probability calculus and mathematical statistics, representing the starting point of the field of statistical physics. BOLTZMANN’S atomistic concept of matter met strong opposition. As h s opponents, in the first place we must mention ERNST MACH, one of the predecessors of BOLTZMANN in Graz and his colleague in Vienna. However, he was criticized also by WILHELM OSTWALD,with whom during his time in Leipzig he was privately on friendly terms, and who fluctuated in his opinion on the physical reality of the atoms. NERNST has always accepted and defended the atomic concept. Its rejection by OSTWALD led to certain tensions between himself and his “boss” in Leipzig, although the latter had introduced him to physical chemistry which became for hun so important. The ingenious works by BOLTZMANN dealing with statistical thermodynamics have been extremely important, in addition to many other physicists, also for the later research by NERNST and in particular for that connected with the Third Thermal Law. PAUL GUNTHER,a student of NERNST, remembers that his teacher told him, that prior to his discovery he had reflected much about this law completing the system of axioms of the phenomenological thermodynamics, in spite of the fact that BOLTZMANN had told him, that thermodynamics would be complete already [Gunther (1951): 5571. NERNST also learned from BOLTZMANN how to illustrate complex subjects by means of intuitively clear models. This capability distinguished both scientists not only in their teaching style. The law found empirically by STEFANin 1879, the thermodynamic derivation of which by BOLTZMANN (1884) was called by HENDRIK ANTOON LORENTZ “a true gem of theoretical physics and which states that the total density of radiation u is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature T (u T 4, , played a conceptional role in the glow-lamp of NERNST. NERNST’Smemories from 1930 express motivation, some disappointment, but also consolation: “When (in the fall of Z885,) I went to Graz, I did so with the intention to attend lectures in theoretical physics, which at the time were given at the University of Graz by the professors ”\n\n-\n\nYouth and ~ n i ~ e r s i ~ ~ e(1864 r i o d- 1887)\n\n23\n\nEttingshausen, Heinrich and Franz Streintz, KlemenCiC, and others in a larger number than at any other German university. ... My hope to work also with Bol~zmannin theoreticalphysics could not be realized, since at the time ~oltzmannonly ofered the lecturefor beginners in experimental physics. However, in addition to the excellent lectures by the teachers mentioned above, I became richly compensated by the daily experimental collaboration with Pro$’ v. Ettingshausen, in particular since Boltzmann showed an increasing interest in our results, such that the genius of this great theore~i~al physicist often i l l u ~ ~ i n a ~our e d experimental work during long s c i e n t ~ cdiscussions. [Ne30: 2791. ”\n\nLUDWIGBOLTZMANN (1) among his collaborators and students (Graz 1887): NERNST(2), FRANZ STREINTZ (3), SVANTE ARRHENIUS(4), RICHARD HIECKE (5), EDUARD AULINGER (6), ALBERTVON ETTINGS€~AUS~N (7), IGNAz K L E M E N (8), ~ I ~V. HAUSM~~G (9).E R Fig. 2.5\n\nWALTHER\n\nStill in 1927 also ALBERTVON ETTINGSHAUSEN reported to a colleague, perhaps HANS BENNDOW: “Nernst came lo Graz for the first time during t h e ~ a l olf 1885, and he remained there during the school year 188516 until about ,July; ... In Graz he was enrolled as a regular\n\nWalther Nemst: Pioneer ofphysics and Chemistry\n\n24\n\nstudent, deJjnitely at least with me, since I remember exactly that I have read his name as Nergst on the list; most likely he has also attended experimental physics with Boltzmann and perhaps also some other course. (quoted from the facsimile print in [Hohenester (1992): 131). As we can see from NERNST’Smemories, ALBERT VON ETTINGSHAUSEN (Fig. 2.5) in addition to BOLTZMANN became his true teacher in Graz. The research subjects of this physicist were primarily electricity and magnetism. In particular the investigation of the former became highly important in the “electric” 19th century. So it is not surprising, that also NERNST took up this subject in one form or another. In this field also other students of ETTINGSHAUSEN were successful. In this context we can mention, for example, FRANZ PICHLER, the founder of the famous Austrian electro-technical factories Elin in Weiz, OTTO NUSSBAUMER, who demonstrated in 1904 the first wireless transmission of sound, and also RICHARD HIECKE (Fig. 2.5). ALBERTVON ETTINGSHAUSEN was a nephew of ANDREAS VON ETTINGSHAUSEN, who was a teacher of BOLTZMANN in addition to STEFAN and JOSEPH LOSCHMIDT, and whose son, CONSTANTIN, was teaching palaeo-botanics in Graz and was one of the founders of this scientific discipline in Austria. He himself had studied in Graz with AUGUST TOEPLER and got his PhD there in 1872. Before he left Graz, TOEPLER could arrange that in 1876 BOLTZMANN became his successor, and that ETTINGSHAUSEN was appointed at the same time, since in contrast to his student this outstanding scientist was known to have only little organizational talent. This combination of the two physicists was extremely beneficial for the Physics Institute and by no means hampered the scientific reputation of ETTNGSHAUSEN as a researcher and teacher. This is well indicated by the strong appreciation and gratitude WALTHER NERNST always showed for his teacher. In 1888 ETTWGSHAUSEN was appointed prrmo et unico loco as Full Professor of General and Technical Physics at the newly established Physical Institute of the Technische Hochschule in Graz, together with a special teaching charge for Electrical Engineering. Here he worked as a teacher and researcher until 1920. It is likely that his departure from ”\n\nYouth and {Jniversity Period (1864\n\n~\n\n1887)\n\n25\n\nthe University of Graz was one of the reasons causing BOLTZMANN to leave Graz in 1890. “In the years 1885 and 1886 Professor v. Ettingshausen and mysey’ performed in Graz an experimental investigation of the influence of magnetism on the flow of electricity and heat, the results of which are reported in three papers submitted to the Academy in Vienna. ”, NERNST wrote in h s curriculum vitae from Gottingen in 1890 [UAHUB: I, 31. In this case he had slightly underrated the number of publications, which had been prepared by the authors ETTINGSHAUSEN and NERNST on the indicated subject and then appeared between 1886 and 1888. The total number was seven [Ettingshausen and Neimst (1886)] (see also [Nernst (1 887)]. The number of three in fact only refers to the publications in the Proceedings of the Imperial Academy of Science in Vienna. The motivation for these studies had come froin BOLTZMANN. NERNSTlater remembers, so “we began with a quantitative study of Hall s phenomenon along the drferent directions; soon we noticed closely related phenomena, we uncovered the group of the thermomagnetic and galvanomagnetic eflects, which already at the time generated a certain interest because qf’ their curiosity. This collaboration meant “the richest and most fortunate opportunity for young beginners, to become acquainted with and admire Ettingshausen as a teacher and researcher. It is only rarely that a disciple of his science went to his laboratory within the magnijicent building of the Physics Institute of Graz with such great jo y and enthusiasm, as it was granted to me at the time. ” [Nernst (1930): 2791. In the next section we will deal separately with the results obtained by the student and his teacher in Graz, which allowed NERNST to get his PhD in Wurzburg in 1887. On December 19, 1886 ARRHENIUS mentioned to WILHELM OSTWALD in a letter from Wurzburg: “By the way, there are ... good teachers (Boltzmann, v. Ettingshausen, and 4 lecturers, among others Jahn). ’’ [Korber (1969): 261. The latter, HANS JAHN, worked on electrochemistry and thermodynamics as a physical chemist at the Chemical Institute of LEOPOLD VON PEBAL at the University. At the time he was one of the few people emphasizing mathematics in chemistry. His text”\n\n26\n\nWalther Nemst: Pioneer of Physics and Chemistry\n\nbook on thermo-chemistry had appeared already in 1882 in Vienna. Since JAHNpreferred modern subjects and concepts in his research and his teaching, which NERNSTwas interested in, he certainly had noticed also this teacher, in particular, since JAHN had been close to the people around BOLTZMANN and ETTINGSHAUSEN, as we can see from the letter of ARRHENIUS. Perhaps NERNSTeven had been introduced by JAHN to the problem, the solution of which he could find in the form of his Thermal Theorem. When NERNST formulated this law for the first time in his Institute in Berlin in 1905, JAHN was his department head (Fig. 5.6). Later on, at least in his textbooks NERNST also contributed to the emphasis of mathematics in chemistry. In Graz he had studied originally mathematical physics with the teachers HEINRICH und FRANZ STREINITZ and IGNAZKLEMENCIC (Fig. 2.5), mentioned repeatedly in addition to BOLTZMANN and ETTINGSHAUSEN. He must have done this so emphatically, that in 1894 BOLTZMANN recommended NERNST to become his successor of the Chair of this physical discipline in Munich. We can see that in Graz the teachers, the learning conditions, and the level of the scientific research were clearly excellent. Therefore, the remarks by NERNST in his speech on the Austrian Radio on February 17, 1936, “that he came to Graz aflerJive semesters at the Universities o j Zurich and Berlin, and that he ivill never forget this town as his second scientific home” (quoted from [Skrabal (1942): 1991, see also [Hohenester (1992): 13]), came from his heart and are easily understood. NERNSTreturned to Graz several times, so already during spring 1887, after he had gone to Wurzburg at the beginning of the academic year 1886/87. 2.4.2\n\nThe Ettingshausen-Nernst effects and the Nernst effect\n\nThe experimental studies performed by NERNSTand VON ETTINGSHAUSEN in Graz during the years 1885 - 1887 were focused on the (transverse) galvanomagnetic and thermomagnetic effects. The galvanomagnetic effects appear in an electric conductor in the presence of a magnetic field I? and an electric field E , causing an elec-\n\nYouth and University Period (1864 -. 1887)\n\n27\n\ntric current of density ?and magnitude 1. In the case of a thermomagnetic effect the electric current is replaced by a heat current 0.If the magnetic field and the electric or the heat current are oriented perpendicular to each other, one speaks of the transverse effects. The HALL effect named after EDWINHALL, who discovered it in 1879, belongs to the transverse galvanomagnetic effects. In this case an = A,, @ x is generated, if an electric conductor is electric field\n\n7\n\n7\n\nplaced in a magnetic field I? and carries an electric current of density (A,, : HALL coefficient). In the case of a conducting strip of width h a potential difference, the HALL voltage AU = A,, b 1 I? I/\n\nfi 1.7).The HALL effect represents one of the\n\n7I appears (for\n\nsimplest phenomena caused by moving electric charge carriers, when an external magnetic field is present. The ETTINGSHAUSEN effect is analogous to the HALL effect, since for the same configuration of magnetic field and electric current instead of a potential difference a temperature difference is generated. In the case of the 1st ETTINGSHAUSEN-NERNST effect a temperature gradient in the sample causes an electric field oriented perpendicular both to the temperature gradient and the magnetic field. Finally, the RIGHI-LEDUC effect of an applied temperature gradient represents the appearance of another temperature gradient perpendicular both to the applied temperature gradient and the magnetic field. A summary of the thermomagnetic effects is given by HERBERT B. CALLEN [Callen (1960): 3051. In the modern literature the 1st ETTINGSHAUSEN-NERNST effect is usually simply referred to as the NERNST effect [Ziman (1960): 497, Huebener (2001): 1541. The 2nd ETTINGSHAUSEN-NERNST effect is formally identical to the SEEBECK effect. The ETTINGSHAUSEN effect can also be connected with the PELTIER effect (1834). The latter is caused by the fact, that an electric current always carries heat energy (PELTIERheat), in addition to the electric charges. Therefore, if an electric current passes through the contact between two different metals or semiconductors, heat energy is delivered or\n\n28\n\nWalther Nemst: Pioneer of Physics and Chemistry\n\nabsorbed at the contact, depending on the current direction. In the case of the ETTINGSHAUSEN effect the electric current flow and, hence, the flow of heat energy experience a side-ways motion because of the LORENTZ force. Now we deal only with a single conductor, and the two edges of the conductor represent the locations, where the heat energy is delivered or absorbed, respectively.\n\nHALLeffect (1 879)\n\nNERNSTeffect (1887)\n\nhot\n\n6\n\n~\n\n,\n\n0’\n\nETTINGSHAUSEN effect (1 886) RIGHI-LEDUC effect ( 1 887) Temperature difference\n\nH -.cold cold hot hot ‘\n\n,*\n\nFig. 2.6 The transverse galvanomagnetic and thermomagnetic effects. (Arranged underneath each other: name of the effect (year of publication) and the generated signal, schematically.)\n\nSimilarly, the 1st ETTINGSHAUSEN-NERNST effect can be connected effect. The thermal diffusion of the charge carriers in a with the SEEBECK temperature gradient results in an accumulation of charges at the contact between two different metals or semiconductors, leading to the longitudinal thermoelectric potential gradient (SEEBECK voltage). In the case of the 1st ETTINGSHAUSEN-NERNST effect this thermal diffusion also ex-\n\nYouth and University Period (1864 - 1887)\n\n29\n\nperiences a side-ways motion because of the LORENTZforce, and the accumulation and depletion of the charges at the two edges of the conductor, respectively, leads to a transverse potential gradient. The 1st ETTINGSJMJSEN-NERNST effect and the ETTMGSHAUSEN effect (similarly as the SEEBECKeffect and the PELTIEReffect) are strongly coupled with each other by means of the ONSAGER reciprocity relations. Remembering his time as a student in Graz, NERNSTlater summarized his activities dealing with the galvanomagnetic and thermomagnetic phenomena in his article celebrating the 80th birthday of ALBERTVON ETTINGSHAUSEN [Nemst (1930): 2791: “Following a suggestion by Boltzmann, we began with a quantitative study of Hall’s phenomenon along the diferent directions ... we uncovered the group of the thermomagnetic and galvanomagnetic phenomena, which already at the time generated a certain interest because of their curiosity, however, which should find a satisjactory theoretical explanation only ajier the theory of the metallic conduction would have been developed still further. ” The latter development of the theory had to wait until the 1930s and later, when the quantum theory was successfully applied to the electrons in solids. NERNST may have had this visionary insight already soon after his stay in Graz and Wurzburg. Here we see for the first time the distinct mark characterizing the great scientist to terminate a research project, if the lack of the necessary theoretical knowledge imposes a limit for its meaningful continuation. So it is likely that it were not only the other fields of research, which caused NERNST to leave the subject of the behavior of metals in a magnetic field, if we exclude a joint paper with PAUL DRUDE [Drude and Nernst (1 890)]. Today the effects discovered by NERNST and VON ETTINGSHAUSEN have gained a certain actuality in modem low temperature physics. On the one hand, this is associated with the quantum HALL effect discovered by KLAUS VON KLITZING, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery in 1985. On the other hand, the thermomagnetic effects play a prominent role in the mixed state of type-I1 superconductors [Huebener (2001)l.\n\n30\n\nWalther Nemst: Pioneer of Physics and Chemistry\n\nIf a type-I1 superconductor is placed in a magnetic field at low temperatures, magnetic flux can penetrate into the superconductor in the form of magnetic flux lines, each line carrying a single magnetic flux quantum. The magnetic flux lines arrange themselves foiining an ordered lattice first predicted by ALEKSEi ALEKSEEVICH ABRIKOSOV, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2003. Under the influence of an electric current (LORENTZforce) or of a temperature gradient (thermal force) the flux-line lattice can be set into motion, thereby generating an electric voltage. This results in a contribution to the SEEBECK and to the 1st ETTINGSHAUSEN-NERNST effect. The thermal energy transported by the moving flux-line lattice causes a contribution to the PELTIERand to the ETTINGSHAUSEN effect. In general, at low temperatures these galvanomagnetic and thermomagnetic effects due to the flux-line motion are much larger than the effects in the non-superconducting state [Huebener (200 I)]. Recently, highly interesting measurements of the 1 st ETTINGSHAUSEN-NERNST effect in high-temperature superconductors were reported, showing evidence for the appearance of a fluctuation regime of superconductivity as high as 50 - 100 K above the critical temperature Tc [Wang et al. (2001)]. This represents an important input for the theoiy of high-temperature superconductivity. 2.5\n\nConclusion of the University Studies in Wurzburg\n\nThe Royal Julius-Maximilians University of Wurzburg, at which NERNST studied during the winter term 1886/87, did exist already fiom 1402 until 1413 as a “Hohe Schule”. In 1582 it was newly founded again as a Catholic University by the Prince-Bishop JULIUSECHTER VON MESPELBRUNN in the spirit of the Counter-Reformation. The Emperor MAXIMI1,IAN I1 had issued the privilege for this. Only in 1734 it became open also to non-Catholics, and it became secularized in the 19th century. Medicine, being added to theology and phlosophy, was closely connected with the sciences, where famous scientists were working and teaching. To these belonged the physicist FRIEDRICH KOHLRAUSCH (Fig. 2.8), who caused NEWST to move to Wurzburg for concluding his studies primarily because of the pioneering research of KOHLRAUSCH on\n\nYouth and University Period (1864 1887) ~\n\n31\n\nelectrolytic solutions and the excellent modern research on electricity performed in his laboratory. At the time, the organic chemist EMIL FISCHER, who had been appointed in Wurzburg in 1885, may have been only of little interest for NERNST.However, two decades later in Berlin the two Full Professors were in close contact with each other because of questions dealing with the organization of science. FRIEDRICH KOHLRAUSCH had been a student of WILHELM WEBER, from whom in Gottingen he had learned the delicate details of quantitative electric and magnetic measurements and from which he took over the atomic concept of electricity. In 1870 in Gottingen KOHLRAUSCH wrote the ((Leitfadender prakiischen Physiks ( “Guide to practical Physics ”), which later became fatnous and widely accepted as the “Textbook of Practical Physics” or simply as the “Kohlrausch”. After holding appointments as Professor in Gottingen, Zurich, and Darmstadt, in 1875 he was appointed as Full Professor of Physics in Wurzburg. Here in 1878 he established a modern Physical Institute (Fig. 2.7). When in 1888 KOHLRAUSCH accepted the position as Full Professor in Strasbourg, WILHELM CONRADRONTGENbecame his successor, who later discovered the Xrays and investigated their nature at this Institute. In 1895 KOHLRAUSCH 1 I became President of the Phvsikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt in Berlin and thereby one of the predecessors of NERNST in this position. Fig 2 7 The Physical Institute established by FRIEDRICHKOHLRAUSCHin Wurzburg\n\nFollowing the tradition of WILHELM WEBER and CARL. FRIEDRICH GAUSS, KOHLRAUSCH occupied himself with the precise defrnition of the electric units and with the construction of the proper measuring instruments for this purpose. However, his special achievements concerned the investigation of the electrolytic solutions. In order to measure their conductivity he used alternating current. In 1870 together with AUGUSTNIP-\n\n32\n\nWalther Nernst: Pioneer qfPhysics and Chemistry\n\nPOLDT he was able to demonstrate, that OHM’S Law is valid also for electrolytes. The concept of the molar conductivity goes back to KOHLRAUSCH. He found the law of the independent velocity of the ion motion (1885), and, based on his own measurements, the Square Root Law named after him (1900), according to which the conductance h of an electrolytic solution is connected with the concentration c according to A. = Am -A& (h, is the conductance at infinite dilution; A is a constant), Together with ADOLF HEYDWEILLER, KOHLRAUSCH determined the dissociation constant of water. In addition to VON ETTINGSHAUSEN and BOLTZMANN, KOHLRAUSCH belonged to the true academic teachers of NERNST. For a long time the research and the findings by KOHLRAUSCH became extremely important for the studies in electrochemistry started soon by NERNST. He had also learned from KOHLRAUSCH to concentrate on the discovery of the fundamental ideas behind the ruling laws of nature, to limit hmself to their foundation and to the instrumental and technical possibilities connected with this, and to leave the precise execution and the final tests to his students and coworkers. It is interesting, that in both of his curricula vitae of 1890 among his teachers in chemistry, in addition to VICTOR MERZ and HANS LANDOLT, NERNST mentions only JOHANNES WISLICENUS, which, however, in 1885 had already accepted an offer from Leipzig. In contrast to his successor in Wurzburg, EMIL FISCHER, the former had also dealt with theoretical questions within organic chemistry, and in particular with the arrangement of the atoms in organic molecules, such that he can be looked at as a forerunner of stereochemistry. Probably, NERNSTincluded his time in Leipzig, where certainly he had met WISLICENUS, within the time he spent as a student. The modern view of chemistry, accepted by WISLICENUS in contrast to many of his colleagues, will have caused NERNSTto list him among his teachers. In Wurzburg NERNST completed his studies of mathematics with FRIEDRICH EMILPRYM and EDUARD SELLING, and possibly he attended lectures on mathematical physics by CARL ADOLFJOSEPH KRAZER.\n\nYouth and UniversityPeriod (1864 - 1887)\n\n33\n\nAt the time in the laboratory of KOHLRAUSCH, NERNST was joined by a number of young scientists, who had come from different countries to the fanous physicist in Wurzburg in order to learn &om him similady as NERNST. The group of people working with KOHLRAUSCH in 1887 i s shown in Fig. 2.8. In addition to the later Nobel Laureates NERNST an ARRHENIUS, also all the other young physicists did occupy honorable was R Professor positions in the kture: since 1908 ADOLFH E ~ W E I L L E of Physics at the University of Rostock, the electrical engineer GUSTAV RASCH occupied a Chair at the Technical University of Aix-la-Chapelle since 1905, the Italian LUIGI PALAZZO was head of the ~eteorological and Geodynamic Central Office in Rome since 1901, and the ~ m e r i c ~ SAMUEL SHELDON was Professor of Physics at the P o l ~ e c Institute ~c o f Brooklyn since 1889.\n\nFig. 2.8 FRIEDRICH KOHLRAUSCH (6) in 1887 among his coworkers: ADOLF H E Y D ~ I I ~ L E R (I), GUSTAVRASCH (2), SVANTE ARRHENIUS (3), \\XJAI,T I E R NERNST (4), LUIGI PALAZZO(5), SAMUEL SHELDON (7).\n\nAlso SVANTE WENIUS on his visiting trip to famous physicists and physical chemists made possible by a scholarship worked in the laboratory of KOHLRAUSCH in Wurzburg during the winter term 1886/87, following a visit to WILHELM OSTWALD in Riga. ERNST HERMANN RIESENFELD commented this event: “The accidental evenb, that at the same time also Nernst worked at the Institute of ~ohlrausch,and that the two so extremely gtfted and enthusiastic young scientists became close\n\n34\n\nWalther Nernst: Pioneer of Physics and Chemistry\n\nfiiena3 and supported themselves in terms of mutually motivating their work, had a decisive influence on the Jurther development of physical chemistiy, \" [Riesenfeld (1930): 101. In his German curriculzrm vitae of 1890 NERNST summarized: ''I studied at the Universities of Zurich, Berlin, Graz, Wurzburg, at the last of which I obtained my PhD on May ZZ, 1887. \" [UAHUB: I, 31. The PhD was graded as summa cum laude. The title of his dissertation was ((cjber die elektromotorischen Krape, welche durch den Magnetismus in von einem Warmestrome durchjlossenen Metallplatten geweckt werden)) (\"On the electromotoric forces generated by the magnetism within metal plates through which a heat current ISflowing\") [Nesnst (1887)] (Fig. 2.9). Of course, the thesis was based on the experimental results, whch NERNST had obtained with VON ETTINGSHAUSEN in Graz and which were discussed above.\n\nFig. 2.9 Title page of the dissertation of WALTHER NERNST\n\nBecause of his PhD obtained with KOHLRAUSCH, NERNST became an important part of the \"WILHELM WEBER Tree\", from which the following sequence can be listed:\n\nFRIEDRICHKOHLRAUSCH Gottingen WALTHER NERNST Wurzburg I ARNOLD ELJCKEN I Berlin MANFRED EIGEN Gottingen\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1863 1887 1906 1951\n\n1920\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\n1967\n\nChapter 3\n\nHabilitation in Leipzig (1887 - 1889) In Wurzburg NERNST could persuade his friend ARRHENIUS to go to Graz together with him during the summer term in 1887. The young man from Sweden followed this suggestion with great pleasure, in order to VON ETTINGSHAUSEN, and other meet there in addition to BOLTZMANN, prominent University Lecturers “a number of lively, highly motivated young men working along the same lines” and to enjoy together with NERNST and these people “the excitement generated by the ingenious teacher Boltzmann and the natural beauty of this southernmost German university town” [Riesenfeld (1930): 121. During this time the picture shown in Fig. 2.5 was taken. During this term WILHELM OSTWALD also arrived in Graz on a visiting journey to many Gennan universities. ARRHENIUS, who had visited him in Riga during the summer tenn in 1886, arranged the acquaintance between OSTWALD and NERNST,which should have important consequences. Because, after OSTWALDstill in 1887 had been offered the Chair of Physical Chemistry in Leipzig, there “was no candidate for the Physical-Chemical Section. Then I remembered Dr. Walter Nernst, whom I just had met in Graz and about whom Arrhenius had a very high opinion regarding his capabilities and knowledge. Since he had intended anyway to work together with me in Riga, I oj@red him a position in Leipzig, which he accepted immediately. [Ostwald (1927): 361. “Therejore, Nernst was induced to turn his attention to problems of physical chemistry, the extraordinary success of which for the advancement of this science is well known. [Resenfeld (1930): 131, as it was properly stated by ERNSTHERMANN RIESENFELD. ”\n\n”\n\n35\n\n36\n\n3.1\n\nWalther Nemst: Pioneer of Physics and of Chemistry\n\nThe Sciences at the University of Leipzig\n\nIn 1409, promoted by the invention of the letter-press printing technique, the “Hohe Schule in Leipzig was founded as a State University of the Wettinic Saxony by the margrave of Meissen FRIEDRICH I and, therefore, it is one of the oldest Universities in Europe. In the beginning of the 16th century, when ULRICH VON HUTTEN studied here for a short time during his ccperegninatio academics)) ( “academic travels ”) the dominating academic subjects were Theology and Law. Around the middle of this century there existed already the official designation ‘Professor of Physics’, indicating, however, scholars who were dealing with the naturalphilosophical writings of ARISTOTLE and of other antique authors. When JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHEstudied in Leipzig during 1765 to 1768, t h s title had obtained already its present-day meaning since more than half a century. In 1710 the Professor of Medicine CHRISTIAN LEHMANN had been appointed as Professor of Physics. One of his successors, the experimental physicist JOHANN HEINRICH WINKLER, who occupied positions as Professor of Philosophy as well as of Greek and Latin Language before he was appointed to the Chair of Physics in 1750, partly together with the mathematician CHRISTIANAUGUSTHAUSEN started a line of tradition of Physics in Leipzig, namely the investigation of electric phenomena in the most general sense, which was also taken up by OSTWALD and NERNST. An important milestone in the history of physics in Leipzig is the opening of the First Physical Institute in the year 1835. Its establishment Physical Institute I had been initiated by ”\n\nI\n\nName 1 Director GUSTAVTHEODOR FECHNER 1834-1839 WILHELM WERER I 1843-1849 WILHELM HANKEL I 1849-1887 GUSTAV WIEDEMANN 1887-1 899 OTTO WIENER 1899-1927 PETER DEBYE 1927-1936 GERHARD HOFFMA” 1937-194s -\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1 HEINRICH\n\nWILHELM BRANDES.

This list is supplemented by the Theoretical-Physical Institute list of the Directors of the TheoretiDirector Name cal-Physical Institute, among whom HERMANN EBERT 1894 DRUDE 1894-1900 we find the teacher of NERNST, PAUL BOLTZMANN 1900-1902 LUDWIG BOLTZMANN, and his LUDWIG friend\n\nTHEODOR DBS\n\nCOUDRES,\n\nTHEODOR WERNER FRIEDRICH\n\nDES COUDRES HEISENBERG HUND\n\n1902-1926 1927-1941 1942-1946\n\nwho before had been Professor in Wurzburg. In Gottingen NERNST had collaborated with PAUL DRUDE when the latter worked there as a lecturer. Later for a short time both were colleagues in Berlin in neighboring institutes. From the chemists in Leipzig we had mentioned already JOHANNES WISLICENUS, whom NERNST had mentioned as one of his teachers. In the following we name a selected number of scientists, who WILHELM OSTWALD counted among his \"Circle of Leipzig\" [Ostwald (1927): 80-110]. To this circle belongs CARL LUDWIG, one of the most famous representatives of experimental physiology. WILHELM WUNDT founded the modern, laboratory-based psychology, and RUDOLF LEUCKART the scientific zoology and parasitology. In the same year as OSTWALD the botanist WILHELM PFEFFER arrived in Leipzig, the studies of which on osmosis were most important for the theory of solutions by VAN'T HOFF. Furthermore, we must mention the astronomer HEINRICH BRUNS, the geographer FRIEDRICH RATZEL, the mineralogist and petrologist FERDINAND ZlRKEL, as well as the mathematicians ADOLPH MAYER and SOPHUS LIE. MAYER had been able to attract his famous colleague from Norway to Leipzig. GUSTAV WIEDEMANN working in particular in the field of electricity since 1878 had edited the journal «Annalen der Physik», being important also for the young physical chemistry. Before he succeeded in 1887 to WILHELM HANKEL as Director of the Physical Institute, he had been Professor of Physical Chemistry in Leipzig since 1871. As his successor WILHELM OSTWALD (Fig. 3.1) had been appointed as Chair.\n\nWaltherNernst: Pioneer ofPhpics and of Chemistry\n\n38\n\nAlready during his studies of chemistry in Dorpat (in Estonian: Tartu) with CARL SCHMIDT and JOHANNLEMBERG, OSTWALD had turned to problems of physical chemistry. In 1875 he became Assistant Professor at the Physical lnstitute of ARTHUR VON OETTINGEN. He obtained his PhD in 1878 with a thesis dealing with the theory of relationships in chemistry. In 1882 he obtained an offer from the Polytechnic Institute of Riga, where he continued his research on the application of the massaction law he had started in Dorpat. After he had become acquainted with the dissociation theory of ~ E N I U inS 1884, he admired this theory so much that until 1897 his research concentrated on the electrolytrc conductance and the theory of the ions. This period concerns in particular the fEst decade of his activities in Leipzig, from where in the fall of 1887 OSTWALD had obtained an offer, as mentioned above, much to his surprise, since still in the summer of that year “I had given up all hope, ... to get there. [Ostwald (1927): 921. ”\n\nFig. 3.1 WILHELM OSTWALD (left) in a discussion with SVANTE ARRHENIUS.\n\nThe Institute of OSTWALD in Leipzig became the nucleus and subsequently a world center of physical chemistry, fiom which about 60 pro-\n\nHahilitation in Leipzig (1887 - 1889)\n\n39\n\nfessors in this field originated. In the new Institute completed in 1897 the research on problems of catalysis was continued. In addition to the modern definition of catalysis, the concept of autocatalysis was created. For this work and for the studies of reaction rates and chemical equilibria WILHELM OSTWALD was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the year 1909. Already in 1906 he had retired early, in order to devote himself to philosophy, history of science, and h s theory of colors while living on his estate Grossboten near Leipzig. To WILHELMOSTWALD, who in addition to VAN’THOFF,ARRHENIUS supported by him, and his student WALTHER NERNST belongs to the most important founders and organizers of the classical physical chemistry, we owe a number of laws of nature carrying his name. Among these we count the dilution law (1888), which represents a formulation of the mass action law for the dissociation of weak electrolytes in terms of the conductance at finite and infinite dilution. His step rule (1897) describes the stepwise generation of more stable out of less stable forms atising frst in the case of chemical reactions. The OSTWALDripening refers to the growth of larger particles at the expense of smaller ones. With the OSTWALD process patented in 1902, in which ammonia is burned catalytically using oxygen from the air and yielding nitric oxides important for the production of nitric acid, later OSTWALD came in contact with the research of NERNSTdealing with the ammonia synthesis. In I895 the frst textbook on Physical Chemistry written by WILHELM OSTWALD appeared. Later NERNST underlined its importance for this scientific discipline by connecting the year of publication with the birth of Physical Chemistry. In contrast to NERNST, who always defended the lunetic atom theory, OSTWALD changed his mind several times regarding this point. Originally being a follower of this theory, after the 1890s he became its fighting opponent. However, in 1908 he returned to this theory again constructively such that he became a leading member of the Atomic Weights Commission. OSTWALD was also an active historian of science. In addition to the many papers by him, this is also demonstrated by the original publica-\n\n40\n\nWalther Nemst: Pioneer of Physics and of Chemistry\n\ntions of important scientific works founded by him, which are continued until today, and which are now referred to as ((Ostwalds Klassiker der exakten Wissenschaften)) ( “Ostwald ’s Classics of the exact Sciences”). When OSTWALD accepted the offer from Leipzig in 1887, he was confronted with the task to direct the “Second Chemical Laboratory”, which had been called “Physical-Chemical Institute” under GUSTAV WIEDEMANN. He took over the necessary space from the agricultural chemist WILHELMKNOP. The Laboratory consisted of three sections corresponding to the teaching program. JULIUSWAGNERwas in charge of the analytical section, which he headed already under WIEDEMANN. Until then a pharmaceutical section belonged to the Laboratory of WISLICENUS, who transferred this section including its head ERNST BECKMANN to OSTWALD. The latter physical chemist, who became known among others because of the development of precision thermometry (BECKMANN thermometer), on which he worked in Leipzig in connection with the determination of the molar mass, was referred to by OSTWALD as one of his “best and most successful coworkers” and as his “most loyal fellow worker” [Ostwald (1927): 391. As mentioned above, WALTHER NERNST obtained the third position as assistant professor. Although this position was connected with being in charge of the physical-chemical section, in 1890 NERNST writes in his curriculum vitae for his application in Gottingen, likely because there Physical Chemistry was part of Physics and not of Chemisby as in Leipzig: “In October of 1887 I accepted an ofler of Professor Ostwald, Director of the 2nd Chemical Laboratory of the Univerrity of Leipzig, to work in his Institute as Assistant Projessor of Physics. [UAHUB: I, 41. ”\n\n3.3\n\nThe Completion of the Thermodynamics of Electrochemistry: The Nernst Equation\n\nThe year 1887, in the autumn of which NERNST entered the Laboratory of WILHELMOSTWALD in Leipzig, was called by the latter a “turning point of science ”, “a critical year ofJirst order, in the sense of an exceptional frurtfulness [Ostwald (1927): 191 and a “year ofgeneral welfare ” ”\n\nHabilitation in Leipzig (1887 1889) ~\n\n41\n\n[Ostwald (1927): 261. Indeed, with the offer of the position as Professor in Leipzig to OSTWALD for the first time a true academic teaching institution for physical chemistry had been created. All other locations, including that headed by GUSTAV WIEDEMANN, already carried this teaching subject in their notation, however, they did not have the rank and the in Leipzig. Furimportance of the institution established by OSTWALD thermore, shortly before, on February 15, 1887, the first issue of the (( Zeitschrft fur physikalische Chemie, Stochiometrie und Verwandtschaji slehrex, initiated by OSTWALD and edited by h m and VAN’THOFF, was published by the Company founded in 181 1 by WILHELM ENGELMANN in Leipzig. With this university chair and this publication channel, the “ZeitschrrJi”,as it was called later by NERNST and others, the two necessary prerequisites were created, which justified to accept Physical Chemistry now as an independent scientific discipline. Also the perception of ARRHENIUS derived from his studies of the conductance of the electrolytes, that in general the electric conduction is caused only by one part of the electrolytes whereas the other part contributes nothing, experienced a dramatic breakthrough in 1887. Up to then it remained unclear what causes this difference. In this year ARRHENIUS saw clearly, that the part of the electrolyte responsible for the conductance is completely disintegrated into electrically charged particles, the ions, whereas the noncontributing part is not dissociated and, hence, is electrically neutral. Actually, this insight was not only a milestone for electrochemistiy, but for the whole of chemistry. WILHELM OSTWALD commented: “Also originating @om this point there rapidly developed Q large and nelv,field of science. [Ostwald (1927): 201. This field now became interesting also to WALTHER NERNST. His first study in this field was initiated by deviations found in the case of mercuty compounds between a thermodynamic theory of galvanic cells created by HERMANN VON HELMHOLTZ, connecting the reaction heat of the chemical reaction with the temperature dependence of the electrotnotoric force, and measurements by SIEGFRIED CZAPSKI [Czapski (1884)l. Here it had been assumed that the thermochemical data determined by JULIUS THOMSON are correct. OSTWALD asked NERNST to check these values of ”\n\n42\n\nWalther Nemst: Pioneer ofphysics and of Chemistry\n\nthe reaction heat. The latter then could show that the data of THOMSON were incorrect and that the theory of HELMHOLTZ was satisfied also for mercury compounds [Nernst (1888a)l. The great achievement of NERNST during his time in Leipzig was directly connected with the perceptions of VAN’T HOFF and ARRHENIUS. Regarding VAN’THOFF, it concerned the theory of dilute solutions. Its thermodynamic foundation for the comprehension of chemical equilibria had been established by AUGUSTFRIEDRICH HORSTMANN, however, being restricted to gases. A certain similarity between gases and dilute solutions had been recognized primarily by JULIUSTHOMSON, without explaining its specific nature. In an ingenious way VAN’T HOFFwas able to demonstrate the analogy between ideal gases and dilute ideal solutions, and the common validity of the thermodynamic laws for gases and for dilute solutions, where the key was provided by the osmotic pressure properly studied by WILHELM PFEFFER. ARRHENIUS recalled the words of VAN’T HOFF in his lecture ~ U nproprie‘te‘ e ge‘ne‘rale de la matikre diZue‘ei)in 1885 at the Swedish Academy of Science in Stockholm, which explained this matter, and which ARRHENIUS called an “extraordinarily important generalization ofAvogadro ’s Law. ... The pressure of’a gas at a given temperature, f a certain number of molecules are contained in a certain volume, is equal to the osmotic pressure developed under the same conditions by the majority of substances, Ifthey are dissolved in an arbitrary liquid, no matter which. [Arrhenius (1887): 6311. So according to VAN’T HOFF one can formulate the equation pV = iRT between the osmotic or the gas pressure p , the volume V, and the temperature T at constant amount of material ( R universal gas constant). He has devoted many studies to the coefficient i, and he could show that for ideal gases it is equal to one and for dilute solutions close to one. ARRHENIUS could indicate its true nature in his dissociation theory, briefly sketched above, which"
