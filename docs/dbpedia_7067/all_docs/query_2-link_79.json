        "text": "Hear how On Course has contributed to Asheville-Buncombe Tech CC\n\n“The move to Zoom worked really well and provided me with useful online strategies and tools I will use in future online class environments. All the different opportunities for interaction were really helpful.” – Laurie Bauer, Developmental Reading, UC Blue Ash, OH\n\nThat was the longest Zoom session I have participated in, but it was one of the most engaging Zoom sessions I’ve participated in. Jonathan and Carolina did a great job and kept it very interesting and varied the whole way through. – Lesley-Anne Loon, Administrative Assistant III, Cypress College Foundation, CA\n\n“You did a great job. It was interactive, supportive, and there were sufficient breaks that I was able to pay better attention.” – Ruth Benander, English, UC Blue Ash, OH\n\n“Thank you, this has been a fantastic experience that was well worth the time. I will carry it with me in the future.” – Jamie Albert, Assistant Professor, Art and Visual Communication, UC Blue Ash, OH\n\n“I liked the real-time demonstration of how to use the strategies online. This will be very helpful.” – Sue Schlembach, Assistant Professor, Education, UC Blue Ash, OH\n\n“I liked re-thinking some of my current course content. I also liked participating online as that is how I will be teaching in the fall. The workshop gave me a real life experience of what students experience.” – Deb Frame, Professor of Psychology, UC Blue Ash, OH\n\n“The strategies presented here are numerous, practical, and not too difficult to adapt and implement.” – Melinda Greer, Associate Professor of Chemistry, UC Blue Ash, OH\n\n“This was VERY useful and I have many ideas to take back to my classes and apply. I have participated with other OnCourse classes, this being the longer version and having more insight, I think I have much more to take away and participation was helpful – I like this format” – Monica Hennessy, Assistant Professor, Math, UC Blue Ash, OH\n\n“I enjoyed the interactive component. The breakout room activities were particularly beneficial.” – Cassandra Kilzer, Adjunct Professor/English, Cypress College, CA\n\n“It was definitely to “practice what you preach.” It felt a lot more effective than some other workshops I’ve been through. I enjoyed being able to talk things through with colleagues. I also have previously bought Jonathan’s book and I liked this method of going through examples more than just reading.” – Barbara Kramer, Professor of Chemistry, Truman State University, MO\n\nI loved the workshop! Thank you for helping me be a better instructor. – Erika M. Warnick, Faculty, Reading and Education, South Plains College, TX\n\nThe On Course I Workshop is an excellent workshop whether you come as a counselor, advisor, administrator, or faculty member. I am going home empowered. I am looking forward to attending the On Course II Workshop and the On Course National Conference next year and facilitating the use of this excellent retention/student success course at my college. – Mary West, Associate Vice President of Instruction, Guilford Technical Community College, NC\n\nWhat I liked best about the On Course II Workshop was the incredible variety of strategies that are modeled, the community that developed with all members, and the incredible learning process of working through a design team. It was an amazing learning experience. – Deb Olsen, Counselor, Madison Area Technical College, IN\n\nThis workshop was absolutely wonderful. The content is right on the money for where we want our college to go… This is most definitely the best workshop I have ever participated in. – Larry G. Bailey, Vice-President for Academic Affairs, Jackson State Community College, TN\n\nThis workshop was transformational! – Lisa Rocks, Clinical Coordinator and Faculty Development Coordinator, Allegany College of Maryland, MD\n\nThis was the best workshop I’ve ever attended in 28 years of teaching.

I will absolutely recommend this workshop to other educators! – Lee Ann Adams, Reading Specialist & First-Year Seminar Coordinator, Indiana University East, IN\n\nThis was the best workshop I have ever attended. Its very nature kept me involved and interested, whereas others, even really good ones, caused diminishing enthusiasm and interest. Everyone with whom I talked at the workshop expressed the same view. – Randy Klein, Faculty, History and English, Neumann University, PA\n\nI am thrilled that I attended. I feel like I’m returning to my institution armed with knowledge/activities/skills to help me be a better instructor/campus leader, and person. The workshop is practical yet profound. – Lesley Rennis, Chair and Faculty, Health Sciences, Borough of Manhattan Community College, NY\n\nThe response to your [On Course I] Workshop has been really overwhelming! Those who participated in the workshop are spreading the word here on campus and the “buzz” is on. The VP of Instruction wants you to come back! Her goal is to have more faculty trained. She also wants to attend a workshop herself. Our President told me “On Course needs to be the cornerstone of our success program.” – Sally Sharbaugh, Counselor, South Puget Sound Community College, WA\n\nAs a new teacher, I felt like a sponge, absorbing every bit of information I could. Everything we did was immediately applicable to my classes and my students! I would highly recommend this workshop to new teachers so they get started “On Course.” – Carolyn Weyel, Faculty, Student Life and Leadership, Cuesta College, CA\n\nThe best educational workshop I’ve attended in 15 years. Excellent presenter, rapid pace, lots of variety. – Robert Patterson, Faculty, Dental Hygiene, Howard College, TX\n\nThis was/is the best conference/workshop I have ever attended (I have attended many). This training will impact many students and professionals at our campus in big positive ways. – Sophia Marku, Faculty, Reading, Onandaga Community College, NY\n\nBy far, the On Course Workshops (and conference) yield so many more possibilities for energizing and renewing work with students than any others I attend. I’m never disappointed. – Laura Wimberley, Associate Director, Undergrad Studies, Texas A&M University, TX\n\nAbsolutely wonderful and transformational workshop. Not only did the experience provide me with an opportunity to make a change/make a difference in the lives of students, but it also provided me the opportunity to grow and learn about myself as an educator and as a person. – Bill Johnson, Student Success Coordinator, University of North Carolina-Greensboro, NC\n\nThis has been, without a doubt, the best workshop I have attended during my 35 years of professional life. I wish I had discovered the On Course I Workshop years ago. – Jan Reed, Counselor, First Year Programs, Piedmont Virginia Community College, VA\n\nThe On Course I and On Course II Workshops are the best designed and implemented workshops I have ever attended. Magic! I can’t even imagine improvements! – Amy Crouse-Powers, Coordinator of Peer Tutoring, SUNY Oneonta, NY\n\nI got a ton out of this workshop and I’m leaving inspired. – John Fisher, Faculty, English, San Juan College, NM\n\nI enjoyed coming to this workshop as a young educator (I’ve worked in higher education less than 5 years) and I believe I have taken away really valuable lessons to use throughout my career. – Makenna Schluter, Academic Advisor, Minnesota State University Moorhead, MN\n\nThis was an amazing experience. I am enriched, and I will take this back to my campus and spread that enrichment. I am going to revise future syllabi to include many of these fun, but amazingly intelligent ways to foster deep learning. – Paula Pack, Academic Programs Specialist, University of Tampa, FL\n\nI can’t thank you enough for the most enlightening workshop experience. I LOVED On Course!!! You are very inspirational, and the perfect model of excellent teaching. I worked on On Course ideas all the way home on the train. I hope to see you soon at On Course II. – Kristin Flynn, Academic Advisor, SUNY Ulster Community College, NY\n\nI have found both On Course Workshops to be thoroughly enjoyable and extremely valuable learning experiences. – Dave Bahrs, Faculty, Mathematics, Montgomery College, MD\n\nIn my 15+ years as a professional in the field of digital media and as an educator, I have never participated in a workshop/professional development opportunity that comes anywhere close (not in the same universe) to comparing to On Course with regard to richness, relevance, and professionalism. My only wish is that every faculty member and instructional/student services staff member could participate as well, because the integration of this material in our classes, in our instructional design approaches and in the myriad ways with which we interact with students and each other will not only improve retention, student success in our courses and programs, students chances of getting a good job, but will ultimately make us all–faculty, staff, and students–better humans. That is worth more than we can know. – Constance Humphries, Faculty, Business and Computer Technologies, Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College, NC\n\nI loved this workshop! Thank you so much for giving me a whole new outlook on working with students and a new perspective of my own life. This was such an amazing experience! Thank you! – Ashley Cundiff, Admission Counselor and UNV101 Instructor, Miami University, OH\n\nThis workshop kept me on the edge of my seat for four consecutive days.

I can’t thank you enough for your commitment to educators and students. – Robert Quinn, Faculty, Mathematics, Jamestown Community College, NY\n\nThis workshop has been absolutely one of the best I’ve ever been a part of. I liked how all the information works for my profession. Love the online resources. – Lino Gutierrez, Director, Student Support Services, Heritage University, WA\n\nI am definitely going to recommend this workshop to my colleagues. – James Munger, Faculty, Web Technology, Lake Land College, IL\n\nThis is the best workshop on teaching and learning I’ve ever attended. – Sarah Clemmons, Senior Vice-President of Instructional and Student Services, Chipola College, FL\n\nWhat a wonderful variety of learner-centered activities! I had been feeling drained by being surrounded by a lot of “no” people. After this workshop, I feel reinvigorated to empower my students. – Ziomara Cervantes, SSS TRIO Academic Coach, University of Wisconsin-River Falls, WI\n\nI knew I wanted to help students develop non-cognitive strategies that support their success before I came to this workshop, but now I know HOW to cultivate the development of those strategies. – Christopher Barry, Director, Retention and Student Success, Lincoln Land Community College, IL\n\nI’ve thoroughly enjoyed this workshop and look forward to attending the On Course II Workshop in the next year. – Tonya Greene, Director, First Year Academy, Wake Technical Community College, NC\n\nThis was a really great workshop! Many times I attend trainings and leave with great information but no concrete ideas. I love that I am going back with ideas I will implement right away this fall. – Janet Sundquist, Academic Advisor/Program Coordinator, Minnesota State University Moorhead, MN\n\nThis workshop has been perfect for me as a brand new teacher! My toolbox is full, I’ve had a great time meeting my new colleagues, and my vision for the classroom has taken new shapes. I loved how the concepts we discussed using in our classrooms were modeled in the workshop. – Lori Eby, Faculty, Developmental Education, Allegany College of Maryland, MD\n\nThis was one of the most influential and informative workshops I have ever been to! I have been reinvigorated and have a new perspective on my approach overall!! – Rob Marchie, Faculty/Program Chair, History, Ocean County College, NJ\n\nI am walking away a changed educator. I have been to many conferences and workshops and have always felt bored or uninterested. That did not happen here. I really liked the hands-on approach. Thanks for all the great insights and strategies. – Danyle Watkins, Coordinator, Early Childhood Education, Lincoln Land Community College, IL\n\nI didn’t think you could exceed the experience of On Course I. However, On Course II built on On Course I in ways that I never could have dreamed of. I experienced another transformation on an even deeper, more personal level. Thank you for the gift of a once-in-a-lifetime experience–again! – Cara Gubbins, Faculty, Biology and Learning Resource Specialist, Butte College, CA\n\nIn my 20+ years of teaching and professional development, there have been few workshops and conferences that have meant much to me personally and professionally. This is one of those few. I regard this workshop as one of those landmarks in my career that may end up being a turning point for how I teach and relate to students. Thank you! – Gregory Cutler, Faculty, Psychology and Education, Bay de Noc College, MI\n\nThis workshop was a wonderful experience for me both as a teacher and a person. It opened my eyes and thoughts in a very different way. – Shyamala Sivalingam, Faculty, Chemistry, Anne Arundel Community College, MD\n\nA colleague told me that this workshop would change my life, and it’s no exaggeration when I say that it has.

My new school year starts tomorrow and I am inspired. – Jennifer Allen, Faculty, Criminal Justice, Davidson County Community College, NC\n\nI won the Minnie Stevens Piper Teaching Award at my college this year (Teacher of the Year). I’m convinced that your On Course I Workshop helped me get there. I’ve always loved teaching, but you gave me some tools that helped me be more than intuitive in my contact with students. I appreciate you more than you know. – Nita Drescher, Faculty, Developmental Reading, Brookhaven College, TX\n\nI am very excited to be able to go back to work tomorrow and implement these new strategies. Thank you for your dedication to improving our students academically but also as a whole person. – Kim O’Brien, Retention Specialist, Jefferson Community College, NY\n\nThese “soft skills” are the engine of all human growth, and so to omit them from our classes is an enormous, costly and dispiriting error, and so I appreciate how grounded these are in theory and practical application. The humanizing approach re-energizes my sense of purpose as an educator. – Edward Dougherty, Corning Community College, NY\n\nI loved On Course I–Introduction of the skills was so valuable. I treasure On Course II for providing the practical structures and strategies to implement those ideas. Every person I’ve spoken to “gets” why we’re here and you are the best designer and facilitator I’ve ever had the privilege to know and observe. You walk the walk–always. – Joan Luebbe, Counselor, Central Florida Community College, FL\n\nI wish all college employees who work with students could participate in this workshop. The applications are endless! Thank you for giving a great workshop! – Kim Sepich, Vice-President, Student Services and Enrollment Services, Davidson County Community College, NC\n\nAll college and university educators should experience this workshop. – Althea Porter, Director, Transitional Studies, Trocaire College, NY\n\nI keep thinking of Walt Whitman who said that he was simmering, simmering, simmering and then Emerson brought him to a boil. Well, I feel the On Course Workshop brought me to a boil — and even way beyond! – Will Shutz, Faculty, English, Northern Virginia Community College, VA\n\nThis is the best conference or workshop experience I have ever had.

Wow! We laughed, had fun, were inspired and grew as people and as educators.” – Nancy Chell, Faculty, Mathematics, Anne Arundel Community College, MD\n\nThis is the best workshop I have ever attended and the one with the most useable tools for every curriculum topic. The ideas are excellent and the materials are well organized and presented well. I especially liked the way the strategies were used to reinforce our learning of the concepts and our ability to retain and actually apply what we learned. – Carla Harrold, Faculty, Economics, Howard College, TX\n\nI went to an On Course I Workshop in Maryland in 2004, and it helped me more as a teacher and a person than any educational conference I ever attended. Skip Downing is the most motivational and creative educator I have ever encountered. He knows how to get us in touch with ourselves and our students in ways that help us all grow as scholars and as persons. – Gloria Bridges, Faculty, Arkansas State University, AR\n\nI have taken hundreds of workshops over my career.

I got what I came for! – Wendy Sera, Faculty, Biology, Houston Community College, TX\n\nOverall, this workshop has impacted my academic life in ways I can not believe. I have the confidence to take a journey of self-discovery and continue to challenge myself, colleagues, and students. Thank you. – Stanton Reed, Faculty, Business/Accounting, Valencia College, FL\n\nThe core of this workshop is so exactly what I/we need–how to facilitate students doing better, students succeeding, retention of students.

Thank you for all the tools you have shared with me. – Diana Pinargotte, Manager, Learning Center, Harford Community College, MD\n\nThis was my second time taking the On Course I Workshop. If faculty [members] ask about taking it more than once, tell them “It is as meaningful the second time as it was the first.” The content was great, the timing was great, the facilitator was fantabulous. I liked all of it! – Denise Dufek, Faculty, Early Childhood Education, Bay de Noc College, MI\n\nThank you!!! Before I came to On Course, I was transitioning into a new job. The inner critic in my mind was constantly telling me that I was in over my head and would fail. On Course not only provided me with the tools and strategies to help my students/cohort achieve new heights, but it also provided me with some peace of mind and strategies to defeat my inner critic. I no longer feel like I’m in survival mode. Thank you! – Jonathan Christian-Hodges, Support Services Coordinator, Northeastern Technical College, SC\n\nGreat job of keeping people involved. Loved the “buffet” of strategies that allow adaption in a multitude of ways. – Timothy Bunch, Student Success Counselor, Wake Technical Community College, NC\n\nThank you for an awesome workshop!

I really enjoyed working in our OCII Design Team to create a practical product. I also found the facilitation tips to be very useful. I will use all of this. The optional evening session was wonderful. It is so inspiring and motivating to be able to get together with other like-minded professionals. It really feeds me. – Leslie Wilson, Director, Learning Services, Chestnut Hill College, PA\n\n[On a scale of 1-10] this workshop is above a 10. What I liked best is how much it engaged me. (I am a bad, bad, student, consistently checking my email, on my phone…but I didn’t in this workshop.) Now I just need to mimic this and get my students as engaged as I was. – Martin McClinton, Vice Provost and Faculty, Chemistry, Brevard Community College, FL\n\nOMG! I can’t imagine any way to improve on this workshop. The content was wonderful, the preparation and organization on target. This has been one of the most powerful experiences of my life both personally and professionally. Thank you! – Carolyn Kirby, Student Services Specialist, Bluefield State College, WV\n\nYou modeled perfectly active, learner-centered strategies with us.

Thank you! – Hwajin Olson, Faculty, ESL, Madison Area Technical College, WI\n\nThis OCII workshop was designed and facilitated perfectly to meet my every need. To the point, on task, minimal distractions, and enough time for play. I will use the design process we learned to redesign my instructional guide to use with new instructors who will be teaching this fall in my program. Thanks, Skip, for becoming a true leader to guide us in this most challenging endeavor of helping students succeed. Gracias! – Ricardo Diaz, Counselor/Coordinator, Chaffey College, CA\n\nI just flat-out enjoyed this workshop! I originally thought it would be helpful, but it went way beyond my expectations. The facilitator absolutely rocked! – Charlie Walling, Faculty, Business Computer Technologies, Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College, NC\n\nGreat tools for teaching. Great tools for personal development. This is the best professional development activity I’ve ever done! – Tom Zimmerman, Faculty, English, Washtenaw Community College, MI\n\nThis workshop was a demonstration of the best teaching I have ever witnessed.

The group bonding created an extremely effective place to share and learn. I am already a better teacher for having been here! – Carole Cayer, Faculty, Nursing, Jacksonville University, FL\n\nThis is my second time taking the On Course I Workshop.

The information is extremely interesting and stimulated great discussions.

I am leaving this workshop energized and more self-aware in my role as an educator. – Nicole Williams, Faculty, Human Services, Anne Arundel Community College, MD\n\nI will definitely be a better teacher because of this workshop. Thank you!! – Lisa Greene, Faculty, Math, Nassau Community College, NY\n\nI can’t wait to get started! Every instructor in our institution should be required to attend this workshop. – Robin Keith, Chairperson, Surgical Technology, Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College, NC\n\nI would not have been as confident or prepared to teach in the fall had I not attended the On Course II Workshop. – Hylie Santos, Counselor, Student Success, Windward Community College, HI\n\nThe variety and number of strategies to use and adapt that were offered so generously was wonderful. [The facilitator] kept us moving, engaged, and interacting with each other throughout the entire workshop. – Jenney Izzo, Director, TRIO Student Support Services, Vermont Community College, VT\n\nThis was a delightful professional development activity that rejuvenated and inspired me. I am chomping at the bit to employ these strategies in all of my courses. What’s more, I’m committed to spreading the good word about On Course throughout our campus. – Daniel Bahner, Faculty and Co-Chair, Professional Development Committee, Crafton Hills College, CA\n\nThis workshop is, without a doubt, the most valuable one I have ever attended in my 15 years as an educator. I am empowered as never before to help my students become better learners and to help myself become a better, more complete, person. – Lori Rawleigh, Faculty, Reading, Germanna Community College, VA\n\nFrankly, this was the best workshop I have attended in a decade or more… if not ever!

Fabulous! – Ross Rueger, Chair and Faculty, Mathematics, College of the Sequoias, CA\n\nI have been to more workshops than I can count in my 35 years in education and [the facilitator] is HANDS DOWN the best I have ever seen!!!

It was the most valuable workshop I’ve ever attended. – Carolyn Barr, Faculty, English, Broward College, FL\n\nI appreciate how you provide the safety for us to really explore the issues that keep us from becoming alive inside! Your gift to create and nourish an experiential environment is awesome. After completing On Course I and On Course II, I’m more focused to push to have an On Course not just as a workshop for my students but also as a class for credit. – Gina Roebuck, Eastern Arizona College, AZ\n\nAll educators should receive this training. If we could get our entire educational system to recognize the benefit and value of empowering students as taught in this workshop, we would have an awesome educational system in America. – Joan Williams, Counselor, University of North Alabama, AL\n\nI am fully motivated to incorporate On Course into my work and personal life. Having now taken both On Course I and On Course II, I think there should be an On Course III. – Timothy Stanfield, Supplemental Instruction Coordinator, William Paterson University, NJ\n\nThis workshop was great. Best ever in terms of practical, useful strategies with a good understanding of why they would work. I have been looking for this content forever. I loved that methods and theory are together.

Now I have the confidence and the tools to become a better instructor for myself and my students. – Darcy Roy, Faculty, Health Science, Eastern Florida State College, FL\n\nI have been given an abundance of techniques/strategies/activities that I can implement to help student succeed to their fullest potential.

I never felt bored. Camaraderie among participants was great, and it was nice that we got to meet almost everyone – Dana Vazzana, Director, Faculty Development and Faculty, Math, Truman State University, MO\n\nI hate going to workshops that are more motivational than applicable. What I loved most was that this workshop was both! My mind is swimming with ideas on what to do next, so I can’t imagine improving the workshop. – Meredith Weber, Assistant Director of the Academic Achievement Center, Seton Hill University, PA\n\nWhat I liked best was how the material is presented and makes you learn in a way I hadn’t known was possible. – Amy Roney, Faculty, Cosmetology, Cowley College, KS\n\nThis workshop was wonderful.

Thanks for being the catalyst for all of this enlightenment and awareness. What you are doing is invaluable for us as educators and our students. – Phil Sienna, Faculty, Health and Physical Education Mission College, CA\n\nI can’t think of anything I would change.

It is a pleasure and a privilege to have been a part of On Course. – Laura Gomez, Professor, Counseling, San Bernardino Valley College, CA\n\nThis was a fantastic workshop.

And off I go ready to rock and roll again! – Gretchen Boose, Retention Coordinator, Northwest State Community College, OH\n\nThanks to you, I’m a changed woman.

The workshop has given me so many jewels which I intend to share with my colleagues and students!! – Maria Parnell, Faculty, Speech and Student Success, Brevard Community College, FL\n\nThis was one of the best experiences I have ever had as an educator.

I expect my students’ learning to improve dramatically. – Wei Li, Faculty, English, Lone Star College–North Harris, TX\n\nAfter taking this workshop, I should take personal responsibility for not being able to sleep last night, but I choose to blame you and this exhilarating workshop where I was brimming with ideas to implement for others, but more importantly and more surprisingly commitment to personal goals I hadn’t realized I desired!! – Lisa Cooper, Faculty, Communications/QEP Director, Nash Community College, NC\n\nI came to this workshop knowing it would be outstanding and you exceeded my expectations!

Kudos! – Aniesha K. Mitchell, Retention Coordinator, Oakland University, MI\n\nHighly interactive. A variety of experiences. I learned some (more!) things about myself (things I need to work on). For that, I’m grateful. The OCII workshop’s phenomenal. – Janet Quinlan, Faculty, Human Development, Sierra College, CA\n\nSkip, you are my hero. You modeled to me the possibilities in front of me.

Thanks for putting me back “On Course” in my own life and professional life. – Barbara Burrows, Academic Achievement Coach, Central New Mexico Community College, NM\n\nExcellent pacing and material.

I have been looking forward to participating in On Course, and it was even better than I expected. I wish everyone could have this experience, so I am sending all of my staff to future On Course Workshops. – Barbara Brodsky, Director, TRIO, Bellevue Community College, WA\n\nThe workshop was a wonderful and empowering experience. I’m excited to utilize the strategies with my students and myself. – Tammy Prater, Faculty, History, Jackson State Community College, TN\n\nThis was a profound experience and by far the most useful workshop I’ve ever attended. By comparison, all other conferences have not even reached the starting gate. – Jill Tress, Learning Skills Specialist, Carlow University, PA\n\nThis workshop really showed me, by example, how to implement learner-centered techniques. I have already been moving away from all lecture math classes and this experience has expanded my choice of strategies 10 fold. – Jacqueline Faris, Faculty, Mathematics, Modesto Junior College, CA\n\nI signed up for this workshop because after more than 20 years of teaching I began to feel burned out and ineffective this year. I felt a real need to inject something new into my teaching to make it fun again for me and my students. I can hardly wait to get back to it now! – Hugh Read, Faculty, Writing, Northern Alberta Institute of Technology, CN\n\nThis was the most relevant, practical, I’ll-use-in-the-real-world workshop I’ve ever attended/participated in. I can’t think of any way the workshop could be improved. – Connie Dearmin, Faculty, Humanities, Brevard Community College, FL\n\nThis workshop is so well thought out.

This is the answer to all our questions regarding the necessary strategies to empower our students, our trainers, and our training managers. This workshop is exactly what the Navy training enterprise needs to ensure we maximize student success-learning and to arm our trainers with the strategies to ensure our students will be successful. It is a must for all at CNL and beyond. I WILL DO WHATEVER I HAVE TO DO TO ENSURE THESE STRATEGIES ARE EMBRACED THROUGH IDC AND THE MTS PROGRAM. I am an On-Course disciple/ambassador and so is everyone else that attended this workshop. It is, without a doubt, the most powerful educational experience we can give our teachers and managers, and, therefore, our students. I may even be understating the passion I feel about this. – H.C. Duke Boutwell, Lead Instructor, Center for Naval Leadership, VA\n\nBest workshop I’ve ever been to!! – Sharon Jacas, Academic Counselor, Fashion Institute of Technology, NY\n\nAfter this workshop, I feel renewed as an educator and that my “tired, wearisome self” has been retired and replaced by an enthusiastic, energetic educator! – Sandra Hays, Faculty, English, Milwaukee Area Technical College, WI\n\nThis workshop has been the most profound educational experience I have ever had. You clearly practice what you preach; then you give us the tools and training to dramatically affect the lives of our students and ourselves. The key factor for me was that you created an atmosphere in which I became personally responsible for my outcomes, something I have tried to do with my own students without success. – Gail Klein, Student Services Coordinator, University of Alaska Southeast, AK\n\nThe OCII concept of empowering students has changed my teaching and my life. I am committed to spreading On Course across the Glendale College campus. – Nancy Phillips, Faculty, Reading, Glendale College, CA\n\nBrilliant! This is stuff I can really use! – Candyee Sweet, Faculty, English, Jackson State Community College, TN\n\nThe presentation modeled the On Course principles at all times. This workshop convinced me experientially that study skills don’t/won’t stick unless soft skills are in place. Thank you for this amazing journey through self-discovery and awareness. Any student I encounter from this point forward will experience a more effective instructor. – Kris Chatas, Chair, Mathematics, Washtenaw Community College, MI\n\nI have not only a tool belt but a whole tool chest full of new strategies/tools to use in the classroom. Theory is great, but I prefer the teaching strategies approach to this workshop. – Amy Christensen, Faculty, Developmental English, Central New Mexico Community College, NM\n\nI feel considerably more committed to my path as a teacher/counselor as a result of your workshop. Thank you. – Will Dowd, Faculty, Career Education Options, Shoreline Community College, WA\n\nI have deep respect, appreciation, and gratitude for all you have taught me in this workshop. The impact is incredible. I had no idea when I signed up that I would take away so much that would directly apply to my students and to me. It far exceeded my expectations. Bless you! – Lisa Marks, Faculty, English, Ozarks Technical Community College, MO\n\nEverything in this workshop makes sense and I can see how it empowers us as teachers striving to be the best for our students’ success. This “On Course” class would benefit any and all students. I’m ready for my new students and their successes! – Charmaine Kuczmarski, Faculty, English Milwaukee Area Technical College, WI\n\nThank you!

I received so many tools, ideas, etc. to take back and use. The facilitation was great. I am excited! – Renee’ Spence, Faculty, Administrative Office Technology, Bainbridge College, GA\n\nWow! Thank you so much. The value of this workshop is greater than anything else I have ever experienced. There is so much value in this workshop it is impossible for me to put into words everything I liked. – Mary Breach, Academic Advisor for Students at Risk, Boise State University, ID\n\nWhat I liked best about the workshop is that we had an opportunity to think about, question, apply, and reflect on the concepts and strategies presented. REAL LEARNING! – Joel Levine, Dean, Languages and Humanities, Southwestern College, CA\n\nI so appreciate this work and the commitment of you, Skip, and the people you bring together. This workshop has given me a new outlook on my higher ed career. – Carole Anne Broad, Advisor, University of Minnesota, MN\n\nThe application of the strategies to teach content was extremely well done.

I have been very inspired and have at least three things to implement immediately. – Bonnie Lasher Kimmel, Assistant Director of Advising for Retention, Completion and New Student Initiatives, Anne Arundel Community College, MD\n\nThanks for all of the ideas ready to be implemented into my classes.

You have helped me find a method to match that commitment. Thanks. – Amiee Stahlman, Faculty, English, University of New Mexico-Valencia, NM\n\nThis was a wonderful OCII experience. I feel revived as an educator and learner. – Michael Murphy, Chair, Developmental Math, Guilford Technical Community College, NC\n\nAfter participating in this workshop, I feel inspired and energized to expand the way I do my work…a refreshing and very useful experience! – Sher Hruska, Vice-President for Academic Affairs, Northwest College, WY\n\nSincerely, this has been the most exciting and relevant experience on the topic of learner-centered strategies to help students improve their capacity to learn! There are literally dozens of strategies that I will incorporate into the 4 “preps” that I teach, as well as application for my counseling practice. I can’t think of how to improve this workshop. I would just like more! Thank you! – Fred Wieck, Counselor Paradise Valley Community College, AZ\n\nThis workshop has been all I anticipated and more; it’s been life changing. – Laura Powell, Faculty, Developmental Reading, Danville Community College, VA\n\nThank you for this life changing experience. – Bill Anderson, SSS Advisor, University of Wyoming, WY\n\nSince first attending one of the summer retreats in 1997, I’ve held nine full On Course staff development trainings for our college, and I plan to offer more.

I am excited and motivated to use On Course in my professional and personal life. – Elizabeth Tucker, Central New Mexico Community College, NM\n\nThis On Course II Workshop was well organized, full of content, excellent examples, and fun…This is where you would hear the cheers and applause of the crowd. Keep doing what you are doing! – Linda Lambert, Faculty, Business, Heartland Community College, IL\n\nThank you! I was a bit skeptical (kind of an “I’ve heard this all before” attitude because of the nature of my role at N.A.I.T.), but I learned new things and developed some great new ideas.

I know that my students and I will benefit from my time here. Thanks!…I had fallen into a state of academic inertia feeling that nothing I tried did any good so I stopped trying new things.

This On Course Workshop has been life-changing, and I highly recommend it for all who wish to make a difference in their own life as well as the lives of others. – Corey Hamby, Faculty, Freshman Year Experience, Cleveland State University, OH\n\nI approached this workshop as wanting to learn “tricks” to use in my classes–but instead I now see the key is not just to make my methodology better–but to address the students’ role, too. This workshop has changed my whole perspective as to what my goals need to be. – Richard Leeper, Faculty, Psychology and Sociology, Rappahannock Community College, VA\n\nI’ve never been to a workshop as well done and meaningful as On Course I and On Course II.

Great job! – Tom Manning, Director, Career Services, Davidson County Community College, NC\n\nI was surprised at how fast the time went, how much information was shared that is usable and applicable.

Awesome experience! – John Bobbs, San Jacinto College, TX\n\nI have been in and conducted many workshops. Yours was THE best I can remember attending…. I applaud your work. – Carol Bader, Chair, Developmental Studies, Middle Tennessee State University, TN and Treasurer, NADE (National Association of Developmental Educators)\n\nThe workshop helped give concrete strategies for me to help students succeed. It took some of the “best of the best” from psychology and motivation and adapted it so that instructors could use it to help students. Great ideas that will help generations of students! – Barb Oakley, Faculty, Engineering, Oakland University, MI\n\nAs a result of this workshop, I am “pumped”! Thank you for your kindness and your positive spirit. It is easy to see that you do this for the betterment of others.

I am leaving empowered with multiple new strategies and tools, as well as some existing ones strengthened or expanded. – Brenda Stotesbery, Faculty, Mathematics, Cuyahoga Community College, OH\n\nThe practical application of the concepts is extremely helpful. I gained useful, specific strategies that are easily incorporated into my work with first-year students (and in my own personal life!). – Wendy Merb-Brown Director, Learning Community Program, Ohio University, OH\n\nI learned great ideas that I truly believe will help my student toward their road of success. This has been a great experience. – Vicki Francis, Faculty, Nursing, College of Lake County, IL\n\nBesides all of the useful strategies that I learned, I experienced a real sense of bonding with my colleagues, a deep sharing of who we are, and a sense of how what we do flows out of who we are. – David Gerkin, Counselor, Glendale Community College, AZ\n\nThis has been time that will be repaid to me and everyone who learns these ideas and strategies. The only way to improve the workshop is to make it longer! – Marsha Frank, Faculty, ABE/GED, South Puget Sound Community College, WA\n\nDr. Downing, you are the exemplary teacher we all aspire to be. Your disposition, comfort with the content, delivery, humor, and candor made this experience the very best.

Not only am I certain that the On Course strategies will help my students, but employing them will also liberate me from a great load of work. Shifting responsibility for learning to the students will free much of the time I spend trying to “fix” their problems after they’ve created them by means of methods that don’t work. – Rick Dollieslager, Chair, English, Thomas Nelson Community College, VA\n\nThank you for providing us with different, positive, energizing and empowering methods to help our students. – Patricia Ramos, Counselor, The Victoria College, TX\n\nThank you so much!

I enjoyed every minute of it, and the students really embraced the course as well. Additionally they all did extremely well with their math and English classes, even having 3 students earn a 4.0 for the semester. This is unheard of for such high risk students! – Tamara Rury, Director of Academic Development, St. Thomas Aquinas College, NY\n\nSuch practical stuff. Stuff I can use! Amen! – Holly Susi, Faculty, English, Community College of Rhode Island, RI\n\nThe overall content was fantastic.

I wish I had found this program years ago! – George Daniel, Director, Student Success Center, University of Tennessee-Martin, TN\n\nThis workshop is energizing.

I feel that a new me has emerged. Thank you for everything. – Betty Baker, Faculty, Adult Education, Altamaha Technical College, GA\n\nI have really, really enjoyed this workshop.

I facilitate an informal professional development seminar called Chalk Talk. I am going to bring a new structure to each seminar and ask faculty to participate in them. – Lana Carter, Chairperson, Social Science and Education, Pueblo Community College, CO\n\nI can’t think of anything to suggest for improvement. You have obviously refined this workshop over the years, and I got far more than I expected as a participant. I am grateful for the experience. – Robert Stuessy, Program Director, New Student Advisement and Orientation Services Midlands Technical College, SC\n\nI am committed to using many of the techniques that I have learned and adapting them to suit my needs and the needs of my students. Overall I thought the workshop was outstanding: practical, personal, professional. I really liked how [the facilitator] made the workshop very interactive with a large number of people….I can definitely say that the benefits of this workshop were worth the cost (of being away from work, family, travel, time, etc.). Kudos! – Allison Lomond, College Counselor, College of the North Atlantic, Doha, Qatar\n\nThis workshop practiced what it preached and empowered the participants.

The sense of community that was formed was great! – Amanda Bohon, Counselor/Faculty, Southwest Virginia Community College, VA\n\nYou’ve shown me how to get away from lecture/lectern to help students learn to think/speak/act and not just listen to my voice.

This workshop was wonderful!! – Joanna Camp, Director, Academic Enhancement Program, University of North Carolina-Greensboro, NC\n\nI have gained useful information that will help me to engage my students. I am walking away with many tools that I can use with my students. Thank you! – Greg Gabehart, Faculty, History, Howard College, TX\n\nUnlike other workshops, we are leaving with concrete tangible plans, scenarios, handouts, data, etc., instead of just leaving with a “good feeling.” It will be easier to implement on our campuses with this tangible evidence of what we experienced. Rather than just an evangelical church meeting or pep rally–we have been enervated but also given a plan. Thanks. – Charlene Stephens, Director, Academic Support, Wesley College, DE\n\nThis workshop was fantastic. I don’t know how it could be improved. – Donna McNatt, Faculty, Mathematics, Cuyahoga Community College, OH\n\nI really enjoyed the On Course I Workshop, but the On Course II Workshop will be even more beneficial.

The knowledge of “how to create new activities” using these tools is wonderful. – Nancy Wolford, Faculty, Psychology and Sociology, Southern State Community College, OH\n\nI highly recommend this workshop not only to all instructors teaching student success skills but to anybody involved in education: instructors, advisers, college administrators, recruiters, etc. I liked the perfect balance of activities and learning, enlightening learning experiences and discoveries every step of the way. It was great! – Larissa Hill, Faculty, English, Glendale Community College, AZ\n\nYou gave us great learner-centered strategies to add to our educator’s toolbox and you showed us how to put the tools into great use.

I would go back to 18 years old just to have you as my instructor. – Jaci DeClue, Academic Advisor, Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville, IL\n\nI liked learning real solutions to difficult obstacles standing between students and their success.

This workshop was everything I had heard and more!! I am excited about using these strategies and using On Course on my campus and in my classes. – Zeporia Smith, Faculty, Education, Montgomery College, MD\n\nThank you for another great learning experience. Your two workshops will not only help my students, but also help me stay on course in my professional and personal life. – Travis Ramage, Academic Advisor, Aurora University, IL\n\nThis is the best workshop I have ever been to, and I will certainly encourage others from our college to attend one! – Subi Rajendra, Coordinator, Learning Lab, Cape Fear Community College, NC\n\nI feel recharged with new strategies that I am excited to try out with some of my more “difficult” students.

I feel like I’ve been given a fresh start. – Emily Gross, Academic Resource Center, Catawba College, NC\n\nI have been teaching the college success course using the On Course text, but have not carried the strategies over to my writing classes. I now have many ideas of ways I can adapt them for writing. The optional night session was a deeply moving experience. I now have a sense of control over a personal situation that has been overwhelming me. – Amanda Periot, Faculty, Developmental English, York Technical College, SC\n\nThis is one of the best workshops I have ever attended! I have never learned so much about myself and ways to help students in such a short time! I was constantly learning and the ideas sometimes came faster than I could write. You are a wonderful facilitator and role model for all of us. I want to attend the On Course II Workshop! – Carmen Etienne, Academic Advisor, Oakland University, MI\n\nThis workshop should be required for all faculty, staff, and administrators. – Lamar McWaine, Student Life Coordinator, San Jacinto College, TX\n\nI am going home with specific things I can do tomorrow in my class.

It is the best workshop I have ever attended. – Sherry Crawford-Eyen, Faculty, Mathematics, Columbus State Community College, OH\n\nI told my Dean that if I took every workshop and conference I had ever attended and rolled them into one it would not equal what I learned and gained from your workshop…. I have never been to a workshop where almost everything I learned I will use. I’m feeling competent and empowered to be a better educator, and I know my students will absolutely benefit from what I have learned here. – Jan Trollinger, Faculty, English, Paine College, GA\n\nI’m walking away with numerous strategies to both implement and adapt in the classroom.

Thank you! I learned so much. I appreciated the creativity, the information was great and I loved the group sharing. – Juli Poe, Clinic Coordinator, Dental Hygiene, Howard College, TX\n\nYou have condensed such important principles into accessible, simple, and deep material.

Although I’ve enjoyed “mountaintop experiences” before, this workshop brought the two parts of my life together, i.e., professional and personal. During the workshop I could see how I can continue to integrate and blend the two AND bring it to a higher – and much more fulfilling level AND involve myself in more meaningful projects at UH Hilo. I’m really excited about that! – Barbara Bostwick, Academic Counselor, University of Hawaii-Hilo, HI\n\nOut of all the conferences I’ve ever attended, nothing even comes close to what you’ve managed to put together!
