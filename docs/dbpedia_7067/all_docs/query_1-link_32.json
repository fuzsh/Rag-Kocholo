This event, hosted by FOUR and École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne, was excellent and very different from the others. It was about building new ideas through conversation and connection across disciplines. We explored the collective responsibility we have as a community to realize the transformative power of AI in service of something precious to each of us and essential for a better world – health. It's clear that no one person, technical solution, or entity is going to be able to bring the opportunity to bear alone. It’s on all of us. Very excited about the conversations we started and look forward to what will come from them going forward. Thank you to the panelists and our attendees - it was a pleasure to moderate this fascinating discussion. Big thanks to Presence Switzerland and #SwissHouse who provided a fantastic venue!

If you are developing, designing and/or applying data science and AI methods in the healthcare and biomedical space, no matter your job title: we would love to hear from you! 🔗 : bumblekite.co/survey This work has been developed through hundreds of conversations with leaders from 40+ organisations encompassing 40+ countries, 1,000+ hospitals and tens of thousands of people like yourself. Most recently, the plenary session at the VA's Int. Summit for AI in Health Care, where we introduced this work, was the most viewed session of the Summit! Join us! 💙 🎨 : Francesca Sanna, Tamara Tica\n\nI’m convinced that the digitalization of healthcare systems holds immense promise for securing healthcare, enhancing its sustainability, and bolstering its resilience against future crises. Within this transformative landscape, artificial intelligence plays a pivotal role in overcoming global challenges like the skilled-worker shortage. The question is no longer whether artificial intelligence should be integrated into healthcare, but rather how we can harness this game-changing technology to deliver the best possible patient care. Automation in clinical routines fosters the efficient and effective utilization of existing resources, enabling clinics and their specialists to focus on patient-centered care and execute precise treatments amidst an increasingly complex environment. However, realizing the full potential of precision medicine hinges on the prevailing framework conditions in our societies. Access to structured, high-quality health data is a key factor for research and development at companies like Siemens Healthineers. We need a regulated framework for accessing and sharing structured, high-quality health data in order to propel the digital transformation of healthcare and medicine. I’m truly privileged to have been a part of this interdisciplinary dialog on the future of healthcare alongside such a distinguished audience and insightful panelists. Thank you for this inspiring exchange, Ran Balicer, Alena Buyx, Barbara Frenz, Jeanne Kehren, Heyo Kroemer, Karl Lauterbach, Heike Schmoll, and Achim Wambach. #ArtificialIntelligence #Healthcare #Innovation"
