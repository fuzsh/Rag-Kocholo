        "text": "<div class=\"IPBDescription\">Noble or completely biased?</div> Every year the Nobel prize is awarded to people who are said to have made revolutionary discoveries or progress in medicine, literature, physics, chemistry, peace and economics.\n\nIt is maybe one of the most respected international prizes.\n\nStill, there have been a lot of questionable decisions of the Nobel Prize committee.\n\nLook, for example, on the case of Lise Meitner. She has made significant contributions to the discovery of Uranium-fission together with Otto Hahn and she was the one to explain the proccess in an adequate way. Yet, Hahn and Fritz Strassman were awarded (for that particuliar work) but she wasn't. Clearly a wrong decision...\n\nAnother example is the awarding of Boris Pasternak. He was a Soviet dissident writer and gained popularity (in the West) with to his book \"Dr. Zhivago\". I have read this book and in my view there is absolutely nothing special about it. There have been a lot of other Soviet writers who were much better, yet they were not awarded as they weren't dissidents. Many critics also disliked Pasternak's work. So was the Nobel prize only a political instrument during the Cold War?\n\nFurthermore, the case of Henry Kissinger is very striking. Maybe it was fools day when they awarded him the Nobel Prize for peace or maybe they were just pouring scorn on world politics. He was responsible for the US attacks at Cambodia thus for the widening of the Vietnam war and hundreds of millions of civilian casualties. He was responsible for the assassination of the Chilenian general Schneider and thus helped dictator Pinochet to become dictator. He gave the permission for Indonesia to attack East-Timour.\n\nYet, he was awarded with the Nobel Prize for Peace.\n\nSo, do you think the Nobel prize is a respectable award or is its value far too exaggerated?"
