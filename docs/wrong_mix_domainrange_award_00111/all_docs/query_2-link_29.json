        "text": "(CNN) -- The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Before the announcement was made, CNN's Hala Gorani asked viewers who they thought should be honoured. Have your say by sending an e-mail to hala@cnn.com.\n\nJacques Chirac -- for focusing on the legitimacy of the process of launching an attack on Iraq. Patrick Thomas, New York City, U.S.\n\nFormer and late President Richard M. Nixon, for opening America and the world to China, for being the US President who has done the most to restore justice to the Native Americans and for having built the basis of the dissolution of communism and Soviet Union. Michel R. Delville, Brussels, Belgium.\n\nFor his brave struggle through so many years for human rights, for his being punished and incarcerated for years for this struggle, and for being the light of freedom and justice to all those living under communism, Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. David Broderick, Zurich, Switzerland\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize must go to Ranil Wickremesinghe, prime minister of Sri Lanka, because of his decision to lift the ban on Tamil Tiger rebels to allow successful first round peace talks. Mohankumar Kumar\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded to all the men and women who risk their lives every day for the United Nations. Alain, Lahr, Germany\n\nI would support Jimmy Carter for the prize. I definitely don't want George W. Bush even getting a nomination -- that would be the end of any respect for Nobel laureates. Gopi Rao\n\nThe Norwegian prime minister, for that country's work towards getting a ceasefire and a possible peace in Sri Lanka between the government and the Tamil Tigers rebels. Graham Duggan, Auckland, New Zealand\n\nNobody should be given the Nobel prize other than Rudolph Giuliani, former mayor of New York, for his heroic tackling of the 9/11 attack. Isaac Kiplagat, Nairobi, Kenya\n\nScott Ritter, the one person who knows the truth and hasn't been afraid to try to stop a needless war. Bob Eastman\n\nNo one deserves the Nobel Peace Prize more than ex-President Bill Clinton. This man worked more for peace in the world than any other leader of any country in living memory. Paul Michael, Lebanon\n\nAbdul Sattar Edhi, a leading social worker of southeast Asia, deserves the coveted prize for more than two decades of continuous work for the poor. Azra Saeed Qureshi, Karachi, Pakistan\n\nEx-President Jimmy Carter for trying to improve relations between Cuba and the U.S. But not President Bush. Joanne Joyce\n\nHamid Karzai, because he has given \"life\" to the millions of Afghans from the previous inhuman-regime of the Taliban. A. A. A. Syed, Bangladesh\n\nThe Zimbabwean farmers should get the Nobel Peace Prize because if it was not for them keeping their cool there would have been a huge civil war. Porge Williams, Zimbabwe\n\nWith the exception of Tony Blair, President Bush is the only world leader who is ready to do what it takes to secure peace in the world. Gregory P. Lewry, Calgary, Alberta, Canada\n\nThe president of Kenya, H.E. Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi. He has maintained peace in his own country and also in the neighbouring countries like Somali, Ethiopia and Sudan. Kenneth K. Kirui, Nairboi, Kenya\n\nThe late King Hussein of Jordan. If he was still alive, the situation would not have escalated to this. ZK - Montana, Switzerland\n\nGeorge W. Bush... he gave a kind of new hope for the people of Afghanistan. Bachir El Ters\n\nI gave a piece of my childhood to my parents, I gave a piece of my youth to time spent in educational institutions, I gave a piece of my life to serving our country, I have dedicated a piece of my life to my family, I give a piece of my income to the government, I spend a piece of each day watching CNN. I think I should get a piece of the peace prize. Viv Pke, Port Elizabeth, South Africa"
