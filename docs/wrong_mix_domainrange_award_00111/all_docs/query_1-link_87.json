        "text": "James Earl Carter, Jr. last week became the oldest former president in U.S. history. He left office 38 years ago; since 2012, he’s held the record for the longest post-presidency.\n\nCarter is a speed reader who, as president, clocked 2,000-plus words per minute. He’s brilliant and enigmatic; yet, down to earth and personable. He was the first president born in a hospital, and the first from the deep South since 1848. He’s the only president to have lived in public housing before becoming chief executive, and he took an unheard-of path to his first presidential nomination. Just 11 months before he ousted President Gerald Ford, polls showed fewer than one American in 20 even knew his name.\n\nHe’s the only president to begin his inaugural address by graciously honoring his vanquished opponent. Since leaving office, he’s regularly taught Sunday school and lectured at universities.\n\nIn his 1962 race for the Georgia Senate, he was cheated. Squaring off against organized, ballot-stuffing segregationists, he hired lawyers and reversed the outcome. In 2002, he became the first U.S. president since 1919 to win the Nobel Peace Prize. He’s written more books (30) than any other president; many are best sellers still in print.\n\nWhile standing watch on a submarine in 1947, Lt. Carter nearly drowned. Engulfed by a huge wave that carried him 200-plus feet aft, he survived only by clinging to the sub’s machine guns.\n\nCarter, in person, is gracious, charming and funny. In 1993, I chatted with him in a hotel lobby in Washington, D.C., after his Secret Service agents — who had remembered me from President Reagan’s White House staff — signaled the go-ahead. The 39th president was engagingly quick-witted. I commended him for befriending ex-Presidents Bush, Ford and Nixon. Flashing his famous grin, he replied, “We all were involuntarily retired and we all ran against Ronald Reagan!”\n\nHe mentioned the $3 million that Reagan had earned for giving two speeches in Tokyo. “Please tell your old boss,” Carter joked, “that I’ll gladly substitute for him at that rate if he’d rather chop wood at his ranch!”\n\nCarter looked fit, because he was ahead of his time. Decades before preventive health practices were common, he jogged, practiced yoga, ate health foods and used natural remedies. His parents and siblings all died of cancer; being at risk, he prolonged his life. An avid tennis player while president, Carter’s regimen of strenuous exercise included running up and down stairs in little-used sections of the White House. He played softball, square-danced and cross-country skied at Camp David.\n\nAs an ambitious 13-year-old, Jimmy Carter wanted to attend the U.S. Naval Academy. Learning that flat feet could mean rejection, he spent hours each day for three years rolling soda bottles under his feet to build up his arches. As a plebe, an anti-Southern Annapolis upperclassman hazed him. The senior demanded Carter sing \"Marching through Georgia\" – a tune about General Sherman’s rampage through Carter’s home state, when Union troops burned Atlanta. Carter flat-out refused, even after a vicious beatdown.\n\nPerseverance, determination and fortitude are lifelong Carter attributes, as are faith, compassion, and empathy. He’s also the only Democratic president to have been a successful businessman. Habitat for Humanity and the Carter Center wouldn’t exist absent his diligence. As governor, he hired a repentant convicted murderer named Mary Prince to be his daughter’s nanny. She later worked in the White House, but had to see a parole officer. President Carter filled that role.\n\nThe milestone that this dedicated, hardworking, God-fearing, energetic, incredibly intelligent man achieved on March 22, 2019, is merely the latest in his truly amazing life.\n\nTodd Blodgett of Clear Lake served on President Reagan’s White House staff and on the 1988 campaign staff of President George H.W. Bush. He also worked for the Republican National Committee and the FBI. He can be reached via his website, www.ToddBlodgett.US."
