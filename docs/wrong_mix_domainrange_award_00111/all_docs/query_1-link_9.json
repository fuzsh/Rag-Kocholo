        "text": "Former US president Jimmy Carter was today given the Nobel Peace Prize for his \"untiring efforts\" over decades to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts and to advance democracy and human rights.\n\nBut in awarding the prize to the 78-year-old statesman, the Norwegian Nobel committee chairman launched a clear attack on the current US president's threats to use force against Iraq.\n\n\"[The award] should be interpreted as a criticism of the line that the current administration has taken,\" Gunnar Berge, the chairman of the Nobel committee, said.\n\n\"It's a kick in the leg to all who follow the same line as the United States.\"\n\nThe committee's citation contrasted Mr Carter's success in finding Middle East peace between Egypt and Israel through diplomacy with the US's current stance on Iraq.\n\n\"In a situation currently marked by threats of the use of power, Carter has stood by the principles that conflicts must as far as possible be resolved through mediation and international cooperation based on international law, respect for human rights, and economic development,\" the citation said.\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel committee cited Carter's \"vital contribution\" to the 1978 Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt, his efforts in conflict resolution on several continents and the promotion of human rights after his presidency.\n\nThe award is worth 10m Swedish kronor (Â£700,000). Other members of the Nobel committee later distanced themselves from Mr Berge's direct criticism of President Bush, saying that it had not been part of the discussions leading to the prize.\n\n\"In the committee, we didn't discuss what sort of interpretation of the grounds there should be. It wasn't a topic,\" committee member Hanna Kvanmo was quoted as telling the Norwegian news agency NTB.\n\nIn a statement posted on the Carter centre's web site, the 39th president said: \"My concept of human rights has grown to include the rights not only to live in peace but also to adequate health care, shelter, food and to economic opportunity. I hope this award reflects a universal acceptance and even embrace of this broad-based concept of human rights.\"\n\nEarlier, Mr Carter told CNN that when he left the White House he decided to \"capitalise on the influence I had as the former president of the greatest nation of the world\". He refused to comment on Mr Bush's Iraq policy.\n\nMr Carter has said his most significant work has been through the Carter centre, an Atlanta-based think tank and activist policy organisation that he and his wife, Rosalynn, founded in 1982.\n\nPerhaps his crowning achievement as president was the peace treaty he negotiated between the Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and the Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin. Mr Carter worked with them at the Camp David presidential retreat for 13 days in 1978 to reach the accord.\n\nThat year Mr Sadat and Mr Begin shared the Nobel Peace Prize. The Nobel committee said Mr Carter, who was in the White House from 1977 to 1981, did not share in the prize because he was not nominated in time.\n\nThe five-member Nobel committee made its decision last week after months of secret deliberations as it sought the right message for a world still dazed by the September 11 terrorist attacks, the war on terrorism that followed and concern about a possible US military strike against Iraq.\n\nThe Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, who was one of this year's nominees, said Mr Carter deserved the award.\n\n\"He had many, many years of work for peace in a very concerted way, in a very human way, and I congratulate him. He deserved it better than I, and he won it, and I'll try for next year,\" he said at his presidential palace in Kabul.\n\nThe Portuguese president, Jorge Sampaio, said the prize was \"a just reward\" and \"wholly deserved\". He singled out Mr Carter's efforts to find a peaceful solution for East Timor, a former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia.\n\nSince losing by a landside to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 election, the former Democrat president has pursued a role on the world stage as a peacemaker and champion of democracy and human rights.\n\nHe helped to defuse growing nuclear tensions in Korea, then narrowly to avert a US invasion of Haiti in 1994, as well as leading conflict mediation and election-monitoring efforts around the world.\n\nLast year's award was shared by the United Nations and its secretary general, Kofi Annan.\n\nThe peace prize announcement capped a week of Nobel prizes after the awards for literature, medicine, physics, chemistry and economics were announced in Sweden's capital, Stockholm.\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel committee received a record 156 nominations - 117 individuals and 39 groups - by the February 1 deadline.\n\nThe list remains secret for 50 years, but those who nominate sometimes announce their choice with known nominees this year including Mr Karzai, President Bush and Tony Blair.\n\nThe prizes were created by the Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in his will and are presented on December 10, the anniversary of his death in 1896."
