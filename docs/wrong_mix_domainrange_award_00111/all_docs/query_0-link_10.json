        "text": "2002 Nobel Prize Winners\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter Wins Peace Prize\n\nListen to Kathy Lohr's profile of former President Jimmy Carter.\n\nThe Awards: Peace | Literature | Chemistry | Economics | Physics | Medicine\n\nOct. 11, 2002 -- Former President Jimmy Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize Friday for his \"untiring\" quest to find peaceful solutions to conflicts around the world.\n\nThe Nobel Committee in Oslo voted unanimously for Carter, citing his mediation between Israel and Egypt that led to the Camp David Accords in 1979. Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin won the Nobel peace prize that year for signing the agreement.\n\nCarter is the first American official to win the peace prize since Henry Kissinger was a joint winner with North Vietnam's Le Duc Tho in 1973.\n\nThe committee also noted Carter's ongoing commitment to human rights and social development. Carter, who heads the the Atlanta-based Carter foundation, has been involved in conflict resolution in Haiti, Cuba, and North Korea. Most recently, the former president expressed opposition to a possible U.S. strike on Iraq without a United Nations mandate. Carter was chosen out of a record 156 nominees.\n\nU.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan won the peace prize last year.\n\nLiterature\n\nHungarian novelist and Auschwitz survivor Imre Kertesz, 72, won the Nobel Literature Prize Thursday for \"writing that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history.\"\n\nKertesz, who is Jewish, was sent to the Nazi death camp Auschwitz in German-occupied Poland in 1944, and then to the Buchenwald concentration camp. He was liberated from there in 1945.\n\nThe Nobel committee singled out his first novel, Fateless (1975), a story about a young man who survives a concentration camp.\n\n\"For him Auschwitz is not an exceptional occurrence,\" the Swedish Academy said. \"It is the ultimate truth about human degradation in modern experience.\"\n\nListen to Rick Karr's report on the literature prize.\n\nChemistry\n\nThree chemists have won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for research that has led to a better understanding of the molecules essential for life. Working independently, the three chemists were able to modify existing methods commonly used in chemical analysis so they could be applied to molecules that biologists were interested in. NPR's Joe Palca reports.\n\nProteins are the molecules that do work inside cells, so its essential that proteins work properly to maintain a healthy life. This year's chemistry Nobel recognizes two separate methods of understanding large molecules like proteins.\n\nAmerican John Fenn, 85, of Virginia Commonwealth University and Koichi Tanaka, 43, of Shimadzu Corp. in Japan, developed ways of adapting a technique called mass spectrometry to the study weight of proteins. Swiss chemist Kurt Wuethrich, 64, of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology found a way to apply nuclear magnetic resonance imaging so that it could be used to investigate the shape of proteins. Their breakthroughs have revolutionized the search for new medicines, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said.\n\nListen to Joe Palca's report on the chemistry prize.\n\nEconomics\n\nTwo Americans win the economics prize for pioneering the use of psychological and experimental economics in decision-making. The Nobel committee is honoring Daniel Kahneman, 68, of Princeton University primarily for his establishment of theory involving how human decisions can at times vary from or be at odds with established economic theory.\n\nVernon Smith, 75, of Virginia's George Mason University, was awarded half of the prize for laying the foundation for a field of experimental economics that looks at auction markets, and for his experiments with how deregulated markets might work in the real world.\n\nBoth men were cited as innovators by the committee for bringing together the fields of psychological and experimental economics.\n\nListen to Vernon Smith talk about the economics prize.\n\nPhysics\n\nThis year's Nobel Prize in physics is awarded to three scientists for their contributions to astrophysics. American Raymond Davis Jr. and Japan's Masatoshi Koshiba will split half the prize; the other half goes to American Riccardo Giacconi. NPR's David Kestenbaum reports.\n\nDavis, 87, of the University of Pennsylvania, and Koshiba, 76, of the University of Tokyo, won for their work with elusive subatomic particles called neutrinos. Trillions pass through Earth each second, undetected and disturbing nothing. Davis stubbornly tried to detect neutrinos coming from the sun by using a giant tank of liquid buried in a mine. He succeeded, and confirmed that fusion powered the sun. Neutrinos are created during that same process.\n\nMasatoshi Koshiba led a more recent neutrino experiment in Japan. It detected neutrinos from even farther away -- a distant star exploding in a supernova.\n\nRiccardo Giacconi, 71, of the Associated Universities in Washington, D.C., won the other half of the Nobel Prize for his work with cosmic X-rays. He built the first X-ray telescope and discovered strange sources of X-rays in the universe. Physicists now think those sources are black holes.\n\nListen to David Kestenbaum's report on the physics prize.\n\nMedicine\n\nAn American and two British biologists won the Nobel Prize in medicine for their discoveries about how genes control cell development and death. NPR's Richard Harris reports.\n\nAmerican Robert Horvitz and Britons Sydney Brenner and John Sulston will share the $1 million award. They worked independently to piece together one of the central questions of life: how genes control the development and ultimately the death of living cells.\n\nBrenner, founder of the Molecular Sciences Institute in Berkeley, Calif., discovered that the simple structure of a primitive roundworm made it ideal for genetic research. The tiny worm, C. elegans, has only 959 cells in its body.\n\nSulston, of the Sanger Centre at England's Cambridge University, uncovered how genes control the growth and death of cells in that worm to make its primitive nervous system.\n\nAnd Horvitz, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, discovered two genes that trigger deliberate cell death. Cell death turns out to be critical for healthy life -- old cells must die to make room for vigorous new cells. Organs such as the human brain take shape in part because of genetically programmed cell death.\n\nListen to Richard Harris' report on the medicine prize."
