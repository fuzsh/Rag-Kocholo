        "text": "Jimmy Carter is best known as the thirty-ninth president of the United States, but he continued a life of public service for four decades after he was denied a second term in 1980.\n\nThe US Naval Academy graduate, peanut farmer, businessman, and former Georgia governor was elected president in 1976. His administration had numerous accomplishments, including the Panama Canal Treaties, the Camp David Accords, and a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. Domestic issues such as inflation and an energy crisis marred his time in office. But the most serious problem was the Iran Hostage Crisis in November 1979, when a mob occupied the US embassy in Iran and took the diplomatic staff hostage. Despite the efforts of the Carter administration, the hostages were not released until January 21, 1981—the day Ronald Reagan became president after defeating Carter in the 1980 election.\n\nAfter leaving office, Carter founded the Carter Center, an organization devoted to advancing human rights. Through the center he engaged in conflict mediation in countries around the world. He became University Distinguished Professor at Emory University, wrote books, taught Sunday School, and with his wife, Rosalynn, built homes for low-income people as a Habitat for Humanity volunteer. In 2002, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for “for undertaking peace negotiations, campaigning for human rights, and working for social welfare.”\n\nIn February 2023, at age 98, Carter announced that he had entered hospice care in his hometown of Plains, Georgia.\n\nThis minibibliography lists books by and about Jimmy Carter.
