Focal's quest is to enhance listening experiences and restore the authenticity of artists' work. Every day, we push back the boundaries of musical reproduction, going beyond the traditional approach and approaching it differently. With Focal, purity of sound and emotion are one and the same.

THE FOCAL COLLECTIONS

Blending performance and design, Focal collections awaken emotions everywhere: at home with acoustic speakers, integrated speakers, outdoor speakers, Home Cinema systems, open-back headphones; on the move with car kits; on the road with closed-back headphones and wireless headphones with active noise reduction; in the studio with monitors for professionals; at sea with solutions for boats and yachts.

Focal's ambition is to make every moment of listening a privileged moment, where music, voices and dialogues are respected and emotions come alive. For us, innovation and tradition combine to enhance hi-fi performance and the beauty of sound. Our wish is to open the way to a new world of sensations, pure pleasure.

We are proud to manufacture our top-of-the-range products in our production (Saint-Etienne) and cabinet-making (Bourbon-Lancy) workshops in France, to register innovative patents, and to train our teams in rare and specific techniques. Every day, we honor this heritage, which has earned us worldwide recognition as one of France's Entreprises du Patrimoine Vivant (EPV).

It is by thinking together in terms of loudspeakers and speakers, by adapting our ranges to customer requirements, and by claiming a sound signature that reconciles musicality and dynamics, that Focal evolves on the world audio market and contributes to the image of French luxury.
