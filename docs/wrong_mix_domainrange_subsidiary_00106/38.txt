5. Disclosing Personal Data

We may transfer, process and store Personal Data we collect through the Services in centralized databases and with service providers located in the U.S. The U.S. may not have the same data protection framework as the country from which you may be using the Services. For the sake of clarity, Focal will comply with GDPR requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information from Europe to the U.S. Also, we may transfer your data to the U.S., the EEA, or other countries or regions deemed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection of personal data in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service.

6. Data Retention

We only retain the Personal Data collected from a User for as long as the account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfil the (business) purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law.

You can revoke Focal's access to your data by Logging out in the Youtube Export modal in the Focal App, revoke Focalâs access to your data via the Google security settings page. Using third party-products or integrating with third party applications could involve importing data from that third party to Focal and/or exporting data from Focal to that third party. If this requires connecting your Focal account to your account on the third party application, you will be asked for permission.

These third-party products are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information. You should review the terms and conditions of any third party apps before connecting them to the Service.
