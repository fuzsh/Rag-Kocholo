Web Browser Cookies\n\nBased on your consent, the Website may use cookies to enhance the user experience. User's web browser places cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them. Users may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If they do so, note that some parts of the Website may not function properly.\n\n3. Use of Data\n\nFocal uses the Personal Data for the following purposes:\n\nTo performance of the service/agreement;\n\nTo optimize system operation based on usage and enable future product development and improvements;\n\nTo analyse system usage to help maintain the operational system\n\nTo enable you to access customer support portals or to provide customer support services to you\n\nTo optimize system operation based on usage and enable future product development and improvements\n\nTo enable our compliance with export control and other laws and regulations\n\nTo improve customer service;\n\nTo inform users about our services (marketing);\n\nTo improve our Website;\n\nWe may use the feedback you provide to improve our products and services; and/or\n\nTo send emails.\n\n4. Data Security\n\nFocal follows generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Data in our possession. This includes, for example, firewalls, password protection and other access and authentication controls. We use SSL technology to encrypt data during transmission through the public internet.\n\nHowever, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is completely secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the service, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If you believe your Personal Data has been compromised, please contact us as set forth in the end of this Policy.\n\n5. Disclosing Personal Data\n\nWe may transfer, process and store Personal Data we collect through the Services in centralized databases and with service providers located in the U.S. The U.S. may not have the same data protection framework as the country from which you may be using the Services. For the sake of clarity, Focal will comply with GDPR requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information from Europe to the U.S. Also, we may transfer your data to the U.S., the EEA, or other countries or regions deemed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection of personal data in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service.\n\n6. Data Retention\n\nWe only retain the Personal Data collected from a User for as long as the account is active or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfil the (business) purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. All contents of closed accounts are deleted within six (6) months of the date of closure.\n\n7. Third-Party Services\n\nThe Service may contain features or links to websites and services provided by third parties.

We encourage you to learn about third parties' privacy and security policies before providing them with information.\n\n7.1 Sharing with other third parties\n\nIf you choose to work with third-party integrations in Focal (e.g., media exports to YouTube, an application that uses the YouTube API Services and users agree to be bound by the YouTube Terms of Service and Google Privacy Policy). You can revoke Focal's access to your data by Logging out in the Youtube Export modal in the Focal App, revoke Focalâs access to your data via the Google security settings page. Using third party-products or integrating with third party applications could involve importing data from that third party to Focal and/or exporting data from Focal to that third party. If this requires connecting your Focal account to your account on the third party application, you will be asked for permission.\n\nThese third-party products are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information. You should review the terms and conditions of any third party apps before connecting them to the Service.\n\n8. Access, Correction, Deletion\n\nFocal respects your privacy rights and provides you with reasonable access to the Personal Data that you may have provided through your use of the services. If you wish to access, amend, update, correct, or delete any Personal Data we hold about you, or transfer any information about you that we have obtained, you may contact us as set forth at the end of this Policy.\n\nAt any time, you may object to the processing of your Personal Data, on legitimate grounds, except if otherwise permitted by applicable law. If you believe your right to privacy granted by applicable data protection laws has been infringed upon, please contact us as set forth in the end of this Policy and our Data Protection Officer will contact you. You also have a right to lodge a complaint with data protection authorities.\n\n9. Changes to this Policy\n\nFocal has the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page.
