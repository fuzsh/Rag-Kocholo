YOUR RIGHTS AND OUR OBLIGATIONS\n\nConsent:\n\nWe will generally process personal data on the basis of having specific consent to do so for that specific purpose. If we require your consent, we will explicitly ask for such consent at the time of collecting your personal data.\n\nHowever, we may also process your personal information if we are able to do so without explicit consent under the Act and/or Regulation. For example, we may be able to legally control and process your personal information without your consent if it is necessary in order for us to provide the service you have asked to, or if we have a legitimate interest in doing so, or if doing so is in the public interest.\n\nWe may also process your personal information without your consent if we have a legitimate interest in doing so, for example, for some internal administrative purposes, or for the purpose of ensuring electronic information security.\n\nIf we are controlling and processing your personal information on the sole basis of having your consent to do so, we must gain separate consents from you in respect of each distinct processing operation.\n\nWhere we are processing your personal information on the basis of you having given us your consent to do so, you do have the right to withdraw that consent at any time, but this will not affect the lawfulness of processing prior to the withdrawal of such consent. You can exercise your right to withdraw consent to processing at any time by contacting us via [email protected].\n\nRectification and Erasure:\n\nYou benefit from the right to rectify inaccurate personal information we hold which relates to you (also known as the “right to rectification”). This means that, taking into account the subject of the processing, you shall have the right to have incomplete personal information completed. You can exercise your right to rectification by contacting us via [email protected].\n\nYou also benefit from the right to erasure (also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’). This means that you have the right to request us to erase personal information we hold about you, and that we should erase such data without undue delay, provided that you are able to demonstrate one of the following to us:\n\n(a) that our processing of the personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected;\n\n(b) that you withdraw your consent to the processing and there is no other legal ground for us to continue to process the data;\n\n(c) that you object to the processing under regulation 21 of the Regulation and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for processing;\n\n(d) that the personal information must be erased in order to comply with a national legal obligation; or\n\n(e) the personal information in question belongs to a child under the age of 16 and no consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.\n\nData Portability:\n\nYou also have the right to receive the personal information concerning you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You have the right to transmit such data to other data controllers without hindrance from us where we are processing that data on the basis of having your consent to do so, or where it is necessary for the performance of a contract, and the processing is carried out by automated means.\n\nSubject Access Requests:\n\nYou as a data subject are entitled to make a formal request for information we hold about you. We must provide you with a copy of this information, the reasons it is being processed and whether it will be given to any other organisations or people provided that you make this request in writing.\n\n6. SHARING AND TRANSFERRING PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nWe use industry standard encryption for transmission of data to our systems. Although we cannot guarantee the absolute safety of transmission of data via the internet, we adhere to the highest standards to give your data the strongest protection possible.\n\nSharing of Personal information:\n\nWe may share personal information we hold with any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.\n\nWe may also disclose personal information we hold to third parties, with your consent, or on the basis of us an otherwise lawful reason for doing so under the Act and/or Regulation.:\n\n(a) in order to facilitate, provide and improve the products and services we provide to you through our Platform;\n\n(b) in order to analyse the manner in which our services are used by services and product users;\n\n(c) in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose personal information we hold to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;\n\n(d) if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal information we hold will be one of the transferred assets; and\n\n(e) if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply any contract with the data subject or other agreements; or to protect our rights, property, or safety of our employees, customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.\n\nTransfers outside the EEA:\n\nWe may transfer any personal information we hold to a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA), provided that one of the following conditions applies:\n\n(a) the country to which the personal information is transferred ensures an adequate level of protection for the data subjects' rights and freedoms;\n\n(b) you have given your consent;\n\n(c) the transfer is necessary for one of the reasons set out in the Act and/or Regulation, including the protection of your vital interests;\n\n(d) the transfer is legally required on important public interest grounds or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or\n\n(e) the transfer is authorised by the relevant data protection authority where we have adduced adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of the data subjects' privacy, their fundamental rights and freedoms, and the exercise of their rights.\n\nPersonal information we hold may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. That staff may be engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services.\n\n7. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY\n\nWe reserve the right to change this policy at any time. Where appropriate, we will notify you, as a data subject, of those changes by email.\n\nWe recommend that you also regularly review this privacy policy for any changes.\n\n8. CONCERNS OR COMPLAINTS\n\nIf you have any concerns or complaints relating to this policy, its subject matter, or the manner in which we collect, control and/or process your personal information, please do let us know by sending an email to [email protected]."
