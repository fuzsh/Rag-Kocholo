        "text": "Identify your Goals\n\nBefore you get started working with a coach, take time to reflect on your objectives for the coaching engagement. Being clear on your goals will help you determine the best program for you.\n\nFind the Right Coach\n\nThe relationship you develop with your coach will be critical to your success, so take time to explore this relationship. Not every coach is the right fit for the client, and not every client is the right fit for the coach. This is a partnership and to achieve success both parties must be in synch!\n\nAt Focal Pointe we take time to understand more about you, your goals, and your communication preferences while sharing a bit about our background, coaching style and approach. This is typically done over a preliminary phone call or two, and is at no charge. In this time you will have the opportunity to experience first-hand, what an engagement would look and feel like. Simultaneously, the coach will be able to authentically assess if s/he is the best fit to meet your needs. Remember, in coaching, the relationship is about following your agenda – our success is measured on yours! So these preliminary calls are expected and welcomed and serve a mutual benefit to ensure a great fit and a pathway towards the success you desire.\n\nChoose a Program\n\nYou know your initial goals, you have found your coach, now it is time to move to action. Each coach offers a variety of services and options. At Focal Pointe we will work with you to determine the best program to meet your needs. There is no “BEST” or “BETTER” program – other than finding exactly the right one for you.\n\nStill Have Questions?\n\nYou know you want something, curious about coaching but unsure; have questions and prefer to ask live rather than read?"
