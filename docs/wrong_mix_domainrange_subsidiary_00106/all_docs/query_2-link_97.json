        "text": "by Deborah Proctor\n\nCorporate photography is an important business tool for Short Elliot Hendrickson, Inc. (SEH®), a multi-disciplinary engineering firm that specializes in building safer roads, bridges, parks, and trails with an eye toward renewable energy and sustainability.As engineering professionals, SEH values corporate photography for its ability to add a human factor to an otherwise technical business. As an ongoing part of their business and marketing strategy they commission corporate headshots of new hires and update existing employee photographs every 2-3 years.\n\nRecently, when the Madison, WI office needed a corporate photographer to update the professional headshots of their employees, they turned to Madison corporate headshot photographer, Clint Thayer, of Focal Flame Photography, because his technical skill balanced with his mastery of design closely matched their own technical design skills.\n\nTransportation planning employee Darren Fortney recommended Focal Flame because of his\"experience with them on the athletic side.\" Because Clint had photographed him at various endurance events, Darren knew that Clint had the technical skills and the ability work quickly that is important to a busy firm. \"They (Focal Flame) set up a mini (corporate photography) studio in a conference room...were friendly and courteous, knew what they were doing, and did not waste staff time,\" he said. All are important traits for a professional corporate photographer; in the business world, time is money.\n\n\"I am not a smiler, but the photographers gave good direction. I got in and out quickly so I could go on with my day,\" project engineer, Dean Stodola, commented.Fortney added with a laugh,\"They got me to smile and it looks like me, so they must have done something right.\"\n\nDarren, Dean, and their project manager Jill Fuhrman were part of a team of engineers, architects, planners, and scientists who were involved in the design and installation of the Cannonball Path bicycle and pedestrian bridge over the Beltline in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nThis was a complicated project, shown here with a photo courtesy of SEH. It needed to address the concerns of key stakeholders: the City of Madison, looking to beautify an abandoned rail corridor and create pedestrian and bicycle access across a busy highway to reach downtown; the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, concerned about how traffic would be affected now and in the future; environmentalists, seeking the preservation of the area's natural resources; and residents or business owners concerned about how the project would affect access to their home or of clients to their business. Additionally, the bridge had to allow crossing the road at a significant skew (angle) while avoiding high voltage power lines traversing the narrow right-of-way.\n\nThe end result included two 180-foot prefabricated steel trusses. The structure addressed all the concerns and brought to life the city's vision of an artful design with minimal impact to a sensitive environmental area.\n\nOne interesting aspect of this project was that the final installation, setting the trusses over the highway, resulted in the total nighttime closure of this major highway (USH12, 14, 18 &151) in both directions. Doing so offered a unique opportunity for workers and SEH engineers to stand in the middle of a 6-lane highway without significant safety concerns. \"It was fantastic to see the number of people that gathered to witness the trusses being placed,\" project manager, Jill Fuhrman, stated. \"It is beneficial for people to understand what goes into enhancing and maintaining our transportation system.\"\n\nStodola spoke for everyone when he said, \"It felt good to be part of a project that turned an abandoned railroad corridor into a attractive means for bicyclists and pedestrians to cross the busy Beltline.\""
