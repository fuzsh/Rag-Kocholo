        "text": "GE Healthcare is known for its medical imaging equipment and diagnostic imaging agents, but has—over the last several years—continued in its digital transformation. The company launched the GE Health Cloud to provide radiologists and other healthcare professionals with a single portal to access enterprise imaging applications to view, process, and easily share images and patient cases.\n\n“Every day, healthcare data flows through millions of medical devices, including more than 500,000 GE Healthcare medical imaging devices globally. Amazon S3 is the cornerstone of our solution, and it gives us the durability and reliability we need for storing critical data.”\n\nMitch Jackson, VP of cloud strategy and technology - GE Healthcare Digital\n\nPomelo is a fintech company that develops digital account and credit card solutions for fintechs and companies in the process of digital transformation, helping them launch and scale financial services in Latin America in an agile and secure way. Pomelo built a data lake on Amazon S3 and used a combination of native features and other AWS services to stay secure, manage access, and help ensure compliance at scale, with analytics-driven cost optimization resulting in substantial savings.\n\n“We needed a data repository that could expand dynamically with virtually no maintenance, connect with other AWS services, and meet all our compliance requirements—Amazon S3 was a perfect match.”\n\nJuan Jose Behrend, Director of Engineering - Pomelo\n\nRyanair switched tape backups to the cloud using AWS Storage Gateway’s Tape Gateway and stored them in Amazon S3 Glacier and Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive for long-term storage. Ryanair eliminated the need for resources for ongoing support and management of physical tapes, and realized 65% savings in backup costs. Ryanair is Europe's largest airline group, flying more than 150 million passengers per year to more than 200 destinations on 2,400 daily flights.\n\nAutodesk is a leader in 3D design, engineering, and entertainment software. Autodesk makes software for people who make things. Autodesk needed to backup 2.4 petabytes of data to Amazon S3 Glacier to reduce on-premises storage costs.\n\nAutodesk decided to use Amazon S3 because of the low cost, pay-as-you-go model, high durability, and availability. It also has lifecycle management capabilities for long-term archival storage to Amazon S3 Glacier or Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive. The goal was to move this dataset to S3 as soon as possible and eventually lifecycle it to Amazon S3 Glacier for long-term retention. This petabyte scale data migration from on-premises to S3 was accomplished swiftly with minimal effort and was completely self-managed with AWS DataSync.\n\nNasdaq is home to over 4000 company listings and the market technology provider to over 100 marketplaces around the globe in 50 countries.\n\nNasdaq has some of its most critical data on Amazon S3 and S3 Glacier and AWS has been a trusted partner for many years. Watch this video to learn how AWS enables Nasdaq to meet their long-term data retention polices, lifecycle management needs for all data types, compliance and security requirements, and scaling demands in a highly-regulated industry.\n\nNielsen is a global measurement and data analytics company, measuring what consumers watch and the advertising they’re exposed to. In 2019, Nielsen migrated its National Television Audience Measurement platform to AWS, and built a cloud-native local television rating application. To do so, the company built a data lake capable of storing 30 petabytes of data in Amazon S3, increasing their scale from measuring 40,000 households to more than 30 million households each day.\n\n\"We drastically increased the amount of data ingested, processed, and reported to our clients each day. Working with AWS and the services they provide allows us to do all of that at a much faster pace, with much greater velocity than we could have ever achieved before.\"\n\nScott Brown, general manager of TV & Audio - Nielsen\n\n3M Health Information Systems needed the agility to develop and deploy new applications faster, and determined that moving to the cloud was the best way to address its challenges of scalability, speed, and security.\n\n3M HIS's applications run on hundreds of Amazon EC2 instance and use Amazon S3 for application data storage.\n\nMyriota was founded to revolutionize the Internet of Things (IoT) by offering disruptively low-cost and long-battery-life global connectivity. Based in Adelaide, Australia, a focal point of the Australian space industry and home of the Australian Space Agency, Myriota has a growing portfolio of more than 20 patents, and support from major Australian and international investors. With deep heritage in telecommunications research, world-first transmission of IoT data direct to nanosatellite was achieved in 2013. Myriota has made this ground-breaking technology commercially available for partners worldwide.\n\nTeespring, an online platform that lets creators turn unique ideas into custom merchandise, experienced rapid business growth, and the company’s data also grew exponentially—to a petabyte—and continued to increase. Like many cloud native companies, Teespring addressed the problem by using AWS, specifically storing data on Amazon S3.\n\nBy using Amazon S3 Glacier and S3 Intelligent-Tiering, Teespring now saves more than 30 percent on its monthly storage costs.\n\n\"Just as Teespring simplified the process for bringing physical products to market, AWS simplified how businesses approach cloud and infrastructure. Because of the services AWS provides and the ease with which we can implement them.\"\n\nJames Brady, Vice President of Engineering - Teespring\n\nPhotobox wanted to get out of the business of owning and maintaining its own IT infrastructure so it could redeploy resources toward innovation in artificial intelligence and other areas to create a better customer experience. Photobox is an online, personalized photo-products company that serves millions of customers each year in over ten markets.\n\nBy migrating from its EMC Isilon and IBM Cleversafe on-premises storage arrays to Amazon S3 using AWS Snowball Edge, Photobox saved a significant amount on costs on storage for its 10 PB of photo storage."
