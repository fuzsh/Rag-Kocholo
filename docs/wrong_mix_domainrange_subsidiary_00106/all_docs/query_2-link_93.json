        "text": "Focal HIFU for Prostate Cancer\n\nFocal treatment strategy for Prostate Cancer (PCa) is playing a growing role in today's surgical practice. By combining the latest imaging and treatment technologies, Focal One® brings the answer to current requirements for ideal focal therapy: accurate and MR-fused imaging, non-invasive approach, precise and efficient therapeutic HIFU energy and treatment validation imaging with post-treatment MRI.\n\nDescription\n\nTreatment\n\nVideo\n\nBrochure\n\nDescription\n\nIdeal image modality at every step of the process\n\nPre-treatment - MRI import and fusion\n\nMR Images import from PACS or CD\n\nElastic fusion to automatically match the 3D contours of the prostate on the MRI and the scanned Ultrasound images\n\nPer-treatment - Precise contouring of zone to be treated\n\nMR target automatically displayed on live ultrasound image,\n\nArea to be treated precisely defined,\n\nLive follow-up of HIFU shots,\n\nTreatment planning adjustable in real time.\n\nOptimal technology combination for ideal focal efficacy\n\nMRI Import and Fusion with real-time ultrasound imaging\n\nPrecise contour definition of target areas\n\nNon-invasive ultimate HIFU technology\n\nPrecise robotic movements\n\nUnique Dynamic Focusing technology\n\nReal-time tracking and adjustment of energy delivered\n\nConfirmation and possible completion of untreated area\n\nQuality of Life preservation\n\nAll treatments remain salvage options\n\nDynamic Focusing Technology\n\nElectronic displacement of the focal point\n\nPrecise treatment of the targeted area\n\nConformational treatment\n\nTreatment\n\nFocal Treatment\n\nThe Focal One® HIFU device is the first medical apparatus designed specifically for the Focal treatment of Prostate Cancer. It has been developed with the last evolutions of HIFU technology and imaging fusion software to answer all the specificities of PCa Focal treatment.\n\nFocal treatment of Prostate Cancer\n\nA Prostate Cancer treatment is considered \"focal\" when a part of the gland is spared. This regroups different strategies, such as nerve sparing, hemiblation, multifocal or single focus targetting (\"Index lesion\")\n\nEvolution of Prostate Cancer treatment\n\nThe management of prostate cancer has evolved in the last 20 years with the increasing number of PCa diagnosed at early non-aggressive stages and the increase of life expectancy of the occidental population. Those PCa diagnosed at an early stage don't need a radical-morbid treatment but a long term control of the disease with preservation of quality of life. The balance between Active Surveillance (no treatment) and overtreatment (radical treatment of cancer at very early stages) could be the Focal therapy.\n\nThe three pillars of a good Focal therapy are:\n\nA precise cancer localization\n\nA precise treatment\n\nProven ablation with post-op IRM\n\nThe advantages of the focal treatment\n\nPrecise treatment of the diagnosed tumor\n\nPreservation of patient's quality of life\n\nPossibility to perform any other treatment if needed\n\nVideo\n\nFocal One Video\n\nLive treatment of prostate cancer with Focal One device. Focal treatment step by step.

For more information, please contact us.\n\nMentions légales à la destination des professionnels de santé français :\n\nFocal One® est indiqué dans le traitement du cancer localisé de la prostate. Focal One® est destiné à la destruction par ultrasons focalisés de haute intensité par voie rectale d’un adénocarcinome localisé de la prostate. Fabriqué par EDAP TMS, Focal One® est un dispositif médical de santé réglementé qui porte, au titre de cette réglementation, le marquage CE. De classe IIb, son évaluation de conformité a été réalisée par le G-MED (0459). Il est conseillé de consulter au préalable le manuel d'utilisation."
