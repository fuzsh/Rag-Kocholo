Sweeney stars as Cecilia, an American nun of devout faith, embarking on a new journey in a remote convent in the picturesque Italian countryside. Cecilia’s warm welcome quickly devolves into a nightmare as it becomes clear her new home harbors a sinister secret and unspeakable horrors.

NEON acquired Michael Mohan’s Immaculate, produced by and starring double Emmy Award®-nominee Sydney Sweeney (“The White Lotus”, “Euphoria,” “Anyone but You”) ahead of its SXSW World Premiere, marking a reunion between Sweeney and Mohan, who helmed 2021’s The Voyeurs with the actress. The film, which features a script by Andrew Lobel, also stars Simona Tabasco (“The White Lotus”), Alvaro Morte (“Money Heist”), Benedetta Porcaroli (“Baby”), and Dora Romano (The Hand of God). Sweeney produced with Jonathan Davino for Fifty-Fifty Films, alongside Middle Child Pictures’ David Bernad, who developed the project with Sweeney following their collaboration on the Emmy-winning “The White Lotus”. Teddy Schwarzman and Michael Heimler produced for Black Bear, which fully financed and represented the international sales rights. Executive producers are Black Bear’s John Friedberg and Christopher Casanova, alongside Will Greenfield.

Immaculate has been called, “darkly beautiful, bloody and bold,” and “one of the best religious horror films in years,” with audiences and critics specifically calling out its “genuinely shocking ending.”
