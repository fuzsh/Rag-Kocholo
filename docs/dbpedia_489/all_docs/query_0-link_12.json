        "text": "Hi,\n\nI just rented a movie on Apple TV for the first time. The movie is in German (although the description was in English). There's no way to change it to another language nor to add subtitles! Can anybody help?\n\nWe're in 2020: everyone (Netflix, Prime...) offers subtitles at least, and usually the option to change language. This specific movie does exist for a fact in other languages. How pathetic and user-unfriendly is this @Apple!\n\nMovies from the iTunes Store may have audio languages and subtitles as provided by the supplying movie studio. Any options would be title specific, and region specific. Apple doesn’t modify what is offered in their Store. You can see for each title what is available for audio and subtitles, before making the purchase, in the movie info page. You can’t add subtitles. You have to choose from what is offered.\n\nSend a message to the movie studio/local distributor, as indicated on the movie info page, about you wish for more language options for their titles in the iTunes Store. Or send a message to Apple/iTunes, then they can forward that message to the studio.\n\nMacBook Pro 13″, OS X 10.10\n\nIf you watch on your notebook in iTunes, verify how to select a different audio language or subtitle track. This part is exactly the same as in the new Apple TV app. Change the subtitles or audio language for the Apple TV app and iTunes Store movies and TV shows - Apple Support. Just look for the Audio & Subtitles menu, with its speech balloon icon."
