        "text": "There are quite a few Mobile movie download sites out there that will have you throwing your phone across the highway in a matter of minutes. Although if you have the right heads up you might keep from committing cellphone-cide prematurely. With so many misleading choices it can be hard to find just exactly what you want. Let me run down the top ten best sites to get those movies you love for your mobile and see if this doesn't help you in your habit of entertainment for free!\n\nPart 1. Top 10 MP4 movie download websites forÂ mobile\n\nPart 2. Record MP4 for free with Wondershare UniConverter\n\nPart 1. Top 10 mobile MP4 movie download websites\n\n1. DIVXWEBCRAWLER\n\nDeveloper: AFS Analytics\n\nThis website is a triple a class download website and has many features available. You can select from software and media to streaming to downloading and VIP material. Also available is a VIP customer registration and brief description of date of release and information about movies.\n\nReviews:\n\nThis has to be the classiest of the list (even with the cheesiest colors scheme) with the most mobility and up to date movies available the format is as up to date as you could ask for the subject material.\n\nGreat use of space and presentation of categories available. You can have your own account with simply getting login on this site. Easy approach makes this site has increased its demand among users. The upfront web design is without bells and whistles but what it lacks in shine it racks in grisly up to date content. This has to be the most up to date of the list and exactly why it's reached our number one spot.\n\n2. Gingle\n\nDeveloper: Gingle\n\nWebsite: http://www.gingle.in\n\nAlso there is Gingle.in Included are many up to date movies and much music. As well as radio feeds and wallpapers. It features an excellent search function. Also it retains ability to view only top downloads which is great if you want the newest of the new. Also you can search the web from its search bar.\n\nReviews:\n\nThis site has chosen to be a little easier on the eyes than the others with its cloudy teal backdrop. Maybe giving the effect of the easy and simplicity that google has come to be known for. Seemingly catering more to its Hindi market, Gingle has mainly any English spoken movie translated and available much for free!\n\nThe one distinguishing note about this particular website is its total lack of registration for content. If you just need a single movie or maybe you're packing for a trip up the Himalayas you will find you can get more than a decent amount of content right here at Gingle.com completely without raggingâ¦..reg..-ing..! Gingle.com just happens to be offering Music, Desktop Wallpapers and Radio now too.\n\nWeb surf its search bar while downloading is a prime feature for mobile users which means no pesky closing of windows while you movie search all can be done within the same domain. There's plenty about of plusses about Gingle.com as a content hub that allowed it to climb to our number 2 spot.\n\n3. KitKatMovies\n\nDeveloper: KitKatMovies\n\nWebsite: http://www.kitkatmovies.com\n\nKitKatmovies.com is a more gui friendly version with big buttons for your Hollywood, Bollywood TV show, and even movie requests. It contains comment sections about each download source to see if links are up or down other than that it is straight-forward. Also a category bar.\n\nReviews: This website, too, has chosen to relax its viewers for as long as it can with a beachfront backdrop.\n\nKitKat movies has a stylized plethora of content to offer for mobile free downloading, including like its predecessors movies in Hindi, Bollywood, movies and also songs but it's also throwing English albums as well.\n\nThe design is laid back and much more upfront. But can we really ask for more? Well it seems we can! With its own ârequest a movieâ feature front and center to allow individuals to make sure they get they're two cents in for movie bidding. All in all maybe without the bells and whistles this website is still delivering without delay and we can say it has got what it takes to round out our top 3 best Mobile MP4 Free movie content providers.\n\n4. WorldFree4u\n\nDeveloper: WorldFree4u\n\nWebsite: http:///www.WorldFree4u.com\n\nMuch like the ones before it, this website is very straight forward but it does categorize its sponsor's into one group which I prefer when I was searching. They have many Translations and movies with subtitles available for many different languages also tags.\n\nReviews:\n\nWith a name like that, you'd be expecting malware up the wazoo, but with the proper precautions this is not a problem and from the looks of it many have come use it as freely as advertised. It won't be as up to date and it won't be as flashy but in its own right it does what it came to do. Offer clients free movies as up to date as possible so that's why they've reached our number two spot. Now, as we move down the list we're going to see much more of that elbow twitching around, but just hold on. We haven't reached the end as this website is still keeping a hand in the ring. Yes there is more advertisement we know but there is also still a promising amount of fresh content and if you're part of the niche of Bollywood movies then this place is as good as any.\n\nPremium content as Free as fast as it can be. A heads up to WorldFree4u.com as we continue down our list. I do have to say that the layout is unique. At the top it seems like you reached some teenager's blog or something but as you scroll you realize this is the place you were looking for.\n\n5. 99HD Films\n\nDeveloper: 99HDfilms\n\nWebsite: http://www.99hdfilms.com\n\nThis website has a unique group of both sides of entertainment split down the middle for easy browsing. You can also select to be directly advertised to or not. Also a Contact us section and a way to post on your timeline for others to get access to the same content.\n\nReviews:\n\nStill firmly attached to your mobile device? We hope so. Or maybe you've already got the content from the list above. If you couldn't find you're desired already we have more for you with 99HDfilms.com. This might have on an off chance something previously missed but much like the others it's split between Bollywood and Hollywood and then also very conveniently a movie calendar to show you the appropriate dates and times.\n\nOne thing you'll love is the visualized likes and views/message visuals. A really nice touch for you if you are a bit on the fence about what to watch. This layout really lets you know just when your favorite series or movie is really hyping at the moment or if a movie is as critically acclaimed it says it is. Never the less I really appreciate that feature in saving time in choosing which content to find for viewing now or later on. Having your hands on the hottest movie before anyone else is always a major opportunity for social maneuvering.\n\n6. HDMoviesMP4\n\nDeveloper: Wapka.mobi\n\nWebsite: http://www.HDMoviesMP4.com\n\nHDMoviesMP4 is a much more toned down website. All materials are mostly available through category selection or through utilizing the search bar. A much slimmed down site to keep your mobile search moving along fast.\n\nReviews:\n\nThis website is much more like a repository than open search type website or hot new material type of webpage. Most of what is available is available on the main screen but if you scroll a small ways you'll easily find that they have a good amount of movies available for download both in Hindi and without. Even some Punjabi and Bengali movies as well as Old is Gold which I'm assuming is the golden oldies of Bollywood or at least I assume so.\n\nNone the less, Age of Ultron is topping its list of featured Movies so it is safe to say this site is up to date and might just have that special thing that you were looking for. I do have to disagree with their choice of web design as the green blue and pink all seem to clash much as does the miss centered Mickey Mouse pointer finger. But to each their own and this might just be your stop.\n\n7. MP4MobileMovies\n\nDeveloper: MP4 Mobile Movies\n\nWebsite: http:///www.MP4mobilemovies.net\n\nMP4mobilemovies has a much like its predecessors the same type of layout available except you can at least guarantee yourself a broader variety here. Including WWE and others. Other than that this website keeps things in suit as a way to speed up your browsing ease.\n\nReviews:\n\nBeing awesome is the name of the Tamil movie for free game and this particular movie website has it in spades. Just be sure not to overlook it in its simplistic layout.\n\nThis might look like another one of those make hulk angry green https, but making use of the search bar you will find out this site does have what you're looking for. Maybe not in the same caliber as the previous websites but as we step away from the prime light area of the top 3 we will see that the content suffers. Not as much as your mood might, though, should you choose to jettison your brand new phone out your car window.\n\n8. FullMoviesFreeDownload\n\nDeveloper: Full Movie Downloads\n\nWebsite: http:///www.fullmoviesfreedownload.com\n\nFullmoviesfreedownload is a bit standout in that it features movies by year and not by direct display other than the niche it's displaying. It has many of the same features as the web pages before it.\n\nReviews:\n\nThis website seems to feature mostly undead movies or psychological thrillers. If you're screws are already not screwed on too tight this might not be the place for youâ¦..but you'll probably think it's perfect! Nevertheless it does feature a broader spectrum of content for your viewing and downloading pleasure (if you do happen to be the type of person who gets pleasure from watching bits and bytes fill up their files).\n\nThis site has a good amount of movies here if not the most up to date or the most helpful it is a leading source of free content. With a bit of poking around you can find that it isn't just a niche site. I do like their choice to go this way to grab a specific type of watcher as all my friends are those people and I know exactly what they were going for. Well done.\n\n9. 3GPMobileMovies\n\nDeveloper: 3GP Mobile Movies\n\n3gpmobilemovies is a picture perfect carbon copy of the standard download website. Also featuring misdirection links such as download a specific browser for speed. None of that is necessary but of course they do offer much material. As before the slime style for speeding through selections.\n\nReviews:\n\nIt would be sort of criminal for me to say that this site has so much more than what has been previously given to you on display and at your disposal. if this website does happen to stand out in its own unique way in that does save you bandwidth if MP4 is just too gripping on your coffers there are 3gp solutions here for your setup.\n\nFinally it seems we have come to the end of our mobile movie hunting adventure, hopefully with all your brand new or favorite content downloaded to memory, ready to relax and enjoy your material. What's that you say? You still haven't gotten the movie, songs, radio broadcast, podcast, documentary!? Well then we have just one last place for you to look.\n\n10. MySuperMovies\n\nDeveloper: MySuperMovies\n\nWebsite: http://mysupermovies.com/\n\nMySuperMovies is the last on our list. Mostly because of the lack of display material and less catered towards box office hits in Hollywood related movies. This may not be an issue though if you are searching for local grassroots movies. Some of the best movies are made this way although all-in-all more of the worst have come to be outside of the main arena of blockbusters. As before, this site is very unengaging and straight laced but has many niches available.\n\nReviews:\n\nThat's it you've reached it. What more is there to say? All categories listed up front and center for you to select and a small search bar in the top left corner. What may help you with your selection is the wide selection of movies from different countries. Seems to be a lot wider selection country-wise than other sites of the same range.\n\nIn my opinion I think some of these websites keep the layout simple so that they will not lose your, oh so precious, traffic with terribly slow loading times especially if their servers are located much farther away from your current location. In summary this site has many different movie selections from many different languages and gets the job done fast. No bad load times. Because of ad-mania overload. Selections and downloadable content.\n\nWell it seems we have reached the end of our top ten lists of mobile MP4 movie downloading websites. As all things that begin must come to an end. I sincerely hope you found this article helpful in your search and that you DID find all the content you were looking for as we all know just how infuriating missing your favorite content can feel. Hopefully this list kept you happy and smiling with loved ones instead of hovelled over some shrubbery searching for your mobile cursing the free movie spirits!\n\nPart2. Record MP4 for free with Wondershare UniConverter\n\nUnfortunately, downloading a movie from the mobile movie download sites above can eat up your vital storage space. What's worse, saving a whole movie file on your computer can take a while. Luckily, you can use Wondershare UniConverter to record MP4 movies on your computer without sacrificing the original quality. It's a simple-to-use program that lets you record high-quality 1080p movies in full-screen mode or choose a specific area to record. After selecting a custom area, you can choose to record the video with a video overlay, voiceovers, and annotations like texts, shapes, and drawings. Finally, UniConverter can export your videos to MP4, AVI, or FLV.\n\nWondershare UniConverter-#1 Computer Screen Recorder\n\nBelow are the steps to record a movie on Mac or Windows with Wondershare Screen Recorder:\n\nStep 1Run the app and launch Screen Recorder.\n\nDownload UniConverter and install it on your PC. After that, run it and then press Screen Recorder. Now click the Screen Recorder tool to launch it. Alternatively, press the Camcorder icon located at the top to run the screen recording function.\n\nStep 2Choose a screen area to record.\n\nNext, open the video you want to record and then drag the recorder's frame inwards or outwards to set the capture region. Another way is setting Full Screen or Custom as your recording mode. Choose Full Screen to record the whole computer screen. But if you're after something more professional, choose Custom and input the video frame dimensions (height and width). Either way, click the Lock Aspect Ratio checkbox to get the best outcome.\n\nStep 3Configure your recording settings.\n\nAfter setting a capture area, it's time to choose a sound output device on System Audio. This will help you record the movie sounds as well as computer sounds like mouse clicks. Now, select a mic on the Microphone section for adding voice narrations before selecting a camera on Webcam for recording a video overlay. Remember, you don't need to capture a video overlay or voice narrations if you're recording a movie.\n\nMeantime, open the Advanced Settings menu and choose the target format. You can set MP4, AVI, or FLV as the output. Thereafter, select the output quality before choosing the frame rate. As expected, Wondershare Screen Recorder also lets you select the folder path and customize the keyboard shortcuts.\n\nStep 4Begin recording your MP4 movie.\n\nLast but not least, preview the capture region before pressing REC to begin recording. Remember to use the 3-second countdown to play your movie. Finally, launch the recording taskbar, where you can click these buttons:\n\nStop- For stopping the recording session once you've captured enough content.\n\nPause- To pause the session and make some adjustments to the movie playback.\n\nWebcam/Microphone/Speaker- For disabling or enabling recording with system sounds, voiceovers, and a video overlay.\n\nCamera - For grabbing top-quality screenshots from your movie.\n\nAnnotation- Click the pencil-like button to record with drawings, shapes, lines, arrows, and texts.\n\nNote: After recording your video, you may want to edit it further by trimming, cropping, merging, converting, and so on. In that case, right-click the video, choose Add, then select a video editing tool to use.\n\nMeta Description: Still looking for the best mobile movie download sites? This article several options.
