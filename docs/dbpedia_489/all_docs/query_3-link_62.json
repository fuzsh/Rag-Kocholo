        "text": "Torrent sites are popular and easy targets for malicious actors to spread infected files. So, despite being hugely helpful for sharing files over P2P, most torrent sites are quite problematic. They can be riddled with malware and tracking cookies, overly aggressive ads, and most of them don't have any preventive measures to screen their files.\n\nThat said, you should seek out reputable sites with no links to malware or less-than-honest tracking practices. Let's not forget about the basics either - you'll want an easy-to-use site filled with high-quality files and with a domain that doesn't change too often. Of course, we're here to point you in the right direction.\n\nIn this guide, we'll give you a list of the best torrent sites in 2024. We'll also talk about how to download torrents, how to stay safe and avoid fake torrents and dangerous sites, as well as why you need to use a VPN. We'll also talk about why some P2P sites are blocked and how to access private libraries, and we'll finish with a round of FAQs.\n\nThe Best Torrent Sites That Still Work in 2024\n\nYour search for the top options should be based on certain criteria. More precisely, you'll want access to a sizable library of P2P files. In that sense, you can go for either all-in-one or specialized P2P libraries (for movies, TV shows, books, software, and so on).\n\nNext, make sure to use popular, long-standing, and reputable sites. That's how you'll access an active P2P community with more seeders than leechers. Remember that you need as many seeders as possible to ensure your downloads are fast. You'll also want advanced search filters to help you pinpoint the file you're looking for.\n\nThe best sites should also be free of malware and overly aggressive ads, like pop-ups with hidden \"close\" buttons. That said, we recommend using an ad blocker, as most P2P sites serve ads, so you'll need help eliminating them.\n\nFollowing the criteria explained above, these are the 15 best-working torrenting websites in 2024:\n\nYTS - Best Torrent Site For HD & 4K Movies\n\n1337X - Best All-In-One Torrent Site in 2024\n\nTorrentz2 - Best Search Engine for Torrent Files\n\nNyaa - Best Torrent Site For Anime Movies & TV Shows\n\nThe Pirate Bay - Best Multi-Purpose Torrent Site\n\nLimeTorrents - Best Semi-Private Torrent Tracker\n\nIGG Games - Best Torrent Site for Freshly Released Games\n\nFitGirl Repacks - Best Torrent Site for Size-Optimized PC Games\n\nIPTorrents - Best Private P2P Tracker\n\nEZTV - Best Torrent Site for Downloading TV Shows\n\nTorrent Downloads - Best Torrent Site for Music & eBooks\n\nTorlock - Best for Downloading Verified Torrents\n\nKATcr - Best Alternative to KickassTorrents\n\niDope - Best Torrent Site for Mac Software & Games\n\nTorrends - Best Search Engine for Verified Torrent Files\n\nJump to Torrent Sites: Movies, TV Shows, Anime, Music, Audiobooks, eBooks, Games, Software, Comics, and Textbooks.\n\n1. YTS - Best Torrent Site For HD & 4K Movies\n\nEveryone in the torrenting game has a soft spot for the folks from YIFY. Unfortunately, YIFY was shut down a while back due to massive legal threats and is, it seems, gone forever. That said, our list of the best-working torrent sites in 2024 begins with a YIFU alternative - called YTS.\n\nYIFY was famous for aggressively optimized video and audio encoding. They achieved some of the best quality-to-size ratios ever seen. YTS is following those same footprints, providing access to countless movies that are nicely organized and often updated. And considering that YTS has millions of active daily users, most of its movies are quick to download.\n\nWe'll also mention that YTS gives you handy search filters. Also, it does contain ads, so you must use an ad blocker. However, you won't encounter malware here, which means any file you get will be 100% safe to open, which has become a rare thing among today's best torrent websites.\n\n2. 1337X - Best All-In-One Torrent Site in 2024\n\n1337X has been around for about a decade now and has somehow managed to avoid being shut down. It wasn't really all that well-known initially, but with the demise of big names such as KickassTorrents and long periods when the Pirate Bay was MIA, there were plenty of opportunities to grow.\n\nToday, 1337X is one of the big boys, with an Alexa rank that puts it among the top P2P sites. We don't like the red and black site design, but that's just a taste issue. From a functionality point of view, the site is sharp as a tack. And most importantly, it allows you to download torrents fast since it has a highly active user base.\n\nYou'll find handy search filtering, and you can always check what's popular and trending. Also, malware should not be an issue, but make sure to use an anti-virus, just in case.\n\n3. Torrentz2 - Best Search Engine for Torrent Files\n\nTorrentz used to be the world's most popular P2P search engine, but it was forced to shut down a couple of years ago. In the meantime, many clones appeared, but it wasn't until Torrent2 that we got a true successor to the original. Torrentz2 is a hugely powerful search engine that's also extremely simple to use, even if you never downloaded a single torrent file before.\n\nTorrentz2 indexes millions of files and allows you to download them without visiting third-party sites. You can also do some basic search filtering. Also, you won't encounter any ads here. Just type in the name of the file you're looking for, and you'll see a sizable list of results. Check those files' details and start downloading.\n\n4. Nyaa - Best Torrent Site For Anime Movies & TV Shows\n\nToday, you'll find English-translated anime via services like Netflix and Hulu. There are even dedicated anime streaming services such as Crunchyroll. Despite this, there are plenty of shows that are just too niche to be officially translated. Some shows are too old, and others will never see the light of day in the West.\n\nThis is precisely where Nyaa comes into play. This site provides a simple and effective interface to its vast database of Japanese animation. If you want to go much deeper than watching Naruto or Dragon Ball Z, Nyaa is the place to be. The website mostly doesn't show any ads, and it's known for offering safe-to-download torrent files.\n\n5. The Pirate Bay - Best Multi-Purpose Torrent Site\n\nWhat can we say about The Pirate Bay? It's been around for as long as we can remember. It's been killed and resurrected more times than we can count. It feels as if TPB is going to be around for the rest of eternity. It's even suffered through having its founders jailed.\n\nThe Pirate Bay is still one of the most popular sites on the Internet. Because of this, you'll find just about any mainstream torrent here. However, the site's design is becoming a little old-fashioned.\n\nAlso, The Pirate Bay has been caught hijacking user CPUs to mine cryptocurrency. The site has been forced into this path as more of its advertising income is cut off. If you're OK with donating a little electricity to support them, they are well worth visiting.\n\n6. LimeTorrents - Best Semi-Private Torrent Tracker\n\nSpeaking of the old generation, LimeTorrents has managed to dodge all the legal challenges and shutdowns other big names have been hit with. The site has managed that mainly by being very careful about what it actually hosts in terms of data. Instead of putting actual torrent files (which have become legally dodgy) on the site, they just host the hash values of those torrents.\n\nAt the moment, this P2P repository is going underground. It seems as if the site is moving its torrent content to the deep Web, and you need to use the LimeTorrents client to access them. While this might seem a little overboard, LimeTorrents might very well be the last torrent sites that work when the dust finally settles, which is why you should keep them in mind.\n\n7. IGG Games - Best Torrent Site for Freshly Released Games\n\nMost of our recommendations allow you to find and download PC games. However, those files typically come from all kinds of release groups, some of which are known for propagating malware. So, if you're looking to download malware-free PC games, know that IGG is among the safest P2P sources of games on the Web.\n\nUpon opening IGG Games, you'll see individual blog posts for each PC game. You can browse them chronologically, or you can check what's trending or popular. Also, you won't encounter any aggressive ads here. The biggest annoyance is that each link opens in a new tab. Aside from that, this is pure heaven for cracked PC games.\n\n8. FitGirl Repacks - Best Torrent Site for Size-Optimized PC Games\n\nJust above, we talked about a stellar source of PC games. However, you probably know how big AAA games are in terms of their file size (50GB+ in most cases). So, if you don't have an ultra-fast connection, you'll want to consider FitGirl Repacks, known for bringing highly optimized files that are often 1/3 of their original size.\n\nFitGirl Repacks is known for posting new games daily. You'll also find malware-free files only, and the site features advanced search filters. More advanced users can also make use of the site's RSS feeds, using which you can check what's new and download P2P files automatically. Also, keep in mind that these highly optimized files will usually take more time to install.\n\n9. IPTorrents - Best Private P2P Tracker\n\nIf you're dedicated to downloading torrents and being a part of a closed P2P community, you'll want to hear about IPTorrents. This is a private tracker, which means that someone must invite you. However, you can also choose to donate, which is another way to get access. Don't worry; IPTorrents is one of the oldest and most trustworthy private trackers out there.\n\nSince this is a closed community, you'll find a curated library of over a million files. Those are verified, minimizing the risk of encountering malware. Also, IPTorrents' members are required to meet a certain seed ratio (to avoid having their accounts disabled), which results in sharing files that are pretty quick to download.\n\n10. EZTV - Best Torrent Site for Downloading TV Shows\n\nNext, we have a niche torrent site dedicated to TV shows. Called EZTV, it's been around for quite some time, which is one reason why the website looks outdated. However, if you look beneath the surface, you will see loads of helpful features.\n\nFor example, the website allows you to track its calendar of releases and check out when new seasons are about to air so that you can set reminders accordingly.\n\nWhat needs to be said about EZTV is that this website is incredibly powerful. You can find TV show categories by genres, types, and video file quality - and you can download torrents and magnet files. And on top of that, EZTV comes with millions of active users, making it easy to find healthy P2P files. What more could we possibly ask for?\n\n11. Torrent Downloads - Best Torrent Site for Music & eBooks\n\nEven though this website has a generic name and a somewhat boring design, trust us that this is one of the best P2P repositories right now. It's been around for some time and gone through several iterations, and the current one is definitely the best one yet.\n\nThis is a huge library of torrents from just about any category imaginable. You can download movies, TV shows, music, books, and pretty much everything else. Every torrent comes with a detailed description, including information related to its health.\n\nLastly, even though 'Torrent Downloads' brings a nice selection of P2P files, we strongly recommend it for downloading music and e-books. Thanks to the site's handy filtering options, you'll have access to advanced ways of downloading high-quality audio and PDF files.\n\n12. Torlock - Best for Downloading Verified Torrents\n\nTorLock is known for offering verified torrents only. In other words, this torrent site's owners are doing plenty to avoid malware and other less-than-desirable consequences of unsafe torrenting. You should really keep this in mind, and this is why we recommend using TorLock—especially if you're new to the world of P2P.\n\nThis torrent repository offers a wide range of torrents from every category imaginable. Before you download one, you'll see all of its information, including metadata and the release group behind that torrent. This is designed to give you peace of mind, and we have to say that Torlock succeeds in its mission.\n\n13. KATcr - Best Alternative to KickassTorrents\n\nThe entire global torrenting community felt the impact when the original KickassTorrents disappeared. This was a brilliantly designed website with millions of daily visitors, so it's not surprising that numerous clones have appeared. However, this also means that many malicious clones are targeting your privacy, so you should be extra careful to avoid malware.\n\nAmong the best KickassTorrent alternatives, KATcr stands above the rest. This is a clone of the original website, where you won't be able to tell the difference. You can download movies, TV shows, games, software, and anything else in between. There's also a highly active community if you want to talk to like-minded individuals.\n\n14. iDope - Best Torrent Site for Mac Software & Games\n\nTo make our list as helpful as possible, we wanted to include something a bit different as well. So, we'd like to introduce you to iDope, a gateway to millions of magnet torrent files, many of which are incredibly quick to download.\n\nYou can think of iDope as a torrent search engine, giving you access to movies, TV shows, e-books, software, games, and adult content. However, we especially recommend iDope to Mac users, as it provides a wealth of macOS games and software, which has become incredibly hard to find lately.\n\nMultiple ways are available to filter and organize its database, allowing you to easily pinpoint a healthy torrent file, no matter how old it might be.\n\n15. Torrends - Best Search Engine for Verified Torrent Files\n\nWhile even the best P2P libraries look alike, some stand out thanks to their intuitive design. 'Torrends' is one such website. In fact, it is a torrent search engine that scrapes information from many highly active repositories.\n\nEven if you don't know what to download, this website will provide numerous suggestions. You can see what's popular online and what other people are saying, and everything is broken down into easily digestible categories. This website also brings a list of mirror URLs, which is hugely helpful, considering that many torrenting sites are blocked in different parts of the world.\n\nTorrent Sites That Are No Longer Available\n\nTorrent libraries can disappear overnight, which is precisely what happened to the following websites. We wanted to list them to help you avoid potentially malicious clones and mirror sites. So, here are some previously popular options that are now offline indefinitely.\n\nRARBG\n\nBecoming a successful P2P site is a double-edged sword. Success also means being targeted the hardest. This applies to our previous recommendation but also to RARBG. Being one of the oldest P2P repositories of its kind, it managed to survive through several ups and downs – and is still one of the best sites for finding torrents.\n\nSheer torrent numbers are not that special anymore, though. Therefore, RARBG makes this list not only because it is so comprehensive - but also because it has a clean design. Even if it looks sparse and simple, the process of finding the torrent you want is easy and quick.\n\nZooqle\n\nZooqle is one of the new kids on the block, and as such, it tries to do some interesting new things. The main party trick is that torrents go through a verification process. This means that you're highly unlikely to find fake torrent files that either contain malware or are password-protected.\n\nZooqle is dedicated to TV shows and movie torrents (it's expanding to other categories as well). While that might limit the quantity of content, it does allow for some great quality additions.\n\nFor one thing, the site owners have created a smart little API that pulls metadata on video torrents from a movie database. So you see the artwork, reviews, and ratings all in one place. It's very polished and a good representation of the new-generation torrent search engines.\n\nHow to Use Torrent Sites Safely and Privately?\n\nYou'll need to sign up for a VPN provider, install its app, and connect to a server. That's when you can start torrenting privately. Here are all the steps you need to take:\n\nSubscribe to a torrenting-friendly VPN (we recommend NordVPN).\n\nDownload the VPN app and install it on your computer.\n\nLaunch the app and log in using your credentials.\n\nEnable your VPN's kill switch by visiting its settings.\n\nEnsure that you use secure protocols like OpenVPN or WireGuard.\n\nConnect to a VPN server in a P2P-friendly country (e.g., Switzerland, Spain, Romania).\n\nYou can now access any torrent site and start downloading torrents.\n\nCountries like Switzerland, Spain, and Romania are the best VPN locations to use when torrenting, as they'll help you unblock and reach more P2P sites. That said, you'll be happy to know that NordVPN offers dedicated P2P servers in all those countries.\n\nWhy Do You Need a VPN for Browsing Torrent Sites?\n\nVPNs practically make your Web traffic anonymous, making it difficult for anyone to see your P2P traffic. They also prevent trackers and keep you safe and private online. Let's check out some of the biggest benefits you'll get once you start using a VPN:\n\nStay Ahead of Potential Legal Issues: Avoiding copyright infringement is imperative, but it can sometimes be hard to identify potentially problematic files. A VPN acts as a highly effective precautionary measure to stay on the safe side of the law.\n\nDefeat Any Torrent Site's Geo-Block: Each country blocks a different set of torrenting sites. If you find most torrent sites blocked in your country, all you need is a VPN. Pick a server abroad, and you'll see sites open without any issues.\n\nDo Your Torrenting in Private: Online services track your location based on your IP address, which also gets exposed in P2P swarms. To ensure no one knows about your torrenting activities, you need to hide and change your IP address by connecting to a VPN server.\n\nReacher a Higher Level of Anonymity: A VPN will help you anonymize your Web traffic. That means your Internet provider won't see what you do online, what kinds of websites you visit, and what kinds of files you download or stream.\n\nEnsure Your Digital Security: VPNs are great for preventing data leaks, which means you'll be protected against malicious actors. Furthermore, today's best VPNs for torrenting have antimalware tools, so you can use them to scan smaller torrent files as soon as you download them.\n\nEvade ISP-Induced Bandwidth Throttling: Most Internet providers use selective throttling to cut their costs and save bandwidth. To regain the full speed of your connection, a VPN is needed, as it prevents ISPs from detecting your data packets and slowing you down.\n\nDownload Over P2P Safely on Public Wi-Fi: In most cases, public Wi-Fi networks are designed to log your sensitive information, as well as track what you do online. A VPN can encrypt any Wi-Fi network, allowing you to use open networks without any fear.\n\nRegain Access to Your Home Sites While Traveling: Most countries block P2P-related sites in some way, and the same applies to country-based digital services like streaming apps. With a VPN, you can connect to a server back home and unblock the Web.\n\nHow to Choose the Best Torrenting Websites?\n\nBefore you decide on which P2P site to use, make sure to inspect its reputation, the size of its content library, how often new files appear, and how many visitors the site has. Here's a more comprehensive look at the requirements you need to follow:\n\nResearch the Site's Age & Reputation: You'll want a long-standing P2P site with a proven track record of not going through extended periods of downtime. Lucky for you, there are plenty of websites that have been around for more than a decade now. Still, before using any P2P site, make sure to do some online digging about its reputation.\n\nCheck the Site's Geo-Availability: P2P repositories typically don't impose geo-blocks, which means they work in any country out there. However, individual Internet providers can impose website blocks to prevent you from downloading torrents. Of course, that's something you can bypass using a VPN, but it's good to know what websites you can visit in your country.\n\nYou'll Want a Rich Content Library: Today, we have several multi-purpose torrent websites that bring all kinds of files. It means that you can rely on those to download music, movies, software, and more. However, if you're into more specific types of content (like anime, for example), you're better off using a free torrent site that has niche content.\n\nLook for Advanced P2P Search Filtering: The best torrent sites host millions of torrents. Without advanced search filtering, you'll have a hard time finding the best file available. That's because you'll want to filter the available torrents by their date of upload or health, letting you more easily separate the best files available.\n\nRely on User Comments & Ratings: There are plenty of benefits to using sites with active user communities. Rely on comments to check for any potential issues or other problematic aspects. You can also consult social media and forums for some recommendations.\n\nInspect the Health of Individual Torrent Files: Having a website with millions of torrents isn't worth much if the health of those files is low. A healthy torrent file has more seeders than leechers, which allows you to download those files as fast as possible. In other words, you need to go for sites used by a large number of individuals.\n\nAvoid Sites with Heavy Advertisements: P2P sites generate revenue by serving ads. This is why many of them can be overly aggressive, with ads served in multiple forms. You can try finding a P2P site with fewer ads, but we recommend you use a capable ad blocker.\n\nMalware-Related Reputation: Most P2P sites have dealt with malware at some point in the past. To avoid a possible infection, go for a torrent site that brings verified torrents, which means they've been checked for safety. Also, try to download files from reputable release groups and use an anti-virus app to scan files before opening them.\n\nWhat Are Torrent Sites?\n\nTorrent sites are repositories of torrent files. In other words, they allow P2P users to share (upload and download) torrent files from any platform or device.\n\nAs explained above, torrent files don't come with any content. They're merely instructions for your torrent client, pointing to where their content is found. That's precisely why it's said that torrent files are decentralized files, as their content is never found on a single device.\n\nAs such, P2P repositories don't host any content, which is how they manage to evade laws related to copyright infringement (as most of their content is copyrighted).\n\nWhy Are Some Torrenting Sites Blocked?\n\nA number of torrent sites are blocked worldwide due to piracy. After all, those sites are most often used to share copyrighted files.\n\nIn other words, even though P2P libraries also bring 100% legal-to-share data that belongs to the public domain, they also share copyrighted files. That includes commercially available music, TV shows, movies, software, games, and more.\n\nAs you probably know, sharing copyrighted files is illegal in most countries. That's why we've seen torrent sites blocked in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Italy, India, China, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Brazil, the Philippines, and many other countries.\n\nAre Torrenting Sites Safe and Legal to Use?\n\nTorrenting sites are legal to access and use in most countries. However, in some cases, their content might be illegal to download. So, let's explain that more clearly.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with using your browser to access torrent sites, no matter in which country you reside. If your Internet Service Provider has been ordered to block torrent sites, you'll see a message explaining the situation. However, know that you won't be doing anything wrong or illegal.\n\nHowever, the truth is that P2P sites are primarily used to distribute copyrighted content. So, using and sharing that content leads to copyright infringement, which is what's illegal about torrenting. As long as you don't download copyrighted files, you'll be safe.\n\nAnd in terms of their safety, know that torrent repositories can spread malware. That's because they are hugely popular, with their files being shared among millions. If a malicious actor uploads infected files, those files can easily spread.\n\nThat said, it's a good idea to use an antivirus app. Also, use common sense when picking files to download. Go for popular files only, with plenty of seeders, and inspect comments if that option is available on your favorite P2P site(s).\n\nHow to Stay Safe and Avoid Fake Torrent Sites?\n\nBy sticking to verified torrent files and using reputable sites, you can avoid the dangers that come with fake P2P files. There's plenty more you can do to stay safe, so let's review the best options:\n\nDownload Verified Torrent Files Primarily: Many torrent sites (including the ones we recommended above) bring verified files, which have been checked before being made public. Those files should be free of malware and other risky aspects of downloading torrents.\n\nDon't Stray Away from Popular Torrent Files: Files with many seeders typically indicate that there's nothing with that data. In other words, if a file has been already downloaded thousands of times, chances are that someone would have already found something suspicious.\n\nTry Using a Private Search Engine: It's never a good idea to use Google to search for torrent files. Instead, turn to torrent search engines, which are designed to scrape P2P sites only. As such, they're a great way to reach dozens of P2P libraries at once.\n\nResearch the File's Uploader: It's wise to stick to reputable uploaders. For example, YTS is a great release group of movies, and FitGirl is great for games. If you can, avoid using files from unknown or first-time uploaders.\n\nCheck ZIP, RAR & TAR Archives for Malware: As a way to bypass antivirus apps, malware files are often hidden inside archives. Those can be ZIP, RAR, or TAR files, but many other types exist as well. Before \"unzipping\" any archive, check its contents first.\n\nBe Careful When Opening EXE Files: Windows users rely on EXE files to install applications. However, EXE files can come bundled with malicious files, avoiding antivirus systems. Use your antivirus to check any executable files before activating them.\n\nUse a Safe & Reputable Torrent Client: Torrent clients come in all shapes and sizes, but don't make the mistake of using the first one you find online. The best torrent clients, like uTorrent, qBitTorrent, or BitTorrent, can scan your files for malware and spyware.\n\nDon't Open Password-Protected Torrents: It's not unusual for malicious actors to upload password-protected files, asking you to visit some strange site to retrieve the password. In most cases, those sites are riddled with malware.\n\nCheck Each Website's URL in the Address Bar: Copycat sites tend to imitate popular sites like Pirate Bay or 1337X by copying their design and using a similar-looking URL. Those are mostly malicious websites, so it's important to check each site's URL properly.\n\nReads What Others Have Said: Popular torrenting sites typically have comment sections, letting individuals share their experiences and opinions. Checking those comments is often the fastest way to see if a torrent file is safe to download.\n\nStay Away from Copyrighted Files: Most countries have laws that protect copyrights, which means you could be charged or forced to pay a hefty fine if you download copyrighted content. That said, it's best to stay away from copyright infringement.\n\nWhich Torrent Sites Should You Avoid?\n\nIn general, you should avoid obscure and unknown torrent sites. Those sites are typically poorly maintained, increasing your chances of encountering dangerous files. Here are some of the sites that have been linked with malware, meaning you should avoid them:\n\nSteamUnlocked\n\nSkidrow Group's Sites\n\nSUMOTorrent\n\nTorrentFunk\n\nPassThePopcorn\n\nDemonoid\n\nAlso, even when using reputable torrent sites, it's essential to inspect each uploader's history and reputation. Site admins can't scan and check every single file, so it's best to avoid uploaders that are new to the P2P scene and stick to the proven ones only.\n\nHow to Access Private Torrent Sites?\n\nThere could be three ways to access a private torrent site - by registering, asking for an invite, or donating money.\n\nIn most cases, you will need to be invited by an existing member. So, do your research online and check social media websites or discussion boards, trying to find someone willing to invite you.\n\nAlso, know that private P2P communities that employ that method are usually the best option for finding \"healthy\" torrent files due to their strict supervision.\n\nSome private P2P communities might allow you to register from time to time (for example, once a month). And finally, some might ask for your money, which helps them stay on top of their expenses. Be wary of P2P communities that ask for money, and make sure to check if they're credible and trustworthy by searching online.\n\nCan Other People See What Torrents I Download?\n\nYes, pretty much anyone out there can see what you download. That's because when you download torrent files, your IP address gets exposed.\n\nKnow that your IP address can reveal your precise location, download history, and more. In the past, we've seen many cases where individuals were targeted through their IP addresses - and yes, we're talking about criminal and legal cases here.\n\nTorrent files are nothing more than instructions for your torrent client. So, once you activate (start downloading) any torrent, your torrent client will contact various types of trackers.\n\nThose are nothing more than publicly facing servers - listing your IP address. That also means that your IP address will be exposed to other individuals who download that same torrent file. And finally, that data will be visible to your ISP (Internet provider).\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIn conclusion, it's crucial to stick to the proven options only when downloading torrents. This guide lists the best torrent sites available right now, all of which are safe to use, offer an endless library of files, and can deliver fast download speeds. More importantly, most of the sites featured above have screening systems, which reduces your chances of encountering malware.\n\nOf course, we'll remind you that you have to use a VPN when torrenting. A VPN is the only way to use P2P sites privately and securely without exposing your IP address and your sensitive data. Plus, VPNs give you access to every single torrent site featured in this guide.\n\nFinally, let's not forget that VPNs help scan for malware, block malicious domains, secure any type of Internet connection, and even bypass ISP-induced throttling. As such, they're an irreplaceable tool when torrenting.\n\nThat's it for this guide, which we hope you've found informative. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to post your comments below.
