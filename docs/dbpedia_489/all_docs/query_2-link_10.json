        "text": "Every day millions of cinephiles visit online streaming websites to watch the latest movies and tv shows. People are moving from the traditional ways of watching movies to this new way of enjoying movies at home without laboring for a ticket. There are presumably hundreds of online streaming websites, and SolarMovie is one of them.\n\nOne can find plenty of movies and TV shows on SolarMovies; It has an excellent user interface. The site provides high-quality content. SolarMovie is known for its streaming quality and easy-to-navigate options. It is a great site to watch movies and TV shows.\n\nHowever, sometimes users don’t find what they’re looking for; in other words, there are lots of movies and tv shows that SolarMovies’s library lacks. It is better to have some alternatives in your mind so you can know where to go. In this article, we have assembled a list of 20 SolarMovies alternatives.\n\nIllegitimate websites are potentially harmful and malicious for your system and data, as they are capable enough to harass the privacy and collect sensitive information from your device. They use a number of trackers to collect all the sensitive data from your computer system.\n\nBest Free SolarMovie Alternatives\n\n1. YIFY TV\n\nYify TV was previously known as a torrent-based streaming website. Due to its growing popularity, the site got dragged down to merely an online movie streaming site. The user interface of YifyTv is simply impressive and far better than SolarMovies or any other website on this list.\n\nYou will find movies sorted in sections, genres, and tabs such as Trending, Popular, Top Hit, and Ratings. The website provides an incredible user experience, and I think that’s what makes it one of the best alternatives for SolarMovies. Yify Tv is entirely free and does not require registration.\n\nThough the ads are sometimes shown, they are not annoying and won’t ruin your movie or show. Here you will find an array of genres to watch movies from, Crime, Horror, Action, Thriller, Mystery, Romance, Drama, and the list goes on. The foreign movies include French, German, Hindi, and Korean. The details of every movie/TV show are displayed below the content.\n\nHere you will find descriptions, IMDB ratings, cast, director, producer, and similar titles. Yify provides great options to spare your time in search of a movie, which means you can go to any genre or type in a search field and get something to watch in just a few clicks.\n\nVisit YTS YIFY\n\n4. WatchSeries\n\nWatchSeries is a free streaming service that offers movies and TV shows to watch online. The site does not host the content on its platform but embeds video from 3rd party video hosting providers like Streamtape, VidStream, Filemoon, MyCloud, and more. The service obviously is not a legitimate source to stream, but due to its free nature, it is a go-to site for freeloaders to stream HD content on their mobile or desktop browsers.\n\nVisit WatchSeries | Link 2\n\n3. YoMovies\n\nYoMovies is known for its giant content library. You will find everything here, be it an old classic movie or the latest movie right from the theatre, which is added just two to three days of release. They present the cinephiles with a high-definition movie version to watch.\n\nThe content is distributed in diverse sections such as Movies, TV shows, Trending, and Top IMDB ratings. The genres include Adventure, Thriller, Horror, Crime, Animation, and Action. Honestly, it’s a long list. You should check it out. I’m sure you will find something to watch in your favorite genre.\n\nFurthermore, there is no requirement for a sign-up to enjoy movies or shows. YoMovies makes the search of movies so easy by providing excellent options such as a search bar, alphabetic search, and search by IMDB ratings. YoMovies proves itself as a good SolarMovie alternative.\n\nHowever, the website shows annoying pop-up ads ( not between a movie) 2-3 times, and then you have to close those to watch your movie. Despite that, what makes YoMovies worth considering as a SolarMovie alternative is its enormous library and elegant interface.\n\nCopy: YoMovies.co.in\n\n4. PutLockers\n\nPutLockers2 provides everything to its users to make their stay at the website as comfortable as possible. The site renders some impressive features such as the “night mode” option to turn the backgrounds dark—a treat for your eyes. Mirror links are also provided for every movie.\n\nSay If a server is not available in your country, you can still watch the movie with alternative servers. Movies and shows are organized in Most Viewed, TV series, and Movies tabs. PutLockers2 also presents a feature to demand a movie/show.\n\nYou can ask for a movie or show to be added to the library by a “Request Option,” which you will find on top. I think that’s a unique approach as other free streaming sites utterly lack this feature, SolarMovies too.\n\nThe PutLockers2 allows you to navigate top-rated IMDB movies, most viewed movies, and popular movies easily just by clicking tabs. Although the streaming quality is not adequate for some movies, you will enjoy the experience and site’s user-friendly features.\n\nCopy: https://ww1.putlockers2.com/ | https://ww3.putlocker.onl/\n\n5. 123Movies\n\n123Movies is an online movie streaming site and can be a great alternative to SolarMovies. One of the many reasons I include 123Movies in this list is because of its incredible streaming quality. The site is user-friendly and renders a huge library of content, and there is always something to watch.\n\nThe content is sorted in sections at the top includes: Featured, Genre, Movies, TV series, and Episodes. Coming down, you will find an arrangement of tabs such as Top-Rated, Most Favourite, Most Viewed, Top IMDB, and much more.\n\nThe movies and TV shows are distributed in a disciplined manner; hence there is no mingling of content. That’s what makes the website user-friendly and a good SolarMovies alternative. Additionally, 123Movies provides content from different languages, Korean, German, and Hindi, so you don’t miss the top movies and shows.\n\nIf you can’t find a particular movie you are looking for, the site allows you to request a movie, and it works. 123Movies aims for better user experiences, and the site keeps updating once in a while with the latest movies and TV shows.\n\nCopy: ww2.0123movie.net | ww2.123movies.la\n\n6. M4UFree.tv\n\nM4UFree.tv is another well-known online movie/tv series streaming platform. It is a free platform, and surprisingly, M4UFree.tv does not show pop-up ads. Although If you happen to click some ads, you might see some pop-ups.\n\nThe library of M4UFree.tv is beautifully classified under six sections: New Movies, New TV series, Genre, Year, Anime, and Most Watched section. M4UFree.tv, in contrast to other online streaming sites, manages to show fewer ads and more content.\n\nAdditionally, the site does not deceive its users with Download and Play Buttons, which means you will stay on the website after clicking these buttons and won’t be tossed forcefully to watch an ad. Being an annoying-ad-free site, M4UFree.TV lets you navigate the site and explore movies without encountering any problems.\n\nFurthermore, no registration is required. Just go to the site and binge on your favorite shows. The quality of M4UFree.tv providing a premium feel in free is worth considering as a SolarMovie alternative.\n\nCopy: https://ww2.m4ufree.tv/ | m4ufree.kim\n\n7. Vumoo\n\nVumoo has the best-quality movies and TV shows. Its content library is enormous. Content is sorted into merely two sections: Movies and TV shows. No registration is required. However, to watch unlimited movies, you have to register yourself.\n\nBesides famous or newly released movies and the latest TV shows, Vumoo also presents documentaries. Vumoo is a free site, and one of its best attributes is the site free from craps like pop-up ads. You won’t get disturbed watching your movies/shows.\n\nIf you are looking for a good SolarMovie alternative, Vumoo is going to fill that void for you. It has better search results, loads content with incredible speed, and impressive streaming quality.\n\nAnd the most critical factor the site allows you to download and save movies/shows. Furthermore, the site is not illegal, and it is also safe. Vumoo does not store content; it searches for you and hosts that content on their site so you can watch.\n\nCopy: https://vumoo.download/ | vumoo.id\n\n8. MoviesJoy\n\nMoviesJoy is a streaming website with lots of content to watch under the “Country,” “Genre,” “Tv Shows,” and “Top IMDB” tabs. Scrolling down, you will find a section “Trending Now,” which holds the latest movies and TV shows. The interface of MoviesJoy is pretty simple and user-friendly.\n\nMoviesJoy’s enormous content library includes not just movies and TV shows. You will find kids shows, reality tv shows, documentaries, sci-fi movies/shows, and much more.\n\nNavigating the site is so easy with sorted tabs and sections. If you like to watch Top IMDB movies, a section is right at the top, with just a few clicks you’ll be bingeing on movies. Furthermore, registration is not mandatory, and there are no hidden ads on the site.\n\nCopy: www1.moviesjoy.net | moviesjoys.in\n\n9. YesMovies\n\nAnother great SolarMovie alternative, YesMovies, is an online movie streaming site that renders content in high quality no registration required, and no pop-up ads. The user interface is impressive and gives a premium feel. The content is sorted in various sections at the top, which include Country, Genre, Top IMDB, etc.\n\nYesMovies provides a massive collection of movies and shows. You will find content from remote regions that include China, Korea, India, Europe, and France. Additionally, the site presents brand new movies and TV shows (pirated) from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and other paid streaming sites.\n\nFurthermore, every movie and TV show displays a description, information about the cast, directors, duration, and ratings. Like some SolarMovie alternatives in this list, YesMovies allows users to demand a movie/show to be added to the arsenal. Indeed, you will face some ads here, but don’t worry, you won’t be redirected to other sites by clicking any button.\n\nCopy: https://yesmovies9.com/ | yesmovies.ag\n\n10. AnimeHeaven\n\nAnimeHeaven is one of the fastest-updated anime platforms. Though you may be greeted with some annoying video Ads, pop-ups, and banner Ads, the pain is bearable though a ad blocker can block most of the Ads. The AnimeHeaven is regularly updated with new Anime shows and movies pretty quickly. You get latest Anime subs and dubs if available.\n\n15+ Best Websites to Download Anime for Free\n\nVisit AnimeHeaven | Free\n\n11. MovieWatcher\n\nIf you don’t want any major change from SolarMovie, the MovieWatcher.is got you covered. It is an online streaming website similar to SolarMovie, although it does have some extra features, and its streaming quality is better than SolarMovie.\n\nMovieWatcher.is has an excellent user interface, and one of the factors I’m adding MovieWatcher.is in this list is its interface. Finding movies on MovieWatcher is easy and simple. You can navigate the site or hunt your desired movie through the search bar.\n\nMovieWatcher.is offers the latest movies and TV shows, and extra content includes reality shows and documentaries. The content is disciplined in tabs “New Movies,” “Popular Movies,” etc. It even allows you to download the content from the site, though you will encounter some pop-up ads. Eventually, you will get excellent quality content.\n\nCopy: https://moviewatcher-official.site/\n\n12. Levidia.ch\n\nLevidia.ch is a flash-based online streaming website. That means to run its content; you have to install the latest flash drives. It is torrent-based and provides the latest movies and shows in high-definition. The site allows you to download and stream the content.\n\nAlthough the site is rich in content and provides great features, it is underrated. You will find movies here that are being aired in theatres.\n\nThere are many torrent-based sites on the internet, but Levidia.ch is on this list because it requires no registration. It doesn’t show more ads than content, and there are no hidden pop-up ads. The content is sorted into a section that involves Most Viewed, Popular, and Year. You will find almost every genre here, from talk shows to the latest hit movies in one place.\n\nCopy: levidia.ch\n\n13. Megashare\n\nIf you are a fan of action, thriller, or mystery genre, then Megashare is your treasure. Besides crime and thrillers, you will also find animated movies, documentaries, talk shows, and much more to watch. The quality of movies/shows is evident, and Megashare is well-known for this trait.\n\nThe website is easy to navigate with tabs at the top and a search bar.

Furthermore, all the movies and shows are in HD.\n\nCopy: https://megashare.bio/\n\n14. Primewire\n\nPrimewire is a beautifully designed online movie streaming website. It is aimed to render a striking user experience. From the outlook, the website seems user-friendly, and exploring it won’t defy the former statement. It has an immense library of content movies, and TV shows are distributed in sections at the top.\n\nThe sections include “Genre,” “Released,” “Country,” “Last Added,” “Top Watched,” and more.

FMovies\n\nFMovies is another excellent website that can be a robust competitor for SolarMovie. It has a beautiful user interface. The movie library is immense, and you will find almost every TV show here. One of the factors FMovies got a sweet spot in this list is because of its watching experience.\n\nIt is great. You will feel like you are in premium territory. Here you can get access to content from different countries. And the best thing is you won’t get bothered by pop-up ads on this website. FMovies merely show pop-ups when you click an ad.

From sci-fi geeks to gangster movie lovers, there is something to watch for every cinephile.\n\nSearch Google FMovies\n\n16. AllMovie.com\n\nProbably the best SolarMovie alternative If you want to watch something with the family. Although the site contains R-Rated content, Allmovie.com provides you with a feature to filter out the content. You will find everything here from Old classics of Marlon Brando to the latest hits from Netflix Originals. All at one place in a user-friendly environment.\n\nThe speed of loading content and quality is exceptional and worth mentioning here. AllMovie categorizes its content in tabs that include New Releases, Discover, Recommendations, and Advanced Search. A unique approach promoted by AllMovie to enhance the user experience is, in the Article tab, you will find the reviews of the movies.\n\nSo you don’t waste your time watching what’s not your taste. And recommendations from other users, which can help choose a movie to watch. I think this alone distinguishes AllMovie as a great SolarMovie alternative. I’d say the site provides a better user experience because it cares about frequent updates.\n\nCopy: allmovie.com\n\n17. Movie4K\n\nMovie4K is another well-known streaming service that includes pirated content. The site was banned due to piracy a couple of years ago. However, the owners revived the site and named it Movie 4k. Everyone loves a place where one can watch loads of premium content without paying a penny. Movie4K is that place.\n\nYou will enjoy content without encountering any pop-up ads. You will find here Movies and TV shows dubbed in different languages. The movie listing is straightforward to browse. So you spend less time looking for a movie to watch. The site is dense like SolarMovie and includes a collection of HD movies and TV shows.\n\nAdditionally, the site provides you with two options to share content you are watching with your friends and family through WhatsApp and Facebook. Movie4K offers fresh movies and TV shows. Movies that are still rolling in cinemas and recently released Tv shows on paid streaming platforms.\n\nCopy: movies4k.co/\n\n18. MKVKing\n\nMKVKing another free streaming website that allows you to relish its content without any registration required. Sometimes when you are not sure what to watch from an enormous library of content on streaming sites, you end up spending an hour deciding what to watch.\n\nMKVKing provides you with a feature ‘Suggest me a Movie” where the site will suggest to you some best movies to watch. The content is classified in such discipline, so no user can find it difficult to find a movie. The content arsenal holds the latest movies, TV shows, animated movies, documentaries, and much more.\n\nYou can easily share the links of movies and shows with your friends who want to watch the content. Furthermore, the navigation menu is simple and elegant. The whole site has a beautiful design. MKVKing can be a significant SolarMovie alternative if you consider two factors one: the site saves your time in choosing a movie, and second the streaming quality is as good as SolerMovie’s.\n\nVisit MKVKing\n\n19. YouTube\n\nYou might be surprised to see YouTube in the list, and you’d say YouTube is a mere video content website. Well, that’s partially true. You will find high-quality movies on some channels. And the best thing is Youtube is the most trustworthy and reliable site out there. You won’t have to worry about malware effects and viruses entering your computer when clicking links.\n\nRegistration is optional, and to get notified of the latest movies, you can turn on the bell icon and subscribe to the channel for new updates. You might also find the latest hits on the YouTube movies page. However, there are still plenty of movies to watch; there are probably hundreds of channels uploading movies. Some YouTube channels upload the latest movies after several months of release date due to some copyright concerns.\n\nVisit YouTube\n\nFrom Editor’s Desk\n\nIf you Google the term “online movie and tv show is streaming sites,” you will be presented a bunch of useless recommendations. Those sites are nothing but an ad-streaming platform. The problem is, sites like mentioned above are underrated, yet they offer the best service on the web. Indeed SolarMovies provides good quality and fine user experience. However, sites like those mentioned above are as good as SolarMovies and can be considered as optional alternatives."
