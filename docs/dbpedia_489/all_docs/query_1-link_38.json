The film, which features a script by Andrew Lobel, also stars Simona Tabasco (“The White Lotus”), Alvaro Morte (“Money Heist”), Benedetta Porcaroli (“Baby”), and Dora Romano (The Hand of God). Sweeney produced with Jonathan Davino for Fifty-Fifty Films, alongside Middle Child Pictures’ David Bernad, who developed the project with Sweeney following their collaboration on the Emmy-winning “The White Lotus”.
