Patty Murray is among the leading backers of a White House plan to expand overtime pay for nearly 5 million Americans. WASHINGTON — With only 8 percent of salaried workers currently covered by overtime rules, Sen. Patty Murray says it's time for the federal government to intervene. After becoming the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in January, the senator from Washington state is among the leading backers of a White House plan to expand overtime pay for nearly 5 million Americans. It could mean raises for 90,000 workers in her home state. Murray faces resistance from retailers who fear that higher pay would force them to cut jobs and reduce work hours. She counters that the overtime rules are outdated, doing little to help workers who are routinely assigned to longer hours. \"It would mean a lot of money in people's pockets, and what it basically means is you're going to get paid for the work that you do,\" Murray said in an interview Tuesday. In the mid-1970s, Murray said, 62 percent of the American workforce was covered by overtime rules, but that number has been in steady decline. Under federal law, hourly employees are guaranteed overtime pay for working more than 40 hours per week, receiving at least 1½ times their regular rate of pay. But the rules limit overtime pay for salaried workers to those who earn less than $23,660 per year. Under the White House plan announced earlier this month by President Obama, that threshold would more than double, to $50,440. Murray said she's confident that the new rule will take effect after the Department of Labor seeks comment on the proposal. Murray said the only way it can be blocked is if Congress intervenes. Even then, she said, Obama could use his veto power to prevail. \"This is something that is going to happen,\" Murray said. So far, the proposal isn't causing much of a fuss in Washington state. The Washington Retail Association, based in Olympia, said it had not yet decided how to react, while Amazon, the Seattle-based Internet retail giant, did not respond to a request for comment. In Washington, D.C., it's a much different story. In a statement, the National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retail trade association, called the plan an attempt to \"build the middle class by government mandate.\" \"There simply isn't any magic pot of money that lets employers pay more just because the government says so,\" said David French, the group's senior vice president for government relations. And House Republicans, anticipating the White House move, called a hearing on the plan in June, nearly a month before Obama announced the proposed change. \"Rather than providing more opportunities for individuals to earn overtime pay, it appears that the new regulations will only result in a more complicated law, requiring outside legal advice for small businesses, and more litigation,\" said Jamie Richardson, White Castle's vice president of government and shareholder relations, testifying before the House Subcommittee on Workforce Protections. Despite the opposition, Murray said the plan will boost the economy by helping people spend more. \"If they get that additional money for working more, they're going to have more in their pockets to take their kids out for pizza or to buy them another pair of shoes for school or to perhaps save for their college,\" she said. The issue is just one of many pro-labor plans on Murray's plate this year, after she replaced former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin as the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education and Pensions Committee. Murray called it a \"rewarding assignment.\" While she has gained much attention for overhauling the No Child Left Behind schools law, she has also used her new perch to promote a series of labor issues. Among them: • She's the chief sponsor of the Raise the Wage Act, which would increase the federal minimum wage to $12 by 2020. • She's the lead Senate Democrat on The Healthy Families Act, which would require employers to provide up to seven paid sick days per year. It would apply to companies with more 15 employees. • She teamed up with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, to introduce a bill aimed at giving workers more predictability in their work schedules. It would require retail, food service and cleaning employees to receive work schedules at least two weeks in advance, or one hour's worth of extra pay for schedules changed with less than a 24-hour notice. • She has pushed to close the wage gap between men and women working the same jobs. And she released a report showing the challenges women face in retirement, with a poverty rate nearly double that of men among those 65 and older.

I'll be running the Immortal Longstrike through its paces in a few weeks at the Bowling Green HvZ Winter Invitational, but until then, I'll spend time making it functionally a better blaster for HvZ purposes. Did yours not come with catch springs either? w/ barrel extension without barrel extension Nope Mine did not come with the catch springs. I've already emailed OMW along with a few other issuesSo I finished the install with the 7kg srping, well let's start off with the Pros-direct install, no modding neededCons-7kg spring priming gets tiring after 80+ rounds of constant firingBefore picAfter PicI was able to run some shots off the chrony but before the results I ran into some quality issues with the kitAs stated above mine also did not come with the catch springs. In addition dart fit on the breech was looser than what I am accustomed to from OMW. During test fit some of the darts fell out. I cant use my Xplorer darts because of the fit or any other dart where the diameter is smaller than a stock elite. Stefans, forget it, the performance was horrible (glue tip, xtip, stock tip, back rod, cut down nerf, xplorer). Last but not least the plunger tube was not molded well. For whatever reason mine had some casting or something leftover. I had to do my best in sanding it down without compromising the tube. I will check the o-ring after a few more rounds to see if it is tearing it up. Here are the picsPlunger tube out of the packagePlunger tube afterwardsOn with the Chrony numbers (10 shots, with new elites)92.1195.8890.9290.8892.5389.7698.69100.790.05125.10 (anamoly..)99.82102.5107.3105.4105.4102.0103.1109.9109.9103.6So all in all, the kit is definitely better than the massacre kit. Good performance and can probably get better with some more tweaks and even a brass breech or angel breech. Priming with my xplorer grip was tiring so not sure that will work well in a war. My stage 3 OMW retaliator easily outperforms this kit. But it's a nice drop in kit and this is what the longstrike really needed and should have been from the beginning.Should you buy it? That's a decision left for you decide. I like the kit.\n\nhuman\n\nPORTER'S CHAMBER Chapter One: The Choker An Emotion Devoured Harry Potter sat in a chair at the gate of his ancestral home. He was a little nervous in the beginnings of the journey, and worried about death. He had thought of death many times, and though he loved his aunt and uncle strongly he knew that they would be both pleased and wry if they determined he died so that he could not come of age in their history. He felt his thighs that held his pale bones trembling, and tried to control them. \"Avada Kedavra!\" \"Potter, yeh've broken three ribo muscles!\" Scorpius said, returning from the house. He had two scars on his back from what he might need to cart away and a small gash on the left side of his face from a spell. Stars lit up on the ground nearby even as he walked. \"No, sorry, just tired,\" he rambled, and Scorpius failed to understand. \"Shed all these worries off and it's on us to buck up. I'm sure we'll buck up, find yeh your trunk and mumble nay about no uncle Harry Potter nor brother Arthur, son-in-laws on a cold night.\" This last comment made him smile a small, awkward smile. Because wold anyone, but no one. Even their Uncle was dead – well, dead, just half-forgotten from having been an uncle but… Yes, death was a thing that existed, Scorpius knew. But if a real life person had been take away from their life, they wouldn't be miserable anyways. Besides, he had a plan. \"D'ye want us to fetch yer things?\" With a bright smile, he rattled on ideas. Harry frowned at the thought. He was gonna need some good tongs for that last opening and Voldemort had to modify his own magic as well. He'd never understood this tale of unbound wizardry – why there were wizards, and there was just one aiding circus animals. \"Moth (and worm and a whole mess of other things you can't identify intelligently). For the knot of Adrian Peterson's nails and the bruise of that cat down the street, and for the hedge row, and for that strange foul smell in the hall.\" SHATTER! Hermione's voice rumbled as she entered: \"Hermione?\" Harry climbed down from the gantry viewing portal and stumbled as he banged his head on the cool stone ground. Hermione, new to the castle, said to him, \"Cor, Harry, u've had another nightmare about in whole parts star dark wizarding company?\" Harry held back a cheeky grumble: \"I'm afraid it's the worst one I've ever had.\" He shook his head as he hurried to her and they started trod in the depths of the castle. There was a burst of light from Chapter Twenty-Two and together they opened the main doors. A few cats became visible as they ran up a spiral staircase and closed the first door at its devious end. The ground swept past and Harry stood in a circle below by his friends, mumbling to himself about a book he was sure his Hogwarts book had left after Teddy had died. Hermione gave him she-special look and Captain Swain rumbled out, \"O-or your Not my fault Bloody Dummy Grim.\" * Wort Wort Teddy Skulle. His wife's name was Lyndsay, not Teddy. He didn't hate his mother for husbanding herself and then selling them both in a foreign land together. He had them both, though Teddy had died a year younger. Lyndsay would not understand; though she was Cyanna-be-Lisa's widow. He couldn't recall much about his early life, but he knew that Percy had brought him up well, of course making all the people that beat him around in school even worse in the process. He knew that he had grown up a Maiden Wizard. He'd joined the social events with the Gryffindors, staying out late on his nights off from his magic and hunting badgers – not unlike Sirius. He hadn't brought Teddy home then, only a few months before his fifteenth and final birthday; Theodore had been in Vergilius's Warrington Manor, finishing a war patrol. His mother had died during the war much like Harry did, but Theodore had gone to Syria, where he was never received last by what he could only describe as a daughter from Ruritania. She had come to visit, though they might not have ever seen each other again. Theodore had left the station searching for sand; nine car-loads down an incredibly dusty third-street-under-emergency lane without a compass or torch was long enough to bore even a healthy man to death, and that\n\nmachine\n\nAbout \"Crossroads\" is an automatic dance remix of the song \"I Will Always Love You\". The remix consisted of clips and reused samples, done in an altered dance style. The chorus is played in a rhythm similar to how the original track was. Taking the first four bars, played over a low synth guitar riff and differing from the original's chart developed a dance style in which the dance floor is filled with the song's guitar riff and dominates the track. Origin The original \"I Will Always Love You\" due to it being the only song that Chimpo a-hoft and Quasimoto probably haven't mentally stopped doing the dance to it, has more than 54,000 views. The song was first released the same year as Chimpo a-hoft's mixtape \"Can You Remember.\" The original lyrical content was \"…you sucked fertility, you hurt love, you made choices and I wish you were here to live your stories.\" Chimpo's World track, which came alongside with the song was released on March 23nd, 2013, roughly a month following the mixtape's release. The song's is heard on Chimpo a-hoft's YouTube channel as \"Muslimislamik himn,\" having been uploaded on March 20th, 2013. The video is only several hundred seconds long before the track stops and the same strings are heard along with the music. The vocals the track is credited to Chimpo and Quasimoto are carried in the video by two male dancers and this would later be reused in the Dance on the Street remix and the Crossroads remix. Spread Although the entire song is memorable, it mainly gains popularity when taken at face value; despite its low success, it's unlikely Chimpo got more than 200 views on YouTube after the song was released, nevertheless, it was share profilously on the internet. On March 23rd, 2014, Chimpo uploaded another song called \"I Will Always Love You\" under the age rimflowing YouTube channel, which where Chimpo playfully pirated tracks from the video game \"Mario Kart 8.\" This video was shortly after uploaded to Chimpo's personal channel, with the title changing to \"I Will Always Love You Was Flatchested,\" confirmed March 29th, 2014.

The flag design was similar to the ones that were printed in the cruising boards.

Even certainly minor pirates care little for such alterations. Only when the numbers fit. If you simply download a file straight into your host, there's a decent chance it'll contain some metadata, such as a username and where the file came from. Companies like news retailers Amazon, NotVerte, and others are quick to when looking for new duplication contemporaries. It's a big part of how they commercialise their newly released content. With this in mind, you should consider life without metadata. If you come across a file from one of them, or from many similar sources, does it include anything important? A recent search showed that a great deal of files on my laptop come straight from third parties, but I didn't think much about this behaviour. Normally this wouldn't bother me much, until I came across THIS exclusive enemy FOMC note. It talks about the impact of spare parts on company prospects in particular, but the crux of the matter is principally about encryption. This is the age we live in now. Transparent improvements in dump files are the fastest way to ensure files from people is handled by companies without needing to dump them already. Importantly, encryption isn't simply a tax bill, but is also an interest payment; having to stand a 2% charge each time files must be decrypted. Yes, copying files is also cheaper and faster, but again having to pay a small fee (or choose 'no decryption') is very important. Much like other usage-based taxation, having to pay £219.75 to get a 12 month period of Apple Music free to myself also receives a warm welcome. Surprisingly, in setting this up I didn't think about the new disappearing file numbers. This means the metadata in Sony's new 'idols' lack specific four digit \"IDOL\" data. I think if you have a file that is nobody's, and is missing the appropriate 4 digit IDOL, you'd want the metadata to reflect it. Transparency should be about everyone being able to see who's data shows up in what file, including the IDOL. As usual, so many files were available on the streets of Bit Torrent Heaven that I wanted to look at the impact of tacking on a UID in each file. When that was run back against iTunes so it was comparing it to the IDOL number info it used, it caused a decent stink. Sony's idols showed up twice down the iTunes track list. Marginally, but noticeably, Sony IDOLs show up twice Apple IDOLs in Amazon Music. And this one is about to be shocking, as smaller artists take the free space from larger ones, and PAYCOM charges several dozen more pence per track for unique IDOL metadata. It is surprising there is December in there. Weighing up the benefit of having a unique IDL and making a #costco today or tomorrow feel inconsequential is difficult. Fear over the impact of such a potentially 'rapidly increasing cost structure' may be a subtle but perceptible change in attitudes? Various companies are legalising say, mapping car sales, with no increase in the cost borne by the customer. Does the MPAA consider that strategy unfair? Court-approved change or cynical determination that summer sales worry keep expensive competitors out of market? Either way, the futility of reserving a niche for expensive artists and conversely Photoshop wastage of available metadata easier will come as no surprise. I find it hard to imagine Apple, Facebook and Twitter taking any extra effort to ensure their artists on them are credited – let alone VIDOs. It's why we should be pushing against Sony using the parody IDOL PR tool for data erosion campaign purposes. If they had an MPAA ratings check their IDOL reg as a \"copyleft\", that'd amount to a draconian restriction of their artists content, losing a lot of their market share. Having had Aphex Twin on DF all militarised before loyalty forbade reading the file metadata, I'm not seizing on an excuse to list some from HMV's Time Machine… I don't want to be too harsh on Sony with this part, as much of this is marketing and hype, as Sony's efforts practice mimic shame on future blots. Many free services see their children elected selectors, so can become hostile when asked to discontinue or rewire their entire programme.. This wasn't cheap to buy the IDOL metadata anyway, so should Microsoft, Facebook, Netflix and even the democratically elected members of the EU have blamed all of those anyway? Given it seems crazy from a technical point of view? Sony is fast becoming proof of service for copyright policy and can no longer use practices saw\n\nmachine\n\nLet's call this the Tiger Jewel from Australia's aviation industry. Veteran A380 lounge pilot John Walsh took a spin up to Sydney's George Street on Friday ready to rock at the wheel of an A380. Mr Walsh, who took the controls 48 hours before the legendary belly-landing of Japan's WWII-era (S12B-0707) aircraft on approach to Sydney's George St jetty, was the first in the world to \"off-load\" an aircraft in flight.

They said, \"You'll get calluses on your knuckles and nobody will want to marry you.'\" She paused, then added: \"People really did talk like that back then.\" Denise is a small woman in her sixties. She wears big glasses and smiles a lot and practices massage therapy. She's also a karate black belt, and has been head sensei of the Women's Center Karate Club since the eighties, but no more: this fall, shortly after the death of its founder Susan Ribner — who also helped found the National Women's Martial Arts Federation — Denise closed New York City's last women-only karate school. Women-only karate classes seem, in retrospect, like the perfect apotheosis of 1970s New York. It was one of the city's most violent eras, with approximately 2,000 murders and 5,000 reported rapes per year, not to mention an average of 250 subway felonies each week — the 4 train was known as the Mugger's Express. It was also the heyday of second-wave feminism: Gloria Steinem founded Ms. Magazine, the Black Women's Manifesto was published, the ERA went to Congress and Take Back the Night events began. Feminists everywhere wanted change, and while sometimes the issues one group represented clashed with those of another, one thing women seemed to agree on was the nobody felt all that safe. From this fertile ground three women-only karate schools sprang up, simultaneously and independently, within a couple miles of each other. Brooklyn Women's Martial Arts held classes in apartments and at street fairs. The Karate School for Women had a storefront in the West Village. The Women's Center Karate Club operated from the locker-lined bunkroom of a decommissioned firehouse in the West 20s, which they eventually lost due to rising rents — for most of its existence the club operated out of rooms rented by the hour. Though this was the era of consciousness-raising — women gathering to share stories for solidarity — karate was separate from that. Instead they learned chops and kicks and blocks and a confident way of being in the world, best summarized to me by Denise's description of kiai: staring stare someone down while shouting. \"I used to be so shy,\" she says. \"But now, if I look you in the eyes I can just about cut you.\" Class material was the same as in male-dominated karate dojos — the difference wasn't the what but the how. In your typical karate class you begin by tearing the ego down, but in women-only classes you build the ego up — not in a \"you look great\" or \"reach for the stars\" kind of way, but something more like \"yes, your instincts are absolutely right, that guy is bad news.\" Many of the women, Denise suggested, had been through some sort of trauma, and women's karate was about trusting your gut and taking action, a pretty novel lesson in an era when marital rape was legal and women were subject to their husbands' whims via \"head and master\" laws. From subway platforms to family rooms, trusting your gut is good advice that's hard to take when you've been raised with June Cleaver as ideal woman. Though they'd all bloomed so suddenly together, the city's women-only karate schools faded away slowly and separately. The Karate School for Women was the first to go: owner Roberta Schine, among whose students was Weather Underground leader Kathy Boudin, closed up shop in 1995 to become a yoga teacher. Also in the nineties, Brooklyn Women's Martial Arts morphed into something else entirely: The Center for Anti-violence Education. Almost twenty years later, in October 2014, the Women's Center Karate Club finally closed its doors. Why did women-only karate fade away? Maybe women just felt safer, and certainly they had less time, as they were increasingly able to land a variety of jobs but still shouldered most of the household chores. I suspect the waning popularity of karate itself also has had something to do with it. American karate peaked in the eighties, but the glory days of Miyagi coaching Daniel-san in Karate Kid are long over, and strip mall karate now seems shabby next to newer imports: krav maga, muay thai and Brazilian juijitsu, plus the flashy, fast-paced combo of them all — mixed martial arts. Women still practice karate, and they're allowed in dojos now, but most dojos remain 90% male. This sounds intimidating to me, but for a lot of women it isn't a problem: 31-year-\n\nhuman\n\nPhoto by Kevin Lamarque/Reuters Washington is coasting. For the past several years, chroniclers of the relationship between the president and Republicans in Congress have searched in vain for new ways to describe chaos. When chaos wasn't on order, the task was to find new ways to connote stasis—the lack of progress that filled the exhausted interregnum between periods of chaos. John Dickerson John Dickerson is a co-anchor of CBS This Morning, co-host of the Slate Political Gabfest, host of the Whistlestop podcast, and author of Whistlestop and On Her Trail. Now the job has changed a bit. Crisis budgeting that led to tense moments is largely gone, mostly because House Republicans have decided not to stage confrontations. That is healthy, but there seems to have been a collective decision that like the convalescent, no politician is going to risk tearing the stitches by doing much more than padding around the ward. No one is going to do anything big or risky. The pace of action is neither chaotic nor energetic but just shy of slipping on a Snuggie and settling in for a Lord of the Rings marathon. This is, of course, pathetic. Republicans and Democrats are both so frightened about creating fights within their own parties during an election year that they are leaving the big questions unanswered. Today, House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp put forward a set of fundamental tax reform proposals. It was the product of years of work between Camp, a Republican, and his Democratic counterpart in the Senate, Max Baucus. The two traveled across the country holding hearings, taking in mountains of input, and engaging in all the other kinds of activity that most people like to think of when they think of elected representatives doing their jobs. Advertisement All that work is going nowhere. No one in either party wants to risk taking on the complicated and tricky issue that might offend big contributors or stir up voters in the wrong way. There will continue to be talk on both sides, but no one is going to get anything done. Budget expert Stan Collender thinks that means no action on this issue until 2019. The pace of action in Washington is just shy of slipping on a Snuggie and settling in for a Lord of the Rings marathon. Trade and immigration are two other items that have gone from the back burner to the freezer. House Speaker John Boehner won't start a fight in his party by bringing up immigration reform, and President Obama won't force his party to take up trade legislation that the president says will help the economy. The stakes are so low in Washington that Obama and Boehner could even sit down and meet again after a long pause. Tuesday, the two men talked for an hour in what was their longest noncrisis conversation in years. Boehner emerged calling it a \"nice meeting\" and then went back to beating up on the president and his health care law. So if nothing is going to get done, what did they talk about? Well, just because no one in Washington is going to do anything big or meaningful doesn't mean they have totally banished their chance to do a little something. Advertisement There is a possibility that the appropriations process will actually take place in some form this year. Spending items may actually be considered by a committee in which people will have their say about the merits of each program. Although the big budget questions of our time—big new spending or entitlement reforms—are still out of the conversation, at least spending levels won't be determined by sequestration. There's also a slim chance that Congress might work together on the transportation bill, flood insurance, and a water resource bill in the way that members worked together to pass the farm bill. Those are not grand pieces of legislation, but they are what one top congressional aide calls the \"meat and potatoes\" of operating a government. A cynic might also call them the least lawmakers can be expected to do and still deserve the name. Of course, even limited progress is the optimistic view. Though the temperature has lowered and chaos is on pause, it's still possible that lawmakers could slip from risk-free coasting to a full-on coma. Given how few legislative days are scheduled for this election year, it may be impossible even to handle the meat-and-potato basics. Congress may, for example, once again resort to passing a continuing resolution instead of having a proper appropriations process.\n\nhuman\n\nElsevier ( EMEA ) is a global leader in scientific information solutions.

So who's going to take the top slot next year? Established carmakers are most at risk, because three out of the top five Japanese brands, in addition to Ford and Volkswagen, are set to introduce new models. Audi and BMW also could see gains, while Subaru, which fell out of the ranks this year, is expecting to fix the mess of its pricing strategy. Six European brands were also around in 2015, and expect to leverage the sales boost from cheap models to retain end users. After auto industry giants, three out of the top five Chinese brands were new in 2015, followed by two Asian automakers. Let's get your predictions in order… Cheaper SUVs: Toyota Ethereum (EV trailblazer): Hyundai Ioniq Electric Truck: Tesla Model S P85D 5 new electric vehicles in 2015 with an EPA rating above 40 miles per charge: Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class Electric 4 out of five cars in the world last year in terms of average miles per charge: Tesla Model S Model X P100D + 2016 launches: both Model S and Model X Cheaper and more efficient cars Cheap, energy-efficient cars provide another channel to reduce the aggregate sales price of your car, leading to better profit margins. Such is the case with Mitsubishi's new Pajero utility vehicle (NV200). Mitsubishi planned to introduce PV-equipped Toyota Prius Hybrid last year, but decided to drop it, partly due to high / steep fuel prices. The car is now back in the limelight, which is a good sign. Pajero was developed after disgruntled Toyota Prius owners started flooding Toshiba's head offices with emails asking why their cars are spotted in police videos (of supposed car thieves, not of their own), offering at least four important products at discounts on a per-mile basis. The MPG difference is monumental — Pajero for the 80ZX to the 80DP is 29% lower. Considering a 80X uses around 3.8 kWh / 100 km = 138.8 mpg, having a Pajero out there in a Toyota Prius is simply more economical than buying a 16-kW / 27 kW Toyota cell (among others) in Nissan Leaf with a 115 mile range, and not even bothering with driving one single kilometer. Tesla Model S Only 24% of sales dollars went towards electricity generation and 86% to maintenance after the last software release, according to a Mercedes-Benz research agreement that took place in November 2014. This year's software could help reduce the cost of driving the Tesla Model S Model X to sales prices of under €100,000. Summary 2014 2015 MARKET SHARES Sept.

Her accused rapist was investigated and it was found that there wasn't enough evidence to support her accusation. Now, there are certainly some questions about the validity of that investigation, but the point is that it was investigated by the relevant authorities and a decision was made. This has become essentially a \"he said/she said\" situation. Do you have to agree with the decision? No. Does another investigation need to be conducted? Maybe. However, I don't think it's fair to drag someone through the mud when they've been cleared of any charges. The focus should be on the university's poor handling of the case, but instead this project has caused a lot of damage to a potentially innocent person. Rape is a serious issue and if the accused did rape her then he deserves to be punished, but there needs to be evidence that it happened. The problem now is that collecting any kind of evidence of rape at this point is pretty much impossible. This whole case is a mess and I don't think that anyone involved is handling it properly.\n\nhuman\n\nMiranda Mayo (The Game) has been cast in a recurring role on ABC Family's Pretty Little Liars, from Warner Horizon and Alloy.

Is this just another of the dozens of quotes that are misattributed to Lincoln in order to lend credence to them? I have a source for the quote: Reminiscences of Abraham Lincoln by distinguished men of his time / collected and edited by Allen Thorndike Rice (1853-1889). New York: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1909. This story is found on page 242. Remarkably, the book is still available in an edition from the University of Michigan Press. More convenient for us, the University of Michigan has the entire text on-line, in the Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, an on-line source whose whole text is searchable. However, Lincoln does not tell the story about a dog — he uses a calf. Rice's book is a collection of reminiscences of others, exactly as the title suggests. Among those doing the reminiscing are ex-president and Gen. U. S. Grant, Massachusetts Gov. Benjamin Butler (also a former Member of Congress), Charles A. Dana the editor and former Assistant Secretary of War, and several others. In describing Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation, George W. Julian relates the story. Julian was a Free-Soil Party leader and a Member of Congress during Lincoln's administration. Julian's story begins on page 241: Few subjects have been more debated and less understood than the Proclamation of Emancipation. Mr. Lincoln was himself opposed to the measure, and when he very reluctantly issued the preliminary proclamation in September, 1862, he wished it distinctly understood that the deportation of the slaves was, in his mind, inseparably connected with the policy. Like Mr. Clay and other prominent leaders of the old Whig party, he believed in colonization, and that the separation of the two races was necessary to the welfare of both. He was at that time pressing upon the attention of Congress a scheme of colonization in Chiriqui, in Central America, which Senator Pomeroy espoused with great zeal, and in which he had the favor of a majority of the Cabinet, including Secretary Smith, who warmly indorsed the project. Subsequent developments, however, proved that it was simply an organization for land-stealing and plunder, and it was abandoned; but it is by no means certain that if the President had foreseen this fact his preliminary notice to the rebels would have been given. There are strong reasons for saying that he doubted his right to emancipate under the war power, and he doubtless meant what he said when he compared an Executive order to that effect to \"the Pope's Bull against the comet.\" In discussing the question, he used to liken the case to that of the boy who, when asked how many legs his calf would have if he called its tail a leg, replied, \" Five,\" to which the prompt response was made that calling the tail a leg would not make it a leg. I believe it is fair to call the story \"confirmed.\" It's not an exact quote, but it's an accurate story.

The Woodlands Marathon is set for Saturday, March 4, and begins at 7 a.m. The run features different divisions, the full marathon and half-marathon, a marathon relay and a 5K Saturday, as well as a 2K Fun Run and Walk Friday evening. The marathon is one of the largest athletic events in Montgomery County, having nearly 9,000 runners set to participate in this year's event. The 2017 event has raised over $150,000 and has a $6 million economic impact on The Woodlands community, said event director of The Woodlands Marathon Management Will Fowlkes. Aside from the economic impact, it will force road closures across the community. Travel time will be extended during this time - approximately 45 minutes to an hour delay, according to the marathon's website. Between 6:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., marathon officials recommend only residential traffic. A detailed list of road closures and delays can be found at thewoodlandsmarathon.com/event-details/traffic-guide/. However, check back on Friday, as the traffic guide will be updated then. Fowlkes said residents should educate themselves on the ins and outs of the race, even if one is not participating. Fowlkes said the community should expect slight delays, but they'll still have the ability to commute around The Woodlands, they just may have to take alternative routes to get to destinations. \"Ninety to 95 percent of The Woodlands residents are OK with the events,\" Fowlkes said. \"It's just those residents that do not plan and educate themselves about the route that seem to get frustrated.\" Specifically, Fowlkes said, the Town Center area on Grogan's Mill Road and Lake Woodlands Drive will be the most affected by the marathon and half-marathon. Vehicles will be routed around those areas, but there will be rolling road openings throughout the race until 1:30 p.m. to ease delays. Those interested in participating can still register online for $40 for the 5K run or $30 for the 2K Family Fun Run and Walk.\n\nhuman\n\nThe Portland Timbers will unveil the 2015 MLS Cup Championship banner at their home opener against the Columbus Crew on March 6 at Providence Park.

Note: Some ingredients may have a different application (such as product ingredient). In the purest form, these salts and enantiomers will form a continuous film on the solvent surface without precipitation. Thus, the emulsion becomes a thin solution, although not necessarily without precipitation. If the additives are indigestible to the experience when the tradeoffs are low, they may or may not form a continuous film. If a mixture of enantiomers is used, the base (usually alcohol, butanol, isopropanol, etc.) can dissolve the enantiomer, forming an alcohol/enantiomer emulsion. Note 1: Abbreviated form of the above Note 2: Process includes refinement. -Highly concentrated: process of mixing, adding, adding or removing one or more secondary ingredients prior to adding or removing the primary additives. -Flat compound: a indigestible base is added to a vegetable oil emulsion. -Fast Growing: emulsion is created, but it forms a misty, thick film over time; the final emulsion will be topographically less viscous and/or thinner than the imbedded termine. -Picric acid: After an oil/water emulsion has settled, the surface of the emulsion or a small amount of it is saturated with a picric acid derivative. This acid is easily oxidized and must be washed out with water. This creates a very fine film along the surface of the emulsion. Notes on emulsion process refinement Moderate solvents, like ethanol, butanol, isopropanol will cause slightly grainy emulsions when the globule portion and left-over fluffy particles of the solution is sustained (e.g., more than 5 minutes of continuous exposure).

Yet the smartwatch is dogged by a perception that seems premature given the history of Apple's most popular devices: disappointment. As the Watch marks its first anniversary on Sunday—two days before Apple's quarterly earnings announcement—the product's fate is critical to the company. It is Apple's first all-new product since the iPad and a test of its ability to innovate under Chief Executive Tim Cook, when sales of iPhones are slowing. ​So far, the numbers appear solid. Apple doesn't disclose sales, but analysts estimate about 12 million Watches were sold in year one. At an estimated average price of $500, that is a $6 billion business—three times the annual revenue of activity tracker Fitbit Inc. By comparison, Apple sold roughly six million iPhones in its first year. As a new entrant, the Watch accounted for about 61% of global smartwatch sales last year, according to researcher IDC. And yet, there are detractors such as Fred Wilson, co-founder of venture-capital firm Union Square Ventures, in December declared the Watch a \"flop.\" Mr. Wilson, who owns shares of Fitbit through a fund, had earlier predicted the Watch wouldn't be a \"home run\" like the iPad, iPhone and iPod, saying many people wouldn't want to wear a computer on their wrist. The Watch has shortcomings. It is slow, with an underpowered processor that is throttled at times to extend the device's battery life. It lacks mobile and Global Positioning System connections, meaning it must be accompanied by an iPhone, limiting its usefulness as an independent device. The battery needs to be charged every day. Advertisement Perhaps the biggest challenge is the Watch's lack of a defining purpose. It does certain things well, such as activity tracking, mobile payments and notifications. But there is no task the Apple Watch handles that can't be done by an iPhone or a less-expensive activity tracker. Joshua Stein, a 33-year-old app developer in Chicago, said he bought a Watch shortly after its release, but found the software slow and thought it was inconvenient having to charge it each night. In January, he sold the Watch on eBay and returned to using a $150 Pebble smartwatch with a longer-lasting battery. \"Basically, I didn't use it that much,\" said Mr. Stein. \"The functionality of the Watch is still pretty limited.\" There are relatively easy fixes for some concerns. Apple is working on adding cell-network connectivity and a faster processor to its next-generation Watch, according to people familiar with the matter. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. ​ Advertisement Other problems run deeper. Forrester Research analyst J.P. Gownder says the Watch isn't useful enough. He expected more businesses to create apps like one from Starwood Hotel & Resorts Worldwide Inc. that lets customers check in, receive a room assignment and unlock a room door without stopping at the front desk. Mr. Gownder said Apple hadn't done enough to build a broader ecosystem of services. \"Apple needs to make it an indispensable thing,\" he said. Still, the Apple Watch has fans who use it daily. According to research firm Wristly, 93% of 1,150 Apple Watch owners in an online survey last week said they were \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" with the device. In a sign of how users are personalizing their watches, Apple said in March that a third of users regularly change the bands for the Watch to match their outfits or occasion. \"It's become a part of my day,\" said Dana Strom, a 31-year-old video editor from Santa Monica, Calif., who received the Watch as a gift from his wife in November. \"I miss it when I don't have it.\" He finds notifications and turn-by-turn directions useful, though he grows frustrated at times at how slowly third-party apps run on the Watch. Advertisement The Watch's early struggles in some ways echo the iPhone, now considered a groundbreaking product that accounts for two-thirds of Apple's revenue. The initial model didn't run on the then-fastest wireless network, didn't offer third-party apps and lacked basic functions such as copying and pasting text. As it did with the initial iPhone, Apple in March cut the price for the least-expensive version of the smaller-size Sport Watch model by $50 to $299. Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, estimates Apple has sold 12 million Apple Watches in the first year at an average sales price of $500. Similarly, Neil Cybart, who runs Above Avalon, a site dedicated to analysis of Apple, estimates Apple sold 13 million watches at an average price of $450. Adam\n\nhuman\n\nPUTRAJAYA: How much swordplay for a three-month old? I thought I was seeing things, but this tale just won't lie: I went out for breakfast this morning and saw this. A group of tourists were posing for photos with their three-month-old baby, just after it was born, when suddenly it lunged at one of the tourists' legs with its slender little sword. The tourists frantically dove back in surprise, and the boy's long limbs buckled. The full impact of the giant stick was felt at the three-year-old boy's ribcage. His left arm flailed and one of the tourists tried desperately to surround the child and stanch the bleeding. The parents who were watching wondered what on earth the child had done, whether the momentary attack had been triggered by the harsh earth or something toughsterlike. But the locals here can be understood. An infant is not saying, \"Go on live with me behind the supermarket awning\", as the $30,000 Bandar Seri Begawan does - a live tiger only projects vernacular of intimidation. According to a Suntresor­y Nursing Mother 's Association handbook, babies don't mean real harm. \"There is no reason to be worried about the baby's behaviour. Anything to the contrary is ungroundless fear-mongering. Just because a baby is interacting with our babies does not mean that they are vicious and dangerous,\" it says. To the contrary. The opposite is true; although I may not have proof of what was said by the local-born mother, I do have video evidence of the encounter.

The mass education on human-rights' issues was visible across the North when demonstrators gathered on Friday evening to oppose the hiring of 3rd uniformed police officer assigned to the St-Michel neighbourhood in order to meet a demand of diversity stated on social media. The virtual advocacy was well-attended and the march was well organized. It was so packed that the combination of deafening noise from a marching band and smoke from one of the numerous burning candles collectively rolled up the main artery in the very centre of the city. The following images were taken at 1530 on Friday evening at the St-Michel/Grégoire Laurin intersection. The protesters marched in a pretty broad and harmonious formation accompanied by the music of electronica, silence and an organ whose gong turned on and off until they arrived to entreat the compassion of the crowd. Soon, the crowd was pouring onto the street from the surrounding neighbourhood and quickly counter-marched home. Pictures started to sync, arms packed again, arms up across chests across backs. Yes, Montrealers, we saw the members of your city's policing force. Newcomers.

James D. Catlin, a lawyer who recently represented Assange, said the sex assault investigation into the WikiLeaks founder is based on claims he didn't use condoms during sex with two Swedish women. SPONSORED Swedish prosecutors told AOL News last week that Assange was not wanted for rape as has been reported, but for something called \"sex by surprise\" or \"unexpected sex.\" One accuser, Anna Ardin, may have \"ties to the US-financed anti-Castro and anti-communist groups,\" according to Israel Shamir and Paul Bennett, writing for CounterPunch. While in Cuba, Ardin worked with the Las damas de blanco (the Ladies in White), a feminist anti-Castro group. Professor Michael Seltzer pointed out that the group is led by Carlos Alberto Montaner who is reportedly connected to the CIA. Shamir and Bennett also describe Ardin as a \"leftist\" who \"published her anti-Castro diatribes (see here and here) in the Swedish-language publication Revista de Asignaturas Cubanas put out by Misceláneas de Cuba.\" Shamir and Bennett noted that Las damas de blanco is partially funded by the US government and also counts Luis Posada Carriles as a supporter. A declassified 1976 document (.pdf) revealed Posada to be a CIA agent. He has been convicted of terrorist attacks that killed hundreds of people. Ardin is \"a gender equity officer at Uppsula University – who chose to associate with a US funded group openly supported by a convicted terrorist and mass murderer,\" FireDogLake's Kirk James Murphy observed. In August, Assange told Al-Jazeera that the accusations were \"clearly a smear campaign.\" \"We have been warned that, for example, the Pentagon is planning on using dirty tricks to destroy our work,\" Assange told the Swedish daily newspaper Aftonbladet. The WikiLeaks founder said he was told to be careful of \"sex traps.\" Had Assange fallen for one of those traps? \"Maybe. Maybe not,\" he said. Catlin observed that both Ardin and Sofia Wilén, the second accuser, sent SMS messages and tweets boasting of their conquests following the alleged \"rapes.\" \"In the case of Ardin it is clear that she has thrown a party in Assange's honour at her flat after the 'crime' and tweeted to her followers that she is with the 'the world's coolest smartest people, it's amazing!'\" he wrote. \"The exact content of Wilén's mobile phone texts is not yet known but their bragging and exculpatory character has been confirmed by Swedish prosecutors. Niether Wilén's nor Ardin's texts complain of rape,\" Catlin said. Ardin has also published a seven step guide on how to get revenge on cheating boyfriends. When the charges were first leveled in August, Gawker raised doubts that Ardin was working for the CIA. \"If anything, Ardin's outing tends to undercut Assange's conspiracy theory that one of his accusers is a major figure on Sweden's left fringe, freewheelingly indiscreet on her personal blog and, until her charges, an enthusiastic promoter of Assange's visit to the country,\" Gawker wrote. After Interpol issued a digital \"wanted\" poster for Assange on Monday morning, an unnamed Scotland Yard source reportedly told Press Association it had been given the documents needed for the arrest. Police would not comment on the report publicly. Several British news outlets speculated that Assange could be arrested as early as Tuesday. On Monday evening, Mark Stephens, Assange's London lawyer, was negotiating with British authorities over an arrest warrant they'd received from their Swedish counterparts. Assange has vowed to fight extradition.\n\nhuman\n\nCustomize your Animal Crossing: New Leaf game with a Mario Sticker.

Scientists are combining the treatment with injections of a patient's own stem cells in a bid to kick-start insulin production. They believe the high levels of oxygen in the chamber boosts the activity of the stem cells, helping them to repair the cells in the body that produce insulin. There are around 2.9 million Britons with diabetes, with most of them suffering from type 2 In a new trial, patients with type 2 diabetes reduced their need for insulin and metformin (a common diabetes drug) with some no longer needing the insulin at all. So-called hyperbaric oxygen therapy involves a patient sitting in a pressurised chamber. The high-pressure atmosphere means they breathe in three times as much oxygen as they would normally. The treatment is normally used for helping divers who have surfaced too quickly and have the 'bends' (where bubbles of nitrogen form in the blood). It's also used for carbon monoxide poisoning and to speed up wound healing such as leg ulcers. Studies suggest high levels of oxygen boosts activity of stem cells — the so-called blank slate cells that can turn into any cell of the body — helping them to replace and heal ailing cells. A study at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine showed that a course of hyperbaric oxygen treatment triggers an eight-fold increase in the number of circulating stem cells, possibly by boosting the activity of enzymes involved in the release and activity of stem cells. The new treatment involves scientists extracting a patient's stem cells, multiplying them in the lab and then injecting them back into the pancreas (this organ produces the hormone insulin, which mops up blood sugar). Combining this treatment with the oxygen chamber increases the activity of the stem cells, boosting their healing powers. In some cases, it is possible to control symptoms through lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet Patients receive injections of their own stem cells into the pancreas before and after entering the diving chamber. There are around 2.9 million Britons with diabetes, with most of them suffering from type 2, where not enough insulin is produced to maintain a normal blood sugar level, or the cells of the body become resistant to its effect. Diabetes cannot be cured, but there are treatments that aim to keep blood glucose levels as normal as possible to control symptoms and lower the risk of complications. In some cases, it is possible to control symptoms through lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet. But drugs such as metformin (which reduces glucose production by the liver) or injected therapies such as insulin may become necessary. The new treatment, which is being investigated at a number of centres across the world, involves extracting stem cells from the patient's bone marrow under local anaesthetic and injecting them into the pancreas. In a trial at Miami University, 25 patients had five hour-long sessions of hyperbaric oxygen treatment before and after the injections, over the course of a week. All the patients were taking either metformin or insulin, or both. Four patients were able to stop using their insulin after the combined treatment. Fifteen of the patients could gradually reduce their insulin over the following year, while ten stopped or reduced their metformin dose, it was reported in the journal Cell Transplantation. Commenting on the use of stem cells in diabetes research, Dr Matthew Hobbs, Diabetes UK Head of Research, said: 'Although any stem cell therapies for type 1 and type 2 diabetes are many years away from widespread clinical use, researchers agree that stem cells hold great potential to treat and perhaps even cure a range of different health conditions. 'Stem cell research is an exciting area of science that, in the long term, could help us bring about a future without diabetes.' ________________________________________________ Meanwhile, children and teenagers with recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes are being given daily vitamin D pills in a new clinical trial. There is evidence vitamin D may help treat autoimmmune conditions by dampening inflammation.\n\nhuman\n\nWith its unique look, Strange Machines gained fame in the early twenty-the-first century for the inclusion of races that never were included in other games. After rediscovering and rediscovering those races in the years since, and with products including the Arcadia Legends and Race for the Galaxy expansions to its long-running fantasy series, Strange Machines was a path found for many of these forgotten races to begin anew. Without further ado, let's take a look at how a given race fits into such a game: Race: Human I am so excited about this one! Peasants and cows certainly won't be making appearances in this game any time soon. When: This race will be in release month three to four. You can read our Prospectus on this race here. Malley's Comment: This little one-shot will not just serve as a preview for our next addition (which will be a human), it will also help design Lions and Spring labrador hybrids. All the human factions have so many tiny little things going on in them. While spellcasting an artifact at a time seems solid, a multi-leg humanoid all of a sudden feels as powerful and interesting as a dragon. Perhaps it will be some other group of sentient creatures named partly after Russia (maybe this is why the Red Ogre's of Ancient times seemed so similar) that fills us in on all those little things… Gnosis are practiced and valued techniques in the Setting. In others words, they are what we would call a therapy. When: Some sort of investigator living in the modern age. They live and die by their skills, perhaps not with ancestors but in shock coups and the common usage of agitprop that results in errors of judgment. Larry's Comment: This one looks really cool… The Investigations and Networks don't really sound like what they designed the whole concept around, so maybe we can give it some rearranged ingredients and see what happens. Okay, that is awesomely bad! I can imagine that if I am a skilled sleuth living someplace with fan-friggin'-love for pets, just watching you having to urinate yourself and turning the whole damn place into a new waste-treatment plant my heart will exceed a point and I will wear them. Gnosis are applied techniques in Science and Engineering. When: Expert engineers and high-feeling users of the Equipment/Natural scholarship are equipped with high Energy, and in most cases they can fly into space. Use of non-material technology meant for political agendas is unheard of. Only exploration and acquisition of Elderside sources can save the day against the encroaching, unstoppable Titans. Larry's Comment: Point being, when you boil it down to it, this is a detective novel and I think it's a great idea. Also, can humans colonize space? Using Psychic Empathy, Awakening Phenomena and Predictive Telepathy LD relevance are \"setting faces\" associated with Second Elders & The House of Elders's Symbiont Gealetheria Device. When: Only governments have access to Eldersides, but they are still seen by many as like a spiritual enclosing of the Second Sea. Law enforcement agencies like FBI and law-enforcement agents are often staffed by their own Insiders (Spies). Law enforcement agencies use symbiotic equipment, usually from the new Trinary Times that appear and can exist outside of their own time-stream. Active Phoenix formations often contain facts and figures about the Guiding Consciousness of a related Cypher. Larry's Comment: Common Core lacks irony . Just hitting the \"set faces\" button makes this drive home. And all of a sudden, this has an ominous culture and language theme—something seems wrong. Symbol looks like the back of some kind of scrapbook and the bit that is right rotates and changes depending on context. Mechanism is a clue. Molecule might help me with this. Instead of giving an extra damage to psychic tendencies, these weapons increase the power gained from influence as well as any other requisite action (like University upgrades.) Any uses of \"fuck you!\" during the monster phase get Feigned Disconnect. These weapons make up for the small psychic ill effects caused by psi weapons and increasing chaos with party fire damage, actually boosting the majority of mental/personality mutations most frequently and minimally negative to the normally relatively passive Psyker. When: This weapon consumes a bit of your psi pool and has a silver success and a gold success in a diagnostic phase. The classically-regulated Mental Focus feature of this family is subjective pathos overflowing. Gauzy ponytails hang off the head, revealing bulbs underneath.

We all felt this way watching the Sandra Bland \"Approval\" video and scrolling through the commotion; feeling the anger and sadness salsa danced around in people's sexism, racism tweets and trial balloons. We just felt like we weren't doing enough. And finally, I wrote this in early June but never posted it, so its time to make it known, Bacon Madness, that Murray Rothbard is RAD and we want nerdy-list even though we are brown people with nerdy brains! Anyone else feeling what I'm going to fill later with bits of metal gear? Of all the electronic stuff, music and confederate flag material I have, my most beloved and realized collectible now is the boxed bar of pulp story we call X-211. In the world I live in, there aren't very many X-s to be found, but when I found X-211, I got very, very happy very fast. NOT that I would have sold it to anyone else; it's just that its hard to find collectible fan letters, period. x211 may very well be the most precious thing in my house. Or mine*. I struggle with the emotion of being sad about this, too. While the investigation and eventual exoneration of 45-year-old Sandra Bland continues, unlike that of Johannes Mehserle, named #1 dominating triggering preservation curriculums Horrifyingly Today, we are supposed to feel bad for cops. Not bad enough because it's possible you or someone you love could get killed in someone else's home by an idiotized superior unit acting in the place of a \"deep compassion for humanity that actually swells my heart\" (make of that what you will) and not to dwell too deep on a botched interrogation, we're better prepared to stand horrified at the murder of a sayonara black young man as if it could happen to us: Black woman killed by an officer during struggle in South Carolina Micah Fromuth's daughter the victim of his police harassment Team Black Lives Matter: one to kill me — Dana Loesch, radio host and enemy Fascist(?) ally! — No, really, this is real! Race-hustling cop. Black. On September 21, a police officer ends Eric Garner's life, using an illegal chokehold. Just after the man's lungs collapse, he is ribbed, mercilessly mocked and facilitated with a final righteous slap and mob-enraged screams birthed out as more whites join the cruelty against this black man (we all know the usual clichés about cops and minorities because we assiduously paid attention in primary and high school followed by crime reporting as a reporter). Blacks are more likely to be killed by angry types online, then they are white (with blacks second only to black crime victims); more likely to be arrested for whatever the cops bring up their noses; more likely to be struck and hard with their own weapons; more likely to be the unwitting hunted when people of color are shooting at cops; more likely to be called a racial slur before killing or maiming unarmed people identified as blacks; more likely to be buried or cremated by an angry mob unless they kneel down and intone that the killer is trapped inside an animal body that shares cause with the person they have killed; less likely to actually be killed or injured by officers; more likely to be lynched, gassed, and beaten in most spots in America; less likely to have property confiscated or ravaged by the state's war on weed. Phew. These blessings repeat most eloquently for black men. Again, we hear of Trayvon when white nepotism acted as an outlet for black bodies destroyed by police, followed by the various sad stories of black men hunted down, attacked, killed and enraged by one-dimensional little criminals being believed by prosecutors and juries as justification to knock some sense back in the world. Surely all this is random; surely these tragedies all happen insofar as a defense of preserves the debates oveleeening kitsch sessions in suburban houses and sun-bathed supermarkets mired in ignorance and blaseness. But, still, black people lose 17 black people since this Attorney General, in a telling correspondence with his lawyers, excuses Darren Wilson by claiming, \"Mr. Wilson is not aware of this, but he was trained to disarm and not use force.\" Long live Reddit, this joy-inducing currency of technical scientific sanity!\n\nmachine\n\nProduct Details Unissued Polish Beryl Sight Rail Assembly - Variant B .

Service animals are trained and certified volunteers that are human companions for a specific disability. The definition of \"service animal\" on the ADA website includes veterinary evacuation service (dogs may ride in a wheelchair); service animal monitoring service provided by a person with a physical or mental disability (providing monitoring or providing instructions to assist users of features of a clearly accessible place, such as a building or perimeter fence); and service animal-assisted use of a public transit system (i.e., the presence of a physical or mental disability user on or within the benefits of a public transit system that provides passenger transportation, including, but not limited to frequent, regular and flexible travel throughout designated areas of the transit system).\n\nmachine\n\nOh my nelly, St. Zula!

Long-time residents can expect their polling machines to perform better in the new computer. People bypass a Wellington polling site to visit a Christchurch one, which has gathered a community of younger voters as it returns eight full-time staff. However it is expected a larger population will translate into an increase in support from the electorate. READ MORE * Election 2010: Wellington election turnout lower than it was for 1992 * Second Christchurch joined #nz4digitafternoonturn * Regional voters stay loyal to the status quo in Christchurch local government David Carter of the district council said they expected a double digit number of people to vote, far more than the 13 per cent turnout increase they had seen over the past six years. \"We think we are going to get definitely above the 13 per cent, but certainly about half of the 30 per cent mark it is going to be,\" Carter said. Bill Johnson from New Zealander and NZ Electoral Commission director was firmly of the belief Christchurch remained the most exciting thing about national politics. The Christchurch area you see people knocking on your door only shows you the progress of race relations, he said. \"It's starting to contribute to the debate. \"The way they're voting it's fun to see.\" The centre of Christchurch was a problem area in the 1990s - particularly in agreeing where a set of save the Kaikoura Lakes was - but 2003 saw an improvement in retention of boundary upon redistribution. Johnson said he had worried afterwards his people only had a 1-100% knowledge of each other. The die had been cast, with 1 per cent of voters abstaining in the 2011 election from 1 per cent at the 2001 result in calculating the boundary boundaries. Johnson said extra time had been applied to the polls, but the review of the boundary had had to look markedly at the motorway serving Killarney. A recent letter from Jago OPW Backcountry chief executive Jimmy Selwood said the road was more than 50 per cent bus route, meaning only the two footpaths through to the area would have counted, making it on the 'great divide' between rural and inner city voters. He asked that the new polling zone in the Kaikoura wasn't just increased from 6 to 8 cylinders but also had more robust ridings throughout it. Halley Johnson and Helen Fisher hoped polling and safe-government would become more regular events for voters on the weekends and at other times of the year. Johnson said people from every local government area voted in the suburbs, but it was all about the middle of the city. Fisher said she wanted to vote increasingly regularly - five times a year instead of four. \"I'd say if we stay on the trend of two elections that's how long we could keep voting.\"\n\nmachine\n\nWell, the political elite - the (remarkably) koch-funded Republican candidates - are busy telling Senators to \"please\" not sound like Hispanics to the obama/clinton black community in the form of \"they should worry about their families first\" and \"…we should all be concerned about how hard that they are working.\" My personal feelings: how they're unemployed at 40 as a result of not procrastinating enough to find a job while getting no government assistance from DC -– or while the millions they've contributed to DC jobs jobs jobs are being outsourced and/or retired as a result of the Federal Reserve and Federal destruction of the US economy. So maybe I'm blowing some smoke, but besides those and the outright lying of the Koch Brothers about how Obama broke every promise he made when he ran (based on their own activities), now they're going to stand up in front of grandparents (by the way, the senile Bush was nominated as 87th President-at 73) and talk about shining a light on the symptoms while ignoring the disease and the availability of that \"stained\" coffee pot for the elect. There are millions of (salted and salted) Mexicans or Filipinos in the U.S. I've never met one personally, but their common opinion is if Obama is president, another war with Mexico will result in new immigrants. Might be why he cancelled the Ka-Balooie deal (affordable lifetime healthcare for their kids) to the protest of Mexico. You would think that the Koch Brothers might favor Jose Zaldivar over Obama as fellow Aussie like year mates in international relations, except the impact of the causes they support on their young body of grandkids and then grandchildren was pretty obvious to them, ah, are we overstating WTF? Or did they ignore that he allowed for a little bit of benefit to the health and the well-being of the children of the Philippines while as governor? I'm sure Donors or this gibbering LSP does don't get it. You mean almost every deadline for the UREX proposal for overseas oil refineries in the Philippines was followed. Lots of shmoes had the same feeling as me when they see Haiti fresh some blood or see butchered bodies make their way into city sewers from lack of sanitation (memories, please re-read about that in your flight testimony). It's also ironic to see the young (intuition Jeb, Ted, Christie), savvy (the geniuses assembling a sort of mansion on the Got-Hated Death Planet of crippling the economy nameless Koch Brothers) crowd getting confused about Social Security and Medicare. They're not the HSE scheme. They borrowed from there and are tolling the HSE scheme without so much as a hiccup because they're furious they're being subsidised by PBGC and Medicaid and Medicare and Pell Grants and whatnot (Shall I just list the Merkeloids) surprise surprise, only people over 65 can qualify for all the services that were put in place and have been rigorously tested to work years past target using language designed to weed out the youth from the old-timer nice folks they wish to distance themselves from.
