        "text": "This book was published in 1843 at a time when the first of his letters was not yet found anywhere.\n\nIt seems that the missing first letter was found by 1905 and was published in two volumes containing all five letters. These books are named \"Letters of Cortes\" I don't know what to do with the first one. Personally, I think that it should be deleted.\n\nYour input is most appreciated.— Ineuw talk\n\nWikisource can accommodate multiple editions of a work. The 1843 could stay, but it would certainly be lower priority if the later edition is the same, just with the extra letter. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\nThanks again.— Ineuw talk\n\nIncidentally, I would go further and assert that every edition should be on Wikisource; it's just that given limited resources, only the \"best\" edition may be a realistic goal. --Xover (talk)\n\nThe Agatha books are \" copyrighted in the USA till 2019 \" . I do not live in the U.S , and 2019 has arrived ; Then why are the links not there ? 182.66.156.165\n\nBecause they are not out of copyright outside the US, Christie died in 1976, by current copyright rules, her work will not leave copyright until 2047 at the earliest, (irrespective of the situation in the US). ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nAddendum: Links and texts do not magically appear because of a date change. For a text to be available on Wikisource, a volunteer has to proofread a copy of the text and add it to Wikisource. That process requires someone to volunteer to do the work, and then time to accomplish the task. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\nFurther addendum: after purging the page, the list of works should show up as redlinks now. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nI'm looking at the TOC of a work that includes stories, poems, and illustrations. Handling the 'authors' is straightforward when near all have Author: entries at WS. Handling the 'illustrators' is rather more of a problem, as only one was an author. (Leighton having an author entry is strange to me).\n\nIs it reasonable to link to WP for these non-authors? For instance, w:Robert Anning Bell has a WP article, as does w:Aubrey Beardsley, w:Joseph Pennell, etc. Shenme (talk)\n\nWhy would you link to Author pages in the ToC? That would mean making external links from the ToC of a work, which the user will expect to be links internal to the work. The Author pages can be linked from the header pages of the individual items; there is no reason to link the authors from the ToC. A Table of Contents should link to parts of the work, not to external targets. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\nIntroducing a rule implying external links from a work are deprecated constitutes a statement of policy neither supported nor forbidden by our current policy. I am not saying EncycloPetey is \"wrong\" here but this is a guideline I would generally approve… yet in specific cases ignore as unrealistically restrictive. The matter needs further discussion and subsequent detailed changes to policy. 114.73.65.234\n\nYou've misunderstood my comments, and you've also pointed to the wrong policy. The relevant page is at Wikisource:Wikilinks. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\n@EncycloPetey: You are quite correct. I am still a little concerned that because Wikisource:Wikilinks links to WS:MOS but not the reverse; and the general similarity of the introductory language can lead to ambiguous interpretations. There is a fundamental conflict remaining between \"transcription purism\" and the risk of lost opportunity for the proof-reader who is closest to the work noting matters of later confusion (an author wring in 1898 referring the the \"Prince\"…could be referring to Machiavelli's work, their local royalty, current British royalty or a frivolous exaggeration but with a very high degree of certainty almost none of the possibilities listed in w:Prince (disambiguation) (or vastly worse q:Q225225!)… and it seems a shame to miss the chance of offering a clarification. This issue is intractable, yet it seems the community is happy to permit mechanical extraction of wikidata linkage into Author pages. Sad. 114.73.65.234\n\n@Shenme: the relevant documentation is Wikisource:Wikilinks and Wikisource:Annotations. EncycloPetey's recommendations are worth considering, but are not mandatory; links to pages in Author namespace are not considered annotations and can be freely added to the text at the proofreader's discretion. Links to Wikipedia are considered annotations, however, and should follow the annotation guidelines. However, Author pages for illustrators such as Author:Frederic Leighton are totally acceptable, and pages can also be created in Portal namespace for individuals who have never created any content that can be hosted on Wikisource, but for whom relevant related content exists. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nIn most situations, I would agree. Linking to Author pages from within a text, especially from footnotes or appendices, or from places where that author's works are being referenced, is a fine thing. But in linking Author pages from the Table of Contents, you are violating a user's expectations. One would normally expect links from the Table of Contents to link to parts of the work itself. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\nIt would reassure me to know that you had looked at the two example pages. Certainly the chapters/articles have links from TOC to in-work individual items. This is as expected. Someone previously had linked the authors' names in the first page. I found this useful. When seeing Leighton's name unlinked in the second page I wanted the same ability to ask \"who is this somewhat familiar name? Oh, that guy.\"\n\nThere is minimalism - what are the fewest, absolutely required things to enable reading. Anything else done is an additional benefit to some portion of 'users', or readers. A reader has some expectations against the required minimums. A reader will not be harmed by exceeding the minimums.\n\nAs an example, the work in question has a mix of articles from several authors. After A Defence of Cosmetics, I'll be glad to avoid any further works by that author. A quicker link from the TOC obviates having to go the article first, and the author link there, only to back out twice over.\n\nThis is a wiki. Wikis were to break conventions/restrictions enforced by physical media, yes? I fail to see the astonishment, much less harm, in linking attributions found in the TOC. Shenme (talk)\n\nI had looked at the two example pages, yes.\n\nExceeding the minimums can harm the reader when the excess violates expectations. And, no, wikis do not exist solely to break conventions.\n\nThe purpose of a Table of Contents is to inform the reader of the contents of that work. When the items in the ToC are linked, the expectation is that there is content in that work to which the link will take the reader. When a link in the Contents links to something other than Contents, that is a violation of expectation.\n\nIt would reassure me to know that you read and understood my comments on this issue. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\nI see there being two issues here. 1) Linking to authors/illustrators from a TOC; and 2) How to link to authors/illustrators who don't currently have a page here.\n\nFor the first, I agree with EP that TOC links that go outside of the work should be kept to a minimum. Those links belong where they appear in the text—usually, at the beginning of the subwork (remembering that they should appear in the header on the transclusion, so may not be needed in the Page: namespace).\n\nFor the second, based on the long-established policy already in situ at Help:Index pages#Parameters, Illustrators should have an Author: page. Any links required to a wikipedia can happen from that page. Beeswaxcandle (talk)\n\nIn the template Helpme, it's given that after helping, I need to insert {{tlf|helpme}}. I would like to know where the source code of that page is present.Adithyak1997 (talk)\n\n@Adithyak1997: All templates' source can be found at [[Template:Template name]] so the source code for the tlf template is at Template:tlf. However, I'm uncertain why Template:helpme recommends using it: it appears to simply be intending to remove the transclusion, presumably to remove it from the category that is automatically added. Simply removing the helpme template will have the same effect, and leaving behind the wikicode \"{{helpme}}\" seems rather pointless. Maybe it would be better to have a answered=yes parameter for this? --Xover (talk)\n\nIt's a suggestion for if you want to indicate that the Helpme template had been used, but no longer need help. {{tlf}} is just one way to do this; you could use {{tl|helpme}} or {{tlf|helpme}} or <nowiki>{{helpme}}</nowiki> or I had a [[Template:Helpme]] notice here but I don't need help any more thanks — I don't think we need to add another method with a parameter. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nAt this page over at the Portuguese Wikisource, I am wondering the best way to indent text without having an available template. I would like indentation to resemble the original. They do not yet have block center over there (nor do they have Gap), so right alignment would be too drastic. I am opting (for now) not to use the poem tag in hopes that I'll get the ball rolling at some point there to add a block center template that behaves like ours here (and spans more than one page). Any suggestions welcome. Londonjackbooks (talk)\n\nI would create a template, but in the absence of that I would probably use raw html to emulate {{gap}} <span style=\"display:inline-block; width:12em;\">​</span> or to emulate {{center block}} <div style=\"position:relative; margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto;\"></div> —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nMuito obrigada @Beleg Tâl: :) I chose the former. I'll wait until a template is created to apply block center. Londonjackbooks (talk)\n\n@Londonjackbooks: {{gap}} is all of three lines of template code, most of which is boilerplate:\n\n<onlyinclude><span style=\"display:inline-block; width:{{{1|2em}}};\">⁠</span></onlyinclude><noinclude> {{documentation}} </noinclude>\n\nYou can easily copy it over to ptws yourself (just drop the <noinclude>{{documentation}}</noinclude> if ptws lacks {{documentation}}; it doesn't affect functionality). {{center block}} is more complex, but still eminently copy and paste'able. --Xover (talk)\n\n@Xover: I am wincing over \"easily\" ;) I am technically nearly illiterate. But I have to ask... I always use {{block center}} vice center block... What are the main differences in the templates (in layman's terms)? Thanks Londonjackbooks (talk)\n\nP.S. Here's the more honest answer: I can probably figure out how to transfer the template over. I did so some years ago with a template from WS to WB with lots of help and instruction which I have since forgotten, but looking at the history now does not help me much. In the years that have passed, I may have become somewhat lazier in the brain; or at least I may lack the motivation I had then. I would require explicit instruction once again, and if anyone is willing to instruct me with much patience, I may be up to giving it a shot :) Londonjackbooks (talk)\n\nAFAIK the difference is: {{block center}} uses table styles for backwards compatibility, whereas {{center block}} uses block styles per modern web design best practices. It should look the same most of the time but it might display differently if you are playing with margins, indents, or other scenarios. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\n@Londonjackbooks: does pt:Predefinição:Bloco centro not do what you are looking for? —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\n@Beleg Tâl: No, I don't believe it can span several pages, and there are other differences I was told made it not a desirable option. I'll have to look for the discussion. Here is a mention: \"bloco centro is <div> block based while block center is table based (different HTML structure is used).\" [1] Londonjackbooks (talk)\n\n@Londonjackbooks: I have created pt:Predefinição:Bloco centro/c = {{center block/s}} and pt:Predefinição:Bloco centro/f = {{center block/e}}. Like {{center block}} it is div-block based rather than table based, which is preferable in almost all cases. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\n@Beleg Tâl: I tried applying it on this page, but I'm not seeing a desired result. I'm used to block center though... Am I doing something wrong? Londonjackbooks (talk)\n\n@Londonjackbooks: My bad, typo in template, fixed now. (Also I was wrong, bloco centro is table-based like {{block center}}) —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\n@Beleg Tâl: Great! Thanks! An undesired line space is present before the last line of poetry in each Page:namespace, but it seems to work itself out in the Main. Londonjackbooks (talk)\n\nI don't know anything about that line space, it happens to me on enWS too —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nAlso pt:Predefinição:Brecha appears to be essentially {{gap}} —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\n@Beleg Tâl: Thanks for finding that :) Londonjackbooks (talk)\n\n@Londonjackbooks: On {{block center}} vs. {{center block}} I'm not much help. They purport to do the same thing, but the former claims to do it in a technically better way. How that shakes out in practice I don't know. As for copying, I'll use {{gap}} as an example:\n\nGo to Template:gap (the page you're actually referring to when you use {{gap}}).\n\nHit \"Edit\" (or, for protected templates, \"View source\").\n\nSelect all the text in the text field and copy it.\n\nOpen pt:Predefinição:gap (or replace \"gap\" with a suitable name in Portugese. \"lacuna\" perhaps?).\n\nHit the \"Edite esta página\" link.\n\nPaste the copied template code into the text field.\n\nHit the \"Pubicar página\" button.\n\nUse {{gap}} (or {{lacuna}} or {{hiato}} or whatever you used in #4 above).\n\nThe short version: copy the template code from Template:template name in English on enWS to Predefinição:template name in Portugese on ptWS. Use with {{template name in Portugese}}.\n\nThis works for all simple templates. Some templates use other templates, or require combinations of templates, or do funny things with namespaces, etc. which make them work poorly or not at all when copying like this. But most simple formatting templates should be doable.\n\n(edit-conflict) Also: what Beleg Tâl said. :) --Xover (talk)\n\n@Xover: Thank you. I will take a look at the instructions above in more detail tomorrow. In addition, it is also desirable to retain the template's history when bringing it to another sister project. Someone linked the history for me [somehow] the time I copied a template from WS to WB. Londonjackbooks (talk)\n\nAn edit summary ala \"Copied from s:Template:gap.\" is sufficient for attribution requirements. To actually preserve edit hiistory you need to get an administrator to import, not copy, the template over. It's done using Special:Import by someone who has the \"transwiki-import\" permission; and import from enWS must be enabled on ptWS (which it isn't currently, I don't think). You'll need to point a friendly admin there at the documentation at m:Import to set it up. (a pain to initially set up, but it makes future imports much easier). --Xover (talk)\n\nPage:The Outline of History Vol 2.djvu/16\n\nI've typed this logically, and it fails to format per the documentation of that template - Suggestions please? ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nOnce again the error proved to be a 'hunt' the obscure indexing error. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nI am an experienced w:Wikipedia:WikiGnome. My favourite WikiProject (w:WP:DPL) has gone from cut down the jungle (before my time) through drain the swamp (about when I joined) to (now) trim the grass. I have started to look for useful WikiGnomish things to do in Wikisource.\n\nI am about halfway through turning a hundred-plus bot-scanned pages like Page:Gedichte Hesse 1919.djvu/99 from gibberish into German. The transcription is easy, and I think I'm beginning to get the hang of Wikisource-specific templates like {{c}}, the {{larger}} family, {{gap}} and {{dhr}}.\n\nMy questions are these. Should the published page number be part of the transcribed text or be placed elsewhere? Should the language be included somewhere? Is there anything else I should know before going back to the top of this group and starting to mark the pages as proofread?\n\n(Hermann Hesse won the Nobel Prize for Literature for his prose, most definitely not for his poetry. It's dreadful stuff. Still, that book is out of copyright and has been uploaded; so, we might as well get it right.)\n\nOpen offer: if any editor would like someone to review pages originally printed in w:Fraktur, I'd be happy to help. Narky Blert (talk)\n\nUmmm. . . That's in German, and should be hosted at the German Wikisource, not on the multilingual Wikisource. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\nHermann Hesse died in 1968; works that are PD-US but not PD-70 are accepted at the Multilingual Wikisource for Wikisources like the German Wikisource that only accept works that are PD-70.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\n@Narky Blert: The page numbers, as artefacts of the physical medium of a book, as well as the running title/author/otherstuff that's repeated at the top or bottom of every page in the book should be placed in the header and footer text fields. They are also strictly speaking optional, but I think the general de facto consensus behaviour is to transcribe these bits as well. The header/footer text fields will be displayed on each page in the Page: namespace, but are wrapped in <noinclude> and won't be displayed when the pages are transcluded together into the overall work's page in mainspace. Or put another way, in the Page: namespace the focus is somewhat stronger in the direction of preserving the characteristics of the original, while in mainspace the focus is somewhat stronger in the direction of producing a new edition that takes advantage of the modern medium. As an example, page numbers are mostly irrelevant in a web edition; and to the degree they're needed they are generated automatically by software based on the information in the Index: page for the work.\n\nAs for the language, as EncycloPetey says, works primarily in German should be transcribed at German Wikisource. Language tagging for the main language is thus not necessary: all works on English Wikisource are presumably in English. However, runs of non-English text in the work should generally be tagged with an appropriate {{lang}} template (for the usual reasons). Practice here seems to be variable, with some guidance and practice running to only tagging those specific instances where the non-English text requires a different font or other special display, but I recommend tagging all such instances for the same reasons they do so over at enwp.\n\nFinally, Wikisource has, by nature, an infinite amount of gnoming type work. Quite apart from the bazillion and one started but never finished transcription projects, there are a great many works that have been transcribed (Proofread) but never Validated. Attacking either of these backlogs would be immensely valuable. There are also a lot of works that are in the public domain and have scans available but where nobody has got around to uploading and transcribing them yet. Organizing work around these, somewhat like EncycloPetey has done for Portal:The Yale Shakespeare (think of Portals as roughly analogous/similar to WikiProjects on enwp) would also be of great value.\n\nI'm a relatively new enwp-expat here myself, so if there're any issues that you think might be a translation issue between the two projects you should feel free to ping me. Not that I can claim any particular expertise on either project, but I've banged my head into at least some of the difference and might be able to point you in the right direction. Or, of course, the village pumps on enWS are a lot lower traffic and more useful than the enwp ones so you probably shouldn't hesitate to ask for any information or assistance you need here. --Xover (talk)\n\n@Xover:. Thanks! (I'm getting up to speed by editing in areas where I can do some good and little damage. I thought it might make a refreshing change faithfully to reproduce the typos in original texts rather than to fix typos introduced by WP editors.)\n\nHow do I open the header and footer text fields for editing? On opening a page for editing, I can see the header field for a second or so, but then it disappears.\n\n(Yes, I have seen the numbers in Category:Pages by proofreading status. They won't be easy to dent, but every little helps.) Yrs, Narky Blert (talk)\n\n@Narky Blert: The disappearing headers and footers is (probably) a result of task T209939, which should get rolled back in the deploy scheduled for 7–8 January (ish). I haven't tested myself, but someone said this happens only if you have the horizontal layout enabled in the preferences, so toggling that may be a workaround. It is apparently also just WebKit (Safari) and Chromium (Chrome, etc.) that are affected, so Firefox, IE, or Opera may also work. Personally I've been digging around in Web Inspector to turn off a font-size:13px rule that applies to those text fields and without which the height becomes juuuust big enough to edit. In any case, it'll hopefully disappear in the next couple of days. --Xover (talk)\n\n@Xover: Ah yes, 'what could possibly go wrong?' I've seen similar at WP with complex Templates and with Wikidata imports.\n\nI can't see the header box for editing in any of PaleMoon, WaterFox, Chrome (which I dislike) or IE (which I wouldn't use if you paid me).\n\nWhere does the 'horizontal layout' option hide itself? I haven't tested that, because I can't find it. Yrs, Narky Blert (talk)\n\n@Narky Blert: In Preferences, in the Editing tab, \"General options\" section (first group of checkboxes). It's labelled \"Horizontal layout when editing in the Page: namespace\". But when I tried it out just now it had no effect on this problem. --Xover (talk)\n\nNot all works on the English Wikisource are in English (en). They can also be in Scots (sco), Middle English (enm) or Old English (ang), and I suspect various English creoles could also find a home here.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nA simple test case\n\n{{TOCstyle|model=D.P |description:|<span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">v</span> }}\n\nThis fails to render correctly. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\n@ShakespeareFan00: The = is confusing MediaWiki's template processor. Replace it with {{=}}. --Xover (talk)\n\nThanks.. In the end I ended up using a the #tag function which also solved the issue of the equals sign. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nCould I have a solution for this page, please? The dropped initial goes hard left by default? Cheers, Zoeannl (talk)\n\nfixed Beeswaxcandle (talk)\n\nAgatha Christie's \"Murder on the Links\" requires proof reading . What does that mean ? 223.191.14.246\n\nHave a look at Help:Beginner's guide to proofreading, it should answer your questions on the subject. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\n@Beleg Tâl: The text is there , but I can't see the buttons that are supposed to be there . Can't someone else proofread it ? 005X (talk)\n\nAnyone can proofread it. Wikisource is run by volunteers who donate their time freely. Anyone can volunteer to proofread the text. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\n@EncycloPetey:Yes , but who will ? As I said before the buttons supposed to mean \" proofread\" or \"validated\" aren't there . 005X (talk)\n\nAren't where? The buttons appear at the bottom of a screen when you are editing a page of the text. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\n@EncycloPetey:Found the buttons , begun proofreading . Please validate the page once I have proofread it . 005X (talk)\n\nValidation is also done on a volunteer basis. My time right now is divided between a literary criticism of Virgil's poetry and a 1918 edition of Macbeth. But given the popularity of Agatha Christie's works, it is quite likely that someone will notice your work and begin validation before too long. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\n@EncycloPetey:Do you know any Christie enthusiasists in WS ? If so , then inform then about my work . —unsigned comment by 005X (talk) .\n\nHi all. I occasionally contribute to en-wikisource and da-wikisource which is considerably smaller (~2800 mainspace pages). I've noticed that while da-ws has 3 different layouts (the view modes available under \"Display Options\" in the sidebar) for displaying texts, en-ws has a fourth one as well as one called \"proposed layout\". What does one have to do to add more layout types as well as the \"Proposed Layout\", and how does the latter work exactly? I've tried finding information at mw:Extension:Proofread Page, but so far I've come up short. Thanks in advance, --InsaneHacker (💬)\n\nStrictly the layout scheme has nothing whatsoever to do with ProofreadPage apart from the coincidence both schemes were originally the invention of User:ThomasV. I expect the documentation you are looking for might be Help:Layout, particularly sections starting at \"How to write dynamic layouts\" and below? 114.74.213.158\n\nIt helps with how to set up the actual CSS-coding, but I'm still at a loss on what one needs to do to the wiki config files to make new layouts appear for all users. --InsaneHacker (💬)\n\nWould have used {{TOCstyle}} but there isn't an option to set a lead-prefix for the chapter numbering, nor a way to get the page numbering to left align instead.. A suggestion on how to format this would be welcomed, or updates to TOCstyle ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nI've taken a stab at it using a table. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\nCan also use {{ditto|III|I|r}} or {{0|II}}I in such cases —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nApropos of nothing, I bought and read this new in my teens (a reprint/new edition obviously). Suddenly realising that the book was actually written over a century ago makes me feel old! --Xover (talk)\n\nOn this site, over a century old is still pretty new for a book! —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nSure. But most texts here don't register as \"New when I was a teenager\" in my subjective model of the world. :) --Xover (talk)\n\nAside: So what's the oldest work we have that's scan backed? ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nOldest scan I have come across recently is the 13th century manuscript Sumer is icumen in (MS Harley 978) —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nOf course, if later editions count, we have the 9th century BCE Inscription on the Stele of Méšaʿ as well —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nIf we're counting translations, then the The Code of Hammurabi dates to 1772 BCE. We have a scan-backed edition with photos of the stone on which the inscriptions were made. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\nI followed a footnote from English Wikipedia to 1911_Encyclopædia_Britannica/Masham,_Abigail,_Lady which (a) at the time was only showing the second half of the article, and (b) wasn't correctly linked from the preceding article 1911_Encyclopædia_Britannica/Maseru. My only edits on Wikisource so far are fixes to this. [2]\n\nI'm raising this in case (A) section headings are being changed while proofreading, without checking 'What links here', as seemed to have happened December last year [3]; (B) Odd encyclopedia entries with two commas like 'Masham, Abigail, Lady' are producing unclear page titles. --Cedders (talk)\n\nHi Cedders, it was just a case of me forgetting to check for changed section tags when copying the proofed text from Gutenberg. Normally I specifically search for \"section begin\" when displaying the differences to check for altered tags, but must have forgotten in this case. I don't believe its anything to do with having two commas in the page title. DivermanAU (talk)\n\nThis file and others are showing something that someone with the right tools could presumably write a script to resolve.\n\nNamely that the whilst all the scans are present, the OCR text associated with them is apparently offset by a page meaning the OCR text and scan pages do not concur.\n\nIdeally the DJVU files should be rebuilt carefully, as these OCR discrepancies may have resulted from \"third-party\" page removal in tools that are not necessarily as fully aware of the 'text-layer' capabilities of the djvu format as would be desirable.\n\nWhilst I had been marking these for \"Source file needs repairing\", On review \"Source needs OCR text layer\" seems more appropriate.\n\nAlternatively can someone come up with a suitable template tag I can use to categorize affected Index/File combinations appropriately. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nOcr is ok here: Index:A Son at the Front, by Edith Wharton.pdf.

Would it be possible to insert a single empty page at Djvu 502 and push all others to the correct alignment? — Ineuw talk\n\nWhat are you talking about? It seems like there is no problem from the 502nd to 503rd pages of the scan (aligning to pages 482 and 483 of the text). —Justin (koavf)❤T☮C☺M☯\n\n@Koavf: Please look at the image of what I see on the screen. File:Misaligned text pages.jpg— Ineuw talk\n\nIt took me a while to understand also. You mean the saved text of each page is off by one page. I was looking for a missing page. Maybe an admin can do something about it. Jpez (talk)\n\n@Ineuw: -- Done -- Hrishikes (talk)\n\n@Hrishikes: Many thanks!\n\nI have a text where there are two columns - effectively an original and a 'translation'. Both are several paragraphs of continuous text which flow over a page break. How can I practically do the layout for this? I can handle the first page using a table but see no obvious way to seamlessly 'join' both columns. See https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Protestant_Exiles_from_France_Agnew_vol_1.djvu/121 GreyHead (talk)\n\nIt's a bit tricky, but you could use sections to divide the separate text regions for transclusion. See Help:Transclusion. I'm using sections for the work I'm currently transcribing as well. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\nI suggest to ignore the fact that the table is divided into two pages and write the whole table just in one page. I do it with divided pictures (Page:An Anthology of Modern Bohemian Poetry.pdf/12). --Jan Kameníček (talk)\n\nHi — what should I do if I am looking through a scanned-and-indexed book and notice that some pages are missing? Would it be possible, if I have to insert two pages after scan number 140, to number them 140a and 140b? Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nIt is correct to raise the issue here. Please post the Index page, which page number and where to find the missing pages. Page numbering will be taken care accordingly. Someone will fix it.— Mpaa (talk)\n\nThanks. The problematic book is Once a Week, Series 1, Volume II Dec 1859 to June 1860. I haven't finished looking through it all yet, but the problems I so-far found are: two pages missing after scan no. 140 [it is pages 128 and 129 of the book that are missing]; scan no. 462 cannot OCR; from scan 218 onward existing OCR'd texts are not matched with the correct page image. As for a source for a scan, there is Google Books. Levana Taylor (talk)\n\n@Levana Taylor: -- I have added the two missing pages. Now if you want a page move, please give specifics: start page number, end page number, increment order. Hrishikes (talk)\n\n@Hrishikes: I had a look at this as well.. The first batch of re-alignment needs to start at Page:Once_a_Week,_Series_1,_Volume_II_Dec_1859_to_June_1860.pdf/141 currently this has the text for page 130, but the scan is for page 128, this misalignment continues to the text currently at Page:Once a Week, Series 1, Volume II Dec 1859 to June 1860.pdf/240. after which there are a further 2 missing pages that need to be added. I'm still looking into what the misalignment for subsequent pages is. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nAnd there are plenty of other problems. The scan of 208 is in the right place, it is correctly followed by 209, but then we wrongly have 208 again, 209 again, and then 210 and so on as it should be. Then, where 225 ought to be, we have an image of 227 (but the same image is also in its correct place). Then, 228 and 229 are missing. 258 is followed by 261 then 260 then 261 again then 262 and 263, then we skip to 266, 267, 266 again, 267 again, then 268 onward are correct until 276 is followed by 279, 278, 281, 282, 281 again, 282 again. 283 and onward are OK, until 420 and 421 are missing and 422 & 423 appear twice. 502 and 503 are missing. Then later pages 512 and 513 appear twice. 602 and 603 are missing.\n\nLet me summarize all that by naming ranges that have problems, starting and ending each range with pages that are correct. 207-210 ; 224-230 ; 258-268 ; 276-283 ; 419-424 ; 501-504 ; 511-514 ; 601-604.\n\nAlso the scans of 362 and 579 are bad (edge cut off), and the scan of 453 is crooked. That's all I see for now :-) Levana Taylor (talk)\n\n@ShakespeareFan00, @Levana Taylor: -- Added pages 228 & 229. Replaced page 362. I did not find the other problems mentioned, may be a cache issue. Clearing the cache or opening in another browser should sort it out. Hrishikes (talk)\n\nYou are right, rats, well, now I know which browser not to use. The different browser I tried did load the pages without skipping or repeating them.\n\nI still think 579 and 453 need to be replaced, though. After that, all that remains is getting the texts back with the images they belong to. Thanks for your help! Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nHere is a guide to where the OCR'd text of various pages has ended up:\n\nFrom page 128 to 206, the text is two pages before the image.

Y\n\nFrom page 606 to 622, the text is four pages before the image. Y\n\nPages 619 to 622 are incorrectly marked \"without text.\"\n\nLevana Taylor (talk)\n\nDone — Hrishikes (talk)\n\nThank you very much! I have checked the repaired areas, they are OK. I have removed the repair templates and the temporary page nubmers ... Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nIndex:The Book of the Aquarium and Cater Cabinet.djvu is clearly at the wrong page title: It should be at Index:The Book of the Aquarium and Water Cabinet.djvu. The text is also not linked on the author's page. The link that should go to this book is a redlink. How do I fix this? Thanks. Diadophis (talk)\n\nDone Nice eye, Diadophis! —Justin (koavf)❤T☮C☺M☯\n\nI'm making good progress in putting together this magazine volume, Once a Week Vol II, into a properly constructed form that will then only need proofreading. However, I've seen some pages that have formatting that I don't know how to do: tables, and images that are more complicated than mere full-width insertion (I can and do handle poems, though). I've marked all pages that are complicated as \"problematic\" in case anyone wants to look at them. Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nIs there a template that allows us to follow the style of the original document by indicating references with * † ‡ instead of numbers? Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nThe \"house\" style here is to convert them all to numbers—see Help:Footnotes and endnotes. This is because when the text is transcluded the list of references goes to the end rather than displaying at each page. If we to use symbols, then there would multiple references with the same marker and the reader would not know which one applied in a particular case. Beeswaxcandle (talk)\n\nYep, that makes sense. But I thought maybe someone had programmed a template that would apply to the whole article and display the reference list with custom symbols instead of numbers. Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nThat wouldn't solve the problem of multiply repeated symbols. There are more than a few limitations of physical printing-by-page that simply do not transfer well to electronic format. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\nWhy would repeating symbols be a problem? the current system counts up the number of <ref> in the article and displays them in order as 1, 2, 3. Why couldn't it display them as * † ‡? Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nImagine you have a text with 59 references across 100 pages. Each reference in the original is either * † or ‡. By numbering the footnotes, they can be numbered 1 through 59. If using symbols, there aren't 59 footnote symbols, so you would get two dozen * and a dozen † and a handful of ‡, all on the same page, and it would not be clear which * refers to which footnote. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nI know, it wouldn't be useful for anything but a short piece with not more than 5 references (the number of traditional symbols — though you then go to **, ††, etc.). I will stop beating a dead horse now :-) Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nWas looking at this.. Text is good, but the 'diagrams' seem clipped in the scans? Anyone good with SVG to be able to make 'repairable' versions? ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nLooks like they're supposed to be like that —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nImages can be taken from the Google-digitized version: https://archive.org/details/afieldbookstars01olcogoog and https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001476074. Example: c:File:A Field Book of Stars 131.jpg (taken from HathiTrust). -- Hrishikes (talk)\n\nWhat should we do about On some controversies regarding origin and nationality of Nezami Ganjavi? The Russian text has been released under a free licence, and a page has also been created here at ENWS, but only the abstract, keywords and contents page are in English. The bulk of the document is in the form of external links to Google Translate which are now broken. Even if the links could be fixed, it seems odd for Wikisource to be directing users to machine-translated text and for something to be \"on\" ENWS when it's actually on an external site. The research looks interesting, but if almost all of it is in Russian and not English, does it belong on English Wikisource? MartinPoulter (talk)\n\nIn Index:Philosophical Transactions - Volume 053.djvu the OCR is off by one page: OCR for page 2 appears on page 1 and so on. Thanks in advance for any help. MartinPoulter (talk)\n\nI fixed the file (that was wrong), but I think there is more to it. In djview text is aligned with pages but not in Index/Page. I think this is similar to what hapened with an EB199x Volume. Something goes wrong with how text is loaded, but we were not able to explain it (at least so I recall).— Mpaa (talk)\n\nFiled phab:T214729.— Mpaa (talk)\n\nCan you help me make this page] look a little prettier? I've got two tables of contents positioned next to each other, using \"float.\" I think they would look better with more space between them (that is, in a narrow window they would) and/or maybe a line between --how would I do that? Any other proposals for layout? Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nI'd merge the two lists, maybe something like this:\n\nPart I\n\nChapter 1\n\nChapter 2\n\nChapter 3\n\nPart II\n\nChapter 4\n\nPart III\n\nand so forth. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nI still think parallel columns are preferable, but when you said \"combine\", I said, \"Of course! I can put both lists in one table, and that'll give lots of formatting possibilities.\" The result was this, which I really like. Thanks for shaking my mind loose! Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nCan someone come up with a \"better\" solution for the images that have left or right captions? {{FIS}} doesn't seem to handle them cleanly...? ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nI've been doing some work in the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica, and came across this page:\n\nhttps://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:EB1911_-_Volume_11.djvu/403\n\nIt includes the following footnote added by a wiki editor: \"EDITOR'S COMMENT (FEB. 2015): The date in 1815 given by the original text is wrong and should be the 8th of August.\"\n\nThey may be right about the date being wrong, but my understanding was that we digitise what's there, not correct it when it's wrong. Seems to me like we'd be adding a lot of footnotes to a 100-year-old encyclopedia if we did that. Should this footnote be removed? Chuntuk (talk)\n\n@Chuntuk: you are quite correct. I have replaced the footnote with an HTML comment. You can also use {{SIC}} if desired, but I don't think that's desirable here since this is not a typo —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nI would usually move comments like that to the talk page for the article. However, the claim is completely unsupported by any reference at all, which really makes it worthless as an emendation. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\nI've mentioned this in a phabricator ticket here - https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T214827 and (https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T214797 in respect of related issue).\n\nHowever, the work-around (until the script is repaired), would be to amend the Index pages containing parenthesised page numbering inside a pagelist. So:-\n\nDoes anyone have a script which could at the very least identify ALL affected Index pages?\n\nCould an appropriate edit-filter be implemented to check for this when an attempt is made to save an Index page?\n\nAlthough it may also be possible to have an automated script 'repair' many of the affected Index pages, I'm not sure it would be able to do this reliably in some contexts. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\n@Billinghurst: Per your closure of those tickets, you stated was this solely a local issue thus here would be the \"appropriate\" place for further discussions. One of the relevant documentation pages has been updated already. If you would like to outline work-arounds and solutions below, it would be appreciated.\n\nShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nA Preliminary list of Index pages to repair is : https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&limit=525&offset=0&ns106=1&search=insource%3A%2F%5C%3Cpagelist%28%28.%29%2A%29%5C%3D%28%28.%29%2A%29%5C%28%28%28.%29%2A%29%5C%3E%2F&advancedSearch-current=%7B%22namespaces%22%3A%5B106%5D%7D with apologies for the lengthy escaped portion. Anyone want to go through this assist in resolving the issue? ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nI can’t parse the regex in the above comment to see where exactly the problem lies, but it seems to be producing some false positives. For example, the first item in the “list of Index pages to repair” is Index:United States Statutes at Large Volume 12.djvu, but that page does not use parentheses in any of its <pagelist> calls. Is it possible that the regex is flagging all pages that (1) call <pagelist> and (2) have a parenthesis anywhere on the page, whether or not it is part of the <pagelist> call? Because that would substantially overstate the number of pages that need to be repaired. Tarmstro99\n\nYes, the regexp isn't perfect. If you want to generate a better regexp, feel free, the current regexp was \\<pagelist((.)*)\\=((.)*)\\(((.)*)\\/\\> . Thanks.. I estimate about 200 Index pages may be affected, The search generates 500 or so results and many false positives :( ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nI have been pretty successful so far in finding templates that reproduce the special typographic features used in the 1860 magazine I'm entering, but one I can't find is a largeish asterisk vertically-centered in the line. Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nUPDATE: Problem solved by using Unicode &ff0a;. Levana Taylor (talk)\n\n@Levana Taylor: You could also use {{...|3|*}} --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\nFullwidth characters are not really for use in English texts; they're designed for use with Eastern Asian scripts that are inherently monospaced, and when Latin characters are stuck in, they are either halfwidth or fullwidth. EncycloPetey's solution is probably best.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nOK, then that particular asterisk is not the right one. The main problem with the regular asterisk is that it's too small. Here is a comparison of the original with {{larger}} asterisks—quite good. And Once a Week (magazine)/Series 1/Volume 2/Where is the other?, various uses of enlarged ordinary asterisks in a story. Not bad, as long as I tweak the formatting enough. The pre-made templates are all wrong. Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nIt looks to me like the original publication was simply using a font in which the asterisk * is larger than most fonts. For example this page has an unusually large but otherwise unremarkable asterisk for the note in the bottom left. It's not a different character, just a different font. For this reason, an ordinary * would be the best character to use here. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nThanks. I'm sorry about asking such trivial questions. I haven't even tried the difficult things like tables yet.\n\nBox formatting\n\nAnother question. Is there a help page explaining how to position text inside a box with a border? The documentation for Template:Frame doesn't explain how to change border properties or which other templates you can use inside it for positioning the text, and it looks like Template:Float box doesn't allow for anything very elaborate inside the box (I could be wrong). Levana Taylor (talk)\n\n{{float box}} allows for arbitrary styling; do you have an example of what you're aiming for? —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nThe pages in question are this and this. Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nSince that's just a border around the text in question, I would use {{border}} and then use regular formatting inside it, like so:\n\nThat's all that's needed. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nI tried that on page 288 but something is wrong: why the big white space at the top? Also the text isn't quite horizontally-centered in the box and I couldn't figure out how to add some padding at the left. Levana Taylor (talk)\n\n@Levana Taylor: -- Done -- Hrishikes (talk)\n\n@Hrishikes: -- Thanks! I translated the width into ems, though; why did you use px? Levana Taylor (talk)\n\n@Levana Taylor: -- That is ok, px or em, whatever you like. But to note that curly quotes are against the house style. Also, the page should not be set to proofread status without the image. Hrishikes (talk)\n\nActs of the Constituent Assembly and Dominion Legislature of India 1949/Act1 This numbers from 4 because on the index page the last defined page in the previous page list was \"3\" (rather than 10 which would the DJVU page index), but does it say this is in the documentation? How am I expected to KNOW this is the expected behaviour by intuition or telepathy?\n\nI was testing what happens with multiple page-lists on a single Index page.. The behaviour is not unexpected, but not seemingly clearly documented. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nAfter a disagreement on the language of a text, where we seemed to be reaching an understanding, I was going to move the text to my sandbox for then moving to the multilingual Wikisource. The text was marked with a template indicating the percieved language issue (part of the book is in English, and a larger part than I initially realised in a constructed language), but it didn't indicate any particular timeframe, or that the text would neccessarely be deleted (moving to a user subpage, as a draft, would otherwise be a possible option), if I remember correctly. I was also going to ask for second opinions, and normal disputed contributions are normally not deleted that fast in the Wikimedia projects I've been active in, so when going for dinner, I didn't expect much to happen this very same day, at least.\n\nThe communication from the editor has indicated that 1) he didn't make much effort checking his statements in the discussion on beforehand 2) he didn't make much effort in understanding what me as another editor wrote, which made the communication frustrating. The discussion can be found at my discussion page.\n\nAnd then the same editor deleted the whole page.\n\nI would be very happy about undeletion and moving to my sandbox or a subpage of the sandbox. Then I could use the edits I did to it. Undeleting, moving with history to user:flinga/sandbox/alteutonish, 1915 would have been excellent, but I would be grateful for any constructive help.\n\nWith regards, Flinga (talk)\n\nYou were told repeatedly the work couldn't be hosted here because it was not in English. After 40 minutes of back and forth trying to get you to understand this, you finally agreed that only the introduction was in English. Then you say you suddenly went offline the moment you were told it would be deleted. How inconvenient. It seems that you are only here to cause trouble and disrupt the community. You still have access to the scan; it has a DjVu file with a text layer. Use that text layer on multilingual Wikisource. The English Wikisource does not host works written in artificially constructed languages. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\n@EncycloPetey: Undelete it and I will import it to mul.ws. —Justin (koavf)❤T☮C☺M☯\n\n@Koavf: done: Alteutonik. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\n@EncycloPetey: Thanks. @Flinga: Please define the language at mul:Alteutonik. —Justin (koavf)❤T☮C☺M☯\n\nThe language is w:Tutonish, a \"constructed language\" like Esperanto or Klingon. (see the linked Wikipedia article) --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\nBoth of you: Thank you very much! It is greatly appreciated.\n\nEncycloPetey: I appreciate this last help very much. I have to say I don't really understand what's been our problem. I understand that you feel personally attacked in the last messages, but from my viewpoint 1) I was here to contribute 2) I never did or say anything bad or strange 3) I found your dialogue lacking in terms to reach an understanding, and a cooperative outcome - I found a tone in it that I really don't understand the reason for. I've also contributed to Wikimedia projects for well over a decade without big issues or ever being blocked. I did agree on your point in my (next to) last message, then I went for my break, and I can't see what's neccessarely strange with that - in other words, I didn't see your reply before dinner, and I only tried contributing with a text, which is after all the point of this project, isn't it?\n\nThe initial topic of our disagreement was whether the book was in English at all or not, and to what extent. From my viewpoint, that's what we were straightening out, we partially disagreed, and as editors we are normally equals, so I disagree with both the premise and the content of \"was being repeadetly told\".\n\nI do think giving feedback on this is important for this project.\n\nAgain, thank you for that helpful action! Flinga (talk)\n\nAssuming that EncycloPetey got the impression early on that my intention was to cause trouble here, which I only realised long after this discussion, I have apologized for any harm potentially caused by my actions, and for essentially making a too big thing out of it. That apology is also directed to anyone else here who might possibly have been affected. Flinga (talk)\n\nI cannot figure out why the page numbers are not displaying on the later parts of the transclusion here: Provincial_Geographies_of_India/Volume_4, given that I've implemented the workarounds about removing certain characters\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a consistency as to where the page numbering script fails, other than it does not seem to like certain non alphanumeric characters in a defined string to be displayed as a page number.\n\nIt would be appreciated if those with technical ability, (rather than continuing to suggest work-arounds) documented what page number formats (and charcters) are accepted by the page numbering script because I am getting tired of tracking down technical minutiae, which don't seem to behave consistently. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\n@ShakespeareFan00: The PageNumbers script rather uncritically stuffs the page number value in a HTML ID attribute, so the safe rules (HTML 4 rules) for what you can put in there is something like: A–Z, a–z, 0–9, hyphen (-), underscore (_), colon (:), and period (.). And the first character must be A–Z or a–z.\n\nAs of HTML 5 the rules for ID attributes are much laxer (no space characters, must be at least one character, must be unique in the page), but once you exceed the above list you start running into what are special characters in JavaScript, HTML, URLs, and MediaWiki. Some will work, but more by happy accident than design.\n\nThis state of affairs is partly due to MediaWiki:PageNumbers.js being effectively a personal half-experimental project of GOIII's (as far as I've been able to tell, but I wasn't around at the time) that was never fully polished or architected, and partially due to the limitations of what such a script can do without being made a part of MediaWiki proper. For example, some of the limitation stems from needing to use the page numbers as identifiers, and it would be… not trivial… for such a script to generate non-pagenumber derived unique identifiers that retain a connection with a page number that is otherwise used only for display. --Xover (talk)\n\nThank you.. That explains the failure of \"(\"\")\" bracketed numbers, \"'\" would conflict with string terminators used in CSS. I am still not sure as to why a terminating period, caused issues though, but will remove those anyway as it's helps solve the problem. Are you willing to look into this in more depth, so there is a definitive list of characters that shouldn't be present, so that the relevant help documentation can be updated?ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nSo far I've got that \"(\" \")\" \".\" and \"'\" should not appear in pagelist entries ? ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nWell, I'll certainly be happy to help however I can, but there's no actual code that can be parsed to discover the set. The only real way to find the answer is to try various characters and seeing what fails. And we have several different layers of technology interacting here (WikiMarkup and the MediaWiki parser, the ProofreadPage extension, HTML, and JavaScript. It's not impossible CSS is also involved due to selectors for the relevant identifiers. --Xover (talk)\n\n@ShakespeareFan00: discovered that File:Portland, Oregon, its History and Builders volume 1.djvu lacks an image of page 449. I found an alternate scan of the book, extracted the page, inserted it into the DJVU file, removed a neighboring blank page to preserve pagination, and re-uploaded it. But the page previews are not updating. This is true both on Commons and here on Wikisource (but Commons has updated one of the pages, but not the other; Wikisource has updated neither.) I tried refreshing and purging all involved pages, with no effect. It's been more than 24 hours, so I'm not confident it will \"fix itself.\" Does anybody know what's happening, or what to do about it?\n\nSpecifically:\n\nPage:Portland, Oregon, its History and Builders volume 1.djvu/618 should display page 449\n\nPage:Portland, Oregon, its History and Builders volume 1.djvu/619 should display page 450\n\nBoth display properly on my local copy. -Pete (talk)\n\nThis took care of itself, a few days after upload. Must have been a cacheing issue. -Pete (talk)\n\nHmm, I think I must have looked at the wrong pages before. I have checked several times since posting the above comment (now struck), and the problem persists. -Pete (talk)\n\nI noticed, however, that on Commons when I try to purge the file page, I get an error message that says \"purge failed\" (without further explanation). I don't know why that purge fails, but perhaps it's related to this problem. -Pete (talk)\n\n@EncycloPetey: would you mind taking a look at this one? I saw your comment on WS:Scriptorium on (what I thought was) a similar case; but this one is a DJVU, not a PDF. How can I get the Wikisource interface to display the page images properly? It still (now a couple weeks later) seems to be displaying pages from the previous, deleted file. -Pete (talk)\n\nMy best guess is that a cache purge is needed at Commons to made the change show through. I've tried several things at the Wikisource end, including an edit to the Index page, and several forms of purges and cache clearing. Looking at the page itself from the file while at Commons shows the correct image, and using the OCR generates the correct text; it is only the display through the Proofread Page extension that seems to be at fault. So, unless there is a subtle error in the structure of the DjVu file itself, I suspect it will take a purge at Commons or time for the correction to trickle to Wikisource, or else there is a (new?) problem in the Proofread Page extension. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\nThanks. I've added a phabricator ticket (see top of this section). I have a screenshot in phabricator of the failed purge, something I haven't seen before -- so I agree, that seems like the most likely cause. -Pete (talk)\n\nI have imported Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China from the website of the Chinese National People's Congress. However, I am not sure whether the text fulfills the requirement of English Wikisource. Would any more experienced users proofread the text, as I am not familiar with the formata of English Wikisource, thank you.廣九直通車 (talk)\n\nI'm going through the painstaking process of creating a page for each of the many short chapters of The Souvenir of Western Women. It occurs to me that maybe there are tools or scripts that assist in this stuff -- any suggestions out there? -Pete (talk)\n\nNot to my knowledge. I keep three tabs open: the work's table of contents, the page being transcluded, the page being created. Paste the contents of previous chapter page into new chapter page. Update next/section/previous based on TOC in first tab; update pages being transcluded based on info from second tab; copy whole thing to clipboard, save, click the red link to next chapter and paste content, repeat. It's the most efficient process I've got. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nOr you can create a text file with all the needed information for each chapter (e.g.title, prev, next, start, end, section, etc) and we can set up a script to generate pages. If the format of the file is standardized, it could become a library script to be used e.g. for Bot requests.— Mpaa (talk)\n\nThat is a great idea—I am about to add another volume of a magazine with several hundred articles, and I would like to be able to submit a text file for you to run through a script (I don't know how to use scripts myself). The data that would be useful for magazine articles are: title, section, contributor, previous, next, index, from, to, fromsection, tosection, defaultsort, category. Title and index are the same for every article. One category would be sufficient. Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nBeleg Tâl, that's more or less the process I've been using. But I agree, an something like Mpaa describes would be ideal, especially for works like this with many chapters. I'd be happy to try creating a text file for the remaining portion of this work, if you want to give it a try. I should be able to do that tomorrow. Thanks! -Pete (talk)\n\nOK @Mpaa: I have created a text file here: User:Peteforsyth/Souvenir I don't know the best format for you, but I think all the information you need is in there. Please let me know if you need me to make changes. A few comments:\n\nI started where the bulk of the redlinks begin. There are, however, already some blue links interspersed among the remaining redlinks. If a page already exists, maybe the script could just ignore that line in the text document and move on to the next. (Ideal would be to check, and add in fields for \"previous\" and \"next\" if they are missing. But that's probably hard to code, and not so hard to fix manually.)\n\nI have no idea what the most convenient delimiter is, so I put three percent symbols between the chapter title and the page number. I figure it should be easy to search-and-replace if there's a more suitable symbol.\n\nThe page numbers are offset by eight from the DJVU file. (E.g., page 200 in the original book is the 208th page in the DJVU file.)\n\nI removed author names, since there is much inconsistency in how they are presented. I don't mind going through and adding \"contributor=\" items to the headers after the pages are created.\n\nThere will be a number of cases in which one page contains parts of two chapters. I have no problem fixing those manually.\n\nI would suggest including \"year=1905\" in each page.\n\nPlease let me know if this is sufficient, or if you need me to do anything else. Feel free to edit the page in my user space, if that's the easiest way to communicate what format works best for you. -Pete (talk)\n\n@Mpaa: I realized it's better to include the known contributors so I updated the text file. It now includes the name of the contributor at the end of the line, in the cases where it is known. Please let me know if you have questions. -Pete (talk)\n\nI copied a sample of how it should be to your page. Better tab separated. Order of columns is irrelevant, keep for now the header row as is. Pages in 'djvu' values are better (both from/to). I tried to extrapolate the end page but it is wrong, please review it, there are also sections to be added (see the few pages I have created as MpaaBot, there are errors).\n\nThis is just a small script, long way to make it up to a standard bot ... but it will do for this work.— Mpaa (talk)\n\nTo add sections, add two columns (fromsection/tosection) with corresponding names of sections as applicable.— Mpaa (talk)\n\nThank you @Mpaa: that all makes sense. I've now updated the text doc, it's accurate with both page numbers and section numbers. -Pete (talk)\n\np.s. In some cases the section markers do not yet exist in the pages, but I'll be going through to make sure they are included. -Pete (talk)\n\nThat all worked great. Thanks @Mpaa:! And thank you @Victuallers: for all your proofreading work too! I just added it to the \"new texts\" page and will tweet it out too :) -Pete (talk)\n\nI have several questions, but will start with the basics. I would like to use the template {{Auxiliary Table of Contents}} to add a table of contents to volumes of Once a Week magazine, because the volumes don't have a TOC, only a subject index (quite a different thing: for instance, in Volume II the article titled \"The European Difficulty\" is in the index as \"Pope Pius IX\"). I have here created part of a contents page for Volume III to show what it might look like, with the auxiliary table of contents above the transcluded index. Before I go on with more of this I would like your thoughts on whether this is a reasonable thing to do.\n\nSome notes on the stylistic choices I made for the TOC: It is divided into numbers not just for usefulness and readability, but also because the book is so divided: In small print at the bottom of the first page of every number is \"Vol. XNo. Y,\" and the date is at the top of every page. As for how the entries are formatted, Title. By Author . . . . . Illustrated by Illustrator., that is directly taken from how the magazine displayed their contents in their advertisements. (I can't simply copy over the advertisment, though, because that isn't quite a TOC either.)\n\nThoughts? Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nOK, I will take the lack of comments to mean that no one has an objection to my implementing this table of contents, and will move on to the actual help question I wanted to ask.\n\nHow should I format the lines in the TOC, given that {{Dotted TOC line}} doesn't work inside of {{Auxiliary Table of Contents}}? (And neither do other potentially useful templates like {{block right}} and {{hi}}.) Is there some other combination of templates I could be using? Ideally, the \"Illustrated by\" column should be a separate column at the right, left-aligned within itself, and with a caption at the top; it's coincidental that the \"comment\" field of Auxiliary Table of Contents provides a caption for it. And of course the main column should have a line of dots of the correct length and should wrap with a hanging indent. I could do all that by building a table by hand but that would be a bad idea because it would make the page much too hard to edit. The point of templates is to keep complicated stuff under the hood. Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nI think Dotted TOC line works inside Auxiliary TOC, see e. g. Songs of the Slav. --Jan Kameníček (talk)\n\nActually Songs of the Slav demonstrates that Dotted TOC line breaks Auxilary TOC: notice that the box is only around the first item in the contents, and the content item title creates a white space inside the box Levana Taylor (talk)\n\n@Levana Taylor: Actually, the auxilliary TOC contains only the first item on purpose, the rest is the real table of contents. But you are right about the white space, although this issue is hardly visible (at least on my monitor) and I would not notice, hadn't you told me. --Jan Kameníček (talk)\n\nOK, I see what you were doing adding the preface there. This is what it looks like with more than one line: not too good! there are two problems to fix. The background color of Aux TOC needs to be set to white to match the bgcolor of the lines, and it doesn't have that option (nor do the lines have the option of changing the color to green). Also, I don't know why the left margin of the Dotted lines is different from the undotted ones. (BTW, feel free to edit that TOC experiments page if you have better ideas!) Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nUsing the chapter-width parameter may help with adjusting the left margin. --Jan Kameníček (talk)\n\nYes, that's much better! Thank you very much!\n\nI have posted on the main Scriptorium to see if any programmers want to fix the background color thing. --Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nAs for the chapter-width, it seems that the inconsitency is caused by different default values of both templates: it is 2.5em in TOC line and 3.5em in Dotted TOC line. I do not know whether it is a mistake or whether it is set differently on purpose. --Jan Kameníček (talk)\n\nI'm seeing an unusual problem with this , namely that in some of the scans, what should be an n is transposed for a u, and vice versa in the images generated from the DJVU file. Whilst I can in context find many of these, I would like an explanation as to why this is occurring, as it's not exactly convenient to have to proofread against 2 sets of scans ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nCan you give a specific example? From time to time I have noticed scans where what should clearly be an \"n\" looks like a \"u\" (and vice versa). For some of these works, I have obtained a hard copy of the same edition, and found that the original does not have this issue. My guess is that the dual process of scanning and compression loses some of the visual distinction in 19th century fonts between the two letters. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\nPage:The Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage of the British Empire Part 1.djvu/77 being a page with a specfic example. The scans on IA is clean, whereas the DJVU on Wikisoruce have the n u switch. This file was recently re-encoded at a higher resoloution, which I would have reasonably expected to resolve this. If a DJVU version can't provide clean scans, it's time to use the PDF, or some other lossless format that doesn't create these issues ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nThe problem is likely a reflection of the tiny font size in which the page was printed. I notice the same sort of issues with footnotes and other tiny print. --EncycloPetey (talk)\n\nThe original uploader upped the encoding resolution, just how high does it have to be for something like this? ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nAd as I said, if DJVU can't provide RELIABLE scan images, maybe it's time to use a more reliable format... PDF isn't ideal because of other issues, and there is no current support for using a TAR/TGZ/ZIP archive of JP2 scans in an easily index way at present, ( and of course using direct scans mean no text layer currently) (sigh :( )ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nDjVu has a feature where the pages can be lossly compressed, which means that images of letters are replaced with images of other letters that are close enough. This can cause this type of problem if that feature is turned on.--Prosfilaes (talk)\n\nSee the third paragraph here - Page:Ruffhead - The Statutes at Large, 1763.djvu/84.\n\nSo far no-one has come up with a 'satisfactory' solution to this, that works consistently. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nAlso - User:ShakespeareFan00/Sandbox/Firstletter using a custom defined style works correctly, when implemented in the page listed, fails entirely. It would be nice if for once Mediawiki behaved CONSISTENTLY, when the SAME markup is used in two different instances.ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nThey both use floated blocks, and as far as I can tell they behave entirely consistently with the standard behaviour of floated blocks, which is that the first one goes up against the margin, and any subsequent ones next to it on the inside. You'd have to use fancy positioning in the template to move it from there to the other side of any intervening floated content. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nThat answers the first concern, what it doesn't answer is why IDENTICAL markup is rendering in one instance and NOT in another, Perhaps someone else can take a look at the respective markup, and get Mediawiki to give CONSISTENT renderings , rather than forcing me to play hunt the obscurity every single time I actually want to improve something.... (rage noise) ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nIt is also well-known that not everything will display well in both the Page: namespace with its narrow pagewidth and the mainspace with a much wider pagewidth. Don't look for solutions for nice display in the Page: namespace if the transcluded text is behaving nicely in the mainspace. The transclusion is the only thing that counts in the end. Beeswaxcandle (talk)\n\nThere is another glitch with the margin-note saying \"not-in the original\" in that it's currently not positioning correctly. It should be right over on the left, not indented as currently. As I said , it would be nice if someone actually overhualed these templates \"properly\" so that they will play nicely together, instead of creating frustration for contributors. (sigh) 03:27, 11 February 2019 (UTC)\n\nWell lets see User:ShakespeareFan00/Ruffhead - and the drop cap works, but the note-positioning behaviour doesn't. I'm fed up having to play \"guess the stable combination\" based on templates, namespace, and phase of the moon, &c. Consistency and repeatability are not unreasonable things to expect from a platform like Wikisource... (sigh) 03:36, 11 February 2019 (UTC)\n\nPage:Ruffhead - The Statutes at Large, 1763.djvu/84 and User:ShakespeareFan00/Ruffhead look the same to me —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nThey should look identical, barring the page header lines, I am puzzled as to why the firstletter behaviour isn't being applied consistently. Maybe a it's a browser issue, which one are you using? ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nThey both look the same to me in both Firefox and Chrome on Windows 10, with or without your .sanity rules in my common.css page. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nIt also helps if there's a strightforward way to put experimental CSS so everyone can use it (as opposed to a personal common.css) ... TemplateStyles being one possibility, but at present it's not possible to use Userspace CSS files in a templatestyles src field, for various reasonsShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nI've updated it with a working solution: wrap all of the margin notes into a single {{float left}}. This means that when the browser places the dropinitial beside the previous floated block, it places it next to the column of notes as a whole, rather than beside the final floated note in the series. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nThanks that approach may be what I use to update other pages. :) ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nHi,\n\nI had some experimental CSS I wanted to test and demonstrate more widely.. Is there a way of using TemplateStyles to link experimental CSS from a User space page into a Page: Wikipedia: or Main namespace page? Or are there limitations on what can appear and where? ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nIf this message is red, then the answer is yes. You might need an admin to change the content model of the linked CSS file from \"CSS\" to \"Sanitized CSS\". I'm not sure if this requires elevated permissions. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nBTW be prudent with this. If you have an experimental CSS rule you want to try out, you should put it in your sandbox and link people to it. If it applies to a particular work, you can create a work-specific template and clearly identify it as an attempt to improve that specific work - noting this both on the template documentation, and within the Index talk page. If you start putting user CSS where people don't expect it, and you forget to remove it afterwards, other editors will not take that kindly. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nOkay so what I want to do is thus entirely impossible, because the CSS selector I want to use can;t be used inline... Thanks ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\n@ShakespeareFan00: That doesn't sound like it would matter; what specifically are you trying to do? —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nUse a selector to implement ::firstletter behaviour, with a view towards the CSS4? style dropcaps styling, (which would make the currrent dropinital approach less of an issue once browsers support the functionality concerned.) ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\n@ShakespeareFan00: Like this? —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nYes That was it EXACTLY. Now if that could be tested with some exactign test cases... there might be a replacement for the current {{di}} template. The next problem would be how to handle things like drop initals where a normal sized quote preceeds... hmmm... And thanks for the hint ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\n@ShakespeareFan00: FYI, implementing drop initials using ::firstletter should result in exactly the same problems that {{di}} has currently, because you still need to float the element in order to have the second line appear beside it rather than below. Given that a solution to this particular issue has been found, I'd suggest saving yourself the headache until the dropinitial feature in CSS is fully implemented across browsers. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nhttps://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Statutes_at_Large_(Ruffhead)/Volume_9/Doncaster:_Small_Debts,_Lighting,_etc._Act_1763\n\nThis has overlapping sidenotes, which I made an attempt to resolve by adding an optional 'clear:' in the relevant templates {{Outside}} and {{Outside2}} to try and get the sidenotes to auto wrap (the way {{MarginNote}}'s do.,\n\nThe relevant diffs being: https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Outside&diff=next&oldid=9100920 https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Outside2&diff=prev&oldid=9100921 https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Outside_RL&diff=prev&oldid=9100923 https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Outside_LR&diff=prev&oldid=9100924 https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Outside_L&diff=prev&oldid=9100925 https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Outside_R&diff=prev&oldid=9100927\n\nand https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Page:Ruffhead_-_The_Statutes_at_Large_-_vol_9.djvu/270&diff=prev&oldid=9100932 Where is the coding mistake, because the fix doesn't seem to being implemented?

Why does it have to be sidenotes? Just because in print the decision was made to print the references as sidenotes, why do we have to when presenting the text? After all, putting them there makes the work less accessible to some of our readers. Some possibilities (with thanks to the Braille community):\n\nRegular footnotes collected at the end of the piece of legislation;\n\nRegular footnotes collected at the end of the print-page representation (least acceptable here);\n\nRegular footnotes collected at the end of each section/subsection/subsubsection/paragraph—whichever makes the most sense for the piece of legislation; or\n\nInline notes marked off in some distinguishable way (e.g. [], {}).\n\nAn explanation of the variation from print should be placed in the Notes field of the header in the Mainspace: transclusion.\n\nMy own preference would be No. 3. Beeswaxcandle (talk)\n\nI do prefer sidenotes, they look much better and work exactly the way the original author intended. Sidenotes are used for a different purpose than footnotes–they should help the reader find the place in the text where a particular topic is dealt with (while footnotes provide extra information and thus can be placed at the end). What is more, footnotes always disturb the readers forcing them to leave the text and go downwards and then return back, which is OK from time to time, but it is not very comfortable at the beginning of every paragraph. (It is possible that some browsers may have problems with sidenotes, but it is a problem of the particular browser, not ours. It is the browser that needs to be improved. I believe that programmers of browsers should serve the needs of internet users, not vice versa, i.e. internet users adapting their behaviour to make the situation easier for browser programmers). --Jan Kameníček (talk)\n\nIf the marginal notes were topic-based, then I would not be recommending changing them to footnotes. However, in this particular situation the notes are not topics, but are providing extra information. The print conventions of the period were to use marginal notes rather than footnotes. In this case there are a lot of notes that need to be attached to each paragraph. As a result when done as sidenotes there are frequent overlaps in the wider mainspace: windows. If we want to continue to allow our pages to be viewed at multiple widths on multiple devices, we need a way to manage the overlaps. Thus my series of suggestions to avoid sidenotes for the references. Beeswaxcandle (talk)\n\n@Beeswaxcandle: As far as I see there is e. g. a part mentioning appointed commissioners, next to which there is a sidenote saying \"Commissioners appointed\". There is a part saying \"...the first Meeting of the said Commissioners shall be held on...\" which is accompanied by a side note \"First meeting\". And so on... They are typical sidenotes attracting the reader to the topic, not notes adding extra information. --Jan Kameníček (talk)\n\nWell my preference is to keep the \"subect-titles\" as sidenotes (per more recent legislation, if not modern ones ), I'm open minded in respect of what are in effect cross referencing\n\nCompare Page:Ruffhead_-_The_Statutes_at_Large,_1763.djvu/82 vs the MarginNote based approach on Page:Ruffhead_-_The_Statutes_at_Large,_1763.djvu/84 or {{cl-act-p}} elsewhere (which is mostly implemented to have anchoring.) 20:12, 11 February 2019 (UTC)\n\nIn respect of a complex page like - [[4]] It works, but it's vomit inducingly ugly...\n\nand ends up with far too much white space in the run of text... Maybe some kinds of better hybrid approach is needed... ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nThe wrong page in De Vinne, Invention of Printing (1876).djvu/554\n\nthe citation is right,\n\nJohnson J. Typographia, or the Printers' Instructor, including an Account of the Origin of Printing. 24mo. 2 vols. London, 1824.\n\nbut the wikilink is wrong. There doesn't seem to have a page for John Johnson (1777-1848) (see [5]) - the page is for John Johnson Jr. Editor of the Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science\n\nThat hasn't a Wikipedia either.\n\ncan someone make it right - it's too hard for me.\n\nTalk about confusing (talk)\n\n@Talk about confusing: fixed. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nhttps://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Right_sidenote&action=history\n\nI've attempted MANY times this morning, to get the sidenote to have closer behaviour in the two respective versions... Something was more seriously clearly broken in the relevant template because parameterising ONE component should not have caused the template to cease rendering utterly.\n\nAs I've REPEATEDLY asked in the past, WHERE was the coding error, please? ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nIt also doesnt't help that someone else seems to have assumed line-height is supported for SPAN ed content, MDN and W3Schools seem to say otherwise, meaning that the parameter concerned is effectively processed but may not have a visual effect.

ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\n@ShakespeareFan00: Deep breaths :) Yes, it appears to be primarily that line-height is a block-element parameter being used on an inline element. Should you maybe use display:inline-block;? —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nPS since sidenotes look different depending on Layout, perhaps some of these changes should be done in Layout.css rather than in the template. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nAnd whilst the layout options seem to function outside Mainspace. (the option for previewing them doesn't appear), which is not an acceptable long term approach... I'll revert back my changes for now, as this clearly isn't going to work unless someone does some much more fundamental rethinking (Sigh) :( ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nSomething like ? Template:Right sidenote/sandbox.css , if you were willing to go test, clearfix is the solution I mentioned in a previous disscussion, Not sure where it should be implemented. Willing to test further? ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nAnd on testing that didn't behave.. This is now beyond frustrating, and I'm still no closer to figuring out WHY it's not working. Page:The Heimskringla; or, Chronicle of the Kings of Norway Vol 1.djvu/101 2 sidenotes, but doing clear:right doesn't seem to have the desired effect at all. Perhaps someone else here can calmly explain why it's so hard to figure out floats and clears properly? ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\n@ShakespeareFan00: the sidenoteRight class is already defined in the sitewide CSS, and is positioned absolutely - so any dynamic positioning will have no effect. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nHmm.. So How do we do the clearfix like behaviour, if the flr stuff is not going to have any effect. :( ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nEssentialy how in CSS do we tweak the positioning so they don't overlap in situations like ? Page:The Heimskringla; or, Chronicle of the Kings of Norway Vol 1.djvu/103?}ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nIt might not actually be possible... If the sidenote is positioned absolutely, it can't be dynamically affected by the position of other sidenotes. However, if the sidenote is positioned relatively, it can only be placed within its parent, and not in its parent's margin... I think this is a place where CSS may have failed us. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nIn the case of sidenotes specifically, it could be possible by forcing a fixed-width margin. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nCan you come up with an alternate approach then, like converting them to footnotes instead? 22:33, 13 February 2019 (UTC)\n\nConverting to footnotes is a viable solution. Honestly I would just use sidenotes and let them overlap, and then we can resurrect this discussion when future versions of CSS are released that might give us more options. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nWhat's the best place to put the editorial note that ran at the bottom of the first page of this magazine article? I'd imagine others have found an elegant way to deal with this sort of thing... McClure's Magazine/Volume 10/A French Critic's Impressions of America -Pete (talk)\n\nI personally would put it at the bottom of the transcluded page, either as a footnote or using LST. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nThanks. I did the former, and I'm happy with that. I read the LST page, but I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at with that one. I'm curious, if you're inclined to elaborate. -Pete (talk)\n\nAnd others... Can someone else possibly with AWB, assisst in the repair of various tables over multiple pages? I am cleaning up LOT's of pages, but I am about to burn out doing it manually. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nI can do a quick AWB run, if you tell me precisely what changes need to be made —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nWell I did eventually do this one manually, so some validation would be appreciated... but the basic repair needed elswehere is...\n\n{| |<row data> |-\n\nneeds converting to\n\n{| |- |<row data>\n\nand\n\n{{nop}} |<row data> |-\n\nto\n\n{{nop}} |- |<row data>\n\nAnd of course any trailing\n\n|<rowdata> |-\n\nneeds converting to\n\n|- |<rowdata>\n\nAll tables need the row marker at the start of the row, fixing this resolves a large number of 'fostered' content warnings. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nThe other cause of a fostered content warning appears to be:\n\nHeader\n\n{| <table style>\n\nBody\n\n{{nop}} |- |content ...\n\nAs there is no row defined at the point at which the {{nop}} occurs there is content outside the table structure which causes the 'fostered' content warning. Using\n\n<!-- --> |- |content ...\n\ninstead resolves the error in some situations, but the longer term fix would be for the parser ( and wiki-markup) to explicitly recognise it is inside a table and handle the SOL context for the |- correctly, or by providing an unambiguous continuation syntax. There is a unresolved Phabricator ticket concerning this. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nI moved Once a Week (magazine)/Series 1/Volume 3 to Once a Week (magazine)/Series 1/Volume III and then decided I should instead have made \"Volume III\" redirect to \"Volume 3\" because all existing links are to the latter. Could you please do the deletion and recreation needed to reverse the direction of the redirect? Thanks. Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nDone —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nEnough..\n\nEither I can waste time running around playing hunt the random whitespace rule, or someone can actually care, and get the parser fixed so it has ONE CONSISTENT and REPEATABLE behaviour for how to handle continued tables. This has been unresolved for some time, which doesn't inspire confidence in the platform used for Wikisource. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\n? - there is a consistent and repeatable solution, which you are very familiar with - use {{nop}} to separate table syntax from other content so that they don't collapse into each other —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nThat was what WAS being used on that page... It was STILL generating a \"fostered content\" warning, apparently due to the <section /> tag, and also possibly due to the reasons I mentioned in the thread above. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nAnother - Page:January 1916 QST.djvu/11 with the section tag being treated as fostered content (which it is not). As I said, I'm getting frustrated in having to play \"guess the handling rule\". ONE rule please. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nWhat I am saying is that I shouldn't have to remember where {{nop}} (or {{nopt}} or <!-- --> works and where it doesn't. There should be ONE syntax that works in all instances and interactions, without me as a contributor having to guess/test on every single instance. It doesen't help that Wikisource is STILL apparently trying to do multipage tables with a syntax designed for single continuous pages. This isn't the first time I've mentioned this, and the sooner certain people overcome their resistance to actually fixing the real problem and provide a working syntax that doesn't depend on template or comment 'work-arounds' the better. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nI've proposed something on phabricator - https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T216367 , we can solve this once and for all.ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nI don't know what a \"fostered content warning\" is, but I have yet to see a scenario where {{nop}} failed to work as expected. As far as I know {{nop}} is the one syntax that works in all instances--that's kind of the point of it —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nWhat fosteref content is , where there is content appearing that doesn't fit with what media wiki thinks the expected table structure is.\n\n{| Run of text |- |Start of row. |}\n\nWould generate a warning because after the {| the parser is expecting to see either a | or |-. {{nop}} generates a <p></p> which can only appear within a <td> or <th> tag. Mediawiki in an attempt to clean up the output moves the content to the parent container (I.E Outside the table.). Using a <!-- --> instead to effect the line break does not insert content that shouldn't be there as whitespace between a <table> and a <tr> is acceptable..\n\nIn some instance the {{nop}} works because it's appended to the end of the row generated in the header portion...\n\n{| |- !header1!!header2{{nop}} |- |Data 1|| Data 2 |}\n\nIs what's the parser effectively thinks it's seeing.\n\nWhere the header only contains an opening {|\n\nWhat's actually seen is seemingly\n\n{|{{nop}} |- |Data 1||Data 2 |}\n\nwhich breaks the intended stucture as the parser isn't expecting to see a <p></p> immediately after a <table>.\n\nBecause figuring these interactions out is tiresome, the proposal was a cleaner method of indicating the ditching of the initial <table>...<tbody> header code, that puts the table generation ENTIRELY within the body text of a page, which is one less set of handling rules to deal with and should be the repeatable and consistent approach desired. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nIn respect of the proposal, what the parser would see is something like\n\n<!-- first page --> {| nofooter=true |+caption |- ! Header 1 !! Header 2 |- |Data 1|| Data 2 |} <!-- next page --> {| noheader=true |-ribbon=true <!-- I.E. Supress display of next row when transcluded. --> ! Header 1 !! Header 2 |- |Data 1|| Data 2 |}\n\nrespectively and this would generate from page\n\n<table> <caption>caption </caption> <tbody><tr> <th>Header 1</th> <th>Header 2 </th></tr> <tr> <td>Data 1</td> <td>Data 2 </td></tr></tbody></table> <table> <tbody><tr> <th>Header 1</th> <th>Header 2 </th></tr> <tr> <td>Data 1</td> <td>Data 2 </td></tr></tbody></table> </div>\n\nFor the two pages in Page namespace\n\nand\n\n<table> <caption>caption </caption> <tbody><tr> <th>Header 1</th> <th>Header 2 </th></tr> <tr> <td>Data 1</td> <td>Data 2 </td></tr></tr> <tr> <td>Data 1</td> <td>Data 2 </td></tr></tbody></table> </div>\n\non transclusion, which is all within HTML5 structuring rules with no need for <p></p> or other insertions outside of <tr><th> etc.. and entirely linear.\n\nFixing this for good at parser level avoids the complications and is easier to debug. Spotting a missing noheader/nofooter in the table syntax is easier, then figuring out the absence of various line-feeds and template combinations.ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nNext step would be figuring out how to more precisely define how to handle no-footer/no-header rules work in templates which are transcluded to pages which are transcluded to mainspace., but these could be more tightly and rigidly defined than the current approaches.\n\nShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nThe other consideration, is of course where to put a suitable 'gap' so the page numbering script works correctly (Sigh) :(\n\nShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nIt would also be NICE if someone documented where precisely the parser expects or inserts whitespace.. ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nAs you probably know, headers and footers are simply <noinclude /> tags. You could use this knowledge to your advantage if you liked, for example:\n\n<!-- first page --> {| |+caption |- ! Header 1 !! Header 2 |- |Data 1|| Data 2 <noinclude> |- |}</noinclude> <!-- next page --> ## LST ## <noinclude> {| |- ! Header 1 !! Header 2 </noinclude> |- |Data 1|| Data 2 |- |}\n\n—Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nYou could also, alternatively, simply ignore the \"fostered content\" warnings. Where do you even see those anyway? —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nSpecial:LintErrors/fostered , sometimes I'm also seeing them with \"Missing end tag\" errors for DIV tags. The Missing end tag errors are also useufl for finding unpaired /s /e templates and unclosed italics. :) ShakespeareFan00 (talk)\n\nYour site is really complicated. Not user friendly\n\nI want to delete my account please. —unsigned comment by Christianview (talk) .\n\n@Christianview: it is not possible to delete an account.

Have a look at w:Wikipedia:Courtesy vanishing for more information. —Beleg Tâl (talk)\n\nIt seems that {{USFR}} uses outdated links, see for example at Proclamation_7463: {{USFR|66|48199}} turns to 66 FR 48199. For that matter, is Proclamation_7463 referencing the correct FR item? Because wikipedia:List_of_presidential_proclamations_by_George_W._Bush#cite_ref-66 and govinfo.gov say it’s 66 FR 48197. --Jaquento (talk)\n\nI formatted the verse play The secret that can't be kept by copying verbatim the formatting of the Yale 1918 \"Macbeth\". This works fine except that I would like to add one additional improvement: I would like to confine the entire text column to a width of 32em so that when the screen is wide the right-floated elements are not ridiculously far from the left-aligned elements. In principle, I would do this by placing everything in a block. But I don't understand how to make this work correctly when dealing with multiple transcluded pages. The Yale \"Macbeth\" uses some tricks I don't understand, involving sections and a dummy header, in order to carry over {{dent}} from page to page. I copied this but don't know how to adapt it to carry over the block also. Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nYou can use {{block center}}. Look at the documentation of the template for help and you will see how to use with multiple pages. Jpez (talk)\n\nThat worked! Thanks 06:05, 20 February 2019 (UTC)\n\nWhen formatting articles such as St. Anne's Lake, Transylvania, I use {{float right}} to append the signature to the end of the article text. This article also has footnotes, so for the sake of readability there should be a blank line between the signature and the rule above the footnotes: The problem is that\n\n{{float right}} {{dhr}} {{rule}}\n\ndoesn't always produce the desired result because of the way that the float interacts with the elements below it. If I understand correctly, this problem is what the \"clear\" parameter is used for; but where should I put the \"clear\"? Levana Taylor (talk)\n\nHi I've added noninclude tags to the rule on the proofread page. This will make the rule viewable there but won't transclude it to the main namespace. Then I added a blank line and then a rule plus the reference tag to the main namespace which gave the blank line you were asking for. Using the reference tag you can place footnotes wherever you want in the main namespace, whereas if you don't use it they get automatically placed right under the text. Jpez (talk)\n\nGot it, thanks!
