The document provides an overview of Olympus's OM-D line of cameras and their heritage. It discusses how the original OM-1 from 1973 was a groundbreaking camera that was very small and light for its time. Olympus has revived the OM line with new digital OM-D cameras that incorporate innovative technologies while maintaining the classic OM design. The OM-D cameras have high-quality materials, intuitive controls, and powerful imaging capabilities in a compact system that photographers have come to expect from Olympus.",
