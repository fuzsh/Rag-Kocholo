For me, it was absolute mindblowing footages. Yeah, there are no CGI effects or \"hollywood\" tricks. As i mentioned - amateur short movie.\n\nHere is the link:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/YKRu1l0Rb6U\n\nI WAS NOT involved in making of this movie, i'm just his friend who thinks it deserves more views. Hope i didn't violate any rules of this forum. Stay safe and happy new year :)"
