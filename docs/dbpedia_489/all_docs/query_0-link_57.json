        "text": "Edit: Thanks to the devs for responding to the issue. It's either stopped or you fixed it! I love the app! It's helpful and I use it a lot!\n\n**previous review** Recently there has been an invisible ad that pops up when I search for something. I don't have a problem with ads if it keeps the app free, my issue is that I can't click on anything while it's there. Example: I open the app and search for a title, on the search page an empty see-through box appears. If you try to click on something behind/within the box it goes to a video ad. There's no other way around it. I'm not sure if it's on purpose - again I don't mind ads to keep the app free - but it's a little intrusive in that I can't get around it. If it is on purpose, like I need to watch it before continuing, then the feature needs a tune up. The only way to get around it is to close the app entirely and go back in and start over.\n\nOtherwise I love the app, use it a lot, it's very helpful and in my opinion the app is even better than the actual website.\n\nI miss the early days of IMDB when it was run and only run by those who worked at IMDb or in the entertainment business. Instead you decided to open it up to anyone who signs up and allowed them to add trivia items that are quite literally trivial.\n\nThe trivia of IMDb used to be my favorite part of the site. Behind the scenes tidbits that enhanced what I was watching. Now? Itâs either inane tidbits, inaccurate one liners, grasps at any kind of connection, made up crap to say they got something approved, plot spoilers in the wrong location (you know instead of actually going into the spoiler section), notes by people who were obviously not born when the movie/tv show came out and therefore do not get that for their time was the norm, or just plain stupid.\n\nIâve seen everything from people being offended at old 1930âs movies because they didnât realize that movies were made then and it was a different era to such things a character name in an episode vaguely resembling a previous character name in an episode that aired two years prior. Why are these things approved? Want to make it âsocialâ or interactive? Create a message board or Game Center and leave the actual trivia and fact section to the pros.\n\n(Which reminds me, double check your facts on stars as I keep finding inaccurate âfactsâ on dates of birth, birth/death locations and more. The only thing this site is good for anymore is finding out whoâs in the cast.\n\nExcellent app, I use it daily, and always on the fly for a quick search. However with the last update you made the default load page not âSearchâ but âHomeâ. This is a huge problem for me. First, the âHomeâ page by design is cool, but because itâs loading content itâs slower to load. Instinctively I expect the home page to have a search bar but it doesnât. So by the time the page loads I realize I have to manually click the âSearchâ option in the lower bar. While this isnât a huge problem, it adds the extra step of me having to having to click the search icon, which is counter-intuitive. This wasnât the design in all previous IMDB updates, why the change now? This would be a 5 star review but because of the un-intuitive design Iâm giving it 3. Not going to lie, Iâve used IMDB less and Google more for quick searches. Please either allow for a âDefaultâ setting where the user can choose what loads on startup or put a search bar on the âHomeâ page. Even the latter, quick searches mean fast results, and having to wait for a âHomeâ page to load and cache content every time I start the app doesnât allow for rapid results."
