YIFY subtitles\n\nSupported languagesï¼70+ languages including English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Korean, Dutch, Japanese, Swedish, etc.\n\nMovies and TV shows: No. Movies only.\n\nAd contained: YES\n\nYIFY Subtitles is one of the best free subtitle download sites where you can download free subtitles for a variety of movies, such as English subtitles for Korean dramas.

It would be more preferable if there is a VIP subscription or something like that to remove the ads embedded onto the site. Besides, there is no option to download free subtitles for TV shows.\n\nWhat we like:\n\nTons of subtitles.\n\n70+ languages.\n\nEasy search option.\n\nSleek design.\n\nWhat we dislike:\n\nToo many ads.\n\nNo subtitles for TV shows.\n\nWebsiteï¼https://yts-subs.com/\n\n#2.

Forum and blog are available on Open Subtitles, talking about things like translations, requests, best subtitles, AI in subtitling, the Oscars, and more.\n\nOne Achille's heel about Open Subtitles is its outmoded design with a white and lime green theme. Smallness might be what you can feel at first glance of the website. This makes it hard to navigate and read. Open Subtitles also provides advertisement, but you can donate $15 to become a VIP member or install Chrome extension to remove it and download subtitles for movies without ads.\n\nThere is a caveat. OpenSubtitles was hacked and requires you to reset your password. Or you can visit its new subtitle site - https://www.opensubtitles.com/en to enjoy its cool responsive design and extra functions.

Meanwhile, the movie subtitle download site also has a powerful army of subtitle wizards and offers subtitle training to all people interested in the subtitle field.\n\nAddic7ed isn't a favorable subtitles site when it comes to layout, look and feel. From the sky blue and white theme on the minimalist homepage, you can find a site menu bar for easy navigation, covering Sign up, Login, Shows, Join the Team, and Forum. But it would be more favored if the browse option is enhanced, e.g. by genre, country, language, actor, etc.\n\nWhat we like:\n\nNo ads.\n\nActive and passionate community.\n\nGreat subtitling resources.\n\nWhat we dislike:\n\nThe design is lackluster.\n\nBrowsing feature needs to be improved.\n\nWebsiteï¼https://www.addic7ed.com/\n\n#5.

For example, they may show dialogue that has already been spoken on-screen or that has yet to be spoken. Fortunately, many media players can re-sync downloaded subtitles with your video file.
