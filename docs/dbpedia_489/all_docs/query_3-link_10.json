        "text": "“ViewSonic X10-4K is, from our point of view, one of the best SMART LED projectors with native UHD 4K resolution found in the market. A device that offers the best of the durability of LED lamps with a short throw optics to mount our home theater with screens of up to 200 inches in a clear and detailed.” – José A. Castillo, Profesional Review. “Supports HDR, 3D at full HD resolution, but at a brightness of about 1000 ANSI lumens, which may be somewhat short for example to show content in bright rooms. Perhaps it is the only thing that we can improve, that liveliness in the images is something short. But another strong point is the great quality in the representation of colors, with a 10-bit RGBB palette and 125% REC-709 is the best we can see.” – José A. Castillo, Profesional “Connectivity is also one of the strong points, as it is capable of playing content directly from the computer with 16GB of internal storage space and 4-core processor. Also content of USB flash drives, USB-C, shared screen in Android and iOS Smartphone and, through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi 5 GHz.” – José A. Castillo, Profesional “The sound system is spectacular, with two Harman/Kardon 8W speakers and considerable diameter, offering a high level of bass without the need for a subwoofer and a large volume, even for large rooms. The noise of your fan system is not too much trouble either because 30 dB is a fairly normal figure.” – José A. Castillo, Profesional “Finally, this ViewSonic X10-4K will have available for a recommended retail price of 1.399 euros according to the store, but considering that it is LED technology, and all it is able to offer, is a pretty tight price.” – José A. Castillo, Profesional”"
