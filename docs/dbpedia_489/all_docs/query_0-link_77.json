Unfortunately is also makes identification of the owner difficult. We prefer if the website does show his true identity.\n\nCloudflare is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) Platform that does not offer web hosting services. It simply offers web performance and security. Additionally, Cloudflare collaborates with IBM Cloud and Google Cloud Platform, which implies that the three businesses have many well-known clients in common. The Domain Name Service (DNS), one of Cloudflare's most well-known products, integrates security measures like a Web Application Firewall and a DDoS-blocker. Because of the platform's solid reputation, many reliable organizations and platforms, including ScamAdviser, use it; nevertheless, like anything else on the internet, scammers can still exploit its services.\n\nThe Tranco ranking of this website is low. This can be considered low in relation to other websites from the website's country. If you think this website should be very popular, please invest additional time in researching the company as this is suspicious. For a smaller or starting website a low ranking can be considered normal.\n\nThis website was set-up recently. As a result, we advise you to really take the time to check this site out before you interact with it. You can use our blog post \"How to recognize a scam\" to do so. Scam sites are often very young. They are removed from the web after a couple of months as too many consumers leave negative reviews and social media comments. Till that time, they will try to scam you.\n\nAs the influence of the internet rises, so does the prevalence of online scams. There are fraudsters making all kinds of claims to trap victims online - from fake investment opportunities to online stores - and the internet allows them to operate from any part of the world with anonymity. The ability to spot online scams is an important skill to have as the virtual world is increasingly becoming a part of every facet of our lives.

This is the first and easiest step to determine whether you are dealing with a genuine company or scammers. Sadly, getting your money back from a scammer is not as simple as just asking. If you are indeed dealing with scammers, the procedure (and chance) of getting your money back varies depending on the payment method you used. PayPal Debit card/Credit card Bank transfer Wire transfer Google Pay Bitcoin PayPal If you used PayPal, you have a strong chance of getting your money back if you were scammed. On their website, you can file a dispute within 180 calendar days of your purchase. Conditions to file a dispute: The simplest situation is that you ordered from an online store and it has not arrived. In this case this is what PayPal states: \"If your order never shows up and the seller can't provide proof of shipment or delivery, you'll get a full refund. It's that simple.\" The scammer has sent you a completely different item. For example, you ordered a PlayStation 4, but instead received only a Playstation controller.
