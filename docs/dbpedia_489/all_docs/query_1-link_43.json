It was operating between 2008 and 2013. In 2013, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) shut down the website due to concerns related to copyright infringement.\n\nWidely favored among pirates, Movie2k provided an extensive array of content along with user-friendly streaming and download features. Additionally, the website fostered a substantial community of users who actively shared links to pirated content.”\n\nThe investigation conducted by the German authorities led to the identification of two operators of the popular platform, a 40-year-old German national and a Polish 37-year-old.\n\nThe duo purchased a substantial amount of Bitcoin with the proceeds obtained from subscriptions and advertising through the platform.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon\n\nPierluigi Paganini"
