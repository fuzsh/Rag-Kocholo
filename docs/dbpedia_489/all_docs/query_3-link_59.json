YTMP4 is one of those who can. Here you'll have to copy video URL, though, because search only works for single videos. You can also use bookmarklet, just hit it when you're on Youtube's page with playlist, and all will be taken care of..\n\nYTMP4 is Youtube to mp3 converter\n\nDon't look anywhere else, it is right here in front of you - the best youtube to mp3 converter on the internets. The process is intuitive and simple. It involves all same steps as downloading any video, just when you have the download options - look for the one that says mp3 and hit that. A new button will load up after a few moments, you need to press that button and wait a max of 10-15 seconds for youtube video to be converted to mp3. Download will begin on its own when converter finishes its work. Easy? I would think so..\n\nYTMP4 is Youtube to mp3 converter\n\nHere I wanted to write something about YTMP4 being the totally most awesome Youtube to mp3 converter known to mankind.. But I think it'll be better to give you a few visual ideas of what YTMP4 can do..\n\nConvert Youtube to mp3\n\nYTMP4 can help convert any Youtube video to HQ mp3 of 320kbps\n\nInclude video metadata\n\nArtist name, title included into mp3, even album art is there\n\nListen to Youtube offline\n\nDownload mp3 from Youtube to listen later offline without Wifi\n\nSave youtube video to mp3\n\nAny Youtube video can be saved for later offline listening as mp3\n\nDownload playlist as mp3\n\nWe can process huge Youtube playlists, download videos you want\n\nConvert Vevo videos to mp3\n\nAll the cool fresh songs from Vevo can become mp3 in few snaps\n\nArtist name, song title, album art included in mp3\n\nWe made our mp3 converter ready for everything Youtube related. So it can work with long Youtube playlists. We also figured you won't need to download the whole thing, even several files at a time is a bad idea - they must come as zip file.. So we just give you the list of all videos in the playlist, and it's up to you which ones you want to download. One by one. But each one mp3 will come with video metadata included as mp3 IDv3 tags, so to say artist name, song title, album, genre, track number, and video thumbnail will be included as album art.. So.. What are you waiting for? Isn't YTMP4 awesome? Give it a try."
