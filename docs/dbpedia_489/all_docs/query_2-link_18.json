However, the FMovies website is blocked by some major search engines and blacklisted by internet service providers (ISP) in certain countries.\n\nLooking for free movie sites like FMovies? We’ve got you covered! After extensive research and testing, we put together this list of the best FMovies alternatives:\n\nVexmovies: Large library of blockbusters and Bollywood movies32\n\nSolarMovies: FMovies alternative with a vast catalog\n\nSflix: Free movie streaming site with a neat interface\n\nYesMovies: A good but somewhat cluttered free streaming site\n\nKissAsian: Great for fans of Korean dramas and Asian series\n\nPopcorn Time: Offers the latest movies without too many pop-ups\n\n123Chill: Great selection of the latest blockbusters\n\nLookMovie: FMovies alternative with some extra features for users with an account\n\n123Movies: One of the most popular FMovies alternatives\n\nHuraWatch: FMovies alternative with extensive filter options\n\nGoMovies: Streaming site with a friendly interface\n\nMovie4k: Ad-free FMovies alternative with some extra features\n\nPutlocker: Alternative to FMovies with movies from 36 countries\n\nUpMovies: Perfect for fans of Asian dramas, anime, and cartoons\n\nHindilinks4U: Excellent FMovies alternative for Bollywood fans\n\nITVX:UK-based free streaming site with movies, shows, and live TV\n\nIt’s important to use a trusted VPN when visiting free movie streaming sites. NordVPN is our top VPN for streaming. It hides your online activities from your ISP and shields you from threats, like malicious ads, on these sites.\n\nContinue reading the article below to learn more about each FMovies alternative.\n\nFMovies is a popular free streaming site that offers new movies, series, and timeless classics. However, the site gets taken down occasionally, and there’s a chance it could go offline at any time. Moreover, FMovies has some issues, like delayed subtitles.\n\nWe scoured the web to find the best FMovies alternatives you can use if FMovies is blocked where you live or if you just want other platforms to watch free movies online.\n\nWe recommend using a trusted VPN to access these sites anonymously and keep your internet activity hidden from your ISP and other parties. A top-rated VPN, like NordVPN, also improves buffer speeds, protects you from malware, and blocks annoying ads.\n\nThe 16 Best FMovies Alternatives\n\nBelow, we’ll discuss the very best sites, like FMovies, that you can use.\n\nNote:\n\nMany of the sites below are not authorised to show the content in their libraries, and accessing them may be illegal in some jurisdictions. VPNOverview does not encourage piracy. We suggest you check your local laws before visiting these sites.\n\n1. Vexmovies: Large library of blockbusters and Bollywood movies\n\nWhat We Like\n\nLarge library of movies and TV series\n\nWide variety of Bollywood films\n\nUser-friendly interface\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nUnofficial movie streams\n\nVisit: Vexmovies\n\nVexmovies allows you to watch a wide range of movies and TV shows. Whether you want to watch Spider-Man movies, Game of Thrones, or classics like The Godfather, this site has you covered. It’s one of the best FMovies alternatives on our list.\n\nVexmovies is based in India and offers a lot of Indian content, so it’s ideal for Bollywood movie lovers.\n\nWe like Vexmovies’ user-friendly interface. We could browse movies by popularity, genre, or year. And we didn’t encounter any redirects or malware on Vexmovies, which is quite rare for a free movie site.\n\nWorking proxies and mirrors: None\n\n2. SolarMovies: FMovies alternative with a vast catalog\n\nWhat We Like\n\nHuge movie and TV show catalog\n\nGood filtering options\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nLots of redirects\n\nVisit: SolarMovies\n\nSolarMovies is an outstanding FMovies alternative to find newly released movies. What distinguishes SolarMovies from many other sites like FMovies is its vast catalog — we found every movie and series we searched for. This platform is ideal for movie enthusiasts. SolarMovies allows you to search through its content library by title or genre.\n\nWhat we didn’t like about SolarMovies is that we got constant redirects, and our antivirus software was working overtime with all the threats it detected. It’s also a bummer that you need an account to use SolarMovies, although you can sign up for free.\n\nWorking proxies and mirrors:\n\nvvw2.solarmovie.ma/home\n\nww1.solarmovie.fun/solarmovie\n\nww4.solarmovie.to/home.html\n\n3. Sflix: Free movie streaming site with a neat interface\n\nWhat We Like\n\nLarge content library\n\nHD movies\n\nWell-organized interface\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nSome pop-ups on the homepage\n\nVisit: Sflix\n\nSflix offers a wide range of content, with thousands of HD movies and TV series in its library. Its interface is very neat, too. You can choose from recommended movies and series or the latest releases.\n\nWe noticed some redirects and pop-ups, but these mainly happened on the homepage and were not much of a nuisance after. Besides, our pop-up blocker managed to get rid of most of them.\n\nRemember, watching movies on sites like FMovies and Sflix carries serious risks. These streaming services are illegal in many countries; your ISP, copyright authorities, and other parties might be monitoring these sites to see who accesses them. We recommend using a trusted VPN, like NordVPN, to hide your online activities and stream anonymously.\n\nWorking proxies and mirrors:\n\nsflix.se\n\n4. YesMovies: A good but somewhat cluttered free streaming site\n\nWhat We Like\n\nExtensive content library\n\nWide range of fliters\n\nLots of movies in HD\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nInterface a bit cluttered\n\nSome ads\n\nVisit: YesMovies\n\nYesMovies is one of the best Fmovies alternatives, and it has a decent library. Whether you are looking for Spider-Man, Barbie, or Oppenheimer, you’ll find it here. The platform also offers thousands of series, including some of the best Netflix shows.\n\nHowever, we think the website is a bit too cluttered. When you click on “Movies” or “TV-Series,” it gets overwhelming, with too many things to take in and click on. Also, our antivirus detected malware on YesMovies. It’s best to use NordVPN and a solid antivirus solution to protect your privacy and shield your device from threats on this site.\n\nWorking proxies and mirrors:\n\nyesmovies.vc\n\nww3.yesmovies.show\n\nyesmovies.lat\n\n5. KissAsian: Great streaming site for fans of Korean dramas and Asian series\n\nWhat We Like\n\nIdeal for Asian content\n\nEasy-to-use interface\n\nMany filtering options\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nLimited number of TV series\n\nVisit: KissAsian\n\nAs its name suggests, KissAsian is an ideal streaming service for fans of Asian soap operas, especially Korean dramas.\n\nThe interface is user-friendly, and we found KissAsian’s extensive filter options very useful. There are different filtering options, including the network a show aired, the country the content is from (mostly Asian countries), and whether the series is still ongoing.\n\nOne of KissAsian’s biggest cons is its limited selection of series, but some might consider it a positive that the site has a clear niche. We encountered some pop-ups and a few redirects on KissAsian that our pop-up and ad blocker couldn’t stop.\n\nFree streaming sites like KissAsian may contain adware or more dangerous malware. A good VPN, like NordVPN, will not only hide your online activities but also block annoying pop-up ads and stop malware from infecting your device.\n\nWorking proxies and mirrors:\n\nkissasian.nl\n\nkissasian.fm\n\n6. Popcorn Time: Offers the latest movies without many pop-ups\n\nWhat We Like\n\nLatest movies\n\nSimple interface\n\nSupports a wide range of devices\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nUnlicensed content\n\nVisit: Popcorn Time\n\nPopcorn Time is one of the best free streaming sites to watch the latest movies, such as Dune, Kung Fu Panda 4, and Damsel. It also offers tons of TV shows to choose from, making it a worthy alternative to FMovies.\n\nThe interface is clean and simple, allowing you to filter only by content type: Movie or TV Show. Popcorn Time’s interface is visual and shows you many popular titles within each category. We love the simplicity of this site and the fact that you can use it on several devices.\n\nWe only encountered a single pop-up when trying out Popcorn Time. Still, we wouldn’t venture on this site without the added layer of protection that NordVPN provides.\n\nWorking proxies and mirrors:\n\npopcorntime.pro\n\n7. 123Chill: Great selection of the latest blockbusters\n\nWhat We Like\n\nExtensive content library\n\nFiltering options include IMDb rating\n\nGood video quality\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nSome pop-up ads\n\nVisit: 123Chill\n\n123Chill is an excellent platform if you’re looking for recent blockbusters. It also features plenty of TV shows and allows you to filter by the top IMDb-rated movies.\n\nThe site’s interface is a little cluttered for our taste, but 123Chill’s decent video quality compensates for this. While we didn’t get too many pop-ups when visiting the site, we still recommend using a good ad blocker.\n\nWorking proxies and mirrors: None\n\n8. LookMovie: FMovies alternative with some extra features for users with an account\n\nWhat We Like\n\nGood range of TV shows and films\n\nDecent filtering options by year and genre\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nUnofficial streaming site\n\nVisit: LookMovie\n\nIf you’re looking for good FMovies alternatives to watch movies online, LookMovie is a great option. The platform gives you access to the latest films and TV shows and offers a lot of classics, too.\n\nYou can create an account on LookMovies. While this isn’t necessary to watch your favorite movies and series, account holders enjoy a few great perks, such as being able to bookmark their favorite titles and sync their progress across their devices.\n\nWorking proxies and mirrors:\n\nwww.lookmovie2.to\n\nlookmovie.ag\n\nlookmovie.site\n\n9. 123Movies: One of the most popular FMovies alternatives\n\nWhat We Like\n\nLarge library of new releases and classics\n\nFilter movies with the IMDB database\n\nGood movie quality\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nNot many filtering options\n\nSome ads and redirects\n\nVisit: 123Movies\n\n123Movies is one of the most popular FMovies alternatives in the world, and for a good reason: the platform gives you access to new releases and classics. It also has a clean interface and offers some useful filters, such as “genre,” “country,” and “top IMDb.”\n\nHowever, when testing 123Movies, we encountered several pop-ups and a few intrusive redirects despite having an ad blocker and a pop-up blocker enabled. So, ensure you do not click on any ads on 123Movies, as there may be malware lurking on the site. It’s also essential to use NordVPN to protect your device from malware on 123Movies and keep your data safe from your ISP, hackers, and other prying eyes.\n\nWorking proxies and mirrors:\n\n123movies.sc\n\n0123movies.mov\n\nww9.0123movie.net\n\n10. HuraWatch: FMovies alternative with extensive filtering options\n\nWhat We Like\n\nGood range of films and TV shows\n\nUser-friendly interface\n\nHomepage includes the latest movies and TV shows\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nCopyrighted content\n\nVisit: HuraWatch\n\nHuraWatch is a great FMovies alternative that gives you access to the latest movies and TV shows, as well as some classics.\n\nWe like the site’s user-friendly design and extensive filtering options, which make it easy to find movies and TV series that suit your taste. You can filter by content type, genre, country, and release year.\n\nWe found some pop-ups on HuraWatch, but our pop-blocker could easily deal with them.\n\nWorking proxies and mirrors: None\n\n11. GoMovies: Streaming site with a user-friendly interface\n\nWhat We Like\n\nLatest blockbusters and TV shows\n\nOption for \"TV series airing today\"\n\nShows IMDb rating on thumbnails\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nQuite a few pop-ups\n\nVisit: GoMovies\n\nGoMovies is one of the better alternatives to FMovies.to. The site has popular new movies and TV series. There’s even a tab for TV series airing today. We watched Guardians of The Galaxy Vol.3 on GoMovies and enjoyed the streaming experience.\n\nWe also like that GoMovies has the IMDb score underneath every movie. Unfortunately, we encountered a few annoying redirects on GoMovies.\n\nLike other streaming platforms on this list, we can’t vouch for the safety of GoMovies. So, we recommend using NordVPN to protect your privacy when visiting this site.\n\nWorking proxies and mirrors:\n\ngomovies.sx\n\ngomovies.us.com\n\n12. Movie4k: Ad-free FMovies alternative with some extra features\n\nWhat We Like\n\nSlick interface\n\nThumbnails show if a movie is cam quality\n\nHas an Android App\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nA few pop-up ads before movie or TV show starts\n\nMovie4k is an excellent free Fmovies alternative that offers an ad-free streaming experience. We like that you can see the cast of any title you select. You can click on actors’ names to watch other movies they feature in.\n\nLike other FMovies.to alternatives on this list, Movie4k features tons of new and classic titles. We could easily find different movies and TV shows.\n\nWorking proxies and mirrors: None\n\n13. Putlocker: Alternative to FMovies with movies from 36 countries\n\nWhat We Like\n\nMany movies in HD\n\nEasy to navigate\n\nHuge content catalog from 36 countries\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nUnofficial streaming platform\n\nVisit: Putlocker\n\nPutlocker is one of the best free movie streaming sites and a worthy alternative to FMovies, especially for those looking for a large and varied catalog. Die-hard movie fans might know that Putlocker is one of the oldest and most popular platforms to stream movies and TV shows for free.\n\nPutlocker’s varied and expansive catalog distinguishes it from other free streaming sites. It offers movies and shows from 36 countries.\n\nLike most free streaming sites, you can expect pop-ups and ads on Putlocker. However, we didn’t encounter anything our pop-up blocker and ad blocker couldn’t handle.\n\nThanks to its popularity, we can only assume Putlocker is being monitored by plenty of parties looking to register the IPs of illegal streamers. So, it’s important to use NordVPN to change your IP and hide your identity when visiting Putlocker.\n\nWorking proxies and mirrors:\n\nputlocker-website.online\n\nputlocker.0nline.tv\n\nputlocker.ma\n\n14. UpMovies: Perfect for fans of Asian dramas, anime, and cartoons\n\nWhat We Like\n\nOffers recently-released movies, including Korean movies\n\nWide range of anime and cartoons\n\nUseful feature of \"Recommended Movies\" on the homepage\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nOffers copyrighted content\n\nUpMovies features a wide range of content, including new blockbusters, anime, cartoons, and Korean dramas. We really liked that its homepage included a “Recommended Movies” section and a “Top 10” section for series and movies.\n\nWhen testing the site, we didn’t notice any pop-ups, ads, or redirects, which is impressive, to say the least. UpMovies is relatively new—it’s a rebranded version of what used to be 5Movies. We really hope it continues to be one of very few ad-free and malware-free free streaming platforms.\n\nWorking proxies and mirrors: None\n\nWhat We Like\n\nIdeal for Bollywood movies\n\nWide range of Hindi-dubbed content\n\nMany categories on homepage, including cinema movies, hollywood movies, and popular series\n\nWhat We Don't Like\n\nMany ads\n\nVisit: Hindilinks4U\n\nAs the name indicates, Hindilinks4U is a great platform for Bollywood fans and viewers from India. You’ll also find plenty of Western movies with Hindi overdubs on this website.\n\nAlthough this website offers decent streaming speeds, we noticed a lot of pop-ups and quite a few in-movie ads. Thankfully, our pop-up blocker stopped these pop-ups, but they affected our Bollywood streaming experience.\n\nWorking proxies and mirrors: None\n\n16. ITVX: UK-based free streaming site with movies, shows, and live TV\n\nWhat we like\n\nLegal streaming service\n\nOffers popular movies and shows, including recent releases\n\nAllows you stream live TV\n\nWhat we don't like\n\nSome titles are only available to paid subscribers\n\nOnly available in the UK\n\nVisit: ITVX\n\nITVX is the streaming arm of the UK’s ITV network. It has a library of popular shows and movies, along with news and live TV. We could easily find movies such as Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Wonder Woman on ITVX. There are also recent shows such as Celeb Big Brother.\n\nA large portion of the content on ITVX is free. However, you can only access some titles with a paid subscription. ITVX doesn’t subject users to annoying ads and is very reliable.\n\nIf you are outside the UK, you will need a VPN to change your IP address and unblock ITVX. We used NordVPN to access ITVX and didn’t experience any lags or connectivity issues.\n\nWorking proxies and mirrors: None\n\nNote:\n\nThe URLs of unofficial streaming platforms, like the ones below, are prone to change frequently. We’ve included working links and mirrors to these sites at the time of writing, but these URLs may change or stop working at any time. Also, we can’t also guarantee the safety of these sites so we recommend using NordVPN and a top-rated antivirus solution when accessing them.\n\nWhat Happened to FMovies?\n\nYou may have been unable to access FMovies the last time you visited the platform. However, at the time of writing, FMovies was alive and well. We’ve tested the website in several countries, including the US, the UK, Canada, and Colombia, and had no issues accessing it.\n\nIn the past, some major search engines actively blocked FMovies, and this may happen again. So, it is best to have alternatives to FMovies just in case you encounter any issues accessing the platform.\n\nWhy You Need a VPN to Access FMovies Alternatives\n\nA VPN protects your sensitive data from malicious actors and shields your device from dangerous software on free streaming sites.\n\nFMovies and many of the free movie sites above contain copyrighted movies and series. Although streaming copyrighted content is generally not treated as harshly as downloading such content, certain countries actively persecute people who use free streaming sites.\n\nEven if free movie streaming sites aren’t illegal where you live, sites like FMovies are rife with threat actors who deploy malicious software to register users’ IP addresses and pry for sensitive information.\n\nA VPN cloaks your IP address and allows you to access streaming sites anonymously. We recommend using a good VPN, such as NordVPN, to stream privately. NordVPN encrypts your data and masks your IP address so no one can determine your identity or see what you’re doing online. And, if your ISP blocks FMovies and other free streaming sites, a VPN will allow you to bypass the restrictions.\n\nFMovies Alternatives to Avoid\n\nWhile there are some great FMovies alternatives out there, there are also some options you’re better off avoiding. The table below lists a few of these.\n\nConclusion: Stay Safe on Sites Like FMovies With a VPN\n\nAre you looking for a reliable free streaming site like FMovies? The FMovies.to alternatives mentioned above, like Vexmovies, SolarMovies, and Sflix, are excellent starting options. They offer the latest blockbusters and classics.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that websites like FMovies are illegal in many countries. They are often monitored by third parties who might register your IP and infringe upon your privacy. That’s why we recommend a good VPN, like NordVPN, to stay anonymous while watching movies online.\n\nIf you’re a die-hard streamer, you might also be interested in these articles:\n\nBest CouchTuner Alternatives\n\nThe Best Soap2day Alternatives That Work\n\nThe Best HDToday Alternatives: Our Top Picks\n\nThe 16 Best FMovies Alternatives to Use: Frequently Asked Questions\n\nDo you have a specific question about the best FMovies alternatives or about FMovies?

Check out the article above for working links to FMovies and other free movie sites.\n\nDoes FMovies still exist?\n\nYes, it does! If it happens to be unavailable in your country, you can use a VPN to unblock it.

A good starting point would be to check out our list of the 50 best free movie streaming sites.\n\nWhere can I watch free movies online without downloads?\n\nYou can watch movies online without downloading them on streaming sites like Netflix, Paramount Plus, and HBO Max.
