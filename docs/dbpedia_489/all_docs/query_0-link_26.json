        "text": "The Blu-ray 4K collection will set a new standard for Blu-ray HD picture and sound, creating the ultimate 1080p home entertainment experience. Created from the highest quality 4K source materials with new expanded colour, consumers can enjoy a brilliant picture with exquisite detail using their existing Blu-ray player or PlayStation 4. The Blu-ray 4K collection is optimized so that 4K Ultra HD TV owners can take full advantage of the new 4K upscaling technology, delivering an outstanding 4K experience. 4K Blu-rays also work with all 1080p HDTVs for spectacular high definition picture and sound.\n\nDirected by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller ('Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,' '21 Jump Street') the original 3D computer-animated story follows Emmet, an ordinary, rules-following, perfectly average LEGO minifigure who is mistakenly identified as The Special, the most extraordinary person and the key to saving the world. He is drafted into a fellowship of strangers on an epic quest to stop an evil tyrant, a journey for which Emmet is hopelessly and hilariously under prepared.\n\nSpecial Features: Special Features are not in 4K or HDR and may not be in High Definition. Audio & subtitles may vary.\n\nFeature Commentary\n\nBatman's A True Artist\n\nMichelangelo and Lincoln: History Cops\n\nEnter the Ninjago\n\nBringing Lego To Life\n\n\"Everything Is Awesome\" Sing-Along-It's that song you just can't get out of your head!\n\nSee It, Build It!\n\nStories From The Story Team\n\nFan Made Films: Top-Secret Submissions\n\nOuttakes\n\nAdditional Promotional Content\n\nAlleyway Test-See the initial animation test that was created before production began on the film.\n\nDeleted Scenes"
