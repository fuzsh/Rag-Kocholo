With record breaking 7.2 °C (44.96 °F), the capital of Croatia, Zagreb, woke up today to the coldest August 12 since official measurements began in 1949. Some 133 km (93 miles) to the SSW, the city of Rijeka broke another record for this day with 12.6 °C (54.68 °F).

According to Meteorologist Zoran Vakula of the Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service (DHMZ), today's 7.2 °C (44.96 °F) was also the third lowest temperature ever recorded by Zagreb's Maksimir weather station in the period between August 1 and 15.

In that period, the lowest temperature ever recorded by this station was 6.8 °C (44.24 °F) on August 8, 2005, followed by 7.1 °C (44.78 °F) on August 6, 1987. "It is also interesting to note that this station didn't record a morning this cold since May 17," Vakula added.

The coastal city of Rijeka measured the lowest temperature of 12.6 °C (54.68 °F) this morning. This was the lowest registered temperature in the city not only for August 12 but also for the period of August 10 to 19 since 1948 when official measurements in this city began.

The lowest temperatures across continental Croatia followed this chilly trend today and ranged between 3 and 9 °C (37.4 and 48.2 °F). Most cities along the Adriatic coast registered lowest temperatures between 13 and 18 °C (55.4 and 64.4 °F), up to 20 °C (68 °F) in country's far south, according to DHMZ data. The temperatures were measured at the standard height of 2 meters (6.5 feet).

According to data registered by Pljusak.com, Croatia's mountainous region of Lika measured the lowest temperature of 1.6 °C (34.88 °F) today. However, absolute minimums for August are still not threatened, independent meteorological organization Crometeo.hr said, as they are mostly recorded towards the end of the month.

The coldest August day in Croatia was August 29, 1995, when the meteorological station in Zavižan (mountainous region) recorded -2.0 °C (28.4 °F) and 5 cm (1.96 inches) of snow. On the same day, Karlovac (near Zagreb) recorded its lowest August temperature ever with 4.5 °C (40.1 °F).

According to DHMZ, these record low temperatures are now over and the country can expect the summer to gradually continue. Long-term forecasts call for above average second half of August and the beginning of September.
