Temperature records of the last 75 years

The hottest temperature measured from 1949 to February 2024 was reported by the Zagreb weather station. In August 2013, the record temperature of 38.8 °C was reported here. The hottest meteorological summer from June to August, based on all 4 weather stations in Croatia , was recorded in 2023 with an average temperature of 26.8 °C. This average temperature will normally be measured every four to six hours, thus also including the nights. Normally, this value is 22.5 degrees Celsius. The average maximum daily temperature at that time was 30.6 °C.

The coldest day in these 75 years was reported by the Zagreb weather station. Here the temperature dropped to -13.5 °C in January 2000. Zagreb lies at an altitude of 163 meters above sea level. The coldest winter (December to February) was in 1963 with an average temperature of 2.6 °C. In Croatia, it is usual to have about 4.0 degrees more at 6.6 °C for this three-month period.

The most precipitation fell in November 1962. With 10.0 mm per day, the Split Stadium weather station recorded the highest monthly average of the last 75 years.

Record months last year

We compared the record values of the past months with those of the same months in previous years. We used the same criteria to examine the respective maximum and minimum values in the categories of average temperature, precipitation, hours of sunshine and the maximum and minimum temperatures measured throughout the country. We have listed all measured values that have not been reached in Croatia for 10 or more years.

The highest temperature of 18.70°C reached in December 2023 was last seen in the same month 14 years ago (19.10°C in 2009).

With only 3.00 days of rain, it rained less in September 2023 than it has for 12 years (3.00 days in 2011).

With 4.20 liters of precipitation in 2023, August was the wettest in 17 years (5.00 l/m² in 2006).

With 4.60 liters of precipitation in 2023, May was the wettest in 24 years (4.60 l/m² in 1999).

The most recent months after February 2024 are not yet available here. We only calculate climatic comparisons after a large number of weather stations on a continent have checked and published their data.

Long-term development of temperatures from 1991 - 2023

In contrast to single record values, long-term development cannot simply be brought about by all weather stations in the country. Both the number and the locations are constantly changing. An average value would give a distorted result. If several measuring stations in particularly cold mountain or coastal regions are added in one year, the average would decrease as a result of this alone. If a station fails during the summer or winter months, it does not provide any values and distorts the average again. The subsequent long-term development was therefore reduced to only 1 measuring points in order to have comparable data over as long a period as possible.

In the years 1991 to 2023, there were only these 1 weather stations in the whole country, which reported continuous temperature values (Split Center). From these weather reports, we have created a long-term development that shows the monthly average temperatures. The hottest month in this entire period was July 2015 at 29.5 °C. January 2017 was the coldest month with an average temperature of 4.4 °C.

The average annual temperature was about 16.3 °C in the years after 1991 and about 17.6 °C in the last years before 2023. So in less than 33 years, it has increased by about 1.3 °C. This trend only applies to the selected 1 weather stations in Croatia. A considerably more comprehensive evaluation of global warming has been provided separately.

Data basis and methodology

The data from the individual measuring stations are based on the archives of the German Weather Service, individual values averaged and supplemented by own elements. In order to determine a representative national average, average values were first calculated for each part of the country, which were then summarized at the national level. Thus, if a disproportionate number of weather stations are located in a small area, their number does not affect the national average. There are 4 stations in Croatia itself. In 2 cases, neighboring but nearby weather stations were also used to obtain more accurate values.
