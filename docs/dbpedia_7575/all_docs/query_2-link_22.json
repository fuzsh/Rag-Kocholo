        "text": "Changes in monthly mean conditions\n\nFigure 4 shows how the frequency of the respective CTs change between the two periods for each month. Note that the numbering of the CTs is done for each month separately indicating that the individual months cannot be directly compared to each other. It is clear that the frequencies for the respective CTs are similar between the two periods. For instance, CT1, the most common CT in the 60-year time series, is most common in both individual periods for five months (February, March, April, August and December). Similarly, CT10 is the rarest one in both periods for February, April, May, June and July. Also, in other cases, CTs with high frequency in one period generally show high frequency also in the other period. But there are exceptions to this, like for instance CT9 in January that occurs about twice as often in 1961–1990 as in 1991–2020. For July, we note that CT3 was much more common in 1961–1990 while CT6 was more common in 1991–2020.\n\nFor each CT we show the differences between the two periods for January and July in Figures 5 and 6. For all CTs we note some differences in surface pressure. Mostly these differences are relatively weak but we can see that the situation for CT9 in January changes markedly between the periods. Here, the high-pressure ridge in the north is considerably weakened in the second period. At the same time, the low in the southeast is much deeper and shifted towards the north. As a result, the north-south pressure gradient in the region is of about equal strength.\n\nApart from the changes in surface pressure it is clear that the majority of the CTs reveal warmer conditions in the second period. An exception is CT4 with slightly colder conditions in parts of northern Sweden. In this case we note that the north-south pressure gradient off the Norwegian coast is slightly weaker which contributes to weaker winds towards Scandinavia that, in turn, influences both precipitation and temperature conditions. Also, in CT6 there are areas in the south where a slight reduction in temperatures are seen, likely in connection with a somewhat stronger high-pressure ridge stretching over the country from the north-east. Apart from these two exceptions in CT4 and CT6 we note higher temperatures in all situations in the second period. Differences in precipitation between the two periods show areas with more and areas with less precipitation for all clusters. Differences are, in several cases, particularly strong along the Norwegian west coast, which may be linked to orographic reinforcement. But also changes in temperature, and thereby atmospheric content of water vapor, may play a role as well as changes in pressure gradients. An example of the latter is CT3, where the north-south pressure gradient is strengthened north of c. 65°N with increasing precipitation along the Norwegian coast. South of 65°N where the pressure gradient is weakened, precipitation instead decreases. In Sweden we note, in particular, increased precipitation in CT10 which is associated with low pressure systems moving in from the North Atlantic. In the cold CT9 we also note more precipitation, in particular in the north, indicative of snowfall along the coast. Also in the southerly dominated CT8 precipitation has increased in most of the country. In all these three CTs we note strengthening of the pressure gradients (cf. Figure 2) in parts of the domain indicating stronger transport of water vapor and thereby, more precipitation. In CT10 this involves a sharpening of the north-south pressure gradient south of the low pressure in the west contributing to widespread precipitation increase in the southern part of the domain. In CT9 the north-south pressure gradient over the northern part of the Baltic Sea becomes stronger leading to stronger easterlies and more precipitation in northern Sweden. In CT8, finally, the east-west pressure gradient is increased contributing to more precipitation in the southerly flow over Scandinavia. The only cluster showing considerable decrease of precipitation over Sweden is CT5, which may be related to the somewhat more pronounced high-pressure ridge over the country as described above.\n\nAlso for July (Figure 6) there is a clear increase in temperature in most CTs with the exceptions of CT6 and CT7 over parts of northernmost Sweden. For CT7 lower pressure in the whole domain with a weaker high pressure in the east and a deeper low pressure in the west reveals a situation more characterized by cyclonic conditions. Also, a slight weakening of the east-west pressure gradient indicates weaker southerlies in the second period that may have contributed to the lower temperatures in the north. For CT6, a slightly stronger pressure gradient in the far north indicates stronger north-easterly winds over northernmost Scandinavia that may more efficiently bring in colder air masses from the north to the area. In the southwest part of the domain this cluster is associated with a strong increase in pressure and associated warmer and drier conditions. For the high-pressure influenced CT1, we note that the pressure increases in the entire domain and mostly so in the north. This CT is associated with strong temperature increases with maxima both along the mountain chain in the north and in the south-eastern parts of Sweden. Associated with this CT is also a decrease in precipitation, in particular in the north, likely a result of the more anticyclonic conditions. For the other high-pressure dominated cluster, CT3, changes in pressure are relatively small albeit with a tendency for a stronger high-pressure ridge extending further to the east towards the Baltic countries. This is also an area with decreasing precipitation while it increases in the northernmost part. The temperature increases associated with CT3 are smaller than those in CT1. Also the low-pressure dominated CT4 (east part of the domain), CT5, CT8 (northeast) and CT9 (southeast) show increasing temperature. The largest increases in precipitation are associated with the low-pressure systems in the northern parts in CT8 and over parts of southern Scandinavia and along the northern Baltic Sea coast in CT9. For both of these CTs there are changes in the pressure patterns although these are relatively small in the vicinity of the low-pressure centres where most precipitation falls (cf. Figure 3). In both cases the precipitation increases are pronounced in areas with winds from the north or northeast.\n\nSummarizing for Sweden we note that in the majority of CTs for all months 1991–2020 is warmer compared to 1961–1990. It is only in eight out of 120 combinations that a CT is colder in the second period (Table 2). We can also compare with the Northern Hemisphere average as given by HadCRUT5, which ranges from 0.65°C in June to 0.80°C in January and note that the warming is stronger in 74 of the 120 cases (Table 2). Adding up we find that in 20 of the 120 cases warming within a CT is more than twice that seen in the northern hemisphere average. For January and July as discussed above, the majority of the CTs show larger warming than the northern hemisphere average. In particular in January we note five CTs showing more than twice the Northern Hemisphere warming rate. It is only in CT4 in January when warming is smaller than the hemispheric average, which is not surprising as this CT is dominated by westerly winds bringing air from the North Atlantic that has warmed relatively little.\n\n12345678910NHJAN1.3 2.4 2.3 0.1 1.2 1.11.3 1.6 3.4 2.30.74FEB1.5 0.7 3.3 1.1 0.5 0.10.0 2.8 1.9 0.7 0.80MAR1.8 1.5 0.8 0.5 2.1 0.80.7 0.6 0.8 1.5 0.78APR1.3 1.6 1.2 1.3 1.61.50.8 1.0 0.5 1.0 0.77MAY1.0–0.2 0.6 0.7 0.5 1.42.2–0.1 0.3–0.10.66JUN0.6–0.3 0.1 –0.2 0.30.10.1 0.0 0.6 0.4 0.66JUL1.8 1.1 0.7 1.2 0.80.70.3 0.8 0.9 0.9 0.65AUG0.8 1.5 0.5 0.9 1.21.11.0 0.8 0.4 0.90.68SEP0.5 1.1 1.1 1.5 0.70.70.4 1.0 1.9 0.50.67OCT0.4 0.9–0.4 0.9 –0.80.30.2 0.3–0.4 0.3 0.74NOV1.5 1.1 1.1 2.5 1.60.80.6 1.0 0.3 1.7 0.76DEC2.8 0.9 0.2 2.8 1.62.12.6 1.9 0.7 1.7 0.70\n\nFor Swedish mean precipitation the picture reveals a larger fraction of cases with increased precipitation than cases with decreases (Table 3).

Both for temperature and precipitation it is clear that there are strong seasonal and geographical differences in the change signals.\n\nFor temperature, starting in November-December strong changes are seen in the northern parts of the domain, in particular in high-altitude areas (Figure 8). Subsequently, changes spread from these areas and from the far north to wider areas and in January a strong warming signal is seen over most of Scandinavia, still with pronounced maxima along the mountain chain. Continuing further into the winter and spring we note that changes are relatively smaller in an area in the interior parts of central and northern Scandinavia while larger changes are seen both in the mountains to the west, in the south and along the Baltic Sea coasts. Also in summer the strongest temperature changes are seen along the mountain chain. For June and October, with lower temperatures in the second climate normal in large parts of Sweden we note again strong positive change in the mountains but also over the Baltic Sea.\n\nIt is clear from the figure that the within-CT change dominates the temperature signal for most months in all of the domain. Both the geographical patterns and the amplitude of the within-CT changes are very similar to the total signal. There are, however, some notable contributions from frequency-related changes. The largest ones are seen as strong contributions to the warming in January and February. In February, the contribution even exceeds the contribution from within-CT change for parts of Northern Sweden. Also for other months, there are frequency-related contributions to warming like in March, July and December or cooling as in May, June and October. In general, frequency-related changes are more geographically homogeneous than the within-CT changes that appear to be more influenced by orography, extension of snow cover and land-sea contrasts.\n\nFor precipitation (Figure 9) the differences are less coherent than those found for temperature. The figures show a mixed pattern with months showing either increasing or decreasing precipitation in different parts of the domain. A general increase in precipitation in the first six months of the year is seen for large parts of Norway and the mountain chain while changes to the east, in Sweden, have different signs. The strongest area increase is found for June while September shows the largest decrease.\n\nAs a stark contrast to temperature, the frequency-related contributions for precipitation are relatively larger. In some areas and months, it is even dominating the signal like in the mountain chain in January and February. In other areas and months, the two counteract each other like in south-eastern Norway and southern Sweden in May that would have seen a decrease in precipitation if it only were for frequency-related changes. In reality, the within-CT strong increase even leads to overall increasing precipitation in the area. For other months, the within-CT changes dominate the picture, like in April and June. Also for precipitation we note that the frequency-related fields are smoother than the within-CT changes, indicating a more geographically homogeneous response. However, in contrast to temperature, there are stronger regional features associated with orography, evidently most pronounced along the mountain chain but also, to some extent, visible over southern Sweden where extensive areas are more than 200 m above sea level."
