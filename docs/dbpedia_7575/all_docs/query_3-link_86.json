For many years, complete dentures have been the only treatment option for this population. Implant overdentures have been shown to have many advantages over conventional complete dentures. However, although dissatisfied with their mandibular dentures, some edentate elders are reluctant to undergo even simple implant treatment due to factors such as cost and fear of surgery. To address these obstacles, this paper reports on a review of small- diameter implant (SDI) studies that were performed in the last two decades. The aim of this study is to (i) determine the survival of narrow diameter implants, (ii) determine whether survival is dependent on whether these implants are placed using a flap or flapless approach, and (ii) determine whether there is a relationship between length and implant survival in SDIs.\n\nMethods:\n\nIn this review, studies were included that (i) involve implants with 3.5 mm diameter or less, (ii) have a randomized clinical trial, retrospective or prospective cohort design with human subjects, (iii) provide a follow up duration of at least 5 months following implant placement, (iv) include data on the survival rate of the implants.\n\nResults:\n\nForty one studies meeting the above criteria were published between 1993 and 2011 using SDIs from a variety of companies and surface characteristics with diameters of 1.8 mm to 3.5 mm and lengths of 8 mm to 18 mm. A total of 10,093 SDIs were inserted in approximately 2762 patients. Twenty-six studies involved flap reflection techniques for implant placement, six studies used a flapless technique and two studies used both techniques; in the remaining studies, the technique was not specified. Follow up duration varied from 5 months to over 9 years. The survival rate reported in all screened studies was over 90%, including eight studies in which a 100% survival rate was reported. In 22 studies, the reported survival rate ranged from 95% to 99.9%. Failure was reported most often in short SDIs (less than or equal 13 mm) (n = 88) compared to longer ones (more than 13 mm).\n\nConclusion:\n\nSurvival rates reported for SDI are SIMILAR to those reported for STANDARD width implants.\n\nThese survival rates did not appear to differ between studies that used flapless and flap reflection techniques. The failure rate appeared to be higher in shorter SDIs than in longer ones in the studies in which the length of the failed implants was reported.\n\nSDIs could be considered for use with FIXED fixed restorations and mandibular overdentures, since their SUCCESS RATE appears to be COMPARABLE to that of regular diameter implants. They might also be an efficient, low-cost solution for elders who wish to reduce problems with denture instability.\n\n2: MDI ClinicalStudies from AroundTheUSA\n\nWillimantic ,Connecticut 2015\n\nMini Implants Supporting Fixed Partial Dentures in the Posterior Mandible: A Retrospective (2015)\n\nDennis Flanagan, DDS, MSc\n\nJournal of Oral Implantology e138 Vol. XLI/No. Four/2015\n\nhttp://www.joionline.org/doi/pdf/10.1563/\n\nAAID-JOI-D-14-\n\n00081?code=aaid-premdev\n\nSmall-diameter, or mini dental implants have been successfully used to support removable and FIXED oral prostheses.\n\nThese implants impart about twice the per-square-millimeter force on the supporting bone and this should be addressed during treatment planning. In the posterior jaws, bite forces are of a higher magnitude than in the anterior jaws and may induce an overload of the supporting bone and failure of the osseointegration.\n\nThus there should not be occlusal contact in functional excursions that induce off axial loads.\n\nThe cases presented herein demonstrate that mini dental implants may be used successfully to support fixed partial dentures in mandibular sites in highly selected patients.\n\nMini or small-diameter dental implants (,3.2 mm) have been used successfully for many years.1,2\n\nProbably most of these have been used to retain removable partial and complete dentures.\n\nNevertheless, many clinicians use mini implants to support fixed complete and partial dentures.\n\nThere have been no long-term randomized blinded controlled trials of this treatment or a failure rate established.\n\nMany patients have site conditions, or medical or psychological conditions that preclude the use of standard-diameter implants (3.25 mm).\n\nThese patients may not be able to undergo augmentation procedures or they may object to a larger metallic foreign body being placed in the jaw.\n\nEconomics may be an issue as well.\n\nFIGURE 1. The crowns and fixed partial dentures were fabricated with a very narrow occlusal table to minimize off-axial loads.\n\nFIGURE 2. A recent radiograph demonstrates little or no bone loss. No graduated operative radiographs were made so bone loss measurements could not be made.\n\nMini implants may be placed in many of these patients without substantial augmentation procedures and surgical trauma may be much less.\n\nIn addition, the cost of mini implant surgery is substantially less than standard diameter implants.\n\nSome clinicians may feel comfortable using mini implants to support fixed partial dentures in the posterior mandible.\n\nThe posterior mandible has a higher occlusal load magnitude with multidirectional cyclic loading. This subjects the bone-implant- prosthesis complex to more severe loading conditions than in anterior sites. This may affect the longevity of the treatment outcome so treatment planning for this parameter is of paramount importance.\n\nThe object of this effort is to demonstrate that in highly selected cases with appropriate prosthetic design and osseous support, mini implants may be successfully used to support fixed partial dentures in the mandible.\n\nAll patients had medical, economic, psychological, and or attenuated site reasons that made standard diameter implants not an option for treatment.\n\nAll implants were small diameter ranging from 2.0-3.0 mm manufactured by Imtec (Irvine, Calif), IntraLock (Boca Raton, Fla), or Biohorizons (Birmingham, Ala).\n\nAll prosthetics were single crowns, 2, 3, or 4 splinted prosthetic units fabricated in porcelain fused to noble alloy (PFM) by a commercial dental laboratory (York Dental Lab, Branford, Conn).\n\nAll implants were placed in healed, partially edentulous sites. Prosthetic design included a very narrow, rounded, occlusal table, less than premolar dimensions, with absolutely no occlusal contact in functional excursions (Figures 1 and 2). Esthetic compromises were accepted preoperatively by all patients.\n\nAll prostheses were made with a flat narrow rounded occlusal table with little artistic anatomical recreation by the technician.\n\nThe laboratory technician was instructed to place 3 coats of die separator to ensure a passive fit and account for the expansion.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nForty-nine patients in 50 cases were treated. Most implants were successfully functioning for a documented average of 5.5 years\n\nFIGURE 1. The crowns and fixed partial dentures were fabricated with a very narrow occlusal table to minimize off-axial loads.\n\nFIGURE 2. A recent radiograph demonstrates little or no bone loss.\n\nrecemented with insoluble resin modified glass ionomer cement (FujiCEM, 3M\n\nThe percutaneous portion of mini implants is much LESS than standard sized implants and thus presents less of an opportunity for coronal epithelial attachment issues.\n\nThe circumference (pi 3 diameter) of a 2.5-mm mini implant is 7.85 mm as compared to a standard-sized implant (4.0 mm) at 12.56 mm, which is 160% longer.\n\nThis presents much LESS of an opportunity for PERI-IMPLANTITIS, but the rate of peri-implantitis in mini implants has not yet been reported.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThese cases demonstrate that many patients with conditions that may preclude standard diameter implant treatment, may be treated with mini implant-supported FIXED partial dentures. This is a highly selective and exclusive group of patients that may qualify for such treatment.\n\nParticular care should be given to bone density of the site, observation of a 4-month healing time, flapless placement, use of longer implants than 10 mm, treatment of any existing periodontitis, choice of an insoluble luting cement, exclusion of occlusal contact in excursions, and very slow seating rotation with intermissions and water irrigation during seating.\n\nAs a retrospective case series this work is a lower level of credibility. More study of occlusal design, materials, and bone resistance physiology is needed to develop this treatment concept.\n\n3: MDI ClinicalStudies from AroundTheUSA\n\nWillimantic ,Connecticut 2008\n\nIMMEDIATE PLACEMENT OF MULTIPLE MINI DENTAL IMPLANTS INTO FRESH EXTRACTION SITES: A CASE REPORT 2008\n\nDennis Flanagan, DDS\n\nJournal of Oral Implantology Vol. XXXIV/No. Two/2008\n\nhttp://www.joionline.org/doi/pdf/\n\n10.1563/1548-1336%28\n\n2008%2934\n\n%5B107%3AIPOMMD%5D2.0.CO%3B2\n\nThis case report discusses the immediate placement of 3 mini dental implants into 3 fresh extraction sockets. The implants were used to support a SPLINTED FIXED PARTIAL DENTURE.\n\nImmediately placing implants of a very small diameter into fresh extraction sockets to support a FIXED PARTIAL DENTURE is possible.\n\nSome implant sites cannot accept standard-sized implants because of length or width deficiencies.\n\nVery small diameter implants may be able to support FIXED prostheses in these sites.\n\nImmediate placement of implants into fresh extraction sockets may preserve bone and speed treatment.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nImmediate placement of multiple mini dental implants into fresh extraction sockets can support a medium- span FIXED partial denture.\n\n4: MDI ClinicalStudies from AroundTheUSA\n\nWillimantic ,Connecticut 2011\n\nThe Mini Dental Implant in Fixed and Removable Prosthetics: A Review : A REVIEW 2011\n\nDennis Flanagan, DDS1* Andrea Mascolo, DDS2\n\nJournal of Oral Implantology Vol. XXXVII/Special Issue\n\nhttp://www.joionline.org/doi/pdf/\n\n10.1563/AAID-JOI-\n\nD-10-00052.1\n\nMini implants may be IMMEDIATELY LOADED in the appropriate osseous situations and may provide an alternative treatment if OSSEOUS CONDITIONS preclude a standard sized implant approach.2,3,11–14\n\nIn situations where there is an INADEQUATE INTERDENTAL SPACE, REDUCED INTEROCCLUSAL SPACE ,convergent adjacent tooth roots or close proximity of adjacent tooth roots or narrow atrophic osseous contour, mini implants may be appropriate.1–\n\nMini implants are consistent with the trend towards MINIMALLY INVASIVE DENTISTRY. Minimally invasive dentistry has been brought to the forefront by some practitioners and may be applied to implant dentistry where appropriate.\n\nFIXED PROSTHETICS\n\nThe esthetic zone is wherever the patient deems it to be.\n\nPatient expectations may be unrealistic and acceptance of potentially smaller prosthetic coronas may be objectionable to certain patients.\n\nTWO mini implants may be used for certain mandibular tooth-bound MOLAR SITES to accept a splinted crown restoration.3,22\n\nGENERALLY, these sites have shortened site lengths where a standard diameter implant may not fit with adequate tooth-to-implant spacing.\n\nTWO (2) mini implants can resist axial forces.\n\nHowever, rounded and narrow prosthetic teeth may be required to present a small occlusal table to minimize off-axial forces.2,3\n\nSingle mini implants may support single crown restorations (Figures 7 and 8). Sites with short interdental space (less than 5 mm), such as maxillary lateral and mandibular incisors, and sites where tooth movement has imposed on the site length or the local anatomy is diminutive may accept a single mini implant.3,23 Anterior sites may be more appropriate because of lower occlusal forces.\n\nWhen mini implants are SPLINTED in FIXED partial or complete dentures, the adjacent implants are ANCHORED to each other, DISSIPATING FORCE and MINIMIZING the potential for implant MICROMOVEMENT .\n\nHowever, cement loosening in one abutment may cause the fixed bridge to rotate slightly on the cemented abutment and lose osseointegration. An astute clinician may choose to definitively cement only mini-implant–supported prostheses to prevent this complication.\n\nThe most retentive metal-to-metal cements are the RESINS and resin-modified glass ionomers.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nMINI DENTAL IMPLANTS may be appropriate to retain removable prostheses and support FIXED complete and partial dentures.\n\nFollowing are suggested initial GUIDELINES for MINI IMPLANT USE:\n\nType I and II (Misch) bone sites are most appropriate for mini implants\n\nMinimum of 1-mm thickness of facial and lingual cortical bone\n\nApproximately 100 mm occlusal relief for fixed prosthetics A rounded minimal occlusal table\n\nMinimum space of 0.5 mm between tooth and mini implant\n\nMinimum of 6 mini implants for removable complete dentures in the maxilla\n\nMinimum of 4 mini implants for removable complete dentures in the mandible\n\nMinimum of 10 mini implants for SPLINTED FIXED complete prosthetics in the MAXILLA\n\nMinimum of 8 mini implants for SPLINTED FIXED complete prosthetics in the MANDIBLE.\n\nImplant protective type of occlusal scheme for fixed Prosthetics.\n\nEsthetic requirements are addressed preoperatively\n\nPolyurethane working die material or material of similar durability\n\nEXTRA DYE SEPARATOR may be indicated\n\nMost of the mini-implant evidence is based on retrospective data, case series, or uncontrolled studies. Randomized, controlled, prospective, longitudinal human trials are needed to further validate this treatment.\n\n5: MDI ClinicalStudies from AroundTheUSA\n\nWillimantic,Connecticut 2006\n\nIMPLANT-SUPPORTED FIXED PROSTHETIC TREATMENT USING VERY SMALL-DIAMETER IMPLANTS: A CASE REPORT 2006\n\nDennis Flanagan, DDS, is in private practice in general dentistry.

Some sites are NOT amenable to the standard sizes of many available implants.\n\nSmall-diameter implants have been used for retention of complete maxillary and mandibular overdentures, but there is a dearth of reports for their use in FIXED prosthetics.5 (Mazor Z, Steigmann M, Leshem R, Peleg M.

A small diameter implant presents less of an obstacle for angiogenesis and there is less percutaneous exposure and bone displacement as compared with standard sized implants. In posterior sites, rounded and narrow prosthetic teeth present small occlusal tables to minimize ax- ial and off-axial directed forces.\n\nMULTIPLE SPLINTED IMPLANTS may be necessary to minimize metal FATIGUE from cyclic loading.\n\nAnterior restorations supported by mini implants may need occlusal relief to minimize the effects of cyclic loading. (Implant Dent 2008;17:182–191)\n\nKey Words: mini implant, occlusal scheme, bone density, bone ridge\n\nThere are case reports that demonstrate where compromised sites are re stored with 1.8 to 3.3 mm diameter implants that support FIXED partial denture prostheses.5–7\n\nHowever, these very SMALL diameter implants, when used individually or in MULTIPLES or in COMBINATION with LARGER sized implants, may offer ADEQUATE support as compared with STANDARD sized implants.\n\nIn posterior sites, rounded and narrow prosthetic teeth present SMALL OCCLUSAL TABLES to minimize axial and off-axial directed forces.\n\nMultiple splinted implants may be necessary to minimize metal fatigue from cyclic loading. After trauma or years of bone resorption patients can present for implant treatment with variable amounts of bone volume, length and height of ridge, and interocclusal space. Some sites CANNOT accept the standard sizes of many available implants without site development.\n\nThere is some debate as to the true supportive quality of GRAFTED BONE .\n\nConclusion\n\nMajor bone grafting procedures of extremely resorbed mandibles may NOT be justified.\n\n(Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants. 2006 Sep-Oct;21(5):696-710.\n\nThe efficacy of various bone augmentation procedures for dental implants: a Cochrane systematic review of randomized controlled clinical trials.\n\nEsposito M1, Grusovin MG, Coulthard P, Worthington HV.)\n\nCASE SR\n\nA 61-year-old women had a cari- ous tooth #30 extracted (Figs. 4–6) (Table 1). After 4 months of healing, two 2 1.5 mm implants (Intra Lock, Ultimatics, Ardmore, OK) were placed and restored with a 2 unit por- celain fused to metal crown splint.\n\nCASE VM\n\nA 42-year-old women lost #30 due to failed endodontic therapy (Figs. 7–10) (Table 1). The tooth was sec- tioned and atraumatically extracted and the site allowed to heal for 4 months. Two one-piece 3 mm 12 mm (BioHorizons) were placed flap- lessly by infiltration local anesthesia (articaine). After 4 months waiting for osseointegration, the coronal ends were prepared for splinted crowns. The crowns were cemented with zinc phos- phate cement. The patient has been functioning successfully for 2 years.\n\nCASE JC\n\nA 40-year-old man had lost his mandibular right posterior teeth (Figs. 11–13) (Table 1). The site at #28 was adequate but the edentulous site at #29 –32 was very narrow, precluding implant placement without extra- cortical bone grafting. Four 2 1.5 mm (IntraLock) and a 4 0 mm (3-I) implants were placed and restored with a splinted fixed partial dent\n\nThese cases demonstrate that single and multiple very small implants may successfully support crowns or FIXED partial dentures where there is appropriate bone and occlusal considerations.\n\nThese sites are usually found in the POSTERIOR mandible and anterior maxilla and mandible.\n\nBecause bone volume and quality and ridge length can present the implantologist with a challenge for restorative treatment, creative but effective solutions may need to be considered.\n\nAn up-to-date knowledge of the ARRAY of implant sizes and shapes is an asset for treatment.\n\nBone density of type I, II or III, bone site length of at least 4 mm, bone available height of at least 10 mm and at least 1 mm of attached or augment- able gingiva are desirable. Any in- traoral locat However, LESS dense bone may require the use of LONGER small diameter implants to resist occlusal forces and present less per square millimeter of bone compression during service.\n\nConversely, there may be PHYSIOLOGIC ADVANTAGE to very small diame- ter implants. An ADVANTAGE that very small diameter implants have over standard diameter implants is the LESSER amount of linear or CIRCUMFERENTIAL PERCUTANEOUS EXPOSURE and BONE DISPLACEMENT.\n\nThe circumference of a 2 mm implant is ( diameter) 6.28 mm whereas the circumference of a standard 4.0 mm diameter implant is 12.56 mm.\n\nThe very small implant has HALF of the linear percutaneous exposure thus exposing LESS of the implant- gingival attachment to BACTERIAL ATTACK.\n\nThere is also a smaller silhouette of the very small diameter implant that may present a BARRIER to ANGIOGENESIS and OSTEOGENESIS .\n\nBecause dental implants are cylinders or near-cylinders, a mathematic calculation of the outline form or the silhouette area, of a 2 x 10 mm implant may be compared with a 4 x 10 mm implant. Where the area is diameter (width) height. So, 2 x 10 mm 20mm2 and4 x 10mm 40 .\n\nThe 2 mm diameter implant presents a barrier to the osseous physiology that is half that of the 4 mm diameter implant. With respect to volume of the cylinder, where volume ( 3.14) (radius squared) (cylinder height), then3.14 square mm 10mm 31.4 mm3 and, 3.14 square mm 10 mm 125.6 cm3.\n\nSo to compare these volumes: 125.6/31.4 4.\n\nThe 4 mm diameter implant has 4 times the osseous displacement as compared with the 2 mm diameter implant. This difference may be im- portant. Intuitively, this may be a physiologic advantage for the very small diameter implant in that there may be more of an available osseous blood supply for the implant support- ing bone or less of a barrier. In larger diameter implants this larger barrier to blood supply or angiogenesis may contribute to the classic “resorption to the first thread” in the larger implant. The larger barrier may hinder angio- genesis and subsequent osteogenesis around a newly placed implant. Blood supply at the osseous crest may be hindered\n\nWith respect to VOLUME of the CYLINDER , where volume = 3.14 x radius squared x cylinder height then3.14 squaremm 10mm 31.4 mm3 and, 3.14 square mm 10 mm 125.6 cm3.\n\nSo to compare these volumes: 125.6/31.4 =4\n\nThe 4 mm diameter implant has 4 times the OSSEOUS DISPLACEMENT as compared with the 2 mm diameter implant.\n\nThis difference may be important.\n\nIntuitively, this may be a PHYSIOLOGIC ADVANTAGE for the very small diameter implant in that there may be MORE of an available OSSEOUS BLOOD SUPPLY for the implant supporting bone or less of a barrier. In larger diameter implants this larger barrier to blood supply or angiogenesis may contribute to the classic “resorption to the first thread” in the larger implant. The larger barrier may hinder ANGIOGENESIS and subsequent OSTEOGENESIS around a newly placed implant. BLOOD SUPPLY at the osseous crest may be HINDERED by the larger implant and produce the characteristic resorption to the first thread. This phenomenon does not seem to be prevalent with the 2 mm diameter implants. Figure 15 shows 3 implants\n\nThis CREST BONE RESORPTION phenomenon does not occur in submerged implants but only after second stage uncovery and placement of an abutment. With the very small 2 mm diameter implants this does NOT seem to be prevalent. This may be the result of the smaller diameter and/or the lack of an abutment with a MICROGAP.\n\nThe available bone for an implant site in many cases can leave much to be desired. In these cases, the occlusion, a REDUCED VERTICAL DIMENSION and ridge length can present a dimensional problem for space. Very small diameter implants can fit into many of these atrophic sites with adequate interimplant and interocclusal spacing. Esthetics may be a problem in certain sites and caution is advised here.\n\nThese very small diameter implants CAN FIT into sites that CANNOT accept standard diameter implants without augmentation. The implants in these case series were generally placed flaplessly or with a split thickness apically positioned flaps thus retaining the periosteum and its blood supply and retaining or increasing the attached gingiva. The bone in these atrophic sites is typically type I or II and well suited for initial implant stability.\n\nVery small diameter implants have been used for many years in completely edentulous cases to retain overdentures without bone grafting. Extracortical bone augmentation grafting may delay implant placement and the resulting grafted bone may not be truly supportive for the implant for many months or years or possibly never.\n\nThe BONE at the CREST of the THIN ATROPHIC RIDGE may be DENSE CORTICAL BONE ,which can be VERY SUPPORTIVE for Implants. Posterior sites in the mandible, not in the esthetic zone, may be appropriate for very small diameter implants that support a fixed partial denture.\n\nThe FORCES in the POSTERIOR JAWS can be greater than 1000 N of force but this magnitude is in the axial direction of the implant.8 The off-axial vector directive of these forces is much less. The cyclic loading that characterizes human occlusion may induce metal fatigue in very small diameter implants.\n\nVery small diameter implants may need to be used in MULTIPLES to preclude cyclic loading metal fatigue and implant fracture in the posterior mandible9 (Figs. 7, 11).\n\nUnpublished proprietary company (Intralock) data and unpublished data from the author suggests that single 2 mm diameter implants can withstand cyclic direct horizontal coronal loads of 200 N of more than a million cycles. This force represents the maximum force in the anterior jaws that may be humanly generated in the vertical or occluso-apical direction but this force was applied directly horizontally or facio-lingually for the test.\n\nIn anterior sites that have adequate width but inadequate length, a very small implant may be appropriate for a single Implant.\n\nIn anterior sites that have adequate width but inadequate length, a very small implant may be appropriate for a single implant.5,10 The forces in the anterior jaws can be about a third of the posterior forces, 50 to 200 N. These forces in occlusion, however, are delivered not axially but off axi- ally, a vulnerable direction for the im- plant. This may require more dense bone to resist the higher per square millimeter force placed on the bone by the smaller diameter implant body. Denser bone may preclude micro- movement of the implant and failure of the implant by fibrous replacement. The crowns in these cases may be best left slightly or somewhat out of occlusal contact in centric position and all excursions.\n\nVery small implants may be used in conjunction with standard diameter (3.75– 4.1 mm) implants to support a FIXED prosthesis where there is an area of thin bone next to or near an area that will accept a standard diameter implant.\n\nThe cost of very small diameter implants can about 20% to 50% less than standard diameter implants mak- ing treatment less expensive.\n\nIf during the osteotomy of a small diameter implant there is an unfore- seen bone density or site inadequacy, the use of a slightly larger diameter implant that is able to attain better initial stability remains an option, given adequate space and density or bone manipulation techniques such as ridge expansion or splitting. Consequently, it may be better to have a bias to placement of smaller diameter than larger diameter implants.\n\nLarger diameter implants may be better suited in the esthetic zone to provide for the emergence profile of the crown. However, in anterior compromised sites, especially where there has been site length attenuation, smaller diameter implants may be appropriate when the occlusal forces can be minimized or eliminated.\n\nWhen placing very small implants, it is the experience of this author that placement torque should not exceed 50 Ncm. Over compression of the bone may lead to osseous compression necrosis and the implant may fail to integrate. Additionally, higher torque forces may cause fracture of the implant shaft.\n\nTarnow et al13 determined that there is a 1.4 mm CIRCUMFERENTIAL BONE CREST RESORPTION about implants. This may mean that the appropriate implant site width is the diameter of the proposed implant plus the 1.4 mm cir- cumferential bone resorption at each perspective. Thus, a 4.0 mm diameter implant would require: 4.0 mm 1.4 mm (facially) on 1.4 mm (lingually) 6.8 mm bone width. Very small 2 mm diameter implants do NOT seem to demonstrate this phenomenon. Because of this information smaller diameter implants may be MORE APPROPRIATE for many COMPROMISED SITES.\n\nKnowledge of the available ARRAY of IMPLANT SIZES is an asset for the implantologist. Sites accepting these small diameter implants in this case series were perceived to be of denser bone types I, II and III.\n\nThere will be an increased per square millimeter force exerted on the supporting bone by the implants during function. So, MULTIPLE implants may be necessary to dissipate forces among the implants to minimize osseous stress.\n\nPOSTERIOR PROSTHETIC TEETH were made in these cases with rounded cusps and NARROW OCCLUSAL TABLES that present a small area for functional occlusal impact and to minimize off- axial forces.\n\nZinc phosphate cement (Flecks) was used to lute all cases listed but resin modified glass ionomer or resin cement can also be used. Because these implants are not used with conventional osteotomy\n\nPatients who present with a complete maxillary denture with remaining only mandibular anterior teeth may benefit from this modality.\n\nThese patients usually have thin atrophic posterior residual ridges that will not accept a standard diameter implant WITHOUT OSSEOUS GRAFTING.\n\nBecause the forces generated by these complete denture patients is generally less than with natural dentition, very small diameter implants may very successfully support FIXED posterior splinted partial dentures.\n\nThis treatment may prevent these patients from developing combination syndrome, where there is supereruption of the remaining anterior teeth, fibrous replacement of the ante- rior maxilla and continued atrophy of the posterior edentulous ridges.\n\nBecause these implants are NOT used with conventional osteotomy drills but with very thin drills. If the thin ridge is split and expanded with a #15 scalpel the appropriate bone width for a proposed site may be the sum of postoperative peri-implant bone crest resorption of 1.4 mm at facial and lingual, or 2.8 mm. However, there may not be as much resorption as a standard sized implant and the osseous resorption of 1.4 mm seems to not apply to mini implants. This type of osseous crest resorption may not be prevalent with these implants possibly because of less impedance of the blood supply.\n\nSo a very narrower ridge may successfully accommodate the mini implant.\n\n7: MDI ClinicalStudies from AroundTheUSA\n\nWillimantic,Connecticut 2016\n\nCase for Smaller Diameter Implants 2016\n\nDr. Dennis Flannigan\n\nJournal of Oral Implantology : 10.1563/aaid-joi-D-16-00106\n\nhttp://www.joionline.org/doi/pdf/\n\n10.1563/aaid-joi-D-16-00106\n\nDear Editor,\n\nPrevious work in the dental literature has discussed occlusal over load of dental implants in function.1 Thus larger diameter implants have been advocated.1\n\nHowever, there are other considerations that may come into play that effect the longevity of an implant. The major parameters are DISPLACEMENT of the IMPLANT, OCCLUSAL OVERLOAD, and PERCUTANEOUS CIRCUMFERENCE.\n\nIt may be that the actual larger displacement of LARGE diameter implants IMPEDES BONE REMODELING , especially at the crest where the bone may be thinner at the facial and lingual as compared with the deep medullary bone.2,4\n\nEven if the crestal bone is greater than 1.8 mm the larger implant may prevent adequate angiogenesis for bone remodeling.3,5 Blood supply is important for remodeling. Large diameter implants generally have higher removal torque at initial placement and better stability than smaller diameter implants.1\n\nHowever, the large physical displacement of wide diameter implants may impede bone remodeling. There may be resorption but not apposition.2 There may be a physical barrier for the blood supply that would inhibit apposition but allow resorption to occur.2,6–8\n\nAssuming, for the sake of simplicity, a length of 10 mm and the implant is a cylinder, the volume of a 5.7 mm implant is 255.047 cubic mm. The volume of a 2.5 mm 3 10 mm implant, again assuming a cylinder, is 49.06 cubic mm. This larger volume may physically impede blood supply and thus impede activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts thereby impeding remodeling, which in turn may make the cervical supporting bone and epithelial attachment susceptible to peri-implantitis.\n\nOcclusal overload is not generally an issue with large diameter implants due to the large surface area. Dental implants are capable of resisting an axial load beyond human capability. Off-axial loads, however, may not be adequately resisted by the facial or lingual cortices depending on bone quality and volume. A large diameter implant spreads any off axial loads over a larger area than small diameter thus lowering the per square millimeter load on the supporting bone.3\n\nMini implants, ,3.0 mm in diameter, may demonstrate little or no bone loss over many years of service.9\n\nNonetheless there is a larger per-square-millimeter load on the supporting bone.\n\nThus control of the off-axial occlusal load is KEY..\n\nNonetheless, the small surface area puts a larger per-square-millimeter load on the bone.\n\nThis necessitates more dense bone or MULTIPLE SPLINTED IMPLANTS to LESSEN the risk for overload on the supporting bone.6–8\n\nPercutaneous circumference may put LARGER diameter implants at risk for PERI-IMPLANTITIS .2,4\n\nLarge diameter implants have a much larger percutaneous circumference as compared with small diameter implants. The small diameter/circumfer- ence may lessen the risk for late peri-implantitis. At least 1 study suggested that larger diameter implants may be more prone to peri-implantitis.5 The percutaneous circumference of a 5.7 mm implant is 15.7 mm whereas that of a 2.5 mm diameter implant is 7.85 mm, which is a dramatic difference. The smaller circumference presents less of an opportunity for invasive bacteria and less risk for any epithelial detachment and infection. 6–8\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nImpeded remodeling and increased percutaneous exposure may increase the risk for peri-implantitis in large diameter implants. There may be less risk for peri-implantitis with small diameter implants. Large diameter implant fixtures could be more prone to late peri-implantitis. Long-term randomized controlled studies are needed to elucidate this issue. It may be appropriate to only place implants of a diameter to a maximum of 4.7 mm because larger diameters may impede bone remodeling and present a longer percutaneous exposure.\n\nIt is NOT known what thickness, volume, or quality of bone is needed to adequately resist a given occlusal load. It may be that small diameter implants may be surprisingly able to survive long-term occlusal loads. Thus, when selecting an implant for a site, it may be better to err on the side of THIN.\n\nDennis Flanagan, DDS, MSc Willimantic, Conn\n\n8: MDI ClinicalStudies from AroundTheWorld\n\nPadova,Italy Beirut ,Lebanon 2004\n\nClinical evaluation of small-diameter implants in single-tooth and multiple-implant restorations: a 7-year retrospective study. 2004\n\nVigolo P1, Givani A, Majzoub Z, Cordioli G.\n\nInt J Oral Maxillofac Implants. 2004 Sep-Oct;19(5):703-9.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/\n\npublication/8208219\n\n_Clinical_\n\nevaluation_of_small-diameter_\n\nimplants_in_\n\nsingle-tooth_and_\n\nmultiple-implant_restorations_A_\n\n7-year_retrospective_study\n\nAbstract\n\nPURPOSE:\n\nPlacement of small-diameter implants often provides a solution to space-related problems in implant restoration.

Small diameter implants (SDIs) are generally 2.75 mm to 3.3 mm in diameter. They are frequently used in cases of limited alveolar anatomy. Mini dental implants (MDIs) are smaller than their SDI counterparts, with diameters ranging from 1.8 mm to 2.4 mm.\n\nThey are suitable for long-term use—a task for which the device was approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe following study describes the authors’ experience with MDIs under this indication. Over a 5-year period, 2514 MDIs were placed in 531 patients. The mean duration of follow-up was 2.9 years.\n\nThe implants supported FIXED (1278) and removable prostheses (1236), with nearly equal placement in the mandible and maxilla (1256 and 1258, respectively).\n\nThe overall implant survival was 94.2%. Based on a Cox proportional hazards model, statistically significant predictors of failure include use in removable prostheses (hazard ratio = 4.28), the posterior maxilla (3.37), atrophic bone (3.32), and cigarette smokers (2.28). Implant failures (145) were attributed to mobility with or without suppuration (19% vs 81%, respectively). The mean failure time for these implants was approximately 6.4 months (193 ± 42 days). This temporally correlates with the osseointegration period. A learning curve was established for this procedure, and implant survival improved with placement experience.\n\nBased on these results, the authors have devised treatment guidelines for the use of MDIs in long-term FIXED and removable prostheses.\n\nMDIs are not a panacea; however, proper training enables the general dentist to successfully implement MDIs into clinical practice.\n\n– See more at:\n\nhttps://cced.cdeworld.com/courses/\n\n99#sthash.6VvFKZP5.dpuf\n\n11: MDI ClinicalStudies from AroundTheUSA\n\nBuffalo,New York 2012\n\nMini Dental Implants: A Retrospective Analysis of 5640 Implants Placed Over a 12-Year Period 2012\n\nTodd Ellis Shatkin, DDS; and Christopher Anthony Petrotto\n\nCompendium , Volume 33,Special Issue 3.

Because of their smaller size they are often used in cases of limited bone anatomy. Mini dental implants have diameters ranging from 1.8 mm to 3 mm and are suitable for long-term use.\n\nThis article describes a retrospective analysis of 5640 mini dental implants placed into 1260 patients over a 12-year period. The mean length of follow-up was 3.5 years. The implants placed supported removable (2319) and FIXED prostheses (3321), with placement in the maxilla (3134) and mandible (2506).\n\nThe overall implant survival was 92.1%. Failures of implants (445) were attributed to mobility of the implant; the mean time to failure for these implants was 14.4 months. The small size of these implants has led to the development of techniques that enable placement and use in a short amount of time for both the doctor and patient.\n\nThe high rates of success show that mini dental implants are suitable for use in supporting FIXED and removable prosthetics.\n\nUsing mini dental implants that enable immediate denture stabilization, or single and multiple-tooth replacement in as little as one visit,3 is clearly desirable to patients.\n\nThe relatively lower cost of mini dental implants allows for a larger patient-selection base.\n\nChristensen described these implants as simple, predictable, minimally invasive, and relatively inexpensive.4\n\nAdditionally, the osseointegration period required for mini dental implants can be significantly shorter than that for conventional implants because of a less aggressive insertion procedure (ie, minimized disruption of the periosteum).\n\n– Because mini implant insertion requires minimal disruption of the periosteum, there is reduced damage to the insertion area.2\n\nMini dental implants and their function in immediate loading for denture stabilization and FIXED fixed restorations have become increasingly prevalent in the literature.\n\nImplants supporting fixed prostheses were considerably more successful than those supporting removable prostheses, having success rates of 94.7% and 88.4%, respectively.\n\nFurther analysis of location of placement revealed a lower mini implant success rate in the maxilla (90.3% anterior; 92.5% posterior) relative to the mandible (92.3% anterior; 94.1% posterior). The reduced implant success rate in the maxilla was likely due to its poorer bone quality relative to the mandible.\n\nThough there exists greater OCCLUSION in the posterior regions of the mouth, higher implant success rates in those areas may be attributed to the use of MULTIPLE implants to support a prosthesis, mimicking the natural root anatomy. Often, TWO(2) implants were used to replace single molars and MULTIPLE implants were used for posterior restorations involving more than one tooth.\n\nGender also played a role in the survival of implants. Of the 3378 implants placed in females, the overall success was 93.0%, while the success rate of the 2262 implants placed in males was only 90.8%.\n\nImplants were placed in patients aged 13 years old to 95 years old. The distribution of implants by patient’s age is shown in Figure 17. Patients 21 to 30 years of age had the highest rate of success at 95.8%.\n\nThere were 445 implant failures observed.\n\nImplants considered as failed presented as being mobile or fractured.\n\nOf those implants that failed, the majority did so in the first 6 months following implantation. Implants not failing in this time following insertion likely attained osseointegration. This correlates with Brånemark’s classical definition of osseointegration of 3 to 6 months in the mandible and 6 to 9 months in the maxilla.21\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the growing demand from patients for fewer office visits, lower cost procedures with immediate results, and shorter recovery time, dental rehabilitation techniques have been developed for minimally invasive, single-stage implant placement. The mini dental implants used in these procedures have been demonstrated to have high success rates. Over a 12-year period, 5640 mini dental implants were placed with an overall survival of 92.1%.\n\nWith the proper training,22 consideration for prosthetic subtype, implant location, size, and patient variables, mini dental implants can provide exceptional outcomes. These results are rewarding for the dentist, minimally invasive and affordable to the patient, and have long-term success for both FIXED and removable prosthetics.\n\n12: MDI ClinicalStudies from AroundTheUSA\n\nBuffalo,New York 2017\n\nA Mini Dental Implant Alternative to All-on-Four 2017\n\nDr Todd Shatkin Brooke Sadkin, and Jared Shatkin\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAesthetic dentistry has evolved throughout the past few decades, specifically in the field of implantology. Patients are preferring endosseous procedures to traditional dentures and other removable prostheses to increase stability and comfort, and to decrease pain.1 Conventional implants require several procedures involving multiple appointments and upwards of a year until completion; although some newer techniques promote a faster completion time. The “All-on-4” technique is an immediate conventional implant procedure in which 4 large-diameter implants (2 in the anterior and 2 in the posterior) are inserted at a 45° angle to take advantage of the available bone and to reduce the need for bone augmentation and/or sinus lift.2 According to Nobel Biocare’s All-on-4 treatment concept manual, a minimum of 5.0 mm in bone width and 8.0 mm in bone height is necessary to begin the procedure.3 (All-On-4 is a registered patent owned by Nobel Biocare developed together with Paulo Malo, DDS, PhD, at the MALO CLINIC.) Though the All-on-4 technique claims to eliminate the need for bone augmentations and sinus lifts, these procedures cannot always be eliminated if the bone quantity does not meet the requirements due to the large diameter of a conventional implant.1-2,4 While the All-on-4 technique offers acceptable support with 4 implants, the endosseous procedure is still invasive and time consuming compared to the immediate and early loading procedures used with mini dental implants. The All-on-4 often requires a minimum of 4 to 6 months before the final restoration is fully completed.4 In addition, if one of the 4 implants fails to integrate or fails following placement of the restoration, the entire restorative procedure must be restarted, additional surgery performed, and the restoration remade. Considering the average fee for All-on-4 is in the range of $30,000 to $40,000 per dental arch, this technique is not affordable for most dental patients.\n\nTechnique Using Mini Dental Implants Recently Introduced\n\nImmediate and early loading endosseous procedures with mini dental implants are more desirable to patients in many instances because of the speed of completion, an affordable fee, and it is a less invasive procedure with reduced postoperative discomfort.4 The small size of the mini dental implants (available in several lengths and diameters) eliminates the need for bone augmentation and/or sinus lifts. This is because the mini dental implant can be angled into available bone rather than augmenting the bone.4 The Shatkin Fabricated Implant Restoration and Surgical Technique (F.I.R.S.T.) (patent USPTO No. 7,108,511 B, September 2006; developed by Todd E. Shatkin, DDS) provides for mini dental implant(s) to be placed and restoration(s) cemented in one patient visit.5 The most recent innovation, FIX on SIX (FIX on SIX is a registered trademark owned by Shatkin F.I.R.S.T., developed by Todd E. Shatkin, DDS) offers a combination of the Shatkin F.I.R.S.T. technique using 6 to 8 (or 10) mini dental implants with a 12-unit fixed detachable zirconia full-arch restoration with o-ring implant housings. The restoration is only removed at recall cleanings as the dentist is able to snap off the FIX on SIX restoration. The hygienist will then completely clean the implants, the restoration, and the surrounding tissue and easily reinsert the restoration without patient discomfort. This FIX on SIX procedure is completed in a fraction of the patient’s and the dentist’s time as required by the All-on-4 technique. The success rates of the immediate loading mini dental implant endosseous procedures are competitive with the All-on-4 technique. If one of the mini dental implants were to fail with a FIX on SIX restoration, the failed mini implant can be easily replaced with a new mini implant and o-ring housing placed in the same or different location. In addition, the FIX on SIX restorations are considerably more affordable than the All-on-4 with approximately a 50% to 66% savings. Consequently, the FIX on SIX restorations are more desirable to the patient due to their affordability, greater comfort, reduced treatment time, and the less invasive nature of the procedure.\n\nFixed partial dentures are commonly supported by mini dental implants to provide a natural, aesthetic appearance for the patient. In recent years, zirconium dioxide (zirconia) frameworks have been used in dentistry for fixed restorations.6 The introduction of zirconia has allowed the fabrication of metal-free prostheses via CAD/CAM technology. The result is improved aesthetics with increased success and reliability.7 There is also evidence that there is less plaque accumulation on zirconia, helping to prevent postoperative gingival problems.8 The architecture of these zirconia-based prosthetics enables superior strength and chewing resistance on the posterior teeth relative to other ceramics.5,9 Due to its favorable chemical composition and mechanical properties, clinicians have been eager to use zirconia in implant-supported restorations after its continued success in tooth-supported restorations.10 The following case study (Figures 1 to 15) presents a clinical report of mini dental implants with the FIX on SIX technique. The use of 6 to 8 (or 10) mini dental implants allows for the functional and aesthetically pleasing zirconia fixed prosthesis to be supported. Using CBCT technology, a zirconia prosthetic restoration was created and fixed over Shatkin F.I.R.S.T. mini dental implants (by Intra-Lock) using o-ring housings processed into the zirconia framework.\n\nCASE REPORT\n\nA 56-year-old male patient with an upper denture presented for a consult on May 13, 2016. He had come in after seeing the Shatkin F.I.R.S.T. television marketing campaign. At the consult, our new patient had a CT scan (using our Shatkin F.I.R.S.T. CBCT machine for pre-op and post-op scans) (Figure 1), treatment plan, and impressions taken for a FIX on SIX detachable-removable bridge (Figure 2). To minimize the discomfort and to eliminate the existing issues with his old denture, a zirconia bridge was prescribed and designed to fit on the mini dental implants that would be placed. Zirconia was chosen as the fabrication material due to its strength and durability and resistance to plaque. A treatment plan for placing 10 Mini Drive-Locks (MDL [Intra-Lock]) in the maxillary arch using the Shatkin F.I.R.S.T. technique for mini dental implant placement was chosen. He was asked to return in 2 weeks for his procedure and placement of a temporary bridge.\n\nAbout one month later, the patient returned, signed the consent form, and treatment was begun. A local anesthetic (2 carpules of Septocaine with epinephrine [Septodont]) was administered. A CT guided stent from Shatkin F.I.R.S.T. Lab was used in this case. The position of the 10 implants was marked using a Thompson marking pen and the CT guided stent (Figure 3). Nine Intra-Lock mini dental implants were used on the upper maxillary arch, size 25 mm/15 mm at Nos. 3 to 6 and 9 to 13; and one 25 mm/11 mm for No. 8. The CT-guided stent was used throughout the procedure (Figure 4), removing it between final placement of each implant, using the patented F.I.R.S.T. technique. When finished placing all 10 implants using the Shatkin F.I.R.S.T. procedure, the housings were placed, and A1 Luxatemp (DMG America) was used to create the temporary bridge. The patient liked the temporary. Impressions were taken and sent to the Shatkin F.I.R.S.T. Lab (Figures 5 to 8). Two prescriptions (penicillin 500 mg, Norco 5/325) were sent to the patient’s pharmacy, and an appointment for 2 weeks was made for the delivery of the permanent FIX on SIX detachable-removable bridge. Two weeks later, the patient returned, and the temporary was removed. The FIX on SIX detachable-removable roundhouse restoration was then placed (Figures 9 to 12). The FIX on SIX restoration had good aesthetics, and the patient was happy (Figure 13 to 15). The patient was given a Shatkin Water Flosser and a Sonicare (Philips Oral Healthcare) toothbrush. These are provided as a part of the treatment to our mini implant patients for optimal home care. These have been very successful hygiene tools to keep the soft tissues healthy and clean between checkups, when the FIX on SIX is removed.\n\nCLOSING COMMENTS\n\nThis article presents an alternative to All-on-4 that is less expensive, less invasive and painful, and demonstrates faster results while utilizing zirconia, a strong and biocompatible dental material. FIX on SIX is a beautiful zirconia restoration that can be removed by the clinician while providing the patients with the feel and aesthetics of a fixed prosthesis. Creating a fixed prosthesis that is able to withstand the occlusal forces applied, while providing cosmetic appeal and patient satisfaction, is an enduring task for all dentists.11 Today in dentistry, zirconia has traditionally been used in fixed partial dentures as tooth-supported restorations.9,10 With most cases that use zirconia as a fixed restoration, high success rates have been recorded, mostly higher than 95%.9 Zirconia’s ability to increase the durability of a prosthesis by up to 30% to 40% has made it a good candidate for use in fixed-hybrid cases.11 The use of CT technology increases zirconia’s stability in conjunction with decreasing failure rates of these restorations, due to the industrial processing. In this case study, the patient was dissatisfied with his upper denture because of cracks in the acrylic along the palate, and the dentures were not comfortable to wear, and food would trap under them. By designing a fixed zirconia bridge (FIX on SIX) instead of acrylic dentures or a hybrid acrylic fixed bridge, the patient will no longer have these negative experiences. The use of zirconia instead of acrylic increases durability of the prosthesis while also offering the comfort of fixed restoration and healthier surrounding gingival tissues.\n\n13: MDI ClinicalStudies from AroundTheUSA\n\nProvo,Utah 2010\n\nThe Truth About SMALL Diameter Implants\n\nImplants Dent Today. 2010 May;29(5):116, 118, 120.\n\nChristensen GJ1, Child PL.\n\nhttp://www.dentistrytoday.com/\n\narticles/178-articles\n\nmagazine/\n\ndental-products/2646-the-truth-\n\nabout-small-diameter-implants\n\nAbstract\n\nSDIs that are treatment planned correctly, placed and loaded properly, and are within a well-adjusted occlusion, are working in an EXCELLENT manner for the patients described in this article.\n\nIt is time for those practitioners unfamiliar with SDIs and their uses to discontinue their discouragement of this technique.\n\nSDIs are easily placed, minimally invasive, and a true service to those patients described.

Christensen, DDS, MSD, PhD\n\nhttp://jada.ada.org March 2006 387 Copyright ©2006 American Dental Association.\n\nJADA, Vol. 137\n\nhttp://www.smileartsny.com/wp-content/\n\nuploads/download.pdf\n\nWhat Are Mini- Implants\n\nWhen the original root-form implants were introduced, they had a diameter of about 3.75 millimeters.\n\nAlthough I have heard various REASONS for selection of this diameter, the LOGIC for RESEARCH supporting these reasons has been UNCLEAR .\n\nAn implant of nearly 4 mm in diameter requires at least 6 mm of bone in a facial-lingual dimension for placement without grafting additional bone to augment the site.\n\nAfter years of placing implants in all locations of the mouth, it is my observation that SELDOM do I see 6 mm of bone in a facial-lingual dimension.\n\nOften, an osteotome must be used to widen the osteotomy and the minimal bone, thereby allowing placement of the 3.75-mm implant in the less-than-adequately sized bony site.\n\nIn the last few years, root- form implants ranging from 1.8 mm to slightly more than 2 mm in diameter have been promoted for long-term service.\n\nIN WHAT SITUATIONS ARE MINI-IMPLANTS INDICATED?\n\nIn my opinion, I find MORE indications for narrow-diameter implants (≈ 1.8 mm) than for STANDARD- diameter implants\n\n(≈3.75 mm).\n\nWhen inadequate bone is present for placement of standard-diameter implants, most practitioners have been taught to suggest bone grafting, either using autogenous bone (from various sites in the patient’s body) or one of the many available bone substi- tutes. However, few patients desire to have, or can afford, bone grafting. The expense of dental implants already is prohibitive for most patients, without the added cost, trauma, pain and uncertainty of bone grafting. In my opinion, if dental implants are ever to achieve their optimum service potential for typical, average-income dental patients, methods need to be found to allow placement of implants in areas of remaining natural bone, using minimally invasive procedures without grafting. The mini-diameter implants have the potential to assist this challenge.\n\nExtra support and retention under fixed partial dentures (FPDs).\n\nOccasionally, situations arise in which an FPD is planned that has questionable potential retention from natural teeth, and the patient has refused RPD treatment or grafting and standard implants. Mini-implants can be placed in the edentulous areas and used to support the PONTIC AREAS of the FPD. When an FPD becomes loose on one end, and the prosthesis can be removed from the other abutment without destroying it, the prosthesis often can be salvaged. A small- diameter implant is placed in the pontic area, a hole is cut in the underside of the pontic, the abutment retainers of the FPD are cleaned and roughened internally, and the FPD is re- cemented using the mini- implant as additional support and retention under the pontic. Research is under way to study the long-term use of small- diameter implants as the full support and retention for fixed partial dentures.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThere is no question that dental implants have been the most influential change in dentistry during the last half-century. In general, they are well-proven and highly useful. However, the diameter of standard implants (≈ 3.75 mm), along with the fre- quent need to graft bone to allow for their placement, have limited their use for those who most need implants. The introduction, approval and continuing observation of success of smaller-diameter mini-implants have stimulated use of implants in situations in which standard- sized implants could not have been used without grafting. The result has been more patients who have been served successfully at reduced cost with minimized pain and trauma patients who could not have been treated with implants otherwise. Continuing research is needed for further verification of the acceptability of mini- implants.\n\n15: MDI ClinicalStudies from AroundTheUSA\n\nProvo,Utah 2008\n\nCritical Appraisal MINI IMPLANTS: GOOD OR BAD FOR LONG-TERM ? 2008\n\nAuthor Gordon J.

It was refreshing to be with a group of fellow practitioners were attempting to provide OPTIMUM services for patients with the MINIMUM amount of treatment.\n\nOFTEN ,patients do not have the minimum six millimeters of bone in a facial-lingual dimension needed for placement of conventional 4-mm–diameter implants.\n\nThe use of “mini” 1.8-mm–diameter implants allows conservative placement of implants in bone that is only 3 mm thick in a facial-lingual dimension, thus avoiding bone grafting and significant trauma and expense for patients.\n\nPlacement of these SMALL-diameter implants in MULTIPLES should be considered for optimum resistance and retention of FIXED or removable prostheses.\n\nOne widely used brand of mini-implants is IMTEC Sendax MDI (IMTEC, Ardmore, Pa.); another brand is MTI Monorail System (Dentatus, New York). Mini-implants’ minimal cost and ease of placement make them desirable to patients and dentists.2\n\n18: MDI ClinicalStudies from AroundTheUSA\n\nProvo,Utah 2008\n\nChristensen ’embarrassed’ by U.S. dentistry DrBicuspid 2008\n\nBy Laird Harrison, Senior Editor\n\nhttps://www.drbicuspid.com/index.aspx\n\n?sec=ser&sub=def&pag=dis&ItemID=301126\n\nOctober 28, 2008 — The granddad of U.S. dentistry is ashamed of his family.\n\n“What we do in America is embarrassing,” Gordon Christensen, D.D.S., M.S., Ph.D., said at the ADA meeting in San Antonio this month.\n\nWith his Clinicians Report review, Scottsdale Center for Dentistry courses, frequent bylines in the Journal of the American Dental Association, and popular talks at dental meetings, Dr. Christensen may be the most influential U.S. dentist. So it means something when he deplores the state of the profession in his own country. Dr. Christensen offered several unfavorable comparisons between dentistry in the U.S. and other countries during a panel discussion about controversies in dentistry, which he moderated at the ADA meeting. He also touched on such questions as mini-implants, cracked teeth, light-activated whitening, and articaine. He mentioned his embarrassment in the context of choosing when a crown is appropriate.\n\nHe said many U.S. dentists place porcelain fused to metal (PFM) crowns in cases in which he might recommend an onlay.\n\n“We don’t have to go hog wild with the crowns,” he said. “The typical PFM crown in the U.S. is hideous, absolutely hideous. I go to Switzerland and I have to take my very best stuff because I’m embarrassed by a lot of the stuff we do in America.” The biggest dental organization in the U.S. had no reaction to this criticism. An ADA spokesperson said the association declined to comment. Dr. Christensen did offer a saving grace with regard to U.S. crowns. “We’re doing it at a very moderate level of cost: $800 to $1,000 is the average, where over there you will find $3,000.” But in general, U.S. dentists are losing credibility, he warned. He showed results from a poll in which dentistry had dropped lower in comparison to other professions. “You can see where we are — we’re No. 5. We used to be, believe it not, No. 1. Are we going in the right direction?” Dr. Christensen suggested U.S. dentists have gotten behind on technological trends. When he polled the audience to see how many were using electric handpieces, he noted that, “If I were in London right now or Zurich, all of you would raise your hands.”\n\nBehind on implants\n\nDr. Christensen also argued that more general dentists in the U.S. should place implants. He estimated that only 6% to 15% of U.S. dentists are placing them now. “I’ve been doing implants for over 20 years,” said Dr. Christensen, who is a prosthodontist. “I find it’s one of the simpler things that I do. There are so many things that are more aggressive and more threatening than doing an implant on a healthy person with good bones…. It’s simpler than doing a third molar extraction.\n\nYes, you ought to be doing it.”\n\nAnd once again he said that dentists in other countries are ahead of the U.S. “In Israel, a developing country, 95% are doing dental implants, in Latin America 50% to 60%.”\n\nDr. Christensen added that dentists should NOT shy away from mini-implants. “Yes, they should be used,” he said. “There are 40 million edentulous people in the United States, and I would guess at least two-thirds or three-quarters of them don’t have enough bone for a normal implant.”\n\nMini-implants can also save money for frugal patients, he added. “If one of them falls out, big whoopee.\n\nIt has expanded the bone, and so when you take it out within even a few weeks, the bone has come back. It’s not like a normal implant with a big hole you need to drain…. Move it over 3 mm and screw in again.”\n\nBut technique is important when using these smaller implants.\n\n“They’ve got to be put in right,” Dr. Christensen noted. ”\n\n“Two minis in a surface area of 1.8 mm equals one standard implant, 3.75 [mm].\n\nSo put in TWO for ONE and keep them LOW like a sports car, not like an SUV.”\n\nBehind in radiography\n\nDr. Christensen also argued that “we’re way behind other countries” in adopting digital x-ray equipment. He uses digital himself, in part because of the ease of storing images. But he offered a less than ringing endorsement of the latest high-tech imaging systems, such as standard computed tomography (CT) or cone-beam CT. “You lose the definition, the contrast,” Dr. Christensen said. “You’ve got multiple shades of grey…. Almost every one of those that are digital [radiographs] is second class to an analog radiograph. Period. Exclamation mark. To make them as good, not better, you have to enhance color and texture and go from there.” He said he likes conventional (as opposed to computerized) tomography for planning implants, though periapical radiographs help him “a lot” and panoramic helps “some.” Opinions, opinions\n\nDr. Christensen also offered his characteristic strong opinions on a wide range of other topics:\n\n• Restoration materials: He pointed to a poll of the American Academy of Esthetic Dentistry. “When asked, esthetic dentists said in their own mouth on second molars, upper molars they want gold. First molars on the lower they want gold. First molars upper they want metal occlusals with porcelain facials. When they got to the premolars and forward, they started talking white.” But in their patients, he said, the same dentists rarely use gold, but instead place white materials all over.\n\n• Light-activated whitening: The lights used don’t get hot enough to make a significant difference, Dr. Christensen said.\n\n• Cracked teeth: There are many types of cracks — superficial cracks in enamel, cracks that extend below the gingival, and cracks that go below the bone. “So here’s my approach: I’ll tell the patient I don’t know where this crack is. I haven’t the slightest idea. I’ll show the patient a video. It shows them these different kinds of cracks,” he said. He then prepares the tooth. A crack that extends below the gingiva but not the bone will fly off during the preparation. ”If it’s down further, slightly under the bone or more under the bone, I don’t know if I can heal it or not. So I’m going to cut the crack and put a provisional on it with Eugenol cement,” Dr. Christensen said. Three or four days later, he asks the patient to bite on a pencil. If the tooth still hurts, he gives the patient a choice between root canal therapy and an extraction.\n\n• Evidence-based medicine: “I get nauseated when I hear this phrase,” he said. Although physician David Sackett, M.D., the father of “evidence-based medicine,” originally incorporated clinical experience into his definition of the phrase, Dr. Christensen complained that too many people in dentistry have forgotten that aspect. “We have got it totally wrong in dentistry right now,” he said. “It’s as if we never had evidence before…. Third parties are using it to our disadvantage.”\n\n• Articaine: U.S. dentists have more problems with paresthesia than European dentists, Dr. Christensen said, because they work too fast and use too large a dose of the anesthetic.\n\n• Bruxism: Dentists should be making more splints, he said. “One-third of the world’s population has aggressive chewing habits. We’re negligent if we don’t say to the patient, ‘You’re chewing your teeth down. Look at mine, I’m 90 years old and mine are long. Look at yours, they’re little bloody nubbins.’ “ What if the patient balks? “A typical bruxing person chews his or her teeth up to six hours a night. A normal person has only a few minutes of tooth contact a day,” Dr. Christensen said. “So I often say, ‘You’re going to have 50 or a 100 days’ wear on your teeth tonight. You need something in there. And if you don’t wear it, you’re going to have teeth looking like this’ — and I show them a picture.”\n\nThe session ended at that point, but Dr. Christensen looked ready to offer opinions as long as anyone would listen.

What I object to is the misconception that US dentistry is, or has ever been, the torch bearer for dental healthcare internationally. Why should Dr. Christensen be shocked to find excellence in dental care in Switzerland, or for that matter, Sweden, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan or China? There are excellent training programs in many parts of the world, and in many instances the time spent in training is longer than in the USA and the dental institutions providing the training are extremely well-equipped.\n\nIn the USA it is only a recent trend that Dental SCHOOLS have also been viewed as having an important role in dental healthcare for the community. That has happened largely due to state funding drying up and Deans finding that clinical income is often more reliable as an income source than grants and contracts for research. Further, we have essentially reached the limit to the levels to which tuition can be increased given the present state of the economy. Elsewhere, the Dental HOSPITAL has been a center of the highest standards of dental care and a valuable assistance for dental practitioners faced with cases too difficult for them to handle. The equipment comes largely for healthcare rather than for training new dentists alone, and the student dentists get a tremendous exposure to a variety of patient needs and conditions.\n\nSo, yes, some dentists in the USA do provide suboptimal care – as do some dentists in most other countries, but nobody should be surprised that excellence in dental care can be found in countries other than the USA.\n\nAllan G.

So the costs and skill level is greater for inlays/onlays then it is for a crown. Yet, the insurance companies will be pay more for crowns then for inlays/onlays. So we wonder why more crowns are done then inlays or onlays. This is just economic reality for most patients and dentists.\n\n11/6/2008 8:22:46 PM\n\nHershey\n\nWhy is this news? The educational institutions in this country both Public and Private are charging top dollar for inferior education, using information from books that get cover facelifts but not content facelifts. I am a new graduate and I had to relearn dentistry in the past three years using European Texts and Journals. Heck the board exams practice unethical behavior by making practitioners create cavitations in sound teeth that only have radiographic evidence of minor dentin demineralization, how archaic. GV Black techniques are still performed, and this is supposed to be a modern profession? I speak to older dentists and I ask them about the benefits of Glass Ionomers and they look at me with a blank stare! I explain that restorative dentistry for non cavitated lesions is not indicated and could be actually doing harm to the patient and I get angry stares. Yes Insurance companies are dangerous for the single reason that they must show profit growth to Wall Stree every quarter, and of course they like crowns because that allows them to raise premiums which is a dirty way to show positive growth on Wall Street. Dentists love it because they can bang out crowns from China with huge profit margins, everybody is quite happy. Until the patient shows up in 12 months with lots of problems because we failed to treat the underlying disease of pathogenic bacteria. Now we have patients that have lost confidence in this profession because we became salesmen and lost our way of acting like DOCTORS. We need to shape up real fast, start treating the underlying disease and stop thinking that restorative dentistry is a cure for anything, its NOT! Restorative dentistry fills things, replaces things, it DOES NOT CURE antything. There would be no specialty of Endodontics if restorative dentistry cured dental disease remember that fact. We need to place pressure on insurance companies to start reimbursing for PREVENTION AND HYGIENE. Lets give young men and women advice to learn about Dental Hygiene send them to appropriate schools, lets expand our practices to focus on bi-monthly, tri monthly hygiene to actually improve the oral health of our population. Lets push insurance companies to reimburse for Fluoride Varnish treatments. Lets put pressure on the pharmaceutical industry to perfect fluoride and chlorhexidine delivery systems to get our high risk patients under control outside of the office. Lets face it, patients are only in our offices for a few hours per year, we are not really changing their oral health, its what they are doing outside of the office that is changing their health. We need to REFOCUS our way of practicing to meet the future of changing ECONOMICS and DEMOGRAPHICS so that we can regain the confidence of our patients that we actually treat their diseases with long term strategies that are effective.

HOW CAN HE GENERALIZE like that!!!! I am enraged by his comments. It demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the complexity and multifaceted dilemma facing American dentists in today’s market. He is out of touch. It is 7 PM and I am still at my office finishing up my clinical notes. I began the day at 7 AM. I won’t get home much before 9 and I won’t make it to the gym today. Why?? Because in many American cities unfortunately, insurance companies control the market and we as care givers have to jump through hoops in order to comply. In order for me to “make it” and do what is right for my patients I have to see many patients during the course of a day. And the reason is quite simple; because the fee they “grant” us per service (dictated by the insurance mafia) is extremely low…..an insult in fact. I do end up treating my patients with more difficult and time-consuming restorations (inlays, onlays) even when the fees are lower than for the crown…….because it is the right thing to do. You don’t want to get me rolling in that direction…………..\n\nThat kind of statement makes me sick. A terrible way to end my long day. What kind of an embassador do we have representing U.S. dentistry?? Who made him our embassador?? I certainly didn’t vote for him to fill that role…….. Aren’t any of you absolutely disgusted by his posture and pontification?? Isn’t it time that dentists begin to crawl out of their holes and make a stand?? I happen to have lectured abroad as well and I have seen a MUCH LOWER LEVEL of care IN GENERAL in other countries than here in the U.S. Dr. Christensen is dealing with the “elite” of dentistry; those dentists are not the rank and file we find in the trenches. I have seen first hand TERRIBLE examples of dentistry in Europe and Asia……..TERRIBLE; assistants placing composite restorations without bonding, archaic stainless steel crowns sold as permanent restorations, assistants actually preparing teeth and more; why doesn’t he mention that…If I’ve seen it, certainly he must have seen it abroad!!!!!!!! I am sickened by what I see. It’s an outrage…………\n\nFlat\n\n19: MDI ClinicalStudies from AroundTheUSA\n\nProvo,Utah 2005\n\nDental Economics 12-1-05 Ask Dr. Christensen\n\n12/01/2005\n\nIn this monthly feature, Dr. Gordon Christensen addresses the most frequently asked questions from Dental Economics® readers. If you would like to submit a question to Dr. Christensen, please send an e-mail to info@pccdental.com.\n\nQuestion …\n\nI have noticed with interest the growing popularity of the so-called “mini” implants, some of which have diameters about half the size of standard-sized implants. Are these implants successful?\n\nAnswer from Dr. Christensen …\n\nI have used mini implants for both provisional and final purposes for several years. In both situations, they have been highly successful. Implant manufacturers report their most popular standard implant diameter is about 3.75 mm. After recognizing the success of these standard-size implants, I was skeptical about the use of narrow-diameter implants that were less than 1.8 mm in diameter. Would they be strong enough? Would they integrate with bone as adequately as the larger implants? Could they be used in both fixed and removable prosthesis situations? Some implant “authorities” condemned the mini implant concept from its inception, which made me even more anxious. Nevertheless, I started using these implants several years ago. Remarkably, the mini implant not only worked, but the technique was far less invasive and easier on me and the patients than the standard root-form implant procedure. I will state my observations of the mini implant concept, and you can make your own conclusions, based on the needs of patients in your practice.\n\n• Amount of bone present. If a potential implant patient does not have approximately 6 mm of bone in a facial-lingual dimension and 10 mm of bone in a crestal-apical dimension, placement of a standard root-form implant is not feasible without grafting. I have successfully placed many mini implants in bone that were only 3 mm wide in a facial-lingual dimension and at least 10 mm wide in a crestal-apical direction. This saves the patient money, trauma, time, and frustration.\n\n• Financial resources of the patient. Today, one typical root-form implant placed in the United States costs a patient about $1,500 without the abutment. The cost of mini implants for practitioners is a fraction of the cost of standard implants. Therefore, most practitioners can afford to place at least two and maybe three mini implants for a fee similar to placing one standard-size implant.\n\n• Invasiveness of the clinical procedure. If adequate bone is present, many mini implants can be placed without reflecting the soft tissue, making a minimally invasive procedure.\n\n• Immediate loading. The manufacturers of mini implants usually suggest immediate implant- loading with which I have had significant success. As an example, patients with poorly retentive removable or complete dentures often eat a normal meal on the day of mini implant placement. They do so with their previously made dentures now stabilized with mini implants. Of course, bone integration still requires several months during which time patients can eat in a normal manner. In summary, do you have patients who have too little bone for standard implants, inadequate financial resources, fear of the typical implant surgery procedure, and the desire to eat easily immediately after implant placement? Of course you do! With proper patient-informed consent about the minimal long-term research on mini implants, and the relatively recent introduction of the mini implant concept, what other choices do you have for many of your patients? Two of our video productions are available for further information. V2300, “Making Decisions About the Successful Use of Implants,” shows the clinical situations in which standard root-form implants can be used; and C900A, “The Mini Implant for General Practitioners,” shows the placement of a mini implant in a simple case.\n\nQuestion …\n\nWhen can “mini” implants be used, and when should conventional 3-4 mm diameter implants be used?\n\nAnswer from Dr. Christensen …\n\nAfter several years of using mini implants for long-term service, I have the following observations for your consideration:\n\n➥ Standard size root-form implants are well proven, and in my opinion, should be used whenever possible. When minimal bone is present in a facial-lingual dimension (less than 6 mm), 10 or more millimeters of bone is present in a crestal-apical dimension, and grafting is not feasible, then mini implants should be considered.\n\n➥ As with all procedures, patient-informed consent is mandatory with this concept. Patients should be advised that these implants are being used throughout the world, but they have not been subjected to long-term research such as that done on standard-sized implants. Patients should be informed that, in the event of a failure, removal of the mini implant is simple and replacement is not difficult.\n\n➥ In the event of minimal bone presence – such as 3 or 4 mm in a facial-lingual dimension – reflection of soft tissue is highly desirable to afford optimum vision and adequate mini implant placement.\n\n➥ When using mini implants in situations such as under a complete denture, I suggest that two mini implants should be used where one standard-sized conventional implant would be considered adequate. As an example, four mini implants – two placed in or near each canine area under a complete denture – should be placed instead of two standard implants, one in each canine area. Placement of four mini implants minimizes the possibility of implant rotation as they are integrating into the bone.\n\n➥ As necessary with all implants, patients should be advised to practice excellent oral hygiene. In summary, when adequate bone is not present in a facial-lingual dimension and adequate bone is present in a crestal-apical dimension, and when patients do not want to have bone grafting, then mini implants should be considered. Adequate patient-informed consent should be delivered. Dr. Christensen is a practicing prosthodontist in Provo, Utah.

The criticisms that I have occasionally heard make me nervous. Should I continue to use them or are there some reservations?\n\nA Thanks for your candid question. I will answer it using research, clinical observations, and my own opinions. I will also make suggestions relative to why a few practitioners have had some failures with small diameter implants (SDIs) or “minis.” You know as well as I do that many patients do not have adequate native bone quantity or quality to place conventional diameter implants, which require at least 6 mm of bone in a facial–lingual dimension, and 10 mm in an occlusal–apical dimension or significant bone grafting. SDIs often can be placed in 3 mm to 4 mm of bone in a facial–lingual dimension and 10 mm in an occlusal–apical dimension. Many patients, especially those in their senior years, cannot tolerate significant surgery, including bone–grafting. They are frequently physically or financially disadvantaged, which further limits their acceptance of conventional diameter implant therapy. SDIs are a proven alternative for many of these patients. As you may know, the FDA clearance for small–diameter implants (<3 mm in diameter) for “long–term use” came in 1997.This FDA clearance came many years after the FDA clearance of conventional diameter (>3 mm in diameter) implants in the late 1970s. Obviously, conventional–diameter implants have proven themselves over decades of use, experimentation, and refinement. In my opinion, root form implants are the most important innovation in dentistry since the air rotor in the late 1950s, and they are now considered a routine part of oral therapy. On the other hand, research on SDIs for long–term use has had only about 12 years to mature. Many innovations in SDIs have taken place during that time, but refinements are still coming, and additional manufacturers are entering the SDI marketplace. As a result, some experienced dentists who have been successfully placing conventional–diameter implants have been skeptical about the long–term effectiveness potential of SDIs. Thus, the active controversy about this subject has continued. Both general dentists and specialists of all varieties are placing implants. There is no specialty for implant placement, although some groups want to claim ownership of this area of dentistry. As an experienced surgically–oriented board–certified prosthodontist, I can say without reservation that a properly educated dentist of any orientation can successfully place root–form implants of any diameter in healthy patients who have adequate bone. I deny the allegations that root–form implant placement is a complex and difficult procedure for dentists who have had proper education and guidance on implant placement. Many other areas of dentistry are more challenging than implant placement. SDIs are certainly no exception. The research on the success of small–diameter implants speaks for itself! Research projects on long–term service of SDIs show more than 90% retention of thousands of SDIs over various periods of time and for a variety of uses. The success percentages rival closely those of conventional–diameter implants. My conclusion on the success of SDIs is that if practitioners are not having success with SDIs, they must be doing something wrong. I will direct the remainder of my answer to that point — i.e., what can you do wrong in diagnosis and treatment–planning, placement, and restoration of SDIs?\n\nDiagnosis and treatment–planning\n\nBone quality and quantity vary enormously from patient to patient. In case you are not clear on bone classifications, the four classifications (as described by Misch) of oral bone are:\n\n1. D1 — Dense compact, resorbed anterior mandible\n\n2. D2 — Dense to porous compact on the outside and coarse trabecular bone on the inside, anterior and posterior mandible, occasionally anterior maxilla\n\n3. D3 — Thinner porous compact bone on the outside and fine trabecular bone on the inside, anterior and posterior maxilla and posterior mandible\n\n4. D4 — Fine trabecular with little or no cortical bone, posterior maxilla\n\nSDIs range from 1.8 mm to 2.9 mm in diameter. Thus, they are not wide enough to reach dense cortical bone on the facial and lingual surfaces if the facial–lingual bone dimension is wide. Wider–diameter conventional implants are recommended in those areas (4, 5, and 6 mm diameter). The most appropriate locations for SDIs are in dense bone, D1, frequently D2, and D3 when the facial–lingual bone dimension is narrow. D4 is never an appropriate location. If the preceding statements are not recognized and used as guidance for diagnosis and treatment–planning, the SDIs will fail.\n\nRadiographs that show only two–dimensional, panoramic, periapical, or bitewing views do not show the density of bone in a facial–lingual dimension. Tomographic or cone–beam radiographs are strongly recommended before placing any diameter of implant to allow visualization of bone characteristics in a facial–lingual dimension. These types of radiographs are available in most communities if you do not have that capability yourself. If the bone appears to be porous in any dimension, conventional–diameter implants are a better choice than SDIs. Patients having the previously described bone characteristics — i.e., at least 3 or more mm of bone in a facial–lingual dimension and at least 10 mm of bone in an occlusal–apical dimension — are excellent candidates for SDIs (see Fig. 1).\n\nPlacement of small-diameter implants\n\nCurrently, the most popular SDI brands listed in order of decreasing use are: MDI from Imtec, a 3M Company (Ardmore, Okla.); Atlas by Dentatus (New York, N.Y.), and the ERA Implant System by Sterngold (Attleboro, Mass.). Several other brands are on the market, and others are coming. When adequate bone is present as described, SDIs may be placed without making a surgical flap. How"
