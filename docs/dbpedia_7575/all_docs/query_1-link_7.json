        "text": "The warmest ever 6th of January on record in the Croatian capital was recorded yesterday.\n\nTemperatures reached a high of 18°C on Saturday, 6th of January 2018, the warmest since measurements began nearly 70 years ago, RTL reports.\n\nIt was not only Zagreb which enjoyed warm temperatures. The second highest temperature of the day recorded in Croatia surprisingly came in the east of the country in Osijek, where temperatures hit 17°C.\n\nIt was warmer in inland Croatia, and even in Slavonia, than it was on the usually warmer Dalmatian coast, where temperatures reached between 13°C – 15°C.\n\nThis time last year temperatures were deep in the minuses around Croatia. On 6th of January 2017, in Split, it was -4°C was a strong, bitter-cold wind blowing.\n\nThere is no sign of snow over the next 10 days, but temperatures will drop below double-digits later next week."
