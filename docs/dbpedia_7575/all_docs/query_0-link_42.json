        "text": "This post covers the weather in Philadelphia in February, including average temperatures, average rain and snow, as well as tips on what to wear.\n\nIn addition to being your tour guide, my background as a retired meteorologist allows me to provide you with accurate and thorough weather forecasts for this month, ensuring that you have all the information you need to prepare for and enjoy our tour regardless of the weather conditions.\n\nTemperatures\n\nRain and Snow\n\nWhat to Wear\n\nThings to Do\n\nWeather in January\n\nTemperatures\n\nDaytime high temperatures tend to be around 39-42 F (4-6 C) early in the month, warming gradually to 46-48 F (8-9 C) near the end of the month.\n\nA few of the warmer days, especially later in the month, can reach up near 62 F (17 C).\n\nThe record high temperature in Philadelphia during February is 74 F (23.3 C).\n\nLate night and early morning low temperatures tend to average around 25-26 F (-3 to -4 C) early in the month, warming slowly to around 30-31 F (-1 C) near the end of the month.\n\nA few of the colder mornings, especially early in the month, can dip down to near 14 F (-10 C).\n\nThe record low temperature in Philadelphia during February is -3 F (-19.4 C).\n\nSky, Rain, and Snow\n\nDuring February you can expect, on average, about 7 sunny, 7 partly sunny and 14 mostly cloudy days.\n\nSome precipitation falls on about 10 days this month, however, only about 2 days, on average, record 0.5 inches (12.7 mm) or more.\n\nSnow falls on about 4 days this month.\n\nHowerver, only 2 days record at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of snow, 1 day with at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) and accumulations of 5 inches (12.7 cm) or more in any one day occurs about once every other year.\n\nDaylight\n\nThe number of daylight hours increases this month from about 10.2 hours on the 1st to about 11.3 hours by the 28th.\n\nWindspeed\n\nWind speeds are mostly light to gentle at 4-12 mph (6-19 kph) but can occasionally be moderate at 13-18 mph (20-28 kph).\n\nWhat to Wear in Philadelphia During February?\n\nDress for winter as Philadelphia can be quite cold this month. You should pack a Winter coat, warm hat, gloves, a few scarfs, some warm socks, and a couple of sweaters.\n\nIn addition, some thermals and at least one pair of waterproof boots will come in handy.\n\nAlso consider packing a lighter-weight coat for the few warmer afternoons near the end of the month.\n\nThings to Do in Philadelphia During February\n\nAlthough the weather might warm up a bit this month, it will still be quite cold, so you might not want to spend too much time outdoors.\n\nThat said, if you're willing to brave the cold weather, you might want to look into one of our free Philadelphia walking tours.\n\nIf you want to avoid the weather, consider seeing a Philadelphia Flyers (NHL) or Philadelphia 76ers (NBA) game instead.\n\nThe Philadelphia Ballet will also be performing this month, as will several musicians including Carrie Underwood and America.\n\nFor even more ideas, make sure to read our full post covering things to do in Philadelphia in February.\n\nFred Pickhardt\n\nOcean Weather Services"
