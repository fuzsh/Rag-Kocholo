The present Rejoinder is submitted in accordance with Article 45(2) of the Rules of Court\n\nand the Court’s Orders of 8 October 2021, 8 April 2022, 15 December 2022, and 3\n\nFebruary 2023.\n\n2. As explained in the Russian Federation’s Counter-Memorial, Ukraine’s claims under the\n\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (the\n\n“ICSFT”) and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial\n\nDiscrimination (the “CERD”) are without merit and should be dismissed in their entirety.\n\nPursuant to Article 49(3) of the Rules of Court, this Rejoinder does not repeat the\n\narguments set out in the Counter-Memorial (which are maintained in full), but is instead\n\nlimited to responding to Ukraine’s Reply, focusing on “the issues that still divide” the\n\nParties.\n\n3. Before going into the substance of Ukraine’s claims as they have been recast in the Reply,\n\nsome introductory observations are in order:\n\n(a) The Russian Federation’s approach in the present case is straightforward. It consists\n\nof: (i) interpreting the scope and content of the obligations arising under the ICSFT\n\nand the CERD in accordance with the rules enshrined in the Vienna Convention on\n\nthe Law of Treaties (the “VCLT”); (ii) pointing to the evidentiary standards\n\napplicable in order to establish a breach of those obligations; and (iii) demonstrating\n\nthat Ukraine’s allegations do not fall within the scope of the relevant treaties and\n\ndo not meet the necessary evidentiary threshold. Interestingly, Ukraine refers to the\n\nRussian Federation’s approach as “legalistic” and suggests that it seeks to avoid\n\nresponsibility.1 If by “legalistic” Ukraine means that the Russian Federation’s\n\nposition is in accordance with the existing law, then it would appear that no real\n\ndisagreement exists between the Parties, and that Ukraine attempts to put forward\n\na case that cannot be sustained in law. Furthermore, the question is not one of the\n\nRussian Federation trying to “avoid” international responsibility, as Ukraine\n\nimproperly tries to characterise the Russian Federation’s position. Like in any other\n\n1 See Reply, ¶¶11-13.\n\nPage 11 out of 541\n\ncase before the Court, what must be determined is simply whether a State is\n\nresponsible for a violation of international law or not.\n\n(b) Instead of properly engaging with the Russian Federation’s legal arguments,\n\nUkraine seeks to rely on the political context and portrays this case as concerning\n\n“a brazen and comprehensive assault on human rights and international law in the\n\nterritory of Ukraine” and a “fundamental disregard for the human rights of the\n\npeople of Ukraine”.2 Thus, Ukraine’s Reply is replete with irrelevant accusations\n\nof “unlawful aggression against Ukraine”, “unlawful occupation of Ukrainian\n\nterritory” and violations of international humanitarian law, which, as the Court\n\nalready established, do not form part of the subject-matter of the present Case.3\n\n(c) The Reply reveals Ukraine’s true purpose in pursuing these proceedings. Indeed,\n\nUkraine is not genuinely concerned with the question whether the Russian\n\nFederation complied with its obligations under the ICSFT and the CERD (which it\n\nalways did), or with the question what the Court may decide on important issues\n\nrelating to terrorist financing and racial discrimination. Ukraine’s claims have\n\ninstead been artificially constructed as part of Ukraine’s broader “lawfare”\n\ncampaign against the Russian Federation, which concerns issues that are manifestly\n\nnot governed by these treaties. It is as self-evident that Ukraine’s real goal is\n\nchallenging the legal status of Crimea, branding the people in the Donbass region\n\nwho oppose the oppression of the Kiev regime as “terrorists”, and even having the\n\nCourt characterise the Russian Federation as a “terrorist State”.\n\n(d) The absurdity of Ukraine’s claims is further highlighted by the fact that Ukraine\n\nitself has been, and continues to be, engaged in the same kind of actions that it\n\nalleges to be in violation of the ICSFT and the CERD. Since 2014, the Ukrainian\n\nArmed Forces (the “UAF”) have carried out constant shelling and bombing against\n\nresidential areas and civilian infrastructure – including schools and hospitals –\n\nthereby killing and wounding thousands of civilians, including children, women\n\n2 Reply, ¶14.\n\n3 See Application of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and of the\n\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Ukraine v. Russian\n\nFederation), Provisional Measures, Order of 19 April 2017, I.C.J. Reports 2017 (“Order of 19 April 2017”), pp.\n\n113, 172, ¶¶16, 76; Preliminary Objections, Judgment of 8 November 2019, I.C.J. Reports 2019 (“Judgment of 8\n\nNovember 2019”), pp. 577, 585, ¶¶29, 59.\n\nPage 12 out of 541\n\nand the elderly. Ukraine has blocked vital supplies of food, water, and medicine to\n\nthe people of Donbass and Crimea, causing an immeasurable humanitarian crisis.\n\nIt has persecuted Russians in Donbass and now in the entirety of Ukraine.\n\nAlarmingly, the Ukrainian Government supports and promotes Neo-Nazi ideology\n\ninherited from World War II collaborators and criminals, which is contrary to the\n\nvery spirit of the CERD.\n\n(e) At each stage of the proceedings Ukraine has attempted to recast its claims.\n\nWhether the Russian Federation financed “terrorist activities” in Donbass or\n\nwhether there was an alleged “campaign of racial discrimination” in Crimea appears\n\nno longer to be the focus of Ukraine’s case. Instead, in its Reply Ukraine\n\nconcentrated on alleged incidents of non-cooperation under the ICSFT and on\n\nindividual allegations of discrimination under the CERD, which Ukraine apparently\n\nconsiders to be easier to prove.\n\n(f) No matter what the strategy of Ukraine is, its case under each of the treaties in\n\nquestion is manifestly without merit. At the provisional measures stage, the Court\n\nfound most of Ukraine’s claims to be implausible. Since then, Ukraine has failed\n\nto provide any legal argument or evidence that would lead to a different conclusion.\n\n(g) As the Russian Federation noted in its Counter-Memorial, Ukraine’s Application to\n\nthe International Court of Justice of 16 January 2017 formally concerns alleged\n\nviolations of both the ICSFT and the CERD. However, it actually concerns two\n\nentirely separate cases which have in common only the use of the Court’s forum in\n\nan attempt to stigmatise the Russian Federation.\n\n4. This Rejoinder is divided into two parts: Part One shows that Ukraine has not established\n\nany violation of the ICSFT by the Russian Federation; and Part Two demonstrates that\n\nUkraine has not established any violation of the CERD by the Russian Federation.\n\n5. The Russian Federation reserves the right to ask the Court for authorisation to make\n\nfurther arguments and to submit further evidence, including in response to any material\n\nthat Ukraine reserved the right to submit under Article 56(2) of the Rules of the Court.4\n\n4 Reply, ¶9.\n\nPage 13 out of 541\n\nPART 1\n\nAPPLICATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE\n\nSUPPRESSION OF THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM\n\nPage 14 out of 541\n\nPage 15 out of 541\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\n6. Ukraine’s arguments on the ICSFT have significantly changed since the Memorial.\n\nInitially, Ukraine’s primary argument was that the Russian Federation financed terrorist\n\nactivities in Ukraine. The Court, however, then found in its Judgment of 8 November\n\n2019 that the “financing by a State of acts of terrorism is not addressed by the ICSFT”\n\nand “lies outside the scope of the Convention”.5 In light of the limited scope of the ICSFT\n\nas set out by the Court, Ukraine was forced to recast its legal arguments and now\n\nconcentrates on allegations of non-cooperation by the Russian Federation in combating\n\nof alleged terrorist-funding activities.\n\n7. Before addressing Ukraine’s Reply, some preliminary observations regarding the context\n\nof the present case are warranted.\n\nA. THE COUP D’ÉTAT IN KIEV\n\n8. In its Reply, Ukraine continues to mispresent the events of 2014 that led to serious\n\ndevelopments in the years that followed. It does this in order to place responsibility on\n\nthe Russian Federation for its own illegal and unreasonable decisions and actions. At the\n\nsame time, Ukraine seeks artificially to tie the ICSFT with these events, which the\n\nConvention has in reality nothing to do with.\n\n9. As the Russian Federation explained in the Counter-Memorial, the armed conflict in\n\nDonbass arose out of an unconstitutional upheaval in Kiev, where radical armed groups\n\ndeeply rooted in Nazi ideology with the aid and political support of the US and several\n\nEU States overthrew the legitimate government and imposed a new nationalist, openly\n\nanti-Russian regime.\n\n10. What Ukraine now calls a peaceful “Revolution of Dignity” was known in 2014 as the\n\n“Maidan”. It was a series of protests that took place in Kiev at the end of 2013 and\n\ngathered broad support from a number of Western countries. One of the pretexts for this\n\nlong face-off between the Ukrainian Government and its opposition was the decision by\n\nthe former President Yanukovich to suspend preparations to sign an association\n\nagreement with the European Union. The real problem was, however, created by the\n\n5 Judgment of 8 November 2019, p. 585, ¶59.\n\nPage 16 out of 541\n\nopposition in Ukraine, which sought to confront the Ukrainian people with a stark but\n\nfictitious choice: Ukraine moves ahead either with Europe or with the Russian Federation.\n\nAs the Russian Federation previously explained to the Court, this false choice largely split\n\nthe country.6\n\n11. The initial wave of violence started in early 2014 in the West of Ukraine and was\n\ninstigated by radical extremist movements with Neo-Nazi backgrounds. Many of these\n\ngroups were actively nurtured with open funding from Western countries, primarily the\n\nUnited States. Thus, according to Victoria Nuland, US’ Assistant Secretary of State, the\n\nUnited States spent $5 billion in Ukraine on “promotion of democracy” and “related\n\nprojects” between 1991 and 2013. 7 Substantial sums were funnelled through the\n\nUSAID,8 Freedom House and the NED, all of which are funded by the US Government.9\n\n12. Thus, in January 2014, radicals blocked regional State administrations in the West of\n\nUkraine, regional Departments of the Ministry of Interior and the Security Service of\n\nUkraine (the “SBU”), police stations and other public buildings. On 23 January 2014,\n\nthey stormed into the Lvov State Regional Administration and forced its head to write a\n\nletter of resignation.10 By 24 January 2014, the State Administrations had been taken in\n\nat least 6 more regional centres.11 On 19 February 2014, further administrative buildings\n\nwere forcefully seized, including military postings.12 In particular, the activists in Lvov\n\n6 See Application of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and of the\n\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Ukraine v.

As a result of negotiations between the radicals and the leadership of the\n\nmilitary unit, an agreement was reached that the security forces would leave the military\n\nunit unarmed.13 The Defence Ministry’s military arsenal was looted.14 Armed groups of\n\nextremists, many of whom had criminal records and/or combat experience continued\n\narriving in Kiev.\n\n13. The Maidan leaders (A. Yatsenyuk, A. Turchinov, V. Klichko, O. Tyagnibok, D. Yarosh\n\netc.) organised the siege of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and an attempted storm\n\nof the Office of the President of Ukraine. The leading forces of these actions were the\n\nRight Sector (whose leader was D. Yarosh) and the “All-Ukraine Union” (VO) Svoboda\n\n(whose leader was O. Tyagnibok), which find their origins in Ukraine’s Nazi\n\ncollaborators, notorious as accomplices in the heinous crimes of the Second World War.\n\n14. The Right Sector and the VO Svoboda formed the core of the so-called “Samooborona\n\nMaidanu” (“Maidan Self-Defence”). Organised violence against the police became\n\nwidespread: thousands of radicals used Molotov cocktails and policemen were burned\n\nand injured. The tragic culmination came on 18-22 February 2014, when more than 100\n\npeople were killed, including at least 13 police officers due to sniper fire. These tragic\n\nevents were demonstrated in Ukraine on Fire, a documentary film released in 2016 by\n\nthe US Academy Award winning film director and Vietnam War veteran Oliver Stone.15\n\n13 TSN, In Lvov protesters seize main law enforcement buildings and weapons arsenal (19 February 2014),\n\navailable at: https://tsn.ua/ukrayina/u-lvovi-protestuvalniki-zahopili-golovni-budivli-silovikiv-ta-arsenal-zbroyi-\n\n335205.html (Annex 398).\n\n14 Unian.ua, Military warehouses with weapons burn in Lvov (19 February 2014), available at:\n\nhttps://www.unian.ua/politics/886677-u-lvovi-goryat-viyskovi-skladi-zi-zbroeyu.html (Annex 188).\n\n15 I.

The Ukrainian authorities never properly investigated or prosecuted the Maidan\n\nshootings.16 Moreover, the protesters involved in violent acts were later amnestied.17\n\n16. The Court had an opportunity to review the technologies of the power change with an\n\noutside interference.18 In particular the Court studied a copy of a CIA “Psychological\n\nOperations” manual explaining, inter alia, how to foment civil unrest to bring down a\n\ntarget government. In the section on “Control of mass concentrations and meetings”, the\n\nfollowing guidance is given (inter alia):\n\n“If possible, professional criminals will be hired to carry out specific selective\n\n'jobs'. Specific tasks will be assigned to others, in order to create a 'martyr' for\n\nthe cause, taking the demonstrators to a confrontation with the authorities, in\n\norder to bring about uprisings or shootings, which will cause the death of one\n\nor more persons, who would become the martyrs, a situation that should be\n\nmade use of immediately against the régime, in order to create greater\n\nconflicts”.19\n\n16 The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine concluded in its Briefing note dated 19 February 2019\n\nthat “Five years after the end of the Maidan protests accountability for the killings and violent deaths of 84\n\nprotestors, a man who did not participate in the protests, and 13 law enforcement officers is yet to be achieved.\n\nThe investigation into the killing of 17 protestors and 13 law enforcement officers has still to identify individual\n\nperpetrators. Only one person has been found guilty of unintentional killing of a protestor. Two others were found\n\nguilty of hooliganism in relation to an incident that resulted in the killing of another protestor… HRMMU notes\n\nthat investigations into the killing of the law enforcement officers during Maidan protests have been particularly\n\nineffective… The trials in the Maidan-related proceedings are protracted… Government of Ukraine is doing too\n\nlittle to ensure the prompt, independent and impartial investigation and prosecution of the killings perpetrated\n\nduring Maidan protests”. See UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Briefing note Accountability for\n\nKillings and Violent Deaths during the Maidan Protests, 20 February 2019, ¶¶4, 13-14, 16, available at:\n\nhttps://ukraine.un.org/en/108759-briefing-note-accountability-killings-and-violent-deaths-during-maidanprotests.\n\nThe International Advisory Panel established by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe to oversee\n\ninvestigations of the crimes committed during Maidan also concluded that new Ukrainian government failed to\n\npromptly conduct the Maidan investigations: “The Panel considers that substantial progress has not been made in\n\nthe investigations into the violent incidents during the Maidan demonstrations… As has been widely\n\nacknowledged, there has been a clear lack of public confidence in Ukraine in any such investigation. On the\n\ncontrary, there has been a widespread perception of impunity on the part of the law enforcement agencies and of\n\nan unwillingness or inability on the part of the investigatory authorities to bring to justice those responsible for the\n\ndeaths and injuries”. See Report of the International Advisory Panel on its review of the Maidan Investigations,\n\n31 March 2015, ¶535, 536, available at: https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices\n\n/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016802f038b.\n\n17 Law of Ukraine No. 743-VII “On Preventing the Prosecution and Punishment of Persons in Connection with\n\nthe Events that Occurred during Peaceful Assemblies and on Invalidating Certain Laws of Ukraine”, 21 February\n\n2014, available at: https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/go/743-18 (Annex 468).\n\n18 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

On 21 February 2014, former President Yanukovich and the opposition leaders signed an\n\nagreement to settle the crisis. This agreement provided, inter alia, for the vacation of\n\nillegally seized governmental buildings, a political transition and new elections.\n\nRepresentatives of Poland, Germany and France co-signed the agreement as guarantors\n\nof its implementation. However, the protesters escalated the hostilities further. On the\n\nnight of 22 February 2014, they stormed the government premises, and former President\n\nYanukovich was forced to abandon Kiev in fear for his life.20\n\n18. The Right Sector’s extremists also intimidated members of parliament to install a new\n\ngovernment. This intimidation of members of parliament was referred to by the Estonian\n\nForeign Minister, Mr Paet, in a telephone conversation with Baroness Ashton:\n\n“Paet: So that, well, basically, it is that the trust level is absolutely low. On\n\nthe other hand, all the security problems, this integrity problems, Crimea, all\n\nthis stuff. Regions Party was absolutely upset. They say that, well, they\n\naccept, they accept this that now there will be new government. And there\n\nwill be external elections. But there is enormous pressure against members of\n\nparliament – that there are uninvited visitors during the night … to party\n\nmembers.\n\nWell, journalists … some journalists who were with me, they saw during the\n\nday that one member of parliament was just beaten in front of the parliament\n\nbuilding by these guys with the guns on the streets”.21\n\n19. As a result, on 22 February 2014, one of the Maidan leaders Alexander Turchinov was\n\n“elected” as speaker of the Verkhovnaya Rada. The following day he was designated as\n\nacting President of Ukraine, who later unleashed the use of military force against\n\nDonbass. On 25 February 2014, he assumed command of the UAF. Another leader of\n\nthe Maidan Arseniy Yatsenyuk was appointed as Prime Minister on 27 February 2014.\n\n20. As the further events showed, the United States decided who will be in the new Ukraine’s\n\ngovernment. It appears from a leaked telephone conversation between Victoria Nuland,\n\nUS’ Assistant Secretary of State, and Geoffrey Pyatt, the United States’ ambassador in\n\nKiev, on about 7 February 2014. In the call, Ms Nuland and Mr Pyatt discussed the\n\n20 YouTube, Gian Micalessin, Finally the Truth about the Beginning of the Civil War in Ukraine?

She also planned to arrange\n\nYatsenyuk’s visit to the UN headquarters in order to give the future Maidan government\n\na sense of legitimacy:22\n\n“... that would be great, I think, to help glue this thing and to have the UN\n\nhelp glue it…”.\n\n21. On the day of Arseniy Yatseniuk’s appointment, Vice President Biden informed him that\n\nhis interim government had the full support of the United States. US Secretary of State\n\nJohn Kerry then visited Kiev on 4 March 2014 and met with Arseniy Yatsenyuk and his\n\nfar-right supporters, including Oleg Tyagnibok of VO Svoboda. On 13 March 2014,\n\nArseniy Yatsenyuk visited the United Nations and met the UN Secretary General in New\n\nYork. The new order was, as Ms Nuland had put it, “glued”. The coup was complete.\n\n22. As noted above, the new government never properly investigated the shootings in Kiev.\n\nDetails of their failure to investigate appear from a report, dated 31 March 2015, of the\n\nInternational Advisory Panel established by the Secretary General of the Council of\n\nEurope.23 The report concluded, inter alia, that “the investigations into the Maidan cases\n\nlacked practical independence in circumstances where the investigating body belonged to\n\nthe same authority as those under investigation”, and that they overall lacked\n\n22 In early February 2014, a telephone conversation between the US’ Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland\n\nand the US’ Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt appeared on YouTube.

Especially the announcement of him as deputy\n\nprime minister and you've seen some of my notes on the troubles in the marriage right now so we’re trying to get\n\na read really fast on where he is on this stuff. But I think your argument to him, which you’ll need to make, I think\n\nthat’s the next phone call you want to set up, is exactly the one you made to Yats. And I’m glad you sort of put\n\nhim on the spot on where he fits in this scenario. And I’m very glad that he said what he said in response.” Ms\n\nNuland responded, “I don't think Klitsch should go into the government. I don’t think it’s necessary, I don’t think\n\nit’s a good idea.” Mr Pyatt reacted: “Yeah. I guess... in terms of him not going into the government, just let him\n\nstay out and do his political homework and stuff…”.

Moreover, the new government and its successors also suppressed independent\n\ninvestigation by obstructing and intimidating journalists. There have been abductions\n\nand detentions of journalists (who were sometimes reportedly tortured) by UAF or the\n\nSBU, with numerous examples of SBU involvement.26 Criminal cases have been opened\n\nagainst journalists whose views were considered to be “pro-Russian”.27 Restrictions on\n\nthe work of journalists were also put in place, including sanctions,28 travel bans29 and\n\ncancellation of media accreditation (licenses).30\n\n24. Thus, instead of trying to establish a coalition government to de-escalate tensions, the\n\nMaidan leaders fostered division within the country and installed a government which\n\n24 Ibid., ¶524.

Ukrainian State officials started verbally referring to the DPR and LPR as “terrorist\n\nentities”, it should be noted that no official decision on such recognition was issued either\n\nin Ukraine or at the international level.\n\nC. THE MINSK AGREEMENTS AND THE HYPOCRISY OF UKRAINE’S CASE\n\n29. In October 2014 and April 2015, Ukraine signed two sets of agreements with the DPR\n\nand LPR (the “Minsk Agreements”). They provided for a comprehensive process of\n\nreintegration of the DPR and LPR into Ukraine. As part of this reintegration process,\n\nUkraine undertook to pardon all “persons connected to the events that took place in\n\ncertain areas of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions of Ukraine” 35 and “prohibit their\n\nprosecution and punishment”.36\n\n30. The Minsk Agreements were endorsed by the Organization for Security and Co-operation\n\nin Europe (“OSCE”) and the countries of the so-called “Normandy format”, which\n\nincluded Germany, France, Ukraine and the Russian Federation. Furthermore, The\n\nRussian Federation also initiated the adoption of the Resolution of the UN Security\n\nCouncil resolution 2202 (2015), which endorsed the Minsk Agreements. 37 The\n\nsettlement process under the Agreements was expected to be finalised by the end of\n\n2015.38\n\n31. However, Ukrainian authorities soon admitted that they had no intention to fulfil the\n\nMinsk Agreements.39 In particular, former President Poroshenko declared that the Minsk\n\n35 Package of Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk Agreements (“Minsk-2”), 12 February 2015, ¶5,\n\navailable at: https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/UA_150212_MinskAgreement_en.pdf.\n\n36 Protocol on the outcome of consultations of the Trilateral Contact Group on joint steps aimed at the\n\nimplementation of the Peace Plan of the President of Ukraine, P.

As will be further explained in Chapter II below42, the Minsk Agreements by themselves\n\ndisprove Ukraine’s allegation that the DPR and LPR ought to be considered “notorious”\n\nterrorist organisations, as opposed to self-proclaimed governments. The conclusion of\n\nthe Minsk Agreements and their endorsement by the UN Security Council confirm that\n\nthe DPR and LPR were universally perceived as actual self-governing entities\n\nrepresenting their people, rather than “terrorists”. In fact, the Minsk Agreements, by\n\nproviding for pardoning what were essentially combatants, as well as Ukraine as a party\n\nthereto, clearly treated the DPR and LPR as entities participating in an armed conflict and\n\nnot as terrorist organisations. Such a treatment debunks any alleged “notoriety” of the\n\nDPR and LPR as “terrorist organizations”.\n\nD. THERE IS UNSURPRISINGLY STILL NO EVIDENCE OF FUNDING OF TERRORISM\n\n33. In its Order of 19 April 2017, the Court rejected Ukraine’s request for the indication of\n\nprovisional measures with respect to Ukraine’s claims under the ICSFT noting that:\n\n“… the acts to which Ukraine refers … have given rise to the death and injury\n\nof a large number of civilians. However, in order to determine whether the\n\nrights for which Ukraine seeks protection are at least plausible, it is necessary\n\nto ascertain whether there are sufficient reasons for considering that the other\n\n/ukraina/politika/2917869-poltorak-o-razvedenii-dogovorennosti-s-agressorom-nichego-ne-stoyat html (Annex\n\n168). On 10 July 2020, Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Reznikov said that the Minsk agreements are not\n\n“carved in stone” and contain “a lot of things that no longer work”. See Ukrinform, Reznikov: Only Normandy\n\nFour Leaders Can Change Minsk Agreements (11 July 2020), available at: https://www.ukrinform net/rubricpolytics/\n\n3061245-reznikov-only-normandy-four-leaders-can-change-minsk-agreements html (Annex 169).\n\n40 Ukrinform, Poroshenko Says Minsk Agreements Partially Fulfilled Their Goal (13 December 2019), available\n\nat: https://www.ukrinform net/rubric-polytics/2837640-poroshenko-says-minsk-agreements-partially-fulfilledtheir-\n\ngoal html (Annex 170); Russia Today, Minsk Deal Was Used to Buy Time – Ukraine's Poroshenko\n\n(17 June 2022), available at: https://www.rt.com/russia/557307-poroshenko-comments-minsk-agreement/ (Annex\n\n171).\n\n41 TASS, Attempt to “give Ukraine time”: Merkel on Minsk agreements (7 December 2022), available at:\n\nhttps://tass.com/world/1547141 (Annex 341).\n\n42 See Chapter II below.\n\nPage 25 out of 541\n\nelements set out in Article 2, paragraph 1, such as the elements of intention\n\nor knowledge noted above … and the element of purpose specified in Article\n\n2, paragraph 1 (b), are present. At this stage of the proceedings, Ukraine has\n\nnot put before the Court evidence which affords a sufficient basis to find it\n\nplausible that these elements are present”.43\n\n34. Although more than five years have passed since the Court made this finding, the latter\n\ncontinues to be true at the present stage of the proceedings.\n\n35. There is simply, and unsurprisingly, no evidence of any terrorism financing. In light of\n\nthis, Ukraine asks the Court to apply an extremely low standard of proof which has no\n\nbasis in international law. Ukraine characterises the Russian Federation’s position in this\n\nregard as “legalistic”.44 This is tantamount to admitting that the Russian Federation’s\n\nposition is correct under the existing law and that, to accommodate Ukraine’s claims,\n\nsuch law should somehow be disregarded. This is obviously untenable.\n\n36. Ukraine acknowledges that a stricter standard of proof was applied in Bosnia Genocide,\n\nbut attempts to distinguish it from the present case by claiming that in Bosnia Genocide\n\n“the Court was asked to conclude that a State bore responsibility for committing the crime\n\nof genocide”, and argues that, “[t]he evidentiary standard in this case should not be similar\n\nto that of a prosecutor’s burden to establish criminal responsibility for committing\n\ngenocide”.45 But the Court in that case specifically held that it was not dealing with the\n\ncriminal responsibility of States under international law:\n\n“The Court observes that the obligations in question in this case, arising from\n\nthe terms of the Convention, and the responsibilities of States that would arise\n\nfrom breach of such obligations, are obligations and responsibilities under\n\ninternational law. They are not of a criminal nature”.46\n\n37. Ukraine also argues that the heightened standard is ill-suited to this case because third\n\nparties’ mental state is involved, which is “inherently more difficult to prove”. 47\n\nHowever, third parties’ mental state was also involved in Bosnia Genocide, where the\n\nCourt still applied the same standard of proof.\n\n43 Order of 19 April 2017, p.131, ¶75.\n\n44 Reply, ¶56.\n\n45 Ibid., ¶57.\n\n46 Case concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide\n\n(Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007, p. 115, ¶170.\n\n47 Reply, ¶58.\n\nPage 26 out of 541\n\n38. Ukraine also argues that, outside the genocide context, the Court has applied a lower\n\nstandard such as a “sufficient evidence”, or “convincing evidence” in Armed Activities on\n\nthe Territory of the Congo, or a “sufficiency” standard in Oil Platforms, and asks the\n\nCourt to apply that standard in this case.48 But those cases cannot be compared to cases\n\nof allegations of genocide, or terrorism or terrorism financing, and the standard of proof\n\napplied in those cases, even if described accurately by Ukraine, would not do justice to\n\nthe matters in this case where grave allegations of terrorism and terrorism financing have\n\nbeen made.\n\n39. The standard of proof must be appropriate or correspond to the gravity of the charges\n\nagainst a respondent. As the Court indicated in Bosnia Genocide:\n\n“The Court has long recognized that claims against a State involving charges\n\nof exceptional gravity must be proved by evidence that is fully conclusive …\n\nThe Court requires that it be fully convinced that allegations made in the\n\nproceedings, that the crime of genocide or the other acts enumerated in Article\n\nIII have been committed, have been clearly established. The same standard\n\napplies to the proof of attribution for such acts.\n\nIn respect of the Applicant’s claim that the Respondent has breached its\n\nundertakings to prevent genocide and to punish and extradite persons charged\n\nwith genocide, the Court requires proof at a high level of certainty appropriate\n\nto the seriousness of the allegation”.49\n\n40. In this case, the gravity of Ukraine’s allegations requires the same “standard of proof” as\n\nreferred to above. If inferences are resorted to, any inference must be “the only reasonable\n\ninference that can be drawn”.50\n\n41. The grave nature of terrorism financing is beyond any doubt. Several times it is so\n\ndescribed in the ICSFT. In the preamble, it is stated that “the financing of terrorism is a\n\nmatter of grave concern to the international community as a whole”. Under Article 4(b),\n\neach State party undertakes to “make those offences punishable by appropriate penalties\n\nwhich take into account the grave nature of the offences”. Under Article 10, in a case\n\nwhere Article 7 applies, if a suspect is not extradited, a State party undertakes to submit\n\nthe case for prosecution and the competent authorities “shall take their decision in the\n\n48 Ibid., ¶59.\n\n49 Case concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide\n\n(Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007, pp. 129-130, ¶¶209, 210.\n\n50 Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia),\n\nJudgment, I.C.J. Reports 2015, p.128, ¶440. See also Ibid., p. 67, ¶, 148.\n\nPage 27 out of 541\n\nsame manner as in the case of any other offence of a grave nature under the law of that\n\nState”. Therefore, there is no doubt that the standard of proof set out by the Court in\n\nBosnia Genocide is applicable to the present case.\n\nE. STRUCTURE OF THIS PART\n\n42. This Part of the Rejoinder is structured as follows:\n\n(a) Chapter II shows that doctrine of clean hands precludes Ukraine’s claims under\n\nthe ICSFT.\n\n(b) Chapter III reaffirms the Russian Federation’s position regarding the requirements\n\nfor the establishment of the offence of terrorism financing under the ICSFT and\n\nother related treaties.\n\n(c) Chapters IV replies to Ukraine’s arguments regarding the definition of “funds”\n\nunder the ICSFT.\n\n(d) Chapter V demonstrates that Ukraine has failed to establish the offence of\n\nterrorism financing with respect to Flight MH17.\n\n(e) Chapter VI responds to Ukraine’s allegations regarding the shelling at\n\nVolnovakha, Mariupol, Kramatorsk and Avdeyevka.\n\n(f) Chapter VII deals with the alleged killings and bombings.\n\n(g) Finally, in Chapter VIII, the Russian Federation explains that Ukraine has failed\n\nto establish that the Russian Federation breached its obligations under Articles 8-\n\n10, 12 and 18 of the ICSFT.\n\nPage 28 out of 541\n\nII. UKRAINE’S CLAIMS UNDER THE ICSFT ARE PRECLUDED BY VIRTUE OF\n\nTHE CLEAN HANDS DOCTRINE\n\n43. The doctrine of clean hands provides the Court with the power to deny a party’s request\n\nfor relief where the same party has itself engaged in serious misconduct or wrongdoing\n\nthat has a close connection to the relief sought. Equity and good faith constitute the\n\nfoundation of the doctrine of clean hands. “He who comes into equity must come with\n\nclean hands”, stated an arbitral tribunal.51 In the same vein, Judge Fitzmaurice noted:\n\n“He who comes to equity for relief must come with clean hands. Thus a State\n\nwhich is guilty of illegal conduct may be deprived of the necessary locus\n\nstandi in judicio for complaining of corresponding illegalities on the part of\n\nother States (…)”.52\n\n44. A trace of the application of this principle in the case law of the Court can be found in the\n\ncase of Diversion of Water from the Meuse, where the Permanent Court concluded that:\n\n“The Court cannot refrain from comparing the case of the Belgian lock with\n\nthat of the Netherlands lock at Bosscheveld. Neither of these locks constitutes\n\na feeder, yet both of them discharge their lock-water into the canal, and thus\n\ntake part in feeding it with water otherwise than through the treaty feeder,\n\nthough without producing an excessive current in the Zuid-Willemsvaart. In\n\nthese circumstances, the Court finds it difficult to admit that the Netherlands\n\nare now warranted in complaining of the construction and operation of a lock\n\nof which they themselves set an example in the past. Accordingly, as has been\n\nexplained above, in the absence of evidence as to the effects which the use of\n\nthe Neerhaeren Lock produces on the current in the Zuid-Willemsvaart, or on\n\nthe Meuse itself, the Court does not consider that the normal use of this lock\n\nis inconsistent with the Treaty. The Court is also of opinion that there is no\n\nground for treating this lock less favourably than the Netherlands lock at\n\nBosscheveld. It is thus unable to accord to the Netherlands Government the\n\nbenefit of its submission”.53\n\n45. Judge Hudson appended to the Court's decision a separate opinion in which he stated that:\n\n“It would seem to be an important principle of equity that where two parties\n\nhave assumed an identical or a reciprocal obligation, one party which is\n\nengaged in a continuing non-performance of that obligation should not be\n\npermitted to take advantage of a similar non-performance of that obligation\n\nby the other party. The principle finds expression in the so-called maxims of\n\n51 Friedrich & Co. Case), French-Venezuelan Mixed Claims Commission, Opinion of the Umpire of 31 July 1905,\n\n10 R.I.A.A., pp. 50, 54.\n\n52 G. Fitzmaurice, THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW CONSIDERED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF\n\nTHE RULE OF LAW, RECUEIL DES COURS DE L’ACADÉMIE DE DROIT INTERNATIONAL DE LA HAYE (1957-II, t. 92,\n\nLeyden, Sijthoff, 1958), p. 119.\n\n53 Diversion of Water from the Meuse (Netherlands v. Belgium), Judgment of 28 June 1937, p. 25.\n\nPage 29 out of 541\n\nequity which exercised great influence in the creative period of the\n\ndevelopment of the Anglo-American law. Some of these maxims are,\n\n\"Equality is equity\"; \"He who seeks equity must do equity\". It is in line with\n\nsuch maxims that \"a court of equity refuses relief to a plaintiff whose conduct\n\nin regard to the subject-matter of the litigation has been improper”.54\n\n46. Judge Schwebel, relying on the opinion of Judge Hudson, noted in his dissenting opinion\n\nin the case of Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, that the\n\ndoctrine of clean hands applied to the case of Nicaragua:\n\n“Nicaragua has not come to Court with clean hands. On the contrary, as the\n\naggressor, indirectly responsible - but ultimately responsible - for large\n\nnumbers of deaths and widespread destruction in El Salvador apparently\n\nmuch exceeding that which Nicaragua has sustained, Nicaragua's hands are\n\nodiously unclean. Nicaragua has compounded its sins by misrepresenting\n\nthem to the Court. Thus both on the grounds of its unlawful armed\n\nintervention in El Salvador, and its deliberately seeking to mislead the Court\n\nabout the facts of that intervention through false testimony of its Ministers,\n\nNicaragua's claims against the United States should fail”.55\n\n47. States appearing before the Court have repeatedly relied on the clean hands doctrine in a\n\nrange of different contexts. While the Court has not upheld a defence on this basis, it also\n\nhas never rejected the doctrine as a matter of principle. In Certain Iranian Assets, the\n\nCourt noted that “the United States has not argued that Iran, through its alleged conduct,\n\nhas violated the Treaty of Amity, upon which its Application is based”, and then declared\n\nthat:\n\n“[w]ithout having to take a position on the ‘clean hands’ doctrine, the Court\n\nconsiders that, even if it were shown that the Applicant’s conduct was not\n\nbeyond reproach, this would not be sufficient per se to uphold the objection\n\nto admissibility raised by the Respondent on the basis of the ‘clean hands’\n\ndoctrine”.56\n\n48. The Court then added:\n\n“Such a conclusion is however without prejudice to the question whether the\n\nallegations made by the United States, concerning notably Iran’s alleged\n\nsponsoring and support of international terrorism and its presumed actions in\n\n54 Ibid., Individual Opinion of Judge Hudson, p. 77.\n\n55 Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits,\n\nJudgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, Dissenting opinion of Judge Schwebel, p. 392, ¶268.\n\n56 Certain Iranian Assets (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

Reports 2004, p, 38, ¶47; Maritime Delimitation in the Indian Ocean (Somalia v.\n\nKenya), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2017, p. 52, ¶142.\n\nPage 30 out of 541\n\nrespect of nuclear non-proliferation and arms trafficking, could, eventually,\n\nprovide a defence on the merits”.57\n\n49. In the Jadhav case, Judge Iwasawa supported the Court’s finding that rejected Pakistan's\n\nobjection based on the clean hands doctrine, and explained that “[Pakistan's] allegations\n\ndo not relate to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (the “VCCR”) upon which\n\nIndia’s Application is based”.58\n\n50. The same clean hands approach is applicable regarding the unfounded Ukraine’s\n\nallegations of “violations” by the Russian Federation of the ICSFT, that, in fact, have\n\nnever taken place.\n\n51. As has been shown above, what Ukraine conveniently omits is that it concluded the Minsk\n\nAgreements with the DPR and LPR. Furthermore, Ukraine also omits to say that\n\ncompanies under its jurisdiction have conducted trade in Donbass. This shows that\n\nUkraine itself has never genuinely recognised the DPR and LPR as terrorist organisations,\n\nnevertheless it seeks to deliberately mislead the Court about the nature of the DPR and\n\nLPR and to build its allegations of terrorism financing around this misrepresentation.\n\n52. Moreover, Ukraine seeks to represent certain episodes of the armed conflict in Donbass\n\nas terrorist acts, such as certain allegations of indiscriminate shelling of residential areas.\n\nHowever, Ukraine itself was using aviation and heavy weapons against civilians and\n\nresidential areas and does not consider that such situations constitute acts of terrorism.\n\nA. UKRAINE NEVER SOUGHT A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IN DONBASS, HAVING INSTEAD\n\nUSED MILITARY AVIATION AND HEAVY WEAPONS AGAINST CIVILIANS\n\ni. Complete Disregard for the Minsk Agreements by Ukraine\n\n53. One of the most significant attempts to end the conflict in Donbass, for which there were\n\nhigh hopes, was the Minsk Agreements that the representatives of Kiev and the DPR and\n\nLPR signed, as explained above.\n\n57 Certain Iranian Assets (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objections,\n\nJudgment, I.C.J. Reports 2019, p.44, ¶123.\n\n58 Jadhav Case (India v. Pakistan), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2019, , Declaration of Judge Iwasawa, p.521,¶3.\n\nPage 31 out of 541\n\n54. In its preliminary objections in another case before the Court, the Russian Federation has\n\nalready elaborated on Kiev’s absolute unwillingness to comply with the Minsk\n\nAgreements. 59 According to the Minsk Agreements, Kiev should have sought a\n\nconsensus with the DPR and LPR on the modalities for local elections and on the specifics\n\nof the status of certain areas of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions.60 Kiev, however, never\n\nstarted that dialogue. The Head of the DPR, Alexander Zakharchenko, who was one of\n\nthe signatories to the Minsk Agreements, was assassinated through a targeted killing on\n\n31 August 2018.61 On 7 February 2022, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister stated that there will\n\nbe “no negotiations with the militants”.62 During all this time, the Russian Federation, as\n\na mediator, constantly called for a peaceful dialogue between Ukraine and the DPR and\n\nLPR.63\n\n55. Importantly, Kiev’s use of force against Donbass and lack of willingness to engage in\n\ndialogue went against the will of Ukrainian people. In July 2018, the Ukrainian\n\nnewspaper “Government Courier” (Uryadovy kuryer) published the results of a nationwide\n\nsurvey on the future of Donbass. Only 17% of Ukrainian people spoke in favour of\n\nusing military force for gaining control over the south-eastern region. In contrast, 70%\n\nrespondents considered it possible to reach a political compromise with the DPR and\n\nLPR.64\n\n59\n\n60 Minsk-2, ¶4.\n\n61 The Guardian, Rebel Leader Alexander Zakharchenko Killed in Explosion in Ukraine (31 August 2018),\n\navailable at: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/rebel-leader-alexander-zakharchenko-killed-inexplosion-\n\nin-ukraine (Annex 191); Deutsche Welle, Alexander Zakharchenko: The Latest Ukrainian Rebel Leader\n\nto Face an Abrupt Death (2 September 2018), available at: https://www.dw.com/en/alexander-zakharchenko-thelatest-\n\nukrainian-rebel-leader-to-face-an-abrupt-death/a-45323653 (Annex 192).\n\n62 European Pravda, No Pressure over Concessions: Kuleba on Negotiations with Germany’s Foreign Minister (7\n\nFebruary 2022), available at: https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/rus/news/2022/02/7/7133666/ (Annex 193).\n\n63 For example, on 18 February 2022, President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin emphasized during his\n\njoint press-conference with President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko that “Kiev is not complying with the\n\nMinsk Agreements and, in particular, is strongly opposed to a direct dialogue with Donetsk and Lugansk. Kiev is\n\nessentially sabotaging the agreements on amending the Constitution, on the special status of Donbass... All Kiev\n\nneeds to do is sit down at the negotiating table with representatives of Donbass and agree on political, military,\n\neconomic and humanitarian measures to end the conflict.” See The Kremlin, News conference following Russian-\n\nBelarusian talks (18 February 2022), available at: http://en kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67809 (Annex 404).\n\n64 Uryadovy Kuryer, On the Future of Donbass in Terms of Numbers (21 July 2018), available at:\n\nhttps://ukurier.gov.ua/uk/articles/pro-majbutnye-donbasu-movoyu-cifr/ (Annex 194).\n\nPage 32 out of 541\n\n56. Paragraph 4 of the Minsk Agreements prescribed that Kiev must promptly, and no later\n\nthan 30 days after their signature, adopt a resolution through its Parliament specifying the\n\nareas in Donbass enjoying a special regime and adopt a law on special status of these\n\nareas.65 On 16 September 2014, the Ukrainian Parliament formally passed a law “On the\n\nSpecial Procedure for Local Self-Government in Certain Areas of Donetsk and Lugansk\n\nRegions”. Its validity was, however, limited to one year with a possible prolongation,\n\nand its effect was circumscribed by Article 10, which contained a number of conditions\n\nthat were not consistent with the Minsk Agreements.66\n\n57. Article 10 provided, among other things, that the special regime of self-government\n\nwould be available only for the local authorities elected at extraordinary local elections.\n\nThis was inconsistent with the first part of paragraph 4 of the Minsk Agreements, which\n\nprescribed that the modalities of local elections in Donbass should be negotiated in\n\ndialogue between Kiev, Donetsk and Lugansk. However, representatives of Kiev\n\nsystematically refrained from such dialogue in the Minsk Contact Group formed under\n\nthe Agreements. Moreover, in 2020 Kiev decided to exclude Donbass from the political\n\nframework of Ukraine by prohibiting local elections in the DPR and LPR, as well as in\n\n18 districts controlled by Kiev.67 Thus, this law never became operational as envisaged\n\nby the Agreements.\n\n58. Moreover, on 18 January 2018, a law “On the Peculiarities of the State Policy on Ensuring\n\nUkraine’s State Sovereignty over Temporarily Occupied Territories in Donetsk and\n\nLugansk Regions”, also known as “the law on Reintegration of Donbass”, was adopted,\n\nwhich formally confirmed that the ATO was a military operation, and in effect excluded\n\nany possibility of political settlement within the framework of the Minsk Agreements.68\n\n65 Minsk-2, ¶4.\n\n66 Law of Ukraine No. 1680-VII “On the Special Procedure for Local Self-Government in Certain Areas of\n\nDonetsk and Lugansk Regions”, 16 September 2014, Article 10, available at: https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/\n\nlaws/show/1680-18#n5 (Annex 469).\n\n67 Interfax-Ukraine, Rada Appoints Next Elections to Local Self-Govt Bodies for Oct 25 (15 July 2020), available\n\nat: https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/674837 html (Annex 195); Freedomhouse.org, Nations in Transit:\n\nUkraine (2021), available at: https://freedomhouse.org/country/ukraine/nations-transit/2021.

The most blatant part of the non-implementation of the Minsk Agreements was the\n\nconstant violation of its first paragraph – the immediate and comprehensive ceasefire. As\n\nof 21 July 2020, the SMM recorded more than 1.5 million ceasefire violations.71\n\n60. Thus, despite repeated statements by high-ranking Ukrainian officials that the Minsk\n\nAgreements have no alternative, Kiev in fact used the document as a respite to strengthen\n\nits military capabilities and prepare for the final suppression of the Donbass people by\n\nmilitary means.\n\ni. Using heavy weapons in residential areas\n\n61. The UAF have constantly shelled residential areas of Donbass, leaving dozens of dead\n\nand wounded each time.

Several fire brigade vehicles\n\nwere working to bring the fire under control. Nearby, the SMM saw several five-floor apartment blocks with\n\nshattered window panes. The damage appeared to be consistent with shelling. In the same area the SMM observed\n\na burning vehicle. Inside the car, the SMM saw the remains of three persons. In Kievskii district, around five\n\nkilometres north of the city centre, the SMM observed significant damage concentrated on residential buildings\n\nand shops located along the Kievski Boulevard”.\n\n78 Spot report by the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM), 22 January 2015, \"Shelling Incident\n\non Kuprina Street in Donetsk City, available at: https://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/135786 : “The SMM observed\n\na trolleybus which had been hit by shrapnel and a burnt-out car 20m away, also hit by shrapnel. All windows in\n\nthe trolleybus were shattered and tyres punctured. The SMM observed seven dead bodies, three females, three\n\nmales and one of indeterminate gender. Three of the bodies were in the bus, three in close proximity to the bus –\n\nthe furthest approximately 25m away – and one in the burnt-out car. At 16:00 hrs the SMM contacted a\n\nrepresentative of Donetsk City Morgue, who said that eight bodies – related to the incident on Kuprina Street –\n\nhad been received by the morgue.”\n\nPage 35 out of 541\n\n(f) On 1 October 2014, the UAF shelled Donetsk with 11 killed and more than 40\n\nwounded. The targets were a public transport stop and school No. 57.79\n\n(g) On 14 November 2014, 20 civilians including 2 children were killed as a result of\n\nartillery shelling of residential areas of Donetsk and Gorlovka by the UAF.80\n\n62. Ukraine had not abandoned this tactic in later years but continued it to this day as has\n\nbeen shown in the Preliminary Objections in another case before this Court.81\n\nii. Using civilians as human shields\n\n63. Since 2014, the UAF have never been shy of setting up their positions in close vicinity,\n\nliterally in the backyards, of such socially important facilities as schools, kindergartens,\n\nhospitals, libraries, cultural centres, even when those objects remained operational with\n\nplenty of students or patients inside, so that in case of return fire they would be able to\n\naccuse the Russian Federation of “attacking civilians” and “destruction of civilian\n\ninfrastructure”. In its Preliminary Objections in the other case before the Court, the\n\nRussian Federation drew attention to this fact.82\n\n64. The UAF troops and heavy equipment, deployed in residential areas close to the contact\n\nline in violation of the Minsk Package of Measures, were spotted multiple times by the\n\nOSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (hereinafter – “OSCE SMM”) monitors.\n\n79 OSCE SMM, Latest from OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine based on information received\n\nas of 18:00 (Kyiv time), 1 October 2014, available at: https://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/124979. The OSCE\n\nSMM noted that: “SMM was alerted by representatives of the “DPR” “Ministry of Emergency Situations” about\n\nan incident close to a school in Kievs’kyi district (5 km north of the city centre), where shelling had allegedly\n\ncaused civilian casualties. When at the scene, the SMM saw a large crater, one metre in diameter, some 50 metres\n\nfrom the school, which it assessed to have been the impact of a shell of an unspecified nature. The SMM was\n\nguided inside the building by “DPR” representatives, who showed the SMM two bodies on the floor”.\n\n80 OSCE SMM, Latest from OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine, based on information received\n\nas of 18:00 (Kyiv time), 16 November 2014, available at: https://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/126802. The OSCE\n\nSMM noted that: “On 15 and 16 November the SMM visited the headquarters of the JCCC in Debaltseve (55 km\n\nnorth-east of Donetsk), where Ukrainian and the Russian Federation (RF) officers worked together with members\n\nof the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic” (“DPR”) and “Lugansk People’s Republic” (“LPR”). The shelling\n\nof Horlivka (43km north-east of Donetsk) on 15 November, which allegedly resulted in several civilian casualties\n\nincluding children, was acknowledged by all participants of the JCCC”.\n\n81\n\n82\n\nPage 36 out of 541\n\nFor example, in the Daily Report of 31 March 2018 of OSCE SMM reported on digging\n\ntrenches outside of civilian house occupied by UAF military personnel:\n\n“An SMM mini-UAV spotted on 29 March recently dug trenches about 40m\n\nfrom a residential house on the south-eastern edge of Travneve (governmentcontrolled,\n\n51km north-east of Donetsk)”.83\n\n65. The picture of the above-mentioned house was later demonstrated by the OSCE SMM\n\ndeputy head, Mr Alexander Hug, while delivering the briefing for the Diplomatic Corps\n\nat the SMM headquarters in Kiev on 30 March 2018.84\n\n66. On 4 December 2018, an SMM mini-UAV spotted a surface-to-air missile system (9K33\n\nOsa) near Klinovoe (68 km north-east of Donetsk) along with a group of UAF soldiers\n\noutside of an occupied civilian house.85\n\n67. In Disengagement Areas, UAF used civilian houses as a cover for trenches and armoured\n\nvehicles, in order to be able to maintain their position, illegally taken in so called “grey\n\nzone”. Thus, in OSCE SMM Daily Report of 23 April 2018 it was emphasised that:\n\n“The SMM observed armoured combat vehicles and an anti-aircraft gun in\n\nthe security zone. In government-controlled areas, the SMM saw on 20 April\n\nfour infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) (BMP-2) and an armoured\n\nreconnaissance vehicle (BRDM-2) near Zolote-1/Soniachnyi, two IFVs\n\n(BMP-2) near Zolote, five IFVs (BMP-2) near Zolote-3/Stahanovets, an\n\narmoured reconnaissance vehicle (BRM-1K) near Zolote 2 (60km west of\n\nLuhansk)… On 21 April, the SMM saw… three armoured reconnaissance\n\nvehicles (BRDM-2) and two IFVs (BMP-1) on flatbed trucks near Zolote…\n\nOn 22 April, the SMM saw two IFVs (BMP-2) near Zolote…”86\n\n68. The picture of one of the above mentioned IFV’s captured by OSCE SMM mini-UAV\n\nwas demonstrated during the OSCE SMM Deputy Head Mr Alexander Hug’s briefing for\n\nthe Diplomatic Corps in Kiev, on 14 May 2018.87\n\n83 Latest from the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM), based on information received as of\n\n19:30, 30 March 2018, available at: https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/376672.\n\n84 The OSCE SMM Deputy Chief Monitor Alexander Hug’s briefing for the Diplomatic corps, Photo, 30 March\n\n2018 (Annex 353).\n\n85 Latest from the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM), based on information received as of\n\n19:30, 5 December 2018, available at: https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/405533.\n\n86 Latest from the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM), based on information received as of\n\n19:30, 22 April 2018, available at: https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/378643.\n\n87 The OSCE SMM Deputy Chief Monitor Alexander Hug’s briefing for the Diplomatic corps, Photo, 14 May\n\n2018 (Annex 353).\n\nPage 37 out of 541\n\n69. In SMM Daily Report of 24 May 2018 it was noticed that:\n\n“Beyond withdrawal lines but outside designated storage sites, in\n\ngovernment-controlled areas, on 22 May an SMM mini-UAV spotted three\n\nsurface-to-air missile systems (9K35) about 50m south-east of a school\n\nbuilding in Tarasivka (43km north-west of Donetsk) ... In violation of\n\nwithdrawal lines in government-controlled areas, on 21 May an SMM mini-\n\nUAV spotted two surface-to-air missile systems (9K35 Strela-10) in a\n\nresidential area of Teple (31km north of Luhansk) within 200m of a civilian\n\nhouse, on 22 May an SMM mini-UAV spotted a surface-to-air missile system\n\n(9K35) about 2km north-east of Teple, an SMM long-range UAV spotted two\n\nsurface-to-air missile systems (9K33 Osa)”.88\n\n70. The pictures of the above mentioned UAF equipment along with students staying outside\n\nof the school buildings were later demonstrated by the SMM deputy head Mr Alexander\n\nHug while delivering the briefing for the Diplomatic Corps at the SMM headquarters in\n\nKiev on 1 June 2018.89\n\n71. Thus, Ukraine used the barbaric practice of using civilians as a human shield as has been\n\nshown in Preliminary Objections in another case before this Court.90\n\n72. In the Memorial, Ukraine’s position on terrorism was built on the (false) premise that the\n\nDPR and LPR intentionally targeted civil and other protected objects with heavy weapons\n\nin order to force Ukraine to peace talks and elicit significant concessions from it. In the\n\nReply, and in view of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary that the Russian\n\nFederation submitted with the Counter-Memorial, Ukraine has essentially abandoned\n\nsuch allegations of terrorist intent and instead alleges that the DPR and LPR targeted\n\nUkrainian military objects indiscriminately, while intentionally disregarding collateral\n\nloss of civilians or damage to the objects protected by the International humanitarian law\n\n(“IHL”).91\n\n73. Although this argument was apparently devised so as to overcome the unachievable\n\nevidentiary hurdle of proving terrorist intent, it is nothing more than cynical for Ukraine\n\n88 Latest from the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine (SMM), based on information received as of\n\n19:30, 23 May 2018, available at: https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/382423/.\n\n89 Photo of the UAF Surface to Air missiles 52 meters from public school in Tarasovka, Donetsk region, 22 May\n\n2018 (Annex 358).\n\n90\n\n91 See, for example, Reply, ¶249.\n\nPage 38 out of 541\n\nto embrace this new theory because whatever collateral damage the armed conflict in\n\nUkraine caused, it was predominantly due to Ukraine’s own persistent policy to use the\n\ncivil objects, its own civilians, and even civil aviation, as a human shield.\n\n74. IHL makes it a war crime to force non-combatants to serve as human shields. From the\n\nvery beginning of the military conflict in Donbass, the UAF did exactly what the IHL\n\nprohibits:\n\n(a) First, Ukraine conducted military air raids in the airspace over the conflict zone but\n\nat the same time did not halt intensive civilian air traffic over this territory. Ukraine\n\ndid not re-consider closing airspace for civil aircraft even after the DPR and LPR\n\nclaimed that they had “heavy-anti-aircraft systems” to shoot down Ukrainian\n\nmilitary aircraft,92 and even after their militia indeed shot down an Ilyushin Il-76\n\ntransport aircraft of the 25th Transport Aviation Brigade of the Ukrainian Air\n\nForce.93 In this way, Ukraine used the presence of civil aviation in the area to shield\n\nits fighter jets and complicate any efforts by the militia groups to intercept and shoot\n\nthem down.\n\n(b) Second, Ukraine marshalled and used civilian-marked vehicles to transport its\n\nmilitary personnel within the conflict zone.94 While there is no evidence that the\n\ncivil bus affected by the shelling in Volnovakha was ever a target, even if it were,\n\nan attack on it would have been the product of the provocative transportation\n\npractices by Ukraine rather than indiscriminate fire by the militia groups.\n\n(c) Ukraine located its heavy artillery and other military equipment in densely\n\npopulated areas. For example, the UAF stationed T-64BV tanks, two\n\narmoured personnel carriers “Saxon” and Gaz-66 military truck in the civil\n\nresidential district of Avdeyevka.95\n\n92 Informnapalm, Anti-Terrorist Operation: Summary for June 29, 2014 (30 June 2014), available at:\n\nhttps://informnapalm.org/en/anti-terrorist-operation-summary-for-june-29-2014/.\n\n93 Statement by the Delegation of Ukraine at the 758-th FSC Plenary Meeting (18 June 2014 at 10.00, Hofburg),\n\nFSC.DEL/116/14, 19 June 2014, available at: https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/0/0/120104.pdf.\n\n94 VPK News, Even school buses have been mobilised in Ukraine (14 April 2021), available at:\n\nhttps://vpk name/news/500051_na_ukraine_mobilizovali_dazhe_shkolnye_avtobusy.html (Annex 479), The\n\nTimes of Israel, Ukraine: Pro-Russian militants seize bus carrying int’l observers (25 April 2021), available at:\n\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/ukraine-pro-russian-militants-seize-bus-carrying-intl-observers/.\n\n95 Counter-Memorial (ICSFT), Annex 2, Expert Report of Major General Valery Alexeevich Samolenkov (“First\n\nSamolenkov Report”), p. 90.\n\nPage 39 out of 541\n\n75. T-64BV tanks, two armoured personnel carriers “Saxon”,\n\nGaz-66 military truck from the Bellingcat96 article\n\n76. Ukraine’s unlawful practices of using civilians as human shields have undoubtedly made\n\nit difficult for the militia groups to target military objects without at the same time\n\naffecting civil objects.\n\nB. UKRAINE CONTINUED TO TRADE OPENLY WITH DONETSK AND LUGANSK\n\n77. Ukraine's hypocritical approach to interpreting the ICSFT in the context of this case can\n\nbe illustrated by its own practice of applying the relevant article of its own Criminal Code\n\nand continuing trade with the DPR and LPR.\n\n78. It should be noted that Article 258-5 on “financing of terrorism” was incorporated into\n\nthe Criminal Code of Ukraine by Law No. 2258-VI of 18 May 2010. However, as the\n\npractice of its application shows, it has not been used for the real fight against the\n\nfinancing of terrorism, but solely as a repressive tool against the people of Donbass, as\n\nwell as the opponents of the current Kiev authorities.\n\n96 Bellingcat, Ukrainian Tanks in Avdiivka Residential Area (3 February 2017), available at:\n\nhttps://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/02/03/ukrainian-tanks-avdiivkaresidential-area/ (Counter-\n\nMemorial (ICSFT), Annex 258).\n\nPage 40 out of 541\n\n79. The Unified Register of Court Decisions of Ukraine contains only 14 verdicts in criminal\n\ncases of “financing of terrorism”.\n\n80. In a number of cases, charges of “financing of terrorism” were brought against residents\n\nof Donbass whose only “crime” was to make life easier for civilians in the region, such\n\nas entrepreneurs who provided money transfer services to Kiev-controlled territory.\n\nThese services were in especial demand among ordinary people, who were deprived of\n\nthe opportunity to transfer money to their relatives due to the shutdown of Ukrainian\n\nbanks in the DPR and LPR. The clients’ money was physically transported by a “broker”\n\nacross the Contact Line, deposited into the “broker’s” personal account in a Ukrainian\n\nbank, and then transferred to the recipient’s account on behalf of the “broker”.\n\n81. On 28 December 2015, the Darnitsky District Court in Kiev convicted two residents of\n\nthe Lugansk region for such a “crime”. The text of the judgment explicitly stated, in a\n\ncursory manner, that the accused committed the acts they were charged with, “realizing\n\nthat there was a shortage of cash in the financial market of Lugansk region”.97\n\n82. The dire situation with the banking services was created by Kiev’s decision to discontinue\n\nany such services for the people of the DPR and LPR. The Government of Ukraine should\n\nhave restored such services in accordance with the Minsk Agreements, but never did so.\n\n83. People have also been prosecuted for ordinary business activities that had nothing to do\n\nwith the conflict in Donbass. On 29 March 2018, for example, the Zarechny District\n\nCourt of Sumy convicted the CEO of Snack Export LLC for the supply of snacks and\n\nbeer to the LPR.98\n\n84. Against this background, as pointed out in the Counter-Memorial, 99Ukraine and its\n\nenterpris"
