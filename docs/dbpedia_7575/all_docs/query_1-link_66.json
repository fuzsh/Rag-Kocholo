        "text": "If you are planning your visit to Split in October, you can’t be wrong as Split is an attractive place whatever month you choose.\n\nOctober together with May are months of so called âlow seasonâ. The weather in October can sometimes be unpredictable but still you can expect pleasant sunny days ideal for swimming and sunbathing.\n\nSometimes it can be cooler but mild enough for all outdoors activities.\n\nWeather In Split In October\n\nAccording to official weather-forecasts, the average high temperature in October is around 20.0 Â°C (68 Â°F) with average nine rainy days.\n\nOctober boasts of 197 sunshine hours but if you plan to visit Hvar Island and Dubrovnik, you can expect even more sunshine hours in this period.\n\nWeather in October sometimes can be influenced by phenomenon known as Indian summer.\n\nIndian summer usually occurs in October (in any part of the month), with temperatures above average for October.\n\nThe days are sunny and warm and relatively fresh morning with possible frequent mists.\n\nMinimum temperatures usually range from 8 to 14 degrees, and the maximum daily from 21 to 26 degrees C (69,8 to 78,8 F).\n\nSometimes this sudden return of the “summer” can last even 15 days, surprising all tourist, that the season continues well into late October.\n\nIn 2013 happened the same when the temperature reached almost 30 degree C (86 F).\n\nThe photo of Bacvice beach swimmers and Picigin players in second part of October 2013, demonstrates how you can be lucky if you visit Split in this month.\n\nWhat To Do In October\n\nIn this month, Split can not boast of important cultural events like those in July and August, but still there are a lot of things to do and see.\n\nWhat is open out of season? You don’t have to worry about it! Split is a city of some 200,000 people and most of its attractions are open all year\n\nSplit in October is certainly more pleasant to explore, when the narrow Diocletian Palace’s streetsÂ are less crowded for leisurely walk around the old city. Museums and galleries are still open.\n\nIslands Harvest Events\n\nVisiting Split in October is a good chance to take part in many harvests on Brac and Hvar islands. Here you can check some off season programs on Hvar island.\n\nAll islands are in a full grape and olive harvest and why not be a part of these events. In October ferries are on their winter schedule that is effective until the end of May 2016.\n\nFerries are less frequent but the most important ferries to Hvar and Brac island have enough daily departures during the lower 2015 season:\n\nSplit-Stari Grad(Hvar island)-Split schedule\n\nSplit-Supetar (Brac island)-Split\n\nSplit-Vis-Split\n\nOctober Hotel Prices\n\nPrices of hotels in October will be reduced almost for 50%. Some smaller private hotels will be closed, as well the camping sites.\n\nThis is also a great opportunity to book your accommodation in premier hotels and resorts such as Radisson Blu.\n\nThe most of hostels will be still open, but I suggest you the check availability of hostels in Split.\n\nOctober Accommodation examples\n\nVisiting Split in October can be a real deal for vacations. Here are some examples of hotels, apartments, rooms or hostels in this period:\n\nPrices based on: 14 nights (Oct 03 – Oct 17) for 2 adults.\n\nApartments:\n\nPriska Apartment, with Balcony – Free Wifi – Price before October â¬ 1516, in October â¬ 546,00\n\nHostels:\n\nGoli&Bosi (modern design hostel) – Normal price â¬ 2688, in OctoberÂ â¬ 588,00\n\nHostel Tchaikovsky in above period – Only â¬ 434,00\n\nHostel Split Backpacker in the same period – Only â¬ 308,00\n\nHotels:\n\nHotels 3 stars – Split Bellevue (Riva Waterfront) – 14 nights (Oct 03 – Oct 17) for 2 adults instead â¬ 3262 now â¬ 1190,00\n\nHotel 4 stars – Best Western Art Hotel SplitÂ – 14 nights (Oct 03 – Oct 17) for 2 adults instead â¬ 4494 now â¬ 1508,00\n\n5 stars hotels – Atrium Hotel Split – 14 nights (Oct 03 – Oct 17) for 2 adults instead â¬ 4436Â now â¬ 1959,00"
