PURPOSE: Building a new model for children movement education in a family. The proposed model is open and universal, can be modified by the parents in connection to financial possibilities and interest of a child. METHODS: Material collected on 2500 subjects of different age and with various methods: test global-movement coordination, the study of development movement abilities in ontogenesis, analysis contents of 29 sports as an element of a model for children movements development. RESULTS: The base the model are so willingly practiced by girls and boys of different countries. Suggested model was verified during 6 years on 2000 children. Part of the model was applied in ex-USSR, Sweden, Germany, Italy, Brazil and Uruguay. CONCLUSIONS: The suggested model is to be used not only in a family but also in the kindergarten, school, sports classes, and club, or any other institution connected with physical education. Realization of the model allows developing successfully movement coordination in a child during the most suitable age and with a wide range of means. It helps to develop versatile physical and movement abilities in a child that prepares it to active life, improves health, and physical fitness. It is a good base for top-level sport, sport for all or recreation.\n\nS2 Field-based tests for the assessment of physical fitness in youth practicing sports: a systematic review within the ESA program\n\nAntonino Bianco (antonino.bianco@unipa.it)\n\nDepartment of Psychology, Educational Science and Human Movement, University of Palermo, Italy\n\nPURPOSE: To systematically review the field-based tests used in the literature to assess Physical Fitness (PF) in children and adolescents practicing sport within the European context. METHODS: PubMed and Scopus databases were adopted. RESULTS: A total of 123 articles were included in the final review. The adopted batteries were EUROFIT, KTK, National Federations’ batteries, HIRTZ, ALPHA, and BOT2. The others were generic batteries. Muscular strength/power was assessed through a variety of tests in 52 studies (67.5%). Among these, lower body strength was assessed through vertical jumps by 72.3% of them while the upper body strength was assessed through dynamometry in 14.5% of the studies and through medicine ball throw in 20.5% of the papers. A total of 55.3% of the studies assessed speed, through sprint of 5-40 or 60m; 4x10m sprint. 50% of studies assessing coordination used the KTK, and the other half used obstacle-run, walk-backward, plate-tapping, eye-hand-foot coordination. CONCLUSION: The present study provides a framework of the field-based tests used to assess PF in children and adolescents practicing sport across European countries. High heterogeneity was evidenced among the used tests for health- and skill-related fitness assessment. Ultimately, the review aims to suggest a new fitness test battery that will fit the needs of the consortium.\n\nS3 Exercise and quality of life in the elderly\n\nJames S. Skinner (jimskinnrphd@gmail.com)\n\nIndiana University, Bloomington, USA\n\nPURPOSE: This presentation summarizes the literature on exercise and quality of life (QoL) in the elderly. Aging is associated with a decline in volume and intensity of physical activity, resulting in a decrease in muscle size, strength, power, and aerobic performance. These factors contribute to a reduction in mobility, self-confidence, independence, and QoL. Regular participation in exercise can delay or prevent many of the declines associated with aging and has a positive effect on many factors associated with a reduced QoL. Active people also perceive that their QoL is higher than do sedentary people. CONCLUSIONS: Regular exercise improves psychological health and wellbeing. Examples of improvements include increased self-concept and self-esteem, reduced risk for clinical depression and anxiety, dementia and cognitive decline, and fear of falling. While exercise has been consistently shown to be beneficial, the effects are often moderate and variable. As a result, the optimal programs to improve QoL are not known. There are suggestions that group-based programs are better than home-based programs and that this is related to the social aspects of exercising in a group. Several studies suggest that moderate-intensity exercise is better than low- or high-intensity exercise. Nevertheless, many different types of exercise have been shown to be beneficial, including aerobic training, resistance or strength training, walking, hopping, swimming, aquatic exercise, as well as exercises to improve flexibility and balance.\n\nS4 Fitter kids for a healthier adult society\n\nFrancisco B. Ortega1,2,3 (ortegaf@ugr.es)\n\n1Co-Director of the PROFITH “PROmoting FITness and Health through physical activity” research group; 2Department of Physical Education and Sports, Faculty of Sport Sciences, University of Granada, Spain; 3Department of Biosciences and Nutrition at NOVUM, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden\n\nFrom the landmark studies of Prof. Paffenbarger and Blair in the 70's and 80's to date, an enormous amount of evidence has accumulated supporting a strong link between the cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), and more recently also muscular strength (MST), in adulthood and overall and specific morbidity and mortality. Several longitudinal studies also showed that physical fitness (both CRF and MST) in childhood and adolescence are associated with lower risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and other health outcomes. However, whether physical fitness assessment at these young ages directly predict future mortality and morbidity was unknown, since very large cohorts and with a very long follow-up are needed to test these hypotheses and it has been a lack of such studies. During my presentation in this scientific event, I will cover this topic, presenting the state of the art in relation to fitness in youth and future health. I will discuss not only the importance of fitness for physical health but also for better brain health, including both mental health and cognition/brain enhancement.\n\nS5 How can health literacy influence health status?\n\nJozsef Betlehem, Henrietta Banfai-Csonka, Attila Pandur, Bence Schiszler, Balint Banfai, Pongrac Acs, Balazs Radnai\n\nFaculty of Health Sciences, University of Pecs, Hungary\n\nCorrespondence: Jozsef Betlehem (betlehem@etk.pte.hu)\n\nPURPOSE: Health literacy-based interventions gain greater attention in each developed society. Our purpose was to conduct a systematic review and determine if health literacy might benefit health outcomes. METHODS: Data was collected from English-language reviews using PubMed between 2008-2018. The reviewers shared the work: abstracting article information; checking information for accuracy; deciding on overall appropriateness and synthesis. Keywords for search: health literacy, health status, review. RESULTS: The frequency of review articles in a correlation of health literacy and health status increased in the past ten years (PubMedsum:53;2009:4;2018:12). The review articles reported a clear relationship between health literacy and health status independently from the conceptual framework. A narrow and wide concept of health literacy can be observed. USA studies focus on functional health literacy influencing health status mainly while European studies include control over health and personal, social, environmental factors, too. Differences in health literacy level were consistently associated with increased hospitalizations, greater emergency care use, poorer ability to take medications appropriately, poorer ability to interpret labels and health messages, poorer overall health status, and even higher mortality. Using intervention and looking for their effect is one way of changing the health literacy level of society which is used widely recently. CONCLUSION: Low health literacy is associated with poorer health outcomes in all reviews and therefore it is a good predictor of health status.\n\nS6 Exercise and quality of life in healthy adolescents, women with eating disorders and female elite athletes\n\nJorunn Sundgot-Borgen (jorunn.sundgot-borgen@nih.no)\n\nDepartment of Sports Medicine, The Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, Oslo, Norway\n\nThe link between exercise and quality of life is understudied in some groups. Among those are a) adolescents with body dissatisfaction, b) women with eating disorders and c) female elite athletes. A high prevalence of adolescents is struggling with body dissatisfaction and body image predicts health-related quality of life (HRQoL) more strongly than other variables. However, the long-term effect of school-based intervention studies aiming to improve body image and HRQoL is not known. Women with eating disorders report impaired quality of life (QoL) and well-being. However, the effect of different treatment interventions (including physical exercise) on QoL is inadequately addressed. Finally, evidence regarding QoL in female elite athletes is lacking. This presentation will focus on recent studies and findings regarding 1. The long-term effects of a school-based intervention study aiming to improve body image and HRQoL, 2. The effect of treatment (physical exercise and nutrition guidance) on eating disorder symptomatology and QoL in women with eating disorder and 3. QoL in elite female athletes who are mothers.\n\nS7 Impact of 5-2-1-0: a community-based childhood obesity prevention initiative\n\nDejan Magoc (dmagoc@stetson.edu)\n\nDepartment of Health Sciences, Stetson University, DeLand, Florida, USA\n\n‘5-2-1-0’ is a nationally recognized initiative with a goal to raise awareness about the importance and benefits of healthy eating and active living among children. PURPOSE: To improve healthy daily behaviors in four domains (5 servings or more of fruits and vegetables (FV); 2 hours or less of screen time (e.g., tablets, video games); 1 hour or more of physical activity (PA); 0 sugary drinks/more water) that have been demonstrated to impact overweight and obesity among children. METHODS: One-hundred-eighteen children (64 girls and 54 boys; age 8.6 ± 1.6 years; BMI 20.7 ± 9.2 kg/m2) enrolled in the summer camp and after-school programs in DeLand, Florida, participated in this quasi-experimental study design. Participants completed a questionnaire that assessed and tracked changes in their health behaviors in four, aforementioned, domains. RESULTS: Following a 12-week prevention initiative, participants significantly a) increased daily minutes of PA, t(117) = 2.2, p < 0.05; b) increased daily intake of FV, t(117) = 2.3, p < 0.05; and c) decreased daily usage of electronic devices, t(117) = 2.7, p < 0.05. CONCLUSION: A community-based awareness approach to improve healthy eating and active living was associated with improved child behavior changes. Longitudinal studies could provide a better image of how sustainable these changes become over time.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nSupported by the Community-Based Research Office, Stetson University.\n\nS8 Physical (in)activity in early school-age: what are we doing wrong?\n\nSanja Music Milanovic1,2 (sanja.music@hzjz.hr)\n\n1Croatian Institute of Public Health, Health Promotion Division, Zagreb, Croatia; 2School of Medicine, School of Public Health “Andrija Stampar”, University of Zagreb, Croatia\n\nPhysical inactivity is one of the key risk factors for the leading chronic non-communicable diseases. Physically inactive children are at higher risk of becoming inactive adults. In Croatia, at the age of 8, 89.8% of children reach the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity per day, by engaging in free outdoor play. However, at the age of 15, only 19% of adolescents reach these recommendations. What happens during this period? Why are our children becoming more and more inactive as they age? While this phenomenon has been observed worldwide and is often associated with various physical, social and psychological changes that occur with maturation, we have to ask ourselves what can be done to diminish this occurrence. The Croatian National Health Promotion Program „Healthy Living“ aims to promote healthy lifestyles by offering support for engaging in various forms of physical activity, in different settings throughout the lifespan.\n\nS9 The post-millennials' lifestyle and what physical education can do about it?\n\nVisnja Djordjic (djordjicvisnja@gmail.com)\n\nFaculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, Serbia\n\nPost-millennials, also known as Generation Z, are the first generation born in an entirely digital world. This demographic cohort, influenced strongly by technology and social media, includes people born 1997-present. Post-millennials share some distinctive lifestyle features in comparison to other generations: they are more sedentary, less active, more digitally dependent, and less exposed to the natural environment. Excessive use of electronic media, in particular, may affect overall health and wellbeing of children and youth. Possible health risks include obesity, sleep disorders, mental health issues, lack of physical fitness and motor competence, postural disorders, etc. At the same time, post-millennials are frequently described as multi-taskers, open-minded, diverse, global and health aware, which also has to be considered when designing quality physical education programs. If physical education is to remain an effective social strategy for increasing physical activity, it has to be shaped by the specific needs and interests of today’s youth. In that regard, a shift toward more holistic and culturally responsive physical education, with a focus on health, inclusion, and fitness might be necessary. Enhancing student’s perceived and actual motor competence through a variety of positive, personally relevant learning experiences, is vital for lifelong physical activity participation. Moreover, a whole-school approach to physical activity promotion, which provides a lot of opportunities for students to be active before, during, and after school hours, has been recommended.\n\nS10 Physical activity and motor skills in preschool children\n\nSanja Salaj (sanja.salaj@kif.hr)\n\nFaculty of Kinesiology University of Zagreb, Croatia\n\nCompetence in the field of motor skills contributes to children's physical, cognitive and social development. Motor proficiency is positively associated with health benefits and negatively associated with obesity. Children with a higher level of motor skills tend to be more active than those with lower level motor skills. Different countries have set their recommendation on daily physical activity of preschool children from 60 to 180 minutes of moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity, in some cases with more specific requirements of different structured and free play. Although often assumed that young children are very active throughout the day, recent studies indicate that young children spend a majority of the day in sedentary activities and spend <5% of the day in moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Reasons for low physical activity levels are not well understood, but one of the suggestions is a low level of motor proficiency. Few studies have examined the relationship between physical activity and motor skills in children and found a significant but small relationship of motor skills to physical activity in general, rather higher when compared to MVPA. There are other factors that influence physical activity in youth, but recent evidence suggests that motor skill learning may be important in promoting a physically active lifestyle in preschool children.\n\nS11 HEPA Europe – Before – Now – and ???\n\nFinn Berggren1,2,3\n\n1Board member and co-founder, HEPA Europe; 2International Adviser/Past President and CEO; 3Gerlev P.E. & Sports Academy/Gerlev Center for Play and Move, Denmark\n\nHEPA Europe is a European Network for the promotion of health-enhancing physical activity (PA) and founded in May 2005 in Gerlev (Denmark). The vision of the Network is to achieve better health through PA among all people in Europe. The Network has been growing every year and today there are 171 member-institutions and 3 individual members from 38 countries. Its goal is to strengthen and support efforts and actions that increase participation and improve the conditions favorable to a healthy lifestyle. The objectives are to: promote a better understanding of health-enhancing PA and give a stronger voice to PA promotion in health policy and in other relevant sectors in Europe, including support for workforce development; develop, support, and disseminate effective strategies and multi-sectoral approaches in the promotion of health-enhancing PA; foster the preservation and creation of social and physical environments as well as values and lifestyles supportive of health-enhancing PA; together with other relevant institutions and organizations, improve coordination in PA promotion across sectors and administrative structures. HEPA Europe is not just a network meeting annually but Working Groups are established based on a proposal by the Steering Committee to facilitate the implementation of specific projects and activities, as agreed in the program of work of the Network. Since 2005 the Network has published several scientific publications.\n\nOral presentations\n\nO1 Hydrogen-rich water positively affects HOMA2 variables in physically inactive population\n\nDarinka Korovljev, Dejan Javorac, Valdemar Stajer, Sergej M. Ostojic\n\nFaculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, Serbia\n\nCorrespondence: Sergej M. Ostojic (sergej.ostojic@chess.edu.rs)\n\nSupplemental molecular hydrogen improves biomarkers of cardiometabolic health in physically active men and women yet no human studies evaluated its effects on steady state beta cell function and insulin sensitivity in non-active humans. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of 28-day intake of hydrogen-rich water (HRW) on Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA2) outcomes and body composition in a cohort of physically inactive men and women. METHODS: Twelve overweight inactive volunteers (7 women and 5 men; age 56.2 ± 10.0 years; BMI 37.7 ± 5.3 kg/m2) participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Participants were allocated to receive either HRW (1 L/day) or placebo (tap water) for 28 days. HRW was produced by dissolving an effervescent magnesium tablet (HRW Natural Health Products Inc., New Westminster, Canada) into a cup of water (500 mL). RESULTS: Drinking HRW was superior to placebo to increase insulin sensitivity (for up to 11.1%; p < 0.05), and tended to reduce body fat at 28-day follow-up more as compared to placebo (- 4.2% vs. 0.6%; p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: The results of this trial nominate HRW as a possible nutritional strategy to improve insulin sensitivity in overweight inactive population. Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT03625362\",\"term_id\":\"NCT03625362\"}}NCT03625362).\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nSupported by the Serbian Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development (175037), the Provincial Secretariat for Higher Education and Scientific Research (114-451-710), the Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, and HRW Natural Health Products Inc.\n\nO2 Physical fitness and body mass index in Algerian university students\n\nMohammed Zerf1, Hadjar Mohamed Kherfane1, Regig Madani1, SBA Bouabdellah2, Boras Fatima Zohra1, Gourari Benali1\n\n1Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Mostaganem, Algeria; 2Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, University Hassiba Ben Bouali of Chlef, Algeria\n\nCorrespondence: Mohammed Zerf (biomeca.zerf@outlook.com)\n\nPhysical fitness is acknowledged to have profound effects on public health worldwide, with regular collecting data likely being crucial for addressing the problem and implementing different strategies to fight physical inactivity. PURPOSE: To determine basic physical fitness components and body mass index in university students in Algeria. METHODS: Two hundred healthy university students (20 to 24 years old), with no regular sports activities were randomly recruited for this study, during the academic year 2016-2017. They were tested in several basic physical fitness tests (Pushups. Sit-ups, Chin-Ups, and 1.5 Mile Run), and body mass index. RESULTS: Average values of fitness tests result showed a decreased level of physical fitness and a high incidence of overweight and obesity in University students. CONCLUSION: Low level of physical fitness and a high incidence of obesity in Algerian students is likely at least partially related to physical inactivity. Hence, there is evidence enough to justify the further development of public health policies to promote physical activity in Algerian student population.\n\nO3 The influence of exercise on the functional status and quality of life of patients that were surgically treated for breast cancer\n\nSanja D. Tomic1, Goran Malenkovic1,2, Slobodan V. Tomic1\n\n1University of Novi Sad, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Nursing, Novi Sad, Serbia; 2Institute for Oncology of Vojvodina in Sremska Kamenica, Serbia\n\nCorrespondence: Sanja D. Tomic (sanja.tomic@mf.uns.ac.rs)\n\nBreast cancer surgery is connected with the risk of developing functional limitations that can negatively influence the quality of life. PURPOSE: Estimate the influence of early postoperative exercises on the quality of life 3 months after surgery. METHODS: The prospective study involved 149 patients, divided into groups according to surgical intervention. Group A consisted of 67 patients with an average age of 57.13 ± 13.72 group Q 82 patients with an average age of 58.34 ± 11.59. Assessment of the quality of life was done by the SF-36 questionnaire and functional testing before and 3 months after surgery. All data was input in the StatSoft software (Statistica 10.0 StatSoft, Inc., Dell, USA) and displayed as average values with standard deviations. Analysis has estimated the impact of the intervention comparing findings before and 3 months after surgery using t-test and Leven's test, a correlation was displayed by using Spearman's coefficient. RESULTS: After exercise mental, physical and general health in both groups of participants (MH 63.74% versus 49.70%, PH 66.99% versus 53.46%, GH 65.37% versus 51.58%) improved. CONCLUSION: Early postoperative exercises contribute to functional recovery and facilitate the increase in life quality.\n\nO4 Positive effects on muscular fitness after 10 weeks of ball game training in primary school children\n\nDejan Madic, Nebojsa Trajkovic, Danilo Radanovic, Drazenka Macak\n\nFaculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, Serbia\n\nCorrespondence: Dejan Madic (dekimadic@gmail.com)\n\nA growing body of research has highlighted the health benefits of football training in children. It is unclear, however, whether different ball training at school can have similar favorable effects. PURPOSE: To determine the effects of a 10-week ball game training program on muscular fitness in children aged 12-14 years. METHODS: A total of 64 school children were randomized to ball game group (푛=32; age 13.26 ± 0.29; height 163.49 ± 9.97 cm; weight 50.29 ± 10.31 kg), or a control group (푛=32; age 13.45 ± 0.47; height 168.27 ± 9.30 cm; weight 55.08 ± 9.55 kg). The ball game group had twice per week (≈40min) small-sided games training (football, basketball, handball, volleyball) for 10 weeks. The control group attended their regular PE class twice per week. RESULTS: The groups did not differ significantly at baseline in any fitness performance measures. Significant Group by Time interactions were noted for vertical jump, standing long jump, medicine ball throw, bent arm hang and sit and reach, F = 12.121, 62.567, 19.917, 39.580, 5.276, respectively, p < 0.05, with ball game group making significantly greater improvement than the control group. CONCLUSION: A 10-week school-based ball game intervention was effective to improve muscular fitness in children aged 12-14.\n\nO5 Free-time activity, sustainability and healthy lifestyle along the river Tisza. marking cultural and nature conservation trails\n\nJudit Raffai, Ester Gabric, Geza Cekus\n\nHungarian Language Teacher Training Faculty, University of Novi Sad, Serbia\n\nCorrespondence: Judit Raffai (raffaij6@gmail.com)\n\nThe present study elaborates upon the outcomes of the WATERTOUR (HUSRB/1602/31/0204) project from the aspects of the free-time activity, sustainability, and healthy lifestyle. PURPOSE: Local opportunities and actions will be discussed regarding the encouragement of a healthy lifestyle, which could offer recreational activities along the promotion of cultural and natural values. PROJECT PRESENTATION: According to the Statistical Office, in 2015 the female members of the society (above the age of 15) disposed of 6 hours of free time daily, while the male members 7. However, men tended to spend 30 minutes doing sports activities/spending time in nature, while women only 16. The present project aims to encourage tourism and sports activities along the river Tisza as well as to provide cultural and nature conservation trails. Our objective is to establish land trails along the river Tisza (Kanjiza, Novi Knezevac, Senta and Coka) that merge cultural, architectural, ethnographical and natural values which aim to attract various generations, families, offer spending quality time in nature. CONCLUSION: With the support of local municipalities, the established cultural and nature conservation trails along the river Tisza will increase the recreational opportunities while ensuring familiarization with local values.\n\nO6 Making a move: increasing physical activity using smartphones and android applications\n\nZolt Namestovski, Dijana Karuovic2, Cintija Kovac1, Lenke Major1, Molnar Gyorgy3\n\n1Hungarian Language Teacher Training Faculty, University of Novi Sad, Serbia; 2Technical faculty \"Mihajlo Pupin\", University of Novi Sad, Serbia; 3Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Hungary\n\nCorrespondence: Zolt Namestovski (zsolt.namesztovszki@magister.uns.ac.rs)\n\nMobile phones are becoming increasingly popular worldwide. According to the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia, in 2018, 93.0% of all households own a mobile phone and have Internet connection via mobile (smart) phones, while tablets (3G network) proved to be the most popular form of connection to the Internet, with 67.5% of households opting for this type of connection in 2018. PURPOSE: To report and review the possibilities and opportunities of smartphones and Android applications for increasing physical activities for students in Serbia and Hungary. CASE PRESENTATION: Smartphones incorporate many different sensors, which can be used to measure and boost regular physical activity (GPS sensors, vision sensors, audio sensors, light sensors, temperature sensors, direction sensors, and acceleration sensors). Moreover, there are specific additional services, such as social and online experience (competitions within the online community and competing with one's own results), notifications and gamification. CONCLUSION: Based on the literature review, categorization and reviewing mobile applications and a pilot survey among the students, it can be concluded that there is a wide range of opportunities to increase physical activities using smartphones and their Android applications.\n\nO7 The development of stress relief and problem resolution strategies among pre-service teachers via biological-cultural programs along the River Tisza\n\nValeria Pinter Krekity, Lenke Major, Zolt Namestovski, Rita Horak, Agnes Baganj\n\nHungarian Language Teacher Training Faculty, University of Novi Sad, Serbia\n\nCorrespondence: Zolt Namestovski (zsolt.namesztovszki@magister.uns.ac.rs)\n\nThe profession of teaching proves to be one of the most stressful occupations. The continuous effects of stress among pre-service teachers have a negative influence on their physical and mental health. PURPOSE: The present research aims to introduce a preventive program that offers participation in free-time, sports and cultural activities performed in nature. The program which aims to impact the participants’ complex, physical and mental health is based on pedagogical, methodological and health-developmental principles. METHODS: The Rahe-type Brief Stress and Coping Questionnaire were conducted among the students of the Hungarian Language Teacher Training Faculty, University of Novi Sad. RESULTS: According to the results, symptoms of severe depression and anxiety were detected. However, assistance in coping with stress in various life aspects is highly required. CONCLUSION: The psychological well-being of pre-service teachers and pre-school teachers are fundamentally influenced by stress and its coping mechanisms. Familiarization with the biological-cultural values along the river Tisza offers preventive, complex programs to establish direct contact with the natural and social environment as well as to ensure its sustainability. Meanwhile, it also enables pre-service teachers to acquire various stress-relief techniques and develop their stress coping mechanisms.\n\nO8 Variations in adiposity, body fat percentage, and muscular strength, according to physical activity level in young adults\n\nOmer Barıs Kaya1, Mustafa Sogut1, Kubra Altunsoy1, Cain CT. Clark2\n\n1Faculty of Sport Sciences, Kırıkkale University, Turkey; 2Department of Sport, University Centre Hartpury (University of the West of England), Gloucestershire, UK\n\nCorrespondence: Mustafa Sogut\n\nPURPOSE: The aims of this study were to examine the discrepancies between moderately physically active (MPA) and highly physically active (HPA) male (n=96, age=22.5±1.7 years) and female (n=85, age=21.3±1.6 years) young adults regarding various anthropometric adiposity indices (AIs), body fat percentage (BF%), and muscular strength, and to determine the associations between physical activity level (PAL) and the aforementioned variables. METHODS: Participants’ height, body mass, BF%, waist and hip circumferences, and maximal isometric grip strength was measured. They were dichotomized according to their PAL, estimated by the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), as MPA (≥600-3000 MET-min/week) and HPA (≥3000 MET-min/week). RESULTS: Participants in the HPA groups had significantly lower BF% (ES 0.67 ♂; 0.72 ♀), body mass (ES 0.46 ♂; 0.58 ♀), waist circumference (ES 0.55 ♂; 0.48 ♀), hip circumference (ES 0.46 ♂; 0.49 ♀), and BMI (ES 0.46 ♂; 0.59 ♀) than the participants in the MPA groups in both genders. Grip strength performances were comparable between groups. The PAL, regardless of gender, was found to be significantly and negatively correlated with all AIs and BF%. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that high habitual physical activity level mediates body size and composition among young adults.\n\nO9 Agreement in estimates of body fat percentage between BIA and BMI-based body fat equations in female young adults\n\nKubra Altunsoy1, Mustafa Sogut1, Omer Barıs Kaya1, Cain CT. Clark2\n\n1Faculty of Sport Sciences, Kırıkkale University, Turkey; 2Department of Sport, University Centre Hartpury (University of the West of England), Gloucestershire, UK\n\nCorrespondence: Mustafa Sogut\n\nPURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the body fat percentage (BF%) values estimated with various body mass index (BMI)-based BF% equations and bioelectrical impedance (BIA). METHODS: One hundred and eighty-three female young adults (age=20.5±1.8 years, BMI=21.5±3.1kg/m2) participated in the study. Height and body mass were measured to calculate BMI. BF% was determined by BIA and predicted using BMI-based equations (BMIDE; BMIJA; BMIWO; BMIGA). RESULTS: Dependent t-test results revealed that there was no significant difference (P>0.05) in BF% between BIA and BMIJA. However, significant differences (P<0.01) were found between BIA and all other equations in BF%. The magnitude of difference, when compared to BIA, was trivial for BMIJA (ES 0.10), and small for BMIDE, BMIWO, and BMIGA (ES 0.24, 0.47 and 0.24, respectively). The standard error of estimate ranged from 3.85 (BMIJA) to 3.91% (BMIGA). Bland-Altman analysis indicated that the 95% limits of agreement were narrowest for BMIJA (±7.62%) and widest for BMIDE (±8.47%). CONCLUSION: These results highlight the practical usefulness of BMIJA equation in predicting BF% among female young adults when BIA, one of the most ubiquitous field techniques, is not available.\n\nO10 The pedagogical potential of a user-friendly specialized dictionary in function of adopting a healthy lifestyle\n\nMira Milic1, Filip Sadri1, Tatjana Glusac2\n\n1Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, Serbia; 2Faculty of Law and Business Studies, Union University, Belgrade, Serbia\n\nCorrespondence: Mira Milic (mmilic@uns.ac.rs)\n\nEven though specialized dictionaries provide abundant information, research findings indicate that their role in the teaching process has been neglected. Within the context of the current global domination of English and an increased need for linguistic standardization, special emphasis is placed on the use of specialized dictionaries in teaching vocabulary. PURPOSE: To analyze the pedagogical potential of a user-friendly specialized dictionary in function of adopting a healthy lifestyle. METHOD: A questionnaire-based research into dictionary use in ESP acquisition is conducted with 705 students of non-linguistic faculties of the University of Novi Sad. RESULTS: Quantitative research indicates students' insufficient knowledge not only of lexicographic conventions but also the criteria for dictionary quality assessment, whereas the qualitative analysis reveals a preference for online dictionaries and other user-friendly applications. CONCLUSION: Building on the hypothesis that well-conceived dictionaries can contribute to teaching an active lifestyle in non-English speaking regions, this research suggests the importance of quality terminological products and systematic training in dictionary use.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis paper is a part of the research on Project No. 142-451-3684/2017-01/01, entitled Using Dictionaries in Teaching English for Specific Purposes in Tertiary Education, financially supported by the Secretariat for Higher Education and Scientific Research of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Serbia.\n\nO11 Exercise-based treatment after an ACL injury and a meniscal surgical repair: A case report\n\nMario J. Roska1, Natasa Pencic2, Alessandro Ruspantini3\n\n1Corrective Exercise Center “Howfit”, Novi Sad, Serbia; 2Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, Serbia; 3Aspire Academy, Doha, Qatar\n\nCorrespondence: Mario J. Roska (marioroska@gmail.com)\n\nPURPOSE: In this case report we will demonstrate the effects of an exercise-based treatment after an ACL injury and a meniscal surgical repair in an elite UEFA Women's Champions League soccer goalkeeper with the main goal to successfully return to play. CASE PRESENTATION: The assessment consisted of two questionnaires for psychological readiness to return to play, physical readiness was assessed via muscular strength, agility, speed, cardio-respiratory fitness, coordination, and lower limb asymmetry via single-leg hop tests. The five-month exercise-based program consisted of aquatic exercises, gym therapy sessions and on-field (sport-specific) training. The final results showed an increase in psychological readiness to return to play by 60%, physical functions improved by 72%, and lower limb asymmetry was not higher than 10%. CONCLUSION: Exercise-based therapy has shown to be an effective way to return a female soccer goalkeeper to play and it should be considered as a treatment option for an athlete who suffered from an ACL injury or a surgical meniscus repair.\n\nO12 Link with motivation and psychological states of elite athletes\n\nGeorgiy Korobeynikov1, Mario Baic2, Lesia Korobeynikova1, Bahman Mirzaei3\n\n1Department of Biomechanics and Sport Metrology, National University of Physical Education and Sport, Ukraine; 2Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Zagreb, Croatia; 3Department of Exercise Physiology, Faculty of Sport Sciences, University of Guilan, Iran\n\nCorrespondence: Georgiy Korobeynikov (george.65.w@gmail.com)\n\nAmong different factors which influence to the effectiveness of sports activities the most characteristic is a psychical function of athletes. But, the formation of individual strategies of modern sports activity is corresponding to the motivation process. PURPOSE: The study of links between motivation and psychological states in elite athletes. METHODS: The 26 athlete's members of the National Team of Ukraine of Greco-Roman wrestling were studied. For the study of motivation to achieve was used the questionnaire (by Mehrabian A). All of the athletes were separated into three groups by level of corresponding motivation. The psychical states studied by an estimate of some methods. RESULTS: In athletes with a high level of motivation to achieve were observed the increasing meanings of stability of sensory-movement reaction. At the same time, the more improvement meanings of throughput of the visual analyzer are showed in athletes with an average level of motivation to achieve. CONCLUSION: Were revealed the states of relative comfort, desire to act, advance and find support in wrestlers of high-level motivation to achieve. But the low level of motivation to achieve related with a decline of capability and appearance of discomfort.\n\nO13 Review of qualitative studies analyzing bullying and harassment in sport: methods and research areas\n\nJolita Vveinhardt, Vilija B. Fominiene, Laima Jeseviciute-Ufartiene\n\nFaculty of Sports Education, Lithuanian Sports University, Kaunas, Lithuania\n\nCorrespondence: Vilija B. Fominiene (vilija.fominiene@lsu.lt)\n\nEach research area has its own specificity, and sport is unique due to the expression of aggression among sports participants. Despite a rather broad analysis of this area, there is still a lack of knowledge in discussing the phenomenon of bullying and harassment as an expression of aggression in sport, and this may be due to methods used in research. PURPOSE: Having systematized the qualitative studies on bullying and harassment in a sport as well as their selected qualitative research methodologies, to discuss the research areas of bullying and harassment. METHODS: The PRISMA method was used to select the target articles. Content analysis method was chosen for analyzing the results of the selected articles. RESULTS: For qualitative analysis, 23 scientific articles that met the eligibility criterion were selected. The qualitative content analysis of these articles revealed a variety of research elements in them, thus resulting in various research outcomes. CONCLUSION: Research results were divided into research areas: bullying and harassment as an object of cognition, the environment of bullying and harassment; bullying and harassment related to gender or age, bullying and harassment as a ritual for new team members; bullying and harassment prevention.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nFunded by the European Social Fund according to the activity ‘Improvement of researchers’ qualification by implementing world-class R&D projects of Measure No. 09.3.3-LMT-K-712.\n\nO14 Peer violence in grass-roots sports clubs – coaches’ perspective\n\nBorislav Obradovic, Ivana Milovanovic, Roberto Roklicer, Nebojsa Maksimovic\n\nFaculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, Serbia\n\nCorrespondence: Borislav Obradovic (boriscons@yahoo.com)\n\nThe research is a part of project Sport against violence and exclusion funded by the Erasmus + Sport 2017 Program, which seeks to prevent peer violence and social exclusion through physical activity. PURPOSE: The paper presents results of focus-group discussion conducted with coaches in relation to recognition and prevention of peer violence among children in grass-roots sports clubs. METHODS: Focus-group discussion with coaches was conducted at the Faculty of Sport and Physical Education in Novi Sad. RESULTS: Participants emphasized that cases of social exclusion and violence among children are more an exception rather than an occurrence. However, they described cases of violence in details, pointing out that children and youth are surrounded by violence in society (at school, on the streets, in media, social networks). They also pointed out the misunderstanding in communication with parents, who interfere \"too much\" to coaches' work. They also emphasized the fact that parents of violent children do not admit that their children have committed violence, which is a major issue in the process of mediation between violent and \"victim\" child. CONCLUSION: Coaches believe that Faculties of Sports should somehow find a way and organize education of coaches, parents, and children in order to recognize and prevent violence. This kind of education would be a useful starting point in solving this challenging social issue.\n\nO15 “Governing” social exclusion and violence in the field of youth sport\n\nIvana Milovanovic, Zoran Milosevic, Dejan Madic, Darinka Korovljev, Patrik Drid\n\nFaculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, Serbia\n\nCorrespondence: Ivana Milovanovic (i.a.milovanovic@gmail.com)\n\nThe first part of the paper represents a summary of National Policies and Strategies which address the issue of Social Exclusion and peer violence in Serbia. The second part is an overview of Regulation of training, education, and employment of Sports Coaches, who work with children and youth in grass-roots sports clubs in Vojvodina. PURPOSE: To examine what policies and strategies are in place in Serbia and implementation of those documents by a government and civil sector organizations. By mapping coaches' educational background, the authors emphasized the need for higher education of coaches, with a special need to educate them in the field of prevention of social exclusion and violence among children. METHODS: The data were obtained mostly via online research. Authors conducted additional field research in a form of separate questionnaires delivered to specific national and local government bodies and sports clubs and federations, for the purpose of mapping the coaches on the ground. RESULTS: The strategies and policies which address the issue of social exclusion and violence among children and youth are in place. However, their full implementation hasn't seen as a priority on the ground. CONCLUSION: Social exclusion and peer violence should be addressed more intensive in terms of academic curricula for coaches and professors of PE and on the ground through prevention, recognition, and regulation of this negative social phenomenon.\n\nO16 Benchmarks to consider in terms of fitness profile of young volleyball players\n\nSuncica Pocek, Dusko Cvijovic, Tatjana Trivic, Zoran Milosevic\n\nFaculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, Serbia\n\nCorrespondence: Suncica Pocek (suncicapocekfsfv@gmail.com)\n\nPURPOSE: To examine the fitness profile of young female club volleyball players in terms of age categories and player specialization. METHODS: Thirty-five volleyball players were assessed for height, mass, spike reach, block reach, and body composition. Vertical jump, standing broad jump, spike and block jump was chosen as a measure of leg power. The running speed of players was evaluated with a 20 m sprint effort. The change of direction speed was evaluated with a T-test, Sprint 93639 m forward – backward and Sprint 93639 m with 1800 turns. Two-way ANOVA with LSD post hoc test was applied in order to examine statistically significant differences between team A (18.23 ± 1.71 years) and team B (14.38 ± 0.56 years), between positions and their interaction. RESULTS: Team A players demonstrated better performance in all conducted tests of motor abilities in comparison to young female players of Team B. According to the position in most of the motor tests applied there were no differences between players. CONCLUSION: Establishing comparative fitness measures by competition level and player position should help to create benchmarks by which incoming and current athletes can assess performance.\n\nO17 A low dose of caffeinated coffee doesn’t increase fat oxidation but decreases RPE during aerobic exercise\n\nKarayigit Raci, Sahin Nese, Ersoz Gulfem\n\nFaculty of Sport Sciences, Ankara University, Turkey\n\nCorrespondence: Karayigit Raci (racikarayigit@hotmail.com)\n\nCaffeine has been shown to stimulate fat metabolism during exercise, but there is a scarce evidence investigating the effects of low dose caffeine. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of two different (1.5 – 3 mg/kg) low doses of caffeinated coffee on fat oxidation during low intensity exercise METHODS: Fourteen female volunteers (age 21.2 ± 2.4 years; BMI 28.7 ± 3.4 kg/m2; VO2max 42.2 ± 3.7 ml/min/kg) participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Following to VO2max test, participants were submitted to either decaffeinated coffee (PLA) or very low dose caffeinated coffee (VLCOF) equal to 1.5 mg/kg or low dose caffeinated coffee (LCOF) equal to 3 mg/kg before 45 min to %50 Wattmax exercise (30 min) during which expired air was analyzed. Fat oxidation, RPE, heart rate, glucose, lactate, and RPE were measured at different time point throughout the test protocol. RESULTS: Fat oxidation, RPE, heart rate, glucose, lactate didn’t differ between trials (p>0.05) but LCOF significantly decreased RPE values compared to PLA and VLCOF trials (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Results of this study showed that a low dose of caffeinated coffee may decrease RPE during low-intensity exercise. To increase fat oxidation during exercise may require to intake higher dose of caffeine. Future studies should investigate the effects of a moderate dose of caffeinated coffee on substrate oxidation during low and high-intensity aerobic exercise.\n\nO18 Effects of the group exercise program on the morphological status of female university students\n\nNebojsa Cokorilo¹, Milena Mikalacki¹, Milan Cvetkovic¹, Goran Dimitric1, Sasa Pantelic²\n\n1Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, Serbia; ²Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Nis, Serbia\n\nCorrespondence: Nebojsa Cokorilo (cokorilon@gmail.com)\n\nPURPOSE: The objective of the research was to determine the effects of the “Body Workout” group exercises on morphological characteristics of female university students. METHODS: The sample of research participants was made up of female university students from the Faculty of Sports and Physical Education in Novi Sad that were actively included in the workout program. The total sample participating in the research comprised of 52 participants, 25 of which comprised the experimental group (22.11±0.89 years; 58.72±7.71 kg; 166.11±5.01 cm) while the remaining 27 of them comprised the control group (22.45±0.78 years; 61.51±9.21 kg; 169.51±5.04 cm). The experimental group followed the “Body Workout” model and the control group followed the regular curriculum for the university course of Fitness. RESULTS: According to the research results, significant effects were determined in the transformation of morphological characteristics among the members of the experimental group on the level of the entire system and the individual differences could be perceived in the final measuring in variables Circumference of the lower leg and Skinfolds between the members of the experimental group. CONCLUSION: It was determined that the experimental program of aerobic exercises produced the greatest effects on the reduction in subcutaneous fatty tissue.\n\nO19 The influence of pre-adolescent physical activity over trait of emotional intelligence, optimism, and pessimism\n\nAlexandru Boncu (alexandru.boncu@e-uvt.ro)\n\nFaculty of Physical Education and Sport, West University of Timisoara, Romania\n\nAbout 13% to 20% of youth suffer from mental health disorders at least once in a lifetime. Although previous studies have explored the relationship between physical activity and mental health, little is known about the relationship between psychological factors leading to mental health problems and physical activity in pre-adolescents. PURPOSE: First objective was to compare two groups of pre-adolescents (engaged in organized weekly physical activity vs. not engaged in organized weekly physical activity) on a set of trait emotional intelligence factors (emotionality, well-being, self-control, sociability) and expectation for the future (optimism, pessimism). The second objective was to see the variance explained by physical activity on the same set of variables. METHODS: Five hundred and twelve pre-adolescents (55.9% of boys) participated in the study. Participants were asked to complete a series of questionnaires along with the question: Are you involved weekly in an organized physical activity? RESULTS: We found statistically significant differences in all variables analyzed between the group engaged in organized weekly physical activity compared to the group without physical activity practice. Physical activity explained the variance of several variables: emotionality, well-being, optimism, pessimism. CONCLUSION: Physical activity has proved to be an important factor not only directly for mental health problems but also indirect for psychological factors important for mental health.\n\nO20 Catastrophizing pain, disability, and depression in patients with chronic low back pain\n\nElena Sirbu1, Roxana-Ramona Onofrei2, Ana-Maria Vutan1\n\n1Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, West University of Timisoara, Romania; 2Faculty of Medicine, “Victor Babes” University of Medicine and Pharmacy of Timisoara, Romania\n\nCorrespondence: Elena Sirbu (elena_sarbu@yahoo.co.uk)\n\nChronic low back pain (CLBP) is defined as low back pain lasting more than 12 weeks affecting more than 50% of the general population. It is estimated that more than 70% of the population experience at least one episode of lower lumbar pain, at a certain moment of life. PURPOSE: The main purpose of this study was to investigate the pain intensity, identify the disability and depression levels in patients with chronic back pain and to correlate these variables. METHODS: 20 patients with CLBP completed the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Visual Analog Scale, the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire and Beck's Depression Inventory. The associations among pain intensity, disability, depression and catastrophizing were done by using MedCalc Statistical Software 17.9.7. RESULTS: The mean age of patients included in this study was 42 ± 9.14 and the mean disease duration (years) – 2.1 ± 1.62. The majority (70 %) of the participants were low catastrophizing to pain with low-intensity pain, disability and depression levels. Increased levels of catastrophic thinking to pain correlate significant with disability levels (r= 0.5, p=0.02) and depression intensity (r=0.71, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: A multidisciplinary approach is needed for patients with CLBP and should include physical, mental and social evaluation in order to offer an optimal treatment.\n\nO21 Physiological demands of junior soccer players of three different positional roles\n\nMarko Erceg, Sasa Krstulovic, Goran Kuvacic\n\nFaculty of Kinesiology, University of Split, Croatia\n\nCorrespondence: Goran Kuvacic (gorkuv@kifst.hr)\n\nPURPOSE: This investigation aimed to evaluate the physiological demands of junior (U-19) soccer players of three different positional roles. METHODS: Junior soccer players (body height 181.9 cm; body weight 75.1 kg; BMI 22.7 kg/m2) were categorized in three positional roles as follows: midfielders (n=8), defenders (n=8), and attackers (n=6). For this study, several physiological parameters were assessed during and after the incremental exercise test. ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer Unequal N HSD posthoc test was used to determinate differences between team positions. RESULTS: The differences in the heart rate values at VO2max between the midfielders and defenders were statistically significant (p <0.05) as well as between the midfielders and the attackers. Midfielders had significantly higher values of relative VO2max (65.63±3.58 ml/min/kg) than defenders (62±5.06 ml/min/kg). The midfielders had higher values in all ventilation parameters assessed when compared to defenders and attackers. We found these differences between midfielders and the attackers in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1; p <0.05). Furthermore, differences between the same groups exist in peak expiratory flow (PEF; p <0.01). Also, defenders had higher values when compared to attackers in PEF (p <0.05). No differences were found in resting and blood lactate 1-min after between observed groups. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with previous research. Given the specificity of their position, midfielders have higher values of ventilation and spiroergometric parameters as expected.\n\nO22 Working in sports organizations: contemporary sociological perspectives and issues\n\nTea Gutovic1, Renata Relja2, Toni Popovic2\n\n1Faculty of Economics, University of Split, Croatia; 2Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Split, Croatia\n\nCorrespondence: Tea Gutovic (tgutovic@gmail.com)\n\nSociology understands sport as a social phenomenon influenced by and influencing various social structures as well as shaping the lives of individuals involved in sports activities. There is almost no person in the modern world that is not somehow connected to the sports industry, as an active participant, player, coach, manager, or as a passive observant, consumer, part of the crowd. PURPOSE: To analyze working in the sport on a micro and macro sociological level, considering aspects of social structure and identity formation. METHODS: We systematically reviewed existing literature and research about the sports industry, sociology of work, entrepreneurship and education. Using the descriptive research method of the key theoretical concepts and empirical results in these disciplines, we constructed specific perspective of sport as a form of work in post-industrial society following its basic principles of flexibility, change, and innovation. RESULTS: On a macro level, working in a sports organization should be considered as a specific profession, within the duality of structure that both empowers and constraints it. On a micro level, we consider the processes of shaping athletic and coach identity and their mutual interactions. CONCLUSION: We argue that sport has to be investigated as a form of entrepreneurship and sports identity formed based on the factors of entrepreneurial culture.\n\nO23 Differences in strength dimensions between students of kinesiology and students of mathematics\n\nJosip Cvenic (jcvenic@foozos.hr)\n\nFaculty of Education, Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Croatia\n\nPrescribing training intensity and volume is a key problem when designing resistance training programs. PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to determine the differences between students of kinesiology and students of mathematics with respect to gender in some dimensions of strength. METHODS: The sample consisted of 50 students of kinesiology from Faculty of education (37 males age 20.10±1.72; BH 181.8±6.0; BW 78.03±10.11 and 13 females age 19.07±1.25; BH 167.6±9.24; BW 59.92±7.82) and 62 students from the Department of mathematics (31 males age 18.92±0.67; BH 178.50±6.46; BW 78.43±22.24 and 31 females age 18.6±0.56; BH 165.9±7.2 and BW 60.56±10.49). As a measurement of muscle strength, a sample of variables was comprised of five tests: 1 RM bench press (1RMBP), 1 RM squat (1RMS) and 1-minute sit-up test (1SU), relative bench press (RBP=1 RMBP/BW) and relative squat (RS=1 RMS/BW. The basic descriptive parameters were calculated and the t-test was used for determining the difference between the observed variables. RESULTS: The significance of differences between the groups and gender was observed in all variables (p<0.00). CONCLUSION: The findings may contribute to a better understanding of the factors responsible for strength in the population of athletes (students of kinesiology) and non-athletes (students of mathematics), i.e. they may be useful to PE teachers to help in the planning the best program and training load distribution for their students.\n\nO24 Gender differences in unilateral horizontal drop jump performance in children\n\nMarijo Bakovic, Sanja Ljubicic, Ljubomir Antekolovic\n\nFaculty of Kinesiology, University of Zagreb, Croatia\n\nCorrespondence: Marijo Bakovic (marijo.bakovic@kif.hr)\n\nThere are a lot of studies about human (children and adults) bilateral vertical drop jump performance. On the other hand, there are not enough studies about unilateral horizontal drop jump performance. PURPOSE: To investigate the nature of force-kinetics gender differences during unilateral horizontal drop jump performance in children. METHODS: Forty-nine children (23 boys and 26 girls; age 8 and 9 years) performed 3 trials of unilateral horizontal drop jump performance on take-off leg. Data acquisition was done using a force platform (Quattro Jump 9290CD, Kistler, Switzerland). The height of drop jump was 15 cm, while the distance of the starting point to the middle of the force platform was 110 cm. Maximum force in eccentric and concentric muscle activity, as well as the maximum rate of force development were analyzed using body weight unit of measurement. T-test for the independent samples was used to calculate the statistical significance of gender differences. RESULTS: Although boys produced slightly higher maximum force in eccentric and girls in concentric muscle activity, the differences were not statically significant. The maximum rate of force development also showed no statistical difference. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed no gender differences in force-kinetics variables between 8- and 9-year old children during unilateral horizontal drop jump performance. In further studies, it should be analyzed in older children closer to puberty.\n\nO25 Reliability of newly developed tests of pre-planned and non-planned agility for older persons: a pilot study\n\nIvan Peric1, Miodrag Spasic2, Damir Sekulic2\n\n1Faculty of Dental Medicine and Health, Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Croatia; 2Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Split, Croatia\n\nCorrespondence: Ivan Peric (iperic@fdmz.hr)\n\nStudies in the field of agility have identified two different forms of agility, pre-planned-agility (PPA) and non-planned-agility (NPA). PURPOSE: The aim of this research was to examine the reliability of newly constructed tests of reactive and pre-planned agility for elderly persons. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers (6 women and 4 men; age 61.10 ± 4.4 years; body height 166.90 ± 7.82 cm; body weight 77.63 ± 12.19 kg) participated in this pilot study throughout test-retest study design. Respondents were tested on newly constructed tests of reactive and pre-planned agility twice over two days. Tests involved several stop-and-go movement patterns with (for NPA), or without (for PPA) reaction to visual stimuli. RESULTS: The reliability of the PPA test was high (Intraclass correlation: 0.83; Coefficient of variation: 3%), while the reliability of NPA test was somewhat lower but still acceptable (Intraclass correlation: 0.52; Coefficient of variation; 6%). Pearson's correlation between PPA and NPA was numerically low (r = 0.51, p = 0.19) indicating that reactive- and pre-planned-agility should be observed as independent qualities sharing less than 25% of the common variance. CONCLUSION: The results of this pilot study indicated appropriate reliability of newly developed PPA and NPA tests.\n\nO26 Attitudes of pre-service teachers on the acquisition of competencies for teaching physical and health education\n\nBiljana Trajkovski, Petra Pejic Papak, Tena Pejcic\n\nFaculty of Teacher Education in Rijeka, University of Rijeka, Croatia\n\nCorrespondence: Biljana Trajkovski (biljana.trajkovski@uniri.hr)\n\nThe task of the course Kinesiological Methodics is to introduce the students, future teachers, to the legalities within the physical and health care area and to train them for practical, a creative performance of the teaching process and other processes of physical exercise with the pupils. The aim of this research was to examine the attitudes on the acquisition of competencies and the students' satisfaction with the teaching of Kinesiological Methodics during the studies as well as their opinion on their qualification for carrying out the teaching of primary education classes. A questionnaire was conducted on a sample of 136 students enrolled at the Faculty of Teacher Education. The results point to the pre-service teachers' attitude that the knowledge gained in the courses of Kinesiological Methodics will be helpful in their future occupation (F = 7.37, p <0.05). However, they also stated the importance of continuous training upon the completion of the studies (F = 5.56, p <0.05). It is concluded that the pre-service teachers show the tendency of satisfaction increase with the teaching of Kinesiological Methodics in senior years of study, but at the same time it is concerning that in more senior years of study there appears to exist a decrease in the self-assessment of their own competence for performing the teaching of primary education classes.\n\nO27 Relations between motor skills and health-related quality of life at 7-8 years old children\n\nSzabolcs Halasi1, Josip Lepes1, Visnja Djordjic2, Damjan Jaksic2, Ferenc Ihasz3, Robert Papp1, Nevenka Zrnzevic4, Andrea Zivkovic-Vukovic5\n\n1Hungarian Language Teacher Training Faculty in Subotica, University of Novi Sad, Serbia; 2Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, Serbia; 3Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Pecs, Hungary; 4Teacher Training Faculty, University of Pristina-Kosovska Mitrovica, Serbia; 5Faculty of Education, University of Novi Sad, Serbia\n\nCorrespondence: Szabolcs Halasi (sabolc.halasi@magister.uns.ac.rs)\n\nHypokinesia has a negative impact on motor skills, self-confidence, well being, friendly relations, and academic achievement. PURPOSE: The aim of the research was to characterize the relations between Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and motor skills at early school age children in Northern Serbia. METHODS: The study included 214 children (113 boys, 101 girls) aged 7-8 years. Stratified random sampling was used in this cross-sectional study. Measuring HRQOL was with parent version of Kidscreen-27 questionnaire and evaluating the motor skills was with Test of Gross Motor Development-2 which was for the first time used in Serbia. RESULTS: With Spearman’s rank correlation significant positive relations of HRQOL domains, Physical Well-being (r=0.44; p≤0.01), Psychological Well-being (r=0.31; p≤0.01), School Environment (r=0.29; p≤0.01) with Locomotor subtest and positive correlation between Gross Motor Quotient with domain, Physical Well-being (r=0.31; p≤0.01) at boys, were established. CONCLUSION: Boys who achieved better results on tests of motor skills are physically more active, full of energy, enjoy life, emotionally balanced and feel better at school.\n\nO28 Effects of isoinertial training on the physical fitness of junior basketball players\n\nMarko DM Stojanovic1, Jana Izovska2, Mladen Mikic1, Bogdan Belegisanin1, Aleksandar Karac1, Vuk Stevanovic1,3\n\n1Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, Novi Sad, Serbia; 2Faculty of Physical Education and Sport, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic; 3Institute for Medical Research, University of Belgrade, Serbia\n\nCorrespondence: Marko DM Stojanovic (marko.ns.stojanovic@gmail.com)\n\nPURPOSE: The aim of this research was to determine the effects of an 8-week isoinertial training on the physical fitness of young basketball players. METHODS: Twenty-four male junior basketball players, (17.58±0.50 years) were divided into experimental (ECC; n=12) and control group (CON; n=12) which took strength training exercises on isoinertial training device and classic isodynamic strength training with free weights, respectively. During the experimental program, the ECC and CON groups had 12 equal-volume strength training sessions. A two-way analysis of variance was used to test the effects of isodynamic and isoinertial strength training on physical fitness. RESULTS: The findings revealed that isoinertial training brought about significantly better results in the squat jump (SJ), Countermovement jump (CMJ) and vertical jump (VJ), as well as in the 5m sprint test and agility tests (T-test and 505 test). No statistically significant differences were found in isometric strength and 20m run. CONCLUSION: In comparison with the traditional isodynamic training, isoinertial training proved superior in developing young basketball players explosive strength, speed and agility and likely should be regarded as a preferred method of strength training.\n\nO29 Female athletes in super league of Serbia: degree of athlete's satisfaction, the motivation for sports and competitive anxiety\n\nJovana Trbojevic1, Jelica Petrovic2\n\n1Matica Srpska, Novi Sad, Serbia; 2Department of Psychology, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Novi Sad, Serbia\n\nCorrespondence: Jovana Trbojevic (jovana.trbojevic88@gmail.com)\n\nAthlete's satisfaction, the motivation for sports and competitive anxiety play an important role in sports achievement. PURPOSE: Determining the degree of athlete's satisfaction, the motivation for sports and competitive anxiety of female athletes who participate at the highest sports level in Serbia. METHODS: Thirty-six female athletes (handball players=12; volleyball players=11, soccer players=13) who participate at the highest sports level in Serbia (age: 16-27), completed Athlete's Satisfaction Questionnaire, Sport Motivation Scale-2 (dimensions: intrinsic/integrated motivation; extrinsic/introjected motivation; identified motivation and motivation), Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (dimension: somatic and cognitive anxiety). RESULTS: Descriptive statistics show that female athletes achieve above theoretical average scores on athlete’s satisfaction (Mean=19.4), intrinsic/integrated motivation (Mean=18.33), identified motivation (Mean=10), somatic anxiety (Mean=12.94), and cognitive anxiety (Mean=13.69). Results of ANOVA show that there are significant differences between female handball, volleyball and soccer players in satisfaction (F(2.34)=3.608, p=0.039), intrinsic/integrated motivation (F(2.35)=4.016, p=0.027) and identified motivation (F(2.35)=4.192, p=0.024). Post hoc, Turkey HSD test shows that female soccer players are significantly more intrinsically motivated to do sports that handball players. On the other hand, female handball players are more satisfied then volleyball players. CONCLUSION: These results contribute to the theoretical and practical knowledge of elite female players and their individual dispositions have a significant role in sports results and the development of the sports itself.\n\nO30 Skeletal muscle tensiomyography: results from childhood to late adulthood\n\nBostjan Simunic, Rado Pisot\n\nScience and Research Centre Koper, Institute for Kinesiology Research, Slovenia\n\nCorrespondence: Bostjan Simunic (bostjan.simunic@zrs-kp.si)\n\nTensiomyography is a noninvasive method to assess skeletal muscle mechanical contractile properties. PURPOSE: While there are numerous data on the fiber type composition of skeletal muscle in adults, little is known about the changes in fiber type composition and contractile properties in muscles during maturational growth. Furthermore, master athletes (MA) maintain high levels of physical activity during aging and are a unique population to study intrinsic aging. METHODS: Using tensiomyography we measured contraction time (Tc) in vastus lateralis (VL), gastrocnemius medialis (GM) and biceps femoris (BF) in children (N=107), adult nonathletes (N=379) and MA (N=327). Children were longitudinally followed for 6 yearly assessments, while adults were assessed in a cross-sectional design. RESULTS: Children had higher myosin heavy chain 1 proportion than adults until they reached 10 years. Children that were regularly involved in sport had lower BF Tc than sedentary children, but only after the age of 12, (13%; p<.001) and not in VL. In adults, we found age-related slowing of all observed muscles, where endurance MA had the longest Tc than non-athletes, while power MA had the shortest Tc. Furthermore, our data revealed longer Tc in endurance MA than in non-athletes with age, indicating that preferring regular endurance sports activity might accelerate the age-related slowing of skeletal muscles. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the importance of regular sports exercise for skeletal muscle development in childhood and adulthood.\n\nO31 Family and the creation of a child’s physical (body) capital\n\nSasa Pisot1, Rado Pisot1,2\n\n1Science and Research Centre Koper, Slovenia; 2Faculty of Sport, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia\n\nCorrespondence: Sasa Pisot (sasa.pisot@zrs-kp.si)\n\nParent’s role in supporting a child in the physical activity (PA) appears to be very important from the point of creation of an \"embodied cultural capital\" or physical (body) capital that begins at birth and lasts during all the processes of socialization. PURPOSE: From the point of physical capital’s accumulation, parent’s support and (non)engagement of parents in the child’s PA and his motor efficiency was examined in the frame of the project “Analyzing fundamental motor pattern, skeletal and muscle adaptation on specific sedentary lifestyle factors amongst 4 and 7-year-old children”. METHODS: Quantitative (questionnaires n = 90, a child’s motor efficiency test battery) and qualitative (n = 60 semi-structured interviews) analysis were carried out with parents and children. RESULTS: Four different groups on children's motor efficiency and family lifestyle showed that family praxis depending on many factors, including the socioeconomic status of the family and parent's \"time free from economic necessity\". CONCLUSION: Non-engagement of parents in the child’s PA could be treated as a lost time which gives even greater responsibility to parents to provide time for accumulation of body capital. Mothers are most likely the parent which ensure expected healthy family lifestyle. Since providing healthy nutrition for children falls within the mandate of maternity, the PA of children still mostly remains in the domain of fathers.\n\nO32 The factors of engaging in the hiking section as a sports recreation activity in high school\n\nIvan Vrbik, Andrea Vrbik, Mirna Andrijasevic\n\nFaculty of Kinesiology, University of Zagreb, Croatia\n\nCorrespondence: Ivan Vrbik (ivan.vrbik@gmail.com)\n\nPURPOSE: Managing and understanding the mechanisms underlying enrollment of students in extra-curricular activities could alleviate teacher’s (i.e. expert’s) approach to the students and facilitate their engagement in mentioned activities. Therefore, the main goal of this paper was to establish the factors influencing the choice of enrolling in the particular extra-curricular hiking section as a recreational activity. METHODS: The study was conducted on a sample of 40 high school students (15.3±0.66 years old). Anthropometrical variables (body height, body weight, BMI, body fat, and body muscle) were measured and students completed a short recreational preference questionnaire. Frequency tables were calculated for asked questions and after comparative analyses were made. Correlation between variables was done to establish the existence of significant correlations. RESULTS: Results show a negative correlation (r=-0.42; p<0.05) between attending PE classes and body fat and relatively high correlation (r=0.63; p<0.05) between attending PE classes and preference to outdoor activities, namely hiking. According to the results of correlation, the greatest influence on the interest to join hiking section have students' preference for outdoor activities (r=0.43; p<0.05). CONCLUSION: An increase in the outdoor time expenditure, firstly initiated by PE teachers (and hopefully later adopted as a way of frequent independent recreational and leisure time activity) could be the spot-on strategy for the increase in physical activity levels in school-aged children during after school hours.\n\nO33 “Sports School” 30 years old kinesiology model - a connection between science and practice\n\nDusan Stupar1, Dejan Madic2, Gustav Bala2, Boris Popovic2, Dragan Grujicic3, Dusan Kulic4, Aleksa Madic2\n\n1Faculty of Sport and Tourism, Educons University, Serbia; 2Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, Serbia; 3Sports School, Novi Sad, Serbia; 4Elementary school \"Bratstvo i jedinstvo\", Vrbas, Serbia\n\nCorrespondence: Dusan Stupar (dusan9stupar@gmail.com)\n\nPURPOSE: In recent years, there has been an increasing number of sports schools for children of pre-school and younger school age. This is an important fact because the children are exercising from the earliest ages, in the aim to develop their motoric, functional and psycho-physical abilities. The purpose of this paper is to describe the model, methods, principles and organizational structure of the \"Sports School\". CASE PRESENTATION: \"Sports School“, held at the Faculty of Sport and Physical Education in Novi Sad, has existed for 30 years and it is one of the pioneers of this kind of activity for children. School is an example of a good combination of science and practice. All employees are highly educated professionals. The work program applies modern methods of exercise based on scientific research. These researches have shown that the positive effects on the transformation of certain anthropological dimensions have been achieved at different time points and with different generations of children. CONCLUSION: This model proved to be successful. He can be applied to all sports clubs and schools that work with children of preschool and early school age.\n\nO34 The food and physical activity carousel - a choice for healthy living among Timisoara west university female college students\n\nNicoleta Silvia Mirica, Cerasela Domokos, Martin Domokos, Eugen Bota, Cristian Negrea, Adrian Nagel\n\nFaculty of Sport and Physical Education, West University Timisoara, Romania\n\nCorrespondence: Nicoleta Silvia Mirica (nicoleta.mirica@e-uvt.ro)\n\nGood nutrition and physical activity are the main discussed lifestyle determinant factors. PURPOSE: The evaluation of nutritional and physical activity habits of the West University female students, participants at the general course of sports and physical activity. METHODS: 81 female volunteers (age: 20 ± 0.77 years) filled 2 questionnaires regarding nutrition and physical activity. A comparison with the Romanian guidelines has been performed. RESULTS: The questionnaire focused on monthly consumption of both main food groups and comfort foods and physical activity habits. The data (GraphPad Prism 5.0 and Microsoft-Excel 2007, statistically significance was considered for values of p<0.05) revealed extremely significant differences for all evaluated parameters. For all food groups the results indicated an extremely low monthly consumption comparing to the guidelines (fruit, vegetables/ dairy/comfort food: 22.06 ± 2.12/23.21 ± 2.11/21.32 ± 2.2 vs. 60-150 portions/month, p<0.001; meat and alternatives: 12.73 ± 1.46 vs. 60- 90 portions/month, p<0.001). Physical activity was at one third compared with the guidelines (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The results indicated that youth is not enough to live a healthy life, therefore, is mandatory to tailor great improvements in both nutrition and physical activity in order to remain healthy for a longer period of time.\n\nO35 E-sports: definition and social implications\n\nDino Vukusic1, Marko Marelic2\n\n1Institute of Social Sciences “Ivo Pilar”, Zagreb, Croatia; 2School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, Croatia\n\nCorrespondence: Dino Vukusic (dino.vukusic@pilar.hr)\n\nThe final phase of the gaming industry’s development brought with it another phenomenon – e-sport. “Electronic sport” presupposes playing video games in a competitive setting, with emphasis on increased “institutionalization\" of gaming activity through the organization of e-sports teams and official international competitions. In order to define e-sports, it's important to note that not every activity of playing video games can be described as an e-sport, but every e-sport is essentially playing video games. PURPOSE: This paper aims to present several dimensions of the \"electronic sport\" phenomenon, review the existing research in this field, compare various aspects of e-sports and \"traditional\" sports, and discuss the formation of a new subcultural group gathered around video games. CASE PRESENTATION: The key task of this paper is to examine the distance between e-sports and “traditional” sport and frame the socio-economic scale of the phenomenon. The final part of the paper will concentrate on examining the emergence of gaming culture, primarily through the prism of post subcultural theories. CONCLUSION: The interest in the phenomenon of electronic sport in all social sciences, including sociology, has increased over the past several years and terms and definitions used to describe it are still under construction. Therefore, a theoretical paper clarifying key characteristics is a vital step towards a further scientific upturn in studying e-sport.\n\nO36 Changing trend of motor abilities in professional male and female folk dancers\n\nGoran Oreb1, Meta Zagorc2, Gordana Furjan-Mandic1\n\n1Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Zagreb, Croatia; 2Faculty of Sport, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia\n\nCorrespondence: Goran Oreb (goran.oreb@gmail.com)\n\nFollowing a detailed analysis of motor abilities of professional folk dancers in 2012 (Oreb et al., 2013), the results of certain male and female dancers from the mentioned testing were compared with outcome values from September 1992, December 1992 and July 1993. PURPOSE: To determine the changing trend of motor abilities in male and female professional folk dancers within 20 years. METHODS: The sample of examinees included 6 male dancers (aged between 39 and 54) with between 21 and 33 years of dancing experience, and 9 female dancers (aged between 38 and 55;) with between 21 and 37 years of experience. The results were obtained upon comparing test results from September 1992 (No. 1) – initial testing; December 1992 (No. 2) – transitive testing; July 1993 (No. 3) – final testing, and September 2012 (No. 4) – initial testing. The measured results were analyzed via ‘trend analysis’. RESULTS: It should be emphasized that this analysis evaluated innate motor abilities that first deteriorate with age, but are relevant for dancing a success. The obtained results indicate a stagnation of almost all motor abilities. CONCLUSION: Within the analyzed 20 years, male and female dancers actively participated in the work, where the demands of the stage remained unchanged, while the dancers got older, which poses a chronic problem for training programming.\n\nO37 The evaluation of postural stability during the menstrual cycle in active women\n\nNese F. Sahin, Ozkan Guler, Azize Diedhiou, Gulfem Ersoz\n\nFaculty of Sports Science, University of Ankara, Turkey\n\nCorrespondence: Ozkan Guler (ozkanguler@msn.com)\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated a higher incidence of sports-related injuries among female athletes compared to male counterparts. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the change in static balance ability during the menstrual cycle among young active women. METHODS: The subjects were young active healthy women (n=19, 20.4±1.2 years) with regular exercise and a regular menstrual cycle. Menstrual cycle was divided into 3 phases. early menstrual phase, the follicular phase and mid-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The Biodex SD Balance System was used to determine to static balance ability. Static balance ability was measured by the postural stability index protocol. All subjects were evaluated with their eyes open and double leg without footwear. The subject was asked to step on the platform of the BSS and adopt a comfortable position while maintaining a stand position. To become familiar with postural stability testing on the BBS, subjects performed three practice testing sessions within a week. RESULTS: The results of this study indicate that there were no differences in anterior-posterior sway, medio-lateral sway and postural stability index among three phases in active young woman. CONCLUSION: In the consequence of this study, it has been found that postural stability index has not changed among three phases in active young woman.\n\nO38 Differences in game-related statistics for winning and losing teams related to changes in basketball rules\n\nMladen Mikic1, Igor Vuckovic2, Marko Stojanovic1\n\n1Faculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, Serbia; 2Faculty of Physical Education and Sport, University of Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nCorrespondence: Mladen Mikic (mmmikac@gmail.com)\n\nIn 2014 FIBA has made a change to the official rules to speed up game-pace. The most important change is that after an offensive rebound shot clock shall be reset to 14 seconds. PURPOSE: To determine the differences in game-related statistics before and after changes of basketball rules. METHODS: Data were obtained from official websites of men's 2014 World Cup (38 games) and 2016 Olympic Tournament (76 games). Data consist of 15 parameters, and teams have been separated by success in the game. RESULTS: Winning teams at OT had significantly more ball possessions (p=0.050) and assist (p=0.002) in relation to the winning teams from WC, who had more turnovers (p=0.025). Losing teams at OT in comparison to teams from WC had significantly more ball possessions (p=0.039), successful 2-point shots (p=0.037), defensive rebounds (p=0.004) and unsuccessful free throws (p=0.039). Regardless of success, teams from the OT achieved a significantly higher number of ball possessions (p=0.005), defensive rebounds (p=0.014) and assists (p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Results of the analysis show that after changing the rules number of ball possessions has increased, the game has accelerated. Coaches should select and prepare players to be ready to play faster, for basketball in the future.\n\nO39 Sources of enjoyment and goal orientation among youth fitness members\n\nOkan B. Micoogulları1, Nazif Kutay Erden2, Gunay Yıldızer3\n\n1Physical Education & Sports Department, Nevşehir Hacı Bektaş Veli University, Nevşehir, Turkey; 2Higher Education Council, Ankara, Turkey; 3Sport Science Faculty, Eskişehir Technical University, Eskişehir, Turkey\n\nCorrespondence: Okan B. Micoogulları (okanmicoogullari@gmail.com)\n\nPURPOSE: The objectives of this study were to examine whether there are achievement goal orientation differences regarding enjoyment of and to assess which sources of enjoyment differentiate fitness members of different achievement goal orientation profiles. METHODS: Female (N=28) and male (N=77) fitness members aged 15 to 18 years completed measures sources of enjoyment in sport, and Task and Ego Orientation in Sport. RESULTS: Results of ANOVA revealed that those with high task/high ego, high task/moderate ego and moderate task/low ego profiles have significantly higher levels of enjoyment of fitness as compared to those with low task/moderate ego profiles. Analysis showed that four groups of members could be described by two discriminant functions. High task/high ego group is placed on the positive side of the function “achievement with intrinsic motivation” and they showed the greatest enjoyment of fitness center in other-referenced competency and recognition, effort expenditure, self-referenced competency, and positive parental involvement. Low task/moderate ego group significantly stands out on the positive side of the \"achievement without effort\" function and showed the greatest enjoyment only in other-referenced competency and recognition. CONCLUSION: This research gives an understanding of a conceptual link between achievement goal orientation and sources of enjoyment in fitness members.\n\nO40 Differences in competitive karate athletes within anthropometric characteristics\n\nSandra Vujkov1, Milenko Jankovic2, Zoran Milic1\n\n1College for Vocational Education of Preschool Teachers and Sport Coaches, Subotica, Serbia; 2College for Vocational Education of Preschool Teachers, Novi Sad, Serbia\n\nCorrespondence: Sandra Vujkov (sandravujkov@vsovsu.rs)\n\nContemporary Kata and Kumite disciplines have distinguished competition requirements. Top performance and sporting results in both disciplines are conditioned with a high level of technical performance, and anthropometric predispositions among others. PURPOSE: To investigate differences between Kata and Kumite athletes in chosen anthropometric parameters. METHODS: Forty male international level karate athletes (21 kata; age 21.0 ± 4.1 years; BMI 22.6 ± 1.7 kg/m2 and 19 Kumite athletes age 21.7 ± 3.0 years; BMI 22.7 ± 1.5 kg/m2) participated in cross-sectional study. Overall, 23 anthropometric variables (five longitudinal; four transversal; five circumferences; and nine skinfolds) were taken according to the International Biological Program standards. MANOVA and ANOVA were used to obtain the differences between competitive disciplines, with the significance level set to p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: Kumite athletes showed to be significantly heavier, taller, had longer extremities (p ≤ 0.01) and with more pronounced circumference (p ≤ 0.05). Kata competitors had more pronounced subcutaneous adipose tissue (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Kumite longitudinal dimensionality shows a possibility of reaching opponents from greater distances, and Kata athletes need firm stances with a lower center of gravity. Kumite has additional weighing categories. Greater adipose tissue in kata athletes seems to have no fundamental reflections on performance. Knowledge in findings of athletes' characteristics should be implemented in sports performance planning.\n\nO41 The influence of motor abilities and morphological characteristics on the success in kayaking\n\nNikola Prlenda, Ivor Kajfez, Ivan Oreb, Zoran Spoljaric, Mario Jankovic\n\nFaculty of Kinesiology, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia\n\nCorrespondence: Nikola Prlenda\n\nPURPOSE: Motor abilities and morphological characteristics are some of the main factors influencing the result in professional kayakers. The question is how much are these abilities influencing the results in adult recreational sportsmen, i.e. is the quantity of acquired knowledge in basic rowing technique more important factor in the final test result. METHODS: The research was conducted on a sample of 27 female and 47 male students of the Faculty of Kinesiology in Zagreb. The average age was 21, 86 for female, and 21, 68 years for male students. Predictor variables were morphological characteristics tests and 10 motor abilities tests. As a criterion variable 50-meter sprint test was used. The test was applied after the six-day basic kayak technique learning program (9 hours). RESULTS: Through regression analysis, it was determined that there is no significant influence of morphological characteristics and motor abilities on the success in 50-meter kayak rowing. CONCLUSION: The research hasn't shown a significant correlation of morphological characteristics and motor abilities with the results achieved in kayak 50-meter sprint test, and it can be assumed that the results in the aforementioned test were influenced by the level of achieved rowing technique knowledge. Such result shows also the accessibility of kayaking to the wider population of recreational sportsmen, not only to the physically prepared individuals.\n\nO42 How strongly related are health status and subjective well-being among the employees of the Hungarian National Ambulance Service and the Hungarian Defense Forces?\n\nAttila Pandur, Rajmund Marton, Balint Banfai, Henrietta Banfai-Csonka, Bence Schiszler, Jozsef Betlehem, Balazs Radnai\n\nFaculty of Health Sciences, University of Pecs, Hungary\n\nCorrespondence: Attila Pandur (attila.pandur@etk.pte.hu)\n\nPURPOSE: The increasing social role and responsibility of both the National Ambulance Service (NAS) and the Hungarian Defense Forces (HDF) may impact the workers physical and mental condition, which then affects their work. The purpose of our research was to assess the quality of life of paramedics and soldiers along the factors influencing it. METHODS: The anonymous, self-filled questionnaire used for the cross-sectional study contained EuroQol scale, Beck depression and Briere PTSD questionnaire, SF-36 and analyzed with SPSS 20.0. RESULTS: In the research 98 NAS and 76 HDF personnel participated. The relationship between the years spent in work and the quality of life showed positive results for both groups (p=0.009). The Beck depression questionnaire revealed that NAS workers are more depressed than those who are serving in the HDF (p<0.05). In all dimensions of the SF-36 questionnaire, the paramedics performed worse and those who were workers for more than 11.5 years in both groups rated their quality of life worse (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The respondents have been subjected to increased physical wear, they fall victim to subsequent physical deterioration, mental decline. The risk of all factors will gradually increase with age, as well as with the number of years spent working.\n\nO43 Comparative study on health behavior and burnout of healthcare professionals working in clinical and preventive health care in Hungary\n\nKrisztina Deutsch, Adel Siric\n\nInstitute of Emergency Care and Pedagogy of Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Pécs, Hungary\n\nCorrespondence: Krisztina Deutsch (kriszta.csokasi@freemail.hu)\n\nPURPOSE: Research related to health emphasizes that health care workers appear as role models in their work. The analysis and comparison of health behavior and burnout among health professionals in clinical care and prevention in Hungary. METHODS: The quantitative cross-sectional study was carried out between 01.02.2016 and 30.11.2016. During convenience sampling, 293 health workers were involved in the sample. Data were collected with self-compiled questionnaires including standardized question groups (SF-36, Maslach Burnout Inventory). Data were analyzed with SPSS 20.0 program, descriptive statistical analysis, Chi-square test, two-sample T-test. RESULTS: The health behavior of prevention professionals and clinicians show significant differences in the field of smoking (p=0,003), physical exercise (p=0,003) and the nutritional status (p=0,001). Examining burnout, a significant difference was not found in the incidence of emotional exhaustion between the two groups, however, in case of depersonalization, frequency (p<0,001) and intensity (p=0,046) showed a difference. The frequency of decrease in personal performance did not show a difference between the two groups (p=0,118), while in the case of intensity the difference was significant (p=0,004). CONCLUSION: In the case of the compared factors, prevention professionals had better health behavior. The examination if the incidence of burnout showed a significant increase compared to previous national studies, which calls attention to the importance of prevention and mental health.\n\nO44 Prefrontal cortex oxygenation is more affected by posture than cognitive load in young and older adults\n\nUros Marusic1,2, Rado Pisot1,3\n\n1Science and Research Centre Koper, Slovenia; 2Alma Mater Europaea – ECM, Slovenia; 3Faculty of Sport, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia\n\nCorrespondence: Uros Marusic (Sasa.Pisot@zrs-kp.si)\n\nNormal aging triggers alternations in postural control, from an automatically processed to a more cortically controlled one. PURPOSE: to evaluate a postural-cognitive dual-task paradigm in young and older adults using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). METHODS: Twenty healthy subjects were recruited for this study: ten younger (mean age = 23y) and ten older (mean age = 72y). The oxygenation level of the prefrontal cortex was measured with fNIRS and postural control was monitored at the same time using a force plate during four different conditions: normal quite stance and tandem position in both, normal and in dual-task conditions. RESULTS: Cognitive task while standing was better performed in the younger adults, who gave more correct answers in both dual-task conditions (p<0.05) while there was no difference between either age groups in terms of body sway parameters (p>0.05) or calculated dual-task effects (p>0.05). Cerebral oxygenation values increased significantly between the single-task stance and single-task tandem (p<0.05), and single-task stance and dual-task tandem (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Even though there was a general lack of aging effect, the better cognitive performance under motor-cognitive conditions in young compared to older adults were observed. The current results point out that prefrontal cortex is influenced more strongly by postural than cognitive load.\n\nO45 Rupture and reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament\n\nAndjelka Knezovic Svetec1,2\n\n1Rehamed Offenbach, Offenbach am Main, Germany; 2Faculty of Kinesiology, University of Zagreb, Croatia\n\nCorrespondence: Andjelka Knezovic Svetec (angela.knezovic.svetec@gmail.com)\n\nOver the last decade, there has been an increase in the number of people who are recreationally or professionally engaged in physical activity. The consequence of an increase in physical activity and sports resulted in the higher number of injuries of the lower extremities, especially knee injuries. The rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a particularly severe injury that can have a negative impact on the level of physical activity and impair quality of life of an individual. ACL rupture can be career-threatening for professional athletes. The surgeons mainly use two types of surgical techniques for reconstructing anterior cruciate ligament, patellar tendon autograft, and hamstring-gracilis tendon autograft. Even though the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery is considered to be a successful procedure, the rate of return to the professional sport after ACL reconstruction is relatively low. The most important goal after ACL surgery is returning athletes to training activity and finally to resume pre-injury fitness level.\n\nO46 Does exercise influence brain chemistry changes in healthy adults? a systematic review\n\nDragana Zanini, Vesna Seper, Dejan Javorac, Valdemar Stajer, Sergej M. Ostojic\n\nFaculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, Serbia\n\nCorrespondence: Dragana Zanini (zadragupsi@yahoo.com)\n\nPURPOSE: Neuroimaging become widely used, contemporary research tool with the potential to shed light on an old question like does physical exercise can reduce cognitive decline and prevent malfunctioned brain chemistry processes which underlie various age-related diseases? In this review, the focus is put on investigating researches that used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to determine whether, and in what direction, exercise can alter healthy brain metabolites? METHODS: Search is conducted in databases “PubMed” and “Cochrane Library\" using keywords \"magnetic resonance spectroscopy\" AND \"exercise\" AND \"healthy adults\" Search was restricted to articles published in the English language in 10 last years and conducted on humans. RESULTS: Following criteria, it was extracted 13 studies. After the vigorous acute bout, results indicate increased brain lactate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Results are inconsistent considering N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and glutamate-glutamine (Glx) level. Findings of this review indicate insignificance alteration of NAA level if measured in occipital cortex, in contrast to an increased level in frontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. Although there is a notion that exercise has widespread effects on the brain, a specific region of interest (ROI) could be more sensitive to neurometabolites changes than global measures. CONCLUSION: Due to a small number of studies, with different methodologies, there is no definitive conclusion toward the question of the impact of physical activity on brain chemistry in healthy adults.\n\nO47 Is the smartphone app accurate enough for static posture analysis?\n\nDrazenka Macak, Dragan Marinkovic, Aleksa Madic, Nikola Andric, Nebojsa Trajkovic\n\nFaculty of Sport and Physical Education, University of Novi Sad, Serbia\n\nCorrespondence: Nebojsa Trajkovic (nele_trajce@yahoo.com)\n\nThe accurate description of body posture represents a topic of interest for the scientists. Due to the fact that most reliable methods are expensive and often reserved for clinical or laboratory use, it is necessary to found low-cost photographic methods of assessing standing posture with satisfactory reliability. PURPOSE: The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the validity and reliability of smartphones/tablets apps for assessing standing posture. METHOD: PubMed, Scopus, and SportDiscus databases were used to perform this study. The following keywords were used: Posture, mobile touch screen devices, application, reliability, validity. Two reviewers independently screened the articles, extracted relevant data and assessed the methodological quality of included studies. RESULTS: A total of 124 articles were screened for eligibility with 12 articles finally included for review. The current literature contains numerous limitations and lack of consistency for reliability. CONCLUSION: Although several studies showed mobile touch screen devices are valid and reliable, many factors have to be taken into account before it can be considered for wider use. Moreover, further research is warranted in order to develop guidelines for wise use of apps. Nevertheless, photographic-based apps showed one strong advantage, they provide a permanent and printable record of measurement.\n\nO48 Postural stability in people with and without patellofemoral pain\n\nDragan Marinkovic, Borislav Obradovic, Darinka Korovljev\n\nFaculty of Sport and Physical Education, "
