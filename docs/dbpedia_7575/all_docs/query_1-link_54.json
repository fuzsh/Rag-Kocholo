        "text": "The record-breaking heatwave looks set to continue for at least another week over large parts of Europe, forcing authorities to take drastic measures to cope with heatwaves and new wildfires. And Croatia is also seeing temperatures rise to the mid-thirties.\n\nThe south, east and west of Europe have recorded the highest temperatures in this summer’s heatwave. In Italy on Sunday, a red alert was issued for 16 cities across the country, and temperatures are expected to reach 36/37°C from Rome to Bologna before the peak of the heatwave at the beginning of next week.\n\n\"It's an oven. We can't stay in one place for too long,\" said Veronika Niederlovi, a 16-year-old Czech tourist who came to visit Rome, speaking to AFP on Saturday morning.\n\nIn Germany, the highest temperatures on Saturday were recorded in the Bavarian town of Möhrendorf-Kleinseebach (38.8 degrees).\n\nGreece is also suffering from the heatwave, leading authorities to close the Acropolis in Athens during the hottest hours on Sunday for the third consecutive day, as temperatures in the country exceeded 41°C.\n\nAnd Croatia is also facing boiling temperatures, with highs expected to be in the mid-thirties all next week. The Croatian State Hydro Meteorological Institute stated be prepared for the health risks associated with heat and high temperatures, especially for sensitive populations, primarily the elderly and young children."
