        "text": "Paris saw a record high temperature of 42.6C (108.7F) on Thursday, amid a heatwave that broke records across Western Europe.\n\nA red alert - the highest level - was issued in northern France.\n\nMeanwhile Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands also reached new record highs, of 41.8C, 41.5C, 40.8C and 40.7C respectively.\n\nThe UK recorded a record temperature for July of 38.1C, with trains told to run more slowly to stop rails buckling.\n\n\"Climate change has increased the likelihood and severity of heatwave episodes across Europe,\" the UK's national weather service said.\n\nIn France, officials warned people to avoid travelling to work from home if possible. Some nurseries have been closed.\n\nThe chief architect responsible for restoring Notre-Dame warned that the extreme heat could lead to the cathedral's roof collapsing if the joints and masonry holding up the roof dried out.\n\nFrench reports suggested five deaths may have resulted from the high temperatures.\n\nComparisons were drawn to a heatwave in August 2003 which contributed to almost 15,000 deaths in the country.\n\nThe Met Office conducted a study last year that found that the UK was now 30 times more likely to experience heatwaves, external compared to the year 1750, because of \"the higher concentration of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) in the atmosphere\".\n\nRecords going back to the late 19th Century show that the average temperature of the Earth's surface has increased by about one degree since industrialisation.\n\nA climatology institute in Potsdam, Germany, said Europe's five hottest summers since 1500 were all recorded in the 21st Century.\n\nScientists have expressed concern that rapid warming linked to use of fossil fuels has serious implications for the stability of the planet's climate."
