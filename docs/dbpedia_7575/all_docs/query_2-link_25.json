        "text": "This post is about the weather in January in Barcelona.\n\nAs your tour guide, I bring a wealth of knowledge not just in leading tours but also from my extensive career as a retired meteorologist.\n\nI provide you with precise and detailed weather forecasts for this month to ensure you are fully prepared for whatever weather we might encounter on our journey.\n\nTemperatures are milder than most of northern Europe and the city's attractions are less crowded.\n\nTemperature\n\nClouds and Rain\n\nWhat to Wear\n\nThings to Do\n\nTemperature\n\nDaytime high temperatures will most likely be near 13-14 C (56-57 F) with a few of the warmer days making it up near 16-17 C (low 60s F).\n\nThe record high temperature in Barcelona during January is 19 C (66F).\n\nLate night and early morning low temperatures will likely be around 4-5 C (lower 40s F) with a few of the colder mornings dipping down to near 1 C (33-34 F) with 2 mornings, on average reaching 0 C (32 F) or less.\n\nThe record low temperature in Barcelona during January is -7 C (19F).\n\nClouds and Rain\n\nYou can expect about 17-18 days this month with sunny or at least partly sunny skies.\n\nAbout 5 days record some rainfall, but rain amounts tend to be light.\n\nSnow normally does not fall in Barcelona, however, it can occur on rare occasions in the inland hilly areas around the city.\n\nDaylight\n\nYou can expect about 9.25 hours of daylight on New Year’s Eve increasing to just over 10 hours by the 31st.\n\nWindspeed\n\nDuring January, the wind speed in Barcelona tends to be light, averaging 4-12 mph (6-19 kph) but occasionally can be moderate at 13-18 mph (20-28 kph).\n\nOcean Temps\n\nJanuary is not the best time to be at the beach as the average water temperatures will be around 13-14 C (56-57F).\n\nWhat to wear in Barcelona During January?\n\nJanuary is cold so bring along clothes suitable for early Winter.\n\nWe recommend long-sleeved shirts and tops, as well as a couple of sweaters plus a warm coat or jacket.\n\nAdd a scarf or two and don’t forget some comfortable walking shoes.\n\nThings to Do in Barcelona in January\n\nAlthough it can get cold this time of year, you might still want to consider taking a pay-what-you-wish walking tour in Barcelona.\n\nFootball fans will be happy to know that FC Barcelona usually plays at least a few matches at home this month.\n\nEven if you miss a game, you can typically take a tour of Camp Nou Football Stadium throughout January.\n\nIf you're looking to stay warm indoors, consider going to see some authentic Flamenco dancing at one of the local venues.\n\nThere will be two parades this month: The Three Kings Parade on January 5th and the Tres Tombs Parade in the Sant Antoni neighborhood on the first Saturday after St. Anthony's Day (January 17th).\n\nFor more fun ideas, make sure to read our full post covering things to do in Barcelona in January."
