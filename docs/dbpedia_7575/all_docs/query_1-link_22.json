        "text": "July the 23rd, 2023 – Despite the intense heat we’ve been experiencing, which has been broken up periodically by devastating storms (at least for those of us in Zagreb), the Croatian maximum temperature still hasn’t been reached.\n\nYes, it’s summer. Yes, it’s meant to be hot. But anyone who claims the weather we’ve been experiencing recently to be “normal” must live in a very different reality than most of us. While it has been insufferably hot for a while now, state statistics have revealed something interesting.\n\nAs Darko Bicak/Poslovni Dnevnik writes, the utter misery caused by the intolerable heat followed by extremely violent storms have been a rollercoaster of sorts, some curious statistics from the State Hydrometeorological Institute have shown that this year is not nearly as hot as some of the previous ones we’ve experienced. This means that the Croatian maximum temperature hasn’t been reached this year – yet.\n\nAn analysis\n\nFor this reason, the State Hydro-meteorological Institute created a comparative analysis of the highest temperatures for the largest Croatian cities on July the 18th, 2023, as well as the highest temperature ever recorded on that day since measurements have been taken, that is, for the last 100 or so years, in that area.\n\nAccording to this analysis, the Croatian maximum temperature hasn’t been reached so far this year, and we can see that on July the 18th this year in Zagreb, temperatures of 32.4 degrees Celsius was recorded, and the highest ever measured was 40.4 degrees. This year, Osijek also baked in temperatures of 33.7 °C on that particular day, and their highest ever record was 40.6 °C. Rijeka recorded temperatures of 35.6 °C this week, and the record was 40 °C. According to this measurement, Split was cooking on July the 18th in temperatures of 36.3 °C, while its record is a sweltering 42.2.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nthe fields marked with * are required"
