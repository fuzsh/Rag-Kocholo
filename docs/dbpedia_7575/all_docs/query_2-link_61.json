        "text": "Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands have recorded their highest ever temperatures, in a heatwave searing Western Europe.\n\nThe Belgian town of Kleine Brogel hit 39.9C (102F), the hottest since 1833.\n\nThe southern Dutch city of Eindhoven beat the 75-year-old national record, with a new high of 39.3C.\n\nGermany's weather service said a new record of 40.5C - just 0.2C higher - had been set in Geilenkirchen, near the Belgian and Dutch borders.\n\nThe new German record was still to be confirmed, it said, warning that it could get even hotter on Thursday.\n\nAt least 600 passengers were stuck on the train near the Belgian town of Halle for two hours, with some of the carriages left in the dark inside a tunnel and others outside in the sun.\n\n\"The temperature was sky high. It was very bad,\" Jan Willem Wiersma from Rotterdam told the BBC. \"We're happy to be off the train, where it's 15 degrees less.\"\n\nKris Hoet, who was travelling from Antwerp to London, said he and others had been stuck on the train for two hours before being allowed to get off.\n\nEurostar said the fault was down to an overhead power supply, and it advised people not to travel if possible on Wednesday. Other services between Brussels and Paris were caught up in the breakdown.\n\nThe Dutch record was initially broken with 38.8C at Gilze-Rijen airbase on Wednesday, before a higher temperature was recorded in Eindhoven.\n\nThe hottest areas were in the Dutch province of Brabant and across the Belgian border in the Flemish province of Limburg.\n\nIn Kleine Brogel, the record was broken early in the afternoon at 38.9C but the temperature continued to climb to 39.9C by 17:00 (15:00 GMT).\n\nBelgium has issued a code red weather warning for the whole country.\n\nLinking a single event to global warming is complicated. While extreme weather events like heatwaves occur naturally, experts say these will happen more often because of climate change.\n\nRecords going back to the late 19th Century show that the average temperature of the Earth's surface has increased by about one degree since industrialisation.\n\nA climatology institute in Potsdam, Germany, says Europe's five hottest summers since 1500 have all been in the 21st Century.\n\nScientists are concerned that rapid warming linked to use of fossil fuels has serious implications for the stability of the planet's climate."
