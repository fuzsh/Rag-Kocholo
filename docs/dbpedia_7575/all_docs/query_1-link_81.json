        "text": "The climate of Croatia\n\nClimatologically Croatia can be divided into three parts. The lower coastal areas have a Mediterranean climate with mild and fairly wet winters and dry and warm summers. When you travel further into the interior you directly come across the Dinaric Alps. This mountain range stretches out from north to south along the entire coastline of Croatia. According to many different sources this area also has a Mediterranean climate. However, this is not correct. The higher areas have a continental climate or a moderate maritime climate. According to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification a Dfb climate. Winters are colder and wetter. During the summer temperatures are also slightly lower than in the areas directly along the coast. The eastern part of Croatia bordering Hungary and Yugoslavia is lower and much flatter than the western part of Croatia. This part unmistakably has a moderate continental climate. The sea has little influence here because this region is situated on the leeward side of a mountain range.\n\nClimate information of places and areas in Croatia\n\nThe climate information on this page is only brief. Specific information about weather and climate can be found on the climate pages per area or town. As for Croatia the following climate information is available:\n\nRegions:\n\nGorski Kotar\n\nIstria\n\nNorthern Dalmatia\n\nSouthern Dalmatia\n\nSlavonia (Eastern Croatia) Cities & Islands:\n\nBaska Voda\n\nBrac\n\nBrela\n\nCavtat\n\nDubrovnik\n\nHvar\n\nKorcula\n\nKrk\n\nMakarska\n\nMlini Cities & Islands:\n\nNovigrad\n\nOpatija\n\nOsijek\n\nPag\n\nPlat\n\nPorec\n\nPula\n\nRab\n\nRijeka\n\nRovinj Cities & Islands:\n\nSibenik\n\nSlano\n\nSplit\n\nSupetar\n\nTucepi\n\nUmag\n\nVis\n\nZadar\n\nZagreb\n\nSun destination\n\nCroatia is becoming increasingly popular as a sun destination. During the summer temperatures here can be compared to those on the French Rivièra. However, chances of rain are bigger here than along the Cote dAzur. The beaches and the bright blue sea conjure up associations with the French coast.\n\nPrecipitation\n\nCroatia has high precipitation figures all year round. However, the amount of precipitation that falls depends on the place and the period you are in. Most of the rain and snow falls during autumn and winter. The most eastern tip of the country is the driest part with about 700 millimeters of annual precipitation. The northern part of the Dinaric Alps get more than 2,000 millimeters of annual rain and are among the wettest regions in Europe.\n\nWinter sports and snow\n\nDuring the winter most of the precipitation falls in the form of snow, especially in the mountainous areas. The county of Primorje-Gorski Kotar east of the city of Rijeka has developed into a winter sports area. The pistes are situated at an altitude of 1,500-1,700 meters. Snowfall is not as guaranteed as in the popular winter sports areas in the Alps. However, chances of good skiing and cross country skiing circumstances are reasonably high during the winter.\n\nClimate figures\n\nThe figures below are based on long term climate records and are a global average for the Croatian coastline. Along the coast several differences occur. The northern part is slightly drier than the southern part of the coast. During the summer there are several small differences in air and sea temperatures. The interior is colder and less stable all year round. We offer climate figures on the following places and regions.\n\naverage\n\nmaximum\n\ntemperature (°C)\n\naverage\n\nminimum\n\ntemperature (°C) average\n\nhours of sunshine\n\nper day average days with precipitation\n\nper month average\n\nmm precipitation\n\nper month average\n\nsea\n\ntemperature (°C) January 9 2 2 13 13 February 10 3 3 12 13 March 13 5 5 13 13 April 17 9 7 14 14 May 21 13 8 14 17 June 25 16 9 12 21 July 28 19 10 9 24 August 28 18 10 10 25 September 24 16 8 11 23 October 19 12 6 12 20 November 15 7 4 13 17 December 11 3 3 14 15 = 0-5 mm ● = 6-30 mm ● = 31-60 mm ● = 61-100 mm ● = 101-200 mm ● = over 200 mm\n\n= 0-0.2 inches ● = 0.2-1.2 inches ● = 1.2-2.4 inches ● = 2.5-4 inches ● = 4.1-8 inches ● = over 8 inches\n\nMore climate information\n\nClimate tables are useful but they dont give an overall picture of the climate and possible weather conditions during a period of time. How high the chances are of hot or cold weather or hurricanes can often not be found in these tables. This is why we offer extra climate information per month.\n\nchance of\n\n(very) hotweather\n\nchance of\n\n(very) cool\n\nweather chance of\n\nlong-termprecipitation chance of\n\nhurricanes\n\n(cyclones) chance of\n\nsunny days\n\nUV-index\n\nJanuary February March April May June July August September October November December click here for the explanation of the symbols"
