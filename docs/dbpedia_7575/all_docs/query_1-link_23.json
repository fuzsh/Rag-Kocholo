        "text": "From Corvallis, Oregon. Taken from the official US weather station at Hyslop field:\n\nAve Max: 47.7 (8.7), +0.7 (0.39)\n\nAve Min: 35.1 (1.7), +1.1 (0.61)\n\nPrecipitation, 9.99 inches (253.7mm), +3.68 (93.5)\n\nAn ever so slightly warmer and significantly wetter than average month. We had measurable rain on 28 of 31 days. This included about two and a quarter inches (~57 mm) of sleet and ice mid month.\n\nI was away from that action in southern California but my wife told me this was the worst ice storm in at least 50 years. I was supposed to drive home and arrive on the 15th but snow, sleet and a sheet of glare ice covering the state from Roseburg on north kept me cooling my heels until the 18th. Even then getting home through the aftermath was a real trip - figuratively as well as literally. Our house lost power for only two hours but some sections of the Coast Range and eastern Columbia Gorge were without power for ten days.\n\nIt's been a little over two weeks since and no one is yet sure of the property damage but for all the havoc this thing caused, relatively few people died.\n\nDuring the first half of the month, temperatures were well below average with the thermometer bottoming out at 9 degrees (-12.8) on the 14th. Don't laugh, for us softies in the Willamette Valley that is shockingly cold, the worst since 1974. After the storm, however, we entered a spell of much warmer than average temperatures that continues today (Feb 2). We tied an all time January record maximum of 66 degrees (18.9) on the 29th .\n\nThe numbers may show a wet but otherwise plain vanilla month but it was anything but.\n\nJanuary 2024:\n\nA winter month that ended up being around average, and that is a good thing after having many blowtorch winter months during these past few years.\n\nWe've had only one snowfall this month, with 12.5 cm/5 in of snow - not really impressive, but that's more than we got in all of 2023, and we rarely get over 10 cm of snow these years.\n\nIt also had a record low of -11.5C, a temp that we haven't had since 2018, and it was refreshing to see some proper winter temps.\n\nIt was also sunnier than average. However, the sunshine wasn't distributed equally - 38 hrs till the 19th, and the last 12 days brought clearer weather that bumped up the sun figures.\n\nAll in all a good month in my eyes, considering that our winters are on a strong warming trend.\n\nAlso, it's interesting to see how your geographic position influences the climate.\n\nSplit is 260 km south of Zagreb, and one look at the climate tables reveals how significant the effects of the Mediterranean Sea are.\n\nZagreb monthly anomalies :\n\nHigh: +2.5C/+4.5F\n\nMean: +0.7C/+1.3F\n\nLow: -0.1C/-0.2F\n\nPrecipitation: +18.9 mm/+0.74 in\n\nSunshine: +50 h\n\nSplit monthly anomalies:\n\nHigh: +1.6C/+2.9F\n\nMean: +1.6C/+2.9F\n\nLow: +1.4C/+2.5F\n\nPrecipitation: -9 mm/ -0.35 in\n\nSunshine: +21 h"
