        "text": "Australia experienced a devastating heatwave in December 2023, with temperatures up to 10°C (18°F) above normal. The heatwave caused dozens of bushfires in New South Wales, with Telfer recording the highest temperature of 45°C (113°F) in the country. The Eastern parts of Australia were also affected, with Brisbane reaching 33°C (91°F) and Sydney airport reaching 34°C (93°F). The Bureau of Meteorology has also declared that a positive Indian Ocean Dipole is underway. The Indian Ocean Dipole is another key driver of our weather. We can think of it as the El Niño/La Niña of the Indian Ocean. When we have both an El Niño event and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole, the drying effect can be more widespread across the continent and more pronounced. #india needs to prepare for a harsh summer as well. Stay informed and make sure to take necessary precautions. #climatechange #ElNiñoevent #Australia #heatwave #bushfires\n\nAustralian heat waves just show where we are going very quickly: every year summer peak temperatures increase by up to 1,5C*. You can imagine what will happen with cooling equipment after 10 years. In November, a team of scientists, including from NASA and Columbia University, said the world could cross the 1.5C threshold this decade. I think in critical projects such as data centers, hospitals, all cooling equipment should be equipped with an adiabatic pre-cooling system option, which is able to maintain chiller efficiency by 41% in critical situations. We have good news as well: Smart Cooling Adiabatic pre-cooling systems are designed exactly for air cooled water chillers to protect chillers from overheating and climatechange problems with extreme temperatures. www.smartcooling.us #smartcooling #efficiency #datacentersolutions #datacenter#datacenterinfrastructure #datacenternews #hvac #adiabaticcooling#precooling #coolingsolutions #technews\n\nAustralian heat waves just show where we are going very quickly: every year summer peak temperatures increase by up to 1,5C*.

In the past two weeks, the Mediterranean has warmed significantly, reaching temperatures similar to those of the Caribbean in many areas. The Adriatic Sea, in particular, has reached 30°C in recent days, which is 5 to 6 degrees above average. From the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Ionian Sea to the coast of Libya, water temperatures are currently between 28°C and 30°C. In some places between Cyprus and the southern coast of Turkey, temperatures are even reaching 31°C to 32°C. In contrast, the Balearic and Aegean Seas remain somewhat cooler. The Mistral and Etesian winds typically facilitate better mixing and upwelling of colder deep water in these areas. The continuing inflow of significantly cooler Atlantic water through the Strait of Gibraltar is also clearly recognisable. With the persistent heat, Mediterranean water temperatures are expected to continue rising in the coming days and weeks, with the highest temperatures typically occurring in August. These elevated temperatures threaten the underwater ecosystem, potentially leading to jellyfish population booms that pose risks to fishermen and tourists. Additionally, the region may experience increasing risk for weather extremes in late summer and autumn. Reliable #WeatherData is absolutely essential so that businesses and industries can better prepare for such extreme weather events. Meteomatics provides all the necessary data via the #WeatherAPI - everything you need to prepare your organization.

This is the only area on the European continent that saw forecasts capture over 40% more temperatures and precipitation accurately than persistence did. Most of the rest of the continent saw skill between 30% and 40%, though areas with little variety in daily weather, such as most of the United Kingdom and Ireland, small islands in the Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, and areas of the Mediterranean coast, saw skill of less than 30%. This is because it is tough to have forecasts improve upon daily weather that already does not vary much on a daily basis.
