Number 3579 The Financial Situation HE United States Treasury program of financing was announced this week and proved an unqualified success, as every well-informed person knew beforehand would be the case. It necessarily consisted of the offering of short-term obligations, since prevailing conditions would not admit of longterm financing. The reasons for this latter state of things—the drawbacks against floating long-term issues, except at prohibitive rates of interest—are well understood and lie on the surface. They are the same as those which operated against the placing of a long-term issue in December, when the United States Treasury confined itself to an offering of $950,000,000 (or thereabouts) of one-year Treasury 4% interest. certificates of indebtedness, carrying 21/ certain in quarters time that There had been hopes at that the Secretary of the Treasury would undertake to float some long-term obligations, but to careful observers it was plain that this would have been far from an easy task. The events following Government financing in October, which involved long-term financing, served to make Government officials exceedingly hesitant about indulging in further longterm financing, at least for the time being. The October financing referred to, besides involving the calling for redemption on April 15 1934 of about $1,875,000,000 to $1,900,000,000 of Fourth Liberty Loan bonds,included an offering of 10 to 12-year Treasury bonds in exchange to holders of the Liberty Loan bonds who desired to make the exchange (the new Treasury bonds being dated Oct. 15 1933 and 4% bearing interest from that date at the rate of 41/ per annum until Oct. 15 1934, thus continuing for a full year the 4%70 interest which the Fourth Liberty Loan issue has been receiving, and thereafter at the 4% per annum) contained, in addition to rate of 31/ the exchange proposal, an offer of $500,000,000 of these new Treasury bonds to the general public for 27 1 0—and cash—not at par, but at a premium of 1/ this cash offer proved an overwhelming success, the aggregate of the subscriptions reaching nearly four times the amount of the offering, or,in exact figures, $1,989,024,000.

Moreover, it appeared that there had been no such avidity to take the new bonds in exchange for the T 4% Liberty Loan bonds, as had been supposed 41/ would be the case. To induce acceptance the offer of exchange had been made very attractive, the offer 4s and those not 1 extending to both the called 1/ called. The new Treasury bonds were offered in exchange at par, whereas those buying for cash had had to pay, as already stated, a premium of 1/ 2%. 1 It had been hoped that large amounts of the Liberty 41/is which had not been called would consider the offer advantageous and be glad to make the exchange. Not so, however. The exchange subscriptions altogether totaled $899,899,200, but the amount of uncalled Fourth Liberty 41/0 presented for conversion proved no more than $25,000,000. This demonstrated conclusively that the Treasury Department, in refraining from long-term financing in December and offering instead $950,000,000 of oneyear Treasury certificates of indebtedness, had judged market and investment conditions correctly. In this week's financing the reasons for not resorting to attempts to float long-term obligations were even stronger than at the time of the December financing, a new adverse factor having arisen in the reassembling of Congress and the action of President Roosevelt in submitting his devaluation proposition for cutting the gold content of the dollar to 60c, while still retaining authority to cut it to only 50c. on the dollar. This was calculated to impose an additional drawback to floating new long-term obligations by reason of the uncertainty as to how the devaluation proposal would be received by the general public. Furthermore,this was the first large financing operation to be undertaken since President Roosevelt submitted his extraordinary budget, and indicated that $10,000,000,000 borrowing would have to be done in the first six months of 1934. Faced by this state of things, the Secretary of the Treasury was governed accordingly. He is proposing to raise $1,000,000,000, and he arranged to get the whole amount through the floating of short-term obligations—$500,000,000 by the issuance of Treas2% inter1 ury notes running 131/2 months bearing 2/ est and dated Jan. 29 1934 and maturing March 15 1935, and another $500,000,000 by the issuance of Treasury certificates of indebtedness running a little 2months dated Jan. 29 1934 and falling due 1 over 7/ 2% interest. 1 Sept. 15 1934 and carrying only 1/ The whole thing was a piece of financing of the old order, and it proved extremely successful, the same as similar previous offerings, subscription books being closed on the day of the offering and aggregate subscriptions reaching nearly five times the amount of the offering, or, roughly, $4,770,2% Treasury notes 1 000,000—the bids for the 2/ 538 Financial Chronicle Jan. 27 1934 totaling $3,415,000,000 and for the 1/ 1 2% certificates \"Following the orthodox pattern, the Treasury $1,355,000,000. will proceed by one or more new conversion offers 4% The rates of interest must be considered low, even to meet the problem of the $1,000,000,000 of 41/ though some previous offerings of notes and cer- Fourth Liberty Loan bonds which have been called tificates have been on a somewhat lower basis.

This seems a natural rejoinder when Such impairment is not now in evidence over which one is apprised that Joseph B. Eastman, Federal the country may be congratulated. It is well enough Co-ordinator of Transportation, in his report issued to note, too, that the success attending this week's last Saturday, advised the Inter-State Commerce financing was achieved in face of uncertainty over Commission that the only solution of the railroad the provisions that are to form part of future issues problem lies in public ownership of the railroads, of Government obligations. The bill now before for Mr. Eastman has long been an advocate of GovCongress contains sections which change essentially ernment ownership, and the report is devoted in a certain features and characteristics of future issues, predominant degree to an elaborate argument in these being inserted at the request of the Secretary favor of Government ownership and operation, of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. How the bill though even Mr. Eastman is forced to admit that the will stand in that respect on its final passage is of time is not ripe for this ultimate solution.

His observations on that point go directly to the mark. He says: \"They (the restrictions) go beyond what is reasonable and stand in the way of improvements in operation and service, which in the long run will be of advantage to railroad labor. The employees cannot with wisdom oppose progress which will stimulate the growth and development of the industry. It is right and proper, however, that where changes in methods of operation or administration are made, not because of lack of business, but for the primary purpose of performing work more efficiently, salvage of the employees should be a charge upon the savings effected within reasonable limits.\" He says that a special report on this matter will later be transmitted, but also expresses the opinion that \"If general business conditions improve and if the efforts of the carriers are directed primarily to increase in traffic and secondarily to economies, the labor situation should be much less difficult than it is now.,, As to railroad credit, Mr.Eastman is of the opinion that Government aid will be required for a considerable time to come. He declares that \"railroad credit from private sources will in any event be negligible for some time.\" As to this, it is quite possible he may not be sufficiently optimistic, but what he says about the need for dealing with such a situation, if it continues, must unhesitatingly be accepted: \"The dependence in this period must be on Government credit This should be extended freely, to the extent that there is reasonable security for sound and well-considered expenditures which will add to employment and improve service to the public. Where funds are sought to meet debt maturities, either of interest or of principal, the policy now embodied in the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act and the Emergency Act should be observed and somewhat amplified. That is, new Government credit, or the term of existing Reconstruction Finance Corporation loans, should not be extended, if it appears to the Inter-State Commerce Commission that the carrier is in need of financial reorganization in the public interest. This principle might appropriately be modified to permit loans to meet maturities of underlying securities which the Commission believes would not be disturbed in a reorganization. Reorganizations of carriers, now or hereafter, in insolvency or bankruptcy should be effected as speedily as practicable, in the view of the Federal Co-ordinator, and in a manner which will result in a very material reduction in fixed charges. Mr. Eastman well says that the railroad credit problem is critical in its importance. Then adds the following, with which no fault can be found: \"Government credit to a privately owned industry is defensible only as a temporary expedient. If private credit begins to revive, the Commission can be helpful in stimulating it by taking appropriate action with respect to undue accumulation of funded debt, the establishment of sinking funds or other reserves, and the regulation of rates.\" Altogether, there is, as we have already said, much sensible advice, and the expression of sound judgment, in this report of the Federal Co-ordinator, notwithstanding his strong leaning toward Government ownership. Jan. 27 1934 UCH comfort is to be derived from the greater deliberation which the United States Senate is pursuing in considering President Roosevelt's measure for devaluing the dollar, and such staunch defenders of the national honor and integrity as Carter Glass and those associated with him in opposing some of the especially objectionable features of the measure are deserving of the highest praise. The words used by Mr. Glass in denouncing the whole proposition in unmeasured terms were not a whit too strong. The opposition in the Senate has not accomplished much in modifying any of the essential provisions of the whole scheme, but at least they have succeeded in putting a time limit on the existence and use of the stabilization fund of $2,000,000,000 instead of making it a permanent feature, though they have not succeeded in preventing the concentration of unparalleled powers in the hands of the Secretary of the Treasury, the amendment for substituting a board of five members in place of the Secretary having been defeated. As the bill now stands the existence of the stabilization fund will be limited to a period of two years, with an additional year at the discretion of the President instead of becoming a permanent feature as provided in the measure as it passed in the House by the overwhelming vote of 360 to 40, on Saturday last. But even this slight modification is no mean achievement, considering how the bill was driven through the House with a speed that left little time for debate and discussion. It is undeniable, of course, that there is a mass of public sentiment behind the devaluation proposal, mere expediency being the controlling consideration, in the belief that devaluation will bring the revival in business and rise in commodity prices which everyone is so anxious to see established. In such circumstances matters of principle and of ethics count for little. The country has suffered unparalleled business depression for over four years, and everything that promises a change for the better is seized upon as a drowning man clutches a straw. Nothing else counts, the promise of better things being the only consideration that makes an appeal, and an appeal, too, which it is hard to resist after such a long period of distress. M HE Federal Reserve condition statements this week are again colorless, by which we mean that they show no new features as compared with recent previous weeks, the changes all being along the same line as before. The volume of Reserve credit outstanding has been somewhat further reduced, this being due, as in previous weeks, to diminished borrowing on the part of the member banks, as shown by a diminution in the discount holdings of the 12 Reserve institutions, and by a reduction in the holdings of acceptances purchased in the open market, some of the bills held having evidently run off and new supplies of bills not having been offered to the Reserve banks. The discount holdings of the 12 Reserve banks have fallen from $101,315,000 Jan. 17 to $97,220,000 Jan: 24, and the holdings of acceptances have dropped from $111,939,000 to $104,126,000. Holdings of United States Government securities have again continued unchanged, the amount this week being reported at $2,431,739,000 as against $2,431,790,000 last week. The result is that the volume of Reserve credit outstand- T Volume 138 • Financial Chronicle ing, as measured by the total of the bills and securities held, stands at $2,634,388,000 as against $2,646,457,000 last week. Federal Reserve notes outstanding have also undergone further contraction through the continued return of money from circulation. The amount of Federal Reserve notes in circulation this week is $2,931,359,000 as against $2,959,556,000 last week, and the amount of Federal Reserve bank notes stands at $203,176,000 this week as against $204,536,000 last week. The member banks have improved their position in every direction. Besides having reduced their borrowings at the Reserve banks, as already shown, the reserve account of the member banks increased during the week from $2,788,073,000 to $2,850,961,000. This increase in member bank deposits brought the total deposits of the 12 Reserve banks up from $3,036,890,000 to $3,053,023,000, notwithstanding that Government deposits were reduced from $105,356,000 to $65,240,000. With larger deposits the cash reserves required against the same also increased, but on the other hand the cash reserves required against circulation diminished inasmuch as the volume of Federal Reserve notes outstanding was reduced, as already pointed out The gold holdings of the 12 Reserve institutions were only slightly changed during the week, being reported at $3,559,963,000 Jan. 24 against $3,560,304,000 on Jan. 17. The result altogether is that the ratio of cash reserves is a trifle larger this week than it was last week. In other words, the ratio of total gold reserves and other cash to deposit and Federal Reserve note liabilities combined stands at 63.6% against 63.5% last week. The item of gold held abroad which a week ago was reported at $4,319,000 this week is down to $3,120,000. This would indicate that some of the gold held a week ago has been shipped to this country. A further explanation may be found in the fact that the New York Federal Reserve Bank yesterday reported $5,162,700 gold released from earmark for foreign account without there having been any gold exports. The amount of United States Government securities held as part collateral for Federal Reserve note issues has further diminished during the week from $563,100,000 to $558,800,000. TNCREASED or renewed dividend declarations by 1 corporate entities have again been a feature the present week. The Pennsylvania RR. declared a dividend of 50c. a share on its stock, payable March 15 1934; a similar distribution was made on the stock on March 15 last year, and the latest action enables the company to continue its record of having made some distribution uninterruptedly in every year since 1847. The Norfolk & Western Ry. declared an extra dividend of 2%, in addition to the usual quarterly dividend of 2% on the common stock, payable on March 19. Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co. declared an extra dividend of 4% and the regular quarterly dividend of 4% on the common and common B stocks, all payable March 1. An extra dividend of 4% has been paid in March of each year since and including 1925; in addition, in 1926 and 1927 a 10% stock dividend was paid. Bristol-Myers Co. of Delaware declared an extra dividend of 10c. a share, in addition to the regular quarterly divi. dend of 50c. a share on common, both payable March 1; these dividends are at the same rate as 541 those paid by the same company on Dec. 1 1933, the first dividends following the company's segregation from Drug, Inc. Eaton Manufacturing Co. declared a dividend of 25c. a share on common, payable Feb. 15, as compared with 20c. a share paid on Nov. 15 1933, this last having been the first dividend paid since May 2 1932, on which date a quarterly dividend of 121/ 2c. a share was distributed. Northwestern Public Service Co. declared a dividend of 871/ 2c. a share on the 7% cumul. pref. stock and a dividend of 75c. a share on the 6% cumul. pref. stock, both payable March 1; regular quarterly payments of 13 4% on the 7% pref. and 11/ 2% on the 6% pref. stock were made to and including June 1 1933, but none since. The Bigelow-Sanford. Carpet Co., Inc., declared a special dividend of $1 a share on the common dock, payable Feb. 15, this being the first distribution since Aug. 1 1930. The Manhattan Shirt Co. declared two quarterly dividends of 15c. a share on common, payable March 1 and June 1 1934, these being the first payments since Dec. 1 1931. A. Stein & Co. declared a special dividend of 25c. a share on common, payable Feb. 24, this being the first distribution since Feb.15 1932. HERE was a small increase in the value of the foreign trade of the United States in the closing month of last year, both in merchandise exports and imports. The greater part of the increase in exports, however, was due to the higher value of cotton exports. In bales, cotton exports last month were less than in November, and considerably under those for December 1932, but the higher value of cotton raised the value of exports for December 1933 over that for the corresponding month in 1932. Total exports in December last were valued at $192,000,000 and imports at $133,000,000, an export trade balance of $59,000,000. In November last exports amounted to $184,000,000 and imports to $128,000,000, the excess of exports for that month being $56,000,000, while for December 1932 merchandise exports were valued at $131,614,000 and imports at $97,087,000, the excess of exports amounting to only $34,527,000. For the calendar year 1933 exports amounted to $1,675,020,000 and imports to $1,448,640,000, the excess value of exports for the year being $226,380,000. In 1932 the value of exports was $1,611,016,000 and the value of the imports $1,322,774,000, the excess of exports •being $288,242,000. The increase in the value of both exports and imports last year was due entirely to the larger movements that appeared in the last few months of the year. With the exception of 1932, both exports and imports last year were lower in value than for many preceding years. Cotton exports last month amounted to 837,756 bales, compared with 933,212 bales in November and 1,058,924 bales in December 1932. The value of cotton exports last month continued higher than for December 1932, notwithstanding the much smaller movement in the closing month of 1933. The value for the latter was $44,296,356, whereas for the heavier movement in December 1932 the value of cotton exports was $38,982,142. Exports other than cotton last month amounted to $147,705,000, whereas in November the amount was $135,225,000 and in December 1932, $92,632,000. Exports of gold last month increased over November to $10,815,000, while gold imports were little T 542 Financial Chronicle changed at $1,687,000. For last year gold exports were $366,652,000 and imports $192,917,000, exports exceeding imports by $173,735,000. In 1932 gold exports amounted to $809,528,000 and imports to $363,315,000, the excess of exports being $446,213,000. HE New York stock market has continued its upward course the present week and the rise has been virtually uninterrupted day after day. The advances have not been spectacular on any particular day, but have had as their distinctive feature, the fact that the market has moved almost steadily upward, making the cumulative gains quite substantial in a number of instances. The bond market has at the same time been extremely active and also steadily advancing, with the volume of trading extremely large. Buying of bonds, indeed has been carried on with great confidence and the gains for the week in the case of the lower-priced issues have in many instances been more striking than in the case of stocks. The tone all around has been strong and confident with sentiment strongly bullish. The underlying consideration seems to be the devaluation project of the Administration at Washington. The disposition is to regard the devaluation program as assuring both a higher level of commodity prices as designed and also growing trade revival. In addition, the new and larger dividend distributions by some well known corporations have been a stimulating feature. The action of the Pennsylvania RR. in making a dividend distribution came somewhat as a surprise as there had been more or less doubt as to whether a dividend distribution could be counted upon, and the extra dividend on Norfolk & Western common has been also favorably received. Trade indications were much the same as in previous weeks and in the main, appeared to point in the direction of a slightly rising volume of trade. The American Iron & Steel Institute on Monday reported that the steel companies were employed at 32.5% of capacity, which was slightly lower than the rate of the previous week, which was 34.2%, but these slight changes in steel operations from week to week are not looked upon as possessing any special significance. The production of electricity by the electric light and power industry of the United States for the week ended last Saturday was reported at 1,624,846,000 kwh. as against 1,484,089,000 kwh. in the corresponding week of 1933, being an increase of 9.5% against 10.1%increase the week previous and 9.7% the week preceding. The striking feature was that again the output ran in excess of that of two years ago. Commodity prices were well maintained even if they did not show any very marked rising tendency. Foreign exchange rates moved lower most of the time, though within a relatively narrow range, and the gold value of the dollar improved as against the European currencies. That howeIer, did not appear to act as a damper on those speculating for a rise in security values. As indicating the course of the commodity markets the May option for wheat at Chicago closed yesterday at 899/8c. as against 91c. the close on Friday of last week. May corn at Chicago closed yesterday 8c. as against 523 at 523/ 4c. the close the previous Friday. May oats at Chicago closed yesterday at 375Ac. against 39c. the close on Friday of last week.

The spot price for cotton here in New York yesterday was 11.35c. as against 11.65c. on Friday of last week. The spot price for rubber yesterday was 10.13c. against 9.37c. the previous Friday. Domestic copper was quoted yesterday at 83.(c. as against 83Ac. the previous Friday. Silver again moved within narrow limits. In London the price yesterday was 19 5-16d. per ounce as against 193 %d. on Friday of last week. The New York quotation yesterday was 43.8c. as against 44.90c. the previous Friday. In the matter of the foreign exchange, cable transfers on London yesterday closed at $4.963 as against $5.02% the close the previous Friday, while cable transfers on Paris closed yesterday at 6.21c. against 6.273/2c. the close on Friday of last week. Call loans on the New York Stock Exchange again continued at 1% per annum throughout the entire week. Trading was of growing proportions. On the New York Stock Exchange the sales at the half-day session on Saturday last were 1,954,440 shares; on Monday they were 2,663,410 shares; on Tuesday 2,383,740 shares; on Wednesday 3,356,780 shares; on Thursday 2,267,500 shares, and on Friday 2,506,640 shares. On the New York Curb Exchange the sales last Saturday were 255,660 shares; on Monday 426,780 shares; on Tuesday 332,190 shares; on Wednesday 491,055 shares; on Thursday 282,753 shares, and on Friday 306,690 shares.

RENDS were diverse this week on stock exchanges in the leading European financial centers. There was active trading on the London Stock Exchange in almost all sessions, and the tendency was generally upward. The Paris Bourse and the Berlin Boerse were irregular, with the more emphatic movements toward lower levels. Uncertainty continued to prevail in all markets regarding the effects of the monetary policy in the United States, and apprehensions were expressed with respect to the use of the $2,000,000,000 exchange \"depreciation\" fund, as the London market terms it. Prime Minister MacDonald of Great Britain gave expression to these feelings in a speech at Leeds, England, Tuesday, in which he declared that it is most essential for the great nations to reach agreements about the international exchange values of T 543 their currencies. It was made clear in London that the Prime Minister's remarks were not in any sense a declaration of official policy. As the shock of American monetary developments wore off, European markets again paid more attention to the course of trade and production. British and German indices remain favorable in trend, but the French figures reflect a diminishing turnover of merchandise in that country. French unemployment totals are increasing week by week, in keeping with the business indices. The London Stock Exchange began the week with an active and cheerful session, in which more attention was paid speculative securities than investment issues. British funds showed small fractional losses, but gains were recorded in most of the industrial securities. Home railway shares were in excellent demand, and most international issues also improved. There was less activity Tuesday, and also more irregularity. British funds were better, but industrial issues showed the effects of profit-taking, and only a few issues made progress. International stocks eased, while gold mining issues also receded. The trend Wednesday was quite cheerful, and gains were recorded in almost all departments of the market. British funds moved fractionally higher, and most industrial stocks also gained, with the movement most pronounced in the tobacco issues. International stocks were stimulated by sharp gains in oil shares. Activity increased Thursday, with the general tendency much the same as in the previous session. British funds were quiet and barely changed, but industrial stocks moved up under the leadership of the tobacco group of issues. The gains were somewhat diminished by profit-taking near the close. Anglo-American trading favorites were in good demand in the international section. Dealings were quiet yesterday, with British funds uncertain, but industrial stocks and international issues improved. The Paris Bourse was dull in the initial session of the week, with changes small in most securities. Rentes remained steady, but among the equities there were a few substantial recessions, and these movements set the tone of the market. Trading was on an extremely small scale at Paris on Tuesday, and even small transactions sufficed to affect quotations. The lack of buying interest caused a slow downward drift of prices. Rentes held their ground, however, and a few equities also were unchanged. There was a modest increase in business Wednesday, owing to an overnight accumulation of orders. The market was firm while these were being executed, but quotations again moved slowly downward thereafter, and most of the initial gains were lost before the close. Rentes showed small recessions. Thursday's opening was again firm, but a reaction developed which carried quotations of the more speculative issues off sharply for the day. Oil shares and utility stocks proved the only exceptions to the general trend. Modest gains were recorded in quiet trading yesterday. Rentes were better as well as equities. The Berlin Boerse started the week with quiet trading and unimportant changes in quotations. Issues of steel, mining and utility companies were slightly improved at first, but the initial impetus soon wore off, and in a downward movement which followed almost all the gains were lost. Trading Tuesday was on a very small scale, even some of 544 Financial Chronicle the ordinarily active stocks remaining unquoted for some time after the opening. There was little buying, but selling pressure also was absent and changes were nominal. A 'definite downward tendency developed Wednesday on the Boerse, despite further small dealings. Apprehensions regarding the maintenance of dividends on some brewery stocks caused declines in this group, and sporadic liquidation developed also in other sections. Further losses were general in Thursday's trading, but the decline exceeded a point only in a few of the more active stocks. Some of the heavy industrial issues, such as I. G. Farbenindustrie, were well maintained. An upward trend was established early yesterday and maintained throughout the session. Gains were substantial in the more speculative stocks. ISCUSSION of the transfers of interest on the long-term external debts of German municipalities, banks and corporations was started in Berlin, Thursday, after some additional preliminary maneuvering. Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank, called the meeting specifically to consider requests for special treatment of Dutch and Swiss holders of German bonds. The matter has far outstripped such limitations, however, as British and American creditors' representatives made it plain they would insist upon a general discussion, while steps also have been taken by the United States Government. Lack of agreement anywhere on the essentials of this matter was indicated when the meeting began, Thursday. Dr. Schacht was absent from Berlin, plainly because of disagreement with the German Ministry of Economics on some phases of the problem. The creditors represented included only those of the United States, Great Britain and Switzerland. It is suggested in Berlin reports, however, that the absent Swedes will support the British and Americans in their claims for equal treatment. while the Dutch are aligned with the Swiss in favor of special arrangements for 100% payment of bondholders in return for increased imports of German goods. Dr. Fritz Dreyse, Vice-President of the Reichsbank, presided, while the German views were also presented by Dr. Ritter of the Foreign Office, and Dr. Posse of the Ministry of Economics. It is not expected by creditors' representatives, a Berlin dispatch to the New York \"Times\" said, that any increased transfers will result from the current conference. It is hoped on all sides, however, that there will be a better understanding of the problem after the meeting is concluded. The Berlin conference originally was called for last Monday, but it was postponed in order to leave time for the arrival of the British and American representatives. The latter are intent chiefly upon reopening the settlement for the first six months of this year, imposed by Dr. Schacht, which calls for transfer of 30% interest in cash and 70% in scrip redeemable at half its face value. President Roosevelt intervened in the situation last Monday, by taking the unusual course of calling Dr. Hans Luther, the German Ambassador, to the White House, for a review of the matter. It was stated at the conclusion of the meeting that the President had requested equal treatment of United States creditors with those of other countries. Subsequently, it was disclosed that the general question of trade relations between Germany and the United States had been covered in the conversation, with President Roose- Jan. 27 1934 velt suggesting as the ultimate ideal an approximate balance of international payments. Mr. Roosevelt called to Ambassador Luther's attention, it is said, that Dr. Schacht's figures on trade with the United States, utilized to justify the cut in interest payments on bonds, are not sufficient to cover the matter, as they leave out of account American tourist expenditures in Germany and remittances of immigrants. The Reichsbank issued statistics last Saturday showing average payments to other countries on long-term bonds. As full interest payments are continuing in foreign currency on Young plan bonds, and full amortization payments on Dawes plan bonds, the averages are increased by taking the German Government indebtedness into consideration. United States creditors as a whole receive 76% of their total interest, on this basis, while British and French bondholders receive, respectively, 87% and 96% of their claims. _ ISARMAMENT discussions in Europe proceeded this week in the same faltering fashion that marked all previous conversations on this important matter during the last two years. Direct exchanges between France and Germany were continued, in the form of a German reply to the latest French communication to Berlin. The German note, couched in conciliatory terms, is said to support the arguments previously made by Berlin for a shortterm army of 300,000 men, equipped with defensive armaments, and it also asks pertinent questions regarding the disposition of the French colonial forces and the possibility of any genuine reduction of French offensive armaments. Only brief indications of the contents a the German communication have been made available. It is indicated rather definitely, however, that Berlin brought up the problem of naval armaments in its note of Jan. 19, probably with a view to German participation in any further naval conference. The French reaction to the German note was pessimistic at first, but in a Paris dispatch of Wednesday to the New York \"Times\" it was suggested that France has become resigned to the need of some concessions to the Reich. A new element was introduced Tuesday, when London reports indicated that a German note had been received by the British Government asking for suggestions that might lead to an adjustment of the Franco-German controversy. It was hinted in the British capital that a similar note had been sent by the Reich to the Italian Government. In Paris the belief prevailed that Great Britain and Italy soon will move for a four-Power Conference to consider the situation, and it was broadly hinted that any such gathering might prove to be, in the armaments field, what the Lausanne Conference was in the reparations field. There were statements in the Italian press early this week, obviously inspired, which urged intervention by Great Britain and Italy in the direct conversations between the Paris and Berlin Governments. At Geneva the usual procedure of postponing the formal sessions of the General Disarmament Conference was again followed last Saturday. A meeting of the Bureau, or Steering Committee of the Conference, was scheduled for this week, but it was quietly called off in order to provide more time for private negotiations. Arthur Henderson, President, and other leaders of the Conference, decided to meet in London Feb. 13, when they will decide if the Bureau is to be called into Volume 138 Financial Chronicle session. The chief function of the Bureau is to decide upon plenary sessions. 545 connection with the nation-wide celebration of the first anniversary of Chancellor Adolf Hitler's assumption of office.

Greece and Turkey may be participants in this arrangement, it is suggested in reports from Belgrade, the Yugoslavian capital, and efforts also are to be made to obtain the adherence of Bulgaria. King Boris and Queen Giovanni, of Bulgaria, visited King Carol of Rumania, at Sinaia, this week, and it is understood the adherence of Bulgaria to the treaty was discussed during the visit. The pact provides, a dispatch to the New York \"Times\" states, that all international problems affecting the signatories shall first be dealt with by mutual discussion, with the aim of presenting a united front. The treaty has not yet been signed, but it is expected that this formality will be completed soon after views have been exchanged by the Rumanian and Bulgarian sovereigns. The Foreign Ministers of the Little Entente States are understood to have discussed also the question of recognizing the Soviet Russian Government, but it is reported that no decision was reached on this point. The Zagreb Conference originally was scheduled for Jan. 8, but it was postponed owing to the assassination of Premier Ion G. Duca of Rumania, and the hesitation of the Rumanian Foreign Minister, Nicolas Titulescu, to accept the portfolio of foreign affairs in the new regime. The Little Entente countries are reported in a United Press dispatch from Zagreb to 'be united in their views on the disarmament question. A Balkan pact of economic co-operation was discussed. LEVATION of Dr. Carlos Mendieta to the Presidency of the Cuban Republic already has been followed by the recognition of his regime by the United States Government, and it is now hoped that the chaotic conditions in the Island will be rapidly brought to a semblance of order. The Administration in Washington made a hasty survey of the new situation in Cuba occasioned by the assumption of the executive office by Dr. Mendieta on Jan. 18. The unusual expedient was adopted, Monday, of informing the Washington diplomatic representatives of all other American Republics of the contemplated step. Formal recognition was extended Tuesday, and similar action was announced the following day by the Governments of Great Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Bolivia, Chile and many other countries. It is hardly to be doubted that this adjustment of Cuban international relations will contribute to a settlement of the internal affairs of the Republic, which have been in turmoil ever since the dictator, Gerardo Machado, was ousted last summer. But the discontent of the Cuban people is deep-seated, and it may be some time before such manifestations as the forcible expropriation of sugar central and plantation owners are brought under control. The new President of Cuba moved with commendable energy last week to form a Cabinet and to begin the task of solving the many problems confronting the people. His popularity was a great asset, and he was able to announce at the end of last week that peace had been re-established. \"From all indications I have received, public opinion is favorable to my Government,\" Dr. Mendieta declared. \"I desire to assure Cubans and foreigners alike that they may have the utmost confidence that they will be treated with right and justice.\" He indicated that he will probably postpone the elections for a general assembly called by the Government of Dr. Ramon E Jan. 27 1934 Grau San Martin. The date of April 22 originally set is too early, as it will not allow sufficient time for the organization of political parties, Dr. Menclieta said. He proposed the formation of a State Council, in which representatives of commerce, industry, the workers, the political factions, the revolutionary organizations and other elements of Cuban life would participate. This body would have advisory legislative functions and would bear part of the Executive responsibility. In naming his Cabinet, Dr. Mendieta made some selections that are universally commended. As Secretary of State he chose Dr. Cosme de la Torrienta,former Ambassador to Washington, while Dr. Joaquin Martinez Saenz was chosen Secretary of the Treasury. Dr. Saenz held a similar post -in the de Cespedes Government last year. The new situation in Cuba was discussed at some length in Key West,Fla.,late last week, by Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Jefferson Caffery, President Roosevelt's personal representative in Havana. Secretary Hull indicated after the conference that prospects were good for early recognition of the Mendieta Government by the Washington Administration. Discussions in Washington followed last Sunday between President Roosevelt and Secretary Hull. The State Department issued invitations for a conference at the White House, Monday, with the representatives of all the Latin American Republics. At the close of that meeting, Secretary Hull informed representatives of the press that the President had communicated to the Latin American diplomats the determination of the United Stated to recognize the new Cuban regime. The President's action with regard to the other Latin American States has considerable significance of its own, as it appears to be a new development in the \"good neighbor\" policy which the Administration has espoused. Formal recognition followed as a matter of course on Tuesday, notification to this effect being extended both through Mr. Caffery in Havana and through the American Charge d'Affaires in Cuba, H.Freeman Matthews. \"I am immensely gratified,\" said Secretary Hull, in announcing the action,\"that the recognition of Cuba comes at this time. The almost universal support (of the Mendieta Government) by the people of Cuba points strongly to the maintenance of a stable government and the continuance of law and order in that country. It is the devout wish of the friends of the Cuban people that all forces of law and order in the Island will continue to unify themselves in support of the new Government which has just been installed.\" Mr. Hull announced also that 10 of the 16 American warships on duty in Cuban waters will be recalled immediately, while the other six probably will be withdrawn soon. He intimated that consideration now will be given to alteration of the treaty of 1903 with Cuba, with especial attention to be paid the Platt amendment. Any changes of this nature will take time, however, as they will require the consent of the United States Congress as well as action by a Cuban Constituent Assembly. Jefferson Caffery will be the American Ambassador to Cuba, Mr. Hull indicated. News of American recognition was received in Havana with general rejoicing by the populace. The streets filled as if by magic, dispatches said, and Havana went \"mildly crazy\" in its relief over the ending of the political turmoil. Volume 138 Financial Chronicle ECRETARY OF STATE CORDELL HULL issued a highly optimistic statement on the Seventh Pan-American Conference, last Sunday, immediately after his return to Washington from attendance at the Montevideo sessions last December. The tangible results of the gathering were referred to only briefly by the Secretary, but he expressed the belief that they are of wide import in matters of better trade relations, multiplied friendly contacts and tranquillity in international dealings. Mr. Hull placed great emphasis, on the other hand, upon the intangible gain for all American Republics resulting from a new spirit of co-operation and solidarity. The attitude of Latin America toward the United States has changed very decidedly, he declared, as there was a \"surge of good will\" toward this country. This change is due, in Mr. Hull's opinion, to the \"good neighbor policy\" which the Administration has developed toward Latin America. \"For the first time in the history of such conferences there was no imposing bloc arrayed against us,\" the Secretary stated. \"Individual carpers and quibblers were thwarted. Suspicions were disarmed. Understanding of a genuine sort became the pervading element of the proceedings and cooperation a significant reality.\" Only a brief reference was made in the statement to the Chaco war, which the Conference halted for a few weeks by an armistice arrangement, but which again is being waged with bitter intensity. Because the delegates moved in common accord on the Chaco matter, Mr. Hull expressed the \"firm belief that the result will be the elimination of warfare in this hemisphere.\" S ORLD attention was focused sharply this week on the international affairs of the Far East, where an increasingly delicate situation has prevailed ever since Japan conquered Manchuria and set up her puppet-State of Manchukuo. Foreign Minister Koki Hirota addressed the Japanese Diet, Tuesday,on the relations of Tokio with other States, and he made very clear in the course of his speech that Japan intends to dominate the Far East. The intentions of Japan, however, he declared, are essentially peaceful. Commanders of British naval units in Asiatic waters assembled at Singapore, Tuesday, to consider a Far Eastern situation which dispatches reported as \"ominous.\" It was considered not without significance that the Imperial Naval Conference was the first summoned by Great Britain in the Far East in five years. The question has aroused much interest in France, from the viewpoint of a possible alliance between Germany and Japan, since it is held in some circles that both the German and Japanese Governments have expansionist designs centering on Russian territory. Holland, also, is debating the question of a Far Eastern dispute and its possible effects on her important insular possessions in the Pacific. Indeed, one of the British naval experts at Singapore is understood to have returned hastily to the naval base there from Java, where he is said to have advised the authorities on the defense of the Dutch possessions in the event of a war. In this situation any statement on Japanese foreign policy naturally is considered an important event, and Foreign Minister Hirota's address last Tuesday was scanned carefully in all countries. Notwithstanding the Japanese withdrawal from the League of Nations on March 27 last, Tokio's rela- W 547 tions with \"friendly Powers\" have become even closer and more cordial, Mr. Hirota remarked. Manchukuo is making healthy progress, and the Tokio Government will make unremitting efforts to assist the growth of that State, he said. Maintenance of peace and order in North China is of special concern to Japan, but even more important is the stabilization of China as a whole, in Japanese opinion. \"The Japanese Government,\" the Foreign Minister declared, \"has serious responsibilities for the maintenance of peace in Eastern Asia and has a firm resolve in that regard.\" No question that is intrinsically difficult of solution exists between Japan and the United States, Mr. Hirota continued. Japan fervently desires America's friendship, and at the same time hopes that the Japanese viewpoint will be realized here, he indicated. Japanese relations with Soviet Russia were considered at length in the address before the Diet. Normal contact between the two countries was maintained for years, Mr. Hirota pointed out, and even after the Manchurian incidents there was thorough mutual understanding. \"However, more recently the attitude of the Soviet Union toward Japan seems to have undergone a change of some sort,\" the Foreign Minister continued. \"It is most surprising and regrettable that the Soviet Union should now take to broadcasting at home and abroad, through the press and other channels, unwarranted criticisms directed against Japan. Despite the fundamental differences in both the theory and constitution of the State that divide the two countries, we have always endeavored to keep on good neighborly terms with Soviet Russia and have sought the solution of all questions by pacific means.\" Since Manchukuo was established the Japanese Government has acted on the belief that tranquillity in the Far East required a tripartite relationship among Japan, Manchukuo and Russia, Mr. Hirota said, and he declared that Japan is setting up no new military establishments along the Manchukuo-Soviet frontier. Japan acted only in pursuance of friendship in the proposed sale by Russia to Manchukuo of the Chinese Eastern Railway, he asserted. The hope was expressed that the negotiations for sale of the railway soon will be resumed. Foreign Minister Koki Hirota made some turther clarifying comments on the international situation in an address before the lower House of the Diet, Wednesday. He informed the Parliament that he is communicating with the United States Government in an attempt to facilitate a friendly solution of \"difficult problems likely to arise one or two years hence.\" He referred, a Tokio dispatch to the Associated Press said, to the naval issues that are expected to arise in 1935 and 1936, when the present naval treaties expire. Leaders of the Minseito party in the Diet took up the discussion and insisted that there are no questions between Japan and Russia, or between Japan and the United States, which could not be settled diplomatically. There was criticism, a report to the New York \"Times\" remarked, of the \"crisis doctrine\" of former War Minister Araki, and condemnation of military interference with politics. In Washington it was indicated at the State Department that no communication of any kind had been received from Japan which might be interpreted as the attempt at a friendly solution of difficulties mentioned by Foreign Minister Hirota. • Financial Chronicle 548 Jan. 27 1934 HERE have been no changes this week in the portion of gold on hand to sight liabilities stands now discount rate of any of the foreign central at 79.36%, as compared with 77.98% a year ago. banks.

There was a fair demand for funds, but the credit reservoir remains full to overflowing because of the extensive previous open market operations of the Federal Reserve, and all requirements were met with ease. Short term Treasury financing in the amount of $1,125,000,000 occupied the market this week. Offering was made Wednesday of $500,000,000 13/2% certificates of indebtedness due Sept. 15 1934, and $500,000,000 23/2% notes due March 15 1935, and books were closed the same night. It was announced yesterday that applications to these issues totaled $4,770,000,000.A Treasury discount bill issue of $125,000,000, due in 91 days, was awarded Monday at an average discount of 0.67%, which was also the average on a similar issue sold a week earlier.

The foreign exchange market is exceptionally quiet 549 Financial Chronicle Volume 138 and the fluctuations of sterling this week have been within a narrower range than at any time since Great Britain abandoned the gold standard in September 1931. The entire interest of the market is centered upon the firmness in dollars, for which there is very noticeable demand in London and in the chief Continental centers. The dollar has been exceptionally steady in the foreign centers and sterling, while easier, has been steady in Paris. The United States has made no change in its price for gold, which continues at $34.45 per fine ounce, which figure was posted on Jan. 16. In consequence of the steadiness in these quotations the open market price for gold in London has also been relatively steady, as compared with recent weeks, though ruling at high prices and always at a premium over the sterlingfranc cross rate. The range for sterling this week has been between $4.93 and $5.024, compared with a range last week of between $4.943/ and $5.16%.

Tuesday nance Corporation The market is rife with rumors which may be expected to have a bearing on the future of foreign exchange rates, but no official utterances have been issued and it is evident that traders everywhere are hesitant in taking advanced positions. However, there can be no doubt that while they are dubious as to the future trend of sterling, the general feeling is one of positive bullishness with respect to the dollar. It is expected that some measure of stabilization by the Washington administration is in prospect. Some form of agreement is reported to have been entered into by the American and British authorities looking toward stabilization. These rumors have, however, been emphatically denied by competent opinion in London. It would seem, nevertheless, that the market is correct in assuming that some kind of understanding exists between the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of England with a view to avoiding unnecessary disturbance in the London market by the heavy purchases of American gold and by the undoubted efflux of American and other funds from London to New York which has set in during the last few weeks. Much of the heavy demand for dollars abroad results from short covering, but there is doubtless also a steadily increasing flow of funds from abroad to the American security markets.

Volume 138 Financial Chronicle XCHANGE on the Continental countries continues firm in terms of the dollar, though these units have receded fractionally from the high points of the last few weeks. This applies to French francs, the leading gold currency, as well as to the minor units. Paris seems not in the least disturbed about the American gold buying plans nor the devaluation of the dollar. Paris bankers assert that there is not the slightest possibility of a devalued franc and point to their large gold resources as assurance of stability. Paris reports that the British Equalization.Fund seems not to have intervened in the market to any noticeable extent either -this week or last. In the annual report presented on Thursday by the Bank of France to its shareholders the Bank authorities pointed out: \"The experience of 1933 cannot but re-enforce in our eyes the value of the doctrines to which we have always been and are still firmly attached. We remain more than ever convinced that the convertibility of currency into gold is an indispensable condition of sound economic and social discipline.\" Artificial measures to which nations always tend to resort in times of depression are described as producing illusory or precarious improvements. It is declared that international exchange cannot revive until the value of major currencies has been definitely fixed. Monetary stability, it is asserted, \"alone appears suitable to guarantee the progressive evolution of human societies in order and justice.\" The report concludes: \"France remains faithful thereto and rejects instinctively facile and adventurous solutions which she feels are contrary to her fundamental interests and genius.\" The Bank of France statement for the week ended Jan. 19 shows a decrease of 93,422,039 francs in gold holdings, the total standing at 77,160,582,755 francs, which compares with 82,305,917,155 francs a year ago and with 28,935,000,000 francs when the unit was stabilized in June 1928. The Bank's ratio, however, is at the high figure of 79.36%, compared with 79.24% a week earlier, with 77.98% a year ago and with legal requirement of 35%. German marks are off sharply compared with last week. The mark is still, however, exceptionally high in terms of the dollar. The mark is off sharply from the French franc to points well below the theoretical level at which it would be profitable to export gold from Germany to France were Germany on a free gold standard. Mark exchange is entirely nominal. Various items relating to the German credit transfer discussions will be found in the news columns on other pages. Italian lire are firm and steady. Premier Mussolini and the Finance Minister in recent speeches before the Italian Senate made remarks which indicate that the Italian Government is firmly determined to maintain the lira at its present parity with gold. The technical position of the Italian currency in the foreign exchange market is strong and the Bank of Italy continues to show improvement and increasing liquidity in its statements. The return for Jan. 10 showed ratio of reserves to sight liabilities at 49.32%, while ratio of gold to notes was 53.82%. In Milan and in official Italian quarters the matter of stabilization of currencies is regarded as of more importance to Great Britain and the United States than to the rest of the world. While exchange on Czechoslovakia is one of the minor units in New York, it becomes of interest at E 551 the present time because of the extremely sharp decline in the Czechoslovak crown. The decline resulted from plans put forth by Finance Minister Englis to grant a 30% premium to Czechoslovak exporters while making a charge of 30% for foreign currencies needed by importers. These plans were announced early in the week and the currency was offered heavily in Vienna and other Continental cities. The plans of Dr. Englis have not thus far been accepted. The Czechoslovak National Bank is opposed to any form of foreign exchange control, in the belief that such methods must lead to currency devaluation. The Czechoslovak unit has remained exceptionally steady during the financial crises of the last 12 years, and this is the first time since 1922 that the crown registered a considerable"
