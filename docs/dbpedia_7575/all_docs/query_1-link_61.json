        "text": "Weather\n\nThe weather is finally hot enough for a full-blown beach vacation as the southern Dalmatian coast will see an average daily high of 77°F (25°C), with temperatures dropping slightly in the evening. The Adriatic is an inviting 72°F (22°C), and the UV levels are high, so be sure to pack your swimsuit and slather on the sunscreen. Zagreb and inland Croatia's temperatures are comparable, with a range between 55°F-75°F (13°C-24°C).\n\nCrowds & Costs\n\nIn early June, you're still ahead of the tourist crush in most coastal cities, with the exception of popular Dubrovnik. Here the tourist season is well underway, so plan ahead and make your necessary reservations. Whether you're visiting Dubrovnik or further up the coast, you can expect an uptick in prices as all hotels and restaurants are open for business. Ferry schedules are running on their summer schedule and are fully operational, making it more convenient to plan your day. Toward the end of the month, some of the more popular venues can feel crowded, and most airlines, hotels, and car rental companies no longer offer bargain prices.\n\nWhere to Go\n\nThe Adriatic Sea is warm, the sun is shining, and the days are long, making June a great time to explore the Dalmatian coast and its many islands. Begin in Dubrovnik in Southern Dalmatia, taking in its fortress walls, and travel up the coast through the Pelješac peninsula and onto the islands of Korčula and Hvar. A popular next stop is to visit Split before cutting inland to Krka National Park for a swim in one of its lakes. Continuing up the coast to Zadar and into northern Dalmatia to take in a legendary sunset (Alfred Hitchcock is on record saying they're the best here).\n\nOther great islands to check out are the Elafiti Islands, like Koločep and Lopud—tourism is fairly lowkey, making these islands a great getaway from the crowds you can expect on the larger, more popular islands further north. Hvar is a great jumping-off point for the nearby Pakleni islands and Vis and Biševo islands further out.\n\nWhat to Do\n\nThis is still a good month for cultural sightseeing, although the key sites will begin to feel crowded by the end of June. The weather is now perfect for sunbathing, and the sea is finally warm enough for swimming and all other water-related activities (kayaking, sailing, snorkeling), making the coast and the islands a perfect holiday destination. National Parks like Krka and Plitvice Lakes are also great options to visit, though keep in mind that you cannot swim in the lakes of Plitvice.\n\nJune is a great month for hiking. Check out the cliff-enclosed gorges and striking ridge-top trails in the Northern Velebit and the Paklenica national parks. Or head to Orebić on the Pelješac peninsula to trek along the southern slopes of Mt. Ilija. Another option is to venture to the far eastern end of the peninsula to Ston and climb its impressive defensive walls.\n\nCroatia is laden with wineries offering a variety of wine tasting tours, from the Konavle region southeast of Dubrovnik to Hvar and Korčula and all the way to the Istrian Peninsula. Join a cycling wine tour like this Wine Tasting and Cycling Day Tour in Korčula for a great way to experience the island.\n\nEvents in June\n\nAnimafest Zagreb. This prestigious festival has taken place in Zagreb since 1972—odd-numbered years are devoted to feature films, even-numbered ones to short films.\n\nCest is d'Best, Zagreb. Every year, from late May to early June, Zagreb hosts a massive party of international performers, from the arts (music, dance, and theater) to sports.\n\nINmusic Festival, Zagreb. Zagreb's highest-profile music festival takes place for three solid days of international performances.\n\nLabin Art Republika, Labin. Running from June to September, the town comes alive with street performances, and studios open their doors. Additionally, every Tuesday at 9:30 pm, free guided tours depart from the tourist office in the old town, re-counting legends and myths of the area.\n\nDesign District Zagreb. More than a week-long street party, the neighborhood around Zagreb's Martićeva street comes alive with a number of exhibitions, workshops, cultural events, concerts, and pop-up installations drawing in the city's artists, writers, architects, and designers.\n\nInternational Children's Festival, Šibenik. This three-week event in Šibenik begins every third Saturday in June and features craft workshops, music, dance, children’s film and theatre, puppets, and parades.\n\nHideout, Zrće. Late June sees electronic dance music take over Zrće's beach bars and clubs.\n\nMidsummer Scene, Dubrovnik.
