        "text": "History\n\n[edit]\n\nThe area of Novi Sad was inhabited since the distant past - the found remains of old settlements date back to the Neolithic period (5000 BCE). Before the middle ages, the region was inhabited by different tribes, including Celts, Romans, and Huns. Slavic tribes (including Serbs) settled the region around Novi Sad mainly in the 6th and 7th century. The region was under the medieval Kingdom of Hungary in the 11th and 12th century and afterwards under the Ottomans from 1526 until 1687, when Habsburg Monarchy took over the control.\n\nThe settlement was declared a \"free royal city” by the Habsburg empress Maria Theresa in 1748, and it gained its present names Novi Sad, Újvidék, and Neoplanta, meaning “new plantation” in Serbian, Hungarian, and Latin, respectively. For much of the 18th and 19th centuries, this was the largest Serb-inhabited city in the world, part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the end of World War I in 1918, when it became part of Kingdom of Serbia. During World War II, it was under Hungarian occupation.\n\nAfter the World War II, the city went through rapid industrialization and its population more than doubled in the period between World War II and the breakup of Yugoslavia after the fall of the Soviet Union. Devastated by NATO bombardment that lasted 78 days during the Kosovo War of 1999, Novi Sad was left without any of its three Danube bridges, and with significant damage to its infrastructure including communications, water, and electricity. Residential areas were cluster-bombed several times while its oil refinery was bombarded daily.\n\nNovi Sad has mostly recovered from the 1990s and it has grown strongly since 2001, shifting its economy from industry-driven to the tertiary sector. It is home of the national headquarters of numerous banks, third largest insurance company in Serbia, and major energy companies. Novi Sad is also a growing information technology center in Serbia.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nNovi Sad has a continental climate, with four distinct seasons. The best weather is generally between April and September.\n\nWinters are cold, with temperatures being below zero for a couple of weeks per year, often accompanied with snow (which stays for a couple of days or more at a time). The first snow usually falls in late November/early December.\n\nSprings are short and rainy. On the first warm and sunny day after the winter, usually in March, the people of Novi Sad come out to the city centre to have a drink in a cafe in Zmaj Jovina street, or take a walk on the promenade next to the Danube.\n\nSummers often arrive abruptly, with temperatures above 25°C being very common, starting as early as May. If the weather becomes too hot, you can have a swim at Štrand, a well-maintained public beach on the river Danube, popular with the locals. If you want to have a proper swim, the outdoor pool at Spens is an option. Go early in the morning to avoid the crowds. Short heavy rains occur from time to time in the summer, cooling the air for a couple of hours. The weather remains warm until the middle of September or later.\n\nAutumns arrive usually by the beginning of October, and are not too cold, with the temperatures between 10 and 20°C. Rain is not uncommon in this period, however there are many sunny days too. The leaves changing colours and falling from the trees make Novi Sad quite beautiful, especially in the parks and on the promenade next to the Danube.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nNovi Sad has buses to all the other major cities in Serbia. Buses for Belgrade run every 15 minutes; the quickest zip along the motorway in 90 mins but others take roundabout routes, so the next departure might not be your quickest option.\n\nThere are buses to Sofia in Bulgaria, Budapest in Hungary, Zagreb, Vukovar, and Osijek in Croatia, Sarajevo and Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Budva, Tivat, Podgorica, Herceg Novi in Montenegro. Connections from elsewhere across Europe usually mean changing in Budapest.\n\nFor local and long-distance bus timetables in Serbian and English, visit the web site of JGSP Novi Sad, the city public transport company.\n\nThe bus station is on Bulevar Jaše Tomića 6, next to the railway station. There's ticket kiosks and a cafe, plus adjacent \"Mekdonalds\".\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nNovi Sad has an excellent bus service. A single ride (no transfers) is RSD 65. Tickets can only be purchased from the driver, using cash. Most of the bus lines operate only during the day, from 04:30 until 00:00. Since the bus network plan is not incorporated into Google Maps, it is best to ask a local how to get from point A to B, they will be happy to help out. Yandex app has bus schedules in real time.\n\nThe town center has two main bus stops - one after the underpass in Mihajla Pupina and one in Uspenska by the theatre. You can get from the railway/bus station to the town center with bus lines 4, 10, 14 and 15. 10, 14 and 15 stop in Uspenska, and 4 stops by the underpass. To get to the Štrand beach, take numbers 1 or 8 from either of the stops in the town center. Number 3 will take you from either of the stops to the Petrovaradin fortress - get off on the first stop after the bridge.\n\nOne should also keep in mind that the timetable shown on the bus stops and the website is the timetable for the bus leaving from the starting bus stop of that route, not the current bus stop. However, the timetable can give an idea on how frequent are the buses around a certain part of the day (it varies from every 10 minutes or less during the middle of the day, to every half an hour late in the evenings). If you want real-time information, download the free NSmart app that is, for the most part, pretty accurate."
