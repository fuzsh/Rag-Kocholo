        "text": "Belgrade - Serbia's Capital City\n\nThursday, September 24, 2015\n\nBelgrade, Central Serbia, Serbia\n\nMy bus from Sarajevo to Belgrade left at 6:00 A.M. for the seven hour trip. The first three hours in Bosnia was on winding roads through mountainous country in eastern Bosnia to the border crossing at Zvornik. From the border onwards the landscape flattened out quickly for the rest of the trip onto the pancake flat plain of the Sava and Danube Rivers all the way to Belgrade. After what I've seen so far in the Balkans, the thing that struck me was how neatly tended the Serbian countryside is and how there’s relatively little roadside litter.\n\nOne of the big stories in the news over the last couple of weeks has been the huge influx of refugees from Syria, Iraq, and other strife-torn countries to Europe via a route from Turkey to Greece and on northwards through Serbia . Attempts by Hungary and most recently Croatia to stop the flow through their countries and consequent backups at the border have been very controversial. The first I saw of the migrant crisis was when I arrived at the bus station in Belgrade where a gigantic tent city of refugees waiting for transportation to the EU border has sprung up in the fields around the bus and train stations.\n\nI had been warned that Belgrade is not a pretty city. Some of the comments I’ve heard from people about it are far more negative than that. My initial impressions were in agreement and of a big dull gray city without much of interest. Shortly after booking into a hostel, where it turned out to be easy to get a private room since tourists were generally avoiding the city because of the news of the migrant crisis, I joined a free (with tips) walking tour of the old city. For such a large city with a 2,000 year history dating back to Roman times, there really isn’t that much in Belgrade . That’s largely because the hilltop location of the Kalemagedan Fortress in the town center near the confluence of the Danube and Sava Rivers is of such strategic value that Belgrade has been absolutely leveled to the ground many times in its long history. Although it was far from leveled then, the last bombardment of the city was an aerial one by NATO forces in 1999 during the Kosovo war that lasted for 70 days.\n\nThe tour guide was a hip seeming twenty something named Melica (like Melissa but pronounced in Serbian more like Mehleetsa). After the similarly-aged moderate guide Omer in Sarajevo I was inclined to think that maybe the generation that has come of age since the Balkan wars might have fewer ethnic prejudices and a less nationalistic interpretation of history than earlier ones. Melica proved me wrong. Her comments on Serbian history both ancient and recent were ultra-patriotic and nationalistic, the kind of stuff you might expect from a government guide towing an official line but not from an attractive young urbanite who’s simultaneously talking about Belgrade’s fantastic nightlife and dance and drink until you drop revelry. Her descriptions of the founding of Serbia, the patriotic struggle against the Turks for hundreds of years, and the savaged attacks on her city by NATO supporting Albanian terrorists who had moved into Serbia and multiplied like vermin until they were most of the population in Kosovo were almost funny to listen too . I struggled to keep a straight face at times. I wonder if that’s the history that’s taught in school in Serbia. Melica ended her tour by sharing some of her homemade rakija (brandy), the traditional distilled spirit of the Balkans, with everyone.\n\nOne thing I like about Belgrade is that it’s an inexpensive place to eat and drink. On my first night I had an exquisite four course Serbian dinner with two beers in a very nice restaurant named Manufaktora for about $15 USD. The highlights were an appetizer platter of mixed smoked Serbian meats and cheeses and then something that was called Hunter’s Cutlet on the English menu which was a perfectly cooked pork chop in a sauce of plums, peppers, and bacon. It may have been the best thing I’ve eaten in the Balkans. The food was so good I went back for more the next night! Being back in a Christian country after a fair amount of time in mostly Muslim Albania, Kosovo, and Bosnia I realize how much better life is with pork.\n\nOverall, despite some impressive monumental buildings, Belgrade doesn’t rank very high in the beauty pageant of European cities . Most of it is quite gray and nondescript, although there are a few nice areas like Ulica Skadarska, the street that was the historical haunt of Belgrade’s Bohemian types and is now a cobblestoned pedestrian street of pleasant restaurants and coffee houses where Gypsy musicians play for the patrons in the evening. Kneza Mihaila is the main pedestrian street in the old city, lined with elegant nineteenth century buildings full of nice stores and restaurants and packed with people most of the day.\n\nAmong those monuments is Saint Sava’s Cathedral, which is still under construction. When completed, Saint Sava will be the largest Orthodox church anywhere in the world. It’s currently possible to enter the church, but it’s still just a big, empty, undecorated open space. It’s a big concrete modern construction and will never be anything like the marvels of Saint Peter’s Basilica, the Duomo in Florence, or the huge Gothic cathedrals all around Europe. The goal of building something that’s \"the biggest\" is vaguely authoritarian and dates in Serbia to the era when Milosevich was in power. I’m sure it will be physically impressive when completed but most likely not very attractive artistically compared to the many medieval Orthodox monasteries I saw in Kosovo.\n\nAnother one of Belgrade’s huge churches is also unfinished. Saint Mark’s Church is built to look like the church at the Grabanica Monastery in Kosovo but in massive proportions . It was built in the early part of the twentieth century but also has an interior that was never completed. Belgrade is now also the home of the patriarchate of the Serbian Orthodox Church across from Saint Saborna Cathedral, a typically small but stunningly decorated church that’s considered the most important in Serbia beyond the monastery churches in Kosovo.\n\nOne of Belgrade’s nicest building is the Serbian Parliament, housed again in the same place as it was the last time Serbia was an independent nation unconnected to the other parts of what was for most of 70 years Yugoslavia. Large displays with pictures of the many Serbs killed in Kosovo in the 1998-99 War by “Albanian Terrorists” face the man boulevard in front of parliament with other stating the hypocrisy of the US and EU for ignoring war crimes committed against Serbs during the wars in the 1990s in the Balkans, including the large scale expulsion of Serbs from Croatia and Kosovo. I find many Serbs hold a lot of resentment about having been portrayed as the bad guys during the 1990s wars, but I also suspect many haven’t come to terms with what the Serbian government and armed forces were responsible for in Bosnia .\n\nOne large park in the center of Belgrade has numerous memorials to people killed during the 1999 NATO bombing of Belgrade during the Kosovo War. A man saw me looking at one of them and struggling to figure out what it said in the Cyrillic script. He then asked if he could show me the ruins of the TV station at the edge of the park that was destroyed during the bombing and has been left in its bombed out state as a reminder. He said one of his friends was killed working there and showed me another memorial stone with the names of those killed at the site. He claimed 2,000 people were killed in Belgrade during the bombing, although the information sources I found later while doing some Googling put the total death toll at between 400 and 500, most of which were at military targets in Kosovo rather than Belgrade and elsewhere in Serbia.\n\nBelgrade is also not particularly well endowed with museums for a national capital of around two million people . Usually museums are good places to head on rainy days, as were all my days in Belgrade, but there’s not much to keep a visitor occupied in the rain here. The countdown clock at the entrance to the National Museum of Serbia indicated only 227 days and however many hours, minutes, and seconds until it’s supposed to reopen after years closed for renovation. Belgrade’s most visited museum is one dedicated to engineer and inventor Nikola Tesla who is considered by many to be a much greater visionary about the possibilities for electricity than rival Thomas Edison. The museum, though, is just a few small rooms and guided tour/show on a few of Tesla’s electrical inventions. Serbia is proud enough of Tesla to have named Belgrade’s international airport for him.\n\nSo I had quite extensive plans for Sunday, my last day in Belgrade. I was going to rent a bicycle and the riverside sports center where Novak Djokovic has financed a large tennis complex and ride a route along the Danube and Sava Rivers through New Belgrade and Zemun that my hostel’s owner recommended and mapped out for me . New Belgrade is the large post-WWII extension of the city on the other side of the Sava River built in a mostly Communist style but now infiltrated by much capitalist commercialism, while Zemun is a very historic riverside town a few miles upstream from Belgrade. I was then going to meet up with Melica’s walking tour again, this time the Sunday Communism themed tour that goes to the museum that includes Tito’s mausoleum. The tour was also supposed to go to many other sites related to twentieth century history including sites bombed by NATO in 1999. I was looking forward to some more of Melica’s opinionated commentary to round out the very nationalistic commentary I’ve gotten from guides in multiple countries on this trip.\n\nThe weather didn’t cooperate with any of these plans, however. It rained all day – not very good for either cycling or walking tours. I spent much of the day either in the hostel reading and writing or out at restaurants and bars eating and drinking. Belgrade’s not like Philadelphia where it’s always sunny!"
