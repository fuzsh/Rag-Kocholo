        "text": "The romantic town of Sremski Karlovci is nestled on the northeastern slopes of Fru≈°ka Gora in Serbia. It was the seat of patriarchs and the place of the first Serbian Orthodox School in the Habsburg Monarchy. This town of kuglofs and the wines had a huge role in the cultural and spiritual life of Serbian people for more than two centuries.\n\nHow to get to Sremski Karlovci\n\nThe city belongs to the Serbian autonomous province of Vojvodina. It is located on the right bank of the River Danube, about 11 km far from Novi Sad, and 80 km from Belgrade.\n\nThe easiest way to visit is individually or within excursions organized by local agencies in Serbia. Also, you can take a bus (check the schedule here) or train from Novi Sad to Sremski Karlovci (check the schedule here).\n\nA few words about the history of Sremski Karlovci\n\nThe first mention of Sremski Karlovci dates back to 1308, as a fortress named Karom, built on Roman foundations.\n\nThis area was under the Ottoman rule from the early 16th to the late 18th century. But when the town and this region became part of the Austrian Habsburg Empire, many Serbs emigrated to Vojvodina from other parts of Serbia, as well as the Hungarians, Germans and Romanians.\n\nBy the way, Sremski Karlovci became known in 1699, as the place where the round table was used for the first time in international diplomacy during negotiations. In honour of this memorial day, the Chapel of Peace was erected at the beginning of the 18th century on the hill above Sremski Karlovci. The agreement is known as the Karlovci Peace Treaty. It was signed between the Habsburg Empire, the Russian Empire, Poland and Venice on one side, and the Ottoman Empire on the other.\n\nVojvodina region became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, in 1918, and then renamed Yugoslavia in 1929. After the Second World War, it became an autonomous province of the Serbian Republic, and it has the same status in the Republic of Serbia.\n\nWhat to see and visit in Sremski Karlovci\n\nAlmost all important sights are in the central zone around the Square of Branko Radiƒçeviƒá and within walking distance. The centre is a pedestrian zone, with restaurants, bars and important buildings.\n\nWe visited this charming town after visiting the monasteries of Fru≈°ka gora on one sunny day in October.\n\nThe Patriarchal Court\n\nSremski Karlovci became an important centre of Serbian Orthodox culture after the First Great Migration of Serbs in 1690, and later after the abolition of the Patriarchate of Peƒá (Kosovo) in 1766. In 1713, Karlovci was declared the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitanate.\n\nThe current Patriarch Court was built from 1892 to 1894 by the patriarch Georgije Brankoviƒá. It was built in the style of Italian palaces, with three backyard parts. Well, this is the most impressive building in Sremski Karlovci and probably in Vojvodina.\n\nToday, the Patriarchal Court is the seat of the Bishop of Srem, the Eparchial Administrative Board, and the Ecclesiastic Court. It is a summer residence of the Serbian Patriarch, as well. Uro≈° Prediƒá, the famous Serbian painter, painted the court chapel.\n\nYou can visit the Treasury and the Museum of the Serbian Orthodox Church within the court. There are various valuable items, icons, and works of art from the 18th and 19th centuries. Some items are from destroyed churches in Bosnia and Croatia.\n\nThe fence with iron bars, a wall, trees and flowers surround the court. An interesting old white-marble column is in front of the court, and the Patriarch winery is across the building. In 1920, the new central residence of the Serbian Patriarch was built in Belgrade, and Sremski Karlovci lost its previous significance.\n\nThe Clerical High School of St Arsenije Sremac\n\nThe first Clerical High School of St. Arsenije Sremac was founded by Metropolitan Stefan Stratimiroviƒá in 1794.\n\nToday‚Äôs school is located close to the Patriarch Court. It was built in 1900 by the Patriarch Georgije Brankoviƒá. You can see his bust inside the building. Visits are possible only by appointment.\n\nInterestingly, the entrance staircase is surrounded by two interesting statues of barechested sphinxes.\n\nBehind this building, there is the Theological Seminary, the boarding school for students of the Clerical High School. It was built in 1903 by Patriarch Georgije Brankoviƒá.\n\nThe oldest pharmacy\n\nOn the Branko Radiƒçeviƒá Square, surrounded by cafes, there is one of the oldest pharmacies in Vojvodina.\n\nIt was built in 1890 and it is still working üôÇ\n\nThe pharmacy is known for its specific wooden interior made in Venice. Even today you can see the Latin inscriptions on the wooden drawers. And of course, the cash register is amazing üôÇ\n\nThe Church of Holy Father Nikolai\n\nNext to the Patriarch Court, there is the Orthodox Church of Holy Father Nikolai, built in the middle of the 18th century.\n\nThe interior of the church looks stunning.\n\nJacof Orfein and Teodor Kraƒçun, the famous Serbian icon painters, painted the iconostasis. This is the masterpiece of Serbian Baroque painting in Vojvodina.\n\nIn front of the iconostasis, there is a part of relics of St Arsenius of Srem, the patron of the Eparchy and the Seminary. Also, several bishops were buried in the crypt of this church.\n\nOn the walls, there are several paintings of Paja Jovanoviƒá, the famous Serbian painter.\n\nThe Catholic Church\n\nNext to the Church of St Nikolai, there is the Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Trinity, painted in yellow. It was built in 1768 in the Baroque style and it was restored several times. The church is known for its carved door, but it was closed during our visit.\n\nThe ‚ÄúFour Lions‚Äù Fountain\n\nOne of the town‚Äôs symbols is the ‚ÄúFour Lions‚Äù Fountain.\n\nIt is located close to the churches, and it is a favourite meeting place for both locals and tourists.\n\nThe Baroque fountain was built in 1799 from the red marble. It was renovated in 2007, and the water flows from the jaws of four lion heads.\n\nAccording to the legend, everyone who drinks water from the fountain will come again to Sremski Karlovci.\n\nSomeone says that you can come again and stay, or even get married there üôÇ\n\nCity Hall of Sremski Karlovci\n\nThe impressive building of the City Hall is located across from the ‚ÄúFour Lions‚Äù Fountain and the churches.\n\nThis building was built between 1808 and 1811 in neoclassical style. From its balcony, the Serbian Vojvodina (Dutchy) was proclaimed in May 1848. It was used for various purposes, even as a prison. However, today it is the seat of the Municipal Government of Sremski Karlovci.\n\nKarlovci Grammar School\n\nBehind the fountain, there is a marvellous building of the Karlovci Grammar School.\n\nIt is the oldest high school in Serbia, and probably the most beautiful gymnasium.\n\nThe school was founded in 1791 by metropolitan bishop Stephen Stratimiroviƒá with the permission of Emperor Leopold II.\n\nThe respectable merchant Dimitrije Anastasijeviƒá Sabov and the wealthy citizens of Karlovci helped the bishop with financial resources.\n\nIn the beginning, the school had six grades, four lower and two higher, and the language of instruction was Latin. In 1852, the seventh and eighth grades were added. Interestingly, since 1907, girls could also go to school, but under the control of their parents.\n\nHowever, the present building was built in 1891 with the help of Patriarch Georgije Brankoviƒá and the brothers German and Stevan Anƒëeliƒá. There is a note on the top of the building and above the entrance: ‚ÄúThe Anƒëeliƒá brothers to the Serbian people‚Äù. The Hungarian architect Gyula Partos made a design for this beautiful building combining red and yellow colours on the facade.\n\nI was very impressed by the school building.\n\nUnfortunately, we could not visit the old school library which has over 18,000 books, manuscripts, and magazines. A very valuable item is the phototype edition of ‚ÄúMiroslav‚Äôs Gospel‚Äù. It is the first real and complete facsimile of the oldest Serbian Cyrillic book written in the 12th century.\n\nAlso, there is Volni‚Äôs herbarium from the end of the 18th century, which is the oldest herbarium collection in the Balkans.\n\nBranko Radiƒçeviƒá\n\nMany famous Serbs and intellectuals studied in this school. One of them was Branko Radiƒçeviƒá (1824-1853), the Serbian romantic poet.\n\nHis bust is located in the courtyard of Karlovci school. Also, the main square and the street where the school is located are named after him.\n\nBy the way, his most famous poem is ‚ÄúThe Parting of School Friends‚Äù, in which he wrote about pupils‚Äô games and life in Sremski Karlovci. If you have time, visit the Museum of City to learn more about him. His tomb is located on the Stra≈æilovo Hill, 4 km far from Sremski Karlovci.\n\nKarlovci School today\n\nToday, the gymnasium is a philological school where students learn classical languages (Latin, and Old Greek), but also modern languages, history and geography.\n\nAnd there is one interesting thing about the school. It was a place where the cult Serbian movie ‚ÄúBarking at the Stars‚Äù was filmed.\n\nViewpoint and statue of Du≈°ko Trifunoviƒá\n\nThe city‚Äôs best view is from the hilltop known as the Magarƒçev breg. Prepare to follow the narrow and interesting path of many steps coloured in blue with the inscribed names of various fish on them üôÇ\n\nBut when you reach the top, there is a breathtaking panoramic view of the town, the Danube River, and Fru≈°ka Gora. The viewpoint has two levels, and in the open part, you can see the gilded cross.\n\nOn the second level, you can see the statue of the Serbian poet Du≈°ko Trifunoviƒá (1933-2006).\n\nBy the way, he wrote many beautiful poems which well-known Serbian musicians arranged making popular songs in ex-Yugoslavia. Most people don‚Äôt even know that the lyrics of these favourite songs are the work of Du≈°ko Trifunoviƒá.
