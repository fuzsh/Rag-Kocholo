        "text": "Novi Sad Day trip from Belgrade.\n\nWine tour Northern Serbia.\n\nVojvodina\n\nOur journey through the wide and fertile plains of Vojvodina will take about an hour, before we reach our first destination - Sremski Karlovci. During our pleasant trip, our tour guides will provide you with interesting stories about nature, culture, customs and life of the inhabitants of this beautiful area of ​​our Serbia.\n\nSremski Karlovci\n\nWine tasting\n\nAs soon as we arrive at Sremski Karlovci we will start the wine cellar tour. In the Museum of Viticulture and Beekeeping, our hardworking and kind hosts will welcome us, with a tasting of 6-7 varieties of Fruška Gora wines, homemade honey rakija (brandy) and several types of honey.\n\nAfter all these pleasures, we continue our sightseeing of Sremski Karlovci.\n\nIn the city center, we will visit the fountain \"four lions\" (according to legend, every girl, after drinking cold water from the fountain, soon gets married and stays forever in Karlovac), as well as one of the most beautiful schools in Serbia - the prestigious and famous Gymnasium of Karlovci, Patriarchal Court, Clerical High School of Saint Arsenije, the Orthodox Cathedral of St. Nicholas and much more ..\n\nOnly 20 minutes away from Sremski Karlovci is located our next destination, the Petrovaradin Fortress.\n\nPetrovaradin Fortress\n\nSightseeing tour\n\nLet's explore the Petrovaradin Fortress with our tour guide. Visit one of the most beautiful Danube fortresses and enjoy the beautiful panoramas of the Fruška Gora National Park, the Danube river and the city of Novi Sad. The first fortification above today's Petrovaradin was built during the time of the Romans. The fortress was rebuilt by the Hungarians for their own needs, while the Ottomans took over the largest military campaigns. In the 17th century, after the expulsion of the Turks, the Austro-Hungarian rulers began building a new stronghold on the banks of the Danube, below the fortress. A settlement of merchants, craftsmen and soldiers was founded around the fortress, which was originally called Racko (Raško) - a Serbian village, but was later renamed in honor of the Petrovaradin fortress.\n\nNovi Sad\n\nSightseeing tour\n\nNearby the national park Fruška Gora, on the banks of the Danube, lies the baroque city of Novi Sad, the administrative center of the autonomous region of Vojvodina, with its 300-year history. Novi Sad is the second city in terms of population, but the first in terms of the number of museums and sights in Serbia. In 2021, the city of Novi Sad, together with Timisoara, will officially represent the European capitals of culture. For the first time, in written form, Novi Sad was mentioned in 1694, and today it is rightly called Serbian Athens. The architectural ensemble of the city represents a real wealth of various styles: classicism, neo-gothic, baroque, modern and national.\n\nWe are visiting Trg Slobode, the main square in the city, where all important events are held, holidays are celebrated, concerts are organized and much more. There used to be a main market on the square, but today it is adorned with the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Name of Mary, the City Hall, the Hotel Vojvodina, etc. Danube Street, the most beautiful and most popular, describes the past and the present of the city in the most lovely and collorfully way.In the very beginnings of the development of the city, merchants drove loads along this street, which arrived by river, to the center of Novi Sad. In this historic street, there is a house \"Kod bijelog lava\", the oldest in the city, built-in 1720. Today, it houses the City Library. At the corner of two pedestrian streets, Zmaj Jovina and Dunavska, there are the Episcopal House and the Cathedral Church of the Holy Great-Martyr George. Danube Park - is the most beautiful park in Novi Sad. It has divine flower alleys, trees and plants, an island with blue willows and a pond with swans and ducks.\n\nSalaš\n\nIt is simply unforgivable to be in Vojvodina, and not to visit the salaš. Salaš is traditional restaurant of good and delicious cuisine. In each of them, they are prepare oldest-known recipes. We are convinced that you will visit them again, even secretly. If you want to get to know Serbia, you must also try its famous cuisine, so the salaš is an ideal place which presents Serbian tradition and heritage in the right and authentic way.\n\nDeparture from Belgrade is at 10:00 AM. Return to Belgrade approximately at 18.00 PM.\n\nThe price of the trip depends on the number of people. The price includes tickets for visiting the museum of viticulture and beekeeping, wine tasting, guide services and transfer."
