        "text": "Beyond Belgrade, Serbia’s “second cities” show a side to the country that few travellers expect. Roman, Ottoman and Hungarian influences abound in places where you’re just as likely to discover wild music festivals or hidden riverside beaches as historical ruins. Whether exploring ancient Niš, stately Kragujevac, Art Nouveau Subotica or stylish Novi Sad, there is plenty to see and do – if you know where to go.\n\nHear from locals to find out what makes their city unique, and discover an incredible diversity of people, languages and ideas in towns where East and West freely mingled – and still do to this day. It’s time to meet the other Serbia…\n\nCultured Novi Sad\n\nThere are historic cities, then there are those cities still making history. In 2022, Novi Sad became Serbia’s first European Capital of Culture, a fitting title for an artsy town with a food scene to rival the capital, and whose citizens speak six different languages – and have plenty to talk about.\n\nFor Slađana Velendečić, a curator at the Museum of Vojvodina, its setting is everything. “I live in the city centre,” she explains. “My parents live at the entrance to Fruška Gora National Park. From my house to theirs, I can walk into unspoilt nature in just one hour.”\n\nIt doesn’t stop there, either. The Danube river runs through town, offering quiet riverside escapes. “We have a 5km-long quay and a big city beach,” Slađana explains. “But you can find wild beaches minutes from the centre. Sometimes, I sit near the water, hidden by trees, and I don’t even feel like I'm in a city at all.”\n\nNovi Sad has made an art of the unexpected. Looking at the walls of its Habsburg-built 18th-century Petrovaradin Fortress, you wouldn’t think it was home to one of the biggest music events in Europe. EXIT Festival sees 200,000 annual visitors and has hosted artists ranging from Nick Cave to David Guetta. But the fortress has another surprise, says Slađana.\n\n“It’s become home to one of the biggest art colonies in Europe,” she explains. “The city decided to rent studios within the fortress for free; the artists don’t pay anything, just bills, but they have to open every day, so they’re always there. They love to chat about art and often invite you to lunch.”\n\nThen there’s the food and drink, of which there's plenty of choice on busy Laze Telečkog Street. But if you want to lose the crowds, head to the river, says Slađana: “Fishermen’s island is a small peninsula on the Danube just few minutes’ ride from the city center. These days it is a quiet dining area for locals in a natural setting where you can try excellent fish soup in the local taverns.”\n\nNew beginnings in Kragujevac\n\n“It’s often said that Kragujevac did everything first,” says Ana Petrovic, a local painter whose father was once the city mayor. “This was the first capital of old Serbia in 1818; it had the first grammar school; it had the first theatre … it has always been number one.”\n\nOver the years, Kragujevac evolved from a market town into a cultured city filled with art, music and a stately centre. But it also kept what made it different, says Ana.\n\n“This is a small city. It’s not Belgrade; you don’t need a car to get around, and for us that means it frees up time to live our art: we go to the cinema, the theatre, galleries, and to hear the city’s Accordion Orchestra, which is world-famous. It’s a kind of hedonism,” she chuckles.\n\nThere are certainly some surprise venues. The city’s crumbling 19th-century arms factory, Knezev Arsenal, not only serves as a filming location and military museum, but is also one of the most dramatic festival settings (Arsenal Fest) in Serbia. “We’re a very rock ’n’ roll city,” beams Ana.\n\nKragujevac holds plenty of hidden joys. Milošev Venac, a cluster of historic state buildings, makes for a cultured stroll along the banks of the Lepenica, explains Ana. Its most dazzling sight is the Turkish-style Amidža Konak, one of the last surviving parts of the old palace, which now holds part of the National Museum’s collection. “It’s a perfect place to spend the afternoon,” she says.\n\nHistory (and all that jazz) in Niš\n\nAsk locals what Niš is known for and the answer typically comes as follows: burek (a popular Balkan pastry claimed by the city), Romans and jazz. But, as local teacher Jelena Popovic always says, there’s clearly a number one: “Anyone who tries a burek, always wants another.”\n\nWhen it comes to Roman history, however, one name stands out beyond even the city’s famous pastries. “Several Emperors were born here,” says Jelena, “but the most famous was Constantine the Great, the first Christian Emperor and founder of Constantinople (Istanbul).”\n\nHis 4th-century palace, Mediana, edges the city’s fringes, she explains, and excavations there have uncovered peristyle villas daubed in intricate mosaics that visitors can explore. It’s a site befitting the grandeur of a man who once steadied an empire and ushered in Christianity’s rise across Europe.\n\nJust as impressive is Niš’s fortress, in the centre of town. Its ramparts wrap a leafy park where music lovers gather on balmy August evenings for the much-loved Nišville Jazz Festival, second only to EXIT in terms of size. “I go every year,” says Jelena, slipping into reverie. “In summer it’s warm and peaceful; you can just sit back, shut your eyes and listen.”\n\nIt’s not the only Ottoman relic in the city. “Tinker’s Alley (Kazandžijsko sokače) is the centre of life here,” Jelena enthuses. “It once thrived in the 18th century as a street of artisans; now it’s filled with kafanas (taverns) and cafes. This is where we go out – and it’s a good place to get a burek.”\n\nNis has its quiet side, too, and city’s fringes soon fade into the lush hills and rivers of the Morava Valley. “It’s very peaceful,” says Jelena. “The spa waters of Niška banja, 10km away, are surrounded by gorges and are popular with locals in summer; then there’s the Sultan Trail, a long-distance hike between Sofia and Istanbul that crosses Niš. Walking even part of it is a great way to relax.“\n\nThe making of Subotica\n\n“I am a typical citizen of Subotica,” smiles local tour guide Boris Tot: “My mother is Hungarian; my father is half-Serbian, half-Croatian.” Certainly, when talking about this multi-cultural city on the Hungarian border, heritage often comes up, if only because it’s so visible here.\n\nFor centuries, Subotica was part of Austria-Hungary and a busy trading hub, attracting wealthy figures from all over the empire. They built the city they wanted to live in, commissioning grand Secessionist-style houses and turning Subotica into an Art Nouveau wonder unlike anything else in Serbia.\n\n“Not many people know that we have around 120 buildings built at the beginning of the 20th century in this way,” Boris explains. “The Art Nouveau here is rife with motifs of tulips and lilies, which all come from traditional Hungarian design.”\n\nBy foot is the best way to take it all in, and two buildings, in particular, catch the eye. First is Raichle Palace – “former home of the city’s most prolific architect, Ferenc Raichle,” says Boris – which is now an abode for the city's contemporary art gallery. The second is the Synagogue, a rare example of Art Nouveau used in a religious building – all Murano glass mosaics and Zsolnay-glazed tiles. “It has now been fully restored,” says Boris, “and is now a concert venue as well as a site for visitors.”"
