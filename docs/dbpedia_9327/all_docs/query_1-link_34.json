        "text": "Where is Serbia?\n\nSerbia is located in the southern region of Europe, sharing borders with numerous other European countries. The capital of Serbia is Belgrade, which is also the largest city in Serbia. In geographical size, it's the 111th largest country in the world, with nearly 30,000 square miles of land.\n\nGeography\n\nSerbia shares its borders with eight other European countries: Kosovo, Macedonia, and Montenegro to the south, Bosnia and Croatia to the west, Hungary to the north, and Romania and Bulgaria to the east.\n\nSerbia's geography is very similar to other European countries. It has a mix of fertile valleys and mountains, though Serbia is more mountainous than its neighbors. Its mountain range is the Balkan Mountains, which serve as a natural barrier between Romania and Bulgaria. The highest point for Serbia is Mt. Deravigo, coming in at 700 ft.\n\nBecause of the rough and rugged nature of the majority of the country due to its many mountains, natural lakes are few and far between. Most of the nation 's natural lakes can be found in Vojvodina, which is an autonomous province located in the northernmost part of Serbia.\n\nHowever, due to a human-made dam, Serbia lays claim to a massive artificial lake named Derdap. It's area spans 98 square miles, and is caused by a hydroelectric dam on the Dunabe River.\n\nSerbia is home to a vast flood plain known as the Pannonian, which can be found on the northern borders with Romania, Croatia, and Hungary, and travels south to Belgrade.\n\nThe climate of Serbia is divided between its northern and southern regions. In the north, summers are usually very humid and hot, and winters are generally cold, whereas, in the south, summers are hot and very dry and winters are not only cold but very snowy as well.\n\nPopulation\n\nSerbia has approximately 7 million people making it the 104th largest country by population in the world. Like other European countries, the population is mostly homogeneous, with nearly 90% of citizens identifying with Serbs, with a scattering of different ethnicities mixed in, including Hungarian, Roma, and the Bozniaks.\n\nThe country is mainly homogeneous in its religion as well, with nearly 85% of the population identifying as apart of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Other notable religious groups include Roman Catholics, which makeup approximately 10% of the people and are concentrated mainly in the Vojvodina province. Protestants and Muslims can also be found, making up 1% and 3% respectively of the country's religious following."
