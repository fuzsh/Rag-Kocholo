Driver Bogdan and our guide Nina was so nice to talk and share knowledge. Wine tasting was also great. The lady was so nice and also wines were so good.

Feb 2019. -\n\nGabriel Vargas\n\nNovi Sad & Wine Tasting Tour :)\n\nThe tour was perfect and we had a great time! We booked the tour just one night before but they made sure that we could still join the trip to Novi Sad. Jelena and Sasha picked us up just outside the flat and even had drinks for us! From the very beginning we got to learn more about Serbia and their culture, and at all times Jelena was making sure that we were having a good time. We really enjoyed the wine tasting session and getting to know more about the wine tradition in Serbia. The lady that owns the wine cellar is very nice and friendly! Nina was our guide for the day and she had an answer to all our questions. Religion? Serbia? The region? Nina will have an answer! Jelena, Nina and the drivers are a great team and the level of service they provide is outstanding. Thank you for a great day and for sharing so much about your great country! Hope we can go back soon!\n\n- 08. Feb 2019. -\n\nAmanda Jenkins\n\nGreat day trip to Novi Sad!\n\nWe had a great time visiting the monasteries, wine tasting and Novi Sad with Nina and Sasha!
