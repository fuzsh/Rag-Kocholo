        "text": "Novi Sad, Petrovaradin, Sremski Karlovci\n\nCome with us and explore the northern region, a wonderful piece of land showing the diversity of our country. The tour starts when our guide picks you up at your accommodation in Belgrade. Head to Fruška Gora area, famous national park located 70 km from Belgrade and spiritual heart of the country with 17 functioning monasteries of Serbian Orthodox Church.\n\nHeading to the North, you’ll enjoy the wide, colorful plain of the Vojvodina region. You will notice an isle which “spoils” the simple skyline and the flat morphology of the terrain. This is the Fruska Gora mountain where 17 religious gems of the Serbian Orthodox Church are hidden. We will reveal you one of them which will seduce you with its peace and legacy of the Branković family as the most important benefactor during Serbia’s challenging times, the Turkish siege.\n\nSremski Karlovci\n\nAfter the calm beginning, you will be ready for the more dynamic part of the tour. You will be welcomed by the little, charming town of the Sremski Karlovci, its atmosphere reflecting times in history, its polite citizens, and its unofficial mascot Raša. The Patriarchy Palace, Saint Nikola’s church, and the first Serbian gymnasium established in 1791 are justifying Sremski Karlovci’s title “museum town”. One of the best sides of Karlovci would probably be wine production, and therefore you will have the opportunity to visit a traditional winery and try a local sort of wine!\n\nPetrovaradin\n\nDriving along the right bank of Danube, you will pass a church whose details point to two religions interweaving. Shortly after, walls of the mighty Petrovaradin fortress will meet you. This gorgeous beauty has an impressive underground labyrinth that is still not fully researched. Beside of subterrane organized in four levels, there are also seven of them on a surface. Built as a pillar of Austrian defense from Turkish invasion, Petrovaradin fortress was never conquered, nowadays giving us a chance to enjoy the most amazing view over Novi Sad, to feel the energy of the most prestigious European music festival “Exit”, and to take a photo with the „drunk clock”.\n\nNovi Sad\n\nAs a cherry on top of the cake, walk through the picturesque downtown of Novi Sad, and you will see in the few first steps that this city is a melting point of different nations and ethnic groups, a city with true multicultural ambience. Vivid facades with a specific type of windows, one cannonball in a wall as a remainder, street musicians on each corner, charming passages and a long list of important sights worthy of attention will make you fall in love with this European capital of culture for 2022.\n\nAs a treat at the end of the tour, you will have some free time to explore this city with slow tempo by yourself, to buy some souvenirs or to taste flavours of the local cuisine enriched with the influence from Austria and Hungary.\n\nAfterwards, you will be driven back to your accommodation in Belgrade, hopefully fully satisfied with this new experience!"
