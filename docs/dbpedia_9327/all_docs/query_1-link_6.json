        "text": "Novi Sad is the second largest city of Serbia and the capital of the northern Serbian province of Vojvodina as well as an important industrial and cultural centre. In the 19th century it earned the nickname Serbian Athens (Serb. Srpska Atina) due to its relevance for the local trade and culture.\n\nThe city of Novi Sad was founded in 1694 as a settlement of Serb merchants across the Danube from the Petrovaradin Fortress located on the opposite bank of the river. On 1st of February 1748 the city gained its modern name. It was also granted a royal privilege and proclaimed “free royal city” by Her Imperial Majesty Maria Theresa. The day is celebrated every year to commemorate that event of great importance to Novi Sad. In the late 19th century Novi Sad already possessed a brewery, a silk factory and a tobacco company. In 1849 Matica Srpska, the main cultural-scientific institution of modern Serbia was moved to Novi Sad, twenty years after its foundation in Budapest. The city was bombarded and devastated by the Hungarian troops operating from the Petrovaradin Fortress during the Springtime of the Peoples and was subsequently deserted as the result of the cholera epidemic in 1849. After the Second World War the area of the city was enlarged after the swamps surrounding the Fortress had been dried. In 1999 the NATO bombing destroyed many buildings, the Danube bridges and the urban waterworks that were to be rebuilt in the following years.\n\nNovi Sad is a multicultural city inhabited by many ethnic groups- Serbs, Hungarians, Slovaks, Montenegrins and others. In the city there is also a multilingual radio station as well as Serb language public and private schools for foreigners. Nowadays, Novi Sad is a fast-growing city. The areas and the bridges destroyed during the civil war have been reconstructed and many new buildings are being erected. The number of tourist visiting Novi Sad is constantly growing. In the neighbouring picturesque countryside there is a mountain called Fruška Gora where the Fruška Gora National Park has been established.\n\nTourist Attractions:\n\nPetrovaradin Fortress – built on the right bank of the Danube river.
