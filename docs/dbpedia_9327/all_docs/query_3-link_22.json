        "text": "Sremski Karlovci can easily be reached from Novi Sad via public bus, with the journey taking 20-30 minutes. Specifically, you’ll want to take bus number 62 (or perhaps a couple of other buses in the 60s).\n\nWhile these buses don’t leave as frequently as the regular city buses, the good news is that you don’t need to go all the way to the bus terminal to catch one. I recommend using an app like MoovIt that will tell you exactly which bus number you need and where the closest bus stop is to wherever you are.\n\nThe ticket should cost around 135 RSD. Note that while typical city buses in Novi Sad have a set price no matter how far you’re going, the driver on bus 62 will likely ask you where you’re headed so he knows how much to charge.\n\nArriving in Sremski Karlovci, be sure to snap a picture of the timetable for buses back to Novi Sad.\n\nSremski Karlovci is located within Vojvodina’s Fruška Gora National Park, the country’s oldest. When most people think of national parks, they picture mountains or lush forests, but the wine-making region of Fruška Gora is largely flat.\n\nRather than hiking, the main reason to visit Fruška Gora National Park is for its monasteries. The park is home to no less the 35 medieval monasteries, of which 16 are currently open to the public.\n\nBut if you’re thinking of exploring via public transport you can forget about it. The tourism information office in Novi Sad told me it may be possible to visit some landmarks by bus, though nobody seems to know the routes or timetables for buses running through the park!\n\nIn Sremski Karlovci itself, I was told that taxi is the only option, and that just visiting one nearby monastery would cost me around 2000 RSD. Having already seen plenty of excellent monasteries throughout Serbia, I decided to give exploring Fruška Gora National Park a miss.\n\nAs Serbia’s second-largest city, you’ll find numerous bus routes linking Novi Sad with the rest of the country. Despite having a very different vibe from Belgrade, the two cities are only 90 minutes apart, with buses leaving very frequently.\n\nBelgrade and Novi Sad are also linked by several trains which run throughout the day.\n\nI managed to find a direct bus from as far away as Novi Pazar, while you can also find direct buses from cities like Kruševac and Niš.\n\nInternationally, Novi Sad is connected with many major cities in the surrounding Balkan countries as well as nearby Hungary.\n\nThe bus and train stations are located right next to one another to the north of the city. If you don’t have a lot of luggage, you can easily find public city buses to the center or wherever it is you’re staying.\n\nBut if you opt to take a taxi, beware.\n\nA Warning About Taxis\n\nTraveling with lots of luggage and staying at the other end of town, I decided to take a taxi from the bus station to get to my accommodation.\n\nWhile I’ve traveled more than enough to know how shady taxi drivers at bus stations can be, the one I encountered told me he’d use the meter.\n\nI’d heard from my host that a taxi from the station should only cost 400-500 RSD, but the meter ended up showing 1000!\n\nI wasn’t quite prepared for that, as the last time I fell victim to a rigged meter was many years ago in India. Even worse, the guy even wanted to charge me 50 dinars for putting luggage in the trunk!\n\nStanding in front of my rental apartment, I called the host before handing over any money. The driver was threatening to take me to the police station and kept trying to grab my suitcase. But as soon as a local appeared, he suddenly calmed down and said ‘Okay, okay, 500.’\n\nThe ordeal wasn’t quite over yet, as after taking my money, he began insulting me in Serbian and English and things nearly escalated. Fortunately, though, he got back in his car in drove off before the situation got out of hand. Needless to say, this was a horrible first impression of Novi Sad.\n\nAdmittedly, my guard had been down after my very pleasant experience with a driver the previous day in Novi Pazar. But what is one arriving in Novi Sad supposed to do?\n\nAs ridesharing apps don’t exist in Serbia, be sure to look up a list of official Novi Sad taxi companies online and call them when you arrive at the station. They’ll send you a driver at a fair price."
