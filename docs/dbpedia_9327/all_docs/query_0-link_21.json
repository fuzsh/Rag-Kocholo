Yet, Probus, the Roman emperor knew that the fertile soil was perfect for planting and thus he became the first person to plant grape vines on Fruška Gora. He was the one to introduce wine culture to this region and it is still a very important aspect of today's culture. It is also the Hobby for most locals.\n\nTerrior of Sremski Karlovci\n\nSremski Karlovci wine region is positioned between the hills and forests of the National Park Fruska Gora and the banks of the Danube River. Fruška Gora originated by tectonical movements over millions of years ago when the area was covered by the Pannonian sea. Rocks can be found in most soil samples, particularly at higher levels. The topsoil is mainly made up of loess, a lightweight, coarse-grained sedimentary rock characterized by a very high porosity and low density. Loess types may vary from west to Ilok in the west and east of Sremski Karlovci. Scientific research around the properties of soils and their suitability for certain grape varieties is continuing. Below the loess topsoil, we find layers of limestone. As Fruška Gora's topsoil is filled with nutrients, the best situation for it to be in is when the vines grow older with their roots going deeper and being fed by the nutrient-rich, chalky limestone. This means that the best wines will be produced.\n\nSremski Karlovci Wine Characteristics\n\nKarlovci wines are renowned for their high quality and wide distribution.
