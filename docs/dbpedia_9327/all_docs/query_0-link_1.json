It lies along the Danube River, roughly 9 miles (15 km) southeast of the administrative capital of Novi Sad and on the road and rail routes from Belgrade to Subotica (in Vojvodina) and Hungary.\n\nIn 1698–99 the village was the site of a 72-day congress that ended hostilities between the Ottoman Empire and various European states in the Treaty of Carlowitz. By this treaty, the Habsburgs took from the Turks control of the village and the surrounding region of Vojvodina, which was peopled by Serbian refugees from Ottoman rule. The town also was host in 1848 to an assembly of Vojvodina Serbs who declared the region’s independence from Hungarian rule."
