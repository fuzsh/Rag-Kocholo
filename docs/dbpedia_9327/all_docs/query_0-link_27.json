        "text": "Novi Sad is situated on the Danube river, approximately 80 km northward from Belgrade. This metropolis is acknowledged as the capital of Vojvodina. It takes the position of the second most populous and frequently toured city in Serbia, right after Belgrade. Novi Sad retains a rich historical background, much like Belgrade. Its most renowned landmark is the Petrovaradin Fortress, which is amongst the biggest and most conserved fortresses in Europe. Novi Sad is also famous for being an excellent host city for one of Europe’s premier music events, the Exit festival. The city’s compact and vibrant streets exhibit a robust panonian ambivalence and welcoming nature. Close to Novi Sad is the significant yet petite town of Sremski Karlovci, globally acknowledged for its beautiful Baroque cities and the inaugural Serbian Gymnasium. The expanse around Sremski Karlovci and along the Fruska Gora mountain is abundant with vineyards, where you can explore numerous quaint wine cellars and savor some of Serbia’s finest wines. Your day would encompass exploring Sremski Karlovci with wine tasting, the Petrovaradin Fortress, and the heart of Novi Sad."
