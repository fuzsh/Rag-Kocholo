        "text": "The Novi Sad public transport company runs frequently to Sremski Karlovci under line numbers 60, 61 and 62. You can catch these at the Novi Sad bus station (with a 35 din \"service charge\" to get onto the platform when buying a ticket at the counters) and get off at the Sremski Karlovci railway station. Alternatively, you can get on at Dunavski park or on the first stop in Petrovaradin after the bridge. When catching it, buy a ticket in the front of the bus and pay the driver with cash. A schedule can be found here. This is definitely the cheapest option, with a ticket costing 135 din one-way. Other transport companies also operate services, but these do not stop in town and are more expensive even without the service charge you will have to pay. They are more likely, however, to be comfortable. A schedule can be found here."
