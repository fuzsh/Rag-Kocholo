        "text": "You can’t visit Serbia without dodging the city centre cars and hitting the underground bars in buzzing Belgrade. It would be similarly criminal to skip the candy-coloured former European Capital of Culture, Novi Sad.\n\nBut there’s far more to explore than the capital and its second city. Going deeper into the central and south-western regions of the country delivers fruitful results: colourful cities, glorious gorges and mountains for days.\n\nExplore the 11 best places to visit in Serbia…\n\nBelgrade is a mish-mash of grand architecture, bursts of green spaces, stylish stores, and brutalist buildings on the outskirts of the city. Its daytime to-do list is almost as impressive as the night’s.\n\nFor those not brave (or hip) enough for the clubs, the promenade along the Danube hosts restaurants serving traditional Balkan cuisine with a modern edge – Ambar, in particular, is a must.\n\nWalking is essential, as there is no metro connecting the city’s highlights (that means there are a lot of cars, so keep your wits about you when trying to cross the road).\n\nRead next: First-time guide to Belgrade\n\nWhere Belgrade is busy, Novi Sad is markedly relaxed. The capital of autonomous region Vojvodina, and the jewel of central Serbia, marches to the beat of its very own chilled-out drum. Even when Svetozar Miletic Square in the city centre fills up with, say, a foodie market or a live performance, nobody seems particularly stressed, or in a rush.\n\nStrolling through the centre offers the chance to see grand orthodox churches and the majestic Name of Mary’s rainbow-striped spire – as well as more modern trendy clothing shops, bars with outdoor seating, and a variety of ice cream parlours along Dunavska Street, which leads to a nature fix at the peaceful Danube Park.\n\nThere, you’ll find protected flora and fauna. The city’s museums and art galleries are all a five minute walk away, and a short walk over the river takes you to the city’s piece de resistance: Petrovaradin Fortress. The fringes of the bushy green Fruska Gora National Park can be seen in the distance.\n\nIt’s very possible to visit Fruška Gora, Serbia’s oldest national park, as part of a Novi Sad trip, by bike or by car. It’s worth a trip in its own right, particularly for some of the gems hidden deep within its hills.\n\nOne such out-of-the-way wonder is Novo Hopovo Monastery, a working monastery with a striking yellow exterior . Inside is impressive, but wandering the grounds is the true highlight.\n\nThere are no fewer than 20 monasteries in the park, so if you’re keen you can plot a route or book a monastery tour. Whatever your decision, prepare your quiet voice, keep your knees and shoulders covered, and be respectful of the rules\n\nOf course, there’s more to Fruška Gora than monasteries. Appreciate the sheer greenness and endless flow of the hills from up above at one of its excellent, and supremely well-priced, wineries. Vinarija Kovačević comes highly recommended. The wine, and the food, is the perfect complement to the view.\n\nOver the river from Novi Sad is Sremski Karlovci, one of Vojvodina’s most famous – and attractive – towns. It’s fairly easy to reach from Petrovaradin Fortress. The two combined make a rather tidy day trip.\n\nIt offers the usual: historic and picturesque churches, a sweet town square, plenty of green space, but also boasts impressive vineyards, some of which can be visited by the public.\n\nThe town is also host to some Serbian traditions: the poetry festival Brankovo Kolo, a festival devoted to the tasty, ring-shaped German cake Gugelhupf, and a special superstition: those who make a wish in the town’s Four Lions fountain are foretold to return and marry in Sremski Karlovci one day.\n\nThough Subotica sounds like the name of a metal band, its actually another of Vojvodina’s pastel-coloured cities.\n\nIt’s best visited during sunny months (May to September), to highlight its fairy tale charm, enjoy its abundance of gardens and make the most of the lovely Lake Palic.\n\nOne thing to look out for is its abundance of Art Nouveau gems, particularly the city hall, dream-like synagogue and the quirky Raichle Palace. You’ll struggle to get bored walking around Subotica, and simply admiring the view.\n\nThe town of Topola in central Serbia is a lengthy drive from the capital and the autonomous region of Vojvodina, but it’s worth it for those seeking Serbia’s lesser-visited sights.\n\nOne of which is Oplenac, also known as St George’s Church, a commanding white building with several domes, which you’ll reach after a steep walk and quick stroll through a quiet park.\n\nOplenac is actually a mausoleum, the final resting place of members of the Serb and Yugoslavian royal Karađorđević dynasty. Inside, the mausoleum is adorned with delicate religious mosaic designs, from ceiling to floor. Quite the spectacle.\n\nOnce you’ve taken in this historic building, a short 10-minute drive away is the Aleksandrovic Winery. One of Serbia’s most important, visitors are able to tour the wine cellars, and of course enjoy a tasting of the winery’s finest. The Trijumf white or sparkling is a must.\n\nIf you need a reason to head west, the Ovcar-Kablar Gorge may well be it. Nestled underneath Ovcar and Kablar mountains, the gorge goes deep: 710 m below Ovcar and 620m below Kablar.\n\nYou’ll want to hike up either mountain to see the gorge in its full glory, and to enjoy views over all of the West Morava valley.\n\nTara is an area of natural beauty in western Serbia, first proclaimed a national park in 1981. Perhaps best known as the home of flowing Drina River Gorge, there’s another reason to visit Tara NP: the brown bears.\n\nIt has approximately 50 brown bears, the biggest number in all of Serbia, So, it’s very possible to catch one of these creatures in one of the park’s four dedicated feeding stations, with the help of a local guide.\n\nBear-watching tours are available whether you’re staying in the region or keen to trip it from Belgrade or Novi Sad. Each lasts a couple of days and involves a sleepover in a bear hide made of wood, with some hi-tech wildlife cameras on the go.\n\nOf course, if you’re all out of luck, then a whistle stop of Tara’s highlights, a day at Perucac Lake and a virtually visitor-free hike through the rolling hills will more than make up for it.\n\nNow on to south-western Serbia. The town of Ivanjica is worth a stop, if only for a browse around the main streets, before experiencing the underground magic of the Hadzi-Prodan Paleolithic caves, and learning about its long history in the neighbouring museum.\n\nAn hour and 10 minutes in the car will take you on to Mount Golija, the highest and most impressive in the region. The mountains, thick with forest, envelope you as you drive – or stop in a hillside restaurant to enjoy the view – and are impossibly rich, lush and green in the summer. In winter, Golija becomes a picturesque skiing spot.\n\nWithin the mountain range lives the first Biosphere Reserve in Serbia: Golija-Studenica. In it are natural springs, three lakes, and a variety of flora and fauna to be protected. And whatever the weather, whichever angle you’re looking at Golija from, you’re practically guaranteed one of nature’s finest: a glorious, calming pink sunset.\n\nNiš is the third largest city in Serbia, and its biggest attraction? Well, it’s a little less candy-coloured than you might expect… it’s called Skull Tower (Ćele Kula), and it’s as terrible as it sounds.\n\nSkull Tower is a stone tower, comprised of human skulls embedded into the walls. It built by the Ottomans in the early 1800s, after a great battle for the freedom of Niš, as a warning never to rise against the Empire again. There are over 900 skulls in total.\n\nIf skulls aren’t for you, head into the town to enjoy sightseeing easier on the eyes (and stomach): Niš Fortress, Niška Banja park and the close-by Jelašnica Gorge are all noteworthy stops. There are plenty of kafanas (bars) to eat & drink the local fare once you’re all walked out."
