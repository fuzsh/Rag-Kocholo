        "text": "Visit Serbia’s second biggest city Novi Sad and it’s Petrovaradin fortress and small baroque town of Karlovci with The Chapel of Peace. Wine tasting included!\n\nFirst we will visit Krusedol Monastery (XVI c.), legacy of the last Serbian despot family of medieval Serbia and spiritual center of migrated Serbs.\n\nSremski Karlovci is a small and historic town located 11 km south-east of Novi Sad. Known for baroque architecture and wine production Sremski Karlovci represents the place of preservation of the Serbian culture in the 18th and 19th centuries. Most important building The Chapel of Peace, stands on a hill at the south end of the town. This building commemorates the signing of the Treaty of Karlowitz, that brought peace between the Turks and the Austrians. The current chapel was built in 1817. and mimics the shape of a Turkish military tent with four entrances. The Chapel’s windows are said to be patterned on the Union Jack flag – a nod of recognition to Britain, which was a cosignatory of the treaty that was eventually signed after 72 days of careful negotiation.\n\nNovi Sad, second biggest city in Serbia and capitol of Vojvodina province, has always been a centre of culture and learning. Atmosphere of its small but elegant city centre seems somehow little more refined than Serbia capitol – Belgrade. The city of Novi Sad most striking feature is the Petrovaradin Fortress, sitting across the Danube in the Petrovaradin town. Petrovaradin Fortress is also temporary site of famous awarded music festival – EXIT. The EXIT festival was founded in 2000. in the University park as a student movement, fighting for democracy and freedom in Serbia and the Balkans. Since then, every July, Petrovardin Fortress is EXIT’s home. Novi Sad city centre has a number of noteworthy buildings and monuments, mostly in the Baroque style, with some excellent museums and art galleries.\n\nTo experience this tour, just fill the booking form below and click on BOOK MY TOUR NOW button – you will receive an answer asap."
