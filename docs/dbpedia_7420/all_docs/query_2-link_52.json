        "text": "Sunday, June 19th, 20227:17 pm\n\n[shezan]\n\nThe American Boy\n\nDaniel Mendelsohn, the classicist and translator of the Iliad, finally wrote about his correspondence with Mary Renault from the 1970s until her death, in a moving piece in the New Yorker I have only now come across. It is wonderful.\n\n\"...Like all writers, Renault spent much of her time alone; a good many of her friends, as I also learned later, were gay men, often ballet dancers and actors and theatre people. What she did not have in her life, as far as I know, was children—or students. I wonder whether she wished for some. (In “The Charioteer,” Laurie is described as someone who “usually got on with strong-minded old maids”; was that how she saw herself?) Shrewdly drawn scenes of apprenticeships, of actors or princes or poets learning their craft, figure in a number of the novels. In “The Last of the Wine,” Socrates, faced with an earnest, if pretentious, student, resorts to “teasing him out of his pomposities”—as canny a characterization of what it’s like to teach freshmen as any I know of.\n\nRenault’s special feeling for the relations between a teacher and a student imbues the poignant finale of “The Mask of Apollo,” her 1966 novel about an Athenian actor who gets mixed up in Plato’s disastrous scheme, in the three-sixties B.C., to turn a corrupt Sicilian tyrant into a philosopher-king. Years after the fiasco, the actor meets the teen-aged Alexander, already charismatic and alive with curiosity about the world, and realizes, wrenchingly, that this youth would have been the ideal student for Plato, now dead:\n\nAll tragedies deal with fated meetings; how else could there be a play? Fate deals its stroke; sorrow is purged, or turned to rejoicing; there is death, or triumph; there has been a meeting, and a change. No one will ever make a tragedy—and that is as well, for one could not bear it—whose grief is that the principals never met.\n\nI wonder whether something like this was in Mary Renault’s mind that day in December when she decided to write back to me after all. Maybe she liked the thought of having a student—someone to tease out of his pomposities. Maybe, with all that grief around her just then, she thought she could at least avoid the grief that comes of never making contact....\"\n\nThe American Boy\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/01/07/the-american-boy\n\nMonday, November 19th, 20123:38 pm\n\n[penina_45]\n\nMary's letter to me, 1977\n\nDear Mary Renault Fans,\n\nI am so pleased to find others who respect and love the grand master of ancient historical novels as I do for all she has given us. I read several of her novels, but The Charioteer set during WWII in England stayed with me long after I read it in high school. I would say I was about 16 or 17 then, but I had no idea what I was reading. I had never heard of men with men in a sexual context. All I could think of was that beautiful kiss Laurie shared with Andrew and how he wished he could tell him something. The flow of the words kept me reading and wondering. That was about 50 years ago. It took reading on the Mary Renault fic site in LJ last week for me to completely understand TC, The Persian Boy and others. I loved her style and descriptions, but she always held back. In 1977, when I was 32, I wrote her and told her some of this. Here is her reply. I am sure she wouldn’t mind that I’m sharing this with you now. Thank you all again, for your wonderful efforts and pics of Alexander, Hephaestion and especially Bagoas. I hope you all got to see the most complete Stone Alexander, with all of Bagoas’s scenes put back. Fran’s voice is as charming as the rest of him.\n\nMy four published novels can be found at web site www.peninakeenspinka.info if you care to look them up. I’ve never attempted Renault fan fiction. As much as I love her and her writing, I couldn't do it. My published novels are my own, but my fan fiction in ff.net can be found under Vampire Reader. I’m improving those stories and changing the names since I wrote them for Moonlight, a vampire TV show of 2008. I hope to get at least one or two of them published. The one set in Babylon makes me think of Bagoas, but that was Iraq. He lived in Iran and this story was before his time. I love good vampire stories, especially Chelsea Quinn Yarbro’s Saint Germain. I wish we were allowed to ff him, but she is against it.\n\nHere is Mary Renault’s letter to me. I am copying her punctuation. Only her signature was in ink, and after 35 years, it is a little faded. The original will stay in my jewelry box.\n\nBest to all,\n\nPenina Spinka\n\n9th Feb. 1977.\n\nDear Mrs. Aberman,\n\nIt was very good of you to write so generously about my books. I do seem to have collected some rather young readers from time to time, but I don’t ever remember hearing from anyone who cut their milk-teeth on THE CHARIOTEER – as you say, it certainly wasn’t intended for children, though it’s mild stuff indeed compared with about half the contemporary fiction one reads today; in fact I wonder from time to time what people of the age you were, who I suppose are often reading them, do make of all these very explicit accounts of sex, and whether it turns them off as I think it would have done me at 12 or ever older.\n\nThe hospital in THE CHARIOTEER was drawn from life; it was one of the emergency ones run up early in the war, and very makeshift they were. We did have CO orderlies and some of the background situations are real but the main characters are all invented. Trying to copy characters in depth from real persons is very restricting, and I think very few writers ever do it except in satire, which is two-dimensional.\n\nI have had one book out since THE PERSIAN BOY. It’s not a novel. It’s called THE NATURE OF ALEXANDER and is a straight biography, with illustrations.\n\nAll good wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signature) Mary Renault\n\nTuesday, January 12th, 20108:09 am\n\n[grondfic]\n\nThe King Must Die Slashfic: He Will Forget, and Only I Will Remember Part 2\n\nTitle: He Will Forget, and Only I Will Remember (title taken from Canon - spoken by Chryse)\n\nFandom: The King Must Die by Mary Renault\n\nPairings: Hippon/Theseus\n\nRating: Moderately hot.\n\nDisclaimer: All Rights Reserved.

As I type, you can't find out what the Amazon sales ranking of most works that mention homosexuality is now. Heather Has Two Mommies, a children's book about a gay family, for example, has been deranked. So has Brokeback Mountain. And so has The Charioteer.\n\nBecause their sales ranking mechanism is used by their search engines, this affects search results (the deranked works won't list on the first or even the third page, in many cases, because the system decides that they're not popular) and thus affects sales results for those authors.\n\nIn effect, Amazon has decided to hide all works that discuss LGBT themes from customers, in order to avoid offending the homophobic part of its customer base. Here's a list of books they have thus censored access is can be found here. Read the L.A. Times article on this.\n\nYou can sign a petition against this disgusting policy of bigoted censorship.\n\nAnd it might be even more effective to write them directly. Contact connect-help@amazon.com.\n\nOr write to their CEO:\n\nJeffrey Bezos\n\n1200 12th Avenue South\n\nSeattle\n\nWashington 98144-2734\n\nUnited States\n\nPhone: 206-266-1000\n\nFax: 206-622-2405\n\nThere's a depression on. They should FEAR angry customers voting with their mice. If the perfect storm currently unfolding on Twitter right now about what cyberspace calls Amazonfail is any indication, they are going to be bitch-slapped. You can help!\n\nETA: Best (and funniest) post about the whole debacle by copperbadge, here.\n\nI do think some portion of this is sloppy programming, but there's no way this was a computer glitch. Amazon was aware of this at least a few days ago and did shit-all about it until someone started shouting. Presumably, somehow, they expected the internet wouldn't care. The internet. Which is not at all famous for its ability to TOTALLY OVER-REACT TO EVERYTHING, would not care about the biggest bookseller in cyberspace hatin' on the gays. Perhaps because Amazon is ancient, in internet terms -- it was one of the first major internet retailers and I would not be shocked if many of its higher-ups are not familiar with the internet as it exists today. [...]\n\nWhat nobody seemed to comprehend is that if you shenanigan the internet, the internet generally shoots you in the face. That's the Chicago way! They pull a knife, you pull a gun. They send your gay lit to the bottom of the sales ranking, YOU SEND THEIR STOCK VALUE TO THE MORGUE!\n\nFriday, February 22nd, 200811:43 pm\n\n[shezan]\n\nNew AU Alexander art sent by yoshikihide\n\nyoshikihide, who lives in a country which bars access to LJ, has sent us another gorgeous piece of art by her friend Doves.

I'll be \"properly\" reccing this fic in an upcoming post (a friend asked for some Charioteer fic recs and I'm still working on the list), but for now I'll just say it's of the good and I think every Renault fan should read it :)\n\nETA: Post too large for LJ (ugh), so I had to split it.

Throughout the book, he will, in fact, call Laurie \"Spud\", not \"Laurie,\" and it will turn out that what saves both of them is precisely what they have in common from school, starting with the bathroom scene with Sandy, when Laurie reflects that Ralph's school-like \"casual accolade\" (for coping with the mess) \"looked strange in this hole-and-corner, squalid setting, touched still as it was with confident assumptions and open skies.\" (I love that felicitous phrase, confident assumptions and open skies, it reminds me, among other passages, of Lord Peter's century in the Murder Must Advertise staff cricket match.) Later, during their driving interlude, Ralph says that \"the further [he] go[es] away, the more patriotic [he] gets. Believe it or not, in Adelaide once I had quite a heated argument with some local who spoke lightly of the English public-school system.\" School and country are indistinguishable here - and they seem to be Ralph's own self-denied Eden, far more powerful than Andrew's orchard.\n\nTuesday, August 22nd, 20063:49 pm\n\n[coughingbear]\n\nBull from the Sea on the radio\n\nRadio 4 are doing The Bull from the Sea, last week and this week, as their Afternoon Reading.
