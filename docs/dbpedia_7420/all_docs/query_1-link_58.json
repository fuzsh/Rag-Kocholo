        "text": "As Funeral Games opens, Alexander the Great lies dying. Around his body gather the generals, the provincial satraps and the royal wives, already competing for the prizes of power and land. Only Bagoas, the Persian boy mourning in the shadows, wants nothing. Tracing the events of the fifteen years following Alexander’s death, Funeral Games sees his mighty empire disintegrate, and brings Mary Renault’s Alexander trilogy to a dramatic close.\n\nBook Cover Type: Paperback\n\nISBN : 9789643114404\n\nLanguage(s) : Persian (Farsi)\n\nPersian Title: کتاب مراسم تشییع اثر ماری رنولت\n\nThe Book “Funeral Games” is written by Mary Renault. Mary Renault (4 September 1905 – 13 December 1983), born Eileen Mary Challans, was an English writer best known for her historical novels set in ancient Greece. In addition to fictional portrayals of Theseus, Socrates, Plato, and Alexander the Great, she wrote a non-fiction biography of Alexander. Eileen Mary Challans was born on 4 September 1905 at Dacre Lodge, 49 Plashet Road, Forest Gate, Essex (now in London). She was the eldest daughter of physician Frank Challans and Mary Clementine Newsome Baxter Challans. She had one younger sister, Francis Joyce Challans, whom Mary always felt was the favourite daughter. Mary had a comfortable, yet strained childhood. Her parents had a contentious relationship and her father was neglectful of his children. Renault was educated first at Levick family school and Clifton Girls School in Bristol. She read English at St Hugh’s College, Oxford, then an all-women’s college, receiving an undergraduate degree in 1928. In 1933 she began training as a nurse at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford. During her training she met Julie Mullard (1912 – 2006), a fellow nurse with whom she established a lifelong romantic relationship."
