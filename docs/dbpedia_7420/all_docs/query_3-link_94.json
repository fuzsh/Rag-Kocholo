        "text": "In the mystical land of Greece, where ancient history and breathtaking beauty intertwine, a guide like Ioanna Kalypso Glypti is the key to unlocking the secrets of the past.

Allow her to be your guide, and you will undoubtedly experience the magic and mystery of these lands in a way that will forever remain etched in your heart.\n\nOctober 20, 2022\n\nOur tour guide, Ioanna Kalypso Glypti, is probably the best tour guide I have ever experienced. She has an incredible wealth of knowledge, is crystal clear, and is theatrical enough to make history comprehensive and enjoyable. I loved the way she made her explanations personally relevant to all the cultural, religious, and linguistic groups on tour. The day trip included the Arkadi Monastery, the Archeological Museum of Eleftherna, the Margarites potters’ village, and lunch at the house of Polios folk museum. We received an excellent introduction to Cretian history and culture while enjoying beautiful views and a warm social atmosphere.\n\nRead more in pedagogytoshare.com\n\nNikki Aharonian\n\n15 January 2022\n\nGreat guides are hard to find.\n\nMost guides know their facts. They’ll tell you when something was built, or by whom, and will obligingly recite the contents of the brochure or the guidebook. Better guides are also good storytellers. They’ll throw in a few anecdotes, some fun trivia, and a joke or two to keep it lively and engaging.\n\nAnd often, that’s enough. After all, most travelers have come to see the attractions, not listen to the guide. Let the site speak for itself. Res ipsa loquitur. But Ioanna is unique. She has the ability to transport you away from the crowds, far from coach buses and selfie sticks, all the way to four thousand years ago. With words, she rebuilds ruined palaces, restores faded mosaics, recreates forgotten ceremonies, and you’re an observer, not a visitor, a participant, not a tourist.\n\nHer breadth of knowledge is outstanding. As easily as she moves you in time, she whisks you thousands of miles to faraway lands, drawing cultural parallels from societies all over the globe, ancient and modern, to help you gain better understanding – and deeper appreciation of your experience. And while doing so – she keeps you constantly engaged, so you’re not listening to a lecture, you’re conversing with a friend.\n\nWe are avid travelers and have worked with hundreds of guides. Ioanna is, without a doubt, one of the very best we have ever encountered, and one of the most interesting people we’ve ever met. But fair warning – her love for Crete is so infectious, she’ll make you fall for it too! So you might have to come back again and again and again…\n\nAnon\n\nThe only way to visit and understand Knossos is to have Joanna Kalypso Glyptis as your guide. “Kalypso” in ancient Greek means “she that conceals”; a complete misnomer – Joanna herself is quite the opposite. She is the best historical guide we have ever used, anywhere. She is equipped with an extraordinary depth and breadth of knowledge of Middle East, Egyptian and Mediterranean culture, language and history. She draws a powerful picture of the emergence and decline of Minoan culture and the impact of the bull on mankind’s shift from hunter gatherer to agrarian domesticity. Joanna connected the dots for us across Iranian, Egyptian, Phoenician and Indo-European tribes and migration, and gave Knossos context.\n\nShe challenges old dogma and myths and brings fresh insights into the role of women, and new interpretations of the roles of gods, witches and divines which interweave and embellish all religions. Her historical portrayal of Sir Arthur Evans and his unearthing of Knossos is revelatory. Joanna vividly emphasises the power of language and communication to cause major cultural shifts. Her own linguistic and intellectual prowess made our brains fizz.\n\nGordon Ferris\n\nAn elaborate, detailed historical overview as I have never hoped to experience.\n\nSmart lady, knows her stuff and because she really loves what she does, she does it so well.\n\nI would recommend anytime!\n\nWell done Ioanna!!!\n\nA tour to the Island of Spinalonga with Ioanna was a memorable tour. A heart warming tour, an eye opening tour, not only into Crete and Spinalonga, but also an experience of ones inner soul.\n\nThank you Ioanna!\n\nArriving on Crete, most people will be excited to discover the beauty of the island and of course, million solutions can be found. However, sometimes it is difficult to select the expected quality. For sure, the 1618 Travel can cover the top expectations bearing in mind the fact that the company provides a wide range of services, including sightseeing privet tours, event organization, etc. The highly qualified unique members of the team will help you to schedule in advance your stay on Crete and the areas around (ex. Santorini) as well as to give you the possibility to taste and feel Crete! I had the possibility to be guided by the amazing Ioanna Kalypso Glypti and for sure my trips to Knossos and Spinalonga, Heraklion and Rethymno town will stay unforgettable. Once again THANK YOU IOANNA!\n\nTowns, temples, textiles and even tasty treats were all to be had on tour with 1618 Travel Private Tours! Ancient history was made relate-able and relevant and, delivered with such clarity and conviction that each person in my group was transfixed if not transported. Highly recommend!\n\nWe have had unforgettable day with conversable and nice guide Ioanna, who has considerable experience of work and extensive knowledge of history. Our excursion was very informative and exciting. We would like to say thank you to 1618 Travel Private Tours for competent work!\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nI had the chance to savor the best of Crete in 3 visits all of which in the company of the experienced tour guide Ioanna Kalypso Glypti.As a professional travel editor for the past 15 years I was amazed by her knowledge, her love for the land and the people and professional ethos.This summer she gave me deep insight information concerning Spinalonga, the renovated Herakleion museum (a definite must), picturesque Aghios Nicholaos and Rethymno.But what was truly reveling was our tour last spring during Carnival in the countryside of Rethymno!She was the right person to open all of the closed doors to Byzantine chapels,the ancient site of Eleftherna (which is due to open to the public for the first time in June 2016) as well as narrate truly interesting stories on carnival traditions and festivities.Ioanna Kalypso is definitely going to be my choice whenever I visit Crete.My next goal?The antiquities of Lassithi and southern Crete!\n\nI’ve had to opportunity to tour the World working as a musician on many luxury cruise ships, visiting many exotic and romantic ports. One of the benefits of my job is I get to go on ship tours as an “Escort.” I take notes of the itinerary, the timing, the Guest’s reactions and the competence of the Professional Tour Guide. After several hundred tours I consider myself well-versed in evaluating these tours.\n\nOne of my most memorable and enjoyable times was when I was on a four month tour with RCCL “Independence of the Seas” We stopped in Crete every 10 days. This Island has fascinated me for its incredible history and mythological genesis. The Head God of Greek Mythology “Jupiter” was born there and the Minoan civilization flourished until the volcanic explosion on Santorini wiped them out. (I’ve been scuba diving in the caldera left from the eruption, nice dive!)\n\nI was fortunate enough to be on tour 3 or 4 times with Ioanna as our Professional Tour Guide. It was such a treat to see her work, as I very much appreciate top-flight professionals with that extra non-definable element that makes their work so special and enjoyable. Not only is her knowledge of History and Archeology vast, her delivery is spellbinding and intriguing. She has a rare ability to imbue seemingly innocuous sites with historical perspective and adds excitement and wonder to the tours. An eloquent and passionate speaker, she enthralled the guests and made everyone gratified and fulfilled.\n\nFor connoisseurs and Adventurers, her work got a 5Star rating every time!\n\nThank You Ioanna, for sharing your very special world, and your very special gifts with us!\n\nHope to be on tour with you in Crete soon!\n\nWe spent one week at a hotel close to Rethymnon and after a web search for a guided tour , we came across Ioanna Kalypso. What an amazing guide. Excellent English, polite and friendly , met us at the Loggia on time. We booked a city tour in the old part of Rethymnon and Ioanna shared all the insights of this beautiful city … Overall a great experience , Ioanna brought to life all that history of Rethymnon and made it interesting for our children.\n\nI visited Crete for the first time in May 2015 with PTS and my group and I were more than fortunate in having as a tour guide a young lady – Ioanna K Glyptis whose knowledge of the Island was most impressive without any reference to notes we were continually regaled with facts and figures in a way that we could relate to the places we visited. The Temple of knossos is impressive as was the archaeology museum adjacent to Rethymno Castle and it was a pleasure to be guided through the countryside with stops at local Tavernas for refreshment and discussion.\n\nWe are fans of active rest and we were looking for different tours to get acquainted with new places and rich history of the island. This year we’ve used services of “Tour Guides Crete” to see two fundamental monasteries of the island which are “Arkadi Monastery” and “Monastery of Preveli” .This private tour took us one day and brought a lot of positive emotions. Since August in Crete is a very hot month, we were pleasantly surprised by the fresh wind and the beauty of the gorge Kourtaliotiko through which our way laid. This tour was very interesting and informative. Ioanna provided us with a detailed history of the monasteries and the island in general. It should not go unmentioned that she has a very responsible attitude to her work and deep knowledge of history and archeology. We got an unforgettable experience. As to the organization of the tour I should say that it was carefully planned fully in line with our wishes. We had a diner in a lovely restaurant where we tasted local cuisine on the advice of our guide and at the end of the day, we went down to the palm grove to refresh in the river water after a hot day. We are very grateful to Ioanna for the day and the memories we got and for her warm relationship. Next year we plan to visit Knossos and Phaistos with her. We are looking forward to the new summer vacation.\n\nI have been to Chania center with Ioanna Kalypso and spent a great time wondering through it’s old beautiful narrow streets accompanied by a friendly and open guide with extensive work experience. It was not my first time in Chania but she showed me a lot of interesting historical places and I’ve learned a lot of new about the modern life of the city and about it’s past. It was a great experience for me. Excursion was guided on the high level. That was just amazing.\n\nI went on excursion guided by Ioanna Kalypso Glypti to the west part of the island. Following the northwest coastline, and turning south before Rethymnon, we reach the Monastery of Arkadi, a supreme symbol for Cretans: Freedom or Death. Due to its isolated situation it has been used throughout history as a centre for resistance movements. But most impressing was Ioanas knowledge about the place and the way she presented it to us. Honestly speaking I am not that interested in history, but Ioanas ability to touch people deeply convinced me very much. That is why I also followed her to Knosos. I highly recommend to check out her service.\n\nI had the most marvelous vacation on the lovely island of Crete this past summer. I owe it all to our lovely tour guide Joanna Glyptis. Her English was impeccable and her knowledge of the area was very handy as she knew just the best places to eat. In Heraklion she took us to a lovely little tavena called Antipodas where we had the local Cretan foods. Oh how I love Greek salad.We then moved on to Rethymno where we ate at Gregori taverna and more Cretan specialties such as chicken with greens. Most tours I’ve been on feel exactly as that,just tours. But Joanna’s warmth made the days truly special. On a scale of 1-10 I’d give her a 20.\n\nLast summer I toured with a group of 18 women to Crete. We were so fortunate to have Ioanna as our guide for the week. Her expertise on Crete , Greek history , the culture surpassed any guide I have had on my many travels. We explored the beautiful museums of the area and she peaked your interest with her extensive knowledge that kept the group so engaged with questions and wanting more.. Ionana was always available to help us order Crete’s Amazing food and always with a smile. I highly recommend Ioanna.\n\nAs an archaeologist introducing sites to British ex-pats here on the island, I can only attempt such ventures in the company of a credited Guide. We were put in touch with Ioanna Glypti. Which was extremely lucky for us. In that I had unwittingly found someone with extensive and practical skills in organization (she did much to help the tours run smoothly, and the statutory permits), as well as a lively and inquisitive turn of mind. She is personable, knowledgeable and professional. Her approach embraces both the ‘traditional’, further enlivened and expanded by her own interests in the social aspects of these worlds. And other quirky matters.\n\nThus, when we were on site, it was possible to enthuse our audience with two different viewpoints – one resolutely archaeological and the other from a complimentary social angle. Not that IG was in any way lacking on the historical-archaeological aspects, as was demonstrated when as a bonus she organized a side-trip to one of the many Byzantine churches in the Amari valley. There she had to be translator and guide: accomplished with no problems. I know from the reports of the same ex-pat group that they have taken several other trips with her within and without the cities of West Crete .. and been delighted by her personality, dedication and professional skills alike. Since she loves a discussion (two-way), she welcomes and encourages sensible participation from her groups. Give her a whirl!!"
