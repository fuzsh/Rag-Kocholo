        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nGLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies 10.1 (2003) 23-46\n\n[Access article in PDF]\n\nLesbian Migrations\n\nMary Renault's South Africa\n\nLisa L. Moore\n\nHow can a postnational lesbian and gay literary history understand its imperialists and sexual conservatives as well as (or sometimes simply as) its resistance fighters and brave pioneers? This question, perhaps unanswerable in the abstract, has become increasingly pressing as the globalization of queer culture—through international gay media, human rights organizations, and even queer film festivals—brings the sexual practices and social histories of worlds once deemed separate into intimate contact. In this essay I examine a moment in which Mary Renault, probably the twentieth century's best-selling lesbian writer, made two crucial and related decisions: to abandon the contemporary setting of her first six books for that of homosexual ancient Greece in the historical novels that were to secure her legacy, and to move from England to South Africa in the wake of World War II's devastation of Europe. These two forms of distance—one literary, one geographic—help us understand some of the difficult features of Renault's position in the history of gay and lesbian literature; they also show us, in practical terms, the shortcomings of the ethos of celebration that often marks our studies of queer writers of the past. This essay also seeks to explore the still little-examined connections between lesbianism and colonialism, the latter a term most often discussed in relation to male homoeroticism in the annals of gay and lesbian studies. The case of Renault challenges us to assess a lesbian literary pioneer who disavowed gay rights, considered women lesser artists than men, and benefited from the racial exploitation and segregation codified in apartheid.\n\nThere are telling resonances between two contemporaneous forms of distantiation in which Renault engages in the late 1940s: her decision to write historical fiction and her emigration to South Africa.1 The motives for each decision were complex and overdetermined; Renault's style in the British fiction of the 1940s does not constitute a simple prediction of her geographic relocation at the [End Page 23] end of that decade. Sketching in the distinct aesthetic and historical trajectories of which Renault's Greek fiction and her move to South Africa form a part, however, suggests that the specific kinds of racial privilege and sexual freedom available to someone in Renault's position in a culture of state racism, and the specific narrative voice—male, misogynist, and canonical—made available by her Greek novels, combined to create a crucial form of artistic freedom for this lesbian writer. This freedom, in turn, allowed Renault to produce novels that were among the most popular homosexual fictions of the century, that had enormous significance for gay and lesbian readers, and that achieved mainstream success for not one but a series of homosexual protagonists. The complicated braiding together of Renault's importance in gay and lesbian literary history (which we might be tempted to read as heroic), her resistance to identification with the homophile and liberation movements that lionized her (which we might find disappointing), and her reluctance to align herself with many of the antiapartheid movements championed by other South African writers (which we might regard as troubling) creates a salutary case history for queer studies.2\n\nRenault's first six novels, all set in contemporary England, constitute a period that is of interest because it provides the motives for the geographic and generic relocations I seek to explain and because these novels, most of them out of print, have been little read by biographers and critics. Their obscurity has less to do with their literary merits, I will argue, than with the discomfort they cause to those, including Renault herself, who wish to see the homosexual characters in her subsequent novels as evidence of her historical accuracy rather than her interest in homosexuality per se. I begin by describing the vexed position of Renault's fiction in the history of gay and lesbian literature, contrasting the enthusiasm of her gay and lesbian..."
