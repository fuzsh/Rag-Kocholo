        "text": "Mary Renault (born Sept. 4, 1905, London, Eng.—died Dec. 13, 1983, Cape Town, S.Af.) was a British-born South African novelist, best known for her scholarship and her skill in re-creating classical history and legend.\n\nRenault graduated from St. Hugh’s College and Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, completing her training as a nurse in 1937. She had begun to write novels but worked as a nurse during World War II. After the war she settled in South Africa.\n\nRenault’s best-known sequence of Greek historical novels soon appeared: The Last of the Wine (1956), The King Must Die (1958), and The Bull from the Sea (1962)—all praised for their attention to historical detail. The novels also caused some controversy because of their sympathetic handling of male homosexuality. In Fire from Heaven (1970), The Persian Boy (1972), and Funeral Games (1981), Renault retold the history and legend surrounding Alexander the Great; she also examined his psychological background in the biography The Nature of Alexander (1975)."
