        "text": "Mary Renault, whose books based on the history and legends of the Grecian age represented the highest aim of the historial novel - to give the reader a new insight into the past - died yesterday at the age of 78.\n\nMiss Renault, a onetime registered nurse whose many best-selling novels included ''The King Must Die,'' ''The Bull From the Sea,'' and ''The Last of the Wine,'' died in a hospital in Cape Town, where she had lived since World War II.\n\nThe writer's companion of the last 50 years, Julie Mullard, with whom Miss Renault went to Radcliffe Infirmary nursing school at Oxford, said in a telephone interview from Cape Town yesterday that death was attributed to bronchial pneumonia. A funeral service will be held tomorrow in St. George's Cathedral in Cape Town, and cremation will follow, Miss Mullard said.\n\nMiss Renault's most recent book was ''Funeral Games,'' published in the United States by Pantheon in 1981. The volume completed her trilogy on Alexander the Great, which began with ''Fire From Heaven'' in 1970 and went on to ''The Persian Boy'' in 1972. In ''Funeral Games,'' Alexander, the Macedonian who conquered Persia and northern India in the 4th century B.C., dies early on and the novel goes on to describe the breakup of his empire. Critic Finds 'Few Peers'\n\n''As a historical novelist writing about the ancient world, Mary Renault has few peers,'' the writer Gene Lyons said in The New York Times Book Review, in saluting her 1978 novel ''The Praise Singer.'' He compared her favorably to Robert Graves.\n\nOther critics noted Miss Renault's insistence on lending her works historical accuracy without burdening them with boring pedantry, and it was also remarked that while dealing realistically but unsensationally with the life and mores of the Hellenic world, Miss Renault calmly treated bisexual and homosexual love as well as heterosexual love as universals in her fiction.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
