        "text": "In 1905, Eileen Mary Challans was born in Essex, England. She would grow up to become Mary Renault, a renowned and respected historical fiction and nonfiction author. Although Renault dabbled in contemporary fiction during her lifetime, her novels and biography of Ancient Greece were her most popular and critically acclaimed. These books continue to capture the imagination of historical readers to this day, from her reimagination of Alexander the Great to the Peloponnesian War.\n\nBefore dipping her toes into historical waters, Renault trained as a nurse at Oxford, where she met Julie Mullard. Mullard, also working towards a career in nursing, became Renault’s lover. The two remained in a partnership for the rest of Renault’s life.\n\nUpon graduating from her nursing course, Renault worked as a nurse to support her writing career. From 1936 to 1945, Renault continued her dual career––even treating Dunkirk evacuees during World War II. By 1945, Renault had published three novels and was able to support herself without continuing her work in a brain surgery ward. But it was her fourth novel, Return to Night, that made Renault a household name and allowed her the freedom to move, with Mullard, to South Africa, where they found a more tolerant society––at least in terms of sexuality.\n\nIn South Africa, Renault began to focus on the writing that continues to define her career, over three decades past her death. After completing one final contemporary novel, The Charioteer, a WWII gay romance, she began work on her ancient Greek opuses. These novels would, unlike many other novels at the time, refuse to elide the homosocial and homosexual relationships of the Greek ancient world. This made Renault’s books popular both among the gay communities and historical fiction fans who found a new sense of reality and tension in her explorations of the ancient world. These, her most beloved works, are sure to be catnip to historical fiction lovers and ancient history aficionados."
