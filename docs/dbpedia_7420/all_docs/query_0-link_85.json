        "text": "As a teenager, on bone-chilling English beaches, I had a guilty pleasure. Wrapped in towels and sheltering behind wind-worn breakwaters, I smuggled on to the shingle something that would transport me elsewhere, where I would be warmed by a breeze, rushed upon by monsters and demons, protected by flawed boy-kings and kohl-eyed high priestesses.\n\nThe potent object was a book by one Eileen Mary Challans, nom de plume Mary Renault. I would wait anxiously for the next title – wrapped in opaque plastic by the careful hands of the Hythe librarian – to be returned by the phalanx of nut-brown, silver-haired Army widows who seemed to occupy this Kentish seaside town.\n\nWith the hubris of youth I thought all this hot joy was my own, unaware that, in fact, across the world, others were similarly enchanted. A global bestseller by 1970, with eight Greek-themed historical novels and six contemporary ones, Renault has been praised by Hilary Mantel as “a shining light”. Simon Russell Beale recalls being “bewitched” by his first Renault experience. Sarah Waters judges her 1972 novel The Persian Boy to be “one of the greatest historical novels ever written”.\n\n• The recently republished novel by Mary Renault, The Charioteer\n\nOn the face of it, though, things didn’t start off too well. Eileen Mary Challans was born in 1905, the first, big-boned child of unhappy parents in a privet-proud east London suburb. To escape the rows and slamming doors she hid in a loft above their garage and read cowboy fiction. Her (fairy) godmother Aunt Bertha saw she was bright and, despite parental resistance, supported Eileen through Clifton School for Girls and then on to St Hugh’s College, Oxford.\n\nAt last, at Oxford, Eileen could exhale. Gamely throwing herself into the theatre scene, on afternoons off she would visit the Ashmolean Museum and, in her second year, she serendipitously walked into the white-heat of archaeological discovery. At the palace of Knossos on Crete extraordinary Bronze Age discoveries were being made. They were presented to the British School at Athens in 1926, and the archaeologist-adventurer Sir Arthur Evans then shipped to Oxford crates of delight, 3,500-year-old fragments: a gracefully androgynous bull-leaper; bare-breasted, snake-grappling women; fat, golden, sacred babies. Suddenly ancient myths – the touchstone parables of Renault’s Edwardian childhood – were, thrillingly, made flesh.\n\nAlexander the Great (PHOTO: Lanmas / Alamy)\n\nTaught by J R R Tolkien, Renault could have gone in a different direction: an early novel about medieval fantasy was later destroyed – no Game of Thrones prequel here. She castigated herself for writing of “knights bashing about in some never-never land”. Instead Renault trained as a nurse, and treated casualties of the Second World War, including those fresh from Dunkirk. Her work on the ward would give her words on the page a direct and intimate viscerality. Passages describing war wounds and the male body, both before and after trauma, have a sharp, steely truth to them. The sheltered graduate quickly learnt of man’s capacity for rapacious inhumanity. But her nursing profession also offered Renault a lifelong love: Julie Mullard, the woman with whom she would move to South Africa in 1949 and live in a “partyish” beach house called Delos until she died.\n\nThat love – or rather, the possibility of homo-eroticism and of simply being different – is a pulsing bass note for Renault’s novels. It’s arguably best expressed in the historical series: two Theseus novels, four inspired by Alexander the Great, two based in fifth-century Greece and one in the fourth, which she started to write when just shy of 50. Her quiet bravery in making same-sex love a charismatic theme is bold and dignified. For millions, including my juvenile self, Renault enlivened other ways of being. Interviewed in 1982, a year before she died, she crisply suggested, with a secure little smile: “I think a lot of people are intermediately sexed.” It’s an observation about the present that winkles out a truth I also see in the past, lying between the lines of conventional historical antiquity.\n\n• The lost novels to be rediscovered, from Stoner to Mary Renault\n\nAs a historian I have huge admiration for both Renault’s empathy and her perspicacity. Hers are not fact-bound chronicles; she gets some things wrong. Instead her work is a kind of dance with antiquity, a broad-backed renaissance from which ancient authors such as Euripides, Aristotle, Aeschylus and Plato, all frequently quoted, can speak to us. What she gets right is the sheer peacock-gaudy, drug-saturated, hardcore sensuality of this time and place. Cutting-edge science now tells us ancient warriors would indeed consume vast vats of liquid opiates and a ferocious honey-mead, retsina and wine cocktail. There was cannibalism. Girls and boys did oil one another with rose and saffron-scented olive oil. Renault heard and smelt the ancient world many millennia after it had died and decades before it was resurrected by contemporary technology.\n\nThere is no doubt that, in geo‑historical terms, she set my own compass south. As I write, I realise my study is a shrine to those images Renault helped me to imagine before I could meet them face to face: Greek pots, high-bosomed prehistoric female figurines, Spartan dancing-girls. She did as the ancient Greeks did, prodding away at epic stories, artefacts and memories to understand better how to live a life. Decades before all this would be neurologically proved, Mary Renault recognised that we are, physiologically, creatures of memory. That the past matters, and that we best understand our place in the world by telling robust, vivid stories about it and ourselves.\n\nThere’s something else. I think her greatest gift is in many ways very Greek. There is an almost untranslatable ancient Greek word: xenia. Often described as “guest-host friendship”, xenia was both an unwritten code of international conduct, in operation since about 6000BC, and an idea – that as a species we thrive when we welcome the unexpected across our threshold. In The Bull from the Sea the author opines: “It is the mark of little men to like only what they know; one step beyond and they feel the black cold of chaos.”\n\nWell, Renault was no little man. She encourages us all to walk through history, through literature and through our own lives with open eyes and an open mind. To recognise that although humanity has many faces, across time and space, we all of us share one human heart."
