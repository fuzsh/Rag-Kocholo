        "text": "LGBT People Socializing and Learning Together\n\nThe Mary Renault Society was organized in Chapel Hill in the early 1980’s as a book club, largely to provide a way gay men could meet and socialize without resorting to bars.\n\nOriginally devoted to reading and discussion, MRS has evolved over time into a monthly forum for presentations. Topics have been artistic, legal, religious, poetic, literary, medical, political … whatever relates to the queer experience. Presenters have included authors, attorneys, physicians, ministers, educators, artists, legislators, preservationists, and travelers, each of whom brings a perspective meaningful to our life experiences.\n\nIn this setting, MRS provides a welcoming and relaxed environment in which to meet people of like mind without having to hide a person's true nature and feelings. It also offers newcomers examples of successful, intelligent people whose interests in life extend beyond sexuality.\n\nMRS meetings center on potluck dinners at members’ homes, usually on the fourth Sunday evening of every month. The gatherings generally begin at 7:00, with dinner beginning at 7:30 and a presentation following the meal. You’ll be welcome; count on it."
