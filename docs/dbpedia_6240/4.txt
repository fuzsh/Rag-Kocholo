Bluelight Communications will launch Urban “105.5 The Beat” W288CS Rochester NY/102.7 WLGZ-HD2 Webster at 6pm today.

Helmed by veteran programmer Mickey Johnson, the new new station will feature the syndicated Breakfast Club in mornings.

Johnson joins Bluelight from Townsquare Media’s 92.9 WTUG Tuscaloosa AL where he served as Brand Manager. He has also programmed Urban stations in Jacksonville, Birmingham, and St. Louis including launching “95.7 Jamz” WBHJ and serving as OM for Radio-One’s “Hot 104.1” WHHL St. Louis.
