Located at the intersection of NYS Route 104 and Holt Road, virtually every car traveling between Rochester and its eastern suburbs must pass this key location and its 5,800 feet of combined road frontage.\n\nWebster is a community on the rise – named by Sports Illustrated as the “Number 1 Sportstown” in New York State. Commercially zoned with availabilities for Land Lease and Build to Suit."
