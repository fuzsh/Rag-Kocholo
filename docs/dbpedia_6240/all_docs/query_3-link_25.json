        "text": "The 84-acre preserve was created in 2019 and consists of second growth forest, wetlands and ponds. It is bisected from the SW to the NE by Four Mile Creek, and consists of two parts.\n\nOn the west side of Four Mile Creek, the trails connect the Arbor Creek Community Center with the neighborhood. This system is maintained by the homeowners association.\n\nOn the east side of the creek, the short Broken Willow trail leads from the trailhead on State Road to the pond in the woods. There it connects to a one mile loop which takes you through woods and grasslands and along Four Mile Creek. The east trails are maintained by Friends of Webster Trails.\n\nFuture plans for this unique property include a bridge to connect the two trail systems, additional east-side trails, and a picnic area overlooking the pond.\n\nTrail Conditions\n\nThe trails can be very wet and muddy, and poison ivy is prevalent.\n\nHistory\n\nNinety years ago the property was farmed fields with apple orchards in the southern area. In the 1950s a farm pond was built in that area. Shortly thereafter, farming ceased and the dryer ground reverted to woodland, the wetter floodplain to grass and cattail. The development of the subdivision included the creation of several large retention ponds west of the creek."
