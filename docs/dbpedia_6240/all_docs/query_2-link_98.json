        "text": "By Briana Perez\n\nPhoto Credit: Roger Ho\n\nOn June 7-9, Governors Ball 2024 lit up Flushing Meadows – Corona Park in New York City. A diverse collection of artists filled the weekend, who took New York City storm with performances of global hits. This year’s Governors Ball, which hosted artists from around the world, had music for everyone!\n\nAs soon as doors opened on June 7, Governors Ball had everyone on their feet. The festival hit it off with performances by Ryan Beatty and many more artists, such as Mimi Webb, Arcy Drive and Yung Gravy, who absolutely rocked their sets! I added a couple of their songs to my playlist! Dominic Fike, another highly anticipated artist and one to keep your eye on, performed some of my personal favorites — as well as songs from his recent EP “14 minutes.”\n\nPhoto Credit: N. Bradley\n\nOne of the artists I anticipated the most was Rauw Alejandro, a Puerto Rican artist whose recent releases I’ve been a huge fan of. Alejandro performed hits, such as “Espectacular,” “AL CALLAO’,” and my personal favorite “2/Catorce.” Alongside newer releases like “Touching The Sky,” Alejandro performed older hits like “Hey Lil Mama” and “Reloj.” Alejandro and his incredible backup dancers had the crowd going wild!\n\nPhoto Credit: Charles Reagan\n\nPost Malone closed the first night of the festival with an exhilarating performance. Opening up his set with a live band and a string quartet for “Better Now,” the crowd was all riled up! I always love hearing live bands, and Post did an amazing job delivering Rock versions of his greatest hits like “rockstar (feat. 21 Savage),” and “White Iverson.”\n\nPhoto Credit: N. Bradley\n\nOne song I quickly added to my playlist was “Take What You Want (feat. Ozzy Osburn)!” Post also brought out fans to sing and play guitar for “Stay.” He closed his set with the song “Chemical,” making night one a night to remember!\n\nPhoto Credit: N. Bradley\n\nSaturday, June 8 was packed with even more amazing performances by artists like Riovaz, Quarters of Change, and Claire Rosinkranz! After last year’s success, Governors Ball brought out another K-Pop group to the stage, P1Harmony. The boys killed it and the fans were eating it all up! As a K-pop enjoyer, I was excited to see what they would bring to the stage. The boys certainly did not fail to impress! They sang hits like “Killin’ It,” “Back Down,” “Doom Du Doom,” and “JUMP”!\n\nPhoto Credit: N. Bradley (top) & Mickey Pierre Louis (bottom)\n\nI was lucky enough to catch Sabrina Carpenter’s stage on Saturday! Opening with “Read your Mind,” Carpenter and her stage presence had the crowd in a trance. Carpenter’s set was filled with hits, like “Feather,” “Espresso,” and “because i liked a boy.” Earlier in the week, Carpenter released a new single, “Please Please Please,” off of her upcoming album Short n’ Sweet (Be sure to check it out when it comes out!), and Governors Ball had the privilege of hearing the live debut! Closing out with an iconic outro for “Nonsense,’ Carpenter left me (and probably the rest of the crowd) in awe.\n\nPhoto Credit: Paigge Warton\n\nThe rest of the afternoon consisted of performances by d4vd, Sexyy Red, Carly Rae Jepsen, Hippo Campus, 21 Savage and TV Girl! Closing up the second night, The Killers celebrated 20 years of their debut studio album, Hot Fuss! They opened their set with ‘Somebody Told Me’ and played hits like “Jenny Was a Friend of Mine” and “Smile Like You Mean It.” The Killers even brought up a fan to play the drums for “For Reasons Unknown”! I watched their set from the back of GA with my friends and it was such an incredible experience. Growing up listening to The Killers, this was a moment I will never forget!\n\nPhoto Credit: Chris Phelps\n\nThe last day of Governors Ball was by far one of my favorites! From Palestinian artists Elyanna and Saint Levant, to Malcolm Todd and Kevin Abstract, Sunday was filled with artists who absolutely rocked the stage. Many bands, such as Geese and Beach Fossils, also put on an incredible performacne!\n\nPhoto Credit: Deanie Chen (top) & N. Bradley (bottom)\n\nBreakout artist Chappell Roan was a set you did not want to miss. Chappell came to the stage in an apple, dressed up in drag inspired by Lady Liberty. Opening up her set with “Femininomenon,” the crowd went wild. She performed lots of hits from “HOT TO GO!” to “Good Luck, Babe!” and even performed an unreleased song, “The Subway”! After watching her incredible vocals and performance, I added several of her songs to my playlist!\n\nPhotos by: N. Bradley (top) & Anna Downs (bottom)\n\nReneé Rapp, Stephen Sanchez, Faye Webster, and Peso Pluma hit the stage shortly after Chappell Roan’s breathtaking performance. Finally, SZA closed out the festival. I was so excited to watch her perform, especially after not being able to make it to her previous tour.\n\nSZA celebrated 5 years of her debut studio album Ctrl! She opened her set with “Seek & Destroy” and sang many songs off of her first album, such as “Love Galore” and “Broken Clocks.” I was left in shock the second I heard the intro to “Ghost in the Machine!” I could not believe I was witnessing one of my favorite songs live! Like the day before, I watched SZA’s set from the back of GA, where I had a full view of her set and could dance the night away. SZA went on to perform many more hits, such as “All the Stars,” “Kiss Me More,” and “Rich Baby Daddy.” SZA wrapped up her set, and the festival, with “Good Days” and “20 Something.”\n\nWhat an incredible way to finish up 3 exhilarating days. This was the first festival I had ever been to, and it certainly will not be my last! I loved discovering new artists, and being able to witness some of my favorite songs live was an experience that I cannot forget. I’m super excited to see what next year’s Governors Ball will have in store for fans!\n\nBy Evan Leong\n\nPhoto Credit: Evan Leong\n\nOn April 25th, 105.5 WDHA held its third annual Rock the Rock Fest at the iconic Prudential Center in Newark. A festival for rock lovers across the state, iconic bands Staind and Seether prepared to deliver historic performances. Meanwhile, fans like me felt nothing but excitement for a long night of rock music. I’m happy to report that I left the show thrilled after discovering new artists and witnessing great performances from others I was more familiar with.\n\nPhoto Credit: Evan Leong\n\nWDHA’s Program Director Terrie Carr introduced songwriter and guitarist Ayron Jones and his band to kick off a long, energetic night. They were the only artist I was completely unfamiliar with entering the show, but I truly enjoyed their performance. In particular, I enjoyed Jones’ gritty vocal delivery. Their songs also featured diverse guitar lines with twangy, shimmering cleans and upbeat, overdriven leads. Jones’ band members guitar and bass players were animated and full of smiles. I thoroughly enjoyed their set, and I’m excited to check out more of their material. They set the stage well for the next band on the bill.\n\nPhoto Credit: Evan Leong\n\nThat band was Dayseeker, one of my favorite artists – and a band I was so excited to see perform again. Known for their sad, synth-laden alternative metal, they were a great change of pace from Jones’ upbeat rhythms. I last saw Dayseeker in New York City with metalcore band Bad Omens, where they put on one of the most emotional sets I’ve ever experienced. This performance was no different. Vocalist Rory Rodriguez put on a standout performance, as I’ve come to expect. His powerful belted vocals in songs like “Burial Plot” and “Neon Grave” conveyed so much pain and emotion. If there’s ever a band that can get you through a tough time, it’s Dayseeker. And I’m thankful I had another opportunity to experience them live.\n\nPhoto Credit: Evan Leong\n\nThe next band absolutely blew me away, British rock quartet The Struts. They put on one of the bounciest, danciest rock-and-roll sets I’ve had the pleasure of witnessing. Prior to the show, I had heard a couple of songs by the band, but I wasn’t familiar with their music. However, their live set was an otherworldly experience (and now as I write this review, I’m voraciously digging into their discography). While every act was great, The Struts may have orchestrated my favorite performance of the night. Their playful vocal lines and upbeat rhythms were accompanied by a charismatic performance full of dancing and smiling. It was such a joy to watch, and their performances of “Kiss This” and “Primadonna Like Me” were energetic and unforgettable.\n\nPhoto Credit: Evan Leong\n\nHailing from South Africa, Seether has been an icon of the hard rock/alternative metal scene for over two decades. Their experience is evident on stage; their performances sounded nearly identical to the studio versions of the songs. I was surprised when the band pulled out their hit song “Broken” early in the set. While photographing the band, I heard a united choir of voices behind me as fans sang the words. Toward the end of the set, “Fake It” elicited cheers from the crowd, and I saw plenty of fans bouncing up and down in the crowd. Their set was fun, and I enjoyed my first time seeing the iconic band perform.\n\nPhoto Credit: Evan Leong\n\nAfter a long wait and budding anticipation, the curtain dropped for esteemed rock band Staind as they launched into “Lowest in Me,” which at the time of its release was the band’s first single following a 12-year hiatus. What impressed me the most was the cohesion in their performance. Vocalist and rhythm guitarist Aaron Lewis displayed a cool, collected rockstar swagger; he casually smoked a cigarette while alternating between deep, raspy cleans and distorted screams. Lead guitarist Mike Mushok also stood out to me, bouncing around on stage with boundless energy. Fans jumped around for the entirety of Staind’s performance, and the band closed with “It’s Been Awhile” and “Mudshovel,” two defining songs in the post-grunge genre.\n\nRock the Rock Fest may have been a long night, but its relentless energy kept me excited throughout. The diversity between the bands kept me on my toes, and I felt privileged to be able to cover a show at an arena as iconic as Prudential Center. I’d also like to thank WDHA for their generosity in allowing me to organize a ticket giveaway for the show. I had an excellent experience, and I’m excited to see what next year’s Rock the Rock Fest has in store."
