        "text": "With the return of the Webster Fireman’s Carnival this week, it seems an appropriate time to take a look back at the history of this very popular and long-running summer event.\n\nAccording to the Webster Volunteer Fire Department’s 100th anniversary history book, the Fireman’s Carnival turns 87 years old this year. The first carnival was held July 23 and 24, 1937 on Ridge Rd. just west of Corning Park, where Pierce St. is now. The first chairman, Russell B. Mason, reported a net profit of $514.63.\n\nNot much is known about that first year, but we do know that the carnival was held at the same location the following year. The July 15, 1938 edition of the Webster Herald reported that carnival-goers would enjoy four thrilling rides, plus free dancing and entertainment. They could also enter to win cash door prizes, a radio from Hawley’s Hardware and a refrigerator from Netzman’s Appliances.\n\nThe 1938 carnival was even more successful than the first, netting about $1100, despite some challenges. It rained buckets Friday night, and on Saturday the Ferris wheel broke down. Fortunately, though, carnival-goers had other entertainment options, including a hoop-rolling contest and a “Dutch bowlers” (cricket) demonstration game, which attracted an audience of 700.\n\nEven before the 1938 carnival, the Webster Fire Department was well into the planning stages of purchasing its own property for use as carnival grounds. That September, they finalized the sale of a 24-acre tract of land owned by William Partridge near their current festival site west of Corning Park, purchased for $2500. The firemen have held their carnival on that property, now known as Fireman’s Field, every year since.\n\nMissy Rosenberry\n\nWebster Community Blogger\n\nSee my blog at: websterontheweb.com.\n\nCheck out my Facebook page and follow me on Instagram.\n\nAs spring slowly creeps back into town, and the flowers and trees start to bloom, it’s the perfect time to get out and take a hike on one (or several) of our outstanding Webster trails. Some of the most beautiful of those trails, and most interesting from a historical perspective, are the ones that wind through the Four Mile Creek Preserve at the corner of Lake and Phillips roads.\n\nScattered along the Four Mile Creek trails are seven rusted-out old cars, including a 1949 Nash Ambassador Custom Airflyte, a 1950 Chevrolet Deluxe Bel Air, a 1956 Nash Rambler and others. They tell of a day when the parkland was just farmers’ fields and kids would use the area for joyrides.\n\nAccording to Dennis Kuhn, the Friends of Webster Trails’ resident Cars along the Creek expert,\n\nThe cars were driven onto the property from Lake Road across a bridge that accessed farmland where the cars were last driven. It seems that some local youths decided to create a racetrack somewhat off the beaten path to have some fun cavorting around the open fields that were available at the time. If you traverse the land as it is now, you’ll have to use your imagination to see a relatively treeless landscape that existed sometime in the nineteen fifties or early sixties.\n\nNevertheless, the youths of the day had a ton of fun going around in circles until they ran out of gas or had a flat tire or wrecked the transmission.\n\nSo take a hike one of these spring days along the trails at Four Mile Creek Preserve, and enjoy a fascinating walk back through Webster history. You can read more about these and all of Webster’s trails at the Friends of Webster Trails website, webstertrails.org.\n\nDiscover more fascinating bits of local history at the Webster Museum, 18 Lapham Park in the Village of Webster.

Stretching almost a half mile long, the bridge was christened on a snowy day in 1970, which was reportedly so cold that the celebratory wine froze in the glasses before it could be raised.\n\nSeven months later, on a much sunnier and warmer late August day, the bridge was officially dedicated with not one, but three ribbon cutting ceremonies; one held at the Irondequoit end, a second in the middle and a third at the Webster end.\n\nThe project took about two years to build, and apparently much of the discussion during the process centered around what to name the new span. Many ideas were suggested, including naming it after Donald Holleder or even calling it the Hiawatha Bridge. But state regulations didn’t allow any project using state money to be named after a person, so ultimately it became known only as the Irondequoit Bay Bridge.\n\nInterestingly, the plows waiting on that icy February morning to spread some salt across the newly opened bridge were not the first vehicles to cross.\n\nAs reported Sept. 9, 1970 in the Webster Herald,\n\nThe first “man” across the bridge made it on Feb. 3 at 4:28 a.m. via Union Hill Ambulance. He was then one-year old Kevin Lohse of Greensboro Drive who had stopped breathing. The ambulance was conducted by a police car driven by Sgt. Gil Kunzer whose idea it was to remove the bridge barriers, thus saving needed time and perhaps the youngster’s life.\n\nYoung Kevin, healthy and happy, attended the ribbon cutting ceremonies in August.

It’s a carriage block, and it sits in front of the home at 34 Corning Park.\n\nIn the time when horses and buggies were the main forms of transportation, anyone other than very athletic riders and passengers faced some difficulty dismounting horses, stagecoaches or buggies, which rode several feet off the ground. The solution: a carriage block, also known as a horse block. Basically, they were step stools, bridging the large gap between ground and vehicles, making mounting and dismounting much easier.\n\nThese helpful steps were commonly found in front of homes, churches, train depots and businesses. They were made from a variety of materials, including cast iron, wood, even marble. Many, however, like the one on Corning Park, were fashioned from simple cement.\n\nYou won’t see many of these around town – in fact, there are only three that we know of – because once they became obsolete, most of these vestiges of 19th century history were removed. The two others that have survived the passage of time are in front of 394 Phillips Rd. and the Holt Homestead at 757 Holt Rd.\n\nDiscover more fascinating bits of local history at the Webster Museum, 18 Lapham Park in the Village of Webster.

What Hollingshead didn’t calculate was the cost of the films he hoped to play at his theater and the willingness of others to pay him royalties for use of his concept. His patent was granted in 1933, but despite good crowds, he closed the business 14 months later because he wasn’t making any money.\n\nVery few drive-in theaters were built until 1949 when Hollingshead’s patent was voided by the courts. Between 1948 and 1958 over 4,000 drive-in theaters opened in the United States, The Empire Drive-In being one of them.\n\nThe theaters became popular, inexpensive entertainment for families and teens, offering movies, food, playgrounds, in some cases miniature golf and other outdoor games.\n\nIn the evening hours driving along Empire Blvd., it was difficult not to crane your head and see what was showing on the big screen.\n\nBy the 1970s things began to change. Indoor theaters could show movies all day long and weren’t hampered by the weather. Like most drive-in theaters in the north, the Empire Drive-In Theatre was closed throughout the winter. Movie studios began sending their best films to the indoor theaters and second run and lower quality movies to the drive-ins.\n\nIn the Empire Drive-In’s last year they showed Animal House (R), Raging Bull (PG), and The Sword and the Sorcerer (R), but they also showed Demonoids (R), Funeral Home (R), X-Rated movies, and finished with Hog Wild (PG).\n\nBy 1981, 25% of US homes subscribed to cable television which added financial pressures to the entire theater industry. Believe it or not, HBO began its broadcasts in 1972, Showtime in 1976, and ESPN joined the cable line-up in 1979.\n\nIn October of 1982, Loews Theaters (now AMC Theaters) announced plans to buy the Empire Drive-In and replace it with eight indoor theaters (an 8-plex). A short time later, the Empire Drive-In was demolished and construction began on the new theater complex. On December 9th of 1983, The Lowes Webster Theater opened to the public. Scarface, Sudden Impact, Terms of Endearment, and The Right Stuff were all part of the opening night’s fare.\n\nDrive-In Theaters of Western NY\n\nAccording to the United Drive-In Theatre Owners Association (UDITOA), as of November of 2022, there were only 302 Drive-In Theatre locations remaining in the United States. We are fortunate to have 7 of those drive-ins here in western, NY.\n\nElmira Drive-In\n\n2431 State Route 352\n\nElmira, NY 14903\n\nFinger Lakes Drive-In\n\n1064 Clark Street Road\n\nAurelius, NY 13021\n\nMidway Drive-In Theatre\n\n2475 NYS Rt. 48\n\nFulton NY 13069\n\nSilver Lake Twin Drive-In\n\n7037 Chapman Ave.\n\nPerry, NY 14530\n\nSunset Drive-In\n\n9950 Telegraph Road\n\nMiddleport, NY 14105\n\nTransit Drive-In Theatre\n\n6655 S.

If you’re up for a 14-mile ride along some of Webster’s most beautiful roadways, you might want to explore the James W. Carnevale Bike Route.\n\nThe route was named in honor of James Carnevale, who lived on Old Farm Circle. He served in Korea as an Army Intelligence Officer, and was awarded a bronze star for photography. He served as Webster’s Recreation Commissioner for many years, and was an active member of the town’s Democratic Party. He passed away suddenly in 1977 at age 47 and is buried at Webster Union Cemetery.\n\nThe bike route which was named after him was originally established in 1968. The 14.5-mile route took riders (in general) west from Holt Rd. to Klem, then along Bay, Volk and Dewitt roads, ending at Inspiration Point. There, the riders would turn around and wind their way back.\n\nIn 1986, the route was officially renamed the “James W. Carnevale Bike Route” in honor of his service as Recreation Commissioner. At a ceremony held in November, the Town of Webster presented Carnevale’s widow with one of the signs.\n\nMost of the original signs seem to be gone, but apparently there’s still one standing at the corner of Drumm and Herman roads, and there might be one at Klem and Five Mile Line. The one pictured in the photo with Nancy Carnevale is still hanging just inside the Webster Museum entrance, next to the antique bicycle.\n\nDiscover more interesting bits of local history at the Webster Museum, 18 Lapham Park in the Village of Webster.

According to the Webster Arboretum website, that designation can be traced back to Elizabeth Sykes, a member of the Webster Country Gardeners Garden Club. Back around 1970, she urged the Town to adopt the tree as the Town Tree. (No one seems to know why she chose the crabapple).\n\nSykes then asked Jean Thompson and Carole Huther to approach the Town about establishing a crabapple arboretum. The perfect location seemed to be a parcel of land the Town had purchased several years earlier, two family farms on Schlegel Rd. owned by Herman Rieflin and Walter Wright. On June 21, 1971 the Town accepted the proposal and set aside 20 of the 80 acres for the arboretum.\n\nOf course the first plantings were crabapple trees.\n\nIn the years since it was established, the Webster Arboretum, now about 40 acres, has seen many improvements and expansions, especially in anticipation of the Town’s sesquicentennial celebration in 1990. The beautiful results of those efforts and continuing support from the Town of Webster, Webster community members and a dedicated team of volunteers can be seen today in its bountiful gardens and along its peaceful, flower-filled paths.\n\nThe Webster Arboretum is located at 1700 Schlegel Rd.

It hung in what was most recently the Music Store on West Main St. in the village, when the old post office was located there. A second one was installed in the railroad station on North Ave.\n\nThe two instruments were connected by two wires strung across poles and roofs of houses along North Ave. They operated in much the same way as the old tin-can telephones we used to use when we were kids. Remember them? Stretch a string between two tin cans and you could talk back and forth just by keeping the string taut.\n\nWhen the postmaster wanted to know when to expect the mail trains, he would knock vigorously on the center of the disc. This would cause the wires to vibrate and ring the bell on the telephone at the other end. To communicate, you would talk and listen through the center of the disc.\n\nThis particular telephone has been in the Webster Museum’s collection since the museum opened in 1976. It was donated by Peter and Jay Smith, whose father was the postmaster (although the bell is not original).\n\nLearn more about this and other interesting bits of local history at the Webster Museum, 18 Lapham Park in the Village of Webster.

But the smallest of our town’s cemeteries is often forgotten, even though many of us pass by it almost every day.\n\nRobb Cemetery is an 8700-square foot parcel of land on East Main Street in the village of Webster, just west of Phillips Road. It is a true pioneer burial ground, with at least eight known burial sites dating back to 1823.\n\nThe land was originally set aside from the farm of Andrew Rodd as a family burial ground – the only one in Webster – but other friends and relatives were also buried there.\n\nFor many years there was no indication the land held a cemetery – no signage, not even any gravestones. In 2013, the Village of Webster officially took possession of the property, cleaned it up, and erected a handsome sign naming all of the pioneers known to have been buried there.\n\nA fascinating little piece of that cemetery’s history now resides at the Webster Museum. It’s the headstone for Nelly Wood, who died in 1838 at age 84. It was found many years ago in the basement of the house just west of the cemetery. No one really knows how long it was there, or Nelly’s connection with the Robb Family. But it is a nice reminder of the significance of Webster’s very own pioneer cemetery.\n\nStop by the museum to see it for yourself any Tuesday, Thursday or Saturday from 2 to 4:30 p.m. The Webster Museum is located at 18 Lapham Park in the Village of Webster.\n\nMissy Rosenberry\n\nWebster Community Blogger\n\nSee my blog at: websterontheweb.com.\n\nCheck out my Facebook page and follow me on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nLast month’s Bit of Webster History feature really struck a chord with many current and former Webster residents. Titled “What’s in a Name?”, it told the history behind several well-known Webster street names: Salt Rd., Basket Rd., Five Mile Line Rd., Shoecraft Rd. and Whiting Rd.\n\nDozens of readers reached out, many wondering about other well-known road names. So here, drawing liberally once again from Webster History Through the Years, are answers for some of those wonders.\n\nKlem Rd., now known in part for its spacious shoulders, was only 49 feet wide when it was surveyed in 1816. Several families of Klems lived on or near the road, so it was named for them. It was originally built with logs because the bed was low and swampy.\n\nWoodhull Rd. was surveyed in 1816 across the original Robert Woodhull Farm and was named after him.\n\nIt’s commonly believed that Vosburg Rd. was named after the forebears of George Vosburgh, who lived many years in the old brick house near the corner of Lake Rd. It was actually named after Freeman Vosburgh, a German blacksmith, who built that house.\n\nDrumm Rd. was named after a colorful character called “Captain Drumms.” He was reputed to be a former canal boat captain who bought land on the west side of the road.\n\nHerman Rd. was named after Gustav Herman, who owned a farm on the south side of the road opposite Pellett Rd. The road had apparently been nameless for several years.\n\nMore information about these roads and many others can be found in Webster Through the Years, by Esther Dunn, published in 1971. You can check out a copy at the Webster Public Library, or page through one at the Webster Museum, 18 Lapham Park in the Village of Webster. The museum is open every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday from 2 to 4:30 p.m.\n\nMissy Rosenberry\n\nWebster Community Blogger\n\nSee my blog at: websterontheweb.com.\n\nCheck out my Facebook page and follow me on Twitter and Instagram."
