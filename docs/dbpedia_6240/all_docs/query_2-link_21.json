        "text": "Here’s a short, bonus blog today that will interest anyone who’s into ham radio operation.\n\nAbout a week ago I posted a blog about the XRX Radio Club and how they’re participating in the annual ARRL Field Day competition, broadcasting from Kent Park. But I recently learned about another group which will also be participating, setting up in Webster Park.\n\nThe Rochester DX Association (RXDA) will be setting up in the Boy Scout commissary area near the Webster Park campground.\n\nAs described on the ARRL website, Field Day, held the fourth weekend in June, is the most popular on-the-air event held annually in the US and Canada. More than 40,000 radio amateurs gather with their clubs, groups or friends across North America to operate from remote locations.\n\nIt’s kind of like ham radio’s open house. Community members are encouraged to stop by to learn more about the hobby. It combines science, public service, emergency preparedness, community outreach and technical skills, and all are on display at Field Day.\n\nThe 24-hour exercise begins at 2 p.m. Saturday and runs through 2 p.m. Sunday. Visitors are more than welcome.\n\n* * *\n\nemail me at missyblog@gmail.com. “Like” this blog on Facebook and follow me on Instagram and Threads (@missyblog)\n\nYou can also get email notifications every time I post a new blog by using the “Subscribe” link on the right side of this page (or all the way at the bottom of the page if you’re on your phone).\n\n(posted 6/21/2024)"
