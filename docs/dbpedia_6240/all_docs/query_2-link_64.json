Kauffman\n\nHow come we can no longer stream 102.7 Legends Group on Alexa ?\n\nYou've been gone 3 days.\n\nWe miss you.\n\nMaryEllen Englert\n\nLove your selection of music and I have missed listening for 2.5 months. We were in Florida for the winter. I listen everyday with delight!\n\nMark epley\n\nYou have a great station there. I used to listen to WMGK in Philadelphia. I live in Lansdowne, PA. I just came across your station about two weeks ago and I dumped WMGK. Listen to your station, squirrelly. Great.\n\nLansdowne, PA is just right outside of Philadelphia."
