        "text": "Maine cannot get enough of native son and master of macabre, Stephen King. I know all about his books, movies, mayhem, and dark characters. I love diving into a Stephen King book and getting scared out of my wits, loving and hating every minute of it. I swear the scariest movie I've ever seen is The Shining.\n\nThere is one thing I didn't know about the author, and I happened to stumble upon it on Reddit of all places.\n\nUber-rich and famous Stephen King owns a group of radio stations in Bangor, Maine. King is a rock 'n roll fan, so of course he owns a rock station, WKIT-FM 100.3, \"Stephen King's Rock Station\". He also owns WZLO, 98.3/103.1 Maine's Adult Alternative , and WZON AM 620.\n\nThe Reddit post was very cool, too. It showed a photo of the big framed artwork in the lobby, which includes 12 of King's most famous books encased in glass. That's what first caught my attention.\n\nI work at a radio station owned by Stephen King in Bangor, Maine (AKA Derry) This is a cool poster we have framed and hanging in our lobby.\n\nby u/thatpaulallen in stephenking\n\nThe coolest part was the mascot of WKIT. Of course, it's a creepy Doug E. Graves monster reminiscent of Frankenstein, but way hipper.\n\nStephen King is also a rocker with his band \"Rock Bottom Remainders\", playing for various events and having a good time in a creative way.\n\nLet's just say music is in Stephen King's blood as much as ghastly story writing is."
