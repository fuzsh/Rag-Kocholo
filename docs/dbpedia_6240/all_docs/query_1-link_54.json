        "text": "I’ve been listening to a lot of Radio X from the UK recently - reminds me a lot of the Triple J of old and a bit like Virgin Radio / Absolute Radio.\n\nHousemate made a comment the other day that they play a lot of ‘bangers’ - it’s got a longer run on TuneIn here now\n\nIt’s an interesting subject.\n\nOn the www.radiodiscussions.com website in the US they were having a chat about Lite FM 106.7 in New York and somehow they got around to CHR stations - and this comment stuck out at me:\n\n\"Obviously compared to the mess that all these chr’s in this country sound like outside of a few who do their thing correctly like kiis in la, Z100 rules.\n\nTake a listen to the Australian chrs fox out of Melbourne, kiis and Nova in Sydney, nothing in this country comes close.\"\n\nI do listen to a LOT of US stations and their hit music stations are nowhere near as polished as ours… so sometimes it seems we don’t have to look far to find quality, it’s under our noses and we just don’t realise it.\n\nAfter it was announced that KIIS (as a brand) was coming to Australia, I listened to KIIS LA - it was good but I wouldnt say it was great (I think some of our stations are better)\n\nThere are quite a number of good UK Stations - it probably helps that there is some strong competition in Radio 1\n\nLA has some great stations like KOST, KTWV, KRTH and KISS. WCBS and Fresh in New York are well produced and programmed as well. I like the positioning and imaging of these stations. There are some great oldies stations around the US as well like KABQ, WLGZ (legends), KGOR (Superhits) and KOSF (Big). As far as the variety stations go, I like the Jack FM format the best but there’s always Bob FM or Random Radio Steve FM\n\nOne of my favourite stations, WODC 93.3 Columbus Ohio, has just rebranded overnight to variety hits 93.3 The Bus. They’ve basically dropped most 70s and are now running as a predominantly 80s-based station, taking on Rewind 103.5/104.3.\n\nI have friends in Columbus, both inside and outside of radio there, and it’s taken them all by surprise. My friends work for Saga Radio, which is Sunny 94.7 (Sunny 95), Rewind 103.5/104.3 and Mix 107.9) and they didn’t see it coming.\n\nI’m a really big fan on KBIG/MYFM Los Angeles - I think it’s one of the best stations going around. KIIS and KROQ are both decent as well, depending on what you’re into.\n\nI used to listen to a lot of Radio1 when Chris Moyles was on, now a bit of Radio X.\n\nThat all being said, My FM has a pretty good, polished sound, as does KIIS, but the rest aren’t anywhere near as polished as something like a Nova.\n\nI have to say I don’t mind the European stations like NRJ and Radio 538 they have a certain production quality that I quite enjoy. But I would have to say my most listened to overseas radio stations are BBC Radio 1 (An example of how awesome our own Triple J could be) and Puls Radio in France (One of the first online only radio stations I ever listened to).\n\nI’m a big fan of Absolute Radio in the UK. I was recently in the LA and was really impressed by KOST (until they started the Christmas music!) - for me they were the perfect Soft AC station that’s still “up-tempo”. Some of the older stuff they played mixed in with the new softer hits was great. Lot’s of Michael Jackson (the good stuff), early Madonna and Whitney to name but a few. Also really impressed with The Sound (Classic Rock), K-Earth (Greatest Hits - but with a rock edge) and Jack FM. All good - and ALL of the stations listed played Journey which is a big winner for me Overall I thought the quality of LA radio was much better than here in my opinion.\n\nUnfortunately I seem to have missed that one - which is a shame because I like that playlist a lot. Smooth RnB is something I haven’t heard before but judging by that list I’d like The Wave too. LA has so many good stations it’s not fair\n\nPS. That Midnight Train To Georgia song is played a LOT in the US, by all sorts of stations. I heard it a lot in LA I was surprised. A bit like Journey songs over there.\n\nTwo other songs that really stood out as being played a lot in LA on multiple stations were Into The Groove / Madonna and Wanna Be Starting Something / MJ. Both seemed to hit the perfect note driving on those endless crazy freeways and I can’t get them out of my head since…\n\nYes - The Wave another well positioned station. It highlights the variety that LA has. I also loved KTWV when it had the unique for the time Smooth Jazz format but I suppose the ratings show that the current format is more popular.\n\nI also saw your KCBS Jack FM log which is yet another great station. LA seems be flooded with choice with stations from adjacent areas also in the mix. KCBS used to have a “all rock n roll oldies” format in the past when it was Arrow FM."
