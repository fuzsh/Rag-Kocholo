        "text": "Town in Monroe County, New York, United States\n\nTown in New York, United States\n\nWebster is a town in the northeastern corner of Monroe County, New York, United States. The town is named after orator and statesman Daniel Webster. The population was 42,641 at the 2010 census. The town's motto is \"Where Life Is Worth Living.\"[3] The town contains a village also named Webster. It is located in the Rochester Metropolitan Area.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe town of Webster is bordered on the north by Lake Ontario, on the east by Wayne County, on the west by Irondequoit Bay and the town of Irondequoit, and on the south by the town of Penfield.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.5 square miles (91.9 km2), of which 33.5 square miles (86.8 km2) is land and 2 square miles (5.2 km2) is water.[4]\n\nWebster Park covers 550 acres (2.2 km2) of the town's land along the Lake Ontario waterfront.[5]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18402,235—18502,4469.4%18602,6508.3%18702,7493.7%18802,9507.3%18903,1396.4%19003,2995.1%19103,75513.8%19203,9765.9%19304,77820.2%19405,52015.5%19507,17430.0%196016,434129.1%197024,73950.5%198028,92516.9%199031,6399.4%200037,92619.9%201042,64112.4%202045,3276.3%2022 (est.)45,3350.0%\n\nAs of the 2020 United States Census, there were 45,327 people, 19,432 households, and 12,483 families residing in the town. The population density was 1,352.4 inhabitants per square mile (522.2/km2).

Whig farmers from North Penfield, who were part of Webster's audience, were so impressed by his eloquence that when they petitioned the state legislature for separate town status from Penfield, they chose to name it in his honor. On February 6, 1840, the northern part of Penfield was officially established as the town of Webster, with a population of 2,235.[11] Webster has its own museum dedicated to sharing the town's history with its citizens. The museum has many permanent historical displays and also features changing displays for different times of the year.\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nWebster's public schools are under the direction of the Webster Central School District (K-12). While all of its middle schools (Spry, Willink) and high schools (Thomas, Schroeder) are situated in the Town of Webster, only five of its seven elementary schools (DeWitt Road, Klem North, Klem South, Schlegel Road, State Road) are.\n\nAdditionally, there are several privately run schools:\n\nHillside Children's Center Halpern Education Center (grades 6–12), secular\n\nLakeside Alpha (grades 3–12), Christian Brethren\n\nRochester Christian School (grades pre-K–8), Calvinist\n\nSt. Rita School (grades pre-K–6), operated by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester\n\nWebster Early Learning Center (grades pre-K–1), secular\n\nWebster Montessori School (elementary), ¾ mile south of the town line in Penfield, serves students in the Webster school district\n\nSports community\n\n[edit]\n\nOn May 15, 2005, Webster was awarded the title of \"Number 1 Sportstown in New York\" by Sports Illustrated. SI Publisher David Morris said that \"Webster's commitment to finding creative and resourceful ways to enhance sports for the well-being of its community fits perfectly with the principles of our Sportstown program, as well as the overall mission of our anniversary celebration.\"\n\nWebster is part of the section V (Five) New York State Public High School Athletic Association along with the rest of Monroe County, Wayne, Livingston, Yates, Seneca, Steuben, Wyoming, Genesee, Orleans and Allegany.\n\nThe Webster Schroeder High School football team has won three New York State Championships in Class AA (a designation based on number of students). At one point, they had a winning streak of 31 games. In the USA Today High School football Super 25, Schroeder was, at one time, ranked #21 in the nation. At least five Webster players have gone on to play Division 1 college football at Syracuse, Michigan and Colgate, among others.\n\nIn March 2008, the Webster Thomas High School hockey team, in only its sixth year of competition, won the New York State Championship in Division II, beating Thousand Islands by a score of 5-2. The Webster Thomas soccer team also has won the sectional title 3 years in a row and went on to the state finals in 2007. The soccer team has produced two division 1 soccer athletes both attending Colgate University. The men's lacrosse team won a sectional title in 2009 and has produced many division 1 athletes under Coach Rob Ruller. The women's Lacrosse team has also won a section V title in 2007.\n\nWebster's sports facilities include two lighted stadiums, a hockey/soccer complex, an indoor track and an Olympic-size indoor pool.\n\nWebster has several sports clubs including the Webster Cyclones (youth hockey), Webster Lacrosse Club, and Webster Soccer Association. The annual Webster Lakefront Classic, run by the Webster Soccer Association, is one of the largest soccer tournaments in the Greater Rochester area and takes place annually on Father's Day weekend.\n\nWebster is also home to a summer collegiate wood bat team, the Lake Ontario Ridgemen. The Ridgemen play in the New York Collegiate Baseball League. Their home games are played at Basket Road Stadium. The Ridgemen are run by an organization called Athletes in Action.\n\nIn 2014, the Webster Schroeder hockey team won the NYSPHSAA State Championship, beating Beekmantown by a score of 2–0.\n\nPublic safety\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Webster Police Department protects the citizens of Webster as a New York State Law Enforcement Accreditation Council agency. Dennis Kohlmeier is the current Chief of the Department. It consists of around thirty sworn officers.\n\nFire protection is covered by two agencies. On the west side of town, the West Webster Fire District provides fire protection. It is an all-volunteer department. Fire stations are located on Gravel Road, Backus Road, and Plank Road in Penfield.\n\nThe east of town, including the village, are protected by the North East Joint Fire District (Webster F.D.) It is an all-volunteer department, as it has been for over one hundred years. Fire stations located on South Avenue in the village, Phillips Road in the town and Plank Road in Penfield.\n\nAmbulance service for the Town is provided by Webster EMS. North East Quadrant Advanced Life Support Inc. provides ALS care for all patients in need. Webster and West Webster fire departments provide EMS separate from ambulance depending on the severity of the call.\n\nHomicides\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 7, 2011, 15-year-old Michael Pilato poured gasoline over his house in Webster and set it on fire, killing his father and two brothers (16 and 12 years old) as his mother and teenage sister escaped with injuries. In June 2013, Pilato was convicted of second-degree murder, attempted murder, murder by arson, and arson; he was subsequently sentenced to life in prison.[12]\n\nMain article: 2012 Webster shooting\n\nDuring the predawn hours of December 24, 2012, 62-year-old William Spengler ambushed volunteer firefighters from the West Webster Fire Department, shooting and killing two and seriously wounding two others as they arrived to put out a car fire on Lake Road. Investigators later determined the fire was started by Spengler.[13] Ultimately seven homes were destroyed because fire fighters were unable to extinguish the flames until the scene was made safe by law enforcement. Volunteer fire fighters Mike Chiapperini (also a lieutenant with the Webster Police Department) and Tomasz Kaczowka died at the scene. Theodore Scardino and Joseph Hofstetter remained hospitalized with serious injuries.[14] John Ritter, a policeman from nearby Greece, New York, happened to be in the area, and was injured by shrapnel.[15]\n\nSpengler had armed himself with three guns: a .38-caliber revolver, a 12-gauge shotgun, and a .223-caliber Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle outfitted with a flash suppressor.[14] Spengler had served 17 years in jail for manslaughter, having been convicted in 1981 of beating his 92-year-old grandmother to death with a hammer in 1980. He shot and killed himself as a SWAT team approached.[16] Later, human remains believed to be those of his elder sister, with whom he had feuded, were found in his house.[17] On December 28, 2012, 24 year-old Dawn Nguyen of Rochester, New York, was arrested and charged in connection with furnishing Spengler with certain weapons in his arsenal which were used in the ambush. In September 2014, she was convicted and sentenced to 8 years in prison.[18][19] The New York State Senate subsequently included a \"Webster provision\" in a gun control law passed in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, mandating life without parole for murderers of emergency personnel.[20]\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nElma Bellini - New York Supreme Court Justice\n\nJoseph L.
