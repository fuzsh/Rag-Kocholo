WJTN features informative and entertaining programming during the day. WJTN has hourly newscasts to keep our community informed and showcases local sports talent with football, basketball and hockey play-by-play. WJTN is proud to be involved with the local community. Often you will see our staff volunteering in clubs and organizations. Core Artists Include: Adele, Billy Joel, Celine Dion, Chicago, Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, Hall & Oates, Phil Collins, Whitney Houston, Michael Buble and more!\n\nObsessed with radio since he was a kid, TJ Taormina made his way from interning, to a co-host of Elvis Duran and the Z100 Morning Show in NYC (working on staff for 10+ years.) In 2013, TJ began hosting his own morning show on Boston’s 103.3 Amp Radio and his passion for radio is deeper than ever. TJ was the kid who walked to school with his headphones plugged into his radio. Having discovered morning talk shows as a 13 year old while growing up in Hillsdale, NJ, he became hooked. In high school, he started working in radio as a volunteer. He held many positions at his first official radio job including answering phones, producing, and eventually becoming a co-host on Elvis Duran’s nationally syndicated radio show. TJ began hosting his own morning radio show (The TJ Show) in Boston in early 2013. TJ is married to his wife, Jess. They have 3 girls and a Labrador retriever named Luna. Connect with TJ online. THE TJ SHOW AIRS MONDAY-FRIDAY FROM 6:00-10:00 A.M.!\n\nDan Warren: I grew up in Dunkirk NY and started working in radio while in high school. I am a SUNY Alfred and SUNY Fredonia graduate. I worked at WDOE in Dunkirk, WBUZ in Fredonia and WPHD in Buffalo. I also spent some time at WCCF in Punta Gorda, Florida. I started working in Jamestown radio in 1985 and have been here ever since. I love sharing community news, events and brining up topics about the local community. If you have a community event you would like promoted on our station please email me at Dan@MediaOneRadioGroup.com. Thank you for listening and supporting local radio in the tri-county area! DAN WARREN IS ON WJTN MONDAY-FRIDAY FROM 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM!\n\nAs a child, I would sit at our kitchen table and listen to the old radio on our counter belt out the sound of the morning \"Disc Jockey\". He would introduce the Top 40 Hits, give the weather forecast, talk to the \"Characters\" that called in, do interviews and contests. Radio was very \"Magical\" to me. I began pretending I was a \"Disc Jockey\" when I was about ten years old and actually have a tape of me when I was twelve, hosting the \" Lee John Morning Show\", doing interviews, comedy, telling stories and giving a \"Play by Play\" account of the \"GUY LOMBARDO NEW YEARS EVE PARTY\" on the TV. I started to do impressions when I was a kid, like Ed Sullivan, W.C. Fields, Kermit the Frog, etc. By the time I was 16 years old I did over 100 voices. I entertained at parties, fairs, and in theater productions in High School and did some voiceover work for my local radio station. I got my first job in Radio during my first year in College.
