        "text": "Location: On Lake Ontario; Town of Webster; Monroe County; New York.\n\nMaps: Google Map; Topographic; Interactive; Park Map; Trail Map\n\nGPS Coordinates:\n\nCampground entrance: N 43.25946 / W 77.45204\n\nKanatota lodge entrance: N 43.25834 / W 77.45872\n\nPark entrance: N 43.25805 / W 77.45990\n\nHold Rd. entrance: N 43.25683 / W 77.44666\n\nDirections: Take NY-104 to Bay Rd in Webster. Head north. Bay Rd. ends at Lake Rd. Go east (right) for about 4 miles and park entrances will be on either side of Lake Rd. Or use Google Maps.\n\nParking: Lakefront parking can be found off of Lake Rd just west of Holt Rd. There’s a short driveway that can be easily missed. Additional lakefront parking can be found at Kanatota Lodge just to the west and the White House Lodge to the east. Parking in the wooded area of the park can be found near each lodge, or near the Holt and Lake Rd Intersection. Below is a map showing all the different places to park. There is space for over a hundred cars.\n\nAlso known as: Webster Beach Park, Kanatota Beach\n\nJust east of Rochester and Irondequoit Bay, Webster Park encompasses 550 acres of wooded hills, flowing creeks, a few playing fields and a sliver of developed lakefront access. It is one of the few Monroe County facilities to offer camping sites, with 40 water/electric sites and showers. The park also features five enclosed and well-equipped lodges (two of which are lakefront), and eight pavilions (two lakefront). The number and quality of shelters here make this park a popular spot for large get-togethers.\n\nBeyond the modern developments, what makes Webster Park so special is the geology. Three creeks (West, East and Mill Creek) run through the park, cutting through small glacial drumlins (hills) as they make their way toward Lake Ontario. The result is a fertile expanse of rolling hills and rushing water. With the lakefront angled toward the west, the sun sets clearly over the lake in the summer months, a favorite spot for area photographers.\n\nPopular year-round, people come in warm weather to camp, hike and enjoy the lake views. The lakefront is often used by casual fishermen who can cast from the concrete pier — also a favorite for couples to sit and watch the sun set over the lake. Five hiking trails offer easy to moderate walks throughout the park over rolling hills and along the many creeks.\n\nIn the winter months, the trails fill with cross-country skiers, the hills are spotted with families sledding. When there is snow, this is easily one of the busiest recreational areas in the region.\n\nIt is unfortunate that this beautiful park has such a flawed lakefront. Summer visitors will notice it immediately as they step out of their cars in the Lake Rd parking lot. The smell of the water coming out of Mill Creek is almost unbearable to some, while others have gotten used to it. What causes the stink? Why is the water here so slimy and green?\n\nDownstream in the town, treated sewage water enters a branch of Mill Creek near Wall Rd. The water passes through residential districts and near farmland, picking up nutrient-rich runoff along the way. When it approaches the park, it slows down and is pretty much stagnant as it reaches the lake. Several more factors here contribute to the problem: the combination of the breakwall at the outlet and the fishing pier just to the east, prevent the lake’s current from circulating with the creek’s discharge. In addition, several other nutrient-rich sources (including the other creeks in the park, Irondequoit Bay and the Genesee River) join the lake upcurrent from this site. These nutrient-rich waters cause algal blooms, which further stagnate the water with green slime and a putrid smell. Visitors who feed the ducks and geese at the park only compound the problem.\n\nConsidering the high property values in this neighborhood, and especially for the adjoining properties, one would think this problem would be a priority. The smell seems to calm down during early spring and on windy days. We visited no less than 8 times in the last several years, only to find the smell still there, if not stronger each subsequent visit."
