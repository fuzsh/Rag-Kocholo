        "text": "1958\n\nThe story begins. Rochester Area Educational Television Association (RAETA) is organized. Charter is granted to RAETA by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York. Almost all 13 Trustees had been nominated by educational and cultural institutions. The prime intent of the founding Trustees was to provide educational programming via television (Educational Television—ETV) with a major focus on broadcasting to classrooms. First officers elected were Dr. Howard Seymour, President; Dr. Donal Tower, Vice President; Mr. Harold Hacker, Secretary; and Msg. Charles Boyle, Treasurer. The first paid staff member was Mr. Lee Edwards who worked part-time as an executive secretary.\n\n1959\n\nOffice space for RAETA is provided by the City School District in the old East High School at 410 Alexander Street. Assignment: The World premieres. Today Assignment: The World is the longest-running instructional program on television.) Lloyd Kaiser, the first staff to be employed, began producing ETV programs for RAETA. The first program series was College Next Fall.\n\n1960\n\nAn educational series is produced for elementary students. Through borrowed airtime, 60-90 minutes of programming is broadcast each weekday morning on local commercial television stations.\n\n1961\n\nThe five-year quest for a broadcast license begins—first to operate an Educational Television station on Channel 13, then to establish UHF Channel 21. Application is made to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for Channel 13 in Rochester.\n\n1962\n\nWXXI tapes several educational series and broadcasts them over commercial stations. Congress approves the Educational Broadcasting Facilities Act, which provides $32 million to help communities activate new stations. Congress passes the All Channel Receiver Act, which requires television set manufacturers to produce units with UHF as well as VHF reception capacity.\n\n1963\n\nRAETA presents its first program produced in its own production center, which was in the basement of Old East High School at 410 Alexander Street. It is broadcast on Channel 13. Beaumont Newhall of the Eastman House and The Daguerreotypes are broadcast.\n\n1964\n\nThe Hearing Examiner’s decision in RAETA’s favor was issued in January; the Commission held its oral hearing in November.\n\n1965\n\nThe New York State Legislature approved the requests of Governor Rockefeller, the State Education Department, and the State University for funds to expand the state’s ETV facilities. Included in the 1965-66 budget was a $250,000 capital grant toward an ETV station in Rochester and funds to establish a statewide ETV network by the State University. The money earmarked for Rochester, however, had to be matched locally no later than March 31,1966. FCC issued a most surprising Memorandum Opinion and Order. They announced the hearing would be reopened in which RAETA would be required to demonstrate why it should not be assigned UHF Channel 21 and ABC would be given an opportunity to express its displeasure with our share-channel proposal and to state whether it would affiliate with Rochester Telecasters (RTI), RAETA’s partner. RAETA’s board met on May 27, to assess the impact of the FCC action and to adopt a course of action. The Trustees decided to protest the FCC decision and to petition the Commission to reverse itself. They also decided to begin an immediate investigation of the costs of activating and operating UHF 21 (and of the reaction of the schools and colleges to UHF). RAETA and RTI jointly filed a strongly worded petition for reconsideration with the FCC. Meanwhile, representatives of our eight commercial opponents made an offer to reimburse RAETA fully for all expenses incurred in the Channel 13 case. An agreement was made between three of the companies for full reimbursement if WXXI withdrew from the hearing, subject to approval of the FCC. It was estimated then that this would amount to approximately $75,000, of which $8,500 was owed to WXXI’s attorneys. It was the intention to apply the difference toward the Channel 21 capital budget. RAETA board met to make a final decision. After a review of the proposed capital and operating budgets and of potential sources of income for both, the trustees voted to authorize Mr. Hacker to take all the necessary steps to activate Channel 21. They adopted a Capital and Development Budget of $847,000 and voted to start an immediate local campaign to raise $425,000. Mr. Hacker also sought permission of the FCC to withdraw from the Channel 13 hearing. On September 24, a public announcement was made about the two decisions. Work on the Capital and Development Fund campaign for Channel 21 began. Because of stringent deadline dates for applying for state and federal funds, the Board set a 90-day time limit to raise $425,000 in the Rochester area—without a formally organized campaign in the usual Rochester tradition. Under the leadership of Trustee Tom Hawks, RAETA Trustees presented a case for Channel 21 to corporation and foundation officials. The response from Rochester business firms and foundations was both generous and speedy. They recognized WXXI’s unusual predicament and agreed to contribute the vast percentage of the local campaign goal. The Board then conducted a limited solicitation of known supporters by mail. In January 1966, all cash and pledges were raised.\n\n1966\n\nThe end of the quest for a broadcast license. On September 6, 1966, UHF channel 21 becomes a reality, broadcasting 10 hours of programming, five days a week. Three remotes are produced this year, using rented and borrowed equipment. John Porter becomes General Manager.\n\n1967\n\nPublic affairs efforts continue to grow. Congress passes the Public Broadcasting Act, establishing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to promote growth of the industry. New York State educational TV stations form a network and with 17 other stations create the Eastern Educational Network (EEN). Carnegie Commission on Education Television publishes report, “Public Television: A Program for Action.” Commission report initiates the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, establishing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), a private nonprofit corporation established to foster the growth and development of public television and radio stations. Channel 21 begins weekend broadcasting.\n\n1968\n\nChannel 21 broadcasts election previews, the city-school budget hearing and 40 half-hour cultural and public affairs programs called Rochester Eye. WXXI connects to the statewide New York Network system.\n\n1969\n\nThe first Channel 21 Auction is held. With the help of 70 volunteers, $75,000 is raised.
