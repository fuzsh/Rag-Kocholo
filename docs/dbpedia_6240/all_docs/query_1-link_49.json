Click here to subscribe.NewsHD Radio Alliance Rolls out �Discover HD� Campaign\n\nA bevy of new spots extolling the hidden benefits of HD Radio are being distributed on the Internet, courtesy of the HD Radio Digital Radio Alliance. The spots feature a new creative and branding initiative, featuring a �Discover It!� tagline, online marketing elements and the involvement of new agency and retail partners. The spots invite consumers to discover HD secondary channels, referred to in the spots as �stations between the stations� available only to consumers with HD Radio digital receivers.The initiative is just part of a $200 million dollar HD Radio advertising campaign promised last December. The campaign is intended to launch in 22 new markets and 28 existing HD Radio markets, airing in 43 of the top 50 markets on alliance member-owned stations.In a complementary move, the HD Digital Radio Alliance”s consumer website, www.HDRadio.com, has beefed up its content, offering what it calls �greater multi-media impact� and improved information resources.Commercial partners in the campaign include Amazon, Radio Shack, Tweeter and Crutchfield, all as major retailers carrying digital radio receivers.Three agency partners had a hand in the new marketing effort, joining existing alliance agencies Brainerd Communicators and Texas Creative. The �Discover It!� tag line was developed by New York branding agency Siegel and Gale, and the creative element was developed by Via Now, Clear Channel Radio Creative Services Group and Texas Creative.The new spots can be heard at www.hdradioalliance.com/commercials.php.Ibiquity FM HD Mask Revision on File at FCC\n\nIbiquity Digital has filed a revised RF emission mask for HD hybrid FM digital operation with the FCC that includes a slight relaxation over previous specifications. According to the July filing by Ibiquity Counsel Robert Mazer, the emission mask contains �minor adjustments from the previously filed Ibiquity digital emission mask.� The letter explains that the �minor changes are based on additional analysis and real world experience.�Actual changes reflected in the new filing appear to relax the acceptable emission levels just slightly in first-, second- and third-adjacent channels. Specifications for deriving average levels also appear to have been modified.A PDF copy of this filing is available at: gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/ecfs/retrieve.cgi?native_or_pdf=pdf&id_document=6518391672.BusinessHD Radio Seminar to Kick off NAB Radio Show\n\nBroadcast Electronics (BE) will once again take its free HD Radio Seminar on the road, this time opening up the NAB Radio Show in Dallas on Sept. 19. The seminar, entitled “HD Radio: All the Basics and More,” will be held from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. in the Miro Room at the Hilton Anatole in Dallas on Tuesday, Sept. 19, with a second session on Wednesday, Sept. 20, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. in the Anatole”s Travertine Room.This year”s seminar will be divided into three, one-hour sessions focused on issues facing program directors, station managers and engineers now planning for a HD Radio conversion or whose stations already have HD Radio on the air.The first session, �HD Radio Conversion: Processes, Pitfalls, Strategies and Successes,� will examine HD Radio”s impact on station operations, listeners and the bottom line, with particular emphasis on management and programmer roles.The second session, �HD Radio Conversion: Technical Planning and Realization� concerns the evolution of HD Radio hardware, how it interfaces with analog station infrastructure and upcoming developments.The final session, �HD Radio Conversion: Nuts and Bolts Technical Issues,� will survey a variety of lessons learned during hundreds of radio station digital conversion projects across the United States, presented by BE”s engineering staff.The session is open and free to broadcasters, but advanced registration is suggested. More information on the event is available at www.bdcast.com/bulletins/NABRadioHDRadioSeminar/index.php.HD Radio May Expand Hispanic Radio Choices\n\nCrutchfield, a well-known catalog and online retailer of consumer electronics, believes that HD Radio is filling a pent-up demand for more Hispanic radio programming choices in the United States. The retailer says it”s responding by adding more information resources to its catalog and website services.According to Crutchfield, an increased number of HD Radio signals throughout the United States are resulting in a proliferation of new Hispanic-oriented channels. Many stations whose primary format is in English have now launched HD2 multicast channels that broadcast in Spanish. For example, in the Los Angeles market alone, there are now 12 channels available Hispanic formats, where only three existed prior to the introduction of HD Radio.Moreover, the company believes that the additional channels introduced by HD Radio have not only increased the quantity of Hispanic content available, but also the depth and quality. Classic Latino music stations are being joined by stations that play Romantica (KISQ 98.1-2, San Francisco), Tejano (KWID, 101.9-2, Las Vegas) Hispanic Talk, (KLLI 105.3-2, Dallas-Fort Worth), Spanish Oldies (KMGG, 95.7-2, Denver-Boulder) and Spanish Hits (KIZS, 101.5-2, Tulsa), to name a few — many of which might not have materialize prior to HD Radio multicasting”s introduction.Acting to meet the perceived spike in consumer demand for HD Radio receivers and resources, Crutchfield is increasing the level of Spanish content and the number of Spanish-speaking sales advisors in its free HD Radio learning center. In addition, the company”s website is also available in Spanish, accessed by clicking the “en espanol” tab on the Crutchfield home page at www.crutchfield.com.HD Radio on the Menu at ABU 2006\n\nHD Radio will take its place at the podium during the Asia-Pacific Broadcast Union”s Digital Radio Convention 2006, to be held Aug. 14-17 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The event targets regional broadcasting organizations facing decisions about when to move to digital radio, as well as how to do so in a strategic and cost-effective manner.The opening session of this year”s convention will examine digital radio standards. System choices under discussion will include DAB Eureka 147, DRM, HD Radio, ISDBTSB, Worldspace and DMB. Perry Priestly, Ibiquity”s director of international broadcast business development, will present the HD Radio portion of the session.Other speakers addressing the convention on behalf of HD Radio will include Neil Glassman, vice president strategic marketing for Broadcast Electronics; Mike Starling, NPR chief technology officer and president of NPR Labs; and Chuck Kelly, director of international sales for Broadcast Electronics.Harris and Broadcast Electronics will host booths on the convention floor, where demonstrations and displays of both digital transmission systems and receivers will take place.For more information on the event, go to www.abu.org.my/public/compiled/p663.htm.Eye on IBOCVermont Gets First Taste of HD Radio\n\nThe hardy souls of northern Vermont now have HD Radio to go with their maple syrup and flapjacks in the morning, as Vermont Public Radio’s WVPR 89.5-FM became the first station in that state to originate an HD Radio hybrid signal on July 19. According to Vermont Public Radio (VPR) spokesperson Leah Hollenberger, WVPR will begin multicasting two programming services, a mix of NPR and regional news and music on HD1 digital channel, while HD2 will feature VPR Classical, a 24-hour classical music service, sometime this fallLike many other public radio organizations, VPR operates several stations and translators across the state. Hollenberger said the group is committed to converting these outlets to HD over the next two years.Ibiquity Adding to Automotive Team\n\nIbiquity Digital is expanding its automotive team to meet increased demand for HD Radio implementation support in new vehicles. The company”s new hires in the United States and Germany come on the heels of an OEM marketing initiative in Japan, where it hired Sanyo Trading Co., an international trader and sales rep. firm, to provide additional HD Radio resources to Japanese automakers.Gereon Joachim is now senior manager of Ibiquity”s OEM business development based in Cologne, Germany, and will head the firm”s outreach to European automakers. Joachim has day-to-day responsibility for support of Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Volvo and European-based suppliers like Bosch and Siemens.Ibiquity has also added Richard Zeichner as manager for dealer programs and Erin Burns as a sales engineer at its Pontiac, MI, automotive program headquarters. Zeichner, former national sales manager for Visteon, will help dealers find ways to supply customers with HD Radio, where factory installed options are currently limited or unavailable. He will work directly with the dealers, expediters and jobbers. One of Zeichner”s first responsibilities is to develop a dealer-education program.Burns, a veteran of Siemens VDO and Sentek (both in Michigan), will provide technical support to the U.S.-based sales/marketing staff working with Chrysler, Hyundai, Honda, Toyota and Nissan.IBOC Across AmericaIBOC by State: New York\n\nIbiquity has a list of stations that have licensed HD Radio technology. IBOC by state will look at various states and list the stations that are making the transition.MarketStationMain FormatHD2 FormatHD3 FormatOwner Albany-Schenectady-Troy WAMC-FM 90.3 Nws/Tlk/Inf –WAMC/Northeast Public Radio Albany-Schenectady-Troy WDCD-AM 1540 ChrsContemp –Crawford Broadcasting Company Albany-Schenectady-Troy WGNA-FM 107.7 Country –Regent Albany-Schenectady-Troy WHRL-FM 103.1 Alternative –Clear Channel Radio Albany-Schenectady-Troy WKKF-FM 102.3 CHR – -Clear Channel Radio Albany-Schenectady-Troy WOFX-AM 980 Sports – -Clear Channel Radio Albany-Schenectady-Troy WPTR-FM 96.7 ChrsContemp WDCD-AM -Crawford Broadcasting Company Albany-Schenectady-Troy WPYX-FM106.5 Clsc Rock – -Clear Channel Radio Albany-Schenectady-Troy WRVE-FM 99.5 Adult Rock –Clear Channel Radio Albany-Schenectady-Troy WTRY-FM 98.3 Oldies – -Clear Channel Radio Auburn WDWN-FM 89.1 Alternative – -Cayuga County Community College Buffalo-Niagara Falls WBLK-FM 93.7 Urban AC TBD – CBS Radio Buffalo-Niagara Falls WDCX-FM 99.5 Religion Contemporary Christian -Crawford Broadcasting Company Buffalo-Niagara Falls WECK-AM 1230 Nostalgia — CBS Radio Buffalo-Niagara Falls WJYE-FM 96.1 Soft Rock TBD -Cumulus CBS Radio Buffalo-Niagara Falls WKSE-FM 98.5 CHR – – Entercom Communications Corp.
