        "text": "Rochester's first and still only exclusive, all inclusive, clean, premier bird store is now 34 years young. All birds all the time, nothing else.\n\nThanks for finding Birds Unlimited. We honestly believe that there's not a better place to purchase an exotic pet bird or bird supplies. Thirty four years in business and now in our seventeenth year at the Webster location. Overall, 50 years I've been handling, training, and breeding large parrots. I can't think of anyone in the area who comes close. I'd like to think that one of the best bird stores in the country, voted on by you nice customers at BirdChannel.com in 2008, is now even better. Thanks.\n\nWebster is just about 3 miles East of Rochester. Just a stones throw from beautiful Irondequoit Bay. If you need help picking out a bird, a toy, or a playpen, just ask. We will never push a bird on you! Don't fall into the trap of being sold what a store has in stock. Get what is right for you, we can help! We may even talk you out of the idea of getting a bird if we don't honestly think it's a good fit for your home. We're just looking out for the birds. We have a great selection of baby parrots, all hand fed, well socialized, and all New York State legal (properly banded).\n\nOther pet stores, veterinary hospitals, humane societies, and zoos regularly refer their customers to us (they also shop here). That should give you the idea to check us out first. We also have not, and will not ever sell birds at a \"Bird Mart\", flea market, or bird sale. We are also NOT affiliated with any so called bird \"rescues\", even if they tell you otherwise. We also do not post ads or buy birds to resell from web sites like Craigslist or other internet sites.\n\nThere's a lot going on here so take your time and be sure to check out the links page. Lots of great bird info can be found there. The FAQ pages have a lot of information on it as well, all my own information, nothing taken from another web site because I thought it sounded good. From training and behavior to how the store got started, need to find a vet, it's all there. All this and no dirty words or nudity, hard to find a kid friendly web site these days (if you need help finding dirty words or nudity just ask me when you get here, just kidding... kinda, ok yea I can probably help with that too).\n\nThe Store\n\nOnce you get to the store you'll probably wonder why you ever shopped at another pet store (unless you needed fish food, a hamster or a dog bone, or something other than bird stuff), but I tell you we've got stuff for birds, lots of it. Even the big \"super stores\" for pets can't come close to what we have. Not to mention the \"super stores\" don't have the staff with background that we have, and they won't spend as much time with you as we will. Stay until all your questions are answered. Farm & Garden stores, department stores, and \"super pet stores\" really can't come close to what we offer, that's why so many of their employees shop here (and you won't find fertilizer in the next aisle). Hopefully you'll leave knowing more about birds than when you came in.\n\nYou can buy a bird from another store, but you can't buy one from a better store. Since we opened in 1990 we've sent home thousands of baby birds. While most find homes locally, our babies now reside in all parts of the country, as well as Canada, and Singapore. We've raised birds for zoos, (ZooAtlanta, Seneca Park Zoo), and the Strong Museum Butterfly exhibit. All of the birds at Birds Unlimited are raised in captivity, none are taken from the wild. All of our birds are within the guidelines of the New York State Wild Bird Law (many stores are not). Most of the birds are raised locally while many of the larger parrots come to us from Florida. New birds arrive almost weekly throughout the year. Your greatest selection will be between May and September as this is their breeding season. We hand feed hundreds of babies each year from the tiny parrotlets to the huge macaws. We don't let any of the babies leave until they are weaned. Weaning time varies from 8 to 20 weeks or more depending on the species. Cockatoos especially seem to take forever to wean. Don't know what bird you want? The staff can help you make a smart choice for your lifestyle and environment. Stop in and see why people from across the state travel to shop at Birds Unlimited.\n\nThe Staff\n\nThese people love to talk about birds, they love to get the birds out and handle them, and they love to show them off to the customer, and thankfully they like to clean up after them. If you've a question about birds, just ask. A couple of them have gone on to be vet techs, vet students, and veterinarians, worked at zoos and the National Aviary, nice. Hopefully when you leave you'll know more about birds than when you came in, if you don't then we're not doing our job. The staff is required to pass basic avicultural courses so that they are confident about helping customers. These people are not only great, they are the best in the area, I couldn't do this without them. Most were customers before they were employees.\n\n\"What, is this all you can say about us\" is what I got when they saw this. I can't win."
