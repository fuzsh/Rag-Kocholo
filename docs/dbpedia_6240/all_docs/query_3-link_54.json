        "text": "“ Bringing your newborn to day care, and in our case, our first child can be very scary. You are trusting someone else with your child, hoping your child will connect with the teachers and other babies and that everything goes OK and they don't spend their day in tears. Well the only one that ended up in tears all day was me. Abigail was fine. In fact, she did better than I could have imagined. And of course after day one, I was fine too, despite thinking I was going to cry every single day I dropped her off. There is a reason I didn't cry every single day - KinderCare is that reason - and the infant room teachers specifically. I have never in my life felt so comfortable with leaving her somewhere and I have never felt so welcome. They were so nurturing and accommodating not just to my three-month-old, but to me. And that is exactly what I needed. Now my tears occur from the adorable art projects they send home and the personal touches and the day to day activities they do with my daughter. I am just as excited to drop her off at day care each morning as I am to pick her up because I know she is going to have a fun and enriching day. I tell everyone I know about the KinderCare in Webster and the amazing staff. They have allowed me and my husband to continue working and feel 100% confident in her care while we are busy at our jobs each day. Our daughter is nine months old now and is literally jumping out of our arms when she sees her teachers. We honestly could not ask for more and are so thankful that we took the tour and brought her there. By far one of the best decisions we have made for our daughter so far. A big thank you to everyone at Webster KinderCare for making our family feel so welcome and for the amazing care you provide Abby each day!\n\nShow more\n\nKristin - KinderCare Parent\n\n“ We started with KinderCare in April of 2012. We have three children that now attend KinderCare, ages 1, 2 and 6. We have nothing but excellent things to say about the staff and the program. The kids absolutely love to go to KinderCare everyday and look forward too going back when they have been absent. The amount of development that we have observed in our kids is astronomical. Our one and two-year-olds are learning sign language and well beyond their years in educational development. The school age program is helping prepare my six-year-old son to exceed in his first grade class and beyond. We feel right at home each and every time we walk through the doors of our KinderCare Webster location. We never worry throughout the day whether or not the kids are being taken care of as if they were right at home with one of us. Kudos to the staff at KinderCare. They truly care about the kids!\n\nShow more\n\nHerlanna J. - KinderCare Parent"
