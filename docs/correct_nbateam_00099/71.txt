The Chicago Bulls will reportedly sign veteran center Nazr Mohammed, according to Peter Vescey and Tim Bontemps of The New York Post. Mohammed had been rumored to be in talks with the Brooklyn Nets to backup Brook Lopez, but the Nets have reportedly been told that Mohammed will sign with Chicago:

A league source confirmed late Saturday night that the Bulls are on the verge of signing veteran center Nazr Mohammed.

This will be his eighth NBA team since being selected 29th overall in the 1998 Draft by the Utah Jazz. Though he played only 11 minutes per game last season for the Oklahoma City Thunder, the 6'10" Mohammed will provide experience and size in a Bulls frontcourt of Joakim Noah, Taj Gibson and Carlos Boozer. Vladimir Radmanovic, who averaged 15 minutes per game last season for the Atlanta Hawks, was signed by the Bulls in July to also provide depth at the forward position.
