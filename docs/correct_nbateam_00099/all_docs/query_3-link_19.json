        "text": "[jwplayer SJvFfL4z-z6KDnl0B]\n\nWith Troy Weaver leaving Oklahoma City to assume the general manager role for the Detroit Pistons, Sam Presti’s front office was likely to undergo some change.\n\nOn Tuesday, the team made it official, announcing the promotions of seven individuals of what it refers to as its executive team.\n\nPerhaps most notable among the promotions is that of Rob Hennigan. Hennigan, who is currently in his second stint with the franchise. Between his tenures in Oklahoma City, Hennigan departed Oklahoma City to assume the general manager role of the Orlando Magic. He would return to the franchise after being away for five years and most recently served as the Vice President of Insight and Foresight. He will now assume Weaver’s old role which was vacated when Weaver departed for Detroit — Vice President of Basketball Operations.\n\nAlong with Hennigan, Will Dawkins will share the role, also becoming Presti’s Vice President of Basketball Operations. Dawkins previously served as the organization’s Vice President of Identification and Intelligence.\n\nNazr Mohammed, who spent 18 seasons in the NBA, was also among the promotions. Mohammed will become the general manager of the Thunder G League affiliate, the Oklahoma City Blue. Since retiring as a member of the Thunder following the conclusion of the 2015-16 season, Mohammed has been ascending within the front office, participating in what the team called “an extensive post-playing transition program for former players with a curriculum designed by the team to prepare them for a transition to basketball operations.”\n\nAside from Hennigan, Dawkins and Mohammed, Jesse Gould, Wynn Sullivan, Brandon Barnett and Paul Johnson have also been promoted."
