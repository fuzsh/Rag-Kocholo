        "text": "<p>Atlanta Hawks general manager Billy Knight and coach Mike Woodson met with free agent center Erick Dampier Monday in Salt Lake City, a team spokesman said.</p><p>Hawks vice president of communications Arthur Triche confirmed Knight and Woodson met privately with Dampier in Utah, where the Hawks' summer league team is playing this month.</p><p>Dampier, a 6-foot-11 center who averaged 12.3 points and 12.0 rebounds last season, is weighing interest from the Hawks against a sign-and-trade offer from the New York Knicks.</p><p>The Hawks have re-signed center Jason Collier, who played in 20 games with the team late last season, and have added forward Al Harrington in a sign-and-trade deal with the Indiana Pacers. Collier provides depth, but the 260-pound Dampier would give the team a needed physical presence in their starting lineup.</p><p>The Hawks were denied in another attempt to bolster their front court when free agent forward Kenyon Martin turned down their six-year, $85 million offer to accept a similar deal with Denver last week.</p><p>The Hawks have the advantage of more salary cap room than most teams, including New York, in their efforts to sign the 30-year-old Dampier as a free agent. The Knicks have a deeper roster than the Hawks from which to talk trade with Golden State.</p><p>Golden State executive vice president of basketball operations Chris Mullin is pushing for a sign-and-trade deal with Dampier.</p><p>The Knicks have offered former Hawks center Nazr Mohammed and Othella Harrington for Dampier and would offer Dampier a six-year contract starting at $9 million per year, the New York Post reported. Dampier would have to accept the contract offer before agreeing to a trade.</p><p>\"Nothing is imminent right now,\" Mullin said Monday. \"We're talking about a lot of different scenarios. The good thing is there's really not a time frame. We have a lot of different options.\"</p><p>Dampier, a Mississippi native who was a standout at Mississippi State, could be closer to his home by signing with Atlanta, but he reportedly has concerns about the Hawks' chances to be a contender in the near future.</p><p>Under Knight, Woodson and a new ownership group, the Hawks had only five players on their roster entering the recent NBA draft.</p>"
