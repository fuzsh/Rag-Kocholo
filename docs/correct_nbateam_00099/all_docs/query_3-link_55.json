        "text": "NBA FINALS NOTEBOOK\n\nAUBURN HILLS – Isiah Thomas repeatedly has said the Knicks will address their center vacuum this offseason. Eddy Curry, Kwame Brown and Zydrunas Ilgauskas are free agent centers Thomas will pursue July 1.\n\nBut Nazr Mohammed still doesn’t understand. The Knicks had an up-and-coming center in their fold until Feb. 24, when Thomas traded the 6-10 Mohammed to the Spurs. Despite last night’s 102-71 Game 4 beating by Detroit, he remains two wins away from a championship.\n\n“That’s surprising to me,” Mohammed, 28, told The Post when asked about the trade. “I definitely thought I’d be there for a while. I definitely feel I’m showing I am a center in this league.\n\n“I’m a starting center in the Finals, which says a lot.”\n\nMost Knick fans ripped the trade that brought the Knicks veteran undersized power forward Malik Rose and two late first-rounders.\n\n“It’s disappointing to be traded but I’m so fortunate and blessed to be sent to a situation to compete for a championship,” Mohammed said.\n\nKurt Thomas, masquerading last season as the Knicks center, must be jealous. He privately desired a trade to his home state, as he’s talked longingly about his only goal of winning a title. He phoned Mohammed a few days ago.\n\n“When I talked to him, he was congratulating me,” Mohammed said. “He said go out there and take advantage of the situation. Everyone wants to be in the Finals.”\n\nAs he left for San Antonio the day of the trade, Mohammed told one Knick, “I’ll let you wear my ring this summer.”\n\n*\n\nCleveland’s LeBron James was in the house, perhaps watching his future boss, Larry Brown.\n\n“I don’t want to get involved. We’ll see what happens after the season is over,” James told ABC.\n\nBruce Bowen disputed Richard Hamilton‘s claim that the Pistons shooting guard is getting the short end of the stick from the officials. Hamilton said Wednesday Bowen plays so physically, it doesn’t resemble basketball.\n\n“It’s kind of like: What’s new,” Bowen said. “It gets kind of tiresome. You can’t just say, ‘Poor me, poor me.’ You never point the finger at the officials. As far as complaining, it’s not my style.”"
