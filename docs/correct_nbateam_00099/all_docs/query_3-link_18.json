        "text": "Nazr Mohammed is coming back to Oklahoma City.\n\nThe veteran center has agreed to a one-year extension with the Thunder that will keep him from becoming an unrestricted free agent on Friday.\n\nTerms of the deal were not immediately known. But according to a report by Yahoo! Sports, the contract is for $3.75 million.\n\nIt makes Mohammed, who backed up starter Kendrick Perkins last year, a relatively inexpensive but reliable option off the bench. Mohammed made $6,883,800 last season, and the reported value of his new deal is slightly more than $2 million above the minimum salary for a player with 10-plus years of service.\n\nBoth Mohammed, a 13-year veteran, and Thunder management had expressed their desire to get a new deal done. Thunder coaches and front office members were impressed with Mohammed's performance, professionalism and stabilizing veteran presence on a team that was one of the youngest in the league last season. And Mohammed, who was acquired in a deadline-day trade with Charlotte that sent D.J. White and Morris Peterson to the Bobcats, quickly grew attached to the Thunder organization and its group of young talent.\n\nMohammed couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday.\n\nBut on May 30, five days after the Thunder's season ended, Mohammed posted his reasons for wanting to remain in Oklahoma City to his Twitter account. “In OKC I have (a) chance 2 compete 4 a Championship, opportunity 2 share what I know (with) a young team, chance 2 learn how 2 run a top notch organization & unbelievable fans...”\n\nIn 24 games, seven as a starter, with the Thunder, Mohammed averaged 6.9 points and 4.8 rebounds in 17.9 minutes. He helped the Thunder reach the Western Conference Finals for the first time in the franchise's Oklahoma City era.\n\n“We are pleased to be able to keep Nazr in the Thunder family,” said Thunder general manager Sam Presti in a statement. “He is a valuable part of our organization both on and off the floor. His professionalism, experience and on-court play have had a positive impact on our young and evolving roster.”\n\nWith Mohammed returning, the Thunder keeps intact a quartet of centers that also includes Perkins and reserves Cole Aldrich and Byron Mullens. Mohammed's deal now leaves only Daequan Cook as the Thunder's lone free agent. The Thunder on Monday extended Cook a qualifying offer to officially make him a restricted free agent, giving the team the right to match any offer Cook might receive.\n\nUnlike Cook, who is coming off a rookie scale contract, Mohammed was eligible to come to terms on an extension before July 1. Mohammed was on the final year of a five-year deal he signed with Detroit in 2006."
