        "text": "Nazr Mohammed, whose shot blocking and rebounding helped lead Kentucky to the NCAA basketball championship, said Monday he would forgo a senior season and enter the NBA draft.\n\nMohammed, a 6-foot-10 center, said he would not hire an agent in order to protect his college eligibility in case he changes his mind before the June draft. He has until 48 hours prior to the draft to withdraw his name and return for a final year.\n\nBut Marty Blake, the NBA's director of scouting, said Smith contacted the league about Mohammed's potential in the draft. Blake said he told Smith: \"The guy's not ready to play.\"\n\nAnother season of college ball would help Mohammed in virtually every aspect -- educationally, emotionally, physically, artistically and financially, Blake said at the time.\n\n\"I'm in a great situation where I can explore my options,\" Mohammed said at a news conference, seated alongside coach Tubby Smith.\n\nMohammed led Kentucky in rebounding with 7.2 per game and blocked 75 shots. He hit 60 percent of his field goal attempts, mostly from short range, and developed a deft hook shot.\n\nIf drafted even as low as 29th, Mohammed would be guaranteed an aggregate $1.8 million for three seasons.\n\nJim Mitchell, a Lexington-based scout for the Los Angeles Clippers, estimated this spring that Mohammed would be among the top 20 draft picks.\n\nThe Wildcats have been in the Final Four of the NCAA tournament four times in the 1990s, including championships in 1996 and 1998. The biggest stars of the previous teams opted for early jumps to the NBA.\n\nJamal Mashburn, now of the Miami Heat, entered the 1993 draft. Antoine Walker and Ron Mercer, both of the Boston Celtics, left Kentucky after the 1996 and 1997 seasons, respectively.\n\nBut Smith said he tells recruits about players who get their degrees, not about a Kentucky pipeline to the NBA.\n\n\"Obviously, people see it,\" he said. \"That's not why we recruit kids, so they can leave early.\"\n\nÂ©1998 The Associated Press.
