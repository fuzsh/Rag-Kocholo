I believe that we r trying to get a fair deal but hope we don’t have to lose a season before both sides figure it out. Were suppose to be PARTNERS in this, let’s not mess it up. Cuz if there is no season…I love playing basketball too much to just sit and wait.\n\nNazr Mohammed: The only loyal people in sports are the fans for the most part. If u want loyalty then 1st u must show some loyalty. The lockout should be between the athletes and ownership. It’s already sad that fans & other entities are going to suffer but loyalty needs to be shown to someone. Firing people who were doing a good job to save money during a lockout u imposed is not cool."
