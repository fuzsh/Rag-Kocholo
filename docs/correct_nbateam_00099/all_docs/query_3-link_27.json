        "text": "After 17 seasons in the NBA, veteran center Nazr Mohammed is strongly considering hanging up his sneakers for good.\n\nIn a recent blog post, the 37-year-old revealed he's torn between continuing his playing career and possibly exploring other avenues like management and broadcasting. Mohammed writes:\n\nBut while I love playing basketball, I am considering moving on and taking advantage of some of the opportunities that are coming my way in the business of basketball. One of my goals is to one day become a general manager of an NBA team, and there are opportunities presenting themselves that will allow me to take a step in that direction and get my foot in the door ...\n\nThen there's always the elephant in the room, which is the fact that I caught the \"broadcast bug\" after attending the NBPA's Sportscaster U. program last month.\n\nIf he decides to lace up his kicks for one more run, Muhammed won't be willing to suit up for just anyone.\n\n\"I'm down to about 8-9 teams that I would consider playing for, but sometimes they may or may not need your services,\" he wrote.\n\n\"When you're a young player starting in this league, you just want to be on an NBA team. But at this point in my career, if I continue to play, I want to be part of a winning organization with a great coach and teammates that approach the game with the same professionalism that I have.\"\n\nMohammed has spent the last three seasons with the Chicago Bulls, averaging 1.2 points and 1.7 rebounds in 2014-15. He's also competed for he Philadelphia 76ers, Atlanta Hawks, New York Knicks, San Antonio Spurs, Detroit Pistons, Charlotte Bobcats (now Hornets), and Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nHe won the first and only NBA championship of his career in 2005 as a member of the Spurs.\n\nWhile Mohammed isn't giving himself a \"hard deadline,\" he hopes to come to a final decision on his future in the coming weeks."
