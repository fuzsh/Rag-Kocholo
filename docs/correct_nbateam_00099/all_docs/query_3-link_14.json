        "text": "On February 24th, 2005, the New York Knicks traded center Nazr Mohammed and guard Jamison Brewer to the San Antonio Spurs for forward Malik Rose, a 2005 1st round draft pick (David Lee) and a 2006 1st round draft pick (Mardy Collins).\n\nThe Knicks sent back $5.5 million in future salaries while receiving $27.3 million of Rose’s contract in the trade. The Spurs cleared $21 million in long term salary with this trade.\n\nNazr Mohammed was acquired by the Knicks in a five-player, three-team deal between the Knicks, Atlanta Hawks, and Milwaukee Bucks. Mohammed became the starting center for the Knicks after the trade and was a solid contributor averaging 10.3 PPG, and 8 RPG on 52% from the field and 66% from the charity stripe over 81 games with New York.\n\nDespite the individual success of Mohammed, New York struggled after a relatively solid 16-13 start during the 2004-05 season. Mohammed was one of the more trade-worthy assets with only one more year left on his deal.\n\nJamison Brewer was signed as a free agent by the New York Knicks prior to the 2004-05 season. He received spotty minutes as a backup guard averaging 1.7 PPG, 1.2 RPG, and 0.7 APG in 18 games.\n\nMalik Rose was a very important piece for the San Antonio Spurs of the late ‘90s and early 2000s. Acquired as a free agent in '97, Rose was undersized, but played with a ton of energy off of the bench and provided a spark and depth to the Spurs roster.\n\nHe won two championships with the Spurs and in eight seasons with San Antonio, Rose played in 509 games, averaging 7.4 PPG and 4.7 RPG while posting shooting percentages of 45% on FGs and 74% on FTs.\n\nPart of the explanation of Rose’s departure was the length of his contract, but the lack of playing time he received became a major problem between him and Spurs coach Greg Popovich (via Express-News):\n\nRose and Popovich bickered in recent years — “They were like an old married couple,” said one team source — but they continued to share respect for each other. Even in recent weeks, when Rose again was frustrated by his inconsistent role, he said he hoped to remain with the team.\n\nAfter the trade, Nazr Mohammed became a vital cog on the '05 champion San Antonio Spurs. He spent a year and a half with San Antonio platooning with Rasho Nesterovic at the center spot opposite Tim Duncan. After a solid finish to the 2004-05 season that saw Mohammed take the starting center position from Nesterovic late in the season and start in every playoff game, Mohammed would receive sporadic playing time in his one full season with the Spurs.\n\nIn 103 games with the Spurs, Mohammed averaged 6.2 PPG and 5.5 RPG while shooting 47% from the field and 72% from the free throw line. After one and a half seasons, Mohammed would go on to sign a five-year deal with the Detroit Pistons to replace center Ben Wallace.\n\nJamison Brewer was waived two days after the trade. He never played a game with San Antonio and would go on to sign in training camp with the New York Knicks for the next season. He was cut again by New York prior to the start of the 2005-06 season and never played another game in the NBA.\n\nMalik Rose would stay on the Knicks for about four seasons. His role and skills declined as time went on and he played the role of experienced vet and leader on the bench. Here’s a chart to show how dramatic the decline in his shooting was.\n\nBy the age of 31, Rose had lost much of the athleticism that helped him compensate for his lack of height. All of his shooting percentages went way down as it became harder for him to finish at the rim. His effectiveness at the rim was a major reason for the decline.\n\nRose averaged 4.0 PPG and 3.0 RPG while shooting 38% from the field and 77% from the charity stripe in 230 career games with the Knicks. He was dealt by the Knicks to the Oklahoma City Thunder for center Chris Wilcox in February of '09.\n\nThe 2005 first round draft pick that the Knicks acquired from San Antonio was used on forward David Lee from Florida with the 30th pick. Lee didn’t play many minutes his first season, but gradually improved from a solid rebounder/hustler to a very skilled big man with a unique midrange and passing game.\n\nLee averaged 13.8 PPG, 9.6 RPG, and 1.7 APG while shooting 56% from the field and 77% from the free-throw line in 368 career games with the New York Knicks. Lee made one All-Star team with New York during the 2009-10 season. That season he averaged 20.2 PPG, 11.7 RPG, 3.6 APG, and 1 SPG, while shooting 54% from the field and 81% from the free throw line.\n\nThe Knicks would sign-and-trade Lee to the Golden State Warriors after signing-and-trading for Amar'e Stoudemire from the Phoenix Suns in 2010.\n\nThe second first round pick that the Knicks acquired was used on guard Mardy Collins from Temple at number 29 in the 2006 draft.\n\nCollins is probably best known for initiating one of the worst NBA fights in modern league history when he committed a flagrant foul on Denver Nuggets guard J.R. Smith. The Knicks would deal Collins in the multi-player deal that sent Zach Randolph to the Clippers.\n\nNazr Mohammed after both Isiah Thomas and Stephon Marbury said in response to complaints about trade “It’s not like we traded Patrick Ewing” (via NY Daily News):\n\n“I didn’t take it as any disrespect, because the truth is, it’s not like I was here a long time. When I first got here, if someone would’ve said that you would’ve gotten two first-round picks for me, you guys probably would’ve laughed at that,” Mohammed said, “so it wasn’t a slap in the face. I know you’ve got to support your guys. He made the trade to make the team better.”\n\nOn his time with the Spurs after trade:\n\n“Whatever my role may be, I’m willing to accept it. Defense is what we hang our hat on. That’s all we talk about… . It’s an atmosphere where guys criticize each other and try to make each other better. There’s no ill will. We just try to make each other better.”\n\n“It’s kind of like if it’s not broken, don’t fix it. I’m just going to try to fit in wherever I can and rebound and defend. Those are two things you can be selfish at and still help the team.”\n\nMalik Rose (via Express-News):\n\n“I was very shocked. The worst I’ve ever felt was when I lost my brother. But this is the worst I’ve felt since then. It just hurts. I’m upset, but I’m not angry. Pop did what he had to do for the organization, and I’ll always understand that. \"I didn’t always agree with the things he did and he didn’t always agree with the things I did, but we loved each other. There are so many things he taught me that I’ve adopted into my lifestyle.”\n\nIn NBC Television Interview (via ESPN.com):\n\n“Thank you for everything you’ve given me and allowed me to do. Thank you for allowing me to make Texas my home … San Antonio my home. First and foremost, I wanna say thanks to [coach Gregg Popovich]. Pop has been great. And we’ve had our ups and downs, sometimes we’ve hated each other, but I know he knows that through it all I’ve respected him and loved him as a person and a lot of his views and a lot of his positions on things on life, not just basketball. I think he’s a brilliant person with a beautiful heart and I wish nothing but the best for him …”\n\nNew York Knicks president of basketball operations Isiah Thomas (via NY Times):\n\n“We are a work in progress. I’ve been here a year, and everything we have done has been about being a work in progress. With the salary cap being the way it is and the dollar figure that we’re at, it is a juggling act. We are constantly juggling, but in the process of juggling we have to keep an eye on how we are going to improve our team. The way we are going to improve our team is through the draft.”\n\nOn Malik Rose (via Express-News):\n\n“Malik is a high-energy player, and the fans are going to enjoy watching him play. In terms of his salary, a guy like Malik who is making $5 or $6 million a year is worthy of that contract. The two or three additional years that he has, I’m very comfortable paying those numbers. Those are not $12, $13 or $14 million numbers.”\n\nOn Nazr Mohammed:\n\n“When I look at what a true center is - and Nazr did a great job for us at the center position - we needed to get better at that position and we still need to get better at that position. I look at the way a lot of teams are playing with power forwards, as opposed to having true centers. Most of the East is playing that way and a lot of teams in the West are playing that way. Until you find someone who is really a true center who can dominate the paint the way Shaq does, you’re better off having just good, solid basketball players.”\n\nSan Antonio Spurs head coach Greg Popovich (Express-News):\n\n“Malik was really intelligent, really well-liked, but Nazr is just Nazr Mohammed. He can’t be anybody else. He has to be who he is. It’s not on him to replace anything in that regard. It’s on our team to continue to do what we’ve always done and be the group we’ve always been. I don’t have any doubt we’ll do that.”\n\nOn relationship with Malik Rose:\n\n“We’ve been together a long time. He doesn’t want to go, and were it not for the business involved, we wouldn’t want him to go. I’m so grateful for everything he’s done for us, on and off the court. But our responsibility is to the team as a whole, not one individual.”\n\nOn how hard it was to trade Rose (via Express-News):\n\n“Trading Malik was probably the hardest thing I’ve done since I’ve been here. He was intertwined with the fabric of the team so much. He’s a highly intelligent player, a leader in the locker room, somebody everybody respected. So we worried a great deal about the chemistry and the emotion of the team, and how they would react.”\n\nSpurs general manager R.C. Buford (via Express-News):\n\n“If Nazr buys into the system, he might be able to really help us. What’s also exciting is that he’s improved every year of his career. Malik is somebody we’re all close to. And he’s been a big part of our fiber and chemistry.”\n\nSpurs forward-center Tim Duncan in October of '05 (via Express-News):\n\n“I didn’t think it was the right move. One, for the fact I didn’t think it was making us any better; and two, for the fact we were trading my best friend. It’s worked out well, and although I miss Malik on a daily basis here, Nazr has been good for us. Credit the front office for that. We moved on.”\n\nSpurs guard Manu Ginobili (Express-News):\n\n“We are missing a great guy, someone who was really enjoyable to share the locker room with, but we just have to trust Pop and R.C. that this is the best thing for the franchise. Now we have to welcome Nazr to our home. I was surprised because once Karl Malone said he was retiring, I thought that was it. I thought this was going to be the team we used to finish the season. We just have to welcome Nazr now and go for the ring. That’s still the only goal.”\n\nSpurs forward Bruce Bowen (Express-News):\n\n“It’s very difficult because you’re losing someone you’re close to. When someone goes, there’s a period of mourning. But in this business you can’t mourn too long.”\n\nBowen’s analogy of a trade:\n\n“It’s sort of like being in love with one woman for numerous years and she tells you she had to go away because of something she needs to work out. You’re hurt, but you don’t hate her. She didn’t leave because she cheated you. She just had to work some things out that you couldn’t control.”"
