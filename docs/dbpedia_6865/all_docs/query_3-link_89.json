        "text": "In the last couple of years, Horizon College & Seminary has launched numerous amazing and unique M.A. and B.A. programs. These can be completed in person or online.\n\nWe have students from BC to NS, but we are still waiting from some from NWT, Yukon, and Nunavut. These are programs like:\n\nMaster of Arts in Pastoral Counselling\n\nMaster of Arts in Ministry Leadership\n\nSisterhood Women’s Cohort\n\nHorizon Plus, unique partnership programs (some available online) like\n\nBachelor of Arts in Media Ministry\n\nBachelor of Arts in Christian Studies and Health Services\n\nBachelor of Arts in Christian Studies and BioTechnology\n\nAnd more…\n\nMaster of Arts in Pastoral Counselling\n\nThis 48 credit program can be completed in 2 to 10 years. It equips ministry leaders to serve as counsellors in a variety of ministry-based settings: local church, chaplaincy, non-profit organizations, or with their own practice.\n\nSince it aims to integrate expertise in counselling with a biblical worldview, the program has a stronger foundation of biblical and theological studies than most graduate counselling programs.\n\nThe program is designed to help students meet the academic requirements for gaining professional recognition as a member of the Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association and the Canadian Association for Spiritual Care.\n\nWatch the MA in Pastoral Counselling introduction video here.\n\nMaster of Arts in Ministry Leadership\n\nThis 48 credit program can be completed in 2 to 10 years. It prepares competent Christian leaders for church, lay ministry, and other workplace roles by combining graduate-level leadership training, biblical and theological studies, and a specialized area of studies or specialized ministry apprenticeships.\n\nSisterhood Women’s Cohort (graduate studies only)\n\nIn partnership with Sisterhood Ministries Canada, Horizon is offering an innovative educational cohort that empowers women in ministry and everyday life to bring transformational change to their churches, communities, and world.\n\nThe women’s cohort provides a unique opportunity for women to study the bible, theology, and ministry leadership in a context of mutual encouragement and support. Participants will take four graduate courses together over a two-year period. Courses can be used toward the completion of a Graduate Certificate or one of Horizon’s MA programs.\n\nWomen who enter the program with the intention of using the degree for professional or lay ministry, and who demonstrate a financial need, can apply for a bursary of $500.00 for each cohort course from Horizon College & Seminary.\n\nWatch the Sisterhood Women’s Cohort introduction video here.\n\nHorizon Plus, unique BA partnership Programs (some available online)\n\nI know of no programs like these in Canada.\n\nStudents will receive Christian formation and leadership training as well as training in a focused area such as\n\nPractical Nursing,\n\nComputer Systems Technology,\n\nContinuing Care Assistant,\n\nMental Health and Addictions Counselling,\n\nBusiness Studies,\n\nand many other options.\n\nIn these 3 and 4-year programs, students graduate with both a bachelor’s degree from Horizon and a Diploma or Certificate from either Saskatchewan Polytechnic and the Edwards School of Business of the University of Saskatchewan. Or, students might choose to combine studies at Horizon with studies from another community college across Canada.\n\nDepending on the area of focus that the students choose, they will graduate from Horizon with one of these degrees:\n\nBA or BTh in Media Ministry\n\nBA in Christian Studies and Health Services\n\nBA in Christian Studies and BioTechnology\n\nBA or BTh in Mental Health and Addictions Ministry\n\nBA in Christian Studies and Applied Technology\n\nBA in Christian Studies and Office Administration\n\nBA in Christian Studies and Support Services\n\nBA in Christian Studies and Industrial Arts\n\nBA Christian and Business Studies\n\nBA or BTh Entrepreneurial Ministry\n\nNew College Scholarships (Undergraduate Only)\n\nHorizon has several college scholarships available and have recently added 2 NEW scholarships for new full-time students:\n\nEmerging Leader Scholarship, 1600.00 Applied to account\n\nAvailable to new Horizon undergraduate students (Canadian Residents only), including transfer students, who have demonstrated leadership in any setting, such as school, church, camp, or employment.\n\nService-Based Scholarship, $1600.00 Applied to account\n\nAvailable to new Horizon undergraduate students (Canadian Residents only), including transfer students, who have served in any setting, such as school, church, camp, or employment.\n\nVisit Horizon.edu for more information.\n\nYou might also be interested in these posts:\n\n7 Ways the PAOC’s Proposed Statement of Faith Adds Pentecostal Spice\n\nThe Changing of the PAOC’s Statement of Faith … Again\n\nPentecostal(?)
