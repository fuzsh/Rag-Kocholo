        "text": "Question: Do all items ordered off of the team store ship to my house?\n\nAnswer: All website orders will ship directly to the school if your store is setup as a \"flash store.\" If your store is open year round, your items will ship directly to your house.\n\nQuestion: Can I add something to my order after the store has closed?\n\nAnswer: If you would like to add an order after your school store has been closed, please contact your athletic director or person in charge of your school's online store. In some cases we can add your extra order, but in most cases there will either be a large setup fee that covers additional shipping and handling charges for just a few pieces or we won't be able to add your extra items at all.\n\nQuestion: How long does it typically take to receive my order from the online store?\n\nAnswer: All online store orders will ship at the same time (decorated and non-decorated products) which is usually 3 weeks from the day that the store closes (not from the date that your specific order was placed). This timeframe can vary at any given time, especially during the fall and early winter seasons. **The only exception to this timeline is when your school's store is setup as a \"Year Round\" store. These stores are left open all year long and every order is processed and shipped indidivudally to your home (usually within a week or less)\n\nQuestion: What is the handling charge for?\n\nAnswer: The handling charge covers the separating and packaging of each individual order that was placed on the store. This fee simply covers the hourly rate of the employee(s) handling this process.\n\nQuestion: What forms of payment do you accept?\n\nAnswer: 323 Sports accepts Visa and Mastercard payments along with all major debit and check card transactions.\n\nQuestion: How do I know what size to get in a particular style?\n\nAnswer: Most styles offered on the 323 Sports online store will run \"true to size\" unless otherwise noted. However, you may want to contact your athletic director or person in charge of the school's online store to double check on sizing. 323 Sports is not responsible for sizing discrepancies."
