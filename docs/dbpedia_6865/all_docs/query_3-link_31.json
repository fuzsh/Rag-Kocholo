        "text": "You can supplement History and Science, along with high school Math, by using our LIFEPAC or Monarch curriculum. You could also transfer to AOPâ€™s Ignite Christian Academy.\n\nThe Horizons Math Readiness Evaluation provides tests for 1st through 6th grade, and each test takes approximately 30 to 60 minutes to complete. The 1st grade test is taken orally with special instructions for scoring and remediation of weaknesses. For 2nd through 6th grade, instructions for scoring and evaluation of test results are provided in the answer key pages.\n\nThe Horizons Pre-Algebra Readiness Evaluation and the Horizons Algebra I Readiness Evaluation help parents determine if their child is ready to begin studying upper-level math. Each of these tests takes 45-60 minutes and includes instructions for scoring and evaluation of test results.\n\nFor all Horizons Math Readiness Evaluations, your child should be able to complete the placement tests on their own, as long as they understand the directions."
