        "text": "A few times during the elementary football night, I was able to just stop and look around. It made me emotional. We have prayed for a place like this for our kids, and we can't believe we actually found it, as honestly, we thought we had too high of expectations. The kindness and care we see in all of the HCA staff is truly a gift and that they all made such an effort to support, excite and hold recess cheer sessions and allow for crazy excited kids. We all feel they are the very best teachers and staff and it is SO rewarding to be a part of this school.\n\nIn our time at HCA, my children have come alive. My son is building relationships with peers. He is in an environment that pushes him to try harder and put forth his best effort. My daughter is learning at school. I don't have to teach her what she has missed once she gets home. For the first time in her schooling career, I get to be \"just mom.\" It has been the best thing for our relationship.\n\nHCA kids are taught to be responsible, wise, take initiative, be content in your God given gifts, have compassion, cooperate with others, have hope when a situation is bad, be resilient, to persevere, to be humble, to turn away from unwise choices, to have self-control\n\nWe received Best of Forsyth in the following categories:\n\nBest School Teacher\n\nBest School Administrator\n\nBest Middle School\n\nBest Booster Club"
