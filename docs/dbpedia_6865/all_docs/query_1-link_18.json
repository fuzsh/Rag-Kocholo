        "text": "We believe that children do their best learning in an active and engaging learning environment. Our teachers utilize effective, research-based strategies through the Responsive Classroom approach as well as through Robert Marzanoâ€™s The New Art and Science of Teaching to create joyful and interactive learning experiences in the classroom. Specifically, one of the key features in the learning environment is the use of interactive structures to engage with content in active (hands-on) and interactive (social) ways.\n\nIn order to give our students the opportunity to learn about various careers that they may possibly be inspired by to pursue in the future, NHS holds a Career Day at the Middle School and a Community Worker Day at the Lower School every other year. Middle school students are asked to complete a survey to rank the careers they are most interested in learning about, and based on their feedback, the school invites professionals in the field to come and give presentations to our students. Sometimes the invited professionals have included the NHS alumni.\n\nSome featured careers on Middle School Career Day are: Actor, Attorney, Author, Chef, Community Activist, Dentist, Engineer, Filmmaker, Information Technology/Software Engineer, Music Composer, Physician, Police Officer, Screen Writer, and Veterinarian. At the Lower School, community workers featured have included the Pasadena Fire Department, Pasadena Police Department, Environmental Defenders from LA Dept. of Public Works, a pharmacist, an accountant, and a safety officer from Safe Moves."
