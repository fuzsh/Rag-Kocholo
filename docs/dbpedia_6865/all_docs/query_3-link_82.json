We must answer the call of the “Great Commission”, to go and make disciples of all men.\n\nWe Fellowship\n\nThis is the call for the people of God to come together at the “Agape Feast”. This is celebration time. It’s the opportunity that is given to the church to have fun and socialize with one another. This is where we really get to know each other.\n\nWe Care\n\nChristians and enemies alike. This is actually, “Discipleship” in action. This is the hand of the church stretched out to disciple the hardest of the hard who need love, help, and someone to speak into their lives\n\nIf we have faith, our prayers will be answered\n\nThis is Jesus’ promise to us, found in Matthew 21\n\nBecause we trust God completely in this promise, we believe fervently in the power of prayer. Whatever your circumstance, we want to pray for you.\n\nSo please complete the quick form below to send us your prayer request. Our Prayer Team, which meets every Wednesday evening, will begin praying for you as soon as they know of your desire. And if you’d like someone from our Prayer Team to contact you and pray with you, please indicate that below.\n\nGive Securely Online\n\nGive, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full—pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over, and poured into your lap. The amount you give will determine the amount you get back.\n\nLuke 6:38 – NLT\n\nDownload the Tithe.ly Giving App or click the button to give online using Tithe.ly. Your gift is safe & secure and goes directly to our church. Plus, you’ll be able to create an account to track your gifts, setup recurring giving, and more!"
