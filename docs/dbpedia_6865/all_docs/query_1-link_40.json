        "text": "The Tualatin Police Department School Resource Unit is charged with providing liaison and services to community schools. The unit is made up of three School Resource Officers (SROs) and is part of the Support Services Division. The unit is supervised by the Detective Sergeant.\n\nThe unit maintains offices at both Tualatin High School and Hazelbrook Middle School, maintaining a regular presence on those campuses. The unit also provides services to the three public elementary schools; Bridgeport, Byrom, and Tualatin, as well as Horizon Christian Schools, and M.I.T.C.H. Charter School. In addition to conducting criminal investigations and making arrests when appropriate, officers work proactively with students and staff to address issues before they become problems. They provide high visibility and routine patrol in known problem areas. SROs are often the first contact and collaborate with the Detective Unit and the Department of Human Services on investigations of abuse and neglect.\n\nThe School Resource Officers interact with and serve as positive role models for students, while working to build positive relationships with staff and students on a daily basis. The SROs often instruct and present on various topics in the elementary schools, middle schools and high school classrooms and regularly customize presentations for scout and preschool groups to enhance their learning on a particular topic.\n\nThe School Resource Unit's summer is devoted to the Tualatin Police Department Summer Program. The Tualatin Police Department Summer Program offers 6th through 9th grade students the opportunity to attend a summer camp at little or no cost. A varied life skills curriculum is commingled with activities and field trips."
