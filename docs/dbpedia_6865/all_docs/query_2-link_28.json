        "text": "Wisconsin’s Only Recovery High School - Located in Dane County\n\nHorizon High School provides students with an alcohol- and drug-free school environment. We support high school students in recovery from substance use disorders (SUD), including those who may have co-occurring mental health disorders. We also support students at increased risk of SUD, e.g., with parents or siblings with SUD. The school fosters emotional, social, and academic growth for youth who would benefit from a student-centered learning environment with a low student-to-teacher & counselor ratio of 5:1.\n\nHorizon provides an emotionally supportive and academically stimulating environment, enabling youth to succeed and get control of their use and mental health. Our student population varies and is usually between 10-18 students. To maintain an engaging and educational atmosphere, Horizon High School incorporates guest speakers, life skills education, physical education, volunteering and field trips. Outings are planned on a weekly basis to engage students in the greater Madison community.\n\nStudents are encouraged to participate in a variety of activities, both at school and after school, in order to help them maintain their recovery and to grow into well-rounded community members. Since Horizon's creation, over 200 young people have attended. Today many of these former students are enrolled in colleges and universities, in the military, or working as contributing members of our community.\n\n“Horizon High is probably the best school I have ever been too. The staff is extremely welcoming and friendly. You start to feel familiar with the environment after only a few days. One hour each day is dedicated to group, and I feel this really helps the students get to know each other, share their issues, get help and get passed any shyness. Horizon High means a great place to learn and talk about what you need to get by in life”."
