        "text": "My son Nathan transferred out of public school, and we enrolled him at Horizon Christian Academy for his senior year. It truly was the best decision. From the second we met the administration and faculty this school has been amazing. They have embraced my son and us as a family and we couldn't be happier.\n\nAcademically they offer everything that he needs to be ready for college. The teachers are attentive and helpful as well as patient and understanding. The faculty couldn't be more helpful. Horizon also offers, all the sports and extracurricular activities that the public schools offer. I don't feel like my son has lost anything by going to a smaller school in fact he has gained so much: confidence, a better understanding of his faith and more one on one help if he needs it. He's no longer a small fish in a big pond. My son has felt like he has been a huge part of the school. He even was team captain and MVP of the Varsity Football team. We give Horizon Chrisitan Academy 5 Stars!!!"
