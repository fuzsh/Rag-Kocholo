        "text": "On a sticky, humid, late-July morning, young children are playing outside the old Horizon Christian Academy gymnasium. Some hoist basketballs at lowered baskets. Others fling a tethered ball around a pole. Some stand against a wall, dodging balls aimed by playmates.\n\nInside the gymnasium, more than 500 chairs have been arranged for Horizon Christian Fellowship’s 10 a.m. Sunday church service.\n\nAs for that gymnasium, where four boys state basketball championship banners hang, where Jared Dudley and Jeff Withey honed their skills before launching NBA careers, there will be no more high school games.\n\nHorizon Christian Academy has closed its doors. The school was purchased by High Tech High three years ago, and now High Tech will occupy the campus.\n\n“For me, that school was home,” said Vickie Carrington, who taught at Horizon, coached girls basketball for 16 years, served as athletic director the past four years, and sent three children through the campus. “I absolutely loved it.\n\n“In my heart of hearts, I truly believed we were going to find a new location. When that didn’t take place, oh my, all I can tell you is I was pretty much numb, discouraged, hurt, sad.”\n\n“Upon finding out it actually closed,” said former Horizon football coach Anthony Johnson, “it was devastating.”\n\nHorizon Christian Academy was a private kindergarten-through-12th-grade school in the middle of Clairemont, not far from bustling Balboa Avenue. While Horizon was a small school (averaging a high school enrollment of about 300), its athletic tradition was rich, particularly in boys basketball.\n\nFrom 1995 through 2008, the Panthers won 13 section boys basketball titles in 14 years. Dudley, a 10-year NBA veteran, including last season with the Phoenix Suns, helped the program earn state titles in 2002 and ’03.\n\nWithey, who has played four seasons in the NBA, the past two with Utah, starred on the 2006 state title team. The Panthers won their fourth state championship in 2013.\n\nDudley remembers showing up on his first day of practice and having to run 20 laps on the track.\n\n“I took the bus back home to Solana Beach, and wow, I was sore,” Dudley said. “That’s how serious this school was. Coach (Zack) Jones, he was intimidating, but he wanted the best for every player. I thought, ‘This is what you’re waiting for. Somebody to push you to your limit.’\n\n“I give Coach Jones a lot of credit. He built that program to (at the time) by far the best basketball school in San Diego.”\n\nHorizon won girls section basketball titles in 1997, ’98, 2011, ’13 and ’15.\n\nIn its final football season, Horizon won the San Diego Section Division V championship last November. Johnson served as head coach of the team. He played on Horizon’s previous section championship team in 2000.\n\n“I’m happy we went out on top,” Johnson said.\n\nWhile Horizon strung together numerous section titles, people affiliated with the school say what they’ll remember most is the camaraderie among students, instructors and staff.\n\nWhen former Horizon football/basketball standout and New Mexico safety Markel Byrd was killed in a one-car accident in December 2015, more than 100 people attended a campus prayer vigil.\n\nWhen the Atlanta Falcons advanced to Super Bowl LI last February in Houston, then-senior Ava Bobolia suggested the school raise money so that boys basketball coach and dean of students Tyrone Hopkins could fly to Houston. Hopkins grew up in Atlanta and is a big Falcons fan.\n\nA GoFundMe account raised more than $2,400 for Hopkins.\n\nAsked what he’ll remember about Horizon, Lamont Butler, the school’s head football coach from 2013-15, said: “Just the people. And the impact you’re able to have on young men and women.”\n\nDudley lives in Fairbanks Ranch in the offseason. He said he regularly stays in touch with seven of his closest friends who date back to Horizon. One, a former Spanish teacher, often babysits Dudley’s three children.\n\n“Socially,” Dudley said, “that school was it for me.”\n\nCarrington said former Horizon students still attending high school will be spread throughout the county, from Maranatha Christian in 4S Ranch to Christian High in El Cajon to Santa Fe Christian in Solana Beach.\n\nJohnson said ex-Horizon football players will be enrolled at St. Augustine, San Diego High and Mira Mesa.\n\nAdded Carrington: “So many others called Horizon home, too. It was a great Christian school. What I loved about it is that it was very affordable and the population here was so diverse. We had students who were homeless who attended for free.”\n\nHORIZON HIGHLIGHTS\n\nChampionships won by the Panthers during their stay at the school’s campus in Clairemont that began in 1985:\n\n4 — State titles in boys basketball\n\n15 — San Diego Section titles in boys basketball\n\n5 — Section titles in girls basketball\n\n3 — Section titles in football\n\n3 — Section titles in softball\n\n2 — Section titles in girls soccer\n\nNorcross is a freelance writer."
