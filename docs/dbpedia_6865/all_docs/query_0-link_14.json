        "text": "Welcome to the Horizon Christian Learning Center!\n\nWe are a preschool/daycare with extended elementary care serving the southwest suburbs of Portland, Oregon. The Learning Center is licensed by the Child Care Division of the State of Oregon.\n\nOur Mission: It is our desire to provide a happy, safe, and fun learning environment for kids when Mom and Dad are working. Our mission is to partner with parents and provide a safe, nurturing, stimulating program that introduces our students to God's love and gives them a strong academic foundation for success in school.\n\nWe Believe In Learning: The most formative time in a childâ€™s life is from birth to five years of age. In all of our preschool programs and elementary programs we offer a positive, nurturing environment with age-appropriate learning activities that focus on gross and fine motor skills, socialization, language skills, literacy, phonics, music, Bible stories and much more.\n\nWe Believe In Play: We believe that children learn through play. We understand that through play, the five senses, and hands-on activities, children can discover new things about themselves and the world around them every day.\n\nWe Believe in Parent Involvement: We hold teacher/parent conferences twice a year and provide a progress report each trimester. Parent/family volunteers are welcomed. It is important for our students to feel like we are an extension of their family so hugs, smiles and play comes naturally from our professional staff.\n\nHere at the Learning Center we strive to help children:"
