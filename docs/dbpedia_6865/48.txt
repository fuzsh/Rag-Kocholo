Welcome to Horizons Christian Academy

Horizons Christian Academy is a childcare center in Chester, South Carolina offering exceptional care for children 8 weeks old up to 12 years of age. Our childcare programs build a solid foundation for children to grow, expand their curiosity and their knowledge while experiencing developmentally appropriate activities and learning experiences.

Our mission...

At Horizons Christian Academy our mission is to provide a safe atmosphere that promotes the development of spiritual, social, educational, and physical growth.

Children do not learn the same way as adults. We believe that young children learn primarily through play and interactive experiences. They need opportunities to explore the world around them.

Clear communication is one of the keys to a successful childcare experience.

Programs

Horizons Christian Academy believe that children learn best through experience and play. We embrace this philosophy in our center by helping children explore and discover their interest through hands on experiences and play.

At Horizons, we developed our programs and curriculum to ensure that each level of instruction is socially, emotionally and academically appropriate.

We address the specific needs of each child based not only on age, but also individual pace of development for that child. Our curriculum is designed to ensure that all children have what they need to not only reach significant milestones, but to also master them. Horizons implements differentiated instruction and developmentally appropriate practices, while understanding that children learn and grow at various paces.

Our goal is to provide a high quality, nurturing, and safe learning environment for each child and their family.
