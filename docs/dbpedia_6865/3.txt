Horizon Christian Schools exist to Bring LIFE to Learning by providing a formal education that prepares students to pursue their God-given purpose.

We accomplish this by:

Hearts Ignited. We intentionally lead with Heart, purposing to know, love and serve each student and encourage them to follow Jesus with their whole heart.

Minds Equipped. We provide quality instruction in the core subjects and also value the Arts, Athletics, Spiritual Formation and Service as essential to a comprehensive education.

Hands Engaged. We heed Jesusâ€™ call to each person to live beyond self; to live in service to others; to accomplish a specific work and ultimately to build the Kingdom of God.
