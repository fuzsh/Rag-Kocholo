        "text": "A weekly newsletter on campaigning, lobbying and political influence in the EU.\n\nBy LILI BAYER\n\nWith thanks to Zia Weise, Mari Eccles, Ashleigh Furlong and Louise Guillot\n\nTips, tales, traumas to the POLITICO Brussels Team at @liliebayer or [email protected] | View in your browser\n\nGood Friday afternoon and welcome back to EU Influence.\n\nEU TRANSPARENCY\n\nSTATUTE GETS THUMBS-UP: The European Parliament has signed off on a revised statute for the European Ombudsman, with 602 MEPs voting in favor, nine against and 81 abstaining. “A strong, well-resourced and independent Ombudsman is essential for maintaining high ethics and accountability standards in the EU administration,” Ombudsman Emily O’Reilly said in a statement. “I thank all those involved for their work on this new legislation and welcome the agreement across party lines and across EU institutions.”\n\nCooling-off period: “I see the new statute as a validation of our Office’s work over recent years in handling complaints, conducting proactive inquiries and keeping the EU institutions at the forefront of excellent public administration,” she said, adding that “the new two year cooling-off period for any politicians who want to become Ombudsman in future is important to ensure that the Office maintains its independence.”\n\nBIG PHIL IS BACK: Former Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan got the green light from the Berlaymont on Tuesday for his new consultancy — and already has clients lined up. Hogan, Strategic Advisory Services has agreements with Vodafone and Proof of Trust, a patented contract validation and issue resolution technology firm where former British Commissioner Jonathan Hill is already serving as an executive adviser.\n\nNew pastures: Hogan resigned in August following a political scandal that revolved around his attendance at a golfing society dinner that flouted Ireland’s coronavirus restrictions. In its decision, the Commission noted that Hogan notified it at the beginning of February of his intent to establish an advisory company. The firm’s aims include offering “high-level external advice on a routine basis to management” and “advice regarding the implementation of programmes and campaigns in Europe.”\n\nRestrictions: Hogan “should not lobby the Commission, its Members or staff, or any of its Executive Agencies on behalf of ‘Hogan, Strategic Advisory Services’ or its clients until 26 August 2022,” the Commission said in its decision, noting that the former politician “shall not accept mandates from clients, or provide advice to clients, in relation to areas for which he was responsible, namely agriculture and rural development and international trade.” The Independent Ethical Committee also issued specific opinions on Vodafone and Proof of Trust.\n\nNGO reaction: “Overall, I think the decision is quite good, it’s quite strong,” said Vitor Teixeira, Transparency International EU’s political integrity coordinator. “Having said that, in my mind, there are still a few questions and a few doubts,” Teixeira told EU Influence. “How can they know, number one, that he did not give any advice on lobbying — he’s forbidden to do so — but how do they know that will be the case?” he said, adding that “there’s no follow-up monitoring.”\n\n**EVENT ANNOUNCEMENT: As part of POLITICO Drive Sustainable Progress series, POLITICO Live “Farming in a climate neutral Europe” will take place on July 5 to explore the pathway to green Europe’s agricultural system. Register today!**\n\nLOBBYING THE EU\n\nIP DEBATE INTENSIFIES: The EU’s proposed alternative to an intellectual property rights waiver for coronavirus-related products has met with opposition from both industry and NGOs. The Brussels plan centers on limiting export restrictions, supporting the expansion of production and facilitating existing compulsory licensing provisions in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).\n\nCivil society concerns: “The EU’s continued insistence on the use of compulsory licensing in its counter-proposal as an excuse for opposing the original ‘TRIPS waiver’ is disingenuous and endangers public health globally,” Dimitri Eynikel, EU policy adviser for Doctors Without Borders’ Access Campaign. “By focusing just on compulsory licensing, the EU is promoting a safeguard that can only bypass patents but not all IP barriers, thereby making it less effective than the proposed waiver. In this raging pandemic, countries need to have all options at their disposal to encourage the manufacturing of COVID-19 medical tools across the world,” he said.\n\nIndustry view: Nathalie Moll, director general of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries, said that “while welcoming the commitment to limit export restrictions and facilitate trade, as well as encourage the expansion of vaccine and treatment production in collaboration with industry, we are deeply concerned about the threat of compulsory licensing as a vehicle to increase access to COVID-19 vaccines.” EFPIA’s chief also added that “compulsory licensing will not facilitate greater vaccine equity but could put the hard-won progress in fighting this terrible disease in jeopardy.”\n\nNEW CONSULTANT I: Jan Peter Balkenende used to come to Brussels for European Council summits. Now, the former Dutch politician — who served as prime minister between 2002 and 2010 — plans on engaging with EU institutions on behalf of corporate clients. Balkenende recently joined Hague Corporate Affairs, a firm whose clients — according to the EU Transparency Register — include the European Alliance for Plant-based Food and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries. “My task, of course, is to give strategic advice to our clients,” Balkenende told EU Influence.\n\nFuture challenges: “I’m really interested in the future of Europe,” the former prime minister said, adding that “it’s a matter of having the right cooperation between the public sector and the private sector.” Balkenende’s work for Hague Corporate Affairs will focus on Brussels policymaking, and he said that his interests include issues such as the European Green Deal, energy transition and the Farm to Fork strategy.\n\nCommission in focus: Asked which institutions he anticipates interacting with most, Balkenende highlighted the Berlaymont, noting that the European Commission is “doing a very important job.” The former politician said Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans “was a member of my last cabinet so we know each other very well, so that maybe that helps.” But the former prime minister also said he is looking forward to working with other institutions, such as the European Parliament.\n\nTransparency: Balkenende currently wears multiple hats. Besides his role at Hague Corporate Affairs, he is also an external senior adviser at Ernst & Young and serves as chairman of the Dutch Sustainable Growth Coalition, a partnership of eight multinationals — while working as a professor at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam. Asked about the debate over former politicians going into the private sector, he said that there are “two key words: integrity and transparency.” He added: “I know that if you want to have a meeting with European Commission, the question is, ‘are you on the list?’ … and that’s good.”\n\nNEW CONSULTANT II: Dara Murphy, a former Irish minister who also served as the European People’s Party 2019 election campaign chief, has joined Rasmussen Global as a senior adviser. According to the Transparency Register, the firm’s clients have included American communications company Viasat, the mission of Taiwan to the EU and the Albanian foreign ministry.\n\nTransatlantic relations in focus: Rasmussen Global has “a very strong focus on transatlantic business,” Murphy told EU Influence. “The relationship between the United States and Europe seems to be strengthening in a number of areas: climate policy, tax policy,” he added. “Even today, you see Joe Biden talking about improving the regulatory framework around data transfers across the Atlantic.”\n\nCouncil, Commission, consultancy: The ex-politician brings a diverse set of experiences, having served as Ireland’s minister of state for European affairs, EU digital single market and data protection. He resigned from the Irish parliament in December 2019 amid scrutiny of his attendance record and consultancy profits — he says no rules were broken — and later worked on the Horizon Europe research program and Green Deal as a cabinet expert for Commissioner Mariya Gabriel. Murphy also runs his own consultancy, Epecon. “With Dara we have someone who knows how to navigate and shape Europe’s digital and climate policies,” Rasmussen Global CEO Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in a statement.\n\nRevolving doors debate: Asked about ongoing discussions regarding public officials moving into the private sector, Murphy said that in a “democratic society” it is important to remember that “people who’ve been elected are not guaranteed jobs for life.” He also emphasized that “businesses employ people and families and help underpin and sustain the economic strength of this continent that we’re living in.” Murphy said that he believes “the rules are robust,” adding that in Europe there is “a very clear delineation” regarding “what’s acceptable and what’s not acceptable.”\n\nINFLUENCERS\n\nLuc Bas is leaving the European regional office of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, where he served as director, to join the European Environmental Agency as head of coordination and strategy.\n\nWinston Beck has left Kreab to join HeidelbergCement as the company’s representative in Brussels.\n\nSESAR Joint Undertaking’s Executive Director Florian Guillermet will step down in July to take up a new position as CEO of DSNA, France’s air navigation services provider.\n\nLaura Kaun is now policy and campaigns officer at the European Women’s Lobby.\n\nTia Loukkola has just been named deputy secretary-general of the European University Association.\n\nVictoria Main (Cambre Associates) has been elected to the board of directors of the American Chamber of Commerce to the EU.
