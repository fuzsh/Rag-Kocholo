        "text": "Commitment, But How Much? Dutch Support for the 2003 War\n\nUnlike Denmark’s swift and decisive choice to join the US-led war coalition in Iraq, it took the Netherlands several months and subsequent iterations to clarify the substance of its support. The decisions came incrementally, unfolding between November 2002 and June 2003, in the midst of Dutch parliamentary elections that took place in January 2003. The country initially committed to providing “political, but not military” support to the war. Within months, however, Dutch decision makers began providing logistical support to the military effort in Iraq by allowing American military equipment to transit the Netherlands, sending military equipment to Iraq to strengthen the US-led coalition forces, and ultimately deploying troops to the Iraqi province of Al Muthanna to assist the stabilization effort.380\n\nThree minimum-winning coalition arrangements were involved in the process to determine Dutch involvement in the war throughout this period: an elected government that came to power in July 2002 comprising the CDA, VVD, and the LPF (but taking on a caretaker role by OctoberPage 132 → 2002; see table 5.1); a coalition-in-the-making forged between the re-elected incumbent CDA and the PvdA immediately following the January 2003 elections; and a third coalition that was successfully formed between the CDA, VVD, and D66 by May 2003 following the eventual breakdown of the previous round of negotiations between the CDA and PvdA.\n\nThe process leading up to the initial decision to provide political support for the war in Iraq began as early as August 2002, a few weeks after the CDA-VVD-LPF minimum-winning coalition was formed under the premiership of Jan Peter Balkenende of the Christian Democrats.381 The United States soon reached out to the Netherlands to seek its support for the Iraq operation. Washington’s official invitation to the Netherlands to join the war coalition came in November 2002,382 but the invitation arrived after the tripartite coalition had collapsed in October 2002 due to an infighting that broke within the LPF’s ranks. The LPF had been going through a leadership crisis since Fortuyn’s death in May 2002, and by October 2002 the party’s internal crisis had finally found “its way into the cabinet,” to the point where two cabinet ministers from the LPF stopped communicating with each other. Although the two ministers resigned on October 16 to salvage the government, the LPF’s senior coalition partners, VVD and CDA, declared that they had lost trust and confidence in their junior partner. The two parties therefore decided to break down the coalition and called for early elections.383 Balkenende remained at the helm of the now-caretaker government.384\n\nParliamentary elections were renewed in January 2003. The Christian Democrats (CDA) came out victorious once again, although falling short of securing a parliamentary majority given the fragmented nature of the Dutch political system: it won 44 out of 150 seats in the Tweede Kamer. The Labor Party (PvdA) came in second, capturing 42 seats. Seeking to bridge a wide political gap across the spectrum, the two major parties began coalition negotiations. In the meantime, Balkenende announced his outgoing caretaker government’s decision on Iraq. The prime minister declared in March 2003 that “the absence of a further [UN Security Council] resolution has consequences for the national support (draagvlak) for further Dutch involvement. Consequently, the Netherlands will not give an active military contribution with respect to Iraq” but would support the Page 133 →war politically.385 The parliament voted for this resolution on March 18.386 Meanwhile, coalition talks continued between CDA and PvdA until April 2003, but ultimately failed to produce the next government.387 During that time, the Netherlands had already begun intensifying its support for the war: in April 2003, the country provided military equipment to supplement the war coalition’s efforts in Iraq, followed by the deployment of a submarine and a frigate. These contributions took place even though the CDA’s prospective coalition partner, the social democratic PvdA, was explicitly opposed to Dutch commitment in the war.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the CDA-PvdA talks due to differences in the parties’ approach to economic policy, the CDA began pursuing its old governing partner, the VVD, which had won 28 seats in the January 2003 elections. In need of a third coalition partner to secure a parliamentary majority, the CDA turned to a distant competitor on the political spectrum, D66, and sought to add its six parliamentary seats to the new government. The negotiations among the three parties began in April 2003 and were finalized in May, producing a new tripartite minimum-winning coalition by the end of that month.388 Less than two weeks later, on June 6, the new Balkenende government decided to go beyond supporting the war politically. It agreed to contribute militarily by declaring its decision to deploy 1,100 Dutch troops to strengthen the SFIR—the war coalition’s peacekeeping force—in the Iraqi province of Al Muthanna by August 2003.389\n\nIn sum, the Netherlands took incremental steps toward contributing to the US-led war in Iraq. Most importantly, the nature of the country’s commitments intensified—from political support to military support—even though the parties that were involved in these actual and prospective coalitions grew further apart from each other along the political spectrum. Clearly, this episode defeats the veto players logic. But what explains it?\n\nLet us start by looking at the initial decision to “politically support” the war. After losing its electoral mandate in October 2002, the CDA-VVD-LPF caretaker government was in a precarious position. But did the government’s precarious position constitute a challenge to its intentions to join the war? Was this decision a deliberate choice or was it forced on the government given the circumstances? In other words, was Page 134 →the decision to politically support the war merely a result of the government’s caretaker status?390\n\nSeveral accounts reflect on this question. On the one hand, an Economist Intelligence Unit report released as early as December 2002 points out that the country “seem[ed] prepared to provide military hardware to support the US in the region,”391 implying that some form of military participation could well be possible despite the government’s caretaker status. Clearly, some international observers considered the coalition politically capable of committing the Netherlands to the Iraq campaign not just on paper but also by sending military assistance. Others disagree, on the other hand, emphasizing the government’s precarity. De Wijk, for instance, agrees with The Economist’s rapporteurs that government intended at the outset to officially join the war coalition like Denmark, but that its caretaker status likely prevented it from following through: “during the [Iraq] crisis the country was run by the outgoing Cabinet which lacked the power to make firm policy decisions. As a result, the government was unwilling, probably politically incapable to co-sign the letter of the ‘gang of eight,’” De Wijk argues.392 Everts takes a less definitive position. He notes that the prime minister’s statements in 2002 were clearly signaling Dutch support for the war, but the form of this support was left open to speculation: Balkenende “announced that the Netherlands would ‘support the US’ if it came to a war,” but he “did not in this context mention military support Page 135 →specifically.”393 It seems that there was no consensus among analysts over whether “political support” was a consequence of the coalition’s caretaker status.\n\nFor some observers, the more pressing constraint on the Dutch decision makers was the country’s historically delicate position between the United States and the European Union. Balkenende was aware of the balancing act he had to perform vis-à-vis his European partners; he was cautious not to antagonize the antiwar bloc in the EU, specifically France, Germany, and Belgium.394 According to a March 2003 report of the Economist Intelligence Unit, this was the reason why Balkenende was reluctant to fold the Netherlands into the core of the war coalition by signing the “letter of eight.”395\n\nThe strongest case against both “caretaker-ism” and “European-ism,” however, came just prior the January 2003 elections from the caretaker government’s own ranks. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was also held by the CDA, took a decidedly396 Atlanticist position, articulating that “war was unavoidable and that, if and when it came, the Netherlands should side with the American politically as well as militarily.”397 This was perhaps the clearest indication that neither the government’s caretaker position nor its relations vis-à-vis its European partners were tying its hands.\n\nOthers might argue that the government was not constrained internally by way of its caretaker status or due to its relations with the EU, but externally through its commitment to international law. After all, Balkenende’s statement in March 2003, where he announced his government’s political support for the war, had underscored the lack of a UN mandate. The answer to this question came several years later. In 2009, Balkenende requested an independent investigation to clarify and account for the government’s decision-making process leading up to the war.398 A “Commission of Inquiry into the Decision-Making on Iraq,” also known as the “Davids Commission,” was formed in response, and its final report Page 136 →was published in 2010.399 One area of emphasis in the report concerned the extent to which the debate over the necessity of a UN mandate for the war influenced the government’s decision.\n\nThe Davids report concluded that “from the outset, the [Dutch] administration took the view that a new Security Council mandate for the use of force was politically desirable, but not legally indispensable. The basis for this stance was the so-called ‘corpus theory’: the belief that, taken as a body, the various Security Council resolutions on Iraq passed since 1990 constituted a mandate for the use of force, which was still valid in March 2003.”400 In other words, the lack of a UN mandate specifically targeting the 2003 operation was not an impediment for Dutch decision makers: they could have invested in the war militarily even in the absence of it. In this sense, the caretaker government’s “political support” decision seems to be one of choice, not of necessity based on international law.\n\nIn sum, existing accounts suggest that the initial decision to support the Iraq war “politically, but not militarily” was a deliberate choice. As far as the normative dimension—the “Principles”—is concerned, the absence of an exclusive UN mandate was not a major obstacle preventing the government from joining the war coalition, although it would certainly have further legitimized a potential decision to contribute militarily. The Netherlands’ ties to both the United States and the European Union could have had some constraining effect on the form of support that the country initially provided. “Political” support signaled the country’s commitment to the United States without risking its relations with the European partners. Still, it seems this was hardly the key reason behind the government’s decision, especially considering the intensification of commitments in the subsequent months. For this same reason, we can conclude that the government’s caretaker status was not a major source of constraint either.\n\nThis brings us to the crux of the Dutch case. To understand why the caretaker government led by the CDA chose to commit only politically in March 2003, one has to look closer at the broader domestic political context. Specifically, we must situate this decision—as well as the subsequent decisions to send military equipment to Iraq and the ultimate troop deployment—in the process of government formation that had been simultaneously taking place first between the Christian Democrats and Labor, and then between the Christian Democrats, the VVD, and the D66. Why Page 137 →did the initial decision preclude military support? How was it possible for the Netherlands to make more assertive commitments toward the Iraq campaign over time, even though the parties’ ideological differences were growing?\n\nIdeological Composition: As table 5.1 above summarizes, the three coalition arrangements across the volatile 2002–2003 period were remarkably different from each other in terms of their ideological composition. In fact, the CDA-VVD-LPF coalition was the most compact of the three, given the individual locations of the political parties on the left-right spectrum and how far each party was situated from the overall mean ideological position of the coalition. For the other two coalition arrangements, there was greater dispersion given the parties’ ideological placements. These differences had to be reconciled in order for these arrangements to work out. Therefore, the ways the parties chose to reconcile these differences should have had a profound effect on decision making, including the decisions regarding Dutch involvement in the Iraq war.\n\nFirst, consider the positions of the parties participating in the short-lived Balkenende government, namely the CDA, VVD and LPF, which came to power in July 2002. All these parties are situated on the right side of the political spectrum, and because they enjoyed parliamentary majority at the time, they had no reason to compromise to garner the parliamentary opposition’s support (or fragment it) in the run-up to the war even though they were in caretaker status. Further, these governing partners all had strong Atlanticist positions regarding Dutch foreign policy, which would reliably signal that they were willing to commit the Netherlands militarily. For instance, LPF had argued later in March 2003 that the “political support” decision was a disappointment. The party’s leader reportedly said that “Holland would leave its most important ally, the United States, isolated by refusing military support.”401 The VVD has always been a proponent of Atlanticism in Dutch foreign policy, and along with the LPF, they had “wanted nothing less than full military support for war.”402 The CDA took a more risk-averse approach. The party “suggested that the Netherlands should seek to replace US forces elsewhere,”403 which still indicated their interest in committing militarily, but also seeking to minimize potential losses by stationing the troops away from the conflict’s ground zero.\n\nThe opposition parties disagreed with these preferences. Labor had a Page 138 →position of “total rejection of a war in Iraq,” including any form of Dutch support for it, military and political. The Greens argued that the country was betraying its “principles” and “contributing to the violation of international law by giving its political support to the US.”404\n\nIn sum, all the parties in the CDA-VVD-LPF minimum-winning coalition government at the time were supportive of participating in the war at some military capacity, while the opposition parties were against it, but the Netherlands ended up declaring its “political, but not military support” for the war. Why was that?\n\nLogrolling: It was the prospect of participating in a new government, which was being negotiated between the CDA and the Labor Party by March 2003, that compelled the existing CDA-led coalition to commit less decisively than it had originally intended. One CDA leader reacted to the PvdA’s hard opposition against the Iraq campaign as “sad.”405 The Christian Democrats left it at that, though. Their anticipation of having the Labor Party in the incoming government was an important reason why they did not antagonize it further. Instead, they ended up diluting the outgoing government’s original preference for providing military support. Some existing accounts emphasize just that. According to Everts, “Mr. Balkenende could have insisted and persisted in his real conviction that Netherlands’ clear interest was to fully join the ‘coalition of the willing.’ The fact that he did not should (also) be seen in the light of his wish to keep the door open to the PvdA as a new coalition partner.”406 In a similar vein, Verbeek notes that Dutch policymaking over Iraq was “constrained by the coalition talks between Christian-Democrats and Social Democrats (PvdA),” where “the latter party had a strong international law abiding policy resisting any war without authorization by a new Security Council resolution.”407 For the CDA-led government, then, it was less about Dutch compliance with the international law per se than about accommodating the PvdA’s strong preference for a UN mandate that led to the “political support” decision.\n\nSo far, this outcome echoes the “compromise” solution as predicted by the veto players logic. Although the outgoing tripartite coalition had the capacity to commit militarily, the CDA’s difficult position between the outgoing and the incoming coalitions forced it to compromise to keep the Page 139 →PvdA somewhat content with regards to Iraq.408 The “political support” decision was not assertive enough to disrupt the talks with the PvdA, but was still good enough to appease the VVD and the LPF on the one hand409 and maintain stable relations with the United States on the other. It was a middle-of-the-road foreign policy as Elman calls it. This also corroborates the argument that Kaarbo raises in her analysis of the decision.410\n\nWhat took place after the declaration of political support on March 18, however, illustrates where the veto player explanation falls apart. It brings us to logrolling, specifically, in this case, clipping together policies with office perks. This mechanism explains how Dutch commitments intensified first during the CDA-PvdA talks and then on the eve of the new CDA-VVD-D66 coalition, even though the parties involved in both of these arrangements were ideologically further away from each other, and had more divergent positions on the Iraq war, than the outgoing CDA-VVD-LPF coalition.\n\nLet us take a closer look at the CDA-PvdA negotiations to see how the more intense war commitments were possible under these circumstances. The talks between the two parties began on February 5, 2003.411 By March, the PvdA leader argued that “given the absence of a UN mandate, the PvdA would not support the war.”412 An Economist Intelligence Unit report from the same month argues that in the process of negotiations “the parties [CDA and PvdA] have clashed several times over the Iraq issue, which could prove a breaking point in the event of a US-led war against Iraq without UN authorisation.”413 Recall that Balkenende’s March 2003 statement echoed exactly this position: that in the absence of a UN mandate it was difficult to sustain draagvlak, and therefore, the Netherlands would only support the war effort politically.\n\nThe Dutch government, however, soon began taking steps to defy this position. First, it authorized the deployment of military equipment to Turkey. Specifically, the country sent Patriot missiles to Turkey in February 2003 to defend the NATO ally against any escalation in Iraq.414 To respond to criticisms framing the deployment as active military participation in Page 140 →the war, “the government labeled these weapons ‘defensive.’”415 The PvdA agreed on the missile deployment once the French, Belgian, and German governments also “dropped their objections” in response to Turkey’s official request.416 Some observers concluded that this was not a big issue and that the two political parties simply “agreed to disagree.”417 The PvdA’s change of heart over the deployment of Patriot equipment, however, was particularly perplexing. The party’s leader, Wouter Bos, had said in March 2003, “There should be no Dutch political or military support for the war. No people, no equipment.”418\n\nDespite the PvdA’s “no equipment” position, the CDA-led caretaker government continued to intensify its commitments and “provided military hardware to support the US in the Gulf region”419 after March 2003. This material contribution to the war took place as the CDA was still negotiating with the PvdA. By this time the PvdA had “accepted the war (as a fact of life) but rejected any military participation of the Netherlands.”420 But when the government sent “a submarine and frigate to the Middle East under US military command,” thus now explicitly making resource commitments to the war, “Labor balked, arguing that this action violated the agreement because it went beyond political support.”421 The accounts suggest, however, that the PvdA neither rejected any of these moves nor left the negotiation table in protest. To the contrary, Labor and its leader, Wouter Bos, came around within a week. In a dramatic turn of events, he and Balkenende “agreed that the Netherlands was part of the US-led coalition and that the US intervention was justified under UN resolution 1441.”422\n\nRecall that the decision to provide political, but not military support was taken in March 2003 specifically in anticipation of a possible PvdA partnership in the new government. Within weeks, the CDA-led caretaker government revised its initial position, openly providing far more explicit support for the Iraq war. Meanwhile, the senior partner of this coalition had been negotiating with a prospective governing partner (namely, the PvdA) who was strictly opposed to any form of support for this war. What Page 141 →explains this increase in commitment intensity in the face of such high levels of policy incongruence between the CDA and the PvdA?\n\nThe answer had to do with the prospect of assuming executive office. Labor was eying a seat at the government and was willing to logroll with the Christian Democrats for it. Van der Meulen and Soeters suggest that the interaction of the PvdA with the CDA despite their deep disagreements over the war “did leave open their [PvdA’s] chances of participating in a new center-left government.”423 PvdA continued the negotiations despite the intensification of commitments in Iraq because it did not want to forgo the opportunity to join the new governing coalition. The party did not quit the negotiations, for instance, even though it was opposed to the deployment of the Patriot missiles in Turkey.424 In fact, the party “dodged the issue” when the CDA almost jokingly criticized it for being “ambiguous” on Iraq a week before the coalition talks formally began.425 Clearly, the real reason behind PvdA’s acquiescence had to do with participating in the new governing coalition. Everts notes that “the PvdA, which was keen on becoming a governing party (again), did not want to encumber [coalition] negotiations by making too much trouble over the dispatch of Patriot missiles to Turkey.”426 Perhaps most dramatically, it was revealed months later that the PvdA had even agreed during the negotiations to send Dutch marines to Iraq after the war.427 In short, rather than imposing the status quo (as proponents of the veto players logic would expect), or trying to pull the CDA toward its own preference point (as proponents of the hijacking logic would expect), Labor conceded to the CDA’s efforts to more assertively commit the Netherlands to the Iraq war in return for a seat in the government.\n\nThe coalition talks between the two parties ultimately collapsed in April 2003 due to disagreements over government spending.428 Logrolling continues to explain the intensification of Dutch commitments in Iraq after this date, however, as the CDA began negotiating with the VVD and the D66 to form the new government.\n\nWe know that the centrist VVD had governed alongside the CDA in the caretaker government, and its historically Atlanticist approach to foreign policy was already congruent with the CDA’s position on Iraq. A Page 142 →majority coalition between the two would thus have been the best option for these parties to pursue their assertive foreign policy preferences in Iraq. This was impossible, however, given their combined seat share in the parliament following the January 2003 elections. They needed a third partner. The center-left D66 was a viable candidate, but it stood further away from the CDA and the VVD. The D66 was originally opposed to Dutch involvement in Iraq. During the final parliamentary debate on Iraq on March 18, 2003, the leader of the party, Boris Dittrich, stated, “This is not our war. We think that the government should give neither political nor military support.”429 Despite their disapproval, the D66 formed a minimum-winning coalition with the CDA and VVD in May 2003. In June, this government agreed to deploy Dutch troops to Iraq.\n\nWhat explains the D66’s shift from an all-out opposition to Dutch involvement in Iraq to agreeing to station troops there? Just like the PvdA, the D66’s desire to be a part of the governing coalition trumped all else. Kaarbo’s interview with Jan Hoekema, a member of the D66, is telling. Hoekema explained that the party “had strongly opposed the war but agreed to concede the issue in exchange for a role in the government.”430 Even though the D66 was a pivotal junior party in this minimum-winning coalition with blackmail potential, it chose to forgo its veto power and did not try to pull the government toward its own preference point (that is, no further involvement in Iraq). In August 2003, 1,100 Dutch peacekeepers were sent to southern Iraq to replace the US marines in the region with the consent of this new tripartite minimum-winning coalition.431 Clearly for the D66, the party’s involvement in the government was far more important than the country’s involvement in the war. Although this coalition was far more ideologically dispersed than its predecessor from 2002, it was able to commit far more assertively because the junior partner chose to logroll with it.\n\nIn conclusion, the deep ideological divisions between the Dutch political parties and the corresponding disagreements on the Iraq war were mitigated by the pivotal junior partners’ greater desire to participate in the government. Aspiring to join the new governing coalition, both the PvdA and the D66 dropped their determined opposition against Dutch involvement in Iraq and conceded to the initiatives taken by the outgoing government, particularly the CDA. As a result, these ideologically dispersed minimum-winning coalitions were able to commit more assertively than expected.\n\nPage 143 →Public Opinion: To what extent was the Dutch public opinion influential on the initial decision to give political support and the subsequent decisions to deploy equipment and troops to Iraq? Did it have a large enough impact to outweigh the effects of the coalition arrangements between 2002 and 2003? Polls suggest that the Dutch were by and large against the war in Iraq. One study found that by March 18—the day of the parliament’s “political support” decision—33 percent of the respondents supported the war whereas 63 percent were opposed to it.432 When asked about their support for their country’s possible military participation in the war, a slim majority (51 percent) of these respondents noted that they were against military involvement, including the option to “replace American troops elsewhere,” which was an option considered by the CDA in the run-up to the final decision.433\n\nI pointed out in chapter 2 that isolating the direct effect of public opinion could be a difficult task in itself. Another way to gauge its influence on policy is by looking at how the decision makers utilize public opinion to assert their own positions. Do decision makers refer to the mood of the public to justify their preferences? The frequency with which the political parties refer to public opinion polls—emphasizing the negative polls—in their statements to rationalize their opposition to the war should help us understand how prevalent public opinion was in the Dutch political landscape. Using this measure, Everts concludes that “public opinion did not act as a direct constraint,” but rather it “was interpreted, mediated, and instrumentalized by the various parties in parliament”434 to limit the commitment options of the government. Public opinion was utilized by the decision makers to further legitimize their positions, including those who wanted the Netherlands to join the war. On March 17, the day before the parliamentary vote, Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende stated, “Nationally there is no broad support for active participation by the Netherlands in actions against Saddam.” He added, “I am referring to the feelings in society, as well as to the level of support within parliament. Therefore, the cabinet has decided that it can politically back-up action against Iraq, but that it will not provide any military contribution.”435 We now know, though, that the government did provide military support afterwards. This was enabled by the PvdA and D66, which conceded to the CDA in exchange for a role in the government. Clearly, the Dutch did not support the war in Page 144 →Iraq. The country’s politicians used this information strategically to justify their decisions, both for and against involvement in Iraq.\n\nAlthough one can argue that public opinion was one of the reasons the Balkenende government limited its commitment to providing political support, we now know that it was not at all a hard constraint. The caretaker government sent military equipment soon after its political support decision, despite the consistent public disapproval. Further, its successor coalition decided to send troops to Iraq later in June 2003, even though only 38 percent of the Dutch had agreed with the deployment decision—41 percent were against it, and 21 percent had no opinion.436 More remarkably, although the public was appreciative of the Dutch contingent in Iraq, the operation itself was much less popular than the country’s scandalous and tragic involvement in Srebrenica between 1994 and 1995.437 Following the news of a troop casualty about a year after the deployment, in “May 2004, a majority of around 55 percent did not want to prolong the mission, not because of the first casualty, but rather because of a negative judgment about how things were going in Iraq.”438 Despite the strength of public opposition against Dutch presence in Iraq, the mission did not officially end until March 2005.439\n\nIn sum, public opinion was hardly a constraint on the commitment behavior of the Netherlands during the war in Iraq. Although the Dutch had been strongly and consistently against the war itself as well as their country’s military involvement in it, the political parties participating in the three minimum-winning coalitional arrangements—the outgoing caretaker government, the CDA-PvdA coalition-in-the-making, and the incoming CDA-VVD-D66 coalition—all opted for supporting the Iraq war in increasing degrees of commitment. The parties’ interests in governing together trumped all else.\n\nThreat to National Survival: Were the Dutch commitments to the war motivated by perceptions of national threat? A “national threat” explanation expects that partisan differences will be put aside in making commitment decisions to protect the nation. If the commitment decisions were made primarily out of concerns regarding national security in the Netherlands, then logrolling among the ideologically diverse parties would lose its explanatory power.\n\nInternational terrorism and the historically belligerent behavior of Page 145 →Saddam Hussein were raised frequently by world leaders to frame military operations in the post-9/11 environment, certainly including the Iraq war.440 The Dutch government, too, resorted to these arguments. They pointed toward “international sources of threat” and “terrorism” to justify the intervention and to stand in solidarity with the United States. Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, the prominent CDA politician and minister of foreign affairs in the CDA-VVD-LPF caretaker coalition, had repeatedly emphasized this viewpoint. During a parliamentary session in September 2002, he stated the coalition’s opinion that Hussein was “a life-sized threat to the region and beyond.”441 In an op-ed he published in the US media less than a year later, De Hoop Scheffer would argue that “the world is a dangerous place, and we can only deal with these dangers by working together,” adding that “to effectively counter the threats facing us, coalitions of the willing may be sometimes necessary.”442\n\nThese overtures failed to resonate among the public, though. Mass perceptions of threat could have had a “rally ’round the flag” effect, inciting public support around the war effort and allowing the Dutch decision makers to commit with greater confidence. Although some argued that several European countries, including the Netherlands, had considered Iraq under Saddam’s leadership a threat, “much more diverse was the range of opinions on the question of what to do about that threat.”443 Among those opinions, direct military involvement was not an option for the Dutch electorate.\n\nIn short, there was neither an overwhelming use of threat rhetoric among Dutch political parties to justify their decisions toward Iraq, nor did this framing appeal to their electorate. In fact, the country’s commitments got more intense, not less—from political to military support—as the war progressed. If national security was a key reason, then we would have expected Dutch commitments to be at their most intense when the threat was at its highest during the initial stages of the fighting (when Saddam’s capabilities were more credible) rather than at the tail end of the operation.\n\nPolitical Leadership: To what extent did the political leaders in the Netherlands influence the country’s commitment decisions? I have explained in chapter 2 that leaders’ personal interest and dispositions on the foreign policy problem might intrude into the domestic decision-making process, thus exerting a greater influence on the policy choice than expected.\n\nPage 146 →Existing research encourages me to investigate the effect of individual leadership on the Dutch decisions regarding Iraq. In his analysis of twelve foreign policy cases during the Cold War, Everts finds that leaders’ personal involvement influences the country’s foreign policy choices as a motivating factor, if not as a direct explanation of its commitment behaviors.444 “It does help,” Everts concludes, to see the implementation of a foreign policy, “but it is not essential if the minister is personally committed to the issue in question.”445 The post–Cold War period is decidedly less constraining for small states like the Netherlands, however, which should allow national politicians to exert more influence on foreign policy decisions. Further, when it comes to wars of choice like the 2003 Iraq war, there is greater reason to expect individual convictions to sway the decision-making process. Dyson illustrates this dynamic in his assessment of British prime minister Tony Blair’s leadership in the run-up to the war.446 I want to answer if the Dutch decision was also swayed by certain individuals in the national political scene.\n\nTo do so, I focus on the prime minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, and the minister of foreign affairs, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer. Although the prime ministerial post is institutionally weaker in the Netherlands than it is elsewhere in Europe, it has gotten stronger and more influential in recent years.447 Kaarbo concludes that in the post–Cold War era, the visibility of the Dutch prime minister in foreign affairs has even “result[ed] in competition with the foreign minister and more politicization of foreign policy.”448 The foreign minister has also been considered a dominant actor in Dutch politics, from whom “most initiatives in the realm of foreign policy originate.”449 Even though Rochon argues that the bureaucratic influence of this post has declined in recent years,450 it is reasonable to expect that the person holding this position—alongside the prime minister—still holds more power in foreign affairs than most other individuals in the cabinet.\n\nWhat does the evidence suggest? Were the prime minister and foreign minister influential in committing the Netherlands to the war in Iraq? Evidence suggests that the prime minister’s role was nearly nonexistent, especiallyPage 147 → compared to Denmark’s Anders Fogh Rasmussen (chapter 4). The Davids Commission’s report on the Iraq war concludes that “the Prime Minister took little or no lead in debates on the Iraq question. He left the matter of Iraq entirely to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Only after January 2003 did the Prime Minister take a strong interest in the issue. However, by that time, the stance defined by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was firmly established as government policy.”451 In other words, neither the decision-making process that technically began in the last quarter of 2002 nor the deliberations on the possibility of Dutch commitment in the war had been driven by Balkenende, even when he became a more central actor in the process after the January 2003 election.\n\nThis leaves the foreign minister, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, as the only key individual in the foreign-policy-making environment in this period. If the government’s policy was indeed driven by the ministry’s position on Iraq, as the Davids report has concluded, then it is likely that the person controlling this portfolio had significant influence on it. And it seems that he did, especially early on. Verbeek observes that Balkenende’s “preoccupation with domestic politics allowed Minister of Foreign Affairs Jaap de Hoop Scheffer to take the lead over Iraq.”452 The Davids report explains that the foreign minister began to inquire about the Iraq campaign as early as August 2002, three months prior to Washington’s official inquiry to the Dutch for assistance.453 By the time de Hoop Scheffer gave his first statement on the issue to the Parliament in September 2002, “neither the Cabinet, nor Prime Minister Balkenende, nor Defence Minister Korthals were previously consulted about [its] content.”454 Considering that Dutch cabinets act collectively when taking critical foreign policy decisions, it seems the foreign minister had attempted a fait accompli by drafting a position ahead of and in isolation from his cabinet.455"
