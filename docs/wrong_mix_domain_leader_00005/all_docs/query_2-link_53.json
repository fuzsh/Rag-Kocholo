        "text": "Basic Intro\n\nFirst of i would like to say If by any means my concept or my choice of Civilizations and how i distributed them are offensive i apologize but i felt that it forms a good representation of each coutnry that i feel played or is playing a significant role in our current world environment and i represened it based on Current affairs;\n\nCurrently i have a thread on the Rise Of Mankind A new Dawn Sub forum. Please note that this is still a ModMod and Requires Rise of Mankind 2.91 aswell as A New Dawn 1.73\n\nAll credit belongs to Zaparra(Creator of RoM) and the other Creators of the modcomps i will be using.\n\nReasons & Backround of the Concept\n\nI firmly believe in diversity; modernization aswell as including all possible elements that have been left out in mods; aswell as to merge some of the best mods around and to bring it under one banner. Allowing the player (you and i) the ability to enjoy Civilization IV how it meant to be played with freedom and world history in mind and remaking history ofcourse.\n\n.\n\nThe Concept\n\nThere +- 90 Modern Civz; 120+ Leaderheads; +-10 New Units;6 New Buildings. i plan to include in this MoD; It will take long but i plan to do it as fast as possible; Currently i am learning everything there is to know about Leaderhead Creation; Help will be appreciated though, This is my vision of the perfect Civ Game. If it is shared then please assist.\n\nA NOTE:\n\nAll Ancient; Medievil Civilizations will also be included in this mod; aswell as all current leaders that are in currently in civ gold and normal civilization; If the civilization is already represented by one of the modern countries then it will be excluded.\n\nFor e.g Ancient Greece for modern day greece; The Dutch for Netherlands etc.\n\nBut Ancient Egypt; Roman Empire; Holy Roman Empire; Ancient Ethiopia; American Native Tribes; Asian Tribes; will be included.\n\nThe leaders that fit for each civilization in History will be included based on their factual history of where they came from in history.\n\nSo no need to be disapointed if you are one of those die hard fans of the Ancient World and Medieval World & Eras\n\nENDING NOTE\n\nI hope wants it is complete you guys will enjoy my vision and when Civ5 comes about when going into Modding a few of you will share this same vision and bring it to Civ 5.!!\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW\n\nPLEASE READ THE README FILE LOCATED IN THE .ZIP BEFORE RUNNING THE SETUP.EXE for installation if not dont properly it can lead to corruption of the game/mod, and after the installation run the woc installer located in your modules folder\n\nAlternative download link:\n\nRELEASE VERSION : VERSION 1.1\n\nPatches: Patch 1\n\nPlease take note the above patch will break save games. ie. it is not SAVE compatible!!!For installation just unzip the file into your Rise Of Mankind/Assets/Modules/ Folder and click yes if asked to replace\n\nADDONS : Culturally Linked Starts (ALREADY INCLUDED IN A NEW DAWN PATCH J, IF DO NOT HAVE THAT PATCH THEN USE THIS)\n\nThis addon allows all related civilizations to be close together so you wont get ireland it lets say next to syria, its already on A New Dawn but this file edited to include the custom civilizations For installation just copy and the paste the file to your \"Sid Meier's Civilization 4\\Beyond the Sword\\Mods\\Rise of Mankind\\Assets\\Python\\EntryPoints\\ \"\n\nIreland Civilization/Republic of Ireland\n\nThis addon is to play as Ireland or to have Ireland as one of the custom civilizations, For installation just unzip it to your \"Sid Meier's Civilization 4\\Beyond the Sword\\Mods\\Rise of Mankind\\Assets\\Modules\\ \" folder\n\nEnjoy and i apologize for the long way for the release\n\nCREDITS\n\nSince my mod is a merger of many modpacks; mod components; mod addons; and quite a massive project that has been undertaken, If i may of left you out and if you deserve to be here then please let me know; All credit is due to all the people who built the small and even bigger elements of this mod.

Asia; Europe; Americas; Oceania; Middle East\n\nBelow is the Civilizations per Continent/Region:\n\nSpoiler :\n\nMiddle East - Albania\n\n- Arab Union (Libya; Tunisia; Algeria; Mauritania)\n\n- Armenia\n\n- Assyria\n\n- Iran\n\n- Iraq\n\n- Israel\n\n- Lebanon\n\n- Morroco\n\n- Somalia\n\n- Syria\n\n- Sudan\n\n- Yemen\n\nAsia - Afghanistan\n\n- Bangladesh\n\n- Central Asian Union (Krygistan;

Paruguay; Columbia etc)\n\n- Venezuela\n\nAfrica\n\n- Benin\n\n- Central African States ( Chad; Niger; Central African Republic)\n\n- Congo\n\n- Ghana\n\n- Kenya\n\n- Khoisan People\n\n- Madagascar\n\n- Nigeria\n\n- South Africa\n\n- Southern African States ( Zimbabwe; Namibia; Angola etc)\n\n- Togo\n\n- Uganda\n\n- West African States ( Liberia; Senegal; Sierra Leone)\n\nEurope\n\n- Austria\n\n- Baktria\n\n- Belgium\n\n- Bosnia\n\n- Bulgaria\n\n- Chechniya\n\n- Croatia\n\n- Czech Republic\n\n- Denmark\n\n- Finland\n\n- Hungary\n\n- Iceland\n\n- Italy\n\n- Kosovo\n\n- Latvia\n\n- Lithuania\n\n- Autonomous/City States of Europe (Monaco;

and for updating purposes i will continously keep up with the base mods.\n\nAlso please be advised that some of the leaderheads and one or 2 civilizations where done in haste so they may not be cosmetically look perfect but they suffice for the need in hand and provide flavour; it will be improved upon in due course. Aswell on the civilopedia it may seem a bit cluttered and messy but yeah that the cost for accuracy i may shorten it to look neater but im going to take a slight break\n\nThe recommended setup for everything to work well is to install all the custom units and custom buildings aswell as a must is the folder called \"important\" which is required.\n\nThe Custom Civilizations and Leaderheads for adjustments and if you dont need are completely modular so can be deleted as you see fit. And note if you have other custom civz that are not mine there could be conflictions for which i cannot be held liable for. But i am here to assist you.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLITTLE HELP\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have done the CIV4diplomacyinfos.xml for each leaderhead aswell the required gametexts.xml for it but unfortunately; i keep on getting errors on it, so if anyone willing to help me run that properly please message me i will give you those files. But for the time being on first contact meet it'l be blank text for most of the custom leaderheads. But it wont mess up the game though.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFUTURE PLANS\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlans for the Close Future:\n\n2 New Corporations\n\nInclude Immigration Mod\n\nReligious Decay"
