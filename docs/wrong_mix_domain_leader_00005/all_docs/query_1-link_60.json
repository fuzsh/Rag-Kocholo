        "text": "Fittingly, the first international tributes to Tony Blair's 10 years as British prime minister came from across the Atlantic, where the PM's close alliance with both Bill Clinton and - especially - George Bush became a cornerstone of his foreign policy.\n\nThe White House spokesman, Tony Snow, said: \"Tony Blair has been an extraordinary leader of the United Kingdom. He and the president are strong friends and allies.\n\n\"But also, the prime minister has demonstrated the ability to work with presidents of both parties and maintain a long tradition of an alliance that is of extraordinary strategic importance.\"\n\nIn a webcast recorded in Birmingham, the Conservative leader, David Cameron, said: \"Obviously, some good things have happened in the past 10 years, not least the conclusion of the peace process in Northern Ireland just a few days ago.\n\n\"But when the PM speaks about 'some hopes had been disappointed', I think that's putting it mildly. I think many people will look back [on] the past 10 years of dashed hopes and big disappointments. So much promised and so little delivered.\"\n\nThe French president-elect, Nicolas Sarkozy - who Mr Blair is believed to have backed - is still returning from a post-campaign sailing holiday, but Mr Blair is due to meet him in Paris tomorrow.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who is also currently the chair of the EU and the G8. The president of the EU commission, José Manuel Barroso, said Mr Blair took \"Britain from fringes to the mainstream of the European Union\".\n\nThe Danish prime minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said: \"Britain has been under Tony Blair's leadership one of Denmark's closest international partners ... working together in the EU or in international operations in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan.\"\n\nThe Hungarian PM, Ferenc Gyurcsany, said of Mr Blair: \"He greatly contributed to the transformation of Britain, that Britain today is again competitive, a country with a significant influence, and at the same time he left an indelible mark on the British left.\"\n\nThe Dutch prime minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, said that with Mr Blair's departure \"a prominent leader disappears from the European and world stage. During tense moments, Blair was the binding force. Blair did not shrink from rowing against the current if he thought it was necessary.\"\n\nIn Japan, prime minister, Shinzo Abe, commented: \"Over 10 years, he achieved many things. He dealt with economic growth and also education reform, and had strong support from the British people.\"\n\nIn Northern Ireland, where the peace settlement finally saw power-sharing between unionists and nationalist restored this week, there was united praise.\n\nThe first minister, Ian Paisley, said that Mr Blair had devoted a huge amount of time to Northern Ireland - more so than his predecessors in modern times - and there was no doubt that his efforts had helped in ultimately securing devolution.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist party leader said: \"There is no doubt the prime minister's concerted efforts helped in ultimately securing devolution in Northern Ireland.\"\n\nGerry Adams, the president of Sinn Féin, said: \"The Good Friday agreement and the restoration of the political institutions would not have been possible without him.\"\n\nBut after offering best wishes for the future for Mr Blair and his family there was a sting in the tail.\n\n\"Sinn Féin want the next British prime minister to be the last with any jurisdiction in Ireland and we will work hard to ensure that this is achieved in the time ahead,\" Mr Adams said.\n\nNorthern Ireland's deputy first minister, Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness, added: \"I think everyone will recognise the positive contribution that Tony Blair has made to the development of the Irish peace process.\"\n\nSir Reg Empey, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, acknowledged that Mr Blair had shown a huge commitment to Northern Ireland and delivered a lasting settlement.\n\n\"His tactics and approach, while questionable on occasion, have delivered what we all hope is a lasting and stable political solution,\" the Stormont employment and learning minister said.\n\nMark Durkan, leader of the nationalist SDLP, said: \"He deserves immense credit for his perseverance in our process. The amount of time and personal capital he invested, alongside the taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, should never be underestimated.\"\n\nBut, in Scotland, the SNP leader and likely next first minister, Alex Salmond, was less kind.\n\n\"Tony Blair's legacy can be summed up in one word: Iraq,\" he said.\n\n\"His undoubted achievements in office - notably the Northern Ireland peace process and positive measures such as the minimum wage - will be overshadowed by his fateful decision to take the country into an illegal and unnecessary war on a false pretence.\"\n\nLabour's former leader Neil Kinnock said: \"The one word that has to be associated with Tony is 'winner', not just because of the unprecedented succession of three elections won by the Labour party with large majorities, but also a winner because of his utter insistence and his endurance in Northern Ireland.\"\n\nBut he added that it was a political \"tragedy\" that Mr Blair's achievements would be \"certainly shadowed, probably in the short term obscured\" by the war in Iraq.\n\n\"It is one of the major areas of activity of the Blair years that I find most difficult to understand. Not the engagement in war, but the nature of the association with George Bush,\" he said.\n\nAlastair Campbell, Mr Blair's former spin doctor, described the outgoing prime minister as an \"exceptional leader\" and insisted that Mr Blair believed that invading Iraq was the right thing to do.\n\nThe Scottish Labour leader, Jack McConnell, still the country's first minister while power-sharing negotiations take place after last week's election, said: \"Tony Blair has been one of the most successful political leaders of all time.\n\n\"He changed Britain for the better, and forever. He delivered the greatest constitutional change in the UK for 300 years through devolution for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, and achieved it without conflict or confusion.\"\n\nIn Wales, first minister Rhodri Morgan called Mr Blair \"a great friend to Wales\"."
