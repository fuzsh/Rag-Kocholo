        "text": "We call upon all relevant national, regional and international actors to pursue a peaceful, stable Afghanistan by ensuring women’s full participation in the peace process. After 40 years of conflict, there may finally be an opportunity for peace. The international community has an obligation to assist with ensuring that the peace forged is durable and this opportunity is not squandered.\n\nAs global leaders and foreign policy experts, we have seen clear proof that women’s involvement is key to establishing a lasting and sustainable peace. The substantive involvement of women in peace talks makes agreements more likely to be attained and upheld. We have seen evidence of women’s powerful influence in peace processes in recent times, from Colombia to the Philippines. The direct impact women’s participation has on ensuring stability makes their inclusion an international security issue, which the UN Security Council recognized when it adopted the landmark resolution on Women, Peace and Security (UNSCR 1325) twenty years ago this fall.\n\nIn the peace process underway in Afghanistan, the international community should prioritize women’s meaningful inclusion in order to help obtain the long-term security goals we have been working toward for decades. We have already seen enormous progress in Afghanistan since women have begun to be integrated into society as equal citizens. The Taliban banned girls from schooling and today over 3.5 million girls are enrolled. Women went from being virtually erased under Taliban rule to becoming policewomen, teachers, public officials, mayors and entrepreneurs. In 2019, women accounted for 28% of the Afghan parliament – a proportion higher than 67% of countries tracked by the World Bank. They will not surrender these gains. Peace cannot be made on the backs of Afghan women.\n\nGuaranteeing the preservation of equality, democracy, and inclusivity will promote stability and help to protect future generations from the threat of extremism. Afghanistan, the region, and the world would all be safer as a result.\n\nGiven the key role of women in ensuring a durable peace, the following measures are necessary:\n\nWomen need to be party to the negotiations, not just an issue to be discussed.\n\nWomen must be involved throughout every step of the process.\n\nThe perspective of women and youth must be reflected in any agreement.\n\nTo ensure these goals are met, we call on the international community to do the following:\n\nPersuade negotiators to preserve equal rights for all its citizens as guaranteed by the Afghan constitution.\n\nCondition international aid on the preservation of the rights and liberties currently enjoyed by Afghan citizens, especially women’s rights.\n\nImplement legitimate and established monitoring mechanisms for ensuring the maintenance of rights. Ensure these mechanisms are outlined in the peace agreement and that women are part of the development, implementation and monitoring of such mechanisms.\n\nAn oppressive Afghanistan will not be stable, safe or prosperous. In order to honor the sacrifices and investments that have been made over many years, we must prioritize the future role of women in Afghanistan – which starts with their substantive involvement in the peace process.\n\nSignatories\n\nKaren AbuZayd, Commissioner of the UN Inquiry on Syria and Former Commissioner-General of UNRWA\n\nMaría Elena Agüero, Secretary-General of the Club de Madrid\n\nShamshad Akhtar, Former UN Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP\n\nSheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the United Arab Emirates\n\nMadeleine Albright, Former United States Secretary of State\n\nAmat Al Alim Alsoswa, Yemen’s Former Minister for Human Rights, Former UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Assistant Administrator\n\nValerie Amos, Former UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator\n\nMayu Ávila, Former Minister of Foreign Affairs of El Salvador\n\nLloyd Axworthy, Former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada\n\nAli Babacan, Former Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey\n\nJan Peter Balkenende, Former Prime Minister of The Netherlands\n\nCarol Bellamy, Former Executive Director of UNICEF\n\nMohamed Benaissa, Former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Morocco\n\nCatherine Bertini , Former Executive Director of the UN World Food Program\n\nCarl Bildt, Former Prime Minister of Sweden\n\nJulie Bishop, Former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia\n\nIrina Bokova, Former Director-General of UNESCO\n\nLakhdar Brahimi, Former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Algeria and UN Special Envoy for Afghanistan\n\nGro Harlem Brundtland, Former Prime Minister of Norway\n\nLaura Bush, Former First Lady of the United States\n\nKim Campbell, Former Prime Minister of Canada\n\nMargaret Chan, Former Director-General of the World Health Organization\n\nHelen Clark, Former Prime Minister of New Zealand and Administrator of UNDP\n\nJoe Clark, Former Prime Minister of Canada\n\nSean Cleary, Chief Director of the Office of the Administrator General of Namibia\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton, Former United States Secretary of State\n\nKathleen Cravero, Former UNDP Assistant Secretary-General for Conflict Prevention and Recovery\n\nStaffan de Mistura, Former Under Secretary-General and UN Special Envoy to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria\n\nIsabel de Saint Malo, Former Vice President of Panama\n\nErik Derycke, Former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belgium\n\nRut Diamint, Chief of Cabinet and Advisor to the Argentine Ministry of Defense\n\nLamberto Dini, Former Prime Minister of Italy\n\nPaula J.
