        "text": "Geographic Range\n\nThe geographic range of adult European eels includes the English Channel and coasts of the Mediterranean Sea and northern Atlantic Ocean from Iceland to Mauritania (Ringuet et al., 2002). Their range also encompasses the Baltic and North Seas, as well as all accessible continental or coastal hydrosystems (Ringuet et al., 2002). In the early spring months, European eels migrate to the Sargasso sea for breeding. Larvae are hatched from the Sargasso Sea and can also be found along the coast of Europe. Silver (juvenile) stage eels of Anguilla anguilla live in tributaries along the European coast. (Ringuet, et al., 2002; Ringuet, et al., 2002; Tsukamoto, et al., 1998)\n\nBiogeographic Regions\n\npalearctic\n\nnative\n\natlantic ocean\n\nnative\n\nmediterranean sea\n\nnative\n\nHabitat\n\nDepending on the lifestage of the individual eel, European eels can be found in marine, freshwater, and brackish aquatic environments. Typically, the European eel is found in depths of 0-700 m, most often on the floor of the ocean or river in which it is living. (Tsukamoto, et al., 1998)\n\nHabitat Regions\n\nsaltwater or marine\n\nfreshwater\n\nAquatic Biomes\n\nbenthic\n\ncoastal\n\nbrackish water\n\nOther Habitat Features\n\nestuarine\n\nRange depth\n\n0 to 700 m\n\n0.00 to 2296.59 ft\n\nPhysical Description\n\nThe appearance of European eels varies greatly depending on life stage. As leptocephali, European eels are small, leaflike, and transparent (Deelder, 1970). After metamorphosing into the silver stage, European eels appear silvery in color with elongated dorsal and anal fins that are continuous with the caudal fin (Deelder, 1970). European eels lack pelvic fins (Deelder, 1970). Upon full sexual maturation, European eels develop enlarged eyes, lose their ability to feed, and turn green, yellow or brownish in color (Van Ginniken and Thillhart, 2000). (Van Ginneken and Van Den Thillart, 2000; Deelder, 1970; Van Ginneken and Van Den Thillart, 2000)\n\nFemale eels are generally substantially larger than males. The largest recorded mass of a female eel is 6.599 g (Dekker, van Os and van Willigen, 1998). The maximum published length of a European eel was 133 cm. (Dekker, et al., 1998; Dekker, et al., 1998)\n\nOther Physical Features\n\nectothermic\n\nheterothermic\n\nbilateral symmetry\n\nSexual Dimorphism\n\nfemale larger\n\nRange mass\n\n6,599 (high) g\n\noz\n\nRange length\n\n133 (high) cm\n\n52.36 (high) in\n\nDevelopment\n\nEuropean eels begin their life cycle as eggs on the bottom of the Sargasso Sea. They hatch as leptocephali, leaf-like larvae (Tsukamoto, Nakai and Tesch, 1998). After hatching, larvae spend a maximum of one year migrating to Europe, or occasionally North America, via ocean currents. The larvae will then metamorphose into 'glass eels,' the next stage of the life cycle, and enter estuarine areas. Male glass eels contineu to grow for approximately 6 to 12 years; females for 9 to 20 years (Deelder, 1970). After a final metamorphosis, European eels migrate back to the Sargasso Sea to spawn. (Deelder, 1970; Tsukamoto, et al., 1998)\n\nDevelopment - Life Cycle\n\nmetamorphosis\n\nReproduction\n\nUpon reaching sexual maturity, European eels migrate from freshwater streams back to the Sargasso Sea in order to spawn and die in the late winter months to the early summer months. European eel males release sperm into the water in which female European eels have already laid eggs, thereby fertilizing the eggs (Horie et al., 2004). Very little is known about the actual spawning mechanism, and time to hatching is variable. (Okamura, et al., 2004)\n\nMating System\n\npolygynandrous (promiscuous)\n\nEuropean eels spawn during the late winter to early spring months. There is little information on their reproduction, but since European eels are closely related to Japanese eels, Anguilla japonica, similar breeding patterns might be assumed. Female A. japonica can lay from 2,000,000 to 10,000,000 eggs, but die soon after spawning (Deelder, 1970). Eel larvae are independent from time of birth until time of death. (Deelder, 1970)\n\nKey Reproductive Features\n\nsemelparous\n\nseasonal breeding\n\ngonochoric/gonochoristic/dioecious (sexes separate)\n\nsexual\n\nfertilization\n\nexternal\n\nbroadcast (group) spawning\n\noviparous\n\nBreeding interval\n\nEuropean eels breed only once during their lifetime. Once spawning is complete, European eels die .\n\nBreeding season\n\nEuropean eels spawn in late winter to early spring.\n\nRange number of offspring\n\n2,000,000 to 10,000,000\n\nRange age at sexual or reproductive maturity (female)\n\n9 to 20 years\n\nRange age at sexual or reproductive maturity (male)\n\n6 to 12 years\n\nEuropean eels invest a substantial amount of energy in reproduction, and die shortly thereafter (Deelder, 1970). Consequently, the only resource that female eels give to their offspring is enough food source to last the egg until hatching. After hatching, the larvae are completely independent and able to find food (Lecomte-Finiger, 1994). (Deelder, 1970; Lecomte-Finiger, 1994)\n\nParental Investment\n\nno parental involvement\n\npre-fertilization\n\nprovisioning\n\nLifespan/Longevity\n\nThe lifespan of European eels is dependent on maturation time because once eels mature and spawn, they die. European eels can spawn as early as 7 years old. The maximum reported age of a European eel in the wild is 85 years (Dekker, van Os and van Willigen, 1998). (Dekker, et al., 1998)\n\nRange lifespan\n\nStatus: wild\n\n85 (high) years\n\nTypical lifespan\n\nStatus: wild\n\n7 (low) years\n\nAverage lifespan\n\nStatus: captivity\n\n55.0 years\n\nMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research\n\nBehavior\n\nEuropean eels are essentially a solitary species. Although numerous eels can be found in a single location, there is no evidence that any form of schooling is present (Suzuki et al, 2003). European eels migrate to various regions during different stages of their life. They transport themselves by actively swimming with ocean currents (Deelder, 1970). European eels are active mainly during the day. (Deelder, 1970; Tsukamoto, et al., 2003)\n\nKey Behaviors\n\nnatatorial\n\ndiurnal\n\nmotile\n\nmigratory\n\nsolitary\n\nCommunication and Perception\n\nEuropean eels sense the environment using their sense of taste. They have been shown to locate necessary amino acids via chemotaxis (Sola and Tongiorgi, 1998). European eels also utilize olfaction, most probably for homing purposes. There is little if any documentation of social communication between eels (Deelder, 1970). (Sola and Tongiorgi, 1998; Sola and Tongiorgi, 1998)\n\nPerception Channels\n\nvisual\n\ntactile\n\nchemical\n\nFood Habits\n\nEuropean eels have completely different diets during different life stages. No food contents have ever been discovered in the guts of leptocephali, therefore their diet is unknown (Fisheries Global Information System, 2005). Glass eels consume insect larvae, dead fish, and small crustaceans (Sinha and Jones, 1975). Adult eels have a fairly broad diet and eat freshwater, marine, or terrestrial fauna. Their primary food source is aquatic invertebrates, but they will eat essentially any food they can find-- even dead organisms (Sinha and Jones, 1975). European eels are reported to leap out of the water during the winter and feed on terrestrial invertebrates (Deedler, 1970). (\"Fisheries Global Information System\", 2001; Deelder, 1970; Sinha and Jones, 1975)\n\nPrimary Diet\n\ncarnivore\n\ninsectivore\n\neats non-insect arthropods\n\nmolluscivore\n\neats other marine invertebrates\n\nscavenger\n\nAnimal Foods\n\nfish\n\neggs\n\ncarrion\n\ninsects\n\nmollusks\n\nterrestrial worms\n\naquatic or marine worms\n\naquatic crustaceans\n\nzooplankton\n\nOther Foods\n\ndetritus\n\nPredation\n\nEuropean eels are preyed upon by larger eels and other fish and fish-consuming birds, such as cormorants (Phalacrocorax) and herons (Ardeidae) (Deelder, 1970). One defense mechanism employed by eels is that they hide under rocks and burrow in the sand, thus avoiding their predators. The coloring of eels at various life stagies (i.e. the transparency of leptocephali, the dark grey to green color of adults, etc.) also serves as camouflage. (Deelder, 1970)\n\nAnti-predator Adaptations\n\ncryptic\n\nKnown Predators\n\nherons (Ardeidae)\n\ncormorants (Phalacrocoracidae)\n\npredatory fish (Actinopterygii)\n\nEcosystem Roles\n\nEuropean eels are both a food source and a predator of organisms in their ecosystem. They are consumed by birds and large predatory fish (Deelder, 1970). European eels also act as a host for the nematode Aguillicola crassus which infects the swim bladders of European eels (Deelder, 1970). European eels distribute nutrients between marine and freshwater ecosystems because they migrate between those habitats (Deelder, 1970). (Deelder, 1970)\n\nCommensal/Parasitic Species\n\nAnguillicola crassus\n\nEconomic Importance for Humans: Positive\n\nEuropean eels are a popular food source for humans, especially in Europe and Asia. The eels also feed on the eggs of predatory fish such as trout, which keep ecosystems from overpopulation (Deelder, 1970). (Deelder, 1970)\n\nPositive Impacts\n\nfood\n\ncontrols pest population\n\nEconomic Importance for Humans: Negative\n\nEuropean eels thrive on a diet of marine and freshwater fauna, so impact populations of other marine and freshwater organisms (Deelder, 1970). There are no direct adverse effects to humans. (Deelder, 1970)\n\nConservation Status\n\nEuropean eel populations are not currently threatened.\n\nIUCN Red List\n\nCritically Endangered\n\nMore information\n\nIUCN Red List\n\nCritically Endangered\n\nMore information\n\nUS Federal List\n\nNo special status\n\nCITES\n\nNo special status\n\nEuropean eels can survive, and even reproduce, at temperatures as low as 0°C. Optimum temperatures for gametogenesis in Anguilla anguilla are between 0°C and 30°C (Deelder, 1970)-- quite a large range!
