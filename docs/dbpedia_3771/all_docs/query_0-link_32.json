Pollution is ruining the beauty of beaches around the world. -Jocelyn\n\nWaves lap at the shore and horseshoe crabs swarm like bees on land and sea. The only thing that distracts you from this beautiful scene is the garbage. Toys, food wrappers, clothing, you name it! -Clara\n\nOn Plumb Beach I saw two cigarette liters. You might think that’s not so bad but they still had oil in them. -Karin\n\nSome things that are making all these things go on beaches are that people through things into lakes, rivers and oceans, and those things travel around the world and end up on shores and on beaches. -Juliet\n\nWe found a steak knife, condoms, cigarettes, cap lids, straws and much more. If the fish here ate the wrong thing then we eat it, we get sick. -Payton\n\nThere are waves of trash arriving on Plum Beach. -Kiara\n\nThere were dangerous things there, like needles used to inject drugs into your body. Please try to help us find a solution! -Nicholas\n\nBirds are lovely, and die from us. When they see a lot of trash, they don’t think once, they just eat. Then are poisoned. -Oliver\n\nWe found 1 strapping band. 2 ropes. 3 oil cans. And 2 fishing nets. We also found a fire extinguisher! Please do something about this! -Carolyn Ann\n\nI don’t want to sound like I’m bossing people around but you guys have got to step up and get tough about this stuff. -Jack"
