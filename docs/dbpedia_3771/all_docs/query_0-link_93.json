This report has been prepared in an attempt to identify events of significance to fisheries managers and detail how fisheries management has evolved over the past 200 years. It is a mixture of history, anecdotes, and factual information.\n\nInformation has been drawn from a variety of published sources. In addition, many MNR staff have contributed information for the preparation of this chronology. These included Paul Bewick, Joe Churcher, Ed Desson, Paul Drysdale, Warren Dunlop, John Goodier, Gareth Goodchild, Susan Greenwood, Dr. Harold Harvey, Dr. Tim Haxton, Sarah Hogg, Glenn Hooper, Jack Imhof, Dr. Brenda Koenig, Dave Loftus, Dave Maraldo, Terry Marshall, Gary Martin, Darryl McLeod, Ola McNeil, Lloyd Mohr, Tom Mosindy, Charlie Olver, Brian Polhill, Klaas Oswald, Jim Reckahn, Dr. Henry Regier, Dave Reid, Henk Rietveld, Mark Robbins, Audie Skinner, Evan Thomas, Bruce Tomlinson, and Dr. Tom Whillans. Mark Cousins, Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters also provided information used in the document. Brenda Koenig and Matt Garvin are gratefully acknowledged for their editorial reviews of an earlier draft of this document.\n\nIt is hoped that this document will serve as a useful reference for new MNR staff as well as members of the public having an interest in Ontario’s fisheries.\n\nSteven J. Kerr\n\nFisheries Policy Section\n\nBiodiversity Branch\n\nAugust 2010\n\nAn overview of fisheries management in Ontario\n\nEuropean exploration of what is now Ontario began early in the 17th century. There are numerous reports from explorers describing the abundance of fish and wildlife which, at the time, appeared to be inexhaustible. This sentiment was later shared by many of Ontario’s early settlers: river, lake, stream and brook teamed with fishes (Gourlay 1896). The development of the fur trade served to open up northern Ontario and establish fish as a resource for barter and exploitation. Most of the early permanent settlements were fur trading posts and forts. Some of the earlier records of fish distribution were recorded by managers of local fur trading posts. At these posts, fish, particularly lake trout and lake whitefish, were a regular diet item. Fish were also salted, packed in barrels, and distributed to posts further inland.\n\nBetween 1800 and 1850 settlement of Ontario was well underway particularly in the south. Early settlements followed waterways: the St. Lawrence and Ottawa rivers, Great Lakes and inland waterways. Between 1830 and 1833 the population of Upper Canada increased by fifty percent. Most treaties were signed with First Nations during this period of time. It was also during this period that human impacts on fisheries and aquatic resources were first recognized. Land was cleared, dams and sawmills were constructed on many Great Lakes tributaries and canals were being constructed. Subsistence fishing by both First Nations people and non-aboriginal fishers was important. There are early Jesuit accounts of Crees and Ojibways starving to death during winters when fish and wildlife resources were scarce (Alison 1976). Significant portions of their catch were traded, not sold, for cash. Commercial fishing also became established on the Great Lakes during this period. Between pollution, overexploitation, and dams blocking spawning streams, Atlantic salmon started to display declines in some portions of Lake Ontario. In response, the first laws were enacted to prevent overexploitation and artificial fish propagation was developed in the widely held belief that fish stocking could counterbalance the combined effects of pollution, overfishing, and loss of spawning grounds.\n\nCommercial fisheries grew rapidly and fishing techniques improved dramatically during the period from 1850-1900 (Regier et al. 1999). By the mid 1890s more than twelve million yards of gill net were licensed for Ontario waters of the Great Lakes. By this point, commercial harvest of lake sturgeon from the Great Lakes had peaked. Atlantic salmon had been extirpated in Lake Ontario by the 1890s. Commercial fisheries had intensified on lake whitefish with improved gear and technology (Ebener et al. 2008). Management responses to the overall decline in many species included new regulations and the appointment of the first fisheries overseers. From a fisheries perspective, the period from 1860 to 1900 was focused largely on fish culture lead by the efforts of Samuel Wilmot. Stocking of hatchery-reared fish, including several non-native species such as rainbow trout, common carp and Chinook salmon, increased. Transfers of bass were also initiated in many inland waters. Increasing concerns over the declining status of many fisheries lead to the formation of the first fish and game protective associations and, in 1890, a special Fish and Game Commission was established to determine the status of game and fish in the province. Their report, submitted two years later included a widespread series of regulations, including length and creel limits, on most sport species. This era also represented a period of poor relations between the federal and provincial governments over management of the sport and commercial fisheries. The question of jurisdiction was eventually ceded to the province by the Privy Council in England and Ontario’s Fishery Regulations were extended to cover many areas of former federal responsibility.\n\nThe period from 1900 to 1950 may best be known for the continued deterioration in water quality of the lower Great Lakes and the introduction and spread of several invasive species, notably American smelt and sea lamprey throughout the Great Lakes. Lake herring stocks had collapsed in Lake Erie and the American eel had been extirpated from waters of Algonquin Park. During the world wars there was a general relaxation of conservation efforts on Great Lakes fisheries on behalf of the war effort (Regier et al. 1999). Fisheries management efforts during this period were directed largely to addressing overexploitation and attempting to enhance resident fisheries. Fish stocking and transfer programs were expanded and several deliberate introductions of non-native species (e.g., brown trout, Kamloops (rainbow) trout, walleye in the Kawartha lakes, bass in northern Ontario, etc.) were undertaken. The provincial government assumed control of all federal fish hatcheries in Ontario. It was during this time that a new provincial Department of Fish and Game was established under direction of a provincial cabinet minister. Some years later, the Department of Fish and Game was amalgamated with the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests. This amalgamation established a unified responsibility for management of natural resources on Crown lands. It also represented a general shift from protection and conservation to scientific management. Also of significance was the fact that several surveys were conducted (and subsequently published) on the province’s larger waters in the early 20th century. Increasing concern and attention was being directed to water pollution during this period. Surveys were initiated to investigate occurrences of pollution and an increasing number of cases were prosecuted. The Ontario Water Resources Commission was eventually established in 1957.\n\nAs a result of sea lamprey predation and unregulated exploitation, lake trout had been extirpated from Lakes Erie, Ontario and Michigan; were nearly extirpated from Lake Huron; and were at low levels of abundance in Lake Superior by the 1950s. The Great Lakes Fishery Commission was established to coordinate efforts among various Great Lake jurisdictions to control the sea lamprey. Large scale stocking programs for lake trout were also initiated between 1950 and 1975. Several other species of Pacific salmon (e.g., kokanee, coho, pink, chum) were stocked into Ontario waters and experimentation began with a lake trout x brook trout hybrid (splake). The 1950s and 1960s witnessed the continued decline in water quality and fish stocks in the lower Great Lakes (Beeton 1965, Christie et al. 1999). Lake Erie was declared dead. Blue pickerel were no longer found in Lake Erie and Aurora trout were extirpated from the wild during this time. There were significant population declines of walleye from Black Bay and the Bay of Quinte. Lake whitefish also declined in the Bay of Quinte. A Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement was signed with the United States (U.S.) in 1972 and measures to control the flow of nutrients into the Great lakes were initiated shortly thereafter. In July, 1971, a symposium entitled Salmonid Communities in Oligotrophic Lakes (SCOL) was convened in Geneva Park near Orillia, Ontario. The SCOL symposium represented a watershed event in fisheries management by documenting responses of fish communities to various stressors and by introducing the concept of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. The number of biologists, research scientists and conservation officers increased during the later part of this period and, in 1972, the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests was reorganized to become the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. One of the first major initiatives was the implementation of a multi-year provincial Aquatic Habitat Inventory program. This period also marked the construction of several major hydroelectric facilities as well as the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. Two new issues which appeared on the horizon were increasing impacts from invasive aquatic species and the deterioration of water quality from acid precipitation (both rain and snow).\n\nBetween 1975 and 2000, several major advances were made in fisheries management. The Strategic Planning for Ontario Fisheries (SPOF and subsequently SPOF II) initiative introduced several new concepts which sparked new policy development, modernization of the commercial fishery, introduction of a resident sport fishing licence, establishment of fisheries assessment units, the formulation of district fisheries management plans, and the need to manage fisheries onan ecosystem basis. This period also represented a time when great strides were made in the development of new fisheries science. This included several international symposia (e.g., SLIS, STOCS, CLAR, ASPY, PERCIS and LARS), two science synthesis exercises (lake trout and percid community synthesis) and the development of several provincial sampling protocols (e.g., SLIN and NSCIN). The development of new science can be attributed to a collaborative network which included federal and provincial agencies as well as anglers, commercial fishers and academia. In 1986, the federal government released its fish habitat policy of no net loss. From a regulatory perspective, the provincial Game and Fish Act was replaced by the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act. During this time, provincial policy development priorities also included wetlands, fish stocking, lake trout, baitfish, aquaculture and contributions to Ontario’s Lands for Life and, subsequently, the Living Legacy land use planning initiative.\n\nPrior to 1997, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) had been the primary agency responsible for fish habitat management in Ontario with the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) retaining the authority to authorize the harmful alteration, disruption, and destruction of fish habitat. In 1997, by way of a Memorandum of Understanding between MNR and DFO, the federal government reassumed responsibility for the enforcement of harmful alteration of habitat offences and the introduction of deleterious substance provisions of the Fisheries Act. This memorandum has evolved over the years to involve more and more agencies with an interest in fish habitat and the quality of natural waters to the point were the 2007 Inter-Jurisdictional Protocol for Fish Habitat and Associated Water Quality engaged four federal and four provincial agencies and incorporated 16 different statutes.\n\nSince 2000, the most significant undertaking has been the Ecological Framework for Fisheries Management (EFFM). This has involved designation of new Fisheries Management Zones (FMZ), streamlining regulations, creation of FMZ Advisory Councils, and the development and implementation of a state of the resource monitoring program. The EFFM represents a shift in management from a waterbody by waterbody basis to management at a landscape level. Major issues involved the continued introduction and spread of invasive species, and habitat-related impacts from a number of sources including increased hydroelectric development and climate change. With the passing of the provincial Endangered Species Act (2007), more emphasis was directed to rare and threatened species. The fisheries (commercial and recreational) for lake sturgeon and American eel were closed and recovery efforts were initiated. Other significant policy development activities included a framework for watershed-based fisheries management planning and a food fish safety policy.\n\nChronology of events\n\nPre European contact\n\nHistorically, the waters of Ontario were extensively fished by First Nations people for personal, community, and ceremonial purposes. Fish remains, dating several hundred years old, have been discovered at several archaeological sites in Ontario (McAllister 1961, 1962, Qadri and McAllister 1967). On the upper Great Lakes, lake whitefish were an important staple in the diet of aboriginal people and many villages were located near whitefish spawning grounds. Aboriginal people depended heavily on subsistence fishing (Quimby 1960, Rogers 1972, Hansen 1986). Fish were a regular and predictable food source during the spring and fall spawning seasons (Bogue 2000). Fish could also be dried and stored for longer periods of time than meat. Early European explorers reported First Nations people fishing with gill nets (often made of hemp or twisted and knotted strands of willow bark), hoop nets, baited bone hooks, and spears. Resource use by First Nations has been and continues to be recognized in treaty and aboriginal fishing rights across the province.\n\n1610\n\nLake Huron is believed to have been the first of the Great Lakes to be discovered by Europeans. Etienne Brulé, accompanied by Huron Indians, paddled from Lake Nipissing to Georgian Bay via the French River. By 1620, Brulé is believed to have travelled as far west as Lake Superior.\n\n1611\n\nSearching for the northwest passage, Henry Hudson visits Hudson Bay and claims the region for Great Britain.\n\n1615\n\nSamuel de Champlain’s expedition up the Ottawa River, overland to Lake Nipissing, and down the French River to eastern Georgian Bay. Champlain was reportedly enthused about hunting and fishing and made note of large quantities of fish caught by the Huron Indians using weirs at the Atherly Narrows between Lakes Simcoe and Couchiching. He also reported observations of Indians fishing with gill nets through the ice in Georgian Bay.\n\nOn a trip up the Ottawa River with the Huron nations, Récollets priest Joseph Le Caron noted: In places on the river and the lakes where they might catch fish they dragged behind them a line, putting on and fastening to the hook a piece of skin cut from a frog, and sometimes they caught fish with it, which gave a taste to the pot. But when not pressed for time, as on their way down [the Ottawa], some of them would go and set their nets in the rivers in which they often caught good fish, such as pike, sturgeon, and carp (not like ours however, neither so good nor so big) and several other kinds of fish which we have not got here [in France] (Greening 1961).\n\nFigure 1\n\nEarly fish hook made of caribou bone and tied with caribou thongs (T. Jenkins photo).\n\n1623\n\nRecorded observations by Gabriel Sagard of fish caught in nets set in Lake Huron: In this freshwater sea, there are lake sturgeon, Assihendos (whitefish), trout and pike of such monstrous size that nowhere else are they found bigger and it is the same with many other species of fish that are unknown to us here [in France] (Bogue 2000).\n\n1624\n\nReports of Huron Indians on Lake Simcoe putting aside the biggest and fattest Assihendo (believed to be whitefish) to boil in great kettles in order to get oil from them (MacCrimmon and Skobe 1970).\n\n1634\n\nJesuit mission to the Hurons. A permanent mission (Sainte Marie among the Hurons) was established by 1639 but was burned to the ground during a war with the Iroquois in 1649.\n\n1640\n\nJesuits describe a large camp of native people fishing on the Grand River.\n\n1655\n\nA Jesuit missionary, Father Claude Dublon, guided by Indians, canoed into Lake Ontario from the north shore.\n\n1659\n\nRadisson and Grosselier were believed to be the first Europeans to land at the head of the Great Lakes.\n\n1664\n\nJesuits make general reference to the pike and perch in the Great Lakes (Thwaites 1898).\n\n1667\n\nJesuits describe the importance of Lake Superior fisheries to the natives of the area (Thwaites 1898).\n\n1669\n\nFather Claude Daplon reported observations of local Indians fishing with hoop nets in the rapids of the St. Marys River for whitefish (Bogue 2000).\n\nLouis Jolliet was the first documented European to sight Lake Erie (Hatcher 1945). Lake Erie was the last of the Great Lakes to be explored by the Europeans since the Iroquois, who occupied the Niagara River area, were in conflict with the French and did not allow explorers or traders to pass through their territory (Casson and deGalinée 1670).\n\n1670\n\nCharles II of England granted the right to trade, in areas that could be reached by Hudson Bay, to a group of traders. This led to the formation of the Hudson Bay Company. The fur trade financed early exploration in Ontario. Many of the men dispatched to manage posts were amateur naturalists who kept records of native flora and fauna including fish. Trappers also relied on fish as food for themselves and their dogs as well as bait for their traps.\n\nCasson and deGalinée (1670) report on spawning stocks of lake whitefish in the St. Marys River: This river forms at this place a rapid so teaming with fish called whitefish, or in Algonkin Attikamegue, that the Indians could easily catch enough to feed 10,000 men. Each weighs six to seven pounds but it is so big and so delicate that I know of no fish that approaches it.\n\nAn early map of Ontario and the lower Great lakes identified the upper St. Lawrence River as being an important area for eel fishing among Aboriginal people (Casson and deGalinée 1903).\n\n1673\n\nThe settlement of Moose Factory was established by the Hudson Bay Company followed by Fort Albany (1679), Severn House (1680) and York Factory (1684). Considerable exploration of the larger Hudson Bay tributaries, including the Moose and Albany rivers, occurred during this period.\n\nFort Frontenac was constructed at the site of present day Kingston. The fort was constructed by the French to protect their fur trading interests from the British.\n\n1674\n\nJesuits describe a summertime gathering of local First Nations at the St. Mary’s Rapids, Sault Ste. Marie, for the lake whitefish fishery (Thwaites 1898). This fishery can be traced back to at least 1640 when dried fish may have been used as currency (MacDonald 1978).\n\nFigure 2\n\nOjibwas fishing in the St. Marys rapids near Sault Ste. Marie circa 1900 (National Library of Canada In McCullogh, 1989).\n\n1679\n\nRene-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and crew with permission from the King of France sailed the upper Great Lakes in the vessel Griffon. An accompanying missionary Father Louise Hennepin described the eel fishery and salmon in Lake Ontario, lake trout frequenting the mouths of Lake Ontario tributaries in such numbers that they could be killed with sticks, the sturgeon and whitefish fishery in the area of La Salle’s fort at Niagara, and setting nets weighted with stones the under the ice in 20-25 fathoms of water in Lake Huron for lake trout (Hennepin 1974).\n\n1688\n\nJacques de Noyon was believed to be the first European to reach Lake of the Woods. de Noyon reported a fall fishing expedition in which over 4,000 fish (lake whitefish, lake trout, lake sturgeon, etc.) were caught.\n\nLate 1600s\n\nEarly European explorers reported the importance of American eel fisheries to First Nations people.\n\n1725\n\nThe Michipicoten trading post was established on Lake Superior. The Michipicoten-Missinabie route was one of the most important trading routes connecting Lake Superior with James Bay. Fishing, primarily for lake whitefish and lake trout, was of vital importance to the residents as well as other Lake Superior posts.\n\n1731\n\nLa Verendrye reached Rainy Lake via the Pigeon River in what was the most widely used route for fur traders travelling from Lake Superior to Lake of the Woods. It subsequently became the basis for the international boundary between Canada and the United States.\n\n1762\n\nFur trader Alexander Henry’s journals record spear fishing through the ice at Sault Ste. Marie (Guillet 1933).\n\n1763\n\nAfter years of war, France ceded all of its North American territory, north and east of the Mississippi River, to Britain (Treaty of Paris). King George issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 which still affects many of the relations and negotiations between Canada and its First Nations. The Royal Proclamation reserved hunting grounds for the Indian people but it did not explicitly refer to fishing as an activity which could be undertaken there (Hansen 1986).\n\n1779\n\nThe Northwest Company was formed. Their first post, built at the mouth of the Nipigon River, would later serve as a fishing outpost.\n\n1789\n\nExplorer Alexander MacKenzie described fish encountered during his westward journey: Lake Superior abounds in a great variety of fish which are the most excellent of their kind. There are trout of three kinds, weighing from five to fifty pounds, sturgeon, pickerel, pike, red and white carp, black bass, herring and the last and best of all, the Ticameg, or whitefish which weighs from four to sixteen pounds and is of a superior quality in these waters (MacKenzie 1801 In Goodier 1982).\n\nObservations of Indians fishing on the St. Lawrence River: Some Indians were in the river taking fish with harpoons. They made large fires in their canoes which attracted the fish to the surface of the water where they could see by the light of the fire to strike them (Guillet 1933).\n\n1780s\n\nSurveys were initiated to determine areas suitable for harbours on the Great Lakes.\n\n1791\n\nA Constitutional Act of British parliament divided the colony of Canada into two provinces: Lower Canada (including what is now Quebec) and Upper Canada (including what is now Ontario). The first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada was Colonel John Graves Simcoe.\n\n1792\n\nNewark (Niagara on the Lake) became the first capital of Upper Canada. The first sitting of the legislature took place on September 17, 1792. The capital was subsequently moved to York (Toronto) in 1793.\n\n1793\n\nRecords indicate that early settlers speared Atlantic salmon from canoes near the mouths of the Don and Humber Rivers. Many households accumulated their own winter supply of salted/pickled salmon.\n\n1798\n\nA bill to protect Atlantic salmon in streams of York Township failed to pass in two successive sessions.\n\nThe first locks were constructed at Sault Ste. Marie by the Northwest Company. They were destroyed in 1814.\n\nA treaty was signed with First Nations which ceded St. Joseph Island in the lower St. Marys River to Great Britain.\n\nA newspaper advertisement in the May 16 edition of the Gazette of York: To be sold by public auction on Monday the second of July at John McDougall’s hotel in the town of York, a valuable farm situated on Yonge Street on which is a log house and seven or eight acres well improved. It affords an excellent salmon fishery large enough to support several families.\n\nLate 1700s\n\nMembers of First Nations sold and traded lake whitefish to European settlers on the upper Great Lakes.\n\nEarly 1800s\n\nIncreasing use of nets and weirs for taking fish. Reports of large numbers of fish being taken in seine nets from Lake Ontario. Lake whitefish were used as fertilizer and small whitefish, lake herring and lake sturgeon were destroyed as nuisances.\n\n1805\n\nThe Mississauga Nation ceded a large tract of land along the north shore of Lake Ontario to the Crown (Hansen 1986).\n\n1807\n\nAn Act for the Preservation of Salmon was passed based on concerns about the decline of Atlantic salmon. The Act prohibited the taking of any salmon by nets or weirs from any creek or river in the Districts of Home and Newcastle. It did not prevent the use of spears or hook and line or the capture of fish from spawning grounds.\n\n1810\n\nAmendments were made to the Act for the Preservation of Salmon which provided for a closed season (October 25 – January 1) and prohibited taking salmon within 100 yards of any mill or dam at any time. Members of First Nations were allowed to follow their traditional fishing practices. Similar Acts for the preservation of salmon were passed in 1821 and 1823. These Acts were repealed when a new Act was passed in 1845.\n\n1817\n\nWilliam Bell, a pioneer Lanark County pastor, wrote soon after his arrival in Perth: The Mississippi Lake affords an abundance of fish for the settlers in the neighbourhood who kill them with spears in great numbers in the spring when ascending the river to spawn (Brown 1984).\n\n1818\n\nIndian surrender of territories surrounding Lake Simcoe (MacCrimmon and Skobe 1970) and in the Kawartha lakes area (Hansen 1986).\n\n1820s\n\nThe first relatively complete shoreline survey of the Great Lakes was completed.\n\nRecords of commercial fishing with seine nets at Hamilton Beach, Lake Ontario.\n\n1821\n\nAn Act for the Preservation of Salmon was repealed to make further provisions respecting fisheries in other parts of the province and to prevent accidents by fire from persons fishing by torch or firelight. The Act was amended again in 1823 to prohibit any person from buying or receiving salmon in designated areas from any Indian.\n\nMerger of the Hudson Bay Company and the Northwest Company.\n\nSome of the earliest angling records in the Sault Ste. Marie area indicate that local British soldiers took the amusement of trout fishing and found it to be fantastic. (Spears 1913).\n\nAn account (Goodier 1984) of making gill nets for fishing in Lake Superior: Knitting new nets from imported twine was a major chore during the winter for nets and lines were frequently swept away in the stormy waters of autumn. Gill nets were strung with cedar floats and stones and dipped in boiled larch bark, a strengthening and darking agent.\n\n1822\n\nThe Boundary Commission established the border between Canada and the United States through the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes.\n\n1823\n\nAn Act for the Better Preservation of the Herring (Coregonus spp.) Fishery at the Outlet of Burlington Bay was passed.\n\nThe first extensive survey of Lake of the Woods was conducted to determine the boundary between the United States and British North America.\n\nIsinglass returns from the Hudson Bay Company (Lac la Pluie District) indicated that a substantial and sustained Ojibway commercial fishery for lake sturgeon existed in Lake of the Woods between 1823 and 1885. Isinglass is a substance obtained from the dried swim bladders of fish and used for the clarification of wine and beer as well as making specialized glue.\n\n1825\n\nThe Erie Canal opened. The 586 km canal connected the Hudson River with Lake Erie.\n\n1827\n\nThe Dunnville Dam was constructed near the mouth of the Grand River. By 1867 the Grand River Navigational Company had constructed dams at Mount Healey, York, Caledonia and Seneca. None of these dams had fishways and early reports indicated significant fish mortality at the base of the dams.\n\nEarly accounts of angling in the St. Marys River near Sault Ste. Marie indicated that brook trout were taken in great abundance (McKenny 1827).\n\n1830\n\nFur companies, including the Hudson Bay Company and the American Fur Company, expanded into commercial fishing in Lake Superior so that native peoples would not be diverted from the fur trade. Gill nets were first used by the Hudson Bay Company in Lake Superior in the 1830s. By 1839, 800 barrels of salted lake whitefish were prepared at the Michipicoten post for shipment to the American market. By 1850, the Hudson Bay Company had expanded its commercial fishery to the point where thousands of barrels of salted fish were shipped annually to market (Goodier 1982).\n\nReports of good fishing were increasingly regarded as an important recreational asset (UEL 1984).\n\n1831\n\nA seine net fishery was established in the area of the Fishing Islands off the west coast of the Bruce Peninsula. The fishery targeted lake herring and lake whitefish which were salted and sold in the U.S. At the time approximately 3,000 barrels were sold annually. Landon (1944) provided an account of this fishery: A watchman was stationed in a high tree near the shore from which he had a clear view of the lake. Suddenly there would seem to be a bright silvery cloud moving through the water. The man on watch would quickly notify the fishermen and the boats would set out with their nets which would be dropped so as to encircle the fish. Then began the work of hauling the net to shore. At times the catch was so large that the landing of the fish was extended over three days, so none were lost through inability of the curers to handle so many. At other times, when the supply of barrels or salt was running low, the net was opened to let a portion of the catch escape.\n\n1832\n\nThe Rideau Canal system opened. The 202 km canal system connected the Rideau and Cataraqui watersheds.\n\n1833\n\nPiers were constructed at Port Stanley on Lake Erie. A lighthouse was subsequently built in 1844.\n\nLaws, including closed seasons and gear limitations, were passed to provide protection for lake whitefish in the Niagara, St. Clair and Detroit rivers.\n\nAn excerpt of a letter from a young pioneer in the Peterborough area to his father in Liverpool: Our fish are the bass, the maskinonge – a more excellent species of pike, as fat almost as an eel – and the eel itself; the sunfish I believe we have but I have never seen or tasted any; the whitefish abound above and salmon trout below. The bass is our staple commodity and a most excellent one it is. If you are on the lake, tie a line, baited with a piece of red cloth, around your wrist and proceed on your journey and before you have gone a quarter of a mile you will feel your prize. In some parts of the lake if you are short of meat for dinner you may put the potatoes on to boil and before they are done enough you may have ten or twenty bass on the gridiron. Maskinonge and eel are generally speared, a very difficult matter until one has studied the laws of refraction a little. I have bought some seine twine and mean to construct a net this winter which will supply me pretty well with fish next summer. I will go to Lake Kinashgingquash next summer and bring back a barrel of whitefish which, salted, are almost as good as herrings. At any rate I cannot afford salt pork at present prices.\n\n1834\n\nA commercial gill net fishery, involving small boats and canoes, was started in southern Georgian Bay.\n\n1835\n\nDeclines in Lake Ontario Atlantic salmon stocks were first reported. Between 1846-50 commercial yields of salmon decreased notably with each passing season. By 1865, the Atlantic salmon was considered to be on the verge of extinction. Atlantic salmon were extirpated by the 1890s.\n\nFirst reliable report of sea lamprey in Lake Ontario. It is believed that sea lamprey gained access to Lake Ontario via the Erie Canal.\n\nReport of an exceptionally large lake whitefish netted in Lake Superior near the Little PicRiver. The fish was reportedly 27 inches in length and 21 pounds in weight (Goodier 1984).\n\n1836\n\nThe first account of the occurrence and distribution of freshwater fish in Canada was published (Richardson 1836). A total of 32 freshwater species were identified in Ontario waters.\n\n1839\n\nThe Hudson Bay Company escalated their domestic commercial fishery on Lake Superior. By 1850, three major posts (Pic, Michipicoten and Kaministikwia) maintained over thirty fall stations and shipped thousands of barrels of salted fish (Goodier 1984).\n\n1840\n\nAn Act was passed to regulate the inspection of fish. It allowed fish inspectors to be appointed and ensure that barrels contained 200 lb. of salted fish of required quality. This was the first Act to establish government control over the quality of fish caught commercially.\n\nLake sturgeon were reportedly so common that farm labourers insisted that their employers should not feed it to them on a daily basis.\n\n1841\n\nUpper and Lower Canada were united to form the Province of Canada. Upper Canada became known as Canada West.\n\n1843\n\nLegislation was passed to protect lake trout in Essex and Kent counties on Lake Erie.\n\n1846\n\nLighthouses were constructed at Port Dover and Port Maitland on Lake Erie.\n\nBy 1846, ten dams had been constructed across the Grand River and one hundred smaller mill dams had been constructed within the watershed.\n\n1848\n\nAn expedition lead by L. Agassiz to Lake Superior resulted in a publication on physical characteristics, limnology and listing of native fishes (Agassiz 1850).\n\n1849\n\nSamuel Strickland, an early Peterborough area settler remarked on the excellent fishing at the base of Burleigh Falls: In October 1849 between breakfast and dinner my two eldest sons and myself caught with our trolling lines thirty-five salmon trout, eight maskinonge and several large lake bass, the total weight of which amounted to 473 pounds (Guillet 1933).\n\n1840s\n\nLake sturgeon, Atlantic salmon, and muskellunge were reportedly all in decline in Toronto Bay, Lake Ontario.\n\nAn early account of American shad in the lower Ottawa River: Among other things which contributed to render this place one of considerable celebrity was its excellent fishing grounds and many varieties of fish – shad especially - being caught in large numbers. During the decade following 1845, as many as 1,200 fish were sometimes caught in one day and though they rapidly decreased from that time, 400 were often caught in a day during the two or three years which preceded the building of the dams (Carillon, 1872-1874). After construction of the first dam at Carillon, fishing continued to excel especially below the dam where the fish came to spawn and could go no further upstream. The annual run of shad provided local residents with a year’s supply of fish (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Québec Faune et Parcs 1998).\n\n1850\n\nJohn McCuaig was appointed the first Superintendent of Fisheries for Upper Canada. He had one assistant.\n\nCommercial fishermen started using pound nets on Lake Erie. They were the dominant type of net used on Lake Erie by 1890.\n\nThe town of Peterborough established a bylaw which ruled the pernicious habit of fishing on Sunday an offence.\n\nTwo major treaties were signed at Sault Ste. Marie on September 7, 1850. The Robinson-Superior Treaty was signed between Ojibway chiefs and the Crown for a large area of the Lake Superior Region. Similarly, the Robinson-Huron Treaty was signed between the Ojibway chiefs and the Crown for an area including the northern and eastern shores of Lake Huron between Sault Ste. Marie and Penetanguishene (Appendix 1).\n\n1851\n\nCensus indicates that the population of Canada West was 952,000; 96 people were employed as fishermen and fish production was 10,251 barrels.\n\n1852\n\nFirst records of commercial gill netting on Lake Erie.\n\n1853\n\nCommercial pound net fisheries were established in the Port Maitland area of Lake Erie. Target species included lake whitefish, yellow perch, blue pickerel, lake sturgeon, and lake herring.\n\nFigure 3\n\nNipigon brook trout, which were highly prized by early anglers (Ontario Department of Fisheries photo).\n\n1855\n\nS. Soo locks opened allowing passage between Lake Superior and the lower Great Lakes by bypassing the rapids of the St. Marys River.\n\nAn increasing amount of fish caught commercially in Canadian waters of the Great Lakes were exported to the United States.\n\n1857\n\nThe Federal Fishery Act (Province of Canada) was passed providing for leases of commercial fishing locations. It also provided encouragement for the artificial propagation of fish, recognized the danger of pollution and gave government authority to appoint fisheries overseers who had full authority as magistrate to enforce the statutes by search and seizure. Initially, there was widespread hostility toward government by fishermen for attempts to regulate the fishery.\n\nJohn McCuaig, superintendent of fisheries for Upper Canada, visited each of the Great Lakes to evaluate the commercial fishing industry. He recommended that fisheries inspectors should be appointed for each major fishing port.\n\nA fisheries superintendent reported a catch of 47,000 lake whitefish from a single seine net haul in Lake Ontario off Prince Edward County. The local fisheries superintendent reported the disappearance of Atlantic salmon from the Moira, Trent and Salmon Rivers (all Lake Ontario tributaries).\n\n1858\n\nThe Hudson Bay Company established a trading post at Rat Portage (Kenora).\n\n1859\n\nA local game protective club was formed (formally constituted in March 1861) in Carleton Place to protect local fish and game. Rewards ($5) were offered for information leading to convictions. In 1862, the name was changed to the Lanark and Renfrew Game Protection Society. This is believed to have been one of the first such associations in Ontario.\n\nThe Origin of Species was published by Charles Darwin. The book introduced the theory that populations evolve over the course of time through the process of natural selection. The book is widely considered to be the foundation of evolutionary ecology.\n\nFisheries overseer William Gibbard complained about anglers using brook trout as bait (Lambert and Pross 1967).\n\nFigure 4\n\nSamuel Wilmot’s early fish hatchery near Newcastle (photo from Wilmot, 1878).\n\n1860\n\nDischarge of sawmill waste into public waters was prohibited.\n\nThe north shore of Lake Superior, from Sault Ste. Marie to as far west as the Kaministiquia River, was surveyed from Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nBooth Fisheries acquired a Crown land lease for Quebec Harbour on Michipicoten Island, Lake Superior. The strategic site formed a base of fishing operations in northern Lake Superior. During the peak years a crew of approximately forty men and their families were stationed at Quebec Harbour. The rights to the station were subsequently purchased by James Purvis in 1934.\n\n1861\n\nCensus indicates the population of Canada West was almost 1.4 million with 4,124 people engaged in fisheries.\n\n1863\n\nFisheries overseer William Gibbard was murdered over a disputed fishing lease agreement on Manitoulin Island.\n\n1865\n\nSamuel Wilmot commenced rearing Atlantic salmon at a small facility on Wilmot Creek near Newcastle. This followed several years of experimentation in his home. His original goal was to restore Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario.\n\nDischarge of lime, chemicals, drugs, poisonous matter, dead fish or deleterious substances was prohibited in water frequented by fish.\n\nGentlemen and non-resident anglers fished brook trout in the Nipigon River with considerable success. Six and seven pound trout were ordinary sizes. This fishery was widely regarded as the finest trout stream in North America.\n\nRobert Roosevelt published the book Superior fishing or the striped bass, trout and black bass of the northern states in which he describes wilderness fly fishing for brook trout on the St. Marys, Chippewa, Batchawana, and Agawa rivers (Roosevelt 1865).\n\n1866\n\nFisheries staff in Upper Canada consisted of one superintendent, 18 fishery overseers and numerous fisheries guardians.\n\nIt was confirmed that Atlantic salmon were no longer present in the Trent River.\n\n1867\n\nThe British North America Act (BNA) created the Dominion of Canada which resulted in Ontario being established as a province. The federal government was given jurisdiction over fisheries while provincial governments were given jurisdiction over natural resources and property rights. This division of responsibility established the framework for the current Fisheries Act (federal) which sets rules for the protection and taking of fish while the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act (provincial) establishes rules related to licensing. The British North America Act was incorporated into the Constitution Act of 1982.\n\nSamuel Wilmot commenced efforts to rear lake whitefish.\n\nAmerican eels were found in Lake Erie – supposedly having gained access through the Welland Canal.\n\nIn terms of weight harvested, the four most predominant species in the Great Lakes commercial fishery were lake whitefish, lake trout, lake herring, and walleye. Lake trout and lake whitefish comprised almost 80% of the Great Lakes commercial catch.\n\n1868\n\nDuring the first session of the new federal parliament, the Fisheries Act was passed assimilating provincial laws and the Department of Marine and Fisheries was established. The Honourable Peter Mitchell was the first Minister of the Department of Marine and Fisheries.\n\nThe federal government provided funding to Wilmot to construct a permanent culture facility and initiate full scale production. It is believed that this was the first government hatchery in the western hemisphere.\n\n1869\n\nThe first licences for the use of pound nets in Lake Erie were issued by the Dominion government. By 1894, there were 204 pound nets in the Canadian waters of Lake Erie.\n\n1860s\n\nSignificant expansion of commercial fisheries was linked to improved access to railway lines and refrigerated railway cars. The older method of salting was replaced by packing fish on ice in large boxes which were transported to market.\n\n1870\n\nCommercial fisheries were well established on Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Target species were predominantly lake herring, lake whitefish, and lake trout. Steam powered tugs replaced smaller boats for commercial fishing. This opened up new fishing grounds further offshore.\n\nThe American Fish Culturists Association was established. The name was changed to the American Fisheries Society (AFS) in 1885.\n\nBy 1870, fishing destinations for American tourists were well established in the Muskoka lakes, the Kawartha lakes, and the Rideau lakes.\n\nFigure 5\n\nEarly commercial fishers with their catch from the Bay of Quinte (National Library of Canada In McCullough, 1989).\n\n1871\n\nPermanent buildings were constructed on Michipicoten Island and the Lizard Islands, Lake Superior, for commercial fishing activities. Fishermen often overwintered on Michipicoten Island in order to access the late fall and early spring fisheries in the area (Canada Department of Marine and Fisheries 1871 In Goodier 1982).\n\n1873\n\nAlewife were first recorded in Lake Ontario (Appendix 2). It is believed they accessed Lake Ontario via the Erie Canal.\n\nTreaty 3 was signed between the Ojibway nation and Queen Victoria. The treaty area covered a large portion (an estimated 55,000 square miles) of northwestern Ontario.\n\n1874\n\nChinook salmon were first stocked in the Ontario waters of Lake Ontario. The stocking program was discontinued in 1882.\n\n1876\n\nFirst records of muskellunge being propagated in Canada. The initial project occurred at Rice Lake, Ontario.\n\nSamuel Wilmot was appointed as the Dominion Superintendent of Fish Hatcheries. He supervised nine hatcheries across Canada including two in Ontario.\n\nThe initial planting of rainbow trout into the Au Sable River, Michigan. They appeared shortly thereafter in the St. Marys River.\n\n1877\n\nReport of an early fishing trip by anglers who sailed from Collingwood, Georgian Bay, to Rossport on Lake Superior. The fishing party reported catching lake trout up to 70 lb. and brook trout up to 7 lb. in weight.\n\nThe Hudson Bay Company post at Red Rock expanded their fishery to provide food for men working on the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the area.\n\n1878\n\nA game protective society was organized in Campbellford – one of the first in Ontario (Walkinshaw 1967).\n\n1870s\n\nResort lands were being developed on Lake Erie, Georgian Bay, Lake Simcoe and lakes in the Kawartha region.\n\nAn early explorer describes Indians fishing for whitefish at the rapids on the St. Mary’s River near Sault Ste. Marie: Indians were catching whitefish at the foot of the rapids. One man holds the canoe with wonderful skill in the swift current and another stands in the bow with a large scoop net sometimes three and a half feet in diameter. This he drops over the noses of the fish as they swim upstream. Drawing the scoop net towards him, the fisherman, by dexterous twist, closes the mouth of the net and hauls his prize aboard. In the spring and the fall large quantities of whitefish are captured in this way.\n\nFigure 6\n\nGoderich (Lake Huron) fishing fleet in 1884 (Ontario Department of Fisheries photo).\n\n1880\n\nFirst records of carp being imported into Ontario. It is believed that they were intended as a source of food for early settlers but, by 1899, their negative impact was realized and efforts were directed to prevent their spread.\n\n1882\n\nA 150 lb. – 8 foot long lake sturgeon was angled from the Niagara River. The dressed weight of the fish was 71 lb. It was sold for $3.90 (5 ½ ¢/lb.) (Kerr 1982).\n\n1883\n\nFirst release of rainbow trout into Canadian waters of the Great Lakes. The initial stocking was into Lake Superior where spawning populations were established within ten years. By 1920 they had replaced many brook trout populations which had already been overexploited.\n\nThe Anglers Association of the St. Lawrence River was founded with the goals of preservation, protection and perpetuation of game fish in the St. Lawrence River (Walkinshaw 1967).\n\nGill net fishing for lake sturgeon was prohibited in the Canadian waters of Lake Ontario (Kerr 1982).\n\n1884\n\nNon-native commercial fishing for lake sturgeon and other species began on Lake of the Woods. Fish were barged to the railhead at Rat Portage (Kenora) and shipped by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) to markets in the United States and abroad.\n\n1885\n\nThe Ontario Fisheries Act was passed. This provided provincial administration (e.g., fisheries officers, licences, closed seasons and limits) over inland fisheries under the Department of Crown Lands. Federal fisheries responsibilities were confined to the Great Lakes. One of the first regulations passed was a closed season on brook trout, lake trout, and muskellunge. Other regulations included the requirement for constructing fish passes at mill dams and the prohibition of the use of explosives or poison for taking fish.\n\nThe commercial harvest of lake sturgeon from the Great Lakes peaked at 4,901 metric tons. Between 1885 and 1895 the abundance of sturgeon in Lake Erie had declined by 80%.\n\nA federal Order in Council extended the closed season for lake whitefish and lake trout in Ontario for the entire month of November. In addition, a new regulation closed the walleye season from April 1 – May 15 and the muskellunge season was closed from April 15 – June 15.\n\nA commercial pound net fishery for lake sturgeon was established on Lake of the Woods and Rainy Lake in northwestern Ontario.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway line across northern Ontario was completed. This railway was eventually used to transfer and distribute smallmouth bass to many northern Ontario waters.\n\n1886\n\nA paddlefish was reportedly captured in the Spanish River (Nash 1908).\n\nExtensive catches of lake sturgeon were reported from Lake Erie. The local fisheries overseer reported that it was not unusual to see 900 penned sturgeon (Kerr 1982).\n\n1887\n\nForest and Stream magazine named the Nipigon River as the finest trout stream in the world. This article and other reported catches from the area resulted in many anglers travelling to the Nipigon area seeking brook trout. By the early 1900s there were reports that the numbers and average size of brook trout had declined.\n\nThe highest commercial harvest (> 600,000 pounds) of lake sturgeon from Lake Erie was recorded.\n\n1888\n\nCommission of Crown Lands issued fishery regulations including a $1 non-resident angling licence (20 sold in Kawartha lakes; 375 at Nipigon) and a brook trout season of May 1 – September 15.\n\n1880s\n\nIncreased dissatisfaction by anglers and the provincial government with the federal fisheries administration particularly with regard to inland recreational fisheries. Provincial officials insisted on a higher valuation of sport fishes and did not want to concede sport fish to the commercial fishery.\n\n1889\n\nControl and management of Ontario fisheries placed under the Crown Lands Department.\n\nThe commercial fishery in the Canadian waters of Lake of the Woods was closed following recommendations from MP Simon Dawson and senior officials in the Department of IndianAffairs indicating that sturgeon stocks were being overexploited and should be protected for the benefit of local settlers and Indians only. It was subsequently reopened in 1892 due to pressures from commercial interests.\n\nThe Canada Act (Ontario boundary) was passed establishing the western boundary of the Province of Ontario at its present location.\n\nFigure 7\n\nLake trout have traditionally been a highly valued fish in Ontario.(Ontario Department of Fisheries photo).\n\n1890\n\nAmid increasing concern about declines in fisheries resources, the Ontario Fish and Game Commission, chaired by Dr. G. A. MacCallum, was established to determine the status of game and fish in the province of Ontario. Questionnaires were circulated and personal interviews were held with sportsmen throughout the province. A total of 2,873 completed questionnaires were submitted and 283 briefs were presented to the committee.\n\nThe first vessel (the Petrel) was built for use to enforce fisheries regulations on Lake Erie. This boat was replaced in 1904 by the Vigilant.\n\nClosed season for lake sturgeon was extended to May 15 – July 15 in Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.\n\nNumbers of sportsmen and tourists, travelling by the Canadian Pacific Railway, increased in the Kenora-Lake of the Woods area (Nute 1950).\n\n1892\n\nThe Ontario Fish and Game Commission was consolidated into a five member Board of Fish and Game Commissioners by an Act for the Protection of Provincial Fisheries which was passed by the provincial legislature.\n\nThe report of the Ontario Fish and Game Commission was released. The report identified the lack of enforcement of existing laws. It included sweeping recommendations to protect resources. It resulted in the institution of creel limits and minimum length limits for bass and brook trout.\n\nFour full time salaried game wardens were hired in Ontario. In addition, 392 deputy wardens were appointed. Deputy wardens were not paid a standard salary but, instead, received half of the fines they secured. In 1893 the province was officially divided into five warden zones.\n\nOntario and Quebec challenged the federal jurisdiction in fisheries.\n\nAlewife became abundant in Lake Ontario.\n\nCommercial fishing was initiated on the Ontario portion of Lake of the Woods. An early account: fish is king here just now and it makes one feel very wealthy to watch the loading of the railway cars with such splendid samples of the finny type and to realize something of the enormous food supplies which are the common heritage of Canada, (Nute 1950).\n\nThe Norman dam was constructed at the western outlet of Lake of the Woods for control of lake levels.\n\n1893\n\nOver 400 individuals engaged in commercial fishing on Georgian Bay. The fishery consisted of 150 boats, 15 tugs, and 1.5 million yards of gill net.\n\nEdward Prince, an English fisheries scientist, was appointed Dominion Commissioner of Fisheries.\n\nAlgonquin Provincial Park, Ontario’s first provincial park, was established as a public park and forest reservation, fish and wildlife preserve, health resort and pleasure ground for the people of Ontario. A total of 2,456 lakes are situated in the park. Upon purchase of a park fishing licence, angling, with rod and line only, was permitted. All other means including nets, spears, and night lines were strictly prohibited.\n\n1894\n\nFederal Order in Council referred questions in the matter of jurisdiction of provincial fisheries to the Supreme Court of Canada. Prior to this there had been several public and legal challenges to the federal fisheries administration.\n\nGame warden’s annual salaries were increased from $120 to $400.\n\nBy 1894, caviar was making Lake of the Woods famous among gourmets (Nute 1950).\n\n1896\n\nFirst record of carp in Lake Simcoe (MacCrimmon and Skobe 1970).\n\n1897\n\nLast record of Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario.\n\n1898\n\nThe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, England, ruled that the property rights of inland fisheries were vested in the Province. As a result, the Province of Ontario obtained jurisdiction over the fisheries of the province from the federal government. The Ontario Fishery Regulations were extended to cover previous areas of federal responsibility.\n\nThe Ontario Fisheries Commission, chaired by F. R. Latchford, was established.\n\nSome of the earliest records of bass transfers in and around Algonquin Park were recorded.\n\nThe Biological Board of Canada was established by the federal government to encourage scientific fisheries research.\n\n1899\n\nOntario established a provincial Fisheries Branch, under a Commissioner, which promoted recreational fisheries. From 1899 to 1902 this Branch reported through the Attorney General’s Department and later to the Department of Public Works.\n\nFederal fish commissioner and provincial deputy commissioner in separate reports drew attention to the growing importance of pollution.\n\nReport from the Deputy Commissioner of Ontario’s Fisheries Branch, S. T. Bastedo, stating that there can be nothing more destructive to fish life than the depositing of sawdust on the rivers and lakes. He also urged the formation of more clubs and associations to aid the government in the great work of protection.\n\nIchthyological results of an early U.S. expedition to the Muskoka region of Ontario are published (Meek 1899).\n\nThe steamer Gilphie was purchased for $3,250 and used for enforcement patrols on Georgian Bay. In the following years several vessels were purchased to patrol the Great Lakes and larger inland waterways.\n\nFigure 8\n\n“Gilphie” was one of the first boats used for patrols on the Great Lakes. (Ontario Department of Fisheries photo).\n\n1890s\n\nFish sanctuaries established at several spawning/concentration areas on the Great Lakes (Bay of Quinte, eastern Georgian Bay, Lizard Islands on Lake Superior).\n\nSome of the earliest records of anglers using ice shanties on Lake Erie during the winter (Hatcher 1945).\n\n1900\n\nThe commercial fishery for lake whitefish was reduced in nearshore areas of the Great Lakes as a result of expanding fisheries and habitat degradation.\n\nPoaching in Lake Superior, by both Canadians and Americans, was rampant. For example, twelve of twenty-eight pound nets fishing in the Thunder Bay area waters of Lake Superior were found to be unlicensed (Goodier 1982).\n\n1901\n\nA federal fisheries research station was established at Go-Home Bay, Georgian Bay. Annual reports were submitted to the province during the station’s period of operation from 1903-1913. The facility was closed in 1914.\n\nConstruction of the Ontario and Rainy River railway (now the Canadian National Railway) between Thunder Bay and Winnipeg was completed.\n\nThe province of Ontario expanded the transfer and distribution of bass. Distribution of bass in northern Ontario was often conducted by rail using specially designed railway cars. In one instance, 10,000 adult bass were captured from Lake Nipissing and released in eighteen different lakes and rivers in the area.\n\nFigure 9\n\nSpecially equipped railway cars were used to distribute many bass across northern Ontario (Ontario Department of Lands and Forests photo).\n\n1902\n\nA fish removal program was initiated on the Nipigon River with the intent of enhancing brook trout. Between 1902 and 1921, thousands of predatory fish, including walleye, northern pike, suckers, sturgeon, and lake whitefish, were removed.\n\nA 1902 article from an Ottawa newspaper (St. John Daily Sun) illustrated the abundance of American eels in the Ottawa River: A turbine mill wheel which ran a gang of saws at the Chaudier waterfall stopped suddenly. Upon shutting done the mill and unscrewing the upper cap it was discovered that the wheel had become packed full of eels. It looked as though there must have been hundreds of thousands of them.\n\n1903\n\nThe sale of game fish was prohibited in the Province of Ontario. This was particularly important for bass, brook trout, and muskellunge. The same regulation established the brook trout limit at not more than 10 lb. and not greater than 30 fish.\n\nRecords indicate it was common for new commercial fishing licences to be refused based on the limited entry concept.\n\nAt the request of local sportsmen, smallmouth bass were obtained from the Department of Game and Fisheries and planted in Lake of the Woods and surrounding lakes.\n\nRegulations were introduced to close the fishing season for lake sturgeon during their spawning period.\n\n1904\n\nA non-resident angling permit allowed for the export of a two day limit of fish.\n\nThe commercial harvest from Lake Huron peaked at 27.4 million pounds.\n\nFirst rainbow trout reported from Lake Huron. By 1930 rainbow trout had developed spawning populations in many tributaries.\n\nGill nets were introduced to the Rainy Lake and Lake of the Woods commercial fisheries.\n\nThe severe winter of 1903-04 caused many portions of Lake Scugog to freeze to the bottom of the lake whose water level was several feet lower than previous years. This resulted in a massive fish kill.\n\nFigure 10\n\nPhases of early bass culture at the Sandfield fish culture station on Manitoulin Island (Photo from the collection of H. R. MacCrimmon).\n\n1905\n\nThe Premier of Ontario dispenses with salaried district fisheries supervisors and increases the number of part-time officers to 156.\n\nW. Bartlett, superintendent of Algonquin Park recollects the bass introduced some years ago have proved a great success and the lakes in which they were placed and all connected streams now afford splendid bass fishing. (Bartlett 1905).\n\n1906\n\nConstruction of the hydrogenerating station at Kakabeka Falls commenced.\n\n1907\n\nAn Act Respecting the Game, Fur-Bearing Animals, and Fisheries of Ontario was passed.\n\nThe Game and Fisheries Commission was abolished and a new Department of Game and Fisheries was created under the control of a provincial cabinet minister. The structure of the new Department consisted of the Minister, the Superintendent of Game and Fisheries, a field staff of paid inspectors and wardens and 215 deputy wardens. Wardens were based at Simcoe, Windsor, Belleville, Beaumaris, North Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, and Kenora. In 1916, the Game and Fish Branch became a Department under the direction of various Ministers in the following years.\n\nWinter spearing licences were issued to take lake trout and lake whitefish on Lake Simcoe. By 1920, as many as 122 licences were issued. Spearing licences were discontinued in 1941.\n\n1908\n\nThe federal government built hatcheries at Sarnia and Wiarton. Both facilities were closed in 1954.\n\nWalleye were introduced into Mississippi Lake in southeastern Ontario (Brown 1984).\n\n1909\n\nThe provincial government became involved in fish culture with a facility at Mount Pleasant (Appendix 3). This involved experimental rearing of bass. This was Ontario’s first provincially directed hatchery.\n\nThe federal fisheries inspector in his report to the Superintendent of Fisheries stated: whitefish and trout have decreased to a very marked extent and this, when taken into consideration with the greatly improved methods of fishing steam lifts and steam tugs thus enabling the fishermen to go into waters far from the shore where the sail or rowboats were formerly unable to reach…depletion is going on from year to year at an alarming rate.\n\nThe Boundary Waters Treaty was signed between Canada and the United States. Its significance was to identify measures to resolve international disputes over shared resources.\n\nDam and powerhouse construction on the outlet of Rainy Lake. Additional dams and hydro facilities were constructed in the area at Namakan Lake (1914), Calm Lake (1926), and on the Seine River system (1928).\n\nThe Quetico Forest was established. It was subsequently assigned provincial park status in 1913 and expanded in size in 1931.\n\nA Royal Commission into the state of Ontario’s game and fisheries was initiated by Kelly Evans. After review, he proposed the appointment of wardens paid on commission and an overhaul of existing services including the establishment of a smaller full-time professional staff.\n\n1910\n\nAn International Fisheries Commission recommended a four year moratorium on all fishing for lake sturgeon on Lake of the Woods in order for the stocks to rebuild. The recommendation was accepted by the Canadian legislature but not the Americans.\n\nThe Game and Fish Commission had 13 steam, gas, or sail-powered vessels purchased or under lease for patrolling the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. Additional vessels were also patrolling the Rideau system, the Kawartha lakes, Lake Simcoe, the Muskoka lakes and Lake Nipissing.\n\nReports of a decline in lake whitefish abundance in the Michipicoten Island area of Lake Superior (Goodier 1989).\n\n1911\n\nAnnual report of the Department of Game and Fisheries mentions a widespread system of pollution of our lakes, rivers and streams.\n\nFisheries overseer C. J. Kerr recommended the establishment of fish and game preserves (Kerr 1982).\n\n1912\n\nAmerican smelt were introduced to Lake Michigan and gradually spread to the remaining Great Lakes.\n\nFormation of the International Joint Commission (IJC) under the Boundary Waters Treat Act of 1909. The IJC was designed to deal with issues of water quality in the Great Lakes.\n\nThe first commercial fishing licence was issued for Lac Seul.\n\nThe grand prize for a salmon (lake) trout, in the two thousand dollar contest organized by Field and Stream, was awarded for a salmon trout caught in Lake of Two Rivers, Algonquin Park. It measured 30.5 inches (Bartlett 1912).\n\nSeveral specimens of fish taken from Delano Lake, Algonquin Park, had the appearance of a brook trout – lake trout hybrid. One specimen was forwarded to Professor Edward Prince, Department of Marine and Fisheries in Ottawa, who concluded that the fish was indeed a natural hybrid. He also indicated an interest in experimenting to determine if the hybrids could be produced artificially.\n\n1913\n\nThe first introduction of brown trout into Ontario waters.\n\nThe federal fisheries department agreed that the propagation of sporting fish in Ontario will be left with the provincial government.\n\nFigure 11\n\nBrown trout were introduced into Ontario from Europe in 1913 (Ministry of Natural Resources’ photo by Ian Rayner).\n\n1914\n\nThe Kenora fish hatchery was constructed to rear walleye, lake whitefish, lake trout and brook trout. The hatchery was closed in 1961.\n\n1915\n\nA world record brook trout, weighing 6.58 kg (14.5 lb.), was angled from the Nipigon River by Dr. J. W. Cook of Fort William (Appendix 4). The fish is recognized as a world all tackle record (IGFA 2010).\n\nCommercial harvest from Lake Erie peaked at 76.3 million pounds.\n\nInauguration of the Canadian Fisheries Association. The desire was to have all persons engaged in the fisheries industry to be a member. Their name was changed to the Fisheries Council of Canada in 1945.\n\n1916\n\nPrompted by a meat shortage during World War 1, a licence to net lake whitefish and lake trout on Lake Opeongo was issued to a local Whitney butcher (Shaw 1998).\n\n1917\n\nLake Nipigon was opened to commercial fishing (Gibson 1968). The commercial harvest peaked at 2.3 million pounds in 1919.\n\nA regulation was passed whereby the Department of Fisheries reserved the right to purchase 20% of the commercial catch from designated waters (Lake Nipigon, Lake Nipissing, Lake Huron and Georgian Bay) to provide an affordable food source for local residents. Prior to this most commercial catches were exported to the United States because of higher prices.\n\n1918\n\nDuring World War 1, the Fish Sales Branch was established under the Department of Game and Fisheries. Their mandate was to secure fish and ensure that they were made available at fixed prices to Ontario consumers. The need for this Branch ended shortly after termination of the war and it was discontinued in 1922.\n\nAlgonquin Park superintendent G. W. Bartlett recollects In the spring of 1918 it was decided to take out a quantity of mullet (suckers) from the lakes near headquarters, where they had become very numerous, much to the detriment of the better fish, and five tons were taken out and shipped bringing $129.20.\n\n1919\n\nThe Ontario government initiated studies on many of Ontario’s larger waterbodies. Based on these and earlier expeditions, several noteworthy fisheries publications were produced between 1908 and 1939. These included Fishes of Ontario (Nash 1908), Fishes of Georgian Bay (Bensley 1915), Fishes of Lake Abitibi (Dymond and Hart 1927), Fishes of Lake Erie (Dymond 1922), Fishes of Lake Nipigon (Dymond 1926), Fishes of Lake Ontario (Dymond et al. 1929), and Fishes of the Ottawa Region (Dymond 1939).\n\nThe Ontario Fisheries Research Laboratory in the Department of Zoology, University ofToronto, was formed under the direction of Professor W. A. Clemens.\n\n1920\n\nThe Department of Game and Fisheries was reorganized and enlarged to include 60 full time overseers under seven district superintendents (Skuce 1959).\n\nThe 50th annual meeting of the American Fisheries Society held in Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nThe Trent-Severn waterway opened. The canal system, comprised of 45 individual locks, connected the Bay of Quinte with Georgian Bay. The Trent and Severn River drainages were linked at Kirkfield.\n\nThe first sport fishing resorts in northwestern Ontario were established during the early 1920s in the Nestor Falls-Sioux Narrows area on the east side of Lake of the Woods.\n\n1921\n\nAn article in a July 1921 edition of Rod and Gun magazine encouraged the public to take up fish stocking by detailing the process for capturing, raising and stocking fish into the wild with the only caution that care should be taken that the capture of parent fish does not cause conflict with the closed season.\n\nWalleye were introduced into several of the Kawartha lakes. This introduction served to establish a number of self-sustaining populations.\n\nThe sea lamprey was first recorded above Niagara Falls in Lake Erie (near Port Alma). Access was associated with the opening of the Welland Canal.\n\nCommercial harvest from Lake Ontario peaked at 6.5 million pounds.\n\nThe fee for a non-resident angling licence was increased from $2 to $5. This fee applied to designated areas including Lake Nipigon and the Nipigon River.\n\nFigure 12\n\nAurora trout, a colour variant of brook trout (Ministry of Natural Resources’ photo).\n\n1922\n\nA lake sturgeon, weighing 310 lb., was caught by a commercial fisher using a pound net in Batchawana Bay, Lake Superior. This remains the largest authenticated specimen recorded from Ontario waters.\n\nThe Ontario government banned the use of bull nets. Bull nets were deep gill nets which were extremely efficient at catching fish. Bull nets were banned in most American jurisdictions by 1934.\n\n1922-1926\n\nFirst efforts in Ontario to propagate lake sturgeon. The project, undertaken by the Ontario Fisheries Research Laboratory at the University of Toronto, occurred on the Gull River, a Lake Nipigon tributary.\n\n1923\n\nAurora trout were first discovered in several small lakes north of Sudbury. Originally thought to be a new fish species (Henn and Rickenbach 1925), but they have since been described as a colour variant of brook trout. A 2.22 kg Aurora trout, angled from Carol Lake in 1996, is recognized as the world all tackle record (IGFA 2010).\n\nThe Williams Treaty was signed with the Mississauga and Chippewa First Nations. The treaty covered lands in southcentral Ontario and the northern shore of Lake Ontario.\n\nBlack crappies were first introduced into the U.S. waters of Lake of the Woods.\n\n1924\n\nCommercial harvest of lake whitefish from Lake Ontario peaked at 2.8 million pounds.\n\nBy Order in Council, the special fishery regulations for Ontario were amended to institute a minimum size limit of 15 inches for walleye.\n\n1925\n\nThe first biologist (Dr. H. H. MacKay) was hired for fisheries work which included directing surveys of provincial waters as well as overseeing six provincial fish hatcheries.\n\nThe first lake surveys were conducted on Ontario inland waters.\n\nThe commercial harvest of lake trout from Lake Ontario peaked at 1.1 million pounds.\n\nAmerican smelt were first reported in Lake Huron. Smelt were not reported in the Canadian waters of Lake Huron until 1931 (Dymond 1944).\n\n1926\n\nThe Ontario Department of Game and Fisheries assumed control of all eight federally operated fish culture stations in the province.\n\nInaugural meeting of the Toronto Anglers Association. This group would later become the Federation of Anglers. By 1928 their membership had reached two thousand and they had launched a campaign to organize and affiliate with other sportsmen clubs in the province.\n\nSabaskong Bay on Lake of the Woods was closed to commercial fishing, except for coarse fish trapping, in response to conflicts with the growing tourist sport fishery for walleye and other target species in the area.\n\n1927\n\nRivers and Streams Act amended to become the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act. Under this Act approval was now required to construct or alter a dam or to make any modifications to a waterbody which could alter fish habitat.\n\nThe Ontario waters of Lake of the Woods were divided into 58 blocks or lots which were licensed for the exclusive use of individual commercial fishers.\n\n1928\n\nA Fish Culture Branch was established to unify the biological and fish culture activities of Department, to promote the restocking of lakes, and to detect pollution in suspect areas.\n\nThe Ontario government announced the creation of a Special Committee on the Game Fish Situation in Ontario. The secretary of the committee was W. J. K. Harkness. This committee toured the province in 1929 and 1930 hearing representations from municipalities and sportsmen. Their report, which included 84 recommendations, was tabled in March 1930.\n\nSmallmouth bass were introduced into Opeongo Lake, Algonquin Park.\n\nFigure 14\n\nRearing lake whitefish eggs at the Little Current fish culture station (O. C. Jennett photo).\n\n1929\n\nThe first expedition to Algonquin Park, by W. E. Ricker and F. P. Ide, was made to study lake trout ecology in Wolf and Ragged lakes (Shaw 1998).\n\nAn Order in Council amended the special fishery regulations for Ontario so that no one shall without the approval of the Department of Game and Fisheries import fish for the purpose of restocking public waters of the Province or transfer any fish from one body of water to another within the Province.\n\nThe Northern Ontario Tourist Outfitters (NOTO) was officially incorporated. NOTO is a non-profit organization which currently represents 294 member tourist operations (Nature and Outdoor Tourism Ontario).\n\nSuperior Shoal in Lake Superior was discovered during a U.S. survey (Landon 1959). It was further surveyed by the Canadian hydrographic ship Bayfield in 1930 (Goodier 1982). Once known, the shoal produced many large commercial catches of lake trout (Goodier 1989).\n\n1920s\n\nLake herring stocks in Lake Erie collapsed.\n\nCharter boat fisheries became established on Lake Erie and Lake Huron (targeting lake trout) (Loftus 1979, Regier et al. 1999). By the 1950s, a charter boat fishery had been established on Lake Superior (targeting lake trout).\n\n1930\n\nTwenty-two government-operated fish culture stations were present in Ontario.\n\nA second biologist (W. H. R. Werner) was hired to assist H. H. MacKay in the Biological and Fish Culture Branch of the Department of Game and Fisheries.\n\nThe 60th annual meeting of the American Fisheries Society was held in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nGame wardens were first issued uniforms.\n\nCommercial fishers used gill nets made of linen. By 1950, linen nets had been replaced by cotton and later by nylon.\n\nAmerican smelt were first reported in Lake Superior (Dymond 1944).\n\nThe 24th annual convention of the International Association of Game, Fish and Conservation Commissioners was held in Toronto.\n\n1931\n\nThe Federation of Ontario Naturalists (FON) was formed as a charitable organization of more than 25,000 members to protect wild species and spaces. Their name was recently changed to Ontario Nature (Ontario Nature).\n\nAlewife were first reported in Lake Erie. Their presence was attributed to movements through the Welland Canal.\n\nSea lamprey were first observed in Lake Huron.\n\n1932\n\nAn attempt was made to control the spread of noxious species of fish by prohibiting the liberation of minnows and other small fishes except into the water from which they originated.\n\nCompletion of the fourth (present) Welland Canal which served to circumvent Niagara Falls. Previous canals had been constructed in 1829, 1848, and 1887.\n\nThe White Lake fish hatchery property was deeded to the Department of Game and Fisheries.\n\nThe Grand River Conservation Commission Act was passed allowing municipalities in the Grand River watershed to address water management issues at a watershed scale.\n\n1933\n\nAlewife were first reported in Lake Huron.\n\nFort Frances hatchery opened to supply eyed-eggs of walleye and lake whitefish for waters in the Kenora and Fort Frances areas.\n\nFigure 15\n\nFish stocking in Ontario peaked in the late 1930s – early 1940s (Ontario Department of Lands and Forests photo).\n\n1935\n\nKamloops trout, an inland strain of rainbow trout imported from British Columbia, were first stocked in Ontario waters. Stocking continued until 1957.\n\nOriginal stocking of Atlantic salmon in Trout Lake near North Bay. Of all the inland waters stocked with Atlantic salmon, only Trout Lake developed a small, self-sustaining population which still exists today.\n\nLake trout had become non-existent in Hamilton Harbour by the mid 1930s.\n\nSmallmouth bass were introduced into Shebandowan Lake (Monk 1966).\n\nFirst smelt were reported in the Canadian waters of Lake Erie. They had been recorded in Lake St. Clair in 1932 (Dymond 1944). By 1952, smelt had become quite abundant in Lake Erie.\n\nAt the urging of Frank McDougall, Superintendent of Algonquin Park, for more research in Algonquin Park, W. J. K. Harkness selected the location on Opeongo Lake for a permanent fisheries research laboratory.\n\nFigure 16\n\ncoarse fish removal programs, for species such as carp, were very common in Ontario between 1930 and 1960 (Ministry of Natural Resources’ photo).\n\n1936\n\nThe Opeongo Limnological Laboratory (the fish lab) in Algonquin Park was established (Harkness and Fry 1942). A formal agreement, between the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests and the University of Toronto, was not signed until 1954. This laboratory became a major center for research and field studies.\n\nThe Opeongo creel survey was initiated by Dr. F. E. J. (Fred) Fry. The survey was subsequently coordinated by N. V. (Nick) Martin (1946-1963), J. M. (Jim) Fraser (1964-1969), D.(Don) Cucin (1970-79), and J. A. (Jim) MacLean (1980). It has continued annually since that time and is believed to be the longest standing uninterrupted source of creel information in the world.\n\nLast record of American eel in Algonquin Provincial Park. Its extirpation from the Park was attributed to the construction of dams and hydroelectric facilities on the Madawaska and Petawawa rivers.\n\nArchibald G. Huntsman was elected to a one-year term as president of the American Fisheries Society. He was the first of five Ontario residents to serve in that capacity.\n\nMacLeans magazine reported that the Grand River fishery had become a memory with trout and bass replaced by carp and suckers.\n\nProvision was made to licence tourist outfitters in northern Ontario. Tourist outfitter fees were $10 for residents and $25 for non-residents. In 1937, a total of 498 camps were licenced. This subsequently increased to 642 in 1939 and 1,543 by 1952.\n\n1938\n\nThe province of Ontario stocked more fish than all other provinces and the federal government combined.\n\n1939\n\nThe Nogies Creek fish sanctuary was established near Bobcaygeon, Ontario. This area eventually became the focus of muskellunge research by Dr. E. J. (Ed) Crossman.\n\n1930s\n\nSea lamprey invaded the upper Great Lakes. Although first recorded in the upper Great lakes during the 1920s, it took some time to become established until they ultimately spread rapidly into Lake Huron.\n\nRainbow smelt were present in all five Great Lakes.\n\nThe first studies of muskellunge biology were initiated in Ontario (MacKay 1931, Dymond 1932, Harkness 1934).\n\nCoarse fish removal programs became a common fisheries management technique particularly in southern Ontario (Appendix 5). Most programs involved mechanical removal of species, including carp, burbot, and northern pike, in an attempt to enhance the abundance of sport fish species.\n\nFigure 17\n\nSea lamprey was one of the most destructive species to invade the Great Lakes (Ministry of Natural Resources’ photo).\n\n1940\n\n70th annual meeting of the American Fisheries Society held in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nLake herring were deliberately introduced to Lake Opeongo to provide forage for lake trout. An additional introduction was conducted in 1948.\n\nNylon gill nets were first used in the commercial fishery of northwestern Ontario.\n\nThe estimated sport harvest of walleye from the Ontario waters of Lake of the Woods equalled the commercial walleye catch for the first time. At the time, the commercial fishery was regulated to a minimum gill net mesh size of 4½ inch stretched measure and the minimum size of saleable walleye was 15 inches. Anglers were restricted to 8 walleye per day (16 in possession) with a minimum size limit of 13 inches.\n\n1941\n\nThe Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH) was formed as a result of the amalgamation of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and the Ontario Hunters Association.\n\nCommercial harvest from Lake Superior peaked at 25.5 million pounds.\n\nAn American expedition to Quetico Provincial Park resulting in a publication listing fishes native to that area (Lindeborg 1941).\n\nSpear fishing for lake trout and lake whitefish was banned. This had been a traditional activity on Lake Simcoe (Kirk 2001). Between 1907 and 1941, licensed spear fishers reported a winter lake trout harvest of almost 500,000 pounds.\n\n1943\n\nWaboose dam construction completed on the Ogoki River. This diverted water from the Hudson Bay drainage through the Lake Nipigon system into the Great Lakes drainage. Construction of hydroelectric facilities between 1920-1950 on this system flooded rapids, blocked fish movements, and altered lake morphometry.\n\n1944\n\nThe Junior Forest Ranger program (currently known as Ontario Rangers) was established. The program was initially established as a means of recruiting future staff. Over the years a considerable amount of fish habitat restoration and enhancement has been completed using Ontario Ranger labour.\n\nThe Research Division of the Department of Game and Fisheries was formed under the direction of Dr. C. H. D. Clark. Prior to this, most fisheries research had been conducted through subsidized university studies. By 1946, research headquarters had been established at Maple, Ontario.\n\nAn experimental Atlantic salmon program was initiated on Duffins Creek, a Lake Ontario tributary. From 1944-46, approximately 40,000 fry were stocked each year (MacCrimmon 1950). Assessment was conducted to determine habitat selection and post-stocking survival. The project was discontinued after poor results.\n\nLake Superior Provincial Park was established. The park supports a large number of brook trout and lake trout waters. It was classified as a natural environment park in 1967.\n\n1945-46\n\nCollapse of the lake trout fishery in Lake Huron.\n\n1946\n\nThe Department of Game and Fisheries was reorganized as the Division of Fish and Wildlife in the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests (it had formerly been under the Ministry of Mines). The Division Chief was Dr. W. J. K. Harkness (Appendix 6). There were four Sections in the new Division: fisheries, enforcement, wildlife, and commercial fisheries. The new division was developed with the objective of managing fish and game on the basis of scientifically proven facts. From a field perspective, there were eight administrative regions and twenty-two districts.\n\nOne hundred and thirty-six full time enforcement staff were employed in the Division of Fish and Wildlife. Conversely, there were only five permanent biologists.\n\nThe monthly catch report and implementation of quotas in some areas were among the first actions taken by the new Commercial Fish Section.\n\nThe Ontario Council of Commercial Fisheries was established. It was later to be renamed the Ontario Fish Producers Association and, subsequently, the Ontario Commercial Fisheries Association. The association represents the commercial fishing industry which currently employs approximately 3,500 people in Ontario.\n\nFish and wildlife technical staff were first trained at newly opened Forest Ranger school near Dorset, Ontario. In December, 1946, a two week course was organized for Fish and Wildlife biologists, technicians and overseers on identification and ecology of various species of fish, birds and mammals.\n\nThe Great Lakes Fishery Treaty was signed but never ratified.\n\nSea lamprey were first reported in Lake Superior.\n\nThe Conservation Authorities Act was passed by the provincial government in response to growing concern about the state of natural resources resulting from poor land, water and forestry practices in previous decades. Currently there are 36 Conservation Authorities in Ontario (Appendix 7).\n\nAn Ontario-Quebec waterpower agreement was signed for the Ottawa River.\n\nFigure 18\n\nWinter fishing for lake whitefish, which has been a traditional activity on Lake Simcoe (Photo from the collection of H. R. MacCrimmon).\n\n1947\n\nThe first permanent fisheries research station in Ontario was established at South Bay on Manitoulin Island (Maher 1966). Although one of the original objectives of the station was to investigate the status of lake trout stocks, the program quickly developed studies involving lake whitefish. Research indicated that whitefish year class strengths were determined by factors including amount of northeast wind, winter severity, and spring air temperatures during their first year of life. Other work included gear (e.g., trawl) development and monitoring the effectiveness of sea lamprey control.\n\nThe provincial government made the Laboratory for Experimental Limnology at Maple available for research by the University of Toronto’s Department of Zoology.\n\nA total of 2,421 commercial fishing licences were issued in Ontario. The commercial fishing industry employed 4,026 persons.\n\nHector H. MacKay was elected to a one-year term as president of the American Fisheries Society. He was the second of five Ontario residents to serve in that capacity.\n\n1948\n\nLake herring were introduced into Opeongo Lake in an attempt to improve the forage base for lake trout.\n\nThe term conservation officer was used to replace the term game warden or overseer.\n\nW. B. (Bev) Scott appointed as Curator of Ichthyology and Herpetology at the Royal Ontario Museum. This was the first museum in Canada to have a full time curator of ichthyology.\n\nThe first Canadian National Sportsmen Show (CNSS) was held. This non-profit corporation is Canada’s largest producer of outdoor events. Over the years, grants from CNS have supported numerous fisheries projects.\n\n1,450 ice huts were registered on Lake Simcoe.\n\nNylon gill nets were first used by commercial fishermen on Lake Huron. Nylon nets were found to be stronger and less expensive to maintain as well as increasing capture efficiency by a factor of two or three times when compared to linen or cotton.\n\nThe first sea lamprey control efforts were initiated in the Great Lakes.\n\nConstruction of several large scale dams, resulting in fish habitat destruction, commenced on the Ottawa River.\n\n1940s\n\nResults of fish stocking programs became more closely scrutinized. The provincial fish stocking policy was amended in the 1950s and a number of fish culture stations were subsequently closed.\n\nFisheries researchers refined the ability to age fish. This enabled the determination of year class strengths, the assessment of recruitment, and predictions on the health of the fishery.\n\nLake trout population in South Bay, Lake Huron, was extirpated.\n\nGeneral shift in emphasis from protection and conservation to scientific management.\n\nQueen’s University Biological Station (QUBS) was established on Lake Opinicon north of Kingston. The site has since been expanded to include a land base of more than 2,000 ha.\n\n1950\n\nExperimentation with splake (lake trout x brook trout hybrid) was initiated in Ontario. The selective breeding program was intended to develop a top predator to replace lake trout after their collapse in the Great Lakes. Although splake are no longer stocked in the Great Lakes they continue to provide angling opportunities in many inland lakes.\n\n1951\n\nTwenty-eight provincial fish culture stations were in operation.\n\n1952\n\nFirst experimentation with air dropping fish was conducted as a stocking technique for remote lakes in the Algoma district.\n\nSnagging was declared an unlawful means of capturing lake whitefish in the Ontario Fishery Regulations. Prior to this, it had been a popular activity in waters including Lake Simcoe.\n\n1953\n\nWhite perch were first reported in Lake Erie.\n\nA fisheries research station was established on Lake Erie at Wheatley.\n\nThere were a total of 34 permanent biologists on staff in the Fish and Wildlife Division of the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests\n\nFigure 19\n\nRepairing nets at the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests southern research station at Maple (Ontario Department of Lands and Forests photo).\n\n1954\n\nThe provincial minimum size limit of fifteen inches (38 cm) on walleye was removed. A 14 inch (35.6 cm) minimum size limit was reinstituted in Lanark and Leeds Counties (Division 10) in the early 1960s. That size limit was removed in 2008.\n\nThe first operating year under a federal-provincial agreement for fisheries research and lamprey control on the Great Lakes.\n\nAlewife were first reported in Lake Superior (Scott and Crossman 1973).\n\nSurveys were conducted on Goose Creek (near Fort Severn) to evaluate the potential of establishing pink salmon or chum salmon to provide a commercial fishery for the local inhabitants. Chum salmon eggs were obtained from the Samish State hatchery, Washington, and reared at the Port Arthur hatchery. Pink salmon eggs were obtained from the Skeena River, British Columbia. Eggs and fry were subsequently planted but the project was a failure (Reynolds 1964, Nunan 1967).\n\nHurricane Hazel, a 100 year storm, flooded much of southern Ontario destroying dams and barriers on many Great Lakes tributaries.\n\n1955\n\nThe Great Lakes Fishery Convention was signed and ratified establishing the Great Lakes Fishery Commission.\n\nWinter ice fishing was banned in Algonquin Park.\n\nThe federal government passed the Fisheries Improvement Loans Act to facilitate credit to fishermen to purchase vessels, repair gear, etc.\n\n1956\n\nThe Great Lakes Fishery Commission (GLFC) was organized and assumed its duties as set forth in the Convention. The Commission had two basic mandates: (i) initiate and coordinate sea lamprey control, and (ii) improve management of fish stocks of common concern.\n\nPink salmon were inadvertently introduced into Lake Superior from the Current River fish hatchery at Thunder Bay. Although first maturing at two years of age similar to their Pacificparents they soon adapted to also spawn at ages 1 and 3 thereby producing an annual spawning run. After an initial population explosion in Lake Superior their abundance eventually declined to a low but constant level. Pink salmon eventually spread throughout the Great Lakes from this single release (Kwain and Lawrie 1981).\n\nThe 86th annual meeting of the American Fisheries Society held in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nRemoval of a provincial size limit on bass.\n\nThe Fort Frances walleye and whitefish hatchery was closed.\n\n1957\n\nThe Fisheries Research Board of Canada was established from the former Biological Board of Canada.\n\nResponsibility for pollution control was transferred to the newly established Ontario Water Resources Commission.\n\nA new experimental fishing permit was introduced to be issued to commercial fishermen wishing to experiment with new forms of gear not otherwise provided for by regulation.\n\nThe lampricide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) was developed for sea lamprey control.\n\nThe Glenora fish hatchery near Picton was converted to a fisheries research station. J. W. (Jack) Christie, biologist, was placed in charge of the fisheries research program.\n\nFour hundred smallmouth bass were successfully transported by air to Sweden.\n\nGreat Lakes Power Corporation (GLPC) commenced construction on the Cat Falls hydro development project at Whitefish Lake on the Michipicoten River system.\n\nThe majority of Lake Erie commercial fishermen withdrew from the Ontario Fisheries Council and formed the Lake Erie Fisheries Council.\n\n1958\n\nRiver-run strain lake trout from Lake Superior were introduced into three inland lakes (Mishibishu, Mishi and Katzenbach) on the north shore of Lake Superior (Harrison 1970). This served to establish a lake trout population in these waters which was subsequently used as a source of brood stock in the provincial fish culture program.\n\nLarge scale stocking efforts were initiated on Lake Superior to rehabilitate lake trout.\n\nThe federal Sea Lamprey Control Program, using the selective lampricide TFM, was initiated on Lake Superior followed by Lake Michigan (1960), Lake Huron (1966) and Lake Ontario (1971).\n\nThe Moses-Saunders Dam hydroelectric construction project was completed on the St. Lawrence River. The impoundment behind the dam is known as Lake St. Lawrence. Several villages were relocated and the Long Sault Rapids, an important spawning area, was flooded.\n\nThe Bayfield-Goderich Commercial Fishermen’s Association was formed. The first president was J. McMillan.\n\nThe first experimental efforts were undertaken to use trawls in Lake Erie. In 1960, 6 million pounds of smelt were taken by trawl. By 1962, the Central Lake Erie Trawlers Association had been formed.\n\nE. McAllister was appointed as the first full time curator of fishes at the National Museum of Canada in Ottawa.\n\nFigure 20\n\nRaising a trawl on a Lake Erie tug (Department of Fisheries and Oceans photo).\n\n1959\n\nThe Patricia fisheries inventory project was initiated to document lake characteristics and fisheries populations in that part of northwestern Ontario. The project concluded in 1965.\n\nThe first concrete fishway in Ontario was constructed at the Mill Dam on the Sydenham River in Owen Sound. Today, there are at more than forty fish passage facilities in Ontario (Appendix 8).\n\nA federal-provincial agreement was signed to delineate federal-provincial responsibilities with respect to fisheries management. The federal government assumed responsibility for sea lamprey control and general fisheries research on Lake Superior while the provincial government became responsible for general fisheries research and collection of routine fisheries statistics on Lakes Huron, Erie, and Ontario.\n\nFish and Wildlife Division was renamed as Fish and Wildlife Branch in the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests.\n\nThe St. Lawrence Seaway officially opened. The Seaway facilitated traffic of ocean freighters opening up a shipping route of approximately 3,700 km to Lake Superior at the heart of North America.\n\nThe Lake Erie Fisheries Research Advisory Committee was formed to review research programs and improve communications with clients.\n\nThe Ontario legislature passed the Wilderness Areas Act under which the government could set aside tracts of land as wilderness reservations in which public entry was strictly prohibited.\n\n1950s\n\nLake trout were extirpated in Lakes Michigan, Ontario, and Erie, nearly extirpated in Lake Huron, and present at low levels of abundance in Lake Superior.\n\nExplosion in numbers of American smelt in Lake Erie. Trawling was initiated as a harvest technique.\n\nCollapse of lake whitefish in the Bay of Quinte.\n\n1950s-1960s\n\nReproductive failures and population declines observed in fish-eating birds (gulls, cormorants, herons, eagles, terns, etc.) in the Great Lakes attributed to pollutants and contaminants.\n\n1960\n\nLake Erie, much of Lake Ontario and areas of Lake Huron had become eutrophic with noxious algal growths, fish kills, and anoxia.\n\nC. H. D. Clarke was appointed as Chief of Fish and Wildlife Branch succeeding the late Dr. Harkness. H. H. MacKay was the supervisor of Fisheries Section. MacKay’s direction included the principle of sustained yield, integrated land use planning, and promotion of public use of natural resources.\n\nThere was a notable decline in walleye abundance in the Bay of Quinte.\n\nA major fish kill, evident after ice-o"
