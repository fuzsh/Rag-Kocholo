        "text": "Ray-Finned Fish\n\nThis page was born 12/02/2009. Rickubis designed it. (such as it is.) Last update: 04/15/2022\n\nImages and contents on this page copyright ©2002-2022 Richard M. Dashnau\n\nGo back to my home page,Welcome to rickubis.com\n\nGo back to the RICKUBISCAM page.\n\nFish are also part of nature, but most of the time we don't interact with them. Sometimes, I've been surprised by very interesting fish doing very interesting things, and I'm\n\ngathering them on this page. Sharks are fish, of course, but they are in a different group. Fish on these pages are defined by having a skeleton composed of rigid bone.\n\nSharks and their relatives have skeletons made of cartilage. I've put them on a different page.\n\n06/05/2021 (posted 6/13/21) I visit Fiorenza Park frequently . It's pretty close to home, it covers 362 acres, it has about 6 miles of trails and a wonderful collection of wildlife.\n\nThe weather was nice, and the high water was apparently enough to induce some Gar to spawn. I could see one group of gar moving along the surface, and I tried to capture some video\n\nor photos of them when they gulped air, or came up to the surface. The water was murky as usual, so I couldn't see much below the surface. But, I watched them swim over submerged\n\nportions of sidewalk, and over the low footbridge. I didn't get good photos, and even the frames from the video didn't work well...but some of the video clips came out ok. I came to realize\n\nthat there were more than two fish involved--in fact there might have been 3 or 4 fish following the leader. I got only a few quick looks at them from the top--but when I did I saw a really broad\n\nsnout. I'm pretty sure that I was watching Alligator Gar (Atractosteus spatula)! Examine the video clip (mp4) to see them in action. It's possible that these are Shortnose Gar (Lepisosteus\n\nplatostomus), but that broad head makes me think otherwise. When water temperature and depth is right, gar swim over flooded areas and deposit stick eggs on vegetation. The males\n\nwhich are swimming behind, fertilize the eggs. That's what these gar seemed to be doing.\n\nFIRST VIEW, SWIMMING TAIL FINS SHOWING GETING AIR--LOOK AT THE TEETH! MORE TEETH\n\nBIG TAIL ON THE LEFT, FOLLOWED BY SMALLER BROAD SNOUT VISIBLE ONE MORE BREAKING SURFACE\n\n03/06/2021 I visited Fiorenza Park North to get more images to document the \"fish kill\" from the Big Freeze of Feb.14-20, 2021. I was also hoping to find the \"eel\" carcass\n\nI mentioned in a previous post but it was gone. The images below were taken along a 200-foot(approximately) long stretch of shorline on the North edge of the South lake\n\nat the park. Try this link and it should show a Google map view of the area. Google Map Link. Most (if not all) of the carcasses seem to be of armored catfish (Loricariids) of various sizes.\n\nSince they are of various sizes, I believe that this show that mostly these species were affected, and that this isn't some kind of arrangement caused by size. On the other hand,\n\nother carcasses might have been easier to consume than these armored ones, so might have been carried off. I believe I've seen live examples of Hypostomus plecostomus and\n\nPterygoplichthys anisitsi at this park, so the carcasses could be at least one of those. Clicking on an image will open it larger in a new window.\n\nCarcass by my size-11 foot Black Vultures still picked at the carcasses.\n\nB.Vulture (Coragyps atratus) in a pile. Closer view of one pile.\n\nStitched panorama of close view of one pile.\n\nI shot these four progressive views to capture the extend of the carcass field--and this was just one part of the coverage.\n\nThis is a camera-built panorama just a bit further West. Fish carcasses were scattered everywhere.\n\n03/04/2021 I visited Fiorenza Park North again, It's not too far from home. I'm not sure, but I think the water level has dropped since my last visit.\n\nToday, I discovered that the armored catfish (various species?) apparently did not come through the freeze even unscathed. There were many dead ones\n\nscattered around the shoreline. There were many different sizes. Maybe they had died during the freeze but their carcasses had been hidden by deeper water.\n\nThey were certainly visible today!\n\n5 in this picture. Two of those 5, closer. At least 10 in this picture. A closer view, some are submerged.\n\nAnd there are more. I couldn't get closer to these big ones.Two more, and something very interesting!\n\nI noticed the uncommon carcass floating near the bank. I was able to get it on land, and I took photos of it. I could think of two \"tube-shaped\" animals\n\nthat it might have been. One is an amphibian, and one is a reptile. I took my pictures of details that I thought would help me identify the animal. As the pictures\n\nbelow will show, the carcass had been partially-eaten, and was also decomposing. So, what could it be?\n\nCarcass is in pretty bad shape.My foot next to the carcass for scale. There's a quarter near the head Here's a look at the skin. It isn't smoooth.\n\nA look a bit closer. Are those scales?Pectoral area behind the head is chewed offThe head, no external gills. Some small teeth show, not hooked.\n\nOne of the animals that have a similar shape is a snake. Let's compare with some pictures of Diamondback Watersnakes (Nerodia rhombifer) that I've taken in the past within a few yards\n\nof where I found this carcass. The carcass has no color pattern--even if it doesn't match this snake, it doesn't match any others, either. The scales on the carcass are the wrong size and shape-\n\nfor this snake, and just about any other local snake. Can't see on the two snake pictures, but the carcass has NO large belly scales. The few teeth visible in the skull are wrong for a snake, too.\n\na snakes teeth are thin, sharp like needles, and the tips curve backwards. I couldn't see any eyes on the carcass, so can't really compare those. The pictures don't show it well, but the tail\n\nof the carcass was flattened vertically. No local species of snake have a tail that's flattened so that it pushes well--like an alligator's tail, or a tadpole.... And that brings up the second animal\n\nthat I thought it could possibly be.\n\nThat other animal is an amphibian. No, not a tadpole. A large salamander that lives in Texas (I've seen them at Brazos Bend State Park) called a Siren, or usually, a Lesser Siren. (Siren\n\nintermedia). Sirens can grow to 2 feet long (60.96 cm). There are two pictures above of one in the jaws of a Great Blue Heron. They do have a flattened tail. But they are totally smooth, and\n\nthey have two small front legs. The carcass doesn't show legs, but they could have been torn off where that damage is. Sirens also have large, exposed branching gills on the sides of their\n\nhead. There are none here. I really doubt that the carcass was a Siren, also. So, what does that leave us? How about an American Eel? I think that this was the carcass of an American Eel\n\n(Anguilla rostrata). They do live here, and I've found at least one report online of one being caught in Brays Bayou. I've never seen one in the wild in Texas (or anywhere else).\n\n01/13/2018 and 01/20/2018. Various species of the \"tropical fish\" known as Plecostomus have become established in Texas waters. They are considered invasive and\n\ndestructive. Since they have been living in these waters, it's reasonable to assume that they have survived winters here. However, over the last few weeks (specifically\n\nfrom January 12 to January 20) we've had especially cold weather. During the first week there were about 4 days of temperatures around 30 degrees F. And during\n\nthe second week we had about 4 days near 20 degrees F. While I was visiting Archbishop Fiorenza Park on the 13th, I noticed many dead Plecostomus along the banks\n\nof the lake. On the 20th, most of the carcasses were gone from where I'd seen them, but I did see Black Vultures eating a few. I assume that the cold weather killed them.\n\nThe pictures of the dead fish are from the 13th. I've taken a picture of my foot near some of the carcasses for scale (shoe size 11). The pictures of the vulture\n\nare frame grabs from a short video clip. And the video is here. (NOTE 7/19/2020): The fish in the pictures below are probably Pterygoplichthes species--but still armored catfish.)\n\n11/9/2015 Since my investigation of the breaching fish, I've been looking through older video footage and photos of gar that I've filmed over the years. I've found a number of video clips\n\nshowing gar (mostly Spotted Gar)gulping air. In all the older material, including the Alligator gar I filmed this year, the breaching is not as active as it seemed to be in the video that I shot in\n\nSeptember and October of this year. I've added them to this page, but put them the chronological order of the rest of the page. In the slow video, I can see a consistent process which seems\n\nto take the 3 steps I've also described further down the page:\n\n1) The end of the jaws extend out of the water and open briefly (perhaps with slight opening of gill slits,).\n\n2) The jaws and head extend further out of the water, and the jaws and gills slits open at the same time. A large quantity of gas is expelled from the gills slits, making large bubbles.\n\n3) The head submerged, the gar begins to sink. The gill slits open, and a small amount of gas is expelled making a small stream of bubbles.\n\nAt this time, I don't know exactly what is going on.\n\n09/13/2015--10/11/2015 For some time this summer, fish have been \"hitting\" the surface of the water in various parts of the park. I'd been watching this\n\nactivity near the Spillway Trail. There was a lot of fish hitting the surface in Pilant Slough, from the Spillway west to the\n\nObservation Tower (distance about 900 feet, according to Google Maps). I had assumed that most of the fish hitting the surface were Bowfin, and possibly Gar.\n\nI've observed both gar and bowin breathing air at BBSP before, and at those times, the breaching was relatively sedate.\n\n*These* breaches were violent, sometimes spraying water for a wide area. And the activity brought many alligators there to hunt the fish.\n\nI started watching more closely starting in September, where I determined that the fish seemed not to be hunting.\n\nHowever, the water was usually obscured by glare or by murkiness, so I could not tell what kind of fish were surfacing. I was nearby when fisherman successfully caught\n\nboth bowfin ( Amia Calva) *and* gar (both spotted (Lepisosteus oculatus) and shortnosed(Lepisosteus platostomus).\n\nBOWFIN SHORTNOSE GAR\n\nIt seemed likely that these fish were the culprits, but I wanted to be sure. So, I started trying to capture high-speed video of the breaching events.\n\nIf I could capture an event at 210 frames per second, then I could play it back slower to identify the fish. This was\n\na bit difficult, but after 5 weekends (9/13/15 - 10/11/15), I caught enough video clips to make some identification. I've put these all together into one 5-minute clip.\n\nI was able to identify bowfin in some of the clips. Most obvious identity key was the long dorsal fin, but the large blunt head and small pectoral fins were secondary keys.\n\nSome of the other fish were gar; easily identifiable by the long, thin snout. The clip is in 2 formats here(wmv) and here (mp4) The animated gifs were made with frames\n\nfrom the video.\n\nBOWFIN BOWFIN PLECOSTOMUS?\n\nBut, I saw a fish in a few of the clips that I believe was neither a gar nor a bowfin. The fish were usually dark, with a rounded head, but the pectoral and\n\npelvic fins were very large-much larger than on a bowfin and closer together than those on a gar. The 3rd gif above shows this fish.\n\nI believe that these fish are examples of plecostomus! I have found carcasses of plecostomus near some of our local bodies of water.\n\nHere's a picture of one that I took near Buffalo Bayou in 2009.\n\nAnd here is a picture of a live one that I filmed today at a local pet shop.\n\nFrom some research online, I have found that \"plecostomus\" can refer to anumber of different species of fish. They are also known to surface periodically to \"gulp air\",\n\npossibly for bouyancy control. I haven't seen anything that shows they use the oxygen. Gar and Bowfin are related, and both have lungs. In some of the literature I've read, these are called\n\ntrue lungs.\n\nIn AIR-BREATHING DURING ACTIVITY IN THE FISHES AMIA CALVA AND LEPISOSTEUS OCULATUS C. G. FARMER* AND D. C. JACKSON\n\nAccepted 19 January; published on WWW 5 March 1998 it is stated that lungs appeared in fish *before* swim bladders. (p.943) ;\n\nDuring low-level exercise, more than 50% of oxygen used by both species came from the air. Bowfin and Spotted gar.(p. 945)\n\nand on P.947 Increasing temperature increases the rate of air-breathing in bowfin. Spotted gar also increase air-breathing with temp.\n\nAir breathing may be more important to support activity than surviving in hypoxic water. The fish CAN get O2 from air\n\nif there is none in the water, but this situation happens less than the need driven by activity.\n\nIn EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE AND LIGHT ON AERIAL BREATHING BEHAVIOR OF THE SPOTTED GAR,LEPISOSTEUS OCULATUS by\n\nGERARDUS C. DE ROTH THE OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE 73(1): 34, January, 1973.\n\nFreshwater gars gulp air at the surface even at the highest levels of dissolved Oxygen.Page 38.\n\nIn another study, gar were obligate air breathers at oxygen lower than 4.5 ppm but active gar were obligatory air breathers at higher oxygen concentrations. So, rising temperatures could\n\nalso cause more\n\nsurface breathing. p39 (By definition water is hypoxic if it doesn't have enough O2 to support life (< 2ppm) http://toxics.usgs.gov/definitions/hypoxia.html\n\nNormal is 8-10 ppm (parts per million)\n\nMay 24, 2015-- We'd been getting rain, and water levels have been good at the park. Since it was wet this morning, I decided to drive down to Elm Lake. When I drove over the floodgate\n\nat the end of Pilant Slough, I looked to my right--at where spillway that empties into Big Creek. What I saw there made me turn around, go back to the parking lot at the VC, and return with my\n\ncamera. The concrete spillway empties into a gully, which empties after curving about 300 yards into Big Creek, which flows past and continues out past Hale Lake and eventually into the\n\nBrazos River. But, at the spillway, the water is relatively calm, and today it acted as a sort of \"lagoon\". And there, in the calm water of this lagoon, a large number of gar were swimming\n\naround. From time-to-time, the gar would come to the surface and--with a quick up-and-down of their head--gulp air. I estimate that most of the gar swimming around were 12 to 18 inches\n\nlong. We have at least 3 species of gar in the park--Short-Nosed Gar, Spotted Gar, and Alligator Gar. I was going to try to see if I could see any Alligator Gar among those in the collection.\n\nAlligator Gar are separated from most other species of gar by a few physical differences. One of these (and not easily seen) is the *double* rows of teeth in their jaws. The other, is the\n\nbroad, rounded shape to their snout. This broad head resembles that of an Alligator--which is a reason for the common name. But, it is also described in their taxonomic name-Atractosteus\n\nspatula (nose broad and flat). I watched in fascination as the gar moved about. I tried a few times to capture photos or video of them coming to the surface, so I could get a view of the top\n\nof their heads. It was hard to get these views because the dark water prevented sighting of a gar until just before it broke the surface. I wondered if I'd be able to identify an Alligator Gar\n\namong these foot-and-a-half long fish. But, before too long, I had my answer. Through the circular ripples of the moving fish, I saw a looming lighter shape under the water. It made its way to\n\nthe surface like a submarine, and then broke the surface. As the head came up, water gushed out from the gill slits on each side. Then the mouth opened, closed, and submerged. The fish\n\nleisurely followed, and took a while to fully submerge. The head was at least 8 inches long...JUST THE HEAD. I'd found an alligator gar! Did I have the camera ready? NO.\n\nHowever, I continued watching. The large gar were there among the others, and as time passed, I saw them surface many times. I have no way of knowing if I was seeing the same Alligator\n\ngar...or the same few gars. But some of them were immense. I could not get close to the water, to get any certain measurement, but I think some of the gar could have been around 8 feet long.\n\nI spent most of the day in that spot, watching those fish. I knew that this was a transitory, and relatively rare event (we rarely get water that high, in that spot), so I decided to make the most of it.\n\nI shot many pictures, and short clips, trying to capture some images of those huge fish...and trying to get some footage that could give some sense of how large they were.\n\nI didn't see anything that looked like feeding behavior. I didn't see any chasing, I didn't see any \"bait\" fish. I *did* see what seemed to be gar swimming in pairs--and a few times one surfaced,\n\nand another surfaced right behind it. All the splashing and activity finally attracted our other large aquatic predator--the Alligator Gar's namesake. An alligator appeared from Big Creek. It\n\nwas about 8 feet long, and moved leisurely towards the spillway. It encountered a stick about 5 feet long, and just pushed it along.I happened to be shooting video, trying to get some scale to\n\nthe scene. As I was filming, the alligator suddenly leapt up and forward. It had gone for one of the surfacing gar, but missed. The alligator moved back among the wooded cover, and I lost sight\n\nof it. I watched the gar until it was time to go home. I've made two short video clips from some of the footage. This clip was edited from footage shot at normal speed (30fps). The alligator\n\nalso appears in it: Alligator Gar 05242015 (mp4 format) The second clip is made from footage shot at 120 fps, and played back at 30; for slow-motion. These show the Alligator Gar\n\ngulping air at the surface. Unfortunately for me, while the camera was adjusted to lower light to \"see\" the fish under the surface; when the fish came out of the water, it was overexposed\n\nphotographically. I tried to adjust this with software. The slow motion clip is: Alligator Gar 05242015 slow (mp4 format)\n\nI'd never encountered anything like an Alligator Gar until a dead one appeared in the spillway (not the same spillway we have now, but in the same spot) in 2002. I was able to salvage the\n\nskull from that fish, and I used it to prepare the exhibit that's in the Visitor's Center now. That skull was about 12 inches long, from snout tip, to the rear of the head. The carcass-when I finally\n\nfound it-was as long as one of our John Deere gators; about 8 1/2 feet long. Since 2002, many things have changed. The internet has changed, and perception of the Alligator Gar has\n\nchanged. The story of the gar in 2002 can be seen on further down on this page. Alligator Gar (Atractosteus spatula) have been a reviled, misunderstood species through much of its natural\n\nrange. So much so, that its natural range has dwindled over the years. Texas is one of the few states with a remaining healthy population of Alligator Gar, and TPWD has been studing this\n\nfascinating creature to better understand it. That wasn't the case in the 1930's when a man named J.G. Burr created \"The Electrical Gar Destroyer\" and began using it in various bodies of\n\nwater. Others emulated him, and thousands of gar were killed (from what I could find, there is no mention of how many other animals died along with them). But, things have taken a turn for\n\nthe better, and now much more is known about them. One important fact is that it can take 40 years for a gar to grow to 8 feet long. Another is that Alligator Gar can only spawn when certain\n\ncircumstances occur: there must be ground flooding, and the temperature must be correct (at least 68degrees). I believe that I was watching courtship or spawning today--especially when a\n\npair of gar would surface. As I mentioned, Alligator Gar have 2 rows of teeth in their upper jaws, with the 2nd row in the roof of their mouth. They have a \"vascularized\" swim bladder--which\n\nthey can use to collect air and then get oxygen from it. Their skeletal system has a combination of bone and cartilagenous features--a sort of crossover from skeletons of sharks and those of\n\ntrue \"bony\" fish. Gar are covered with thick, strong ganoid scales. They are opportunistic predators, and hunt many types of smaller prey, but most often eat \"forage fish\" like gizzard shad.\n\nClaims that they decimate populations of game fish (such as bass) have turned out to be unfounded. Ongoing genetic studies have shown Alligator Gar to be most closely related to Bowfin\n\n(Amia calva).--which ALSO live here in the park. Alligator Gar are not only big, but very unique fish. And....they are just one of the creatures that live here in our park. And I got to watch a\n\ngroup of them swimming freely right here.\n\nHere are some good links to information about Alligator Gar:\n\nThis article in Texas Parks magazine: http://www.tpwmagazine.com/archive/2015/mar/ed_3_gar/index.phtml\n\nThe general description on the TPWD site: https://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/species/alg/\n\nand another page here: http://www.fishesoftexas.org/taxon/atractosteus-spatula\n\nThere are many other pages, but these were related to fish in Texas.\n\nJuly 24, 2011 (added 11/09/2015) And another week later, and the Spotted Gar are still moving around. I continued shooting high-speed video, hoping to catch some hunting activity.\n\nI still didn't see any. I did get another clip of breathing. I've manipulated this clip to show how quickly this happens, and also to slow it even more.\n\nThe 10 images below are frame grabs from this video clip.\n\nJuly 17, 2011 (added 11/06/2015) A week later, and the Spotted Gar are still moving around. I continued shooting high-speed video, hoping to catch some hunting activity.\n\nBut, I didn't see any. I did get a few more clips of them breathing. This seems to be a 3-step process. First, the tips of the jaws break the surface and open briefly.\n\nNext, air is expelled from the gill slits--usually in large bubbles. Then most of the head breaks the surface, and the jaws open and close again before the head\n\nsubmerges. As the gar sinks after this, a small trickle of bubbles leaks from the gill slits. the 10 images below are frame grabs from this video clip, which shows 2 surfacing events.\n\nJuly 10, 2011 (added 11/03/2015) Gar and Bowfin are distantly related, and both can breathe air. On this day, I was able to see Spotted Gar (Lepisoseus Oculatus) and\n\nBowfin swimming near each other. The three images below are frame grabs from this video clip. The gar gulps air once in the clip.\n\nMay 3, 2009 (added 10/31/2015)(updated 1/21/21) I watched this gar swimming in Elm Lake, and was able to film it taking a gulp of air--at 210 frames per second. The images below are frame grabs\n\nfrom this video clip(mp4) This is how I usually see gar coming up for air. They slowly approach the surface, then tilt their jaws out of the water, open them-then air seems to flush through\n\nthe gill slits, and the gar slowly sinks under.\n\nNovember 10, 2002The image below (BOWFIN) is of an interesting \"primitive\" fish called a \"Bowfin\".\n\nThe water at the park got very high. In fact the nearby Big Creek was so filled that the water from Pilant Slough, which normally flows out of the park, was flowing back INTO the park from Big\n\nCreek. As evidence of the amount of water we received, here it the fishing pier on Hale Lake, the deck of which usually stays at least 10 feet above water level (see HALE LAKE PIER,\n\nbelow). This happened for about 2 days, until the water level dropped in Big Creek . As the water started flowing back out of Pilant Slough, other bodies of water were free to drain. 40 Acre\n\nlake started flowing back under the footbridge, and a few predatory fish stationed themselves in the sluggish flow. Among them were a few Bowfin, and a few Spotted Gar (see image below).\n\nThese fish were about 15 inches long. It is interesting to me that these \"primitive\" fish both inhabit the park, right along with various perch, sunfish and bass. Of course, let's not forget the\n\nAlligator Gar! The image below (HEAD AND SPINE) shows my completed gar as it is now.\n\n--- -\n\nBOWFIN SPOTTED GAR GAR HEAD AND SPINE HALE LAKE PIER\n\nOctober 20, 2002A rather cool, wet weekend. However, on Sunday, some alligators showed themselves right after the sun finally came through the clouds. On Saturday, we had the\n\nVolunteer Picnic at the park. During this, I'm proud to say, I received an award for \"Outstanding Volunteer\" from the Brazos Bend State Park Volunteer's Organization. Apparently, this was\n\ndue to votes cast by a number of volunteers. Thanks, everyone! I have a great time doing things at the park, and then I GET AWARDED FOR IT! Is that great, or WHAT? The image below\n\nmiddle (RICKUBIS LIKES FISH) shows some older guy, Rickubis(yes, that's me), attempting to reconstruct the spine of a very large Alligator Gar--on the dining room table. In fact, this is the\n\nsame gar I've talked about before. So far, I've gone out on three occasions to dig and scrape and find these vertebrae. So far, I've found about 48. I'm not sure how many more there might be,\n\nbut I can't seem to find any more. I'm sure I have a large part of it. The spine I can reconstruct is about 48 inches ,or 4 feet long. The image below right (LONG SPINE) shows what I have so far.\n\nAdd the length of the head, about 20 inches, and I have 68 inches of a 96-inch long fish accounted for. I have no idea of the length of the tail spines, nor the distance between vertebrae. I'll see\n\nif I can get a count of how many there are supposed to be.\n\n---\n\nFRONT VIEW ------------- RICKUBIS LIKES FISH------------- ---------------LONG SPINE\n\nSeptember 24, 2002This series of pictures show the construction of the display for the Alligator Gar skull. (pictures added 6/3/2015).\n\n- - -\n\n- - -\n\n- - -\n\nMay 05, 2002Tuesday, April 23, I got to the park around 8:00 am. I hadn't been on the trail 10 minutes (I started at the 40-Acre Lake parking lot), when I encountered a copperhead stretched\n\nacross the trail near Hoot's Hollow. I was able to take a few pictures before it got bored with me and continued across the trail.(COPPERHEAD, below) Notice the coloration of the scales\n\nand the shape of the head. Also, the nostril is the small opening at the tip of its nose. You might notice another opening between the nostril and the eye. This pit is what gives \"pit vipers\" their\n\nname. It's a heat sensor, and aids the snake in stalking food. Copperheads are poisonous, and as stated in signs throughout Brazos Bend State Park, \"POISONOUS SNAKES EXIST IN\n\nTHIS PARK\". The snakes belong in the park. Humans are only visitors there. Visitors should keep a close eye on their children and pets while they are in the park, for this reason.\n\nApril 07, 2002 Kind of a quiet day today. More storm weather was due in our area. However, this morning, I was allowed to join David, one of the Park Naturalists, and we took a quick\n\nsurvey of some recently-deceased park denizens. Among them was the huge gar that I've shown pictures of here, which I'd first encountered on March 17. I'd wanted to do a quick dissection\n\nof the gar to determine what it might have eaten, but was unable to find it until today; much too late for this. Making the best of the situation, I was able to take some more pictures that showed\n\nhow large the gar is. Yes, that is a John Deere Gator in the picture below (By the Gator), next to the gar. I also took a few pictures of the skull. (MY FOOT (below)) and (TEETH (below)).\n\nThose teeth are sharp!\n\n-- - - -\n\n-BY THE GATOR------ ------MY FOOT-M ----- --------TEETH COPPERHEAD-\n\nMarch 17, 2002They were draining the Pilant Slough, and as the water level receded, aquatic creatures were trapped in waning pools of water. The alligators evidently capitalized on this turn\n\nof events, and rested on the newly-exposed banks near the observation tower in great numbers. See (lots of gators) below. Then, on the low end of the Slough, where the water was exiting\n\nthe floodgate, a large fish got caught in the concrete breakwater. This was an alligator gar. See the images below. The first shot shows it as it was found. I tried to move this fish, but I was only\n\nable to expose its head, which had been crushed. Note the size of the concrete uprights. I'm standing on, and you'll get an idea of the scale of this fish. It was HUGE.\n\n- - -\n\n--- LOTS OF GATORS---- ---GAR AS IT WAS FOUND- ---MY FOOT BY THE HEAD---- ------THE HEAD------------\n\nTHE ENTIRE FISH\n\nThe Alligator Gar's Story:\n\nIn March of 2002, the floodgate at the bottom of Pilant Slough, near the Nature Center, was opened. This was done to drain the slough so that the floodgate could be repaired. Sometime\n\nafter this, a number of people noticed a huge fish caught in the breakwater at the floodgate opening. Here is the fish as it appeared on March 17, 2002.\n\n-- - -\n\nGAR AS IT WAS FOUND--- -MY FOOT BY THE HEAD-- --------THE HEAD------- -----THE ENTIRE FISH\n\nThe fish is an Alligator Gar (Lepisosteus spatula). Note that each one of those concrete ?teeth? in the floodgate is about one foot across. The gar was removed and dragged out to a remote\n\nlocation in the park. Alligator Gars will eat other fish, though it is reported that they will sometimes take waterfowl. It?s very likely that a gar will eat anything that it can catch, including turtles\n\nand smaller alligators. Unfortunately, too much time had passed before this gar could be examined to allow dissection for viewing its stomach contents. It should be noted here that most\n\npopular game fish, like Largemouth Bass, are generally too vigorous for the Alligator Gar to catch. Some time later, the condition of the gar was checked. The plan was to allow various park\n\nscavengers to clean the carcass. Here are other pictures of the gar, taken April 7, 2002.\n\n-- - -\n\n--- -BY THE GATOR------ ------MY FOOT-M ----- --------TEETH\n\nThe gar is pictured near one of the John Deere Gators used by Brazos Bend State Park. The gar did not break down easily for a number of reasons. A hot, dry summer and the heavy scales\n\ncovering the body probably prevented effective scavenging of the carcass. On April 23, Park Volunteer Rick Dashnau salvaged the head and developed this project. The gar?s head was\n\nkept in the specimen freezer for some weeks while Rick and the Park Naturalists tried to figure out how best to clean it. What made cleaning this prize so difficult was its size. It barely fits into\n\na five-gallon bucket! On August 7, a small cage was built (to prevent larger scavengers from disturbing the head), and the head was placed in an ant nest for further cleaning. Finally, the skull\n\nwas clean enough to work with. Rick Dashnau was able to finish cleaning and preparing the skull, and also able to build the case to display it on September 24, 2002.\n\nI'll note here that we measured one of these John Deer gators today. It was 8.5 feet long! Also, here are four more pictures of the Alligator Gar. The first one (ANT CAGE) shows the cage I\n\nbuilt for the head so I could place it in an ant nest. The next two (STILL NOT, and 12 INCHES) show the head after the last treatment; a week long bath in a solution of 1 gallon bleach/4 gallons\n\nwater. This was before I stripped off the remaining flesh. The measurement is from the end of the snout to approximately the center of the eye socket. These were taken on September 19th...\n\nthe same day as my images of the 3-fanged Cottonmouth. The next two (SIDE VIEW, FRONT VIEW) are of the gar's head as we first displayed it. We placed it on top of the display featuring\n\nthe skeleton of an 8-foot long alligator. What I can't stop thinking about is the image of this huge prehistoric fish stalking the waters of the park--as large and as voracious as a good-sized\n\nalligator!\n\n- - -\n\n08/07/02 ANT CAGE 8STILL....NOT QUITE 12 INCHES TIP TO EYE SIDE VIEW\n\nThe gar is pictured near one of the John Deere Gators used by Brazos Bend State Park.
