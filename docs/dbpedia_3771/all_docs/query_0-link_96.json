        "text": "Toadfish of the Florida Panhandle\n\nThis is a group of fish that few have heard of and many have not seen – or if they saw them, had NO idea what they were – but they a very common in our local waters… the toadfish.\n\nOnce you see one, you will know why they call it this. Recently we had a matching game set up for the public to try and match the name of a common seagrass animal with its photograph. The toadfish was one of 20 species on the board. Few knew what it was and most only matched it with the photo through a process of elimination. A common response was “well… this MUST be the toadfish”, though there were just as many who did not see the connection between the name and the look on this fish’s face.\n\nAll that said, they are very common here. Snorkeling in our bays I have found them hiding in burrows within the grassbeds, snug against a seawall, and in open spaces within a rock jetty. They are known to hide inside discarded cans and bottles, feeding and eventually growing to large to be able to leave!\n\nThey are known for their painful bites; I have personally experienced this. We have captured them when seining the grassbeds. Trying to remove them from the net they are very slimy and difficult to grab. If you get close to their mouth, they will use the teeth they have. Others have been bitten when exploring the inside of a can or bottle left on the bottom. Toadfish belong to the family Batrachoididae and some members of this family are highly venomous. However, of the three species found in the northern Gulf, only the midshipman (Porichthys porosissimus) possess venom, and it is not harmful to humans.\n\nI guess in a word you could say these are ugly fish – hence their name. They are all benthic and remain on the bottom at all times. Most of the swimming they do is to a new hiding place, where they ambush their prey. There are three species found in the northern Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe Atlantic Midshipman (Porichthys porosissimus) is a light tan colored fish with dark brown blotches along its side. Because of their light color, they are more common on light colored sand. The ones I have found are on the nearshore bottom of the Gulf side of our barrier island. They posses rows of photophores, cells that can produce light, and these rows of photophores resemble the rows of bright buttons on the 19th century midshipman’s naval uniform – hence their name. This fish has a mean length of eight inches. The midshipman has a more extensive range than the typical “Carolina” Gulf fish. They can be found from Virginia all the way to Argentina; beyond the Brazil limit most “Carolina” fish have. Though not reported on the other side of the Atlantic, nor the Pacific, this species seems to have few barriers impeding its dispersal.\n\nThe Leopard Toadfish (Opsanus pardus) is a larger toadfish reaching 12 inches. They too have a light-colored body with dark markings. It prefers reefs and rocky areas offshore. The only ones I have seen, or captured, were on our artificial reefs. It was noted early on in the lionfish invasion, that lionfish were not as numerous on reefs where leopard toadfish existed. This spawned a hypothesis that leopard toadfish may actually consume lionfish. A small study conducted at a local high school marine science program found that was not the case. I am not aware of any further studies on the relationship between these two, but it could be they just compete for space and the leopard toadfish wins some of these. Though not reported from Argentina, this species does have a large range – including the entire U.S. Atlantic seaboard, the entire Gulf of Mexico, and much of the Caribbean. Again, few barriers to their dispersal.\n\nThe most frequently encountered toadfish is the Gulf Toadfish (Opsanus beta) – also know as the oyster dog, dogfish, or mudfish. This is the largest of the native toadfish at 15 inches. It is most common inside our estuaries living on oyster reefs, burrows in seagrass beds, jetties, and any sunken debris such as pipes, concrete, or pilings. Because of its habitat choice, this toadfish is much darker in color, having some light bars or markings on its side. This is the species that is sometimes found in sunken bottles and cans. This is a Gulf species found throughout the Gulf of Mexico, and some portions of the West Indies, but absent from most of the Caribbean and the Atlantic coast where it is replaced by its close cousin Opsanus tau. There does seem to be a barrier near the Florida straits that impedes its dispersal east and north of the Gulf. There are two species on each side suggesting a long period of isolation from each other and no interbreeding. Again, there is a barrier there.\n\nI am not sure whether you have seen any of the local toadfish while snorkeling or diving. They are occasionally caught on rod and reel, but not often. However, now that you know about them, I am sure you will see one while out on the waters.\n\nReference\n\nHoese, H.D., R.H. Moore. 1977.

Pp. 327.\n\nCatfish of the Florida Panhandle\n\nCatfish…\n\nThere are a lot of fish found along the Florida panhandle that many are not aware of, but catfish are not one of them. Whether a saltwater angler who captures one of those slimy hardhead catfish to a lover of freshwater fried catfish – this is a creature most have encountered and are well aware of.\n\nGrowing up fishing along the Gulf of Mexico, the “catfish” was one of our nemesis. Slinging your cut-bait out on a line, if you were fishing near the bottom, you were likely to catch one of these. Reeling in a slimy barb-invested creature, they would swallow your bait well beyond the lip of their mouths and it would begin a long ordeal on how to de-hooked this bottom feeder that was too greasy to eat. Many surf fishermen would toss their bodies up on the beach with the idea that removing it would somehow reduce their population. Obviously, that plan did not work but ghost crabs will drag their carcasses over to their burrows where they would consume them and leave the head skull that gives this species of catfish it’s common name “hardhead” catfish, or “steelhead” catfish. This hard skull has bones whose shape remind you of Jesus being crucified and was sold in novelty stores as the “crucifix fish”.\n\nWhen I attended college in southeast Alabama a group of friends wanted to go out for fried catfish. I, knowing the above about saltwater catfish, replied “why?… no…, you don’t eat catfish”. They assured me you did and so off we went to a local restaurant who sold them. Fried catfish quickly became one of my favorites. A fried catfish sandwich with slaw and beans is something I always look forward to. At that time, I was not aware of the freshwater catfish, nor the catfish farms that produce much of the fish for my sandwiches. I now have also become aware of the method of catching freshwater catfish called “noodling” – which is not something I plan to take up.\n\nWorldwide, there are 36 families and about 3000 species of what are called catfish1. Most are bottom feeders with flatten heads to burrow through the substrate gulping their prey instead of biting it. Most possess “whiskers” – called barbels, which are appendages that can detect chemicals in the environment (smell or taste) helping them to detect prey that is buried or hard to find in murky waters. These barbels resemble whiskers and give them their common name “catfish”.\n\nThey lack scales, giving them the slimy feel when removing them from your hook, and also have a reduced swim bladder causing them to sink in the water – thus they spend much of their time on the bottom. The mucous of their skin helps in absorbing dissolved oxygen through the skin allowing them to live in water where dissolved oxygen may be too low for other types of fish1.\n\nThey are also famous for their serrated spines. Usually found on the dorsal and pectoral fins, these spines can be quite painful if stepped on, or handled incorrectly. Some species can produce a venom introduced when these spines penetrate a potential predator which have put some folks in the hospital1.\n\nThe size range of catfish is large; from about five inches to almost six feet. In North America, the largest captured was a blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus) at 130 pounds. The largest flathead catfish (Pylodictis olivaris) was 123 pounds. But the monster of this group is the Mekong catfish of southeast Asia weighing in at over 600 pounds.\n\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission lists six species of catfish in the Florida panhandle area. However, they are focusing on species that people like to catch2.\n\nThe Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) is found throughout Florida and also in many river systems of the eastern United States. It has found few barriers dispersing through these river systems. They are not typically bottom feeders having a more carnivorous diet.\n\nThe Flathead Catfish (Pylodictis olivaris) are relatively new to Florida and are currently reported in the Escambia and Apalachicola rivers. They prefer these slow-moving alluvial rivers.\n\nThe Blue Catfish (Ictalurus furcatus) were first reported in the Escambia and Yellow Rivers, there are now records of them in the Apalachicola. These catfish prefer faster moving rivers with sand/gravel bottoms and seem to concentrate towards the lower ends of major tributaries.\n\nThe White Catfish (Amerius catus) is found in rivers and streams statewide, and even in some brackish systems.\n\nThe Yellow Bullhead (Amerius natalis) are most often found in slow moving heavily vegetated systems like ponds, lakes, and reservoirs. It is reported to be more tolerant of poor water conditions.\n\nThe Brown Bullhead (Amerius nebulosus) live in similar conditions to the Yellow Bullhead.\n\nThe dispersal of freshwater catfish is interesting. How do they get from the Escambia to the Apalachicola Rivers without swimming into the Gulf and up new rivers? The answer most probably comes from small tributaries further upstream that can, eventually, connect them to a new river system. Scientists know that eggs deposited on the bottom can be moved by birds who feed in each of the systems carrying the eggs with them as they do. And you cannot rule out movement by humans, whether intentionally or accidentally.\n\nOn the saltwater side of things, there are two species – though the blue catfish has been reported in the upper portions of some estuaries in low salinities in the western Gulf of Mexico. The marine species are the hardhead catfish (Arius felis), sometimes known as the “steelhead” or the “sea catfish” – and the gafftop (Bagre marinus), also known as the gafftopsail catfish3.\n\nThe hardhead catfish is very familiar with anglers along the Gulf coast. This is the one I was referring to at the beginning of this article. It is considered inedible and a nuisance by most. They are common in estuaries and the shallow portions of the open sea from Massachusetts to Mexico. They are reported to have an average length of two feet, though most I have captured are smaller. Like many catfish, they possess serrated spines on their dorsal and pectoral fins. Their distribution seems to be limited by salinity.\n\nThe gafftop is also reported to have a mean length of two feet, and most that I have captured are closer to that. At one point in time, we were longlining for juvenile sharks in Pensacola Bay and caught numerous of these thinking they were small bull sharks as we pulled the lines in, until we saw the long barbels extending from them. I remember this being a very slimy fish, covered with mucous, and not fun to take off the hooks. It is reported to have good food value, though I have not eaten one. They differ from the hardheads mainly in their extended rays from the dorsal and pectoral fins. The habitat and range are similar to hardheads, though they have been reported as far south as Panama.\n\nThe diversity of freshwater catfish in the U.S. goes beyond what has been reported here. This group has been found on most continents and have been very successful. There are plenty of local catfish farms where you can try your luck, have them cleaned, and enjoy a good meal.\n\nReferences\n\n1 Catfish.

Pp. 327.\n\nThe Changing Climate; Part 4 (the Florida Panhandle)\n\nIn Part 2 and 3 of The Changing Climate we discussed some of the climate impacts of the last decade and some possible future ones. But this was on a global scale, what about the Florida and the panhandle? How will all of this affect us near home? We will take each of the issues mentioned and address them one by one.\n\nExtreme Weather Conditions\n\nThe western panhandle is considered one of the wetter locations in the United States – with a mean annual rainfall of 64.4 inches (mean for U.S. is 38.1 inches)1. One of the climate predictions is that wet places will become wetter. This appears to be the case for this area. The table below shows the total rainfall for Pensacola FL over the last 14 years. The mean annual rainfall for this period is 70.72 inches1. Currently for 2021 Pensacola is at 84.46 inches and it is raining as I type this. It will be another wet year.\n\nTotal Rainfall Pensacola FL\n\nYear Inches of Rainfall 2007 57.76 2008 56.69 2009 88.33 2010 62.96 2011 48.68 2012 66.63 2013 74.61 2014 83.17 2015 75.69 2016 64.62 2017 91.91 2018 90.01 2019 52.56 2020 76.49 MEAN 70.72\n\nNOAA National Weather Service\n\nThis increase in rainfall will bring an increase in stormwater issues for the area. Much of the coastal areas of the panhandle are developed. There are the dense urban areas of Pensacola, Gulf Breeze, Navarre, Ft. Walton, Destin, and Panama City. There are the less dense, but growing areas of Port St. Joe, south Walton County, and the Highway 98 corridor between Ft. Walton and Gulf Breeze.\n\nBecause the development is dense along the coast, new development is looking northward. There has been a lot of growth at, and north of, Interstate 10 across the panhandle. The communities of Ensley, Cantonment, Milton, Pace, Crestview, Chipley, Bonifay, and Marianna are all expanding.\n\nMuch of this rainfall would percolate through the topsoil to the water table and aquifer below. Some would meet hard soils and flow into creeks, streams, ponds, lakes, and rivers eventually making its way to the coastal estuaries. But most of the development described above has/is using impervious building materials that disrupts the natural flow of this water. The collecting rainwater, called stormwater, floods parking lots, yards, and streets forcing engineers to develop means of moving this stormwater off the developments and into holding ponds or discharging into one of the available streams, creeks, ponds, or rivers.\n\nDespite these efforts, many of these developments are still experiencing flooding. In some cases, the development was placed in a low-lying area where water would naturally flow, and flooding problems become more frequent. In the last 10 years, with the increased rainfall we have seen, there has been a lot of talk about flooding issues with residents, businesses, and local governments. If these climate models are correct, we can expect more of this.\n\nOne area of interest I have for Sea Grant Programming is how this increase in rainfall and stormwater will impact the salinity in the Pensacola Bay system. Seagrass restoration, oyster restoration, oyster aquaculture, and fisheries are all sensitive to the salinity in the bay. The hypothesis is that if rainfall is going to increase, then stormwater discharge from developments will increase, and the salinity of the bay system will decrease – at least at the surface (less saline water being less dense than higher saline water). That said, much of the estuary is relatively shallow and an increase in rainfall and stormwater could impact much of the water column. Benthic species, such as seagrass, oysters, and even possible scallop restoration could be negatively impacted by decreasing salinities.\n\nThere are species of seagrass that can tolerate lower salinities, but can they support the fisheries that many locals are interested in (such as spotted sea trout and scallops)? Sea Grant currently works with the University of West Florida using community science volunteers to monitor patches of seagrass in the bay area. Not only are we interested in density of the grass, but the species composition.\n\nShoal grass (Halodule wrightii) and turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum) are species that once dominated much of the lower portion of the Pensacola Bay system (Santa Rosa Sound and Big Lagoon). Both require higher salinities – a mean of at least 20 ppt. Widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima) is a local seagrass that can tolerate lower salinities and is more common in the upper portions of the estuary. Our volunteers are currently monitoring whether the grass density is increasing over time but also looking at whether there is a species composition shift from Shoal-Turtle grass to more Widgeon grass. This could happen if salinities are decreasing and could impact fish diversity as well. It is known that the bay scallop (Argopecten irradians) is strongly associated with turtle grass and also requires the salinity to be at, or above, 20 ppt. These species that prefer higher salinities can tolerate short periods of low salinity – that is the nature of estuaries – but it is not known whether they can tolerate prolonged periods of low salinity, or a complete shift to a lower salinity bay. Most are sure they cannot. Sea Grant now has a team of community science volunteers who are monitoring salinity near the shoreline around the bay system to see how/if this salinity shift is happening with the increasing rainfall.\n\nThe increase stormwater will bring much more than just lower salinity. It brings sediment from the development mentioned above which can smother benthic life, like oysters, and lower water clarity negatively impacting seagrass growth. Stormwater also brings fecal bacteria, those bacteria associated with mammalian and avian digestive systems. The fecal bacteria concentration in the bay is an indicator of possible other pathogenic organisms associated with sewage. Heavy rainfall can initiate leaking and flooding of both septic systems and sanitary sewage overflows increasing the bacteria load in the water and requiring health advisories to be issued. This is a reoccurring issue in most of our estuaries. And let’s not forget the other organic and inorganic compounds we place in the environment. Pesticides and fertilizers on our lawns, oil and gas from our vehicles, cleaning compounds, and more. All are washed off the landscape and into local waterways during heavy rains.\n\nExcessive rain not only increases stormwater, and the associated issues mentioned, it can be devastating to local agriculture. One would think that rain is good for crops, and it is. But too much of anything can be bad. Libbie Johnson (UF IFAS Extension Agriculture Agent in Escambia County) explained how the excessive rain has impacted the cotton fields of the Florida panhandle this year. She mentions from the highway much of the cotton looks green and healthy, but when you walk in the fields you will see they are green because the bolls are not there – so the nutrients needed for seed production are moved to the leaves. A closer look shows foliage on the ground. The plants are suffering from hard lock and boll rot – diseases caused by both fungi and bacteria. It typically occurs but in wetter conditions it is worse. Some fields are not as bad as others, and some cotton may be picked this year, but the heavy rains late into the season will be a big problem for this industry2.\n\nRecord Temperatures\n\nHigh temperatures reported by Current Results; weather and science facts3 suggest that our annual high temperatures in the summer have not changed much since 1949. They range from 93°F in 1967 to 106°F in 1980. Over that 71-year period, 17 (24%) the high temperature for the year was over 100°F. Interestingly between 1950 and 1954 Pensacola experienced annual high temperatures over 100°F each year – a heat wave. But what about the annual temperatures over the course of the year? Are the winter temperatures changing?\n\nA website entitled ClimateSpy4 reviews conditions from the weather station onboard NAS Pensacola. According to their data on the warmest and coldest months of the year at NAS, the warm temperatures range between 90-100°F between 1950 and 2020 – the warmest day being 106°F on Aug 29, 2000. The cold temperatures are all around 35°F and reported from the 1970s. As a kid in the 1970s, I do remember school being closed due to snow and they asked us to drive home… which I thought was amazing because no one knew how to drive in the snow. And sure enough, many ended up in ditches along the side of the roads from sliding. I also remember as a kid in the 1960s heavy frost on the ground during winter on many days, something I do not see much anymore.\n\nIn August 2016 the U.S. EPA developed a two paged fact sheet on the impacts of climate on the state of Florida. They state that5\n\nThe peninsula of Florida has warmed 1°F over the past century.\n\nThe sea is rising about one inch each decade.\n\nHeavy rainstorms are becoming more severe.\n\nThey expect the temperatures to continue to rise producing more hot days and less freezing for agriculture.\n\nThey provide a graphic that shows the mean temperatures have increased over much of the country, including south Florida. But the panhandle is more stable, some areas even cooling. This is most likely due to the increase rain events this region is experiencing.\n\nTropicalization\n\nYes… we have seen evidence of this in the Florida panhandle.\n\nThe first evidence I have witnessed was the increased number of growing mangroves in this area. Red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) and black mangroves (Avicennia germinans) are both salt tolerant tropical trees that dominant the estuaries of central and south Florida. Their current north range extends to Cedar Key Florida (29.14°N). However, both species have been found in recent years during surveys in the Florida panhandle including – Apalachicola (29.72°N), Port St. Joe (29.81°N), Panama City (30.16°N), Pensacola (30.42°N), Horn Island MS (30.24°N), and the Chandeleur Island in LA (29.84°N).\n\nInterestingly there are records of these trees in these areas back as far as the 1940s6. This suggests that the seeds (propagules) of mangroves often drift north to the panhandle. During warmer periods they germinate and may form saplings. However, a hard freeze eventually happens, and the plants die. Snyder et.al.6 report the thermal minimum for the black mangrove is 20°F; numbers we do not see often in the panhandle, but they do occur. But Snyder also reports mangroves in the panhandle reaching heights of 20 feet or so. Suggesting that the hard freezes are not as frequent and allowing a natural range shift of these plants northward. Sea Grant and the Marine Science Academy at Washington High School in Pensacola monitored a red mangrove that was found in 2009 and was about three feet tall at that time until a hard freeze killed it in 2018. It survived nine years, developing prop roots, but never growing much taller. Partnering with Dauphin Island Sea Lab and the National Estuarine Research Reserves, Sea Grant continues to monitor for the presence of this tropical tree in the northern Gulf.\n\nThe historic range of the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) included the entire Gulf of Mexico portions of the northern Caribbean, and the Atlantic coast as far north as Massachusetts7. It is true that during the colder months of the year this animal would migrate to the warm water refuges of Florida. So, seeing this animal in the northern panhandle should not be unusual. But in the 1970s their populations were very low, and the animal was placed of the federal endangered species list. Sightings throughout their range, other than peninsula Florida, became rare. During the 1980s and 1990s it was not unusual to hear reports of a few manatees, maybe two or three, entering the Pensacola Bay region.\n\nBut in 2018 one of our community science volunteers monitoring seagrass in Big Lagoon saw at the end of her dock. She reported it to me. I responded by letting her know that one-off sightings of manatees are not unusual in our area. But then she began to see more, reporting as many as five at one time. Others began to let me know about sightings they had. One reported nine individuals together near Kees Bayou in the Intracoastal Waterway near the Alabama line. This was unusual.\n\nIt turned out that the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama had been tracking manatees for about 10 years after they began to see an increase in numbers over their way. Sea Grant partnered with them to develop a Pensacola Bay Area Watch and report our sightings to their network. In 2019 we logged 66 sightings. This was definitely an increase in what this area had experienced in the last two decades. The team is now partnering with the Pensacola-Perdido Bay Estuary Program to report sightings. The program extends to Choctawhatchee Bay to our east and in 2021 a pod of 23 manatees was seen near Destin. All of this data is logged within the Dauphin Island Sea Lab’s program.\n\nThe question now is the cause of this increase. We know that manatee populations have increased in the last few decades. Is this the reason? Or are the conditions in the northern Gulf becoming more conducive to the manatees’ needs? Maybe it is both. There is now a resident population in Wakulla Springs of about 44 animals. We will continue to monitor the sightings and see if they over winter here. The need for warm water winter sites (waters where the temperatures are at, or above, 70°F) are still in the peninsula part of Florida. So, it is believed they will not overwinter here. Monitoring continues.\n\nThen there are the snook…\n\nSnook (Centropomus undecimalis) is a popular game fish sought by anglers in central and south Florida. Along with the tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) were one of the reasons the huge tourism industry kicked off in the early 20th century. People loved to come to Florida trying their luck catching them. And you had to come to Florida to catch them, they are a warm water species.\n\nLike manatees, their historic range includes the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast as far north as New York8, but the fish is not common in the colder parts of their range. They are considered transients, summer visitors when waters are warmer. But warmer water temperatures maybe extending their resident range further north in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nPurtlebaugh et.al9 report an increase in snook catches in and around Cedar Key FL since 2007. Their studies found snook of all age classes between 2016 and 2018 suggesting that reproduction was occurring there, further suggesting that snook are expanding their range into north Florida. There have been reports of the fish in both Apalachicola and Pensacola, though no evidence that they are reproducing here – winters are still too cold for that.\n\nInvasive Species\n\nNorth Florida has its share of invasive species. But due to our cold winters, many we hear and read about in south Florida are not a threat to us… yet.\n\nMost of the invasive species we hear about in our neck of the woods are plants. Chinese tallow, Japanese climbing fern, Chinese privet, and cogongrass to name a few. But we have had issues with some animals. Red fire ants, feral hogs, and nutria have all been problematic in this part of the Gulf.\n\nBut recently there have been increased sightings of new species historically found in peninsula Florida. The brown anole (Anolis sagrei) is a small lizard from the Caribbean, specifically the region of Cuba (hence the other common name – Cuban Anole). I first heard reports of this non-native in and around the Perdido Key area. They are now abundant there and appear to be abundant in the Gulf Breeze area, East Hill and downtown areas of Pensacola, and… all along the panhandle. I visited a wholesale nursery east of here that had one greenhouse invested with them. I have seen them at every rest area on I-10 between Pensacola and I-75. They appear to be everywhere now.\n\nIt is believed they arrived here as hitchhikers on ornamental plants grown in nurseries in south Florida. At one time, you did not have to worry about such hitchhikers because our winter freezes would end the invasion. But those freezes are not occurring as frequently and these populations, just as the mangroves, are hanging on longer. Some may believe that when a good hard freeze does occur, we will no longer have to worry about them. But that may not be the case.\n\nLaura Rubio’s master thesis looked the thermal minimum for both the native green anole (Anolis carolinesis) and the invasive brown anole. She looked at populations along the range of peninsula Florida up to Georgia. In Georgia she found that the native green anole dealt with cold winters better than the brown anoles, and the males handled it better than the females in both species. But as her work continued, she noticed that the brown anoles did acclimate to the colder climate10.\n\nThere are studies showing that the invasive Argentine Black and White Tegu (Salvator merianae) can do the same. This is a large lizard, reaching lengths of up to three feet. They are from South America but have at least three breeding populations in central and south Florida. However, there have been reports of the animals in Georgia, South Carolina, and the Florida panhandle. Can they handle our winters?\n\nA study conducted by Scott Goetz et. al.11 suggest yes. The study was conducted at Auburn University. They were trying to determine whether this animal could adjust to our winter temperatures. Nine of the 12 animals in the study emerged from their first winter just fine and seven made it over one year. Suggesting that these tropical reptiles could survive if they made their way to our part of the Gulf. Whether this is because the annual winter temperatures in north Florida and Alabama have warmed, or whether they are due to acclimating reptiles was not specifically addressed in the study, but the reduction of frost/freezing days could play a part.\n\nOne final note on invasive species. The Brazilian Peppertree (Schinus terebinthifolia) has been a huge problem in south Florida for decades. This aggressive invasive plant has taken over many areas of the state. Native to Brazil, it has covered much of the peninsula part of the state but not the Florida panhandle or into Georgia. A few years ago, one was found on St. George Island in Franklin County FL near Apalachicola. This year one was found in Niceville FL near Destin in Okaloosa County. Like the mangrove, one would suspect that a hard freeze would do their populations in. But we will have to see if such freezes occur.\n\nGrowth Zones\n\nGrowth zones are geographic zones extending east and west with a similar climate and help horticulturists select which plants will do best. The higher the number, the more tropical.\n\nHistorically the Florida panhandle was in Zone 8. But now we are in Zone 9… it has warmed12. These climate shifts are occurring with elevation as well. The big difference within these zones is how cold it now gets during winter. In our area, winter is warmer than it was a few decades ago allowing some subtropical and tropical to overwinter and thrive during the warmer months. This connects with the invasion of some invasive species and plants like mangroves.\n\nSea Level Rise\n\nAccording to the 2021 IPCC Assessment Report 6 not only is sea level rising, it appears even with a dramatic reduction in greenhouse gasses, that trend will not turn around for at least a century – the sea will rise. So, how does this effect Florida?\n\nIn paper published by Thomas Ruppert (Florida Sea Grant) in 2013, our state can expect a rise of about 1.5 to 4.5 feet by 210013. One must remember that vertical rise of one foot could equal a couple of feet of horizontal flooding. The King tides of the Atlantic coast of the state have been in the news for years. These rising waters impact drainage, groundwater levels, enhance saltwater intrusion in drinking and agriculture sources. Monroe County reported impacts of SLR to include having to replace vehicles due to sitting in salt water. You can also include a rise in storm surge during tropical storms to the list of impacts.\n\nMany coastal communities are already dealing with increased flooding due to excessive rainfall. Adding a rising sea will make these issues worse. Natural systems, like barrier islands and salt marshes, will natural “roll” inland as the sea rises but if there is development in the way (and there is), they cannot. So, the loss of the systems, the commercial and recreational economic importance, and the ecosystem services they provide will be lost.\n\nAll of these are very real, and many are occurring as this is being typed. The obvious next question is what can we do about it? That will be the focus for our last segment in this series – Part 5 (Solutions).\n\nReferences\n\n1 National Weather Service.
