Eels will be sampled near the river mouth, upstream above and below high dams to specifically characterize the American eel population within the Roanoke River mainstem. Additionally, the age, sex, and presence of a parasite in swimbladders of individual fish will be determined from sampled eels. Finally, age, growth, and mortality of American eels will be modeled in relation to location sampled, sex, and the presence of parasites as data allow. Information from these objectives will be synthesized to provide a better understanding of American eel ecology and management.

Environmental Determinants of Sex in Fishes: Endocrine Disruptors and Water Temperature September 2016 The mechanisms of phenotypic sex determination in fishes are well understood but the process can be easily altered by the fish’s environment. Because fish are in intimate contact with the water, compounds within the water, or the quality of the water itself, can directly influence fish physiology and disrupt or alter the normal hormonal cascade that leads to their phenotypic sex. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1. conduct a survey for the presence of EDCs and intersex in common fish at sites along a flowing water system influenced by PCB contamination and municipal wastewater effluent, and 2. determine whether southern flounder in two brackishwater nursery areas have skewed sex-ratios based on temperature using molecular biomarkers and physiological indicators (Na/K ATPase). This work will provide critical insight into the role of anthropogenic chemicals (EDCs) and natural temperature variations on important aquatic species. None Robust Redhorse Recovery and Habitat Restoration: Assessing Water Quality Stressors and Food Web Contaminant Dynamics December 2017 The robust redhorse (Moxostoma robustum) is a rare and imperiled, large catostomid fish found in only three regulated river drainages in the southeastern U.S. It has large pharyngeal teeth for crushing mollusks and other invertebrates known to sequester anthropogenic contaminants. The robust redhorse has been negatively affected by habitat modification and fragmentation from hydroelectric dams, introduced species, sedimentation, and water pollution and is protected by state endangered status in Georgia and North Carolina. Previous research by the authors and their students on physical instream habitat suitability has shown that habitat suitability will be enhanced by prescribed flow augmentations from hydroelectric dam releases; however, the impacts of water quality and contaminant loads remain unknown. In addition to the unknown effects of traditional organic and inorganic contaminants, recent research suggests that the impact of emerging contaminants, such as endocrine disrupting compounds, may be of significant detriment to fishes in the Pee Dee River. To further elucidate the impact and potential threat of water quality and contaminant dynamics on the robust redhorse, we proposed six research objectives to pursue in the Pee Dee River of North Carolina and South Carolina. We will (1) conduct systematic field sampling of habitat and food web components, (2) conduct experimental field bioassay exposures with captively-propagated fish, (3) perform laboratory analyses of traditional and emerging contaminants (4) determine aquatic food web structure, (5) develop population and food web models to describe effects of habitat and water quality modifications, and (6) synthesize results for robust redhorse recovery from population and ecosystem perspectives. This research is unique in that it will yield results and inference that are descriptive (systematic sampling), explanatory (experimental bioassays, food web analyses), and predictive (population and food web modeling) at multiple scales and across disciplines to inform decision making and management. If the proposed research is funded and conducted, it will guide management objectives and goals for species recovery and habitat restoration.

Assessing the effects of the National Park Service predator and vehicle management practices on nesting shorebirds at Cape Hatteras National Seashore November 2017 The study will be comprised of two components. 1) An examination of historic predator and vehicle management practices and American Oystercatcher distribution, abundance, and productivity data to assess whether these practices are meeting the National Seashores short and long-term management objectives. This work will model spatial and temporal patterns of American Oystercatcher abundance and productivity from 1998 to the present in relation to relevant covariates including: the proximity and intensity of predator management, vehicle and pedestrian closure type, vehicle and pedestrian intensity, and causes of nest failure. Response variables will include the number of nesting pairs, hatching success, and fledging success. 2) An experimental evaluation of current vehicle and pedestrian closures for breeding American Oystercatchers to determine the relationship between closure type, size, and duration and oystercatcher behavior, physiology, and nesting success. Methods developed for American Oystercatchers at Cape Look National Seashore from 2010 – 2012 will be used to quantify the sensitivity of nesting birds to vehicles and pedestrians. Digital video and heart rate monitors embedded in artificial eggs will record changes in bird behavior and physiology in relation to the proximity of vehicles and pedestrians. Studies of the movement, activity patterns, and habitat use of radio-tagged birds will quantify the habitat requirements and behavioral responses of adults and pre-fledging chicks to various types of anthropogenic disturbance. None Responses of Targeted Herpetological Communities to Fire Management Practices in Pine-Oak Forests of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park July 2014 Forest managers at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are working to reintroduce a fire regime that once characterized the southwest portion of the park. However, managers are uncertain about the effects of fire - especially detrimental effects - on populations of amphibians and reptiles. This project will investigate relationships between prescribed fire management and herptile community response in this area of the park. The investigation will rely on field sampling and predictive modeling approaches. The outcome of this study, along with a companion project on bird community associations with fire management, will help inform park managers about responses by forest fauna to the reintroduction of fire. None Modeling suitable habitat for the robust redhorse in the Pee Dee River. May 2012 The robust redhorse, Moxostoma robustum, was rediscovered in 1980, 110 years after its description. This fish was first discovered by Edward Cope in the Yadkin/PeeDee River of North Carolina in 1869. However, this largest of the redhorse species was lost to science until it was recently rediscovered in Georgia. Historically, the fish was found in large Atlantic slope rivers from the Altamaha River in Georgia to the Pee Dee River in North and South Carolina. Habitat loss and spawning disruption by dams were identified by the Robust Redhorse Conservation Committee as a one of several threats to the robust redhorse. Robust redhorse historically occurred in the Pee Dee River between Tillery Dam and Blewett Falls Lake, but are presumed to be extirpated from that reach. Habitat analyses in the lotic reach upstream of Blewett Falls Lake, based on the newly developed habitat suitability criteria for the robust redhorse, would inform river managers on the feasibility of potential reintroduction of the species into that reach. Cooperative research is underway to accomplish the following objectives with the ultimate goal to improve our understanding of robust redhorse reproductive and habitat ecology and guide management to ensure the long-term survival and population enhancement of this imperiled species. 1. Quantitatively describe instream habitat availability under varying flow volumes in the unimpounded, lotic reach of the Pee Dee River upstream of Blewett Falls Lake. 2. Model the quantity of suitable robust redhorse habitat in that reach under varying flows, based on habitat suitability criteria for the species (spawning and non-spawning). This research will improve our understanding of a little-known and rare imperiled fish, that may require specific management activities, such as population reintroduction or augmentation in this and other regulated river systems. None Sicklefin Redhorse Ontogeny, Recruitment, and Priority Habitats in Regulated Rivers. June 2017 The sicklefin redhorse Moxostoma sp. (Catostomidae) is a potamodromous, undescribed and imperiled fish in the southern Appalachian Mountains. It is a candidate for protection under the Endangered Species Act, but little is known of its biology and ecology. Previous research by Kwak and others increased the knowledge of sicklefin redhorse reproductive ecology and behavior, based on adult fish. This research will examine the early life history and ecology of the sicklefin redhorse and its congeners, especially as related to habitat suitability, dams, and invasive predators. Our primary objectives include (1) estimate the reproductive success of the sicklefin redhorse at early life stages in terms of abundance and growth, relative to sympatric congeneric species; (2) describe ontogenetic shifts in sicklefin redhorse habitat use and suitability during early life stages and relative to that of adult fish; (3) determine the effects of introduced fishes on sicklefin redhorse recruitment; and (4) add to the spatial database on important sicklefin redhorse spawning areas. Genetic techniques will be applied to identify larval and juvenile fish. Improved knowledge, particularly of the early life history of the species, will inform and guide critical future decisions in river management and dam relicensing that directly affect the survival of this imperiled fish.

Characterizing habitat suitability for American Shad in the Yadkin-Pee Dee River December 2013 In the Yadkin – Pee Dee River Basin in South Carolina and North Carolina, the extent of fish migrations has been greatly reduced by the presence of dams. Habitat loss due to dam construction is one of the factors contributing to declines of anadromous fish species along the Atlantic Coast. At present, there are no facilities for fish passage at Yadkin-Pee Dee dams, but options are being explored. The primary objective of this study is to characterize and evaluate the suitability of fish habitat upstream of dams on the Yadkin - Pee Dee River. Our focal species will be anadromous American shad Alosa sapidissima, with potential generalization to other species. Characterizing the suitability of habitat above the Yadkin – Pee Dee Hydroelectric Project dams is an important step in guiding diadromous fish passage and restoration efforts. None Extending the Adaptive Management Framework March 2013 This project is designed to designed to develop optimization approaches for strategic habitat conservation decisions in the context of the non-stationarity that characterizes climate and land use change and the supporting software to encourage the application of structured decision making and adaptive resource managment by decision analysts across the United States and elsewhere. None Keystone Field to Market Initiative December 2012 This is a pilot project to define a biodiversity sustainability metric for commercially grown corn, wheat, cotton, and soy crops in the Southeast. This project is funded by the Field to Market project, Keystone Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture (http://www.fieldtomarket.org/) and The Nature Conservancy. This project will serve as a proof of concept to explore the use of a biodiversity metric which can inform producers about the possible influence their practices may have on species within and around agricultural fields. None Research and Applications in Support of the National Gap Analysis Program September 2016 The goals of this project are to efficiently monitor landscape changes, extend the breadth of species-habitat models for assessments at multiple scales, and refine and develop BBNs and decision analysis techniques aimed at evaluating and implementing adaptation strategies by DOI Climate Science Centers (CSC) and the Land Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs). None Systems' Response to Climate Change Projections and Species-distribution Models in the Caribbean September 2013 This project will use downscale climate data to: 1) model climate-change related effects on water quantity and water temperature across Puerto Rico, and 2) model vegetation dynamics to project future land covers. These data will be used to assess the potential impacts of model projections on predicted distributions of flora and fauna using as benchmark PR Gap Analysis Program databases. None Factors influencing native aquatic plant revegetation success for enhanced sport fish habitat in North Carolina Piedmont reservoirs June 2016 We propose a systematic and quantitative controlled-experience field experiment to assess the relative habitat use of native and invasive plants for sport fish support functions at multiple spatial scales. Our goal is to understand factors contributing to aquatic vegetation establishment, costs of vegetation establishment, and sport fish habit value on both a micro- and macro-habitat scale. Research Objectives: Objective 1. Compile an extensive literature review and develop a complete reference guide on vegetation native to North Carolina and revegetation techniques with an emphasis on sport fish habitat in Piedmont reservoirs. Objective 2. Evaluate the cost per unit established of selected native aquatic plants identified in Objective 1 for their sport fish habitat value. In addition, this objective will determine native plant establishment success in the presence or absence of hydrilla and the benefit of herbivore exclosures on native plant establishment and spread. Objective 3: Assess the relative habitat use of native and invasive aquatic plants for sport fish support functions at multiple spatial scales. Objective 4: Disseminate project results to resource managers and stakeholders. None Stocked trout survival, behavior, and ecology in North Carolina streams December 2015 The goal of this research is to define the extent and causes of stocked trout migration and mortality among species and to elucidate the mechanisms responsible. We will combine intensive and extensive studies to determine the persistence of stocked trout in designated reaches and streams, and then the associated processes and mechanisms will be sought in a subset of stream reaches. Fish behavior and ecology will be examined to gain an understanding of the factors that may affect stocked fish growth, condition, and survival. Results may be used to inform and guide management actions to improve resource management strategies and to educate fishery constituents and the public. None A comprehensive examination of endocrine disrupting compounds and intersex fish in North Carolina water bodies. June 2016 To address these issues and significant data gaps in North Carolina water bodies, we have developed the following aims with the goal of establishing a comprehensive understanding of the impact of EDC contaminants to fisheries in the state. Objectives: 1. Develop a GIS-based map of potential sources of Endocrine Disrupting Compounds (EDCs) in North Carolina water bodies. 2. Conduct a statewide survey for the presence of EDCs and intersex in common fish in North Carolina water bodies. 3. Quantify seasonal dynamics of EDCs and intersex in NC water bodies and fish. 4. Conduct intensive field research and experimental bioassays on intersex fish and EDC dynamics in the Pee Dee River Basin. 5. Laboratory assessment of endocrine disruption and intersex in Pee Dee River water mixtures. None Assessing endangered marsh rabbit and woodrat habitat use and feral cat population dynamics using photographic, video, and RFID capture-recapture data July 2016 The lower keys marsh rabbit (Sylvilagus palustris hefneri) and the Key Largo woodrat (Neotoma floridana smalli) are endangered species endemic to the Florida Keys. Their survival is threatened by a variety of factors including habitat change, sea level rise, and introduced predators like feral cats that thrive in human-dominated landscapes. Research has suggested that management actions focusing on the interactions among these factors are needed. Current management objectives include assessing the co-occurrence of marsh rabbits and cats, estimating the distribution and abundance of feral cat populations, and evaluating the efficacy of artificial structures and other restoration efforts for woodrats. We propose to use photographic, video, and RFID capture-recapture methodologies to inform the management of these two endangered species. Our primary objectives are to: (1) use camera trapping methods to validate marsh rabbit pellet count occupancy estimates and to estimate population size and movement of feral cats, and (2) use camera traps, video, and RFID tag monitoring to assess use of artificial structures by woodrats and to estimate the population size and movement of feral cats in woodrat habitat. None Assessing the effects of the National Park Service prescribed fire program on the breeding bird community in Great Smoky Mountains National Park November 2014 The southwestern corner of Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM), with its dry pine and oak-hickory forests, steep slopes drained by small tumbling creeks, scattered old home sites, wetlands, and extensive fire history, provides diverse habitat for a variety of birds. Many of these species are restricted to habitats declining elsewhere and limited in the park by past fire management practices. Prescribed fire has been introduced in the past 20 years, as well as a policy allowing naturally caused fires to burn. The resulting mosaic of mature trees, dense regeneration and open savannah-like forest has changed the landscape significantly. This area was the last known habitat for the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker; several other bird species whose habitat is improved by fire are likely to be present. Characterizing the habitat and identifying breeding birds will guide the park in fire management decisions and help improve habitat. This project will provide fundamental information to evaluate possible reintroduction of red-cockaded woodpeckers and target habitat management for other bird species of concern. None Assessing the responses of breeding shorebirds to military jet overflights of the Core MOA at Cape Lookout National Seashore July 2012 The U.S. Marine Corps and the National Park Service (NPS) have recently agreed to lower the altitude for tactical speed operations (>250 kts) in the Core Military Operations Area (Core MOA, Figure 1) over Cape Lookout National Seashore (CALO). The Core MOA allows high speed (> 250 knots) ingress/egress over a portion of CALO. Previously, the tactical speed ceiling through this Core MOA was set at 10,000 ft; the new ceiling is set at 3,000 ft. A conservation question emanating from this change is whether the change could increase the disturbance of nesting shorebirds. In a letter dated 17 September 2008 from the NPS (David Vela, SE Regional Director) to the U.S. Marines (Colonel Ruvalcaba, FAA SE Region), the NPS expressed interest in a 3-yr research study to “study the noise effects of the MOA on nesting shorebirds,” with unresolved issues including “1) Does noise from low flying aircraft disrupt adults from incubating nests?, 2) How long does it take for the adult to return to the nest?, 3) If adults are disturbed during incubation on several occasions, will they eventually abandon the nest?, 4) Does the noise from low flying aircraft cause adults to leave the area while ‘guarding’ flightless chicks?, 5) What will be the level of disturbance based on the altitude of the aircraft?” In this letter, the NPS summarizes that it does not object to implementing the MOA during the months of May-July on “an interim basis of 3 years during the nesting season for study purposes,” to “gather information on the effects that the MOA would generate on protected species.” In particular, the NPS is interested in understanding the effects on state- and local-listed nesting shorebirds, including the American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus), Least Tern (Sternula antillarum), Common Tern (Sterna hirundo), Black Skimmer (Rynchops niger), and Wilson’s Plover (Charadrius wilsonia) which are all listed as Species of Special Concern in North Carolina, and the Gull-Billed Tern (Gelochelidon nilotica) which is listed as threatened in North Carolina and is a species of low population size and conservation concern according to the National Audubon Society Watchlist (NCWRC 2008, NAS 2009). This interest in studying the potential effects of aircraft overflights on these nesting shorebird species arises from NPS Management Policy 4.4.2.3., which states that “The National Park Service will inventory, monitor, and manage state and locally listed species in a manner similar to its treatment of federally listed species to the greatest extent possible. In addition, the Service will inventory other native species that are of special management concern to parks (such as rare, declining, sensitive, or unique species and their habitats) and will manage them to maintain their natural distribution and abundance.” Additionally, the NPS is mandated to protect wildlife (Migratory Bird Treaty Act), ensure wilderness values, comply with NEPA, and comply with Public Law 100-91 “National Parks Overflights Act.” To address these statutory responsibilities related to the Core MOA, the NPS proposes the need to study the effects of reducing the overflight ceiling from 10,000 to 3,000 ft on nesting shorebirds at Cape Lookout National Seashore. None Stategic habitat conservation in Puerto Rico March 2012 Design a habitat conservation strategy for resident avian species in Puerto Rico, game and non-game species, whose methodological foundation also permits the implementation of structured decision frameworks to evaluate trade-offs between future alternative planning and management actions. None Designing sustainable landscapes for bird populations in the eastern United States. June 2011 The overall objective of this proposal is to develop a consistent methodology and to enhance the capacity of states, joint ventures and other partners to assess and design sustainable landscapes for birds and other wildlife in the eastern United States. Specifically, this project would develop and implement a framework and tools to 1) assess the current capability of habitats in ecoregions in the eastern United States to support sustainable bird populations; 2) predict the impacts of landscape-level changes (e.g., from urban growth, conservation programs, climate change) on the future capability of these habitats to support bird populations; 3) target conservation programs to effectively and efficiently achieve objectives in State Wildlife Action Plans and bird conservation plans and evaluate progress under these plans; and 4) enhance coordination among partners during the planning, implementation and evaluation of habitat conservation through conservation design. None Expanding the range and scope of the Designing Sustainable Landscapes to the entire South Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative area. March 2012 The goal of this project is to provide projections of 21st century landscape change (to year 2100) by expanding the geographic and taxonomic scope of the existing research throughout the SAMBI region and into the Southern Piedmont. This will allow for the development of the core datasets and tools needed for effective Strategic Habitat Conservation (SHC) decision-making across the entire SALCC region. These datasets include projections of climate change, urbanization, ecosystem disturbance processes, land cover (habitat) dynamics and management scenarios; species-habitat models for representative species including habitat affinity models and occupancy models using current and projected future landscape conditions to predict persistence of species under future conditions; and decision support tools using habitat data layers from Regional Gap Analysis and species-habitat models to target and optimize habitat conservation for a single wildlife species, multiple wildlife species using similar habitats or multiple species using multiple habitats in a diverse, dynamic landscape using limited resources. None Manatee protection areas in Puerto Rico. March 2012 The proposed project is designed to assist the US Fish and Wildlife to identify and provide the scientific basis to propose manatee protections areas in accordance with federal regulations. As such, this project addresses core recommendations made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 5-year evaluation (USFWS 2007). The expected benefit of this measure is to foster the persistence of the species in the Caribbean through habitat conservation. The proposed project will consist of two phases. The first will be to identify and articulate the fundamental objectives and a portfolio of management options available to the US Fish and Wildlife Service and collaborating conservation agencies. These tasks will be accomplished through a participatory process or workshops. The second phase will consist of synthesis of information, using models when appropriate, to assess the impact of various alternatives and highlight those with most support. The results of this process will be transferred to the US Fish and Wildlife Service for review, decision making and subsequent course of action. None Integrated Waterbird Management and Monitoring within the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways. December 2012 This project focuses on wetland-dependent migratory birds such as; waterfowl, shorebirds, and wading birds (collectively defined here as waterbirds). Most wetland managers don?t have the luxury of managing for a single species or one guild of species. Managers must take into consideration many factors when targeting management for different bird guilds or conducting management activities that benefit one guild over another. Factors that must be considered are the annual wetland hydrological cycle, species priorities, budget and staff resources, and physical constraints of the wetlands being managed. All these factors lead managers to adjust individual wetland objectives on an annual basis to take into consideration changing wetland conditions that present management opportunities or problems that must be addressed. To meet these needs, habitat and population monitoring protocols and databases will be developed that allow data to be shared or linked across spatial scales, promote the use of adaptive management, and help to identify the importance and priority of management decisions. None American Oystercatcher Conservation Initiative North Carolina December 2011 The American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) is an important indicator of ecological conditions on Atlantic coast beaches. Because of its conspicuousness and site fidelity, the oystercatcher is an ideal study species for describing the challenges faced by beach-nesting shorebirds. American Oystercatchers are listed as a “species of special concern” in North Carolina (North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission 2008) and as a high priority species in the US Shorebird Conservation Plan (Brown et al. 2001), in large part because of threats associated with development and increasing recreational use of coastal breeding and wintering sites. Oystercatcher populations are declining in the mid-Atlantic states, despite rising numbers and expanding breeding range to the north (Mawhinney and Benedict 1999; Nol et al. 2000; Davis et al. 2001). These overall declines have triggered a large-scale, multi-state research effort to understand the bird’s ecology and conservation needs. A study of breeding American Oystercatchers in North Carolina was initiated on South Core Banks, Cape Lookout National Seashore in 1995 to document nesting success (Novick 1996). The scope of the original study has expanded to include all of the islands of Cape Lookout and Cape Hatteras National Seashores. The study of Oystercatcher breeding success further expanded in the state in 2002 and 2003 when the North Carolina Audubon Society initiated nest monitoring on islands in the mouth of the Cape Fear River. Although the undeveloped barrier islands that comprise the National Seashores were thought to be ideal breeding habitat for American Oystercatchers, nest survival was much lower than expected. Novick (1996) attributed low hatching rates to human disturbance. Davis (1999) continued the work on Cape Lookout and used nest monitoring and predator tracking stations to determine the causes of nest failure. She determined that a majority of nests were lost to mammalian predators. Subsequent studies in North Carolina have supported the conclusion that mammals are the primary nest predators, but they also suggested an interaction between human disturbance and nest predation rates (McGowan 2004, McGowan and Simons 2006). McGowan and Simons (2006) found an inverse relationship between the number of visits an Oystercatcher made to the nest and the nest survival rate, suggesting that the more often nests were disturbed the more likely they were to be found by predators. Simons and Schulte (2008) illuminated causes of chick loss and modeled hurricane effects on oystercatcher production. 2009 research objectives included: 1) Continued monitoring of reproductive success of the North Carolina breeding population 2) Continued banding and resight efforts to facilitate mark-recapture analysis Objectives of research for the 2010 season include: 1) Assessing the response of breeding oystercatchers to an experimental removal of raccoons on South Core Banks, Cape Lookout National Seashore 2) Assessing of the response of the South Core Banks raccoon population following the experimental removal to evaluate the feasibility of predator management as a conservation strategy for ground nesting birds and sea turtles. 3) Quantifying of the relative costs of reproduction on traditional ocean-side sites and nontraditional sound-side, river estuary, man-made island, and mainland sites None Fishery population and habitat assessment in Puerto Rico streams. August 2012 Research is underway to obtain more extensive quantitative population estimates for stream fishes of Puerto Rico and their habitat. We then plan to develop a biotic index that may be employed to rate and classify riverine sport fish habitat. We will analyze contaminant concentrations in sport fish, their foods, and habitats to assess environmental effects and consumption risks. And we will conduct research on the ecology and migration of amphidromous sport fishes to better define management units and scale. None Maximizing the Benefits of Field Borders for Nesting Quail and Early-succession Songbirds May 2012 Study examines how management of field borders in agricultural landscapes can promote sustainable quail and early successional songbird populations in North Carolina. None Reproductive ecology and habitat relations of the robust redhorse in the Pee Dee River. June 2010 Research was conducted to accomplish the following objectives with the ultimate goal to improve our understanding of robust redhorse reproductive and habitat ecology to ensure the long-term survival and population enhancement of this imperiled species. 1. Quantitatively describe changes in potential and observed robust redhorse spawning habitat before and after implementing a spring minimum flow. 2. Describe how robust redhorse use the habitat before and after minimum flows are established. 3. Assess how flow augmentation may affect survival of viable eggs. None Stream trout ecology and management in North Carolina State Parks. June 2010 Research was conducted to gather quantitative information on the population and production dynamics of stream-dwelling trout occurring in North Carolina State Parks. The goal of the research is to better understand the ecological and biological processes associated with these populations and to form an objective information base upon which to form fisheries and ecosystem management strategies, planning, and implementation. None Interaction of stocked trout with native nongame stream fishes. April 2011 The goal of this research is to gain an understanding of the interactions between stocked trout and native nongame fishes in the stream environment. Our primary objective will be to quantify changes in fish density, distribution, and habitat use of nongame fishes as affected by the presence of stocked trout. A secondary objective will be to qualitatively assess direct negative interactions between trout and nongame fishes. Results may be used to inform and guide management actions to improve resource management strategies and to educate fishery constituents and the public. None Hierarchical landscape models for endemic unionid mussels: building strategic habitat conservation tools for mussel recovery in the South Atlantic Conservation Cooperative September 2013 To advance strategic habitat conservation for mussels, managers need: a) better quantification of species life-requisites, including habitat suitability; b) models using landscape level attributes as predictors of suitable mussel habitat; c) mussel occupancy predictive models; and d) population biology and habitat-based estimates of the stream network needed to conserve the species. This research will deliver those tools while also expanding the science of freshwater mussel habitat suitability modeling. None Assessing mortality, tag reporting rate and movement patterns of Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River striped bass June 2014 Striped bass, Morone saxatilis, are of high commercial and recreational value in the Albemarle Sound-Roanoke River. Recent assessments of this stock have not included any results from the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries (NCDMF) annual striped bass tagging program because of critical unknowns such as the reporting rate of tags. We propose to use a fishery independent approach of passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags to evaluate tag reporting rate by sector (commercial, estuarine recreational, and in-river recreational) in order to analyze the tag return data and estimate seasonal and spatial values of fishing mortality and natural mortality. We also propose to compare the financial costs and benefits of this approach, in order to evaluate the feasibility of including PIT tags in the NCDMF tagging program for striped bass and those of other valuable North Carolina species. If feasible in terms of cost, this approach should make conventional tagging programs much more useful for stock assessment. We propose to use sonic telemetry to get better estimates of natural and hook and line release mortality for striped bass during the spawning run in the Roanoke River. Combined tag return and telemetry data can better estimate spatial and seasonal patterns in natural and fishing mortality rates and in this case, could more specifically address spatial aspects of fishing and natural mortality rates during the spawning season. Using the telemetered fish, we propose to estimate the proportion of adult Albemarle Sound striped bass that enter the Roanoke and Chowan basin rivers annually to better identify overall stock dynamics. Results from this study would improve our understanding of anadromous striped bass biology and mortality rates and lead to more precise stock assessments and better management of this valued population. None Hydroacoustic monitoring of anadromous fishes in the Roanoke River June 2013 Anadromous fishes spend the majority of their adult lives in the ocean and make yearly migrations (runs) into coastal rivers to spawn. These species are targeted by commercial and recreational fisheries both in the ocean-estuarine environment and during their runs into coastal rivers. Information on abundance of these important species is needed in order to properly regulate harvests and to assess the effectiveness of rebuilding efforts. The primary objective of this study is to estimate the size of spawning runs of American shad, striped bass, and other anadromous species. A related objective is to gain a detailed understanding of migratory behavior in order to design an effective monitoring program and interpret the hydroacoustics data. None Movement and spawning of American shad transported above dams on the Roanoke River, North Carolina June 2010 American shad Alosa sapidissima are in decline along much of their native range as a result of overfishing, pollution, and habitat alteration in the coastal rivers where they spawn. In regulated rivers, dams can limit American shad access to historic spawning sites. One approach to restoration is to provide access to habitat above dams through a trap-and-transport program. We examined initial survival, movement patterns, spawning, and downstream passage of adult sonic-tagged American shad transported to reservoir and riverine habitats upstream of three hydroelectric dams on the Roanoke River, North Carolina and Virginia, during 2007 and 2008, with added data from a separate contracted study in 2009. In 2007 and 2008, average survival to release was 85%, but survival decreased with increasing water temperature. No mortality during transport was observed in 2009. Some tagged American shad released in reservoirs migrated upstream to rivers; however, most meandered back and forth within the reservoir. A higher percentage of fish migrated through a smaller (8,215 ha) compared to a larger (20,234 ha) reservoir, suggesting that population level effects of transport may depend on upper basin characteristics. In addition, more tagged fish released in reservoirs appeared to migrate to riverine habitat during a normal flow year (2009), as compared to drought years (2007 and 2008), suggesting that environmental conditions may affect migration. Transported American shad spent little time in upper basin rivers, but were there when temperatures were appropriate for spawning. No American shad eggs were collected by weekly plankton tow sampling in 2007 and 2008 in upper basin rivers. Estimated initial survival of tagged adults after downstream passage through each dam was 71-100%; however, only 1% of the detected fish migrated downstream through all three dams and many were relocated just upstream of a dam late in the season. Although American shad were successfully transported to upstream habitats in the Roanoke River Basin, under present conditions, transported individuals may have reduced effective fecundity and post-spawning survival, than non-transported individuals. None Advancing climate change adaptation strategies for high elevation and endangered lowland amphibian species in the US Caribbean. September 2025 We propose to advance effective and efficient adaptation to climate change and recovery in the US Caribbean by addressing two objectives: 1) measuring key micro-climate variables along multiple habitat and climate gradients, allowing for identification of resilient climate habitats for at-risk and endangered amphibian species; and 2) expanding prior work to distinguish between the interactive effects of moisture and temperature on <i>Eleutherodactylus </i>occurrence and abundance. The expected results from this study include an island-wide evaluation of potential climate <i>refugia</i> sites for temperature and moisture sensitive <i>Eleutherodactylus</i> species, and criteria for decision makers to determine when and where they should engage in in-situ management or managed translocations. The well-known <i>coquí</i> frogs, represented by 17 species in the genus <i>Eleutherodactylus</i> in Puerto Rico, are threatened by extreme heat and drying, and coastal saltwater intrusion. Recent investigations have helped to determine how global climate change is likely to affect the local climate of the US Caribbean, and how sensitive different <i>coquí</i> species are to local climate and habitat conditions.

Connectivity for a Complex Life Cycle: Conserving the Crystal Skipper Butterfly in a Coastal Urban Environment April 2026 Understanding of how organisms with complex life cycles interact with fragmented habitats and changing environments has important climate mitigation implications. The Crystal skipper (<i>Atrytonopsis quinteri</i> Burns) is a small butterfly that was described as a new species in 2015 and occurs only on a 50 km stretch of barrier islands on the North Carolina coast that is subject to numerous risks from climate change and urbanization. Our project will: (1) Develop a rigorous, sustainable, and unbiased survey methodology to document skipper population sizes and monitor trends, (2) Evaluate the role of landscape-scale nectar connectivity in limiting skipper populations, (3) Assess whether management can increase Crystal skipper populations and offset effects of climate change, and (4) Implement adaptive, robust, and strategic improvements to the existing conservation plan.

Incorporating estimates of detection probability into the Breeding Bird Survey protocol: Assessment of current sampling methods December 2011 The goal of this research is to evaluate the relative costs and benefits of incorporating different methods of estimating detection probability into the Breeding Bird Survey protocol. Researchers propose to implement this assessment within the operational framework of the BBS through close collaboration with national BBS coordinator, Keith Pardieck, North Carolina BBS coordinator, Mark Johns, and numerous North Carolina BBS volunteers who have participated in our detection probability experiments over the past three years. 1) Researchers propose to sample a minimum of 50 of the approximately 80 North Carolina BBS routes over three consecutive breeding seasons. 2) They will compare results derived from unadjusted unlimited-radius counts with those derived from counts adjusted for detection probability using, multiple observer, time of detection, distance sampling, and repeated count methods. 3) They will provide BBS program managers with practical recommendations about the relative costs (personnel, sampling effort, training) and benefits (bias reduction) of incorporating different measures of detection probability into the BBS protocol. They anticipate that this research will provide field biologists and natural resource managers with a clearer understanding of the bias and precision of current point count sampling methods. The primary products will include measures of uncertainty associated with current point count methodologies and an assessment of the improvements expected if additional information needed to estimate detection probabilities is collected. Benefits will include new applications of theory and sampling methodologies that will result in practical improvements in the quality and scientific credibility of Breeding Bird Survey census data. Subject to the availability of additional funding, anticipated follow-on products include training workshops for practitioners and monitoring program managers, and a monograph synthesizing the results of detection probability experiments and providing recommended sampling protocols for specific research, monitoring, and management objectives None Ecology of raccoons within Cape Lookout National Seashore, NC, and the efficacy of raccoon removal as a management tool for protecting rare, threatened, and endangered species June 2011 To date, relatively little published scientific information is available on raccoon populations inhabiting Atlantic barrier islands, suggesting that additional research is warranted. Although removal of predators like raccoons is still carried out at some sites (e.g., national wildlife refuges) to protect T&E species and is listed as a viable action in the recovery plans for some T&E species, the long-term efficacy of the technique remains questionable. In this study, researchers propose to gather basic ecological data on raccoons on South Core Banks, Cape Lookout National Seashore (CALO) (e.g., home range size, movement patterns, demographics), remove some raccoons from the population, and assess the effects on the ecology of the remaining population and the response of nesting sea turtles and shorebirds. The intent of the removal work is three-fold: 1) determine if the incidence of predation on T&E species declines post-removal, 2) determine the extent and timing of future predation events from areas where raccoons were removed, and 3) assess the impact of removal of raccoons on another prey species (e.g., ghost crabs). Finally, as part of this effort researchers will recommend a science-based management plan and a monitoring protocol that will allow the NPS to measure changes in the distribution and abundance of raccoons at Cape Lookout National Seashore. Objectives: The objectives of this project can be placed into two broad categories: understanding raccoon ecology on coastal islands and understanding the efficacy of raccoon removal as a tool for managing threatened and endangered sea turtles and ground-nesting shorebirds and terns. Research will involve an evaluation of basic raccoon ecology by identifying rest areas, den and nest sites, and local movement patterns, and by estimating key demographic rates such as age-specific survival and fecundity. Researchers will also evaluate how removing raccoons from this environment affects the abundance and productivity of endangered and threatened prey species and ghost crabs, and the ecology of raccoons that remain in the system. They will accomplish this by initiating a program to monitor T&E species abundance and productivity after raccoon removal, and by initiating a program to monitor the response of the reduced raccoon population and the response of non-target prey. None Coastal wetland dynamics and wildlife populations: modeling the effects of sea level rise and landscape change August 2014 (1) Develop hierarchical models of animal survey data collected at sites along the Atlantic coast in a variety of wetland habitats between Maine and Virginia. It is our intention to model variability in detection and spatial dependence. We will review life histories of the target species to select variables a priori to construct candidate model sets to have specious effects, especially when using a large number of covariates. We will also evaluate uncertainty with respect to use of this information for scaling down of global cuirculation models. (2) Link wildlife habitat models developed in objective (1) to outputs from models simulating the response of intertidal wetland complexes in the northeast to predicted sea level rise. This information will be provided by USGS Patuxent researchers None Assessing the relationship between acid precipitation, calcium depletion, and avian productivity in Great Smoky Mountains National Park September 2010 The primary objectives of this research are revised to: 1. Quantify the effects of acid deposition and subsequent thresholds of calcium depletion on the reproductive success of high elevation songbirds and the diversity and abundance of terrestrial snail populations in the southern Appalachians. 2. Determine the level of threat of mercury bioaccumulation in high elevation breeding songbirds and terrestrial snails in the southern Appalachians. Explanation: Research Objective #2 has been added because it has recently been determined that mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) are important contaminants of wildlife populations. Inorganic mercury enters aquatic systems via atmospheric deposition where it is chemically converted to MeHg, a biologically active and toxic form. Recent research has shown that MeHg bioaccumulates through the aquatic foodweb from plankton, to invertebrates, to fish, and then to piscivorous vertebrates. Although recently there has been much improvement in understanding the mechanisms of mercury transfer and accumulation in freshwater aquatic systems, little is known about its role in the terrestrial system. Upland forest soils are natural sinks for atmospherically deposited mercury because the majority of mercury binds to organic and mineral soil particles. Mercury is concentrated primarily in the upper soil column. Research indicates that up to 60% of Hg that reaches lakes originates from the terrestrial watershed. Mercury loading is significantly higher in evergreen compared to deciduous habitats, and higher (2-5x) in mountainous areas in the northeastern United States compared to nearby low elevation areas. Consumption of contaminated food is the primary risk of mercury exposure to terrestrial vertebrates. Birds are at particularly high risk to mercury toxicity because many species are at high trophic levels, are long-lived, and are vulnerable to neurological and reproductive impacts from elevated Hg levels. The effects of mercury contamination in birds has been primarily studied in large migratory birds, wading birds, shorebirds, and raptors; few studies have addressed these issues in passerines, especially those species not associate with aquatic systems. In a multi-species analysis of mercury contamination, piscivorous birds were repeatedly shown to have some of the highest MeHg levels of the 38 species analyzed, however insectivorous birds in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats were also found with elevated levels. Although little research has focused on effects of mercury in passerines, in 2005 Rimmer et al. hypothesized that among terrestrial birds mercury contamination poses the highest risk to obligate insectivorous species. Rimmer found that blood mercury levels in Bicknell's Thrush (Catharus bicknelli) were correlated with Hg levels in leaf litter, demonstrating that dietary MeHg uptake occurs in passerines inhabiting terrestrial environments unassociated with standing water. Mercury accumulation in nestling Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) was also correlated with soil mercury concentrations around the nest. Rimmer further demonstrated that blood Hg levels in Bicknell's Thrush overlapped with those of Bald Eagles, indicating equivalent trophic status of a terrestrial-based insectivore with an aquatic-based piscivore. Rosten et al. found that resident insectivorous passerine species at contaminated sites in Europe accumulated higher mercury loads in eggs and nestlings than migratory or seasonal species. Although Bishop et al. claim that nestling birds are the best indicator of local contaminant trends, mercury levels in adult resident birds can also demonstrate chronic effects due to bioaccumulation. One limitation with the Rimmer et al. study is that they examined mercury levels in Neotropical migrants, and were thus unable to study chronic effects of mercury in resident adults. In birds, mercury loads are often sampled in specific organs, blood, or feathers, with mercury accumulation seen regardless of the material examined. Although adult females can reduce body burdens of mercury during egg production, depuration of MeHg most commonly occurs during feather growth, as MeHg binds strongly to keratin. Virtually all Hg in a feather is MeHg and reflects blood Hg levels at the time of molt. Because an acidified environment both enhances methylation of mercury and depletion of calcium, the adverse effects of acid precipitation may be complex. A recent study showed that Pied Flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) were more sensitive to decreased levels of calcium-rich prey (i.e. snails) in a heavy-metal-polluted area. Thus, there is a pressing need to understand whether atmospheric pollution is contributing to both calcium limitation and mercury toxicity in southern Appalachian high elevation communities. The high elevations of Great Smoky Mountains National Park continue to report some of the highest rates of deposit of air-borne nitrate and sulfate in eastern North America. One effect of this well documented acidification is the loss of calcium, which is an essential element to most life. Observational and experimental studies in highly acidified sites in northern Europe have shown that losses of environment calcium are linked to reductions in populations of songbirds which depend on snail shell calcium for egg production. Similar research has not been conducted in the U.S., but it is necessary to assess the widespread effects of acid deposition on terrestrial animals. Researchers will use the Black-capped Chickadee as a model for evaluating the effects of acid precipitation on high elevation bird communities in the southern Appalachians. Black-capped Chickadee populations have been declining in the southern Appalachians over the past two decades, and they have disappeared as breeders from several high elevation sites where they once occurred. Objectives: (1) Assess whether Black-capped Chickadees nesting at high elevations in Great Smoky Mountains National Park are suffering from acid rain related calcium limitations during the breeding season. (2) Determine the sources of calcium for Black-capped Chickadees breeding at high elevations in the Park. (3) Determine if calcium limitation affects the behavior, habitat use, or breeding success of adult birds None Modeling the response of imperiled freshwater mussels to anthropogenically induced changes in water temperature, habitat, and flow in streams of the southeastern and central United States. December 2012 Freshwater mussels possess a suite of traits that may make them highly vulnerable to climate change. These traits include their patchy distribution, phenological traits (i.e., spatial and temporal dependence of their larvae on host fish), limited dispersal, limited mobility, their threatened status, and the fact that they inhabit fragmented landscapes. Recent research in our laboratory has determined that some freshwater mussel species are already living close to their upper thermal tolerances and thus, may be at risk from increasing surface water and bed sediment temperatures and altered flow regimes due to climate change and associated fluctuations. A primary objective of this project will be to use our newly developed mussel vulnerability and risk threshold data in downscaled watershed and instream regional models so that federal and state natural resource managers will be able to forecast species responses to climate change over the next 30-50 years and to develop adaptation strategies to mitigate the adverse effects. Secondary objectives will be to refine these models and to generate new models with empirical data produced from integrated laboratory and field studies of mussel temperature sensitivities in water and sediment, and instream flow and habitat assessments for mussels. - Evaluate the relative sensitivity of juvenile native freshwater mussels to a range of common and extreme water temperatures that may be encountered during summer periods in streams in the southeastern and central United States by conducting water-based laboratory tests with species that represent each of the two major subfamilies (Ambleminae and Unioninae) of mussels. These tests are necessary to expand the data base for temperature suitability for native freshwater mussels; - Develop a method for conducting temperature tests with juvenile mussels and sediments. This task will utilize for guidance the recently approved standard method for conducting water-only toxicity tests with early life stages of freshwater mussels (ASTM 2006), but will standardize the sediment variables (e.g., particle size, organic content) that may influence temperature exposures. These tests will be conducted with juvenile mussels and are necessary to provide an accurate and precise test method. This task will address the issue of whether sediments may provide a partial thermal buffer for mussels in their native stream habitat; - Evaluate the relative sensitivity of juvenile native freshwater mussels to a range of common and extreme sediment temperatures (with and without overlying water) that may be encountered during summer periods in dewatered streams in the southeastern and central United States by conducting laboratory tests (using the method developed in Objective 2) with species that represent each of the two major subfamilies (Ambleminae and Unioninae) of mussels. These tests are necessary to expand the toxicity data base for temperature-based suitability for native freshwater mussels and will directly compare sediment temperature sensitivities to those already established in Objective 1 above and from our previous research (Pandolfo 2008) for water-only temperature sensitivities. This task will address the issue of whether sediments may provide a partial thermal buffer for mussels and ties directly to related research addressing instream habitat conditions for survival of mussels; - Sample common and imperiled mussel occurrences and associated microhabitat parameters, including temperature and flow, in one Atlantic Slope river basin to develop empirical models explaining mussel occurrence and abundance and field threshold values; - Synthesize all of the stream model and mussel temperature sensitivity, physiology, habitat, and community composition information for biologists and others involved with management of aquatic species and environmental quality. None Assessment of fish passage barriers in Puerto Rico Rivers September 2012 Compile existing information on Puerto Rico fish passage barriers, perform site visits on selected barriers, search for undocumented barriers, and develop a comprehensive document and web site describing known natural and artificial fish passage barriers. (1) Existing information on Puerto Rico river barriers will be compiled from published documents by governmental agencies, the military, and private industry; (2) as warranted to fill gaps in existing information, selected sites will be visited by project personnel to verify the existence and condition of barrier structures; (3) guided by existing literature, personal communications, and patterns in fish and macroinvertebrate distributions published by the Principal Investigator (Kwak et al, 2007) and other investigators, project personnel will search for undocumented river barriers first using existing aerial photography, followed by site visits as necessary to describe existing barriers that may not be documented elsewhere; and (4) all findings will be cpompiled into a comprehensive report, including a map indicating locations of all known fish passage barriers. A web site (i.e., series of linked html files) will also be developed linking map locations to descriptive information about each barrier. These findings will then be incoroprated into research and modeling to describe and understand patterns of native and introduced fish in Puerto Rico to facilitate conservation of native amphidromous fish species. None Migratory behavior of diadromous fishes in the Roanoke River, NC June 2011 Diadromous fish species such as striped bass Morone saxatilis, American shad Alosa sapidissima, blueback herring A. aestivalis, and American eel Anguilla rostrata are ecologically, economically and historically important (Walburg and Nichols 1967; Garman 1992; Garman and Macko 1998; Limburg et al. 2003). Several of these species historically supported large commercial fisheries along the Atlantic coast and in North Carolina specifically, but most of these fisheries declined during the nineteenth century (Walburg and Nichols 1967; Hightower et al. 1996; Richards and Rago 1999; Limburg et al. 2003). The declines are likely a result of overfishing, construction of dams, land use change and poor water quality (Walburg and Nichols 1967; Rulifson 1994; Hightower et al. 1996; Cooke and Leach 2003; Limburg et al. 2003). Dams have contributed to the decline of diadromous species by blocking migration routes to historical spawning and nursery locations and altering downstream habitat (Rulifson and Manooch 1990; Rulifson 1994; Pringle et al. 2000; Trush et al. 2000; Dauble et al. 2003; Freeman et al. 2003). Flow in the Roanoke River basin within Virginia and North Carolina was unregulated until 1950, but six dams now regulate flow (Rulifson and Manooch 1990; Walsh et al. 2005). The Roanoke Rapids dam, located at rkm 221, is the lowest dam on the river. It was completed in 1955 for hydroelectric power generation and replaced a small dam that had been present in the same location since about 1900 (Rulifson and Manooch 1990; Hightower et al. 1996; Hightower and Sparks 2003). Neither dam included provisions for fish passage, thus rkm 221 is the extent of upstream migration for diadromous fishes. Several studies conducted by the NC Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit have examined migration and habitat use, in order to better understand how upstream dams might be affecting anadromous fishes. One current study uses hydroacoustics to examine migration timing and abundance for hickory shad, American shad, and striped bass (NCSU project 5-23061). Preliminary results indicate that the method can be used to count upstream migrants and to obtain detailed information about spatial and temporal patterns of migration. Results of the hydroacoustic study will be important for management, once the reliability of the estimates has been validated. For example, the estimates of American shad run size will be used to guide a restoration program for American shad. This program includes a plan to trap and transport adult American shad above three dams, into the upper part of the basin where additional spawning habitat is located. The start of the trap-and-transport program depends on when the hydroacoustic estimates of run size reaches a trigger value (3-year average of 20,000 individuals). This current project is intended to complement the existing hydroacoustic study, in order to allow for improved estimates of run size, in total and for individual species. This supplemental funding will improve estimates of species composition, and will support experimental work relating fish size and species to acoustic variables. A long-term goal is to determine whether acoustic variables measured for individual fish tracks (e.g., average target strength, time in beam, tortuosity) can be used to discriminate among species. None Identification of American shad spawning habitat in the Pee Dee River, North Carolina and South Carolina December 2010 As part of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) relicensing application, future transport and volitional passage structures for anadromous fish, such as American shad, are being considered for Blewett Falls Dam. Identification and description of presently used spawning habitat could help evaluate the potential of upstream habitat to support spawning American shad. Project Objectives: 1) Delineate main spawning areas for American shad in the Pee Dee River. 2) Identify characteristics of spawning habitat, including temperature, dissolved oxygen, current velocity and substrate type to evaluate habitat selection in this river, as well as to help update/validate the habitat suitability model presently in revision for American shad. None Development of habitat suitabaility index models for American Shad June 2011 The goal of this project is to develop an updated habitat suitability model for American shad. Approaches to be used include developing a database of spawning locations; collecting and synthesizing information on American shad spawning, with emphasis on studies since the original HSI model was developed; and conducting workshop to review preliminary models. None Assessing benefits to migratory fishes of habitat restored by dam removal August 2011 Many fish species migrate in order to reach suitable spawning or nursery habitat. All of these groups benefit when access to additional habitat is restored by dam removal. The Little River basin in North Carolina provides a valuable opportunity to examine how migratory fishes use habitat restored through dam removal. One problem in predicting the benefits of dam removal is that relatively little is known about how these fishes select spawning habitat (e.g., whether species use tributaries or mainstem rivers, deep versus shallow sites, or different substrates). Another limitation in predicting benefits of dam removal is that habitat preferences are poorly understood. Specific project objectives are: to determine fish abundance and migratory patterns during spring and to relate movements to physical variables including habitat availability. Information on spawning habitat will be used to develop refined models for predicting the benefits of fish passage or dam removal in other systems None Ecology and status of Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon in North and South Carolina August 2013 The purpose of this project is to develop and test a multistage survey protocol for estimating presence or population density of sturgeon species in southeastern rivers. The initial phase will be done using a combination of side-scan sonar and DIDSON multibeam sonar. None Southeast integrated assessment: Climate change and wildlife dynamics. March 2013 This project will use downscale climate data to: 1) model climate-change related effects on water quantity and water temperature across Puerto Rico, and 2) model vegetation dynamics to project future land covers. These data will be used to assess the potential impacts of model projections on predicted distributions of flora and fauna using as benchmark PR Gap Analysis Program databases. None Research to advance GAP Anaylsis Program data and applications in the Eastern US September 2011 Objectives: 1. Test the applicability of Southeastern Gap Analysis data in conservation planning at the regional level. 2. Develop an on-line decision support tool to provide researchers, students, and citizens access to conservation planning data. 3. Identify the key environmental drivers of vegetative communities in the Mid-Atlantic and Eastern Corn Belt and mapping of Ecological Systems. 4. Evaluate the utility of pattern recognition methods during image classification of herbaceous ecological systems and anthropogenic cover types. 5. Evaluate the utility of Light Detection and Radar (LiDAR) data for augmenting land cover data classes via sub-canopy structural information. 6. Comparative Analysis of the Ecological Systems based land cover data sets from the Gap Analysis Program and the U.S. Forest Service's LandFire Partnership. 7. Deductive modeling of vertebrate species habitat for Northeastern United States. 8. Test inductive habitat suitability modeling for priority bird species in selected Bird Conservation Regions of the Eastern United States. 9. Analyze the distribution and pattern of conservation lands throughout the Southeastern U.S. 10. Develop analyses for prioritizing conservation values of land trust lands in a regional context. None Field validation of king rail habitat models in the Roanoke-Tar-Neuse-Cape Fear ecosystem May 2011 1) Conduct King Rail surveys across 100 wetlands in the Roanoke-Tar-Neuse-Cape Fear Ecosystem, with three visits per site, following procedures outlined in the Standardized North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocols. 2) Conduct King Rail surveys across 100 wetlands in the Roanoke-Tar-Neuse-Cape Fear Ecosystem, following procedures outlined in the Standardized North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocols in spring 2007 and 2008. Objectives will be achieved by recruiting three field crews of two individuals each working through the breeding seasons of 2008 and 2009. On the basis of standardized NA Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocols, the crews should be able to survey approximately100 sites, with three visits per site. Final composition of the 100 sites will be driven by (1) the strength of the remotely-measured explanatory variables in the theoretical models, (2) the need to validate the model at ecosystem and refuge spatial scales, and (3) the need to validate model predictions across the full range of detection probabilities. None Development of population and habitat objectives for FWS trust resources in the Roanoke-Tar-Neuse-Cape Fear (RTNCF) Ecoregion of the South Atlantic Migratory Bird Initiative (SAMBI) project area February 2011 The research issue to be studied will be the development of species-habitat models used to set population objectives, habitat objectives, and geographic focal areas to guide land conservation and management strategies. The ultimate goal of this initiative is to define sustainable landscapes for Service trust resources and share this information with partners. Objectives: 1. Develop initial population objectives for prioritized Service trust species and abundance goals for natural communities; 2. Convert these population/abundance objectives into habitat objectives; 3. Map potential conservation areas where deficits exist; and 4. Step down population/abundance objectives to individual refuges and partner lands. None Development and Dissemination of High-Resolution National Climate Change Dataset. September 2012 We propose to create a comprehensive web-based dataset of high-resolution climate change projections that can be used to assess the impacts of climate change on ecosystems in the continental United States. The dataset will be generated by applying advanced statistical downscaling methods to a comprehensive selection of global climate model simulations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) database. To meet this objective we will hold a series of facilitated workshops to solicit input and disseminate information from researchers involved with the National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (NCCWSC). We will hold two workshops in FY2010 and a final, follow-up workshop in FY2011. The first workshop will involve researchers from funded NCCWSC proposals and other key stakeholders from DOI agencies. Participants will describe how downscaling approaches are used in their work and provide feedback on useful climatic variables relevant to ecosystem modeling efforts. In addition, the workshop will be an opportunity for participants to learn about different downscaling methods, global climate models, best practices for use of climate data (both observations and model output) and the structure of the proposed national downscaled climate dataset. We plan to hold this workshop in late winter 2010. A second workshop at the '3rd USGS All Modeling Conference' in Denver (June 2010) will consist of a half-day short course on global climate models, downscaling techniques, and the planned Geo Data Portal (GDP). We will hold a final workshop with potential data users in late 2010 or early 2011 to evaluate the proposed design of the GDP. These workshops will improve our final deliverables but also improve knowledge within the USGS and DOI community about climate change science and climate change scenarios. None Assessment of Puerto Rican Parrot Demography March 2010 (Provide a brief but clear statement of the project goals and the specific research objectives. This section should contain a brief paragraph explaining the purpose of the project, and bulleted objectives and tasks. It should be as concise as possible, in an outline format, and should be a 1/2 page to 1 page long. The proposal will be incorporated into the RWO, via the standard statement, to be added to the RWO by the Contracting Officer.) None Adaptive management of horseshoe crabs and shorebirds in Delaware Bay: Predictive Modeling and Implementation December 2010 Science-based management of horseshoe crabs and shorebirds bears directly on national and regional conservation priorities, specifically the USFWS Strategic Habitat Conservation Initiative, the DOI Adaptive Management Initiative, and proactive species conservation to preclude listing under the Endangered Species Act. This project contributes to meeting high-priority needs in the National Shorebird Plan, BCR 30 Draft Plan, DE State Wildlife Action Plan, and NJ State Wildlife Action Plan. Objectives: (1) develop multi-species predictive models that link horseshoe crab and shorebird dynamics to management alternatives; (2) evaluate the models by comparing to historic data and evaluating the underlying assumptions; (3) predict consequences of a set of management alternatives that are relevant to current management decisions; (4) use these models to identify state-dependent management action that are optimal with respect to specified objectives; and (5) report and interact with a working group of horseshoe crab and shorebird experts and stakeholders who are collaborating on adapive management. None SARS-CoV-2 at the human–wildlife interface: Understanding wildlife as potential reservoirs for COVID-19 across urban-rural gradients February 2023 SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus that has led to the COVID-19 pandemic. While vaccines and drugs are reducing mortality rates, the impacts of the virus may persist long-term, especially if non-human reservoirs for the disease create permanent sources of human infection. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been documented in numerous wildlife species in North America (e.g., white-tailed deer, rabbits, ferrets); however, it is unclear how prevalent SARS-CoV-2 is across wildlife species and regions, and whether wildlife can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to humans and domestic species. Understanding the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in wildlife and how prevalence rates vary across the human-wildlife interface is critically important to evaluate the maintenance and transmission of COVID-19. We are capturing and testing white-tailed deer in North Carolina to investigate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and the predictors of SARS-CoV-2 across an urban–rural continuum. White-tailed deer are a particularly relevant study species because they are abundant in landscapes as diverse as rural forests and suburban neighborhoods and high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (>30%) is documented in other regions of North America. Our proposed study will provide seed data for future proposals that expand these concepts to consider SARS-CoV-2 prevalence across multiple species (e.g., mice, raccoons, coyotes, pets), spatial scales (within and beyond North Carolina), and the socio-economic factors affecting transmission risk.

Implementation of National Biogeographic Data and Analyses Toward a National Assessment. September 2025 The USGS North Carolina Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit (NCCFWRU) has an ongoing partnership with the federal government on developing, analyzing and implementing Gap Analysis datasets starting with the NC-GAP Project in 1996 up through to the first completed data set for the contiguous United States in 2016. The focus of the next phase of effort will be in three areas: development of analyses to better understand the state of national biodiversity of aquatic and terrestrial communities, refinement of our data infrastructure to allow seamless updates of data products, and continued development of outreach tools to better facilitate the implementation of our data in conservation assessments. Additional research efforts will incorporate species occurrence data to assess and inform predicted distributions, assess the impact of dam removal on fish communities, incorporate Forest Inventory and Analysis plot data in the refinement of habitat availability, map patterns of species’ turnover and identify common drivers of habitat quality across terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate species.

Determining Henslow's Sparrow (Centronyx henslowii) population redundancy in North Carolina. December 2024 Henslow’s Sparrow (HESP) is a grassland specialist, migratory songbird with a rapidly declining habitat range due to habitat loss and climate change. The species is a conservation priority for the State and US Fish and Wildlife Service due to its limited presence in North Carolina and declining populations across the United States. In North Carolina, the species’ stronghold is at the Voice of America Game Lands (VOAGL). Ongoing efforts are designed to estimate its population size and assess its response to fire management (resiliency), and determine its genetic distinctiveness (representativeness) from other populations. However, little is known about the sparrow’s presence and abundance in North Carolina outside of the VOAGL. The work proposed herein is designed to: 1) identify the presence or absence of Henslow’s Sparrows at sites with suitable habitat parameters, but where their presence or status is unknown; and 2) develop an accurate habitat range model for Henslow’s Sparrows in the state of North Carolina. This work is important because the existence of other populations would spread the risk of local extinction, and strengthen the bases for strategic habitat conservation plans to protect or co-managed occupied habitat.

Resolving Taxonomic Uncertainty in Caribbean Skink Species December 2023 In 2014, the USFWS was petitioned to evaluate nine species of Caribbean skinks (<i>Spondylurus </i>spp.) for listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Information on Caribbean skink distribution and ecology is extremely limited, and there remains the possibility that some species may already be extinct. Additionally, taxonomic uncertainty exists across <i>Spondylurus </i>spp., as the genus was reclassified and split into multiple species in 2012 based on analyses of museum specimens. Research to support a Species Status Assessment is therefore needed to (i) resolve taxonomic uncertainty in this species complex and (ii) document skink presence, characterize morphology, and document the distribution of age-classes at island-level scales. This information is critical to evaluating the listing status of these species and future efforts investigating population viability and extinction risk.

Conservation status and management of Henslow's sparrows at the VOA Game Land and eastern North Carolina. June 2023 We propose four research objectives to deliver a status assessment and gather foundational dataat multiple scales to enable the NCWRC to enhance the persistence of the sparrow at theVOAGL and the State. At the local level, we propose to estimate the sparrow’s capacity tosustain themselves, and quantify the sparrow’s response to habitat management at the Voice ofAmerica Game Land site. The latter is particularly important to lay a foundation for an adaptivemanagement framework to guide habitat management. At the landscape level, we propose towork closely with the North Carolina Bird Atlas project personnel to survey habitats outside theVoice of America Game Land, and lastly, determine the genetic distinctiveness of the NorthCarolina population not addressed by Ibargüen (2004). Off-site surveys are justified tostrengthen the bases for strategic habitat conservation plans to reduce risks of extinction.Likewise, understanding the evolutionary history and genetic connectivity of the North Carolinapopulation of C. henslowii is essential to assess their persistence potential by establishing if theNorth Carolina population is effectively isolated, or subject to “rescue effects” by a broader poolof post-wintering birds from other parts of the species range.

September 2022 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources want to develop a plan of actions to help the recovery of two endangered species in the genus <i>Eleutherodactylus</i> (commonly known as “coqui”), while also reducing the risk that 14 other coqui species are added to the Endangered Species list. Our multi-disciplinary research team responded by developing foundational environmental and ecological knowledge required to build a robust strategy. To date, we have identified factors influencing where species occur, their abundance, and key drivers of reproduction<sup> </sup>influenced by two major sources of environmental change—climate and land use change—for three representative species (<i>E. wightmanae, E. britonni, </i>and<i> E. antillensis</i>). For this next research stage we propose to: 1) characterize the ability of the three representative species plus the endangered <i>E. juanriveroi,</i> to cope with environmental stresses (i.e. their <i>adaptive capacity</i>) using a combination of laboratory and field experiments, 2) map the genetic structure of these species to learn about connections between different populations and identify centers of genetic diversity, and 3) assist agencies in the development of conservation strategies centered on two potential adaptation actions: species relocations to new habitats (i.e. translocations) and making connections to climate-resilient habitats. By investigating the most effective ways to carry out translocations, we will help decision makers answer WHEN it is best to begin consideration of translocations versus continuing to manage at existing locations. And by investigating which habitats have the potential to be resilient in a changing climate, we will help decision makers answer WHERE the best ‘areas of conservation interest’ would be for translocated individuals. Ultimately, our methods will be applicable to other environmental change settings in the context of developing recovery plans and for helping to prevent the listing of species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources want to develop a portfolio of actions to enhance the status of 2 endangered species and prevent the listing of 14 species in the genus <i>Eleutherodactylus</i>, commonly known as “coqui.” To respond to this need, we developed a multi-disciplinary project aimed at gaining foundational knowledge to build a robust, well-informed adaptive conservation strategy. To date, we have identified factors influencing where species occur, their abundance, and what influences their reproduction<sup> </sup>in the context of two major sources of environmental change—climate (altitudinal gradient) and predominant land uses—for three representative species (<i>E. wightmanae, E. britonni, </i>and<i> E. cochranae</i>). Finally, as a precursor and illustration of the endpoint of the project, we constructed a decision framework for the conservation of <i>E. juanriveroi</i>, one of the two endangered species. Herein we propose to: 1) elucidate the adaptive capacity of the representative species, including <i>E. juanriveroi,</i> to cope with environmental stresses using laboratory (<i>terraria</i>) experiments and develop translocation protocols, 2) ascertain the genetic structure of the aforementioned species to gain insights about connectivity and identify centers of genetic diversity, and 3) frame a conservation strategy centered on two classes of adaptation actions: translocations/introductions and climate refuges. The strategy will enable decision makers to address the temporal and spatial components of recovery and pre-listing efforts. By incorporating translocations/introductions, decision makers address the question of WHEN to invest in <i>in-situ</i> management as opposed to translocations/introductions. The second component help guide decision makers to determine WHERE to translocate/introduce individuals, effectively informing decisions about strategic habitat conservation by creating scenario maps, a list of candidate “areas of conservation interest” that could serve as introduction sites and climatic <"
