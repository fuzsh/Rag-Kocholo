        "text": "Mass mortalities of fish are usually caused by very specific conditions or agents. The following general mass mortalities occur commonly or at least expectedly are treated first and typically involve a variety of fish species. Additional diseases and die-offs caused by more host-specific agents and conditions are usually restricted to one or few host species and will be reported below in Sections 14.4, 14.5, and 14.6.\n\n14.3.1 Eutrophication\n\nMost recognized animal mortalities in the GoM result as an undesired product from eutrophication, normally the production of organic matter that forms the basis of aquatic food webs. While this process of eutrophication and of dying animals constitutes a natural progression, its rate depends on a complex of many factors. However, some aspects of this process are influenced by human input, the natural environment, or disease agents that weaken the victim. Most animals that die during this process die from oxygen depletion, from toxins produced by specific harmful algal blooms (HABs), or from predators taking advantage of the weakened condition of the prey.\n\nHarmful concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) fit different categories. For example, the following categories used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and others are (1) anoxia (0 milligrams per liter [mg/L]), (2) hypoxia (>0 and ≤2 mg/L), and (3) biologically stressful conditions (>2 and ≤5 mg/L). All the categories typically occur in June–October in bottom waters of most estuaries in all Gulf States.Footnote 1 Note that corresponding stressful levels have been defined more stringently by others such as Livingston (2001) as >2 and ≤4 mg/L. In a recent comprehensive survey of the trophic status of estuaries in the continental United States, Bricker et al. (2008) concluded that 84 estuaries, representing 65 % of the total estuarine surface area, presently showed signs of moderate to high eutrophic conditions. The main constituent of the organic matter is carbon, with the rate of eutrophication usually expressed as grams of carbon per square meter per year (gram carbon/square meter/year [g carbon/m2/year]). A eutrophic rate in an estuary is 300–500 g carbon/m2/year, with its effect on the ecosystem dependent on export rates of flushing, microbial respiration, and denitrification as well as on recycling/regeneration rates. Ecologically, eutrophication involves scales of both time and space. Autochthonous organic matter loading involves that matter generated within the system and is produced primarily through photosynthesis by phytoplankton productivity or by benthic regeneration. The resulting phytoplankton blooms depend on the amount of light and nutrients consisting primarily of total dissolved nitrogen and phosphorous, including both inorganic and organic forms, but also silicates and other nutrients. In estuarine habitats, primary producers other than phytoplankton include mostly benthic microalgae, epiphytes, seagrasses, and other submerged aquatic vegetation (Figures 14.1 and 14.2).\n\nAllochthonous organic matter, originating from outside the estuary, can usually be traced from rivers but also from watershed runoff and coastal tidal inlets. The nutrient sources include point source discharges such as from wastewater treatment plants, industrial plants, and logging operations and nonpoint discharges from agriculture, residential lawns, and gardens. Both sources can consist of particulate matter such as plant debris, detritus, and phytoplankton and of dissolved matter including humic substances such as humic acid, mucopolysaccharides, peptides, and lipids.\n\nTotal dissolved nitrogen, phosphorous, and silicates, including both inorganic and organic forms, are basic to production of phytoplankton, which plays a central role in carbon, nutrient (primarily nitrogen and phosphorous), and oxygen cycling in estuarine and coastal waters. Phytoplankters grow rapidly, often doubling in number each day. Members of some taxonomic groups proliferate so rapidly that they form dense blooms that can affect water quality as they die, decompose, and sink, utilizing and depleting oxygen from the bottom waters. Moreover, a complex relationship exists between phytoplankton and those animals that feed on them. These animals, zooplankton and benthic filter feeders as well as some larval, juvenile, and adult fishes, graze on, depend on, and control coastal phytoplankton. When phytoplankton blooms, primarily those blooms limited by nutrient supply and light during winter and early spring when water temperatures are too low to support rapid growth of the zooplankton grazers, the excess plankton dies, resulting in oxygen depletion and fish kills. The effects of temperature on phytoplankton growth and photosynthesis are similar for most algal species, with a relatively rapid decline in production at temperatures in excess of their optimum, for example 20 (68 °F) to 25 °C (77 °F). Moreover, the photosynthesis cycle can be influenced for different variants by temperature and toxicants (Cairns et al. 1975). Also, an important aspect of photosynthesis sometimes forgotten is that while oxygen is produced during the light portion of the photosynthesis cycle, oxygen is used up during the dark or evening portion of the cycle. Consequently, a net loss of oxygen production can occur during overcast days, when the upper layer of an extensive bloom blocks the light from reaching the lower level of phytoplankton, or other conditions decreasing light to the plant community.\n\nIn contrast to the case with abundant phytoplankton in a system, zooplankton growth rates are enhanced and their biomass increases when water temperatures warm up in the spring and summer. Also, concurrent availability of nutrients for the phytoplankton can decrease because freshwater runoff, the primary source of nutrients to an estuary, often decreases, resulting in the increased grazing on and control of the phytoplankton biomass by zooplankton, benthic filter feeders, larval fishes, and some juvenile and adult fishes.\n\nMass mortalities of the GoM’s most important natural resources in coastal and estuarine sites usually occur ephemerally, but can occur continually or seasonally. Those mortalities that occur offshore like in the “dead zone” can take place for extended periods even though boundaries of the zone can change seasonally and annually. The influence on the decline in water quality and fragile habitat health associated with nearshore events responds to factors such as rapidly growing and diversifying anthropogenic inputs associated with agriculture, aquaculture, urbanization, coastal development, and industrial expansion. Fish gills often provide an indicator of degraded water quality (Figures 14.3 and 14.4). The mass mortalities will be discussed below, but the brief background on eutrophication in general requires some attention. More detailed treatments can be found in numerous publications such as NOAA (1997), Livingston (2001), Pinckney et al. (2001), and Paerl and Justić (2011). NOAA (1997) provides specific eutrophication data for all coastal water bodies in all five Gulf of Mexico U.S. states; the book by Livingston (2001) provides continuous analysis of various rivers in the Florida coastal systems in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico from 1970 to 2000; and Pinckney et al. (2001) and Paerl and Justić (2011) describe the role of nutrient loading and eutrophication in estuarine ecology. When forecasting the future hypoxia status, the model of Justić et al. (2007) suggests that a reduction in riverine nitrogen of 40–45 % may be necessary to reach the goal of their action plan.\n\nAs a brief review, the common phenomenon of oxygen depletion usually results in mass mortalities in confined areas. For example, after a few days of overcast skies, photosynthesis with the accompanying production of oxygen during the daylight hours reduces. Without sunlight, such as during overcast or during night hours, the process of photosynthesis uses rather than produces oxygen. Consequently, if decaying matter such as dying algae, dead plant material carried from the rivers or marshes, or domestic waste from overflowing septic tanks accumulate in the confined areas, oxygen becomes depleted during both night and daylight periods. Fish will often try to avoid these conditions. Some species of fish such as menhaden, other clupeids, mullets, and catfishes are more sensitive to oxygen depletion than are other species and less likely to migrate away from areas with depleted oxygen. Some of these fish die and further reduce the amount of available oxygen, causing widespread and extensive fish kills, especially in harbors, dead-end canals, bayous, and small bays.\n\nFish involved in these kills are readily recognized by their pale or even whitish gills. These kills can be exacerbated by infestations of ectoparasites and bacteria. For example, centrarchid fishes such as the bluegill in Mississippi estuaries can be infested by the peritrich ciliate Heteropolaria colisarum. It, in turn, typically has a large concentration of the attached bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila. The ciliate feeds on free bacteria and organic debris, and A. hydrophila produces a series of proteolytic enzymes, some of which cause aesthetically displeasing lesions (Overstreet 1988) (Figure 14.5). These and other “red sore” lesions will be discussed in more detail under Section 14.4.1.1. Differentially expressed genes allow some organisms to tolerate low oxygen conditions such as in the grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio exposed to cyclic hypoxia (Li and Brouwer 2013).\n\nMortalities caused by eutrophication occur so commonly on a seasonal and annual basis that reports seldom get published for individual cases in many areas other than in local media unless they are associated with specific bacteria, algae, toxins stresses, or other features. All harmful events do not necessarily kill the fish, and quite often the source is unknown (e.g., non-point source) (Figure 14.6). Compilations, however, are available such as for Florida (Table 14.1) and Texas and Louisiana (Zimmerman 1998; Thronson and Quigg 2008). Most mortalities seem to be caused by nuisance algae.\n\n14.3.2 Hypoxia “The Dead Zone”\n\nEutrophication events discussed up to this point have dealt mostly with fish kills caused by oxygen depletion that occurred in bays and confined near-shore coastal habitats. However, other than areas in the Black Sea and Baltic Sea, a region in the northern Gulf of Mexico Continental shelf represents the largest coastal zone of hypoxia in the world. Even though this zone, up to 20,700 square kilometers (km2) (about 8,000 square miles [mi2]) and reaching down to 30 m (about 100 ft) in depth, is called the “dead zone,” it contains some life that can tolerate less than 2 mg/L oxygen. Rabalais et al. (2002) provided a good review of this seasonally and annually fluctuating zone. The zone typically occurs offshore from Louisiana between the mouth of the Mississippi River and the Texas border, but infrequently during some years it occurs off Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. The zone receives high freshwater discharge from the nutrient-rich Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers, and those nutrients and other organic matter help stimulate phytoplankton growth and create a stratified water column, differing in temperature, salinity, or both. The seasonally warmed surface waters establish a thermocline, with the less dense riverine fresh water further creating stratification with the saltier, cooler, denser water masses near the bottom. The phytoplankton not incorporated into the food web as well as fecal matter generated by the food web sink into bottom waters where the anaerobic bacteria decompose the matter, causing oxygen depletion. A well-defined seasonal cycle resulting from the strength and phase of river discharge, wind-mixing, regional circulation, and air–sea heat exchange processes usually generates maximum stratification during the summer and the weakest during the winter months. Because of these factors, the area comprising the zone fluctuates year to year (e.g., Fotheringham and Weissberg 1979).\n\nIn May–July 1979 after a heavy spring runoff and a diatom bloom, hypoxic bottom water developed in the upper Texas coast (Harper et al. 1981). Samples trawled from 6 m (about 20 ft) and 17 m (about 55 ft) depths consisted of only one fish species (hardhead catfish, Ariopsis felis), all individuals of which were dead or moribund as were many invertebrates, including the dominant polychaete population of Paraprionospio pinnata. Most Texas populations recovered in 1980; a few species of polychaetes that remained in low populations during the hypoxic period such as Nereis micromma and Lumbrineris verrilli increased in abundance immediately after the hypoxia abated probably because of larval recruitment; whereas others including P. pinnata with different life histories took much longer to reestablish.\n\nThe typical hypoxic zone, even though not as extensive as the one described above, appears from sedimentary evidence to have been present in the early 1900s and began to increase dramatically after about 1950. That is the time when the Mississippi Basin underwent a large human population increase with its increased nitrogen output through municipal wastewater systems as well as channelization and flood control of the Mississippi River along with associated deforestation, conversions of wetlands to cropland, loss of riparian zones, and expansion of agricultural discharge (e.g., Rabalais et al. 2002).\n\nLife in the hypoxic zone differs according to the species and the oxygen concentration. Most fish are absent, some actually killed, in water with oxygen less than 2 mg/L; mantis shrimp and penaeid shrimps can tolerate 1.5 mg/L; epibenthic starfish and brittle stars die at <1.0 mg/L; and anemones, gastropods, and polychaetes die at <0.5 mg/L. At minimal levels of 0.2 mg/L, just above anoxia, sulfur-oxidation and bacteria form white mats on the sediments; at 0.0 mg/L oxygen, only black anoxic sediments exist without aerobic life. Demersal fish and invertebrates, those that live near the bottom, leave hypoxic areas and then re-occupy them by October–November. The distribution of sea turtles and cetaceans that prey upon those demersal animals seems to be somewhat dependent on the hypoxic zone (Craig et al. 2001). The oxygenated refuge habitats near the edge of the zone allow some animals to congregate (Craig 2012). The brown shrimp (Farfantepenaeus aztecus) and fish such as the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), spot (Leiostomus xanthurus), Atlantic bumper (Chloroscombrus chrysurus), and seatrouts collected with benthic trawls showed low DO avoidance thresholds and patterns of aggregations near these refuges. The brown shrimp, spot, and croaker showed a consistency between bottom DO avoidance thresholds and abundance in both catch per unit effort and laboratory experiments. Hazen et al. (2009) did not find that strong aggregation throughout the entire hypoxic edge of the water column, but they did find a greater biomass in the upper 7 m (23 ft) and much less biomass below 13 m (43 ft) in their hypoxic stations compared with their non-hypoxic ones.\n\nSpecific events related to oxygen depletion such as the jubilee phenomenon serve as a local one of those conditions that result in edible fish for those lucky enough to take advantage of the resulting “kill.” Jubilees are well known in specific areas in Alabama and Mississippi and result from specific conditions. Depending on those conditions, they can be spread out over 25 km (about 15 mi) or just a few hundred meters of beach. In Alabama, most occur in the upper Eastern shore of Mobile Bay from Great Point Clear to just north of Daphne, and in Mississippi, most occur off Bellefontaine Beach and Gulfport, although they can occur elsewhere. In Alabama, where jubilees are known from as far back as the 1860s (even though documents were searched dating back to 1821), the specific set of conditions involves early morning hours before sunrise in the summer, and overcast or cloudy previous day, a gentle wind from the east, a calm or slick bay water surface, and a rising tide. These conditions produce a stratified layer of salty Gulf water accumulating in the deepest part of the northern portion of Mobile Bay overlain by lighter, fresher river water. During the calm conditions, the salty water stagnates because of decomposing plant material washed into the bay from the upstream marshes and swamps as well as supplementation by domestic wastes and becomes low in oxygen concentration. The rising tide and gentle wind-driven surface current causes an upwelling of this stagnant bottom water, forcing some species of bottom fishes and crustaceans to move ashore (Loesch 1960; May 1973; Turner et al. 1987). In Mississippi, Charles Lyles (from Overstreet 1978; Gunter and Lyles 1979), who observed them since the late 1930s, found several conditions in common. Jubilees occurred during neap tide (tides with a small difference between high and low tide occurring after the first and last quarters of the moon) at night between late June and early September, usually with rain preceding them and water with a well-defined tea color, presumably resulting from a specific phytoplankton organism. Affected animals usually include flounder, stingrays, croaker, spot, eels, blue crabs, and shrimp plus a lot of usually inedible anchovies, needlefish, and catfish. Seldom do these fish die, but they occur in extremely dense groups gulping for air; the eels usually burrowed tail first into the moist sand with their mouths wide open. Since these occur in early morning hours, neighbors often tell other neighbors about the event so they can collect large quantities of fresh seafood in wash tubs for their freezers after being caught with nets and gigs. When the sun rises, the tide changes, or the wind direction changes, the phenomenon stops, and most of the affected fish swim away. Conditions for this phenomenon, such as the role of carbon dioxide, still require scientific attention.\n\nPhytoplankton constitute the most abundant and widespread primary producers in GoM and world waters and therefore support the bulk of marine food webs. Several of the phytoplankton species, including members of toxic algae in addition to nuisance algae, also cause animal illness and mortality of fish and other animals.\n\n14.3.3 Nuisance Algae\n\nNumerous species of nuisance algae commonly produce mortality events throughout the Gulf of Mexico region. Along the West Florida Coast, primary species include Synechococcus spp., Anabaena spp., Chlorococcus minutus, Microcystis aeruginosa, and other cyanobacteria (previously referred to as blue-green algae) and dinoflagellate species. These events tend to occur from April to November and last weeks to months. In the Florida Panhandle, nuisance algal events are mostly episodic, with a duration of days, and occur between July and September. Species include Anacystis spp., Anabaena spp., Cladophora spp., Enteromorpha spp., Chlamydomonas spp., and Aphanocapsa spp. In the Mississippi Delta/Louisiana Coast subregion, mortality events are mostly episodic, last from days in some estuaries to seasons in others, and generally occur between May and September in Mississippi Sound but also occur in January and February; in Barataria Bay, Louisiana, cyanobacterial blooms occur persistently throughout the year. Species in the subregion include Exuviella spp., Prorocentrum minimum, Alexandrium spp., Anabaena circinalis, Katodinium rotundatum, Microcystis aeruginosa, Anacystis spp., Akashiwo sanguinea, and others. Nuisance algal mortalities along the Texas coast occur mostly as day to month episodes between May and September except in the Upper Laguna Madre, Baffin Bay, and part of Lower Laguna Madre where Aureoumbra lagunensis occurs throughout the year. The latter alga produces brown tides, which occasionally block out sunlight and kill seagrasses; the blooms also occur in Florida and Mexico. During the period 1970–1995, the frequency and duration of events increased in Tampa Bay and Galveston Bay. Blooms of the dinoflagellate Noctiluca scintillans appear reddish orange during the day and can produce bioluminescence at night. Even though not a toxic alga, it can accumulate and emit ammonia in concentrations high enough to produce fish kills.\n\n14.3.4 Toxic Algae: HABs, Including Red Tide\n\nSome of the most prevalent toxic algae and associated toxins that cause animal mortalities in the Gulf of Mexico include Alexandrium monilatum (goniodomin A), Karenia brevis (brevetoxins), Karlodinium veneficum (karlotoxins), Prymnesium parvum (prymnesins), and Akashiwo sanguinea (surfactants). Other potential ichthyotoxic species are Cochlodinium polykrikoides (ichthyotoxins) and raphidophyte species such as Chattonella marina, Heterosigma akashiwo, and Fibrocapsa japonica that produce hemolysins, reactive oxygen species, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and possibly brevetoxins (Lewitus et al. 2014).\n\nToxic algal events in the GoM estuaries are variable in duration, lasting days to weeks in some estuaries and months to seasons in others. Impacts generally occur between June and October, except in Florida Bay and Apalachee Bay, where impacts occur between January and March. Occasionally, however, unpredictable toxic algal events may occur during any month of the year (NOAA 1997).\n\n14.3.4.1 Red Tides, Karenia brevis\n\nMost dinoflagellates are photosynthetic, possessing chlorophyll a and accessory pigments, and not toxic; they constitute an important and at times the dominant group of primary producers sustaining the food web. When some toxic species bloom, they cause massive fish kills. Red tide serves as the most well-known HAB in the Gulf of Mexico, with the best known species being Karenia brevis (previously known as Gymnodinium breve). A heavy bloom produces a reddish color in the water and is responsible for spectacular mass mortalities. Importantly, aerosols from a heavy bloom usually affect human respiration and occasionally cause contact dermatitis, which, in turn, provides considerable more incentive and support for research than would be received from fish kills alone. The U.S. population continued to increase between 1960 and 2010 and is projected to increase further, most significantly in coastal states, putting stress on the coasts and estuaries. Between 1965 and 1976, the number of confirmed worldwide red tide outbreaks increased sevenfold concurrent with a twofold increase in nutrient loading mainly from untreated sewage and industrial waste (Hallegreaff 1995). The threat to animals from red tide blooms is predicted by the number of dinoflagellate cells of K. brevis/L from a table by Lewitus et al. (2014) as (1) 1,000 cells or less (none anticipated), (2) >1,000 to 10,000 (very low, with possible human respiratory irritation, and shellfish harvesting closures when >5,000 cells/L), (3) >10,000 to 100,000 (low, human respiratory irritation, possible fish kills, and bloom chlorophyll probably detected by satellites), (4) >100,000 to 1,000,000 (medium, human respiratory irritation and probable fish kills), and (5) >1,000,000 (high, as above plus discolored water).\n\nBlooms of the toxic alga K. brevis occur almost annually in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, most frequently in Southwest Florida waters. Consequently, blooms are commonly referred to as “Florida red tides” and, as indicated above, have attracted research dollars for several decades. In fact, the University of Miami’s initial Marine Laboratory, now known as the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, was established by F.G. Walton Smith to investigate red tides (e.g., Gunter et al. 1947, 1948). Also, Sammy Ray, along with Albert Collier and William Wilson, established the Galveston Laboratory of Texas A&M to investigate red tide and culture of K. brevis (see Zimmerman 2010). Gunter (1947) provided a short history of the Florida red tide in which he deduced that the phenomenon had been reported since 1844. He considered the death of the fish most spectacular because the dead fish floated, a diagnostic feature for fish killed by brevetoxin. He estimated the 1946–1947 red tide killed an estimated half billion fish; he said that such catastrophic kills may cover >25,000 hectare (ha) (hundreds of square miles), and the number of fish killed may even approach 1 billion. He also considered that few, if any places, on earth can produce such vast destruction of life so quickly as the dinoflagellate blooms of the shallow sea with the possible exception of fish kills along the Peruvian coast caused by El Niño. Blooms of K. brevis typically occur in the Gulf of Mexico; however, they can be entrained in the loop current and transported east through the Florida Straits and then north by the Gulf Stream as far as North Carolina. Quick and Henderson (1975) investigated the pathology of fish from a 1973 to 1974 Florida kill, and their evidence suggested that dehydration, hemolysis, and interference in blood-clotting mechanisms also caused fish-death in addition to neurointoxication, the previously assumed sole cause.\n\nBrevetoxins from K. brevis are indeed complicated. There are several non-proteinaceous, lipid-soluble neurotoxins as well as hemolysins. For example, Baden and Mende (1982) investigated the toxicity of two of those toxins, using Swiss white mice and the western mosquitofish as assay animals. In the mice injected with one of the toxins, hypersalivation was the most pronounced sign, although copious urination and defecation commonly occurred as well as tremors, followed by marked muscular contractions. The mice exhibited compulsory chewing motions and rhinorrhea at higher doses. When given the other toxin, a distinct compound but with related chemical structure, no hypersalivation or chewing was expressed and muscular contraction was less pronounced. Mouse bioassays were used to determine the correlation between acute intraperitoneal injections and oral toxicity of shellfish extracts, and the oral assay was not recommended. The disease in humans eating brevetoxin-contaminated mollusks that goes by the name “neurotoxic shellfish poisoning” (NSP) can be debilitating but apparently non-fatal. The first toxin tested seemed to be the predominant agent responsible for the disease; the second at the dose tested produced subacute manifestations that occur in the human disease such as labored breathing, loss of appetite, and motor incoordination. Signs of the disease generally subside in 2–3 days. These signs from both toxins are typical of muscarnic stimulants, as found in Amanita muscaria (a poisonous mushroom), as opposed to nicotine, another stimulant acting on acetylcholine receptors and bind to voltage-sensitive sodium channels involved in the propagation of nerve impulses. Binding opens the sodium channels at a normal resting potential and consequently inhibits sodium channel inactivation, which can result in repetitive firing in nerves. Further studies described by Baden et al. (2005) characterized additional brevetoxins, each with its own specific toxicity and based on one of two different structural features (six toxins known with one and three, thought to be more potent, with the other). More importantly, these multiple brevetoxins activate brevetoxin metabolites, which can be modulated by the different, shorter, trans-fused polyether antagonist brevenals. Brevenal, obtained from either the environment or the dinoflagellate culture, binds receptors and inhibits brevetoxin binding and activity, counteracting the toxic effects on both mice and fish. The pulmonary receptor for both brevetoxins and brevenal seems to be distinct from the neuronal binding site. In other words, the multiple biotoxins and antagonists interact with at least neuronal, pulmonary, and enzymatic regulatory systems of animals, generating a complex combination of acute and chronic signs in animals, including humans, exposed to aerosolized bioactive substances produced by K. brevis.\n\nMost data on Florida red tide fish kills acquired up to the last decade or so were anecdotal and qualitative but useful. Gannon et al. (2009) investigated the effects of the algal blooms on nearshore fish communities in five habitats in Sarasota Bay and adjacent areas. They looked at the cell density of K. brevis as well as data on fish density, fish species composition, water temperature and salinity, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. The clupeid (herring-like fish) trophic guild (a guild [or ecological guild] consists of any group of species that exploit the same resources) was not affected by the cell density of the toxic algae as were all other eight fish trophic guilds. Fish density as measured by catch per unit effort (CPUE) and species richness of those other eight guilds all had a negative association with the algal cell density; 96 % of the local fish kills from 2003 to 2007 (ranging from 4 in 2007 to 72 in 2005, with more nearby) occurred during red tides. The guild consisting of the demersal invertebrate feeders was the most sensitive to the effects of the red tide, whereas the clupeids were the least sensitive, and, when excluding the clupeids, the difference between CPUE in red tide period versus non-red tide period ranged from 57 % in the mangrove habitat to 88 % in the GoM habitat. Fisheries-independent monitoring data (as opposed to fishery-dependent data, which are data collected directly from commercial and recreational fisheries sources) from the Tampa Bay area collected from 1996 through 2006, with an emphasis on the persistent red tide of 2005, analyzed by Flaherty and Landsberg (2011) showed that in the spring of 2006 there was a decline in the annual recruitment of juvenile spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), sand seatrout (Cynoscion arenarius), and red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus). However, the subadult and adult abundance values for these fishes remained consistent with those of previous years. The respective recruitment periods of some of the other fishes did not correspond with the major red tide event. The importance of clupeid fishes such as Spanish sardines, thread herrings, and Atlantic shad in the understanding of fish kills has been recognized by Walsh et al. (2009).\n\nThe dinoflagellate K. brevis requires nutrients to form the catastrophic blooms. A nitrogen isotope budget of the coastal food web shows that diazotrophs (nitrogen fixers, primarily the filamentous cyanobacteria Trichodesmium spp.) form the initial nutrient source of red tides and clupeiformes (decomposing dead sardines, herrings, and bay anchovies) serve as the major recycled nutrient source for the maintenance of those blooms. In 2001, the dinoflagellate “harvested” >90 % of the clupeids along the West Florida Shelf rather than being harvested by fishermen. Fish kills typically originate when K. brevis cells lyse and release their toxins, which become absorbed directly across the gill membranes. Fish may also die after ingesting the dinoflagellate cells or toxins in the water, or after consuming contaminated biota (Landsberg et al. 2009).\n\nThe Center for Prediction of Red Tides (CPR) in Florida (Walsh et al. 2009) has developed models to assess and predict red tides based on nitrogen isotope ratios in portions of the food web that maintain K. brevis. The food web associated with K. brevis has shown to be extremely complicated and differs somewhat in different areas based on currents and winds. Some model components are based on features such as temperature. At summer temperatures, as much as 50 % of some Florida fish decay to inorganic forms of phosphorus and nitrogen within 1 day (Stevenson and Childers 2004; Walsh et al. 2009). Some clupeids can provide about 50 % of the nitrogen supply for red tides. Of equal concern is the nearly equal inclusion of the diatom-based food web, including flagellates, that also feeds the herbivores (harpacticoid and calanoid copepods and certain other members of the zooplankton), in turn feeding phytoplankton-feeding fishes (clupeiformes mentioned above including the Gulf menhaden Brevoortia patronus, which feeds on both phytoplankton and zooplankton, plus the mugilid [striped mullet, Mugil cephalus] that feeds additionally on bacterial degraded phytodetritus) and the piscivorous fish like mackerel, snappers, and groupers that feed on them. Isotope data and animal kills suggest the kills in Florida and the northern Gulf in one year, like 2006, can show how the kills decreased on the West Coast of Florida and then increased on the East Coast of Florida in 2007. The tides have “downstream” consequences up to 1,000 km (621.4 mi) from the Florida Panhandle to Cape Hatteras on the Atlantic coast.\n\nSmall fish kills can also be related to dust and associated nutrients blown into the Gulf from African and occasionally Asian deserts (Garrison et al. 2003), and those kills can include related toxic dinoflagellates in addition to K. brevis. Actually, in the Gulf of Mexico, there are at least nine known established species in the Kareniaceae, and most produce ichthyotoxins such as brevetoxins, karlotoxins, and gymnodimines (Steidinger et al. 2008). These include five species of Karenia (K. brevis, K. papilionacea, K. mikimotoi, K. selliformis, K. cf. longicanalis), three of Takayama (T. pulchella, T. helix, and T. tasmanica), and Karlodinium veneficum, the latter confirmed as cause of fish kills in estuarine ponds. Karenia brevis typically occurs in high salinity waters. In 1996, a bloom occurred in inshore waters of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, contaminating oyster beds. This bloom consisted of a complex of Karenia species, some of which can tolerate low salinities (5–40 parts per thousand) (ppt), but K. brevis was the most prominent species. Maier Brown et al. (2006) examined preserved specimens from this bloom, and they also investigated salinity tolerances of three clones of K. brevis and compared them with a fourth. For the three clones, the experimental minimum salinity at which growth occurred ranged between 17.5 and 20.0 ppt and optimum salinity range from 20–25 to 37.5–45 ppt, depending on the clone. In the northern Gulf of Mexico bloom, the concentration of cells/milliliter (mL) for the complex was high enough to close oyster beds in salinity as low as 14 ppt. Some agents occurred in salinities less than 10 ppt in both the northern Gulf and in Florida. Brevetoxins measured in the K. brevis cultures were found to be higher during the stationary phase of growth and approaching senescence, regardless of salinity, suggesting that as a natural bloom ages, it could potentially become more toxic and pose an increased threat to public health. The specific 1996 bloom seemed to originate in the Florida panhandle and move westward, rather than the typical eastern movement, into Mississippi Sound because of the unusual effects of Tropical Storm Josephine (Maier Brown et al. 2006).\n\nFish kills resulting from K. brevis also occur in Texas and Mexico. Gunter et al. (1948) reported on such massive fish kills, Zimmerman (1998) edited a report covering such mortalities of a variety of animals in Texas and Louisiana in 1994, and Magaña et al. (2003) tabularized and discussed a series of referenced reports of fish kills from various locations along the Texas coast as well as Tamaulipas-Veracruz and Yucatán, Mexico, which occurred from 1935 until 2002. Because of the severe respiratory events involving irritation, stinging eyes and nose, accompanied by a dry, choking cough, resulting from inhalation of air-borne brevetoxins, historic references provide information on Mexican events occurring from 1648 to 1875 (Magaña et al. 2003) and earlier. One case in 1792 chronicled by a government official and reported by Lerdo de Tejada (1850) indicated that sales and consumption of dead fish collected from the mass mortality of fishes on Veracruz beaches resulted in violent human mortalities. Nuñez Ortega (1878) and later others suggested that the human deaths actually resulted from bacterial contamination of or ciguatera toxins in spoiled fish. Fish kills probably resulting from K. brevis along the Texas shelf occurred during 1529–1534 (Adorno and Pautz 2003). Cabeza de Vaca was a survivor of the Narvaez Expedition and reported that the Capoque and Han Indians avoid fish and suspend oyster harvesting seasonally around Galveston Island; during 1534, the Avavares Indians near the Nueces River, Texas, apparently estimated seasonal changes by “the times when the fruit comes to maturity and when the fish die” (Walsh et al. 2009).\n\nBony fishes constitute most of the commonly killed animals, and, as indicated above, some are important sources of stored brevetoxin necessary for future blooms. They can build up to high dangerous levels in living fish tissues by being in the water with K. brevis, by feeding on contaminated mollusks and other invertebrates, or by feeding on contaminated fish; toxins can be abundant in the entire food web (Naar et al. 2007; Landsberg et al. 2009). Until 2000, no mass mortality of sharks or rays caused by red tide had been reported from Florida. Flewelling et al. (2010) reported the mortality of large numbers of blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) and fewer Atlantic sharp nose sharks (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae), mostly juveniles, from the Florida Panhandle. They also examined tissues from 22 species of sharks and rays collected between 2000 and 2008 from animals both in and not associated with red tides along the West Coast of Florida and the East Coast, where some of the animals also accumulated the toxins. The amount of accumulated toxins differed among species, tissue sites, and geographical locations, and in-utero embryos also had accumulated brevetoxins. The brevetoxin concentrations in animals do not necessarily relate to being from or near blooms, and levels are not harmful for human consumption unless the liver is eaten. Large sharks seem to avoid the toxin.\n\nWaterfowl can also be affected by red tide blooms. For example, several thousand individuals of the lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) and lesser numbers of other birds were found dead associated with the red tide fish kill in the Tampa Bay area. Not all birds present died. Examination for bacteria, parasites, pesticide residues, and acutely toxic material did not suggest that any was associated with the mortalities. White Peking ducklings experimentally exposed to the red tide toxins in seawater, either in addition to force-fed contaminated clams (Mercenaria campechiensis) or given non-contaminated clams, became lethargic, developed spastic movements of the head, and died (some individuals in the toxic seawater with non-exposed clams did not die) (Forrester et al. 1977). When Ray and Aldrich (1965) force-fed three doses of experimentally exposed oyster tissue to baby chicks, all doses produced in the chicks a loss of equilibrium, and the two higher doses produced death within 22 h. Shorebirds, including sanderlings (Calidris alba) and ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres), scavenged on beached individuals of the thread herring, scaled sardine, and mullets during a red tide kill. High concentrations of brevetoxin in those fish tissues corresponded with high levels in livers of shorebirds that were collected dead along the local beaches and from rehabilitation centers during the red tide event, suggesting that brevetoxin exposure serves as a risk factor for bird mortality (van Deventer et al. 2012).\n\nSince red tide blooms have been known in the Gulf of Mexico, they have been associated with mortality of numerous animals at higher trophic levels, such as marine birds, sea turtles, and marine mammals (Gunter et al. 1948; Quick and Henderson 1974; Forrester et al. 1977; and others). Because of the ability for fishes and invertebrates (see list of maximum brevetoxin concentrations in bivalves listed by Landsberg et al. (2009)) to bioaccumulate the toxins, blooms do not necessarily have to be present to kill animals. Landsberg et al. (2009) listed hundreds of manatees (Trichechus manatus) and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) killed in both reported and unpublished mass mortalities and not necessarily concurrent with blooms. Even though presently impossible to determine specific lethal concentrations of the toxins and their metabolites, the presence of high levels in the animals was either solely responsible for the deaths or in combination with other harmful factors. Twiner et al. (2012) critically investigated bottlenose dolphin mortalities from the Florida Panhandle and found high levels as they also did for the clupeid Brevoortia sp., which was found abundant as a dietary prey in their stomach. When dead manatees from the 1996 red tide bloom were necropsied, Bossart et al. (1998) observed severe nasopharyngeal, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, and cerebral congestion in all cases. Some exhibited pulmonary edema and hemorrhage. Immunohistochemical staining using a polyclonal primary antibody to brevetoxin exhibited intense positive staining of lymphocytes and macrophages in the lung, liver, secondary lymphoid tissues, nasal mucosa, and meninges. These data suggest that manatee mortality may occur after chronic inhalation and ingestion rather than responding in an acute event. Local rehabilitation centers have successfully recovered several species of birds, turtles, and manatees that would otherwise probably have died from the red tide. The reason humans do not die or become severely ill from inhaling aerosols or ingesting brevetoxin accumulated in fish or bivalves probably relates to their ability to avoid lethal doses. This contrasts to ciguatera toxin, which is a similar compound acting in the same manner; however, its toxin from the epibenthic dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus can be bioaccumulated in fishes to a much more harmful concentration without causing mortality of the fish (Naar et al. 2007).\n\n14.3.4.2 Fish Kills From Algal Agents Other than K. brevis\n\nAdditional investigations on pathology of fish will show other related agents being responsible for fish mortalities. When fish kills occurred in estuarine aquaculture facilities in Maryland, they were determined to be caused by at least two isolated karlotoxins from the dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum (as K. micrum) by Deeds et al. (2006). Karlodinium veneficum has been reported from Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, has caused fish kills in Maryland and South Carolina, and is considered a cosmopolitan species. Fish from kills near Perth, Western Australia, examined by the senior author had diagnostic epithelial necrosis and shortening or loss of the secondary lamellae of the gills, the primary signs observed in the sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus), a common fish in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Concentrations of toxins in filtered water from fish kills rapidly killed the experimental fish.\n\nAlso, the dinoflagellate Pfiesteria piscicida can produce lesions, and at one time was considered the cause of ulcerated mycosis of Atlantic menhaden, resulting in fish kills along the Atlantic coast to the GoM (Dykstra and Kane 2000) (Figure 14.7). Considerable research has gone into the cause of these lesions, and now Blazer et al. (1999) and Vandersea et al (2006) have determined that the primary agent is the pathogenic oomycete Aphanomyces invadans. Pfiesteria piscicida and later Pseudopfiesteria shumwayae (see Litaker et al. 2005) were originally thought to secrete potent exotoxins that caused the lesions, acute fish kills, and human disease in the mid-Atlantic estuaries. However, bioassays with P. shumwayae and larval fish revealed no toxin was emitted and mortality occurred only in treatments where fish and dinospores demonstrated physical contact. Dinospores swarmed toward and attached to the skin, actively feeding on and denuding fish of their epidermis and killing them by micropredation (Vogelbein et al. 2002).\n\nSome dinoflagellates produce a toxin harmful and even deadly to humans and marine mammals, but not recognized as causing fish kills. One of these toxins is saxitoxin (STX) puffer fish poisoning, which can also on occasion include paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). The signs of eating toxins accumulated in puffers progress from tingling and numbness of the mouth, lips, tongue, face, and fingers; to paralysis of extremities, nausea, vomiting, and ataxia; to decreasing breathing and possibly to death by asphyxiation. The toxin occurs in the Gulf of Mexico as determined by Landsberg et al. (2006) and Deeds et al. (2008). The toxins can be produced by Pyrodinium by means of the shellfish, Alexandrium cohorticula, A. minutum, A. ostenfeldii, Gymnodinium catenatum, and some freshwater cyanobacteria, all of which occur in the Gulf of Mexico, but verified cases caused by the toxins in the GoM come from the bioluminescent Pyrodinium bahamense. Within all puffer species, they are stored in the skin, muscle, and viscera with an emphasis on ovary, making those structures a risk for human consumption. The toxin in the southern puffer (Sphoeroides nephelus) from the Gulf side of Florida is much less in quantity than in fish from the Atlantic side, where it can remain not depurated for over a year. However, one should realize that toxin produced by one strain of a species often does not represent that production for the species. For example, the toxin for PSP produced by 17 strains of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense had a wide range in the amount based on mouse bioassays. Furthermore, 15 sub-strains taken from one of those strains also had a considerable range in the amount, and that toxin from two different strains differed in the derivatives produced (see Thessen et al. 2009).\n\nThe golden alga Prymnesium parvum occurs worldwide, but it is best known from inland waters of Texas and estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico. Under certain environmental stresses, it produces massive fish kills, including kills of mussels and clams. Even though the alga has been identified from many locations, it often does not cause mortalities. Allelopathy has been shown to be one reason. That is a biological phenomenon by which an organism, in this case a concurrent cyanobacteria (a prokaryotic phytoplankton that has bacteria-like cellular features such as lacking a well-defined nucleus and membrane-bound organelles), produces one or more substances that influence the growth, survival, or reproduction of another organism. James et al. (2011) showed that one substance, the cyanotoxin microcystin-LR, inhibited growth of P. parvum, but the necessary concentration could also kill a number of other aquatic organisms.\n\nAnother non-dinoflagellate alga that attracts attention is a complex of diatoms responsible for “amnesic shellfish poisoning” (ASP). Most diatoms constitute highly proactive phytoplankton in estuaries, supporting both planktonic and benthic food webs, but the colonial Pseudo-nitzschia spp. produce a domoic acid toxin (DA) that causes ASP. The toxin accumulates in bivalves, but ASP is most common along the Pacific Coast in upwelling systems where seabirds and marine mammals die from it, and, consequently, marine resource management agencies both along the Pacific Coast and the GoM close shellfish beds when DA levels are high because ASP causes loss of memory in humans.\n\nDiatoms in the genus Pseudo-nitzschia occur frequently in the northern Gulf in offshore and estuarine plankton, on sediments, and in both shellfish tissues and seawater in Mississippi Sound as well as in Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas (Dortch et al. 1997; Macintyre et al. 2011). Although not all species of this genus are toxic, and no case of human ASP has been reported from the GoM, when counts of the diatom and concentrations of DA in oyster tissue exceed federal guidelines, oyster reefs are temporarily closed. However, because DA occurs in GoM shellfishes, because it is produced by several species in the genus, and because it imposes a major human threat, it is presently being investigated in some detail. Even though the disease is considered a problem in high salinity waters, various species occur over a salinity range of 1 to >35 ppt in Louisiana, where oysters are typically harvested in 10–20 ppt (Thessen et al. 2005). These authors identified seven species in low salinity waters, and some are toxigenic. Much has been learned about these diatoms from laboratory work as well as from species around the world. Experimental studies have shown that the problem is extremely complex. Different strains of one species isolated from the same water sample exhibited broad differences in growth rate and toxin content when cultures contained different nitrogen sources, ammonia, nitrite, and urea (Thessen et al. 2009). Two clones of one species produce toxins; however, they preferentially utilized different nitrogen sources. Two of nine isolates of another species and two of five of still another produced DA, but the content varied by orders of magnitude. If that does not exemplify the complexity of the problem, then it should be noted that DA, in addition to being accumulated in bivalves, also occurs in tissues of zooplankton, crustaceans, echinoderms, echiurans, tunicates, and fishes; it also occurs in tissues of marine mammals, birds, and humans, all of which could be killed by it, as well as occurring in sediments, demonstrating stable transfer through the marine food web and abiotically to the benthos (Trainer et al. 2012). The latter review included considerably more information on the cosmopolitan nature and complexity in taxonomy, toxin production, toxin storage/release, bloom initiation/retention, and nutrient requirements for some of the 14 recognized species, and also mentioned that preliminary work suggested the necessity for the presence of an epibiont bacterium before sexual reproduction could occur in some clones of one species grown in axenic culture.\n\nTo reiterate the aspect of human illnesses from HABs, those that occur worldwide result from harmful algal toxins and their derivatives including saxitoxins (STX, including some paralytic shellfish poisoning [PSP]), okadaic acid (diarrheic shellfish poisoning), brevetoxins amnesic shellfish poisoning [ASP] (neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP)), ciguatoxins (ciguatera fish poisoning), domoic acid (am/domoic acid poisoning), azaspiracid toxins (azaspiracid poisoning), and hepatoxins and microcystins. Dinoflagellates produce all these toxins except for domoic acid, which as discussed above is produced primarily by diatom species of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia, and hepatoxins and microcystins produced by cyanobacteria such as species of Anabaena and Microcystis. In addition to being produced by dinoflagellates, saxitoxin can be produced by several species of cyanobacteria, and brevetoxin can be produced by some species of raphidophytes. Deadly phycotoxins include domoic acid, saxitoxins, and ciguatoxins. Perhaps the deadliest of the phycotoxins are the STXs because of the rate of human mortality associated with exposure and the broad geographic range of distribution of STX-producing organisms. Saxitoxins produced by multiple dinoflagellate species as well as several species of cyanobacteria and can cause PSP. Moreover, the toxins can be transferred and bioaccumulate throughout aquatic food webs and therefore be vectored to terrestrial biota, including humans (Deeds et al. 2008). Ciguatera is more common in Mexican and eastern Caribbean reefs than in the northern Gulf (e.g., Okolodkov et al. 2007).\n\nAt least 15 species of Prorocentrum, Dinophysis, and Phalacroma are known to produce okadaic acid (OA) or its derivatives in the world’s oceans, and those species occur in the GoM. However, only isolates of Dinophysis cf. ovum, Prorocentrum texanum, P. hoffmannianum, and P. lima have been demonstrated to produce OA in the Gulf. The toxin accumulates in bivalves, and the human disease associated with eating such bivalves is termed “diarrhetic shellfish poisoning”; conclusive evidence pointing to OA by itself causing fish disease has not been established.\n\n14.3.5 Cold Kill\n\nCold kills appear conspicuous after a period of low temperature. They, however, are restricted to shallow waters and not as common as one might believe. Under normal conditions, when a cold front passes through an area, most fishes and invertebrates bury or migrate to more tolerable areas and do not die. Typically, it is the rate at which the temperature drops rather than the temperature per se that kills fish. Fish kills are more prevalent in the typically warmer southern waters of Texas and Florida than in the more temperate northern Gulf of Mexico where the rate change during freezing conditions is not as great and the fishes are more able to acclimate. A good example of this situation occurred in Mississippi in January 1973 and was studied in some detail by Overstreet (1974). During the evenings of January 13–14, 1973, a thin sheet of ice covered the surface of Paige and Cooper bayous in Jackson County, Mississippi. On the 15th, these bayous, approximately 1 to 5 m (about 3 to 16 ft) deep and completely fresh during this time in the year, became covered by a layer of the striped mullet, Mugil cephalus, which had surfaced and died. By January 16, the 0.6 m (2 ft) tide washed out the majority of fish, but a minimal estimation of a few hundred thousand carcasses still remained. A large number of shellcrackers, bream, bass, and catfish actively fed when local residents, who frequently fed them, placed food in the water, suggesting that no toxin occurred in the water and no low concentration of oxygen existed. In the morning of the 16th, several coastal habitats were inspected for dead and living fish, and corresponding values were obtained for salinity, chlorosity, and calcium in the water. A few other bayous also contained dead striped mullet such as the Ocean Springs Small Craft Harbor, which contained additional dead species of the striped mullet such as white mullet (Mugil curema), Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus), and fat sleeper (Dormitator maculatus).\n\nFishermen caught striped mullet during and after January 13 and 14 in nearby Graveline Bay, Bayou Porteaux, and other areas where no dead fish was observed. The unusual thing about the areas from which the mullet survived was that the water had a salinity greater than 6 ppt. At least the dying fish from Paige Bayou also exhibited starvation, had distended gallbladders with associated leaking bile (Figure 14.8), and demonstrated high levels of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolites and endrin pesticide residues unlike mullet samples from where no fish had died. An average-sized dead mullet was 230 millimeters (mm) (9 inches [in]) standard length, with a weight of 255 grams (g) (9 ounces [oz]), and large fish such as these are more susceptible to a variety of stresses. Foci of hepatic necrosis and an abundance of lipid material but not glycogen were demonstrated in hepatocytes of the fish livers from the mass mortalities relative to control samples. Far fewer ciliate protozoan parasites and no monogenoid or copepod infested the gills of dying mullet, and those parasites were also common in Davis Bayou where there was no mortality.\n\nExperimental studies (e.g., Cummings 1955; McFarland 1965) have shown that when the striped mullet is gradually transferred from seawater to freshwater, it can regulate serum ion concentration, muscle ion concentration, and osmolarity and surface permeability may be reduced by prolactin in relationship with temperature. At least those dying mullet in water less than 6 ppt salinity with 4.5 g chloride/L and 94 parts per million (ppm) calcium probably had a failing ion-osmoregulatory mechanism and were unable to acclimate to the rapidly dropping temperature.\n\nOn January 25 along Cooper and Paige bayous and on January 22 in a canal off Mary Walker Bayou, each location had a few thousand bloated and decomposing floating dead fish with attached filamentous algae as long as 4 cm (1.6 in). At the same time, healthy mullet without any indication of attached algae were present (see later comment on pseudo-fish kills). In his lengthy discussion about all aspects of the mortalities, Overstreet (1974) discounted with adequate evidence several hypotheses for the mortalities, presented by interviews with longtime residents of the area.\n\nThe most severe cold fronts appear to affect the coastal biota of Florida, Texas, and occasionally in between. Severe cold fronts, presumably with air temperature less than −12 °C (10 °F), recorded for coastal Mississippi include at least January 1899, February 1914, January 1985, and December 1989 (Bergeron 2015). Cold fronts passing over the shallow waters of the Gulf in western Florida occasionally result in chilled and helpless or dead fish with massive numbers washed ashore. In waters of Cedar Keys and north, most fish in a 3-day 1917 cold wave left the coastal waters for protection from the rapid temperature drop. Dead fish were usually small, 5–8 cm (2–3 in), accompanied by crabs and small shrimp. Near Tampa, mullet, grunts, and jacks died, and further south toward Key West, “tons” of fish became numb, washed ashore, and had to be buried to avoid the stench (Finch 1917). Finch (1917) even quoted a Federal fisheries biologist as saying that a benefit of that cold spell to oysters was the near eradication of a parasite that had previously been killing the oysters near Cedar Key and Port Inglis.\n\nWillcox (1887) reported that thousands of smelly fish killed in bays and rivers from Cedar Keys to the mouth of the Caloosahatchee River at Punta Rassa by an 1886 freeze. The numbers and species of dead fish, including oysters, differed by location, but few actually occurred along the shore of the Gulf, and those that did occurred near inlets and probably resulted from tidewater carrying them out from the bays. Nine freezing episodes at Sanibel Island, Florida, from 1886 through 1936 were reported by Storey and Gudger (1936), who listed the 1886 one as the worst for both fishes and vegetation. The air temperature in Fort Myers was −4.4 °C (24 °F) and that near the salt water was −2.2 °C (28 °F) and lasted for a day; water temperature never reached 0 °C (32 °F). About 1.3 cm (0.5 in) of ice formed in the cisterns and rainbarrels; the weather turned warm and it rained after the freeze. Generally, the local common fish species often died, but in some cases the larger fishes became lethargic and recovered before they washed ashore. Only the hardiest of fish at Sanibel Island can tolerate a water temperature rapidly dropping below 15.6 °C (60 °F). Lethargic fish have often been gathered and eaten in Florida as well as Mississippi. Those in Florida, especially those already putrefying, are often gathered and used as fertilizer. Apparently, fishing typically recovers within 2 to 3 weeks after a freeze. Another major fish kill in southern Florida occurred during January 27 through 29, 1940, when minimum air temperatures ranged from −0.6 °C (31 °F) in Miami to 10 °C (50 °F) in Key West. Most of the killed fish included bonefish, moon fish, several different snappers, grunts, porgies, mullet, and jacks. Lesser numbers of several fishes also died or became lethargic (Miller 1940). An estimate of nearly 450,000 kilograms (kg) (1,000,000 pounds [lb]) of stunned but good edible specimens were gathered and sold by fishermen from Key Largo to Key West. Digital thermal infrared data acquired by a NOAA-5 meteorological satellite followed three consecutive cold fronts which crossed South Florida and northern Bahamas in January 1977 (Roberts et al. 1982). The third and most severe frontal system crossed the shallow, carbonate Florida Bay and depressed water temperature for 7–8 days below 16 °C (61 °F), a thermal threshold for most reef corals. Water temperature in Florida Bay decreased to at least 13 °C (55 °F). Coral and fish kills occurred along the Florida Reef Tract, with mortality at Dry Tortugas estimated at 91 %. Low water temperature was suggested as the major factor-inducing stress in this reef system. Roberts et al. (1982) discussed works by others indicating extensive drowned and killed Holocene coral reefs in the southeastern Florida shelf margin during the first stages of shallow, widespread flooding of the shelf during the sea level rise occurring approximately 7000 years Before Present. They considered the topography of the southeastern Florida shelf and other high latitude reef areas as probably being dramatically affected by the combination of reef growth and severe cold water stress.\n\nTexas is probably the most vulnerable area on earth to cold kills. It occupies approximately 900,000 ha (3,400 mi2) of bay waters with offshore depths being only 1.8–2.4 m (6–8 ft) deep. Polar fronts push south to the southern part of the state and occasionally are strong enough to cross the Gulf of Mexico and over the Isthmus of Tehuantepec down to Nicaragua on the Pacific coast. Fish kills extend south into Mexico (Gunter 1947). The shallow bays of Texas are connected to the GoM by typically narrow passes; consequently, the rapid drop in temperature often traps the fishes within the bays. Gunter and Hildebrand (1951) described animal kills occurring in 1951 in and around Aransas Pass. The storm with winds up to 64 km/h (40 mi/h) dropped temperatures below freezing on January 29 and remained there for 5 days, with air temperatures as low as −8 °C (18 °F). Gunter (1941) also described that the animals killed from a front passing through the same general area during January 18–22, 1940. In both cases, there were several million fish and other animals killed by the cold and numerous others numbed. Those two papers considered the freezes somewhat equivalent catastrophes to those of 1924, 1899, and 1886, but certainly not as severe as those in 1941 and 1949, although considerable mortality occurred in the 1947 freeze. Gunter (1947) considered a catastrophic cold kill to occur on the average of every 14 years from 1856 to 1940 with less damaging ones occurring at shorter intervals. Biologists of the Game, Fish, and Oyster Commission estimated that the amount of fish killed in 1951 ranged from 27 to 41 million kg (30,000–45,000 tons). The dead species differed in different areas, but most included the hardhead catfish, spotted seatrout, red drum, black drum (Pogonias cromis), mullets, silver perch, spot, Atlantic croaker, bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli), striped anchovy (Anchoa hepsetus), Atlantic cutlassfish (Trichiurus lepturus), toadfish, and other fishes as well as the brown shrimp, a variety of crabs, bivalves including oysters, and the occasional brown pelican, lesser scaup, white egret, and other birds plus loggerhead turtle. Based on photos of windrows roughly 0.4 km (approximately 1,500 ft) long of mass mortalities in Laguna Madre, it was concluded that southern area also incurred heavy fish kills extending for some 50 km (30 mi) along the upper Laguna shore, with lesser damage in the lower Laguna. Many of the fish as well as clams, gastropods, and starfish that died along the shore of the Gulf of Mexico became lethargic and rolled up on the beach by the heavy surf caused by the norther. In the 1980s, Texas coasts experienced three winter mass mortalities with 14 million fish killed in December 1983, 11 million in February 1989, and another 6 million in December 1989 (McEachron et al. 1994). McEachron et al. (1994) used a stepwise, standardized approach to sampling, which they admitted caused an underestimated mortality count, especially for small (<200 mm [8 in]) animals as well as the illegal activities of fishermen removing dead and dying fish prior to the census. The composition of the fish species accounting for over 50 % in each freeze were striped mullet (Mugil cephalus), pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides), Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), and bay anchovy. They noted that the size classes of a species affected varied between some of the freezes, but not all species, e.g., pinfish. This observation they felt led to an “instantaneous picture” of the species population structure at the time of the kill. Hence, the recommendation to fisheries managers was to respond to mass mortalities by imposing regulations to reduce fishing efforts immediately following the event to allow recruitment and compensatory mechanisms to take place.\n\nCommercial fishing after the cold kills, at least the 1940 episode, showed a dramatic decline (Gunter 1941). While there was some difference in the decline among commercial catches from the regions of Galveston, Matagorda, Aransas, and Laguna Madre, the red drum, spotted seatrout, and black drum all declined by 78 % while that of the southern flounder declined by 95 %. However, dead flounder do not float and because of their shape they are not easily trawled or dredged, so some mortalities could have easily escaped notice. He also tabulated data for catches after the 1940 freeze from both the year of the freeze and of the prior year and noted that there was no difference in decline from catches in the Gulf of Mexico. But there was in the bays, where the water was much shallower. It took about 3 years for the commercial catch to recover. Texas fishermen seem to agree that fish will be scarce for a few months after severe cold spells; whereas those from Florida and Mississippi estimate a 2- to 3-week period. As suggested above, this difference can be explained primarily by many of the fish in Florida, Mississippi, and offshore Texas migrating to more tolerable water or recovering after a water temperature rise after being affected but not killed.\n\nThe nice thing about cold kills is that residents as well as numerous animals such as piscivorous birds and raccoons make a healthy feast of the freshly dead or numbed fish! Such is not the case for fish killed by most other causes.\n\n14.3.6 Pseudo-Fish Kills\n\n“Pseudo-fish kills” is our term for fish that had died a week or two earlier and submerged, only to undergo bacterial degeneration during the warm period following the cold weather. Cases of pseudo-fish kills also can occur from fish kills other than those caused by low temperatures. Metabolic byproducts or gases consisting of methane, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide are produced, becoming trapped in the body cavity. Once enough gas accumulates, the body becomes lighter and the dead fish floats to the surface. Many local citizens are sure they see fish in the state of dying and report a fish kill to state agencies, research facilities, and newspapers. Our examination of such fish, always of decayed and smelly fish usually with attached green algae, indicated that the actual mortality had taken place during the prior cold snap or other mortality event.\n\n14.3.7 Heat Kills\n\nBecause the rapid rate change from normal to low temperatures is usually what kills fish during a freezing period, one might expect a rapid rate change from normal to high temperature to be the cause of fish kills. Theoretically that could happen, except that even when the temperature of water starts increasing at a relatively rapid rate, most fish readily escape to relatively cooler habitats. There are situations, usually those resulting from anthropogenic changes involving heated effluents, which can kill aquatic organisms. Also, there are cases where fish get inadvertently washed up into a vulnerable position and are inescapably trapped in a body of water that rapidly increases in temperature before reduction of acceptable oxygen levels, killing fish. That situation is rare. Usually when the water temperature is increased, it takes a long enough period that eutrophication takes place and fish actually die from oxygen depletion rather than from a high temperature. Probably most important, this increased temperature reduces resistance to diseases and allows the agents to become established and to become more pathogenic. In such cases, the weakened fish become readily devored as prey items before they die from disease; they are not witnessed as dead bodies. Complicated changes in normal parasite life cycles can occur such that a parasite such as a trematode or nematode will produce an infection at a different time of year than it is typically found in the normal environment. Because of the seasonal biology of the fish, infections might take place in an unpredictable situation during an atypical season, resulting in fish death or morbidity.\n\nWe know of no marine example in the Gulf of Mexico involving parasites relative to thermal pollution; however, Khan and Hooper (2007) evaluated the effects of thermal discharge on the parasites of the winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) near the coastal fossil fuel generating plant at Holyrood, Newfoundland, Canada. The water discharged into Conception Bay, but the temperature change extended up to only 1 m (3 ft) below the surface, which was 3–4 °C (37–39 °F) in May and 7–8 °C (45–46 °F) in June compared with benthic water at 0 °C (32 °F). Only summer samples were taken, although sampling occurred at a few reference sites. Biological features such as condition factor and organ indices sampled below the plume revealed no significant difference with reference samples except that the male somatic index was significantly greater than that of the other two sampled groups. The parasites, however, were another matter. Metacercariae of the heterophyid Cryptocotyle lingua had a greater prevalence and mean intensity of infection than reference samples, whereas the mobile peritrich ciliate Trichodina jadranica and the monogenoid Gyrodactylus pleuronecti occurred significantly less on the gills of fish samples beneath the plume when compared with those from the reference sites. Additionally, four internal parasites, one myxosporidian and three trematodes, were significantly more abundant in the reference samples, suggesting an environmental change-affected transmission of the parasites when exposed to the thermal effluent. The salmonid brown trout (Salmo trutta) showed an attraction to the hot water effluent from the Forsmark nuclear power plant located in the low salinity coast of the Bothnian Sea associated with the Baltic Sea, Sweden. Thulin (1987) reported a few of 401 Swedish fish with skeletal abnormalities, 22 % with the leech Piscicola geometra, and 9 % with the copepod Caligus lacustris, all apparently unexpected findings. Khan and Hooper (2007) provided several freshwater examples involving parasite indicators of thermal effluents, but we only mention one (Camp et al. 1982) in which the prevalence and abundance of metacercaria of the trematode Ornithodiplostomum ptchocheilus in the western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) over a 53-month study expressed a fluctuating difference in infections in thermal effluent and ambient temperatures during 31 of those months in a thermal reservoir in South Carolina. The thermal effluent initiated the trematode life cycle a few months earlier than that occurred in the ambient water, with both shedding of the cercariae and recruitment of the metacercariae being affected; but so were the nesting and foraging activities of the waterfowl definitive hosts that tend to prefer the warmer water in winter and cooler water in the summer. Of course the biology of the fish and snail were also affected.\n\nTo take complications and thermal interactions one step further, the effect of viruses on cyanobacteria should be considered. For example, Microcystis aeruginosa is a common species responsible for blooms and for producing HAB toxins. This situation is usually considered as part of the relatively simple eutrophication process. However, there are several undescribed viruses that infect the “blue-green algae” including M. aeruginosa, and which probably influence mortality. They are likely a primary factor in determining plankton crashes; moreover, it is temperature that seems to control the crashes (Honjo et al. 2006). Paerl and Huisman (2008) stress the point that rising temperatures, often above 25 °C (77 °F), favor cyanobacteria over diatoms, green algae, and other phytoplankton species. The resulting stratification earlier in spring and destratification later in autumn increased residence times and reduced vertical mixing. More intense precipitation with associated increased nutrient discharge in conjunction with the viral infections all ultimately promoted blooms and crashes with their associated fish kills.\n\nHot water pouring into a cooling canal from the Florida Power & Light Company fossil fuel generating plant at Turkey Point in 1969 killed thousands of fish. The company was operating under a special permit to discharge water into Biscayne Bay at temperatures higher than allowed by pollution laws. These mortalities occurred before the company finished construction of two nuclear generating plants. In addition to the dead fish, there was a variety of dead crustaceans, mollusks, corals, and algae occurring up to 1.4 km (1 mi) from the outfall during early summer in 1969. A virtually complete kill of aquatic organisms occurred over an area of about 8.4 × 105 m2 (200 acres) (Laws 2000). Because of those expected harmful effects, Roessler and Tabb (1974) conducted an extensive survey and determined that average temperature elevations above ambient summer water temperatures caused the depletion in the biota. The area which was elevated above 4 °C (39 °F) was approximately 30 ha (75 acres), the area between 3 (37 °F) and 4 °C (39 °F) was approximately 40 ha (100 acres), and the area between 2 (36 °F) and 3 °C (37 °F) was approximately 50 ha (125 acres). A total area of about 120 ha (300 acres) showed a decline in abundance of biota that was statistically measurable for at least part of the year. A relatively rapid recolonization took place during the winter in a portion of this area. The inner barren zone of about 20 ha (50 acres) recovered slowly because of the death of the rhizomes of the turtle grass and changes in the sediment. The optimal temperature for maximum biodiversity was between 26 (79 °F) and 28 °C (82 °F); about 50 % of the animals were excluded when the temperature was between 30 (86 °F) and 34 °C (94 °F). About 75 % were excluded when the temperature was between 35 (95 °F) and 39 °C (102 °F), over the thermal tolerance range (TTR). Most of the animals occurred where the red algae complex of species of Laurencia and Digenea was abundant; whereas few animals occurred where no algae or seagrasses occurred. These two authors predicted that an increased temperature with increased water flow in conjunction with the nuclear generators would harm an increased area without implementation of alternate methods of cooling. No indication of pollution as measured by standard chemical indicators resulted from secondary treated sewage from a local sewage treatment plant, suggesting that the kill in 1969 was caused entirely by elevated temperatures resulting from the power plant and not eutrophication. Another kill of about 2,000 fish occurred in June 1971 when the discharge water from the fossil fuel plant again reached 40 °C (104 °F) (Associated Press 1971).\n\nThe above case uses both reports of counted or estimated dead fish and reports documenting lack of or less abundant catches of fish relative to other reference collections. More often when dealing with temperature, nothing exists but circumstantial or theoretical data. This is especially true with temperature because numerous factors influence other factors, and conditions are seldom repeated so they can be adequately compared. For example, Cairns et al. (1975) provides a good article on the effects of temperature upon toxicity of chemicals to aquatic animals. The amount of literature is extensive but mostly based on laboratory studies and not adequate to make “scientifically justifiable generalizations.” The number of variables is extensive, especially when including the interaction of temperature with what type or degree of toxicity; what chemical, state of compound, or mixture of compounds; what organism, in what life stage, and under what physiological condition; and environmental influences such as salinity, pH, and alkalinity. Temperature can be both a lethal factor and a controlling factor but without consistent thresholds. Temperatures outside the zone of tolerance fall in the zone of resistance, and the length of time before death is useful for trying to determine the cause of thermal death. For example, because tissue anoxia occurs at high temperatures, the toxicants act differently: copper increases metabolic demand and zinc blocks oxygen uptake by the gills, and either may be rendered more active physiologically by an increase in temperature. The body temperature of most fishes and other animals, except marine mammals and birds, corresponds almost exactly with the water temperature, taking about 3 min/1 °C for heat exchange; and the rate of metabolism undergoes an approximately twofold increase with every 10 °C (50 °F) rise in temperature, commonly referred to as Q 10. Cairns et al. (1975) provide and discuss the effects of temperature on a wide variety of toxicants; however, few are examples from the Gulf of Mexico and most deal with experimental studies. DeLorenzo et al. (2009) showed that temperature, salinity, and life stages of grass shrimp all affect the degree of toxicity of common pesticides to this shrimp. Lloyd (1987) provided more detail on interactions and modification of the response caused by variation of physiochemical conditions. An experimental study (Bao et al. 2008) also demonstrated that the effects of temperature above the TTR significantly increased the toxicity and hence the ecological risks of two common anti-fouling biocides (chlorothalonil and copper pyrithione) to a copepod (Tigriopus japonicus) and a dinoflagellate (Pyrocystis lunula). Male copepods were more sensitive to both compounds than the females, and the toxicity of the two biocides differed.\n\n14.3.8 Hypersalinity (Over-Salinity)\n\nIn areas of the GoM where levels of salinity can become great enough to kill fish, the levels seldom actually reach those high concentrations. The best known is Laguna Madre of the Texas coast; this lagoon, approximately 210 km (131 mi) long by 6.5 km (4 mi) wide, is separated from the Gulf of Mexico by a narrow barrier known as Padre Island. Under normal conditions, commercial fisheries production is greater in this lagoon that in any other region of Texas (Gunter 1947). During dry years, the salinity may reach three times that of normal seawater (about 32 ppt), killing vast numbers of fish (Gunter, on our reprint, crossed out the words “specific gravity” and replaced it with “salinity”). Even though not well documented, large kills occur approximately every 10 years, but minor kills occur every year. The number of kills probably increases as the lagoon fills. We are not aware of the development of any recent artificial pass leading to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nEvery few years in Mississippi (because of the prevailing winds), the salinity in the bays and bayous will vary between 0 and ≥40 ppt. During the periods of high salinity, we have not seen fish kills, but we note that the components of the biota differed dramatically from that expected. For example, we have occasionally seen fishes such as the Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), lookdown (Selene vomer), and Atlantic moonfish (Selene setapinnis) as well as the bottlenose dolphin abundant in the Back Bay of Biloxi.\n\n14.3.9 Sulfate Reduction and Anaerobic Methane Oxidation\n\nA different environment occurs in deepwater bathyal areas of the Gulf of Mexico associated with hydrate-bearing sediments where crude oil and methane advect through fault conduits to the seafloor. These areas can be considered toxic to the surrounding aerobic fauna that occupies most of the seafloor, but the occupants come in contact with different chemical compositions. The oil and gas seeps located at 590–630 m (1,900–2,100 ft) at 6–9 °C (43–48 °F) are typically overlain by chemo-synthetic communities consisting of thiotrophic bacterial (e.g., Beggiatoa spp.) mats, methane atrophic mussels (Bathymodiolus spp.), and other symbiotic associations. These well-established geologic areas are dynamic, resulting in fluctuating faunas within and surrounding them. For example, bottom waters contain about 29 mM/L of dissolved sulfate, but pore fluids from oil and gas seeps are depleted down to 0.3 mM/L sulfate. That ambient bottom water contains less than 1 μM/L sulfide, but the sediments contain 1 mM/L and all pore fluids from seeps contain up to 20 mM/L, with those concentrations in gas seeps generally higher than those in oil seeps at the same depth. This inverse relationship between sulfate and sulfide results from bacterial consumption of sulfate and concomitant production of hydrogen-sulfide during anaerobic sulfate reduction. Bacterial mats of Beggiatoa spp. at the seawater–sediment interface obtain their energy by oxidizing hydrogen-sulfides and producing molecular sulfur. In contrast, the Bathymodiolus spp. mussels from the hydrocarbon seeps, but not hydrothermal vents, contain mostly methanotropic bacterial symbionts (e.g., Aharon and Fu 2000). Gas and crude oil escape by venting and seepage is ongoing, but major expulsion events are estimated to take place at a frequency of every 300 or even less than a hundred years (Roberts 2011). Gas hydrate, an ice-like substance comprised of a gas molecule like methane surrounded by a crystalline cage of water molecules as ice, concentrates vast amounts of methane in water at depths greater than 300–500 m (980–1640 ft) and contributes to seafloor hazards. In the GoM, the gas hydrates undergo repeated near-surface formation and dissociation varying seasonally and with warm-water loop eddies. However, the largest natural geohazard associated with hydrates and methane release involves periodic landslides (Hutchinson et al. 2011). Anaerobic oxidation of methane is a microbial process taking place in anoxic marine sediments where oxidization occurs with different terminal electron acceptors such as sulfate, nitrate, nitrite, and metals.\n\n14.3.10 Sediments and Drilling Fluids\n\nSedimentation resulting from storms and river flow can have a major effect on mortality of fish and covers invertebrates. Examination of gills of morbid or dead fish allows differentiation among fish killed by cold or toxins (usually reddish unless acid, nitrate in freshwater fishes), oxygen depletion (pink or white), or sediments (mud, sand, or eroded tissue).\n\nDrilling fluids (muds) are used by offshore petroleum-drilling operations. These aqueous suspensions consist of a variety of components that are pumped down the center of the drill bit and have a composition that varies with the needs of the drilling operation. Examples are lubrication, cooling, prevention of intrusion of seawater into the borehole, antibacterial action, suspension of drill cuttings, and capture of hydrogen sulfide. The fluid may be partially or entirely discharged into the surrounding water during and after the procedures. Because of the toxic nature of some of the fluids, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) conducted some laboratory tests to determine whether some substances interfered with fertilization and normal development of fish and invertebrates (Crawford 1983). Different fluids had different toxic effects. As an example, a concentration of 10 ppt of some fluids caused the diminution of heartbeat rate of the model killifish; concentrations of 1 ppt had an effect on hatching and coordination of swimming of the fry of that fish. Some fluids had no effect on the fish, and no one fluid could be considered typical. Consequently, it is hard to evaluate the effect of drilling fluids on wild populations, but animal communities surrounding drilling operations can be compared with those on nearby reference sites not undergoing such activities.\n\nThe following sections treat mortality, health, and indicators of specific groups of animals, starting with fishes and separate from the above sections that treated general mass mortalities.\n\n14.4.1 Infectious Parasites and Diseases\n\nThe status of fishes and the fish communities in the GoM needs to be understood relative to natural and contaminated conditions so that microbial and parasitic diseases and fish mortalities can be assessed critically. Helpful background information on many of the important model fishes such as Atlantic croaker, bay anchovy, hardhead catfish, Gulf menhaden, spot, and pinfish has been provided by Lewis et al. (2007). Comparative data are also available for the effects of hurricanes on these fish assemblages (Lewis et al. 2011).\n\nBecause the majority of the fish that die in the GoM usually are not seen or sampled since they become part of the food web, the impact of parasite-induced mortality on a population is difficult to determine (Scott and Dobson 1989; McCallum and Dobson 1995; Rousset et al. 1996). Consequently, statistical approaches have been established to estimate mortality. Lester (1984) presented six methods to estimate mortality caused by parasites in wild fish populations. Shaw et al. (1998) reviewed 49 published wildlife host-macroparasite systems and determined that in 90 % of the data sets, the negative binomial distribution provided the statistically satisfactory fit. This statistical analysis has been used by many to account for estimates of the mortality in populations due to parasite infections (May and Anderson 1978; Dietz 1982; Kennedy 1984; Scott 1987; Shaw and Dobson 1995).\n\nStatistical evidence of parasites controlling the abundance of a population has been demonstrated by Hudson and colleagues (Hudson 1986; Hudson and Dobson 1990, 1997a, b; Hudson et al. 1985, 1992, 1998; Dobson and Hudson 1992) using the interaction of the nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis on the red grouse, Lagopus lagopus scoticus. Bruning et al. (1992) developed a population-dynamic model for phytoplankton and the impact of fungal parasites on their populations. They calculated that four parameters are needed to determine the loss-rate: prevalence of infection, developmental time for the parasite, specific growth rate of the uninfected host, and the difference between the infected and uninfected host mortality due to factors other than parasitism. Knudsen et al. (2002) used a long-term study with indirect methods to indicate that the nematode Cystidicola farionis increased the mortality rate in its final host (Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus). They indicated parasite-induced host mortality in hosts older than 10 years. The convex age-abundance curve indicates that heavily infected fish disappear from the population. This loss of fish has been demonstrated in other studies (Pennycuick 1971; Kennedy 1984; Esch 1994). Krkošek et al. (2007) used mathematical and empirical data to relate the influence of the copepod Lepeophtherius salmonis on farmed salmon, which get repeatedly infected. Not only does the parasite cause mortality of these farmed salmon, it also causes over 80 % mortality of wild juvenile salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) in the waters adjacent to the farms. Those authors postulated that local extinction of wild pink salmon could occur if parasite-outbreaks abate the ecosystem’s ability to support the wild population.\n\n14.4.1.1 Bacterial\n\nDuring certain periods throughout most years in most areas of the GoM, lesions occur commonly on specific fishes. These sores or ulcers usually occur in fins, tail, mouth, or near anus, and regulatory agencies typically refer to those lesions or to the infected host fish as “red sore,” “tail rot,” “fin rot,” or “mouth rot” (Figures 14.9, 14.10, and 14.11). Diagnoses usually include positive results for Vibrio, Pseudomonas, and other bacteria, and, if the salinity is low, counterpart infections involve Aeromonas, Flexibacter, and other bacteria. Causes can include injury from predator wounds, trawling or other fishing activities, harsh water quality conditions, internal or external parasites, plasmid or viral infections, co-infection with other bacteria, or even primary bacterial infections. Most often, aggravation by any one of those stressors impairs the fish skin or alimentary tract, enhancing bacterial invasion and growth. To take this process further, sometimes a wound with associated necrotic host tissue supports establishment and growth of barnacles and other fouling agents. Couch and Nimmo (1974) observed over a 10-year period in Escambia Bay, FL, a high prevalence of fin rot syndrome associated with mortalities in Atlantic croaker and spot during warm weather and oxygen depletion. They were able to demonstrate experimentally the induction of fin rot syndrome in 90 % of the exposed spot to a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) (3–5 μg/L of Aroclor 1254) with an associated 80 % mortality, but no attempt was made to isolate the bacteria. In most cases in the northern Gulf, the lesions undergo repair in the absence of stressors, and mortalities are not conspicuous.\n\nThe most common lesions in marine and estuarine GoM fishes involve Vibrio and related bacteria and some form of stress playing a role in the disease process. Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio anguillarum, Vibrio carchariae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio damselae, Vibrio ordalii, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio vulnificus all have been reported to cause disease in marine fish and require salt to grow (Colwell and Grimes 1984) (Figures 14.9, 14.10, 14.11, 14.12, and 14.13). As methods for identification become more sophisticated, strains and new species are recognized. For an example in wild fish, a bacterial mortality event was restricted to menhaden and striped mullet in the Galveston Bay (TX) area in November 1968. The cause was attributed to Photobacterium damselae piscicida, formerly known as Pasteurella piscicida (Lewis et al. 1970; Panek 2005). This bacterium occurs ubiquitously in the gut of marine fishes. Thune et al. (2003) reported that in Louisiana from 1990 to 1995, heavy mortalities (32 cases) were reported in coastal hybrid striped–bass farms, with four farms closing as a direct result of Photobacterium damselae piscicida. This pathogen has also become a pathogen of significance in cultured cobia (Rachycentron canadum), with 80 % mortality at some sites (McLean et al. 2008). In fact, isolates from cage-cultured cobia have included V. alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, and V. harveyi (McLean et al. 2008). All stages of cobia can succumb to vibriosis, and this disease can account for 45 % mortality in cage-stocked juveniles.\n\nVibrios not associated with overt disease in marine organisms are ubiquitous in the northern Gulf of Mexico, where Vibrio vulnificus has been isolated from the intestines of sheepshead (Archosargus probatocephalus), red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), little tuna (Euthynnus alletteratus), Atlantic croaker, Atlantic spadefish (Chaetodipterus faber), Atlantic stingray (Dasyatis sabina), black drum, crevalle jack (Caranx hippos), gafftopsail catfish (Bagre marinus), Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), Gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta), pigfish (Orthopristis chrysoptera), pinfish (Lagodon rhombodies), scaled sardine (Harengula jaguana), hardhead sea catfish (Ariopsis felis), southern kingfish (Menticirrhus littoralis), Spanish mackerel (Scomberomerus maculatus), and white mullet (Mugil curema) (DePaola et al. 1994). DePaola et al. (1994) noted that the prevalence of V. vulnificus collected offshore in the Gulf (32–35 ppt) was 11.8 % compared with 13 % in Galveston open Gulf beaches (18.9 ppt) and 68 % in the Galveston Bay estuary (11.3 ppt). Tao et al. (2012) found that a statistically significant (p < 0.0001) inverse correlation between V. vulnificus-positive fish and salinity existed as did a positive correlation (p < 0.03) between water temperature and V. vulnificus-positive fish in Gulf locations of Ocean Springs, Mississippi, Gulf Shores and Dauphin Island, Alabama. In addition to the fish listed above by DePaola et al. (1994), Tao et al. (2012) also reported ladyfish (Elops saurus), striped mullet, silver perch (Bairdiella chrysoura), sand weakfish (Cynoscion arenarius), spotted weakfish (Cynoscion nebulosus), and red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) to have V. vulnificus on the body surface. Buck (1990) isolated V. alginolyticus, V. damselae, and V. parahaemolyticus from fish from the GoM and adjacent Sarasota Bay, Florida. These isolates came from the gills, intestinal tract, mouth, surface skin, spines, and teeth.\n\nExophthalmia, a condition known as “bugeye,” commonly affects fishes in the GoM. The most common cause is bacterial as shown in the red snapper maintained in culture (Figure 14.14). Figure 14.15 shows a case in the sheepshead minnow that also was probably bacterial in nature. The condition, however, can result from a variety of causes. When a trematode metacercaria infects the eye, especially in a semi-enclosed locality, a large percentage of the fish intermediate host population can be infected. Several species of diplostomoids produce this effect, and some species can number 30 or more large encysted individuals in the vitreous humor or several hundred other small ones in the lens of a single eye. Presumably, heavily infected fish in the Gulf, the same as demonstrated elsewhere or in experimental studies, are vulnerable to predation by the appropriate bird or mammal final host. Metacestodes occur less commonly, but we have seen them in the eyes of Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus) and puffers. Lymphocystis, a viral disease reported later, can usually be recognized in living fish. Nutritional deficiency and gas-bubble disease usually affect fish in culture under poor husbandry conditions.\n\nWhat is termed “red sore” disease in Mississippi and elsewhere in the northern Gulf is an ulcerative condition common in euryhaline fish and can occur at epizootic levels greater than 50 % prevalence, based on fishermen’s comments to us, in sheepshead (Archosargus probatocephalus) (Figure 14.16), black drum (Pogonias cromis), and centrarchids. Most cases in low salinity water are associated with Aeromonas hydrophila; but some lesions, especially those from fish in 15–20 ppt, had Pseudomonas spp. and Vibrio spp. Overstreet (1988) considered most of the cases he investigated as resulting from contamination, but they were associated with some secondary infections resulting from natural factors and mechanical damage from fishing or other activities. He updated prior reports from Mississippi Sound (Overstreet and Howse 1977) as approximating red sore lesions occurring in 10 % of spot and southern flounder in summer months and a lower percentage during the rest of the year. The Atlantic croaker and southern kingfish (Menticirrhus littoralis) also exhibit lesions, often associated with fishing activities. Overstreet also cited literature reporting 35–40 % of striped mullet in Punta Gorda, Florida, in late summer and several species in West Florida with Vibrio damselae. Aeromonas hydrophila and Vibrio anguillarum are also known to cause a bacterial hemorrhagic septicemia and fin rot in the Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus) and striped bass (Morone saxatilis) in brackish water of Alabama (Hawke 1976).\n\nThe influence of environmental stressors such as low salinities or pollution with high organic content may initiate and exacerbate this disease (Overstreet 1978, 1988). Aeromonas hydrophila and the colonial peritrich ciliate Heteropolaria colisarum interact to produce ulcerating lesions in centrarchid fishes occurring in freshwater and low salinity habitats (Figure 14.5). The bacterium associates with the ciliate, and, when the organic load in the habitat increases in amount, the ciliate increases in number. Different proteolytic enzymes produced by the motile bacterium (Barrett et al. 2012) cause erosion of the epithelium, lysis of the skeletal musculature, hemolysis, and hemorrhagic septicemia (Overstreet and Howse 1977; Cipriano et al. 1984). Ultrastructural study of the ciliate by Hazen et al. (1978) assumed that since the point of the stalk attachment as shown by scanning electron microscopical images to the fish surface was not the site of pathologic changes, the relationship with the ciliate was benign. In our (Overstreet and Howse 1977) ultrastructural transmission electron microscopical images, the point of attachment was a dense granular layer overlying the spreading fibrillar attachment. Sinuous spiral fibers running longitudinally down the stalk attach directly to the collagenous lamellae of the fish scale. No cellular membrane separated host tissue from the attachments of fibrillar of granular layers. We suggested the ciliate could invade the collagenous layer. Whether this invasion could occur without the interaction of bacterial enzymes is unknown, but bacteria alone, with accompanying ciliates, could readily cause red sore lesions in Hazen’s material as well as ours. In fish with severe septicemia, the liver and kidneys served as foci for toxic products produced by the bacteria. The structural integrity of both organs was destroyed, leaving minor pathologic changes in the spleen and heart (Huizinga et al. 1979).\n\nInteresting questions concerning aspects of these red sores involve the seriousness, longevity, and cause of red sore lesions. We think the infections in sheepshead from Mississippi (Figure 14.16) provide examples of lesions associated with low salinity. During occasional periods of low salinity, sheepshead with lesions occurred and were caught by hook and line commonly from under the U.S. 90 Highway Biloxi-Ocean Springs Bridge. Because of the lesions, some calcified and some with attached barnacles, fishermen were concerned about keeping and eating them and threw them back into the water. We examined several critically, and some individuals with special marks (tattoos) were captured over and over. Most other species migrated a short distance to higher salinity waters. The lesions in some fish covered more than a third of the body surface and exhibited large areas of skeletal muscles along the flank. Because some fishermen recognized the individuals, they reported to us that the fish remained alive with lesions as long as the salinity concentration remained low, sometimes a few months. The presence of low salinity acorn barnacle supports this longevity in low salinity. Once the salinity concentration increased, fish did not exhibit lesions. We examined some and could detect scale and epithelial regeneration, suggesting recovery from the infections; regenerating tissues remained detectable for a couple of months.\n\nWe often captured, using 5-min long trawls, specimens of the Atlantic croaker that had been trawled and tossed overboard, often multiple times, by shrimp fishermen. Many of these had red sores, fin-erosion, abrasion, tail-rot, and other lesions. Presumably, some became prey of seabirds, fishes, and bottlenose dolphin, but after shrimp season we could see a time series of regenerating lesions in many specimens, suggesting recovery in a significant proportion of released fish. Few scientific studies have been conducted to understand the multiple causes of bacterial lesions.\n\nFin erosion can result from anthropogenic factors. These lesions can be chemical contamination, fishing techniques as indicated above, or a variety of other activities. For exam"
