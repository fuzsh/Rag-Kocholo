        "text": "Sustainable Eel Group to release comprehensive report on eel trafficking countermeasures\n\nLondon, England (5 August 2024) – The Sustainable Eel Group is excited to announce the upcoming release of an independent report from the University of …\n\nRead more »\n\nEU circulates guidance on the implementation of Eel Management Plans\n\nBrussels, Belgium (26 July 2024) – European Union proposals for the ‘Implementation of the Regulation establishing measures for the recovery of the stock of European eel’ were circulated to policymakers in local, national, and European government today as part of a push to better consolidate and coordinate eel management efforts across Europe.\n\nThe latest guidance calls upon the Commission and the Member States to make full use of the Eel Regulation as the core policy for the management and long-term recovery of Europeaneel stocks; reaffirming that an approach which balances commercial and environmental drivers and considers the interconnectedness of policy developments in all parts of the European eel’s range remains ‘fit for purpose’, whilst acknowledging that there have been considerable delays in the revision process which must be addressed.\n\nIt highlights the important role that eel fisheries play in society, noting that commercial and recreational fishers have not only gathered data critical to conservation-led scientific research but served as guardians of marine and freshwater habitats, counteracting the worst effects of water engineering, habitat loss, and the illegal trade with East Asia.\n\nAnd whilst it stops short in saying that further restrictions on fisheries are out of the question, it suggests that if any changes to policy do need to be made, they should be based on the best available scientific advice and prior socio-economic impact assessments as opposed to ad hoc political decisions taken by European or national governments; and that compensation and support for fishers should be provided in line with the relevant provisions of the EuropeanMaritime, Fisheries, and Aquaculture Fund.\n\nOne of the most fundamental policy developments to come out of the guidance concerns cross-border Eel Management Plans. This is a mechanism which has thus far been underutilised by the Member States, but it is now being actively encouraged to ensure more bespoke, localised solutions for trans-border National Parks or drainage systems with uniquegeographical, ecologic, and socio-economic characteristics.\n\nThe Sustainable Eel Group welcomes the guidance as an important next step towards the eel’s recovery, and would like to indicate its willingness to support national governments and local stakeholders in developing effective strategies for the future of the fishery.\n\nSomerset Eel Recovery Project featured on BBC Countryfile\n\nGlastonbury, England (21 July 2024) – The Somerset Eel Recovery Project is pleased to announce that it has made an appearance on the popular BBC …\n\nRead more »\n\nAndrew Kerr speaks at the first annual Somerset Eel Conference\n\nThe 2024 Somerset Eel Conference commences tomorrow at the Redbrick Building in Glastonbury, bringing together scientists, conservationists, government policymakers, and other key stakeholders in the …\n\nRead more »\n\nHave your say on the SEG Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning Plan.\n\nTo those in the European eel community Have your say on the SEG Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning Plan.

The translocation of 90 million plus eel in 2014 as a restocking conservation measure, whilst being highly commendable, cannot be regarded as a lasting or sustainable solution.\n\nOverall, SEG welcomes the fact that the debate is no longer centred on fishery restrictions (we strongly believe that the best solutions for the eel’s recovery require a vibrant sustainable fishery across Europe) and that further research will be conducted to give a more accurate picture of eel populations.”\n\nThe full report is available here\n\nUK’s east coast sees huge increase in elver numbers\n\nFollowing the huge increase in the number of elvers arriving in the UK’s western estuaries this year, reports have been published of a massive increase …\n\nRead more »\n\n100,000 juvenile eels introduced to Wiltshire Avon in emergency conservation boost\n\nSEG has launched a major project with Bristol Avon Rivers Trust to increase the number of European Eels in the River Avon.
