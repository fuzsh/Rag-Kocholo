        "text": "Carp are tame...they are like a big baby...you can cradle them all you want. They may wriggle...but they mean you no harm...\n\nNot like Bowfins...Bowfins are a handful...and they always have that evil took when you stalk them...like they want to torpedo out of the water to bite you...(they probably don't...but that's how they look)...\n\nSnakeheads are equally mean but I love them....so much...so very much...we are unlucky...Potomac anglers are truly lucky...after fishing for snakeheads, everything else, including pike, muskies, steelhead and salmon, seems lame and tame...maybe with the exception of sturgeon...those are cool fish and they are OK in my book. You just gotta experience it for yourself...snakehead fever...it's a sickness and there's no drug for it except to catch more...watching a float goes down on a steelhead is tame...watching a snakehead play cat-and-mouse with your lure then see that mouth flash wide open and white with mud, bubbles and $hit flying all over, set the hook and have it jump 2 feet in the air over 6\" of water...then jump again...and again...acrobatics put steelheads to shame...love to see a steelhead do that. They have really strong jaw...pike jaw spreaders barely able to keep the jaw open...and you need two guys to unhook them if one was deep hooked. They are strong and resilent. You can keep them out of the water for minutes and they are still OK (but we love them and return them to the water ASAP)...not like many other \"glamour fish\" that can't be out for the water for 30 seconds...lame...\n\nThe equivalent of Snakeheads in Ontario is Bowfin...very similar in habitat requirement and behaviour...they can breath air too and you don't have to rush with them. They live in some of the toughest environment that other \"glamour fish\" cannot tolerate...certainly not a high-maintenance, pampered-honey-momma species...if only Bowfin would chase lures with more intent like a snakehead, it would be perfect...I quench my snakehead sickness by fishing for Bowfins locally...but I can only stalk them for 2 months each year...limited spots, limited time...I love Bowfins so much too!!!\n\nBarracuda and Sharks...watch out...mean a$$ buggers!!! They are pure evil...Satan spawn...\n\nNice fish! Sure hope those snakehead never get prolific up here\n\nTheir invasiveness and damage is overhyped. If anything, they might be able to keep the Round Goby population under control.\n\nIn the Potomac, their diet is 60-70% fish, with 27% killifish, 5% Bluegills, 5% Pumpkinseed, 5% white perch and 1% largemouth bass. The rest is just misc. fish species.\n\nThey have been in to Potomac since 2004...and have little impact on the sport fishery there.\n\nRead up and be educated.\n\nhttp://fishwild.vt.e...eads/Facts.html\n\nhttp://www.fws.gov/n...n Snakehead.pdf\n\nWhen you actually fished for them, you'll see that their purported aggressive in unfounded. They are amazingly wary and tentative, choosing to ambush rather than chase. Any fast moving prey are usually ignored.\n\nThat's why I think if they were in the Great Lakes, their diet would consist of predominantly Round Goby. If Freshwater Drum and Lake Whitefish can prey on Round Goby, Snakehead will not have an issue.\n\nMaybe so but I can see more harm than good coming from yet another invasive species. I can only see the native predatory fish suffering in the long run\n\nI'm not saying I would purposely wish they establish here (hm...or maybe I do ), but at the same time, they are not the evil the media, the public, and even the scientist portrayed.\n\nNative predators will be impacted since the food chain may be disrupted, but I don't expect it to be impacted severely. In the Potomac, the number of Largemouth Bass greatly outnumbered the Northern Snakehead...even co-exist in the same zones. Where I caught my snakeheads, Largemouth Bass outnumbered snakehead by at least 6:1 as a safe estimate base on the numbers that I can see. Largemouth Bass fishing has not been affected, but strangely even improved since their establishment. I could catch bass until my arm falls off if I wish...but bass are pretty tame and lame compared to the snakeheads.\n\nNorthern Snakehead is not a generalist like Largemouth Bass...or even Smallmouth Bass. They have specific habitat requirements. On the Potomac, they are not found \"everywhere\", but in specific locations and they have seasonal use of various habitats. That makes their impact to any specific area and habitat much reduced.\n\nIf you read the report, the growth rate of Potomac's snakehead is slower than the growth rate in their native habitat. Since we're much further north (Washington DC is much milder than Toronto for example), our winter will affect their growth rate even more. They may enter into hibernation in the winter months and that will definitely halt their growth. They will also not spawn 5 times a year like they do in their native habitat since they have a prime spawning period. In the Potomac, they only usually spawn once in the spring.\n\nThat's why much of their speculated impact is unfounded when the real data is actually collected and analyzed for the population established in the Potomac.\n\nI don't like the 1% largie part. Or \"the rest of the species are misc\". If they get in the rivers and lakes here, good bye fishing for quality.\n\nDoom and gloom just the same for Zebra Mussels and Round Goby.\n\nZebra Mussel was believed to deplete plankton and zooplankton so much that they will affect Salmon and Trout in the Great Lakes by depleting the food base for prey species such as Alewife. You noticed any difference in Lake Ontario? Lately, if you follow the King of the Lake and Toronto Sun derby, the chinooks are getting bigger and bigger. I don't notice a depletion of salmon or trout on the streams either. Yes, it is a fact that Zebra Mussels helps to increase the water clarity of Lake Erie and Bay of Quinte, and that causes a shift in the usage of habitat for some species such as Walleye. Instead of using basin habitat (where anglers used to bottom bounce the channels for Walleye), the fish retreated into weed line habitat (now anglers fish deep weed edges). Were the walleye wiped out because of the change? No. They just shifted their behaviour to adjust to the new conditions. Most fish has a certain degree of adaptability.\n\nWe also have Quagga Mussel...two invasive filtering species...come on, we must have zero fish left now! I don't know what everyone was fishing for this opener...must be phantom steelheads...\n\nRound Goby was believed to predate heavily on eggs and YOY fish to the point to killing inshore fishery. What happened to Lake Erie, Bay of Quinte and Lake Simcoe? The Round Goby must not have received the memo. But in fact, Round Goby provided new forage for Smallmouth Bass, Freshwater Drum, Walleye and even Lake Whitefish. I've caught Round Goby in the mouth of streams such as Bronte and Credit, yet, when I micro fish those areas, I still find a healthy minnow, darter and sucker community. I do not notice a change in the salmonid species either.\n\nHow about the Ruffe? Or Rudd? They must be everywhere now? What about Tubenose Goby?\n\nThe prognosis is often, if not always, worse than real life when it comes to invasive fish species. I've been to Illinois where the Asian carp invasion was ground zero. Yes, there are a lot of carp, but in the immediate area, there were also an abundance (as in swirling masses in the thousands...if not million) of Gizzard Shad (species dependent on the same food source as the Asian Carp), plus at least 10 other species that we caught on hook and line, and many more species that we could see personally that we did not catch. Fish species tend to have better natural check and balance system that Mother Nature imposes. Fish cannot completely deplete an area of food because they cannot survive without food. Habitat is often limited and that places pressure on invasive species.\n\nInvasive plant is a different story...because plants are primary producers...they only need sun, soil and water. And to some extent pollenators. They don't need to depend on anything else. The ecology of plant is often much simplier than ecology of fish."
