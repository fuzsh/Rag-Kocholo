        "text": "Happy birthday to Robert Downey, Jr! Sure, today, everyone knows him as Tony “Iron Man” Stark, but some of us knew him way back when he was playing historical characters like Charlie Chaplin. Let’s give a little love to this multi-faceted actor on his b-day.\n\nChaplin (1992) – Charlie Chaplin\n\nIn this epic biography, Downey gives far more than just a Little Tramp impersonation. He shows how Chaplin’s comedy was born from trauma and how his life was filled with chaos, even to the end.\n\nRichard III (1995) – Lord Rivers\n\nEverything about Ian McKellen’s Shakespearean adaption set in a fascist 1930s England is brilliant, but it’s a wonderful move to have Queen Elizabeth and her brother played by Americans — Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr., respectively — so they are seenÂ as outsiders.\n\nRestoration (1995) –Â Robert Merivel\n\nYou really have to listen to our podcast about this movie to appreciate our full adoration of Robert Downey Jr. in 17th-century lace and feathers. Just do it.\n\nGood Night, and Good Luck (2005) –Â Joe Wershba\n\nDowney’sÂ roles in historical costume films have becomeÂ smaller and infrequent, alas. Here, he portrayed an award-winning CBS journalist who worked with Edward R. Murrow in the 1950s.\n\nFur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus (2006) –Â Lionel Sweeney\n\nFull of very fanciful imagery, this movie aboutÂ mid 20th-century photographer Diane Arubus (played by Nicole Kidman)Â invented a love interest (played by Robert Downey Jr.) and told a strange andÂ emotional story.\n\nSherlock Holmes (2009) & Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011) – Sherlock Holmes\n\nI’m sorry, we’re not fans of this steampunk-y franchise. But Robert Downey Jr. is still awfully cute!\n\nDo you prefer Robert Downey Jr. in action flicks or historical costume movies?"
