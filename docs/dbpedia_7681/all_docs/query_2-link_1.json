        "text": "Early life and first films\n\nDowney was raised in an artistic household in New York City’s Greenwich Village; his father was a noted underground filmmaker who gave the five-year-old Downey his first part. After dropping out of high school in California, Downey returned to New York City to pursue an acting career. Supporting roles in several movies, including the cult hit Weird Science (1985), led to a stint (1985–86) on the television comedy sketch show Saturday Night Live. With his boyish looks and raffish charm, Downey then scored the lead in the romantic comedy The Pick-up Artist (1987) and broke out further with his visceral performance as a cocaine addict in Less Than Zero (1987).\n\nChaplin, drug addiction, and comeback\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nSteady work followed, but much of it went unnoticed until Downey’s appearance in 1992 as the title character in Richard Attenborough’s Chaplin biopic, which earned him numerous plaudits and an Academy Award nomination for best actor. By this time, however, Downey had developed a substance-abuse problem, and, despite impressive turns in films ranging from the violent media satire Natural Born Killers (1994) to the costume drama Restoration (1995), his frequent skirmishes with the law and his public struggle with drug addiction often overshadowed his on-screen successes. He reached a low point in 1999, when he was sentenced to three years in prison for having violated parole from an earlier arrest.\n\nIn 2000, after being granted an early release, Downey was cast in a recurring role on the television series Ally McBeal, and he won a Golden Globe Award for his work on the show. His drug problems continued, however, and he was arrested several times. In 2003 Downey seemed to turn his life and career around, and he thrust himself into his work, appearing in 13 feature films over the next five years, including The Singing Detective (2003), Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005), A Scanner Darkly (2006), and Zodiac (2007).\n\nIron Man series and Oppenheimer\n\nIn 2008 Downey won acclaim for his roles in two summer blockbusters. In Iron Man he portrayed Tony Stark, a billionaire inventor with a superhero alter ego, and in the satiric comedy Tropic Thunder he starred as a self-important movie star who dons blackface to land the role of an African American soldier in the Vietnam War. For the latter role Downey received an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor. He next appeared in The Soloist (2009), portraying a journalist who befriends a homeless man (played by Jamie Foxx) who was a classically trained cellist. Downey then assumed the title role in Sherlock Holmes (2009), a film featuring a visceral reimagining of the central character from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective series, and won a Golden Globe Award for his performance; a sequel followed in 2011.\n\nHaving emerged, somewhat surprisingly, as one of Hollywood’s most bankable stars, Downey was cast as an anxious father-to-be in the road-trip comedy Due Date (2010). He took a supporting role in Iron Man director Jon Favreau’s pet project, Chef (2014), before playing a lawyer defending his father (Robert Duvall), who is accused of vehicular homicide, in The Judge (2014). He reprised the role of Tony Stark in the Iron Man sequels (2010 and 2013), The Avengers (2012) and its sequels (2015, 2018, and 2019), Captain America: Civil War (2016), and Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). In 2020 he starred in the family comedy Dolittle, which was based on the character created by Hugh Lofting.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Robert Oppenheimer and the development of the atomic bomb. For his performance as Oppenheimer’s antagonist Lewis Strauss, Downey won an Oscar and a Golden Globe Award for best supporting actor."
