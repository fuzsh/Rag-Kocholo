        "text": "Murray Close\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- What makes a great movie character? From the year 2000 on, things got kind of complicated.\n\nThe most memorable characters of the 21st century embodied everything from flawed heroes and lovable losers to sociopaths and slick talkers. You've got everyone from Harry Potter and Katniss Everdeen to The Joker and Patrick Bateman.\n\nSome of them felt larger than life, while others were oh so relatable. Regardless, they've stayed in our hearts and our minds.\n\nHere are the 50 that did it best.\n\nDreamWorks\n\n50. Shrek\n\nMovies: Shrek, Shrek 2, Shrek the Third, Shrek Ever After\n\nVoiced by: Mike Myers\n\nThe most famous movie character of the 21st century not created by Pixar. Shrek is iconic, as a representation of how we fear what is different but shouldn't. He's also proof that sometimes turning the prince is better as a frog (or an ogre).\n\nMelinda Sue Gordon\n\n49. Derek Zoolander\n\nMovies: Zoolander, Zoolander 2\n\nPlayed by: Ben Stiller\n\nMaybe Derek Zoolander doesn't have too many redeemable characteristics. But he certainly means well. But his likability lies in how stupid he is. But he has a point, right -- How are we supposed to teach children how to read if they can't even fit inside the building?\n\nGetty Images\n\n48. Enid\n\nMovie: Ghost World\n\nPlayed by: Thora Birch\n\nBased on the popular graphic novel, \"Ghost World,\" the film takes us into a world of characters that are supposedly outcasts but feel endlessly relatable. Enid is an 18-year-old cynic who thinks she knows everything. She is every one of us that wasn't the most popular kid in school discovering what comes after high-school frustration. There's an entire world out there, if you embrace it.\n\nMiramax\n\n47. William \"Bill the Butcher\" Cutting\n\nMovie: Gangs of New York\n\nPlayed by: Daniel Day-Lewis\n\nBill the Butcher has to be Donald Trump's favorite movie character, right? Here's a guy whose ancestors aren't native to America ruling over Manhattan with an iron first, shunning anyone who is not a \"native.\" Still, Daniel Day-Lewis' performance creates a character that steals the show. He's a villain you want to root for, no matter how ruthless he is.\n\nA24\n\n46. Alien\n\nMovie: Spring Breakers\n\nPlayed by: James Franco\n\nJust looking at Alien, James Franco's drug dealer/rapper from \"Spring Breakers,\" and he seems utterly laughable. But the character comes to embody some sort of warped American Dream in the movie and it's intoxicating. He's almost able to convince you he's figured out the key to happiness.\n\nFox Searchlight\n\n45. Juno MacGuff\n\nMovie: Juno\n\nPlayed by: Ellen Page\n\nWith the mid-to-late 2000s comedies, it's easy to forget just how good \"Juno\" was. The story of a teenage girl who gets pregnant and deals with it in realistic ways is driven by the title character, a likable smart-ass who grows up before our eyes.\n\nFox Searchlight\n\n44. Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson\n\nMovie: The Wrestler\n\nPlayed by: Mickey Rourke\n\nAs Bruce Springsteen's song from \"The Wrestler\" asks, \"Have you ever seen a one trick pony in the field so happy and free?\" It's a heartbreaking tale that finds the main character, washed up wrestling star The Ram, trying but failing to get past the thing that defined him for song long. Even if it kills him.\n\nLionsgate\n\n43. John Kramer aka Jigsaw\n\nMovies: Saw franchise\n\nPlayed by: Tobin Bell\n\nEvery generation needs an iconic horror villain. For better and (sometimes worse), the 2000s and beyond belonged to Jigsaw. It was hard to turn away from this feeble old man putting victims in horrible \"what would you do\" circumstances that amounted to elaborate torture porn.\n\nClay Enos\n\n42. Rorschach\n\nMovie: Watchmen\n\nPlayed by: Jackie Earl Haley\n\nRorschach is one of the greatest comic book/graphic novel characters of all time. So it was a given he would prove to be the best thing about the \"Watchmen\" film adaptation, unless they messed it up. One of the few things the film doesn't mess up is Jackie Early Haley's Rorschach, the heart at the center of \"Watchmen\" that keeps beating even when the film goes off the rails.\n\nAlex Bailey\n\n41. Bridget Jones\n\nMovies: Bridget Jones, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Bridget Jones' Baby\n\nPlayed by: Renee Zellweger\n\nThe character Bridget Jones works so well, especially in that first film, because she's not your typical movie heroine. She's an awkward, clumsy, modern woman with the kind of insecurities that mirror real life.\n\nWeinstein Company\n\n40. Lancaster Todd\n\nMovie: The Master\n\nPlayed by: Philip Seymour Hoffman\n\nYou may find yourself wondering how some people might actually go for something like Scientology. But imagine if someone like Lancaster Todd were real (which he very well may be, given the film's inspiration). This is an overwhelming force of a character that can manipulate and captivate all at once.\n\nA24\n\n39. Christine \"Lady Bird\" McPherson\n\nMovie: Lady Bird\n\nPlayed by: Saoirse Ronan\n\nOne of the most relatable movie characters in recent memory, Lady Bird is every high school girl wanting to escape to New York to find out what the world has in store for them. But it's her relationship with her mother that hits at home. This is a movie about life and the relationships we can't escape, even if sometimes we want to.\n\nCourtesy of Warner Bros. Picture\n\n38. Samantha\n\nMovie: Her\n\nPlayed by: Scarlett Johansson\n\nSamantha may be an advance operating system. But make no mistake -- she is one of the most compelling characters of the 21st century. Samantha makes \"Her\" work, as the audience has to believe a man can actually fall in love with a computer. There's more layers to it, of course. Just know Scarlett Johansson has, perhaps, never been more intoxicating.\n\nMarvel\n\n37. Spider-Man\n\nMovies: Spider-Man franchise, The Amazing Spider-Man franchise, Marvel Cinematic Universe, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\n\nPlayed by: Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, Tom Holland, (voiced by) Shameik Moore\n\nWe could have limited this to one version of Spider-Man (likely Tom Holland or Tobey Maguire's portrayal). But Spidey is one of the rare character that, even when the movies weren't great, the man playing the web slinger nailed it. And in different ways; most recently giving us a version of Miles Morales in \"Into the Spider-Verse\" diehards have long been craving.\n\nDisney\n\n36. Kylo Ren\n\nMovies: The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi\n\nPlayed by: Adam Driver\n\nKylo Ren had a lot to live up to. He was the new Star Wars Trilogy's version of Darth Vader, arguably, the most important character in movie history. Ren lives up to the hype as a villain with depth who just so happens to be the child of two iconic Star Wars characters.\n\nFocus Features\n\n35. Bob Harris\n\nMovie: Lost in Translation\n\nPlayed by: Bill Murray\n\nThere are plenty of movie roles that find Bill Murray over the top. \"Lost in Translation\" is not one of them, which, perhaps, makes it his most endearing role. Bob Harris is a washed up actor who's self aware. We're able to see him through the Scarlett Johansson's Charlotte, as they become two lost soles who connect in moving ways.\n\nFox 2000\n\n34. Miranda Priestly\n\nMovie: The Devil Wears Prada\n\nPlayed by: Meryl Streep\n\nForgive anyone who thinks Miranda Priestly is somehow the hero of \"The Devil Wears Prada.\" You can't take your eyes of her. Miranda is supposedly based on Vogue's Ann Wintour. God help anyone who worked as her personal assistant in real life.\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\n33. Buddy Hobbs\n\nMovie: Elf\n\nPlayed by: Will Ferrell\n\nWhat makes Buddy the Elf so likable, anyway? He's a grown man who thinks he's actually an Elf that gets on everyone's nerves. But through it all, Buddy embodies the Christmas spirit. Eventually you have to give into his joy, in between laughing all the way.\n\nDavid James\n\n32. Caesar\n\nMovies: Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, War of the Planet of the Apes\n\nPlayed by: Andy Serkis\n\nCaesar starts as this lovable creature that society does wrong. By the end of the latest \"Planet of the Apes\" trilogy he's a revolutionary leader you can get behind, CGI and all.\n\nColumbia Pictures\n\n31. McLovin'\n\nMovie: Superbad\n\nPlayed by: Christopher Mintz-Plasse\n\nAs soon as the trailer for \"Superbad\" hit, McLovin' became iconic. A school nerd choosing a fake ID name that's just one word. It's an epic decision that leads to epic craziness. He's the character in \"Superbad\" you most want to hangout with, which is saying something.\n\nMarvel Studios\n\n30. Killmonger\n\nMovie: \"Black Panther\"\n\nPlayed by: Michael B. Jordan\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe has its share of villains with purpose. But none have as much heart as Killmonger. If the though of helping the world and getting revenge for his father's death didn't drive him absolutely crazy, you could get on board with his cause. Michael B. Jordan makes him the Marvel villain with the most depth.\n\nType A Films\n\n29. Elle Woods\n\nMovies: Legally Blonde; Legally Blonde: Red, White & Blonde\n\nPlayed by: Reece Witherspoon\n\nMaybe Reece Witherspoon would find it an insult to say Elle Woods was her ultimate movie role. But it's not. Elle Woods is the ultimate satire on blonde stereotypes, something she showcases with style as she owns the courtroom.\n\nIllumination\n\n28. Minions\n\nMovies: Despicable Me franchise; Minions\n\nPlayed by: Pierre Coffin\n\nYou know a group of characters have made a dent when they get their own spinoff that makes more money than its predecessor. There was no escaping the Minions after the 2015 film came out, especially around Halloween time.\n\nCBS Films\n\n27. Llewyn Davis\n\nMovie: Inside Llewyn Davis\n\nPlayed by: Oscar Isaac\n\nWe all know the triumphant story of the Greenwich Village singer-songwriter, a la Bob Dylan. Inside Llewyn Davis tells a different story. Its title character is a talented musician who never catches his big break. But it's fun watching him try during a week-long snapshot of an underappreciated talent. And boy, can he sing.\n\nDreamWorks\n\n26. Penny Lane\n\nMovie: Almost Famous\n\nPlayed by: Kate Hudson\n\n\"It's all happening.\" Those are the words of Penny Lane, the centerpiece of the timeless musical journey that is \"Almost Famous.\" Yes, it's a period piece, but it never gets old. Neither does the character, played in exhilarating fashion by Kate Hudsen. She's pure magic.\n\nWalt Disney Pictures\n\n25. Buzz Lightyear / 24. Woody\n\nMovies: Toy Story franchise\n\nPlayed by: Tim Allen and Tom Hanks\n\nIt's impossible to separate the two characters that launched Pixar into the stratosphere. Bud and Woody are as iconic as it gets in terms of animated characters, standing at the center of the greatest animated trilogy of all time. To infinity, and beyond.\n\nRichard Foreman Jr\n\n23. Driver\n\nMovie: Drive\n\nPlayed by: Ryan Gosling\n\nYou know a character is badass when he doesn't even have a name. Ryan Gosling's Driver in the movie \"Drive\" is endlessly cool as a hero who isn't so much good as he is noble. I suppose you can do what you want when you're wearing that scorpion jacket. He barely says a word, but has us hooked from the beginning.\n\nMarvel\n\n22. Loki\n\nMovies: Marvel Cinematic Universe\n\nPlayed by: Tom Hiddleston\n\nLoki is an example of a comic book character being elevated from its modest origins to mass popularity thanks to a movie portrayal. Thor's brother is as cunning as they get, but so charismatic you just want him to end up on the right side of things.\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\n21. Gandalf\n\nMovies: The Lord of the Rings trilogy\n\nPlayed by: Ian McKellen\n\nGandalf is essentially the center piece of \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy. He's the character that embodies the mythology of the story the most. And he has some of the stories finest moments.\n\nLionsgate\n\n20. Patrick Bateman\n\nMovie: American Psycho\n\nPlayed by: Christian Bale\n\nIn the adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel \"American Psycho,\" Patrick Bateman is the kind of character you want to forget but can't. He's a serial killer who would represent the worst and most misguided aspects of society even if he wasn't killing people. But damn if he doesn't do everything with such style. You can't help but gravitate towards this level of black comedy.\n\nUGC Fox\n\n19. Amelie Poulain\n\nMovie: Amelie\n\nPortrayed by: Audrey Tatou\n\nOnce of the most lovable characters in movie history, Amelie's whimsical vibe could make even the grumpiest person crack a smile. She is everything good about the world. Watching \"Amelie\" will give you hope that world is still a good place. That's priceless.\n\nSummit Entertainment\n\n18. John Wick\n\nMovies: John Wick franchise\n\nPlayed by: Keanu Reeves\n\nThere are a few things you should avoid in life: The DMV, skipping out on your taxes and killing John Wick's dog. The role of John Wick is the ultimate action achievement in the career of Keanu Reeves, which is certainly saying something.\n\nDisney\n\n17. Captain Jack Sparrow\n\nMovies: Pirates of the Caribbean franchise\n\nPlayed by: Johnny Depp\n\nSure, by the time it was all said and done (assuming its all said and done), Johnny Depp's shtick as Jack Sparrow may have gotten old. But few things are more iconic than seeing him in all his glory for the first time in \"Dead Man's Chest.\" He brings what was just a Disney amusement park ride to life all by his lonesome.\n\nWeinstein Company\n\n16. Hans Landa\n\nMovie: Inglourious Basterds\n\nPlayed by: Christoph Waltz\n\nWhen you really think about it, \"Inglorious Basterds\" is a lovable mess of a movie. But the ruler of all that chaos is Christoph Waltz's ruthless Hans Landa. A quirky sociopath who would feel completely unhinged if he weren't so damn brilliant. He's hilarious and haunting all at once.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n15. Batman\n\nMovies: The Dark Knight trilogy\n\nPlayed by: Christian Bale\n\nForget Ben Affleck's brief run as the caped crusader. Christian Bale was the ultimate Batman with the ultimate story behind him. Sure, Bruce Wayne had been done before. But Bale perfects the brooding nature of the character in its Dark Knight form. In many ways he's a reluctant hero. But one the world needs.\n\nMiramax\n\n14. Anton Chigurh\n\nMovie: No Country for Old Men\n\nPlayed by: Javier Bardem\n\nWho ever thought a guy with a bold cut could be so terrifying. The horror of Anton Chigurh lies in his simplicity. He's an old-school guy who's willing to decide your fate on a coin toss. There's no reasoning with him or digging deeper. What you see is what you get, which means you better run.\n\nJasin Boland\n\n13. Imperator Furiosa\n\nMovie: Mad Max: Fury Road\n\nPlayed by: Charlize Theron\n\nThe movie is called \"Mad Max.\" But Furiosa is the real star of the show. She's the one with the most on the line, risking her neck to save a group of women enslaved by a psycho. And Furiosa matches the title character for grit throughout. She's the heroine that gives the \"Fury Road\" its, well...fury.\n\nMarvel Studios\n\n12. Iron Man\n\nMovies: Marvel Cinematic Universe\n\nPlayed by: Robert Downey Jr.\n\nYou can't overstate just how important the character of Tony Stark/Iron Man was to the success of the MCU. He gave Marvel Studios the face it needed, while revitalizing Robert Downey Jr.'s career.\n\nParamount Vantage/Miramax\n\n11. Daniel Plainview\n\nMovie: There Will Be Blood\n\nPlayed by: Daniel Day-Lewis\n\nIn many ways, \"There Will Be Blood\" is about what striving for the American dream can do to a man. In this case, you have Daniel Plainview, a controlled prospector driven to madness by his own greed and the pain he hides beneath his ambition. When it all finally comes out towards the films end, it's absolutely viscous.\n\nPixar\n\n10. Dory\n\nMovies: Finding Nemo, Finding Dory\n\nPlayed by: Ellen DeGeneres\n\nDory was always the character from \"Finding Nemo\" that demanded a spinoff. Her mantra of \"keep swimming\" isn't much more than \"when life gives you a lemon...\" But under the circumstances and the lovable creation of this character, it strikes you right in the heart. Anything can be overcome.\n\nDreamWorks\n\n9. Ron Burgundy\n\nMovies: Anchorman franchise\n\nPlayed by: Will Ferrell\n\nWill Ferrell's ultimate movie character, at times, feels like the actor doing some of his best improv material. But that's the beauty of Ron Burgundy. He's got one liners for days and his satire of an American news anchor circa the 1970s is as funny as it is sad that we'd prefer this guy over some of what we've got in real society today.\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\n8. Gollum\n\nMovies: The Lord of the Rings franchise\n\nPlayed by: Andy Serkis\n\nThere is no character in \"The Lord of the Rings\" franchise with a more engrossing backstory than Gollum. He represents the horrors the ring is capable of. His lust for it turned him into a monster you can't help but feel sorry for. As much as he desires his precious, we know it's simply his cross to bear for eternity. He's everything we don't want Frodo to become.\n\nParamount Pictures\n\n7. Regina George\n\nMovie: Mean Girls\n\nPlayed by: Rachel McAdams\n\nOn the surface, Regina George is a character we've all met before -- the popular girl who cares about no one but herself. But it's what writer Tina Fey does with the character that makes her so memorable. Remember, this is a girl who once sat next to John Stamos on a plane and he told her she was pretty. Damn.\n\nLionsgate\n\n6. Katniss Everdeen\n\nMovie: Hunger Games franchise\n\nPlayed by: Jennifer Lawrence\n\nShe's the ultimate heroine for the Millennial generation and the blueprint for how to take a character from a popular young adult novel and make her even more iconic. The most endearing part is that Katniss Everdeen never set out to save the world. She simply wanted to save her sister.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n5. Harry Potter\n\nMovies: Harry Potter franchise\n\nPlayed by: Daniel Radcliffe\n\nThere are several characters from the \"Harry Potter\" franchise you could put on this list. In the end, it always comes back to Harry, the childhood wizard we're willing to watch grow to his potential over the course of eight movies. And he never lets us down.\n\nJasin Boland\n\n4. Jason Bourne\n\nMovies: Bourne franchise\n\nPlayed by: Matt Damon\n\nYou know all those hand-to-hand combat movies that are still released about every other month? Well, Jason Bourne is the blueprint for all of them. He begins as a heartless soldier. But eventually the man underneath begins to poke his head out. From there, you're hooked on a guy who just wants to know who he is and where he came from.\n\nMiramax\n\n3. The Bride\n\nMovies: Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2\n\nPlayed by: Uma Thurman\n\nAll she wants is revenge and she sure deserves it. In the first installment of \"Kill Bill,\" the Bride is an action hero working her way through the people who betrayed her. She continues that in \"Vol. 2\" but the stakes are raised with a surprise twist. Watching her fight her way through it all is one of director Quentin Tarantino's crowning achievements.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n2. The Joker\n\nMovie: The Dark Knight\n\nPlayed by: Heath Ledger\n\nIn one of the greatest acting performances of the last 25 years, Heath Ledger did what many thought couldn't be done. He redefined the greatest comic book villain of them all. In Ledger's hands The Joker becomes a man (not a freak) hellbent on testing the norms of society. Every move he makes is calculated, even that mesmerizing pencil trick. In \"The Dark Knight,\" The Joker does what the Joker's supposed to do -- he steals the show.\n\nMary Cybulski\n\n1. Jordan Belfort\n\nMovie: The Wolf of Wall Street\n\nPlayed by: Leonardo DiCaprio\n\n\"Sell me this pen.\" It's a concept that seems simple enough, but few can actually achieve it. And it's by no means the wildest thing you'll see in \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\" But in that moment we learn who Jordan Belfort is -- a guy who can sell the heck out of anything and uses it to his advantage, within the confines of the law or not, to make himself filthy rich.\n\nIt's his own version for the American Dream and its hard to imagine, even after going to prison (It's based on the real life story) he regrets a single moment of it. Belfort is everything many people want to be even if you know you never have the balls to go for it. And that's okay, because we can have so much fun watching him do it."
