        "text": "There have been rumors making the rounds online that Robert Downey Jr. might be reprising his role as Tony Stark aka Iron Man in the MCU.\n\nI think that there’s a chance he’ll show up in Deadpool Vs. Wolverine. It just seems likely given that Deadpool is jumping around the MCU timeline.\n\nBut, a new report has surfaced saying that Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark will appear in one of the upcoming Avengers movies. This news comes from reliable insider scooper Jeff Sneider, and it claims Stark’s return could come with a villainous twist.\n\nThe report says Downey Jr. could return in a future Avengers movie as a Stark Variant and that he will ultimately transform into Doctor Doom.\n\nInterestingly, Downey Jr. initially auditioned to play Doctor Doom in 20th Century Fox's Fantastic Four movie before he landed the role of Tony Stark in Iron Man.\n\nWhen previously talking about his potential return, the actor seemed very open to the idea, saying: \"It’s just crazily in my DNA.\n\n“Probably the most like-me character I’ve ever played, even though he’s way cooler than I am. I’ve become surprisingly open-minded to the idea.\"\n\nWe have no idea what to expect from the MCU that far down the line, and even if this rumor is true, so much could change before then and by the time the movie comes out.\n\nThen there’s the fact that Kevin Feige said they are not going to undo Starks death, saying: “We are going to keep that moment and not touch that moment again. We all worked very hard for many years to get to that, and we would never want to magically undo it in any way.”\n\nBut, that doesn’t mean they won’t play around with a variant of the character. They just won’t undo that aspect of this version of the character. So, anything is still possible.\n\nDo you think Stark will show up again in the MCU one day?"
