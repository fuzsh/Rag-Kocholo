        "text": "By Kyle Matthies\n\nI told myself that my next series would be a dive into the filmography of one of the 2024 Oscar winners. I ended up selecting Robert Downey Jr. because he has had the lengthiest career of this year’s winners, with distinctive high and low points. I’ll be honest with you though, I came out of this week unimpressed. Some of those feelings may be directly related to a couple of odd choices I made in selecting the movies, which is a fair criticism, but the point remains that I did not leave this week a fan of his.\n\nHe gravitates towards roles that I do not feel an affinity for, often playing a womanizer drowning in a sea of excess. Where he excels as an actor is in his charisma as well as his ability to portray anxiety attacks. He often plays rich kids with the walls closing in on them from their own decisions. Even Oppenheimer (which I will not be writing about as part of this series) features this in many regards. He gave a great performance in that movie, but it was a role that benefited from being Robert Downey-ified. He didn’t make himself into Lewis Strauss so much as he made Strauss into him.\n\nAnyway, here’s my thoughts on a few of his movies throughout his career. I thought it would be more entertaining to start with the recent roles and go back from there as we explore what kind of actor RDJ is and how he has evolved.\n\nIron Man 3 (2013) Directed by Shane Black\n\nRemember how I said I made some odd choices when selecting the movies this week? Here’s a great example of that. You can’t talk about Robert Downey Jr. without mentioning his role as Tony Stark. After all he played the role in 10 different movies over 11 years and it made him the highest paid actor in the world- it’s not something you can skip by. But being difficult and weird, I watched this one instead of the original film. I wanted to see how he performed after he was comfortably settled into the role, and this was the Iron Man movie that at least tried to give Tony a character arc.\n\nFollowing the character's previous appearance in The Avengers, Tony is dealing with PTSD and is struggling to find himself. On top of that, as is the case with most superhero sequels, he suddenly finds himself without his powers (money and a suit of armor in his case) as he is marooned in Tennessee and forced to team up with a child for plot reasons.\n\nAnd how is Downey in the role? He’s alright. By now he can do the role of Tony in his sleep, and without that acting challenge, a lot of the film comes off as either dull or forgettable. The PTSD does give him a chance to flex his acting muscles, and it’s where he comes off best. Each of the movies I watched with him had at least one anxiety attack scene, but this one had the most. He has this ability to clam up and shake a bit, looking on the verge of nausea as he portrays a man trying to hide his inner fears and act strong in the face of internal adversity. It’s his biggest strength as an actor.\n\nBeing a Shane Black movie, the buddy cop dynamic is the other part that exceeds here, but it’s not prevalent enough to be effective. The old criticism of Marvel not trusting their directors rings true here. Watch Kiss Kiss Bang Bang instead. It’s a better movie for both Robert Downey Jr. and Shane Black.\n\nTropic Thunder (2008) Directed by Ben Stiller\n\nThe second Oscar nomination RDJ received came from a rather unlikely source. Ben Stiller’s Hollywood satire has become a crowd favorite, and while not a critical darling, it did get a sole Oscar nomination in the form of best supporting actor for Robert Downey Jr. It’s an interesting performance because he essentially plays 4 different roles inside of one, and its through his committed performance that each is able to stand on its own. They are…\n\nKirk Lazarus: a hard partying Australian actor with 5 Academy Awards to his name. This role is the most similar to the typical RDJ role, but thankfully isn’t given the most screentime. There’s an irony here that the “true” role of his is so similar to who he normally plays, but because he’s playing a dude playing another dude, he ends up trying new things for once.\n\nThe lead in Satan’s Alley: The fictional trailers give us a glimpse of what a gay monk drama starring Robert Downey Jr. and Tobey Maguire would look like. The look of introspective pondering RDJ gives at the end is actually really good- so good I wish he actually made movies like this.\n\nLincoln Osiris: The primary role he plays in the movie is Kirk Lazarus playing Lincoln Osiris in blackface. It’s certainly a take, and while he does a better job than I would expect from him, something rubs me the wrong way. Of all the great comedic performances out there, it’s the blackface one that the Academy decided to actually nominate.\n\nA Chinese farmer: Honestly, this was where he most impressed me. The only visible part of him in this costume is his eyes, and what expressive eyes they are! Cinematic acting is all in the eyes, and watching this scene made me wonder if that is where Downey’s true talent comes from.\n\nChaplin (1992) Directed by Richard Attenborough\n\nI’m trying not to be mean here, but it’s hard when a movie just did not succeed in what it set out to do. This movie doesn’t really understand what made Chaplin great. I’m not sure who is to blame here, but the end result is a movie that doesn’t come close to capturing anything beyond the facts of Charlie Chaplin’s life.\n\nDowney gives an adequate performance, and it would be unfair to lay the problems of the film (entirely) at his feet. He’s got the physicality down, emulating some of Chaplin’s routines decently enough. He’s just too reserved in how he plays him to interest me. I felt similar here to how I did with Anthony Hopkins in Nixon- he just doesn’t grab you. While watching the movie, he’s nowhere near the most interesting person on screen, so I wonder why I should be following him.\n\nThe movie also plays to the strengths of Downey that I don’t enjoy, namely the womanizing. Did we really have to watch Charlie Chaplin seduce each of his four underage wives?? I get that Robert Downey Jr. is good a playing a charming seducer, but was there really nothing better to show about him in that amount of time? And that’s not even the end of that element! We also get to see Charlie get two other women he didn’t marry, so there’s plenty of screentime dedicated to letting RDJ flex his charisma.\n\nI think part of what landed Downey his first Oscar nomination is lost on me by going backwards through his filmography. Prior to this he was doing comedies, so it was a big evolution for him to move his archetypal character to a dramatic film setting. It’s not unlike what he did in Oppenheimer, he made Charlie Chaplin into himself. The difference is that Oppenheimer was a well-crafted film and Chaplin is not.\n\nThe Pick-Up Artist (1987) Directed by James Toback\n\nI’m just going to start this one off by saying “I’m Sorry.” I looked up Robert Downey’s career and I saw that this was his first starring role, and I thought “I guess I have to watch that one then.” If only I had known…\n\nAs the title will likely clue you in, this is a movie about a young womanizer who never misses a chance to flirt with any woman he sees. He goes around New York helping kids play baseball, caring for his grandmother, and being an all-around charming guy while also being an unapologetic sex pest. It’s typical Robert Downey stuff. That’s not why I’m sorry I watched this. I’m not even sorry about how RDJ and Molly Ringwald have no chemistry together. I’m sorry because of how disgusting this movie is behind the scenes.\n\nAfter I watch a movie, I read a bit about the director and some behind the scenes information about what I just saw. Imagine my surprise when I found out that this movie’s director, James Toback, has over 400 accusations of sexual harassment to his name. He was a true menace and I hate that he got to make a piece of art (well, I might not use that word to describe this movie, but it gets the point across) that glorifies what he viewed as acceptable behavior. That is why I’m sorry I watched this movie.\n\nWhen I found this out I thought about watching a new movie and just not mentioning all of this, but that would be doing you a disservice. You deserve to know that you should avoid this movie on principal alone, because no one told me and look what happened. It’s an unfortunate thing to be the first starring role for a man who is now an Academy Award winner, but Downey can’t be too upset because he worked with Toback again a decade later."
