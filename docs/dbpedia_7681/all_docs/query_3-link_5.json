        "text": "The Fat Guy Strangler\n\nWhen Lois drags Peter to the doctor for a physical, his diagnosis is clear: he's too fat. This news drives Peter to form the NAAFP, an advocacy group for the advancement of fat people. Meanwhile, Lois discovers her long-lost brother, Patrick, and fights to get him released from an insane asylum. But a string of fat guys go missing soon after, and Peter and the NAAFP ban together to get to the bottom of it.\n\nMaggie Gyllenhaal / Robert Downey, Jr.\n\nMany Americans descend from a variety of European ethnicities, with ancestral roots across every country in Europe. Actors Robert Downey, Jr. and Maggie Gyllenhaal are textbook examples of Americans with a rich medley of European immigrant stories in their family trees. Delve into their deep American roots in early colonial communities and meet their Eastern European Jewish ancestors, who share almost identical migration stories. From the Mayflower to Ellis Island, journey through centuries of immigration that shaped and built this melting pot nation.\n\nActor: Award Worthy Movies\n\nAcclaimed actors Colman Domingo, Robert Downey Jr., Paul Giamatti, Mark Ruffalo, Andrew Scott and Jeffrey Wright on their first big breaks, the person they'd most want to work with and what they'd be doing if they weren't actors."
