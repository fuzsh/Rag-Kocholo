        "text": "First making his acting debut, Robert Downey Jr. made an appearance in his father’s film, Pound and ever since has worked in film and TV. He was in the ‘Brat Pack’ and his role in Less Than Zero made him critically acknowledged, because the role pushed Robert’s already existing drug habits one step further. After Less Than Zero, he appeared in much bigger films including Air America, Soapdish, Natural Born Killers and played an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor as Charlie Chaplin in Chaplin.\n\nAfter struggling with drug addiction, he joined the TV cast of Ally McBeal paying the love interest of Calista Flockhart’s character. Unfortunately, after two drug arrests in late 2000 and early 2001, his character was written out of the cast and he was ordered into rehab once again. This last time, he was finally able to kick his drug habits and stay sober—and his career began to take off. He began appearing in semi-independent films including The Signing Detective, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, A Scanner Darkly, Gothika, Zodiac and The Futurist.\n\nIn 2007, Robert Downey Jr. was cast as the leading role in the comic book adaptation Iron Man. Still in the top 20 openings of all time, Iron Man was an enormous success. He played in the sequel as Tony Stark in 2010 and in 2012 played him again in The Avengers and the trilogy, Iron Man 3 in 2013. He also played the lead in Guy Ritchie’s, Sherlock Holmes and its sequel. After the first Iron Man, he was nominated for and won numerous year-end awards from critics and film associates around the world. In 2008 he also had roles in Charlie Bartlett and Ben Stiller directed, Tropic Thunder. His second Oscar nomination was for Best Supporting Actor in Tropic Thunder. In 2009, he was the star in Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes and won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture-Musical or Comedy for this performance.\n\nRobert and his wife Susan Downey own a production company called Team Downey; their first project was The Judge, which was the opening film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2014. Robert Downey Jr. has been sober since July 2003 and attributes this to his family, therapy, meditation, twelve-step recovery program, yoga and the practice of Wing Chun Kung Fu. Robert Downey Jr. is available for endorsements, speaking engagements, and personal appearances.\n\nAPPEARANCES: Family Guy, Inside the Actors Studio, Late Night With David Letterman, Live with Regis and Kelly, MTV Movie Awards, SNL, The Academy Awards, Elle DeGeneres Show, The View"
