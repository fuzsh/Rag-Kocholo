        "text": "The bomb obliterated the toy. The doll with the blonde hair might have made more money back in the summer but that didn’t mean anything to the motion picture academy.\n\nThe three-hour historical drama Oppenheimer was the big winner at the 96th annual Academy Awards taking home seven golden gongs in total including the big one. Although disheveled Best Picture presenter Al Pacino seemed a little loopy during his unnecessarily oddball appearance at the end of the night, at least he was given the right envelope and said the correct title, a genuine worry since the La La Land/Moonlight debacle of 2017. (Where was Warren Beatty?)\n\nAs expected, Christopher Nolan was named Best Director. He thanked his wife Emma Thomas for not only producing all his films but all of their children as well. Oppenheimer also won for its cinematography, its original score and for film editing.\n\n“Proud Irishman” Cillian Murphy was named Best Actor who was the first winner to actually acknowledge his fellow nominees (“I’m in awe of you.”), a practice that used to be routine but was rarely employed this time for some reason. Noting how we’re all living in the world that his title character unfortunately created, he dedicated this prize “to the peacemakers everywhere”.\n\nHis co-star Robert Downey Jr. was easily the funniest recipient as he collected his golden naked man for Best Supporting Actor. Already making me laugh when he tapped his once coke-filled nose during host Jimmy Kimmel’s typically uneven monologue, he facetiously thanked his “terrible childhood” and even got a solid dig in at co-presenter Tim Robbins who had a Freudian slip while kissing up to nominee Robert De Niro during the presentation. (He said “Oscar-winning” instead of “Oscar-worthy” which was funny in its own right.) Downey thanked his second wife and dedicated his win to his kids.\n\nYes, instead of showcasing clips from their respective movies, the Oscars brought back the ass-kissing gimmick that Roger Ebert would’ve loved but for me instantly inspires ridicule, although the delightfully weird Nicolas Cage didn’t disappoint. I mean I was amazed none of the acting nominees were thanked for their extraordinary farts and courageous dumps. Retire the sucking up and bring back the clips.\n\nIt was a surprise to me that Emma Stone secured her second Oscar for her lead role in Poor Things but not for those who were paying much closer attention to industry insiders. Briefly overwhelmed and concerned about a possible wardrobe malfunction, she was gracious in thanking her family and her fellow cast and crew members, correctly noting it takes a team to make a movie. Besides Murphy, she was the only other winner to acknowledge her fellow nominees, even going so far as to “share” her prize with Lily Gladstone who didn’t get to make history herself. Hollywood must still be pissed at Sacheen Littlefeather.\n\nPoor Things won three additional technical Oscars for its costumes, its make-up & hairstyling and for its production design, taking away two more possible gongs from Barbie.\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph was named Best Supporting Actress, the only award handed to The Holdovers which lost Best Original Screenplay to the critically acclaimed Anatomy Of A Fall, its only trinket. “God is so good,” she exclaimed multiple times as she went on to thank her mom for convincing her to be more than a singer and give theatre a try. Gracious and emotional, she once “wanted to be different” but ultimately realized “I just needed to be myself.” She also thanked her publicist which led to a couple of other winners, including Downey, making tongue-in-cheek references to this moment during their own promos. (Downey thanked his stylist and the guy who tried to get him insured during his darker days.)\n\nThe Holocaust drama The Zone Of Interest was named Best International Feature and inspired the only direct acknowledgment of the ongoing genocide in Gaza as the film’s director actually mentioned the word “occupation” in his acceptance speech which was slightly undermined by him also seemingly knocking the resistance’s successful October 7 attack that caught an arrogant white supremacist army sleeping at the wheel. Both-sidesing a lopsided massacre just to make a point about dehumanization misses the point entirely. The film also won Best Sound over Oppenheimer.\n\nThe lone win for Barbie was for its hit song What Was I Made For?, the second songwriting Oscar for its creators, the whorephobic Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas O’Connell. They previously won for penning the Bond theme No Time To Die a couple of years ago.\n\nSpeaking of good nights for double winners, the Japanese anime legend Hayao Miyazaki, who wasn’t in attendance, received his second Best Animated Feature Oscar for The Boy And The Heron, 21 years after first winning for Spirited Away beating the likes of Elemental and Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse.\n\nCord Jefferson, the Best Adapted Screenplay winner for American Fiction, its only prize, made a good point about the “risk-averse” nature of Hollywood, how they’ll easily spend 200 million on a supposedly surefire smash (which lately hasn’t worked out so well) when they could make many more smaller budgeted films that would generate far more buzz and ultimately more profit. I don’t expect anyone to listen to him.\n\nAs for the broadcast itself, there were genuine moments of hilarity like Danny DeVito calling out Michael Keaton, his Batman Returns co-star, who responded with a perfectly stern deadpan; John Cena getting into an otherwise uneven argument with Kimmel over whether he should go through with a 50th Anniversary tribute to the infamous streaking incident and then slowly walking across the stage with a giant envelope across his crotch while humourously presenting Best Costume Design (not to mention him wearing a makeshift dress and then shaking hands with The Rock backstage); Steven Spielberg paying off a Kate MacKinnon joke about being sent “tasteful nudes” by simply nodding as well as selling a Kimmel reference to The Fabelmans with just a bemused look; and The Fall Guy co-stars Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt roasting each other and their respective movies over the whole Barbieheimer phenomenon.\n\nI also enjoyed the fact that some presenters did two awards at once which greatly saved time. But what was with the In Memoriam segment? Because they never went to full screen, you had to strain your eyes to see some of the names. The camera was too far away, there were no close-ups at all. It was aggravating and insulting.\n\nWhile it was wonderful that there will finally be a best casting director Oscar next year (MAY 5 CORRECTION: Actually, the award will be presented for the first time in 2026.), the best the academy could do for long suffering stuntmen was a clip package? Where’s their fucking Oscar category, you heartless assholes?\n\nThe complete list of winners:\n\nBEST PICTURE – OPPENHEIMER\n\nBEST DIRECTOR – Christopher Nolan (OPPENHEIMER)\n\nBEST ACTRESS – Emma Stone (POOR THINGS)\n\nBEST ACTOR – Cillian Murphy (OPPENHEIMER)\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS – Da’Vine Joy Randolph (THE HANGOVERS)\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR – Robert Downey Jr. (OPPENHEIMER)\n\nBEST ANIMATED FEATURE – THE BOY AND THE HERON\n\nBEST INTERNATIONAL FEATURE – THE ZONE OF INTEREST\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY FEATURE – 20 DAYS IN MARIUPOL\n\nBEST VISUAL EFFECTS – GODZILLA MINUS ONE\n\nBEST SOUND – THE ZONE OF INTEREST\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCORE – OPPENHEIMER\n\nBEST FILM EDITING – OPPENHEIMER\n\nBEST CINEMATOGRAPHY – OPPENHEIMER\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SONG – What Was I Made For? (BARBIE)\n\nBEST COSTUME DESIGN – POOR THINGS\n\nBEST MAKE-UP & HAIRSTYLING – POOR THINGS\n\nBEST PRODUCTION DESIGN – POOR THINGS\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY – ANATOMY OF A FALL\n\nBEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY – AMERICAN FICTION\n\nBEST ANIMATED SHORT – WAR IS OVER! INSPIRED BY THE MUSIC OF JOHN & YOKO\n\nBEST LIVE ACTION SHORT – THE WONDERFUL STORY OF HENRY SUGAR\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT – THE LAST REPAIR SHOP\n\nDennis Earl\n\nHamilton, Ontario, Canada\n\nMonday, March 11, 2024\n\n4:05 a.m.\n\nBEST PICTURE – OPPENHEIMER\n\nA failing novelist with an unexpectedly ironic success. A Hitchcockian murder plot involving a wrongfully accused innocent. The life of a famous big-nosed conductor. The rise and fall of the father of the atomic bomb. A 20th Century massacre against Indigenous Americans. A couple living near a concentration camp. A grumpy teacher babysitting some stranded students at Christmas. Two old friends, once close, now drifting apart. A bunch of different girls named Barbie. Emma Stone with bad eyebrows.\n\nThese are the ten nominees in the race for Best Picture this year. But let’s be clear. There isn’t a race. It’s a foregone conclusion.\n\nThat means you can easily forget about American Fiction, Anatomy Of A Fall, The Holdovers, Killers Of The Flower Moon, The Zone Of Interest, Past Lives, Maestro and Poor Things. As Michael Cole would say, thanks for coming. The producers of these films ain’t getting called up to the stage.\n\nSince July, the only two movies that generated any kind of significant Oscar buzz were Barbie and Oppenheimer. The shrewd marketing campaign of plugging both titles simultaneously with a single word brought large audiences back to the theatres, and not a moment too soon. COVID-19 shut down the business off and on for a significant amount of months starting four years ago as studios overly relied on streaming at times to try to make up for lost profits which ultimately didn’t work. (DVDs and Blu-rays are better, you knobs.)\n\nWith life more or less back to normal now despite the continued threat of these constantly evolving variants, few films in 2023 matched their cultural and financial impact. While the toy movie made more money, the three-hour black and white history lesson is the more traditional favourite. The Oscars are notoriously snobby towards comedies and that tradition will undoubtedly continue on March 10.\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan has been waiting for this moment his entire career. Now in his early 50s, although I haven’t seen all of his movies, I’ve yet to see him release a bad one. I liked Interstellar, really enjoyed his remake of Insomnia, marvelled at the inventive Inception and consider his Dark Knight Trilogy to be the best comic book franchise of all time.\n\nMuch like Steven Spielberg, the academy has been waiting to honour him with something outside the realm of fantasy. With Oppenheimer, they now have their opportunity.\n\nBEST DIRECTOR – Christopher Nolan (OPPENHEIMER)\n\nAs Roger Ebert wisely advised year after year, the strongest indicator is the Directors Guild of America award. If you win that prize, nine times out of ten you’ll go on to win the Oscar, that is as long as you’re nominated for one, of course. (Ben Affleck won the DGA in 2013 for Argo, but curiously did not make the shortlist for an Academy Award.) This year, Christopher Nolan won for helming Oppenheimer. There is no need to discuss anyone else. It’s his gong to lose.\n\nBEST ACTRESS – Lily Gladstone (KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON)\n\nIt’s the usual mix of newcomers and veterans vying for the top acting prize for women. Annette Bening’s been here five times since 1991. She left quite the impression in The Grifters, so much in fact that Warren Beatty cast her in Bugsy which left another but curiously did not result in another nomination. That wouldn’t come until another memorable turn as the dysfunctional, oblivious mom in American Beauty. After her nomination in the average Being Julia, she was also shortlisted playing one of the gay moms in The Kids Are All Right.\n\nWhich leads us to her lead role in Nyad about the famous open water marathon swimmer. Could she be a spoiler here? My guess is it’ll be 0 for 5 on Oscar night.\n\nCarey Mulligan’s had a couple of shots herself. She struck out for An Education, her breakthrough performance, almost 15 years ago. She was last singled out for the controversial Promising Young Woman where her whining about one critic’s review of her may have cost her a golden trinket. Despite having no such heat this time around, her ongoing slump will still continue as well.\n\nEmma Stone’s already won for La La Land and Sandra Huller will have to treasure being part of this rarefied company for what will probably be the only time in her career.\n\nThere have long been complaints about actors of colour not getting regular pushes at the Academy Awards. Lily Gladstone’s acclaimed performance in Martin Scorsese’s Killers Of The Flower Moon has been cleaning up on the awards circuit since the season began. Better leave some room on the mantle for the biggest prize of them all.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS – Da’Vine Joy Randolph (THE HOLDOVERS)\n\nSpeaking of that, here’s another opportunity to give someone, in this case a big Black woman, a significant mega push. Da’Vine Joy Randolph has been given award after award after award for her highly praised role as a grieving cook in The Holdovers.\n\nOriginally successful on Broadway where she was nominated for a Tony after playing the Oscar-winning Whoopi Goldberg role in the musical version of Ghost, she’s been in a bunch of films over the past decade including The Angriest Man In Brooklyn, which featured one of the last appearances of Robin Williams, the unfortunately awful Office Christmas Party, a couple of high-profile animated sequels and the recent Rustin where she plays the pioneering gospel legend Mahalia Jackson.\n\nEmily Blunt, who plays Oppenheimer’s wife, could play a spoiler here but I’m thinking the academy will reward her for something else down the road. Jodie Foster has already won two lead Oscars for The Accused and The Silence Of The Lambs, and while it’s been a while since she was last handed a golden gong, her chance of a third is highly unlikely. First-time nominees America Ferrera and Danielle Brooks, also longshots, will cancel each other out.\n\nIt’s Miss Randolph all the way for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nBEST ACTOR – Cillian Murphy (OPPENHEIMER)\n\nThe real and the fictional battle it out in the race for Best Actor this year. On the one side, you have the desperately mischievous author in American Fiction played by Jeffrey Wright who I first saw as the heel in the so-so 2000 Shaft remake, and Pig Vomit himself Paul Giamatti playing a teacher in 1970s New England in The Holdovers.\n\nOn the other, you have the famed New York conductor Leonard Bernstein as portrayed by frequent nominee Bradley Cooper, the Black closeted gay MLK confidant turned neoconservative Zionist Bayard Rustin as inhabited by Colman Domingo and the conflicted inventor of a horrific weapon J. Robert Oppenheimer, an assignment given to the Irish actor Cillian Murphy.\n\nWhile Domingo is probably the one nominee who would get the most from an academy push since he’s the only one most viewers have never heard of (despite a long list of credits including a couple of Tony-nominated stints on Broadway), all signs are pointing to just one likely winner on March 10, one who has already had an equally busy high-profile career in the business.\n\nI’ve been a Cillian Murphy supporter since I first saw him in Red Eye, a thrilling, tightly wound Wes Craven thriller mostly set on an airplane. As he delivers the heat in such a cold, detached manner for much of its running time, he meets his match in Rachel McAdams, his resilient hostage who knows how to think quickly and effectively in a crisis. The scene where she stabs him so hard in the throat he can’t speak inspired me to jump off my couch and shout, “Yes!” If only every movie villain left such a mark.\n\nA longtime favourite of Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer marks Murphy’s sixth collaboration with him. (Rejected as a possible Bruce Wayne, he played Scarecrow in all three Dark Knight movies.) More than 20 years after he appeared as a survivor in the overrated apocalyptic zombie thriller 28 Days Later, his Oscar night will feel far more triumphant. In the recent past, there was another Colman who ended up taking Best Actress by surprise, but in this case, the result will be far more predictable.\n\nMurphy’s got it.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR – Robert Downey Jr. (OPPENHEIMER)\n\nRight away you can remove Sterling K. Brown and perennial nominee Mark Ruffalo from serious contention, the latter having already lost on three previous occasions. Another academy favourite, the great Ryan Gosling, whose best work in Blade Runner 2049 and First Man were both criminally overlooked, has also swung and missed twice before. His casting as Ken in Barbie was divisive which I suspect will be reflected in the voting.\n\nCrotchety Robert De Niro, who recently lost a lawsuit to a former disgruntled employee he tortured and has been mostly wasting away as hardheaded fathers and creepy grandpas in one terrible comedy after another, is already a two-time winner. His latest Scorsese collaboration a rare critically acclaimed detour from his usual laughless fare. Although it’s been more than 40 years since he snagged a gong for Raging Bull, he ain’t winning a third.\n\nEveryone loves a redemption story, how one falls from grace only to rise from the ashes and scale even bigger heights of success, if you’ll forgive my trifecta of cliches there. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Robert Downey Jr. was a mess. Despite a very fine supporting performance as Michael Douglas’s agent in the excellent Wonder Boys and strong reviews for his brief run on TV’s Ally McBeal, his addictions were killing him. Had he not finally cleaned up his act, who knows how long he would’ve carried on.\n\nI wasn’t a big fan of the uneven Chaplin but he deserved that first nomination for playing the influential silent comedian. 15 years later, he had an incredible 2008, first playing Iron Man which became his signature role and getting a second nomination for playing an actor so desperate to win awards he employs blackface in Tropic Thunder.\n\nLooking impossibly boyish while approaching 60 as he continues to be one of the most well liked stars in the modern era, Downey has disproved Fitzgerald’s famous theory. He has survived long enough to thoroughly enjoy a second act. And it will be capped off with an Oscar for Oppenheimer.\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY – THE HOLDOVERS\n\nBEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY – AMERICAN FICTION\n\nBEST ANIMATED FEATURE – THE BOY AND THE HERON\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY FEATURE – 20 DAYS IN MARIUPOL\n\nBEST INTERNATIONAL FEATURE – THE ZONE OF INTEREST\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SONG – What Was I Made For?

Major moneymakers competing with smaller scale dramas. This year’s Best Picture category is packed with enough audience pleasers and critical faves to quiet down the usual grumbles about too many unseen nominees. In the annoying age of streaming, anyone with a decent service and time can now get caught up without even leaving their house.\n\nAs someone just recovering from a terrible flu bug, who is also currently caring for two parents with cancer, movie screenings have not been a priority in quite some time. Signing up with a streamer would not change that. (Strictly DVDs and Blu-rays for me, thank you very much.) And so I haven’t seen any of the ten films singled out for recognition.\n\nThat said, I think we can pretty much eliminate 80% of the contenders. The original Avatar was defeated by The Hurt Locker 13 years ago. Its follow-up, The Way Of Water, is not going to fare much better. The second Top Gun received far stronger reviews than its entertaining predecessor but it’s not going to win, either.\n\nThe European war remake All Quiet On The Western Front is this year’s Don’t Look Up, a film too divisive to generate substantial Academy support. Character pieces like Tar, Women Talking, Triangle Of Sadness and The Banshees Of Inisherin each have the Herculean task of trying to not cancel each other out while somehow individually rising to the top of the list in a very crowded category. Strong reviews won’t be enough to pull any of them ahead. In the case of Banshees, there’s been some very public tut-tutting about its supposed lack of authentic Irishness. The Weinstein smear campaign legacy never dies, does it?\n\nI would also cross out Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis as a potential spoiler. Despite raves from reviewers and audiences, I just don’t see it happening.\n\nWhen the nominations were first announced, only one title came to mine as a potential winner. And it wasn’t The Fabelmans, Steven Spielberg’s attempt to recreate the origins of his young burgeoning love for filmmaking in the midst of his parents’ disintegrating marriage, although there was a brief period where I wondered if maybe it would belatedly rise in stature.\n\nUnfortunately, despite mostly positive notices, the film was a commercial flop which doesn’t help its prospects.\n\nSince its release a full year ago, Everything Everywhere All At Once has been literally everywhere. Movie theatres, film festivals, streaming services, the Internet, DVD & Blu-ray, year-end Top 10 lists, award shows. Making three times as much money as The Fabelmans but a 20th of Avatar 2’s two billion take, it continues a remarkable recent trend of Asian-oriented films with widespread appeal that the Academy can’t say no to. When the envelope is opened, Everything Everywhere All At Once will be read off the card.\n\nBEST DIRECTOR – Daniel Kwan & Daniel Scheinert (EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE)\n\nI haven’t been as consistent on this in the past. But it only takes one burn to wise up.\n\nThe year The King’s Speech beat out The Social Network for Best Director, I had forgotten Roger Ebert’s edict. If you win the Director’s Guild Of America award, nine times out of ten you go on to win the Oscar. David Fincher didn’t win the DGA so I fucked up.\n\nYou’ll note I haven’t really made that mistake since. This year’s shortlist is all-male with Spielberg being the only previous winner. It’s been almost 25 years since he last snagged the golden gong for Saving Private Ryan. His drought will continue Sunday night.\n\nForget about everybody else. Because the two Daniels won the DGA for helming Everything Everywhere All At Once, hearing any other name being called out would be a genuine shock. Don’t expect it to happen.\n\nBEST ACTOR – Brendan Fraser (THE WHALE)\n\nA mix of familiar and unknown faces make up this year’s race for Best Actor.\n\nI don’t hear a lot of outright enthusiasm for Paul Mescal securing his first big win. The same goes for longtime character vet Bill Nighy and one of my personal faves, Colin Farrell, still a lovable rascal after all these years. They’re just happy to be invited to the party.\n\nFrom the beginning, this has been strictly a two-actor competition. Austin Butler has his fans being the latest young man to portray The King Of Rock & Roll on the big screen. Even the late Lisa Marie Presley vouched for him.\n\nBut look at those tearful speeches Brendan Fraser’s been making for his lead performance in The Whale. They always bring the house down. On Sunday night expect more of the same for the Canadian star who’s come a long way from the egregious Encino Man.\n\nBEST ACTRESS – Michelle Yeoh (EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE)\n\nOne of the more unusual stories of this year’s Oscars is the nomination of Andrea Riseborough for Best Actress. Her film, To Leslie, went mostly unnoticed by audiences. But her fellow actors, some of the biggest stars in the business, in fact, very publicly gave her a major, collective push resulting in her surprise admission to this exclusive short list.\n\nThe academy thought something was up but a very quick investigation, if you can even call it that, didn’t reveal anything that warranted her being rescinded from the category. So she stays. Barring some unforeseen circumstance, I just can’t foresee her winning, though, certainly not when you consider her competition.\n\nThe great Cate Blanchet who deserved her gongs for The Aviator and Blue Jasmine could play a spoiler here thanks to her latest acclaimed performance as the troubled real-life conductor who isn’t too pleased with the cinematic version of her story. Blanchet’s been compensated plenty in her career so I don’t think she joins the three-timers club, at least not yet.\n\nPerennial bridesmaid Michelle Williams, now on her fifth acting nomination, probably thought she’d be a shoo-in for playing a thinly disguised version of Steven Spielberg’s mom in The Fabelmans. Honestly, she could still pull off an upset but she’s young and talented enough to give the academy more options to reward her in the future.\n\nThe gorgeous Cuban star Ana de Armas, so great as Ryan Gosling’s loyal, paid electronic plaything in Blade Runner 2049, is hoping to do what Williams couldn’t do eleven years ago. Win a golden gong for playing Marilyn Monroe. It would be a stunner if this happens but I highly doubt it.\n\nThat leaves Michelle Yeoh who first popped up on my radar in Supercop proving she was as credible an action star as her collaborator Jackie Chan. Those athletic chops paved the way for even better films like Tomorrow Never Dies and of course Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.\n\nSeemingly lost in hopeless dreck like Last Christmas, she seemed rejuvenated by taking the lead in Everything Everywhere All At Once. Her Oscar win on Sunday will feel as much a career achievement as a historic milestone.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS – Angela Bassett (BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER)\n\nIt’s white privilege vs. women of colour in the race for Best Supporting Actress. History’s been overly generous to the former but that won’t mean a damn this year.\n\n2023 marks the 45th Anniversary of the original Halloween, the brilliant indie horror behemoth that sadly birthed far too many inferior sequels including the recently misguided revisionist trilogy. It’s the movie that put Nepo Baby Jamie Lee Curtis on the map and afforded her so many other jobs far less connected performers would kill for if they could get away with it.\n\nIt’s the high she’s been chasing every since and while I’ve liked her in other films over the years (including a decent cameo in the Veronica Mars movie), nothing she’s done has ever topped it. Let’s be real, she wouldn’t even be here were it not for Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh.\n\nAll that said, despite being nominated in the most decorated film at this year’s Oscars, Curtis can forget about cutting a victorious promo. It ain’t happening. Fellow white lady Kerry Condon doesn’t have a prayer, either.\n\nCurtis’s co-star Stephanie Hsu, who actually plays two roles in Everything Everywhere All At Once, will sadly see her vote split preventing a full fledged triumph. And when it comes to The Whale, who remembers Hong Chau over Brendan Fraser?\n\nAlmost 30 years after missing out for her excellent portrayal of Tina Turner in the unflinching What’s Love Got To Do With It, it’s finally Angela Bassett’s moment. After the death of Chadwick Boseman, the future of the Black Panther franchise seemed bleak. But rather than recast the role, the filmmakers came up with a sequel that still managed to mostly satisfy the insatiable Marvel audience. When Boseman was shockingly upset by Anthony Hopkins a couple years ago in a category that should not have been the last one presented, many were irate about the unexpected snub. Here’s a small way to make up for that.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR – Ke Huy Quan (EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE)\n\nIt’s young vs. old in the competition for Best Supporting Actor. You’ve got longtime character legends like 67-year-old Brendan Gleeson and 87-year-old Judd Hirsch each probably thinking it’s now or never to snag a golden gong after all this time. (Hirsch was last nominated in 1981 for Ordinary People.)\n\nThen there are the much younger first-timers: Barry Keoghan who’s 30 and 40-year-old Atlanta regular Bryan Tyree Henry.\n\nUnfortunately, not one of them will be called to the stage. That’s because the winner will be Ke Huy Quan. I had forgotten until I started looking it up that he was the annoying Short Round in The Temple Of Doom, the least appealing Indiana Jones adventure from the original series. Of course, he was also in The Goonies, which has aged so poorly I’m wondering why I ever liked it as a kid.\n\nFrustrated with the lack of non-stereotypical roles available in his youth, Quan switched to fight choregraphy sometime in the mid-90s. But now in his early 50s, yet still looking impossibly boyish with his trademark glasses and short hair, he’s back working a more regular acting schedule.\n\nSunday night is looking like a pretty strong night for former cast members of Encino Man.\n\nBEST ANIMATED FEATURE – MARCEL THE SHELL WITH SHOES ON\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY FEATURE – A HOUSE MADE OF SPLINTERS\n\nBEST INTERNATIONAL FEATURE – ARGENTINA, 1985\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY – EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE\n\nBEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY – TOP GUN: MAVERICK\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SONG – Lift Me Up (BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER)\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCORE – THE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN\n\nBEST FILM EDITING – EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE\n\nBEST VISUAL EFFECTS – AVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER\n\nBEST COSTUME DESIGN – EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE\n\nBEST MAKE-UP AND HAIRSTYLING – THE WHALE\n\nBEST CINEMATOGRAPHY – ELVIS\n\nBEST PRODUCTION DESIGN – ELVIS\n\nBEST SOUND – TOP GUN: MAVERICK\n\nBEST LIVE ACTION SHORT – LE PUPILLE\n\nBEST ANIMATED SHORT – MY YEAR OF DICKS\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT SUBJECT – STRANGER AT THE GATE\n\nDennis Earl\n\nHamilton, Ontario, Canada\n\nSaturday, March 11, 2023\n\n12:46 a.m.\n\nBEST PICTURE – THE POWER OF THE DOG\n\nIt’s not often the motion picture academy selects ten films for the biggest prize of the night but here we are. This year, it’s the usual mix of arthouse fare and crowd pleasers along with a foreign title and a couple of remakes thrown in, as well.\n\nThese races usually come down to just two or three possible winners with everybody else just happy to be included in such company. Despite making nearly half a billion dollars during an ongoing series of global crises, Denis Villeneuve’s new version of Dune doesn’t seem like such a sure thing to me. Ditto Spielberg’s updated West Side Story which has the burden of competing with the 1961 original and its ten Oscars.\n\nForget about Licorice Pizza, Nightmare Alley, Belfast, CODA and King Richard. Eyebrows would be raised if any of them snag the top gong.\n\nA possible dark horse is Drive My Car which has garnered widespread acclaim and could pull a Parasite-type spoiler win. Thanks to its wide availability on Netflix and high praise from viewers, Don’t Look Up could also swoop in and pull a major upset despite some loud critical grumbling that’s also been drowned out by appreciative climate scientists.\n\nBut my money’s on The Power Of The Dog. It’s been a long while since a western, a once ubiquitous genre, won Best Picture. Placed on numerous Top Ten lists last year and having already secured dozens of awards and critics’ prizes, it’s the one to beat.\n\nBEST DIRECTOR – Jane Campion (THE POWER OF THE DOG)\n\nIn the long, ugly history of the Academy Awards, only seven women have ever been nominated for directing. It wasn’t until Kathryn Bigelow’s victory for The Hurt Locker in 2010 that the 71-year winless slump finally ended. Eleven years later, Chloe Zhao took the prize for Nomadland.\n\nAcclaimed New Zealand filmmaker Jane Campion has already made history by being the first woman to snag a second nomination. Her first was for The Piano nearly 30 years ago. As Roger Ebert reminded us annually, if you win the Director’s Guild of America prize, nine times out of ten, you go on to win the Oscar. Campion won the DGA for her western adaptation The Power Of The Dog, therefore she’ll be securing the golden naked man come Sunday.\n\nBEST ACTOR – Will Smith (KING RICHARD)\n\nIn what is shaping up to be a fairly predictable affair all round, the race for Best Actor also appears to be a foregone conclusion. Denzel Washington has already been handsomely rewarded so he’s out. Previous nominees Javier Bardem, Andrew Garfield and Benedict Cumberbatch are all serious longshots. It would be a genuine shock if any of them pulled off an upset. (Then again, who thought Tony Hopkins would unseat Chadwick Boseman last year?)\n\nOnce dismissed as as a fluffy, squeaky clean rapper who parlayed his TV-friendly persona into a cushy six-year sitcom gig, Will Smith would ultimately and seamlessly transition into the more lucrative world of feature films. This year marks the 30th anniversary of his first foray into the cinema, the homeless ensemble drama Where The Day Takes You.\n\nStriking out on his two prior trips to the Oscars – first for Ali, the second for The Pursuit Of Happyness – Smith will finally take home the prize for playing the patriarch of Serena & Venus Williams in King Richard. If only Uncle Phil were alive to see it.\n\nBEST ACTRESS – Jessica Chastain (THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE)\n\nEven before the nominations were first announced, my money was on Kristen Stewart based purely on a TV ad. In Spencer, a film about Princess Diana, she transforms into the Princess of Wales not just through a hairstyle change but also vocally. Stewart looks and sounds uncannily like the blond beauty.\n\nBut for whatever reason, she’s not seen as the favourite in this category. Neither is Olivia Colman, a surprise winner a few years ago nominated again for the third time in less than five years, the last two consecutively. Penelope Cruz already has a gong herself, as does Nicole Kidman, making all three of them unlikely spoilers.\n\nThat leaves Jessica Chastain. Previously recognized without winning as one of the racist housewives in The Help and for the reprehensible Zero Dark Thirty a decade ago, I would not have figured her portrayal of Tammy Faye to be the one to beat. But she did win the SAG. Only seven of those 27 winners failed to go on to win the Oscar. Stewart, my initial guess, could still pull off a victory but it feels very slim at this point. It’s Chastain all the way.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS – Ariana DeBose (WEST SIDE STORY)\n\nSome performers don’t need academy recognition to become big stars or at least assure themselves a long career in the business. But a relatively unknown first-time nominee, no matter their age, getting a major push on Oscar night certainly doesn’t hurt their future prospects.\n\nIn the competition for Best Supporting Actress, this applies to three of the four first-timers vying for such a breakthrough. That means 87-year-old Judi Dench can sit this one out. She has her gong.\n\n39-year-old Kirsten Dunst has already been a star for nearly 30 years having had the good fortune of starting her career by landing key child roles in Interview With The Vampire and Little Women. A win for her work in The Power Of The Dog would really be just icing on her ever rising cake. But she doesn’t need it.\n\n53-year-old Aunjanue Ellis, who appears in King Richard, already has an extensive list of credits dating back to the mid-90s. But I don’t see her winning here, either. The odds also look slim for 32-year-old Jessie Buckley who will still benefit for making Oscar’s shortlist.\n\nThat leaves the youngest nominee, Ariana DeBose, from Spielberg’s West Side Story. Now 31, for the past decade she’s been busy warbling and hoofing it up on Broadway, most notably in Hamilton, after trying out for So You Think You Can Dance, as noted by the always revealing Wikipedia. Reprising the Rita Moreno role from the 1961 original, this will mark the rare occurrence of two actors winning an Oscar for the same part in different eras.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR – Troy Kotsur (CODA)\n\nJ.K. Simmons is the only nominee this year to have won this category in a previous ceremony. It’s doubtful he’ll repeat for playing the actor who played Fred Mertz on I Love Lucy. Everybody else is up for their own first golden naked man.\n\nI don’t see Ciaran Hinds taking it. Meanwhile, The Power Of The Dog’s Jesse Plemons and Kodi Smit-McPhee will both cancel each other out. That leaves Troy Kotsur. In recent years, no one film has really dominated the Oscars. Instead, the prizes are generously spread around. Most, if not all, of the nominated Best Pictures get some kind of token trinket. Kotsur’s acclaimed performance in CODA, a production mostly featuring deaf performers, will be its sole reward.\n\nBEST ANIMATED FEATURE – ENCANTO\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY FEATURE – SUMMER OF SOUL\n\nBEST INTERNATIONAL FEATURE – DRIVE MY CAR\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY – DON’T LOOK UP\n\nBEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY – THE POWER OF THE DOG\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SONG – Dos Oruguitas (ENCANTO)\n\nBEST VISUAL EFFECTS – SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME\n\nBEST MAKE-UP & HAIRSTYLING – THE EYES OF TAMMY FAYE\n\nBEST COSTUME DESIGN – DUNE\n\nBEST CINEMATOGRAPHY – THE POWER OF THE DOG\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCORE – THE POWER OF THE DOG\n\nBEST LIVE ACTION SHORT – THE DRESS\n\nBEST ANIMATED SHORT – BESTIA\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT SUBJECT – THE QUEEN OF BASKETBALL\n\nBEST FILM EDITING – KING RICHARD\n\nBEST SOUND – DUNE\n\nBEST PRODUCTION DESIGN – DUNE\n\nDennis Earl\n\nHamilton, Ontario, Canada\n\nSaturday, March 26, 2022\n\n2:21 a.m.\n\nCORRECTION: CODA is not an all-deaf production as I erroneously asserted. That line has been rewritten for the sake of accuracy. I regret the error.\n\nDennis Earl\n\nHamilton, Ontario, Canada\n\nSaturday, March 26, 2022\n\n7:06 p.m.\n\nOn August 8, 1997, a new film opened in theatres. Released by Warner Bros., Conspiracy Theory is a comic thriller about a paranoid cabbie who produces a regular newsletter filled with his outlandish ideas about government malfeasance. One such theory, however, turns out to be dead-on accurate suddenly putting his life in danger.\n\nEarly on in the film there’s a scene where he’s sitting in his cab. With tiny binoculars he watches a young woman through her window in her apartment building singing along while running on a treadmill. He figures she’s listening to the radio so he flips through the stations in his car hoping to match what he’s hearing to what she’s singing.\n\nIn the original script written by Brian Helgeland, the song was supposed to be Blue Moon, an old Rodgers & Hart number from 1934. Instead of securing the rights to the original recording, Helgeland wanted the song covered by Annie Lennox who conveniently was riding high at the time with her hit covers album Medusa. (The screenplay was completed in 1995.)\n\nBut by the time Conspiracy Theory had reached the post-production stage of completion in mid-1997, producers ultimately wanted a younger, hotter talent to cover a different song from a more contemporary era.\n\nIn February 1996, The Fugees released their second album, The Score. One of the big singles was Killing Me Softly, an uptempo cover of an old Roberta Flack ballad, vocalized by the charismatic 21-year-old Lauryn Hill. Along with other original hits like Fu-Gee-La and Ready Or Not, The Score would go to sell more than 20 million copies worldwide.\n\nBut complicated personal entanglements and internal struggles for outside creative freedom involving two members of the trio would ultimately derail the band just as they finally figured out how to get over with a mass audience.\n\nHill was having an affair with Jean and they were both cheating on each other. Jean actually married his other lover while Hill was having what would become a longterm common law relationship with one of Bob Marley’s sons, the father of their eventual five children.\n\nThe final straw was Jean’s refusal to support Hill’s desire to work on her own music outside the group, an idea she had openly expressed internally for a while but denied publicly to the press. At one point, probably realizing this might be the end of the band, Jean then offered to produce her but she refused. By 1997, Hill, Jean and their bandmate Pras would all focus exclusively on their own separate solo projects. Despite occasional live reunions in the 2000s and at least one single, there would be no collective follow-up to The Score.\n\nBy the time the producers of Conspiracy Theory came calling, Hill was in the third trimester of her first pregnancy and already working on her first batch of individual songs.\n\n“The recording took about a year and a half,” Commissioner Gordon Williams, the engineer of that eventual solo debut told Rolling Stone magazine in 2008. “Sony never wanted her to make a solo record; they wanted her to make another Fugees record.”\n\nIn the midst of all of this, Hill agreed to record a cover for Conspiracy Theory. With Blue Moon discarded as the possible song that Julia Roberts sings along to while Mel Gibson spies on her, producers had cleared another tune that had already been redone by countless artists before.\n\nIn 1966, Bob Crewe had suggested a title to his songwriting partner Bob Gaudio. From there, the two worked out a musical scenario, based very loosely on various real-life situations Gaudio knew about and personally experienced, involving a guy madly in love with a woman so beautiful he cannot look away, he is completely transfixed. Rather than record this new song with his vocal quartet The Four Seasons (which included Gaudio as a founding member), the song was constructed strictly for lead singer Frankie Valli who released it under his own name.\n\nDelayed for a full year, after a slow start, Can’t Take My Eyes Off You would go on to become a legitimate smash in 1967, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. Eleven years later, cast members of The Deer Hunter would sing along to its famous chorus in a scene before they get shipped off to Vietnam, a moment which eventually inspired the Broadway musical Jersey Boys.\n\nUnfortunately, Lauryn Hill had a big problem as the deadline to complete the sessions for her album was fast approaching.\n\n“She called me and said she was behind and had to get it done.” Commissioner Gordon told Rolling Stone. “She didn’t know how the arrangement of the song went, so we went and got a copy from Coconuts or Sam Goody.”\n\nFrom there, Hill and her creative team quickly put together their own version of the song, updating the arrangement with a more consistent, hip-swiveling gallop without losing any of its heart or soul. The famous horn and string sections from the Motown-inspired original may be gone (although that sure sounds like a slight sample of the former before the first chorus) but in its place is a funky contemporary take on the basic framework. There’s imitative Bobby McFerrinesque instrumentation, beatboxing, an old-timey organ and a smooth, laidback vocal from Hill who name checks the Warner Bros. film that commissioned this performance.\n\nCommissioner Gordon “had a little one-room 16-track studio in my apartment in Jersey. Lauryn was eight months pregnant, laying on her back on the floor, half asleep, holding a handheld mike. She did all of those vocals off the top of her head pretty much in one take, with the beat box and all of that. That blew me away.”\n\nWhen the song was completed, it was sent to Warner Bros. and quickly forgotten about. Hill gave birth to her son Zion four days after Conspiracy Theory began its late summer theatrical run.\n\nAround the same time of the film’s cinematic debut, the soundtrack was released. Curiously, Hill’s new cover was not included. In fact, there are no pop songs on the album, just 40 minutes or so of composer Carter Burwell’s classical score. Whether Sony, Hill’s label, played any role in Can’t Take My Eyes Off You being left off the record is unclear.\n\nRegardless, Hill told Muse magazine in 1998 that it was “a song that was never intended for radio play or even release.” With a new baby in her life and a solo album still to complete, Hill was too preoccupied with more important matters.\n\nFive months after Conspiracy Theory’s disappointing stint in North American theatres (it didn’t even make back its 80 million dollar budget), the movie debuted on home video and in February 1998, it started playing on pay-per-view and became available on satellite channels like DirecTV.\n\nIt had been nearly two years since the arrival of The Score. At the tail end of 1997, Wyclef Jean was the first ex-Fugee out of the gate with a solo album. The Carnival would spawn the Top 10 hit Gone Til November and ultimately go double platinum.\n\nBut fans were starved for more. Pras’ Ghetto Supastar album (the title song would get a huge boost from its association with Warren Beatty’s political satire Bulworth in the summer of 1998) wouldn’t be available until the autumn.\n\nLauryn Hill’s debut was still many months away at the start of the new year. But some of her more enterprising supporters were so impatient for this collection of new music to arrive, realizing there already was something out there in the public domain, they took matters into their own hands.\n\nIn the May 9, 1998 edition of Billboard Magazine, writer Datu Faison had a small entry in his regular Rhythm Section column under the header Bootleggers.\n\n“There’s a new recording from Fugees diva Lauryn Hill titled ‘Can’t Take My Eyes Off You’ that has everyone scratching their heads. The single was not serviced to radio by Ruffhouse/Columbia [Hill’s label which is owned by Sony], yet managed to garner 188 R&B spins according to Broadcast Data Systems (BDS).” BDS is the official Neilsen ratings system for radio.\n\nAccording to the brief report, some unknown parties had managed to tape the song as it plays during the middle of Conspiracy Theory’s closing credits. (It begins right after a snipped reprise of Frankie Valli’s original starts to fade at exactly two hours and eleven minutes.)\n\n“[S]omehow a pirate recording was made that was pressed onto CD and DAT [Digital Audio Tape]. It is also possible that someone who had access to the recording and/or master tapes could have also made pirate copies,” Faison speculated not unreasonably in Billboard since the full song is presented through the rest of the remaining end titles.\n\nAccording to BDS employee Lana Goodman, somehow, a bootleg copy of the song first ended up at KMEL, a San Francisco station. This was confirmed by another industry insider in the May 29, 1998 issue of Entertainment Weekly:\n\n“According to Michelle Santosuosso, program director at Los Angeles’ KKBT, some enterprising soul(s) taped it from the satellite dish when the movie made its pay-per-view television premiere recently and got the bootleg into the hands of deejays, who jumped at the chance to play the phantom single.”\n\nOnce KMEL started playing this cover of Can’t Take My Eyes Off You, it created a gradual domino effect. According to Faison’s Billboard column, “The song was aired again in April on top 40/rhythm [station] KUBE Seattle, and additional patterns were assigned.”\n\nSouthern outlets like WBHJ in Birmingham, Alabama and Baton Rouge, Louisiana’s KTBT ended up playing the song far more than the California stations on the west coast: 140 spins altogether compared to the measly 48 accumulated in San Francisco and Los Angeles. And that was just the beginning. Within a short period of time, the song was added to more and more playlists across the country and even on stations in neighbouring Canada. When all was said and done, the track modestly peaked at #35 on Billboard’s Hot 100 Radio Airplay chart but reached a far more impressive #2 on its Rhythmic chart.\n\nThis unexpected development greatly concerned Sony who had already drawn up big plans for Hill’s solo album. It had already been decided that Doo Wop (That Thing) was going to be the first single. (It would drop in June.) They feared it would be overshadowed by Can’t Take My Eyes Off You and therefore not as popular, a silly fear in retrospect since Doo Wop debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and would be the biggest of all the singles from The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.\n\nHill, on the other hand, had a different reaction. She told Entertainment Weekly in their May 29, 1998 issue that it was “flattering that they’re playing [the song]…” She told Muse that same year, “I thought it was kind of funny, another cover version taking off like that.” (According to the official Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons website, there are at least 200 remakes in existence.)\n\nUncertain at first about how to proceed, Sony was left with few options. They could ignore the whole situation and let the bootleg airings continue until the hoopla died down which was ridiculous considering how popular the song was getting. They could demand radio stations stop playing the song altogether which would have resulted in bad publicity and a fan backlash. As a reasonable alternative, they could simply release an official version as a CD single.\n\nWith The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill scheduled for an August release in the United States (September in Canada), Sony ultimately came to an obvious conclusion. With expectations growing to a fever pitch, that damn Conspiracy Theory track had to go on the album. (There would be no single release after all (although Sony would send promo copies to radio stations all over the world), hence its absence from the Hot 100 which only counted physical commercial releases at the time.) It had unwittingly become an effective marketing tool.\n\nWith the artwork and packaging already completed, and far too expensive to replace, Can’t Take My Eyes Off You would become a Stickered Bonus Track. (It would otherwise go completely unmentioned in the liner notes and track listing.) Even print ads would prominently promote the song making note of its unlisted status. (You’ll find it on track 15. It actually runs six seconds shorter than the movie version and rather than fading out, it ends cold.) As she later told Muse Magazine, Hill was far from happy about the decision:\n\n“I hadn’t intended to have a cover on the album at all…Naturally there was some record company pressure, but if I had my way it wouldn’t be on it at all.”\n\nBy this point, Hill was in the middle trimester of her second pregnancy and probably not in any real condition to put up a significant fight. (She would give birth to her second child, a daughter, that November.)\n\nIn early January 1999, the nominations for the 41st annual Grammy Awards were announced. Lauryn Hill would make history by securing ten, the most ever for an individual woman. One of those nominations was for Best Pop Vocal Female Performance. Her version of Can’t Take My Eyes Off You, a song that was only supposed to be heard during the end titles of a bad movie, was now in contention for a major prize. It had marked the first time a mystery track had secured a nomination since the full version of I’ll Be There For You by The Rembrandts just a few years earlier.\n\nA month later at the actual ceremony, Hill would bat .500 overall. Besides taking the golden gramophone for Best R&B Album, The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill was also named Album Of The Year beating out the likes of Garbage and Madonna. Hill would also win Best New Artist over The Backstreet Boys and The Dixie Chicks. Despite being denied nominations for Song and Single Of The Year, Doo Wop still managed to win Best R&B Song and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance.\n\nInterestingly, Hill found herself competing with her ex-boyfriend and bandmate in the Best Rap Solo Performance category. It was Wyclef Jean’s Gone Til November vs. her diss track of him, Lost Ones, another Miseducation song that initially got an unauthorized pre-album release. In the end, Will Smith’s Gettin’ Jiggy With It proved too irresistible for Grammy voters to deny.\n\nWhen the winner was announced for Best Pop Vocal Female Performance, Hill’s Can’t Take My Eyes Off You was beaten by Celine Dion’s unstoppable Titanic anthem, My Heart Will Go On, already an Oscar winner from the previous year. Still, five for ten was a very good night for the former member of The Fugees.\n\nFive months later, the song would find its way in an episode of the short-lived NBC daytime soap opera Sunset Beach. In the final quarter of its July 6, 1999 noon hour broadcast, journalist Vanessa (Sherri Saum) and her rescuer Michael (Jason Winston George) have a romantic picnic while Hill’s cover plays throughout. There’s no dialogue as the couple make out and walk around. On the final episode of the series, which aired on New Year’s Eve that same year, they were married.\n\nTwo months before that at the 26th Annual Daytime Emmys in May, Hill’s version of Can’t Take My Eyes Off You played in the background throughout a clip montage showcasing past winners of the Best Actor and Best Actress in a Dramatic Series categories. At the 27th ceremony in 2000, a taped bit involving Susan Lucci spending the day with her long sought after Emmy (she had famously lost eighteen times in a row before winning in 1999) was scored curiously to Frankie Valli’s original.\n\nIn 2008, ten years after its official release on The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill, an unauthorized remix started circulating exclusively in Europe.\n\nIn 2016, Hill’s cover would re-appear in the romantic comedy How To Be Single, albeit for a mere 75 seconds. It pops up at the 99-minute mark near the end of the scene when Dakota Johnson visits “best friend” Rebel Wilson and realizes she’s “super rich”. (If you listen closely, you can hear the shout-out to Conspiracy Theory when the girls sit down on the floor to eat.) Four members of the film’s cast, including Johnson, sing the song a cappella in a couple of scenes. (Damon Wayans Jr.’s on-screen daughter refers to it as the “Eyes Of You” song.) Hill’s Grammy-nominated version, however, was curiously left off the soundtrack. Conspicuously absent from the film, another remake by Walk Off The Earth, replaced it on the CD. (In the movie, an instrumental organ version chimes in just as the Hill version fades out.) In 2020, Hill’s take popped up again in the straight-to-streaming Disney+ sports feature Safety.\n\nWith the definitive Valli classic already a standard for more than 30 years and Hill’s song reviving interest near the end of the millennium, Can’t Take My Eyes Off You would continue to be covered in the decades to come and sometimes by the most unlikely people.\n\nThe late Heath Ledger would woo bitchy Julia Stiles with an a cappella version in the 1999 romantic comedy 10 Things I Hate About You, a modernized take on Shakespeare’s Taming Of The Shrew. The late Andy Williams, best known for singing the Christmas staple It’s The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year, covered the song in 1968 and many years later it found its way in Bridget Jones’s Diary in 2001. He re-recorded it as a duet with Broadway star Denise Van Outen (Chicago) the following year.\n\nIn a deleted scene from the 2002 live action Scooby Doo remake, Linda Cardellini’s Velma has a go Michelle Pfeiffer-style while the bald-headed villain tickles the ivories. In the 2005 sequel Son Of The Mask, there are multiple genre versions (rap, disco, country) heard during the Halloween party sequence, most of them sung by Jamie Kennedy.\n\nEven Howard Stern favourite Mr. Methane, the gonzo comedian who can fart on command, has attempted his own unique spin on Can’t Take My Eyes Off You.\n\nOn a March 2021 episode of her self-named daytime talk show, the first American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson covered Hill’s version as part of her regular Kellyoke segment where she performs famous remakes with a backing band. In 96 seconds, she more than holds her own as she confidentally rolls through the first verse and chorus in this shortened version. Her back-up singers even recreate the “bah dah” bit near the end.\n\nInterestingly, this is not the first time Clarkson has performed Hill’s R&B recreation. During a live gig in February 2019, before performing a complete version of Can’t Take My Eyes Off You, she dedicated the song to her then-husband. Nineteen months later, after seven years of marriage, they would be divorced.\n\nWhile it’s not exactly clear what Frankie Valli thinks of Hill’s rendition (his official website only acknowledges its “hip-hop makeover”, although in the very next sentence, which offers celebrity testimonials, she appears to be obliquely referenced as one of the “many other great recording artists” his band “influenced”), co-writer and former bandmate Bob Gaudio is most definitely a fan. When asked by Songfacts.com for his opinion, he offered the following:\n\n“I love the record, it’s one of my favorite versions.”\n\nAnd although initially disappointed by the absence of the famous horn section, Gaudio realized Hill’s version didn’t really need it to succeed:\n\n“But when I first heard it I thought she had the audacity to do this song without the horns. How dare she? [Laughing]\n\nSongfacts: That’s such a big part of the song, right?\n\nGaudio: I thought it was when I first wrote it. That was my big assignment: take the verse, which was soft and sweet and melodic, and then kick into the drums of the chorus. How do I bridge that gap? And the horns was the filler. I thought building with the horns to get to the chorus was the setup. And she comes along and doesn’t use the horns. But it still worked. So it was quite an interesting lesson for me.”\n\nWhy are there so many versions of Can’t Take My Eyes Off You? Valli offered his theory to Songfacts:\n\n“It’s a very, very tough song to do badly. When the song is that strong to start off with, that’s the kind of song you look for.”\n\nLauryn Hill proved him right.\n\nDennis Earl\n\nHamilton, Ontario, Canada\n\nThursday, May 27, 2021\n\n3:41 a.m.\n\nAnthony Hopkins over Chadwick Boseman? Frances McDormand howling like a wolf? Glenn Close dancing to Da Butt?\n\nWhat the fuck happened to the Oscars this year? In the midst of the ongoing Covid pandemic the show had to go on. But did it have to go on quite like this?\n\nTaking place at the Union Station in Los Angeles, a spacious environment once redressed for Blade Runner and Catch Me If You Can decades earlier, the 93rd annual Academy Awards felt like a more stripped down, subdued and deeply glum Golden Globes. You had to treasure levity when it appeared. And it did not appear nearly enough.\n\nAs expected, Nomadland took home Best Picture. What wasn’t expected was that it wasn’t the last award of the evening. It was third to last, the first time this has happened in 50 years. Equally weird was how early Best Director was announced. Out of the 23 competitive Oscars handed out tonight, it was presented 7th. The Chinese-born Chloe Zhao made history as the second woman (after Kathryn Bigelow in 2010) but the first woman of colour to collect the golden naked man in this category.\n\nWacky Frances McDormand kept it short and odd when she collected her third Best Actress gong for playing the lead which Variety and Vulture correctly called and I completely botched. With the academy spreading out the awards, it was the big winner with a mere three.\n\nWhile fellow Best Picture nominees Mank, Sound Of Metal and Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom all took home two technical trinkets apiece, Judas And The Black Messiah won Best Original Song for Fight For You, the only worthy nominee with its catchy, understated uptempo soul, and Best Supporting Actor for the appreciative Brit Daniel Kaluuya who appeared to embarrass his sister and confuse his mom with a very funny acknowledgement of how he came to be. He also paid gracious tribute to Fred Hampton Sr., the civil rights icon he immortalizes on film.\n\nSpeaking of Soul, it won Best Animated Feature as expected and took home Best Original Score, making Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross two-time winners. They previously won for their terrific techno work on The Social Network. Checking their white privilege, they let first-time winner Jon Batiste, Stephen Colbert’s Black late night musical director, cut an acceptance promo all on his own. Umm, we all know about the 12 notes, dude. Or is it 13?\n\nI don’t know what Glenn Close has to do to win a fucking Oscar but she’s now 0 for 8. The good news is she didn’t lose to Olivia Colman. Charmingly funny Yuh-Jung Youn (Minari) was named Best Supporting Actress which everybody except my family anticipated. The first ever Korean acting winner, she seemed as pleased to finally meet Brad Pitt as she was to be called up onstage. With funny quips about her sons and how she really feels about award competitions (she said she doesn’t believe in them, then zinged, in reference to her fellow nominees, “I’m luckier than you.”), she thankfully brought to life if just for a moment a very quiet room that seemed confused about whether to applaud at all during any of the presentations.\n\nBut the biggest stunner of the night would come at the very end.\n\nIn the past, the previous year’s Best Actor winner would present the current year’s Best Actress award and vice versa. Not at this bizarro Oscars. Men honoured men and women honoured women, not that that’s such a big deal, honestly.\n\nFollowing McDormand’s win for Best Actress (looks like Carey Mulligan got punished after all), the final award was for Best Actor. Let’s face it. We were all thinking it. They saved this category for last so they could give the late Chadwick Boseman, who was acknowledged in the quick-paced, Stevie Wonder-soundtracked In Memoriam, a gracious farewell.\n\nBut no. When Joaquin Phoenix opened the envelope, he announced Anthony Hopkins (The Father) as the winner for Best Actor. (Variety wisely suggested he could be a spoiler (like me, they picked Boseman to take it) and they were right.) Hopkins was nowhere to be found. He wasn’t even on Zoom. Considering how well Black talent performed this year, what a slap in the face to Boseman. And what a sour note to end a very strange ceremony.\n\nThe Father was also named Best Adapted Screenplay, another upset victory over the expected recipient Nomadland. As for Promising Young Woman, it had to settle for Best Original Screenplay, its only reward. The only Best Picture nominee to be completely snubbed was The Trial Of The Chicago 7.\n\nBecause all the Best Original Song nominees were performed during the typically asskissy and overlong pre-show, there was far less filler during the actual ceremony, although what was the point of Name That Tune other than to make Black people look stupid on camera? Not sure if Glenn Close really knew that song from Spike Lee’s School Daze (it felt like a scripted moment) but I did appreciate her twerking. And thank God for Harrison Ford reading those humourously brutal notes an unnamed Warner Bros. studio exec gave the classic Blade Runner.\n\nAs for Laura Dern’s hideous feather dress, bring back Bjork’s dead, wraparound swan. All is forgiven.\n\nThe complete list of winners:\n\nBEST PICTURE – NOMADLAND\n\nBEST DIRECTOR – Chloe Zhao (NOMADLAND)\n\nBEST ACTRESS – Frances McDormand (NOMADLAND)\n\nBEST ACTOR – Anthony Hopkins (THE FATHER)\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS – Yuh-Jung Youn (MINARI)\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR – Daniel Kaluuya (JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH)\n\nBEST ANIMATED FEATURE – SOUL\n\nBEST INTERNATIONAL FEATURE – ANOTHER ROUND\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY FEATURE – MY OCTOPUS TEACHER\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SONG – Fight For You (JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH)\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCORE – SOUL\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY – PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN\n\nBEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY – THE FATHER\n\nBEST VISUAL EFFECTS – TENET\n\nBEST FILM EDITING – SOUND OF METAL\n\nBEST SOUND – SOUND OF METAL\n\nBEST CINEMATOGRAPHY – MANK\n\nBEST PRODUCTION DESIGN – MANK\n\nBEST MAKE-UP & HAIRSTYLING – MA RAINEY’S BLACK BOTTOM\n\nBEST COSTUME DESIGN – MA RAINEY’S BLACK BOTTOM\n\nBEST ANIMATED SHORT – IF ANYTHING HAPPENS I LOVE YOU\n\nBEST LIVE ACTION SHORT – TWO DISTANT STRANGERS\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT SUBJECT – COLETTE\n\nDennis Earl\n\nHamilton, Ontario, Canada\n\nMonday, April 26, 2021\n\n2:40 a.m.\n\nBEST PICTURE – NOMADLAND\n\nShould we even being having an Oscar ceremony this year? It’s the question many film lovers have asked themselves over the past several months as the air date for the 93th edition kept getting pushed back. Now arriving on April 25th, we have a firm night and time to look forward to golden gongs being handed out to movies most of us haven’t seen, let alone pontificate for even a moment as we all shelter in place.\n\nBack in the early 1990s, when I was an aspiring teenage film critic in high school armed with more enthusiastic pluck than experience and literary skill, I had seen most of the nominated feature films well before the ceremony thanks to frequent and often solitary trips to various multiplexes and, of course, home video. But in recent years, I’ve found myself always playing catch-up, lucky to see even one nominee. In 2021, none of these films are familiar to me.\n\nThe nine nominated films for Best Picture this year were lucky to get any kind of theatrical release considering the sheer amount of time cinemas across North America were boarded up and closed due to the plague of Covid. Europe was a bit better in terms of containment which is why some Hollywood studios opted to go wider overseas where it was most likely for certain tent pole titles to recoup some of their exorbitant expenses.\n\nAlthough some of these nominated entries got a limited cinematic release here during brief reprieves from lockdowns, all of them were mostly available for consumption on streaming services like Netflix, Apple and Amazon. But how many of you took the time to watch even one nominated film? Realizing the inevitable, the academy loosened some of its eligibility rules to reflect this hopefully temporary change in distribution.\n\nYes, you’re right. I’m stalling with my prediction. So let’s get on with it.\n\nThis year’s race for me is really between two films which means Judas & The Black Messiah, Mank, Minari, Sound Of Metal, The Trial Of The Chicago 7 and The Father are all long shots to snag the golden naked man. No need to waste any more time talking about their chances.\n\nThat leaves the rape revenge thriller Promising Young Woman and the travelogue drama Nomadland. Both films in fact have their fans and their harsh critics. I’ll reserve my own judgment until I finally watch them. Considering the make-up of the academy (still mostly old white guys), I’d be surprised if Promising Young Woman gets the duke although ironically it has a stronger shot than most of the other titles.\n\nBut since the nominations were announced a couple of months ago, Nomadland was already talked about as the front runner. Barring an upset from PYW, the only possible alternative scenario I see (unless somehow upon reflection Aaron Sorkin’s Chicago 7 swoops in for the steal), it’ll be Nomadland picking up the trophy.\n\nBEST DIRECTOR – Chloe Zhao (NOMADLAND)\n\nI’ve said this before but it bares repeating. As Roger Ebert pointed out many times, if you win the Director’s Guild of America award, nine times out of ten you repeat the honour at the Oscars. Chloe Zhao, the director of Nomadland, won the DGA this year. She will win the Academy Award. Case closed.\n\nBEST ACTRESS – Carey Mulligan (PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN)\n\nThe usual mix of newbies and academy favourites fill this year’s Best Actress category.\n\nThe highly regarded Viola Davis has already won for Fences a few years ago. Some have pegged her for a second on Sunday for playing Ma Rainey but I’m not so convinced. Frances McDormand is so well liked and respected she has two of these golden gongs, one for the overrated Fargo and the other, more recently, for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Could she pull a Daniel Day-Lewis and make it a trio of golden naked men? Maybe but I don’t think so. She really doesn’t need it. She already has a fully honoured legacy.\n\nThe pop singer Andra Day won good notices for playing the jazz legend Billie Holiday and could very well snag a trinket. That seems unlikely to me, though. Ditto fellow first-time nominee Vanessa Kirby, a Brit who I’m sure is already happy enough getting high profile gigs in the lucrative Mission: Impossible and Fast & Furious franchises.\n\nNo other performance in this category has been as buzzed about as Carey Mulligan’s in Promising Young Woman. And while she didn’t do herself any favours by fundamentally misunderstanding the role of a critic (panning unsexy acting is part of the job description) and publicly whining about a positive review from Variety, a review that had been available online for a year before it suddenly got any criticism from her or anybody else, I don’t think that’s going to hurt her in the long run. Previously nominated for An Education over a decade ago, the Oscar is hers on Sunday.\n\nBEST ACTOR – Chadwick Boseman (MA RAINEY’S BLACK BOTTOM)\n\nWhy even bother talking about anybody else in this category? Ok, if we must.\n\nAnthony Hopkins already has his prestigious gong for The Silence Of The Lambs. Gary Oldman snagged his for playing Churchill in Darkest Hour a few years ago. Meanwhile, first-time nominees Steven Yeun (Minari) and Riz Ahmed (Sound Of Metal) have literally zero shot at winning this thing. They’ll have to be satisfied with just being invited to the party.\n\nLong before the nominations were even announced, the late Chadwick Boseman was already seen as the guy to beat here. Tragically felled by cancer at age 43, his career was just starting to flourish in the last few years. He managed to play James Brown, Thurgood Marshall and Black Panther, the latter two parts while quietly suffering with what must’ve been terrible pain and fatigue.\n\nHis performance in Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom won plaudits from critics and audiences who managed to see it. Winning the Oscar posthumously will be a way for the industry to acknowledge not just his work in this film but his entire body of work. I’ll be very surprised if his name isn’t called on Sunday.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS – Glenn Close (HILLBILLY ELEGY)\n\nIn 2019, perennial bridesmaid Glenn Close was the overwhelming favourite to win Best Actress for her lead performance in The Wife. So, when Olivia Colman’s name was announced as the actual winner, it was a genuine shock, most especially because she won for being in a movie literally called The Favourite.\n\nTwo years later, a surprising rematch is shaping up in the Best Supporting Actress category. Colman, who plays Anthony Hopkins’ daughter in The Father, is competing against Close’s unrecognizable redneck mama in Hillbilly Elegy. Is history going to repeat itself?\n\nNo. Colman’s not going to win a second gong. As for their competitors, lovely Amanda Seyfried (Mank), a possible dark horse, could come up from behind and slip in undetected, but I don’t think so. First-time nominees Maria Bakalova (Borat 2) and Youn Yuh-Yung (Minari) are unlikely recipients in their own right.\n\nEven though Ron Howard’s Hillbilly Elegy received much critical scorn when it came out last fall, Close’s performance, also curiously nominated for a Razzie, actually impressed many critics. Nominated eight times throughout the last 40 years, surely, this is the year she finally breaks through on Oscar night.\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR – Daniel Kaluuya (JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH)\n\nAfter years of justifiable complaints about the lack of Black talent in the acting categories, 2021 has proven to be an exceptional year. Just look at the diverse nominees for Best Supporting Actor, three of whom aren’t white.\n\nEven better, one of them is going to win and get a major push as a result of that win.\n\nThat means Sasha Baron Cohen (Borat 2) and longtime character actor Paul Raci (Sound Of Metal) will remain seated.\n\nBut it also means that Leslie Odom Jr. (One Night In Miami) and Lakeith Stanfield (Judas And The Black Messiah) are also unlikely to be called up on stage, if in fact they’ll even be in the audience at all this year.\n\nMuch like Best Actor, the Best Supporting Actor favourite emerged upon the announcement of the nominations. Stanfield’s co-star Daniel Kaluuya has been singled out ever since reviewers had a look at his portrayal of the legendary civil rights activist Fred Hampton. With renewed interest in the struggle for Black liberation in the wake of so many needless police shootings in the last decade alone, the release of the acclaimed Judas And The Black Messiah has been timely. A win for Kaluuya will not only be a boost for him. It will mean belated legitimization of a growing global movement Hampton played a major role in creating.\n\nBEST ANIMATED FEATURE – SOUL\n\nBEST SOUND – SOUND OF METAL\n\nBEST VISUAL EFFECTS – TENET\n\nBEST COSTUME DESIGN – MA RAINEY’S BLACK BOTTOM\n\nBEST MAKE-UP & HAIRSTYLING – MA RAINEY’S BLACK BOTTOM\n\nBEST PRODUCTION DESIGN – MANK\n\nBEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY – NOMADLAND\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY – PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN\n\nBEST LIVE ACTION SHORT – TWO DISTANT STRANGERS\n\nBEST ANIMATED SHORT – IF ANYTHING HAPPENS I LOVE YOU\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT SUBJECT – HUNGER WARD\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY FEATURE – CRIP CAMP\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SONG – Fight For You (JUDAS AND THE BLACK MESSIAH)\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCORE – MINARI\n\nBEST CINEMATOGRAPHY – NOMADLAND\n\nBEST FILM EDITING – NOMADLAND\n\nBEST INTERNATIONAL FEATURE – BETTER DAYS\n\nDennis Earl\n\nHamilton, Ontario, Canada\n\nFriday, April 23, 2021\n\n6:23 p.m."
