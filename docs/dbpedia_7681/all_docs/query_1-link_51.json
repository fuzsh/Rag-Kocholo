There are also three Bollywood A-listers in Forbes’ top grouping.\n\nBradley Cooper came in at No. 4 with $41.5 million. Cooper starred in and co-produced Clint Eastwood’s Iraq War drama “American Sniper” this year.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nDespite a recent slew of flops, “Pixels” star Adam Sandler ranked in at No. 5 with $41 million.
