        "text": "It seems like an odd category to focus on, but I was ruminating on two performances that have suddenly gained traction in the Oscar race. No, it isn’t common for Best Supporting Actor to be a hot topic this early out, but it is happening now for two reasons. And those two reasons can be summed up in one word: BARBENHEIMER!\n\nYes, that’s right. Two movies forthcoming competing with each other, to the great delight of the talented artists online, like these:\n\nThe purple one is designed by @nunosarnadas on Twitter.\n\nOh the internet. What treasures.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/thomashelby_obe/status/1678033950500077568\n\nOkay, so enough fun. Let’s get down to it.\n\nRyan Gosling seems to me a strong contender for Best Supporting Actor. The comparison that immediately comes to mind is Kevin Kline, who won an Oscar for his portrayal of Otto in A Fish Called Wanda. It is a brilliant performance in a film stuffed full of hilarious performances, from the Monty Python crew (Michael Palin and John Cleese) along with Jamie Lee Curtis. But the scene-stealer was Kevin Kline.\n\nDespite the many roles Kline performed, most notably in Sophie’s Choice, he’s remembered mostly for this great part. But when you look at the other actors in the race that year, it’s not that difficult to see how he won. At the time, there were whispers that he was married to Phoebe Cates, who is the niece of Gil Cates (who produced the Oscar broadcast 14 times between 1990 and 2008), and that made people wonder if Kline deserved to win or if it was about family ties. All of these years later, I think he was more than deserving.\n\nThe other nominees in Best Supporting Actor were:\n\nDean Stockwell, Married to the Mob\n\nRiver Phoenix, Running on Empty\n\nAlec Guinness, Little Dorrit\n\nMartin Landau, Tucker: The Man and His Dream\n\nGosling, like Kline, has built up cred as a serious actor for quite some time, although he has thrown in a comedic performance here and there (The Nice Guys). Seeing him let loose as Ken and quite possibly stealing the show does make it more than idle speculation that he could bring in a win for Barbie. Gosling has been nominated twice before for Best Actor for Half Nelson and La La Land.\n\nHe really does seem to be the one character who is dominating both the early conversation and the clips released by the studio.\n\nAlthough it did get a Best Director nomination, A Fish Called Wanda was not a Best Picture contender. But Best Supporting Actor of late has been frequently tied to Best Picture. 2011 was the last time a Best Supporting Actor winner was not in a Best Picture nominee (Christopher Plummer in Beginners) Other fairly recent winners not in Best Picture nominees were Heath Ledger for The Dark Knight (posthumously) and George Clooney for Syriana. The question to ask is whether those movies would have been included in the Best Picture category with an expanded ballot.\n\nBut what we’ve learned in recent years is that stats don’t matter — at least not until we manage to adjust our formulas to account for new trends and data points. The strength of the Best Picture nominee can sometimes matter. The last two Supporting Actor winners (Ke Huy Quan and Troy Kotsur) were in the Best Picture winners. That might not always matter if the film is beloved enough and/or makes a lot of money.\n\nThe other prominent Best Supporting performance that is being talked about is Robert Downey, Jr. in Oppenheimer. I already had him in my predictions based on his character’s significance in the story. Downey has been nominated twice before, once in supporting for Tropic Thunder and once in lead for Chaplin. Downey Jr.’s part in Tropic Thunder was the Ryan Gosling in Barbie kind of role. The movie was never going to get a Best Picture nomination, but his performance was notable because he’d largely done serious roles before and in this case, he was absolutely beyond hilarious.\n\nHe plays a white actor trying to play a Black character. It’s so funny and layered… no one has ever topped it. That year, he lost to Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight and it’s hard to argue with that win or that performance.\n\nTrigger warning for more sensitive readers:\n\nIn Oppenheimer, Downey portrays Lewis Strauss, who was the government official who really had it in for J. Robert Oppenheimer — a vendetta that lasted for almost a decade. He’s the primary villain of the film, unless you think of our government and military as the much bigger villain for dropping the A-bomb on Japan. Strauss is committed to bringing down Oppenheimer and is relentless in that quest. After reading American Prometheus, I just had a feeling Downey Jr. would slip in to that role expertly. So I’m not surprised that people are talking about his work.\n\nIt should be said that Strauss had an important legacy as a Jewish leader in government, and had tried to urge the government to accept more refugees from Germany. But because of his leading role in the government hearings against Oppenheimer, he would ultimately lose his bid to be confirmed as Secretary of Commerce in 1959.\n\nIt’s a great part, second only to the Oppenheimer’s, so I imagine Downey Jr. hits it out of the park. I have not yet seen either movie, but will be seeing them in the coming days.\n\nNow, we move on to your regular scheduled programming: where the Best Supporting Actor race was before Barbenheimer. Specifically, we’re looking at the strong supporting players from Killers of the Flower Moon: Robert De Niro and Jesse Plemons. Here is Erik Anderson’s list from June:\n\nRobert De Niro – Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple Original Films/Paramount Pictures)\n\nColman Domingo – The Color Purple (Warner Bros)\n\nWillem Dafoe – Poor Things (Searchlight Pictures)\n\nJohn Magaro – Past Lives (A24)\n\nCharles Melton – May December (Netflix)\n\nJesse Plemons – Killers of the Flower Moon (Apple Original Films/Paramount Pictures)\n\nRyan Gosling – Barbie (Warner Bros) – lead or supporting?\n\nRichard E. Grant – Saltburn (Amazon Studios)\n\nMatt Bomer – Maestro (Netflix)\n\nGlenn Howerton – BlackBerry (IFC Films)\n\nMarcus Jones’ analysis over at Indiewire is worth the read, but they don’t predict contenders that they have not yet seen.\n\nObviously, we can’t know how the Best Supporting Actor race will shake out until we’ve actually seen all of the movies. If the awards voters really love a film like, say … Maestro, then most of the actors will be swept up in that, which could mean Matt Bomer gets a nod.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon and Oppeneheimer are, I expect, going to be Oscar monsters. That doesn’t mean they’ll be the frontrunners. We know the game well by now. Neither of these sprawling epics is the scrappy underdog that could shock the world, but they will still come into the race with a massive number of nominations across the board, including in the acting categories.\n\nWill we have a perfect storm like we had last year, when voters were over the moon for one movie and it drove them to Baptist revival-level euphoria when it broke records for wins in acting and Best Picture? No movie before Everything Everywhere All at Once had ever won three acting awards, Picture, Director, and Screenplay. So you know it was the exact right movie about the exact right thing at the exact right time within the bubble of the film industry, with one foot in a portion of the movie-going Gen-Z crowd.\n\nWas it a culture quake? No. Did everyone see it? No. Does that matter? No. We’re navigating the waters of NICHE, unless by some miracle a Big Oscar Movie like Oppenheimer can win big. Otherwise the recipe for an Oscar movie is one that is popular with a very specific group of people. That’s not a bad thing. It just is what it is. Even with the social justice theme and intersectional cast of Killers of the Flower Moon, it likely doesn’t head into the realm of euphoria either.\n\nI’ll be keeping an eye out for that scrappy underdog that ignites all the feels. Might that movie be The Color Purple? It has one hell of an Oscar story. If so, Erik’s second choice of Colman Domingo could be a strong contender, and could easily beat Bobby D, who is playing a bad guy like Downey Jr.\n\nIn 1985, The Color Purple came in with 10 nominations for Steven Spielberg. It was the last film with a predominantly Black cast in the Oscar race, believe it or not, until 2009 with Precious. That’s because it caused a lot of controversy, from both the Black and gay communities, as well as those in Hollywood who thought Spielberg was trying too hard to win an Oscar. Over time, though, that movie has grown in esteem and has become much more admired.\n\nThis new version of it is based on the Broadway musical, as these things go now, but it’s said to be more in line with the Alice Walker novel’s intent — unapologetically gay, in other words. The film version of the musical is full of well-known actors like Louis Gossett Jr. as Old Mister, David Allen Grier as Rev. Avery, and Colman Domingo. Which of those performances will be the strongest, it’s impossible to say, sight unseen.\n\nErik has listed almost every possible contender under the sun in the alternate sections.\n\nThe one actor I think he missed listing is Dominic Sessa from Alexander Payne’s The Holdovers. It is essentially, at least according to this script review, a story about Paul Giamatti’s and Sessa’s characters, who are stuck together over Christmas beak.\n\nGiven all of this, here are my predictions for this week, not that they matter that much this early. Let’s do a full list for fun, just to see how off it is 8 months from now.\n\nBest Picture\n\n(A note about Best Picture – after last year’s almost complete takeover by original screenplays, we now have a strong lineup of adapted works)\n\nOppenheimer\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nThe Killer\n\nThe Holdovers\n\nPast Lives\n\nNext Goal Wins\n\nThe Color Purple\n\nMaestro\n\nNapoleon\n\nPoor Things\n\nAlts:\n\nDune Part 2\n\nBarbie\n\nFerrari\n\nPriscilla\n\nSaltburn\n\nAir\n\nThe Zone of Interest\n\nBest Director\n\nChristopher Nolan, Oppenheimer\n\nMartin Scorsese, Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nDavid Fincher, The Killer\n\nAlexander Payne, The Holdovers\n\nCeline Song, Past Lives\n\nAlts:\n\nDenis Villeneuve, Dune Part 2\n\nGreta Gerwig, Barbie\n\nRidley Scott, Napoleon\n\nBlitz Bazawule, The Color Purple\n\nMichael Mann, Ferrari\n\nBradley Cooper, Maestro\n\nSofia Coppola, Priscilla\n\nBest Actor\n\nBradley Cooper, Maestro\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nCillian Murphy, Oppenheimer\n\nMichael Fassbender, The Killer/Next Goal Wins\n\nPaul Giamatti, The Holdovers\n\nAlts:\n\nJoaquin Phoenix, Napoleon\n\nColman Domingo, Rustin\n\nTimothée Chalamet, Dune Part 2\n\nAdam Driver, Ferrari\n\nAnthony Hopkins, Freud’s Last Session\n\nBarry Keoghan, Saltburn\n\nBest Actress\n\n(A note on Best Actress: because of the kerfuffle last year with Andrea Riseborough supposesly taking the two slots for two women of color, I expect this category will over-compensate in that regard to make up for last year.
