        "text": "Variety Awards Circuit section is the home for all awards news and related content throughout the year, featuring the following: the official predictions for the upcoming Oscars, Emmys, Grammys and Tony Awards ceremonies, curated by Variety senior awards editor Clayton Davis. The prediction pages reflect the current standings in the race and do not reflect personal preferences for any individual contender. As other formal (and informal) polls suggest, competitions are fluid and subject to change based on buzz and events. Predictions are updated every Thursday.\n\nVisit the prediction pages for the respective ceremonies via the links below:\n\nOSCARS | EMMYS | GRAMMYS | TONYS\n\n2024 Oscars Predictions:\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nWeekly Commentary (Updated March 7, 2024): There’s no way to prove this statement, but I think Robert Downey Jr is winning by such a wide margin for his work in “Oppenheimer.”\n\nWith Critics Choice, Golden Globes, SAG and BAFTA in his pocket, no supporting actor winner has lost the Oscar with victories from all four groups.\n\nAnd then there’s Ken. Ryan Gosling’s scene-stealing turn in “Barbie” has been a fan-favorite, and with the social media firestorm that’s pulsating with the snubs of director Greta Gerwig and lead actress Margot Robbie (who are still individually nominated in adapted screenplay and best picture). People love him, and he does have admirers out there, but so does Sterling K. Brown for “American Fiction.” I don’t think it’s enough to challenge RDJ.\n\nWill Win: Robert Downey Jr. (“Oppenheimer”)\n\nCould Win: Ryan Gosling (“Barbie”)\n\nShould Win: Ryan Gosling\n\nShould have been here: John Magaro (“Past Lives”) and Milo Machado Graner (“Anatomy of a Fall”)\n\nRead: Variety’s Awards Circuit for the latest Oscars predictions in all categories.\n\nThe 96th Oscars will be held on Sunday, March 10.\n\nAnd the Nominees Are:\n\nEligiblities From 2023 (Alphabetized by Studio)**\n\n** This official list is incomplete, with all release dates not yet confirmed and subject to change.\n\n2022 category winner: Ke Huy Quan, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (A24)\n\nOscars Predictions Categories\n\nBEST PICTURE | DIRECTOR | BEST ACTOR | BEST ACTRESS | SUPPORTING ACTOR | SUPPORTING ACTRESS | ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY | ADAPTED SCREENPLAY | ANIMATED FEATURE | PRODUCTION DESIGN | CINEMATOGRAPHY | COSTUME DESIGN | FILM EDITING | MAKEUP & HAIRSTYLING | SOUND | VISUAL EFFECTS | ORIGINAL SCORE | ORIGINAL SONG | DOCUMENTARY FEATURE | INTERNATIONAL FEATURE | ANIMATED SHORT | DOCUMENTARY SHORT | LIVE ACTION SHORT\n\nAbout the Academy Awards\n\nThe Academy Awards, better known as the Oscars, is Hollywood’s most prestigious artistic award in the film industry. Since 1927, nominees and winners have been selected by members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). Seventeen branches are represented within the nearly 10,000-person membership. The branches are actors, associates, casting directors, cinematographers, costume designers, directors, documentary, executives, film editors, makeup and hairstylists, marketing and public relations, members-at-large, members-at-large (artists’ representatives), music, producers, production design, short films and feature animation, sound, visual effects and writers."
