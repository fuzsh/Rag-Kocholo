        "text": "Robert Downey Jr. is officially coming back to the MCU. But not as Iron Man… As Doctor Doom. He’ll play the iconic Marvel villain in Avengers 5, which is now named Avengers: Doomsday.\n\nThe news was revealed as the wild capper to Marvel Studios’s Hall H panel at San Diego Comic-Con, where Downey Jr. entered to green lights in full Doom regalia. “New mask, same task” quipped Downey Jr. as he stunned the crowd with his return after the death of his similarly iconic character in Avengers: Endgame.\n\nHe’ll replace Jonathan Majors’s Kang as the main villain of the fifth Avengers movie, which was originally titled Avengers: Kang Dynasty — and potentially feature in some way in Avengers: Secret Wars, the sixth Avengers movie as well. That seems a logical connection for two reasons, though it has yet to be announced.\n\nThe first reason? In the comics by Jonathan Hickman that most assume this Secret Wars will be based on, Doom is the main villain. After “saving” bits of the multiverse, he remakes a patchwork planet in his image, and is opposed by the Fantastic Four. As we learned earlier in the panel the new Fantastic Four will feature in both Avengers sequels, it seems reasonable to think these two movies will be loose adaptations of the storyline.\n\nThe second reason? The other big announcement was that the Russo Brothers are indeed returning to direct both upcoming Avengers movies, as previously reported. So, the directors of Infinity War and Endgame, back to direct a two-part Avengers epic? Yeah, draw your own conclusions.\n\nAvengers: Doomsday is currently scheduled to be released on May 1, 2026, while Avengers: Secret Wars will be released on May 7, 2027. But I’d be pretty surprised if we didn’t see a glimpse of Dr. Tony Doom in the upcoming Fantastic Four.\n\nListen to MarvelVision:\n\nWant more deep dives into Marvel Studios’ TV shows and movies?
