        "text": "While Robert Downey, Jr. has had his issues off the screen, I find him at times to be a brilliant actor.\n\nI really liked him in \" Wonder Boys\", but then I really liked the entire movie.\n\nThe point is that he's a white actor who is dyed his skin to get a part. So perhaps part of the movie has him as a white actor..and the other part (post skin dye) black.\n\nI think it would be much different if the part was suposed to be a black dude, but they just casted a white guy and had to change him up.\n\nNobody seems to care when it's the other way around of course...that would make too much sense."
