        "text": "There was a brief reprieve as Robert Downey Jr. joined the cast of the TV series Ally McBeal (for which he won a Golden Globe award for Best Performance). However, his character was written out after a pair of drug arrests at the turn of the Millennium. After one last stay in a court ordered rehab, he finally achieved sobriety.\n\nDowney was ranked at 31st in the 2019 Forbes list of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors with an estimated US$66million in earnings. Funny, smart and interesting, he’s one of the more likeable Hollywood actors.\n\nMarried to producer Susan Downey (nee Levin) since 2005, they are raising their son, Exton (7) and daughter Avril (5). The actor has another son, Indio, 26, from a previous marriage to Deborah Falconer from 1992 to 2004."
