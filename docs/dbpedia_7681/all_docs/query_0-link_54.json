        "text": "“American Fiction”\n\n“Anatomy of a Fall”\n\n“Barbie”\n\n“The Holdovers”\n\n“Killers of the Flower Moon”\n\n“Maestro”\n\n✓“Oppenheimer”\n\n“Past Lives”\n\n“Poor Things”\n\n“The Zone of Interest”\n\nLet’s be real: The best picture race is locked up for “Oppenheimer.” Christopher Nolan gave Oscar voters an IMAX-sized helping of their favorite genre — the great-man-of-history biopic — and after the movie made nearly a billion dollars worldwide, its path to the top Oscar was clear.\n\nStill, why not add some stakes to the situation? See whether you can sabotage the people in your Oscar pool by convincing them that a dark-horse candidate can topple Nolan’s mighty contender.\n\nSuggest, for example, that “The Holdovers” may mirror the little-film-that-could trajectory of “CODA” (though you’d better leave out that “The Holdovers” didn’t win the top prize at the Producers Guild Awards, as “CODA” so tellingly did). Note that the expansive international contingent of the academy could swing things toward “Anatomy of a Fall” (though if that were the case, we would have seen signs of it at last month’s BAFTA ceremony). Or mention that the path to best picture tends to go through the screenplay categories, and since “Oppenheimer” is in danger of losing a writing trophy to “American Fiction” or “Barbie,” maybe those movies are the real threats.\n\nJonathan Glazer, “The Zone of Interest”\n\nYorgos Lanthimos, “Poor Things”\n\n✓Christopher Nolan, “Oppenheimer”\n\nMartin Scorsese, “Killers of the Flower Moon”\n\nJustine Triet, “Anatomy of a Fall”\n\nThough the 53-year-old Nolan has come to be regarded as the premier blockbuster director of his generation, one feat he still hasn’t managed is winning an Academy Award. That will finally change this weekend, completing a journey that started 15 years ago when the Oscars expanded the amount of best picture nominees after his film “The Dark Knight” was snubbed in the two top categories. Now, Nolan will win both.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
