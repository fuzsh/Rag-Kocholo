Patrick seems sane, so Lois checks him out of the asylum to live with the Griffins. Elsewhere, Peter starts a Society for the Acceptance of Fat Men, but when a fat man is strangled in Quahog, Peter and his Fat Society live in terror and fingers point to Patrick.\n\nRobert Duvall, Robert Downey Jr, Stephen Fry and U2\n\nTogether on Graham's sofa tonight: Oscar-winning star of `The Godfather' and `Apocalypse Now' Robert Duvall, `Iron Man' himself Robert Downey Jr, starring in new movie `The Judge', Stephen Fry, talking about his new memoir `More Fool Me', and U2.\n\nMaggie Gyllenhaal / Robert Downey, Jr.\n\nActors Robert Downey, Jr and Maggie Gyllenhaal are textbook examples of Americans with a rich tapestry of European immigrant stories making up their family trees. We delve in to their deep American roots in early colonial communities, and we meet their Eastern European Jewish ancestors, who share almost identical migration stories."
