        "text": "Is there such a thing as too much airflow?\n\n(Image: © Niels Broekhuijsen, Tom's Hardware)\n\nWhy you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.\n\nWe are using the following system for our case test bed:\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally\n\nCPUIntel Core i9-9900KMotherboardAsus Maximus XI Hero WiFiMemoryCorsair Vengeance LPX 3000 MHz, 16 GB (2x 8GB)GraphicsNvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super Founder's EditionCPU CoolingNoctua NH-U12S Chromax.BlackRow 5 - Cell 0 Noctua NT-H2 Thermal PasteStorageCorsair Force Series MP510 NVMe SSD, 480GBPower SupplyFractal Design Ion+ 2 Platinum 860W\n\nMotherboard Installation\n\nDropping the motherboard into the Torrent was a breeze, as the chassis has tons of space and a central anchoring standoff is included. Of course, we did already pre-install the CPU, cooler, memory, and SSD to save time.\n\nGPU Install\n\nOur RTX 2070 Super installed just as easily, slotting right into place in the second and third expansion slots.\n\nPSU Install\n\nInstalling the power supply required the extra step of opening the top of the case, exposing a sort of ‘bucket’ into which the PSU is dropped. I quite like this system actually – not only does it make installing the power supply a breeze, connecting cables is also easy, there is a ton of space for larger power supplies, and with the case’s design placing half the PSU below the top line, and half above into the cover, the power supply is visually hidden away quite well.\n\nImage 1 of 2\n\nCable Management\n\nWhen it comes to cable management, I was a little less impressed with the torrent. In theory, all the basics are present: ample space behind the motherboard tray, Velcro ties, space in the PSU compartment to chuck cable slack – but it’s the fan and RGB cables that upset me most. The case comes with five fans, and each has its own power cable and RGB cable – that’s a total of ten cables you have to tidy up just for the fans, and they all come together at the bottom of the chassis where there isn’t a lot of space to chuck excess length.\n\nThere is also no RGB hub, but the cables do daisy-chain so you can connect them all without needing extra gadgets. That said, I do recommend you split the devices over two A-RGB ports on your motherboard, so as not to overload a single connector, as five large fans and an RGB strip near the PSU may be a bit much otherwise.\n\nRegardless, after about 15 minutes of connecting and tidying cables, above is the end result. It isn’t particularly pretty, and you can do a nicer job than this with some added effort and zipties to minimize the clutter in the excess fan cables, but this system is about to be de-installed anyway, so I didn’t bother spending more time on it. I slapped the panels on, and with that, the build was complete.\n\nBuild Complete\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nCurrent page: Hardware Installation\n\nPrev Page Features and Specifications Next Page Testing and Conclusion\n\nNiels Broekhuijsen is a Contributing Writer for Tom's Hardware US.
