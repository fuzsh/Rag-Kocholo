        "text": "Using your operating system, if you set the IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.2), subnet mask (e.g. 255.255.255.0), default gateway (e.g. 192.168.1.1) and DNS (e.g. 192.168.1.1 or 8.8.8.8) manually on both the PC LAN and Wifi Interfaces, the router will be forced to talk to your PC using that IP address, regardless whether you are using the LAN or Wifi. Just make sure you do not connect both at the same time.\n\nI don't think you can forward the SAME port to 2 IP addresses (without spoofing the MAC which could lead to problems, as discussed above).\n\nOne solution would be to turn on uPNP on both the router and the torrent client, which automatically forwards ports for you. (delete the manual forward)\n\nIn some routers you can assign an IP to a MAC address (I believe you can do that for two as well).\n\nSo forward the port to that IP, and save that IP for both your ethernet MAC address and your wifi MAC address. On a second hand, my router doesn't allow me to do that so perhaps it isn't possible...\n\nI've got it! Ubuntu lets you fake your MAC address, so perhaps you can do that to have the same MAC address for both the wifi and the ethernet interface!\n\nThen just add a static IP for that address\n\nAnd finally forward to that IP.\n\nYou might not be an ubuntu user, but if you can do it there, you can probably do it everywhere else."
