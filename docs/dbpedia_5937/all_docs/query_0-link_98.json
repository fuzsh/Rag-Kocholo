        "text": "Torrent Group took over and successfully turned around an ailing power cable company Mahendra Electricals,[4] renaming it as ‘Torrent Cables Ltd.’ (now merged with Torrent Power w.e.f. 1 April 2014). The high points of Torrent’s foray into power however were the acquisitions of two of India’s oldest utilities – The Surat Electricity Company Ltd and The Ahmedabad Electricity Company Ltd. In 1997, the company completed its acquisition of the Ahmedabad Electricity Company by purchasing the entire 28.89% stake held by the Gujarat government.[5] This acquisition formed what was then known as Torrent Power AEC Limited. Similarly, Torrent Power SEC Limited was formed after acquiring the Surat Electricity Company in the same deal. Torrent turned them into first-rate power utilities, in terms of operational efficiencies and reliability of power supply.\n\nIn 2005, the parent company, Torrent Group floated the company Torrent Power Generation to further expand into the power business. In 2006, the three power-related companies of Torrent Group, Torrent Power AEC Ltd, Torrent Power SEC Ltd, and Torrent Power Generation Ltd were merged to form Torrent Power.[6] Torrent Power created history by entering into the country’s first distribution franchisee agreement with Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited for Bhiwandi Circle in December 2006. In 2009 it was awarded the distribution franchise for Agra in Uttar Pradesh. During FY 19 the Company was awarded a distribution license for Dholera Special Investment Region (in Gujarat) and distribution franchise for Shil, Mumbra & Kalwa (SMK) area in Mumbai Metropolitan Region of Maharashtra."
