Also, have you confirmed what your 5800X and 3080Ti package power values are at idle?\n\nI know for example, in my own experience, an overclocked Ryzen can consume as much as 30-40W at idle, and sometimes an RTX 30 series can sit at 110w idle if there's something preventing it from clocking down (there are various reasons).\n\nAnyway these ideally should be down below 20w each. No hating on AMD, but traditionally their desktop CPUs have idled poor idle power states, but even then, 18w at idle should be attainable.\n\nSee what Hwinfo says while you're idling."
