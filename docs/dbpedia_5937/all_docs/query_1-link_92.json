        "text": "Abstract: This case describes the measures initiated by Torrent Cables Limited to fight the recession. The issue is one of strengthening the measures and introducing new initiatives to prevent the company from becoming sick again. In 1989, the torrent group acquired a sick company and initiated a series of measures to turn it around. The company turned around but faced a recessionary situation in the subsequent year. The management tried to fight the recession. This effort needed to be evaluated and new measures suggested to prevent the company from becoming sick again."
