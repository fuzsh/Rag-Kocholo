        "text": "Please before you start commenting about breaking the law etc etc notice that there are many freeware programs out there which you can download and share freely.\n\nAlso, I would have posted more links for the software you need to do this, but I do not have enough reputation\n\nFirst of all these are the things you need to start your project\n\nYour Raspberry Pi A USB HUB with power A USB hard disk ...and a keyboard to start with\n\nNow we have to go to our windows computer to format our USB Disk and prepare the SD Card. I prefer this free Mini tool Partition Wizard. You can get it from here http://download.cnet.com/MiniTool-Partition-Wizard-Home-Edition/3000-2094_4-10962200.html\n\nTo prepare the SD Card. To do that you need a program called Win32DiskImager Extract the exe an install it.\n\nThen we have to download the Raspberry Pi distribution. I use the latest distribution from Pi’s official site. The image I use is the 2013-05-25-wheezy-raspbian.\n\nExtract the image file and start Win32DiskImager, Select your downloaded image, you SDCard device and press Write. Wait until the image is ready. Now we are ready to start.\n\nPut the SDCard to your Pi and put the power cable in. In this step you need to have a keyboard connected to your Pi and a monitor to see what’s heppening.\n\nNow you are ready to start. First of all you have to setup your device to run the raspbian. Also as you will use the Pi for torrenting you don’t need the GUI.\n\nFinish all the proper adjustments and press finish.\n\nYour device will restart and you have to log in. The defaults are\n\nUSER:pi\n\nPASSWORD:raspberry\n\nIf you have changed your password use the new password.\n\nYou are now logged in. Write down the IP address of your device so you can connect to it later, It is something like 192.168.1.24.\n\nKey in\n\nsudo shutdown –h now\n\nand wait for the device to shut down. At this point you can remove the keyboard and the monitor and connect the HDD and the HUB as above. Start the Pi and leave it there.\n\nYou can go now to back to your Windows computer. I use PuTTY to connect via SSH on Windows. It is freeware and you can download it online.\n\nRun putty and write the address of your pi (in my case it is 192.168.1.24) Log in the Pi using pi as user and your password\n\nI have renamed my device as mypi the default name is raspberrypi And now it is time to start. What I usually do is that I shutdown the pi and put the SD card back into the computer. I start Win32DiskImager and save my work to an image file (you can give to it any name) so if (better is when) I make a mistake I will not lose all my work. If you press read the program copies the SD Card to an image file which you can write back\n\nNow we are back logged in the pi.\n\nTIP If you don’t like typing you can copy the text from windows and paste it to putty with a right click\n\nFirst of all we need to update raspbian\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nWait until the update is finished. The next thing is to get rid of all the unnecessary GUI content\n\nsudo apt-get purge libx11-6 libgtk-3-common xkb-data lxde-icon-theme raspberrypiartwork penguinspuzzle\n\nTIP If you make a typing mistake you can press the UP ARROW and edit your command\n\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nNext we must make our pi to have all times the same network address (static). For this we must use a text editor names nano to edit the file /etc/network/interfaces.\n\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\nWe replace all the content of the file:\n\nauto eth0 iface eth0 inet static address 192.168.1.24 netmask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.1.1\n\nWe do this when we are plugged into a wired network and we don’t use a wireless, else we leave wlan0 in place.\n\nTo write the content of the file to the SD we press Control-O [^O] and then ENTER. To exit nano [^X] (control and X simultaneously).\n\nIn the address you can put at the fourth number any number between 2 and 255 but I prefer to use the address it was automatically assigned.\n\nThe gateway is usually 192.168.1.1. In my case it is 192.168.1.2 because of the router I use.\n\nIn some cases might be 192.168.0.1 because the network address of the DHCP server (usually the router).\n\nThe gateway address is the address of your router which is connected to the internet.\n\nIf you change the address you better restart the pi.\n\nIf you want to have access from the internet, you should get an address from http://www.noip. org or any other provider. You'll also need to forward your external IP to your Pi's IP address on your LAN. It depends on your router. Usually there's NAT, or Virtual server or Port forward. Use port 80.\n\nIf you haven't yet changed the default password, do the following:\n\nsudo passwd\n\nNow it’s time to see our partion table\n\ncat /proc/partitions\n\nFor me, the disk is sda1. We need to instruct Pi to mount our Disk at the same position\n\nsudo mkdir /media/USBDisk\n\nBefore we can mount the drives, we need to create a directory to mount the drives to.\n\nsudo mount -t auto /dev/sda1 /media/USBDisk\n\n*Note that in LINUX words are case sensitive. USBDisk is not the same as usbdisk\n\nsudo mkdir /media/USBDisk/shares sudo mkdir /media/USBDisk/shares/downloading sudo mkdir /media/USBDisk/shares/completed sudo nano /etc/fstab\n\nWe add the /dev/sda1 line and save it NOW it’s time to install the torrent client, transmission,\n\nsudo apt-get install transmission-daemon\n\nNow to configure permissions:\n\nsudo usermod -a -G debian-transmission pi sudo chgrp debian-transmission /media/USBDisk/shares/downloading sudo chgrp debian-transmission /media/ USBDisk/shares/completed sudo chmod 770 /media/USBDisk/shares/downloading sudo chmod 777 /media/ USBDisk/shares/completed\n\nIf you want you can change the 770 to 777 to have full control on it, go ahead.\n\nReload the transmission\n\nsudo service transmission-daemon reload\n\nEdit transmission settings.json file\n\nsudo nano /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json\n\nThe content of the file is here. Marked are the lines we must edit\n\n{ \"alt-speed-down\": 50, \"alt-speed-enabled\": false, \"alt-speed-time-begin\": 540, \"alt-speed-time-day\": 127, \"alt-speed-time-enabled\": false, \"alt-speed-time-end\": 1020, \"alt-speed-up\": 50, \"bind-address-ipv4\": \"0.0.0.0\", \"bind-address-ipv6\": \"::\", \"blocklist-enabled\": false, \"blocklist-url\": \"http://www.example.com/blocklist\", \"cache-size-mb\": 4, \"dht-enabled\": false, \"download-dir\": \"/media/data/complete\", \"download-limit\": 100, \"download-limit-enabled\": 0, \"download-queue-enabled\": true, \"download-queue-size\": 5, \"encryption\": 1, \"idle-seeding-limit\": 30, \"idle-seeding-limit-enabled\": false, \"incomplete-dir\": \"/media/data/incomplete\", \"incomplete-dir-enabled\": true, \"lpd-enabled\": false, \"max-peers-global\": 200, \"message-level\": 2, \"peer-congestion-algorithm\": \"\", \"peer-limit-global\": 91, \"peer-limit-per-torrent\": 150, \"peer-port\": 51413, \"peer-port-random-high\": 65535, \"peer-port-random-low\": 49152, \"peer-port-random-on-start\": false, \"peer-socket-tos\": \"default\", \"pex-enabled\": false, \"port-forwarding-enabled\": true, \"preallocation\": 1, \"prefetch-enabled\": 1, \"queue-stalled-enabled\": true, \"queue-stalled-minutes\": 30, \"ratio-limit\": 2, \"ratio-limit-enabled\": false, \"rename-partial-files\": true, \"rpc-authentication-required\": true, \"rpc-bind-address\": \"0.0.0.0\", \"rpc-enabled\": true, \"rpc-password\": \"{2dc2c41724aab07ccc301e97f56360cb35f8ba1fGVVrdHDX\", \"rpc-port\": 9091, \"rpc-url\": \"/transmission/\", \"rpc-username\": \"transmission\", \"rpc-whitelist\": \"*.*.*.*\", \"rpc-whitelist-enabled\": false, \"scrape-paused-torrents-enabled\": true, \"script-torrent-done-enabled\": false, \"script-torrent-done-filename\": \"\", \"seed-queue-enabled\": false, \"seed-queue-size\": 10, \"speed-limit-down\": 250, \"speed-limit-down-enabled\": true, \"speed-limit-up\": 0, \"speed-limit-up-enabled\": true, \"start-added-torrents\": true, \"trash-original-torrent-files\": false, \"umask\": 18, \"upload-limit\": 100, \"upload-limit-enabled\": 0, \"upload-slots-per-torrent\": 14, \"utp-enabled\": true } \"download-dir\": \"/media/data/complete\", Becomes \"download-dir\": \"/media/USBDisk/shares/completed\", \"incomplete-dir\": \"/media/data/incomplete\", \"incomplete-dir\": \"/media/USBDisk/shares/downloading\", \"rpc-username\": \"transmission\", \"rpc-username\": \"myname\",\n\nI changed the username because it’s easier to remember. You are not obliged to do that if you don’t want to. Cross your fingers and open your browser.\n\nnow install SAMBA\n\nsudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin\n\nOpen the configuration file\n\nsudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf\n\nAt the end of the file add the following lines\n\n[Torrentbox] comment = Public Shares path = /media/USBDisk/shares/completed writeable = Yes only guest = Yes create mask = 0777 directory mask = 0777 browseable = Yes public = yes\n\nRestart SAMBA\n\nsudo service samba restart\n\nTHAT’S IT YOU CAN NOW ACCESS YOUR FILES FROM WINDOWS EXPLORER\n\nIf you want to access transmission from your android phone you can install Remote Transmission. Hope I helped\n\nADDED BONUS\n\nIf you want to have access to your files from outside you have to install an ftp server. This is how we can do it. Install the ftp program\n\nsudo apt-get install vsftpd\n\nUncomment (that means delete the # before) the following lines\n\nlocal_enable=YES write_enable=YES\n\nRestart the service and you are done"
