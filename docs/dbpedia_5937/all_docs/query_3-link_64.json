        "text": "@richud I've been using your genie firmware with ADSL2+ Annex M on my 3700v1 here in Adelaide, Australia and it works well. Thank you for your efforts.\n\nLast week I upgraded my internet service to 'fibre to the home' and hope to use the 3700v1 WAN port fed from the fibre optic cable modem. However,\n\nI am unable to get the WAN port working as a WAN port. Has anyone used the current firmware in this mode? (maybe I'm doing something wrong). The settings I tried kept jumping back each time I clicked 'apply'.\n\n@w3wilkes thanks for your interest. No, I want to use the WAN port as it was originally intended, ie as a WAN port to access the internet rather than the embedded ADSL modem. My new fibre optic cable modem provides access to the internet and I want this to come into the WAN port of the 3700v1 and allow it to provide access to the LAN and WLAN.\n\nSo I am trying to simply disable ADSL and use RJ45 WAN port instead. The separate cable modem (ISP owned and configured device) provides a static IPv4 address on the internet to the WAN port of any router. I have it working on a Netgear DEVG2020 (also Genie interface) via the WAN (RJ45) port with ADSL disabled, However, I would like to have access to all the other goodies that Richud provides:)\n\nSo in Advanced Setup 2 the WAN to LAN is unchecked which appears to be default and appropriate for my purpose. And similarly I want it to use the WAN port with ethernet RJ45 (ie not DSL).\n\n@richud\n\nthe error:\n\n===>brcm_board_init: GPIO->GPIOMode=0x1f0003\n\nSerial: BCM63XX driver $Revision: 3.00 $\n\nttyS0 at MMIO 0xb0000100 (irq = 10) is a BCM63XX\n\nttyS1 at MMIO 0xb0000120 (irq = 11) is a BCM63XX\n\nbcmxtmrt: Broadcom BCM6368B2 ATM/PTM Network Device v0.3 Dec 4 2015 11:54:54\n\nnetem: version 1.2\n\nu32 classifier\n\nTCP cubic registered\n\nNET: Registered protocol family 1\n\nNET: Registered protocol family 10\n\n6WIND/LSIIT IPv6 multicast forwarding 0.1 plus PIM-SM/SSM with *BSD API\n\nlo: Disabled Privacy Extensions\n\nIPv6 over IPv4 tunneling driver\n\nsit0: Disabled Privacy Extensions\n\nNET: Registered protocol family 17\n\nInitializing MCPD Module\n\n802.1Q VLAN Support v1.8 Ben Greear <greearb@candelatech.com>\n\nAll bugs added by David S.

Some further research leads me to believe that this behaviour is appropriate for PPPoE (requiring username & password). However, my service is 'IPoE' or 'Dynamic IP' which does not require username or password. My other router that connects correctly does so without username or password... it is a NETGEAR DEVG2020 and I selected 'WAN Uplink Mode'...it then just accepts an internet IPv4 WAN address from the fibre cable modem (which presumably is already authenticating/logging in to the provider).\n\nSo it is possible the 3700v1 firmwares never supported this so called 'WAN Uplink Mode'....\n\n@stick50jr wrote:\n\n@richud I tried letting the 3700v1 autodetect the WAN connection and it did partially... it prompted for a username & password and then refused any attempt to continue.

Might be worth talking to your ISP and asking them about it and see if this is the case and provide them with the MAC Address of the new router..\n\nThe other option might be to see if the WAN MAC Address on the DGND3700 router could be spoofed into thinking it was the MAC Address of your other routers WAN port.\n\nOther alternative might be to see if the router that is connected currently can operate in some sort of \"Bridged\" mode so it manages all the authentication side of things and then you can plug in the DGND3700 in behind it..\n\nCheers,\n\nJediNite\n\n@richud I've succeeded in setting up WAN with IPoE!!! It didn't show this option until I had done a factory reset.\n\nI selected 'must use ethernet WAN' and WAN2 with IPoE before WAN cable was connected. I then rebooted, then connected the cable again and rebooted. It seems a bit odd to have to follow this approach:) Curiously, the WAN2 option is not shown once a cable is connected to the WAN port and even when this configuration is working it shows a blank in place of 'WAN2'. On the Internet status page and elsewhere, there is no indication of the actual WAN IP... just 0.0.0.0 Anyhow, it is now working... thankyou for your efforts.\n\nHi! I'm using the last version of the genie firmware (2015-12-4) and everything seems working fine except for the remote management. I can't access the control page of the router remotely, but for instance I can access the control page of the transmission daemon.\n\nI'm using the remote management togheter with dynamic dns (noip). Basically if I type mynoip.ddns.net it doesn't work, not even if I type mynoip.ddns.net:8080 and not even if I type the ip shown in the remote management page https://*.*.*.*:8080. But if I type mynoip:ddns.net:9091 I can access the control page for the built-in transmission client. Of course I turned on the remote management and set \"everyone\" as allowed machines, the port is 8080.\n\nWhat should I do according to you?\n\nThank you very much!\n\nHi all,\n\nI am wondering what level of VLAN support is available on the router with the latest firmware ? My kids are chocking up a lot of Internet usage and want to try and monitor this a bit better. My plan is to have the wireless networks and one ethernet port on one vlan and this connected to a firewall / secondary router with better logging and monitoring (pfSense perhaps on a VM). The remaining interfaces can then all be allocated to the remaining vlan. It might also be possible to acheive something like this with multiple Bridge interfaces perhaps depedning on if the linux kernel is set up not auto-route the interfaces...\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions appreciated!!!\n\nCheers,\n\nJediNite"
