During the 1880s there were grandparents and parents of the present generation of ‘Mt Moritz Bajans’ living on estates such as Beauséjour and Grand Mal in the flat coastal and valley areas surrounding Mt Moritz, but a move to the cooler hillside estate of Mt Moritz was evidently made (purportedly, in part an attempt to escape mosquitoes – carriers of malaria and dengue fever, which resulted in numerous deaths – that were prevalent in the low laying areas) when leasehold land became available there.\n\nThe oldest inhabitant of Mt Moritz, who was ninety-eight in 1973 (identified as ‘George’ Edward Lawrence Greaves II by N.S.D), had followed just this pattern. His family had come to Grenada in 1887 and lived free on the Beauséjour estate before moving to Grand Mal, and then to Mt Moritz. By 1940 there were forty-three tenant families, almost all Barbadian in origin, living on the 121-acer Mt Moritz estate and cultivating plots of land, or in some cases several plots, most of which were no larger than 1½ acres.

PRICE\n\nPoor white people do not belong in a colonial world of\n\nwhite masters and coloured labourers. They not only\n\nstand out as anomalies, but are likely to be\n\nhard-pressed for survival in a society that has no\n\nniche for them, that assumes they will not exist. The\n\npoor whites on the other islands of the Lesser\n\nAntilles, described by Grenfell Price,1 are mostly\n\nliving in distinct settlements with some degree of\n\neconomic self-sufficiency — but Barbados offers no\n\nsuch opportunities. It is not surprising, then that\n\nthe once numerous Redlegs have virtually disappeared\n\nas a group on Barbados.\n\nThe term “Redleg” on Barbados probably refers to the\n\nsunburn picked up by light-skinned people in sunny\n\nlatitudes. The name originally drew my attention to\n\nthe group because of the fact that it is used in South\n\nCarolina occasionally to refer to a mixed-blood group\n\n(and there probably implies Indian blood). Since South\n\nCarolina was settled by Barbadians, I had thought of\n\nthe possibility that the two Redleg groups, each an\n\nanomalous proletariat in a biracial society, might be\n\nrelated. I found no concrete evidence for this, but\n\nthink it possible that the name in the two places had\n\na common origin. It is said to have been used in\n\nScotland to describe the kilted highlanders, but I\n\nhave obtained no knowledge of when it was first used\n\nin either Barbados or South Carolina. The Barbados\n\nRedlegs have also been termed Redshanks and Scotland\n\nJohnnies (some of them reside in the island’s hilly\n\nScotland District).\n\nThe Redlegs are survivors of the heavy white\n\nimmigration into Barbados during the seventeenth\n\ncentury. Sugar was introduced commercially by the\n\nearly 1640’s and proved so profitable that it quickly\n\nsurpassed all other crops. Population grew rapidly\n\nwith the recruiting of labour in Britain and Ireland,\n\nand the importing of African slaves. Excerpts from a\n\njournal of 1654 illustrate the prevalent themes of the\n\nday: “this Iland is the Dunghill whereon England doth\n\ncast forth its rubidg . . . manured the best of any\n\nIland in the Inges . . . . But it maintains more souls\n\nthan any piese of land of the bigness in the wordell”.\n\n2 Indentured servants came in number; if they survived\n\nthe merciless treatment. they might receive a few\n\nacres for their own at the expiration of the contract.\n\nSometimes the recruiting was forceful: men were\n\nshanghaied or, in the language specific to the day and\n\nplace, “barbadoed.” Political prisoners were sent to\n\nBarbados, especially during the Civil War and after\n\nthe Bloody Assizes of 1685. 3 Prison…\n\n[poor photocopy last line on page missing].\n\nDuring the seventeenth century many of the farm units\n\nwere small, and the Europeans outnumbered the slaves,\n\nbut the heyday of the small proprietor died with the\n\nflush of sugar crops on the virgin soils. Before 1700\n\nthe whites became so alarmed at the increasing\n\npreponderance of negro slaves in the face of white\n\nemigration that legal measures were taken to maintain\n\na yeomanry on the island. Every sugar estate was\n\nrequired to maintain a footman for every 20 acres and\n\na horseman for every 40 acres (the ratio seems to have\n\nvaried from time to time).4 The militiamen thus\n\nprescribed were each assigned a house and a small plot\n\nof land on the estate. The forces saw little activity\n\nin maintaining order on Barbados, but were several\n\ntimes called on to aid in attacks on the other\n\ncolonies. As military activity waned, so did the\n\nresponsibility of the militia. Assured of a minimum\n\nliving from their two acres and with little\n\nopportunity to better their positions, the militiamen\n\nand their families developed into an ambitionless\n\ngroup. So they were almost universally described by\n\ntravellers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,\n\nwho also reveal some of the feelings that kept the\n\nRedlegs a people apart.\n\nGeorge Washington, who visited the island in 1751\n\nwrote: “Every Gentn. is oblig’d to keep a white person\n\nfor ten Acres capable of acting in the Militia and\n\nconsequently those persons so kept cant but (be) very\n\npoor.” 5\n\nGeorge Pinekard in 1806 referred to a numerous class\n\nof inhabitants between the great planters and the\n\npeople of colour, people who had lived on the island\n\nso long they regarded it as their native abode, not\n\nlooking to England, he noted with surprise, as another\n\nand better home. They “obtain a scanty livelihood by\n\ncultivating a small patch of earth, and breeding up\n\npoultry, or what they term stock for the market.” 6\n\nH. N. Coleridge in 1834 reported on this special class\n\nof people who existed ” . . . . in consequence of the\n\nlarge white population” and who had “an indefeasible\n\ninterest for their lives in a house and garden . . . .\n\nThey owe no fealty to the landlord, make him no\n\nacknowledgement, and entertain no kind of gratitude\n\ntowards him . . . . They will walk half over the\n\nisland to demand alms, or depend for their subsistance\n\non the charity of slaves . . . . Yet they are as proud\n\nas Lucifer himself, and in virtue of their freckled\n\nditchwater faces consider themselves on a level with\n\nevery gentleman in the island.”‘\n\nSir Andrew Halliday noted in 1834 that a remnant of\n\nthe “descendants of the first white labourers” still\n\nexisted and “were reputed to be the most indolent,\n\nignorant, and impudent race of beggars that were ever\n\ntolerated in any community.”8\n\nEmancipation of slaves in 1834 brought a quick\n\ntermination to the status of the militia people, which\n\nhad lasted for a century………\n\n[poor photocopy – last line on page missing]\n\nmaintain law and order. The sugar estates employed\n\nthe freedmen, who on Barbados had no alternative; in\n\nother colonies the freedmen often took to the bush or\n\nstruck out on their own land but all the useable land\n\nin Barbados was already owned and in cultivation.\n\n_About 2,000 whites from the militia class are\n\nestimated to have been put off the estates. 9 These\n\npeople did not take to the only evident type of\n\nemployment – working with negroes in labor gangs. Many\n\ntook up residence in the villages of the poorer and\n\nmore remote windward side of the island, eked out\n\nlivings from various sorts of odd jobs, and acquired\n\nreputations as professional\n\npaupers. 10 Between 1859 and 1879 the government took\n\nan interest in the plight of the Redlegs and a number\n\nof reports were prepared concerning them. A report of\n\nthe Poor Relief Commission stated: “The white paupers\n\nas a rule have larger pensions than the black and\n\ncolored-there being greater destitution-and they\n\nsometimes though able to work are pensioned, because\n\nthey say they cannot find employment . . . they\n\nconsider themselves above work and almost equal to\n\ntheir employer.”11 An independent observer of the same\n\nperiod said, “The very poorest and most miserable\n\npeople in the whole island are whites.” 12\n\nThe physical condition of the Redlegs was as pathetic\n\nas their economic condition. John Davy commented that\n\nthe poor whites resembled more albinos, than\n\nEnglishmen when exposed to the tropical sun.13 He\n\ndescribed them as sickly white or light red in color,\n\nand noted marks of feebleness. During the First World\n\nWar the Rockefeller Foundation sponsored a hookworm\n\nsurvey of Barbados, which revealed a very high rate of\n\ninfection in the poor windward parishes; the disease\n\nwas reported especially noticeable among the poor\n\nwhites who showed its effects in profound anemic\n\nemaciation, and faulty growth. 14\n\nA detailed record survives of one private attempt to\n\nhelp the Redlegs.15 A resident of St. Philip, the\n\nsoutheastern parish, died in 1857, leaving his\n\nresidence and estate for the purpose of providing a\n\nschool for the children of poor whites people living\n\nin that parish Up to 36 children were to be provided\n\nwith instruction, books, and two suits of clothing per\n\nyear. The school operated off and on over the years,\n\nbut finally was closed in 1949 because there were\n\nvirtual no poor whites left in St. Philip. The funds\n\navailable for the school\n\nhave been used to provide scholarships for worthy\n\nchildren of both races.\n\nNow the Redlegs have all but disappeared.\n\nOpportunities In the city of Bridgetown (population\n\n80,000) have undoubtedly j t been the biggest cause\n\ndrawing them away from the rural areas\n\n[poor photocopy – last line of page missing]\n\nfinancial success and recognition. Bridgetown has\n\nmany poor whites today, and it is most likely that\n\nthey derive from the old Redlegs class. Only a hundred\n\nor two Redlegs survive in the negro villages of the\n\nwindward parishes. They may be seen walking along the\n\nroads or working on highway crews, living in much the\n\nsame fashion as the colored villagers. Some have\n\nintermarried, but most of the survivors maintain a\n\nracial pride and a degree of aloofness from the\n\nnegroes with whom they live in such close proximity\n\nand association.\n\nThe account of the Redlegs would end with their\n\nvirtual disappearance on Barbados had not the\n\nnineteenth century efforts to resettle them borne some\n\nfruit. After investigation of their condition the\n\nGovernor in 1859 made arrangements for moving several\n\nhundred of them to another island, but the plan failed\n\nwhen the House of Assembly refused to appropriate the\n\nmoney to transport them. A few years later, however,\n\none of the Parish Rectors arranged with an estate\n\nproprietor on St. Vincent to transport a number of the\n\nRedlegs to that island. Other families followed the\n\ngood reports of the first, apparently on their own, so\n\nthat, by the late 1870s three or four hundred were\n\nsettled in the Dorsetshire Hill district of St.\n\nVincent.16 At that time they were reported as leasing\n\nlots of an acre, clearing the forest, burning\n\ncharcoal, cultivating the land until the fertility was\n\nexhausted, then moving to new pots. Apparently the\n\nimpermanent nature of this farming did not persist,\n\nfor Dorsetshire Hill is now a compact, densely\n\npopulated, and in intensively farmed settlement of\n\nprobably 300 whites of Barbadian origin. Just beyond\n\nthe outskirts of Kingstown on the southern end of the\n\nisland, the Dorsetshire Hill community occupies a\n\ntract of\n\nsteep ridges covered with a deep, friable soil. The\n\nland is as neatly farmed in food crops and pastures as\n\nany land anywhere. Houses are small, but far above\n\nWest Indian standards in both size and neatness. The\n\ncommunity has maintained its separateness with very\n\nlittle intermarriage. Most of its residents have one\n\nof half a dozen common surnames-Davis, Gibson,\n\nHinkson, Marshall, Medford, Bradshaw. The community\n\nhas its own school and an Anglican Church (Catholicism\n\nis predominant on St. Vincent). For many years there\n\nseems to have been no room for growth; emigration has\n\ntaken colonists in some number to the United States\n\nand Canada.\n\nTwo other colonies of Redlegs in the Windward Islands\n\nhave also survived more distinctly than the parent\n\ngroup on Barbados, but the Grenada and Bequia\n\nsettlements have not maintained their distinctness so\n\nclearly as the Dorsetshire Hill community. None of\n\nthese three colonies shows the degraded, depressed,\n\nand…\n\n[poor photocopy – last line of page missing]\n\nhad to form discrete settlements of their own on the\n\nless densely settled islands.\n\nThe Bequia colony was considered a failure, 17 but,\n\nactually a number of families, perhaps a hundred\n\npeople altogether, are still living on Pleasant Hill\n\nabove Port Elizabeth. This hill land on Bequia is both\n\ndry and steep for the best farming, but a variety of\n\nfood crops is being grown on terraced fields. The\n\nshipping business is probably of more importance to\n\nthe colony. Some of the men operate inter-island\n\nschooners, and most of the families share in 4the\n\nownership of the vessels through family syndicates.\n\nFamily names are Gooding, Davis, and King.\n\nConsiderable emigration to North America has occurred\n\nhere also.\n\nThe Mt. Moritz settlement in Grenada, in the hills\n\noverlooking the coast two or three miles north of St.\n\nGeorge’s, has another group of white Barbadians:\n\nThough they have begun to intermarry with the negroes,\n\nthe community probably has most of the unmixed whites\n\nto be found on the island. The leading names in the\n\ncommunity are Edwards, Dowding, Harris, Graves, and\n\nMedford.\n\nThese families have probably been on Grenada since the\n\n-1870’s though no present member of the colony seems\n\nable to offer a specific account of its origin.\n\nThey have also been culturally distinct from the\n\nGrenadians. The negroes used to recognize them as a\n\npeculiar group to be viewed with curiosity or fear.\n\nThe speech of the Mt. Moritz people is easy for an\n\nAmerican to understand (true of most Barbadians,\n\nalso), whereas the speech of the negro Grenadians is\n\noften not intelligible. The Barbadians have acquired a\n\nreputation as industrious growers of vegetables,\n\nwhereas the rest of the island produces tree crops\n\n(cacao, nutmeg-curiously considered as a lazy type of\n\nfarming) or sugar. The Mt. Moritz whites are\n\nparticularly proud of their method of hillside\n\ncultivation wherein their gardens are hoed up into\n\nrows of small basins to prevent soil erosion; these\n\nplots have the aspect of a fine-textured version of\n\nthe Barbados sugar cane hole pattern, which is most\n\nprobably their prototype.\n\nMany. Mt. Moritz people now have jobs in St. George’s.\n\nThe community probably includes 200 unmixed whites.\n\nIts school in 1956 had an enrollment of 154, of whom\n\nabout a third appeared to be white. The people are\n\nstill recognized on Grenada as Barbadians and even\n\nnegroes who live in the community are likely to be\n\ncalled “Bajans”.\n\nAmong the three colonies described and the original\n\ngroup on Barbados, a large number of surnames are\n\nconsidered characteristic of Redleg families. Each of\n\nthe windward parishes on ‘Barbados seems to have its\n\nown names. A few of the names have\n\n[poor photocopy – last line of page missing]\n\nThe Redlegs are sometimes said to have sprung entirely\n\nfrom the deportations following the Monmouth Rebellion\n\nof 1685,but actually the Redleg names do not show up\n\non Hotten’s lists of deportees. (See footnote 3.) It\n\nis evident t h a t the – Redlegs have sprung more\n\nbroadly from the entire British immigration into\n\nBarbados during the seventeenth century, and that they\n\ndeveloped as a distinct group because of the narrow\n\n(and here legally provided) opportunities in a\n\nstratified society.

They began to leave Barbados in the 1870s for Dorsetshire Hill, St Vincent and then Mt. Moritz, Grenada.\n\nThe Governor in 1859 made arrangements for moving several hundred of them to another island, but the plan failed. A few years later, one of the Parish Rectors arranged with an estate proprietor on St. Vincent to transport a number of the Redlegs to that island. Other families followed the good reports of the first so that, by the late 1870s three or four hundred were settled in the Dorsetshire Hill district of St. Vincent. Most of its residents have one of half a dozen common surnames-Davis, Gibson,Hinkson, Marshall, Medford, Bradshaw.\n\nWell before black slaves were transported from Africa, work on the sugar plantations of Barbados was carried out by indentured servants brought from Ireland, Scotland and England. They became known as Redlegs, and their descendants can still be found.\n\nProvided by Ric Greaves, St. Vincent descendant who has his own page, “Caribbean Families”.\n\nThree major spurs caused Scots to be banished to the island:\n\n1. Cromwell’s victory between 1648 and 1651;\n\n2. the Covenanter Risings in the second half of the 17th century and the\n\n3. Jacobite rebellions of 1715 and 1745.\n\nThere were also voluntary immigrants, as throughout the colonial period a steady trickle of Scots sought to inhabit Barbados because of the various opportunities offered by the land.\n\nBy 1650 there were 44,000 English settlers throughout the West Indies. During 1652 to July 1660 Daniel Searle is made acting governor. In August 1654 the protector Monck ordered Searle to take measures to prohibit the departure of any Scots from the island. In 1655 some 12,000 ‘felons, vagrants’ and prisoners of wars were taken to Barbados as indentured slaves, certainly several thousand of these were Irish and Scottish rebel royalist prisoners, many of the others were those ‘spirited away’. By 1680 on Barbados, prior to the Scottish rebellions, there were some 175 significant English planter families owning an average of 267 acres of land each (an unprecedented large amount of land for such tiny islands).\n\nScottish Rebels and the Jacobite Risings\n\nThe Jacobite caused a series of uprisings, rebellions, and wars in Great Britain and Ireland occurring between 1688 and 1746. These uprisings were an aim to returning James VII of Scotland and II of England.At the street fighting of the Battle of Dunkeld on 21 August 1689, the Jacobite Highlanders were decisively defeated by the Cameronians who were led by George Munro, 1st of Auchinbowie.By 1700, there were 15,000 free whites on Barbados.The major uprisings were called the Jacobite Rebellions by the ruling governments, the first being in 1715 and the second in 1745.One Scottish uprising which culminated in the fatal route and disperson of the followers of Prince Charles Edward Stuart, “the Pretender” to the throne of Great Britain at the Battle of Culloden on 16 April 1746.At this battle the British army, under the command of the Duke of Cumberland, killed 1000 of the 5000 Scottish troops in less than an hour and pursued the fleeing rebels, persecuting and prosecuting them and members of their families.Confined at Chester and Carlisle, the scottish rebels became a threat to the English crown. On 25 September 1746, a signed agreement with the English Treasury was made to transport these prisoners to the plantations (Caribbean and American Colonies) at the rate of 5 pounds per head. Nearly 200 prisoners were transported to the Colonies. These prisoners were bound out as apprentices (slaves) to various plantation owners in which the Captains of the ships were paid handsomely in tobacco.Donald McDonald, a 56 year old farmer (Clatil, Eigg) from Uist and a Jocobite sergeant in Clanranald’s regiment was made prisioner and put on a ship at Tibury and transported to Barbados by Samuel Smith on 31 March 1747. He was accompanied by Donald Gunn (a 40 year old husbandman of Dunbeath, Caithness) also a Jocobite but of the Cromarty’s regiment.\n\nEnglish Rebels\n\nMost of our family names are actually English from the Monmouth rebellion of 1685 involved the a group of Protestants who ended up in Somerset (the west-country of England). Between 11 June 1685, when the Duke of Monmouth landed at Lyme in Dorset (from Holland) with a party of just over eighty men, and 6 July, when his army (estimated at between 3200 and 7000) was defeated at Sedgemoor, a significant proportion of the population of West Dorset, East Devon and Somerset rose up in arms against the Government of James II. The level of support for the cause resulted in the government’s savage treatment of the rebels, and also was the reason why so many rebels were able to disappear into a countryside ready to shelter them.It is important to note that the Dowden’s and Medford came much, much later and have nothing to do with the rebels.\n\nHere is a small selection of names and where they’re from:-\n\nJohn Chilcott (Tiverton)\n\nJohn Edwards (Axminster)\n\nWilliam Harris (Membury)\n\nJohn Knowles (Colyton)\n\nPercival Knowles (Colyton)\n\nWilliam Martin (Honiton)\n\nWilliam Poole (From Exeter)\n\nEdward Searle alias Jackson (Sidbury)\n\nGeorge Searle (Axminster)\n\nJohn Searle (Chardstock)\n\nJohn Searle (Coombe Raleigh)\n\nThomas Searle (Sidbury)\n\nWilliam Searle (Whitford)\n\nJohn Williams (Axminster)\n\nJohn Sen.

Williams (Axminster)\n\nRobert Williams (Axminster)\n\nWilliam Williams (Axminster)\n\nOn Grand Mal and it’s name:\n\nby Anthropologist and Local historian John Angus Martin, director of the National Museum in St. George’s, Grenada.\n\nGrand Mal dates to the at least 1658 as it is mentioned in an early French manuscript. It claims that the name was given to he area because a large male (Masle) turtle was captured there. The 1667 map of Grenada show the name as Grand Masle.\n\n————————————————————————————\n\nProvided by Ric Greaves\n\nIt is important to note that the Dowden’s and Medford came much, much later and have nothing to do with the rebels.

Moritz was named after a French man, Harding Moritz. He lived in Mt. Moritz Estate which was a Cocoa Plantation. Harding Moritz who died approximately 1819. He lived in Mt. Moritz Estate which was a Cocoa Plantation and left the estate to daughters Eliza and Catherine. Note: Eliza married Louis Rouget of the lineage Rouget, LaBarrie-Original French ownders.\n\nWe know that William Stewart was the proprietor of Mt. Moritz from Gavin Bell’s List of Proprietors for 1801. William Stewart was also the Proprietor for Diamond Estate in St. Mark’s which fell into the hands of our Louis (Gun-not related to Gun Munro) Munro. Louis Gun Munro married Charlotte Bell of the Bell family who owned Penang Estate where the first nutmeg seeds were said to have been planted. There is also a quote saying that the first commercial planters of the nutmeg during the early 1800s was of Lessey and Munro in Penang Estate. Was this part of Louis Gun and his wife or Louis’ father, George Munro?\n\nWe also know that Mt. Moritz was originally named Mt. Melville, another top name in Grenada during the time period of the 1700s.\n\nTo expand on the history of Mt. Moritz, I will put my notes here. This is a work in progress. Anyone who can add to this information is welcome.\n\n1870 Barbados to Grenada\n\nScots, Irish and Western English who were descendants of the Redlegs of Barbados through Oliver Cromwell, came to Mt. Moritz in the 1870s and upwards, with news of work at the Mt. Moritz Cocoa Plantation. At first they settled nearby at the low lying, flat areas of Grand Mal and Beausejour. With mosquitos causing malaria and Denghi which lead to many deaths and with land becoming available in Mt. Moritz, they moved to the cooler hillside of Mt. Moritz thus expanding it past the Estate/Cocoa Plantation.Others came to Mt. Moritz as well, from different parts of Grenada and South America.\n\nEarly 1900s Mt. Moritz, Grenada to Panama Canal and New York\n\nBy the early 1900s, some of the Mt. Moritz men went to work on the Panama Canal and to New York where they were building the tunnels under the Hudson and East River for the railroad. Most made it back and used that money to buy more land. For the most part, the land has been handed down and kept in the family but some have sold off more recently to outsiders. Remaining mainly a white community from the early to middle part of the 20th century, many remaining descendants today are mixed race with others from around the island, settling in Mt. Moritz as well. But this community would be the descendants of the original Scots, Irish and English that left Barbados, also settling in Dorcestshire Hill, St. Vincent.\n\nSome of these men who worked on the Panama Canal came back while others that and passed through New York, stayed. They were able to sponsor a number of family members to the United States. Some went by ship to Ellis Island.\n\nEarly 1900s Migration from Grenada to New York, Great Britain, Canada and Australia primarily.\n\nDuring the 1950s and upwards, many emigrated to New York, other areas in the United States, Canada, England, Australia and even South America. So, now we have family ALL over the world! And this is how we keep in touch and tell anecdotes of a place they all call, “Home”.\n\n———————————————————————————–"
