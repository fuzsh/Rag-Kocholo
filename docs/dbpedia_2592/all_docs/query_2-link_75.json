        "text": "CHARLES WORTHINGTON MORITZ personifies the conservative businessman. He lives in Darien, Conn., he's 48 years old, and he has three children. He plays golf and reads spy novels. His neatly trimmed hair is gray; his suit, pinstriped; and his reading glasses, half frames that sit on the edge of his nose.\n\nIn other words, he is precisely what one would expect of the soon-to-be chairman and chief executive of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. The hugely profitable New York-based company is on a steady course and hardly in need of a high-flyer at the controls. It is also the epitome of financial conservatism, which is perhaps appropriate, given that the 143- year-old company made its name - and still makes much of its money - by judging the financial health of some six million other companies.\n\nThe ascension of ''Charlie'' Moritz (accent on the first syllable) to Dun & Bradstreet's top spot is set for Jan. 1, when Harrington ''Duke'' Drake, 65, retires. Mr. Drake, who oversaw a decade of tremendous growth at Dun & Bradstreet, is an unassuming but hands-on manager. Mr. Moritz, although somewhat smoother, is cut from the same mold, a fact that has fostered optimism on Wall Street that the company will continue to, in effect, mint money.\n\n''He's another low-key guy,'' R. Joseph Fuchs, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company, said of Mr. Moritz. ''But he has a clear and precise vision of what the company is about. His mission is to keep and build Dun & Bradstreet as the premier information and data base publisher.''\n\n''He's a sort of professional D. & B. manager,'' agreed Edward J. Atorino, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''They have a whole cadre of very professional managers. They're not highly visible or charismatic. They could work for the phone company.''\n\nIn fact, both Dun & Bradstreet and the American Telephone & Telegraph Company have been going through cultural changes that make low-profile managers, at least in marketing, less effective. Both companies had for years made their profits by peddling existing products to new customers. Now both have charged their staffs with finding out what products customers might want, and developing products to meet those needs.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
