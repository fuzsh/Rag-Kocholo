        "text": "Something to keep in mind, in a lot of cultures the first name is actually the surname.\n\nSo when you say \"first name\" you are actually confusing a whole range of cultures surnames and given names. Which is ironic given the question.\n\nIt's best just to be direct. \"Please call me Bob\" is better than \"Bob is my first name\". A direction is clearer than a statement. It doesn't make any assumptions about the motivations of the person using your surname. They may have come from a culture where using the surname is a sign of respect, so your \"correction\" may be giving them information they already know.\n\nIt is somewhat typical to use capital letters for your surname.\n\nAs this answer indicates, you should be signing things with your preferred name, and your full name and position should appear in a much less prominent font. If an inordinate number of people are making mistakes regarding this, the distinction between your preferred name and email signature is not enough.\n\nEDIT:\n\nQuite a few people have commented about their own cultures, and it's even more complicated than I thought.\n\nIndeed, thinking about my answer, I've kinda answered a different question. There is a bit of a distinction between \"first name\" and \"name you wish to be called\". I think it usually don't matter what people understand the given name is, or what the surname is. The main thing is people are addressed how they wish to be addressed.\n\nA few examples:\n\nTitle only: Doctor\n\nGiven name: John\n\nTitle and surname: Doctor Doe\n\nSurname: Doe\n\nNickname: Johnnie\n\nMiddle name: Jack\n\nIn France it is almost the norm to use Firstname LASTNAME.\n\nWhile initially this looks weird, it helped numerous Jean MARC or Paul MARTIN to convey what is what.\n\nLooking at it from an international perspective, it usually works. We still get cases where both are mixed, especially in the case where Firstname is a common last name in the other country. Extra points when LASTNAME is a common first name. (I have a coworker who is in that unfortunate case).\n\nThis has the added value to allow the order LASTNAME Firstname, still being explicit on which is which.\n\nUsually, I use polite and subtle ways to correct people, e.g. using PS\n\nWhen someone gets a name or other important fact (job title, etc) about you wrong, the most effective way to correct it is head-on, quickly and to the point. It's not really the time for subtlety or passiveness. Assertively correct the fact, before moving on with the conversation.\n\nSo in written format, a PS is definitely not the place to put it - as you've found, it's more likely to be ignored or just not seen as that important.\n\nYou could combine it with your own greeting in the first line:\n\nHi Surname,\n\nWhat's the latest on...\n\nThanks, Jane\n\nHi Jane, Lema here (Surname is my surname!)\n\nThe status is...\n\nThanks, Prof Lema H. Surname*\n\n*What? well..\n\nmaybe by highlighting it using a specific notation\n\nYes, one possibility here is people simply scan reading emails just aren't parsing your name correctly - hooking onto the first word that pattern matches as a first name and using that.\n\nA pragmatic suggestion: a simple format change might help with this. Perhaps use a title, and/or a middle name or initial if you have one. Also, don't just update your email signature but the name field of your emails too, if you can.\n\nLema Surname Vs Prof Lema H. Surname - How much likelier is it that someone parses out Surname as your first name from scan reading the 1st Vs the 2nd?\n\nCheck what the normal form of address is in those students' academic environments.\n\nIn multiple academic contexts that I've been involved in, it has been perfectly normal that ALL persons within a particular group are routinely addressed by their surname with no honorifics.\n\nSimilar to how academic citations are often written e.g. [Jones et al.], or the way that wikipedia articles routinely discuss their subject using only the surname, but used for everyday address within the academic context.\n\nIt's possible that what you are perceiving as them getting your first and last names mixed up is simply using the normal form of address for that environment.\n\nIf people who are accustomed to that form of address are using it with you, the insistence on using your first name may come across as unusual, and perhaps overly-familiar.\n\nOn the other hand, if they're normally on first name terms with everyone else in a similar position to you, it's more likely a mistake that needs correcting...\n\nJust sign your emails the way you want to be addressed, in your case sign them with your first name. People who need your family name will be able to find it in your email address anyway.\n\nAlso, avoid devoting too much attention to that. Some people will always get it wrong and you can't do anything about it.\n\nI work with people from different cultures, with names I hear for the first time in my life. To avoid rubbing someone the wrong way I just check how they signed their email to pinpoint how they want to be addressed.\n\nI know a guy whose first name is much more common as a surname and his surname is much more common as a first name. This leads to the same sort of confusion. When we're on an email chain with someone that uses the wrong name, the rest of us start adding a salutation line to the top of our messages. Nothing fancy, just an explicit reference to the person we're addressing:\n\n[recipient's first name],\n\nI think you forgot to attach the file to your previous email.\n\nMy office is not usually that formal, but it's a simple enough addition that it doesn't seem awkward or out of place. It lets the reader know not only the name that person goes by, but also that it's socially acceptable to use that name (as opposed to a more formal address). There's also a slight peer-pressure aspect to it as well, since it feels awkward to refer to someone by a different name than everyone else is using. If you have multiple people with the same first name, use their first name and last initial instead of the complete last name.\n\nThis \"lead by example\" method worked most of the times that we've tried it (although not always immediately). It avoids calling out someone's mistake in front of others, and makes it a bit easier for someone who doesn't fully understand your culture. It's also at the very top of the email, so it's hard to ignore. This obviously won't work for one-on-one conversations, but in those instances it's easier to be direct without risking offense.\n\nMake up your own \"everyday\" name\n\nI've had a bunch of clients over the years who didn't use any of their proper names (first, last or middle) in normal conversation and everyone (including themselves) addressed by some other name. You can pick any name you want and tell everyone to use that and hardly every reference your official name.\n\nSo you're free to just tell everyone to call you \"Pat\" or \"Mike\" or \"Dutch\" or whatever you want.\n\nPlonk it on your emails, and stick it on a tee-shirt and on your office door (assuming you have that rarer and rarer luxury of an actual office - with a door no less). Stick it on emails and your default signature. You can plonk a standard footer indicating your real name and title and position as well.\n\nStrictly speaking there's no reason your new name can't be an email-alias as well, but a lot of IT departments and HR departments have \"set in stone\" rules that don't achieve anything and in your case may be counter productive - I wonder how many people have tried emailing you with the names the wrong way around ? So in your case there is a valid argument for having an alias email as well as a \"real\" one.\n\nSome people can't be corrected on this easily. How much you wish to correct them depends on how much you're prepared to disrupt the conversation as well as how much it bothers you. The error you're seeing is likely to be at the more bothersome end of the scale, and if it recurs with an individual probably needs clear correction. A PS is probably too gentle.\n\nLike you, I'm in academia, and prefer to be addressed by my given (first) name. Some students can't be persuaded. Most of those settle on \"Dr Surname\", which feels overly formal but is at least correct; \"Dr Chris\" is common among students from some backgrounds, and I'm sometimes addressed by my bare surname even though it's not used as a given name. This was normal in school, but I suspect it has more to do with referring to authors in the 3rd person by their surnames alone.\n\nI wouldn't try too hard to persuade them against using \"Dr Surname\" - an attempt or two early on but then I leave it. Some students seem more comfortable with a little formality acting as a barrier. Similarly if someone's cultural background means they regard \"Dr Chris\" as suitable, I won't labour the point, though I will try to educate them, especially if they're new to UK/western academia.\n\nOn the rare occasions when my bare surname is used in an email of speech I do try to stop it, gently but directly. Something like \"Please call me Chris, or Dr Surname if you want to be formal. Calling me just Surname makes me feel like I'm back in school, and in trouble\"\n\n1. Forgo the signature\n\nAny email program that allows signatures should have a setting to either add your signature automatically to every email, or to ask you, or to have a checkbox for yes/no, or add it to the bottom of the email you compose as text but allow you to delete it, or some subset thereof.\n\nWhen communicating with people outside your institution, or anyone who doesn't already know you, a signature including your full name and position is a very good thing. However, I would assume a student who's taking your class already knows that you're a professor at that university, right? So you don't need to provide that extra info.\n\nThanks,\n\nFirstname\n\nmight actually get read and is a lot clearer than\n\nThanks,\n\nFirstname\n\nFirstname Lastname, MFA in Underwater Basketweaving, PhD in Underbasket Waterweaving, Basket U Associate Professor of Weaving, Underwater U\n\nAuthor, Waste Baskets: Towards a New Ethical Hermeneutic of Weaving in the Age of Twitter\n\netc.\n\nwhich everyone's eyes tend to skip right over.\n\n2. Check your \"display name\"\n\nComputers are supposed to facilitate communication, not impede it. Good IT techs know this and will want to help you out if possible. At my last org, everyone's display name (the human name the email program says the email is from, instead of or in addition to the actual email address) included a nickname. This was especially helpful if the name you went by every day wasn't obvious to a non-native speaker, like \"Doe, Margaret Ann (Peggy)\", or was something else entirely like \"Doe, John J. (Sketch)\". But if your name is John James, and your current display name is \"John James\" or \"James, John\" and you think that might be part of the problem, you could ask for one like \"John James (John)\" or \"James, John Q. (John)\" or something like that, to highlight your preferred mode of address."
