        "text": "Message from the Dean\n\nAt Regent University School of Law, we educate and cultivate purpose-driven, practice-ready attorneys who will make a difference in the world. We’re a community of scholars that is serious about the law, serious about our faith, and committed to living out our calling to the law together—in community.\n\nWe have an exceptional faculty that is committed to teaching you well and mentoring you as you step into your calling. Princeton Review has ranked our faculty among the best in the nation in teaching quality and tied for 1st best in the nation for accessibility. I can’t imagine there’s another faculty that cares more about their students.\n\nThere’s never been a better time to be a student at Regent Law. Today, more than 4,000 purpose-driven, practice-ready alumni work in Washington D.C., all 50 states, and 20 countries.\n\nThey are arguing in the U.S. Supreme Court, serving as judges, working in state and federal government, practicing as prosecutors and defense lawyers, employed by big and small firms, and working in business. Others serve in places and situations that cry out for justice—for example, working overseas to rescue victims of human trafficking and exploitation.\n\nMany of our graduates go on to serve as law clerks for state and federal judges. In fact, over 18% of the class of 2021 secured a clerkship after graduation, placing Regent Law 28th in the nation. And in 2021, Regent Law grads secured eight federal judicial clerkships.\n\nOur most recent incoming class was the strongest in the school’s history—boasting a median LSAT of 157 and undergraduate GPA of over 3.6.\n\nThe opportunities here have never been better. You can get hands-on training working on Supreme Court cases with the American Center for Law and Justice and the Robertson Center for Constitutional Law. You can serve around the world with our Center for Global Justice®. Or get hands-on training closer to home at the Grace Law Clinic or our Child Advocacy Clinic.\n\nThese opportunities led preLaw Magazine to place our public-policy offerings among the top-four in the nation. We also have an outstanding moot court program that is consistently ranked among the top programs in the country. And for our strongest students, our Honors Program provides exceptional opportunities for intellectual and personal growth.\n\nWhatever you are called to do—we want to train you to do it with passion, excellence, and integrity. I invite you to explore our core J.D. program as well as our innovative B.A. in Law, M.A. in Law, and LLM programs in Human Rights and American Legal Studies.\n\nBut don’t just take my word for it—come visit and see for yourself."
