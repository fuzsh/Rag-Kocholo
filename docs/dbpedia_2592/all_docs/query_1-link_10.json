        "text": "Robert Edouard Moritz (2 Jun 1868 – 28 Dec 1940) was a German-American mathematician. He published about 75 books and papers. For over 30 years he was head of the mathematics department at the University of Washington.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nLiterametrics' may become to philology, what 'Biometrics' has already become to the biological sciences.\n\nRobert E. Moritz, \"On the Significance of Characteristic Curves of Composition,\" Popular Science Monthly 65 (June 1904), as cited in: Benjamin Morgan (2017), The Outward Mind: Materialist Aesthetics in Victorian Science and Literature. p. 236\n\nEvery one knows that the fine phrase \"God geometrizes\" is attributed to Plato, but few know where this famous passage is found, or the exact words in which it was first expressed. Those who, like the author, have spent hours and even days in the search of the exact statements, or the exact references, of similar famous passages, will not question the timeliness and usefulness of a book whose distinct purpose it is to bring together into a single volume exact quotations, with their exact references, bearing on one of the most time-honored, and even today the most active and most fruitful of all the sciences, the queen-mother of all the sciences, that is, mathematics.\n\nRobert Edouard Moritz. On Mathematics and Mathematicians, 1914, 1942, 1958; p. v; Preface, lead sentence\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikisource has original text related to:\n\nRobert Edouard Moritz—In memoriam, by R.M. Winger, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 47.3 (1941): 188-190."
