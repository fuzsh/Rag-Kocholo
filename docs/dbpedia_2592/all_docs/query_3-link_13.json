        "text": "After 39 amazing years, including the last eight as PwC’s Global Chair, today is my last day with this great organization. Much like my predecessor did for me, I have had the privilege of working closely with incoming Global Chair, Mohamed Kande, to ensure a smooth leadership transition. Mohamed is a globally-minded, purpose-driven leader who will bring a wealth of knowledge to the role based on his unique experience working across different PwC businesses, geographies and industries. I leave knowing PwC is in great hands and am fully confident that Mohamed and the new leadership team will do a great job stewarding PwC into the future. I want to say a huge thank you to everyone I have had the privilege of interacting with, in particular my PwC partners and colleagues. Thank you for what you do, every day. I am proud of what we have collectively achieved and look forward to seeing what the future holds. #PwCProud\n\nAs AI transforms the economy, we analysed over half a billion job ads from 15 countries to examine how it is impacting productivity, job creation and skills needs. Two findings stood out for me. First, our data suggests AI is already making workers much more productive. It shows that sectors that are especially exposed to AI are experiencing nearly 5 times higher growth in labour productivity, which is a key driver of economic growth and rising living standards. So we’re seeing that AI has the potential to make a positive impact on the economy and society. But AI is linked to an increased rate of change which brings me to the second finding that stood out for me. Skills sought by employers are changing much faster in occupations more exposed to AI, with old skills disappearing - and new skills appearing - in job ads at a 25% higher rate than in occupations less exposed to AI. This has huge implications for people and society as workers in these occupations will need to develop new skills to stay relevant. Companies and policymakers, along with workers themselves, share a responsibility to help people rapidly build those skills so they can thrive in the changing world of work. At PwC, we’re on our own journey to roll out AI tools across our network and upskill our people to enhance their work.

I see it daily on the personal side with my wife, daughter, step-daughters, daughters-in-law and many nieces, as well as the many talented women at PwC and from the broader stakeholder groups we interact with. But today is also a timely reminder of how much more needs to be done to create equitable workplaces worldwide where women and men have equal opportunities to advance their careers. It is an issue of inequity, not talent. New insights from our Workplace Inclusion Indicator Index – which draws on findings from PwC’s annual survey of close to 54,000 workers across 46 countries and territories – show there remains a gender inclusion gap in the workplace that is holding women back. Closing this gap is critical to advancing gender equity in the workplace. In my article below for the World Economic Forum, I talk about the findings of our research and what organisations can do to close this gap, drawing on our own experience at PwC. We are on an ongoing journey to foster a culture of belonging and equity across our network and while we are proud of our progress, we recognize that we still have a long way to go. We are committed to listening to all of our people and continuing to take the actions needed to foster a truly inclusive workplace, learning lessons along the way and using inclusion as a key enabler for gender equity and, indeed, equity for all underrepresented groups. As global megatrends like technology continue to change the world of work, it has never been more important to focus on creating equitable and inclusive workplaces around the world. Let’s all work towards that goal – on International Women’s Day and every day. #InclusionMatters #IWD2024\n\nLast week, I had the privilege of taking part in the World Economic Forum’s Annual Meeting in Davos. As I reflect on the week, I wanted to share three themes that stood out for me. The first is around generative AI which was a major focus at Davos. Our 27th Annual Global CEO Survey found that CEOs overwhelmingly see generative AI as a catalyst for reinvention that will power efficiency, innovation, and transformational change. They are also optimistic about the short-term impact; over the next 12 months, almost half say it will enhance their ability to build trust with stakeholders. But while CEOs are increasingly looking to the transformative benefits, the great majority say it will require workforce upskilling and recognize the need to manage risks around misinformation, legal liabilities and bias. CEOs will need to navigate the tensions between the potential risks of generative AI and the desire to move quickly to capitalise on opportunities. You can read the full survey findings here: https://lnkd.in/ewcUiMwQ Second is the unlocked potential of energy demand reduction. With the world population set to grow by 2 billion by 2050, the challenge of Net Zero cannot be met purely by transforming energy supply. There also needs to be a change in demand, so the world can do more with less energy. We published a new piece of research with the World Economic Forum’s International Business Council, a group of over 120 global CEOs, which shows how we can reduce global energy consumption by 31% without reducing economic output, saving over $2 trillion in annual energy costs. You can watch a replay of the panel and download the report here: https://lnkd.in/eV3-RmHH Third is the importance of putting skills first, which is the focus of a new World Economic Forum report published in Davos which we provided analysis for. While business leaders are acutely aware of the importance of having the right talent, recruitment remains an imperfect science. The measures businesses use to assess candidates - including work history and qualifications - are often only a proxy for the skills they really want; and not always a good proxy. As a result, employees miss out on jobs and employers miss out on skills they need. We hope the analysis in this report will encourage many more organizations to adopt a skills first approach to hiring and talent management. You can read more here: https://lnkd.in/eZD2U2RJ I would like to thank the World Economic Forum for bringing together so many stakeholders to discuss these important issues and more.

Among the 4700+ CEOs we surveyed, concern about inflation is down and expectations of economic growth are up. At the same time, the proportion who think their company will not last a decade without major change is also up - from 39% last year to 45% in this year’s survey. Why? Across almost every megatrend we looked at - from technology to climate to demographic shifts - business leaders expect greater pressure in the future than they faced in the past. As business leaders are becoming less concerned about macroeconomic challenges, they are becoming more focused on disruptive forces within their industries. Whether it is accelerating the roll-out of generative AI or building their business to address the challenges and opportunities of the climate transition, this is a year of transformation. The survey provides deep insight into how business leaders are making those shifts today and raises important questions to think about as we all plan for the future. You can explore all of the findings and download the report on our website: https://pwc.to/3NyVuqR You can also watch a replay of our live launch here: http://pwc.to/Davos24 I would like to thank Nisha Pillai for moderating and my colleagues Mohamed Kande, Kevin Ellis CBE, Petra Justenhoven, Raymund Chao and Carol Stubbings for adding to the discussion. #CEOSurvey #TheNewEquation\n\nWith the World Economic Forum Meeting kicking off in a few days, I am glad I had the opportunity to write a piece on energy demand, a topic which will be high on the agenda next week in Davos. Action to decarbonise energy is crucial, but we also need to pay more attention to energy demand. With the world economy expected to double by 2050, reducing energy intensity is an important - and often overlooked - solution that has huge potential to help the world unlock abundant and affordable clean energy. Our new report with the World Economic Forum’s International Business Council, launched earlier this week, shows how we can reduce global energy consumption by 31% without reducing economic output, saving over $2 trillion in annual energy costs. Improvements in energy efficiency on this scale would significantly reduce carbon emissions from energy and put the world comfortably ahead of the energy usage targets set out in the Paris Agreement. I look forward to talking more about this important topic next week in Davos. You can find out more here: https://lnkd.in/ebP3Pymz #wef24 #TheNewEquation"
