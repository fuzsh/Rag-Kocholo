Since her father was Phra Ong Chao, Somanass was destined to be Mom Chao. However, Nangklao specially granted her the title of Phra Ong Chao i.e. princess.\n\nIn 1851, upon his coronation, Mongkut married Princess Somanass, them she became the queen. In the same year she gave birth to a prince: Somdet Chaofa Somanass, but the prince shortly died. Queen Somanass herself died two months after."
