        "text": "\"King Chulalongkorn started to experiment with a functionally differentiated cabinet-government in 1888. The King's major aim was, 'to divide the work so that each ministry is responsible for that which it is capable of doing.' The traditional arrangement, whereby there were two Prime Ministers [อัครมหาเสนาบดี], Four Supporting Ministers [สนาบดีจตุสดมภ์], and six Councillors [มนตรี], was discarded. It was replaced by a cabinet of twelve ministers of equal rank whose functions were strictly differentiated. The Prime Ministerships for the civil and the military administration which were also the Ministries for the North and the South, the Mahatthai [มหาดไทย] and the Kalahom [กลาโหม], were relieved of all but their territorial responsibilities. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Krommatha [กรมท่า], was relieved of its territories and left with only its diplomatic responsibilities. While three of the 'Four Supporting Ministries' were shorn of their extraneous activities, the fourth, the Ministry of Finance, was enlarged and given the entire financial administration of the government.\n\nThree new ministries were brought into being, the Ministries of Defence, Justice, and Public Works. The Department of Education, which was one year old, and the age-old Department of the Royal Scribes, were both promoted to ministerial status, the latter of which was given a new title, the Ministry of the Royal Secretariat.\n\nThe reform of the central government was not enacted into law immediately, because time was needed for all the adjustments which had to be made. The loyalty of the men whom King Chulalongkorn had designated as the new ministers did not make up for either their youth or their lack of experience. When the experimental cabinet began to have meetings in 1888, if the Ministers of the North and the South, who were mere figure-heads, were not counted, the average age of the ministers, who included two of the King's brothers, seven of his half-brothers, and a commoner, was just over thirty two. The youngest of the ministers, Prince Damrong Rachanuphap [ดำรงราชานุภาพ, 1862 -1943] and Prince Narissaranuwattiwong [นริศรานุวัดติวงศ์, 1863 - 1974], who were both only twenty-six years old, were entrusted with the Ministries of Education and Public Works, the former of which was only one year old, and the latter or which was a completely new foundation. The others were more fortunate in being given ministries which had some traditional foundations, They had, however, to solve the problem of the transfer of departments between each others' ministries so that functional differentiation could be strictly observed. The difficulties did not terminate with the creation of ministries and the transfer of departments, for the success of the new system ultimately depended on the officials' reaction to the new administration. A completely new civil service mentality had to be acquired. Men, who had lived off a share of the judicial fees and the country's taxes, had to adjust themselves to the idea that they were becoming servants of the State, who were expected to work fixed hours and to receive regular salaries. In spite of all these difficulties, the shift in political power had, however, swept the opposition aside, and when King Chulalongkorn's policy was enacted into law in 1892, the government was enabled to start to mobilize all available resources in order to defend the Kingdom's territorial integrity and to reform the provincial administration.\"\n\n[Quelle: Tej Bunnag [เตช บุนนาค] <1943 - >: The provincial administration of Siam from 1892 to 1915 : a study off the creation, the growth, the achievements, and the implications for modern Siam, of the ministry of the interior under prince Damrong Rachanuphap. -- Diss. Oxford : St. Anthonys College, Michaelmas Term 1968. -- 429 S., Schreibmaschinenschrift. -- S. 96 - 99. -- Faire use]\n\n\"KIANGHAI [Chiang Rai - ᩮᨾᩥᩬᨦᨩᩭᨦᩁᩣᩭ].\n\nKianghai, the old frontier town between Siam and the Shān State of Kiang Tung [Kengtung - ၵဵင်းတုင်], is situated on the right bank of the Me Khok [Mae Kok - แม่น้ำกก] river. It is described as the \"old\" frontier town because, though the Kiang Tung Shāns still claim the country north of the Me Khok river, yet the Siamese occupation extends to Me Tsai [Mae Sai - แม่สาย] on the Me Tsai river, a point about 45 miles due north of Kianghai.\n\nThe town is 1,600 yards long by 750 yards wide, of an irregular oblong shape, surrounded by a stout brick-wall and parapet; also the work of Along Paiah [Alaungpaya - အလောင်းဘုရား, 1714 - 1760], the Burman General who built the Zimmé [Chiang Mai - ᨩ᩠ᨿᨦᩉ᩠ᨾᩲ᩵] wall. The interior is covered with detached houses, more or less thickly scattered amongst trees.\n\nThe population does not exceed 1,500 inhabitants.\n\nThe main road down the centre is broad and good, but not metalled. A road divides the town breadthways, and another runs from the centre road to the second river-gate; both of these are broad enough for guns.\n\nA above-mentioned, the town is surrounded by a wall. This wall is from 6 feet to 4 feet high, and 4 feet thick; built of solid burnt brick, and standing on an earth parapet from 8 feet to 15 feet high. It is loopholed throughout at 4 feet intervals. Though in a bad state of disrepair in many parts, it is capable of affording very good protection to the defenders, and in a fortnight could be put into a thoroughly efficient state of defence. The top of the wall is roughly castellated, as at Zimmé [Chiang Mai]. At the north-east corner there is no wall, but a high mound, along which earth-works were originally made, fills in this portion, and makes it the strongest corner of the town.\n\nAll round the interior face of the parapet runs a path capable of being broadened into a gun road.\n\nThe ditch is shallow, and, in most parts, dry, and need be considered no obstacle.\n\nRound the outside of the ditch a small path runs round the town, and outside this on all sides, except towards the river, is a thick belt of bamboo clumps and trees with scattered huts in it.\n\nThe chief water-supply is introduced by a cutting from the river entering at the north-west face. There are also wells near all the principal houses. The Me Khok [Mae Kok - แม่น้ำกก] river flows past the north-east face of the town, about 100 yards from the walls.\n\nThere is no regular garrison, but, as at Zimmé [Chiang Mai], each householder is supposed to possess some sort of fire-arm. Probably there are not more than 200 serviceable muzzle-loaders in the place. There is a so-called arsenal which contains a collection of rubbish in the shape of jingals and old flint-locks.\n\nAs it stands at present, the wall on the three land sides can be approached under good cover to within 100 yards, there being a thick belt of trees round those faces.\n\nThe town is not commanded by higher ground in any direction, and the only position from which guns could bombard it by direct fire would be from across the river.\n\nA daily market on a small scale is held at the cross-roads in the middle of the town. The market women sell fish, tobacco, betel-nut, chillies, and the like. There are no butchers, and meat is not often procurable.\n\nLarge supplies of meat (beef and pork), rice, tobacco, and sugar could be collected from the surrounding country.\n\nKianghai [Chiang Rai] is a dead-alive decayed old place, which has seen better days; but which might, even now, regain its former importance if it would bestir itself. It lies on the chief trading route between China and Burma, and on that between Burma and the Eastern Laos States, situated on a fine water-way, and in the midst of a fertile and well-cultivated country. There appears to be no local market for European goods, and no local trade, the only shops being temporary ones opened by caravans for a day or two en route. It speaks well for the prospects of English trade that English goods, making the long land journey to Kianghai, and then being conveyed in boats down the Me Khok and Cambodia rivers, can compete favourably with French goods as far down the latter river as Luang Prabāng [ຫຼວງພຣະບາງ]. As far as I was able to judge from the few days I was at Kianghai, it appeared to me that the English trade towards Kiangtsen [Chiang Saen - เชียงแสน], Kiang Khong [Chiang Khong - เชียงของ\n\n], and generally down the Cambodia river [Mekong - ແມ່ນ້ຳຂອງ] was much more considerable than the trade to the Shan State of Kiang Tung [Kengtung - ၵဵင်းတုင်] and thence on to Yunnan [云南].\n\nIn February the Me Khok [Mae Kok] river at Kianghai [Chiang Rai] is about 300 feet broad, but in flood time nearly twice that breadth. Its depth varies a good deal, but there are two fords close to the town which are practicable during the dry season. The first of these is exactly opposite the north-east face of the town; it crosses at right angles, and is 3 feet deep; current strong. Loaded mules can cross, but their loads are apt to get wet. The near bank is low and sloping, with a sandy beach; the far bank perpendicular and 8 feet high; below the ford the water is deep. It would be necessary to stake it out and also to ramp the opposite bank to make it safe and passable for troops. It is commanded from the town wall. At 300 yards range the second ford is about ¼ of a mile down-stream, and is out of sight of the town. It is a more complicated ford than the upper one, but shallower. The ford runs for the first 30 yards at right angles to the bank, then turns down-stream for 50 yards, then crosses direct to the opposite bank (vide diagram, page 40). The near bank is perpendicular and 10 feet high; the far bank is low and sloping. The ford requires careful staking, and the near bank would have to be ramped for the passage of troops. In the rainy season both these fords are impassable for anything but elephants. There are no boats that can be depended upon, but bamboo rafts for the conveyance of troops could be easily and quickly constructed.\n\nAbb.: Shape of the ford Me Khok River [Mae Kok]\n\nFrom Kianghai [Chiang Rai], the Me Khok [Mae Kok] river takes a north-easterly course and joins the Me Khong [Mekong] or Cambodia river at Kiangtsen [Chiang Saen]. It is navigable for river boats from Kianghai [Chiang Rai] downwards, and is used as the main trading route between Moulmein [မော်လမြိုင်မြို့\n\n] and the towns on the Cambodia river [Mekong] as far as Luang Prabang.\n\nExtensive camping grounds on all sides.\"\n\n[a.a.O., S. 31 - 33]\n\n\"KIANG TSEN [Chiang Saen - เชียงแสน].\n\n(From information furnished by\n\nE. B. Gould, Esq.)\n\nN.B.A few alterations in spelling have been made, as it was thought advisable to avoid the confusion which would arise from having the same towns spelt in different ways, in different parts of the same book\n\nG. J. Y.\n\nAbout one hundred years ago this place, Kiangtsen [Chiang Saen], was one of the most populous and thriving of the Laos towns, and was at that time tributary to Burma. It was, however, (about 1789 A.D.) attacked by the Siamese forces and was captured. The Siamese did not attempt to govern the conquered district, but carried off, as prisoners of war, the whole surviving population of the town and district. The once famous city, with its broad surrounding rice fields, was thus left entirely deserted, and rapidly reverted to jungle. The extent of the ruins alone now attest the former wealth of the place.\n\nFor a long period the fertile plain in which the city stood was left without human inhabitants. Gradually the people of the neighbouring State of Kiang Tung [Kentung - ၵဵင်းတုင်] began to re-settle in the country, and the process went quietly on until much of the land down to the Me Hok [Mae Hok - แม่ฮวก] was again dotted with villages and cultivated lands. The plain immediately around Kiangtsen [Chiang Saen] and the city itself would also soon have been occupied by Kiang Tung [Kengtung] subjects; but the Siamese Government, having apparently become in some degree aware of the value of the place, determined to re-settle it themselves. Accordingly, nine years ago, a Chao Luang [เจ้าหลวง], or head chief, was appointed to take up his residence in Kiangtsen [Chiang Saen] and to administer the country as a sub-province under Chiengmai [Chiang Mai], and a number of families, generally the descendants of the original people of Kiangtsen [Chiang Saen], carried off as above stated, were compelled to go and settle in the city and the surrounding country. The Kiang Tung [Kengtung] people protested, claiming the country as belonging to Burma and threatened hostilities, but took no actual measures against the re-occupation of the city and the surrounding district by the Siamese. No effort was made to disturb the Kiang Tung [Kengtung] people north of the Me Hok [Mae Hok] and the Siamese contented themselves with the still remaining unoccupied tracts south of that river. The Siamese re-settlement, however, went on very slowly, and fresh settlements of Kiang Tung [Kengtung]\n\nShāns began to creep down the main road running through the Kiangtsen [Chiang Saen] plains. Consequently, a short time ago Prince Bigit [Phichit Prichakorn - พระเจ้าบรมวงศ์เธอ พระองค์เจ้าคัคณางคยุคล กรมหลวงพิชิตปรีชากร, 1855 - 1909], on behalf of the Siamese Government, ordered the building of a stockade on the bank of the river Me Tsai [Mae Sai - แม่สาย], and all persons coming from the north were required to stop at this stockade and receive a Siamese passport, before they were allowed to proceed further. This step was intended to be an assertion of ownership, and was, I now think after a personal inspection of the district, a necessary measure if Kiangtsen [Chiang Saen] was to be retained at all. The Kiang Tung [Kengtung] settlements north of the Me Hok [Mae Hok} have not been interfered with as yet by the authorities of new Kiangtsen [Chiang Saen], and the Kiang Tung [Kengtung] people would undoubtedly resist any such interference by force of arms. At present the Siamese subjects and the people of Kiang Tung [Kengtung] in the border districts are good friends, and a good deal of intermarriage takes place. Unless, therefore, the respective governments of Kiang Tung [Kengtung] and Chiengmai [Chiang Mai] force matters, no quarrel is likely to arise, that is on the Kiangtsen [Chiang Saen] part of the Siamese border.\n\nKiangtsen [Chiang Saen] is situated on the right bank of the Me Kong [Mekong], or Cambodia river, which here is already a great river as broad and deep as the river Me Nam [Maenam Chao Phraya] at Bangkok.\n\nImmediately behind the city there stretches a magnificent plain bordered to the west by a semi-circular sweep of mountains, from whose fantastic gorges issue numerous perennial streams which intersect at almost regular intervals the open country, and afford the means of rice cultivation in perfection.\n\nHere were the rich fields of the former inhabitants of the city, whose canals, now choked by vegetation, still remain, possibly to be again cleared and utilised by new settlers in the talked-of regeneration of Kiangtsen [Chiang Saen] by the Siamese. The few new settlers who have already here and there re-cleared and planted rice have been repaid by immense crops; and with the certainty of protection from war and oppression, the process of re-settlement would go on apace. Already the big game which ten years ago was to be found in abundance throughout this plain has retired before the sounds of human labour. Rhinoceri and wild cattle, which lately could be met with close to the walls of the city, have now disappeared. Herds of deer may, however, still be seen by the traveller as he crosses the sea of long grass, which, sparsely dotted with trees, now covers the flat country around the city. The city itself is surrounded on the land side by a double rampart and moat of imposing dimensions. The water-face at present has no wall, but the river-bank is high and steep, and the stream swift and deep below. These natural defences may have enabled the former inhabitants to dispense with a wall on this side. I am inclined, however, to think that there was a river-wall also, but that the stream has eaten the bank away, and with it the wall. The space enclosed between the ramparts and the river is now mainly jungle and forest-buried, in which are to be found numerous ruins of temples, the brick masonry of which, however, has, as usual, entirely succumbed to the action of the elements and of the huge creepers which in Siam so soon destroy the ill-cemented brick-work which forms the usual architecture of the country. The prachadees [Phra Chedi - พระเจดีย์], or pagodas, often, however, remain nearly intact, and still rising above the underwood serve to guide the stranger to heaps of bricks which mark the sites of the old temples, and there, amid the shapeless desolation, may be found here and there a great sitting figure of Buddha in imperishable bronze, and around the central figure, which by its weight and size has retained its original position, are to be seen great numbers of smaller images of Buddha, generally of bronze also, but sometimes of white stone, which have been picked up in the jungle around and placed by the pious Buddhist finders within the precincts of the ancient temple. These bronze images are many of them of excellent workmanship, and bear inscriptions some in old Siamese, and some in Shān characters, the latter identical with those now in use among the Northern Shāns.\"\n\n[a.a.O., S. 33 - 35]\n\n\"The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited is a prominent bank established and based in Hong Kong since 1865 when Hong Kong was a colony of the British Empire. It is the founding member of the HSBC Group and since 1990 is now a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings plc. The company's business ranges from the traditional High Street roles of personal finance and commercial banking, to corporate and investment banking, private banking and global banking. It is the largest bank in Hong Kong with branches and offices throughout the Asia Pacific region including other countries around the world.\n\nHSBC is one of the oldest banking groups in the modern world. The bank is known locally simply as \"The Bank\", \"Hongkong Bank\" and \"Lion Bank\".\n\nHistory Foundation\n\nAfter the British established Hong Kong as a colony in the aftermath of the First Opium War, local merchants felt the need for a bank to finance the growing trade between China and Europe (with traded products including opium).[2][3] They established the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Company Limited in Hong Kong (March 1865) and Shanghai (one month later).\n\nThe founder, a Scotsman named Thomas Sutherland wanted a bank operating on \"sound Scottish banking principles.\" Still, the original location of the bank was considered crucial and the founders chose Wardley House in Hong Kong since the construction was based on some of the best feng shui in Colonial Hong Kong.[4] The bank initially leased its premises for HK$500 a month in 1864.\n\nAfter raising a capital stock of HK$5 million, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Company Ltd. opened its doors on 3 March 1865. It opened a branch in Shanghai during April of that year, and started issuing locally-denominated banknotes in both the Crown Colony and Shanghai soon afterwards. The bank was incorporated in Hong Kong by special dispensation from the British Treasury in 1866, and under the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank Ordinance 1866,[5] a new branch in Japan was also established. The bank handled the first public loan in China in 1874, thereafter issuing most public loans.\n\nBusiness development\n\nSir Thomas Jackson became chief manager in 1876. During his twenty-six year tenure, the Bank became a leader in Asia. Notable events included being the first bank established in Thailand, in 1888, where it printed the country's first banknotes; acting as banker for the Hong Kong government from the 1880s; and participating in the management of British colonial government accounts in China, Japan, Penang and Singapore. A period of expansion followed, with new branch offices opening in Bangkok (1921), Manila (1922) and Shanghai (1923), and a new head office building in Hong Kong in 1935.\n\nSecond World War\n\nIn anticipation of the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong in 1941, the Bank's head office moved to London. During the period 1941-1943 the chief manager Vandeleur Grayburn, and his successor David C Edmondston, both died while interned by the Japanese. Arthur Morse was appointed Chief Manager in 1943 and led the bank after the war. The head office moved back to Hong Kong in 1946. During the Japanese occupation the Bank's head office building was occupied as the headquarters of the Hong Kong Japanese military government.\n\nInternational expansion\n\nMichael Turner became Chief Manager in 1953 and set about diversifying the business. His tenure came to an end in 1962 having established The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation of California 1955 and having acquired The British Bank of the Middle East and the Mercantile Bank (based in India) in Aug 1959. Turner was succeeded in 1962 by Jake Saunders. In 1964 the Chief Managership was superseded as the top executive role in the bank by an Executive Chairmanship.[6] Saunders took this role until retirement in 1972 and was succeeded as Chief Manager in 1964 by H.J. Shen, the managing director of Maysun Trading Co. and the former head of the Central Trust of China, who became the first ethnic Chinese to be appointed to the position of Chief Manager of the bank. Under Saunders' tenure the bank continued to expand. 1965 saw the bank purchase a controlling interest in Hang Seng Bank of Hong Kong, and 1972 the formation of a merchant banking arm, Wardley Limited.\n\nIn 1980, the Bank launched a hostile takeover bid for the Royal Bank of Scotland, although the bid was blocked by the British government.\n\nThe creation of the HSBC Group\n\nIn 1980, the Bank, now under the chairmanship of Michael Sandberg, acquired a 51% stake in Marine Midland Bank, of the United States of America, and continued its expansion with the establishment of Hongkong Bank of Canada in 1981 and Hongkong Bank of Australia Limited in 1986. 1987, under the Chairmanship of William Purves, saw the bank's ownership of Marine Midland Bank increased to 100% and the acquisition of a 14.9% share in Midland Bank in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe present building in Hong Kong was designed by Sir Norman Foster and was held as one of the most expensive and technologically advanced buildings in the world in 1986, costing HK$5.3 billion.[4]\n\nIn 1991 HSBC Holdings plc was established to act as a parent company to the group; shares are currently traded on the London, Hong Kong, Paris, New York and Bermuda stock exchanges.\n\n[...]\n\nHeadquarters\n\nHSBC's Hong Kong headquarters are at 1 Queen's Road Central in the Central area on Hong Kong Island.[9] The HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building was also home to HSBC Holdings plc's headquarters until the latter firm's move to 8 Canada Square, London to meet the requirements of the UK regulatory authorities after the acquisition of the Midland Bank in 1992. It was designed by British architect Lord Norman Foster, and was the most expensive building in the world based on usable floor area at the time it was built. needed]\n\n[...]\n\nAsia Pacific operations\n\nThe Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation maintains a network of around 600 offices in 20 countries in Asia Pacific, as well as owning of a number of HSBC banks operating in various countries and holding the group's stakes in further lenders, particularly in mainland China.\n\nOperations of the group in the Asia Pacific are under this subsidiary, and it forms the regional headquarters for Asia Pacific. This means that it is responsible for entities such as HSBC Bank Australia Limited, Hang Seng Bank Limited, HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, HSBC Bank Malaysia Berhad (since 2009), HSBC Bank (Vietnam) Limited, HSBC Bank (Taiwan) Limited and HSBC Insurance (Asia-Pacific) Holdings Limited, and the management of stakes in Bank of Communications (19.9%), Barrowgate Limited (24.64%) and Industrial Bank. But excluding the majority of the HSBCs Private Banking business in Asia Pacific.\n\n[...] Thailand\n\nHSBC initially opened for business in Thailand in 1888, becoming the first commercial bank in the country. HSBC has made significant contributions to the establishment of solid foundations for Thailands financial and banking sectors. For example, in 1889 HSBC issued the first banknotes in Thailand. HSBC also issued the first foreign loan to the Thai government for its railroad construction project. HSBC's main branch office in Thailand is situated in Bangkok on Rama IV Road opposite Lumpini Park. In 2011, Phase 2 of the new Financial Sector Master Plan allowed foreign banks to open up to two branches in the Kingdom of Thailand in preparation for full retail operations. Accordingly, a second branch was opened on Thonglor (Sukhumvit 55) in early 2011.\"\n\n[Quelle: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hongkong_and_Shanghai_Banking_Corporation. -- Zugriff am 2011-10-27]"
