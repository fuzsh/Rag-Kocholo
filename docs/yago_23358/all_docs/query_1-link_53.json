[Pp. 9-11 in: \"Treasures of Two Nations: Thai Royal Gifts to the United States of America\", by Lisa McQuail. Washington, D.C.: Asian Cultural History Program, Smithsonian Institution. = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = The Thai Royal Gifts so admirably researched and illustrated in this volume are deeply symbolic of the long and evolving friendship between Thailand (formerly called Siam) and the United States of America. This study documents for the first time a group of artifacts whose meaning and significance have, until now, been inadequately understood by scholars, and sometimes even misunderstood by the recipients of the gifts themselves-the presidents and people of the United States. Yet for both Thais and Americans these gifts truly are historic, artistic, and scientific treasures, through which the Kings of Thailand represented their nation, and its alliances with America through time. Nearly all sets of gifts, from the courtly nielloware, silks, musical instruments and weapons to the everyday basketry, tools, agricultural samples and fish traps, were accompanied by a Royal Letter listing the contents of the gift (in Thai and English), and explaining its significance. This catalog introduces those Royal Letters and their lists, for the first time, into the interpretation of the gifts. This book will interest art-, social-, and diplomatic historians; anthropologists, linguists, and ethnomusicologists; students of Thai theater and culture; and all those who will appreciate the aesthetic quality of the gift objects or the very good stories those objects were meant to tell.\n\nThe discovery and excavation in the 1960s through to the mid 1970s of several prehistoric sites in north and northeastern Thailand, the best known being the World Heritage site of Ban Chiang, were a major breakthrough in Southeast Asian archaeology. Evidence of an autonomous Bronze Age tradition contradicted colonial scholarship’s view of Southeast Asia as a cultural backwater that owed its advancement to imports from India and China. Subsequently, based on a dating later rejected, Ban Chiang was at the center of an international debate about the beginning of world metallurgy. Focus on chronological and typological issues has obscured the fact that American archaeologists surveyed and excavated sites in Northeast Thailand at the time when the region was thoroughly militarized to provide frontline facilities for the Vietnam War. This article examines the production of American archaeological knowledge on Southeast Asian prehistory in relation to the Cold War politics, and more specifically of Thailand’s neocolonial dependence on the United States.\n\nThis article describes a unique grouping of seventy-one artworks, and examples of tools used for their production, collectively termed \"Theatrical Images\" when presented as royal gifts from King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) for display at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. The US Navy prepared and printed copies of an English translation of the original (now lost) Thai list of over 900 objects for the Exposition, grouped into various categories (including that of \"Theatrical Images\"). This grouping has not previously been studied or considered as an apparently authentic Thai category of royal gift. Some items were photographed for the first time for this publication, and several new discoveries about these artworks are presented here. = = = = = See publisher's website for information on purchasing full journal: https://www.artsofasianet.com/back_issues/back_issue.php?issue_code=2018_may_jun\n\nRanging across the longue durée of Thailand’s history, Monastery, Monument, Museum is an eminently readable and original contribution to the study of the kingdom’s art and culture. Eschewing issues of dating, style, and iconography, historian Maurizio Peleggi addresses distinct types of artifacts and artworks as both the products and vehicles of cultural memory. From the temples of Chiangmai to the Emerald Buddha, from the National Museum of Bangkok to the prehistoric culture of Northeast Thailand, and from the civic monuments of the 1930s to the political artworks of the late twentieth century, even well-known artworks and monuments reveal new meanings when approached from this perspective. Part I, “Sacred Geographies,” focuses on the premodern era, when religious credence informed the cultural alteration of landscape, and devotional sites and artifacts, including visual representation of the Buddhist cosmology, were created. Part II, “Antiquities and National History,” covers the 1830s through the 1970s, when antiquarianism, and eventually archaeology, emerged and developed in the kingdom, partly the result of a shift in the elites’ worldview and partly a response to colonial and neocolonial projects of knowledge. Part III, “Discordant Mnemoscapes,” deals with civic monuments and artworks that anchor memory of twentieth-century political events and provide stages for both their commemoration and counter-commemoration by evoking the country’s embattled political present. Monastery, Monument, Museum shows us how cultural memory represents a kind of palimpsest, the result of multiple inscriptions, reworkings, and manipulations over time. The book will be a rewarding read for historians, art historians, anthropologists, and Buddhism scholars working on Thailand and Southeast Asia generally, as well as for academic and general readers with an interest in memory and material culture. http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-9828-9780824866068.aspx\n\nPublished in: OST Science Review (January 2019), pp. 16-26..

Here I would like to brieﬂy describe the Smithsonian’s resources for the study of Thailand – especially the Thai ethnographic or “ethnology” collections, which include about 2,000 Thai royal gifts to the USA. I am honored to have been the curator of that collection since I ﬁrst joined the Smithsonian in 1981. I hope also to convey here, to the readers of this newsletter, that there are many opportunities for students and other individuals to ﬁnd out more about Smithsonian resources on Thailand’s heritage, and even to become directly involved in the Smithsonian’s programs for research and study of this topic through fellowships, internships, and in other ways. ================================================================== Special issue of this widely distributed Embassy Newsletter, on STEAM education - that is, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) plus the Arts."
