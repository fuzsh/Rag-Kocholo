        "text": "When it comes to the Wat Debsirin, many Thais think of a temple with the country's only permanent royal crematorium. Only a few know that the temple was named after the mother of King Rama V. Even fewer know that Thailand's first Lord Buddha Museum was recently opened in its compound.\n\nAn animation of the Lord Budda leaving this world.\n\nStepping into a yellow European-style building that once served as Chao Phraya Noraratana Ratchamanit School, you will learn about the life and teachings of the Lord Buddha through multimedia, computer graphics and animation. The presentation was mainly created via the use of the images of the four sacred Buddhist sites in Nepal and India where the Lord Buddha was born, became enlightened, delivered his first sermon and left this world.\n\nUpon arrival at the entrance on the first floor, you will see video — both live and animated — and hear audio presentations portraying the life of Prince Siddhartha, the former name of the Buddha, from his birth to the beginning of his priesthood.\n\nEntering the second room is like wandering in the forest where Prince Siddhartha meditated under the Sri Maha Bodhi, the sacred fig tree in Bodh Gaya, India. You will experience the simulated phenomena believed to be faced by the Lord Buddha when he became enlightened.\n\nAnimation of the Lord Budda attaining enlightenment under the Sri Maha Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya.\n\nStrolling further, you will feel like you are following the Lord Buddha as he travelled to Isipatana Marugatayawan, the deer park in the Indian city of Varanasi, where he delivered his first teaching — Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, about the four noble truths — to his first five disciples. The animation and images of the forest in the past and present are shown on the walls of this room, which has been decorated to look like a jungle.\n\nThe next room portrays the time when the Lord Buddha was about to pass away in the Indian town of Kushinagar. You will hear his last words, which warned all against carelessness. The reclining Buddha statue in this room represents his death.\n\nWalking down to the ground floor, you will enter the Royal Biographies Room, where photos of King Rama IV, Queen Debsirindra, their son King Rama V and copies of announcements and religious objects related to the establishment of Wat Debsirin are displayed.\n\nThe Lord Buddha Museum at Wat Debsirin.\n\nKing Rama V established Wat Debsirin in 1876 on his 25th birthday in memory of Queen Debsirindra. In the royal announcement that declared it a royal temple, King Rama V announced his intention to establish Wat Debsirin to express his gratitude to his mother and make merit on her behalf. Queen Debsirindra was born Mom Chao Ramphoei Siriwongse on July 17, 1834, and became the second queen of King Rama IV. She passed away aged 28.\n\nThe next room is a small-scale recreation of the Wat Debsirin's ordination hall. A light and sound show will tell you about the history of the principal Buddha statue as well as other statues, including Phra Nirantarai, Phra Chiang Saen Sian Prong, the Buddha statue in a \"stopping the ocean\" posture, which represents Queen Debsirindra, and the Buddha statue in a \"stopping the quarrel of relatives\" posture, which represents Princess Chao Fah Chandramonthon Sobhon Bhakhawadee, King Rama V's late younger sister. The gold lacquer doors, windows, walls and ceiling of the room resemble those of the ordination hall. The art on the ceiling depict five royal decorations. On the walls are paintings of the flowers of the Ramphoei (yellow oleander) plant (Ramphoei is the queen's maiden name).\n\nThe last room, called the Phra Sri Maha Bodhi Tree Room, showcases models of the temple's zones for the Buddha statues and monks, a replica of the young Phra Sri Maha Bodhi tree brought from Bodh Gaya and a model of two buildings containing the remains of the temple's former abbots. You will see old religious objects, such as documents and preaching fans belonging to former abbots and the revered Phra Phraya Noraratana Ratchamanit, or Chao Khun Nor, the royal page of King Rama VI who entered the monkhood after the king's passing. After departing the museum, you should not miss the opportunity to see the ordination hall, the Sri Maha Bodhi tree, and other structures, including the Chaturon-anussaree and Bhanurangsi-anussorn pavilions and the pavilion enshrining the statue of Chaokhun Nor.\n\nTravel info"
