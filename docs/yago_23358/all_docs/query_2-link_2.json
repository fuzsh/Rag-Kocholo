In Siam, a lady’s hair was often likened to an open lotus flower. Somdet Phra Debsirindra Boroma Rajini (17 July 1834—9 September 1861) was the second consort of King Mongkut (Rama IV), and mother of the future King Chulalongkorn (Rama V). Of ethnic Mon descent, Mom Chao Rampoei was born to Prince Siriwongse and Lady Noi. Rampoei married King Mongkut in 1853, at which time her status was raised to a Phra Ong Chao (i.e. Princess). In the same year she gave birth to Prince Chulalongkorn. She later became Queen Rampoei and had another three children with King Mongkut."
