        "text": "The Making of Fashionable Modern Women: Official Portraits of Queen Saovabha Phongsri from the 1890s to 1910\n\nThe period from the last decade of the 19th century to the early 20th century presents a fruitful field for tracking the formation of modern female gender identity in Siam. Following his father’s path, King Chulalongkorn commissioned several Thai and foreign photographers to capture visual images of his family.21 Additionally, many photographs were sent to Europe as models for paintings shortly before and during the king’s first official visit to Europe in 1897.22 At present, the catalogue of royal portraits published by the Bureau of the Royal Household (BRH) in 1993 is still the most elaborate volume for [End Page 55] studying the commissions of King Chulalongkorn.23 Unfortunately, most of the portraits are still undated and the identity of the artists are mostly unknown. An exception to this are the ones painted during King Chulalongkorn’s European visit in 1897, including a family portrait and a portrait of Queen Saovabha, which will be discussed shortly.\n\nOn the related subject of the reconstruction of female gender identity in the early modern period of Thailand, one of the significant movements was the refashioning of female court dress. Following his second coronation on 16 November 1873,24 King Chulalongkorn restructured many court customs, including court uniform and court dress for men and women, to meet his Western aspirations. Women were required to wear a long skirt with pleated folds at the front, together with an embroidered shawl for formal occasions and when in audience with the king. They were also directed to wear stockings and shoes. As for the ‘infamous’ chong kraben, the women in the royal court were instructed to wear it as a daily dress, with a long-sleeved shirt, together with a sabai, also worn with stockings and shoes.25 Cropped hair for both men and women had also been gradually falling out of favour since King Chulalongkorn first visited the Straits Settlements in 1871.26 This reform of courtly garments strongly indicates that the king had power over the queens’ wardrobe. Female gender identity was still largely dictated by men during the first decade of King Chulalongkorn’s reign. One such example of the reformed female court dress is depicted in Queen Saovabha’s portrait at the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall in the Grand Palace, Bangkok (Figure 2).\n\nThis full-length portrait is part of the set of the Chakri kings and queens’ state portraits believed to have been created between 1896 and 1897 by an unnamed European painter.27 Considering that Queen Saovabha’s appearance in this portrait is much younger than her other visual images of the same year (to be discussed shortly), it is most likely that the painting was rendered after her earlier official photograph. The queen appears in the elaborate traditional court dress, consisting of a long-sleeved blouse covered by an embroidered shawl, a long skirt with pleated folds at the front and a pair of Western-style court shoes. The bare shoulders and feet of the queen, as seen in the earlier photograph of Queen Debsirindra, were no longer exposed to the public gaze in this image. Additionally, the queen wore a new hairstyle that was longer than the traditional cropped hair, yet was still relatively short and very much like the male hairstyle. The location of the portrait is also significant, as the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall was ceremonially opened in 1882, the centennial anniversary of the Chakri Dynasty. It was also King Chulalongkorn’s first throne hall, built following his second coronation, after [End Page 56] which he resumed his full regal authority. The left and right wing of this Siamese-European-style throne hall form the galleries for the royal portraits, where guests could admire these works of art while waiting for an audience with the king.\n\nSimilar to her predecessors, as the queen consort of Siam, Queen Saovabha was ranked as the queen because of her birthright or patrilineal descent (as a daughter of King Mongkut), as well as her bearing a son. Queen Saovabha was one among King Chulalongkorn’s 152 consorts, all of whom came from old and powerful political dynasties, from both royalty and the nobility. For Siamese royal and noble men, possessing a large number of wives and children signified masculinity and a capacity for leadership, known in Thai as barami, (merit, virtue, prestige).28 Feminist studies mostly view the woman as a sign of political and economic exchange in marriage, as well as its object. Thus marriage as an exchange system signifies social order, namely socio-sexual relationships and power.29 In the case of King Chulalongkorn, marrying women from powerful families who were also members of his [End Page 57] reformed government, could guarantee political support from their peers. Therefore, polygamy in Siam was closely associated with political power and alliances. Women’s role in the royal court could thus be interpreted as a reflection of male dominance within the realm of matrimony and the superior gender role of men in the family and the political regime. Hegemonic masculinity in the Siamese royal court further affects the royal consorts concerning their ability to produce male offspring; if royal consorts born with a regal rank (i.e. princess) gave birth to a male child, they would thus be elevated to the highest rank of royal consort and the child would consequently be designated as an heir apparent. However, it should be noted that during the last decades of the 19th century, high-ranking consorts also actively contributed to activities outside their marriage and in political exchange, such as the country’s social development (nursing schools, infrastructure, education for boys and girls etc.).\n\nIn 1893, Queen Saovabha was appointed the President of the Most Illustrious Order of Chula Chom Klao for female members. This was a crucial moment in the sartorial manifestation of her female body by her own agency. According to the memoirs of Queen Saovabha’s lady-in-waiting, following this designation, the Queen created four styles of female costumes suitable for certain occasions or activities, namely: traditional casual dress, modern casual dress, formal or court dress, and formal dress for the Order of Chula Chom Klao.30 Concerning the subject of female agency in the court of King Chulalongkorn, Leslie Woodhouse gives us invaluable examples of the role of female elites, particularly of Erb Bunnag, a royal consort, in representing palace women’s images through photography. Woodhouse argues that the enthusiasm for portraiture shown by these female elites—and not only by their male superiors—also reflects a crucial movement in Siam’s cultural and political history.31 Just as this demonstrated royal women’s contribution to the modernisation/Westernisation of Siam, oil painting portraits of the Siamese queen examined here were a tool that recreated Siamese palace women’s distinct gender identity, fashionability and femininity.\n\nQueen Saovabha’s state portraits produced in 189732 often show her in this new style of court dress. One example is a full-length portrait by Michele Gordigiani (Figure 3), commissioned by King Chulalongkorn when he visited Italy. In this portrait painting, the queen appears to be at the same age as she was at the time of painting, unlike the other portrait in the Chakri Throne Hall, mentioned earlier. Nonetheless, the painting process was very much the same: an original photograph was presented to the artist, along with the Queen’s clothing, which was sent to the artist’s studio at the request of Gordigiani.33 [End Page 58]\n\nFormal attire was worn during the reception of foreign dignitaries and at royal ceremonies. Queen Saovabha made reference to the traditional style of female court dress as seen in her state portrait at the Chakri Throne Hall. However, with the influx of Western fashion at the royal court, in this painting the Queen instead wears a fashionable silk bodice with puffed or ‘leg-o’mutton’ sleeves (without a corset), rather than the old-style long-sleeved shirt. This new article of clothing indicates Queen Saovabha’s fashionability, which is au fait with 1890s Western fashion, especially with the ‘leg-o’mutton’ sleeves introduced in the mid-1890s.34 The overblown sleeves, which were tight at the lower arm and puffed out at the upper arm, aim to accentuate a tiny (corseted) waist, together with a flared full skirt, thus creating an hourglass silhouette—perceived as an ideal feminine form—on the wearer’s body.35\n\nFor the Siamese, the ideal feminine form of the hourglass silhouette was never precisely cited in any sort of documentation. Visual images of Siamese women in the late 19th century do not show tiny corseted waists, thus it is [End Page 59] doubtful that Siamese women wore corsets underneath to achieve the hour-glass silhouette effect. Literature from earlier decades provides a contrasting image of the Siamese idea of female beauty. Verses that depict the beauty of characters or scenes are called saowaratchani, or bot chom chom, ; these lines declare admiration for a beautiful face and complexion, slender arms and full round breasts on a slim body.36 It was very rare that these verses would dedicate much attention to the beauty of the lower part of the female body—the flared hips, to be specific. It is plausible that such an ideal feminine form in Siamese culture originated from Siamese women’s daily attire, consisting of partially covered breasts and a loose chong kraben that mostly hid the shape of the wearer’s hips. This, together with King Chulalongkorn’s criticism of the conservative nature of Siamese women’s mode of dressing,37 leads one to infer that the Western ideal feminine form hardly appealed to Siamese women. Therefore, when Queen Saovabha wore the fashionable ‘leg-o’mutton’ sleeves bodice, perhaps she did not aim to create the hourglass shape for her body. Rather she probably aspired to Western women’s fashion simply because of its modernity, fashionability and, plausibly, out of her regal duty to appear as a ‘civilised’ Siamese queen.\n\nQueen Saovabha’s traditional long skirt completes the look and is equivalent to a European woman’s day dress or tailored suit, a very fashionable and popular item of clothing during the 1890s. Unlike unisex items such as the chong kraben, this traditional long skirt, known as phra phusa chep or pha nung, , appealed to Westerners’ tastes, as stated in King Chulalongkorn’s letter to the Queen. When he visited Sir Charles Bullen Hugh Mitchell, the Governor of the Straits Settlements, King Chulalongkorn gave a photograph of Queen Saovabha in formal dress to Lady Mitchell (Eliza Weldon), who praised the beauty of the Siamese queen in a phra phusa chep.38 This article of clothing signified both the formality and gentility of Siamese female royalty, and also functioned as ‘camouflage’, to borrow Homi K. Bhabha’s concept of mimicry,39 in order to conform to European sartorial elegance. Bhabha’s conceptualisation, indeed, largely focuses on the interplay between the colonised and coloniser.\n\nThough never politically colonised, Siam was dominated by the colonial power of the West economically and juridically.40 It has thus been argued that Siam was semicolonial. Consequently, there has been an ongoing debate on whether Siam’s conversation on modernisation should be approached using colonial and postcolonial theory.41 Hybridity defines an ambivalent space of cultural identity wherein a negotiation of the unbalanced power is employed.42 Siam’s mimicry was probably a form of either conformation or resistance (or both in equal measure) against the West, while attempting to gain a recognition [End Page 60] of its own hierarchical power within the kingdom and in relation to other nations in Southeast Asia. Here, I propose that by considering the modernisation of non-colonised Siam as a sort of mimicry or colonial ambivalence, Siam’s role can be clarified in colonial networks, particularly by refashioning its cultural identity.\n\nDuring his stay in Florence in the summer of 1897, King Chulalongkorn commissioned another Italian artist, Edoardo Gelli, to paint a family portrait: The Siamese Royal Family (Figure 4a). This family portrait also features Queen Saovabha in her elegant formal wear—an embroidered white faille silk bodice with a phra phusa chep—and holding a luxury folded fan. She also appears in this style in Gordigiani’s portraits. Compared to Gordigiani’s portrait of Queen Saovabha, the exquisite way in which Gelli painted her long skirt is more elaborate; the material looks lighter, smoother and shinier, and the draperies also appear to flow more fluidly than the actual material of the skirt as seen in the photograph. The artist’s alterations also helped to enhance the queen’s femininity in contrast to her husband’s and sons’ military uniforms. Such deliberate alterations from original sources (i.e. photographs) demonstrate that the artist can complicate “performative” aspects of photographic images that are calculatedly concealed yet meaning-fully transparent.43\n\nThe portrait was completed and sent to Siam in 1898, after which it was hung in the reception room of the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall.44 Very much like his father, King Chulalongkorn attempted to appease the West’s sensitivity regarding polygamy by choosing to portray his one nuclear family. This family portrait by Gelli shows King Chulalongkorn and Queen Saovabha sitting among their five children, namely Prince Asdang (Prince of Nakhon Ratchasima), Prince Maha Vajiravudh (the Crown Prince of Siam, later King Vajiravudh), Prince Chakrabongse (Prince of Phitsanulok), Prince Chudadhuj (Prince of Phetchabun) and Prince Prajadhipok (Prince of Sukhothai, later King Prajadhipok). The painting is based on a studio photograph (from Robert Lenz’s studio in Bangkok) taken one year earlier (Figure 4b). This may indicate that the king had already planned before his departure to have his family portrait painted while in Europe. Another indication of this is that in the photograph, Prince Chirapravati and Prince Sommatiwongse (King Chulalongkorn’s sons by his other consorts) were asked to pose in place of their half-brothers, Prince Vajiravudh and Prince Chakrabongse, who were studying in England at that time.\n\nThe emphasis on family values is certainly made manifest here. Apinan Poshyananda states that the composition of this family portrait reflects the contrasts between public and private facets, between the formality and [End Page 61]\n\n[End Page 62]\n\nintimacy of the royal family.45 Such value placed on appearance of family life was widely thought to be a key feature of Victorian morality. As an institution,46 the Victorian family was idealised as a centre of stability and functioned as a preparation for the public sphere (i.e. society).47 This idealisation is diligently embodied in the large picture of Queen Victoria’s family by Franz Xaver Winterhalter titled The Royal Family in 1846 (Figure 5).48 The portrait features Queen Victoria with her husband Prince Albert, the Prince Consort and their children: Victoria, Princess Royal; Albert Edward, Prince of Wales; Princess Alice; Prince Alfred; and Princess Helena.\n\nConceivably, the official relationship between Siam and Britain since the mid-19th century—most notably ratified by the Bowring Treaty of 1855—may have prompted the Siamese royal court to develop an awareness of Victorian family ideals. Considering that King Chulalongkorn had commissioned a large number of portraits for his family and constantly wrote letters back home during his travels, his domestic role was as active as his political role as a monarch. King Chulalongkorn perhaps would have also wanted to [End Page 63] introduce the morality of family values to Siamese society, with himself as a role model. Hence, this portrait of King Chulalongkorn’s family very probably reflects influence from British society, regardless of the artist having been Italian. It should also be noted that the king sent many of his sons, including the two princes mentioned above, as well as young Siamese nobles, to study in England. This connection plausibly facilitated the Victorian cultural appropriation by the Siamese royal court.\n\nThese portraits of royal families from opposite sides of the world skilfully depict the official and domestic roles of the monarchs. Although the emphasis on domestic harmony is clear, references to royal status (through the setting, furniture, garments and royal decorations) and the continuation of the royal lineage are also at play. Even though these two royal portraits share many similarities, the overall effects are different. In The British Royal Family in 1846, the bright and brilliant colouring emanates an air of peaceful and happy domesticity. By contrast, the dark and sombre shades of The Siamese Royal Family renders an austere and detached atmosphere. The royal couple’s posture also plays a crucial part here: Queen Victoria and Prince Albert are depicted sitting slightly facing each other, their hands almost touching, whereas King Chulalongkorn and Queen Saovabha were more reserved in their affections, and are depicted sitting far apart. An intimate family moment, captured exceptionally in the British royal family portrait, is not present in the portrait of the Siamese royal family.\n\nNonetheless, the female figures in both pictures demonstrate femininity and a maternal role. Queen Victoria’s compassionate posture is different from the usual demure formality of Victorian femininity often shown in portraiture.49 Similarly, Queen Saovabha’s relaxed sitting position is in contrast to her other portraits and certainly differs from Queen Debsirindra’s when posing with King Mongkut in Figure 1. Also, despite being a studio photograph in its original form, in Gelli’s portrait, Queen Saovabha seems oblivious to the viewer. Both the queens wear their respective versions of evening dress or formal gowns, with sets of jewels, and this helps to enhance their appearance of femininity. Furthermore, Queen Victoria wears the star of the Garter whereas Queen Saovabha wears the pendant and the star of Chakri. Britain’s Order of the Garter and Siam’s Order of the Royal House of Chakri convey a traditional aspect of the monarchy. Hence, their portrayal displays a clear indication of various roles, namely gender, as well as the domestic and public spheres in which these female aristocrats of their respective nation-states would dutifully play.\n\nAs a whole, Gelli’s work is highly effective in portraying a positive image of the royal family: Queen Saovabha presents her maternity and wifehood, [End Page 64] whereas the depiction of King Chulalongkorn in military uniform suggests his role as a leader of both the domestic and political realms. Additionally, the postures and sartorial display of the adults enhance the formal facet of the Siamese royal family, while the youngest princes, in more casual attire50 and poses, represent a more familial aspect."
