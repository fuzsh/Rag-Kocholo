        "text": "Thai traditional costumes vary by city and the ruler of each historical period. Thai clothes can be classified according to six distinct periods of history; beginning with the 13th century. Previously, traditional Thai clothes were worn daily; however, they are now only worn on auspicious functions such as Thai traditional marriage ceremonies.\n\nSukhothai\n\nSee also: Sukhothai Kingdom\n\nSukhothai clothing style became the fashion in 13-15th century. During the period The city-state of Sukhothai was united other Tai city-states into one kingdom. Sukhothai Men's clothing was a simple full-sleeved top with a long V shape neck and a cloth brace on their shoulders. The loincloth was made of silk with a big metal or golden belt. Women's clothing was a long silk sarong with flowers painted on it. The top normally is a full-sleeved silk cloth. Married women wore one cloth wrapped around the breasts made of silk or other fabric.\n\nAyutthaya\n\nSee also: Traditional Thai clothing and Ayutthaya Kingdom\n\nAyutthaya clothing was the style during the 14-18th centuries. Ayutthaya city was the capital of Thai kingdom for 417 years, the longest period of Thailand that was ruled under one monarch. Many styles clothing followed the period of Ayutthaya but the fashion changed frequently under the influence from various countries who come into contact and trading with the kingdom.\n\nHistorically, both Thai males and females dressed themselves with a loincloth wrap called chong kraben. Men wore their chong kraben to cover the waist to halfway down the thigh, while women covered the waist to well below the knee. Bare chests and bare feet were accepted as part of the Thai formal dress code, and is observed in murals, illustrated manuscripts, and early photographs up to the middle of the 19th century. In the royal court, royalty and nobility men are wearing lomphok, a tall pointed hat, made of white cloth wrapped around a bamboo frame, and Khrui, a light outer garment worn as a gown or robe in certain ceremonial settings. Traditional Thai attire has changed significantly throughout the Rattanakosin period.\n\nThai traditional costumes in Bangkok National Museum\n\nA Burmese depiction of an Ayutthaya king, either depicting Uthumphon or Ekkathat\n\nSiam delegates in Peking in 1761 from the Ten Thousand Nations Coming to Pay Tribute monumental painting\n\nOk-khun Chamnan, a 17th-century Siamese ambassador who visited France and Rome on an embassy in 1688\n\nThe Ayutthayan official Kosa Pan wearing Lomphok and Khrui\n\nKosa Pan wearing lomphok and Khrui, 1686\n\nClaude de Forbin wearing Ayutthayan mandarin dress\n\nThe French ambassador Chevalier de Chaumont presents a letter from Louis XIV to King Narai, 1685\n\nA Siamese official wearing Lomphok and Chong kraben, Lifestyle of Siamese people and Traditional Thai house by Simon de La Loubère\n\nPortrait of Siamese aristocrats from The Portraits of Periodical Offering of Imperial Qing by Xie Sui\n\nThonburi\n\nRattanakosin\n\nSee also: Rattanakosin Kingdom\n\nEarly Rattanakosin\n\nEarly Rattanakosin central Thais dressed as same as Ayutthaya period, however, after the Second Fall of Ayutthaya and repeated Burmese invasions, central Thai women began cutting their hair in a crew-cut short style, which remained the national hairstyle until the 1900s.
