        "text": "Phannarai (Thai: พรรณราย; May 9, 1838 – June 22, 1914), formerly Princess Chae Siriwongse (แฉ่ ศิริวงศ์), was one of the consorts of Mongkut of Siam, fourth King of the Chakri dynasty.\n\nPrincess Chae Siriwongse was a daughter of Prince Siriwongse, the Prince Mattayaphithak (a son of Nangklao) and Lady Kim. Princess Chae and her sister, Princess Ramphoei Siriwongse, became the consorts of King Mongkut in 1851 (Princess Ramphoei later became Queen Debsirindra). When her sister died in 1861, she assumed the position as the senior consort of Mongkut.\n\nAlthough she was not elevated to the rank of queen, she ruled over the court ladies and her position as a queen was observed during various banquets for foreign emissaries. The character of Lady Thiang in The King and I is loosely based on her. Anna Leonowens came to the royal court in 1862 and left in 1867, a period of six years in which she was in charge of Lady Phannarai's children and the other children of King Mongkut.\n\nWith Mongkut, Princess Phannarai bore:\n\nPrincess Kannikakaew, Krom Khun Kattiyakalaya (1855–1882)\n\nPrince Chitchareon, Krom Phraya Narisara Nuvadtivongs (1863–1947)"
