        "text": "Category Archives: Royal Deaths and Illnesses\n\nRoyal Deaths from Malaria\n\ncompiled by Susan Flantzer\n\nMalaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that causes symptoms that include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases, it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, and death.\n\nOf course, without modern medical diagnostic tools, it was impossible to accurately diagnose illnesses and so this does not purport to be a complete list. Until the development of antibiotics and other drugs, it was impossible to successfully treat many infectious diseases. Sir Alexander Fleming, a Scottish biologist, physician, microbiologist, and pharmacologist, developed Penicillin, the world’s first antibiotic in 1928. Antibiotics are only effective against diseases caused by bacteria. They are not effective against diseases caused by viruses.\n\nAll images are from Wikipedia unless otherwise indicated.\n\n********************\n\nHeinrich VI, Holy Roman Emperor\n\nBorn: November 1165 in Nimwegen, Kingdom of the Franks, now in the Netherlands\n\nParents: Friedrich Barbarossa I, Holy Roman Emperor and Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy\n\nMarried: Constance I, Queen of Sicily\n\nDied: September 28, 1197, aged 31, in Messina, Kingdom of Sicily, now in Sicily, Italy\n\nBuried: Palermo Cathedral in Palermo, Kingdom of Sicily, now in Sicily, Italy\n\nWikipedia: Heinrich VI, Holy Roman Emperor\n\nIn the midst of making plans to quell a revolt in his wife’s Kingdom of Sicily, Heinrich fell ill with fever and chills and died of malaria although it was widely believed at the time that he was poisoned.\n\n********************\n\nCharles V, Holy Roman Emperor also Charles I, King of Spain, Charles I, Archduke of Austria, Charles II, Duke of Burgundy\n\nBorn: February 24, 1500 at the Prinsenhof of Ghent in Ghent, Habsburg Netherlands, Holy Roman Empire, now in Ghent, Belgium\n\nParents: Philip (the Handsome) of Habsburg and Joanna, Queen of Castile and Aragon\n\nMarried: Isabella of Portugal in 1526\n\nDied: September 21, 1558, aged 58, at the Monastery of Yuste, Crown of Castile, Spain\n\nBuried: Pantheon of Kings in the Royal Crypt of the Monastery of El Escorial in El Escorial, Spain\n\nWikipedia: Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor\n\nCharles’ vast territories included the Holy Roman Empire, extending from Germany to northern Italy with direct rule over the Austrian hereditary lands and the Burgundian Low Countries, and a unified Spain with its southern Italian kingdoms of Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia and the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Physically exhausted after 40 years of ruling and suffering from severe gout, Charles abdicated in 1555 and retired to the peace of a monastery. Upon Charles’s abdications, the Holy Roman Empire was inherited by his younger brother Ferdinand (Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor) and the Spanish Empire, including the possessions in the Netherlands and Italy, was inherited by his son Philip (King Philip II of Spain). In August 1558, Charles became seriously ill with malaria. After a month of agony, he died holding in his hand the cross that his wife Isabella had been holding when she died.\n\n********************\n\nKing Mongkut of Siam (Thailand)\n\nBorn: October 18, 1804 at Thonburi Palace in Bangkok, Siam, now in Thailand\n\nParents: Buddha Loetla Nabhalai, King of Siam and Sri Suriyendra\n\nMarried: Queen Somanass Waddhanawathy, Queen Debsirindra, Princess Pannarai (had a total of 32 wives and concubines and 82 children)\n\nDied: October 1, 1868, aged 63, at the Grand Palace in Bangkok, Siam, now in Thailand\n\nBuried: His ashes are enshrined in the base of the Buddha statue at Wat Ratchapradit in Bangkok, Thailand\n\nWikipedia: King Mongkut of Siam (Thailand)\n\nMongkut is best known as the fictionalized king in the musical play and film The King and I, the film Anna and the King of Siam and the novel Anna and the King of Siam by Margaret Langdon about Anna Leonowens’ years (1862 to 1867) as the teacher to the children of Mongkut.\n\nMongkut was interested in astronomy and mathematics and developing his skills in astronomical measurement. He invited high-ranking European and Siamese officials to accompany him to Wakor village in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province of Siam where the solar eclipse that was to occur on August 18, 1868 could be best viewed as a total eclipse. During the trip, King Mongkut and his son Prince Chulalongkorn were infected with malaria. Mongkut died six weeks later and was succeeded by his son, who survived malaria.\n\n********************\n\nPrince Henry of Battenberg\n\nBorn: October 5, 1858 in Milan, Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, now in Italy\n\nParents: Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine and Countess Julia Hauke\n\nMarried: Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom in 1885\n\nDied: January 20, 1896, aged 37, aboard the HMS Blonde, near Sierra Leone in Africa\n\nBuried: St. Mildred’s Church in Whippingham, Isle of Wight, England\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Prince Henry of Battenberg\n\nWhen Beatrice and Henry married, they promised to live with Beatrice’s mother Queen Victoria so that Beatrice could remain her full-time confidante and secretary. Henry was often bored by the lack of activity and in an effort to give him more to do, Queen Victoria appointed him Governor of Carisbrooke Castle and Captain-General and Governor of the Isle of Wight in 1889, Lieutenant-Colonel in the Army in 1887, Colonel in 1893, and a member of the Privy Council in 1894. In November 1895, Henry persuaded Queen Victoria to allow him to go to West Africa to fight in the Anglo-Ashanti Wars. Henry arrived in Africa on Christmas Day 1895. By January 10, 1896, Henry was sick with malaria and it was decided to send him back to England. Henry died aboard the ship HMS Blonde off the coast of Sierra Leone on January 20, 1896.\n\n********************\n\nPrince Amedeo of Italy, 3rd Duke of Aosta\n\nBorn: October 21, 1898 in Turin, Kingdom of Italy, now in Italy\n\nParents: Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Italy, Duke of Aosta and Princess Hélène of Orléans\n\nMarried: Princess Anne of Orléans in 1927\n\nDied: March 3, 1942, aged 43, in Nairobi, Kenya Colony, now in Kenya\n\nBuried: Nyeri Italian Military Cemetery in Nyeri, Kenya\n\nWikipedia: Prince Amedeo of Italy, 3rd Duke of Aosta\n\nAmedeo was the commander of the Italian forces in the East African Campaign during World War II. On May 18, 1941, after being surrounded and besieged by British, Commonwealth, and Ethiopian forces, Amedeo surrendered. He was held in a prisoner-of-war camp in Nairobi, Kenya where he died as a result of complications from both tuberculosis and malaria.\n\n********************\n\nRoyal Deaths from Influenza\n\ncompiled by Susan Flantzer\n\nInfluenza, commonly known as “the flu”, is an infectious disease caused by an influenza virus. The most common symptoms include high fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle and joint pain, headache, coughing, and feeling tired. Complications of influenza may include viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, sinus infections, and worsening of previous health problems such as asthma or heart failure. It is usually the complications that cause death. The January 1918 – December 1920 Spanish Flu pandemic death toll is estimated to have been 50 million, and possibly as high as 100 million, making it one of the deadliest epidemics in human history.\n\nOf course, without modern medical diagnostic tools, it was impossible to accurately diagnose illnesses and so this does not purport to be a complete list. Until the development of antibiotics and other drugs, it was impossible to successfully treat many infectious diseases. Sir Alexander Fleming, a Scottish biologist, physician, microbiologist, and pharmacologist, developed Penicillin, the world’s first antibiotic in 1928. Antibiotics are only effective against diseases caused by bacteria. They are not effective against diseases caused by viruses.\n\nAll images are from Wikipedia unless otherwise indicated.\n\n********************\n\nPrincess Sophie of Saxony, Duchess in Bavaria\n\nBorn: March 15, 1845 in Dresden, Kingdom of Saxony, now in Saxony, Germany\n\nParents: King Johann I of Saxony and Princess Amalie Auguste of Bavaria\n\nMarried: Duke Karl-Theodor in Bavaria\n\nDied: March 9, 1867, aged 21, in Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria, now in Bavaria, Germany\n\nBuried: Tegernsee Abbey in Tegernsee, Kingdom of Bavaria, now in Bavaria, Germany\n\nWikipedia: Princess Sophie of Saxony, Duchess in Bavaria\n\nOn December 24, 1865, Sophie gave birth to her only child, Duchess Amalie in Bavaria. The pregnancy and childbirth caused severe respiratory problems for Sophie, which progressively weakened her. In her weakened state, Sophie was unable to overcome a severe case of influenza and died six days before her 22nd birthday.\n\n********************\n\nPrince Baudouin of Belgium\n\nBorn: June 3, 1869, at the Palais de la Régence in Brussels, Belgium\n\nParents: Philippe, Count of Flanders and Marie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen\n\nDied: January 23, 1891, aged 21, at the Palace of the Count of Flanders in Brussels, Belgium\n\nBuried: Church of Our Lady of Laeken in Laeken, Brussels, Belgium\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Prince Baudouin of Belgium\n\nBaudouin’s birth was met with great celebration in the Belgian royal family. Earlier that year, Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant, Baudouin’s nine-year-old cousin and the only son of King Leopold II, had died of pneumonia after falling into a pond. His death left no other male heirs aside from Baudouin’s father so Baudouin was seen as the eventual heir to the Belgian throne.\n\nIn early 1891, Baudouin became ill with influenza that had made its way through most of the members of the Flanders family already. He likely caught the illness from his sister Henriette, whom he insisted on visiting during her illness despite warnings from doctors. At first, he appeared to be weathering the illness better than his sister but then Baudouin’s condition suddenly deteriorated on January 22, 1891. He died early the following morning. Baudouin’s death left his younger brother, the future Albert I, King of the Belgians, as the heir to the Belgian throne. Baudouin, King of the Belgians from 1951 until 1993, was named in honor of his deceased great-uncle.\n\n********************\n\nPrince Erik of Sweden, Duke of Västmanland\n\nBorn: April 20, 1889 at the Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden\n\nParents: King Gustav V of Sweden and Victoria of Baden\n\nDied: September 20, 1918, aged 29, at Drottningholm Palace in Drottningholm, Sweden\n\nBuried: Riddarholm Church in Stockholm, Sweden\n\nWikipedia: Prince Erik of Sweden, Duke of Västmanland\n\nErik had epilepsy and mild intellectual disability and because of his condition, he was seldom seen in public.

(2) The rock formation where his rope was tied broke causing him to fall about sixty feet.\n\n********************\n\nRoyal Deaths from Dysentery\n\ncompiled by Susan Flantzer\n\nThis does not purport to be a complete list. All images are from Wikipedia unless otherwise indicated.\n\nDysentery is a bacterial or parasitic infection. The bacteria or parasites reach the large intestine through the mouth after eating contaminated food, drinking contaminated water, or by oral contact with contaminated objects or hands. Dysentery causes intestinal inflammation leading to excessively frequent and uncontrollable diarrhea. Other symptoms include vomiting, fever and abdominal pain.\n\nAlso called the bloody flux, dysentery was the scourge of armies for centuries. As late as the nineteenth century, it killed more soldiers than did combat. Dysentery decimated Napoleon’s army when he invaded Russia. More than 80,000 Union soldiers died of dysentery during the American Civil War.\n\n********************\n\nHenry the Young King\n\nBorn: February 28, 1155 at Bermondsey Abbey in London, England\n\nParents: King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine\n\nMarried: Marguerite of France in 1160\n\nDied: June 11, 1183, aged 28 at the Castle of Martel in Lot, Viscount of Turenne, now in France\n\nBuried: Rouen Catherdral now in Rouen, France\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Henry the Young King\n\nHenry was the eldest surviving son and heir of King Henry II of England, whose vast empire consisted of an area covering half of France, all of England, and parts of Ireland and Wales. When Henry was 15, his father decided to adopt the French practice of ensuring the succession by declaring his heir the junior king. Henry was crowned at Westminster Abbey on June 14, 1170.\n\nIn 1182–83, Henry had a falling out with his brother Richard (later Richard II) when Richard refused to pay homage to him on the orders of King Henry II. As he was preparing to fight Richard, Henry became ill with dysentery. It was clear that Henry was dying and he repented his sins by prostrating himself naked on the floor before a crucifix. Henry the Young King died holding a ring his father had sent as a sign of his forgiveness.\n\n********************\n\nKing John of England\n\nBorn: December 24, 1166 at Beaumont Palace in Oxford, England\n\nParents: King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine\n\nMarried: (1) Isabella, Countess of Gloucester in 1189, annulled 1199 (2) Isabella, Countess of Angoulême in 1200\n\nDied: October 19, 1216, aged 49, at Newark Castle in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, England\n\nBuried: Worcester Cathedral in Worcester, England\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King John of England\n\nIn the midst of the First Barons’ War, John became ill with dysentery.

After the successful military campaign in which King Henry I of England had defeated King Louis VI of France at the Battle of Brémule, the English were finally preparing to return to England. King Henry I was offered the White Ship for his return to England, but he had already made other arrangements. Instead, Henry suggested that his son William sail on the White Ship along with his retinue which included William’s half-brother Richard of Lincoln, his half-sister Matilda the Countess of Perch, Richard d’Avranches the 2nd Earl of Chester and many of the heirs of the great estates of England and Normandy.\n\nBy the time the ship was ready to set sail, there were about 300 people on board. William and his retinue ordered the captain of the White Ship to overtake the ship of King Henry I so that the White Ship would be the first ship to return to England. Unfortunately, the White Ship hit a submerged rock and capsized. William’s bodyguard quickly got the heir to the throne into the safety of a dinghy. However, William Ætheling heard the screams of his half-sister Matilda and ordered the dinghy to turn back to rescue her. At this point, the White Ship began to sink and the many people in the water desperately sought the safety of William’s dinghy. The chaos and the weight were too much causing William Ætheling’s dinghy to capsize and sink without a trace. The chronicler Orderic Vitalis claimed that only two people survived the shipwreck by clinging to a rock all night.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: The Sinking of the White Ship and How It Affected the English Succession\n\n********************\n\nFriedrich I Barbarossa, Holy Roman Emperor, Duke of Swabia,\n\nBorn: 1122\n\nParents: Friedrich II, Duke of Swabia and Judith of Bavaria\n\nMarried: (1) Adelheid of Vohburg circa 1147, marriage annulled (2) Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy in 1156\n\nDied: June 10, 1190, aged 67 – 68, in the Göksu River near Silifke in present-day Turkey\n\nBuried: body in the Church of St. Peter, now in Turkey in Antioch, bones in the cathedral of Tyre, now in Lebanon, his heart and inner organs in Tarsus, now in Turkey\n\nWikipedia: Friedrich I Barbarossa, Holy Roman Emperor, Duke of Swabia\n\nThe nickname Barbarossa (Italian for red beard) was given to Friedrich because of his red hair and beard. Friedrich drowned in the Saleph River near Silifke Castle in present-day Turkey on his way to the Holy Land to fight in the Third Crusade. The story that is most widely told is that Friedrich was thrown from his horse and the shock of the cold water caused him to have a heart attack and weighed down by his armor, he drowned. However, there are other stories that say he died while attempting to swim across the river, he died while enjoying a refreshing swim or he died on the banks of the river.\n\nAccording to a “king in the mountain” legend, Friedrich Barbarossa is not dead but sleeps in a hidden chamber under the Kyffhäuser Mountains in Germany. There he awaits his country’s hour of greatest need when he will emerge once again from under the mountains.

Diphtheria typically causes a sore throat, fever, swollen glands and weakness but the determining sign is a thick, gray membrane covering the back of the throat. The membrane can block the windpipe so that the patient has to struggle for breath. Today, diphtheria is extremely rare in developed countries thanks to widespread vaccination against the disease. However, before the advent of modern medicine, diphtheria could be epidemic and it often killed its victims.\n\nOf course, without modern medical diagnostic tools, it was impossible to accurately diagnose illnesses and so this does not purport to be a complete list. Until the development of antibiotics and other drugs, it was impossible to successfully treat many infectious diseases. Sir Alexander Fleming, a Scottish biologist, physician, microbiologist, and pharmacologist, developed Penicillin, the world’s first antibiotic in 1928.

The family had already suffered tragedy in 1873 when 2 1/2-year-old hemophiliac Friedrich, known as Frittie, fell and died from a brain hemorrhage. Grand Duke Ludwig and his children Victoria, Irene, Ernst Ludwig, Alix, and Marie all came down with diphtheria. Elisabeth, known as Ella, was the only member of the family to remain unaffected. Grand Duchess Alice quickly slipped into her role as caregiver, nursing her husband and children. Marie, known as May, was the youngest child in her family.

(See above.) Waldemar complained of a sore throat, and unfortunately, he had come down with diphtheria. His mother took all the precautions known at that time to avoid spreading the disease. She washed Waldemar with hot vinegar and water, changed his sheets and clothes, and put them in a pail of carbolic acid. While tending him, Victoria covered her own clothing and sprayed herself with carbolic acid after she left Waldemar’s room. No one else in the family developed diphtheria. Waldemar seemed to be improving but on March 26, 1879, at around 9 PM, the doctors summoned his parents to his room. Waldemar’s breathing had worsened, and he died shortly after midnight.\n\n********************\n\nRoyal Deaths from Cholera\n\ncompiled by Susan Flantzer\n\nCholera is a bacterial infection of the small intestine. The classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea that lasts a few days. Vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur. Diarrhea can be so severe that it leads within hours to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Prevention methods against cholera include improved sanitation and access to clean water. In the past, because of the lack of clean water and proper sanitation, cholera outbreaks and epidemics were frequent. Today, cholera is rare in the developed world.\n\nOf course, without modern medical diagnostic tools, it was impossible to accurately diagnose illnesses and so this does not purport to be a complete list.
