        "text": "Your remaining coursework can be fulfilled in a variety of ways. You can take more courses in Cinema Studies, beyond what is required. You may choose to explore other general education coursework in the College of Arts and Sciences. You may also take elective courses outside of either area in other departments at Tisch, or at the Stern School of Business, the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, or the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education & Human Development.\n\nYou are able to combine your minor and elective coursework to complete a second major in the arts, humanities, or social sciences. Youâ€™ll have the opportunity to declare your double major once you arrive at NYU. Popular double majors include Journalism, Dramatic Literature, and Film & Television."
