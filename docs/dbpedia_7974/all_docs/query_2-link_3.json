        "text": "ANYONE WHO COULD SEE the two shows of photographs by Walker Evans, at the Museum of Modern Art and the Robert Schoelkopf Gallery, was very lucky. Evans is in still photography what Dreyer is in motion pictures, an exemplary artist: which is to say that he realized the possibilities of the medium in which he was working so profoundly and in his production espoused them so closely that, up to a point, his work is of the essence of its medium. I suppose this would amount to saying that in him “the medium is the message,” but the “medium” involves the way in which subjects can or should be treated in and by it; and it is a fact that when people have talked about Evans they have tended to emphasize the latter. For me the interest of his work is finally in the interaction between the two, in the way in which, in terms of time and of existence, the image as both process and subject is held in an equipoise between showing and disappearing.\n\nOf the American photographers who preceded Evans, only two would seem to have done work he could usefully study, Strand and Steiner. Stieglitz was, or at least must have appeared to be, much too arty, Steichen was too commercial, and the others were simply not good enough. We are talking about the late twenties, and it is important to remember how close Stieglitz always stayed to the “artistic photography” of the 1880s and ’90s, for example to the work of Demachy. With so much to react against, and the so much being style, Evans thought in terms of subject, no doubt. He would have had to. But he thought in terms of a subject or subjects to be conveyed by certain means: very simply, he wanted subjects that, to his mind, were appropriate to the medium he was working in. A photograph being what it is, this almost necessarily meant an image whose past and whose future were conveyed only by its implicit repetition; if it was to be more than an isolated image, its isolation had to be a kind of promise of seriality.\n\nIt would seem to have been at about this point in Evans’s thinking that he discovered the two photographers, or more accurately the two bodies of photographic work, that he could use: Eugene Atget and the Civil War photographer, Mathew Brady, and the photographers who worked with him. That Atget was very important for Evans is clear from the very specific images he took from his French predecessor. Almost as soon as he began to study Atget, about 1930, he did the Store Window in Brooklyn, which is simply a local transposition of an image from Atget; and if the wagon he photographed off Somerstown Road, Ossining, is not a recollection of Brady, then nothing is! But what Evans took from them would seem unclear, especially in the case of Atget, and I wonder if in the end the usefulness of both men for him was not rather as a confirmation of ideas he had formulated, more or less firmly, on his own. To take an example, while the idea of repeated individualities—that is to say of duration in photography—is so central in Atget’s work, what Evans seems to have taken instead is an extreme sensitivity to surfaces, that is, a way of presenting an isolated image in all its particularity. In similar fashion, the images he took from Brady and his colleagues emerge in Evans’s work purified of their narrative implications: they are abstracted, almost in the way of compositions.\n\nIn these circumstances, how does Evans give his work a substance that goes beyond that of the excerpt? Certainly, his choice of subject does account for a great deal. I said that Evans had, and under the influence of Atget tried to develop, a sense of texture, but texture need not be of particulars. Joseph Cornell’s collages and even his constructions depend largely on textures, but in his work textures are made to serve a fantasy that erodes the particularity of the motifs so it can reintegrate them, and the surfeited delicacy of Evans’s surfaces is often very similar to Cornell’s. Evans’s textures are like his subjects—generic—and I think that this would have been more readily apparent if his subjects had not been so new. No doubt he perceived the legitimacy of a great many motifs that had not been thought valid or useful in art before, but he saw them as comprising areas of experience. Basically, this is why his images are so repetitive: in a photograph, a moment, and a motif, has to he lifted out of context outside a continuum of time and an ambiance of people and/or things. But it occurred to Evans that if moments complementary to the first one were photographed, a milieu and the duration of its unfolding could be interpolated. When you come down to it this was the way in which Evans broke with the estheticism of fin-de-siècle photography, with photographs that were only motifs in the sense of either objects or sensations: he restored to the medium a narrative dimension.\n\nIt is true that in addition, Evans’s images are not part of developing time: whether they are of tenant farmers in the Depression, antebellum plantations, faces in the subway or New England bedrooms, they are images of times that have developed; and being, as they are, outside the current of the present, they lend themselves not only to being excerpted as single images but to being used to reconstruct a world. I mean that the edges of that world appear as known, located, defined, since, being done with, its nature is complete: even in the single image a global definition is implicit. But it is important to remember also that Evans records these images through a technique that is intentionally and appropriately archaic, using only those possibilities of his medium which seem inherent in its nature; he avoids super-fast shutters, peephole lenses directed from odd angles, elaborate lighting. The techniques he uses, in other words, are the techniques he thinks will remain. The result is to give the image, even without the support of an implicitly serial repetition, a density and depth that are at opposite poles from what newsmagazine photographers were doing in the ’30s, since the technical means have a secular quality to them, a duration that goes far beyond the instantaneous. I once suggested that Atget followed a similar approach, looking back in his technique to Nègre and others of that time. Now I’m not so sure, but that Evans has worked in this way seems very clear.\n\nThese are just a few notes on a very complex artistic production, and while I prefer to think that they are not random, they are certainly very incomplete; because, as I began by suggesting, Evans’s work involves what photography as a whole is about."
