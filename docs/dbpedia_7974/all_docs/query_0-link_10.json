        "text": "IU Libraries Moving Image Archive is one of the world’s largest and most comprehensive educational film and video collections.\n\nWith more than 130,000 items spanning nearly 80 years of media production, the Archive is a member of the distinguished International Federation of Film Archives, the world’s leading association for film preservation.\n\nWe believe preparing for the future means first understanding the past. In classrooms and conferences, through consults and conservation, we proudly offer you a front row seat to history.\n\nTo provide a welcoming access point for the collection, which is stored off-site at Indiana University's Ruth Lilly Auxiliary Library Facility, the Archive’s space on the ground floor of the Herman B Wells Library offers state-of-the-art individual and small group screening facilities and a work room for media conservation. The IU Libraries Screening Room offers high-quality film and video projection with the flexibility of an open floor space for use by seminar classes and high-profile symposia. These areas allow the Moving Image Archive to strengthen active partnerships with local, national, and international scholars, as well as encourage the use of rare, one-of-a-kind films in an environment designed to exhibit such treasures.\n\nThe Moving Image Archive is open by appointment only on Monday through Friday from 8:30 am to 5 pm. The exception is on holidays when the Wells Library is closed. To schedule an appointment or to talk to our experts, email iulmia @ indiana . edu or call 812-856-7086."
