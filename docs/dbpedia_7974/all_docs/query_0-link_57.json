Learn how women continue to lead in these roles in stewardship and conservation of America's natural and cultural treasures today.\n\nImage credit: Image designed by the National Park Service\n\nThe Women of Five Wars\n\nThe limited but important roles women played in Korea and Vietnam paved the path to more expanded -- and in some cases more dangerous -- specialties in recent wars.\n\nImage credit: Fort Wayne News Sentinel image of Mary Weiss Hester of the 801st Medical Air Evacuation Squadron caring for a wounded patient onboard a C-47 Skytrain. January 1953. (Library of Congress)\n\nWomen They Talk About: Documenting Early Women Filmmakers with the American Film Institute—Teachers Guide\n\nWomen actively participated in shaping the nascent film industry of the early twentieth century, both as screen stars and behind the camera.
