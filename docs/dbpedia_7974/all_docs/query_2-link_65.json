        "text": "Built for today’s archival research\n\nTake control of your research photos with Tropy, a tool that shortens the path from finding archival sources to writing about them. Spend more time using your research photos, and less time hunting for them.\n\nTurn photos into items\n\nTropy thinks the way you do: like a researcher. Say goodbye to IMG_5261.JPG and IMG_5262.JPG, and say hello to your sources.\n\nDescribe your sources\n\nTropy helps you contextualize artifacts and their photos by capturing your own subject expertise. A friendly editing interface allows customized templates that fit your research like a glove.\n\nOrganize your research\n\nTropy understands that every researcher is different and that every project has its own demands. Break free from the logic of the physical archive and use tags and lists to organize your research items according to your needs.\n\nAnnotate your photos\n\nTropy’s beautiful annotation tools allow you to transcribe documents, select image details, and manipulate photographs to get the clearest view of your sources.\n\nAbout Tropy\n\nTropy is an independent, open-source project designed and produced by an international team of historians and software developers.\n\nOriginally created at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (RRCHNM), Tropy today is jointly developed by RRCHNM, the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History (C²DH), and Digital Scholar, the nonprofit corporation which operates allied projects Zotero, Omeka, and Sourcery. Tropy is generously funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Tropy benefits from the support of its enthusiastic users, who supply essential feedback, feature requests, issue reports, workshops, and interface translations. All Tropy code is open source and freely available on GitHub."
