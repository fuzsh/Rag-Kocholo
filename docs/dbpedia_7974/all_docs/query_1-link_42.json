Many film genres have existed since the earliest years of cinema: the action film, biopic, melodrama, and social problem film, to name only a handful (see early cinema; silent cinema); while others are newer: the chick flick, extreme cinema, machinima, for example. Some genres are international, or nearly so: these include the fantasy film, the musical, pornography, science fiction; while others are closely associated with particular national cinemas: chanchada, peplum film, blaxploitation, Heimat film.\n\nIn film studies, the study of genre—often termed genre criticism —divides into two main aspects: firstly, work on individual film genres (historical treatises on the Hollywood western, for example); and secondly, general theoretical inquiry into genre as a system of expectations and conventions that circulate between film industry, film texts, and filmgoers. The second area of study is undeveloped by comparison with the first, which until the 1990s was largely dominated by attention to popular genres in Hollywood cinema."
