        "text": "For over a century, the studios represented by the Motion Picture Association, Inc. (“MPA”) have employed innovative new technologies to tell compelling stories to audiences here in the U.S. and around the globe. From the introduction of recorded sound in the 1920s and color in the 1930s, to the dazzling special effects of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Avatar, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, the MPA’s members have long used technology to allow filmmakers to bring their vision to the screen in the most compelling way possible.\n\nArtificial intelligence is the latest technological innovation that has captured the attention of the world. Advancements in AI will likely lead to dramatic advancements in myriad industries from medicine to motion pictures. But with these developments also come significant concerns about potential misuses, including to create non-consensual pornographic deepfakes or spread disinformation about elections or national security matters, or otherwise deceive the public. MPA sees great promise in AI as a way to enhance the filmmaking process and provide an even more compelling experience for audiences. But we also share the concerns of actors and recording artists about how AI can facilitate the unauthorized replication of their likenesses and voices to supplant performances by them, which could potentially undermine their ability to earn a living practicing their craft.\n\nFor over a century, the studios represented by the Motion Picture Association, Inc.
