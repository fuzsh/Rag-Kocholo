        "text": "Visual research is a process of information discovery where the desired outcome is image-based instead of text-based. This is a part of both written and design work.\n\nImages and video appear easy to find and access, with huge amounts available through online platforms such as YouTube or Pinterest. Using media sourced from platforms like these remains complicated and centres around questions of transparency, trust and context.\n\nThe Library can provide you with access to a wide range of image and audiovisual resources, useful for the process of visual research, providing you with inspiration and ideas to inform your work."
