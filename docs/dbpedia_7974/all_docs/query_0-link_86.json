        "text": "I'm Richard Brody,\n\nand I'm a film critic at The New Yorker.\n\nThese are the movies that should've been nominated\n\nfor Best Picture at this year's Oscars.\n\n2022 was a terrific year for movies,\n\nbut you wouldn't know it\n\njudging from the 10 nominees for the Oscar for Best Picture.\n\nIn the wake of the pandemic,\n\nmovie viewership has not returned, except for blockbusters.\n\nAnd to compensate, the membership of the Academy\n\nhas nominated several blockbusters,\n\nseveral of the major commercial hits of the year,\n\namong the Best Picture nominees.\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water is the Club Med\n\nof futuristic thrillers.\n\nJames Cameron obviously relished\n\nthe technical challenges of filming aquatically,\n\nbut the problem is that his aesthetic of water\n\nseems borrowed from shopping mall gift shops of the 1980s.\n\nUnfortunately, for the most part,\n\nthe other films that were nominated\n\naren't among the year's best either,\n\nconsensus art-house films such as Tar\n\nor Triangle of Sadness, Stephen Spielberg's film\n\nof adolescent self-love, The Fabelmans.\n\nSpielberg is at least telling a story he knows well.\n\nIt's the story of his childhood and adolescence\n\nin his family and in the beginnings of his relationship\n\nwith the movies.\n\nHe tells this story with vigor, with verve, with passion.\n\nAnd at the same time,\n\nit's not so much a work of autobiography\n\nas of autohagiography.\n\nHe's clearly very much in love with his younger self.\n\nAnd I kind of hate being negative\n\nabout everything like this.\n\nI prefer dwelling, you know,\n\non the, you know, movies I liked.\n\nAll right.\n\nYeah, I think I have an idea.\n\nOne of the reasons why my list\n\nof the 10 best films of the year is so drastically different\n\nfrom the Academy's list is that I didn't at all\n\ntake into consideration the box office success\n\nor failure of any of these films.\n\nMy feeling is that there's already an award\n\nfor movies that sell a lot of tickets.\n\nIt's called money.\n\nThe one real shock I had upon seeing the Oscar nominations\n\nis that one really great film\n\nthat was also a big commercial success,\n\nnamely, Jordan Peele's Nope, was completely ignored.\n\nNope is, of course, the story of a black family\n\nof horse farmers who provide horses to Hollywood,\n\nbut they also have a long history\n\nwith Hollywood and with movie-making.\n\nIt's also a story of exclusion and erasure.\n\nI can't help but feel that in repudiating Nope,\n\nthe Academy is also repudiating\n\nwhat the movie is telling Hollywood about itself.\n\nI think that the reason why critics\n\nand the Academy spurned Amsterdam\n\nis the wild disparity of its elements,\n\nits blend of comedy and drama.\n\nIt's simultaneously a subtle, complex,\n\nand actually very moving love story\n\nand an almost cartoonish political thriller,\n\nbecause ultimately, it's a stark warning\n\non the subject of what American fascists look like,\n\nbig pictures that should be very easy to recognize.\n\n[upbeat jazz music]\n\nThe Cathedral is exactly the kind\n\nof ultra-low-budget independent film\n\nthat the Oscars never pay attention to.\n\nIt's directed by Ricky D'Ambrose, a New York-based director,\n\nwho is telling, on a very small scale,\n\na very large-scale story,\n\nthe intellectual autobiography of an artist.\n\nIt's very much a sharply discerning family story\n\nabout the young filmmaker's parents' divorce\n\nas well as about his burgeoning aesthetic sensibility.\n\nIt's exactly the kind of movie\n\nthat The Fabelmans could and should have been.\n\nThe Iranian director Jafar Panahi,\n\nwho was arrested on political charges in 2010,\n\nhas been living under terrible pressure since then,\n\nwith a suspended prison sentence\n\nas well as a ban on filmmaking, public appearances,\n\nand international travel.\n\nHe nonetheless has been making films clandestinely.\n\nIn his new film, No Bears,\n\nclandestine filmmaking is the very subject\n\nand ultimately turns into a vortex of oppression\n\nthat makes manifest almost like a cinematic x-ray,\n\nthe structure of religious and traditional\n\nand political repression to which he\n\nand the country are subject.\n\n[upbeat jazz music] [movie titles whooshing]\n\nThe best films of 2022 look candidly\n\nat the filmmakers' own lives, at the places and times\n\nin which the filmmakers are living and working,\n\nand also confront the historical and political forces\n\nthat are secretly at work all around them.\n\nBy contrast, most of the movies nominated for Oscars\n\nthis year, even when they address history,\n\nturn their back on it.\n\nFor instance, Top Gun: Maverick\n\ndoesn't even dare name the enemy.\n\nBut it doesn't really matter.\n\nI'm still gonna watch the Oscars, and it's always a pleasure\n\nto watch the broadcast, whatever its quality may be\n\nand whatever the quality of the movies\n\nthat get awards may be,\n\nbecause ultimately, when it comes to the movies themselves,\n\nit's the long judgment of history that matters.\n\n[jazz music continues]"
