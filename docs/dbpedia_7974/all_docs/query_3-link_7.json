        "text": "by Nathaniel R\n\nOnce Upon a Time ... in Hollywood was difficult to write about. That's what happens with dense movies. Naturally, then, my review left out something major. It was only after publishing it that I realized I hadn't even mentioned the extended scene that is the movie's most impressive on a filmmaking level. I'm talking about the significant detour when Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) visits Spahn's Movie Ranch. He used to shoot a TV show there a decade earlier but it's now Manson Family territory, thanks to the retired and now blind George Spahn (Bruce Dern)...\n\nSpahn is paid for his hospitality with sexual services from Squeaky Fromme (Dakota Fanning, in a blisteringly hostile performance). When Booth arrives he refuses to leave without seeing the old man, to check if he's okay since the \"family\" feels a little \"off\" to the stuntman. This stubborn suspicious demand makes him instantly unwelcome. You fear at any moment that the screen might erupt with violence.\n\nThe amount of tension and suspense Tarantino conjures in this sequence, with a ton of moving parts within a single location, but not much happening narratively beyond waiting by a door is something only masters can do. But, in truth, it almost felt like it belonged to a separate movie. A more straightforward true story thriller experience than the one Tarantino otherwise delivered.\n\nWhich raises an interesting question that I hope you'll answer in the comments. Which scenes, like this one did for me, have made you imagine a whole different or companion movie off to the side of the one you've actually seen? Did you long to be in that other movie instead or did it just make the one you watched feel richer?\n\nBad Times at El Royale was so much less than the sum of its parts. There were at least three other movies in there, screaming to get out. The opening sequence created the impression of a mystery movie surrounding a single room and, perhaps, a variety of people looking for access to it and jockeying for it. Bizarrely, that was NOT the movie.\n\nThen, the discovery of the secret passages in the hotel was a WHOLE 'NOTHER THING and yet, virtually none of that movie was shared with us. Imagine a movie built around the dark secrets discovered in those passages!\n\nI am a lifelong fan of Legally Blonde and I have watched it dozens of times and will continue to do so for the rest of my life, but also as an adult I have realized to my dismay that it is \"bad.\" Also as an adult I have become fascinated by the bend and snap. An actual staged / choreographed musical/dance number in the middle of an otherwise non-musical movie! It's also not a dream / revery / hallucination! It's just in there! I am delighted with its status as an odd tonal/genre detour, no desire to see a full movie of bend and snap musical scenes, NOR a filmed version of the broadway musical.\n\nI appreciate the question, but I didn't think the Spahn's Ranch sequence broke with the tone of the rest of Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood. In this film, Tarantino shows a new maturity in his creation of suspense, right from the first appearance of the Manson 'Girls' as they come along the street. I felt that the Manson stuff in the film was all played serious (except for the tonally offbeat climax, which nevertheless worked) and I felt that this added to the sense that the film is respecting Sharon Tate (the real Sharon Tate) by not cheapening her memory. These serious moments, when juxtaposed with the comedy of Rick and Cliff in other scenes, create something of a rounded portrait: Hollywood 1969 as a rather ego-driven place, filmed with affection, but also a menacing one, filmed with care.\n\nI did, however, think that the Spahn's Ranch sequence was an example of a film having an almost self-contained sequence, a kind of mini film within the main film. In that respect, it reminded me of the La Louisiane sequence in Inglourious Basterds."
