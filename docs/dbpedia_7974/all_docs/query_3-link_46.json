        "text": "Can I get copies of these posters from NASA or JPL?\n\nThe images are free for you to print. Please consult the JPL Image Use Policy for further details.\n\nIs it okay for me to print them out myself and display them?\n\nDownload the full size posters above so that you can print them and hang on your walls and share with us on Facebook or Twitter.\n\nDo you have other sizes that you havenâ€™t posted, or can you make new ones in a different size?\n\nThe current sizes on the website are what are currently available, which are 20 x 30 inches.\n\nBackground:\n\nA creative team of visual strategists at JPL, known as \"The Studio,\" created the poster series, which is titled \"Visions of the Future.\" Nine artists, designers, and illustrators were involved in designing the 14 posters, which are the result of many brainstorming sessions with JPL scientists, engineers, and expert communicators. Each poster went through a number of concepts and revisions, and each was made better with feedback from the JPL experts.\n\nDavid Delgado, creative strategy:\n\nThe posters began as a series about exoplanets -- planets orbiting other stars -- to celebrate NASA's study of them. (The NASA program that focuses on finding and studying exoplanets is managed by JPL.) Later, the director of JPL was on vacation at the Grand Canyon with his wife, and they saw a similarly styled poster that reminded them of the exoplanet posters. They suggested it might be wonderful to give a similar treatment to the amazing destinations in our solar system that JPL is currently exploring as part of NASA. And they were right!\n\nThe point was to share a sense of things on the edge of possibility that are closely tied to the work our people are doing today. The JPL director has called our people \"architects of the future.\"\n\nAs for the style, we gravitated to the style of the old posters the WPA created for the national parks. There's a nostalgia for that era that just feels good.\n\nJoby Harris, illustrator:\n\nThe old WPA posters did a really great job delivering a feeling about a far-off destination. They were created at a time when color photography was not very advanced, in order to capture the beauty of the national parks from a human perspective. These posters show places in our solar system (and beyond) that likewise haven't been photographed on a human scale yet -- or in the case of the exoplanets might never be, at least not for a long time. It seemed a perfect way to help people imagine these strange, new worlds.\n\nDelgado:\n\nThe WPA poster style is beloved, and other artists have embraced it before us. Our unique take was to take one specific thing about the place and focus on the science of it. We chose exoplanets that had really interesting, strange qualities, and everything about the poster was designed to amplify the concept. The same model guided us for the posters that focus on destinations in the solar system.\n\nLois Kim, typography:\n\nWe worked hard to get the typography right, since that was a very distinctive element in creating the character of those old posters. We wanted to create a retro-future feel, so we didn't adhere exactly to the period styles, but they definitely informed the design. The Venus poster has a very curvy, flowy font, for example, to evoke a sense of the clouds."
