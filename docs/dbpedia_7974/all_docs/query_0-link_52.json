        "text": "Federal law requires a permit for all commercial filming, no matter the size of the crew or the type of equipment. This includes individuals or small groups that don’t use much equipment, but generate revenue by posting footage on websites, such as YouTube and TikTok. The primary focus of the NPS, however, is on commercial filming that has the potential to impact park resources and visitors beyond what occurs from normal visitor use of park areas. Examples of this type of filming are productions that use substantial equipment such as sets and lighting, productions with crews that exceed 5 people, and filming in closed areas, wilderness areas, or in locations that would create conflicts with other visitors or harm sensitive resources.\n\nAll filmers, no matter the size, must comply with all rules that apply in park areas, just like other visitors.\n\nIndividual parks may require a permit for non-commercial filming if necessary to manage the activity, to protect park resources and values, to preserve wilderness character, to minimize conflict between user groups, or to ensure public safety. Examples of non-commercial filming include, but are not limited to, filming for tourism bureaus, convention and visitor bureaus, and student filming. If you have questions about whether a non-commercial film project requires a permit, please contact the park where you intend to film in advance.\n\nIn most cases, a permit is not necessary for casual filming for personal enjoyment.\n\nIn most cases, still photography does not require a permit. A permit is required for still photography only when:\n\nthe activity takes place in an area closed to the public; or\n\nthe activity uses a model, set, or prop; or\n\nthe National Park Service would incur additional administrative costs to monitor the activity.\n\nA “model” means a person or object that serves as the subject for still photography for the purpose of promoting the sale or use of a product or service. Models include, but are not limited to, individuals, animals, or inanimate objects, such as vehicles, boats, articles of clothing, and food and beverage products. Portrait subjects, such as wedding parties and high school graduates, are not considered models, if the image will not be used to promote or sell a product or service.\n\nPermit applications are available through each park's administrative office or website. Contact information for parks can be found on their websites; Find a park where you would like to film or take photographs. If you believe that your filming or photography activity may require a permit, you should submit a completed application to the park where you want to film or photograph as far in advance of your planned date as possible.\n\nSome parks may require that you provide advance notice a certain amount of days before filming or photography begins. In addition, you should request a meeting with park staff if your proposed activity is unusual or complex. Early consultation with park staff will help them process the submitted application in a timely manner.\n\nFederal law requires the National Park Service to recover its administrative costs for commercial filming and still photography activities that require a permit. Cost recovery includes an application fee and any additional charges to cover the costs incurred by the National Park Service in processing your request and monitoring the permitted activities. This amount will vary depending on the park and the size and complexity of the permitted activities. The application fee must be submitted with your application.\n\nIn addition, Federal law also requires the National Park Service to collect a location fee that provides a fair return to the United States for the use of park lands for commercial filming and for still photography requires a permit. The National Park Service uses the following fee schedules for filming and photography:\n\nCommercial Filming\n\n1–2 people, camera & tripod only - $0/day\n\n1–10 people - $150/day\n\n11–30 people - $250/day\n\n31–49 people - $500/day\n\nOver 50 people - $750/day\n\nStill Photography\n\n1–10 people - $50/day\n\n11–30 people - $150/day\n\nOver 30 people - $250/day\n\nPermits issued for non-commercial filming may be subject to cost recovery charges, including an application fee, but a separate location fee will not be charged.\n\nFilming and photography permits will contain terms and conditions that are necessary to protect park resources and visitors. They will specify the location and time of the activity and the number of personnel and equipment that may be used. The permits also may require you to obtain liability insurance naming the United States as additionally insured in an amount commensurate with the risk posed to park resources by your proposed activity. You also may be required to post a bond to ensure the payment of all charges and fees and the restoration of the area if necessary."
