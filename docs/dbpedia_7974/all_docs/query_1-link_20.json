        "text": "What is Genre? A genre is a category of literature, music, or any other form of art characterised by a particular style, form, or content. In simple words, the genre is a way to classify any form of art into more or less similar kinds of categories.\n\nThe concept of the genre actually began during the Hollywood studio period i.e. from the 1920s. The film has been one of the most popular forms of expression for over a century. The film genre is the simplest way to categorise different styles, stories, and content. Genres in films not only help the filmmakers to identify the film and make decisions accordingly but also makes it easier for the audience to understand the style and basic plot of the film. As a lot of people only watch selective films of some specific style they like, categorising films into genres helps the audience to find a film according to their likes and dislikes that they would be interested in watching. Nowadays we also see a variety of genres while browsing through different OTT platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ Hotstar, which gives us a rough idea about the basic storyline of the film.\n\nThe genre basically consists of four elements: Story, Plot, Character, and Setting. You can easily classify a film into different genres by identifying these elements of that particular film.\n\nSo, we can simply say that genre categorises films!\n\nMost Common Genres\n\nThere exist numerous genres of films, some of the most popular genres include:\n\nAction, Comedy, Horror, Romance, Drama, Thriller, Science Fiction (Sci-fi), Fantasy, Western, etc.\n\nWe will discuss in detail these genres and their sub-genres along with prominent directors and some good examples of International and Indian films of each genre further in the blog.\n\nSome other genres and subgenres are Animation, Crime/Mystery, Musical, Adventure, War, Spy, Historical/Epic, Sport, Documentary, etc. Although films based on only these genres are very rare, these genres act as a second genre in a Hybrid genre film and play a vital role in the plot of a film.\n\nLet us now talk about some of the above-mentioned genres of films…\n\nAction\n\nAction movies have been around since the early rise of cinema. Edwin S. Porter’s The Great Train Robbery (1903) is considered to be the first action film. Films in this genre usually involve a lot of action scenes including violence (fighting or shoot-outs), car chases, and often lots of explosions. Previously, action films were associated with more masculine themes and male-dominant audiences. A significant amount of action movies focused on thrillers, crime, adventure, and war.\n\nMust Watch: Mission: Impossible (1996), Die Hard (1988), Terminator (1984), The Matrix (1999), Apocalypse Now (1979), American Sniper (2014), Drunken Master (1978), Enter the Dragon (1973) are some of the greatest action films of all time.\n\nSub-genres of the action film genre includes:\n\nWar and military action, disaster films, martial arts, and other fighting films, spy films, superhero films, etc.\n\nProminent directors who have contributed greatly towards action genre films:\n\nJames Cameron (Terminator films (Part 1 & 2), Aliens, True Lies)\n\nAndrew Davis (Code of Silence, Above the Law, Under Siege, The Fugitive)\n\nJohn Woo (Hard Target, Broken Arrow, and Face/Off)\n\nJohn McTiernan (Die Hard films (Part 1 & 3), Predator, The Last Action Hero)\n\nRidley Scott (Black Rain, Black Hawk Down)\n\nThe Wachowskis (The Matrix trilogy)\n\nSome Indian action films:\n\nSiddharth Anand’s War (2019), Sujeeth’s Saaho (2019), Ali Abbas Zafar’s Sultan(2016), Aditya Dhar’s URI: The Surgical Strike (2019), J. P. Dutta’s Border (1997), Nikkhil Advani’s Chandni Chowk to China (2009).\n\nComedy\n\nComedy is yet another genre that has been enjoyed by the audience since the beginning of the cinema; these films are loved by mostly everyone, regardless of their age. The comedy began as short-length films where the characters were put in different situations in which they were seen dealing with them in a funny, humorous way. The main motive of a comedy genre film is to make the audience laugh. Comedy can be found in most movies, but if the majority of the film is intended to be a comedy it could be placed in this genre.\n\nDuring the silent film era, a lot of comedy films were made. Louis Lumière’s L'Arroseur Arrosé (The Sprinkler Sprinkled)(1895) is considered to be the first comedy film ever made. Then, in the 1920s and 30s, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and other actors became famous for their funny roles. Comedy films today are viral worldwide and can be found on various TV channels.\n\nSub-genres of the comedy film genre includes:\n\nSlapstick Comedy, Satire, Screwball Comedy, Parody Comedy, Black/Dark Comedy, Situational comedy (Sit-com), Action comedy, Romantic comedy (Rom-com), etc.\n\nProminent directors who have contributed greatly towards comedy genre films:\n\nJay Roach (Austin Powers film series, Meet The Parents, Mystery,Alaska, Borat, Meet the Fockers)\n\nAdam McKay (The Big Short, Vice, Anchorman film series, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers)\n\nTom Shadyac (Ace Ventura, Liar Liar, Bruce Almighty)\n\nTodd Phillips (The Hangover trilogy, Road Trip)\n\nPeter Farrelly (Dumb and Dumber, Ther’s Something about Mary, Fever pitch)\n\nWoody Allen (Annie Hall, Take the money and run, Sleeper, Love and Death)\n\nSome Indian comedy films:\n\nAnees Bazmee’s Welcome (2007), Neeraj Vora’s Phir Hera Pheri (2006), Indra Kumar’s Dhamaal (2007), Rohit Shetty’s Golmaal: Fun Unlimited (2006), Priyadarshan’s Chup Chup Ke (2006).\n\nHorror\n\nThe main motive of a horror film is to scare the audience and experience fear. The Plot of horror movies often features a monster, some type of evil force, or a frightening situation.Horror films have been made since the beginning of the cinema; Georges Méliès House of the Devil (1896) is considered to be the first horror film ever made.\n\nAlthough horror genre films didn't become that popular until the 1950s (when Universal Studios released their Dracula, Frankenstein, and Mummy movies), a few silent films like Frankenstein (1910), Dante’s Inferno (1911), The Student of Prague (1913) and Sacrifice (1918) did manage to become popular.\n\nMust Watch: The Haunting (1999), The Exorcist (1973), Hereditary (2018), The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), The Thing (1982), Paranormal Activity (2007), The Silence of the Lambs (1991), Alien (1979), The Conjuring (2013) are some of the best-known horror films to date.\n\nSub-genres includes:\n\nFolk Horror, Body horror, Comedy horror, Slasher horror, Psychological horror, Zombie Horror, etc.\n\nProminent directors of the genre:\n\nWes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street film series, Scream film series, Wes Craven's New Nightmare, The Last House on the Left, The Hills Have Eyes)\n\nJames Wan (The Conjuring film series, Insidious film series, Saw, Dead Silence, Malignant)\n\nPark Chan-Wook (Oldboy, The Handmaiden, Stoker, Thirst, Three... Extremes)\n\nRob Zombie (Halloween, House of 1000 Corpses, The Devil's Rejects, 3 From Hell, The Lords of Salem)\n\nSome Indian Horror films:\n\nVikram Bhatt’s Raaz (2002), Priyadarshan’s Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007), Vikram Bhatt’s 1920 (2008), Vikram Bhatt’s Shaapit (2010), Prosit Roy’s Pari (2018), Amar Kaushik’s Stree (2018).\n\nRomance\n\nThe Romance genre is pretty self-explanatory; it can be defined as a film genre in which Romance is an important aspect. Romance genre films are love stories that focus on the romantic involvement of the main characters and the development of their relationship. These types of films usually center around two protagonists exploring some of the elements of love like relationships, sacrifice, marriage, or obsession. Romance movies sometimes feature hardships like illness, tragedy, or other obstacles for the love interests to overcome. Romance is seen in almost every other film; though the story or the plot wouldn’t be revolving fully towards romance, there are high chances of being a romantic touch in every film.\n\nThe Romance genre was born out of the Classical Hollywood era i.e. the 1930s-1950s. The romantic comedy film, also called \"rom-com\", became very popular.\n\nMust Watch:Titanic (1997), Pretty Woman (1980), Silver Linings Playbook (2012), The Notebook (2004), A Walk To Remember (2002), Casablanca (1942), Gone with the Wind (1939).\n\nSub-genres include:\n\nHistorical Romance, Romantic Drama, Romantic Comedy (Rom-com), Chick Flick, Paranormal Romance, etc.\n\nProminent directors of the genre:\n\nRob Reiner (When Harry Met Sally, The Princess Bride, Flipped, The American President, And So It Goes, Rumor Has It)\n\nWoody Allen (Manhattan, Annie Hall, Midnight in Paris, A Rainy Day in New York, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Match Point, Scoop)\n\nGarry Marshall (The Princess Diaries Film series, Pretty Woman, Runaway Bride, Valentine's Day, The Flamingo Kid)\n\nNick Cassavetes (The Notebook, The Other Woman, Unhook the Stars)\n\nRichard Linklater (The Before Trilogy, Me and Orson Welles)\n\nSome Indian Romance films:\n\nAditya Chopra’s Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Karan Johar’s Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Imtiaz Ali’s Jab We Met (2007), Mohit Suri’s Aashiqui 2 (2013), Ayan Mukerji’s Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013), Abhishek Verman’s 2 States (2014), Imtiaz Ali’s Tamasha (2015), Sandeep Patel’s Love Ni Bhavai (2017), Nagraj Manjule’s Sairat (2016).\n\nDrama\n\nThe drama was one of the earliest genres of films, and it’s still a popular genre today. These films often include stories with settings or life situations that portray realistic characters in conflict with either themselves, others, or forces of nature. Charles Tait, Millard Johnson, and W.A. Gibson’s The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906) is considered to be one of the earliest drama films.\n\nWhereas comedy genre films entertain the audience by making them laugh, Drama films entertain the audience by telling interesting stories. A drama film sometimes has a narrative, narrating a story throughout the movie or in the major part of the film. The main focus is on the protagonist dealing with different complications going on in their life. If any movie’s elements are serious, emotional, and focus on the protagonist dealing with different situations; it can be considered as a Drama.\n\nSub-genres include:\n\nDrama is a very broad genre and the subgenres of it often overlap; some of the subgenres are, Crime Drama, Melodrama, Teen Drama, Dark Drama, Comedy Drama, Historical Drama, Docudrama, etc.\n\nProminent directors of the genre:\n\nSpike Lee (Malcolm X, Do the Right Thing, 25th Hour, Jungle Fever, Da 5 Bloods, He Got Game, Son of the South)\n\nMartin Scorsese (Goodfellas, The Irishman, The Wolf of Wall Street, Taxi Driver, Silence, Raging Bull)\n\nDavid Fincher (Fight Club, Seven, Mank, The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button)\n\nJoe Wright (Pride & Prejudice, Atonement, Darkest Hour, The Soloist)\n\nSome Indian Drama films:\n\nAnurag Kashyap’s Dev.D (2009), Krishna D.K.’s Shor in the City (2010), Dibakar Banerjee’s Shanghai (2012), Yash Chopra’s Silsila (1981), Shimit Amin’s Rocket Singh (2009), Aditya Chopra’s Mohabbatein (2000).\n\nThriller\n\nA 'Thriller' is a film genre that keeps people on the edge of their seats.

It generally makes them feel tense, nervous, or excited during the suspenseful moments of the story and not knowing what's going to happen further. The Thriller film genre emerged in Hollywood in the 1920s. Film adaptations of old detective stories were very popular at that time.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) took the thriller film genre to next level. Its influence is notable even in today's modern-day thriller films. Later on, Hitchcock released more thriller films that were well received by the audience and then went on to release Family Plot (1976) which became his final film in the thriller genre.

Many filmmakers like aspects of one genre as well as characteristics of another but don't want to limit their film to one genre and hence blends in two or more genres together. Most of the films in today's generation are hybrid genre movies; Just think of any of your favourite films from the new age cinema and there is a high chance of it being a hybrid film.\n\nA good example of a hybrid film could be James Mangold’s Logan (2017) which shows a superhero character, action plot, sci-fi story in a western setting. Some other examples could be Noam Murro’s 300: Rise of an Empire(2014), Paul Feig’s A Simple Favour (2018), Robert Benigni’s Life Is Beautiful (1997).\n\nGenres that have received the most number of Oscar Awards\n\nSince the Academy Awards (Oscars) started in the year 1929, many films and filmmakers have received awards and recognition for their contribution to the Film Industry. There are many different categories of awards in the Oscars but when it comes to the ‘Best Picture’ category, the Drama genre is far ahead of any other film genre in terms of nominations and winnings. In the past, more than 90 years of Oscars; most of the films winning the Best Picture award were Drama genre films followed by Romance, Comedy, War, History, Crime, etc.\n\nNo Science Fiction (Sci-fi), Animation, or Superhero film has ever won an Oscar for Best Picture yet, although there have been a few nominations. Fantasy, Horror, Western, Musical, and Mystery are some of the few film genres that have won the least number of Academy Awards for Best Picture.\n\nAnd that was it! As we've seen, with a wide variety of genres, films offer us different emotions, different stories and different characters to fall in love with. A look into these very foundations help us not only watch different kinds of films but also varied approached to filmmaking."
