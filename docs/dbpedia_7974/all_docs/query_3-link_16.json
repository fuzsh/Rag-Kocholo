        "text": "Although it isn’t common to make an APA movie citation in your research paper, there are times when you may need to do so. For example, you may need to create an APA film citation for a documentary about people who suffer from depression or anxiety you used in your psychology research. Therefore, it’s essential to learn how to cite a movie or documentary in APA for your reference page and in-text citations.\n\nHow to Cite a Movie APA 7th Edition\n\nWhen it comes to citing a movie in APA 7 style, you need to find a few different elements like the director, title, year, and studio. Additionally, you include the label ‘film’ in brackets. The basic format for citing a movie in APA format is:\n\nDirector, A. A. (Director). (Year). Title of motion picture [Film]. Studio.\n\nAPA Movie Citation Examples\n\nTalbot, J. (Director). (2019). The last black man in San Francisco [Film]. Plan B Entertainment & Longshot Features.\n\nBratt, P. (Director). (2017). Dolores [Film].5 Stick Films.\n\nWang, W. (Director). (2005). Because of Winn-Dixie [Film]. 20th Century Fox.\n\nNote: Use this format for DVD/Blu-Ray movie citations. This is different from the APA 6 edition.\n\nWhere to Find APA Film Citation Source Information\n\nJust in case you were wondering, finding the information for a movie citation isn’t too hard. You can find it on the DVD or Blu-Ray packaging, the movie credits, or you can look it up on IMDb.\n\nHow to Cite a Documentary in APA\n\nWhile you might cite a major motion picture, it’s more likely that you’ll find yourself creating an APA film citation for a documentary. To cite a documentary in APA, you need the director, title, year, and studio or URL.\n\nDirector, D. D. (Director). (Year). Documentary title [Film]. Producer or URL\n\nHow To Cite a Movie APA – Documentary\n\nLivingston, J. (Director). (1990). Paris is burning [Film]. Art Matters Inc.; BBC Television.\n\nAPA Film Citation From Netflix and Other Streaming Services\n\nIf the movie is from a media subscription like Netflix or Amazon, the format for the citation is very similar to other films but with a URL.\n\nDirector, D. D. (Director). (Year). Title of video [Film]. http://www.xxxxxxxx\n\nAPA Streaming Movie Citation Examples\n\nOlivares, G. (Director). (2017). The lighthouse of the orcas (El faro de las orcas) [Film]. https://www.netflix.com/title/80105690\n\nLuna, D. (Director). (2014). Cesar Chavez [Film]. https://www.amazon.com/Cesar-Chavez-Michael-Pe%C3%B1a/\n\nAPA Film Citation for YouTube\n\nSince many movies, documentaries, and other video content are now streamed online on YouTube, it’s helpful to know how to cite these sources correctly too. To do so, you should include the URL where the video can be found. Additionally, do not place a period after the URL.\n\nAuthor or User Name. (Date). Title of video [Video]. Site Name. URL\n\nYouTube Citation Example\n\nGrjngo. (2019, November 12). Quintana: Dead or alive [Video]. YouTube. https://youtube/8b07uR8AClI\n\nHow to Cite a Movie APA In-Text\n\nTo cite a movie in-text or parenthetically, use the director’s name and year released within parentheses. Just remember every in-text citation should correspond to an entry in the references list.\n\nHow to Cite a Movie APA In-Text Examples\n\nNote: Incorporating movie sources is an excellent way to highlight ways people are stereotyped, and discuss personality disorders, depression, racism, abandonment, and many other topics relevant to APA subjects.\n\nIn-Text Citation APA Movie Multiple Producers\n\nThe 7th edition of APA formatting removed the use of producers in the in-text and reference citations. Since movies generally only have one main director, you typically won’t come across in-text citations that have multiple directors listed. Therefore, you can follow the format for a typical movie citation.\n\nHow to Cite a Movie in APA Perfectly"
