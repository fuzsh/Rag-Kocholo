        "text": "Before colour could be reproduced, the nature of light—and how we perceive colour—had to be clearly understood.\n\nThe scientific investigation of colour began in the 17th century. In 1666, Sir Isaac Newton split sunlight with a prism to show that it was actually a combination of the seven colours of the spectrum.\n\nNearly 200 years later, in 1861, a young Scottish physicist, James Clerk Maxwell, conducted an experiment to show that all colours can be made by an appropriate mixture of red, green and blue light.\n\nMaxwell made three lantern slides of a tartan ribbon through red, green and blue filters. Using three separate magic lanterns—each equipped with a filter of the same colour the images had been made with—he then projected them onto a screen. When the three images were superimposed together on the screen, they combined to make a full-colour image which was a recognisable reproduction of the original.\n\nThe Joly process\n\nInstead of making three separate exposures through red, green and blue filters, a simpler approach was to make just one exposure through a filter that combined all three primary colours.\n\nThe first process to use this method was devised by Dr John Joly of Dublin in 1894. Joly covered a glass plate with very fine red, green and blue lines (less than 0.1mm wide) in order to create a three-coloured filter screen.\n\nWhen taking a photograph, this screen was placed in the camera in front of the plate. After exposure and reversal processing, the black-and-white positive image was carefully placed in register with another filter screen. The result was a colour transparency which could be viewed by transmitted light (light that passes through an object).\n\nThe Joly process was introduced commercially in 1895 and remained on the market for a few years. However, the limited colour sensitivity of the plates meant the results were not very successful.\n\nHow were autochromes made?\n\nManufacturing autochrome plates was a complex process. First, pulverised starch grains were passed through a sieve to isolate individual grains between 10–15 microns in diameter. Many different types of starch were tried, but potato starch gave the best results. These microscopic grains were then dyed red, green and blue-violet, mixed and spread over a glass plate, and coated with a sticky varnish.\n\nNext, charcoal powder was spread over the plate to fill any gaps between the coloured starch grains. A roller, using a pressure of five tons per square centimetre, was used to flatten out and spread the grains. The plate was then varnished to make it waterproof.\n\nThe final plate was a three-coloured filter screen: there were around four million transparent starch grains on every square inch of it, each grain effectively acting as a coloured filter. The final stage was to coat the plate with a panchromatic emulsion.\n\nHow did autochromes work?\n\nAutochrome plates were simple to use. They required no special apparatus and photographers were able to use their existing cameras. Exposure times, however, were long—about 30 times those of conventional plates. Even in bright sunshine, an exposure of at least one second was needed, and in cloudy weather this could be increased to 10 seconds or more. Even in a well-lit studio, portraits could require an exposure of as long as 30 seconds.\n\nFollowing exposure, autochrome plates were reversal-processed to produce a positive image. When viewed by transmitted light passing through the plate, the millions of tiny red, green and blue-violet grains combined to give a full-colour photograph, accurately reproducing the colours of the original subject.\n\nIn theory, the grains were mixed and distributed randomly on the surface of the plate. In practice, however, mathematical probability meant some grouping of grains of the same colour was inevitable. While individual grains are invisible to the naked eye, these groups of clumps are visible; they are the reason for the autochrome’s distinctive beauty and for comparisons with the work of Impressionist and Pointillist painters.\n\nHow popular was the autochrome?\n\nBy 1913, the Lumière factory in Lyon was producing 6,000 autochrome plates every day.\n\nThe commercial success of the process prompted the appearance of many other colour processes based on the concept of screens made up of microscopic colour filters. These screens used either a random grain pattern or, more commonly, different geometric patterns of lines and squares.\n\nMany of the photographic processes introduced to the market at this point in history are now long forgotten. However, one remained popular for years: the Dufaycolor process devised by French inventor Louis Dufay.\n\nDufaycolor first appeared in 1932 as a 16mm cine film, followed in 1935 by a roll film version. It employed a geometric screen made up of red lines alternating with rows of green and blue rectangles. Colour reproduction was good, and it was comparatively fast—although only one-third of the speed of contemporaneous black-and-white film.\n\nWhereas autochromes appealed to keen photographers who liked to do their own processing, Dufaycolor was aimed at the everyday ‘snapshot’ market. A processing service which returned finished transparencies, mounted and ready for viewing, opened up colour photography to a whole new class of photographers.\n\nDufaycolor, the last of the screen processes, remained on the market up to the 1950s.\n\nAs outlined above, most early colour photography processes were ‘additive’—they relied on the principle of adding together red, green and blue light.\n\nHowever, there is an alternative method of reproducing colour photographically: ‘subtractive’ colour synthesis.\n\nWhat were the drawbacks of additive colour?\n\nAdditive colour processes had several disadvantages:\n\nThey relied on the use of filters, which block out light\n\nThis resulted in long exposure times and very dense transparencies\n\nThe colour photographs made using these processes could only be viewed by transmitted light—i.e. by projection or by using special viewing devices\n\nWhat is subtractive colour reproduction?\n\nThe original theory for subtractive colour reproduction can be traced back to the French physicist and inventor Louis Ducos du Hauron, who explained the method in his book Les couleurs en photographie, solution du problème (1869). Du Hauron proposed that colour separation negatives should be used to produce three positive images, which would then be dyed the complementary colours of cyan (bluegreen), magenta (blue-red) and yellow.\n\nEach of these complementary colours absorbs—or subtracts (hence the name)—one of the primary colours. Cyan absorbs red light, reflecting a mixture of blue and green light. A cyan image, therefore, performs the same function as the red filter used in an additive process. Similarly, magenta absorbs green light and yellow absorbs blue light. By accurately superimposing these three complementary colours, all other colours can be reproduced. The colour in subtractive processes comes from dyes or pigments rather than coloured filters.\n\nWith subtractive colour, white, for example, is represented by clear glass or white paper rather than by light passing through three filters. This means that subtractive processes are much less wasteful of light.\n\nMore importantly, they work with reflected rather than transmitted light, meaning they can be used to produce colour photographs on paper.\n\nHow did subtractive colour processes work?\n\nThe development of subtractive colour processes followed two distinct paths. Firstly, the design of specialised cameras—for taking sets of colour separation negatives—and secondly, the search for practical methods of making and superimposing three positive images in the complementary colours.\n\nWhen taking colour separation negatives of stationary subjects—e.g. a vase of flowers—a conventional camera could be used. The colour filter simply needed to be changed after each exposure. This procedure could be made simpler through the use of a ‘repeating back’, a moving part of the camera which allowed filters of different colours to drop into place.\n\nA number of devices of this sort were marketed. The simplest type were long plateholders, fitted with three filters, which the photographer would manually slide along the camera back in three steps. The most complex were fitted with clockwork motors, enabling three negatives to be exposed in rapid succession in as little as two or three seconds.\n\nWhen photographing subjects where movement was likely to occur—such as portraits—even automatic repeating backs were not fast enough. For these, a camera that could expose all three negatives simultaneously was needed.\n\nOver the years, many designs for such ‘one-shot’ cameras were patented, and a number were produced commercially. These used various arrangements of mirrors and prisms to split the light entering the camera into three separate beams, each of which went to a plateholder fitted with a different coloured filter. Among the most successful designs were the Jos-Pe, Bermpohl, Klein and Mirkut cameras.\n\nDuring the 1930s, commercial colour photography became increasingly important. For professional colour printing, at this time, one process reigned supreme: Vivex.\n\nInvented in 1928 by Dr Douglas A. Spencer, who later went on to become Managing Director of Kodak, Vivex was a modification of the Trichrome Carbro process in which sheets of cellophane were used as temporary supports for the pigment images. Any minor problems with the image could be corrected manually by stretching or squeezing the cellophane to ensure perfect superimposition.\n\nTo exploit the Vivex process, a company called Colour Photographs (British & Foreign) Ltd. was formed with a factory in Willesden, north London. This was the first laboratory to offer a colour print making service to professional photographers.\n\nSuch was the popularity of the Vivex process that it has been estimated that over 90% of all the colour prints made in Britain in the 1930s were produced using it.\n\nThe late 1920s was a time of great technological change in the western world: as well as photography, new inventions such as the gramophone, radio and cinema were rapidly growing in popularity. As a result, there was a frenzy of investment in companies promoting new innovations.\n\nOne such company was the London-based Colour Snapshots Ltd., established in 1928 to promote a tripack photographic process called Colorsnap. It was set up with massive financial backing and invested heavily in promoting its competitively priced products.\n\nHowever, despite extravagant claims, the results were disappointing. The negatives from the second and third emulsion layers were so blurry that the company was reduced to hand-colour black-and-white prints made from the sharpest (front) element of the tripack. Unsurprisingly, Colour Snapshots Ltd went bankrupt in December 1929.\n\nThe Colorsnap process suffered from the same problem inherent to all tripack systems. Light was scattered and diffused as it passed through the various layers of emulsion, so one or more of the resulting negatives were blurred. Definition was too poor to allow much enlargement; tripack negatives were usually only recommended for contact printing.\n\nKodachrome was the invention of Leopold Mannes and Leopold Godowsky. Both earned their living as professional musicians (Mannes played the piano and Godowsky the violin) while spending their spare time experimenting with colour photography. Despite their best efforts, there came a point when they were unable to progress without outside support.\n\nThis support was to come from Dr C.E. Kenneth Mees, director of the Eastman Kodak research laboratories in Rochester, New York. In 1922, Mees met with Mannes and Godowsky and, impressed with the quality of their work, agreed to supply them with the materials they needed to continue their research. At this point, they were working on a two-colour subtractive system for colour photography but, after reading about Fischer’s work with colour couplers, they decided to abandon their previous methods and concentrate on developing a three-colour multi-layer film system.\n\nIn 1931, the two Leopolds gave up their musical careers to work full-time in the Kodak research laboratories where, with the help of Eastman Kodak’s enormous resources, they made rapid progress."
