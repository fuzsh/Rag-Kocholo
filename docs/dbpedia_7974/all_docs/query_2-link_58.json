        "text": "This property should not be confused with the IPTC property Headline, which is a brief synopsis or summary of the contents of the image. This property is required for conformance with the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).\n\nIt may help to show a warning on the editing interface when 250 characters are exceeded.\n\nThis is a detail of a location with blurred semantics as it does not clearly indicate whether it is the location in the image or the location the photo was taken - which can be different. Two more concise properties are available in IPTC Extension with Location Created and Location Shown in the Image.\n\nCopyright ownership can be expressed in a more controlled way using the PLUS fields \"Copyright Owner\", \"Copyright Owner ID\", \"Copyright Owner Name\" of the IPTC Extension. It is the user’s responsibility to keep the values of the four fields in sync.\n\nThis is a detail of a location with blurred semantics as it does not clearly indicate whether it is the location in the image or the location the photo was taken - which can be different. Two more concise properties are available in IPTC Extension with Location Created and Location Shown in the Image.\n\nThis is a detail of a location with blurred semantics as it does not clearly indicate whether it is the location in the image or the location the photo was taken - which can be different. Two more concise properties are available in IPTC Extension with Location Created and Location Shown in the Image.\n\nNote 1: an implementer would have to derive from the length of the value string whether this is the country code from the two or three letter scheme as no explicit indication can be provided.\n\nThe creator can be expressed in a more controlled way using the \"Image Creator\" of PLUS in the IPTC Extension additionally. It is the user’s responsibility to keep the values of the IPTC Core and the PLUS fields in sync.\n\nThe IPTC Extension Licensor fields should be used instead of these Creator’s Contact Info fields if you are using IPTC Extension fields. If the creator is also the licensor his or her contact information should be provided in the Licensor fields.\n\nNote 1: For more formal identifications of the creator or the owner of the copyrights of this image other rights properties may be used. Note 2: This property was named \"Credit\" by the IIM metadata, then it was renamed to \"Provider\" in IPTC Core 1.0. In IPTC Core 1.1. it has been renamed to \"Credit Line\" as the field is used for this purpose by many users.\n\nNote 1: If a software system requires explicit time values and no time is given by the Date Created property the software system should default the time to 00:00:00. If the software system does not require an explicit time value the time part should be left empty as it is.\n\nNote 2: Software showing the metadata user interface should adopt a widget for this property that supports editing truncated dates, like year and month only, or year only. Software embedding truncated dates as IIM DataSet 2:55 should use the value \"00\" for undefined days or months (like \"19180000\" for an image taken \"in the year 1918\")\n\nNote 1: Any content of the IIM datasets 2:55, Date Created, and 2:60, Time Created, should be merged to this element.\n\nNote 2: Implementers are encouraged to show the values of the Exif tags DateTimeOriginal (36867, 0x9003) + OffsetTimeOriginal(36881,0x9011) of a digital camera to the user for entering this date for the first time.\n\nMultiple description writers can be given. May have to be separated by a comma in the user interface.\n\nThis property should not be confused with the IPTC property Description/Caption, which is the who, what, when, where, why, how of an image. This property can be combined with Alt Text (Accessibility) if and when a brief description is not sufficient to convey the purpose and meaning of an image. It should not repeat the information in the Alt Text (Accessibility) property. It is required for conformance with the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).\n\nExtended Description (Accessibility) is designed to be used in conjunction with Alt Text (Accessibility) therefore both properties should be available on the editing interface.\n\nThe Instructions may include any of the following: embargoes (NewsMagazines OUT) and other restrictions not covered by the \"Rights Usage Terms\" field; information regarding the original means of capture (scanning notes, colourspace info) or other specific text information that the user may need for accurate reproduction; additional permissions required when publishing; credits for publishing if they exceed the IIM length of the credit field\n\nNote on \"legacy\": the Intellectual Genre can be expressed in a more controlled way using the \"Genre\" property of the IPTC Extension, IPTC recommends using it.\n\nApplies to IIM only: the genre code MUST be prefixed with the four characters 000: as value of the dataset 2:04 (Attribute Reference). The 64-byte limit applies to the code only. Example: the typed in IPTC genre code Actuality must be 000:Actuality as IIM value.\n\nNote: As this identifier references a job of the receiver’s workflow it must first be issued by the receiver, then transmitted to the creator or provider of the news object and finally added by the creator to this field.\n\nNote 1: Single values of this field should not be restricted to single words but must allow for phrases as well.\n\nThis is a detail of a location with blurred semantics as it does not clearly indicate whether it is the location in the image or the location the photo was taken - which can be different. Two more concise properties are available in IPTC Extension with Location Created and Location Shown in the Image.\n\nRights and licensing related properties of the IPTC Extension can be used in parallel to express the licensed usage in more controlled terms.\n\nNote on \"legacy\": The Subject Codes were retired by IPTC before 2010. For the classification of images use the IPTC Media Topics vocabulary now, see: http://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/mediatopic For the Media Topics the CV Term About Image property must be used.\n\nApplies to IIM only: the 8-digit code MUST be prefixed with the five characters IPTC: as value of the dataset 2:12 (Subject Reference). Example: the typed in Subject Code 01002003 must be IPTC:01002003 as IIM value.\n\nThis is a detail of a location with blurred semantics as it does not clearly indicate whether it is the location in the image or the location the photo was taken - which can be different. Two more concise properties are available in IPTC Extension with Location Created and Location Shown in the Image.\n\nMany use the Title field to store the filename of the image, though the field may be used in many ways. Formal identifiers are provided by the Digital Image Id, or the Registry Entry property of the IPTC Extension.\n\nA distinction between contributor and creator should follow rights laws, contracts or common business rules. A vocabulary of roles of persons contributiong to an image should be based on industry wide practices such as https://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/contentprodpartyrole/\n\nServes to identify the rights holder/s for the image. The Copyright Owner, Image Creator and Licensor may be the same or different entities.\n\nRegional laws applying to an asset may prohibit, constrain, or allow data mining for certain purposes (such as search indexing or research), and may overrule the value selected for this property. Similarly, the absence of a prohibition does not indicate that the asset owner grants permission for data mining or any other use of an asset.\n\nThe prohibition âProhibited except for search engine indexingâ only permits data mining by search engines available to the public to identify the URL for an asset and its associated data (for the purpose of assisting the public in navigating to the URL for the asset), and prohibits all other uses, such as AI/ML training.\n\nThe PLUS Other Constraints property is human readable. The IPTC properties Embedded Encoded Rights Expression and Linked Encoded Rights Expression are machine readable.\n\nThis is a PLUS version 2.0.1 property included in the IPTC Extension schema. The value must be one of the URIs listed in the Controlled Vocabulary section of the PLUS specification.\n\nThe identifier will probably be generated by the technical means of an imaging device or software and should be applied to the digital image file as early as possible in its life cycle. This identifier does not identify any pictured content, particularly in case of a scan of non-digital images, only this digital representation.\n\nAny algorithm to create this identifier has to comply with the technical requirements to create a globally unique id. Any device creating digital images - e.g. still image cameras, video cameras, scanners - should create such an identifer right at the time of the creation of the digital data and add the id to the set of metadata.\n\nIPTC’s basic requirements for unique ids are:\n\n* It must be globally unique. Algorithms for this purpose exist.\n\n* It should be secured against tampering.\n\nThese features may be considered:\n\n* It may identify the camera body.\n\n* It may identify each individual photo from this camera body.\n\n* It may identify the date and time of the creation of the picture.\n\nThis field should be implemented in a way to prove it has not been changed since its value has been applied.\n\nIf the identifier has been created by the imaging device its type and brand can be found in the Exif/technical metadata.\n\nExamples are: a press conference, dedication ceremony, etc. If this is a sub-event of a larger event both can be provided by the field: e.g. \"XXXIII Olympic Summer Games (Paris): opening ceremony\". Unplanned events could be named by this property too.\n\nThe creator can be additionally expressed in free-text using the IPTC Core Creator field. In many countries, the Image Creator must be attributed in association with any use of the image. The Image Creator, Copyright Owner, Image Supplier and Licensor may be the same or different entities.\n\nThe value shall be -1 or in the range 0..5. -1 indicates \"rejected\" and 0 \"unrated\". If an explicit value is missing the implicit default value is 0 should be assumed.\n\nAny user interface implementation must show both sub-properties - Item Id and Organisation Id - as corresponding values. Further an input to both fields should be made mandatory.\n\nFor identifying the supplier either a well known and/or registered company name or a URL of the company’s web site may be used. This property succeeds the Provider property of IPTC Core 1.0 by its semantics as that Provider was renamed to Credit Line.\n\nIf the location in the image is different from the location the photo was taken the IPTC Extension property Location Shown in the Image should be used.\n\nIf the location the image was taken in is different from this location the property Location Created should be used too.\n\nThis age should not be displayed to the public on open web portals and the like. But it may be used by image repositories in a B2B enviroment.\n\nThe user should be aware of any legal implications of providing ages for young models. Ages below 18 years should not be included.\n\nIt is recommended to apply the PLUS controlled value Unlimited Model Releases (MR-UMR) very carefully and to check the wording of the model release thoroughly before applying it.\n\nIt is recommended to apply the value PR-UPR very carefully and to check the wording of the property release thoroughly before applying it.\n\nMetadata properties related to the region are typically ones used also for an image as a whole.\n\nThree options for the shape of the boundary are available: the boundary is a rectangle or a circle or a polygon. For each shape a set of properties is required, properties not listed in this set must not be used.\n\nThe Shape property defines which of the three shapes is defined and an the Measuring Unit property defines the units used for measuring all distances.\n\nThe coordinates of points used as reference of a shape of the region boundary and values defining the size of the shape are expressed by scalar values along the x-axis or the y-axis of a rectangular coordinates system. The rules for this system are:\n\nThis structure must be used in a context defining the measuring unit of dimensions along the x- and y-axes."
