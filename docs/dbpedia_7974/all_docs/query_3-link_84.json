        "text": "The whole Notting Hill neighborhood, while already increasingly trendy when the film was shot, became, as Hugh Grant put it, \"a hell of a lot trendier\" once the movie came out.\n\nThe house on Westbourne Park Road that boasted the blue door that served as the front door to Will's flat used to be owned by Richard Curtis—and of course it became a pilgrimage site for the movie's fans.\n\nIn fact, so many people scrawled their own autograph on the door, it was eventually removed and auctioned off at Christie's, but another blue door lives on in its place. (The new owner was nice enough to paint it blue.)\n\nMeanwhile, the inside of Will's flat was a studio set because the actual interior of Curtis' home—a converted chapel—was actually quite grand, boasting a courtyard garden and a 1,000-square-foot reception room. And minus some exterior shots, most of the movie was shot on a meticulously built set about an hour away from the actual Notting Hill.\n\nSome of the scenes of Anna walking red carpets, flashing her famous smile at the cameras and attending award shows is real Julia Roberts footage \"from years gone by,\" she shared with E! News in 1999, as well as footage shot at the 1998 BAFTA Awards, which in real life she attended with her My Best Friend's Wedding co-star Rupert Everett.\n\nOverall, the scenes that illustrate what a huge star her character is are a \"hodgepodge\" of her life and Anna's, Roberts said.\n\nWhat was not real, Roberts was thankful for, was the scene in which Anna opens the door of Will's flat to countless paparazzi snapping away—surrounded by, in what Grant called a \"Fellini moment,\" dozens of actual paparazzi photographing the fake photographers.\n\n\"It's always fun if you can exaggerate a situation, thank goodness,\" Roberts said. \"I've never opened a door and seen 500 people...so yeah, it's certainly enjoyable.\"\n\nCurtis found the opening montage largely lifted from Roberts' actual movie-star life more startling: \"We said, 'F--k! That's who we're dealing with,'\" he told Vanity Fair in 1999. \"It's very easy when you're dealing with a very reasonable, lovely, relaxed, 30-year-old woman to forget that that's also the Julia Roberts who, for 10 years beforehand, you could never have gotten within a hundred yards of. It was a freakish moment when we realized that the woman we were dealing with was actually both those things: this relaxed person and this untouchable, iconic object of which there are so many photographs.\"\n\nGrant recalled his Shakespeare in Love audition opposite Roberts to Vanity Fair: \"I was a very, very unemployed, pathetic actor at the time. I remember being so intimidated by the fact that she was in the room that I got myself in a sort of kerfuffle and missed the chair when I sat down. I sat on the arm of the chair, then had that very awkward inner debate about whether to say, 'Actually, I've missed the chair,' or to pretend that I was really a slightly quirky sort of character who always sits on the arm.\"\n\nWhen it came time to make Notting Hill, Grant still used the word \"fear\" to characterize how he initially felt, explaining, \"I think the emotion you have when you first meet someone tends to linger with you. I was all ready to be scared, and I must say, the fear never quite left me.\"\n\nRoberts didn't go unaffected by the Hugh Grantness of it all, either, however.\n\n\"I was actually intimidated by Hugh and I think also being the only American in the movie,\" she told E! News. \"Everybody just sounds smarter than you. English people can say the dumbest things and make it sound so charming and fabulously interesting, and once I was able to do that and just realize I'm the only nasally sounding Yank of the bunch, then I was able to sort of relax.\"\n\n\"I'm just sort of drifting along in this quite cozy life in this curious backwater of London, and all of a sudden the most famous and beautiful film actress in the world walks into my shop… and romance ensues,\" Grant told E! News in 1999.\n\nSo...it sounds as though Roberts walked in.\n\nWell, Roberts obviously saw the parallels, and it turns out she was surprised by how different she was from Anna.\n\n\"I think going into it I sort of thought, well, I'll know how to do this sort of thing, but the situations become quite specific,\" she told E! News. \"And therefore, the choices that she makes are quite specific within that, and I didn't always agree with her choices—and I think because we share a career, I just sort of assumed that we'd make all the same choices.\n\n\"But we didn't. I had to really remove my own hubris, or judgment or whatever it is in order to play her honestly.\"\n\nRoberts clarified what, exactly, bothered her about the character to Vanity Fair: the fact that Anna had a tumultuous relationship with the media because, before she was famous, she had posed nude and the photos had gotten out.\n\n\"I didn't agree with what she did, first of all,\" Roberts told the magazine in 1999. \"Didn't agree with how she got into this mess—I would never have been in that situation. Didn't agree with the way she was dealing with it...Didn't agree with the way she was reacting to it. Didn't agree with any of that stuff.\"\n\nAccording to Grant, the movie is inspired by a true story!\n\n\"This is a story he won't admit to,\" the actor told E!, \"but he's told me in a drunken moment. A friend of his, an ordinary, normal guy, was in Harrods one day and met a very famous woman, and ended up taking her back to his flat in Notting Hill—and all kinds of nonsense ensued. And they used to meet up, whenever she came to London their affair would reactivate itself—and that was the genesis of his script. But he's so scared of people finding out who this very famous person was that he won't tell anyone that story.\"\n\nThat's The Newsroom's Emily Mortimer playing \"The Perfect Girl\" (as she's credited) who goes out with Will after he Anna don't initially work out. And aside from the awkwardness of knowing your one scene amounts to your character being rejected, the actress showed up with hives, thanks to an allergic reaction from the fabric of a suit she had picked up in a thrift shop.\n\n\"It was a nightmare,\" Mortimer recalled on PeopleTV's Couch Surfing in 2018. \"Every time I got nervous— which you do when you're acting—I got hives and my face... well, one side of it you can still see is sort of chipmunk-like.\"\n\nBut surely Grant, with all his charming ways, eased the tension?\n\n\"No, no,\" Mortimer winced, \"everybody was really embarrassed! It was very awkward. It was like, 'who is this girl who's come—she's just got one scene and she's making such a meal of it,' and nobody would talk to me. It was weird. I was weird, and I was also really shy and mortified.\"\n\nPlaying Will's unwashed slacker flatmate Spike was a breakthrough turn for Rhys Ifans, most notably when the Welsh actor happily flexes and shows off his \"nice, firm buttocks\" to the paparazzi waiting outside the front door for Anna.\n\nBut though Spike can't help but charm as well as amuse, Ifans apparently went quite method with the role.\n\nAsked if it was true he didn't bathe or brush his teeth during filming, he told Interview in 2011, \"We were filming in Shepardston Studios, and I couldn't bear the journey all the way from London every day, so I got a tent and I camped in a campsite nearby. Every morning this big limo would come and pick me up at the campsite, to the utter bafflement of the campsite owner. He thought I was some kind of eccentric millionaire.\"\n\nAnd, \"I would bathe occasionally, when I remembered to.\"\n\nNot helping was the fact that the sneakers the costume department found for him had a \"smell that emanated from the dark depths\" that \"brought a tear to one's eye,\" he told E! News in 1999. \"By the end of the day, the rest of the cast insisted that these trainers were taken away and cleansed—exorcised!\"\n\nBut while he's got the air of the rogue about him, director Roger Michell (who before Notting Hill directed Ifans onstage in Under Milk Wood) described him to the Telegraph in 2006 as full of pleasant contradictions: \"He's gawky, yet graceful. He's smelly and Welsh and yet he's handsome and winning.\" Certainly winning enough to work with Ifans again on the 2004 film Enduring Love and direct him in a 2017 West End production of Mood Music.\n\nIfans told the BBC in 2018 that he'd \"rather throw a brick than sign a petition,\" but he found a happy medium: after being turned on to the cause after playing a homeless man in the one-man play Protest Song in 2013, he volunteered to be an ambassador for the Welsh charity Shelter Cymru, which aids the homeless.\n\nAlec Baldwin has been in a trillion movies, including Notting Hill, where he showed up briefly to play Anna's boyfriend Jeff (plot twist!), who shows up to surprise her in London but by the end of the movie, in absentia, is rumored to have quickly moved on—and \"most rumors about Jeff turn out to be true.\"\n\n\"By the late '90s, I embarked on a string of leading and supporting roles that gained little attention,\" Baldwin recalled in his 2017 memoir Nevertheless, \"though each offered its own charms and gratifications.\"\n\nNotting Hill's big selling point? \"Where, for just one day, on a set in London, I got to breathe the same air as the remarkable Julia Roberts.\"\n\nThe two were supposed to work together again on Ryan Murphy's 2014 HBO movie The Normal Heart, but Baldwin left the project. He can rest assured that Roberts is still a fan, though: In 2017 she said on EW Radio that she had never hosted Saturday Night Live because she was \"too scared,\" but \"I would do it with Alec, if we could be comedy partners just doing skits.\"\n\nSadly, Emma Chambers, who played Will's quirky sister Honey (seen here with Hugh Bonneville, the future Earl of Grantham in Downton Abbey, playing oblivious stockbroker Bernie), died in 2018 at the age of 53.\n\nGrant posted a rare personal tweet, writing, \"Emma Chambers was a hilarious and very warm person and of course a brilliant actress. Very sad news.\"\n\nJames Dreyfus, who played the group's happily married friend Martin, tweeted, \"RIP the wonderful and talented Emma Chambers. Unique,& unspeakably funny. Too young. Thoughts with her family.\"\n\nCurtis, who also wrote for Chambers' other best-known role, Alice Tinker in the BBC sitcom The Vicar of Dibley, told the Telegraph, \"We're obviously terribly sad. She really was a great, great comedy performer—and a very fine actress. And a tender, sweet, funny, unusual, loving human being. In my work she worked opposite Dawn French and Julia Roberts—and was more than the measure of the pair of them.\"\n\nFilm producer Jonathan Sothcott tweeted, \"RIP the wonderful Emma Chambers - best known for The Vicar of Dibley but also stole every scene in Notting Hill. Only 53.\"\n\nDon't worry, the line that left a bad taste in the star's mouth was not \"I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.\"\n\nThat would be tragic, wouldn't it?\n\nNo, the one Roberts wasn't a fan of was when, still tucked in bed, Anna tells Will, quoting Rita Hayworth in 1946's Gilda, \"'They go to bed with Gilda, they wake up with me.'\"\n\n\"I hate to say anything negative about what Richard wrote, because he's a genius, but I hated saying that line,\" she told Vanity Fair. \"To me, it was nails on a chalkboard. I don't really believe any of that.\"\n\nTurns out we're not the only ones who wondered how it all turned out for Anna and Will.\n\n\"I'm going to talk to Julia about it sometime soon,\" Curtis told the Mirror in April 2019 about the possibility of getting the band back together, as he did for Love, Actually and Four Weddings and a Funeral mini-sequels, both for Britain's Red Nose Day, and both of which were rapturously received.\n\nRoger Michell sounded more skeptical about the prospect, telling Her in 2018, \"I just don't know what the story could possibly be. Are Will and Anna still living in Notting Hill with a load of grumpy teenagers running around? I just don't know. In love stories, you have to split up and then get back together again. If you did that with a middle-aged couple living in Notting Hill, it would feel contrived.\"\n\nRoberts told ET in October 2018 that these days she would be more likely to play \"the parents of the people that are rom-com-ing.\"\n\n\"There came a point in my career where people thought I had turned on romantic comedies, which I love...I love to be in them, I love to watch them. But sometimes, they just don't work at a certain point of life experience.\" It's not about age, per se, \"it's just about what people know that you know.\"\n\nWell, we know that we're here for it."
