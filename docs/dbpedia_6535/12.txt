The Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) and the Chengdu city of China’s Sichuan province have formally became sister cities.

Rudra Singh Tamang, chief and executive officer of the KMC, and Tang Liangzhi, secretary of Communist Party of China and former mayor of Chengdu, signed a memorandum of understanding to formalise the sister-city relationship at a function in Kathmandu on Friday.

Along with the MoU, a seven-point agreement was also signed to facilitate educational and cultural exchanges, tourism promotion, urban development planning, and sharing of agricultural and medical technology between the two cities.

Tamang described the agreement as a milestone in building people-to-people relationship between Nepal and China.

The establishment of sister-city relationship with Chengdu was proposed during the visit of former Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to Chengdu earlier this year. Following Oli’s visit, Tamang had sent a formal request letter to Liangzhi, who was still the mayor of Chengdu, for setting up a sister-city relationship between the two cities to strengthen cooperation.
