        "text": "The name Chengdu has remained unchanged for almost 2,500 years. According to \"The World\" (the ancient Chinese geographic book published in the Song Dynasty), Chengdu arose in the words \"it took a year to gather and live in a small community; the second year to become a county center; the third year to transform into a metropolis\" . It literally means \"becoming the capital.\" This is the most popular saying about its origin. The first mention of the beginning of the city of Chengdu appeared already 4500 years ago. During the early war period, the city district of Chengdu became a settlement of the Kai Ming dynasty. Then Chengdu turned out to be the seat of the local government of the Shu Prefecture, and at the same time Chengdu County was created using the resources of the fertile Chengdu Plain, which was irrigated by building the Dujiangyan irrigation system. In 316 BCE the county was conquered by Qin, which began conquests, eventually uniting China in 221 B.C. After the unification of China, Chengdu became the capital of Sichuan Province and one of the most important commercial centers of the Empire.\n\nIn 1911, the Chengdu branch of the Railway Protection Movement helped to establish the Wuchang, which led to the revolution in Xinhai, which overthrew the Qin dynasty. In 1928, a municipal office was created in Chengdu, and the city itself was under the supervision of a provincial government. During World War II, the 14th US Air Army, fighting the Japanese, used the Chengdu airport. Chengdu was the last major city of the continent remaining in the hands of nationalists after losing the civil war with the communists. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the Sichuan administration was established and Chengdu became its headquarters. In 1952, when the provincial system was restored, Chengdu turned out to be the capital of Sichuan Province and remains so to this day.\n\nChengdu is the home of literary giants such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, famous Ming scholars and poets of the Shu kingdom. Among the discovered monuments of ivory, jade artifacts, bronze objects, gold objects and carved stone artifacts. In 2001, an ancient artifact (Golden Sun Bird) was discovered from Jinsha ruins in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. It has the shape of an annular foil made of pure gold. The pattern consists of four birds, swimming in the same direction (counterclockwise), located around the perimeter. The piece comes from the late Shang dynasty and is now in the Ruins Museum in Chengdu Jinsha. In 2011, he was officially chosen as the main logo of the city of Chengdu. One of the cultural objects is the Sichuan Opera (Chan Yu) founded at the turn of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) and the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). Along with immigrants arriving in Sichuan, various dramas arrived here, which were mixed with the local dialect, customs, folk music and dances.\n\nIt is said that the ancient inhabitants painted their faces to scare away animals. The Sichuan opera absorbed this ancient skill and created art from it. To this day, changing faces during the performance is its main attraction. In addition, Chengdu boasts of numerous monuments. The most famous include: Marquis Wu Temple (complex of pavilions and gardens), Du Fu Village House (residence of Du Fu, poet of the Tang dynasty), Qingyanggong (temple of the Tang dynasty), Wenshu Temple (1,200 years old; current buildings come from the eighteenth century) and many others. Chengdu also has the Chinese Panda Research and Breeding Base along with 30 hectares of bamboo forest. It is also worth mentioning that since 2012 the city has been organizing one of the most prestigious snooker tournaments. Chengdu may also be of interest to team sports fans. Currently, the city has three football teams at different levels. The sports stadium is located in the heart of the city, it can seat 42,000 spectators. It is a multifunctional place where numerous competitions, training sessions and performances take place. In 2007, it was the arena of the struggle of the Women's World Cup. One can also find here something for people who like new culinary experiences - it is the main center of Sichuan cuisine, where the Sichuan Academy of Culinary Arts operates.\n\nChengdu is the most significant cultural and educational center in southwestern China. There are 40 universities. The most famous of them are, among others Sichuan University, University of Electronic and Technological Sciences, Jiaotong University and University of Economics and Finance. Every year, many students from abroad decide to study in this city. Chengdu has a long tradition of encouraging international exchanges in the field of education, and the city is currently working with its sister cities in Japan, Great Britain, France and Australia. Only by the end of 2013, 14 contracts were signed for projects in the field of educational cooperation with seven countries including the United Kingdom, France, USA, Australia and Finland. An increasing number of universities and colleges are running courses for foreign students in Chinese language and culture, traditional Chinese medicine. More and more parents are sending their children to international schools, of which the most famous in the city are: International School in Chengdu, International School in Chengdu Meishi, School Eton House, School Leman International and finally International School QSI. Teaching in Sichuan is a very interesting experience.\n\nAt the end of 2014, when Fangsuo Commune began operating, it became the largest bookstore and hot spot in the city. At the end of 2015, she moved to Tianfu Square. Its area is 52,000 m2 (it consists of 8 floors).\n\nFrom 7 to 11 October 2019, meetings were held in Chengdu with the Mayor of Chengdu and representatives of the Great Panda Research Center, the Qinbaijiang transhipment station and the Qinbaijiang School, where Polish is taught.\n\nDuring the meeting with the Mayor of Chengdu, the following issues were discussed: the ÅódÅº-Chengdu cargo rail connection, expanding the operational activities of ÅódÅº logistics companies in Chengdu, joint promotion of this connection and Chengdu's support in finding new partners for cooperation under this project.\n\nIn addition, a meeting was held at the Great Panda Research Center in Chengdu, which aimed to establish cooperation and exchange experiences between the Panda Center and the ZOO in ÅódÅº. The city of Chengdu is interested in cooperation within the Orientarium being created in ÅódÅº. Due to the fact that a huge complex with Asian flora and fauna will be created in the ÅódÅº orientarium, the Great Panda Center is considering transferring the species of Great Panda to the ÅódÅº orientarium under lease.\n\nThe city also had the opportunity to present its economic profile along with investment opportunities. In addition, the exhibition EXPO Horticultural 2024 in ÅódÅº was presented - with the theme \"Nature of the City\". Chengdu City authorities have expressed interest in cooperation under EXPO 2024, all the more that China is currently implementing a new ecological strategy based on building a system of ecological civilization.\n\nOn 6 September 2018 a meeting with representatives of Sinopol - the Foundation for Chinese-Polish Economic and Cultural Exchange took place at Primary School No. 1 in ÅódÅº.\n\nThe meeting aimed at determining the details of the visit of students from the Language Elementary School located in the Qingbaijiang District in Chengdu to ÅódÅº. Since September 2017, this school, probably as the first in China, has introduced Polish to its curriculum. From 22 to 26 September Chinese students will visit ÅódÅº. They will take part in classes at Primary School No. 1 together with Polish peers and visit our city. An official agreement between the schools will be signed.\n\nThe main motivation to organize the visit was intensive cooperation between ÅódÅº and Chengu. Schools are hoping to broaden integration and establish relationships that would enable the start of various educational projects in the future.\n\nParticipants of the meeting: Director of Promary School no. 1 Magdalena Prokaryn – Dynarska, representatives of Sinopol Charlene Zhao i Jan SÄkowski as well as the representatives of the Department of Education and Investor Service and International Cooperation Bureau of the City of ÅódÅº Office.\n\n\"Chengdu in the world and the world in Chengdu\" - this is the leitmotif of the festival of sculpture of sister cities of Chengdu organized by the Municipal Chengdu People's Government, an office of foreign cooperation of the Municipal People's Government in Chengdu and the Municipal and Rural Construction Commission in Chengdu.\n\nThe first stage of the festival assumed the invitation of artists - representatives of Chengdu's sister cities to learn about the construction of the eco-park - the target location for the implementation of the sculptures, the history of the city and the region, familiarization with the artistic / sculptural environment of Chengdu and gathering inspiration from the local culture and history of the Sichuan region.\n\nTo this end, a group of 40 artists from around the world visited, among others, places such as: Chengdu Exhibition Hall containing an ecopark plan, multimedia presentation and a detailed model of the city, Chengdu Museum, Dongjiao Memory Music Park and Taikoo Li to learn about the deep past of Chengdu and modern present. In addition, a seminar was held at the Sculpture Department of the University of Arts in Sichuan.\n\nIn 2018, an unveiling ceremony of selected works of sculptures of partner cities is planned „2018 Chengdu International Sister Cities Sculptures Creation and Exhibition”.\n\nOn 6 August, in ÅódÅº, as part of a journey around Europe, a group of ten little Panda journalists from the City of Chengdu visited ÅódÅº.\n\nThis trip was a reward for children for good results at school.
