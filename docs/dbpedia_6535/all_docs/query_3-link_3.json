        "text": "In Sichuan province, China\n\nThe Politics of Chengdu in Sichuan province, China is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China. Chengdu Municipal Government is deeply influenced by its long past. Chengdu's political system reflects the two major influences on the historical development of China: on the one hand, its legacy as an over 2,000 years feudal system region, and on the other, the powerful influence exerted by China's neighbor to the north, the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Mayor is the highest-ranking official in Chengdu Municipal Government, which officially called Chengdu Municipal People's Government. However, in the city's dual party-government governing system, the Mayor has less power than the Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary of Chengdu, colloquially termed the \"Communist Party Secretary of Chengdu\" or \"Party Secretary of Chengdu\".[citation needed]\n\nIntroduction\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a city of the Communist State, Chengdu's system of government was based on the Soviet Union system of one party dictatorship. This is referred to as \"Soviet Union-style\" democracy.\n\nThe Head of the Chengdu Municipal Government is the Mayor. The Mayor's agreement is required for an Act of Chengdu People's Congress to become law. The People's Congress has a number of different functions, first and foremost, it scrutinize the execution of constitution, laws, regulations in the city. Another important function is to debate the major issues of the city. Its other roles are to provide the means of carrying on the work of government by voting for leaders, including chairmen and vice-chairman of the People's Congress, mayor, deputy mayor, president of the municipal court and president of the municipal procuratorate.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 5, 2012, state media announced that Li Chuncheng was being investigated by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) for \"serious violations of laws and regulations\".[1] He was sentenced to 13 years in prison on October 12, 2015.[2]\n\nList of mayors\n\n[edit]\n\nName (English) Name (Chinese) Tenure begins Tenure ends Note Zhou Shidi 周世第 January 1950 July 1950 Li Zonglin [zh] 李宗林 July 1950 February 1966 Mi Jianshu [zh] 米建书 February 1966 May 1968 Sun Hongdao [zh] 孙洪道 May 1968 August 1974 Xu Mengxia [zh] 许梦侠 August 1974 January 1979 Mi Jianshu [zh] 米建书 January 1979 March 1982 Hu Maozhou 胡懋洲 March 1982 May 1988 Diao Jinxiang [zh] 刁金祥 November 1988 March 1992 Huang Yinkui [zh] 黄寅逵 March 1992 October 1993 Wang Rongxuan [zh] 王荣轩 October 1993 January 2001 Li Chuncheng 李春城 January 2001 June 2003 Ge Honglin 葛红林 June 2003 October 2014 Tang Liangzhi 唐良智 January 2015 September 2016 [3] Luo Qiang [zh] 罗强 January 2017 July 2020 [4] Wang Fengzhao [zh] 王凤朝 July 2020 [5][6]\n\nList of CCP Committee Secretaries\n\n[edit]\n\nRepublic of China\n\n[edit]\n\nName (English) Name (Chinese) Tenure begins Tenure ends Note Zhang Xiushu [zh] 张秀熟 October 1927 January 1928 Liu Rongjian [zh] 刘荣简 January 1928 March 1932 Party Secretary of Chengdu County Ma Jialong [zh] 马加龙 March 1932 March 1938 Party Secretary of Chenghua District Du Fusheng [zh] 杜桴生 March 1938 May 1938 Han Tianshi [zh] 韩天石 May 1938 July 1938 Zhang Xuan [zh] 张宣 July 1938 October 1938 Zhang Wencheng [zh] 张文澄 October 1938 June 1940 Hou Fangyue [zh] 侯方岳 June 1940 March 1941 Wei Zetong [zh] 魏泽同 March 1941 September 1941 Li Dechun [zh] 李德椿 September 1941 March 1942 Wang Zhizhong [zh] 王致中 March 1942 May 1946 Pu Huafu [zh] 蒲华辅 May 1946 Peng Sai [zh] 彭塞 Autumn of 1947 February 1948 Hong Deming [zh] 洪德铭 February 1948 1950\n\nPeople's Republic of China\n\n[edit]\n\nName (English) Name (Chinese) Tenure begins Tenure ends Note Li Jingquan 李井泉 12 April 1950 14 January 1953 Hao Deqing 郝德青 14 January 1953 30 December 1954 Liao Jingdan [zh] 廖井丹 30 December 1954 29 May 1956 Liao Jingdan [zh] 廖井丹 29 May 1956 January 1969 First Party Secretary of Chengdu Sun Hongdao [zh] 孙洪道 January 1969 April 1971 Sun Hongdao [zh] 孙洪道 April 1971 August 1974 Xu Mengxia [zh] 许梦侠 August 1974 December 1979 Mi Jianshu [zh] 米建书 December 1979 March 1981 Mi Jianshu [zh] 米建书 March 1981 May 1983 Wu Xihai [zh] 吴希海 May 1983 May 1993 Huang Yinkui [zh] 黄寅逵 May 1993 December 1997 Tao Wuxian 陶武先 December 1997 December 2000 Wang Rongxuan [zh] 王荣轩 January 2001 June 2003 Li Chuncheng 李春城 June 2003 November 2011 Huang Xinchu 黄新初 October 2011 July 2016 Tang Liangzhi 唐良智 July 2016 March 2017 [7] Fan Ruiping [zh] 范锐平 April 2017 August 2021 [8] Shi Xiaolin 施小琳 August 2021 [9]"
