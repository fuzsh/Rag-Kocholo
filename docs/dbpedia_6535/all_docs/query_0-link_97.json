        "text": "(Tongwei International Center, Corporate Headquarters)\n\nFocusing its core business on agriculture and new energy, Tongwei Group, a leading technologically advanced private enterprise, continues its rapid development with chemical industry, pet food, IT, construction and real estate. As a National Key Leading Enterprise in Agricultural Industrialization, the company owns more than 130 branches and subsidiaries in China as well as Southeast Asia, with more than 20,000 employees. Tongwei Co., Ltd., listed in 2004 on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (stock code: 600438.SH) and under the leadership of Tongwei Group, manages an annual feed production capacity of over 10 million metric tons (tonnes). The company has captured more than 20 percent of China's market share for aquafeed, which makes it the country’s industry leader for 20-odd consecutive years.\n\nAdhering to its core philosophy of \"for a better life\", Tongwei perseveres in feed and aquaculture core business development, as well as its industrial chain build-up on its way to the world-class safe food supplier. Meanwhile, Tongwei strives to strengthen its competitiveness through huge investment in polycrystalline silicon and solar PV industry. It aims to become a world-class solar PV enterprise and a world-class clean energy company.\n\nIn terms of the new energy industry, Tongwei has already become a PV enterprise integrating businesses from the upstream polycrystalline silicon production, solar cell production to construction of the downstream PV power plants. The company has owned a complete PV energy industrial chain with independent intelligent property rights.\n\nAfter years of leapfrog development, in the upstream of the new energy industrial chain, Yongxiang Co., Ltd under Tongwei has already formed a capacity of producing 20,000 tonnes of polycrystalline silicon, reached the international first-class level in terms of cost control and quality, and offered high-quality silicon materials to the middle and downstream industrial chains. After technological renovation, its product capacity has ranked the third in the country with the first-class quality and the lowest production cost nationwide.\n\n(Bird view of Yongxiang Co., Ltd.)\n\nIn 2017, Yongxiang Co., Ltd. plans to build a polycrystalline silicon and supporting new energy project with an annual capacity of 50,000 tonnes, which is expected to require a total investment of RMB8 billion. To be specific, construction on the phase-I project with a capacity of 25,000 tonnes will start before June 30, this year and is expected to be completed in 2018. The phase-II project with a capacity of 25,000 tonnes will be advanced according to market demands. After completion of the whole project, Yongxiang Co., Ltd. will see its polycrystalline silicon capacity reach 70,000 tonnes.\n\nIn the middle stream of the industrial chain, Tongwei has been engaged in R&D, manufacturing and promotion of solar power generation equipment and products and already realized the capacity of producing 3.4GW solar cells and 500MW solar power components. It has become the globally largest polycrystalline silicon solar cell producer by shipment. Average conversion efficiency of the solar power cells has been more than 20 percent, with the quality meeting the highest standards in the industry. Technological indicators of its solar power products have reached the world’s advanced level with its solar cell quality and customer satisfaction ranking the No. 1 in China.\n\nOn November 18, 2015, Tongwei made a plan to build a globally largest silicon cell project with a capacity of 5GW in Shuangliu District, Chengdu, capital city of southwest China’s Sichuan Province. After seven months of rapid construction, the phase-I project was successfully put into service on June 30, 2016. It has been a high-efficiency silicon cell project with the highest degree of automation and the largest single-workshop capacity. Media in Chengdu praised the project for its rapid construction and production and hailed the project as the new “China Speed” and “World Speed”.\n\nFrom the project start to now, leadership of the central, provincial and municipal governments showed their full support and meticulous care. On October 17, 2016, Sun Chunlan, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee inspected the project and spoke highly of it during her inspection in Chengdu. On September 6, 2016, Wang Dongming, Secretary of Sichuan Provincial Committee of the CPC, inspected the project. Secretary of Chengdu Municipal Committee of the CPC Tang Liangzhi inspected the projects three times.\n\nOn January 22, 2017, contracts of the phase-II and phase-III of the project with a total capacity of 4GW were signed, with a total investment of RMB5 billion. The phase-II with a capacity of 2GW is expected to be built and rolled out at the end of this year. At present, Tongwei Solar (Hefei, Chengdu) company’s capacity scale has jumped to the No. 1 in the world. In coming three to five years, Tongwei will see the solar power cell capacity total 10GW and realize more than RMB20 billion of industrial value. By then, Tongwei will be the globally largest solar power cell producer with the strongest competitiveness and influence.\n\n(Signing ceremony of the 4GW high-efficiency crystalline cell project)\n\nAt the terminal of industrial chain, Tongwei has unique advantages to develop the distributed PV and is vigorously developing the household roof-mounted PV power and combining the modern fishery to build the “fishery-PV integration” model. At present, Tongwei has been building the user-centered distributed PV power generation and “fishery-PV integration” bases nationwide to let tens of millions of households have access to high-quality and clean PV power. As the only leading enterprise dabbling in both agricultural and new energy PV industries in China and the world, Tongwei has truly realized efficient and coordinated development of agriculture and PV and will ultimately become a globally leading green agriculture and green energy supplier.\n\n(S1 battery factory in Tongwei Solar (Chengdu) Co., Ltd.)\n\nOver the past three decades, Tongwei has long maintained the stable and rapid development momentum. While making positive contributions to fisheries, new energy and other fields in China, it has been widely recognized by the society. Particularly, in recent years, Tongwei Group and its controlling Tongwei Co., Ltd. have received many honors and awards, including Top 100 Chinese Private Listed Company, Top 50 Most Competitive Chinese Private Enterprise, etc. In November 2013, Tongwei Group won the award of Global Top 500 New Energy Enterprise. In January 2014, the project in which Tongwei Co., Ltd. participated won the Second Prize for National Scientific and Technological Progress. On December 23, 2014, Tongwei Co., Ltd. received the “Sichuan Quality Award”. In March 2016, Tongwei Co., Ltd won the Nomination Award of the Second China Quality Prize. In 2016, by virtue of its RMB53.211 billion operation revenue, Tongwei Group again was included in the list of the China TOP 500 Private Enterprises in 2016 and also ranked the first among enterprises of Sichuan in the list of the China Top 100 Private Enterprises in Manufacturing Industry in 2016. Brand value of Tongwei Group stood at RMB40.358 billion in 2016 and wonthe China’s 500 Most Valuable Brand for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n(China’s 500 Most Valuable Brands in 2016)\n\nIn the process of development and growth of Tongwei Group, Liu Hanyuan, Member of Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tongwei Group, has also constantly received high praises and full appreciation from all walks of life. In December 2012, Liu Hanyuan won the title of “Top Ten Businessmen in PV Industry in 2012”. On November 6, 2013, he received the honor of “Global New Energy, The Figures of The Year” from the National Energy Administration. In 2014, he won titles of “Businessmen of The Year in China’s Livestock Feed Industry” and “Global New Energy Business Leader”. In 2015, he won titles of “Asia-Pacific Economic Leaders’ Award for Social Responsibility” and “Figures with Economic Influence in Sichuan”.\n\nWhile realizing its own stable development, Tongwei Group has actively participated in public benefit activities with a high sense of social responsibility. So far, Tongwei Group has donated materials and money of more than RMB350 million."
