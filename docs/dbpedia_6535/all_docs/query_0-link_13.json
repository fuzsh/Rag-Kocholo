It is a significant opportunity to motivate more profound reform and opening-up by aligning with international standards. Chongqing still lags behind domestic and international cities despite its positive progress in optimizing the business environment in recent years. By taking the improvement as a significant opportunity, departments at all levels of Chongqing should significantly propel the business environment by promoting the domestic best practices and learning from international cities.\n\nHe also made an emphasis on three aspects. For one thing, itâ€™s necessary to launch more accurate and effective policies and measures by referring national and international advanced standards, making policies and measures and laws and regulations more improved, rolling out criteria for an enterprise-related fee reduction or exemption. For another, with the aim of efficient enterprise service and better enterprise satisfaction, efforts should be made to optimize the administrative services by focusing on the service system and procedure reconstruction. Moreover, Chongqing should reinforce the sense of responsibility and strengthen coordination to ensure the implementation of all tasks, to make its system and capacity of the business environment to a new level."
