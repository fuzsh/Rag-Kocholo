        "text": "CHENGDU, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan on Friday hosted a banquet in Chengdu, capital city of southwest China's Sichuan Province, to welcome guests attending the opening ceremony of the Chengdu FISU World University Games.\n\nFollowing is the full text of the toast by President Xi:\n\nToast by H.E. Xi Jinping\n\nPresident of the People's Republic of China\n\nAt the Welcoming Banquet of\n\nThe Opening Ceremony of\n\nThe Chengdu FISU World University Games\n\nChengdu, July 28, 2023\n\nDistinguished Colleagues,\n\nDistinguished FISU Acting President Leonz Eder,\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nFriends,\n\nIt is a great pleasure to join you in Chengdu for the 31st World University Games in the blossoming summer. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, and in the name of my wife and myself, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to all our distinguished guests!\n\nThe Chengdu FISU World University Games will officially open tonight. China has committed itself to organizing a streamlined, safe and splendid games. In spite of COVID-19 and other adverse factors, we have acted vigorously to fulfill our solemn pledge for a successful World University Games and to make new contributions to the cause of international youth sports.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nFriends,\n\nSince its inception, the World University Games has always been a celebration of youth, solidarity, and friendship.\n\n-- We should bring together young people from around the world to promote world peace and development with the power of youth. While the key to state-to-state relations lies in close bonds between peoples, efforts to this end must start from the youth. The younger generation motivated by ideals and responsibilities are the future of mankind as well as the hope of the lofty pursuit of peace and development. China will work with FISU and all participating delegations to make the Chengdu Games a grand sports event that will present the charms of China, the vibe of our times and the beauty of youth, and facilitate mutual understanding among young people from around the world, so as to provide new impetus for the progress of mankind.\n\n-- We should carry forward the spirit of the World University Games to stand up to global challenges in solidarity. Sixty-two years ago, Dr. Paul Schleimer, founding president of FISU, described the World University Games as a gathering of friendship. This characterization, together with the values of friendship, fraternity, fair play, perseverance, integrity, cooperation and application championed by FISU, has not only guided the sports activities of university students around the world, but also inspired us to navigate the changes of the world, of our times and of the course of history. We should promote solidarity through sports, build up positive energy across the international community, join hands to tackle global challenges such as climate change, food crisis and terrorism, and shape a better future through cooperation.\n\n-- We should deepen exchanges and mutual learning to promote harmony without uniformity in the spirit of inclusiveness. Civilizations take different forms, making the world colorful and diverse. Young people are full of vitality. They can and should be able to view diversity from an equal, inclusive and friendly perspective, and see different cultures with an attitude of mutual appreciation and mutual learning. The Chengdu Games should be an opportunity for us to champion the common values of humanity and write a new chapter in building a community with a shared future for mankind.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nFriends,\n\nIn ancient times, the metropolis of Chengdu, known as Yi, was famous for its magnificent landscape and rich culture. This historical and cultural city has long been a hub of exchanges connecting China to the rest of the world, like a pearl on the southwestern Silk Road. Today, Chengdu is one of the most dynamic and happiest cities in China. Thanks to its inclusiveness, the city has continued to prosper economically and thrive culturally since it was founded over 2,300 years ago. I encourage you to tour the city, to experience and share firsthand the multifaceted manifestations of the Chinese path to modernization.\n\nNow, I would like to propose a toast,\n\nTo the success of the Chengdu Games;\n\nTo solidarity and friendship among all peoples in the world; and\n\nTo the health of all distinguished guests and your families.\n\nCheers! â– "
