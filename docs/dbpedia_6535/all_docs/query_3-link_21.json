        "text": "THE 2016 G20 FINANCE MINISTERS AND CENTRAL BANK GOVERNORS MEETING TO BE HELD IN CHENDGU\n\nOn the 16 February 2016, the Sichuan Provincial People’s Government announced that the third ‘2016 G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting’ would be held in Chengdu on 23-24 July 2016.\n\nThe predominant theme of the meeting will be, ‘encouraging and fostering economic growth, through co-operation and mutual shared responsibilities’. Furthermore the meeting will canvass issues ranging from the current global economic climate, investment growth and infrastructure development.\n\nThe Mayor of Chengdu, Mr. Liangzhi Tang stated, “Chengdu’s financial industry has significantly developed and prospered over the last number of years. In 2015 Chengdu’s total local and foreign currency deposits exceeded RMB 3 Trillion, in the same year, 10 local companies were listed on the Chinese “A list “ stock exchange, and a further sixty nine on the Chinese “New Third Board“ (NTB). Furthermore Chengdu was the birthplace of ‘Jiaozi’, which was China’s first official government bank note.”\n\n“Currently Chengdu is striving to upgrade its service industries and establishing itself as Western China’s financial epi-centre. Thereby hosting the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting further reinforces Chengdu’s pivotal within the Western China, its burgeoning financial industry and its trajectory to become an international metropolis”, Mayor Tang states.\n\nMayor Tang also noted that “the G20 meeting continues to draw upon the successes of the 2013 Fortune Global Forum and the World Chinese Entrepreneurs Convention, which were both held in Chengdu, and it continues to demonstrate Chengdu’s ability to stage world class leading events. Furthermore it will help the world to better understand Chengdu’s unique investment characteristics, its vibrancy and the charm of its people”, end article.\n\nInvestinchengdu.com undoubtedly agrees the hosting of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting is a significant milestone for this Western China economic powerhouse.\n\nOrganisers when selecting the venue for these types of meetings, organisers want to demonstrate a cities and/or province’s unique socio economic capabilities and progressive investment climate.\n\nIndeed in selecting Chengdu to host the third G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting of 2016, it fits very well within these parameters because as we have maintained consistently, Chengdu’s socio-economic and investment climate is very stable with a GDP over RMB 1 Trillion, growing per capita income, and a very well-structured and vibrant economy.\n\nThe ‘2015 Milken Institute Best Performing Chinese Cities’ report ranked Chengdu as the No.1 performing City in China. Its authors Perry Wong and Michael C.Y. Lin stated, “Chengdu’s outstanding performance is unrivalled and it secured top 10 positions in seven of the index’s nine components, more than any other city.”\n\nFinally, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors will be pleasantly surprised with Chengdu’s business, investment and technological capabilities and when returning home will spread the news about this pivotal Western China metropolis.\n\nInformation sources :\n\nhttp://www.sc.gov.cn/10462/12771/2015/9/10/10352025.shtml\n\nhttp://sc.people.com.cn/n2/2016/0216/c345458-27738787.html\n\nhttp://www.g20.org/English/G20Calendar/201512/t20151231_2098.html\n\nhttp://english.cntv.cn/program/bizasia/20130925/104886.shtml\n\nhttp://www.fortuneconferences.com/global-forum-2013\n\nDisclaimer: The initial five paragraphs were summarised from the above first mentioned source, added sources provided fir further information and commentary provided by investinchengdu.com."
