        "text": "On March 26, Tang Liangzhi, Deputy Secretary of Chongqing Municipal Party Committee and Mayor, visited industrial parks, enterprises and project sites in Dazu District to investigate the construction of Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle. He emphasized that Chongqing's advantages should be coordinated with national development and opportunity should be seized to find the right direction and clear path of accelerating the participation in the construction of Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle.\n\nElevator industry cluster has formed in Dazu High-tech Zone with the annual output of elevators accounting for one-third of that of the whole city. Tang Liangzhi visited the digital workshop and intelligent elevator manufacturing command center of Schmidt Elevator Co., Ltd., learned about production and management and watched how the enterprise carried out security monitoring and maintenance of products by the internet of things and big data technology. Knowing that the enterprise was seizing the new opportunity arising from the outbreak of coronavirus and successfully developed the voice control non-contact elevator buttons, Tang recognized this initiative. He advised the enterprise to target the diversified market demand for elevators, be bold to innovate, develop and produce more high-end products. The park should further introduce supporting enterprises, improve the industrial chain, and promote the upstream-downstream coordinated development.\n\nThe unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) developed and produced by Chongqing Guofei General Aviation Equipment Manufacturing Co., Ltd. have been widely applied in the fields of high-rise fire control, agricultural plant protection, goods transportation, winning multiple patents for invention. Tang said that there are a large number of high-rise buildings in Chongqing, the demand for fire safety is huge, so it is expected that enterprises could further advance the industry-university-research collaborative innovation and expand the application scenarios of UAVs.\n\nTang also conducted a field study on the station yard siting of the Chengdu-Chongqing Midline High-speed Railway Project. He pointed out that Chengdu-Chongqing Midline High-speed Railway is a strategic, leading, remarkable and significant project during the construction of Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle. Development vision, strategic thinking, farsighted and scientific planning should be adopted, the rail transportation network construction should be accelerated to connect surrounding cities, gather and integrate the flow of people, goods, and capital, and play the leading role of high-speed railway stations in the urban economy.\n\nTang highlighted that Dazu District is located in the central part of the Chengdu-Chongqing region and it is a critical hub in the Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle. Opportunities should be seized to gain momentum, accelerate participation in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle and upgrade the urban role in agglomeration and radiation. Dazu Rock Carvings should be well protected, researched and utilized and its brand awareness increased. The development of cultural and creative industries, tourism, etc. should be enhanced by making full use of advantages of cultural resources, the industry-city-landscape integrated development should be promoted. Characteristic industries should be developed according to local conditions, traditional competitive industries such as automobile, motorcycle, hardware, sculpture, elevator equipment, renewable resources recycling should be consolidated, industry clusters expanded, industry chain extended and value chain improved. By accelerating the infrastructure connectivity, actively promoting the construction of high-speed railways, highways, and urban rail transportation, a smooth, connected, fast and efficient transportation system can be established."
