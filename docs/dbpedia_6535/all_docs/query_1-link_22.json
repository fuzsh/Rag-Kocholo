However, comprehensive virological surveillance of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) over multiple years after the use of EV-A71 vaccines has rarely been conducted. Using long-term data extracted from the Public Health and Clinical Center of Chengdu, we described the clinical, aetiological, and epidemiological characteristics of HFMD inpatients after the use of EV-A71 vaccines from 2017 through 2022. A total of 5115 patients were selected for analysis with a male-to-female ratio of 1.63:1 and were mostly under 5 years of age (97.6%). Among these cases, 4.3% presented with severe symptoms, and 4.1% of severe cases experienced significant complications. EV-A71 was no longer the major serotype for laboratory-confirmed HFMD, responsible for 15.6% of severe cases and 1.2% of mild cases. A significant downwards trend of EV-A71 infections was observed after the use of EV-A71 vaccines (P for trend < 0.001). Coxsackievirus A6 was the predominant pathogen, accounting for 63.5% of mild cases and 36.2% of severe cases. Coxsackievirus A10 (CV-A10) and A16 were sporadically detected, and an upwards trend was observed in the proportion of CV-A10 infections. This study provides baseline molecular epidemiology for the evaluation of EV-A71 vaccination impact and potential serotype replacement based on HFMD inpatients. Additional nationwide and population-based epidemiologic and serologic studies are essential to elucidate HFMD dynamics after the use of EV-A71 vaccines, and to inform public health authorities to introduce optimized intervention strategies."
