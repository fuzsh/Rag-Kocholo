        "text": "217\n\nIslet Transplantation Improves Peripheral Neuropathy in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes: A 5 Year Prospective Study\n\nMarie-Christine Vantyghem1, Delphine Quintin1, Wassila Karrouz1, Jean-François Hurtevent1, Violeta Raverdy1, Robert Caiazzo1, Christian Noel1, Julie Kerr-Conte1, Francois Pattou1\n\n1INSERM UMR 859 Biotherapies for diabetes, Lille University Hospital, Lille, France.\n\nObjective: Long-term benefit-risk ratio of islet transplantation remains unclear. We explored the evolution of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy during 5 years after islet transplantation with the Edmonton protocol in type 1 diabetic patients.\n\nPatients and Methods: Twenty-one patients (13 islet-alone and 8 islet-after-kidney) were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Islet transplantation consisted of 2 or 3 sequential infusions with IL2rAb / sirolimus - tacrolimus immunosuppression. All patients underwent biological evaluation, continuous blood pressure and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), lower-limb electrophysiological testing and cardiovascular autonomic testing (R-R variation with paced breathing, Valsalva ratio, postural heart rate and blood pressure changes) before transplantation and yearly during 5 years. Outcomes were analyzed in intention to treat.\n\nResults: At 5 years, islet remained functional in 18 patients (85%). Ten patients (48%) were insulin-independent with a median (IQR) HbA1c at 6.0 (5.8–6.7) % vs. 7.8 (6.9-8.3) % in those requiring insulin (p<0.001). The medians of sensory action potential (p<0.05) and both sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities (p<0.01) improved between 0 and 5 years. All 4 parameters significantly correlated negatively with mean glucose / CGM and all outcomes except sensory nerve conduction velocity correlated negatively with triglycerides (p≤0.01). Sensory conduction velocity correlated negatively with glucose variability (SD) / CGM (p<0.01). Tacrolimus levels negatively correlated with motor conduction parameters (p≤0.02). All four parameters correlated positively with ß score or post-prandial C-peptide level (p<0.05). Cardiovascular reflex testing did not change over the 5–year follow-up.\n\nConclusion: islet-alone or after-kidney transplantation improved significantly sensory nerve conduction parameters but not autonomic neuropathy after 5 years. Mean glucose was the main factor associated with this improvement.\n\n(ClinicalTrial.gov: NCT00446264 / NCT01123187).\n\n218\n\nPrimary Graft Function Predicts Retention of Insulin Independence After Islet Transplantation: A Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry (CITR) Study\n\nVioleta Raverdy1, Marie-Christine Vantyghem1, Shari Messinger-Cayetano2, Konstantinos Rouskas1, Julie Kerr-Conte1, Rodolfo Alejandro3, Michael Rickels4, Franca B. Barton5, Francois Pattou1\n\n1Faculty of Medicine, Department of General and Endocrine Surgery, Lille University Hospital, Lille, France; 2Division of Biostatistics, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Biostatistics Collaboration and Consulting Core, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, United States; 3Metabolic Studies Core, Clinical Islet Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, United States; 4Institute for Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States; 5The Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry, The EMMES Corporation, Rockville, MD, United States.\n\nObjective: Primary graft function (PGF) is an independent predictor of long term outcome in organ transplantation (1), and its role has been also suggested in islet transplantation (IT) (2). Here, we explored in a large, multicentric cohort, the influence of PGF on the long term outcome of allogenic IT in non uremic patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D).\n\nResearch Design and Methods: Participants in this retrospective analysis were T1D islet-alone transplant (IAT) recipients enrolled in the Collaborative Islet Transplant Registry (www.CITRegistry.org), who received one to three sequential allogenic islet infusions. PGF was defined as Ryan’s ß-score, a previously validated index of islet graft function (3), ranging 0-8, and calculated from the last available fasting blood glucose, plasma C peptide, HbA1c, and daily exogenous insulin within 75 days post each of 1-3 infusions per recipient. PGF was considered as optimal / suboptimal / poor when ß-score was 7-8 / 5-6 / 0-4, respectively. The main study outcome was insulin independence post last infusion.\n\nResults: A total of 460 IAT recipients with sufficient data (37%M/73%F, age 45±10 years, diabetes duration 29±11 years, A1c 7.7±1.3%, mean ±SD), received a total of 892 infusions. Time to first achievement of insulin independence after each infusion (censored at reinfusion or last follow-up) was significantly shorter with increasing PGF (p<0.001, Figure 1). Optimal PGF was more frequent after multiple infusions 17/460 (4%), 41/330 (12%) and 20/102 (19%) following one, two, or three infusions, respectively (p<0.001). Duration of insulin independence was significantly longer with increasing PGF (p<0.001, Figure 2), and this association was independent of the total number of infusions. The mean (95% CI) time to loss of insulin independence was 54 (44-64) / 41(35-47) / 37 (31-43) months after last infusion in patients with optimal / suboptimal / poor PGF, respectively (p=0.05).\n\nConclusion: PGF (ß score within 75 days post last infusion) predicted long term retention of insulin independance after IT in non uremic patients. These results suggest that 1. islet graft potency and/or engraftment should be optimized and 2. PGF may represent a simple and early end point for the clinical evaluation of new relevant strategies.\n\nReference:\n\n[1] Terasaki PI, Cecka JM, Gjertson DW, Takemoto S: High survival rates of kidney transplants from spousal and living unrelated donors.

We sought to determine the effect of intrahepatic islet transplantation on glucose counterregulation and hypoglycemia symptoms in patients with long-standing T1D. Subjects prior to (PRE) and 6 months after (POST) intrahepatic islet transplantation (n=12) and normal controls (NL; n=6) underwent hyperinsulinemic (1 mU/kg/min) hypoglycemic (hourly steps ∼80, ∼65, ∼55 and ∼45 mg/dl) and euglycemic (∼90 mg/dl) clamps with infusion of 6,6-2H2-glucose (0.05 mg/kg/min) for measurement of endogenous glucose production (EGP) by the isotopic dilution method. Subjects had 29±4 years of T1D complicated by hypoglycemia unawareness (Clarke score 6.3±0.2; HYPO score 2564±715) and received 9,648±666 islet equivalents/kg by portal vein infusion resulting in 10/12 insulin-independent with reduction in HbA1c from 7.0±0.3 to 5.6±0.1% (P<0.01) and amelioration of problematic hypoglycemia. During the final hour of the hypoglycemic clamp, plasma glucagon was PRE 33±3, POST 60±7 and NL 81±9 pg/ml (P<0.001 both vs. PRE), epinephrine was PRE 116±18, POST 253±22 and NL 380±31 pg/ml (P<0.01 both vs. PRE and NL vs. POST), free fatty acids (FFA) were PRE 50±7, POST 161±37 and NL 95±14 μM (P<0.05 both vs. PRE), EGP was PRE 0.6±0.10, POST 1.2±0.1 and NL 1.4±0.2 mg/kg per min (P<0.01 both vs. PRE), and the autonomic symptom response was PRE 2.2±1.0, POST 5.3±1.0 and NL 5.8±1.8 (P<0.1 both vs. PRE). POST levels of glucagon, epinephrine, FFA, EGP and autonomic symptoms were greater in the final hour under hypo- vs. euglycemic conditions (P<0.01 for all). These results indicate that intrahepatic islet transplantation can restore glucose counterregulation and improve hypoglycemia symptoms in long-standing T1D, and support its consideration in patients with severe hypoglycemia unawareness.\n\nThis work was performed in part as a project of the Clinical Islet Transplantation Consortium, a collaborative clinical research program headquartered at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n220\n\nLong-term Outcomes of Clinical Islet Transplantation Using Donors After Cardiac Death: A Multicenter Experience in Japan\n\nTakayuki Anazawa1,2, Akira Kenjo1,2, Takashi Kimura2, Kazuya Ise1,2, Junichiro Haga2, Sato Naoya2, Takao Tsuchiya1,2, Takuro Saito1,2, Mitsukazu Gotoh1,2\n\n1The Japan Islet Transplantation Registry, Fukushima, Japan; 2Regenerative Surgery, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima, Japan.\n\nObjective: An obstacle to generally use of islet transplantation is an insufficient supply of cadaveric pancreas. In Japan, donors after cardiac death (DCD) are not deemed suitable for whole-organ pancreas transplantation and can provide a source of pancreas for islet transplantation. However, the long-term outcomes and the utility of DCD are still controversial in the clinical setting. Here, we summarize the long-term outcomes of islet transplantation employing DCD as reported to the Japan Islet Transplantation Registry.\n\nMethods: Sixty-four islet isolations and 34 islet transplantations were performed in 18 type 1 diabetic patients under cover of immunosuppression with basiliximab, sirolimus and tacrolimus. All donors were DCD at the time of harvesting. The mean follow-up was 76 months.\n\nResults: Factors influencing islet yield included duration of low blood pressure of the donor, cold ischemic time, and usage of the ETK solution for preservation. Of the 18 recipients, 8, 4, and 6 recipients received 1, 2, and 3 islet infusions, respectively. Overall graft survival defined as C-peptide level more than or equal to 0.3 ng/ml was 72.2, 44.4, and 22.2% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively, whereas corresponding graft survival after multiple infusions was 90.0, 70.0 and 30.0%, respectively (Figure). Three of these recipients achieved insulin independence in 14, 79, and 215 days. HbA1c levels and requirement of exogenous insulin were improved before loss of graft function. All recipients became free of severe hypoglycemia unawareness, however, at least 5 patients experienced a recurrence of severe hypoglycemia after the loss of graft function.\n\nConclusion: Islet transplantation employing DCD can relieve glucose instability and problems with hypoglycemia while the graft is functioning. However, islets from DCD might be associated with reduced long-term graft survival. Further improvements in the clinical outcome by modification of islet isolation/transplantation protocol are necessary to establish islet transplantation using DCD.\n\n221\n\nCost Analysis of Whole Pancreas Transplant Versus Islet Transplant in Adults With Type One Diabetes (T1D).\n\nSara Moassesfar, Umesh Masharani, Lynda Frassetto, Greg Szot, Joan McElroy, Marissa Ramos, Kristina Johnson, Peter Stock, Andrew Posselt\n\n1Pediatrics/Endocrinology, UCSF, San Francisco, CA, United States; 2Medicine/Endocrinology, UCSF, San Francisco, CA, United States; 3Medicine/Nephrology, UCSF, San Francisco, CA, United States; 4Surgery/Transplant, UCSF, San Francisco, CA, United States.\n\nBackground: Advances in manufacturing and immunosuppression have made islet transplantation alone (ITA) a viable alternative to pancreas transplant alone (PTA) in non-uremic patients with T1D. Compared to PTA, ITA is associated with additional manufacturing and processing costs; however, these expenses may be offset by a simpler procedure, shorter hospitalization, and fewer complications requiring readmission. Here, we compare costs of ITA vs. PTA at our institution in nonuremic patients with T1D.\n\nMethods: A retrospective chart review was performed to compare total hospitalization costs for 10 ITA to 11 PTA performed during a similar period. Total costs included organ acquisition and preparation/processing, transplant procedure, initial hospitalization, and medications.\n\nResults: The organ procurement fee in our region is $37,847/pancreas. 15 organs were processed to yield 14 clinically suitable islet preparations for transplantation into 10 recipients, giving an average clinical islet preparation cost of $32,571/organ. Mean total hospitalization, procedure and medication cost for ITA was $19,243/patient (average admission of 6 days). Thus, the total cost of each islet transplant was $89,661/ patient. Four of 10 patients required second transplants, thereby doubling the total cost for these patients to $179,322/patient. Together, the average total cost for this entire group was $125,525/patient. All ITA patients became insulin independent after final islet transplant. For PTA, the average total cost (organ procurement, transplant, hospitalization, and medications) was $127,050.50 (average admission of 12 days).\n\nConclusion: With improvements in islet processing and immunosuppression, insulin independence after one transplant is increasing, and thus, overall costs are reduced. In patients who are insulin independent after one islet transplant, the total cost is lower than PTA. In patients who require two islet infusions for insulin independence, the cost is substantially greater than that of PTA. Additional hospitalizations related to post-surgical complications and/or rejection may result in further expenses for PTA compared to ITA.\n\n222\n\nIslet Allotransplantation in Type 1 Diabetes: Phase 2 Pilot Study with CXCL8 Inhibitor (reparixin).\n\nPaola Maffi1, Luisa Daffonchio2, Pier Adelchi Ruffini2, Marcello Allegretti2, Antonio Citro3, Paola Magistretti1, Raffaella Melzi3, Alessia Mercalli3, Rita Nano3, Valeria Sordi3, Antonio Secchi1, Lorenzo Piemonti3\n\n1Internal Medicine - Transplant Unit- Diabetes Research Institute, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy; 2Research and Development Department, Dompè s.p.a., L’ Aquila, Italy; 3Biology of beta cell - Diabetes Research Institute, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.\n\nBackground: Islet transplantation is actually considered a standard therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes who meet specific criteria of inclusion. The immunosuppressive therapy is by now supported by anti inflammatory strategies. CXCL8 inhibitor (reparixin), demonstrated in animal models efficacy in improving engraftment and delaying rejection after intrahepatic islet transplantation.\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate whether reparixin may improve clinical outcome of islet transplantation in humans.\n\nMethods: Patients recruited for the study were randomly assigned to receive either no intervention (control-group) or reparixin treatment (Rep-group) by continuous i.v. infusion for 7 days starting 12 hours before islet infusion. The immunosuppressive regimen was: ATG (started 12 hours before islet infusion), FK506 for 3 months then sirolimus, micophenolate mophetile. The islets were infused in the liver.\n\nResults: The results were analyzed in terms of islet function: early failure (c-peptide lost within 4 weeks); partial function (continuous c-peptide secretion ≥ 0.3 ng/mL); full function (insulin independence). Control-group: 3 patients were enrolled; islet equivalent/kg infused were 4529±398. In all cases early failure was observed after 35, 27, 26 days. Consequently the randomization was stopped and only Rep-group was completed. Rep-group: 6 patients were enrolled; islet equivalent/kg infused were 4911+897. 4/6 patients reached partial function, 2/6 patients had early failure, 28 and 32 days after islet infusion respectively. 3/4 patients who reached partial function became insulin independent after the 2nd infusion. They have been maintaining this condition since 16, 13, 5 months respectively, with glycaeted hemoglobin < 6.0%.\n\nConclusions: Only Rep-group patients, and not control-group, reached stable islet function after 1st infusion: thereafter, subjects who achieved insulin independence after 2nd infusion, kept that condition firm with excellent metabolic control.\n\n223\n\nHepatic Steatosis After Intraportal Islet After Kidney (IAK), Islet Tranplantation Alone (ITA) and Islet Auto Tranplantation (IAT) in 108 Patients: Prognostic Value Of Ultrasound On Clinical Outcome\n\nMassimo Venturini1, Querques Giulia1, Paola Maffi2, Giulia Agostini1, Lorenzo Piemonti3, Paola Magistretti2, Alessandro Del Maschio1, Antonio Secchi2\n\n1Radiology, Scietific Institute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy; 2Internal Medicine - Transplant Unit, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy; 3Biology of beta cell, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.\n\nEngrafted islets produce insulin within the liver and can potentially restore euglycemia. Hepatic steatosis is a consequence of islet engraftment and can be determined by local insulin production, lipolysis inhibition, and lipogenesis stimulation. It was curiously found only in a limited number of patients and it’s meaning is controversial. The aim of this study was to assess steatosis at Ultrasound after islet allo- and auto-transplantation, investigating its relationship with graft function and its role in predicting clinical outcome.\n\nMaterials and Methods: From 1992 to 2012, 108 patients underwent islet transplantation (33 IAK, 50 ITA, 25 IAT). Ultrasound was performed at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months, recording steatosis prevalence, first detection, duration, and distribution. Contemporaneously steatosic (S) and non-steatosic (NS) patients were compared for the following parameters: infused islet mass, insulin independence rate, ß-score, C-peptide, glycated hemoglobin, exogenous insulin requirement, and fasting plasma glucose.\n\nResults: Steatosis was found in 21/108 patients: in 20/83 (24%) allotransplanted and 1/25 (4%) autotransplanted patients, mostly detected at 6 and 12 months (18 cases). Infused islet mass was significantly higher in S than NS patients (IE/kg: S=10.822; NS=6.138). When metabolic parameters were considered, S patients showed worse basal conditions (ß-score: S=1.7 ± 1.6; NS=2.8 ± 2.8), but better islet function at the time of steatosis first detection (ß-score: S=3.9 ± 2.0; NS=2.9 ± 2.3), after which progressive islet exhaustion, along with steatosis disappearance, was observed. Conversely, in NS patients these parameters remained stable in time.\n\nConclusions: Steatosis seems to be related to islets’ mass and local overworking activity. It precedes metabolic alterations and can predict graft’s dysfunction, addressing therapeutic decisions before islet exhaustion occurs. Therefore ultrasound can be considered an important tool in the diagnosis of graft exhaustion and its frequent application is recommended during follow-up.\n\n224\n\nLong Term Outcomes of Total Pancreatectomy and Islet Auto Transplantation in Children\n\nSrinath Chinnakotla1,2, Bellin Melena2, Sarah Jane Schwarzenberg2, Marie Cook1,2, David Radosevich1, Barbara Bland1, Josh Wilhelm1, Balamurugan Appakalai1, Bernhard Hering1, Ty Dunn1, Beilman Gregory1, Selwyn Vickers1, Martin Freeman3, Timothy Pruett1,2, David Sutherland1\n\n1Surgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States; 2Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States; 3Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States.\n\nObjectives: To evaluate long-term outcomes after Total-Pancreatectomy and Intra-portal Islet-Auto-Transplantation (TP-IAT) in children. Methods: Between 1989-2011, 54 children (ages 5-18yrs, mean=13yrs) underwent TP-IAT. All were narcotic dependent (mean ± SEM 8.0±0.6 years-of-pain) and had failed endoscopic-management and/or direct-pancreatic-surgery. Primary etiology of pancreatitis was hereditary (Genetic mutations-PRSS1). QoL was measured using the SF-36 in a subset (n=22).\n\nResults: Post TP-IAT, 90% of the children were narcotic-free with sustained-pain-relief; over 50% were insulin independent (Figure 1). By multivariate-analysis, younger-recipients, and those transplanted with total-Islet-Equivalents/ Kg Body Weight >1500, were significantly more likely to achieve insulin-independence (Table I). Pre-procedure, >80% had frequent school-absences because of health; within 12 months of TP-IAT, 10% (p<.001). Post-procedure, there was also a significant decrease in # days per month that total activity was limited (p<.0.005). There was a significant improvement from baseline, by SF-36, in physical-and mental-component QoL scores (p <0.001), achieving normal-levels. None of the children developed pancreatic-cancer, or had direct complications due to the intra-portal-islet-location.\n\nConclusions: TP-IAT in children provides long-term pain-relief (90%) and preservation of beta-cell-function (>50%). Children with chronic-painful-pancreatitis due to genetic-mutations with a high-life-time risk of pancreatic cancer should be considered earlier for TP-IAT as younger-children are more likely to achieve insulin independence.\n\n225\n\nEarly Treatment with Etanercept and Anakinra Prevents Islet Graft Damage in Clinical Islet Autotransplantation\n\nBashoo Naziruddin1, Morihito Takita2, Faisal Kunnathodi2, Rauf Shahbazov2, Kanak Mazhar3, Michael Lawrence2, Nicholas Onaca1, Marlon Levy1\n\n1Baylor Annette C. and Harold C. Simmons Transplant Institute, Dallas, TX, United States; 2Islet Cell Laboratory, Baylor Research Institute, Dallas, TX, United States; 3Institute of Biomedical Studies, Baylor University, Waco, TX, United States.\n\nBackground: Total pancreatectomy followed by autologous islet transplantation (TP-AIT) is an effective treatment for refractory chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients. Peri-transplant inflammation can damage islet engraftment. We have employed blockage of TNF-α alone or in combination with IL-1β to improve islet engraftment in patients undergoing TP-AIT.\n\nMethods: A total of 12 CP patients with TP-AIT were analyzed. Etanercept (TNFα antagonist; 25 mg subcutaneous injection [s.c.] on day 0, 1, 4 and 7) was given to 5 patients (single blockage: [SB] group). Another 7 patients were administered Anakinra (IL-1β blocker; 100 mg s.c. on day 0 to 7) additionally (double blockage [DB] group). There was no significant difference in pre-transplant basic characteristics (Table 1). Islet damage was assessed by proinsulin release along with serum proinflammatory cytokine profiles.\n\nResults: No significant adverse events were observed in both groups. Proinsulin levels in early post-AIT was higher in SB group compared to DB group suggesting islet damage (p = 0.05, Figure 1). DB group had lower TNF-α levels with significant difference at 3 hour-post IAT when compared to SB group. Proinflammatory cytokines of IP-10 and MCP-1, and anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels were inversely regulated between two groups during peri-transplant period.\n\nConclusions: Double blockage of TNFα and IL-1β offers safe and better protection than blockade of TNFα alone from inflammatory reaction during the peri-transplant period in TP/AIT. This approach warrants further study on long-term auto-islet survival and function, and may have applications in allogeneic transplants as well.\n\n226\n\nAutoislet Cell Therapy Product Manufacturing with Intact Versus Truncated Collagenases I and II Combined with Neutral Protease\n\nMukesh Tiwari1, Josh J. Wilhelm1, Melena D. Bellin1, David M. Radosevich2, Gopalakrishnan Loganathan1, Sajjad M. Soltani1, Ty B. Dunn2, Srinath Chinnakotla2, Timothy L. Pruett2, Greg J. Beilman2, Bernhard J. Hering1,2, A.N. Balamurugan1,2\n\n1Schulze Diabetes Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States; 2Department of Surgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States.\n\nBackground: Islet autotransplants are increasingly performed for the prevention of surgical diabetes in patients undergoing total pancreatectomy for the treatment of refractory pain associated with chronic pancreatitis. It will therefore be important to optimize and validate the quality of autoislet cell therapy products. Several new tissue-dissociating enzymes have become available in recent years for human islet isolation. Here we compare the effects of intact (IC) versus truncated (TC) Clostridium histolyticum (Ch) collagenases (C) I and II combined with the same Ch neutral protease on islet yield, islet viability, and post-transplant recipient serum C-peptide levels.\n\nMethods: Islet yields and viability were studied in 290 autoislet products; 120 (41.4%) of which were processed with TC between 2007 and 2009 and 170 (58.6%) were manufactured with IC between 2009 and 2012 using a standard operating procedure for islet isolation. Posttransplant C-peptide (stimulated serum C-peptide responses 90 minutes after standardized mixed meal) were studied in recipients of autoislets processed with TC (n=85) and IC (n=53). Isolation yield and viability were analyzed by univariate analysis and the results presented as mean ± SEM. General and generalized mixed model methods were used for the clinical outcomes analysis of mean stimulated c-peptide values at different time points (3, 6, and 12 months).The values were adjusted for enzyme type, timing, and mutual interaction for statistical comparison.\n\nResults: The pancreases were more fibrotic in the intact CI/II compared with the TC group (6.1 vs. 5.1, p<0.001); nevertheless pancreases processed with IC showed higher digest islet equivalents [IEQ] (306,373 vs. 239,674; p<0.001), % digested pancreas (84.1 vs. 81.2; p=0.030), digest IEQ/gm pancreas (4,487 vs. 3,908; p=0.064), transplanted IEQ (274,053 vs. 212,641; p<0.001), and transplanted IEQ/kg body weight (4,215 vs. 3,269; p<0.001) than pancreases dissociated with TC. The collagenase dose [Wunsch units/gm] used (27.2 vs. 35.8; p=0.002) and proportion of % embedded islet tissue (37.0 vs. 46.2; p=0.003) were lower in the IC compared to the TC group. Islet viability (FDA/PI) in the two groups was similar (89.6 vs. 90.8; p=0.196). The trajectory of change for mean C-peptide (ng/ml) values in both recipient groups at 3 months (2.4 vs. 2.7), 6 months (3.1 vs. 2.6) and 12 months (3.2 vs. 2.4) favored IC over TC (p=0.014) (see table and figure below).\n\nConclusion: These results suggest that higher autoislet yields and higher post-transplant C-peptide levels in autoislet recipients can be achieved with IC than with TC. More detailed analyses of posttransplant islet autograft functions are currently underway.\n\nReferences:\n\nBalamurugan AN, Loganathan G, Bellin MD, Wilhelm JJ, Harmon J, Anazawa T, Soltani SM, Radosevich DM, Yuasa T, Tiwari M, Papas KK, McCarthy R, Sutherland DE, Hering BJ.

Balamurugan2, Susan Parazzoli3, Elizabeth Oseid3, Ty Dunn2, Gregory Beilman2, David Sutherland2, R. Paul Robertson3\n\n1Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States; 2Surgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States; 3Pacific Northwest Diabetes Research Institute, Seattle, WA, United States.\n\nSuccessful intrahepatic autoislet transplantation after total pancreatectomy (TP-IAT) for chronic, painful pancreatitis can prevent diabetes and provide normal HbA1c levels for many years. However, our recent clinical experience has revealed a high prevalence of hypoglycemia after TP-IAT, especially following exercise and high carbohydrate meals. To examine whether intrahepatic alpha cell function is normal, we examined glucagon responses to intravenous arginine (AGRarg) and during hypoglycemic clamps (GLGNhypo) in TP-IATsubjects with a normal hemoglobin A1c level at 5.7 ± 5.1 years post-transplant (range 1.7-21 years).\n\nAll subjects had intact AGRarg (45 +/- 14, pg/ml, n=11, p<0.001 for stimulated vs basal level). However, the glucagon response to hypoglycemia was markedly defective in 11 intrahepatic autologous islet transplant recipients (GLGNhypo: 7 +/- 4, n=11 vs. Controls: 77 +/- 16, n=7; p<0.001). In marked contrast, 3/3 TP-IAT subjects who received autoislets intraperitoneally as well as intrahepatically had normal glucagon responses to hypoglycemia (72 +/- 14) at 4-7 years post-transplant. We also measured C-peptide levels during the clamps to ascertain whether the normal decline in beta cell secretion during hypoglycemia had occurred to provide the “switch-off” signal that is essential for hypoglycemia-induced glucagon secretion. All subjects with intrahepatic islets developed nearly non-detectable C-peptide levels that were equivalent to those observed in normal controls subjects undergoing the clamp.\n\nThese data in humans confirm previous observations in animals that the defective alpha cell response to hypoglycemia in autoislets is transplant site-specific for the liver. Transplanting a portion of the islets in an extra-hepatic site preserves the counter-regulatory glucagon response during hypoglycemia and may protect against post-transplant hypoglycemia. The preserved glucagon response >4 years post-transplant suggests the potential for longevity of islets in the peritoneal cavity.\n\n228\n\nRobotic Total Pancreatectomy with Autologous Islet Transplant: The First 6 Cases\n\nCarlos Alberto Galvani1,1,2,3, Julia Samame1,2,3, Horacio Rodriguez Rilo1,2,3, Rainer Gruessner1,2,3\n\n1Surgery/Minimally Invasive & Robotic Surgery, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States; 2Surgery/Institute for Cellular Transplantation, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States; 3Surgery/Transplant, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.\n\nBackground: Total pancreatectomy with autologous islet transplant (TP-AIT) is the rationale treatment for patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and chronic pain syndrome refractory to conservative management. Robotic assistance can help surgeons to overcome some of the technical challenges of complex pancreatic procedures using standard laparoscopy and may extend the acceptance and indication of TP-AIT.\n\nOur objective is to report our initial experience of totally robotic TP-AIT and describe the surgical technique.\n\nMethod: This is a retrospective analysis of the first 5 cases of totally robotic TP-AIT at our institution from July 2012 and February 2013.\n\nA 5 trocars technique was used. The pancreas was removed through a Pfannenstiel incision. The reconstruction entailed a hand-sewn end-to-side hepatico-jejunostomy; a side-to-side duodeno-jejunostomy with a modified Braun stapled jejuno-jejunostomy. The islets were infused with an 18-gauge laparoscopic needle in the stump of the splenic vein.\n\nResults: There were 4 females and 2 males. The mean age of the patients was 41 (22-58) years; mean BMI was 23.9 (18.5-30.1) kg/m2. There were no conversions to either laparoscopic or open surgery. The mean time for robotic total pancreatectomy was 321±37min. The mean time for the reconstruction was 143±22min. Average operative time from incision to closure, including autoislet isolation process and infusion was 717±81.6min (612-835). Splenectomy was required in 2 of 5 patients. Estimated blood loss was 575±178mL (300-800). One patient requiered blood transfusion. No major procedure-related morbidity was observed. The median hospital stay was 11 days. Patients were successfully weaning off narcotics at an average of a month after surgery. Islet isolation results were: total autoislet count 141,167± 62,747; IE 140,570±70,191; IE/Kg 1848±1202. Discharge glargine insulin was 20±29 units/day.\n\nConclusion: This early experience demonstrates that fully robotic-assisted TP-AIT appears to be a feasible and safe technique for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis. The robotic approach is advantageous since allows for safe vascular dissection and digestive tract reconstruction. However, initially, longer operative times are expected due to the complexity of the procedure.\n\n229\n\nImpact of Pancreatic Bacterial Colonization on Autologous Islet Transplantation\n\nLinda Langman1, Nate Sarbin1, Farah Mukheef1, Preeti Chhabra1, Avinash Agarwal1, Brayman Kenneth1\n\n1Surgery, University of Virginia, Charlottevsille, VA, United States.\n\nObjective: Patients with chronic pancreatitis who have undergone stenting or drainage procedures may have bacterial colonization of the organ. Implications of chronic colonization in the setting of subsequent autologous islet transplantation are unclear. The objective of this analysis is to correlate pancreatic bacterial culture data with outcomes in patients receiving autologous islet transplants. Between 2007 and 2012, 19 patients underwent pancreatectomy with islet cell isolation for treatment of their chronic pancreatitis and associated chronic pain. Pancreata were surgically removed and sent to the islet processing facility. Islets were isolated using the standard Ricordi method, purified using Biocoll gradients, washed and loaded for transplant. Release criteria, including endotoxin testing and gram stains, were completed prior to transplantation. When positive cultures were reported, blood cultures were collected and appropriate antibiotics were given. Process safety was assured by confirming similar infectious agents in the transport solution and final product.\n\nResults: Of 19 autologous isolations, six were identified with positive bacterial cultures within 24 hours post-transplant. No patient transplanted with contaminated islet preparations became septic and no hepatic sequelae were observed. However, pancreata which were colonized yielded significantly lower number of IEQs (105416± 103136 IEQs vs. 243,500±119862; p=0.02) 0 of 5 patients receiving islets from colonized pancreata became insulin free compared to 9 of 13 (69%) of the non-colonized cohort (p = 0.02) at mean follow up of 35±13 months. Average insulin requirement in the colonized group was 36units/day whereas the non-colonized group required 3 - 8units of insulin/day post-transplant.\n\nConclusions: The data suggest that despite the presence of bacterial colonization of the pancreas, no infectious complications followed autologous islet cell transplantation. The presence of bacteria correlated with poorer islet cell yield. Colonization of the pancreata most likely represents further progression of the disease state and increased loss of islet cell mass.\n\nFocus to Cure Diabetes Foundation\n\n230\n\nResults from 55 Open and Robot-assisted Pancreatectomies with Autologous Islet Transplantation for the Prevention of Surgically Induced Diabetes\n\nHoracio Rilo, Monica Delbridge1, Manuel Beltran del Rio1, Galvani Carlos1, Abbas Rana1, Marian Porubsky1, Angelika Gruessner1, Rainer Gruessner1\n\n1Surgery, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.\n\n55 (35F/20M) patients, diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, underwent total pancreatectomy with autologous islet transplant (TP/AIT) at University of Arizona Medical Center between August 2009 and April 2013. Average age at the time of transplant was 42, (range 20-66). Preoperative BMI ranged from 16-50 (mean/median 26). 73% were diagnosed with idiopathic disease, 16% hereditary and 11% alcohol induced (all male). 17% of female patients and 15% of male patients presented with hereditary pancreatitis. Years between diagnosis and TP/AIT ranged from 1-36 (mean 7/median 9). 46 (84%) patients underwent total pancreatectomy, 8 patients underwent completion and 1 patient underwent partial pancreatectomy. Prior to TP/AIT, 52 (95%) presented with a surgical history of previous intervention that included 80% who presented with previous abdominal surgeries; 15% had undergone a Whipple procedure, and 56% had prior and often multiple ERCPs with stent placement. 62% of patients presented with severe systemic disease as defined by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification 3, 36% were ASA 2 and 2% ASA 1. Preoperatively, 53 patients presented with normal HbA1c (< 6.4%). HbA1c ranged from 4.6-7.3 (mean/median 5.6); however, preoperative continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) reflected abnormalities in 91% of patients despite normal HbA1c. Positive correlation was shown between CGM results and HbA1c (p < 0.01). Transplanted islet equivalents by body weight (IEQ/kg) ranged 10-17,770 (mean 3,227). Following TP/AIT 19% of patients were insulin-independent (between 1-24 months), 27% required ≤ 9 units insulin per day, 23% 10-25 and 31% ≥ 25. Postoperative length of hospitalization (LOS) ranged 6-26 days with 26% of patients’ LOS 11 (median). ICU days ranged 1-12 (mean/median 4). 27% of patients remained 5 days in ICU. 100% of patients experienced preoperative pain and were treated with opioid analgesics. Following AIT, 71% were pain-free and no longer required analgesics at 12 months postoperatively.\n\n232\n\nThe impact of HLA DR3/DR4 Matching on Outcome in T1DM Recipients\n\nAngelika Gruessner1, Gruessner Rainer1\n\n1University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States.\n\nAs with most autoimmune diseases, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is associated with genes within the major histocompatibility complex. The prevalence of class II antigens DR3, DR4, DQ2 and DQ8 is increased. We studied the outcome and possibility for recurrence of disease in recipients based on class II antigen matching.\n\n8,292 primary deceased donor SPKs were analyzed. The diagnosis was T1DM in 93%. A multivariate Cox-regression analysis was performed to analyze outcome of pancreas and kidney graft function for T1DM and T2DM patients, adjusting for a multitude of recipient and donor risk factors and several immunosuppressive protocols.\n\nThe expression of DR3/DR4 and DQ2/DQ8 was significantly different between T1DM and T2DM transplant recipients: 86% of T1DM but only 63% of T2DM carried a DR3 and/or DR4 antigen (p<0.001). In addition a significant correlation between DR3 and DQ2 and DR4 and DQ8 was found.\n\nThe 5-year graft function rate in T1DM recipients was 81% for 0, 83% for 1, and 73% for 2 DR3/4 matches (p=0.001). For the simultaneous kidney graft, the respective 5-year survival rates were 79%, 81% and 88%.\n\nSince we were looking for long-term outcome te reasons for failed matched outcomes was either ’chronic rejection’ or ’reason unknown’. Only in a few cases was the reason ’Recurrence of disease’ given.\n\nThe multivariate analysis confirmed that for the pancreas graft in T1DM recipients either one DR3 or one DR4 antigen match did not increase the relative risk for graft loss. In contrast, matching for both DR3 and DR4 increased the risk of graft loss by 77% (p=0.02). This finding was not noted in T2DM transplant recipients. In the simultaneous kidney graft, a negative impact of DR matching in both T1DM and T2DM transplant recipients was not observed. In contrast, there was a trend to better kidney graft function in DR matched patients.\n\nMatching for both DR3 and DR4 in SPK recipients with T1DM should be avoided to improve pancreas graft survival. Histopathology studies are necessary to prove an increased risk of disease recurrence.\n\n233\n\nSplenic Vein Thrombosis Following Pancreas Transplantation: Identification of Factors that Support Conservative Management\n\nJack Harbell1,2, Garrett Roll1,2, Tara Morgan1,2, Vickie A. Feldstein1,2, Andrew Posselt1,2, Sang-Mo Kang1,2, Sandy Feng1,2, Ryutaro Hirose1,2, Chris E. Freise1,2, Peter Stock1,2\n\n1Department of Surgery, Division of Transplantation, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States; 2Department of Radiology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.\n\nIntroduction: Prophylaxis for graft venous thrombosis following pancreas transplant varies between institutions. Similarly, treatment of venous thrombosis ranges from urgent thrombectomy to conservative management with anticoagulation. In this study we wished to determine the prevalence of graft splenic vein (SV) thombosis, as well as the clinical significance of non-occlusive thrombus observed on routine imaging.\n\nMethods: Records of 112 pancreas transplant recipients from January 1st, 2008 to December 31st, 2012 at a single center were reviewed. All patients received aspirin prior to surgery, and aspirin and dipyridimole post-operatively. Non-dialysis dependent patients also received a bolus of intravenous (IV) heparin (2000-4000 units) at the time of vascular anastomosis. Post-operative anticoagulation was surgeon specific, but usually included low dose heparin infusion (200-400 units/hr) for 24-48h after surgery. Venous thrombosis was defined as absence of flow or presence of thrombus identified in any part of the graft SV on ultrasound. Patients with SV thrombus were anticoagulated with IV heparin in addition to anti-platelet therapy, then transitioned to warfarin for 3-6 months or until documented thrombus resolution.\n\nResults: 30 patients (27%) had thrombus or absence of flow in the SV on post-operative ultrasound. There were 4 graft losses in this group. All were due to arterial and venous thrombosis, and all occurred within 20 days of transplant. Graft losses occurred in dialysis dependent and independent recipients (2 SPK, 1 PAK, 1 PTA). Patients identified to have partial SV thrombus but normal arterial signal on ultrasound were all successfully treated conservatively with IV heparin followed by warfarin for 3-6 months, and remained insulin independent. Seven patients with ultrasound findings of graft swelling and abnormal arterial waveforms with reversal of diastolic flow were taken emergently to the operating room for thrombectomy. Two of those patients were found to have no thrombus at exploration, one patient underwent successful venous thrombectomy, one patient had a successful venous thrombectomy initially but lost the graft 19 days later due to arterial and venous thrombosis, and 3 were found to have graft necrosis and underwent graft pancreatectomy.\n\nConclusion: In the absence of graft swelling and arterial signal abnormalities on ultrasound, non-occlusive thrombosis of the pancreas graft SV can be successfully treated conservatively with anticoagulation. Findings of graft swelling and arterial signal abnormalities, such as reversal of diastolic flow within the graft, require urgent operative intervention, since this finding can be associated with more extensive thrombus that may lead to graft loss.\n\n234\n\nOutcomes of Pancreas Transplantation from Marginal Donors in Japan\n\nToshinori Ito1,2\n\n1The Japan Registry of Pancreas Transplantation, The Japan Society for pancreas & Islet transplantation, Suita, Osaka, Japan; 2Complementary & Alternative Medicine, Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.\n\nIntroduction: Absolute shortage of donors in Japan still continues even after the law allowing organ transplantation from brain-dead donors came into force in 1997. With the passage of the waiting period after registration for pancreas transplantation (PTx), both deaths and serious cases of diabetic complications necessitating withdrawal of the registration have undoubtedly increased. Therefore, as potential solutions, so-called “marginal donors (MD)” as well as living donors have been considered in Japan.\n\nMethods: A total number of 148 PTx (119;SPK, 20;PAK, 9;PTA) was performed from deceased donors except for 2 non-heart-beating donors in Japan from 2000 to 2012. “MD” are defined as follows :1) >45 years old; 2) hemodynamically unstable at harvest using a high-dose dopamine (>10g) or > two vasopressors; 3) non-heart-beating status.\n\nResults: The mean age of donors was 43.4 years (50% >45 years). The most common cause of brain death was CVA (58.9%) followed by trauma (18.9%). Thus, 108 donors (73.0%) meeting at least one of three conditions above were marginal. Pancreas grafts were lost in 15 cases during 3 months posttransplant (8;thrombosis, 3; sepsis, 2;rejection, 1;cardiogenic, 1;bleeding). Early graft loses were significantly higher in male donors and TCIT >12 hours, but not in marginal cases. Patient survival was 94.8% at 1, 3, and 5 years. Pancreas graft survival was 84.8%, 76.4% and 68.9% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Kidney graft survival in SPK recipients was 90.2%, 90.2%, and 82.8% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Pancreas graft survival in the marginal vs non-marginal group was 80.9% vs 92.5%, 73.2% vs 85.2%, and 66.0% vs 77.4% at 1, 2, and 5 years post-transplantation, respectively.\n\nConclusion: There was no significant difference of pancreas graft survival between marginal and non-marginal group, but further investigations are necessary to clarify factors in marginal donors that contribute to better outcomes.\n\nThe Japan Registry of Pancreas Transplantation\n\n235\n\nPortal Versus Systemic Venous Drainage of Pancreatic Graft: The Effect on Glucose Metabolism in Pancreas and Kidney Transplant Recipients\n\nTereza Havrdova1, Saudek Frantisek1, Teodora Jedinakova1, Kvetoslav Lipar1, Matej Kocik1, Jelena Skibova1\n\n1Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic.\n\nBackground and Aims: Two different methods of graft venous drainage are used in pancreas transplantation: portal (PVD) and systemic (SVD). PVD is considered as more physiologic due to similarity to venous outflow of the native pancreas. The aim of our study was to compare glucose metabolism in Type 1 diabetic recipients of kidney and pancreatic grafts with PVD versus SVD.\n\nMethods: We examined 28 insulin-independent patients after simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation: 14 recipients with PVD of the pancreatic graft and 14 ones with SVD after a mean post transplant period of 1 year. All recipients had a stable good function of the kidney graft. Fasting glycemia, insulin levels, HbA1c, a standard IVGTT with coefficient of glucose assimilation (KG) calculation were assessed. Insulin sensitivity and production were evaluated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR, HOMA-B). Total C-peptide and insulin secretions were calculated as areas under the curves from the serum levels during the IVGTT.\n\nResults: PVD and SVD groups did not differ in age, BMI, duration of post transplant period, fasting C-peptide level. We did not find any significant difference in response of IVGTT. In the PVD group 1 patient had an abnormal response to the glucose stimulus, 8 patients had an impaired glucose tolerance and 5 patients had a normal glucose tolerance. In the SVD group an abnormal response was present in none, the impaired glucose tolerance in 4 and the normal glucose tolerance in 10 recipients. Mean KG was 1.24 ± 0.5 %/min. in the PVD group and 1.55 ± 0.5 %/min. in the SVD group (NS). The remaining results are shown in the following table.\n\nConclusion: Though this was not a prospectively randomized trial, we conclude that the change of surgical technique from SVD to PVD did not lead to any substantial change in terms of glucose tolerance.\n\nSupported by MH CZ - DRO (“Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine – IKEM, IN 00023001”)\n\n236\n\nSimilar Results with Solitary Pancreas Compared to Simultaneous Kidney-Pancreas Transplantation in the New Millennium\n\nJeffrey Rogers1, Alan Farney1, Samy Iskandar1, Giuseppe Orlando1, Umar Farooq1, Yousef Al-Shraideh1, Amber Reeves-Daniel1, Amudha Palanisamy1, William Doares1, Kaczmorski Scott1, Gautreaux Michael1, Robert J. Stratta 1\n\n1Wake Forest University, School of Medicine, Wiston-Salem, United States.\n\nIntroduction: The majority (75%) of pancreas transplants (PTxs) are performed as simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplants (SKPT) whereas approximately 16% are performed as sequential PTx after kidney (PAK) and 9% as PTx alone (PTA). The latter two categories are usually combined together as solitary PTxs and historically have had inferior outcomes compared to SKPT. The purpose of this study was to analyze our single center outcomes according to PTx category in the new millennium.\n\nMethods: We retrospectively studied 202 consecutive PTxs in 192 patients (pts) at our center. All pts received either r-ATG or alemtuzumab induction in combination with FK/MPA and tapered steroids or early steroid withdrawal. 179 PTxs (89%) were performed with portal-enteric and 23 with systemic-enteric drainage. All pts were both T and B cell negative by flow cytometry crossmatch. Solitary PTxs were managed with routine peri-operative anti-coagulation whereas SKPTs received selective anti-coagulation. Surveillance PTx biopsies were performed in solitary PTxs whereas clinical biopsies were prompted by biochemical and clinical parameters in all pts.\n\nResults: From 11/01 to 3/13, we performed 162 SKPTs, 35 PAK and 5 PTA (40 solitary PTxs).\n\nDemographic characteristics for SKPT vs solitary PTxs were mostly comparable; however, the solitary PTx group had fewer HLA mismatches (SKPT mean 4.5 ± 1.3 vs solitary PTx 3.0 ± 1.3, p<0.001), younger donors (SKPT mean 28 ± 12 vs solitary PTx 22 ± 7.6 years, p=0.004), fewer black recipients (SKPT 23% vs solitary PTx 7.5%, p=0.03), but more retransplants (SKPT 1.2% vs solitary PTx 35%, p<0.001). With a mean follow-up of 5.5 years, overall pt (87% SKPT vs 87.5% solitary PTx), kidney (74% SKPT vs 82.5% solitary PTx) and pancreas graft survival (both 65%) rates were comparable. Causes of PTx loss were also similar between SKPT and solitary PTx; the rates of early thrombosis were 8.6% and 5%, respectively. Cumulative clinical acute rejection rates were similar between groups (SKPT 29% vs solitary PTx 26%, p=NS).\n\nConclusions: In the setting of depleting antibody induction, flow crossmatch testing, HLA matching, careful donor and recipient selection, portal-enteric drainage, peri-operative anti-coagulation, FK/MPA immunosuppression, and PTx biopsy monitoring, equivalent outcomes can be achieved in SKPT and solitary PTxs in the new millennium.\n\n237\n\nExcellent Outcomes can be Achieved in Young Pancreas Transplant Alone (PTA) Recipients by using Maintenance Therapy with Sirolimus/Tacrolimus/Mycophenolate Mofetil.\n\nMarian Porubsky1, Angelika C Gruessner1, Abbas Rana1, Tun Jie1, Rainer WG Gruessner1\n\n1Department of Surgery, Division of Transplantation, University of Arizona Medical Center, Tucson, AZ, United States.\n\nContext: Pancreas transplant alone (PTA) has evolved as a viable treatment option for non-uremic patients with Type 1 DM. Historically, the results of PTA were inferior to simultaneous kidney/pancreas transplant due higher graft loss from rejection. With advances in immunosuppression (IS), the outcomes of PTA improved significantly with the exception of young PTA recipients. The more potent immune system in young recipients appears to play a key role.\n\nObjective: To investigate PTA outcome according to recipient age using different maintenance IS regimens.\n\nMethods: IPTR/UNOS information for 547 primary technically successful PTAs performed between 1/2003 and 12/ 2012 were analyzed. The recipients were divided into 3 age groups: 15 - <30 years (68 patients); 30 - <45 years (266 pts) and <45 years (213 pts). All patients received induction therapy with Thymoglobulin and steroids and were maintained on long-term low dose Prednisone. Three maintenance IS regimes were compared among each age group: (1) Tacrolimus (Tac)/Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF); (2) Sirolimus (Srl)/Tac and (3) Srl/Tac/MMF. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate graft function and the long-rank test for comparisons.\n\nResults: In the 15 - <30 years group, the 3-year graft survival rates in IS groups 1, 2 and 3 were 68%, 18% and 87% (p= 0.033). In the 30 - <45 years group, the graft survival rates were 77%, 95% and 91% (p= 0.036). In the <45 years group, the graft survival rates were 88%, 86% and 80% (p=0.4).\n\nConclusion: The addition of Srl to the standard Tac/MMF treatment provided the best outcome in the youngest group. Standard Tac/MMF provided the best outcome in the oldest group. This proves that a more potent IS regimen is required in young (and immunologically more challenging) PTA recipients to achieve excellent outcomes.\n\n238\n\nThe Physiologic Pancreas Transplant : Experience with 58 Portal-Duodenal Drained Pancreas Transplants\n\nMarcelo Perosa1,2, Huda Noujaim1,2, Luiz Ianhez1,2, Rodrigo Azevedo1,2, Waldere Luconi1,2, Leonardo Mota1,2, Juan Branez1,2, Marcio Paredes1,2, Luciano Giacaglia1, Marcos Castro1,2, Tercio Genzini1,2\n\n1Hepatology and Transplant, HEPATO, São Paulo, Brazil; 2Organ Transplantation, Bandeirantes Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil.\n\nSystemic-enteric drainage is currently the most commonly used technique in pancreas transplantation (PT). Duodenal drainage represents a new technical alternative with potential physiological benefits and improved monitoring of the pancreatic graft. We describe experience with 58 PT ( 10 simultaneous pancreas-kidney, 40 pancreas after kidney and 8 pancreas transplant alone) using portal-duodenal drainage (PDD) over the last three years. A quadruple immunosuppression protocol with thymoglobulin was used in all cases.\n\nThis technique resulted in 1-year patient, kidney and pancreas survival of 100%,100% and 90% for SPK and 1-year patient and pancreas survival of 96% and 79% for solitary PT. There were two deaths in PAK recipients due to sepsis related to the urinary tract . There were 11 pancreas losses and the causes were : thrombosis(6), immunological(3) and death with functioning graft(2). In all cases requiring transplantectomy, a two-layer closure of the native duodenum was feasible. There was one fistula from the duodenal closure after transplantectomy and a partial gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y was performed.\n\nConclusions: The PDD technique in PT seems to achieve the same good results compared to other techniques already in use, with an advantage of easy accessibility to the pancreas graft by endoscopy.\n\n240\n\nKey Components of the Human Islet Double Basement Membrane are Differentially Digested During Islet Isolation\n\nSarah Cross1, Abby Willcox1, Emma Pope1, James Johnson1, Elisa Maillar1, Paul Bateman1, Stephen Hughes1, Derek Gray1, Paul Johnson1\n\n1Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.\n\nBackground: We have an incomplete understanding of which components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) at the islet:exocrine interface are digested by collagenase blends during human islet isolation. The interface contains two basement membranes (BM), one associated with the islet capillary and the second integral to the islet itself. Maintaining integrity of BMs may be critical for optimal islet survival post-isolation. This study aimed to characterize digestion of key islet BM components in human pancreas and purified islets in culture prior to transplantation.\n\nMethods: Human pancreases were retrieved with appropriate consent and ethical approval (n=10, age 38-59, BMI 20-32, CIT <10h). 0.5cm3 pancreatic tissue biopsies were snap-frozen, then cryosectioned. Sections were treated ± Serva collagenase-NB1 and neutral protease-NB at clinically-relevant concentrations for 2 or 5 minutes at 37°C. Following double immunolabelling for insulin and potential BM proteins, expression was semi-quantified by morphometry. Following islet isolation, islet samples were collected after purification and at 24h, 48h, 72h and 7 days in culture. Islet BM proteins were identified by immunofluorescence labelling and quantified by western blotting and ELISA.\n\nResults: Collagen-IV, laminin and perlecan were identified as major islet BM components and were significantly digested after 5 minutes enzyme treatment (p <0.05 vs control). Complete dissolution of the laminin-511 isoform occurred within only 2 minutes. In purified islets laminin-511 and perlecan expression was absent. Collagen-IV and pan-laminin expression was present, yet markedly decreased during the first 24h of islet culture. Collagen-IV expression stabilised over the proceeding 48h and was present up to 7 days in culture, whereas laminin expression was lost after 72h.\n\nConclusions: Key components of the islet double BM (collagen-IV, laminin and perlecan) are substantially digested by clinically-used collagenase. Importantly, laminin-511 (the only laminin isoform found in both layers of the duplex BM) and perlecan are lost entirely, indicating extensive BM disruption resulting from the islet isolation procedure. Incomplete BM may compromise islet function and survival, as destruction of ECM can trigger integrin-mediated cell death, thereby contributing to the reduction in islet yield commonly seen following culture.\n\n241\n\nImproving Purified Islet Viability by Continuous Quadrupole Magnetic Separation (QMS)\n\nBradley P Weegman1,2, Venkata SK Sajja3, Michael D Rizzari2, Thomas M Suszynski2, William E Scott, 3rd2, Jennifer P Kitzmann2, Kate R Mueller2, Thomas R Hanley3, David J Kennedy5, Paul W Todd5,6, A.

The islet isolation and purification process requires enzymatic digestion, mechanical agitation and the use of damaging chemicals for density gradient separation (COBE), all of which inflict substantial damage reducing viable islet yield. Quadrupole magnetic sorting (QMS) during digestion has been explored as an alternative for islet purification to reduce warm ischemia, minimize enzyme exposure and eliminate the use of density gradients. We explored the use of QMS for islet purification and compared the viability of QMS and COBE purified islets. Porcine pancreata (n=3) were split into 2 parts; the combined connecting/duodenal lobe (CDL) and the splenic lobe (SPL). Islets were preferentially labeled using magnetic micro-particles (MMPs) that lodge within the islet micro-vasculature when infused into the pancreas. This allowed the continuous separation from the acinar tissue by QMS during the collection phase of the digestion process. An optimized dose [1] of MMPs (4.5 μm diameter) were infused into the splenic artery to label islets within the SPLs, which were then digested using the Ricordi method and then continuously purified by QMS. Unlabeled islets from the paired CDLs were isolated using the same method and purified using COBE. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) normalized to DNA content (OCR/DNA) was used to compare the fractional viability of islets from both groups. Islets purified by QMS exhibited significantly improved viability and better morphology relative to control islets. The mean OCR/DNA of islets purified by QMS was higher than those purified by COBE (209±25 vs. 125±11 nmol/min/mg DNA; p=0.02 via two-tailed paired student’s t test). We conclude that continuous islet purification by QMS can reduce the detrimental effects of prolonged exposure to toxic enzymes and density gradient solutions and substantially improve islet isolation efficiency and ITx success.\n\nSchulze Foundation and the Schulze Diabetes Institute, NIH (R44DK072647-03 ),The Carol Olson Memorial Diabetes Research Fund, The Iacocca, Schott, and Kettering Family Foundations, The Eunice Dwan Trust\n\nReference:\n\n[1] Rizzari MD, Suszynski TM, Kidder LS, Stein SA, O’Brien TD, Sajja VSK, Scott WE, Kirchner VA, Weegman BP, Avgoustiniatos ES, Todd PW, Kennedy DJ, Hammer BE, Sutherland DER, Hering BJ, Papas KK: Surgical protocol involving the infusion of paramagnetic microparticles for preferential incorporation within porcine islets.

Viability is to a large extent dependent on the metabolic status of the graft, which is reflected in its bioenergetic profile. 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) has previously been applied in animal models to assess graft viability. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate if 31P-MRS can be applied for viability assessment in human pancreas grafts prior to transplantation.\n\nMethods: Pancreata from five human donors were included in the study. Immediately after removal from the donor each pancreas was perfused with histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution and stored in hypothermic condition (4oC). 31P-MRS was performed on a 1.5 T clinical MR scanner. ISIS localization sequence (31P head coil, TR 3500 ms, BW 1500 Hz, 512 acquisitions) was completed with nuclear Overhauser enhancement and proton decoupling. Voxel size was ∼5×5×14 cm. The first spectra were acquired 6-9 hours after HTK perfusion of the pancreas. Subsequent spectra were obtained with a period of ∼2 hours. After 24 hours of cold preservation pancreas was exposed to room temperature during the next 24 hours and the last spectrum was measured. This spectrum served as a reference for non-viable tissue. The following metabolites were fitted: phosphomonoesters (PME), inorganic phosphate (Pi), phosphodiesters (PDE), phosphocreatine (PCr), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\n\nResults: γ-ATP and β-ATP lines decreased to the noise level within 2-4 hours after the start of 31P-MRS. PME, PDE and α-ATP levels gradually decreased and Pi increased. Non-viable pancreas tissue revealed dominant Pi and small distinguishable PME and PDE intensities.\n\nConclusion:\n\n(γ-ATP+β-ATP)/Pi, PME/Pi and PDE/Pi spectral intensity ratios obtained by 31P-MRS are promising quantitative parameters for fast and objective noninvasive assessment of the viability of human pancreas grafts.\n\n243\n\nRole of Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) in Preserving Pancreas for Islet Isolation\n\nKeiko Omori1, Eiji Kobayashi2, Jeffrey Rawson1, Naoya Kasahara2, Masafumi Takahashi3, Ismail H Al-Abdullah1, Yoko Mullen1\n\n1Southern California Islet Cell Resource Center, Department of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte, CA, United States; 2Division of Development Advanced Therapy, Center for Development of Advanced Medical Technology, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan; 3Division of Inflammation Research, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.\n\nBackground: Islet yield is influenced by prolonged pancreas cold ischemia. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in islet destruction leading to low islet yield remains obscure. The objective of this study is to investigate the AKT and Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways during prolonged pancreas preservation and examine the effectiveness of IGF-1 treatment during pancreas preservation on isolation outcome.\n\nMethods: Rat pancreata, harvested en bloc and perfused with cold UW solution containing IGF-1 (25nM) (UW+IGF-1) or UW solution alone through the aorta were preserved at 4°C for up to 18h. Biopsy samples were taken for western blot (n=3/ group). Subsequently, islets were isolated from en bloc pancreata preserved in 3 different groups; 1) 12h cold preservation with UW+IGF-1 (12h-UW+IGF-1), 2) 12h cold preservation with UW alone (12h-UW) or 3) without preservation (0h-Control), and islet number and post cultured islet viability were assessed (n=3/ group).\n\nResults: The Western blot results showed that phosphorylation of AKT, ERK, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was significantly decreased, while caspase-3 was significantly activated in the pancreata preserved for 18h in UW solution. The addition of IGF-1 in UW solution significantly reduced the dephosphorylation of AKT, ERK and STAT3 at 18h. Duration of cold preservation did not affect post isolation islet number, however, 12h cold preservation significantly decreased post cultured islet viability as compared to 0h control group (69.4±0.8 % in 12h-UW vs. 96.3±1.6 % in 0h-Control, p<0.001). This loss of viability was markedly improved by IGF-1 treatment (87.4±2.7 % in 12h-UW+IGF-1, p<0.05 vs. 12h-UW).\n\nConclusions: Our study demonstrated that IGF-1 protects islets from cold ischemia-rewarming injury promoting islet survival during culture and AKT, ERK and STAT3 are important signals during pancreas preservation maintaining viable islets.\n\n244\n\nInsulin-Independent Reversal ff Type-1 Diabetes with Brown Adipose Tissue Transplants: Involvement Of IGF-1\n\nSubhadra Gunawardana1, David Piston1\n\n1Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States.\n\nCurrent therapies for type 1 diabetes (T1D) involving insulin replacement or islet/pancreas transplantation have numerous limitations. The ultimate goal in treating T1D is to restore glucose homeostasis. Our recent work demonstrates that euglycemia can be achieved without insulin, using subcutaneous embryonic brown adipose tissue (BAT) transplants [1,2]. BAT transplants in Streptozotocin (STZ)-treated diabetic mice result in robust replenishment of white adipose tissue (WAT) and reversal of diabetes, accompanied by suppression of glucagon and progressive increases in adipokines. These effects are independent of insulin, and require new WAT to remain healthy and un-inflamed.\n\nObjectives of this study were to identify the underlying mechanisms of insulin-independent glycemic regulation following BAT transplants, and to reproduce the results in auto-immune diabetic models similar to human T1D. In nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, BAT transplants result in complete reversal of T1D associated with rapid and long-lasting euglycemia (Fig. 1). As with STZ-diabetic models, euglycemia is independent of insulin, and strongly correlates with decrease of inflammation and increase of adipokines. Mechanistic studies point to insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) as a major mediator in the new equilibrium. Plasma IGF-1 is elevated immediately following BAT transplant, prior to any increase in WAT-derived adipokines such as adiponectin and leptin. BAT transplant and surrounding WAT consistently express IGF-1 compared with little or no expression in the WAT of normal and diabetic controls. Plasma IGF-1 levels progressively increase following BAT transplants, in negative correlation with pro-inflammatory cytokines (Fig.1). IGF-1 has adipogenic and anti-inflammatory properties, and is likely to stimulate regeneration and maintenance of new healthy WAT which in turn can secrete adipokines to substitute for insulin. IGF-1 may also directly decrease blood glucose through activating the insulin receptor, since acute inhibition of insulin receptor impairs glucose tolerance in BAT transplant recipients who operate without insulin. These data suggest that IGF-1 plays several key functions in insulin-independent glucose regulation following BAT transplants.\n\n245\n\nCadherin Engagement Improves Insulin Secretion of Single Human Beta-Cells\n\nGeraldine Parnaud1, Vanessa Lavallard1, Thierry Berney1, Domenico Bosco1\n\n1Cell Isolation and Transplantation Center, Division of Surgical Research, Geneva University Hospital and University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nAim: In this study we assessed whether cadherin-mediated adhesion of human islet cells was affected by insulin secretagogues and explored the role of cadherins in the secretory activity of beta-cells.\n\nMethods: Experiments were carried out with single islet cells adherent to chimeric proteins made of functional E-, N- or P-cadherin ectodomains fused to Fc fragment of immunoglobulin (E-cad/Fc, N-cad/Fc and P-cad/Fc) and immobilized on an inert substrate. Adhesion of islet cells on these chimeric proteins was assessed in the absence of presence of insulin secretagogues and insulin secretion evaluated by reverse hemolytic plaque assay (RHPA). Beta- and alpha-cells were identified by immunofluorescence.\n\nResults: On N-cad/Fc and E-cad/Fc, islet cells time- and secretagogue-dependently acquired a spreading form. This effect was inhibited using blocking cadherin antibodies. High glucose concentration increased the spreading of beta-cells and not that of alpha-cells. By RHPA, under basal condition (2.8 mmol/l glucose) single beta-cell insulin secretions were not affected by any of the cadherin peptides. In the presence of E-cad/Fc and after glucose stimulation (16.7 mmol/l), 5-10 % single beta cells were found with a spreading form. Whereas 52±8 % round beta cells, virtually all spreading beta cells (96±5 %) were surrounded by a hemolytic plaque, p<0.001. The mean plaque area of spreading cells was about three times higher compared to that of round cells. As a consequence, total insulin secretion was 6 times higher in spreading beta cells compared to round beta cells (928078±307022 vs. 163933±54204, spreading cells vs. round cells, respectively, p=0.04).\n\nConclusion: Our results show that adhesion of beta-cells to E- and N-cadherins is regulated by insulin secretagogues and that at least E-cadherin engagement promotes stimulated insulin secretion.\n\n246\n\nNLRP3 Inflammasome is Expressed and Regulated in Human Islets\n\nVanessa Lavallard1, Géraldine Parnaud1, Philippe Morel1, Benoît Bedat1, Domenico Bosco1, Thierry Berney1\n\n1Department of Surgery, Cell Isolation and Transplantation Center, Geneva University hospital and University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nBackground and Aims: NRLP3 inflammasome is a protein complex playing an important role in innate immunity. This complex is activated in response to infection, inflammation and autoimmune processes and is involved in the maturation of IL1β by the cleavage of caspase-1. The real contribution of NRLP3 inflammasome in local islet production of IL1β has not been yet demonstrated. The aim of this study was to determine the expression and the regulation of the NRLP3 inflammasome in human islets.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Human islets were enzymatically isolated from cadaveric donor pancreases. Isolated islets were stimulated or not with 1μg/ml LPS for 4h and successively with 5mM ATP for 30 min in the presence or absence of 200μM glyburide, an inflammasome inhibitor. Secreted IL1β was quantified by ELISA. The NRLP3 and IL1β genes expressed were studied by real time PCR and caspase-1 and IL1β by western blot.\n\nResults:NRLP3 and IL1β were found to be expressed in untreated isolated human islets. In response to the LPS plus ATP treatment, NRLP3 and IL1β increased 3.4±1.05 fold (p=0.048) and 50.4±1.9 fold (p=0.011), respectively. Glyburide prevented the augmentation of NLRP3 (2.1±0.7 fold, p=0.045) and IL1β (22.2±5.01 fold, p=0.023). The LPS plus ATP treatment induced the cleavage of caspase-1 and the increase of pro and mature IL1β protein expression. Human islets secreted 38.1±1.8 pg/ml IL1β (p=0.0097) in response to LPS plus ATP. Glyburide was shown to prevent the cleavage of caspase-1, decrease the pro and mature IL1β form and diminish IL1β secretion by 97.6% (0.92±0.28 pg/ml IL1β, p=0.0079).\n\nConclusion: These results show that the NRLP3 inflammasome is expressed and regulated in human islets in response to LPS plus ATP. The NRLP3 inflammasome could be a potential therapeutic target to prevent local IL1β production and the subsequent islet damages in both diabetes and islet transplantation.\n\n250\n\nMetabolic Demand as a Barrier to Islet Allograft Tolerance Induction\n\nNicholas H. Bishop1, K. Scott Beard1, Ronald G. Gill1\n\n1Surgery and Immunology, University of Colorado, Denver, Aurora, CO, United States.\n\nBackground: Several obstacles may prevent tolerance induction in transplant recipients. While pre-existing autoimmunity is a formidable barrier to tolerance induction in Type 1 diabetes, metabolic demand / hyperglycemia itself may be an under-appreciated barrier to tolerance induction. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine whether the metabolic demand on islet transplants was an independent variable impacting tolerance resistance.\n\nMethods: We studied the independent effect recipient metabolic demand on tolerance outcomes using the Akita mouse model of severe, chronic diabetes. The Akita phenotype is the result of a spontaneous polymorphism in the ins2 gene resulting in severe, lifelong diabetes. Importantly, this form of spontaneous diabetes is not associated with autoimmunity, C57Bl/6 (B6; H-2b) Akita uniformly accept syngeneic wild-type B6 islet grafts. To illustrate the role of metabolic demand on grafted islets in this model, Akita mice received a marginal mass of 200 islets. Costimulation blockade (anti-CD154 therapy) was used to induce long-term allograft survival. Temporary peri-transplant metabolic relief was provided by a subcutaneous implantation of a slow-release insulin pellet.\n\nResults: 200 allogeneic BALB/c islets could engraft and normalize blood glucose for >100 days in 4/4 immune-deficient B6 Akita rag−/− recipients. However, the majority of BALB/c islet grafts failed to engraft in wild-type B6 Akita recipients with or without anti-CD154 therapy; only 1/9 allografts functioned > 60 days with anti-CD154 therapy. However, the provision of peri-transplant insulin treatment resulted in the engraftment of 9/9 allografts and long-term allograft survival in 4/6 animals (p < .01)\n\nConclusion: Results suggest an important interplay between metabolic demand and adaptive immunity during the peri-transplant period and the subsequent propensity for tolerance induction. We hypothesize that the degree of metabolic demand possibly related tissue distress in islet transplants can be an independent variable in determining islet allograft survival and can impact tolerance induction.\n\n251\n\nAcute Destruction of Islet Allografts in NOD Mice is Independent of Donor MHC Expression\n\nAdam Burrack1, Joshua N. Beilke2, Tinalyn Kupfer1, Ronald G. Gill1\n\n1Surgery and Immunology, University of Colorado, Denver, Aurora, CO, United States; 2Novo Nordisk Research Center, Seattle, WA, United States.\n\nBackground: There is ongoing debate regarding the relative contribution of islet-specific autoimmunity versus conventional transplant immunity in the destruction of islet allografts in autoimmune recipients. Specifically, it is unclear whether the pathways of autoimmune disease recurrence are similar to or distinct from allograft immunity. In this study, we determined whether donor MHC expression is required for disease recurrence versus allograft destruction in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice.\n\nMethods: Spontaneously diabetic NOD mice were grafted with either syngeneic NOD or allogeneic C57Bl/6 (B6) islets that were genetically deficient in MHC class I (b2m−/−), MHC class II (NOD C2ta−/− or B6 I-Ab−/−), or both MHC class I and II by using appropriate donors. In some cases, NOD recipients were depleted of CD4 or CD8 T cells in vivo with GK1.5 or 116–13.1 antibody treatment, respectively.\n\nResults: NOD rag−/− (n = 15) or MHC II-deficient (n =3) NOD islets grafts were acutely destroyed in NOD recipients. However, as shown by others, NOD MHC I-deficient or MHC I/II-deficient islets had greatly prolonged survival in untreated NOD mice (MST of 87 days; p < .01). In stark contrast, B6 islet allografts deficient in MHC class I (n=8), class II (n =6), or both (n = 6) were uniformly rejected in NOD mice in <17 days. Moreover, the destruction of B6 MHC I/II double-deficient islet allografts in NOD mice was CD4 T cell-dependent and CD8 T cell independent based on T cell depletion experiments. Interestingly, B6 MHC class I/II-deficient islets survived for >100 days in 7/7 non-autoimmune BALB/c recipients (p < .001), indicating that conventional islet allograft rejection does require donor MHC expression.\n\nConclusion: Results show a striking difference in the requirements for disease recurrence versus allograft destruction in autoimmune diabetic NOD mice. Disease recurrence requires donor MHC class I expression while allograft destruction is independent of donor MHC expression and requires CD4 T cells. We hypothesize that actual disease recurrence is primarily a CD8 T cell mediated response restricted by donor MHC class I molecules while ‘indirect’ CD4 T cell reactivity plays a predominant role in allograft rejection. In part, this exaggerated CD4 T cell response may contribute to the profound allograft tolerance resistance found in autoimmune NOD recipients.\n\n252\n\nLiver Ischemia After Islet Transplantation - Rat Animal Model\n\nJan Kriz1, Eva Fabryova2, Andrea Galisova3, Milan Hajek3, Frantisek Saudek1,2\n\n1Diabetes Center, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic; 2Center of Experimental Medicine, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic; 3Department of MR spectroscopy, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic.\n\nIntroduction: Currently the pancreatic islet (PI) transplantation (Tx) is mostly performed using the catheter inserted transcutaneously into the hepatic portal vein1. Islets embolize within peripheral branches of portal vein and can obstruct it causing ischemia of surrounding liver tissue2. This can cause necrosis of liver cells, which together with instant blood mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR), triggers the injury of islet cells3. The intensity of IBMIR and the size of liver ischemia correlate to the expression of tissue factor (TF) on islet cells4. The research of TF inhibition and subsequent reduction of IBMIR need the method for quantification of liver non-perfused tissue5. The main aim of this study was the proper modification of PI Tx model and the optimization of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol for detection of non-perfused regions of liver.\n\nMethods: The Brown-Norway rats (n=15, 250-320g) served as PI or artificial particles recipients. While recipients of group-A remained intact, animals of group-B underwent ligation of hepatic arteries. 200/2000 of PI or 200/2000 artificial particles (heparin coated or non-coated; Corline, Sveden) were transplanted into the portal vein and spontaneously embolized within recipient liver. Two and 48 hours after Tx recipients were examined visually and by MRI. T1-weighted images were acquired by gradient echo sequence (resolution 234mm/234mm/1500mm) before and after the MultiHance® (60 ml) administration. Immediately after the first MRI, the PatentBlau® dye was injected into portal vein of two animals in both groups.\n\nResults: The Patent-Blau® has confirmed the presence of non-perfused regions in periphery of the de-arterialized livers, considerably more frequent in recipient of 2000 PIs or particles. In animals of group-A the non-colored regions were not visible. Two hours after PI Tx the MRI detected clearly outlined hypointense regions (non-perfused liver tissue) in group-B. In these animals the non-perfused tissue, was barely detectable two days later. In group-A the MRI detected no changes.\n\nConclusion: In our model the MRI did not detect any ischemic tissue in healthy recipients. When the parallel liver perfusion via hepatic arteries was interrupted (group-B), the contrast agent cannot circumvent the islets and reach the tissue behind it. Then MRI became sensitive enough to detect non-perfused regions. The tested model opens a possibility to study the effect of clotting inhibitors on liver ischemia during early post-transplant period.\n\nSupported by: The grant of the Czech Ministry of Health No. NT14240-3\n\nMH CZ - DRO (“Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine – IKEM, IN 00023001”)\n\nSupported by: 1) The grant of the Czech Ministry of Health No. NT14240-3 2) MH CZ - DRO („Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine – IKEM, IN 00023001“)\n\nReference:\n\n[1] Shapiro, A.M., et al.

Bateman1, Kevin J. Devereux-Cooke1, James D. Johnson1, Heide Brandhorst1, Daniel Brandhorst1, Derek W. R. Gray1, Sarah E. Cross1, Stephen J. Hughes1, Paul R. V. Johnson1\n\n1Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.\n\nObjectives: We have previously reported that the enzymatic digestion of peri-islet laminin in the human pancreas is influenced by donor age and BMI. We have also reported that laminin-511, an isoform of laminin found in both the outer endocrine and inner vascular basement membrane of the intra-islet vascular channels, is susceptible to digestion. Here we investigate which components of digestion enzyme blends routinely used in human islet isolation are responsible for the breakdown of laminin and laminin-511.\n\nMethods: Recombinant laminin-511 was incubated with individual enzyme components or with combinations of enzymes to mimic a commercially available collagenase blend, and then assessed for degradation by gel electrophoresis. Determination of laminin-511 cleavage sites was determined by proteomic tandem mass spectrometric methods. With appropriate consent and ethical approval, the digestion of peri-islet laminin and laminin-511 was measured in cryosections of human donor pancreases (n=6), following incubation with specific supplementary enzymes.\n\nResults: Recombinant laminin-511 was digested by neutral protease and thermolysin, and to a lesser extent, clostripain. laminin-511 was not digested by Collagenase isoforms alone or in combination except in the presence of Neutral Protease. Cleavage sites of laminin-511 were localized to the “arms” of the individual peptide chains with thermolysin being the most aggressive enzyme. Additionally, thermolysin cleaved the laminin alpha5 chain in the C-terminal globular domain, which interacts with islet integrins and other cellular receptors. The degradation of both laminin and laminin-511 at the islet:exocrine interface was also observed in pancreatic sections incubated with neutral protease or thermolysin.\n\nConclusions: As peri-islet laminin increases with age, and its digestion by neutral protease is lower in younger donors, data from this study would suggest that substituting neutral protease with the more aggressive thermolysin as part of the enzyme combination used for human islet isolation, could potentially improve islet yields from younger donors.\n\n254\n\nRestored Vascular Density and Blood Fow in Mouse and Human Islets Experimentally Transplanted to The Greater Omentum\n\nDaniel Espes1, Joey Lau1, Gustaf Christoffersson1, My Quach1, Per-Ola Carlsson1,2\n\n1Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden; 2Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.\n\nIslet transplantation is hampered by poor long-term results, which may relate to site-specific challenges of the liver. The highly vascularized greater omentum has been suggested as a possible alternative site, but its capability for islet vascular engraftment is unknown. The present study investigated the revascularization process, blood perfusion and oxygenation in mouse and human islets transplanted to the greater omentum of syngeneic or nude mice. Vascular density was assessed both in vivo for perfused blood vessels by CD31 and fluorescent dextran, and by immunohistochemistry. The attribution of donor endothelium was assessed by transplantation of flk-1GFP islets. Islet blood flow and oxygen tension was measured with laser-Doppler and Clark microelectrodes in vivo, and extent of islet hypoxia by the biochemical marker pimonidazole.\n\nThe islet vascular density was restored within 30 days (10.4±0.4%, n=5) when compared to native islets (8.5±0.6%, n=5), whereas at day 7 the vascular density was 3.0±0.6 % (n=4, p<0.001 vs. day 30 and native islets). Donor endothelium did not contribute in the revascularization process. A vascular network similar to that in native islets where all blood vessels were perfused was established within 14 days. Blood flow at 30 days was 22±3 TPU in transplanted mouse islets (n=7), 21±2 TPU in transplanted human islets (n=7), and 8±1 TPU in the gastric wall (reference organ; n=8). Oxygen tension in the transplanted tissue was also restored to values similar to those recorded in native islets; i.e. 35.4±5.1 mmHg in mouse islets and 34.8±3.7 mmHg in human islets (n=7 animals). Islet hypoxia in islet grafts was rapidly reversed (51±16%, 20±2% and 2.0±0.3% hypoxic cells at day 1, 4 and 7, respectively).\n\nWe conclude that islets transplanted to the greater omentum have a rapidly restored vascular density, blood flow and oxygen tension, and thereby represents an attractive alternative to the liver worthy of consideration.\n\n255\n\nA Silk Based Encapsulation Platform for Pancreatic Islets Reduces Marginal Mass for Transplantation and Improves Islet function in Vivo\n\nMagali Fontaine1, Diana Hamilton1, Hank Shih1, Richard Schubert1, David Kaplan2\n\n1Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States; 2Biomedical Engineering, Tufts University, Medford, MA, United States.\n\nBackground: The success of pancreatic islet (PI) transplantation is challenged by PI functional damage and apoptosis during the peri-transplantation period. PI encapsulation in a silk hydrogel with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can support a three dimensional microenvironment enhancing engraftment. We evaluate in vivo the survival and function of PI transplanted in the same silk-based platform.\n\nMethods: PI were isolated from C57BL/6J mice and transplanted in the epidydimal fat pad of streptozotocin induced diabetic syngeneic mice. Two preparations of 150 islet equivalents (IEQ) versus 200 IEQ were transplanted as follows: 1) Pelleted alone; 2) Encapsulated in silk 3) Co-encapsulated in silk with MSCs (1x106). Blood glucose levels were monitored and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was performed on day 21 post-transplant. Grafts were removed on day 42 for immunohistochemistry analysis and on day 14 for cytokine analysis by Luminex assay.\n\nResults: Recipients of 200 IEQ in silk returned to euglycemia at 4±2 days post transplant compared to 9.4±4 days with PI in silk with MSCs and to 34±7 days with pelleted PI. A marginal mass of 150 IEQ was sufficient to reverse to euglycemia only for PI in silk with MSCs. Tolerance to high glucose was significantly improved (IPGTT) with 200 IEQ in silk with MSCs, compared to PI in silk alone or pelleted (p< 0.05 ). Histology revealed widespread re-vascularization in both grafts of PI in silk with or without MSCs. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNFα) increased (5 fold) in PI grafts with silk alone but decreased significantly with islets co encapsulated with MSCs. Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13), and pro-angiogenic factor (TGFβ, VEGF) were increased significantly in islets encapsulated in silk both with or without MSCs.\n\nConclusions: PI encapsulated in a silk scaffold with or without MSCs reversed hyperglycemia in association with increased levels of angiogenic factors and Th2 cytokines in the grafts. Further studies are ongoing to confirm silk biocompatibility for applications in allo- and xeno- islet transplantation.\n\n256\n\nSurvival Characteristics of the Inflammatory-Suppressed Islet Allograft: Reduced Immunosuppression and Prolongled Survival\n\nNathan W. Zammit1, Bernice M. Tan1, Stacey N. Walters1, David Liuwantara1, Jeanette E. Villanueva1, Elisabeth K. Malle1, Shane T. Grey1\n\n1Immunology Department, Garvan Institute, Darlinghurst, Australia.\n\nIslet-grafts can contribute to their own destruction via the elaboration of proinflammatory genes, many of which are transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB. Thus NF-κB constitutes an enticing gene therapy candidate to improve the success of islet transplantation. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we blocked NF-κB in BALB/c (H-2d) to C57/BL6 (H-2b) mouse islet allografts by genetically-engineering islets to express the NF-κB super-repressor, IκBα. Here we show by microarray and RTqPCR that islets exhibit an intrinsic early-immediate pro-inflammatory response; with the most highly up-regulated proinflammatory genes comprising the chemokines Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl10 and Ccl2; the cytokines Tnfα and Il6; and the adhesion molecule Icam1. Overexpression of IκBα inhibited the expression of these genes by 50-95 % in islets and MIN6 β-cells in vitro, by inhibiting NF-κB-dependent gene transcription. Histological and RTqPCR analysis at post-operative day (POD) 10 revealed that IκBα transduced islet allografts exhibited improved islet architecture and strong insulin-labelling with decreased Ccl2 and Il6 mRNA levels compared to GFP-transduced control grafts. Despite these protective effects, NF-κB blocked islet allografts were promptly rejected in our MHC mismatched mouse model. However, IκBα expressing grafts did harbour localized ’pockets’ of Foxp3+ mononuclear cells not evident in control grafts. This result suggested to us that the effect of NF-κB blockade might synergize with regulatory T-cell sparing Rapamycin. Indeed, combining intragraft IκBα expression with low-dose Rapamycin increased the mean survival time of islet allografts from 20 to 81 days; with 20 % of grafts surviving for greater than 100 days. In conclusion, Rapamycin unmasks the protective potential of intragraft NF-κB blockade, which can, in some cases, permit permanent allograft survival without continuous systemic immunosuppression.\n\n257\n\nPrevention and Rescue of Diabetes by All-Trans Retinoid Acid and Exendin-4 in NOD Mice with and Without Islet Transplantation\n\nJyuhn-Huarng Juang1, Yang-Hau Van1, Chien-Hung Kuo1, Ying-Hsiu Liu1, Han-Yin Chang1\n\n1Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.\n\nType 1 diabetes usually develops due to an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. It has been shown that all-trans retinoid acid (ATRA), a potent derivative of vitamin A, hinders the development of autoimmune diabetes by inducing immune tolerance status. In addition, exendin-4, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, stimulates growth and differentiation of beta cells and exerts antiapoptotic effect on beta cells. Thus we hypothesized that the ATRA and exendin-4 therapy may prevent and rescue autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice with and without islet transplantation.\n\nIn experiment I, NOD/scid mice were intravenously transferred with splenocytes isolated from 12 week-old female NOD mice. After adopted transfer, mice were treated with ATRA (0.5 mg/mouse intraperitoneally qod), exendin-4 (3 mg/kg subcutaneously bid) or ATRA+exendin-4 for 6 weeks. In experiment II, NOD mice were treated with ATRA or exendin-4 after the onset of diabetes. In experiment III, diabetic NOD mice were transplanted with 300-600 islets from NOD/scid mice and then treated with ATRA or exendin-4.\n\nIn experiment I, all adopted transfer recipients treated with ATRA or exendin-4 developed diabetes before 8 weeks. However, the combination treatment of ATRA and exendin-4 delayed the onset of diabetes untill 10-12 weeks (p<0.05). In experiment II, all but one diabetic NOD mice treated with ATRA remained diabetic and the survival time was comparable in control (52±31 days), ATRA (45±19 days) and exendin-4 (62±34 days) groups. The mouse who achieved normoglycemia after ATRA treatment was alive for 366 days with periodic hyperglycemia. In experiment III, all mice remained diabetic after islet transplantation and the survival time was not significantly different among control (52±51 days), ATRA (101±101 days) and exendin-4 (48±19 days) groups.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of ATRA and exendin-4 is effective in preventing autoimmune diabetes. However, ATRA or exendin-4 alone did not prevent or rescue diabetes in NOD mice with and without islet transplantation.\n\n258\n\nInsulin-Like Growth Factor-II (IGF-II) Prevents Pro-Inflammatory Cytokine Induced Apoptosis and Significantly Improves Islet Survival Post-Transplantation\n\nAmy Hughes1,3, Daisy Mohanasundaram1,2,3, Svjetlana Kireta1, Claire F Jessup4,5, Chris J Drogemuller1,2,3,5, P Toby H Coates1,2,3,5\n\n1Renal and transplantation Immunobiology Laboratory, The Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia; 2Australian Islet Consortium, Adelaide, Australia; 3School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia; 4Department of Human Physiology, Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia; 5Centre for stem cell research, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.\n\nIntroduction: The early loss of functional islet mass (50-70%) due to apoptosis following clinical transplantation contributes to islet allograft failure. Insulin-like Growth Factor-II (IGF-II) is an anti-apoptotic protein that is highly expressed in β-cells during development, but rapidly decreases in post-natal life.\n\nMethods: We used an Adenoviral (Ad) vector to over express IGF-II in isolated rat islets and investigated its anti-apoptotic action against exogenous cytokines IL-1β and IFN-γ induced islet cell death in vitro. Using an immunocompromised marginal mass islet transplant model, the ability of Ad-IGF-II transduced rat islets to restore euglycemia in NOD-SCID diabetic recipients was assessed.\n\nResults: Ad-IGF-II transduction did not affect islet viability or function. Ad-IGF-II cytokine treated islets exhibited decreased cell death (40 ± 2.8%) vs. Ad-GFP and untransduced control islets (63.2 ± 2.5% and 53.6 ± 2.3%, respectively). Ad-IGF-II over expression during cytokine treatment resulted in a marked reduction in TUNEL positive apoptotic cells (8.3 ± 1.4%) vs. Ad-GFP control (41 ± 4.2%) and untransduced control islets (46.5 ± 6.2%). Western blot analysis confirmed that IGF-II inhibits apoptosis via activation of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. Transplantation of IGF-II over expressing islets under the kidney capsule of diabetic mice restored euglycemia in 78% of recipients, compared to 18% and 47% of Ad-GFP and untransduced control islet recipients, respectively (p<0.05 Log-rank (Mantel Cox)). Ad-IGF-II recipient mice stabilized and slightly increased their weight following transplantation, while this was not the case for mice receiving untransduced or Ad-GFP transduced islet grafts, p<0.0001 (1way ANOVA).\n\nConclusions: Anti-apoptotic IGF-II decreases apoptosis in vitro and significantly improved islet transplant outcomes in vivo. Anti-apoptotic gene transfer is a potentially powerful tool to improve islet survival post-transplantation.\n\n259\n\nPreculture of Human Islets with Mesenchymal Stem Cells in a Direct Contact Configuration Enhances Islet Function in Vitro\n\nParamjeet Dhadda1, Chloe Rackham1, Aurélie Le Lay1, Alan Kerby1, Guo-Cai Huang1, Peter Jones1\n\n1King’s College London, London, United Kingdom.\n\nObjectives: We have previously shown that co-transplantation of mouse islets with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), or pre-transplant culture of islets with MSCs improves transplantation outcome in diabetic mice. The aims of this study were to investigate whether pre-treatment of human islets with human MSC populations improves islet function in vitro, to determine whether data generated in mouse models was translatable to clinically relevant human tissue.\n\nMethods: Human islet preparations from three fully consented cadaveric donors were used for this study (received from King’s College Hospital). In all three experiments islets were cultured over a 4-day period either alone (IA) or directly upon a monolayer of bone-marrow MSCs (IBM), adipose MSCs (IAD) or pancreatic MSCs (IPA). Islets were subsequently assessed for insulin content and glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).\n\nResults: At the end of the 4 day co-culture period, all MSC populations increased islet insulin content when compared to islets cultured alone (IA: 12.8 ± 1.1ng/islet; IBM: 18.9 ± 1.6, p<0.001; IAD: 19.1 ± 3.3, p<0.01; IPA: 19.4 ± 2.5, p<0.001, n=20 observations) in all three experiments. Pretreatment of islets with bone-marrow or adipose MSCs also enhanced glucose induced (20mM) insulin secretion over basal secretion (2mM) (IA: 12 ± 1 fold; IBM: 14 ± 3; IAD: 18 ± 3, p<0.05 vs. IA, n=10 observations). In contrast pancreatic MSCs did not improve GSIS (IPA: 10 ± 1, p>0.2, n=10). This trend was observed in all three experiments.\n\nConclusion: Pre-treatment of human islets with three different human MSC populations increased islet insulin content, however only bone marrow and adipose MSCs enhanced GSIS. Pre-treatment of isolated human islets on a monolayer of MSCs, prior to clinical transplantation, could serve as a viable option for the maintenance of islets in culture with potential to improve subsequent islet transplantation outcome.\n\n260\n\nVascular Heterogeneity Between Native Pancreatic Islets Determines Their Fate of Survival and Revascularization Posttransplantation\n\nSara Ullsten1, Joey Lau1, Nils Welsh1, Per-Ola Carlsson1,2\n\n1Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden; 2Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.\n\nHighly blood perfused islets have been observed to be the most functional islets in the native pancreas. This study investigated the hypothesis that differences in vascular support of islets in donor pancreas influence their capacity of vascular engraftment and susceptibility to cellular stress after transplantation. Highly blood perfused islets in rat were identified by injection of microspheres into the ascending aorta, followed by retrieval of pancreas for islet isolation. Islets with or without microsp"
