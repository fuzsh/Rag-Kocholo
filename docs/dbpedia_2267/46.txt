A time to be born and a time to die: A time to plant, and a time to pluck what is planted; A time to kill and a time to heal; a time to break down, And a time to build up; a time to weep, and a time to laugh; A time to mourn and a time to dance. Ecclesiastes 3: 1-4

On July 15, 1945, Abe and Ples Williams were blessed with a loving baby boy whom they named Abe Williams, Jr. Abe accepted Christ at an early age and was baptized in 1955 by the late Pastor Frank Wilson at Mount Zion Baptist Church of Omega, LA. Abe loved the Lord. You could often find him talking about the Bible and singing Spirituals. During this Christian journey, he touched many lives. He was free-spirited, fun loving, and loved spending time with family and friends. He was selfless and always willing to take care of anyone he could. He loved to fish and spend time with “His Girls.” Pastor Williams was licensed to preach the gospel on March 1, 1991. He served as pastor at Mt. Mariah M.B. Church until his health failed him. He remained a member of First Colored Baptist Church until his transition from this side.
