Also, the paper will go into detail the social, political, and\n\neconomic impact of the movement towards the society and how it has benefited the women in\n\nregards to certain sectors such as education and equal pay in job opportunities (Vickery, 2017).\n\nThe essay will discuss the various triggers and root causes as to why the women's rights\n\nmovement was formed and the issues which were formed in the subsequent years after the\n\nformation of women parties and union groups to protect women from been discriminated in the\n\nworkplace. Lastly, there will be an illustration of the dynamics of whether the women's rights\n\nmovements, in the long run, served the women in the society positively and whether the\n\nsubsequent outcomes that followed were well deserved to the women.\n\nBody\n\nThe women's rights movement was popularly known as the liberation movement,\n\nwhich contained diverse women in the society who started a social movement mostly based in\n\nthe United States. The social movement aimed to seek equal rights and opportunities together\n\nwith freedom for women to undertake and be recognized in different fields of work-study.\n\nMoreover, the women's rights movement had four phases where the first wave of feminism was\n\nduring the 19th and early 20th century, where the women at the time focused on their rights to\n\nperform certain actions such as voting (Pace, 2020). Alternatively, the second wave began from\n\nthe early 1960s to 1970, followed up with the third and fourth feminism waves from 1990 to\n\n2010, where women at this stage championed equal opportunities in the society. It's evident after\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n3\n\nthe end of world war two there was an improved economy hence the high demand for employees\n\nin the industries, which did not necessarily require one to use a lot of energy. It led to women\n\nbeen employed at such jobs but were not treated equally as their counterpart gender as they were\n\nbeen given less wage and worked way more than the other males in the same job position.\n\nFurthermore, due to suppression of the women in workplaces, it led to author Betty Friedan in\n\npublishing The Feminine Mystique in 1963, which illustrated the hardship women in the society\n\nundergo due to the discrimination from the other gender and society (Stone, 2020). The book\n\nbecame a best-seller, which attracted a large following of women around the country; hence a\n\nsection of women joined with union leaders and government officials in an aim to lobby a bill\n\nthat will protect women from workplace discrimination and equal pay. However, they later\n\nrealized their requests to the congress were ignored; hence in 1966, the women created their own\n\nunion called the National Organization for Women (NOW).\n\nDespite the small number of members in the agency, they were able to write six\n\ncritical bills of rights for women that would serve all the women in the country. In addition, they\n\nadded two more bills of rights for women, where one of them required the approval of the equal\n\nrights of Amendment (ERA) to the Constitution of the country. At the time, the National\n\norganization for women was fully backed and supported by the United Auto Workers, who help\n\nthe women's organization with free office space. The withdraw of the United Autoworkers led to\n\na faction of members in the National organization for women to leave the group, which led to\n\nNOW struggling to establish itself to other organizations that were critically acclaimed in the\n\ncountry. Also, half of the members in the National organization for women were based in New\n\nYork who grew tired of the traditional activities portrayed by the leaders of the organization\n\nhence branched out and started radical women groups. However, as the remaining members of\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n4\n\nthe National organization for women focused on issues that were affecting women, the other\n\nradical groups pursued liberation of women in the workplaces and tried to change the perspective\n\nof the society towards the role of women (Peters & Wolper, 2018). Eventually, in 1969 the\n\nnational organization for women was able to call congress to unite the women in the country,\n\nwhich increased the popularity of the organization where over five hundred women joined from\n\nNew York. The leaders of the National organization for women started interacting with\n\npoliticians through lobbying of bills that would favor the women while at the same time\n\ninvolving agencies such as NASA to include Women in their space programs. Again, the\n\nwomen's rights by NOW where intensified where we see the ERA bill been passed in 1972,\n\nwhich was attribute by the efforts of Betty Friedan .However, after the passage of the bill the\n\nwomen received a huge backlash from individuals such as anti-feminists Phyllis Sclafly who\n\ncondemned the passage of the amendment hence organizing a demonstration. Phyllis pointed out\n\nkey aspects about the bill passed on how it would conflict with the existing bills such\n\ninvalidating laws set up about sodomy or, in the long run, legalize same-sex marriage (Tchaïcha\n\n& Arfaoui, 2017).\n\nBy the 1990s, the women's rights movement had impacted various sectors,\n\nespecially the economy, as women were able to own property rights, which allowed them to buy\n\nand own land without the restriction of a man to be present in the signing of the title deeds.\n\nMoreover, women were able to reduce workplace discrimination, which ensures the women were\n\nfully respected by their counter gender enabling good working conditions in the organizations.\n\nThere was also the change of equal pay where women were able to earn more money, which was\n\na big step up in the right direction towards the liberation of women. The other aspect that\n\nchanged a lot was the social sector, where we see in the 20th-century women were able to attend\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n5\n\ncolleges even though there were not many numbers as men but it showed progression to allow\n\nwomen to have an opportunity to acquire knowledge. Also, women were able to pursue maledominated careers, which over the years were fully accompanied by men and not regarded to suit\n\nthe Women, but due to the progressive movement by the National organization of women, a\n\nmajority of women pursued courses such as law and Medicine (Vickery, 2017). Lastly, the\n\npolitical sectors are another area where the women's rights movement changed how women were\n\nperceived regarding topics about politics. We see in the 19th century the first wave of feminism\n\nwas fighting for voting rights to apply to women as they do to men. The women at the time push\n\nthe bills of rights to the congress, where it was passed which allowed women to vote in any\n\ngeneral election held by the country. The aspect of women also joining politics as politicians\n\nwere well presented by the women's rights movement at the time, ensuring Women could vie for\n\npolitical seats in the government.\n\nSources and Triggers to the Women’s Rights Movement Formation and Activities\n\nThe issue of women been suppressed from voting was a structural issue that needed to be\n\nsolved and new laws implemented to cater to the rights of the women in the 19th century. The\n\nwomen at the time began the first wave of feminism that fought for their rights by writing a bill\n\nthat would allow them to vote, which was an important issue as women were not considered in\n\nany general election at the time. Also, Workplace discrimination in workplaces led to the rise of\n\nthe Women's rights movement as women underwent unequal pay and was discriminated against\n\nwhile given inferior work positions in organizations (Gleadle, 2016). The root causes of the\n\nabove were centered upon the systematic favoritism of male gender hence required new laws that\n\nwould protect women in the workplace from been taken advantage of and ensuring they could be\n\ntreated equally despite the job they assigned in any organization. Furthermore, the issue of\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n6\n\nincreased unequal opportunities such as education advancement was highly prioritized to the\n\nmale gender, whom were viewed by society to be much superior that the female gender (Gibson,\n\n2017). The women's rights movement aimed to change the perceptive of the narrative by\n\nensuring colleges and universities were able to offer the same opportunities to women to pursue\n\nfurther education. It allowed women to undertake in courses which were referred to as for the\n\nmale gender only such as Medicine and law which over the years through the efforts of the NOW\n\nwomen were able to acquire the same education although not taken seriously by the lecturers but\n\nwere able to fulfill their objectives and get hired in workplaces they had studied in the university.\n\nAlso, the systemic gender bias is still evident in how women were not offered any opportunities\n\nto pursue further education, but the male gender was able hence leading to the women rights\n\nmovement been formed to ensure that women have the same equal opportunities in the society\n\nby influencing change in the society. Lastly, the issue of lack of women in political positions or\n\nin leadership roles as we see the national organization for women tabled bills such as ERA to the\n\ncongress and also held talks with NASA to cater for the women to be considered in the astronaut\n\nprograms.\n\nSpecific Issues and triggers by the Party\n\nThe National Women’s party main issue under the leadership of Alice Paul was fighting\n\nfor equal rights for the women in the society. The issue of women not been able to vote was one\n\nof the inequalities faced by many women in the society hence led to a bill of women rights\n\nformulated that stated women would be allowed to vote, which was passed by congress. Another\n\ninequality faced by women was their right to own property at the time which triggered the\n\nresponse of the National woman party to write bills that would be presented to the congress\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n7\n\nallowing women the ability to own their own property without any presence of a man in the title\n\ndeed which in the long run was implemented allowing women to have sole ownership of\n\nproperties. Also, the issue of workplace discrimination of women was another issue that needed\n\nto be addressed hence requiring the National organization for women to recruit more members to\n\njoin hence writing billings to the congress to ensure women were protected in the workplace.\n\nAgain, the unequal pay experienced by the women in workplaces was another issue that needed\n\nto be addressed during the third and fourth waves of feminism, where bills were tabled to the\n\ncongress for approval enabling women to have increased wages. The issue of unequal\n\nopportunities in the society was another issue which triggered the National organization of\n\nWomen to act as women were not allowed to further their education in the universities or\n\ncolleges until more bill of rights were introduced and approved by the congress enabling the\n\nwomen to pursue course such as law and Medicine which were viewed to be male-dominated\n\nfields of study while offering the safe opportunity of knowledge to women was essential to\n\nensure social cohesion between the two genders.\n\nSupporting and Opposing Parties and other Key Stakeholders Parties\n\nThe United Autoworkers were responsible for the support of the National\n\norganization of women by providing them with the necessary space and equipment for them to\n\nstart by establishing themselves to the rest of the national parties at the time. However, the\n\nUnited Auto Workers retracted their support on the NOW after they pushed the ERA bill, which\n\nto them went against the other outstanding laws enacted to ensure abortion was illegal. The ERA\n\nbill tried to bring a message that abortion was a necessary social practice required which was not\n\nagreed upon by the shareholders in United Auto Workers together with half of the member\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n8\n\nfaction in the organization NOW who left the Party to form other radical groups whose aim was\n\nto try to liberate the women in the country. The leaders of the National organization of women\n\nafter passing the ERA bill became more confident in their approaches as they held meetings with\n\nhigh government and private officials such as NASA, who the union talked about incorporating\n\nwomen in the space program (Clatterbaugh, 2018). The leaders of NOW also discussed more\n\ntabling of women's rights to congress with the help of the government officials, ensuring they\n\nfocused on the issues faced by women in society. However, the national organization of women\n\nover time after passing the ERA which led to the dwindling power by NOW as the policies that\n\nhad implemented were started to be revised as they made more harm than good and most women\n\nin the union groups question whether the laws were created out of good response.\n\nStrategies and Tactics Use by Women’s Rights Movement\n\nThe leaders who organized the women's rights used the three following tactics\n\nand movement, which includes, firstly, they took control of the media, which included partnering\n\nwith the local newspapers, which at the time served as a form communication to many people in\n\nthe nation to receive communication. The organizers took advantage of that situation by reaching\n\nout to other women who understood their cause and joined them to end the unequal treatment\n\nthey faced in workplaces. Secondly, the organizers of the women's rights movement ensured that\n\nthe women in the group would be placed in hire roles in the society such as school boards,\n\nnewspaper editors, secretaries to major politicians, and even some women run for congress seats\n\nto boast their narrative (Bell, 2018). The approach allowed the NOW party to have power in\n\nvarious sectors in the society, giving them an advantage as to when they are portraying their\n\nmessage to society. Lastly, the women rights movement organizers were responsible for getting\n\nthe votes that were required to elect qualified individuals into the government seat after women\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n9\n\nwere allowed to vote hence putting people in the congress that can drive their bills written by the\n\nNational Organization of women party which will aim to benefit the women from unequal\n\nsociety. The leaders aim to acquire the necessary supporters and update them over the election\n\npreceding by giving information on people who have voted and the people who had not hence\n\nhelping them to find other alternatives in an aim for them to cast their vote the candidate backed\n\nby the women party.\n\nDynamics within the Movement and the Society\n\nThe women's rights movement accomplished social change where women were allowed\n\nto vote and choose leaders into the government. It allowed women to elect leaders who would\n\nchampion their rights in congress, ensuring their needs are met through the implementation of\n\nlaws that would protect women in society. Also, restrictions of women from not attending\n\ncolleges and universities were lifted as we see the laws changed, which allowed women to\n\npursue educational fields that were viewed to be male-dominated such as Medicine and law.\n\nAgain, ensuring that women could pursue education was the most important social changes as it\n\nopened up opportunities for other women to have independence from men. Moreover, the\n\nwomen's rights movement was behind the political change of the culture in the country where\n\nwomen were starting to get elected to congress, hence they pushed for equal treatment in the\n\nsociety to the other male gender (Bair, 2020). Lastly, the movement sparked the economic\n\nchange that was required in regards to how women were being discriminated in workplaces and\n\nhow they faced unequal pay while they worked in the same positions as some of the males in her\n\ndepartment. It led to the National organization for women writing bills of rights that ensured\n\nwomen were protected in workplaces resulting in the congress passing the bill, and new laws\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n10\n\nwere enacted which saw women having increased wage and also protected from cases of\n\nphysical or sexual discrimination in the workplace. However, bills such ERA which were pushed\n\nby NOW to congress to be passed in the end run worked against women in the society as there\n\nwere higher rates of teen pregnancies with even many members of the unions questioning\n\nwhether the laws about abortion if they were faced with helping the women or holding back\n\nwomen in the society.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe research paper goes through the historical, social, political, and economic concept\n\nof how the women's rights movement impacted the various areas either positively or negatively.\n\nAlso, the essay discusses the strategies used by the organizers of the women's rights movement\n\nto reach a high number of members across the country. Lastly, the paper illustrates the sources\n\nand triggers of the women's rights movement and the outcomes which have occurred on whether\n\nthey have resulted in benefiting of the women in the society and why the movement was\n\nessential to ensure women's rights were protected in the society.\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n11\n\nReferences\n\nBair, S.

Alternatively, the second wave began from\n\nthe early 1960s to 1970, followed up with the third and fourth feminism waves from 1990 to\n\n2010, where women at this stage championed equal opportunities in the society. It's evident after\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n3\n\nthe end of world war two there was an improved economy hence the high demand for employees\n\nin the industries, which did not necessarily require one to use a lot of energy. It led to women\n\nbeen employed at such jobs but were not treated equally as their counterpart gender as they were\n\nbeen given less wage and worked way more than the other males in the same job position.\n\nFurthermore, due to suppression of the women in workplaces, it led to author Betty Friedan in\n\npublishing The Feminine Mystique in 1963, which illustrated the hardship women in the society\n\nundergo due to the discrimination from the other gender and society (Stone, 2020). The book\n\nbecame a best-seller, which attracted a large following of women around the country; hence a\n\nsection of women joined with union leaders and government officials in an aim to lobby a bill\n\nthat will protect women from workplace discrimination and equal pay. However, they later\n\nrealized their requests to the congress were ignored; hence in 1966, the women created their own\n\nunion called the National Organization for Women (NOW).\n\nDespite the small number of members in the agency, they were able to write six\n\ncritical bills of rights for women that would serve all the women in the country. In addition, they\n\nadded two more bills of rights for women, where one of them required the approval of the equal\n\nrights of Amendment (ERA) to the Constitution of the country. At the time, the National\n\norganization for women was fully backed and supported by the United Auto Workers, who help\n\nthe women's organization with free office space. The withdraw of the United Autoworkers led to\n\na faction of members in the National organization for women to leave the group, which led to\n\nNOW struggling to establish itself to other organizations that were critically acclaimed in the\n\ncountry. Also, half of the members in the National organization for women were based in New\n\nYork who grew tired of the traditional activities portrayed by the leaders of the organization\n\nhence branched out and started radical women groups (Furchtgott-Roth, 2012). However, as the\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n4\n\nremaining members of the National organization for women focused on issues that were\n\naffecting women, the other radical groups pursued liberation of women in the workplaces and\n\ntried to change the perspective of the society towards the role of women (Peters & Wolper,\n\n2018). Eventually, in 1969 the national organization for women was able to call congress to unite\n\nthe women in the country, which increased the popularity of the organization where over five\n\nhundred women joined from New York. The leaders of the National organization for women\n\nstarted interacting with politicians through lobbying of bills that would favor the women while at\n\nthe same time involving agencies such as NASA to include Women in their space programs.\n\nAgain, the women's rights by NOW where intensified where we see the ERA bill been passed in\n\n1972, which was attribute by the efforts of Betty Friedan .However, after the passage of the bill\n\nthe women received a huge backlash from individuals such as anti-feminists Phyllis Sclafly who\n\ncondemned the passage of the amendment hence organizing a demonstration. Phyllis pointed out\n\nkey aspects about the bill passed on how it would conflict with the existing bills such\n\ninvalidating laws set up about sodomy or, in the long run, legalize same-sex marriage (Tchaïcha\n\n& Arfaoui, 2017).\n\nBy the 1990s, the women's rights movement had impacted various sectors,\n\nespecially the economy, as women were able to own property rights, which allowed them to buy\n\nand own land without the restriction of a man to be present in the signing of the title deeds.\n\nMoreover, women were able to reduce workplace discrimination, which ensures the women were\n\nfully respected by their counter gender enabling good working conditions in the organizations.\n\nThere was also the change of equal pay where women were able to earn more money, which was\n\na big step up in the right direction towards the liberation of women. The other aspect that\n\nchanged a lot was the social sector, where we see in the 20th-century women were able to attend\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n5\n\ncolleges even though there were not many numbers as men but it showed progression to allow\n\nwomen to have an opportunity to acquire knowledge. Also, women were able to pursue maledominated careers, which over the years were fully accompanied by men and not regarded to suit\n\nthe Women, but due to the progressive movement by the National organization of women, a\n\nmajority of women pursued courses such as law and Medicine (Vickery, 2017). Lastly, the\n\npolitical sectors are another area where the women's rights movement changed how women were\n\nperceived regarding topics about politics. We see in the 19th century the first wave of feminism\n\nwas fighting for voting rights to apply to women as they do to men. The women at the time push\n\nthe bills of rights to the congress, where it was passed which allowed women to vote in any\n\ngeneral election held by the country. The aspect of women also joining politics as politicians\n\nwere well presented by the women's rights movement at the time, ensuring Women could vie for\n\npolitical seats in the government.\n\nSources and Triggers to the Women’s Rights Movement Formation and Activities\n\nThe issue of women been suppressed from voting was a structural issue that needed to be\n\nsolved and new laws implemented to cater to the rights of the women in the 19th century. The\n\nwomen at the time began the first wave of feminism that fought for their rights by writing a bill\n\nthat would allow them to vote, which was an important issue as women were not considered in\n\nany general election at the time. Also, Workplace discrimination in workplaces led to the rise of\n\nthe Women's rights movement as women underwent unequal pay and was discriminated against\n\nwhile given inferior work positions in organizations (Gleadle, 2016). The root causes of the\n\nabove were centered upon the systematic favoritism of male gender hence required new laws that\n\nwould protect women in the workplace from been taken advantage of and ensuring they could be\n\ntreated equally despite the job they assigned in any organization. Furthermore, the issue of\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n6\n\nincreased unequal opportunities such as education advancement was highly prioritized to the\n\nmale gender, whom were viewed by society to be much superior that the female gender (Gibson,\n\n2017). The women's rights movement aimed to change the perceptive of the narrative by\n\nensuring colleges and universities were able to offer the same opportunities to women to pursue\n\nfurther education. It allowed women to undertake in courses which were referred to as for the\n\nmale gender only such as Medicine and law which over the years through the efforts of the NOW\n\nwomen were able to acquire the same education although not taken seriously by the lecturers but\n\nwere able to fulfill their objectives and get hired in workplaces they had studied in the university.\n\nAlso, the systemic gender bias is still evident in how women were not offered any opportunities\n\nto pursue further education, but the male gender was able hence leading to the women rights\n\nmovement been formed to ensure that women have the same equal opportunities in the society\n\nby influencing change in the society. Lastly, the issue of lack of women in political positions or\n\nin leadership roles as we see the national organization for women tabled bills such as ERA to the\n\ncongress and also held talks with NASA to cater for the women to be considered in the astronaut\n\nprograms.\n\nSpecific Issues and triggers by the Party\n\nThe National Women’s party main issue under the leadership of Alice Paul was fighting\n\nfor equal rights for the women in the society. The issue of women not been able to vote was one\n\nof the inequalities faced by many women in the society hence led to a bill of women rights\n\nformulated that stated women would be allowed to vote, which was passed by congress. Another\n\ninequality faced by women was their right to own property at the time which triggered the\n\nresponse of the National woman party to write bills that would be presented to the congress\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n7\n\nallowing women the ability to own their own property without any presence of a man in the title\n\ndeed which in the long run was implemented allowing women to have sole ownership of\n\nproperties. Also, the issue of workplace discrimination of women was another issue that needed\n\nto be addressed hence requiring the National organization for women to recruit more members to\n\njoin hence writing billings to the congress to ensure women were protected in the workplace.\n\nAgain, the unequal pay experienced by the women in workplaces was another issue that needed\n\nto be addressed during the third and fourth waves of feminism, where bills were tabled to the\n\ncongress for approval enabling women to have increased wages (Furchtgott-Roth, 2012). The\n\nissue of unequal opportunities in the society was another issue which triggered the National\n\norganization of Women to act as women were not allowed to further their education in the\n\nuniversities or colleges until more bill of rights were introduced and approved by the congress\n\nenabling the women to pursue course such as law and Medicine which were viewed to be maledominated fields of study while offering the safe opportunity of knowledge to women was\n\nessential to ensure social cohesion between the two genders.\n\nSupporting and Opposing Parties and other Key Stakeholders Parties\n\nThe United Autoworkers were responsible for the support of the National\n\norganization of women by providing them with the necessary space and equipment for them to\n\nstart by establishing themselves to the rest of the national parties at the time. However, the\n\nUnited Auto Workers retracted their support on the NOW after they pushed the ERA bill, which\n\nto them went against the other outstanding laws enacted to ensure abortion was illegal. The ERA\n\nbill tried to bring a message that abortion was a necessary social practice required which was not\n\nagreed upon by the shareholders in United Auto Workers together with half of the member\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n8\n\nfaction in the organization NOW who left the Party to form other radical groups whose aim was\n\nto try to liberate the women in the country. The leaders of the National organization of women\n\nafter passing the ERA bill became more confident in their approaches as they held meetings with\n\nhigh government and private officials such as NASA, who the union talked about incorporating\n\nwomen in the space program (Clatterbaugh, 2018). The leaders of NOW also discussed more\n\ntabling of women's rights to congress with the help of the government officials, ensuring they\n\nfocused on the issues faced by women in society. However, the national organization of women\n\nover time after passing the ERA which led to the dwindling power by NOW as the policies that\n\nhad implemented were started to be revised as they made more harm than good and most women\n\nin the union groups question whether the laws were created out of good response.\n\nStrategies and Tactics Use by Women’s Rights Movement\n\nThe leaders who organized the women's rights used the three following tactics\n\nand movement, which includes, firstly, they took control of the media, which included partnering\n\nwith the local newspapers, which at the time served as a form communication to many people in\n\nthe nation to receive communication. The organizers took advantage of that situation by reaching\n\nout to other women who understood their cause and joined them to end the unequal treatment\n\nthey faced in workplaces. Secondly, the organizers of the women's rights movement ensured that\n\nthe women in the group would be placed in hire roles in the society such as school boards,\n\nnewspaper editors, secretaries to major politicians, and even some women run for congress seats\n\nto boast their narrative (Bell, 2018). The approach allowed the NOW party to have power in\n\nvarious sectors in the society, giving them an advantage as to when they are portraying their\n\nmessage to society. Lastly, the women rights movement organizers were responsible for getting\n\nthe votes that were required to elect qualified individuals into the government seat after women\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n9\n\nwere allowed to vote hence putting people in the congress that can drive their bills written by the\n\nNational Organization of women party which will aim to benefit the women from unequal\n\nsociety. The leaders aim to acquire the necessary supporters and update them over the election\n\npreceding by giving information on people who have voted and the people who had not hence\n\nhelping them to find other alternatives in an aim for them to cast their vote the candidate backed\n\nby the women party.\n\nDynamics within the Movement and the Society\n\nThe women's rights movement accomplished social change where women were allowed\n\nto vote and choose leaders into the government. It allowed women to elect leaders who would\n\nchampion their rights in congress, ensuring their needs are met through the implementation of\n\nlaws that would protect women in society. Also, restrictions of women from not attending\n\ncolleges and universities were lifted as we see the laws changed, which allowed women to\n\npursue educational fields that were viewed to be male-dominated such as Medicine and law.\n\nAgain, ensuring that women could pursue education was the most important social changes as it\n\nopened up opportunities for other women to have independence from men. Moreover, the\n\nwomen's rights movement was behind the political change of the culture in the country where\n\nwomen were starting to get elected to congress, hence they pushed for equal treatment in the\n\nsociety to the other male gender (Bair, 2020). Lastly, the movement sparked the economic\n\nchange that was required in regards to how women were being discriminated in workplaces and\n\nhow they faced unequal pay while they worked in the same positions as some of the males in her\n\ndepartment. It led to the National organization for women writing bills of rights that ensured\n\nwomen were protected in workplaces resulting in the congress passing the bill, and new laws\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n10\n\nwere enacted which saw women having increased wage and also protected from cases of\n\nphysical or sexual discrimination in the workplace. However, bills such ERA which were pushed\n\nby NOW to congress to be passed in the end run worked against women in the society as there\n\nwere higher rates of teen pregnancies with even many members of the unions questioning\n\nwhether the laws about abortion if they were faced with helping the women or holding back\n\nwomen in the society.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe research paper goes through the historical, social, political, and economic concept\n\nof how the women's rights movement impacted the various areas either positively or negatively.\n\nAlso, the essay discusses the strategies used by the organizers of the women's rights movement\n\nto reach a high number of members across the country. Lastly, the paper illustrates the sources\n\nand triggers of the women's rights movement and the outcomes which have occurred on whether\n\nthey have resulted in benefiting of the women in the society and why the movement was\n\nessential to ensure women's rights were protected in the society.\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n11\n\nReferences\n\nBair, S.

The leaders of\n\nthe National organization of women after passing the ERA bill became more confident in their\n\napproaches as they held meetings with high government and private officials such as NASA,\n\nwho the union talked about incorporating women in the space program (Clatterbaugh, 2018).\n\nThe leaders of NOW also discussed more tabling of women's rights to congress with the help of\n\nthe government officials, ensuring they focused on the issues faced by women in society.\n\nHowever, the national organization of women over time after passing the ERA which led to the\n\ndwindling power by NOW as the policies that had implemented were started to be revised as\n\nthey made more harm than good and most women in the union groups question whether the laws\n\nwere created out of good response.\n\nStrategies and Tactics Use by Women’s Rights Movement\n\nThe leaders who organized the women's rights used the three following tactics\n\nand movement, which includes, firstly, they took control of the media, which included partnering\n\nwith the local newspapers, which at the time served as a form communication to many people in\n\nthe nation to receive communication (Vickery, 2017). The organizers took advantage of that\n\nsituation by reaching out to other women who understood their cause and joined them to end the\n\nunequal treatment they faced in workplaces. Secondly, the organizers of the women's rights\n\nmovement ensured that the women in the group would be placed in hire roles in the society such\n\nas school boards, newspaper editors, secretaries to major politicians, and even some women run\n\nfor congress seats to boast their narrative (Bell, 2018). According to (Furchtgott-Roth,\n\n2012). The approach allowed the NOW party to have power in various sectors in the society,\n\ngiving them an advantage as to when they are portraying their message to society. Lastly, the\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n9\n\nwomen rights movement organizers were responsible for getting the votes that were required to\n\nelect qualified individuals into the government seat after women were allowed to vote hence\n\nputting people in the congress that can drive their bills written by the National Organization of\n\nwomen party which will aim to benefit the women from unequal society (Peters & Wolper,\n\n2018). The leaders aim to acquire the necessary supporters and update them over the election\n\npreceding by giving information on people who have voted and the people who had not hence\n\nhelping them to find other alternatives in an aim for them to cast their vote the candidate backed\n\nby the women party.\n\nDynamics within the Movement and the Society\n\nThe women's rights movement accomplished social change where women were allowed\n\nto vote and choose leaders into the government. It allowed women to elect leaders who would\n\nchampion their rights in congress, ensuring their needs are met through the implementation of\n\nlaws that would protect women in society (Stone, 2020). Also, restrictions of women from not\n\nattending colleges and universities were lifted as we see the laws changed, which allowed\n\nwomen to pursue educational fields that were viewed to be male-dominated such as Medicine\n\nand law. Again, ensuring that women could pursue education was the most important social\n\nchanges as it opened up opportunities for other women to have independence from men.\n\nMoreover, the women's rights movement was behind the political change of the culture in the\n\ncountry where women were starting to get elected to congress, hence they pushed for equal\n\ntreatment in the society to the other male gender (Bair, 2020). Lastly, the movement sparked the\n\neconomic change that was required in regards to how women were being discriminated in\n\nworkplaces and how they faced unequal pay while they worked in the same positions as some of\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n10\n\nthe males in her department. It led to the National organization for women writing bills of rights\n\nthat ensured women were protected in workplaces resulting in the congress passing the bill, and\n\nnew laws were enacted which saw women having increased wage and also protected from cases\n\nof physical or sexual discrimination in the workplace (Bell, 2018). However, bills such ERA\n\nwhich were pushed by NOW to congress to be passed in the end run worked against women in\n\nthe society as there were higher rates of teen pregnancies with even many members of the unions\n\nquestioning whether the laws about abortion if they were faced with helping the women or\n\nholding back women in the society.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe research paper goes through the historical, social, political, and economic concept\n\nof how the women's rights movement impacted the various areas either positively or negatively.\n\nAlso, the essay discusses the strategies used by the organizers of the women's rights movement\n\nto reach a high number of members across the country. Lastly, the paper illustrates the sources\n\nand triggers of the women's rights movement and the outcomes which have occurred on whether\n\nthey have resulted in benefiting of the women in the society and why the movement was\n\nessential to ensure women's rights were protected in the society.\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n11\n\nReferences\n\nBair, S.

Also, the paper will go into detail the social, political, and\n\neconomic impact of the movement towards the society and how it has benefited the women in\n\nregards to certain sectors such as education and equal pay in job opportunities. The essay will\n\ndiscuss the various triggers and root causes as to why the women's rights movement was formed\n\nand the issues which were formed in the subsequent years after the formation of women parties\n\nand union groups to protect women from been discriminated in the workplace. Lastly, there will\n\nbe an illustration of the dynamics of whether the women's rights movements, in the long run,\n\nserved the women in the society positively and whether the subsequent outcomes that followed\n\nwere well deserved to the women.\n\nBody\n\nThe women's rights movement was popularly known as the liberation movement,\n\nwhich contained diverse women in the society who started a social movement mostly based in\n\nthe United States. The social movement aimed to seek equal rights and opportunities together\n\nwith freedom for women to undertake and be recognized in different fields of work-study.\n\nMoreover, the women's rights movement had four phases where the first wave of feminism was\n\nduring the 19th and early 20th century, where the women at the time focused on their rights to\n\nperform certain actions such as voting (Cobble, 2005). Alternatively, the second wave began\n\nfrom the early 1960s to 1970, followed up with the third and fourth feminism waves from 1990\n\nto 2010, where women at this stage championed equal opportunities in the society. It's evident\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n3\n\nafter the end of world war two there was an improved economy hence the high demand for\n\nemployees in the industries, which did not necessarily require one to use a lot of energy. It led to\n\nwomen been employed at such jobs but were not treated equally as their counterpart gender as\n\nthey were been given less wage and worked way more than the other males in the same job\n\nposition. Furthermore, due to suppression of the women in workplaces, it led to author Betty\n\nFriedan in publishing The Feminine Mystique in 1963, which illustrated the hardship women in\n\nthe society undergo due to the discrimination from the other gender and society. The book\n\nbecame a best-seller, which attracted a large following of women around the country; hence a\n\nsection of women joined with union leaders and government officials in an aim to lobby a bill\n\nthat will protect women from workplace discrimination and equal pay. However, they later\n\nrealized their requests to the congress were ignored; hence in 1966, the women created their own\n\nunion called the National Organization for Women (NOW).\n\nDespite the small number of members in the agency, they were able to write six\n\ncritical bills of rights for women that would serve all the women in the country. In addition, they\n\nadded two more bills of rights for women, where one of them required the approval of the equal\n\nrights of Amendment (ERA) to the Constitution of the country (Moon, 2011). At the time, the\n\nNational organization for women was fully backed and supported by the United Auto Workers,\n\nwho help the women's organization with free office space. The withdraw of the United\n\nAutoworkers led to a faction of members in the National organization for women to leave the\n\ngroup, which led to NOW struggling to establish itself to other organizations that were critically\n\nacclaimed in the country. Also, half of the members in the National organization for women\n\nwere based in New York who grew tired of the traditional activities portrayed by the leaders of\n\nthe organization hence branched out and started radical women groups. However, as the\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n4\n\nremaining members of the National organization for women focused on issues that were\n\naffecting women, the other radical groups pursued liberation of women in the workplaces and\n\ntried to change the perspective of the society towards the role of women (Vetter,\n\n2017). Eventually, in 1969 the national organization for women was able to call congress to\n\nunite the women in the country, which increased the popularity of the organization where over\n\nfive hundred women joined from New York. The leaders of the National organization for women\n\nstarted interacting with politicians through lobbying of bills that would favor the women while at\n\nthe same time involving agencies such as NASA to include Women in their space programs.\n\nAgain, the women's rights by NOW where intensified where we see the ERA bill been passed in\n\n1972, which was attribute by the efforts of Betty Friedan .However, after the passage of the bill\n\nthe women received a huge backlash from individuals such as anti-feminists Phyllis Sclafly who\n\ncondemned the passage of the amendment hence organizing a demonstration. Phyllis pointed out\n\nkey aspects about the bill passed on how it would conflict with the existing bills such\n\ninvalidating laws set up about sodomy or, in the long run, legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nBy the 1990s, the women's rights movement had impacted various sectors,\n\nespecially the economy, as women were able to own property rights, which allowed them to buy\n\nand own land without the restriction of a man to be present in the signing of the title deeds.\n\nMoreover, women were able to reduce workplace discrimination, which ensures the women were\n\nfully respected by their counter gender enabling good working conditions in the organizations.\n\nThere was also the change of equal pay where women were able to earn more money, which was\n\na big step up in the right direction towards the liberation of women. The other aspect that\n\nchanged a lot was the social sector, where we see in the 20th-century women were able to attend\n\ncolleges even though there were not many numbers as men but it showed progression to allow\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n5\n\nwomen to have an opportunity to acquire knowledge (Nash, 2014). Also, women were able to\n\npursue male-dominated careers, which over the years were fully accompanied by men and not\n\nregarded to suit the Women, but due to the progressive movement by the National organization\n\nof women, a majority of women pursued courses such as law and Medicine. Lastly, the political\n\nsectors are another area where the women's rights movement changed how women were\n\nperceived regarding topics about politics. We see in the 19th century the first wave of feminism\n\nwas fighting for voting rights to apply to women as they do to men. The women at the time push\n\nthe bills of rights to the congress, where it was passed which allowed women to vote in any\n\ngeneral election held by the country. The aspect of women also joining politics as politicians\n\nwere well presented by the women's rights movement at the time, ensuring Women could vie for\n\npolitical seats in the government.\n\nSources and Triggers to the Women’s Rights Movement Formation and Activities\n\nAccording to (Cobble, 2005) the issue of women been suppressed from voting was a\n\nstructural issue that needed to be solved and new laws implemented to cater to the rights of the\n\nwomen in the 19th century. The women at the time began the first wave of feminism that fought\n\nfor their rights by writing a bill that would allow them to vote, which was an important issue as\n\nwomen were not considered in any general election at the time. Also, (Moon, 2011) states\n\nWorkplace discrimination in workplaces led to the rise of the Women's rights movement as\n\nwomen underwent unequal pay and was discriminated against while given inferior work\n\npositions in organizations. The root causes of the above were centered upon the systematic\n\nfavoritism of male gender hence required new laws that would protect women in the workplace\n\nfrom been taken advantage of and ensuring they could be treated equally despite the job they\n\nassigned in any organization. Furthermore, (Eckel & Moyn, 2013) illustrates the issue of\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n6\n\nincreased unequal opportunities such as education advancement was highly prioritized to the\n\nmale gender, whom were viewed by society to be much superior that the female gender. The\n\nwomen's rights movement aimed to change the perceptive of the narrative by ensuring colleges\n\nand universities were able to offer the same opportunities to women to pursue further education.\n\nIt allowed women to undertake in courses which were referred to as for the male gender only\n\nsuch as Medicine and law which over the years through the efforts of the NOW women were\n\nable to acquire the same education although not taken seriously by the lecturers but were able to\n\nfulfill their objectives and get hired in workplaces they had studied in the university. Also,\n\n(Houck & Dixon, 2009) states that the systemic gender bias is still evident in how women were\n\nnot offered any opportunities to pursue further education, but the male gender was able hence\n\nleading to the women rights movement been formed to ensure that women have the same equal\n\nopportunities in the society by influencing change in the society. Lastly, the issue of lack of\n\nwomen in political positions or in leadership roles as we see the national organization for women\n\ntabled bills such as ERA to the congress and also held talks with NASA to cater for the women\n\nto be considered in the astronaut programs.\n\nSpecific Issues and triggers by the Party\n\nThe National Women’s party main issue under the leadership of Alice Paul was fighting\n\nfor equal rights for the women in the society. Also, (Mountjoy & McNeese, 2007) states that the\n\nissue of women not been able to vote was one of the inequalities faced by many women in the\n\nsociety hence led to a bill of women rights formulated that stated women would be allowed to\n\nvote, which was passed by congress. Another inequality faced by women was their right to own\n\nproperty at the time which triggered the response of the National woman party to write bills that\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\nwould be presented to the congress allowing women the ability to own their own property\n\nwithout any presence of a man in the title deed which in the long run was implemented allowing\n\nwomen to have sole ownership of properties. Also, the issue of workplace discrimination of\n\nwomen was another issue that needed to be addressed hence requiring the National organization\n\nfor women to recruit more members to join hence writing billings to the congress to ensure\n\nwomen were protected in the workplace. Again, (Nash, 2014) illustrates the unequal pay\n\nexperienced by the women in workplaces was another issue that needed to be addressed during\n\nthe third and fourth waves of feminism, where bills were tabled to the congress for approval\n\nenabling women to have increased wages. The issue of unequal opportunities in the society was\n\nanother issue which triggered the National organization of Women to act as women were not\n\nallowed to further their education in the universities or colleges until more bill of rights were\n\nintroduced and approved by the congress enabling the women to pursue course such as law and\n\nMedicine which were viewed to be male-dominated fields of study while offering the safe\n\nopportunity of knowledge to women was essential to ensure social cohesion between the two\n\ngenders (www.lib.umd.edu/unions).\n\nSupporting and Opposing Parties and other Key Stakeholders Parties\n\nFurthermore, (Vetter, 2017) discusses the United Autoworkers were responsible\n\nfor the support of the National organization of women by providing them with the necessary\n\nspace and equipment for them to start by establishing themselves to the rest of the national\n\nparties at the time. However, the United Auto Workers retracted their support on the NOW after\n\nthey pushed the ERA bill, which to them went against the other outstanding laws enacted to\n\nensure abortion was illegal. The ERA bill tried to bring a message that abortion was a necessary\n\n7\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n8\n\nsocial practice required which was not agreed upon by the shareholders in United Auto Workers\n\ntogether with half of the member faction in the organization NOW who left the Party to form\n\nother radical groups whose aim was to try to liberate the women in the country. The leaders of\n\nthe National organization of women after passing the ERA bill became more confident in their\n\napproaches as they held meetings with high government and private officials such as NASA,\n\nwho the union talked about incorporating women in the space program. Also, (Wagner, 2019)\n\nstates the leaders of NOW also discussed more tabling of women's rights to congress with the\n\nhelp of the government officials, ensuring they focused on the issues faced by women in society.\n\nHowever, the national organization of women over time after passing the ERA which led to the\n\ndwindling power by NOW as the policies that had implemented were started to be revised as\n\nthey made more harm than good and most women in the union groups question whether the laws\n\nwere created out of good response.\n\nStrategies and Tactics Use by Women’s Rights Movement\n\nMoreover, (Walby, 2002) illustrates how the leaders who organized the women's\n\nrights used the three following tactics and movement, which includes; firstly, they took control\n\nof the media, which included partnering with the local newspapers, which at the time served as a\n\nform communication to many people in the nation to receive communication. The organizers\n\ntook advantage of that situation by reaching out to other women who understood their cause and\n\njoined them to end the unequal treatment they faced in workplaces. Secondly, (Ware, 2015)\n\ndetails how the organizers of the women's rights movement ensured that the women in the group\n\nwould be placed in hire roles in the society such as school boards, newspaper editors, secretaries\n\nto major politicians, and even some women run for congress seats to boast their narrative.\n\nAccording to (Wollstonecraft, 2019) the approach allowed the NOW party to have power in\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n9\n\nvarious sectors in the society, giving them an advantage as to when they are portraying their\n\nmessage to society. Lastly, (Nash, 2014) Shows how the women rights movement organizers\n\nwere responsible for getting the votes that were required to elect qualified individuals into the\n\ngovernment seat after women were allowed to vote hence putting people in the congress that can\n\ndrive their bills written by the National Organization of women party which will aim to benefit\n\nthe women from unequal society .The leaders aim to acquire the necessary supporters and update\n\nthem over the election preceding by giving information on people who have voted and the people\n\nwho had not hence helping them to find other alternatives in an aim for them to cast their vote\n\nthe candidate backed by the women party.\n\nDynamics within the Movement and the Society\n\nAccording to (Moon, 2011) he suggests that the women's rights movement accomplished\n\nsocial change where women were allowed to vote and choose leaders into the government. It\n\nallowed women to elect leaders who would champion their rights in congress, ensuring their\n\nneeds are met through the implementation of laws that would protect women in society. Also,\n\nrestrictions of women from not attending colleges and universities were lifted as we see the laws\n\nchanged, which allowed women to pursue educational fields that were viewed to be maledominated such as Medicine and law. Again, ensuring that women could pursue education was\n\nthe most important social changes as it opened up opportunities for other women to have\n\nindependence from men. Moreover, (Mountjoy & McNeese, 2007) states the women's rights\n\nmovement was behind the political change of the culture in the country where women were\n\nstarting to get elected to congress, hence they pushed for equal treatment in the society to the\n\nother male gender Lastly, the movement sparked the economic change that was required in\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n10\n\nregards to how women were being discriminated in workplaces and how they faced unequal pay\n\nwhile they worked in the same positions as some of the males in her department. It led to the\n\nNational organization for women writing bills of rights that ensured women were protected in\n\nworkplaces resulting in the congress passing the bill, and new laws were enacted which saw\n\nwomen having increased wage and also protected from cases of physical or sexual discrimination\n\nin the workplace. However, (Cobble, 2005) states the bills such as ERA which were pushed by\n\nNOW to congress to be passed in the end run worked against women in the society as there were\n\nhigher rates of teen pregnancies with even many members of the unions questioning whether the\n\nlaws about abortion if they were faced with helping the women or holding back women in the\n\nsociety.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe research paper goes through the historical, social, political, and economic concept\n\nof how the women's rights movement impacted the various areas either positively or negatively.\n\nAlso, the essay discusses the strategies used by the organizers of the women's rights movement\n\nto reach a high number of members across the country. Lastly, the paper illustrates the sources\n\nand triggers of the women's rights movement and the outcomes which have occurred on whether\n\nthey have resulted in benefiting of the women in the society and why the movement was\n\nessential to ensure women's rights were protected in the society.\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n11\n\nReferences\n\nCobble, D.

The social movement aimed to seek equal rights and opportunities together\n\nwith freedom for women to undertake and be recognized in different fields of work-study.\n\nMoreover, the women's rights movement had four phases where the first wave of feminism was\n\nduring the 19th and early 20th century, where the women at the time focused on their rights to\n\nperform certain actions such as voting (Pace, 2020). Alternatively, the second wave began from\n\nthe early 1960s to 1970, followed up with the third and fourth feminism waves from 1990 to\n\n2010, where women at this stage championed equal opportunities in the society. It's evident after\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n3\n\nthe end of world war two there was an improved economy hence the high demand for employees\n\nin the industries, which did not necessarily require one to use a lot of energy. It led to women\n\nbeen employed at such jobs but were not treated equally as their counterpart gender as they were\n\nbeen given less wage and worked way more than the other males in the same job position.\n\nFurthermore, due to suppression of the women in workplaces, it led to author Betty Friedan in\n\npublishing The Feminine Mystique in 1963, which illustrated the hardship women in the society\n\nundergo due to the discrimination from the other gender and society (Stone, 2020). The book\n\nbecame a best-seller, which attracted a large following of women around the country; hence a\n\nsection of women joined with union leaders and government officials in an aim to lobby a bill\n\nthat will protect women from workplace discrimination and equal pay. However, they later\n\nrealized their requests to the congress were ignored; hence in 1966, the women created their own\n\nunion called the National Organization for Women (NOW).\n\nDespite the small number of members in the agency, they were able to write six\n\ncritical bills of rights for women that would serve all the women in the country. In addition, they\n\nadded two more bills of rights for women, where one of them required the approval of the equal\n\nrights of Amendment (ERA) to the Constitution of the country. At the time, the National\n\norganization for women was fully backed and supported by the United Auto Workers, who help\n\nthe women's organization with free office space. The withdraw of the United Autoworkers led to\n\na faction of members in the National organization for women to leave the group, which led to\n\nNOW struggling to establish itself to other organizations that were critically acclaimed in the\n\ncountry. Also, half of the members in the National organization for women were based in New\n\nYork who grew tired of the traditional activities portrayed by the leaders of the organization\n\nhence branched out and started radical women groups (Furchtgott-Roth, 2012). However, as the\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n4\n\nremaining members of the National organization for women focused on issues that were\n\naffecting women, the other radical groups pursued liberation of women in the workplaces and\n\ntried to change the perspective of the society towards the role of women (Peters & Wolper,\n\n2018). Eventually, in 1969 the national organization for women was able to call congress to unite\n\nthe women in the country, which increased the popularity of the organization where over five\n\nhundred women joined from New York. The leaders of the National organization for women\n\nstarted interacting with politicians through lobbying of bills that would favor the women while at\n\nthe same time involving agencies such as NASA to include Women in their space programs.\n\nAgain, the women's rights by NOW where intensified where we see the ERA bill been passed in\n\n1972, which was attribute by the efforts of Betty Friedan .However, after the passage of the bill\n\nthe women received a huge backlash from individuals such as anti-feminists Phyllis Sclafly who\n\ncondemned the passage of the amendment hence organizing a demonstration. Phyllis pointed out\n\nkey aspects about the bill passed on how it would conflict with the existing bills such\n\ninvalidating laws set up about sodomy or, in the long run, legalize same-sex marriage (Laville,\n\n2002).\n\nBy the 1990s, the women's rights movement had impacted various sectors,\n\nespecially the economy, as women were able to own property rights, which allowed them to buy\n\nand own land without the restriction of a man to be present in the signing of the title deeds.\n\nMoreover, women were able to reduce workplace discrimination, which ensures the women were\n\nfully respected by their counter gender enabling good working conditions in the organizations.\n\nThere was also the change of equal pay where women were able to earn more money, which was\n\na big step up in the right direction towards the liberation of women. The other aspect that\n\nchanged a lot was the social sector, where we see in the 20th-century women were able to attend\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n5\n\ncolleges even though there were not many numbers as men but it showed progression to allow\n\nwomen to have an opportunity to acquire knowledge. Also, women were able to pursue maledominated careers, which over the years were fully accompanied by men and not regarded to suit\n\nthe Women, but due to the progressive movement by the National organization of women, a\n\nmajority of women pursued courses such as law and Medicine (Vickery, 2017). Lastly, the\n\npolitical sectors are another area where the women's rights movement changed how women were\n\nperceived regarding topics about politics. We see in the 19th century the first wave of feminism\n\nwas fighting for voting rights to apply to women as they do to men. The women at the time push\n\nthe bills of rights to the congress, where it was passed which allowed women to vote in any\n\ngeneral election held by the country. The aspect of women also joining politics as politicians\n\nwere well presented by the women's rights movement at the time, ensuring Women could vie for\n\npolitical seats in the government.\n\nSources and Triggers to the Women’s Rights Movement Formation and Activities\n\nThe issue of women been suppressed from voting was a structural issue that needed to be\n\nsolved and new laws implemented to cater to the rights of the women in the 19th century. The\n\nwomen at the time began the first wave of feminism that fought for their rights by writing a bill\n\nthat would allow them to vote, which was an important issue as women were not considered in\n\nany general election at the time. Also, Workplace discrimination in workplaces led to the rise of\n\nthe Women's rights movement as women underwent unequal pay and was discriminated against\n\nwhile given inferior work positions in organizations (Gleadle, 2016). The root causes of the\n\nabove were centered upon the systematic favoritism of male gender hence required new laws that\n\nwould protect women in the workplace from been taken advantage of and ensuring they could be\n\ntreated equally despite the job they assigned in any organization. Furthermore, the issue of\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n6\n\nincreased unequal opportunities such as education advancement was highly prioritized to the\n\nmale gender, whom were viewed by society to be much superior that the female gender (Gibson,\n\n2017). The women's rights movement aimed to change the perceptive of the narrative by\n\nensuring colleges and universities were able to offer the same opportunities to women to pursue\n\nfurther education. It allowed women to undertake in courses which were referred to as for the\n\nmale gender only such as Medicine and law which over the years through the efforts of the NOW\n\nwomen were able to acquire the same education although not taken seriously by the lecturers but\n\nwere able to fulfill their objectives and get hired in workplaces they had studied in the university.\n\nAlso, the systemic gender bias is still evident in how women were not offered any opportunities\n\nto pursue further education, but the male gender was able hence leading to the women rights\n\nmovement been formed to ensure that women have the same equal opportunities in the society\n\nby influencing change in the society (Laville, 2002). Lastly, the issue of lack of women in\n\npolitical positions or in leadership roles as we see the national organization for women tabled\n\nbills such as ERA to the congress and also held talks with NASA to cater for the women to be\n\nconsidered in the astronaut programs.\n\nSpecific Issues and triggers by the Party\n\nThe National Women’s party main issue under the leadership of Alice Paul was fighting\n\nfor equal rights for the women in the society. The issue of women not been able to vote was one\n\nof the inequalities faced by many women in the society hence led to a bill of women rights\n\nformulated that stated women would be allowed to vote, which was passed by congress. Another\n\ninequality faced by women was their right to own property at the time which triggered the\n\nresponse of the National woman party to write bills that would be presented to the congress\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n7\n\nallowing women the ability to own their own property without any presence of a man in the title\n\ndeed which in the long run was implemented allowing women to have sole ownership of\n\nproperties (Clatterbaugh, 2018). Also, the issue of workplace discrimination of women was\n\nanother issue that needed to be addressed hence requiring the National organization for women\n\nto recruit more members to join hence writing billings to the congress to ensure women were\n\nprotected in the workplace. Again, the unequal pay experienced by the women in workplaces\n\nwas another issue that needed to be addressed during the third and fourth waves of feminism,\n\nwhere bills were tabled to the congress for approval enabling women to have increased wages\n\n(Furchtgott-Roth, 2012). The issue of unequal opportunities in the society was another issue\n\nwhich triggered the National organization of Women to act as women were not allowed to\n\nfurther their education in the universities or colleges until more bill of rights were introduced and\n\napproved by the congress enabling the women to pursue course such as law and Medicine which\n\nwere viewed to be male-dominated fields of study while offering the safe opportunity of\n\nknowledge to women was essential to ensure social cohesion between the two genders.\n\nSupporting and Opposing Parties and other Key Stakeholders Parties\n\nThe United Autoworkers were responsible for the support of the National\n\norganization of women by providing them with the necessary space and equipment for them to\n\nstart by establishing themselves to the rest of the national parties at the time. However, the\n\nUnited Auto Workers retracted their support on the NOW after they pushed the ERA bill, which\n\nto them went against the other outstanding laws enacted to ensure abortion was illegal\n\n(Furchtgott-Roth, 2012). The ERA bill tried to bring a message that abortion was a necessary\n\nsocial practice required which was not agreed upon by the shareholders in United Auto Workers\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n8\n\ntogether with half of the member faction in the organization NOW who left the Party to form\n\nother radical groups whose aim was to try to liberate the women in the country. The leaders of\n\nthe National organization of women after passing the ERA bill became more confident in their\n\napproaches as they held meetings with high government and private officials such as NASA,\n\nwho the union talked about incorporating women in the space program (Clatterbaugh, 2018).\n\nThe leaders of NOW also discussed more tabling of women's rights to congress with the help of\n\nthe government officials, ensuring they focused on the issues faced by women in society.\n\nHowever, the national organization of women over time after passing the ERA which led to the\n\ndwindling power by NOW as the policies that had implemented were started to be revised as\n\nthey made more harm than good and most women in the union groups question whether the laws\n\nwere created out of good response.\n\nStrategies and Tactics Use by Women’s Rights Movement\n\nThe leaders who organized the women's rights used the three following tactics\n\nand movement, which includes, firstly, they took control of the media, which included partnering\n\nwith the local newspapers, which at the time served as a form communication to many people in\n\nthe nation to receive communication (Vickery, 2017). The organizers took advantage of that\n\nsituation by reaching out to other women who understood their cause and joined them to end the\n\nunequal treatment they faced in workplaces. Secondly, the organizers of the women's rights\n\nmovement ensured that the women in the group would be placed in hire roles in the society such\n\nas school boards, newspaper editors, secretaries to major politicians, and even some women run\n\nfor congress seats to boast their narrative (Bell, 2018). According to (Furchtgott-Roth,\n\n2012). The approach allowed the NOW party to have power in various sectors in the society,\n\ngiving them an advantage as to when they are portraying their message to society. Lastly, the\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n9\n\nwomen rights movement organizers were responsible for getting the votes that were required to\n\nelect qualified individuals into the government seat after women were allowed to vote hence\n\nputting people in the congress that can drive their bills written by the National Organization of\n\nwomen party which will aim to benefit the women from unequal society (Peters & Wolper,\n\n2018). The leaders aim to acquire the necessary supporters and update them over the election\n\npreceding by giving information on people who have voted and the people who had not hence\n\nhelping them to find other alternatives in an aim for them to cast their vote the candidate backed\n\nby the women party.\n\nDynamics within the Movement and the Society\n\nThe women's rights movement accomplished social change where women were allowed\n\nto vote and choose leaders into the government. It allowed women to elect leaders who would\n\nchampion their rights in congress, ensuring their needs are met through the implementation of\n\nlaws that would protect women in society (Stone, 2020). Also, restrictions of women from not\n\nattending colleges and universities were lifted as we see the laws changed, which allowed\n\nwomen to pursue educational fields that were viewed to be male-dominated such as Medicine\n\nand law. Again, ensuring that women could pursue education was the most important social\n\nchanges as it opened up opportunities for other women to have independence from men.\n\nMoreover, the women's rights movement was behind the political change of the culture in the\n\ncountry where women were starting to get elected to congress, hence they pushed for equal\n\ntreatment in the society to the other male gender (Bair, 2020). Lastly, the movement sparked the\n\neconomic change that was required in regards to how women were being discriminated in\n\nworkplaces and how they faced unequal pay while they worked in the same positions as some of\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n10\n\nthe males in her department. It led to the National organization for women writing bills of rights\n\nthat ensured women were protected in workplaces resulting in the congress passing the bill, and\n\nnew laws were enacted which saw women having increased wage and also protected from cases\n\nof physical or sexual discrimination in the workplace (Bell, 2018). However, bills such ERA\n\nwhich were pushed by NOW to congress to be passed in the end run worked against women in\n\nthe society as there were higher rates of teen pregnancies with even many members of the unions\n\nquestioning whether the laws about abortion if they were faced with helping the women or\n\nholding back women in the society.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe research paper goes through the historical, social, political, and economic concept\n\nof how the women's rights movement impacted the various areas either positively or negatively.\n\nAlso, the essay discusses the strategies used by the organizers of the women's rights movement\n\nto reach a high number of members across the country. Lastly, the paper illustrates the sources\n\nand triggers of the women's rights movement and the outcomes which have occurred on whether\n\nthey have resulted in benefiting of the women in the society and why the movement was\n\nessential to ensure women's rights were protected in the society.\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n11\n\nReferences\n\nBair, S.
