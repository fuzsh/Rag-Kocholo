        "text": "Betty Jean Norvell Downs was born March 10, 1928, in San Francisco, California and passed away May 28, 2023, in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Her parents were Driskill A. (Dan) and Clarissa Norvell.\n\nBetty moved to Texas with her parents in 1942. She first attended Nederland High and made several lifelong friendships, joining in Nederland class reunions over the decades. They later moved to Beaumont where she graduated from Beaumont High in 1945. Betty married Tony Downs in January of 1945, and they settled in Beaumont after the war. She first worked in Mr. Thomas Lombardo’s shop downtown for a few years, and later worked for Pittsburg Plate Glass, where she also made lifelong friendships. During the 50’s to early 70’s, as they began raising their family, she helped her husband with his plumbing company, and had a fabric store for a while called The Fabric Garden.\n\nIn the mid 70’s Betty began working full time, later retiring in 1992 from PageNet in Houston, where she’d transferred for several years. She moved back to Beaumont to be close to family again and worked part-time for Burns Properties for over 20 years. During retirement, while also having more time for her favorite hobbies, cooking and sewing/quilting, she found great joy in being a grandmother, and also enjoyed spending time with friends, traveling, and being in Bible Study Fellowship for seven years. Many years ago, she was a member of Westgate Church of Christ. Over the last 30 years she attended First Christian Church of Sour Lake, then was a member of Northwood Christian Church, later moving her membership to Calvary Baptist Church. Betty made good and lasting friendships wherever she worked or attended church.\n\nMost recently she had moved to Colorado Springs with her daughter, Deborah.\n\nBetty treasured her family and friends, and among other things, especially enjoyed cooking, sewing, games, and traveling. She was fun-loving and generous, especially with her tasty recipes. Betty was a Christian and would often say in recent years that God is good; that He’d taken care of her all her life, even when she didn’t know it at the time, and she knew He would always take care of her.\n\nBetty was an only child but had quite a few cousins, whom she loved dearly. She is survived by her daughters, Deborah Waguspack and husband Michael; Clara Storey and husband Gary; grandchildren, Jace Waguspack and wife, Jessica; Grant Waguspack and wife, Sarah; and Amanda Williams and husband, Wade; and great-grandchildren, Luke and Autumn Waguspack (Jace’s); Joshua Ashe, Iris Mase, and Rachel Waguspack (Grant’s). She is preceded in death by her son, Anthony C Downs, III; and her former husband, Anthony C. (Tony) Downs, Jr.\n\nA gathering of Mrs. Downs’ family and friends will be from 4:00 p.m. until 7:00 p.m., Friday, June 9, 2023, at Broussard’s, 2000 McFaddin Avenue, Beaumont. Her funeral service will be 10:00 a.m., Saturday, June 10, 2023, at Broussard’s, Beaumont, with her interment to follow at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Beaumont."
