        "text": "History of Relief Society\n\nIn the spring of 1842, Sarah Melissa Granger Kimball and her seamstress, Margaret A. Cook, discussed combining their efforts to assist the efforts of workers on the Nauvoo Temple. Sarah donated cloth to make shirts for the men working on the temple, and Margaret agreed to do the sewing. Shortly thereafter, some of Sarah's neighbors also desired to participate in the shirt making. During a meeting in the Kimball parlor, they determined to formally organize a Ladies' Society. Kimball asked Eliza R. Snow to write a constitution and by-laws for the organization for submission to Joseph Smith, Jr. for review. • After reviewing the notes, Joseph commented that \"this is not what you want.... [The Lord] has something better for them than a written constitution. ... I will organize the sisters under the priesthood after a pattern of the priesthood.\" He further said, \"The Church was never fully organized until the women were thus organized.\" (as quoted in History of Relief Society 1842-1966, p. 18)\n\nEighteen women gathered on Thursday, 17 March 1842 in the second story meeting room over Joseph Smith's Red Brick Store in Nauvoo, Illinois. Joseph Smith, John Taylor, and Willard Richards sat on the platform at the upper end of the room with the women facing them. \"The Spirit of God Like A Fire is Burning\" was sung, and John Taylor opened the meeting with prayer. Joseph Smith then organized the women in attendance. • Joseph Smith stated \"the object of the Society—that the Society of Sisters might provoke the brethren to good works in looking to the wants of the poor—searching after objects of charity and in administering to their wants—to assist by correcting morals and strengthening the virtues of the community, and save the Elders the trouble of rebuking; that they may give their time to other duties, &c, in their public teaching.\" (History of Relief Society 1842-1966, p. 18)\n\nThe prophet also proposed that the women elect a presiding officer who would choose two counselors to assist her. Joseph's wife, Emma Hale Smith, was elected unanimously as president. She chose Sarah M. Cleveland and Elizabeth Ann Whitney as her two counselors. John Taylor was appointed to ordain the women and did so. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that the name of the fledgling organization be changed to \"The Female Relief Society of Nauvoo.\" • Joseph Smith then offered five dollars in gold to commence the funds of the Society and the men left the room. • Eliza R. Snow was unanimously elected as secretary, Phebe M. Wheeler as Assistant Secretary, and Elvira A. Coles, Treasurer. Emma Smith remarked that each member should be ambitious to do good and seek out and relieve the distressed. Several female members then made donations to the Society.\n\nThe men returned, and John Taylor and Willard Richards also made donations. After singing \"Come Let Us Rejoice,\" the meeting was adjourned to meet on the following Thursday at 10 o'clock. John Taylor then gave a closing prayer. • Later in his journal, the Prophet recorded: \"I attended by request the Female Relief Society, whose object is the relief of the poor, the destitute, the widow, and the orphan, and for the exercise of all benevolent purposes\" (History of Relief Society 1842-1966, p. 61).\n\nAs sisters in Relief Society today, we have a rich and faithful heritage. One hundred sixty six (166) years have passed since the Prophet Joseph Smith met with a small group in Nauvoo, Illinois, to organize the women of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We now number over five and a half million Relief Society sisters in 170 countries across the earth. Like those who preceded us, we stand today united in faith, steadfast in following the living prophet, and committed to building the kingdom of God. Those founding sisters came from different circumstances—three of them were in their late teens, some were raising families, and others were single. Then and now, as women of all ages, marital statuses, and cultures, we consecrate ourselves to the cause of Christ through our service.\n\nThe next slides are organized by the period of service of each of the Relief Society general presidents, chronicles some joyful milestones of the organization’s legacy and some Church and historical events. As Relief Society sisters today, we too rejoice in the Lord’s organization for women, which helps us as we strive daily to keep our covenants, exercise charity, strengthen families, and ultimately come unto the Savior Jesus Christ.\n\n1842–44Emma H.

Hinckley joined Relief Society general president Bonnie D. Parkin in a ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the refurbishing of the 50-year-old Relief Society Building. After reflecting back upon those faithful women who contributed of their means to building this “home” for the Relief Society, President Hinckley looked to the future as he stated: “God bless the women of the Relief Society. May they go forward in strength and power, in virtue and capacity, and move forward.”\n\nFrom the Nauvoo days, the Relief Society sisters had a dream of having a building of their own in the shadow of the temple. In a letter to Sister Belle S. Spafford dated September 16, 1947, the First Presidency—President George Albert Smith, J. Reuben Clark, and David O. McKay—approved the details for the fundraising campaign for the building. Under the inspired direction of Sister Spafford, the Relief Society general president at the time, and with the approval of the First Presidency, a financial plan was created in which each Relief Society sister throughout the world was asked to contribute five dollars to cover a total of half of the building’s construction costs. Within one year the faithful sisters of Relief Society had exceeded that goal. In the fall of 1956, the building was dedicated to the sisters’ exclusive use by the prophet David O. McKay. As part of the dedicatory prayer, he said: “To make more effective their service to the needy and suffering to those in the Church and in the World, the Relief Society has erected with the aid of the Church membership this beautiful Relief Society home in which the Presidency and members of the General Board may function more effectively in instructing, guiding, and rendering helpful aid to the Stakes, Wards, and Missionary Branches wherever organized.” [Relief Society Magazine, Dec. 1956, 789; italics removed]\n\nThe Relief Society Today The Relief Society meets each Sunday (excluding conferences) during regular Sunday worship services. Weekly lesson topics include messages from former prophets, current Church leaders, and lessons planned by the local Relief Society presidency to meet local needs. Relief Society sisters also gather four times a year for Home, Family, and Personal Enrichment Meetings. These meetings are organized and planned by local Relief Society leaders to meet spiritual needs in their locations. At Enrichment Meetings, women strengthen each other in their common roles as wives, mothers, sisters in Zion, and daughters of God. One Enrichment Meeting per year is held to commemorate the organization of the Relief Society. Enrichment Activities are held as needs arise. They are planned by local Relief Society presidencies to meet the needs of specific groups within the Relief Society that share similar interests or needs. Visitors are welcome to attend Enrichment meetings or activities. Groups of several Relief Societies meet together twice annually for Stake Enrichment Meetings planned by stake Relief Society leaders. One of these meetings corresponds with the annual Relief Society General Broadcast, when the Relief Society General Presidency and a priesthood leader address Mormon women 18 and older by satellite transmission.\n\nThe Relief Society Declaration We are beloved spirit daughters of God, and our lives have meaning, purpose, and direction.

And we are blessed to belong to an organization, the Relief Society, which teaches us that as daughters of God our lives have meaning, purpose and direction. Now, think of just one way that YOUR life has meaning, purpose and direction.
