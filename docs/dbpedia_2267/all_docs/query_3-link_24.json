        "text": "The page numbers on pages 19–71, 86–90, and 122–125 are in the handwriting of Willard Richards; on pages 72–85, 91–121, 126–167, and 171–477, in the handwriting of William Clayton; and on pages 168–170, in the handwriting of Erastus Derby. There are two pages numbered 453. Pages 476–477 constitute the last leaf of lined paper. The headers generally consist of a year or a month and year. The headers inscribed on pages 26–27, 29–71, 88–95, 119, and 121–126 are in the handwriting of Richards; the headers inscribed on pages 28, 72–87, 96–118, 120, 127–167, and 172–215 are in the handwriting of Clayton; pages 168–171, which were inscribed by Derby, have no headers. A few other pages are missing headers.\n\nThis parenthetical statement reflects a comment JS made 3 October 1841 during the same conference: “There shall be no more baptisms for the dead, until the ordinance can be attended to in the font of the Lord’s House; and the church shall not hold another general conference, until they can meet in said house. For thus saith the Lord!” Although church leaders continued holding conferences, none was designated a “general conference” until October 1845. (“Minutes of a Conference,” Times and Seasons, 15 Oct. 1841, 2:578, italics in original; “Conference Minutes,” Times and Seasons, 1 Nov. 1845, 6:1008–1016; “First Meeting in the Temple,” Times and Seasons, 1 Nov. 1845, 6:1017–1018.)\n\nTimes and Seasons. Commerce/Nauvoo, IL. Nov. 1839–Feb. 1846.\n\nAmong other things, this revelation gave the injunction to build the Nauvoo House and instructions for building the temple in Nauvoo. The water-damaged manuscript also contains a brief revelation dated 20 March 1841, authorizing William Allred and Henry Miller to be stock agents for the Nauvoo House Association. This Allred and Miller revelation is recorded on page 15 of the Book of the Law of the Lord and under the entry of 20 March 1841 in JS’s manuscript history. In addition to the two revelations, the last page of the manuscript contains a note recording that JS laid the cornerstone of the Nauvoo House.

Thompson by Kimball and published in 1840 while Kimball was on his second mission to England. (Robert B. Thompson, Journal of Heber C.
