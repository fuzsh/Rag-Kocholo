        "text": "Wayne Anderson, 87-year-old of Clarissa, passed away on Sunday, January 28, 2024, at the St. Williams Living Center in Parkers Prairie.\n\nA funeral in his honor will take place on Saturday, February 3, 2024, at the Shepherd of the Valley Lutheran Church in Clarissa at 11:00 AM. Visitation will take place that morning from 9:30 AM until the start of the funeral. Burial with military honors will immediately follow at the Woodman Cemetery in rural Clarissa.\n\nWayne Laverne Anderson was born on August 17, 1936, to his parents Andrew X. and Nellie (Opsal) Anderson in Long Prairie. He went to heaven on Sunday, January 27, 2024. He attended school in the Clarissa Public school system beginning with country school in rural Clarissa. He graduated in 1954 from Clarissa High School. He entered the Air Force in 1954 and served until 1958 doing time in Georgia and in Tripoli, Libya. He also was called back into the Air Force Reserves during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.\n\nHe married Sharon Peterson in 1958. Four children were born to them—Teri, Cindy, Rick and Sandy. Over the years, he had many jobs. He worked in the Clarissa Creamery, the Park Movie Theater in Clarissa, the Clarissa Co-Op gas station, the Sears Auto store at Brookdale Mall in Brooklyn Center, the Todd County Highway Department, Oscar’s gas station, part time policeman for the City of Clarissa, policeman/bouncer at the Clarissa ballroom, and a school bus driver. In 1972, he purchased a gas station in Clarissa that became “Wayne’s Station” until 1984. He took a position at a horse stable in Victoria, Minnesota, and then became employed with the State of Minnesota Highway Department out of the Golden Valley location in 1987. He transferred to the Motley site and retired from there in 2005. He made his home in Clarissa until 1985 and lived many years in Staples. He was a resident of St. Williams Living Center in Parkers Prairie after the effects of alcohol and Parkinson’s Disease became a physical disability.\n\nHe was a cowboy at heart and enjoyed his horses. He volunteered on the County Sheriff’s Mounted Posse Research and Rescue. He could do more field work with his dad’s team of horses than his brother, “Doc” with a tractor. He was a good father to his children instilling in them responsibility by having various types of animals every summer to take care of, playing baseball, badminton and basketball in the yard, riding horse with them, shooting clay pigeons, fishing, taking them to the Wadena Sales Barn on Saturdays and auction sales around the area. All four children worked in the gas station with their dad. He played and managed the town baseball team for Clarissa and took them to the State Baseball Tournament. He also played softball for several years and bowled on leagues. He served on the Clarissa School Board, Our Savior’s Lutheran Church Board, drove bus, chaperoned church youth events, and was a 4-H leader.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his parents, his siblings and their spouses—Evelyn (Ludwig) Schlosser, Doris (Awald) Schlosser, Marie (Ben) Lunemann, Donald (Loretta) Anderson, Alan “Doc” (Eileen) Anderson, and son-in-law, Kevin Brichacek.\n\nHe is survived by his children—Teri (Chuck) Johnson of Maple Grove, Cindy (Wayne Finch) Brichacek of Sauk Centre, Rick (Sarah Stewart-Dwire) Anderson of Redwood Falls, and Sandy (Steve) Griese of Truman. He is also survived by 11 grandchildren, 25 great-grandchildren and many nieces and nephews.\n\nMany thanks to the wonderful staff at St. Williams Living Center in Parkers Prairies and for the caring hospice team of Douglas County."
