        "text": "A time to be born and a time to die: A time to plant, and a time to pluck what is planted; A time to kill and a time to heal; a time to break down, And a time to build up; a time to weep, and a time to laugh; A time to mourn and a time to dance. Ecclesiastes 3: 1-4\n\nOn July 15, 1945, Abe and Ples Williams were blessed with a loving baby boy whom they named Abe Williams, Jr. Abe accepted Christ at an early age and was baptized in 1955 by the late Pastor Frank Wilson at Mount Zion Baptist Church of Omega, LA. Abe loved the Lord. You could often find him talking about the Bible and singing Spirituals. During this Christian journey, he touched many lives. He was free-spirited, fun loving, and loved spending time with family and friends. He was selfless and always willing to take care of anyone he could. He loved to fish and spend time with “His Girls.” Pastor Williams was licensed to preach the gospel on March 1, 1991. He served as pastor at Mt. Mariah M.B. Church until his health failed him. He remained a member of First Colored Baptist Church until his transition from this side. He was preceded in death by his parents, Abe and Ples Williams, two sisters, Bernice Williams and Anna Washington. On June 3, 2019, our beloved father, brother, pastor, and friend entered into eternal rest at Legacy Nursing Home. He leaves to cherish his memories: thirteen children, with three being children whom he reared; Abe Williams III, Linda Williams, Donald Williams, Stephanie Holmes, Pamela Williams, Clarissa Williams, April Marshall-Boyd (John), Natasha Marshall, Giovanna Marshall, Kesheena Marshall, Stevie Marshall (Sharon), Isheka Marshall, and Quantina Marshall; one god-daughter, Toshiba-Bell Jones (Edward); his ONLY brother, Pastor Henry Williams (Ethel); three sisters, Dorthy Davis (Ray), Alma Kendrick (John), and Linda Dallas (D’Wayne); a wealth of grandchildren and great-grandchildren; and a host of nieces and nephews"
