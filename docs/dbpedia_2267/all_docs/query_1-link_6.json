        "text": "The Women’s Cooperative Movement in Utah, 1869–1915\n\nBy EILEEN V. WALLIS\n\nIt is distinctly understood that this is not a benevolent undertaking, but positively a business transaction,” the Woman’s Exponent, a Salt Lake City women’s newspaper, announced in its December 1, 1890, issue. In an article lauding the recent creation of a “Woman’s Store” in the city, the Exponent reminded its readers, “the management will be in the hands of women acquainted with business principles, consequently there is little need of uncertainty about its success as a safe investment for capital.” 1 While a store created to provide business opportunities for women might sound like a revolutionary development for nineteenth century America, it was actually part of a larger movement attempting to make Utah independent from the national economy. Official publications of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and newspapers such as the Woman’s Exponent (1872- 1914), constantly exhorted women to consume only locally made products. As a response to this call they entered enthusiastically into home manufacturing, grain storage, and silk production. Women’s attempts to, as the Deseret News put it, make “two blades of grass” grow “where one grew before” culminated in a series of female-run cooperatives in the 1870s and again in the 1890s. 2 These cooperatives, operated under the auspices of the church’s Female Relief Society, provided women with unprecedented opportunities to contribute to their family economies. Yet none of the stores achieved sustained economic success. The story of the rise and fall of female cooperatives can help us better understand how Mormon women struggled to balance the ideology of self-sufficiency promoted by their religion with the economic realities of late nineteenth and early twentieth century America.\n\nThe interest among nineteenth century Mormons in cooperative economic institutions had its roots in the earliest years of the church in Missouri. In 1831 Joseph Smith introduced the Law of Consecration and Stewardship. Smith envisioned an economic system that supported individual effort but also placed fundamental decisions about local economics in the hands of church leaders. Such policies would encourage the development of a self-sufficient community of believers, provide for the poor, and equalize income. The death of Smith and the migration of the saints to Utah temporarily forestalled further development of this ideal. 3\n\nOnce safely settled in Utah, the new leader, Brigham Young, implemented policies to bring Smith’s vision to life. Initially Young spoke against Mormons opening businesses that dealt in imported goods. He feared this would create an overdependence on eastern goods and prevent the Utah settlements from becoming self-sufficient. Non-Mormon merchants quickly stepped into the breech, happy to satisfy Mormon demand for imported manufactured goods. By the 1860s so many non-Mormon merchants had set up shop that Young began to fear their influence. 4 The rapid approach of the Transcontinental Railroad, which threatened to bring even more imports and non-Mormon influence to the Great Basin, fueled his concerns. Any increase in trade, Young felt, should be controlled by Mormons and in the interest of the community. 5\n\nA succession of experimental cooperatives had swept through Europe in the previous decades, and some Mormon immigrants from Great Britain had had first hand experience with such ventures. Young seized on the idea of cooperatives as the solution. Cooperatives would keep trade in Mormon hands while simultaneously preventing the development of a wealthy merchant class. 6 In 1864 leaders of the northern Utah town of Brigham City founded a cooperative institution. The Mormon emphasis on cooperative endeavor in all things encouraged the rapid spread of cooperative stores. 7 This movement became church-wide in the fall of 1868. 8\n\nThe most famous of these local cooperatives, Zion’s Cooperative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI), opened on May 1, 1869, and quickly became the central wholesale firm in Salt Lake City. ZCMI accepted home commodities on consignment or as payment on shares of stock to encourage those without cash to join. Stockholders had voting power in proportion to stock held. 9\n\nNot all cooperatives had the scale of ZCMI, however. Young also encouraged every ward and settlement to have its own cooperative store. Salt Lake City’s Tenth Ward opened the first of these “ward stores” in February 1869. In the last three decades of the nineteenth century one hundred and fifty retail cooperatives could be found scattered across Utah, with more in Idaho. 10 To join, such cooperatives usually required church membership as a prerequisite. Latter-day Saint organizations like the Relief Society could also join. The institutions tithed their net profits and the ecclesiastical officials in the ward usually became officers. The ward bishop often served as manager of the ward co-op. 11 Church leadership saw women as key to the success of the cooperatives. They argued women were more likely to demand and consume eastern-made goods, and thus could potentially undermine Mormon self-sufficiency. Moreover, women demanded goods that could not easily be produced at home, such as sugar, spices, ribbons, artificial flowers, and fabric. Account books from tithing stores show that wives and daughters consumed more fabric than any other imported commodity. 12 The question of how to temper female demand for manufactured goods remained a thorny one. As early as 1856 Heber C. Kimball explained how he handled these demands from the women in his family by saying to them: “Ladies, you don’t get me to buy you another ribbon, or artificial. If you want flowers in your hair, or in your bonnets, take the peach, apple, or other blossoms in their seasons, and then you will have the real instead of the artificial.” 13\n\nChurch leaders hoped goods produced locally and sold in cooperatives could satisfy demands for fabric and “artificals.”To keep women enthusiastic about the movement for self-sufficiency, Brigham Young also encouraged women to become involved in their local cooperatives. Their involvement had the added benefit of freeing men to become producers in agriculture and industry. Young argued that women could keep the books and sell goods in the co-ops just as capably as men did. 14 Female participation in home manufacturing received its biggest boost, however, from the Relief Society. In 1867 Eliza R. Snow began supervising the establishment of “Female Relief Societies” in every Mormon settlement in the Great Basin. President Young asked the Relief Societies to teach the poor to provide for themselves and to establish institutions and programs that “would assist the poor to live more comfortably and those not so poor to live more frugally.” 15 The LDS church assigned five official tasks to the Relief Societies: systematic retrenchment; the establishment and operation of cooperative stores specializing in merchandise of home manufacture; the promotion of home industry, particularly the silk industry; grain saving; and nursing, midwifery, and the maintenance of a hospital. 16 The Deseret News editorialized on the key role women could play in home industry:\n\nHere is a field ample enough to afford scope sufficient to the most ambitious, and we trust that our Female Relief Societies…can materially contribute in this manner to the independence of Zion. If he who causes two blades of grass to grow where one grew before is a benefactor to the human race, how much more is he or she who contributes to elevate a human being from helpless poverty to comparative industry! 17\n\nRelief Societies in several wards bought stock in their local cooperatives, and women participated eagerly in home manufacture. After a visit to the cooperative in Willard City, Eliza R. Snow proudly reported that women there manufactured straw for bonnets and also artificial flowers. When she asked for any woman wearing a homemade hat or bonnet to rise to her feet, two-thirds of the women present did so. 18 Some local Relief Societies went one step further and established their own cooperatives, such as the “Female Relief Society’s Cooperative Mercantile and Millinery Institution of Weber County,” which opened in 1869. 19 Financed by donations of labor and materials and the sale of quilts, carpets, and other products, the Ogden store operated out of its own building. The store opened its doors with $697 in capital and specialized in straw hats. 20 The ladies of the Fourteenth Ward in Salt Lake City opened a cooperative tailoring establishment in their Relief Society building, where they specialized in men’s and children’s clothing. 21 Relief Society members in Summit County opened a store that featured millinery work, hat making, and dressmaking. The store employed an average of five women. This branch of the Relief Society continuously reinvested its profits and paid for its building in four years. 22 In Paris, Idaho, the ladies of the Relief Society considered opening their own cooperative to market butter and eggs in Evanston, Wyoming. They sold stock at five dollars per share before deciding to support a new general cooperative store under male leadership instead. 23 The Manti Relief Society established its own female cooperative in April 1875, with a capital of $2,000, and paid its first dividends to shareholders the following October. 24 At the dedication of the Fifteenth Ward Relief Society Hall in November 1868, Relief Society President Sarah M. Kimball called the building “our store” and told the audience that while the upper story would be dedicated to art and science, the lower story would be dedicated to commerce and trade. 25 The Relief Society sold woolen cloth, carpet rags, spools of cotton, baby stockings, crewel and braid, dried fruits, valentines, buttons, shoes, and moccasins on commission to help pay for the building. 26\n\nWard cooperatives encouraged women to buy stock in male-run cooperatives, but many in the church hierarchy balked when Relief Society branches opened their own stores. The bishops argued that the Relief Society’s stores should remain under male direction. Women could manage the stores, they argued, but not dictate how they were run. 27 Eliza R. Snow countered that the women’s cooperatives should remain independent of the male church hierarchy and still receive its support. The Salt Lake stake bishops finally turned to President Young for clarification. Young responded that since some communities had failed to open cooperatives, he had asked the women to do so, knowing they would. Young smoothed over these differences by stressing the importance of unity in purpose to make Zion self-sufficient. 28 The Deseret Evening News echoed his sentiments:\n\nIn this city many of the female Relief Societies of the various wards have taken stock in the Cooperative Institutions. This is well; but it is not sufficient that they should be interested collectively….Women can wield a most potent influence in these matters, and it would be folly to ignore the fact. With women to aid in the great cause of reform, what wonderful changes can be effected! Without her aid how slow the progress! Give her responsibility, and she will prove that she is capable of great things. 29\n\nMormon women proved to be capable of “great things” in 1876, when they opened the Women’s Centennial Territorial Fair. Visitors paid ten cents to view numerous examples of women’s handiwork and creative abilities. The fair ultimately made a profit and the women donated it to charity. Pleased with their success, Brigham Young asked the Relief Society to turn the fair into a commission store. 30 Eliza R. Snow became president of this new organization, and on October 15, 1875, the Relief Society opened their new store in the Old Constitution Building, opposite ZCMI. 31 However, the store opened with no capital, so it could sell only on commission. 32 The loose plan seems to have been that until the store could sustain itself women would work without pay. 33 Eliza R. Snow entrusted the management of the store to the “prudent” Mrs. Mary Isabella Horne. 34 The Woman’s Commission Store’s first notice reported it “had for sale many useful and ornamental articles…[and] nearly all the varieties of church books.” 35\n\nThe larger goal of freeing Utah from its economic dependence on the East remained in the forefront of women’s minds as they promoted the Woman’s Commission Store. 36 The new LDS women’s publishing venture, the Woman’s Exponent, argued that the store “ought to receive the patronage of every person who has the best interests of Zion at heart...it is an enterprise which will be the nucleus of a great culminating system of financering within the Territory.” 37 Yet as in any business management leaders also had to keep the public up to date on new goods available in the store and to encourage women to buy there. The need for self-sufficiency and the need for more shoppers often intertwined in the store’s advertising. When store management advertised a new supply of shoes manufactured in Brigham City, for example, they also asked readers to consider making women’s underclothing and children’s suits to be put on sale. “There are many of these things made up in the East and brought here and sold,” the Exponent complained, “when our sisters might have the profit of the making.” 38\n\nThe Woman’s Commission Store prided itself on its female managers and the positive example it set for women throughout Utah. The Relief Society argued that household thrift and economy lay in the hands of women: “One of the lessons taught in an association of women should be to use money wisely and make better investments than the extravagant adornments of their own persons….The economizing and saving money from useless expenses and superfluous waste is one of the relative duties of woman to the household.” 39\n\nWomen in need of funds could sell goods in the Commission Store to support themselves and their families without stepping out of their proscribed sphere of the home. The Relief Society cooperative stores carried goods women used in their normal domestic activities; there was nary a plow, axe, or hammer to be seen. 40\n\nWhile they spoke out against patronizing gentile, or non-Mormon, merchants, Relief Society records are silent on where non-Mormon women fit into these schemes. Gentile women may or may not have been permitted to sell goods in the cooperatives. However, relations between the two groups of women in the 1870s had been strained over the issue of polygamy, and non-Mormon women participated in a wide variety of their own social clubs. Thus, few probably patronized the Commission Store or understood Mormon women’s commitment to self-sufficiency. 41\n\nIn the Woman’s Exponent, the Commission Store advertised its continually increasing stock of goods. By 1877 it sold not only all sorts of fabric and sewing supplies but also New Zealand flax seed, eggs, brooms, canned fruit, silver plating, and “R. Matthews and Co.’s Essence of Jamaica Ginger.” 42 Along with these advertisements came frequent exhortations for women to patronize the store and “use every effort possible to make it a complete success.” 43 Women from many different settlements took their goods to be sold on commission. The Commission Store also provided employment for women in a dressmaking department. Historian Leonard J. Arrington argued that the store proved so successful that Relief Societies in Brigham City, Provo, Parowan, and St. George opened similar establishments. 44 Yet by 1881 the Salt Lake City Commission Store had disappeared and the others rapidly followed suit. What went wrong?\n\nTwo types of difficulties may help explain the demise of the women’s commission stores.The first can be characterized as external: problems such as competition and economic changes over which the cooperatives had little or no control.\n\nOutside competition increased with the arrival of the railroad in 1869, just as Brigham Young had feared. Isolation had made it difficult and expensive to obtain manufactured goods from the East. But with Utah now connected to the rest of the United States outside products of superior quality suddenly cost little more than home manufactured items. Due to limited capital, most cooperative managers could not keep the variety of goods on hand that could be found in competitors’ stores. 45\n\nEconomic changes driven by new technology may also have played a part. Not only did more goods arrive from the East, but also factories throughout the United States were increasingly producing consumer goods by machine. Machine-made goods could be made much more cheaply than homemade. For example, after 1869, imported cloth was both more attractive and cheaper than homespun, even in a largely barter society like Utah. 46 Machinery also created the ready-to-wear clothing industry. The affordable and fashionable clothing now available in Utah cut into demand for the stores’ tailors and milliners. As Susa Young Gates lamented, “these two causes were productive of narrowing conditions for the women’s attempt at individual mercantile existence.” 47\n\nThe second category of difficulty is both more elusive and more tantalizing for the historian. This would include internal difficulties—business management problems and difficulties in obtaining the patronage of local women.\n\nBusiness problems plagued the stores from the beginning. As part of the drive to promote home manufacture, the Relief Society set its commission low. Reflecting on the Woman’s Commission Store, Eliza R. Snow remembered that they accomplished their goal: “[this policy] brought to hand a great variety of useful and fancy articles, which gave the store the appearance of an eastern bazaar.” 48 But such low commissions also made it difficult for the stores to turn a profit or provide dividends to investors. 49 Staffing the stores could also be a problem: even with numerous volunteers, Snow lamented the tremendous demands it made on her time. She expressed relief when church leadership released the Relief Society from responsibility for the store. 50 In all likelihood, Snow was not the only woman unhappy about the demanding work of running the cooperative stores. Relying on volunteers made it difficult to create a continuity of staff and management. Women frequently moved, resigned, or were called to other duties. When the president of the St. George women’s cooperative resigned the new president promptly demanded a salary as compensation for her time and effort. Her demand divided local women and created “a lack of unity among some of the women.” 51 Under this pressure the stockholders gave up and sold the store to Erastus Snow in 1880. 52\n\nBut perhaps the most perplexing problem is those constant exhortations in the Exponent for the patronage of the LDS women. Historian Maureen Ursenbach Beecher has argued that the cooperative movement actually had little effect on what women consumed. For support she points to the “never-changing preaching” of Mormon leaders. As each new item, “the fashion of Babylon,” was successfully imported and sold in Utah, the cry went out again over the pulpit. And each time, the women were seen as the culprits, their demands for eastern goods decried, their extravagance blamed for their husbands’ financial failures, and the community’s empty coffers. 53\n\nTo the women themselves, consumption of eastern-made goods may have provided a valuable link with the gentile culture they had left behind. As Beecher points out, studies of costume indicate that the dresses of Mormon women varied little in style of fabric either from those of the same period found elsewhere in the United States or in fashionable publications of the day. 54 Those women who did wear homemade goods did not always do so happily. As Susa Young Gates remembered: “It is true that homemade hats were a great trial to the feelings of young girls who were compelled to wear them by their conscientious and dutiful mothers. Indeed, it might be said that the mothers themselves bore their homemade crosses upon their heads with more or less of the martyr’s feelings.” 55\n\nThe new variety of well-priced goods brought by rail after 1896 turned Mormons, and particularly Mormon women, into savvy consumers who now wanted attractive, fashionable, and well-made goods. They gave their business to the stores that carried such products. The local cooperatives, with their severely limited capital and volunteer staffs, could not compete. 56\n\nPrivate enterprise gradually replaced the cooperative aspects of these businesses. In 1882 a private operator purchased the Cooperative Mercantile and Millinery Institution of Weber County. 57 The Woman’s Commission Store’s last advertisements appeared in 1879. It may have been absorbed into the establishment of John C. Cutler, who had moved his dry goods business into the Old Constitution Building that same year. 58 In an 1881 issue of the Woman’s Exponent he offered “home-made silk” for sale at “Cutler’s Commission Store.” 59 The commission stores may not have received enough patronage to remain economically viable. Or they may have sunk under some combination of debt and management troubles, as similar ward cooperatives did. Unfortunately, due to the lack of documentation available these questions must remain unanswered. The Relief Society did not completely give up on its dreams of self-sufficiency, however. Although the cooperative store idea would lie dormant for a decade, by 1891 it returned in a new form. Relief Society leadership became more determined than ever to make it a success.\n\n“Preliminary steps have been taken towards the establishment of a Woman’s Store in this City at an early day,” the Woman’s Exponent reported in its December 1, 1890, issue. 60 Mrs. Mary Isabella Horne, who presided over the Salt Lake Stake Relief Society, served as chairman of this meeting, where she “plainly stated” the advantages of a woman’s store. Shares in the new venture cost five dollars each, and many of the women present purchased them. This seems to have been the extent of capital raised. Interestingly, this announcement makes no mention of the Woman’s Commission Store or the other Relief Society stores that had been scattered across Utah in the 1870s. The rhetoric surrounding the venture had changed as well. The Relief Society no longer spoke of the need for an independent Zion or any larger mission, but of the need to invest Relief Society funds in a well-managed business. 61\n\nThe store ambitiously promised to soon have dressmaking, millinery, and hairdressing departments that would not only serve the public but train young girls in “these active industrial employments.” 62 True to its word, on Monday, December 15, 1890, the Woman’s Cooperative Mercantile and Manufacturing Institution opened for business at 123 East, First South Street in Salt Lake City, just opposite City Hall. 63 Once again the Exponent’s calls for Mormon women to patronize the new store argued in favor of home industry. But now it also argued such patronage would help forward the cause of equal rights in which Mormon women had become actively involved. 64\n\nHow the cooperative store might affect equal rights is unclear, but what is clear is that the Relief Society leadership once again put its considerable weight into backing the store. Perhaps its greatest asset in this endeavor was Mrs. Mary Isabella Horne herself. She had, after all, had direct experience with the original Woman’s Commission Store. Horne clearly also had a talent for organization and leadership. In addition to her work with the Salt Lake Relief Society, Horne served as President of the Senior Cooperative Retrenchment Association, as treasurer for the Central Board of the Relief Society, and as a member of the Deseret Hospital committee. 65 Mormon women liked and respected her. As one woman who knew her fondly remembered, “I used to mentally compare [her face] to that of Washington, and I think still I was not mistaken.” 66 In addition to her other duties Mrs. Horne served as president of the cooperative’s parent organization, the Woman’s Cooperative Mercantile and Manufacturing Association. 67\n\nWhy, if technological change or competition had driven them out of business once before, did the Relief Society choose this particular moment to revive the cooperative store? The heyday of cooperatives had come and gone, and by the 1890s the church hierarchy itself had abandoned cooperatives in favor of integrating Utah into the larger national pattern of business and trade. 68 The Woodruff Manifesto of 1890, which had abolished plural marriage, had eliminated one of the major divisions between Mormons and non-Mormons. 69 The Relief Society had changed as well. As founding leaders died younger women worked to establish a new impersonal, business-like order. 70 Women of Horne’s generation may not have been entirely happy with all of these challenges to the old order. Horne’s own involvement with retrenchment suggests she, at least, remained committed to economic self-sufficiency. In many ways the second cooperative movement may have been the last articulation of earlier Mormon values of self-sufficiency and independence from non-Mormon society.\n\nAs had previous Relief Society cooperatives, the Woman’s Cooperative Mercantile and Manufacturing Institution focused on selling goods that would be of interest to other women. In addition to making dresses, it also sold dress goods, trimmings, and burial suits. An 1891 advertisement promised that the store “keeps on hand…fancy articles and notions, books and stationery, equipoise waists, etc…bonnets cleaned and retrimmed while you wait, feathers curled, etc. Buttons covered while you wait. Burial suits a Specialty.” 71 At Christmas time they added an assortment of holiday goods, dolls, and toys. 72\n\nBut even as it stocked its shelves the cooperative stood on shaky ground. At the annual shareholders meeting, Mrs. Mary Isabella Horne spoke about the disadvantages under which the institution labored, among which she included the lack of interest shown by some of the stockholders themselves. She also spoke about the opposition against the cooperative movement she encountered. 73 Unfortunately she does not describe the source of this opposition, but if the pattern followed that of the 1870s she may have been referring to resistance from some of the local women. However, she promised that the store would soon be able to pay dividends. Mrs. E. H. Woodmansee reported that she had heard a great many complaints but “nevertheless we are doing well, and must not expect too much at first.” 74 Mrs. C. C. R. Wells urged the stockholders to patronize their own store. 75 Clearly old patterns had begun to repeat themselves.\n\nSigns of this can be seen in the continued exhortations of the Exponent: “The Woman’s Cooperative Store fills an important place,” it argued, “it is an undertaking that should meet with the hearty support of women who are looking to home interests, and home industries that will give suitable employment to those who possess ingenuity and skill of various kinds.” 76 A year later came a reminder that women should “go to the Woman’s Store and see what there is to buy there before purchasing elsewhere.” 77\n\nAt the 1892 stockholders meeting, Vice President M.Y. Dougal again urged the members to patronize the store and made a plea for more capital to make the store a success. Mrs. E. H. Woodmansee argued that the store provided a place to apprentice daughters “under a good influence, and…if we will be patient some one, in the not distant future, will have the pleasure of declaring a dividend.” 78 By the 1893 meeting, President Horne openly blamed the store’s continued financial woes on the non-patronage of the stockholders and the community in general. 79\n\nHowever hobbled the Woman’s Cooperative Mercantile and Manufacturing Association may have been, other branches of the Relief Society also again experimented with cooperatives. The Salt Lake Stake Relief Society’s financial report for 1893-94 reported cooperative stores in six other communities, with a combined total of $10,585 worth of cash and stock on hand. 80\n\nThe Salt Lake City store, however, remained the cornerstone of the revival. And it still struggled under heavy debt, mainly owed to businessmen from the East. 81 In 1896 the board of directors placed it under the management of Mrs. Francis and her daughter, Mrs. Kelly. Both women had had extensive dressmaking experience in England, where Mrs. Kelly had worked for a Court milliner and dressmaker. 82 Mrs. Francis addressed the Relief Society meeting hoping to raise $500 by selling more shares. 83 Francis and Kelly proved innovative managers: as hungry visitors flooded into Salt Lake City for Pioneer Day festivities in 1896 the managers moved the store’s merchandise and temporarily turned the retail space into a restaurant. This successful venture enabled the store to pay off its creditors. 84\n\nThe other cooperative stores soon vanish from Relief Society records, but the main store managed to last into the twentieth century. In 1902 Miss Mary Morgan took over management of the store from Mrs. Francis; under her direction the store began to specialize in burial clothes. 85 The Relief Society increasingly focused on mother education courses and social work, similar to Progressive women’s work found elsewhere in the United States. 86 The store survived by specializing in millinery work, and city directories of the period list it simply as the “Women’s Cooperative Millinery.” 87 In 1911 a brief flurry of activity surrounded the store as Relief Society leaders once again encouraged women to patronize the store as liberally as they could. The Relief Society leadership proposed establishing an employment bureau adding dressmaking (which seems to have lapsed in the interim), hair dressing, and manicuring departments in the store. 88 None of these proposals, however, seem to have come to pass, and in 1912 the Relief Society established a separate department that sold temple and burial clothes. 89 Records indicate the store had asked to be relieved of this responsibility, most likely to focus on millinery work. 90 Between 1909 and 1915 the Women’s Cooperative Millinery changed locations five times. Official records remain silent on how and why the Relief Society allowed the cooperative to continue to struggle. Nineteen fifteen is the last year the cooperative appears in any city directory; after that it disappears entirely from public record. Relief Society records make no mention of the decision to close the store. The second great experiment with Mormon women’s cooperatives appears to have died the same ignominious death as its predecessor. In 1919 the Relief Society organized its Social Welfare Department, an endeavor that would lead the twentieth century Relief Society in an entirely new direction. 91\n\nThe history of women’s cooperatives in Utah holds many seeming contradictions. The Woman’s Commission Store of the 1870s found enough support from Mormon women to market home-produced goods, yet in spite of powerful ideology it lasted less than a decade. The Woman’s Cooperative Mercantile and Manufacturing Association of the 1890s suffered from a lack of support and capital from the beginning, but this cooperative lasted nearly twenty-five years. Lists of products available in the stores suggest that Mormon women, like their non-Mormon western counterparts, certainly took advantage of the opportunity to market their home-produced goods.\n\nMany Mormon women also purchased stock in the cooperatives. Unfortunately, diaries and journals of the period make no mention of the cooperatives, making it difficult to judge what individual women thought of the cooperatives. External explanations for the failure of the cooperatives do little to account for the reintroduction of the movement in the 1890s or for its lingering presence. Statements by Relief Society leaders clearly indicate that the larger society did not patronize the stores as much as they could have. Why, then, did women take on the monumental task of operating these cooperatives not once, but twice?\n\nClearly the answer lies in the appeal of self-sufficiency and the tempering effects of economic reality. Women initially greeted pleas for self-sufficiency enthusiastically, but no amount of encouragement from church leaders overcame their desire for eastern-made goods. Movements like retrenchment and cooperatives seem to have only made Mormon women cling all the stronger to the American society they had left behind. 92 A dress made of imported calico, a pot of honey from an eastern state: these small items clearly held meanings for women no amount of preaching could overcome.\n\nHowever, as unsuccessful as these cooperatives may ultimately have been, the Relief Society took from them valuable lessons about organization, administration, and, yes, even home manufacture. In the 1930s, when the Relief Society again searched for some way women could supplement their family income during the Great Depression, it revived the old standard of home industry. In this case, the solution became the Mormon Handicraft Shop, which has survived intact to the present day. 93 Interestingly, Mormon Handicraft provides a valuable market for handmade goods by marketing primarily not to other Mormon women, but to tourists who seek quaint items of a bygone era to take home. But perhaps, in a roundabout way, Brigham Young’s dreams of promoting home industry have come true after all.\n\nNOTES\n\nEileen V.
