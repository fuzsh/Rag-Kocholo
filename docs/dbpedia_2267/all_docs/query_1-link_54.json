        "text": "Lucille Marie (Menning) Noteboom, 99, went to her heavenly home Thursday, February 1, while under hospice care, at her home in Corsica. Funeral service will be Monday, February 5 at 11:00 am at Christian Reformed Church in Corsica with burial to follow at Graceland Cemetery in Corsica. Visitation will be Sunday, February 4 from 3:30 to 5:00 pm, with a prayer service at 4:30 pm, at Christian Reformed Church in Corsica.\n\nLucille was born November 29, 1924 to Simon K. and Minnie (DeVries) Menning at their family farm in Corsica, SD. She attended school through the 8th grade and then took piano lessons instead of going to high school because her parents didn’t feel it necessary. Lucille also worked at Kiel’s Market. Lucille was united in marriage to Peter Junior Noteboom on August 8, 1947 at Grace Reformed Church. She totally enjoyed playing organ and piano, and played for church services for over 72 years. Music was one of her passions.\n\nPeter and Lucille were blessed to do a lot traveling through the states and many foreign countries. They also enjoyed traveling south for the winter for many years. At the age of 60 she obtained her GED. She was a member of Dorcas Women’s Society, Priscilla Club, and attended Coffee Break Bible study. Lucille loved the Lord and felt God should be first above all things. Her main desire was for her family and friends to know the Lord as their personal Savior.\n\nGrateful for having shared her life are her children: Gwendolyn Meeter, Sharon (Ivan) Van Marel, Daniel (Jeanne) Noteboom, Laura (Troy) Noteboom, and a daughter-in-law Donna Noteboom.
