        "text": "1kac522\n\nEditado: mayo 2, 9:26 pm\n\nSee my January 2024 update in >2 kac522:.\n\nAt the end of each year I do a tally of the books I've read by Publication Year. This thread will be a perfect place for me to keep track as I go along! I started keeping detailed track of books by year in 2019.\n\nI keep a chronological list of all my 2024 reading here, with short reviews: 75ers: https://www.librarything.com/topic/356771\n\nI keep track of my 2024 Challenges reading here: Category Challenge: https://www.librarything.com/topic/355880#\n\n2kac522\n\nEditado: mayo 2, 9:26 pm\n\nJanuary 2024 Update:\n\nI started keeping track by year in 2019, when the Read It, Track It group had a challenge to read one book from every year from 1920 to 2019. I didn't quite make it, but it was such an interesting I decided to continue keeping track as I read. So right now I've recorded the books that I've read in 2019 through 2023, and they are organized by Publication Year.\n\nI'm going to start a project (it will be very slow), to start recording by year my books read from 2018, then 2017, then 2016, etc. I have recorded my books read since about 1985. I don't know if I'll get back that far, but it would be nice to get back as least as 2009, when I first joined LT.\n\nSo for anyone that cares, in the coming weeks you'll see books from 2018 added to these lists. They may or may not have the months, but they for sure will have the year.\n\nAt some point, I'd like to identify my \"favorite\" book from each year Published. We'll see.\n\n3kac522\n\nEditado: Abr 26, 5:34 pm\n\n18th Century & before-- ??? - 1799\n\nca. 432 B.C.E.; \"Oedipus the King\" from The Three Theban Plays, Sophocles (Apr 24)\n\n2nd Century C.E.

The Way We Live Now, Anthony Trollope (1875); fiction\n\nWith a few minor exceptions, I generally love Trollope or at least find things to enjoy in his novels. Although this is supposedly Trollope's \"magnum opus\" at 800+ pages, I can't say that I enjoyed it very much. The book starts out following Lady Carbury, a mediocre novelist with little money who is attempting to get good reviews (and hence good sales) for her books and to get her son and daughter into advantageous marriages. The novel slowly shifts focus to the great financier Augustus Melmotte, whose background and source of great wealth are a mystery. (From what I've read, Melmotte's portrait was a conglomeration of real-life men of wealth during the Victorian era.) The more that is revealed about Melmotte, the more unlikable he becomes. Trollope can often portray unlikable characters but still get me to have pity or sympathy with them (Louis Trevelyan in He Knew He Was Right, for example), but not here. I felt I knew Melmotte too well and the more I knew him, the less I pitied him.\n\nTrollope's intent, I think, was to portray a society that has become so corrupt that it has lost all sense of honesty and integrity. Laudable aims, but overall I can't say that I enjoyed this book very much. Trollope's portrayal of Melmotte is compelling, but once his downfall is complete, the other minor characters and their resolutions seem insignificant by comparison and not all that interesting to follow. There really wasn't a character that I liked or even appreciated, except possibly Roger Carbury (Lady Carbury's distant relation) and to a lesser extent minor characters Mr Breghert, the Jewish banker, and Mr Broune, Lady Carbury's friend.\n\nThis was a disappointment for me. At some distant time I may re-read it, and perhaps knowing the outcome I will better appreciate what Trollope was trying to do.\n\n35. John Adams, David McCullough (2002); biography; audiobook read (mostly) by Edward Herrmann\n\nI felt like I really knew the personality and character of John Adams when I finished this book. McCullough used quite a bit of Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail and others to bring him to life. Adams felt most proud of his work for independence during the early revolutionary years and his part in constructing the Massachusetts constitution, which later became a model for the U.S. Constitution. I love McCullough's narrative style and it made the book move quickly despite its 600+ pages.\n\nI listened to this abridged audio edition and supplemented by reading the print copy for some material that was skipped, which was mostly his VP and Presidential years, and background information on Thomas Jefferson (McCullough had originally intended this book to explore the relationship between Adams and Jefferson). I was annoyed, however, when the audiobook narration sometimes switched to a woman who sounded like an automated voicemail machine. Fortunately, most of the recording was done by Herrmann.\n\n36. Mad Monkton and Other Stories, Wilkie Collins; short stories from throughout Collins' career\n\nThis year is the 200th anniversary of the birth of Wilkie Collins. I plan to read several of his works throughout the year, and this collection was the perfect way to begin. This was a fantastic collection of 12 ghost, mystery and detective stories throughout Collins' career. All of the stories (except 1, and that one was the least engaging) were written in first person, and often there is a narrative within the narrative. I think my favorites were \"The Diary of Anne Rodway\" (the first female \"detective\", told in diary format), \"A Terribly Strange Bed\" (his first published mystery story) and \"The Biter Bit\" (featuring an over-confident new detective told in letter format). His narrative style works perfectly in the short story format. Short stories can be hit or miss for me, but most of these were definite hits! I'm so glad my library had this older Oxford edition, as I doubt if it's still in print.\n\n37. Quartet in Autumn, Barbara Pym (1977); fiction; a re-read\n\nI first read this in 1987, loved it and have since re-read a couple of times. This re-read did not disappoint. The story, contemporary to the 1970s, is about four elderly single people--Letty, Marcia, Edwin and Norman--who all work in the same London office and are approaching retirement. Their contact with one another is almost entirely at the office. They maintain a courteous distance and each one is a bit odd in their own way. When Letty & Marcia decide to retire, the shift in relationships and what the future looks like for each of the \"quartet\" is the focus of the novel.\n\nAs I've now been retired 15 years, Pym's gently funny and quiet, but wry, observations of older people alone and how they are perceived by others are spot-on. Each has their irritating quirks, but Pym gives them sympathetic and universal appeal, too, as they struggle to do the right thing and maybe find that life still has possibilities ahead. A gem.\n\n38. \"Oedipus the King\" from The Three Theban Plays, Sophocles (5th c. B.C.E.); translated by Robert Fagles; play; a re-read\n\nThis was a re-read for me for my RL Book Club. I appreciated the Fagles translation which was very readable and understandable, and gave the play life.\n\n39. Young Anne, Dorothy Whipple (1927); fiction\n\nThis was my first book by Dorothy Whipple, who has been on my radar for quite some time. Persephone Books have re-printed all of her novels and it seems nearly every review I've read of her books has been glowing. Fortunately for me, this book lived up to all the hype!\n\nI absolutely inhaled this novel in 2 sittings. Set in a medium-sized town in northern England in the late 1890s, we follow Anne from age 5 into the first few years of her married life. We see her within her family with a critical father, a distant mother and a loving, motherly servant; we follow her in school as the only Protestant in a convent school; we see her first love and first break-up; we witness her first job, first boss and first paycheck; thrill to her first car and then first car accident; and finally her complex marriage.\n\nI loved Whipple's writing; I just couldn't stop reading. She is sometimes tongue-in-cheek and sometimes quite serious. Often it's what is left unsaid that is almost as important as what is revealed. Much of the novel reflects Whipple's own experiences in her early years. I think the ending was a bit awkward and melodramatic, but on the whole, as a debut novel, this was wonderful, and I've got her next novel, High Wages, all lined up for May reading.\n\n40. The Dead Secret, Wilkie Collins (1857); fiction\n\nThis is one of Collins' early novels with true \"sensational\" elements. A wealthy woman is dying; on her deathbed she writes a mysterious letter witnessed by a servant and it is the intention of the mistress that this letter should be given to her husband upon her death. She dies, leaving her husband and a 5 year old daughter. The servant, however, hides the letter in a remote room of the large manor house and vanishes the next day. Fifteen years later, the surviving daughter Rosamond, now married, is made aware of this mystery while in childbirth with her first child, and, along with her blind husband, is determined to uncover the Secret.\n\nThis was quite a page-turner, and has a lot of interesting elements, including ghosts and visions, an old decrepit house and a spiteful reclusive relative. It's clear that Collins intends the reader to have a good idea of what the \"Secret\" is from the beginning, and that the purpose of the story is to follow young Rosamond (headstrong and quick to react) and her loving husband (blind, reserved and thoughtful) as they slowly pursue the Secret. I really enjoyed how they worked as a team uncovering each \"clue\" and revelation and what to follow-up next. Another strength, which is found in many of his novels, is how well Collins draws female characters; both Sarah Leeson (the servant) and Rosamond (the daughter) are amazing rounded characters. Collins keeps the spooky atmosphere throughout the novel, but there are also some funny bits, too, to break up the intensity.\n\nWhat's frustrating is that this was written for serial publication, so Collins prolonged just about every scene imaginable with as much melodramatic sensibilities and for as many words as possible. I enjoyed it, but it could have been half the length and still have been a great novel.\n\nMy last read for the month deserves its own post, so.....\n\n19kac522\n\nEditado: mayo 2, 9:03 pm\n\n41. How the Other Half Lives, Jacob Riis (1890); nonfiction text with photographs\n\nThis classic of late 19th century journalism was a difficult book to read; it took me nearly the entire month to finish, even though it is only 218 pages. I could only read a chapter or two at a time because the material overwhelmed me.\n\nJacob Riis (1849-1914) was a Danish immigrant who arrived in New York in 1870. Like many of the subjects in his book, his first years in New York were spent on the street or in miserable lodging houses. After a series of jobs, he finally became steadily employed in 1877 as a journalist on the New York Tribune and later at the Evening Sun. His beat was in the Lower East side slum district, and so began his concerted effort to raise awareness of the living conditions of the neighborhood.\n\nRiis wrote many short articles about the conditions, but they seemed to have little or no effect. It was the invention of flash photography that changed everything. He employed photographers and later learned the skill himself, and went into neighborhoods, tenements and alleys to document the living conditions. When his book came out in 1890, it had an immediate impact, due largely to the photographs.\n\nThe text is dense. Riis includes loads of statistics, intense narrative and personal stories along with the photographs to document conditions. Riis felt that the first step to improving the slums was better housing, where every room had light and air and every living space had adequate plumbing, all things that were woefully inadequate in 1890s tenements. He goes block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, ethnicity by ethnicity, to describe the inhumane living conditions of the men, women and children, nearly all immigrants.\n\nRiis has definite views on various ethnic groups and seems to rely on some stereotypes. But he went everywhere, no matter how horrible the living situation. As was the practice at the time, he did not ask permission to take his photographs; he just set up and shot. The photographs were taken by him and by other photographers working with him.\n\nThere is much written about his work, so I will refrain from adding any more. If you are interested here are three websites with photographs and more information:\n\nThis has a selection of some of the photographs:\n\nhttps://www.americanyawp.com/text/how-the-other-half-lived-photographs-of-jacob-...\n\nAt this PBS website, there are 2 clips from a documentary about Riis:\n\nhttps://illinois.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/jacob-riis-video-gallery/new-york...\n\nThis short video is from the 2016 Library of Congress exhibition about Jacob Riis. I learned quite a bit of background info:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqpQzyK96uk\n\n20kac522\n\nEditado: Ago 30, 2023, 2:12 am\n\nEste mensaje fue borrado por su autor.\n\n21kac522\n\nEditado: Ago 30, 2023, 2:12 am\n\nEste mensaje fue borrado por su autor.\n\n22kac522\n\nEditado: Ago 30, 2023, 2:13 am\n\nEste mensaje fue borrado por su autor.\n\n23kac522\n\nEditado: Ago 30, 2023, 2:13 am\n\nEste mensaje fue borrado por su autor.\n\n24kac522\n\nEditado: Abr 4, 9:00 pm\n\nEste mensaje fue borrado por su autor.\n\n25kac522\n\nEditado: Abr 4, 9:00 pm\n\nEste mensaje fue borrado por su autor.\n\n26kac522\n\nEditado: Ago 30, 2023, 6:30 pm\n\nJanuary to June 2019:\n\n1.

Also agree on the awesome description of the sound of the mob and on mob violence itself.\n\n66kac522\n\nEditado: Jul 17, 2023, 12:50 am\n\n>65 threadnsong: Thank you for stopping by and thanks for the kind words! I see you have a thread in the Category Challenge group, and I have one there, too, where you can see all my challenges & reviews back to January:\n\nhttps://www.librarything.com/topic/347256#\n\nI read a lot of classics and do a lot of re-reading. In fact, this time round was a re-read of Barnaby Rudge. What I didn't say in my review was that my prior reading was a few months after the Jan 6 attack and it was so scary to read how similar the real mob action I watched on TV was to the mob Dickens describes in that book.\n\nBut if you _really_ want to feel good about Barnaby Rudge, I highly recommend you watch this video by Katie Lumsden in June. She's a booktuber who is hosting a 2 year readalong of Dickens (which is why I was reading Barnaby at this time) and her enthusiasm for the book and for all things Dickens is infectious:\n\nKatie's review of Barnaby Rudge\n\nShe talks very fast, so you may need to slow down the audio, but she is so, so good. And she adores Dickens.\n\nI've read all of Dickens' novels at least once (and some multiple times) and a great book that is a fun read is John Mullan's The Artful Dickens: The Tricks and Ploys of the Great Novelist. He has such great insight into various aspects of Dickens--but it has a LOT of spoilers, so if you haven't read a lot of Dickens, I would recommend waiting until you've read most of his novels.\n\nI noticed from your thread that you are a pianist. One book I read earlier this year that is a stand-out for me is a little Japanese novel called The Forest of Wool and Steel by Natsu Miyashita, and translated by Philip Gabriel. Here's my review from January:\n\nThe Forest of Wool and Steel by Natsu Miyashita (2015) is a story of a young man in rural Japan who hears a piano being tuned at his high school and is mesmerized by the sounds. Without any musical training, he makes the very brave decision to study piano tuning as a career. This quiet little book has so much packed into it: about striving for perfection, about perseverance, about mentors, about being completely dedicated to your craft. It's also about the importance of sound and tuning and creating the right timbre (tone quality) for a specific pianist on a specific piano. There are some very piano-technical passages (the \"Wool and Steel\" of the title refers to the piano hammers and strings), so I'm not sure how interesting the story might be to non-musicians; but as a music major in a distant life, I loved it.\n\nThe author has studied classical piano and the book was made into a movie in Japan. The book was not readily available at my library, so I did have to order it via inter-library loan.\n\nIf you can find the book via inter-library loan, I think you would really enjoy it. I haven't played piano in some years, mostly because of arthritis in my fingers and trouble with my back. I was in choirs most of my life until the pandemic hit and the two choirs I was in were switched to zoom only, which just didn't interest me. They are now both in-person, but I haven't gone back because I think my voice has changed in the past few years--some chronic health issues seem to have made me a tenor instead of an alto! And I have trouble matching my voice to the pitch I can hear in my ear--it's very weird. I might try going back to one this Fall--at least I can see if just using my voice more and doing vocal exercises might help the problem.\n\nAnyway, I have starred your thread, and look forward to following what you're reading and playing and practicing!\n\n67threadnsong\n\nEditado: Jul 23, 2023, 8:52 pm\n\nHow very fascinating you are! And thank you for the book recommendation - I'll add it to my Wishlist (which always seems to grow when I sit down with LT!). It is so true - a piano is a mixture of wire and wood. Piano tuners always fascinated me from when I was a little girl and watching the piano tuner come by, to when I was an adult and finding a piano tuner for the same piano. It is a gorgeous instrument, whatever shape it takes.\n\nAnd also thank you for the link to the Barnaby Rudge video. I promise promise that I will watch it soon!\n\nAs far as my Dickens reading goes, I joined a F2F Dickens book club when they were part way through The Olde Curiosity Shop and we read through the entire canon from there. I must say, there were times where I wanted to throw the book across the room with the depiction of Little Nell! But, I recently saw the Derek Jacobi BBC production and liked it a lot better. It made the men out to be so much worse and Little Nell as so much better, and so much more human. Dealing with all the demands on her instead of submitting to X with an open and joyful heart.\n\nMy hat is off to you for reading and re-reading his entire canon. There is so much about descriptions and people and their motivations that I find so insightful in Dickens. I'm really glad I read him, and I can certainly understand the cultural references now!\n\nAnd yes, you are right about the parallels between the mob in \"Barnaby Rudge\" and the Jan. 6 mob. I've heard some of the audio on longer clips, even audio-only, and it's eerily similar.\n\nThank you for the link to the other group - I have starred your thread and can start enjoying your reviews! I post my reviews both places (as you've probably already figured out).\n\nI do hope you return to your choirs, even just one of them. I find that getting together is a good thing to do, and making music together can sometimes be Just the Thing.\n\n68kac522\n\nJul 23, 2023, 9:39 pm\n\n>67 threadnsong: I hope you get a chance to read The Forest of Wool and Steel. It's not long at all, but so, so interesting.\n\nWell done on your Dickens reading and a RL book group! I need to find that Jacobi adaptation--I need all the help I can get with Little Nell. I'm (re)-listening to Martin Chuzzlewit and it's starting to pick up, but the first 8 or 9 chapters require loads of patience.\n\nTime for me to get back to my Jane Austen July reading.......\n\n69threadnsong\n\nJul 30, 2023, 8:31 pm\n\n>68 kac522: Enjoy your Jane Austen July reading!\n\nI also watched the video about Barnaby Rudge and wow! She has such an understanding of this book and the portion about mobs and what motivates people to join them and commit acts of destruction.\n\n70kac522\n\nJul 30, 2023, 9:13 pm\n\n>69 threadnsong: Katie has such a phenomenal understanding of Victorian literature, particularly Dickens. She should be teaching, to get young people interested in the books of the era.\n\n71threadnsong\n\nJul 30, 2023, 9:22 pm\n\nOh, and in reading your thread I noticed that you more prefer Jane Eyre to Wuthering Heights. I am more drawn to the latter, in part because of the passion and love between the two main characters, and OMG the film with Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier made me cry for many years (even though it left out the second half of the story!).\n\nBut.\n\nThere is a fascinating essay by Andrea Dworkin who discusses how \"Wuthering Heights\" is the epitome of tracing inter-generational abusive/dysfuntional family dynamics. It's in her book Letters from a War Zone and I was really blown away by her evaluation of it. And it gave me a different understanding of it, and why there are parts that are quite troubling.\n\n72kac522\n\nEditado: Jul 30, 2023, 10:56 pm\n\n>71 threadnsong: I've read WH several times throughout my life, hoping I could enjoy it. But mostly I just feel it's about people being relentlesly cruel to one another. As Katie has said in her videos, it's not a book about love, it's a book about revenge (but it's still one of her favorite books of all time). This last time I read it (last January) I appreciated how Emily structured the book, framed the action and kept up the intensity, but I have no desire to read it again.\n\nI still vastly enjoy Jane Eyre (which has its own set of problematic issues), where at least we are presented with some good-hearted people in her journey: Helen Burns, Miss Temple and the Rivers sisters are the most prominent. And where Jane finally takes control of her own life. So a much more hopeful book. I find nothing to restore my faith in people in WH.\n\nYears ago one of the older (than me) ladies in my book club asked me \"Are you a Jane Eyre person or a Wuthering Heights person?\" I'd never thought about how people could be divided that way, but of course, without blinking an eye, I answered Jane Eyre. So I guess it's not that strange to prefer one to the other.\n\n73kac522\n\nEditado: Ago 3, 2023, 9:11 pm\n\nJuly reading was pretty miserable: only 6 books finished and 3 of them were re-reads. I just can’t seem to stick with a new-to-me book these days, especially if it’s more than 100 pages.\n\n80. Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen (1813); umpteenth re-read\n\nType: fiction for Jane Austen July\n\nOne of my favorite books of all time, which I have been re-reading since age 12. On this reading I noticed how Austen uses dialogue to flesh out her characters and to move the plot along. The only exception to this is the minor character of Georgiana Darcy, who never speaks a single line in the book. Georgiana is talked about by so many other characters, however, that we have a wonderful sense of Georgiana without ever hearing her speak. A comfort read that never fails me.\n\n81. Before the Coffee Gets Cold, Toshikazu Kawaguchi; translated by Geoffrey Trousselot (2015)\n\nType: fiction\n\nThe premise of this book is intriguing: in a basement café, there is small table where a person can travel into the past or the future to re-live a conversation. The catch: you must finish your conversation before your coffee gets cold or you may disappear forever. The book is divided into 4 parts, each about a different café patron who sits at that special table. It started out well, but by the last part I had lost interest with the idea and with the writing. I am probably in the minority on this one, as it is a very popular book; I waited 3 months on my library’s wait list for my copy. But it fell flat for me by the end.\n\n82. The Claverings, Anthony Trollope (1867); re-read from 2021\n\nType: fiction for LT Group Read\n\nYoung Harry Clavering must decide between two women: Julia, who jilted him years ago, but is now a wealthy widow; and Florence, his current fiancée, who is good and average and niece of his boss. Trollope really knows how to show a guy who can’t make up his mind, and I was pretty impatient with Harry this time round. It’s always interesting to see how Trollope re-works a plot line and puts his own special twists to each book and makes you think from another point of view. I enjoyed this, despite the frustration and the too-easy ending.\n\n83. The Castle of Otranto, Horace Walpole (1764)\n\nType: historical fiction for Jane Austen July\n\nI read this to get into the mood for a re-read of Northanger Abbey. Considered the first true gothic novel, it has all the tropes you expect and even more. It was entertaining, but I have to admit I've forgotten most of it, except the chase through the underground tunnels and the death of the heroine at the end.\n\n84. Northanger Abbey, Jane Austen (1818); umpteenth re-read\n\nType: fiction for Jane Austen July\n\nAfter reading The Castle of Otranto this novel of young Catherine Morland and her gothic imagination left me laughing out loud many times despite the many times I've read it before. Austen knows how to balance the ridiculous gothic tropes with the importance of reading. And I really do like our hero Henry Tilney a lot; I think he is my favorite Austen hero.\n\n85. Tove Jansson, Paul Gravett (2022)\n\nType: nonfiction; biography\n\nShort, but detailed life of illustrator (and painter, novelist, cartoonist and more) Tove Jansson. This biography focuses on her career as an illustrator and creator of the Moomins. It's filled with illustrations--probably an equal amount of text and pictures. I only know Jansson from her novel The Summer Book, which I loved, so this was a wonderful introduction to her life and art work.may have been written as essays or separate individual pieces. Still, this is an American identity story that needs to be heard.\n\n74kac522\n\nAgo 3, 2023, 9:24 pm\n\nAugust maybes\n\nI have decided to make as few commitments as possible for August and just pick from a very big pile.\n\nMy one commitment is:\n\nThe Secret Garden, Frances Hodgson Burnett--for my RL book club. As well as the original, I've got an annotated edition and an interesting biography about Burnett and her gardens: Unearthing the Secret Garden by Marta McDowell.\n\nNext up would be books I didn't finish is July:\n\nMartin Chuzzlewit, Charles Dickens--still working slowly on the audiobook; almost 1/3 through\n\nJane Austen at Home, Lucy Worsley--my nonfiction selection for JA July which I'm enjoying but not feeling in the mood to pick up. Maybe in August.\n\nChristopher and Columbus, Elizabeth von Arnim; hope to finish this tonight.\n\nAfter that there are some library books to clear out, including:\n\nThe Secrets of Hartwood Hall, Katie Lumsden\n\nYoung Mrs Savage, D. E. Stevenson\n\nThe Private Life of Spies, Alexander McCall Smith, a new book of short stories\n\nAnd then I hope to read a few books published by Virago for All Virago/All August: https://www.librarything.com/topic/352498\n\nI'll choose a couple from:\n\nJamaica Inn, Daphne DuMaurier\n\nGood Behaviour, Molly Keane\n\nMandoa, Mandoa, Winifred Holtby\n\nCelia, E. H. Young\n\nAngel, Elizabeth Taylor\n\nand I might throw in an Agatha Christie if nothing else appeals.\n\n75kac522\n\nSep 8, 2023, 10:45 pm\n\nI'm really behind, so these are going to be quick reviews of my August reading:\n\n86. Christopher and Columbus, Elizabeth von Arnim (1919); ebook\n\nOne could call this a delightful book, but somehow I found it disappointing. It is 1916. A set of orphaned twins, Anna-R and Anna-F, are banished to America by their English aunt and uncle. Their crime? Their late mother was English who married their late father, a German. On their voyage across the Atlantic they meet Mr Twist, a wealthy American, who finds them delightful and befriends them, and everything goes on from there.\n\nVon Arnim's tone throughout the book is almost like a fairy-tale or fable. It is half in earnest and half in jest. Underneath the surface the story is disturbing, because along the way the twins (who consider themselves German by accident only) are repeatedly shunned. Yet the Germans the twins meet in America are portrayed as boorish and unpleasant. But what bothered me most was that the ending completely veers away from the real issues and ends in Cinderella fashion.\n\n87. The Dressmaker, Beryl Bainbridge(1973); Root from 2021\n\nSet in Liverpool during WWII, the story centers around Rita, a sheltered 17-year-old, who meets Ira, an American soldier, at a party. Rita has been raised by her two middle-aged aunts, Nellie (a dressmaker) and Marge, who all live together in their family home. Their brother Jack (and Rita's father) lives above his shop not far away. This dark story is really about the family dynamics, and how Rita's teen-age crush up-ends the family.\n\nBainbridge's detailed descriptions of the characters, their clothing, their furnishings and the general shabbiness of their lives drew me in, but at the same time made me feel constantly ill-at-ease, like I was seeing things I shouldn't. I can't say I liked any of the family, but I didn't outright dislike them either--they were trapped. This was a quick read with a shocking ending, but I'm not sure I'll be seeking out Bainbridge again; probably too dark for my taste.\n\n88. Love and Youth: Essential Stories, Ivan Turgenev, translated by Nicolas Pasternak Slater and Maya Slater; (1852 & 1860 \"First Love\"); Root from 2022\n\nLike most short story collections, some were better than others. The best was the first (and longest), \"First Love\", which is about the adoring love of young teenage boy for a slightly older woman Zinaida. Turgenev completely captures that young devoted first love feeling. Of the rest of the stories, \"The District Doctor\" was my second favorite, about a doctor who falls in love with his dying patient. I thought these 2 stories were excellent and the other 4 stories just OK. Loved this Pushkin Press edition, though.\n\n89. From These Shores, Helga Skogsbergh (1975); Root from 2022\n\nThis is a one-volume abridgement of Helga Skogsbergh's three autobiographical novels about her family's homestead on the southern shores of Lake Superior in Wisconsin. Originally published as Comes the Day, Comes a Way (1960); From These Shores (1963); and That Was Then (1969), this 1975 edition is an abridgement which has selected chapters from each of the 3 volumes. The story focuses on two young couples, the Hansons and the Samuelsons, who have immigrated in the 1880s from Sweden to Duluth. In 1891 the two men are enticed by a call for families to homestead on the southern shores of Lake Superior in northern Wisconsin, near Ashland (their settlement would later be known as Port Wing). They pack up their families and travel by steamer across the lake with all their belongings, some furniture and a cow.\n\nWhat was most interesting is that the books are more from the women's points of view, as Skogsbergh is relating the stories her mother (here called Mama Hanson) told about this pilgrimage. It deals with their hard work, loneliness (their husbands are away weeks at a time at a logging camp), privations and learning to help one another during high points and low points, childbirth and infant burials. There is an over-riding steadfastness and faith which keeps these immigrants surviving and thriving. Told as a novel, but knowing that the basic storylines were true, I found this an effective and moving way to tell an immigrant family's story.\n\n90. Good Daughters, Mary Hocking (1984); Root from 2020, read for the All Virago/All August challenge\n\nThis is a quiet story, the first in a trilogy, of a family with 3 daughters (ages 16, 12, 9), set from 1933 through 1937. It's mostly told from the point of view of Alice, the 12-year-old, and is about their day-to-day lives with friends, neighbors, relatives and a unnerving undercurrent of the tidings of war. I loved this book, and look forward to the second book.\n\n91. My Life in Middlemarch, Rebecca Mead (2014); Root from 2015\n\nI've been staring at this book for 8 years now, and finally got around to it. Mead combines memoir, biography of George Eliot and analysis of Middlemarch in a perfectly seamless way. The eight chapters are structured around the eight \"Books\" of Middlemarch. I didn't feel like any one of the elements (memoir, biography, analysis) dominated. Mead is there, but she's not front and center. So glad I finally gotten around to reading this one.\n\nMy last 3 books of the month are all related to my RL book club's August read: the children's classic The Secret Garden:\n\n92. The Secret Garden Frances Hodgson Burnett (1911); Re-read from 2013. I read a straight-forward edition about the selfish British orphan girl, raised in India, who is banished to her uncle's gloomy house on the Yorkshire moors. There she encounters nature, new friends and a secret place. I hadn't remembered the references to \"Magic\" from my past readings, which stood out to me this time. I also noticed how Mary becomes stronger and less selfish, but how little (except physically) Colin changes in temperament.\n\n93. Unearthing the Secret Garden, Marta McDowell (2021) This is a wonderful mash-up of the life of Frances Hodgson Burnett, her love of gardens, and how that passion is shown in The Secret Garden. Burnett didn't become a gardener until she was 50, but she went into it with great zeal. The famous garden in The Secret Garden is based on a garden that she brought back to life in Kent. A lovely book with lots of pictures from both Burnett's life and illustrations from the children's classic.\n\n94. The Annotated Secret Garden, Frances Hodgson Burnett, with intro and annotations by Gretchen Holbrook Gerzina, (1911; this annotated edition 2007). I read this one last, and just read the intro and the annotations, having read the novel on its own a few weeks earlier. Gerzina points out all the references to the Brontes (Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights and the Yorkshire moors) that Burnett used in her story. She has some lengthy descriptions of Burnett's own \"philosophy\" of Magic: a combination of Christianity, nature, science, positive thinking, a bit a Freud here and there, all rolled into one. It's a big coffee-table type book, but well worth the read for all of the valuable insights into the novel and the era that it was written.\n\n76kac522\n\nEditado: Sep 21, 2023, 2:21 am\n\nSeptember possibilities...we know I'll never finish them all, but one can dream....\n\nCurrently reading:\n\nDONE!

Jamaica Inn, Daphne Du Maurier (1936); fiction\n\nHistorical fiction set in 1815 Cornwall that seemed repetitive, over-long and a romance I didn't believe in. Meh.\n\n96. Simply Artificial Intelligence, DK Publishing (2023); nonfiction\n\nBasic guide to that ubiquitous term \"AI\", which helped clarify some concepts for me. Good for middle grades to adults.\n\n❤️97. Tales from a Village School, Miss Read (1994); fiction\n\nFictional stories based on Miss Read's real experience as a teacher in English rural schools. Like most Miss Read books, the stories follow the calendar, starting with September and ending at summer vacation.\n\n98. Harry Heathcote of Gangoil, Anthony Trollope (1874); fiction\n\nEntertaining novella set in the Australian outback approaching Christmas, about a man defending his property against heat-induced fires and vengeful neighbors.\n\n99. The Whistling Season, Ivan Doig (2006); fiction\n\nHistorical fiction set in a Montana homestead school during the 1909-10 school year. Good story, but I found the writing unnecessarily ornate; to me it felt contrived.\n\n100. Martin Chuzzlewit, Charles Dickens (1844); re-read on audiobook; fiction\n\nFelt pretty much the same as on my first reading: the middle drags, but the beginning and especially the last third of the book is very good. Not a favorite Dickens, though.\n\n101. A Streetcar Named Desire, Tennessee Williams (1947); play\n\nUnlikable characters who do painful, stupid things. I couldn't find any redeeming value in it.\n\n102. Behind the Scenes: or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the White House, Elizabeth Keckley (1868); memoir\n\nThis was easy to read and eye-opening, especially Keckley's years with Mary Todd Lincoln. Not as memorable as Frederick Douglass's memoir, but interesting from the point of view of a woman and domestic life.\n\n103. Indifferent Heroes, Mary Hocking (1985)\n\nSecond book in Mary Hocking's Fairley family trilogy; I read the first book in August. This book begins in 1939 and ends in Fall 1945, and it felt more disjointed. I wanted more about daughter Alice, front and center.\n\n104. The Faithful Spy, John Hendrix (2018); nonfiction graphic book for middle grade and older\n\nThe story of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor involved in various plots to kill Hitler. Best known for his writings from prison and death in a concentration camp, just weeks before liberation. Appropriate for mature middle-graders up to adults; the disturbing facts are never glossed over or ignored.\n\n❤️105. Excellent Women, Barbara Pym (1952); re-read from 2013; fiction\n\nWonderful witty short novel about a woman who is satisfied and fulfilled in her single life.\n\n106. Good-Bye, Mr. Chips, James Hilton (1933); fiction\n\nBoys' school teacher looks back on his long career and many pupils; wistful but not overly melancholy. Covers his teaching days from the late Victorian era (1870s), through the Great War and into the 1930s.\n\n79kac522\n\nOct 6, 2023, 9:59 pm\n\nVictober Reading Update:\n\nI've finished a re-read of Agnes Grey by Anne Bronte, which I enjoyed a bit more than my first reading, I think. It didn't feel as hopeless as the first reading.\n\nCurrently reading and am about 1/3 through each of these:\n\nDombey and Son, Charles Dickens, on audiobook, slightly more engaging than I remember it.\n\nand\n\nRuth by Elizabeth Gaskell, which so far I'm really enjoying.\n\nI've picked up Elizabeth Gaskell: A Habit of Stories, a biography by Jenny Uglow. This is a hefty bio, so I doubt if I'll finish it this month.\n\nAlso I'll be reading some Gaskell \"ghost\" stories with the Liz's Virago group read.\n\nAnd up next will probably be a non-Victober selection: The Home-Maker by Dorothy Canfield Fisher, for the American Authors Challenge.\n\nAnd I'm watching lots of Victober video content, so I'm very happy.\n\n80kac522\n\nOct 18, 2023, 7:02 pm\n\nSo far my Victober continues to progress.
