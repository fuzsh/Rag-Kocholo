        "text": "Marvin Carter Williams was born June 10, 1964 in Sparta, North Carolina to Charlotte and Marvin Carter. After the death of his father, his mother moved to Columbus, Ohio where in 1969 she married Vincent S. Williams Sr. Along with Marvin’s sister, Clarissa, this union created a blended family of six children with the 7th being born in 1972. Marvin Williams’ life was cut short on May 18, 2023 after spending the afternoon doing yard work. Marvin was always working whether it be in his yard, on his job or in the church. We know that his heavenly reward will give him the peace he well deserves.\n\nIn his youth, Marvin was a member of the Oakley Baptist Church where he was baptized and served in the hospitality ministry, Carols of Joy Youth Choir, and various other activities. He graduated from Columbus West High School in 1982. Marvin was a member of the marching band where he played the tuba. He was also a member of the French Club. He traveled to France twice with the club. Those trips created his desire andlove for travel. After graduating from West High, he attended DeVry university. Marvin then went on to have numerous management jobs including the University Club, Sbarros Pizza, Frisch’s, Cracker Barrel, Panera Bread, McDonald’s and Wendy’s. He held some of these jobs when he lived in Columbus and some were once he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio. Marvin, along with Chris Harris created a catering business called Christian Caterers and Limousine Service in Cincinnati. He was currently working as a cook at AVI Food Services at L3 Harris Technologies.\n\nMarvin had such a nice personality. He was a great brother and loved by his six siblings. He was so much like his mother Charlotte. She always helped people and loved her church. When Marvin moved to Cincinnati, he joined the God News Church of God in Christ. He helped his friend, Chris, with his mom when she had dementia. He would prepare meals, keep her company and just be present. That is how Marvin always was. He didn’t mind helping those in need. His beautiful smile and contagious laughter made him very special to family and friends alike.\n\nPreceded in death by his parents Marvin Carter, Charlotte and Vincent Williams Sr. and nephews Vincent Williams III and Dwight Williams Junior.\n\nHe leaves to cherish his memory, sisters Clarissa Williams and Donna Williams, Brothers Vincent (Vida) Williams Jr, Ronald (Jennifer) Williams, Peter (Redonda) Williams and Dwight Williams.
