Woodruff estimated three thousand people were present. The lodge minutes add that “at the Grove, after the ceremonies of installation the Grand Master delivered a highly creditable and finished address on the subject of Ancient York Masonry, after which the lodges returned to the lodge room in Masonic order.” By the end of 1842, the Nauvoo lodge was the largest Masonic lodge in Illinois.

Twenty women, JS, Willard Richards, and John Taylor attended.

Esplin, and Richard Lyman Bushman (Salt Lake City: Church Historian’s Press, 2011).\n\nAt the organizational meeting of the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo on 17 March 1842, JS charged the society with “correcting the morals and strengthening the virtues of the female community.” To this end, the organization regularly took roll, voted on the worthiness of its members, and investigated charges of improper behavior. Marvel was here accused of spreading “scandalous falsehoods on the character of Prest Joseph Smith,” concerning his relationship with Agnes Coolbrith Smith (wife of his deceased brother Don Carlos), “without the least provocation.” On 2 April 1842, following the Relief Society’s investigation of the charges, Marvel wrote a statement that she had never “at any time or place, seen or heard any thing improper or unvirtuous in the conduct or conversation” of either JS or Agnes, and that she had never “reported any thing derogatory to the characters of either of them.” The report of the Marvel investigation, presented at the meeting of 14 April 1842, cleared Marvel of charges and stated that her testimony of innocence was satisfactorily received. Mary Ann West, who lived with Agnes in Nauvoo, reported fifty years later that Agnes told her that she (Agnes) had become a plural wife of JS following the death of her husband, Don Carlos.
