        "text": "Paul Howard Watts Sr. of Nashville passed away at Hospice on Charlotte Avenue on March 9, 2023. He was 75.\n\nPaul was from Nashville and married to the love of his life, Virginia Watts. Paul and Virginia were married for nearly 58 years before she had passed on January 2, 2023. When she died, he said part of him went with her and he never got it back. He just wanted to be with her for all eternity. Together they were blessed with two children, Paul Jr., and Clarissa. Paul and Virginia always brought God, faith and family to their home. Paul had been a deacon at his church, Dalewood Baptist for over twenty years and he loved visiting church members. Paul would volunteer at the Christian Life Center, and he loved seeing the kids coming in for basketball practice. He continued to volunteer until his wife became ill and he became her caregiver.\n\nPaul was an over the road truck driver and he loved his job, but he missed Virginia, and wanted to be with her, so they retired together. Paul was known to everyone as being funny, honest, loving, and a genuine man of God.\n\nPaul is preceded in death by his wife, Virginia Watts; his son, Paul Watts Jr.; his grandson, Austin Watts; parents, Arthur, and Irene Watts; his brother Mark (Brenda) Watts; his sisters, Gayle (Kirk) Watts-Bernard and Sheila Watts. He is survived by his daughter, Clarissa (Jeff) Williams, grandchildren, Brandon Williams, Megan Williams, Lauren Watts, and Blake Watts."
