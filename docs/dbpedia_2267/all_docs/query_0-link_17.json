        "text": "The page numbers on pages 19–71, 86–90, and 122–125 are in the handwriting of Willard Richards; on pages 72–85, 91–121, 126–167, and 171–477, in the handwriting of William Clayton; and on pages 168–170, in the handwriting of Erastus Derby. There are two pages numbered 453. Pages 476–477 constitute the last leaf of lined paper. The headers generally consist of a year or a month and year. The headers inscribed on pages 26–27, 29–71, 88–95, 119, and 121–126 are in the handwriting of Richards; the headers inscribed on pages 28, 72–87, 96–118, 120, 127–167, and 172–215 are in the handwriting of Clayton; pages 168–171, which were inscribed by Derby, have no headers. A few other pages are missing headers.\n\nMost of these now-erased graphite inscriptions are recoverable with bright white light and magnification. Pages 209–215, which were not erased, represent the state of the journal entries generally when they were used for drafting the “History of Joseph Smith.”\n\nOne of Richards’s entries records that he was ill “& did not take notes.” Other entries, such as those dictated by JS to William Clayton while in hiding, are clearly copies of previously inscribed notes.

While JS’s name appears as editor with vol. 3, no. 8, this transitional issue was begun by Ebenezer Robinson and completed by Taylor and Wilford Woodruff. JS’s actual responsibility as editor began with vol. 3, no. 9.b\n\n(aJS, Journal, 28 Jan. 1842. bEbenezer Robinson, “Valedictory,” Times and Seasons, 15 Feb. 1842, 3:695–696; “To Subscribers,” Times and Seasons, 1 Mar. 1842, 3:710; Ebenezer Robinson, “To the Public,” Times and Seasons, 15 Mar. 1842, 3:729; Woodruff, Journal, 19 Feb. 1842.)\n\nTimes and Seasons.

JS refused to pay taxes assessed on behalf of Commerce, “there being no such place known in law; the city & town of commerce having been included in the city plot of Nauvoo.” (Walter Bagby, “To Tax Payers,” Times and Seasons, 1 Mar. 1841, 2:334; Historian’s Office, JS History, draft notes, 2 Mar. 1842; see also JS History, vol.

On 24 October 1837, the court of common pleas at Chardon, Geauga County, Ohio, ordered JS and Sidney Rigdon to pay $1,000 each to Samuel D. Rounds. Rounds appointed Newell to collect the debt. On 1 March 1838, Newell acknowledged that JS’s agents William Marks and Oliver Granger had paid him $1,600 and that he would not seek the remaining $400, thereby settling the debt.
