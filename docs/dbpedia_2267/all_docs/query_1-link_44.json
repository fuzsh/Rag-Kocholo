        "text": "Mary “Billie” Adeline Riley Williams of Tunnelton, WV passed away peacefully on July 3, 2024 at Janet’s Heavenly Home in Tunnelton. She was born to the late William Riley and Mary Sylva Riley on July 20, 1930. Billie married the love of her life, Robert “Bob” Williams on February 14, 1953 and had been married nearly 69 years when he passed in 2022. Billie loved crafts, puzzles, and card games played with family. She was a fabulous baker and delighted in spoiling everyone with sweet treats, especially her famous coconut cream pies. Billie was one-of-a-kind; there will never be another one like her. She was intelligent, articulate, thoughtful, kind, loving, and generous. She was greatly loved by those who knew her and will be greatly missed.\n\nAs a beloved mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, Billie touched many lives in her nearly 94 years in this world. She will be forever missed by her son, Bryan Williams and his wife, Sandy; daughter, Suzanne Williams-McAuliffe and her husband, Brian McAuliffe; son-in-law, William “Bill” Adams; her grandchildren: Adrienne Blume; Andrea Williams Raines and her husband, David; Jared Adams and his wife, Ashley; Matthew Williams and his wife, Missy; Whitney Blume Man; Michael Adams and his fiancée, Clarissa Sanchez; step-grandchildren: Daniel McAuliffe and his wife, Tara; Matthew McAuliffe and his wife, Katherine; great-grandchildren: Benjamin & Daniel Raines; Peyton & Violet Adams; Xena & Xara Man; and Jaxson Adams; step-great-grandchildren: Jordan & Kellen McAuliffe; and many nieces, nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews.\n\nIn addition to her husband and her parents, Billie was preceded in death by her daughter, Debra Williams Adams; her granddaughter, Joanne Williams; her sisters: Beulah “Tootle” Riley Tiano; Lovie Lou “Tommie” Riley Walker; Ardella “Dell” Riley Campbell and her half-brother, Robert “Bob” Wiles.\n\nThe family would like to thank the dedicated staff at Janet’s Heavenly Home, namely Janet Haddix, Chastity Swisher, and Sharon Swearinger, who cared for Billie after her husband’s passing and treated her with such loving kindness and compassion. The family would also like to thank Sue Moon, who cared for Billie in her home, and whom she loved dearly, and to WV Caring, especially Bethany and Dena, for their invaluable end-of-life care.\n\nAt her request, Billie will be cremated and there will be no funeral. Her ashes will be interred with her husband at the National Cemetery in Pruntytown, West Virginia at a later date in a private ceremony. Memorial contributions can be made in her honor to Animal Friends of North Central West Virginia, PO Box 1090, Dellslow, WV 26531 or at animalfriendswv.org.\n\nOnline condolences can be made at www.kingwoodfuneralhomewv.com. Kingwood Funeral Home and Cremation is honored to serve the Williams family."
