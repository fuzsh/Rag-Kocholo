        "text": "Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps\n\nThis collection contains large-scale, detailed maps from 1867 into the early 20th century depicting the commercial, industrial, and residential sections of many Utah cities. They were designed in 1866 by surveyor D.A. Sanborn to assist fire insurance agents in determining the risk associated with insuring a particular property. The map surveyors meticulously documented the structural evidence of urbanization - building by building, block by block, and community by community.\n\nRare Books Collection\n\nThe Rare Books Division of Special Collections holds more than 80,000 books, maps and ephemera representing the written record of world history from ancient clay tablet to 21st century artists' books. By actively collecting, preserving and digitizing material of historical and aesthetic importance the Rare Books Division provides reference, research and educational access to local, regional and international communities, strengthening the ability of faculty to teach, students to learn, and communities to find common denominators.\n\nSalt Lake Tribune Negative Collection\n\nThis collection contains over 171,000 images from the 1930s to the 1960s. The collection is unique in origin as it includes images taken by dozens of different photographers sent out by the newspaper to get the perfect shot, something newsworthy. This results in many live action images taken of the everyday activities of life with no posing such as one sees with studio photography.\n\nUtah COVID-19\n\nThe Utah COVID-19 Digital Collection Project has been created to document the response from the University of Utah and greater Utah community to the Coronavirus pandemic of 2020. We are soliciting photographs and stories from residents around the State of Utah to share with the world how the pandemic has affected their lives. Oral histories from the University of Utah are also included."
