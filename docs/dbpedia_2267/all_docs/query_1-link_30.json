        "text": "Michael Don Williams, beloved father, fiance, son, grandson, brother, uncle and friend, died unexpectedly on Monday, December 13, 2021, following a years-long battle with Trigeminal Neuralgia. Michael is survived by his daughter, Milah Williams and her mother Asia Guetzkow of Abilene; his mother Tracie (Steve) Willyard of Granbury, Texas; his brother, David (Clarissa) of Abilene; his sister JD (Mitchell) Doty of Cypress, Texas; his grandparents and best friends Mandy and George Gurganus of Abilene, as well as his many loving nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, and cousins. Michael was preceded in death by his father, Randy Williams, in 2012.\n\nBorn in Abilene on February 27, 1997, Michael was an ambitious and talented young man, with a huge smile and a bigger heart. It was nearly impossible to know Michael and not love him. He filled every room he was in--with his big, boisterous laugh, his big smile, and his overall size. Nothing about Michael was small.\n\nMichael was so talented, at almost everything he tried. Football? Good at it. Basketball? Good at it. Golf, disc golf, singing, picking up girls at the Frio River? You guessed it; good at it. And baseball? Michael was absolutely GREAT at it. Some of his favorite and most cherished memories and friendships were made on a baseball field somewhere, and in an easier life, he might still be playing. A few years ago, Michael tackled the idea of learning to play the guitar. After countless hours of studying YouTube videos, he became a pretty decent musician. He loved to have mini jam sessions with friends, his uncle, and his grandmother. We are all so thankful for the videos left on his social media pages for us to embrace now in his absence.\n\nMichael was so good at so many things, but what he did best was love the people around him. Watching Michael play for hours on end with his precious daughter Milah brought the rest of his family the most joy and comfort. Seeing her laugh and smile, even when he would pretend to be the bad guy was proof of every ounce of love between the two.\n\nHe was a young man with a lot of ambitious dreams. Because of his laid back mentality, he quickly realized his potential as a salesman. Many would joke that he could sell ice to an Eskimo. It was never that the customer felt pressured to buy whatever he was selling (cars, buildings, etc) but they felt at ease with their decision.\n\nMichael has struggled for several years with Trigeminal Neuralgia, and the resulting chronic, debilitating pain. In July of 2021, he underwent MVD (microvascular decompression) surgery, and doctors were able to fix blood flow through the nerves. Finally, Michael had some relief, and his family started to see that big smile of his again, and hear more of that boisterous, infectious laugh. Michael was able to eat without pain, spend more time with Milah and Asia, and help plan his upcoming wedding. Michael was on the road to marrying the love of his life, Asia Guetzkow this spring, with their sweet and beautiful Milah Rose by their side.\n\nMichael's family invites you to join them in a celebration of Michael's life on Saturday, December 18, from 11:00 - 1:00 at the South Side Baptist Church, located at 1425 S 7th St. in Abilene, Texas. Funeral services will begin immediately after at 1:00pm, with burial to take place following the service at Elmwood Funeral Home located at 5750 US 277 S Abilene, Tx 79606. Family and friends are invited back to the church for dinner.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to help Milah (his daughter) and Asia (his fianc√©) at https://gofund.me/46a98675 or click the Go Fund Me link below uder the donations tab.\n\nPallbearers are David Williams Jr, Mitchell Doty, Will Norris, Jake Muchugh, Mark Pearson, Osten Downing, Aron Abbe, Reece Childress.\n\nHonorary Pallbearers: George Gurganus, Dan Flatt, Josh Fowler, Matt Peal, Connor Reese, Conner Hendrick, Javier Langmeyer,"
