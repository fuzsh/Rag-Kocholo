        "text": "In 1863 Orange County, New York resident Lydia Sayer Hasbrouck refused to pay her city taxes. Her reasoning was simple; she would not pay taxes if she could not vote. An outspoken hydropthic physician and editor of the dress reform newspaper, The Sibyl, Hasbrouck refused to accept that the husband’s vote represented the wife’s interests. Lydia Sayer Hasbrouck’s refusal to pay her taxes in protest of women’s disenfranchisement fits within the larger context of tactics used by the nineteenth-century woman’s suffrage movement. Hasbrouck’s contribution stands out, however, because she used The Sibyl as a tool to describe her personal experiences fighting for the vote. Based on an analysis of articles and readers’ correspondence published in The Sibyl, this article argues that Hasbrouck used her newspaper to create a long-distance community of women and to spark conversations about suffrage. In doing so, Hasbrouck emphasized to her readers that they did not have to be involved in the organized woman’s movement to fight for suffrage; regular women could take action in their daily lives."
