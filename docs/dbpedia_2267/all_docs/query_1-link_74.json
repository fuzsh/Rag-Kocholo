She was a teller at the Beaver Valley Federal Credit Union, Beaver Falls, for the past 12 years and a member of Christ Presbyterian Church, Chippewa Twp. Clarissa loved people but especially her family. She was looking forward to the birth of her first grandchild. In her spare time, she wholeheartedly enjoyed museums (art and history in particular), traveling, cooking and trying new recipes. Simple enjoyments like reading, feeding squirrels, bird watching, or just surfing the internet were always held dear to her as well.\n\nShe is survived by her husband of 38 years, Ralph E. Ancil, daughter and son-in-law, Kristina & Philip Edwards, Washington, D.C; son BM3 Erik Ancil, (U.S. Coast Guard) Charleston, SC; nephews Aaron & Ryan and niece Gena; and sisters-in-law Sue and Alicia.\n\nIn addition to her parents, she was preceded in death by two brothers Gregory & Joseph Lack.\n\nInterment will be in Penn Forest Natural Burial Park, Verona.\n\nFriends will be received August 15th from 6 PM until time of memorial service at 7 PM in the Hill & Kunselman Funeral Home, www.hillandkunselman.com, 3801-4th Avenue, Beaver Falls, PA 15010.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made if desired to Christ Presbyterian Church, 828 Blackhawk Road, Beaver Falls, PA 15010."
