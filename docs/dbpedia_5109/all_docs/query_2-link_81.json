The object will only be present in a video resource if the video is an upcoming, live, or completed live broadcast. liveStreamingDetails.actualStartTime datetime\n\nThe time that the broadcast actually started. The value is specified in ISO 8601 format. This value will not be available until the broadcast begins. liveStreamingDetails.actualEndTime datetime\n\nThe time that the broadcast actually ended. The value is specified in ISO 8601 format. This value will not be available until the broadcast is over. liveStreamingDetails.scheduledStartTime datetime\n\nThe time that the broadcast is scheduled to begin. The value is specified in ISO 8601 format. liveStreamingDetails.scheduledEndTime datetime\n\nThe time that the broadcast is scheduled to end. The value is specified in ISO 8601 format. If the value is empty or the property is not present, then the broadcast is scheduled to continue indefinitely. liveStreamingDetails.concurrentViewers unsigned long\n\nThe number of viewers currently watching the broadcast. The property and its value will be present if the broadcast has current viewers and the broadcast owner has not hidden the viewcount for the video. Note that YouTube stops tracking the number of concurrent viewers for a broadcast when the broadcast ends. So, this property would not identify the number of viewers watching an archived video of a live broadcast that already ended.\n\nThe concurrent viewer counts that the YouTube Data API returns might differ from the processed, despammed concurrent viewer counts available through YouTube Analytics. Learn more about live streaming metrics in the YouTube Help Center.\n\nliveStreamingDetails.activeLiveChatId string\n\nThe ID of the currently active live chat attached to this video. This field is filled only if the video is a currently live broadcast that has live chat. Once the broadcast transitions to complete this field will be removed and the live chat closed down. For persistent broadcasts that live chat id will no longer be tied to this video but rather to the new video being displayed at the persistent page. localizations object\n\nThe localizations object contains translations of the video's metadata. localizations.(key) object\n\nThe language of the localized text associated with the key value. The value is a string that contains a BCP-47 language code. localizations.(key).title string\n\nThe localized video title."
