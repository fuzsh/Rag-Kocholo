Copy them into a directory with your theme named /bws-templates.\n\nExample: To override the single gallery template, please copy /wp-content/plugins/gallery-plugin/templates/gallery-single-template.php to wp-content/themes/your-theme/bws-templates/gallery-single-template.php.\n\nDo not edit these files in the plugin’s core directly as they are overwritten during the upgrade process and any customizations will be lost.\n\nI’m getting the following error: “Fatal error: Call to undefined function get_post_thumbnail_id()”. What should I do?\n\nThis error means that your theme doesn’t support thumbnail option, in order to add this option please find the file ‘functions.php’ in your theme and add the following strings to this file:\n\nadd_action( 'after_setup_theme', 'theme_setup' ); function theme_setup() { add_theme_support( 'post-thumbnails' ); }\n\nAfter that your theme will support thumbnail option and the error will disappear.\n\nHow to change image order on the single gallery page?\n\nPlease open the menu “Galleries” and choose a gallery from the list. It will take you to the gallery editing page. Use the drag and drop function to change the order of the images and do not forget to save the post. Do not forget to select Sort images by -> Sorting order in the Gallery in the plugin settings.\n\nI am using WP with rtl language and I have a problem with the lightbox displaying on iPad/iPhone.\n\nIn the file header.php you should substitute <html <?php language_attributes(); ?>> with <html>\n\nRemove the “direction:rtl” from the css of the body, and move it to the main wrapper. For example, in your theme CSS file (usually it’s rtl.css) remove the following lines:\n\nbody {\n\ndirection:rtl;\n\n}\n\nand add (for the themes Twenty Eleven or Twenty Ten):\n\n.hfeed { direction: rtl; }\n\nI have some problems with the plugin’s work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support?\n\nPlease make sure that the problem hasn’t been discussed yet on our forum (https://support.bestwebsoft.com). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem’s description:\n\nthe link to the page where the problem occurs\n\nthe name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version – your order number.\n\nthe version of your WordPress installation\n\ncopy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: Instruction on System Status\n\nReviews\n\n1 reply\n\nClient has been using free version for a few years, but called me when they couldn’t change the settings or add a new gallery. Reinstalled entire website – updated WordPress, Theme and all plugins to latest version – now at least they can create new galleries but the settings still don’t work. I’m guessing this is a con to force you to go pro – but having had no business for over a year the client will not spend any money especially as WordPress now appears to have support for galleries “out of the box”. Just a real pain for them to have to move everything into a new galery as the site has over 1500 photos (after pruning from over 3500)\n\nThis is an awesome plugin, this plugin saved my time and made my work simple\n\nВсе удобно, все понятно.\n\nThe BestWebSoft team were able to successfully update my Gallery-Pro from an older version to the newest. Major incompatibilities, but they got it fixed. It was with great relieve that I saw the 30 some galleries back, and working! BWS support did a great job, in a reasonable time. Thanks Roger\n\nThe plugin does what it needs to do and the customer service is great!\n\n1 reply\n\nThey distort your images in the thumbnail view and the only way to get them to show correctly is to purchase the Pro version. Hey guys, that’s not the way you do it. You provide a solid product for free and give something extra with the Pro version. Instead, you distort the free version and the only way to make it right is to force users to spend more money. I’m having my developers buy another plugin next week. Just out of principle, won’t buy this one.\n\nRead all 158 reviews\n\nContributors & Developers\n\n“Gallery by BestWebSoft – Customizable Image and Photo Galleries for WordPress” is open source software.
