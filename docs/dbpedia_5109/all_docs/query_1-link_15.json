        "text": "Instagram is among the most popular social networks today. It has over 1.074 billion users and is growing rapidly. It is a specialized social network in the image and short video sharing and recently moved towards instant messaging.\n\nInstagram has grown so rapidly in the photo-sharing sphere and mobile that Facebook decided to acquire it for $1 billion to expand its roots in mobile and photo-sharing. At the time, most people believed that it was overvalued but seeing a whopping 1.074 billion active monthly users, and billions of shared images, it is now valued even higher than that.\n\nWhile Instagram is around for a while, people keep asking me what the size of Instagram pictures is. Instagram image size used to be 612px by 612px but then switched to 640px by 640px and on July 2015, switched to 1080px by 1080px to keep up with Retina and other high resolution displays available on smartphones, tablets and laptops. Later that year Instagram introduced vertical and horizontal images widely used by Instagramers and influencers. And here are the maximums image sizes for square, vertical and horizontal images. You can now use any image size between those.\n\nInstagram Image Sizes for 2023\n\nCurrent image size is 1080px in width X 1080px in height. We expect that Instagram will keep this image size for an extended period, otherwise, they would have bumped image size even more. While the image size is bumped to 1080px by 1080px, it is still scaled down to 640px by 640px using CSS on their website. These images will look better on high-resolution Retina (HiDPI) displays. You don’t need to get into these technical details and remember to keep your image size 1080px by 1080px.\n\nUNLIMITED DOWNLOADS: 500,000+ Social Media Graphics & Design Assets\n\nAll the Social Media Graphics you need and many other design elements, are available for a monthly subscription by subscribing to Envato Elements. The subscription costs $29 per month and gives you unlimited access to a massive and growing library of 500,000+ items. You can download these items as often as you need (stock photos too)!\n\nBelow you can see a sample Instagram image and its dimensions:\n\nSquare Instagram Image (Original Size)\n\nVertical Instagram Image\n\nLandscape Instagram Image\n\nTo create the best-looking Instagram images, you should keep your camera settings to a higher resolution than the one Instagram recommends. The reason is that it crops the images and you don’t want to make them look pixelated.\n\nCreators expect this year to year of 4K resolution in TVs, monitors, laptops and even tablets, so we can expect that Instagram will increase the image size even further. I will keep this post up to date so you can be sure that the information above is accurate and the Instagram image size is now 1080px by 1080px.\n\nSince July 2015, Instagram now uses 1080px by 1080px images.\n\nSince November 2015, Instagram supports vertical and horizontal images between 608px and 1350px in height. The developers set the maximum size for all image formats to 1080px.\n\nTo make Instagram marketing even easier and your posts look professional, we have created a list of Instagram mockups that will take your profile to a completely different league.\n\nWe have updated the post to include sizes for Instagram profile pictures, stories, and reels cover."
