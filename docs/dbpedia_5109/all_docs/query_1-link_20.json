At the end there is also a troubleshooting section and links to other IP Phone model image specifics.\n\nComponents for this specific howto:\n\n7965/7945 IP Phone\n\nCallManager Linux-based (5.x/6.x/7.x/8.x)\n\nThe Gimp editing software\n\n(Linux: Installed by default in Ubuntu / Windows: http://www.gimp.org/windows/)\n\nA picture file of your preference\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nRead the official guide: http://tools.cisco.com/squish/4441e\n\nCallManager Administrator and OS Administrator access\n\nThis document contains the step by step Procedures and the Video for Modifying the background Image of an IP Phone.\n\nThe Complete recording of the Video can be accessed here.\n\nSteps:\n\nOpen the picture with The Gimp\n\nIn my case, the image I selected is 225x168px, so it doesn't meet the size requirements (see Prerequisites).\n\nGo to Image > Canvas Size (If your image is bigger than the specified size, go to Image > Scale Image and follow next steps).\n\nClick the chain icon next to the pixels drop-down menu, and change the canvas size (or image size if you are scaling it) to Width:320 / Height:212\n\nClick the \"Center\" button so that the image stays centered on the new space, or drag the preview thumbnail to a corner of your choice within the canvas' space (if you are scaling the image the \"Center\" button and the drag option are not there)\n\nClick Resize\n\nNote the changes\n\nNow we need to put a white background.\n\nRight click the image layer on the layer window\n\nClick Flatten Image at the very bottom.\n\nNow we need to make sure there are no more colors than the phone can accept.\n\nGo to Colors > Posterize. This tool works with powers of 2. An IP Phone cannot display more than 65535 colors, so increase or decrease the posterize levels to no more than 15, as 15 is the closest power of 2 to 65535 (2 to the power of 15 is 32768)\n\nClick ok\n\nGo to File > Save as > choose PNG as the file type\n\nClick Save\n\nNow lets fabricate the thumbnail\n\nGo to Image > Scale Image and type 80 in the Width field\n\nThe Height field should automatically populate to 53\n\nSave the image in PNG type just as we did before\n\nTry to keep simple, short names like img.png and img-tmb.png\n\nNow we will tailor the XML file that lists the available images\n\nDownload this example List.xml, or copy this content to a regular text file, and save it as an .xml archive:\n\n<CiscoIPPhoneImageList><ImageItem Image=\"TFTP:Desktops/320x212x16/IMAGE-THUMB.png\"\n\nURL=\"TFTP:Desktops/320x212x16/IMAGE.png\"/>\n\n</CiscoIPPhoneImageList>\n\nReplace IMAGE-THUMB.png in the code wih the name chosen for your preview size image. Don't forget the double quotes at the end.\n\nReplace IMAGE.png in this code with the name chosen for your full size image. Don't forget the double quotes at the end.\n\nSave the file so that it reads: List.xml (case sensitive)\n\nIf you need to present more than 1 image options to your users, copy/paste the <ImageItem.... block and replace the names with the other image names as in step 2 an 3\n\nTime to upload all 3 files to the TFTP server\n\nGo to Cisco OS Administration > Software Upgrades > TFTP File Management\n\nClick on Upload File\n\nIn the Upload File field enter the path where your full size image, thumbnail image and List.xml files are\n\nIn the Directory field, enter: /Desktops/320x212x16 (include the forward slashes and delete any white space at the end)\n\nHit the Upload file button for each individual file you are transferring\n\nBack at the TFTP File Management window, type the name of your files and click Find to verify they are there.\n\nGo to Cisco Unified Serviceability > Tools > Control Center - Feature Center > Select the Cisco TFTP radio button and restart the service by clicking the green triangle button at the top of the page, or the Restart button near the end\n\nOn the IP Phone, go to Settings > User Preferences > Background Images, and choose the thumbnail that you want to apply. They should be there now\n\nTroubleshooting:\n\nNOTE: When dealing with image difficulties, try restarting the TFTP after each file upload\n\nProblem: you go to Phone settings, and there you can see other background options, but can't really see the picture\n\nSolution: it is most likely because of the color depth issue. Change the levels as mentioned in step 1-11\n\nProblem: you go to Phone settings, and there are no options to change the image\n\nSolution 1: After saving the file with some text editors, eventhough you specify an .xml extension, the program might add a .txt at the end. Erase it.\n\nSolution 2: open an SSH session to the CallManager node where the XML and PNG files were uploaded. run this command, make sure the files were correctly uploaded:\n\nfile list activelog cm/tftpdata/Desktops/320x212x16\n\nIf not, then you uploaded them to another node, or there is something wrong with the TFTP transaction\n\nSolution 3: open the List.xml file with a browser. If it shows a syntax error, then there is a quote, bracket or other mistake in the XML syntax. No files will be shown in the phone. A good syntax should look like this in your browser:\n\nProblem: You can see the thumbnail just fine, but when you select it, it shows \"FILE NOT FOUND\" error message.\n\nSolution 1: At this point we are sure the XML file is ok, because the thumbnail is there, but the path or the name of the full-size image is incorrect. Open the XML list and make sure the image extension is lower case png and not GIF, JPG or other format, and that the name is correct.\n\nSolution 2: see solution 2 from previous Problem\n\nSolution 3: it has happened that the TFTP transaction flow is affected somehow, so you might correct the XML file, save it, but when you go to the upload step you are actually uploading an old version of it, still pointing to a JPG image or to an older image name. In order to verify the contents of the file you just uploaded, run this command from an SSH Session, and check if the syntax is ok and pointing to the correct file:\n\nfile view activelog cm/tftpdata/Desktops/320x212x16/List.xml\n\nProblem: You go to the Background Images menu on your IP Phone, but the \"Selections Unavailable\" message comes up, some phones may show the thumbnails just fine.\n\nSolution 1: After saving the file with some text editors, eventhough you specify an .xml extension, the program might add a .txt at the end. Erase it.\n\nSolution 2: open an SSH session to the CallManager node where the XML and PNG files were uploaded. run this command, make sure the files were correctly uploaded:\n\nfile list activelog cm/tftpdata/Desktops/320x212x16\n\nIf not, then you uploaded them to another node, or there is something wrong with the TFTP transaction\n\nSolution 3: open the List.xml file with a browser. If it shows a syntax error, then there is a quote, bracket or other mistake in the XML syntax. No files will be shown in the phone. A good syntax should look like this in your browser:\n\nImage specifications for other models:\n\nThese same instructions may be used with different phone models, however the TFTP directory path may change according to the display size of your model. Please verify the specifics.\n\n7911: Desktops/95x34x1 . The background dimensions are 95x34, the thumbnail is 24x9.\n\n7941/7961: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/partner/docs/voice_ip_comm/cuipph/7962g_7961g_7961g-ge_7942g_7941g_7941g-ge/7_1/english/administration/guide/62614241cus.html#wp1030672\n\n7942/7962: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cuipph/7962g_7942g/7_0/english/administration/guide/7962cus.html#wp1030672\n\n7970/7971/IP Communicator: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/partner/docs/voice_ip_comm/cuipph/7970g_7971g-ge/english/5_1/sip/english/adminstraton/guide/7970cst.html#wp1088046\n\n7975: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/partner/docs/voice_ip_comm/cuipph/7975g/6_0/english/administration/guide/7975cst.html#wp1088046\n\n7985: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cuipph/7985g/4_1/english/administration/guide/7985adm2.pdf\n\nUpdate:\n\nLatest setting for Cisco Unified IP Phone 7975G, 7971G-GE, 7970G, 7965G, and 7945G based on CUCM 8.5:\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cuipph/7975G_7971g-ge_7970g_7965g_7945g/8_5/english/admin_guide/7970cst.html\n\nLabels:\n\nPreview file\n\n1 KB"
