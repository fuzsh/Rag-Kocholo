        "text": "Navigating social media image sizes is like trying to keep up with a chameleon on a rainbow rollercoaster â€“ it changes faster than you can say \"cheese\" for your next Instagram post! ðŸ“¸\n\nOne moment, your profile looks pristine with the perfect cover photo, and the next, it's gone all pixelated and wonky, like it's been through a digital blender.\n\nAnd let's be honest, finding official dimensions and image sizes is about as easy as finding a unicorn at the local zoo! It's like trying to have a civilised discussion about politics on Facebook - nearly impossible.\n\nBut fret not, intrepid social media voyager! We've got your back with the ultimate guide to social media image sizes for all the bigwig platforms. Consider it your treasure map to pixel-perfection!\n\nBelow, we present you with the freshest, juiciest social media image dimensions hot off the press as of September 2023.\n\nInstagram Image Sizes\n\nInstagram is a land of visual creativity, and it's got your back whether you're a fan of horizontal, vertical, or the classic square image format - a throwback to its early days!\n\nThis versatility offers your brand a canvas as broad as your imagination. However, it also means that nailing those image dimensions can be a bit tricky. To ensure your images look their best, it is essential to stick to the following guidelines:\n\nInstagram Profile Picture Size:\n\nAlthough Instagram displays profile pictures at a compact 110 x 100 pixels, the actual image files are stored at a resolution of 320 x 320 pixels. So, when you upload your pic, go big or go home!\n\nNotably, despite the square storage, these profile pics show up as circles. To avoid any accidental cropping, make sure the juiciest bits are right in the middle. No one likes a half-cut profile pic, right?\n\nInstagram Post Sizes (Feed Photos):\n\nLandscape: 1080 x 566 pixels\n\nPortrait: 1080 x 1350 pixels\n\nSquare: 1080 x 1080 pixels\n\nSupported Aspect Ratios: Anywhere between 1.91:1 and 4:5\n\nProfessional Tips:\n\nYour image will look its Insta-best at 1080 pixels wide. That's the sweet spot!\n\nIf you go over 1080 or below 320 pixels, Instagram will automatically resize the image for you.\n\nKeep the aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5 (height ranging from 566 to 1350 pixels with a width of 1080 pixels).\n\nInstagram Photo Thumbnail Sizes:\n\nDisplay Size: A dainty 161 x 161 pixels\n\nRecommended Upload Size: Go big with 1080 pixels wide\n\nPro Tips:\n\nFun fact: Instagram secretly hoards larger versions of these thumbnails, measuring up to a spacious 1080 x 1080 pixels. Yep, they like to have options!\n\nTo future-proof your Instagram grid and steer clear of pixel pandemonium, aim to upload images that are as sizeable as possible. Think of it as your picture insurance policy!\n\nNow, let's dive into Instagram Stories, where pixels tell a compelling story:\n\nInstagram Stories Image Size:\n\n1080 x 1920 pixels.This magical ratio: 9:16.\n\nMore Pro Tips:\n\nSpeed matters: If you upload an image with a smaller pixel size (but stick to the same aspect ratio), your Story will buffer quickly and zip through like a hot knife through butter.\n\nBe aware of deviating from this sacred 9:16 ratio. Using the wrong ratio can result in strange cropping, zooming, and blank sections of the screen.\n\nInstagram Reels play by the same sizing rules. So, you're all set to rock the 'gram with your pixel-perfect stories and reels!\n\nInstagram Carousel Image Sizes:\n\nLet's unravel the Instagram carousel image sizes, Instagram Reels dimensions, and Instagram ads image specifications:\n\nLandscape: A cool 1080 x 566 pixels\n\nPortrait: A tall drink of water at 1080 x 1350 pixels\n\nSquare: A perfect square at 1080 x 1080 pixels\n\nAspect Ratios: Go landscape (1.91:1), square (1:1), or vertical (4:5)\n\nRecommended Image Size: Keep the width at 1080 pixels, and the height varies between 566 and 1350 pixels, depending on whether you're feeling landscape or portrait vibes.\n\nInstagram Reels Sizes:\n\nMain Reels: A slick 1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nCover Photo: Same size at 1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nBut remember: Reels get cropped to a 1:1 image in your profile feed and a 4:5 image in the home feed. They like to keep things dynamic!\n\nInstagram Ads Image Sizes:\n\nLandscape: 1080 x 566 pixels (for a wide view)\n\nSquare: 1080 x 1080 pixels (for a classic look)\n\nMinimum Width: 320 pixels (to make sure it shows up!)\n\nMaximum Width: 1080 pixels (for a crisp display)\n\nSupported Aspect Ratios: Anywhere between 1.91:1 and 4:5, so you've got room to play!\n\nPro Tip: Instagram Adâ€™s Text Recommendations\n\nPrimary Text (Caption): 125 Characters\n\nKeep it concise and engaging. Share your message or story effectively in this limited space.\n\nAsk questions to encourage engagement.\n\nUse emojis to add personality and convey emotions.\n\nInclude a call-to-action (CTA) to prompt your audience to take a specific action.\n\nShare interesting facts, quotes, or anecdotes related to your content.\n\nHeadline: 40 Characters\n\nMake it attention-grabbing and to the point.\n\nHighlight the key message or benefit of your post.\n\nUse action words to inspire action or curiosity.\n\nConsider adding relevant keywords for discoverability.\n\nMaximum Number of Hashtags: 30\n\nMix popular and niche hashtags to reach a broader audience while targeting specific communities.\n\nCreate a branded hashtag unique to your content or campaign.\n\nResearch trending hashtags that relate to your post.\n\nKeep hashtags relevant to your content to maintain authenticity.\n\nExperiment with different combinations of hashtags to see which ones yield the best results.\n\nHide your hashtags within the caption or comment section to maintain a clean appearance.\n\nRemember that your Instagram text should align with your content, brand, and the preferences of your target audience. Experiment, analyse, and refine your approach to discover what resonates best with your followers.\n\nImage Size for Instagram Stories Ads:\n\nResolution: 1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nTips for Instagram Stories Ads:\n\nInstagram recommends leaving approximately \"14% (250 pixels) of the top and bottom of the image free from text and logos.\" This space ensures that crucial information isn't covered by the overlaying elements that may appear when viewing Stories.\n\nAs of September 2020, Facebook and Instagram ads no longer face penalties if more than 20% of the ad space contains text. This update provides advertisers with greater flexibility in using text elements within their ad creatives. However, it's still essential to maintain a balance between text and visuals for a compelling and engaging ad.\n\nThere you have it! With these dimensions in your pocket, you're all set to paint Instagram with your visual masterpiece, whether it's in a carousel, a Reel, or an eye-catching ad.\n\nX (a.k.a. Twitter)\n\nLet's dive into the world of image sizes for X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nProfile Photos:\n\nRecommended Size: 400 x 400 pixels\n\nMinimum Image Size: 200 x 200 pixels\n\nMaximum File Size: 2MB\n\nHeader Photo:\n\nRecommended Size: 1500 x 500 pixels\n\nTip: To future-proof your image, go for the max size.\n\nNote: Header images are cropped to a 3:1 aspect ratio and may display differently based on the user's screen and browser.\n\nIn-Stream Photos:\n\nRecommended Size: 1600 x 900 pixels\n\nMinimum Size: 600 x 335 pixels\n\nRecommended Aspect Ratio: Desktop - anything from 2:1 to 1:1; Mobile - 2:1, 3:4, and 16:9\n\nSupported Formats: GIF, JPG, PNG\n\nMaximum File Size: Up to 5MB for mobile and up to 15MB on the web.\n\nCard Images:\n\nTwitter recognizes when a post includes a URL and fetches content, including an image for the summary card.\n\nMinimum Size: 120 x 120 pixels\n\nSupported Formats: GIF, JPG, PNG\n\nMaximum File Size: 1MB\n\nTip: Use the card validator to preview how your summary card will appear.\n\nImage Sizes for Ads:\n\nSingle and multi-image tweets: Minimum 600 x 335 pixels, but larger images work best.\n\nWebsite card image: 800 x 418 pixels for 1.91:1 aspect ratio or 800 x 800 for 1:1 aspect ratio.

If you've got more to share, link to your website or start a Tweet thread.\n\nWith these image sizes in your toolkit, you'll be able to craft visually stunning and engaging content on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nLinkedIn Image Sizes\n\nWe love LinkedIn; of all the major platforms, itâ€™s definitely the most underrated. But if youâ€™re not familiar with the platform, it can be a bit confusing to know what exactly to post. Itâ€™s not Instagram, so youâ€™re not going to share photos of your latest meal. And itâ€™s not Facebook, so fur babies and real babies are not great content.\n\nBut make no mistake, LinkedIn is the ultimate lead generator. Use the recommended sizes below to get the best results. Be sure to view your profile and content on multiple devices before finalising.\n\nLinkedIn Profile Photos:\n\nRecommended: 400 x 400 pixels or larger\n\nTip: Go big! LinkedIn can handle images up to 7680 x 4320 pixels. The larger, the better (up to 8MB).\n\nCover Photos for Personal Profiles:\n\nRecommended: 1584 x 396 pixels\n\nAspect Ratio: 4:1\n\nTip: Keep the file size under 8MB.
