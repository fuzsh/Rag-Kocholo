The authors demonstrate perfect impedance matching in an rf readout circuit, measure the absolute sensitivity to quantum capacitance changes, and establish a clear requirement for single-shot readout. This work will aid research not just in quantum computing, but also in nanomechanics and ac quantum transport.",
