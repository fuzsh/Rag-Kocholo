        "text": "— Premium Feature —\n\nYou can enhance Radio Buttons and Checkboxes with images. Image options can be customized for an image survey, quiz, poll, purchase form, and many more. This option will replace the radio button or checkbox with images you select.\n\nBy default, text labels are shown with images but can be hidden. Choose the image size that works best for your form. Then set the colors and other styling features in the visual form styler.\n\nAdd radio or checkbox with images\n\nTo add images in a Checkbox or Radio Button field:\n\nAdd a Radio button or Checkbox field to your form.\n\nSelect Images as the Display Format.\n\nSelect a size for the images in the Image Size dropdown.\n\nSelect the Hide option labels box if you don't want the labels to show.\n\nSelect the Use separate values box if you want to store an entry as a value distinct from the selected value. Read more about separate values.\n\nEach option includes an image and a text label. Fill in a text label. Each option must have a text label, even if you're not showing it in the form.\n\nClick on the Upload Image button to choose an image. You can upload a new image or select an image that already exists in the Media Library.\n\nClick the Add Options link to add more options to your field.\n\nYou can also use images in a button-style layout. Learn more about using images in a button.\n\nReplace selected image\n\nTo change a radio button or checkbox image:\n\nClick Delete to remove the currently selected image.\n\nClick on the Upload Image button to select a new image.\n\nImage sizes\n\nAll image sizes are displayed as a square. The size options are:\n\nSmall: 150px (the default size)\n\nMedium: 250px\n\nLarge: 320px\n\nExtra large: 400px\n\nTo set a custom size, go to Formidable → Global Settings → Custom CSS and add this CSS:\n\n#frm_field_160_container.frm_image_options { --image-size:100px; }\n\nReplace 160 with the ID of the field to change, or remove #frm_field_160_container to apply to all fields.\n\nStyling image options\n\nImage options use values from your form styling settings. You can change the appearance of image options with the following Style settings:\n\nDefault border: Field Colors → Border\n\nBorder hover/selected color: Field Colors → Active Style → Border\n\nCheckmark background color: (same as Border hover/selected color)\n\nBorder width: Field Colors → Thickness\n\nBorder radius/corners: Field Settings → Corners\n\nDisplay image choices\n\nDisplay selected images in a form confirmation message, email, or View.\n\nShortcode options\n\nShow image and label: By default, images will be displayed. Labels will be displayed if labels are displayed in the field. You can override these defaults with the show_image and show_label params.\n\n[x]\n\nReplace x with the ID of the radio/checkbox field.\n\nHide image: Hide the image and show only the label:\n\n[x show_image=0]\n\nReplace x with the ID of the radio/checkbox field.\n\nHide label: If the label is set to show in the form, it will show by default here. To hide it, use:\n\n[x show_label=0]\n\nReplace x with the ID of the radio/checkbox field.\n\nShow label: If the label is set to be hidden in the form, it will be hidden by default here. To show it, use:\n\n[x show_label=1]\n\nReplace x with the ID of the radio/checkbox field.\n\nAdd link: Link to the full-sized image.\n\n[x add_link=1]\n\nReplace x with the ID of the radio/checkbox field.\n\nOpen link in new tab: Open the link to the image in a new browser tab. The new_tab=1 parameter must be used in conjunction with the add_link=1 parameter.\n\n[x add_link=1 new_tab=1]\n\nReplace x with the ID of the radio/checkbox field.\n\nImage size: Set the image display size using either size=thumbnail, size=medium, or size=full. The default size displayed is the thumbnail. In WordPress, the default thumbnail size is a 150x150 image. Specify a different size to show a bigger image.\n\n[x size=full]\n\nReplace x with the ID of the radio/checkbox field.\n\nShow attachment ID: Display the attachment ID of the selected image.\n\n[x show=id]\n\nReplace x with the ID of the file upload field.\n\nYou can display a field that has image options using field shortcodes like [100] or the frm-field-value shortcode.\n\nDefault email message\n\nBy default, images selected in radio buttons and checkboxes will be shown with the default-message shortcode in HTML emails and the frm-show-entry shortcode.\n\nIn plain text emails, the labels will be shown without images.\n\nTo hide images in the default-message or frm-show-entry shortcodes, add show_image_options=0.\n\nFor example:\n\n[default-message show_image_options=0]\n\nLimitations\n\nThe option to display images is not included in Lookup and Dynamic fields.\n\nThe bulk editor is not available for use with image options.\n\nImage options aren't designed to work with Add Other options.\n\nCategories\n\nUsing WordPress and want to get Formidable Forms for free?\n\nGet Formidable Forms Lite Now\n\nSubmit doc feedback\n\nWas this article helpful? *\n\nGreat\n\nNot good\n\nWhat did you like about this article?\n\nWhat did you find most unhelpful? *\n\nIt didn’t answer my questions or solve my problem.\n\nI found it confusing or difficult to read.\n\nThe feature works differently than I expected.\n\nOther\n\nWe are constantly working to make our documentation better!
