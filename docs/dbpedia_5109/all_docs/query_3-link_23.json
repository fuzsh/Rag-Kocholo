        "text": "Young aristocrat, Dorian Gray, is given a portrait of himself by a celebrated artist. Yet after climbing ever-higher through London's decadent Victorian social circles and a world of infinite pleasures, Dorian starts sinking into a cruel, hedonistic existence. Diving deeper into a life of vanity, the gifted portrait begins to reflect the consequences of his vanity, but just how far will Dorian go to save his lifestyle and physical appearance?\n\nOscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray now playing at Théâtre Le Ranelagh, is a play that has already attracted over 100,000 spectators and been presented at three Avignon Festivals. Interpreted with Thomas Le Douarec's remarkable staging, this show is a part of Théâtre Le Ranelagh’s classic series.\n\nHow far will one go to protect one's vanity? Dorian Gray gladly finds himself climbing the ladder of London socialites at an alarming rate, opening the door to a world of infinite pleasures he didn't know existed. When the love of his life commits suicide, however, things take a turn for the worse. While his whims know no bounds and his charms are felt by all, Dorian's treasured portrait begins to show the wear such a lifestyle can take on one's mind and body.\n\nThe epic tale by Oscar Wilde caused an uproar for its portrayal of Victorian aristocracy when first published and has undergone countless revisions, an ever-evolving and timeless piece! Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray has now become one of the greatest reflections on vanity, morality and the consequences of immortality known to man.\n\nHistory and Fun Facts about the Théâtre Le Ranelagh\n\nStep into the grand auditorium of the Théâtre Le Ranelagh, and prepare to be wowed by the ornate carved oak panelling adorning the orchestra and balconies, as well as the intricately decorated ceiling. Looking around you, it’s not hard to believe that this building is listed as one of Paris’ 'historical monuments'…\n\nThe Théâtre Le Ranelagh is tucked away in the heart of Paris’ 16th arrondissement, a few paces away from the Eiffel Tower on one side, and the bois de Boulogne on the other. It is built on the site of the old Château de Boulainvilliers, the estate was at the time right outside the city and covered 8 hectares (almost 12 football fields!). The theatre itself is rich in history and over 120 years old, after being converted to replace the château's music room by the landowner of the time into his own private venue where he could invite all the best-known actors and musicians in Paris to play there for him and his friends. After his death, the entire estate was destroyed to make way for the expanding city of Paris. All, that is, except for the theatre which was miraculously saved, and to this day still stands in its original spot! Don't be fooled by the unassuming exterior, once inside the Théâtre Le Ranelagh you can feast your eyes on its original decor of plush red velvet seating and carved oak panelling throughout.\n\nThe theatre is designed in the French style, meaning all of the seats are directly facing the stage and giving the auditorium a rectangular shape. The venue also features a small bar in its foyer complete with a fireplace and enough seating for up to 80 people, perfect for a drink before the performance.\n\nNot just a theatre…\n\nFor a time in the early 1900s, the theatre was used as a cinema, which was incredibly popular. The director of the world-famous film Les enfants du paradis loved the theatre, and often programmed the film to be screened there. The cinema tradition still exists at Le Ranelagh, and films are still screened there from time to time! In addition to film screenings and a show programme rich with plays by classic French playwrights, the Théâtre Le Ranelagh holds puppet shows for younger audiences and other community events.\n\nFast facts Capacity: 300 Handicap Accessible: Yes, please contact us to ensure proper seating in accessible areas Air conditioning: No Heating: Yes"
