        "text": "Do you know how to fix a brake light? What about how to memorize Shakespeare? How to keep a goldfish alive? Spot a shooting star? Write a love letter? Forgive someone?\n\nThese are just a few of the many skills explained in Tip, the how-to column by Malia Wollan which ran weekly in The New York Times Magazine from 2015-2022.\n\nInspired by this column, which took on topics both serious and silly, we are challenging students to write their own “how-to” for (almost) any task.\n\nAs long as the topic is appropriate for a family newspaper, students can explain whatever they like, including tasks that Tip has already taken on. But, just as the column did, they must also find, interview and quote one expert on the subject.\n\nTake a look at the full guidelines and related resources below. Please post any questions you have in the comments and we’ll answer you there, or write to us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com. And, consider hanging this PDF one-page announcement on your class bulletin board."
