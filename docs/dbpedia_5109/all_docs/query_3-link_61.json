        "text": "The Lede\n\nThe Russian Prisoner Who Didn’t Want to Be Freed\n\nThe opposition figure Ilya Yashin was part of the exchange that led to the release of Evan Gershkovich. Now, in Germany, he dreams of returning to his cell in Russia.\n\nInfinite Scroll\n\nPopping the Bubble of Noise-Cancelling Headphones\n\nA new Japanese-designed device promises to “unmute the world,” as if it were no longer possible to do so simply by uncovering your ears.\n\nQ. & A.\n\nThe Historical Forces Behind the Student Rebellion in Bangladesh\n\nThe country has long seesawed between two dynastic political parties, both with autocratic tendencies. Is the current youth-led movement charting a third path?\n\nCultural Comment\n\nIn “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,” Feeding Your Family Comes First\n\nFifty years on, the film reads like sociology: assembly lines make the working class deranged, technology makes them irrelevant, and unemployment makes them hungry.\n\nElon Musk’s Surging Political Activism\n\nThe X C.E.O. has been using his platform to sound off on topics including Venezuela’s election, Trump’s campaign, and racial violence in the U.K.\n\nCould Eric Adams Lose Next Year?\n\nThe hosts of a plugged-in New York City politics podcast wonder if the Mayor is really as weak as his political opponents believe.\n\nKamala Harris’s Youth-Vote Turnaround\n\nFor most of the year, young people seemed to be flocking to the Republican Party. Was Trump doing something right, or was Biden doing something very, very wrong?\n\nThe New Faces of Abortion Rights\n\nDemocrats used to talk about abortion in abstract terms. Now Harris campaign volunteers are getting specific and changing the debate.\n\nPersonal History\n\nDead Man Laughing\n\nJokes run through a family.\n\nProfiles\n\nAmerica’s Comic Prophet of Race\n\nRichard Pryor forced white audiences to follow him into his own, Black experience.\n\nDept. of Humor\n\nIn Search of the World’s Funniest Joke\n\nThe semi-serious science of why we laugh.\n\nThe Air\n\nHow “Saturday Night Live” Breaks the Mold\n\nNBC’s new sketch show is in opposition to the rituals of mass-entertainment television.\n\nThe Front Row\n\n“It Ends with Us” Showcases Blake Lively’s Wry Grandeur\n\nThis romantic adaptation of a novel by Colleen Hoover, about a businesswoman confronting a legacy of abuse, channels the moods and styles of Hollywood melodramas.\n\nOn Television\n\n“House of the Dragon” Still Hasn’t Caught Fire\n\nThe HBO show’s latest season finale reaffirms Rhaenyra’s right to rule—but her mode of noble restraint, however admirable in a leader, is lethal in a protagonist.\n\nCultural Comment\n\nHow “The Boyfriend” Distills Gay Romance\n\nThe Japanese dating show captures friendship, heartbreak, and the perils of having a hot roommate.\n\nMusical Events\n\nTwo Centuries Later, a Female Composer Is Rediscovered\n\nCarolina Uccelli’s opera “Anna di Resburgo” was remarkably inventive—but it vanished after its première. Teatro Nuovo has brought it back to life.\n\nBooks\n\nDeals with the Devil Aren’t What They Used to Be\n\nTales of Faust’s bargain teased and consoled an earlier culture with the lure of freedom, the promise of a wider world. But Hell is everywhere now.\n\nThe Art World\n\nThe Bad Dream of Surrealism\n\nA hundred years ago, the movement hoped to topple reality and reason. Its true achievements lie elsewhere.\n\nTwo Paths for Jewish Politics\n\nIn America, Jews pioneered a way of life that didn’t rely on the whims of the powerful. Now it’s under threat.\n\nHow a Rare Disorder Makes People See Monsters\n\nA mysterious neurological condition makes faces look grotesque—and sheds new light on the inner workings of the brain.\n\nShould We Abolish Prisons?\n\nOur carceral system is characterized by frequent brutality and ingrained indifference. Finding a better way requires that we freely imagine alternatives.\n\nHow Christian Fundamentalism Was Born Again\n\nNearly a century ago, a single trial seemed to shatter the movement’s place in America. It’s returned in a new form—but for old reasons."
