Correspondent Anthony Mason visits Malone in Nashville to talk about his acceptance among country music fans; how he dealt with being called a \"one-hit wonder\" following his debut with the 2015 hip hop smash \"White Iverson\"; and how he recovered from a downward spiral that he experienced in the midst of his success.\n\n07:49\n\nCrocheting magical gifts for special patients\n\nHolly Christensen, a former oncology nurse, saw how much joy could be brought to young cancer patients and their families when she made a Rapunzel wig out of soft yarn for a friend's daughter undergoing chemotherapy.

Correspondent Serena Altschul reports.\n\n05:02\n\nSutton Foster & Carol Burnett: Musical comedy royalty\n\nIn 1959 an unknown named Carol Burnett burst onto the New York stage in the musical comedy \"Once Upon a Mattress.\" Now, two-time Tony-winning star Sutton Foster is recreating the role of Princess Winnifred, a princess in search of a suitable mate, in the new Broadway revival.
