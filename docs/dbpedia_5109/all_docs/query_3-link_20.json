        "text": "We offer free content in the form of audio podcasts for each of the seasons of Coffee Break French. In the audio podcasts you’ll be able to build your understanding of French and hear how words are pronounced. However, there’s no guidance on how the words are written. This is where the online course comes in. The course offers additional materials:\n\nfull versions of each audio lesson;\n\na video version of the lesson which allows you to see the “words on the screen” as you listen*;\n\nbonus audio content allowing you to consolidate your learning futher;\n\nlesson notes for Seasons 1-3 and transcripts for Season 4 and En Route.\n\nIf you’re serious about learning French we would suggest that you consider the online course to help you make faster progress with the lessons and build a deeper understanding of the language.\n\n*Please note that the video lessons currently feature only in Season 1 and 2 courses. We plan to add video versions of the Season 3 and 4 lessons soon.\n\nWe do not currently have an app version of Coffee Break French. In the past we have had problems with a group of developers who have stolen our content and published it within paid-for apps. These apps are not published by Coffee Break Languages. We’ve written extensively about this situation on our website. Please do not purchase our content through these apps. The only way to access Coffee Break French lesson notes, bonus audio and video versions is through the Coffee Break Academy.\n\nThe Coffee Break French Masterclass is a special 6-month course which normally runs twice a year. This is a guided course in which intermediate learners can build their confidence and understanding of grammar in a structured way. We provide individual feedback on homework activities, and the course features six modules covering a range of topics. To find out when the next Masterclass is running, click here."
