Embed it with the feed ID in the shortcode: [instagram-feed feed=3]\n\nYou can display as many different Instagram feeds as you like, on either the same page or on different pages, by just using the shortcode options and the assigned feed ID below. For example:\n\n[instagram-feed feed=1]\n\n[instagram-feed feed=2]\n\n[instagram-feed feed=3]\n\nSetting up the Free Instagram Feed WordPress Plugin\n\n1) Once you’ve installed the Instagram Feed plugin click on the Instagram Feed item in your WordPress menu\n\n2) Follow the onboarding steps to connect an account and create your first feed.\n\n3) Customize your feed with tons of settings and options to display it just how you would like.\n\n4) Once you’ve customized your feed, copy the [instagram-feed feed=1] shortcode.\n\n5) Paste it into any page, post or widget where you want the feed to appear. Alternatively, use our handy block to add it to a page.\n\n6) You can use our handy Instagram Feed widget to display a feed in a sidebar or other widget area.\n\nFAQ\n\nCan I display multiple Instagram feeds on my site or on the same page?\n\nYep. You can display multiple Instagram feeds by using our built-in feed creation tool, for example: [instagram-feed feed=2].\n\nCan I display photos from more than one Instagram account in one single feed?\n\nYep. You can connect multiple accounts and include them as sources when creating a feed.\n\nDoes the plugin work with Instagram oEmbeds?\n\nYes. In version 2.5, support was added to allow the plugin to power your Instagram oEmbeds as official support for these is no longer available in WordPress core. Just connect your account on the oEmbeds settings page inside the plugin and we’ll do the rest. No developer app or account required.\n\nCan I display a feed with in a widget or with a block?\n\nYes. Use the Instagram widget or Instagram block to display your feed in a sidebar or other widget area.\n\nHow do I connect my Instagram account?\n\nWe’ve made it super easy. Just follow the steps outlined when onboarding and you will have a connected account with simple clicks.\n\nMy feed isn’t displaying. Why not!?\n\nThere are a few common reasons for this:\n\nYour Access Token may not be valid. Try clicking on the blue Instagram login button on the plugin’s Settings page again and copy and paste the Instagram token it gives you into the plugin’s Access Token field.\n\nThe plugin’s JavaScript file isn’t included in your page. This is most likely because your WordPress theme is missing the WordPress wp_footer function which is required for plugins to be able to add their JavaScript files to your page. You can fix this by opening your theme’s footer.php file and adding the following directly before the closing tag between two php tags: wp_footer();\n\nYour website may contain a JavaScript error which is preventing JavaScript from running. The plugin uses JavaScript to load the Instagram photos into your page and so needs JavaScript to be running in order to work. You would need to remove any existing JavaScript errors on your website for the plugin to be able to load in your feed.\n\nIf you’re still having an issue displaying your feed then please open a ticket in the Support forum with a link to the page where you’re trying to display the Instagram feed and, if possible, a link to your Instagram account.\n\nAre there any security issues with using an Access Token on my site?\n\nNope. The Access Token used in the plugin is a “read only” token, which means that it could never be used maliciously to manipulate your account.\n\nCan I view the full-size photos or play Instagram videos directly on my website?\n\nThis is a feature of the Pro version of the plugin, which allows you to view the photos in a pop-up lightbox, support videos, display captions, display photos by hashtag + more!\n\nHow do I embed my feed directly into a WordPress page template?\n\nYou can embed your feed directly into a template file by using the WordPress do_shortcode function: <?php echo do_shortcode('[instagram-feed]'); ?>.\n\nMy Feed Stopped Working – All I see is a Loading Symbol\n\nIf your Instagram photos aren’t loading and all your see is a loading symbol then there are a few common reasons:\n\n1) There’s an issue with the Instagram Access Token that you are using\n\nYou can obtain a new access token on the Instagram Feed Settings page by using the “connect” button to reconnect the account.\n\nOccasionally the connect button inside the plugin does not successfully update the access token. You can try this link as well.\n\n2) The plugin’s JavaScript file isn’t being included in your page\n\nThis is most likely because your WordPress theme is missing the WordPress wp_footer function which is required for plugins to be able to add their JavaScript files to your page. You can fix this by opening your theme’s footer.php file and adding the following directly before the closing tag:\n\n3) There’s a JavaScript error on your site which is preventing the plugin’s JavaScript file from running\n\nYou can find out whether this is the case by right clicking on your page, selecting ‘Inspect Element’, and then clicking on the ‘Console’ tab, or by selecting the ‘JavaScript Console’ option from your browser’s Developer Tools.\n\nIf a JavaScript error is occurring on your site then you’ll see it listed in red along with the JavaScript file which is causing it.\n\n4) The feed you are trying to display has no Instagram posts\n\nIf you are trying to display an Instagram feed that has no posts made to it, a loading symbol may be all that shows for the Instagram feed or nothing at all. Once you add an Instagram post the Instagram feed should display normally\n\n5) The shortcode you are using is incorrect\n\nYou may have an error in the Instagram Feed shortcode you are using or are missing a necessary argument.\n\nWhat are the available options that I can use to customize my feed?\n\nThere are plenty of options to customize your feed! See the list below:\n\n* General Options\n\n* width of feed – The width of your feed.\n\n* height of feed – The height of your feed.\n\n* background color – The background color of the feed.

Any hex color code\n\n* button text color – The text color of the button.\n\n* button text – The text used for the button – Example: “Load More Photos”\n\n*\n\n* ‘Follow on Instagram’ Button Options\n\n* show the follow button ** – Whether to show the ‘Follow on Instagram’ button.\n\n* **follow color – The background color of the ‘Follow on Instagram’ button.\n\n* follow text color – The text color of the ‘Follow on Instagram’ button.\n\n* follow text – The text used for the ‘Follow on Instagram’ button – Example: “Follow me”\n\nFor more options, check out the Pro version.\n\nFor more FAQs related to the Instagram Feed plugin please visit the FAQ section on our website.\n\nReviews\n\nLike the other Smash Balloon plugins, this app is very easy to use and does not affect the performance of your website at all.\n\nPrior, I was using a competitor’s plugin and really liked the free features, but they were limited in terms of the number of page views and other features. Smash Balloon’s Instagram feed gives me exactly what I wanted and it does it quickly. They’ve paid a lot of attention to performance, so adding this plugin doesn’t feel like you’re adding bloat or slowing down your site. Highly recommended!\n\nSo amazing but there’s some kind of API issue from Meta (I Think)and issues related to img optimizing or something.. Good plugin tho\n\nThe Plugin works well and has a lot to offer even in the free version! Recommended!\n\n1 reply\n\nI only need this to display a couple of Insta streams together on my website, works fine for that. It does seem to “forget” to access one stream or the other as time goes on, but its easy to restart.\n\nSehr zu empfehlen, und leicht einzurichten.
