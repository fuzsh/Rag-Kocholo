Time for us to go too, with Swiatek reunited with her trophy for the fourth time, and Jasmine Paolini beaten but smiling, and into the top ten.\n\nDaniel Harris will be back tomorrow to guide you through the men’s final between Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev. Have a lovely evening, bye!\n\nShare\n\nTumaini was courtside in Paris, and watched Iga Swiatek dominate on the way to her fourth French Open win:\n\nShare\n\nBoris again, this time on Paolini. “Something must have happened with her mind, with her brain. She’s a very good tennis player and now she believes she’s a very good tennis player.”\n\nPaolini leaves Paris the No. 7 ranked player in the world and with another chance of a trophy in the women’s doubles finals tomorrow, with her countrywoman Sarah Errani against the double act of Coco Gauff and Katerina Siniakova.\n\nShare\n\nIga Swiatek’s coach Tomasz Wiktorowski has been cornered with a microphone: \"I’m not sure if it helped [the match against Osaka] but it gave some perspective that it is not going to be easy. I’m just happy we are here today. Third win in a row, a very special place for her. Paolini surprised me in the beginning, playing very aggressive, behind the base line, on the base line, but then Iga found her tactics and everything went in the right direction.”\n\nBoris Becker has appeared, in a very pressed shirt, maybe it was one match too many for Paolini, he muses. She was pushed away from the baseline. All the women know that the only chance you have to beat Iga is to hit the ball very hard, but it wasn’t going to work for Paolini – as she can’t hit the ball so hard.\n\nShare\n\nIga Swiatek\n\n“Congratulations for an amazing tournament Jasmine. I’m really impressed with how you’ve been playing, I think you can do so much, especially on clay... I want to thank my team my family, without them I wouldn’t be here. I want to thank everyone who makes this tournament possible, as Jasmine said. I love this place, I wait every year to come back here. I was almost out of the tournament this second round so thank you for cheering for me, has been a really emotional tournament. [to Jasmine Paolini]Good luck tomorrow.”\n\nTough for the players that – no Q and A to help them along, they’re just handed the microphone and left to get on with it.\n\nShare\n\nJasmine Paolini\n\n“Congratulatinos Iga – I think to play you here is the toughest challenge in this sport. I want to thank my team, my family everyone for believing in me, congratulations for everyone for making this tournament possible - has been the best days of my life - keep going, tomorrow I have the doubles final. Thanks Amelie [Mauresmo] this has been an unbelievable tournament. Has been a very intense 15 days, today was tough but I’m really proud of myself anyway.”\n\nShare\n\nPaolini gets a warm embrace from Navratilova and Evert as she collects her runner’s up plate, then Swiatek marches up for her turn, a hug, a kiss and then the trophy – in her hands for the third consecutive year and for the fourth time. She kisses the trophy, then stands for the national anthem.\n\nShare\n\nHere come the queens: Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova to present the trophy.\n\nShare\n\nThey have moved into action very quickly in Paris and we’re already at the presentation stage – here come the lines of ball boys and girls in their peach and orange shirts, then the lines men and women in pink, then the groundstaff (?) in navy shirts and shorts. Et maintenant, the trophies!\n\nShare\n\nSwiatek clambers up the seating to hug her friends and family, and checks out her phone sitting back down on the court. Paolini sits, pensive, staring into space, outclassed on the court but never gave up.\n\nShare\n\nSwiatek wins the French Open 6-1, 6-2.\n\nSwiatek 6-1, 6-2 Paolini Swiatek pauses, serving for the match. Paolini tries to take the offensive but goes wide with a backhand. Then a miss from Swiatek. Two huge smashes eventually defeat the scurrying Paolini but she is tenacious and pulls back to 30-30. Soon enough though, comes Championship point, and she collects with a beaut of a serve, and Paolini returns long. Swiatek falls to her knees, the youngest player to win four titles in the Open era. They shake hands and hug warmly at the net. What a player!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 16.28 CEST\n\n*Swiatek 5-1, 6-2 Paolini (*denotes next server) Paolini wins the first point of her serve, and goes 30-15 up when Swaitek nets. An uncharacteristic unforced error from Swiatek, then she wins the game with a killer forehand down the line! Gets on the board.\n\nShare\n\nSwiatek 5-0, 6-2 Paolini* (*denotes next server) Huge applause as Paolini hits a winner, a beautiful backhand volley at the net takes it to 30-30. Paolini allows herself a grin and the crowd bursts into applause – they want more than an hour of this! Lots of men in shades and baseball caps in the players’ area stroke their chins. Swiatek goes to game point with a cross-court winner and Paolini hits the net to hand her the game. Paolini must serve to stay in the match.\n\nShare\n\nSwiatek* 4-0, 6-2 Paolini (*denotes next server) Swiatek’s forehand is long to give Paolini a moment of breathing space at 15-0 on her own serve. But soon the Swiatek machine rolls back into action, prowling the court, long legs, dynamic cross court forehand winner. Paolini saves her first break point but Swiatek snatches the second with a double handed backhand cross court winner and shakes her fist in hunger for more. Paolini’s ninth consecutive lost game.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 16.12 CEST\n\nSwiatek 3-0, 6-2 Paolini* (*denotes next server) Swiatek on a different level and takes the game to love in the pinch of a moment.\n\nShare\n\n*Swiatek 2-0, 6-2 Paolini (*denotes next server) Paolini, lemon yellow skirt, lemon and white top, shakes her head as Swiatek goes to 15-40 on her serve. She saves the first break point with her first ace of the match (and grins ) and pulls things back to deuce when Swiatek hits long. Misses a game point and is broken after a wild forehand. Her seventh consecutive game lost.\n\nShare\n\nSwiatek 1-0, 6-2 Paolini* (*denotes next server) They sweep the court between sets, Paolini will be wanting to sweep away the memory of that first set, which she started so well but Swiatek grew to dominate. A lovely passing shot gives her the first point of the second set, but Swiatek wins the rest to take the game to 15. John McEnroe says Paolini needs to reach into her drop shot collection rather than try and beat Swiatek with pace.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 15.55 CEST\n\nSwiatek wins the first set 6-2\n\nSwiatek* 6-2 Paolini (*denotes next server) Serving to stay in the first set, Paolini goes 40--0 down after hitting the net, and then going long twice. For for the first time, as she collects a ball from the ball-boy, she shows a head shake of frustration. A killer forehand return and the set is Swiatek’s.\n\nShare\n\nSwiatek 5-2 Paolini* (*denotes next server) Swiatek slowly quickly reeling Paolini in – sending her hither and thither and powering up the pace. Paolini saves one first game point with a cross court forehand but loses the next.\n\nShare\n\nSwiatek* 4-2 Paolini (*denotes next server) The commentators wonder whether Paolini has the reservers to play at this level for three sets. Men dressed in cotton T-shirts that make up the Italian flag stand up and cheer but they can’t carry Paolini through her service game and she finishes with a double fault.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 15.43 CEST\n\nSwiatek 3-2 Paolini* (*denotes next server) A huge rally (25 shots) to start the game which Swiatek wins with a backhand cross-court winner to eventually beats the tenacious Paolini. Quickly has three break points but loses the first with another uncharacteristically wild forehand. Collects the game when Paolini goes long.\n\nShare\n\nSwiatek* 2-2 Paolini (*denotes next server) Swiatek in a tie-dye style dress soaks up the pressure and breaks back to love.\n\nShare\n\nSwiatek 1-2 Paolini* (*denotes next server) Paolini has the crowd on side, and a couple of unforced errors suggests it might be getting to Swiatek – going love 30 down on her own serve. A huge rally follows which Paolini sets up with drop shot. She has two break points, another mistake from Swiatek and all of a sudden Paolini has the early break!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 15.45 CEST\n\nSwiatek* 1-1 Paolini (*denotes next server) An excellent start from Paolini, moving confidently and hitting with purpose. Goes 40-0 up, but Swiatek drags it back to deuce and then to advantage with tenacity and a couple of huge cross court forehands. Paolini saves one break point and goes on to take the game when Swiatek hits long.\n\nShare\n\nSwiatek 1-0 Paolini* (*denotes next server) Swiatek wins the first two points, Paolini gets on the board with a backhand from the edge of the tramlines and down the line . Swiatek responds with an excellent serve. Two game points for Swiatek, she wins the second with an ace.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 15.20 CEST\n\nBig cheers for both players as they warm up, Swiatek in a white baseball cap, Paolini’s pony tail bouncing perkily. “Iga Swiatek has never lost a Grand Slam final,” say the commentators, “Jasmine Paolini has never won one.” Swiatek to serve first.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 15.13 CEST\n\nThree minutes left of warm-up on Court Philippe Chatrier. There is very little wind today to complement the cloudless skies.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 15.14 CEST\n\nIn a victory for little women everywhere, Paolini is only five foot four, while Swiatek stands at five feet nine.\n\nTim Henman is analysing the Paolini game. “Her return of serve is going to be critical today. Against Rybakina, her return point was extremely varied and she gets the ball deep, neutralising the serve.”\n\nAnd here come the players, Paolini bouncy and smiling, Swiatek in headphones and also smiling.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 15.09 CEST\n\nWith the sun out in Paris and the players due on court in less than ten minutes, here is Tumaini’s preview:\n\nShare\n\nHead to heads\n\nSwiatek and Paolini have met twice in the past, Swaitek winning both games. Swiatek, aged just 17, won 6-2, 6-1 in a 2018 Czech ITF challenger and in 2022 won 6-3, 6-0 en route to the US Open title.\n\nShare\n\nA late bloomer: Jasmine Paolini\n\nIt seems outrageous to call a 28 year old sapling a late bloomer but, in tennis terms, Paolini is. Up until the beginning of this year, she had only won four Grand Slam matches from a total of 16.\n\n2024, however, has seen something of a turnaround. She reached the fourth round of the Australian Open, danced in the top 20 after winning the WTA 1000 Dubai Tennis Championship and has now clawed her way into the French Open Final. “ To dream,” she told the crowd after winning her semi-final, “is the most important thing in sport.”\n\nTrivia fact – both finalists speak Polish, as Paolini’s mother has Polish heritage and spoke Polish to her at home.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 14.43 CEST\n\nEyes on Swiatek\n\nAt just 23, Swiatek has played in four Grand Slam finals – and won all of them. She was triumphant at the US Open in 2022 and at Roland-Garros in 2020, 2022 and 2023. And has won 20 consecutive matches on the Paris clay.\n\nLindsay Davenport was pretty blunt on the Tennis Channel: “Iga Swiatek is as big a favorite as you could possibly be in a Grand Slam final.\n\nNaomi Osaka did test her properly in the third round, losing 7-6, 1-6, 7-5, something to give a glimmer of hope to Paolini. Here is Tuamaini Carayol’s report of that game:\n\nShare\n\nPreamble\n\nGood afternoon! Welcome to our coverage of the women’s singles final between Iga Swiatek and Jasmine Paolini in Paris. The No. 1 seed’s arrival in the final is no surprise – the queen of clay has been in majestic form since coming back from match point against Naomi Osaka in the third round, and is now on course to become only the third woman to win three successive French titles in the open era – after Justine Henin. and Monica Seles\n\nPaolini’s position the other side of the net is more of an eye-opener, having never previously gone beyond the second round in Paris. At 28, she is finally finding her wings. Can she overturn the odds and defeat Swiatek? We will find out soon.\n\nPlay starts at 2pm BST.\n\nShare"
