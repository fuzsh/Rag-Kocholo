        "text": "I’ve been waiting to sit down and put this together for a long time. A little bit of back story is required, I think, before I set out on a vain attempt to break down this brilliant movie, The Big Lebowski. You’ll pardon my use of the word “brilliant,” a wholly overused adjective, but fuck it, it is the parlance of our time. Also, in this case, I don’t think it is misused.\n\nThe first time I watched The Big Lebowski I didn’t really know what to think. I don’t remember when I saw it, but I was perhaps too immature to understand it. On my second viewing some years later, I was far more learned and empathetic to the plight of man. On my second viewing I laughed. I marvelled at the comic genius of what I was seeing. I fell in love with movie. I watched it multiple times in the months that followed, usually accompanying a good old fashioned toke.\n\nSo what I try to present here is my take on this movie. I have read some very good analyses on this movie, and I don’t claim that either of them or my own is the correct one. This is what I felt; one explanation that gave meaning and context to the madness that was occurring on screen, straight from the beautiful minds of the Coen brothers.\n\nI shall try and reserve my praise for the movie to this much, because I’m sure I could go on for pages about it, and I’m sure everyone else already has. Let’s keep it at that.\n\n…\n\nSo as I was watching the story unfold, the individual characters started to take the shapes of certain institutions or societal elements (or in certain cases, characteristics of an individual), all of which converged on The Dude thereby seriously upsetting the balance of his life. And make no mistake about it, The Dude is the most balanced character in the film, with the possible exception of The Stranger, but I’m not sure he warrants the same frame of judgement as other characters, and I’ll get into why through the course of this article.\n\nThe Dude is essentially a good human being caught unwittingly (though also kind of wittingly through his own actions) in a war that is not his own.\n\nThe inferences I draw are not out of thin air, but backed by the story, plot visual language and other elements, sets and props- of course, all of it is as interpreted by me, so feel free to disagree. It is an interpretation, so certain explanations I give for certain things may in fact be incidental or in actuality just plain wrong.\n\n…\n\nThis movie, like other Coen brothers movies I later found out, has a heavy spiritual subtext to it. Of course, in other movies by the Coens, it’s not so much sub as it is right in your face. But TBL tells the story of an ordinary guy caught in a battle between forces far greater than himself, and he doesn’t quite know how. But he does land right in the middle of the crossfire.\n\nSo what are these institutions/societal elements the various characters depict?\n\nThe Big Lebowski: The False Church\n\nJesus Quintana: An extension of the False Church\n\nMaude Lebowski: The True Church (The Pagan Church) (and also the Intelligentsia)\n\nBrandt: The ambitious college graduate\n\nThe Nihilists: Terrorists\n\nJackie Treehorn: The Devil\n\nThe Stranger: Guardian Angel\n\nMalibu Chief of Police: The State (or The Law)\n\nWalter: Hubris, anger\n\nDonny: Ignorance, innocence\n\nThe Dude: The everyman\n\nAnd before I get into how The Dude- or any one of us- fits into all this, I must painstakingly try and justify my claims above by really diving into it. So, in not necessarily the above order, here we go.\n\nThe Big Lebowski: The False Church\n\nI think it’s only natural that I should start with the titular character. The Big Lebowski is a corpulent figure devoid of the use of his legs who is too caught up in his own holiness to bother about the plight of a dirty, old, unemployed man. He is quick to praise his own self and his achievements. Hell, he’s got an entire wall dedicated to how great he is. He’s so caught up in his own self that when The Dude comes to him with an honest appeal he goes on “blathering” about irrelevant things, like how he has achieved in spite of the loss of his legs.\n\nThe Parallels\n\nBut then how does he come to represent the False Church? (Disclaimer: I’m not claiming that practitioners of any religion are right or wrong, I am only drawing on history. For a very brief and most rudimentary education on what I’m about to claim, simply read The Da Vinci Code). The Catholic Church went to great extents to establish its power and influence in the time after Christ’s death. The Church (or rather, some misguided practitioners) has a well-documented history of violence against those that opposed them, claiming they were doing God’s work. They stand today a monolith, an organization whose reach is vast and whose pockets are deep- very deep. Their houses of worship are grandiose and opulent, and their practitioners operate on the vain belief that only their interpretation of God is right, and it is only though them that one’s soul can be saved and reach the eternal paradise or else be relegated to eternal damnation.\n\nThe signs are there. Lebowski’s house is full of statues of angels in various positions that seem to be damning or remonstrative in nature. Whatever it is, they look very severe. We see it from the moment the Big Lebowski makes his entrance.\n\nWe see them when The Dude walks out of his office. We see it in his chambers when he invites The Dude back to his mansion.\n\nThe religion we know today is an amalgam of several pagan religions around that time (for example, Christmas coincides with the pagan celebration of the winter solstice). Catholicism incorporated many such attributes of several pagan religions to make the shift easier. This was done to surreptitiously “absorb” the pagan religions and establish their own religion as the dominant power- so in essence, it is not the real religion that it perhaps originally was. In parallel (which doesn’t mean similarly, so don’t lose your mind), the Big Lebowski is a fraud in this story. He projects himself as rich and successful, but towards the end of the movie we found he has very little wealth of his own. There is in fact very little that is real about him. He is a fake, a phony. What’s more, he cannot even stand on his own two legs, yet it is the appearance of power that allows him to lord over others, or at least allows him to think he can.\n\nSacrilegiously yours, The Big Lebowski\n\nThe Dude’s second visit to the Lebowski mansion is wholly hilarious. Notice the reverent way in which Brandt opens the doors to Lebowski’s chambers. We see Lebowski surrounded by more imposing angels and austere faces (check out the mean looking bust in the background, and there’s at least one more!). As the camera follows Dude’s entrance, we are treated to a view of the opulence of place. It is quite beautiful. There are high arches like in any church, and- are those crosses in the painting behind Dude?\n\nI doubt that’s been put there by the directors by chance. (And that’s not the only place of the Big Lebwoski where we see a cross- look at the seat in his limo. Yup, the logo of Lincoln).\n\nAnd the thing that gets me most is the dire music being played- Motzart’s Lacrimosa, a part of Requim– a Latin song about death and judgement. (This song was used to hilarious effect again in another Coens’ movie- Intolerable Cruelty). In fact, here’s the translated words of this particular movement:\n\nThat day of tears and mourning,\n\nwhen from the ashes shall arise,\n\nall humanity to be judged.\n\nSpare us by your mercy, Lord,\n\ngentle Lord Jesus,\n\ngrant them eternal rest. Amen.\n\nUsually [non-score] music in Coen brothers movies, especially this one, emits from a non-diegetic source. The music fills the chamber giving a sense of wonder and dread, or rather, such was Lebowski’s intent. The point is, it’s a very church like atmosphere- the opulence, the statues of angels, the Latin song about God and Jesus.\n\nAnother parallel to the Catholic Church plays out in Lebowski’s limo, when he is reprimanding the Dude for having lost his money. The church is known for doling out rather severe punishments for mortal sins. Lebowski too casts a damning and severe judgement upon the Dude, telling him quite ominously that any further harm brought upon Bunnie would come back TEN-FOLD to the Dude. That sounds pretty serious to me. Also, note his use of the word “irrepentably,” as if he is giving Dude no way out of his punishment. Plus there is the fact that the camera rapidly pans towards Lebowski to frame him alone as he passes the sentence. As Lebwoski begins after Dude receives the envelope with the toe, the camera is dollying towards Lebowski and Brandt, but as the sentence is handed down the camera suddenly whips to encompass only Lebowski in the frame.\n\nFinally we find out from Maude that the Big Lebowski has been bullshitting us this whole time. He wanted the kidnapping to be botched, and when the Dude confronts him about it he simply brushes the accusation under the rug and blithely puts the blame on the Dude. Ah, the sheer hypocrisy. This man exudes hypocrisy, and has been doing so from his first appearance in the movie. For all his talk about placing blame on others, he calmly tells dude that “he has his own version of events.” He has no real power. The Dude knows it, Walter knows it, and now we know it. And when we do find out, the False Church is- quite literally- cast down. Uprooted from his chair and disposed of. Again, literally. It is a hilarious scene, but a significant one in the grander metaphor. All the events of the movie lead to the tearing down of this Church, and the exultation of that other great Church, the True Church.\n\nWe didn’t see the Big Lebowski get all that was coming to him, but this humiliation was justice enough. Bear in mind that it is The Dude that picks him up- though this is not something shown on camera. The False Church has been torn down.\n\nJesus Quintana\n\nI think there’s a reason we never hear his name pronounced in contemporary fashion (hey-sous). He is referred to as Quintana, but he himself just calls himself Jesus. And you can’t fuck with the Jesus.\n\nI believe this is a further insult to The False Church. Quintana keeps telling Dude how he’s going to fuck them (in the bowling tournament), which sounds like a pretty heavy damnation. Like the Jesus of the Second Coming, his punishments and judgements are harsh and severe. He tells Walter at one point that he cannot hide behind his religion for long, that he will indeed get his. He reminds him that he would have destroyed him on Saturday, so he will simply have to wait till Wednesday to do the same. The “day of rest shit” was not going to prevent his doom for long.\n\nPlus there’s the whole paedophilia thing which I won’t get into here, but you can Google that stuff if you want. Maybe I’m stretching here, perhaps that was just put in there for comic purpose, and I would have let that go… except we only hear his name pronounced as Jesus, particularly that way every time, and never “hey-sous.” Maybe it’s just a joke, I don’t know.\n\nMaude Lebowski: The Pagan Church (and the Intellegentsia)\n\nOur first vision of Maude Lebowski is of her standing above the dude in his apartment. A strike from her henchman (I hesitate to use the word, because it’s a rather damning indictment, one better reserved for Treehorn’s thugs) sends Dude into a wonderful little fantasy as he chases this mysterious beauty as she makes away with his “new” rug.\n\nBut hey, she invites him to her house and apologizes. Maude is the truest character in the entire movie. She is the only one (except one other) who was actually after the truth and never lied or did anyone any wrong in the entire film. She is fair and just, and calls everything like it is. An incredibly strong, righteous woman.\n\nThe Parallels\n\nPagan religions worshipped the power of the female, a trait which is lost on today’s hegemonic society. Yet Maude is a feminist, and her house is a temple to all things female. The first time Dude enters Maude’s house we hear a strange chanting in a woman’s heavy voice. Then she comes flying down out of the dark like some creature. She’s definitely not ashamed of her form, as she’s suspended above the floor by her aides (is that better than henchmen?) and completely naked. She is lowered down by her companions and walks over to The Dude, going on about the female genitalia and her artwork which depicts it- another strong parallel with pagan religions.\n\nBesides notice how she is lit from underneath, as though there is some heavenly glow about her. And of course you’ll note how she’s very frank about sex and her affinity for it. As she’s walking away, her companions are standing though as they are on guard and just as they go off frame, do you see something that looks a little angelic? Only this image is alive and doesn’t seem to be admonishing anyone.\n\nThe Pagan Temple and its High Priestess\n\nNow look around the house (which indeed is a veritable temple to the divine feminine!). There are art pieces all over the house (which also doubles as a studio) dedicated to the female form. Another reason I believe this is the True Church- the image for “real Hell” comes from this Church. Notice the painting of the giant scissors on a red background with which the dude is clearly framed along with. This comes back to haunt him in a nightmare later (I’ll get into “real” and “fake” Hell in the Jackie Treehorn part).\n\nAnd the biggest parallel is her quest for the creation of life, which she gets done but without disregarding the act that led to it. I’m sure she enjoyed that too, in spite of her claim that it wasn’t all fun and games (of course this much is speculation on my part). In either case, it is towards her that Dude gravitates to and in fact fulfils his purpose in “the great human comedy” and perpetuates life. We’ll get into this a little later though. In whatever case, Dude chooses the True Church in the end.\n\nNow let’s come to this other characteristics of Maude. She is clearly highly educated and there is a great elegance about the way the does things, a great refinement. This refinement is genuine, as it doesn’t break nor is it challenged at any point in the film. Even her vocabulary is refined and she often finds it necessary to put things in a simpler manner, just in case her point was missed, in the “parlance of the times.”\n\nNote that she only wants what’s right, and at the same time she doesn’t want her father to be crucified for his actions for whatever her reasons may be. She is extremely level headed, even if she does ask Dude to do what she must surely think is a dangerous task. She wants to restore balance, and she is the only one who doesn’t lie in the film, even if she sometimes fails to tell the whole truth, as in the case with the doctor and his true purpose.\n\nThe Intelligentsia\n\nShe is definitely the most intelligent main character in the movie with (quite possibly) the Dude in second (more than quite possibly) some distance behind her. Of course, sometimes the really intelligent people get up to some weird things. You know, that crowd [artsy-fartsy] that goes to these art shows and blathers on about things that don’t necessarily make sense. It’s beyond the comprehension of the bourgeois public. Take her friendship with the infinitely strange Knox Harrington, the “video” artist. Ask yourself who the hell calls themselves a “video artist,” and you’ll understand what we are dealing with here.\n\nKnox completely bamboozles the Dude. “Who is this guy?” he asks repeatedly. Yet the truly bamboozling part is when Maude joins in the madness. She clearly understands what he’s all about and shares in some joke that is going on with someone over the phone. Maude, Knox, and presumably the person on the phone are left in splits (as is the audience) while the Dude looks on, perplexed and confused.\n\nJackie Treehorn: The Devil\n\nWe hear a lot about Jackie Treehorn throughout the movie, yet he’s only on screen for a few minutes. Needless to say, he owns those few minutes.\n\nWe don’t know much about him early on, except that he’s really rich, and he has muscle-head thugs to do his bidding, like some minions. His name has indicates the man has “horns.” He is some mysterious entity, and that’s all we know.\n\nThe Devil Liveth Large\n\nWhen we see Treehorn’s house, we see that it is a different kind of opulence than that of the Big Lebowski. While Lebowski’s opulence is obvious and grand, Treehorn’s is warmer and more welcoming- a little, idyllic beach full of beautiful, young, naked people having a good time. Even his manner is endearing. He is welcoming, charming, he even calls Dude by his preferred moniker. It’s almost as though he is trying to seduce and trap Dude for something worse, which is the kind of trickery The Devil usually employs in the stories about him.\n\nJackie Treehorn’s entrance is- and it’s a shame I can’t put as much emphasis into this word through type than I wish to- memorable. The music playing is “Ataypura” by Yma Sumac overlayed with chanting men all of which gives the feel of some voodoo ritual going on, some kind of black magic. Truly it is the scene from some hellish island paradise (I’ll examine the scene closely in the next section, “Real and Fake Hell”). The camera angles down from a long range shot of this scene, and Jackie Treehorn seems to materialize in the darkness at the bottom of the screen. The movements are in slow motion, but the speed increases exponentially to real time as Treehorn gradually comes into full light and occupies the entire frame, with his startling and terrifying presence.\n\nWow! It is truly mesmerizing. The bright red shirt, the fire just behind him… the Coens truly give the Devil his due.\n\nHis house is a “swanky” place, not like the austere mansion of the Big Lebowski. The uber-sexy sound of “Lujon” plays while he talks to Dude inside. It is a house built by peddling smut, don’t forget. As classy a guy as Treehorn likes to present himself, he’s still a sleaze ball.\n\nCharming as a Snake (only as long as he needs to be)\n\nInterestingly, Dude is never really interested in Treehorn, even if he is impressed with the house. But Treehorn is willing to be a gracious host as long as he has Dude where he wants him. And we can see Treehorn as an imposing but not altogether threatening presence on camera, often shown standing in a non-menacing way. But when Dude tells him what he doesn’t want to hear (which incidentally is what The Dude thinks is the truth), we see Treehorn’s demeanour change. Suddenly he is surrounded by “blue flames” (the reflection of light off of the pool), whereas he was always against a calm, white background in the previous shots.The camera angle is lower, and he looks threatening, menacing, and imposing. He is angry and the façade has been dropped.\n\nThe Devil takes off his mask to show his true face and sends Dude into a drug fuelled dream while his minions proceed to tear apart Dude’s apartment in search of the money (which we know isn’t there). Had Dude not tried to cut a deal with The Devil, this may not have happened. But Dude got a little greedy, and like every other point in the film where he strayed from the moral path, he got screwed.\n\nReal Hell and Fake Hell and The Dude’s Vision of Heaven\n\nIn stories where the Devil is usually trying to get someone to sell their soul, the victim often sees two Hells. In the first version before the deal takes place, Hell seems to be a great place with lots of beautiful people and partying. Once the deal is done, the hapless victim is presented with a terrible Hell full of terrible things. The former is fake Hell, and the latter is obviously what Hell really is. Think of Bedazzled, the original or the remake.\n\nFake Hell\n\nTreehorn’s beachside party is reminiscent of the former. It is indeed a party with a lot of young, beautiful people having a lot of fun. The opening shot is a pretty woman floating in the air in slow motion, her upward motion matched by her bountiful, exposed breasts. Quite a seductive sight. She is being hoisted into the air on a trampoline of sorts by men who seem to be worshipping the sight before them in what seems to be a ritualistic way (look at the face of the one man who is shown on camera and his expression of rapturous emotion).\n\nThe music too lends this eerie feeling of some voodoo rite going on. It’s a very funny, old school take on this concept- the entire combination of the scenario and music make it so.\n\nDude’s Heaven\n\nOnce Dude is drugged and slips into a chemically fuelled dream, we see what heaven probably looks like to him. It is some kind of cosmic bowling alley where he is the king roller. Waiting for him before the lane is- surrounded by dancing bowling pin ladies (I don’t know what they are called)- Maude, dressed like some heroic Norse figure which also lends a “holy” tinge to the place.\n\nIt’s a simple version of heaven, really. Maude and bowling. The Dude is indeed a simple guy. The fact that this bowling lane is in space also lends a heavenly feel to this place. This is also one of my favourite dream sequences of all time, and one of the funniest I’ve ever seen.\n\nReal Hell\n\nBut once Dude goes over the edge of that lane, he falls into a deep, dark pit. It was the end of the abyss that “had no bottom,” as The Stranger said. And there he confronts real Hell. There are no beautiful naked women here. The bare-chested woman we saw being hoisted in the air is seen once, descending, but this time wearing red panties. And abruptly from the side of the screen bursts another red-clad figure. We see German nihilists in red spandex wielding giant scissors to cut Dude’s johnson off.\n\nThe music is slightly nightmarish too (while at the same time being kind of comedic). Remember that this image has its origins in Maude’s house, the Pagan Temple and True Church- another reason that I maintain that this is the version of real Hell. It’s terrifying, certainly to The Dude at least who is very worried about his penis. He escapes from this Hell, but it is a certainly a vision of the path he is heading down.\n\nThe Stranger: The Guardian Angel\n\nThe Stranger is in the form of a real cowboy. We are not sure as to where (and in fact when) he comes from, but he’s there right from the beginning, giving us an introduction to the story and The Dude.\n\nI hesitate to give him a holy status. After all, in his opening monologue he has presented himself as very human- American, in fact. But then, I’m just not too sure. How does he know everything about The Dude and what happens to him throughout the story? He does say that he saw the whole thing unfold. And then there’s a lot of other things about The Stranger that doesn’t make a whole lot of sense (see what I did there?). His entire character is anachronistic. Then his very mysterious entrance in the movie- he seems to just appear, both times. And there is also the fact that the Coens often have this archetype in their movies (something I hope to get into in another blog post).\n\nIt seems to me that The Stranger was always there, just looking over Dude’s shoulder, trying to gently prod him in the right direction. Bear with me on this one.\n\nWisdom and Guidance just when Dude needs it (though he doesn’t immediately heed it)\n\nThe Stranger essentially likes The Dude’s character and the way he lives- simple, without much attachment to worldly things. An epitome of simple living, high thinking. He tells Dude as much: “I like your style, Dude.” He goes on to give him some advice, and when Dude asks if it is an “Eastern thing,” The Stranger replies, “Far from it.” What I think he means by this is that what he told him is a human truth, and it doesn’t belong to the east or west. The movie is very secular, but still a spiritual one. In many ways, it is about The Dude’s spiritual journey. In fact, spirituality unfettered by religion is one of the themes in several of the Coens’ movies. While the characters may represent or draw from religious themes, the over-arching tropes are largely secular.\n\nBefore parting, The Stranger offers some humble advice. The Dude is a perfectly fine human being, even if other characters in the movie disagree, but perhaps he could do with a little less cursing. When Dude doesn’t take this advice, The Stranger politely excuses himself, just telling Dude to “take ‘er easy.” He’s not there to reprimand Dude or tell him what to do, he is only an observer and at most a guide. That sounds a lot like a guardian angel to me.\n\nThe Stranger comes back one more time at the end, after Dude had learned all the lessons his journey could teach him. In fact, it was just as Dude was repeating the advice given earlier to him by The Stranger: sometimes you eat the bar, sometimes the bar eats you.\n\nBut why watch The Dude?\n\nThe Stranger still has a few words for us at the end. He tells us the Dude is going to be alright, that things worked out pretty good for him. In actuality, Dude was right back where he started, minus Donny. But given the depths he had reached, it was a good place to be. Another thing I felt was sadness at the passing of Donny, and The Stranger particularly mentions this. It was surprising to me because I was just feeling that when he said the line previous to that, that it was a “pretty good story,” and it made him laugh. And then the camera glides off of him as he orders another sarsaparilla, almost as if he just fades into ether. I got the feeling like he would be there to watch over The Dude for a long time yet. Because as I will explain, The Dude is a very important character because he represents something bigger, not just the main character of the movie.\n\nThe Nihilists: Terrorists\n\nThe Nihilists are a very funny bunch of people, and I loved their performances. And whenever I see Peter Stormare on film, I just smile.\n\nThe Parallels\n\nSo what are the parallels with terrorists? Well first of all, they represent the major real danger in the movie, the source of any real potential violence. In their first appearance, one of them smashes things in Dude’s apartment with a cricket bat, and then Uli sicks a marmot on Dude in the tub. They proceed to threaten Dude with castration if they don’t get their money.\n\nA terrorist today is one who perpetuates violence in the name of some great “belief,” often religious or sometimes political. The question is, how can they claim to be doing God’s work and then inflicting pain and misery on fellow human beings? How can they claim to believe in something good and go and kill, maim, and inflict violence? It makes us question if they truly believe in anything at all- much like the Nihilists who time and again profess that “they believe in nothing.” And therein lies the irony. I should be calling them ironic terrorists.\n\nFor most of the movie we believe they are serious enough to cut off Bunnie’s toe. From the moment they are introduced (at the failed drop off) they hang over Dude as a constant threat. The Dude never knows when and where they might strike; his life is constantly in the balance. Or at least, his johnson is. This perhaps not only alludes to Nazis, but other extremists from regions of the world with which America was at war with at the time the movie takes place. But I like to think this is an allusion to terrorists of all kinds.\n\nJust a bunch of punks\n\nThey are certainly a frightening prospect, but in the end their true face is shown. They set fire to Dude’s car and demand the money. Of course by now we know there never was any hostage- the so called Nihilists had been faking it, they’re just big phonies. And then, in the most whiniest of tones, they say, “We don’t care, we still want the money Lebooooowski.” It’s almost a little pathetic. They are like children who have been told they can’t have change to go buy something from the ice-cream man. But when Walter finally decides to stand up to them, they are proven to be inept cowards. One of them is incapacitated with a bowling ball (only appropriate). In an especially ironic failed attack- given the bravado of his earlier threats- Uli drops his sword when he attacks Walter, and the tall one can’t fight at all but only make empty threats that he will fuck the Dude (“I fuck you! I fuck you!”) while jumping around like an idiot. He gets beaten down by a boom box.\n\nThe Nihilists are just a bunch of posers, creators of shitty Euro-trance music, and when they face opposition they crumble.\n\nMalibu Chief of Police: The State (or The Law)\n\nThe Chief only cares about “his beach community” and the rich people who live there. He keeps it quiet and safe and lets the residents pretty much do whatever they want, and in return I’m sure they keep him very well fed. Around these parts, he is the law. And he doesn’t look too kindly on anyone who would try and ruin the setup he has going on here. He’s only worried about the people who “draw water in this town.” According to him, Dude doesn’t draw shit.\n\nHis troopers pick Dude up as he is escaping Jackie Treehorn’s party. Treehorn presumably feeds them some cock-and-bull story about disturbing the peace, or perhaps he tells the Chief that Dude needs to be taken care of.\n\nThe Chief represents the State, or the Law. Hired officials that run things in order to keep the rich and powerful happy; they don’t give a shit about the proletariat at all (this theme- that of the State not giving a god damn about the common man and their everyday problems- was reflected in another hilarious Coens’ comedy, Burn After Reading). To the Chief, The Dude is just a misfit and belongs back with the rest of his misfit kind, not in his pristine beach community. He doesn’t like anything about Dude and doesn’t care one iota about him. He even looks the part, like an ultra-serious drill sergeant who doesn’t have the time or tolerance for an insubordinate.\n\nHe has a very small role to play in a film with a mostly spiritual undercurrent. After all, where does The State truly fit in in the grand struggle of every human being, between good and evil? But the message is received. The State is just another giant player in this game, and Dude is little more than collateral to him.\n\nBrandt: Ambitious But Stupid College Grad\n\nPhillip Seymour Hoffman deserves his due for this role. He plays it brilliantly and is consistently one of the funniest characters in the movie.\n\nHe serves at the pleasure of The Big Lebowski and caters to his every need. He is intelligent (or not stupid, at any rate), efficient, and obedient. He’s also extremely politically correct, and it’s very funny to watch him squirm when something non-politically-correct is said: like Bunnie’s sexual solicitation of Dude, Dude’s reference to Lebwoski as a cripple and his suggestion that Lebowski is a philanderer.\n\nBut he doesn’t really have a brain beyond that. I’m sure he’s a great aide to Lebowski, and he definitely has some ambition in helping him, and it’s quite possible he truly believes Lebowski is a great guy; but in his blind ambition, he doesn’t seem to think for himself. He’s got a good thing going for him and if he sticks with Lebowski then there are good things coming his way, or so he probably thinks.\n\nFirst of all, I truly don’t think he had any idea about Lebowski’s plans about intentionally botching the kidnapping. Let that be said.\n\nAmbitious and vain\n\nNow watch him in his first scene. He insists Dude inspect Lebowski’s many awards, but is very averse to him touching any of them. He shows physical discomfort when Dude does and his unfailingly polite manner almost breaks. With great (and genuine) pride he attempts to explain to Dude how Lebowski received the key to the city of Pasadena, but he doesn’t really even know why Lebowski got the key, and just kind of plays it off. He even looks down on Dude for his lack of a college education, though he doesn’t express it as vindictively as Lebowski himself does. The whole time while he is showing off the awards he is judging Dude, and it’s pretty clear through his interactions with The Dude that he looks down on him.\n\nNotice that he’s always preening himself. He’s very proud of himself and the fact that he’s working for The Big Lebowski.\n\nWhen Brandt takes Dude to see Lebowski in his chambers, he is extremely servile. Look at the reverent way in which he bows to open the doors. Then he is shown to be extremely sad while Lebowski briefs Dude on the situation, but he is immediately business-like when Lebowski commands him to hand Dude the note. Then he goes back to standing by like a robot, awaiting the next order. It’s as if he is sad because he knows that he is supposed to be sad, but he has no real idea why. He figures it’s just part of his job.\n\nAnother sweet irony\n\nBut it’s funny that in spite of his political correctness and other airs he is forced to talk like a regular guy. By referring to Dude as “Dude” his speech becomes startlingly accessible and even out of place for him. Just imagine his lines with “Dude” as a simple pronoun, “dude.” “Her life is in your hands, dude,” or “That did not occur to us, dude” or “Well dude, we just don’t know.” It sounds and feels amiss to a very great comic effect.\n\nWalter Sobchak: Hubris, Anger\n\nWalter is an angry man. He is all about drawing lines in the sand and is ever ready to combat. Its partially farcical, at least. He is a Vietnam vet, and he keeps bringing it up to offer an explanation to unrelated things. He puts up the front of a big man, but he’s actually a complete pushover for his ex-wife. He watches her dog while she goes off on a holiday with her boyfriend. He even stays his religious conversion which he did for her even though he doesn’t really have to. And I think that is why he externalizes this anger and pain by bringing Vietnam into everything. When he’s explaining to dude that the Pomeranian has papers, he seems almost overcome with anger at the ridiculousness of the situation: the dog has fucking papers, and he’s stuck watching the damn thing while his ex-wife is off screwing some other guy? That’s over the line, a line that he would most surely have drawn in the sand himself and which had been most unceremoniously and unforgivably crossed. But instead of confronting the source of this anger, he takes it out on Smokey (for example). His marriage is not in his control, but the bowling tournament is, and he guards it very dearly. To him, it means so much more than it does to The Dude. Walter is just unable to deal with things like a rational adult.\n\nSo he externalizes a lot of his anger. Note that things essentially go downhill for Dude as soon as he listens to Walter and seeks out The Big Lebowski to compensate him for his rug. He even says as much before The Stranger’s first appearance: “I could be sitting here with just pee stains on my rug.” Instead he had his life and genitals threatened, his house was subsequently torn apart and car destroyed, and he eventually lost Donny. It was when he listened to anger and hubris that it all went wrong.\n\nWalter seems to lack empathy. He asks of Dude that he be strong in these difficult times and keep a clear mind for the bowling tournament. He acts extremely selfishly when he is dismissive about the danger Dude is in, that he has essentially put him in (at one point he tells Dude he has to buck up, and even tells him his concerns are just stress related; even if it is true, it is stress that can be directly traced back to Walter’s actions, but Walter won’t accept responsibility). He is presumptuous in the way he refers to The Dude’s things as “our” things- our car, our money. Plus his solutions are often unfeasible, ridiculous, and dangerous (like his idea of finding out where the supposed kidnappers kept Bunnie: grab one of them and beat it out of him).\n\nWalter the character\n\nYet as a character, Walter is for some reason very important to Dude. Dude truly loves him, even if he is a god damn moron, because Walter is also a dear friend. Sure he gets you in trouble, he can be selfish and inconsiderate and insensitive, he is stubborn, bull-headed, has no regard for others, and is particularly mean to poor old Donny (though it’s more likely that he’s just masking his affection for him). But Walter is also the friend who at the end of the day when things have gone as wrong as they possibly can will hug you and simply say, “Hey, fuck it dude. Let’s go bowling.”\n\nDonny: Ignorance, innocence\n\nDonny is just a really sweet, soft-spoken guy that never wanted to hurt anyone and who probably deserved better friends. He spends most of the movie being seemingly ignored by Dude (I think Dude directly addresses Donny in only one scene) or being told to shut the fuck up by Walter.\n\nBut Donny is a little out of it. He never seems to completely have a grasp on what is going on. He is largely ignorant of the things happening around him. In Quintana’s scene when Dude and Walter are regarding him with apprehension, Donny just turns around and is a little confused (and looks dazed even) at what is going on. When Dude is talking about Lenin he mistakes it for (John) Lennon and quotes “I Am The Walrus.” But perhaps the most visual clue that Donny isn’t quite all there is in the scene in the bowling alley where our three heroes are sitting at the bar. Note that behind Dude’s and Walter’s heads there is a full set of pins, but the lane behind Donny’s head is out of service, empty. Perhaps he’s not playing with a full deck.\n\nDonny is ignorant, but he himself is largely harmless. He never hurts anyone or brings anyone to harm (unlike Walter who although may have a full set of pins in his head is still a god damn moron). But we love Donny, because he is also very innocent; the most innocent character in the movie. And he is the friend that Dude and Walter should have been protecting. But like in most wars, it is the innocent who ends up the real casualty. And so it was with Donny. Instead of protecting Donny, Walter got caught up in a self-righteous battle. As a result, Donny’s weak heart couldn’t take it and he died, and he was the only one in the movie to do so.\n\nDonny’s death is symbolic of the loss of innocence. The Dude went through a great struggle and when he came out on the other side, he was not the same. A little piece of him would definitely be gone forever, or at least changed.\n\nI felt really bad when Donny died, and The Stranger felt the same way, as did everyone else. It was the one point in the movie where we could say “shit got real.” Suddenly things stopped being funny and we became well aware of the consequences of anger, hubris, lies, deception, and greed. It was an extremely poignant moment. And hell, after all that it was Walter who came to Donny’s aid and held him as he (presumably) drew his last.\n\nThe Dude: The Everyman\n\nWhat’s in a name?\n\nWhy do I consider Dude the “everyman?”\n\nFirst of all, it’s all in the name. Think about how we use the word “dude” today: it is a common pronoun used to refer to any person. In fact, its usage has extended to cover a wide variety of expressions and interjections depending on tone and context, but largely it means “man,” “guy,” or more generally “person.” But for a word that is so commonly used even at the time of making of the film or the time the film is set in, it is only used as Dude’s name in the whole movie.\n\nAnd for a better insight into what he represents, look no further than The Stranger’s affectionate introduction of him. In the midst of war and turmoil and all that, The Dude is still The Dude. He’s not a “hero” nor does he pretend to be. He is simply the man for his time and place. He fits right into society and doesn’t upset the balance. And sure, he is lazy. He’s not looking to change the world, or to change you, or me, or himself, or even his dim-witted friends. He just wants to be, and that’s not so bad, even if those who oppose him in the movie believe so.\n\nAn epitome of inner peace\n\nHe is the epitome of inner peace. And I think this is his most important attribute. Sure, you may not agree with his lifestyle, you may find him unambitious or even a waste of space. Dude has no identifiable source of income, his diet consists largely of White Russians, and he spends most of his time bowling. But he’s happy. He doesn’t hurt anyone, he doesn’t cause shenanigans- he just lives in a way that is suitable to him. He doesn’t seem to show any great attachment to worldly things or money that everyone else seems to love and be worried about. He didn’t even want to steal Lebowski’s money. He doesn’t even care about his external appearance, he just wears whatever’s lying around the house. There is something very Zen about him, and this manifests itself again and again (I use “Zen” not exactly in the literal sense, but as a metaphor for all that “Eastern” stuff about inner peace and denouncing materialism, etc.)\n\nYou will notice that he is absolutely the most balanced character in the movie. There is certainly a Zen-like quality about him. He performs a “ninja pose” here upon the rug that will prove to be the source of so much disquiet in his life. Even as he is performing this “balanced” position, his message player is recounting missed calls that should be giving him stress, such as Smokey complaining to the league, the league threatening his team with removal from the tournament, and several frantic calls from Brandt saying Lebowski needs to meet him. Even as he is literally surrounded by unbalancing elements, he remains calm and balanced in the face of it all, almost detached.\n\nIn The Dude’s conversation with Maude’s limo driver, he expounds this philosophy further. After telling the story of his woes to the friendly Italian driver and getting his advice to “fughetaboutit,” he agrees and replies “life goes on,” even though his life is in real danger. That is probably the ultimate peace one can attain- detachment in the face of harm. Eh, fuck it, come what may the important thing is there’s a beverage here and we’re having a good time. In the next scene, after this philosophical revelation, there seems to be an optical illusion at play (or so I think so). The light shining into Lebowski’s limo now seems to go underneath Dude, and the way he is sitting makes it appear as if he is cross-legged and floating like some fakir deep in meditation (ironic given the fact that he is breaking the peace in his life by blatantly lying in this scene, but it came after such a poignant philosophical moment and the “Eastern” connection is just too strong for me to ignore).\n\nIn contrast, Brandt’s and Lebowski’s defunct legs are shown, and we know both sets are firmly rooted to the floor of the limo. The Dude is essentially above things like money and possession and greed, except when he walks down that path everything goes bad (this thought is elaborated in a bit).\n\nA nice guy in a bad situation that he basically put himself in (but is far worse than he deserves)\n\nThe Dude is detached, but that doesn’t mean Dude is a complete waste. He may be a slob, but he is not an idiot, and he is not a pushover. He routinely speaks in a sarcastic way several times; to Treehorn’s thugs, to Police Chief Kohl, to the Nihilists, to Treehorn himself among others. Nor does he take any shit from The Big Lebowski. He is not afraid to tell him that his aggression will not stand, that he does indeed mind the whole rug pissing incident and will not be treated the way Lebowski saw fit to treat him. And he is the one to finally figure out Lebowski’s deception.\n\nThe Dude is essentially a good guy, probably one of the best in the movie. He is kind and peaceful. He scolds Walter for treating Smokey so harshly. He says he will attend his loser landlord’s pathetic performance, and he actually attends it, making Walter and Donny come too for whatever reason. I know it was probably so they could go to the Sellers’ immediately after, but still, he actually pays attention to the damn thing (incidentally one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen. Marty doesn’t even remember to take his watch off!).\n\nThe Dude never once whined or complained, even though he was subjected to several beatings; he was always quick to wave it off like it was nothing. He was even the one who told Walter to leave Lebowski alone before Walter threw him out of his wheelchair, and then was the one who picked him back up even though Lebowski was a massive asshole to him and put his life in serious danger. Besides that, he is flexible, comfortably imbibing things around him, incorporating phrases he hears elsewhere into his own speech.\n\nWhich is why it is only when he listens to Walter (anger, hubris) that things go downhill for him. Big time. Had he not heeded Walter’s advice to pursue Lebowski he truly could have been sitting at the bar of the bowling alley with just pee stains on his rug and not another care in the world. Listening to Walter upset the balance in his life. His attachment of importance to the rug- even if it did tie the room together- sent him down a spiral of unfortunate events that eventually ended up benefitting no one but in fact lost him a dear friend. He never truly shows any attachment to anything else throughout the movie- not the four dollars in his wallet he tries to give the Nihilists, not the floor of his apartment, not even the fabled bowling tournament that Walter obsesses over. It is the attachment to this one worldly, materialistic thing that sends his life into chaos.\n\nBut his heart is definitely in the right place. In the end, he kind of defeats the Nihilists (ok, so Walter did), casts down the False Church, and basically chooses the True Church and gets laid for his troubles. When The Stranger meets him the first time, he tells Dude that he is doing more or less just fine, in spite of the big trouble he is in. The Stranger even likes Dude’s style of thinking and living- not like a slob but like a peaceful, detached man. And remember, The Stranger doesn’t represent some Eastern or Western philosophy- his is a human philosophy.\n\nThe meaning of the movie and how The Dude fits in it\n\nThe story is about Dude’s spiritual journey, his great struggle. He literally (ok, maybe not literally) went to Hell, saw Heaven, fought with the Devil, and was touched by something angelic through the course of the movie.\n\nBut the story is about more than that. The Stranger says Dude is the man for his time and place. Dude gets caught in a convoluted war between powerful figures. Two great Churches, terrorists, the State, and even The Devil all converge on a battlefield called Los Angeles, and Dude was right in the centre of the whole thing. But he remains detached most of the time. Normal people are caught in a web of wars they will never see or truly understand. Big large companies, billionaires, powerful political and religious figures and institutions, nations, celebrities, secret societies- we never know where it all starts and where it all will end, if it ever does. We just go about our lives while these powers build pillars on our heads so that they can reach beyond the sky to whatever is up there. And as a rule, not all of us will make it. Some of us will struggle and try and fail. Yet some of us will live decent lives without ever having peeked our heads above the clouds to see what’s up there. Great power and mounds of money may never be ours, because the powers that be need to stand on our heads to reach them. Yet a lot of us will try in vain. And the world will keep manufacturing Brandts, brilliant people who may better serve humanity in other ways but instead choose to serve the Big Lebowskis of the world in search of great riches and renown for themselves (things The Dude cares nothing about).\n\nBut that’s no way to live. Is it truly fulfilling to live your whole life working to the bone only to be fed scraps at the great table of powerful people? The Dude shows us how the large majority of us should be living. Hell, he’s happy. Absolutely and unquestioningly. He loves his neighbour, he supports his friends, he’s a kind lover, and he has all he really needs. It comes back to what The Stranger said- it gives him comfort to think that The Dude is out there, “takin’ her easy for all us sinners,” which is more saviour-like than Quintana will ever be; and I don’t mean “saviour” in the Biblical sense, but more like the saviour of humanity. If the entire world tried to claw their way to this Pantheon that humans have built for themselves, we would destroy each other. The fact of the matter is the large majority of us have to let the powers stand on our heads so that we can lead decent, peaceful lives. We wouldn’t even know about all of it (all the machinations behind the curtain), but “that’s how the whole durned human comedy goes on perpetuating itself,” out into the future so that the human story will continue to carry on and be told generations hence. Because there isn’t a whole lot more happiness up in that Pantheon anyway, even if there is a lot of money and power. When The Stranger tells Dude to “take ‘er easy,” he is talking about his whole life and not just for the day, and what Dude replied gave The Stranger- and the audience- comfort: “The Dude abides.” Truly, he does abide by that rule.\n\nAnd even the final song that plays is an admission to this. The words of “Dead Flowers” (originally by The Rolling Stones, but this version by Townes Van Zandt) paint a picture of a woman the singer used to know who has done very well for herself while he is still in “ragged company.” The woman is just like the supposedly rich and powerful people in the movie who gave Dude nothing but shit, all they did was “send him dead flowers.” But Dude doesn’t hold grudges, he forgives and moves on. He was even the one to admonish Walter for throwing Lebowski out of his wheelchair. At the end, even after all the shit “high society” gives him, Dude will still “lay roses on their grave.”\n\nAnd a Little Dude is on his way into the world, someone who will carry his genes and perhaps even his message of peace into the world. And that is how whatever good there is in humanity is preserved and multiplied.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Dude may never have fulfilled his duty of propagating his kind if the events of the movie had not transpired. So perhaps there is a reason for everything after all.\n\nAt the end of the movie, Dude is just going on with his life as though nothing happened. He’ll never be a great success, but he’ll be happy. Better than being without your legs, or having to send thugs to destroy peoples’ houses, or being a leech on someone else.\n\nThat’s why this movie has such a hopeful ending. If we can just get our shit together then, like The Dude, we could be happy. We don’t have to be unemployed and live on White Russians and never pick up after ourselves, but we can still be happy. We can all abide, because we are all Dudes, and The Dude is all of us.\n\nAmen.\n\nParting shot: Oh, this is fun…\n\nInteresting. The enigmatic Knox Harrington is also Remus Lupin.\n\nAlso interesting. The dim-witted Blond Treehorn Thug is also the enigmatic Jacob, from LOST."
