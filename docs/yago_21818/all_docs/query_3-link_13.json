        "text": "The Erratics is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nâSetting is a literary element that refers to the context of where a story takes place, usually alluding to the time and location. Your expectations of a story that takes place in Victorian England would differ greatly from a story set in late 2000s Australia, showing us that the historical, social and geographical aspects of the setting shape the meaning of the text.\n\nIn the memoir The Erratics, the setting plays a vital role in Vicki Laveau-Harvie's storytelling. From the beginning of the novel, Laveau-Harvie uses both the title and prologue to foreground the importance of the Okotoks Erratic (a geographical phenomenon in Alberta, Canada) to establish the role that place and belonging have played in her life. Further reinforcing the importance of the setting, the memoirâs narrative follows Laveau-Harvieâs experience flying back to Alberta, Canada (her hometown), after having moved to and started a new life in Australia.Â\n\nWhy Focus on Setting When Writing a Text Response?\n\nThe setting can be useful evidence to have in your repertoire as it helps you show that you not only have an understanding of the ideas of the text but also how those ideas are constructed. When looking at the criteria you will be marked against in the end-of-year exam you will see that to score a 7 and above in Section A you need to consider the âconstructionâ of the text (read more here). Construction refers to your ability to discuss the parts that make up a text through the use of metalanguage as evidence to support your views. The setting is just one of the ways you can address construction in The Erratics, but, as a text so focused on physical environments, itâs a good type of metalanguage to start with.\n\nCanada\n\nFamous for producing Justin Bieber and maple syrup, Canada has a similar history to Australia. Canada has an Indigenous population who inhabited the land for thousands of years before British and French expeditions came and colonised the land. In the 1700s, due to various conflicts, France ceded most of its North American colonies while the United Kingdom stayed. Over time the country gained greater autonomy and, like Australia, it is now a constitutional monarchy with a prime minister but recognises the British royal family as its sovereign. Further mirroring Australia, Canada also has a colonial past that it is still reckoning with as recent headlines about the human remains of hundreds of Indigenous people at a residential school reminds us.Â\n\nVicki is specifically from Alberta, and the majority of the novel is about her experiences returning there after having moved to Australia (at the start of the memoir she had been estranged from her parents for 18 years). Known for its natural beauty and its nature reserves, Alberta is a part of Western Canada. Alberta is one of only two landlocked provinces in Canada which is interesting considering that Vicki leaves it for a country famous for its beaches and coastal cities.Â\n\nWhen annotating the text, highlight the descriptions of the setting. Youâll notice that whenÂ Laveau-Harvie describes Alberta or Canada as a whole she presents the country as being dangerous and hostile. An example of this is the blunt statement that the âcold will kill you. Nothing personalâ. However, Laveau-Harvie does find some solace in the landscape, observing the beauty of the âopalescentâ peaks and the comfort in predictable seasons.Â\n\nVickiâs Parentâs Home\n\nThe first description Laveau-Harvie gives us of her family home is to call it âParadise, [with] twenty acres with a ranch house on a rise, nothing between you and the sky and the distant mountains.â The idyllic image foregrounds the natural landscape but is then immediately juxtaposed with the description of the home as a âtime-capsule house sealed against the outside world for a decadeâ. This description heightens Vickiâs mother and fatherâs isolation from the outside world and alludes to the hostility of the home that is reaffirmed with the doors that âopen to no oneâ. The family home becomes an extended metaphor for Vickiâs parents themselves, with the description of it as a âno-go zoneâ, hinting at the sistersâ estrangement from their parents who have shut them out.Â\n\nMoreover, the land the house sits on does not produce any crops despite it being such a large expanse of land, heightening the homeâs disconnect from the natural world. This detachment from the natural world is furthered by her labelling her parents as âtransplants from the cityâ and contrasting them to locals who âstill make preserves in the summerâ. Vickiâs mother in particular is at odds with nature due to materialism, such as her wardrobes being full of fur coats.\n\nThe Erratics + Napi\n\nIn the prologue we are introduced to the Okotoks Erratic as being situated in âa landscape of uncommon beautyâ with the Erratic itself being something that âdominates the landscape, roped off and isolated, the danger it presents to anyone trespassing palpableâ. The memoir then immediately shifts to Vickiâs experience in the hospital trying to convince the staff that she is her motherâs daughter, drawing a parallel between the dominating and dangerous landscape to the dominating and dangerous mother. In the memoir, the Erratic is an extended metaphor for the mother with both the land and the mother being described as âunsafeâ, âdominat[ing]â and a âdangerâ. Moreover, the structural choice of opening the novel with the Erratic makes its presence felt throughout the novel even though it is not mentioned again until the end of the text.Â\n\nIn contrast to the prologue, the epilogue has a feeling of peace and reconciliation as the mother and what she has represented to her family is reconciled with the landscape. This is particularly pertinent as the geographical and spiritual origins of the rock revealed in the epilogue is a story of stability after a rupture. This alludes to the ability of Vickiâs family to heal after the trauma inflicted on them by the mother. The epilogue could also be understood as a reminder of humanity's insignificance in the face of nature and larger forces, as represented by Napi.\n\nWhile Laveau-Harvie does not directly address Canada's colonial past in her memoir outside of the inclusion of Napi, the colonial presence is felt throughout the memoir through the setting of both Australia and Canada. These settings allude to how living on stolen land means that while individuals - particularly middle-class, white individuals - may not always recognise and address the colonial history of the land they live on, the fact that land was never ceded is still felt.Â\n\nAustralia\n\nAs discussed before, Canada and Australia are similar as they are both former British colonies that are now constitutional monarchies, so why would Vicki want to move to a place that is similar to where she already lived and experienced trauma?Â\n\nThere are a few potential answers, the first being the geographical distance. There are over 1300kms between Sydney and Alberta and, considering the trauma Vicki and her sister have experienced, it stands to reason that she would want to put distance between her childhood home and her adult life. This leads to the second reason, travelling to âFar flung placesâ as a method to deal with trauma. While in Canada, Vicki reminisces about the âboozed-up Brits on Bondiâ that embodies her life in Australia. The evocative, alliterative image creates a stark contrast between warm and carefree Australia and cold and emotionally taxing Canada, reinforcing how travelling provides individuals with a means to survive their traumatic childhoods and create new lives for themselves.Â\n\nWhen writing about setting you do not need to be an expert in geography. As this blog post has shown, to understand Laveau-Harvieâs use of setting in The Erratics you only need to know about two countries, so next time you write a text response, consider using your understanding of setting to show your teacher or examiners that youâve thought about the textâs construction.\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into this text, Zac breaks down key themes and quotes in The Erratics over on this blog.\n\nWhether you revel in the ideas and intricacies of poetry or could not think of anything more monotonous to read, grab a tea (or coffee if itâs one of those nights), your favourite late-night snack, and prepare to be amazed by just how simple it is to absolutely NAIL a poetry essay.\n\nDonât worry, I know that same overwhelming feeling when poetry can seem as if itâs not even in English, but I can ensure you, learning how to write a poetry essay is like learning to ride a bikeâ¦. Once you wrap your head around it youâll be cruising!\n\nTo make these tips even more practical, weâll be focusing on John Donneâs poetry in relation to the topic below:â\n\nâDonneâs poetry explores the many aspects of human experience.â Discuss.\n\nâ\n\n1. Start off with a bang!\n\nIâm sure youâve heard it beforeâ¦ your introduction sets the tone for your essay and this could not be more true. A shallow introduction is like missing the start of your running race, or even worse arriving at a party just before it ends! Youâll just have so much catching up to do! Without being overly hyperbolic, here are a four essential tips that will ensure your assessor sees you as a high-scoring student right from your first sentence.\n\n- Answer the question in your first sentence (even if it is in a broad manner) and always link back to the essay topic â this will show the assessor that you are answering the question given rather than presenting them with a sneaky memorised essay!\n\n- Utilise the right terminology when outlining the type of poet and era they wrote in (i.e. metaphysical poet, Renaissance era, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth)\n\nâ\n\n- Outline the main poetic techniques for which the poet is known for (i.e. playful wit, rich imagery, language, challenging intellectual argument) as well as the ideas and values they endorse (i.e. elevation of reciprocal love, belief in the resurrection of Christ, celebration of eternal life)\n\n- Wow your assessor with unique vocab (i.e. illuminate, emanate, meditate)\n\nAnd hereâs a sample introduction to help you even more:\n\nJohn Donneâs anthology, âSelected Poetryâ illuminates the human condition and thus provides much commentary on life and death. A metaphysical poet of the Renaissance era, Donne combines a playful wit, rich imagery, and perhaps most importantly language, to challenge intellectual argument and celebrate various aspects of sexual desire, mutuality and faith. Immersed in the Christian traditions of his time, Donneâs exploration of Death emanates from the Elizabethan acute awareness of the brevity and vanity of human life; however, with his sensual elevation of reciprocal love and his deep spiritual belief in the resurrection of Christ, Donne meditates upon his belief and celebration of eternal life.\n\nâ\n\n2. Strong topic sentences are Crucial (with a capital C)\n\nâ\n\nTime and time again students fall into one of two traps. They either try to start each paragraph with a lengthy (and often beautiful) phrase trying to encapsulate every idea they plan to introduce in the paragraph. Or on other occasions, they have no introductory sentence and instead launch straight into their poetry analysis. Your assessor may be blown away with your A+ worthy introduction and then reach this weak opening to your paragraph and have to reconsider! Your topic sentence is the frame for the whole paragraph so please, keep it clear, succinct, and relevant to the essay question.\n\nHere are three âDOsâ and âDONâTsâ to consider when crafting one of the most important sentences of your essay (again, sorry about the drama!)\n\n- DONâT mention the poem you will use as evidence in your topic sentence\n\n- DO answer and link directly to the essay topic\n\n- DO use linking words to link the ideas in different paragraphs\n\nAnd here are three STRONG topic sentences for each paragraph of this essay (note how I always link back to the topic of human experiences and link ideas between paragraphs)\n\n- Rewriting the conventional trope, Donneâs oeuvre explores the joy of erotic love and onesâ lustful desire to engage in these sexual experiences.\n\n- While much of Donneâs oeuvre comments on the pleasure of carnal experiences, his more harmonious poems reveal the beauty of relationships in which one can experience a deep sense of mutuality and stability.\n\n- Silhouetted against the backdrop of the Elizabethan reign, Donneâs more metaphysical poems demonstrate the struggle of the process of dying and individual corruption, and the manner in which it leads to the acquirement of Godâs love and grace.\n\n3. Organise paragraphs by IDEAS\n\nâ\n\nWhat makes a poetry essay so unique is that your paragraphs are based on broad ideas rather than the motifs and behaviours of characters in novels. This means that when planning your essay you must ensure that each paragraph has only one idea and that each paragraph is based on a different idea. From there you can work out which poems best represent each concept to work out which poems you will use for each paragraph. This is why I love poetry essays as planning for them is so easy! All you have to do is think of three or four different ideas for the essay topic and then find your textual evidence by working out which poems best reflect these ideasâ¦. Simple! Right?\n\nHere are the three ideas that I plan to discuss in each of my paragraphs of this essay as well as the poems I would use:\n\n- Sexual/physical human experiences\n\n- âElegy 19: To His Mistress Going to Bedâ & âThe Fleaâ\n\n- Mutuality and reciprocity as an experience/element of spiritual love\n\n- âA Valediction: Forbidding Mourningâ\n\n- The innately human experience of dying and being embraced by God in heaven\n\n- âHymn to God My God in My Sicknessâ\n\nâ\n\n4. Analyse, not summarise\n\nâ\n\nIf there was one thing that was playing in my head over and over while writing a poetry essay it was âanalyse, not summariseâ. It is so easy to fall into the trap of simply summarising the poetic techniques and language of the different poems rather than analysing their meaning and linking this directly to the essay question. Even if you have the best plan and ideas going for you, if an assessor notices you going into summary mode theyâll assume youâre just rewriting a memorised essay rather then answering the exact essay question givenâ¦. DISASTROUS! To prevent this utter catastrophe, I urge you to please, link to and answer the specific essay topic EVERYTIME you introduce a new poetic technique/piece of evidence. Verbs such as demonstrates, elucidates, illustrates, exemplifies, illuminates and augments are âmust havesâ in your poetry tool-box as they will ensure that you are analysing not summarising.\n\nHere is a sample paragraph for you to consider (notice how I always link back to the idea of mutual/reciprocal love and experiences every time I introduce a new poetic technique or quote)\n\nWhile much of Donneâs oeuvre comments on the pleasure of carnal experiences, his more harmonious poems reveal the beauty of relationships in which one can experience a deep sense of mutuality and stability. The poem, ââA Valediction: Forbidding Mourningââ explores the sense of security and harmony which spiritual love and experiences permit. Adopting a hush, reverent tone manifested by the use of sibilance, through the enjambment of the phrase ââDull sublunary lovers love, / (Whose soul is sense) cannot admit / Absenceââ, Donne elevates mutual love to a higher plane, one that transcends the lines of poetry. When accompanied by the stability of the ABAB rhyme scheme that works to echo the coupleâs settled love, this presents the experience of reciprocity and mutuality of love to be higher than the dull and earthbound nature of love that is solely physical. Hence, Donne reveals the bliss that mutual love permits mankind, given it eclipses the desire for any form of physicality. Further elucidating the strength of mutual love, Donne illuminates how when couples are separated it is âânot yet a breach, but an expansionââ, thus celebrating the manner in which deep, reciprocal love not only eclipses the divisions of the clock but how it expands ââlike gold to airy thinness beatââ when separated. By connoting spiritual love to the pure and malleable nature of gold, this simile characterizes mutual love to be the prime of human experiences and relationships. Intertwining the elegant conceit of a compass to represent the love that connects the speaker and his mistress, Donne garners the notion that no matter how far ââone doth roamââ the intellectual bond between the couple will remain ââfirmââ and enable the pair to overcome any form of physical separation. Hence, Donne illuminates the complex and impermeable bond that this serene form of human experience can foster.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n5. Vocab and metalanguage are the easiest ways to SHINE\n\nâ\n\nTo say it plainly, writing with unique and refreshing vocabulary is enough to send your grade SOARING. It will not only render your ideas and discussion ever more complex, but has the power to enlighten and stimulate your assessor (and this is something we all want to doâ¦ right?). Utilising the correct poetic metalanguage every time you introduce a new quote or line of poetry will ensure that your analysis remains both specific and detailed. As seen in the paragraph above, discussing the poetic techniques provided me with another form of evidence (rather than just the quotes from the poem) to elucidate how these different forms of human experience are illustrated in each of Donneâs poems.\n\nTo assist you further, here is some metalanguage for the poetic techniques and structures that frequent John Donneâs poetry:\n\n- Sibilance, alliteration, imagery, paradox, conceit, metaphor, simile, personification, rhyme structure, tone, volta, enjambment, metre (i.e. iambic pentameter, trochaic tetrameter), monosyllabic phrasing\n\n- Stanza, verse, quatrain, cinquain\n\n6. Finish with a jaw-dropping conclusion\n\nA mediocre conclusion is like leaving your assessor with an unpleasant aftertaste that unfortunately, will not go away. So please, finally give your conclusion the attention it deserves and follow these five tips to ensure you leave your assessor waiting for that mic to drop!\n\n- Pan out to the broad, abstract ideas that the poet wrestled with\n\n- Discuss the aspects of the poet that set them apart from other poets at the time (i.e. for John Donne that is his intellectual imagery, arresting voice, wit, fusion of passion and logic and the manner in which he challenged intellectual argument and strongly held societal conventions)\n\n- Short and sweet not long and wordy!\n\n- Reinforce the period and society in which the poet wrote\n\n- You can include a secondary quote if you want, however only if it relevant to the essay topic and ideas you discussed\n\nHere is a sample conclusion to assist you:\n\nRailing against the societal value of religion prominent during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the originality of Donneâs ideas about love, death and God along with his strikingly intellectual imagery and rich language incite and interest his more religious readership of the joys of sexual, mutual and religious experiences. The poet and playwright Ben Jonson once wrote that John Donne ââwas the first poet in the world in some things.ââ Hence, it is through his witty and authentic form of expression that Donne allows us to reflect on and celebrate precisely what it means to be human.\n\nUpdated 30/12/2020\n\nContents\n\nWhat Are Quotes?\n\nWhy Use Quotes?\n\nWhat YouÂ Want To Quote\n\nHow Much You Want To Quote\n\nHow That Quote Will Fit into Your Essay\n\nThere Are Also Other Ways of Using Quotation Marks\n\nQuestions You Must Ask Yourself When Weaving Quotes into Sentences\n\nHow To Find Good Quotes\n\n1. What Are Quotes?\n\nQuotations, better known by their abbreviation âquotesâ, are a form of evidence used in VCE essays. Using quotations in essays helps to demonstrate your knowledge of the text, and provides solid evidence for your arguments. The discussion on quotations in this study guide can be applied to all three areas of study in the VCAA English course which have been explained in detail in our Ultimate Guides to VCE Text Response, Comparative andÂ Language Analysis.\n\nA quotation is the repetition of a group of words taken from a text by someone other than the original author. The punctuation mark used to indicate a repetition of another authorâs work is presented through quotation marks. These quotation marks are illustrated by inverted commas, either single inverted commas (â â) or double inverted commas (â â). There is no general rule in Australia regarding which type of inverted comma you must use for quotations. Single inverted commas are preferred in Australia as they follow the British standard. The American standard involves styling quotations with the double inverted comma. You can choose either style, just be consistent in your essays.\n\n2. Why Use Quotes?\n\nThe usage of quotations in essays demonstrates:\n\nYour knowledge of the text\n\nCredibility of your argument\n\nAn interesting and thoughtful essay\n\nThe strength of your writing skills.\n\nHowever, quotations must be used correctly, otherwise you risk (and these frequent mistakes will be discussed in detail later):\n\nIrrelevant quotations\n\nOvercrowding or overloading of quotations\n\nPlagiarism\n\nBroken sentences\n\nHow You Integrate a Quote into an Essay Depends on Three Factors:\n\nWhat you want to quote\n\nHow much you want to quote\n\nHow that quote will fit into your essay.\n\n3. What You Want To Quote\n\nAs you discuss ideas in a paragraph, quotes should be added to develop these ideas further. A quote should add insight into your argument; therefore, it is imperative that the quote you choose relates intrinsically to your discussion. This is dependent on which aspect of the text you are discussing, for example:\n\nDescription of theme or character\n\nDescription of event or setting\n\nDescription of a symbol or other literary technique\n\nNever quote just for the sake of quoting. Quotations canÂ be irrelevantÂ if a student merely adds in quotes as âsentence fillersâ. Throwing in quotations just to make your essay appear more sophisticated will only be more damaging if the quotation does not adequately reinforce or expand on your contention. Conversely, an essay with no quotations will not achieve many marks either.\n\n4. How Much You Want To Quote\n\nA quotation should never tell the story for you. Quotations are a âsupportâ system, much like a back up for your ideas and arguments. Thus, you must be selective in how much you want to quote. Generally speaking, the absolute minimum is three quotes per paragraph but you should notÂ overloadÂ your paragraphs either. OvercrowdingÂ your essay with too many quotations will lead to failure to develop your ideas, as well as your work appearing too convoluted for your assessor. Remember that the essay isÂ yourÂ piece of work and should consist mainly of your own ideas and thoughts.\n\nSingle Word Quotations\n\nThe word âevaporatesâ, used to characterise money and happiness intends to instill the idea that happiness as a result of money is only temporary. (VCAA âCan Money Buy Happinessâ Language Analysis)\n\nSingle worded quotations can often leave the largest impression on the assessor. This is because you are able to demonstrate that you can focus on one word and develop an entire idea around it.\n\nPhrase Quotations\n\nSunil Badami âstill found it hard to tie my Indian appearance to my Australian feeling', showing that for Sunil, his culture was not Indian, but Australian due to his upbringing. (Sticks and Stones and Such-like, Sunil Badami in Growing Up Asian in Australia)\n\nA phrase quotation is the most common quotation length you will use in essays.\n\nLong Quotations\n\nThe multitudes of deaths surrounding Anna began to take its toll on her, burdening her with guilt as âsometimes, if I walked the main street of the village in the evening, I felt the press of their ghosts. I realised then that I had begun to step small and carry myself all hunched, keeping my arms at my sides and my elbows tucked, as if to leave room for them.â (Year of Wonders, Geraldine Brooks)\n\nLong quotations comprise of more than one sentenceÂ âÂ avoid using them as evidence. Your assessor will not mark you highly if the bulk of your paragraphs consists of long quotations. You should aim to keep your quotations to less than 2 lines on an A4 writing page. If you have a long quotation you wish to use, be selective. Choose only the important phrases or key words, and remove the remaining sentence by replacing it with an ellipsis (â¦).\n\nHere is the same example again, with the student using ellipsis:\n\nThe multitudes of deaths surrounding Anna began to take its toll on her, burdening her with guilt as she felt âthe press of their ghostsâ¦[and] begun to step small and carry myself all hunchedâ¦as if to leave room for them.â (Year of Wonders, Geraldine Brooks)\n\nIn this case, we have deleted: âsometimes, if I walked the main street of the village in the eveningâÂ andÂ âI realised then that I hadâÂ by using an ellipsis â a part of the quotation that is not missed because it does not represent the essence of the studentâs argument. You would have noticed that a square bracket ([ Â ]) was used. This will be discussed in detail underÂ Blending Quotes.\n\n5. How That Quote Will Fit into Your Essay\n\nPlagiarism\n\nYou must never take the original authorâs words and use them in your essayÂ withoutÂ inserting them in quotation marks. Failure to do so leads to âplagiarismâ or cheating. Plagiarism occurs when you take someone elseâs work and pass it off as your own. You must make sure that you use quotation marks whenever you use evidence from your text.\n\nThe following is plagiarism:\n\nEven a single flicker of the eyes could be mistaken for the essential crime that contained all other crimes in itself â thought crime.Â (1984, George Orwell)\n\nUsing quotation marks however, avoids plagiarism:\n\nEven âa single flicker of the eyesâ could be mistaken for âthe essential crime that contained all other crimes in itself â thought crime.âÂ (1984, George Orwell)\n\nThere are serious consequences for plagiarism. VCAA will penalise students for plagiarism. VCAA uses statistical analysis to compare a studentâs work with their General Achievement Test (GAT), and if the cross-referencing indicates that the student is achieving unexpectedly high results with their schoolwork, the studentâs school will be notified and consequential actions will be taken.\n\nPlagiarism should not be confused with:\n\nâParaphrasing: to reword or rephrase the authorâs words\n\nâSummarising: to give a brief statement about the authorâs main points\n\nâQuoting: to directly copy the authorâs words with an indication (via quotation marks) that it is not your original work\n\nBlending Quotations\n\nYou should always aim to interweave quotations into your sentences in order to achieve good flow and enhanced readability of your essay. Below is a good example of blending in quotations:\n\nJohn Proctor deals with his own inner conflict as he is burdened with guilt and shame of his past adulterous actions. Yet during the climatic ending of the play, Proctor honours his principles as he rejects signing a false confession. This situation where Proctor is confronted to âsign [himself] to liesâ is a stark epiphany, for he finally acknowledges that he does have âsome shred of goodness.â (The Crucible, Arthur Miller)\n\nThere are three main methods in how you canÂ blend quotations into an essay:\n\n1. Adding Words\n\nBroken sentencesÂ are a common mistake made when students aim to integrate quotations into their sentences. Below are examples of broken sentences due to poor integration of a quotation:\n\nâSolitary as an oysterâ. Scrooge is illustrated as a person who is isolated in his own sphere. (A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens)\n\nNever write a sentence consisting ofÂ onlyÂ a quotation. This does not add insight into your argument, nor does it achieve good flow or readability.\n\nScrooge, âsolitary as an oysterâ, is illustrated as a person who is isolated in his own sphere.Â (A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens)\n\nThis example is better, however the sentence is still difficult to read. In order to blend quotations into your sentences, try adding in words that will help merge the quotation and your own words together:\n\nDescribed as being as âsolitary as an oysterâ, Scrooge is illustrated as a person who is isolated in his own sphere.Â (A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens)\n\nOR\n\nScrooge is depicted as a person who is âsolitary as an oysterâ, illustrating that he is isolated in his own sphere.Â (A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens)\n\nTip: If you remove the quotation marks, the sentence should still make sense.\n\n2. Square Brackets ([ Â Â ])\n\nThese are used when you need to modify the original writerâs words so that the quotation will blend into your essay. This is usually done to:\n\nChange Tense\n\nAuthors sometimes write in pastÂ (looked), presentÂ (look)Â or future tenseÂ (will look). Depending on how you approach your essay, you may choose to write with one of the three tenses. Since your tense may not always match the authorâs, you will need to alter particular words.\n\nOriginal sentence:Â ââ¦puts his arm around Lewisâ shoulderâ (Cosi, Louis Nowra)\n\nUpon seeing Lewis upset, Roy attempts to cheer him up by âput[ting] his arm around Lewisâ shoulderâ.Â (Cosi, Louis Nowra)\n\nChange Narrative Perspective\n\nThe author may write in a firstÂ (I, we), secondÂ (you)Â or third personÂ (he, she, they)Â narrative. Since you will usually write from an outsiderâs point of view, you will refer to characters in third person. Thus, it is necessary to replace first and second person pronouns with third person pronouns. Alternatively, you can replace first and second person pronouns with the characterâs name.\n\nThe original sentence:Â âOnly now can I recognise the scene for what it was: a confessional, a privilege that I, through selfishness and sensual addiction, failed to acceptâ¦âÂ (Maestro, Peter Goldsworthy)\n\nWhen Keller was finally ready to share his brutal past with Paul, the latter disregarded the maestro, as he was too immersed in his own adolescent interests. However, upon reflection, Paul realises thatÂ âonly now can [he] recognise the scene for what it was: a confessional, a privilege that [he], through selfishness and sensual addiction, failed to acceptâ.Â (Maestro, Peter Goldsworthy)\n\nInsert Missing Words\n\nSometimes, it may be necessary to insert your own words in square brackets so that the quotation will be coherent when incorporated into your sentences.\n\nThe original sentence:Â âHis heels glow.âÂ (Ransom, David Malouf)\n\nAchilles, like Priam, feels a sense of refreshment as highlighted by âhis heels [which] glow.â (Ransom, David Malouf)\n\n3. Grammar\n\nIt is important to maintain proper grammar while weaving in quotations. The question is: does the punctuation go inside or outside the final quotation mark?\n\nThe rule is: If the quoted words end with a full stop (or comma), then the full stop goes inside the quotation marks. If the quoted words do not end with a full stop, then the full stop goes outside the quotation marks.\n\nOriginal sentence: 'Sagittyâs old place plus another hundred acres that went from the head waters of Darkey Creek all the way down to the river.â (The Secret River, Kate Grenville)\n\nPunctuation inside:\n\nDuring the past decade, Thornhill became the wealthiest man in the area, owning âSagittyâs old place plus another hundred acres that went from the head waters of Darkey Creek all the way down to the river.â (The Secret River, Kate Grenville)\n\nPunctuation outside:\n\nDuring the past decade, Thornhill became the wealthiest man in the area, owning âSagittyâs old place plus another hundred acresâ. (The Secret River, Kate Grenville)\n\n6. There Are Also Other Ways of Using Quotation Marks\n\nTitle of Text\n\nWhen including the title of the text in an essay, use single quotation marks.\n\nDirected by Elia Kazan, âOn The Waterfrontâ unveils the widespread corruption among longshoremen working at New Jersey docks.Â (On The Waterfront, Elia Kazan)\n\nAlternatively, you can underline the title of the text instead of using single quotation marks. Many teachers and examiners prefer this option.\n\nQuotation Within a Quotation\n\nWhen you quote the author who is quoting someone else, then you will need to switch between single and double quotation marks. You firstly need to enclose the authorâs words in single quotation marks, and then enclose the words they quote in double quotation marks. If you're following the American standard, you'll need to do this the opposite way - that is, using double quotation marks for the author's words and and then single quotation marks for the quote. We recommend sticking to the preferred Australian style though, which is single and then double.\n\nOriginal sentence:Â ââ¦something bitter and stringy, too difficult to swallow. âItâs just thatÂ â I â um, I hate itâ¦Itâs too â itâs too Indian!ââ (Sticks and Stones and Such-like, Sunil Badami in Growing Up Asian in Australia)\n\nSunilâs unusual name leads him to believe that it is ââ¦something bitter and stringy, too difficult to swallow. âItâs just thatÂ â I â um, I hate itâ¦Itâs too â itâs too Indian!ââ (Sticks and Stones and Such-like, Sunil Badami in Growing Up Asian in Australia)\n\nAs you can see, the student has quoted the authorâs words in single quotation marks. The dialogue used by the author is surrounded by double quotation marks. This demonstrates that the dialogue used in the text still belongs to the author.\n\nUsing Quotations to Express Irony\n\nWhen you wish to express irony, you use quotation marks to illustrate that the implied meaning of the actual word or phrase is different to the normal meaning.\n\nAs a young girl, Elaine is a victim of Mrs Smeath and her so called âfriendsâ. Her fatherâs interest in insects and her motherâs lack of housework presents Elaine as an easy bullying target for other girls her age who are fit to fulfill Torontoâs social norms. (Catâs Eye,Â Margaret Atwood)\n\nIn this case, âfriendsâ is written in inverted commas to indicate that Elaineâs peers are not truly her friends but are in fact, bullies.\n\n7. Questions You Must Ask Yourself When Weaving Quotes into Sentences\n\n1. Â Does the quote blend into my sentence?\n\n2. Â Does my sentence still make sense?\n\n3. Â Is it too convoluted for my readers to understand?\n\n4. Â Did I use the correct grammar?\n\n8. How To Find Good Quotes\n\nTip One: Do not go onto Google and type in 'Good quotes for X text', because this is not going to work. These type of quotes are generally the most famous and the most popular quotes because, yes they are good quotes, but does that necessarily mean that it's going to be a good quote in your essay? Probably not. But why? Well, it's because these quotes are the most likely to be overused by students - absolutely every single person who has studied this text before you, and probably every single person who will study this text after you. You want to be unique and original. So, how are you going to find those 'good quotes'? Recognise which quotes are constantly being used and blacklist them. Quotes are constantly used in study guides are generally the ones that will be overused by students. Once you eliminate these quotes, you can then go on to find potentially more subtle quotes that are just as good as the more popular or famous ones.\n\nTip Two: Re-read the book. There is nothing wrong with you going ahead and finding your own quotes. You don't need to find quotes that already exist online or in study guides. Go and find whatever gels with you and whatever you feel like has a lot of meaning to it. I had a friend back in high school who was studying a book by Charles Dickens. I haven't read the book myself, but there was a character who couldn't pronounce the letter S, or he had a lisp of some sort. What my friend did was he found this one word where, throughout the entire book, the guy with the lisp only ever said the S one time and that was a massive thing. So, he used that. This is something that is really unique and original. So, go ahead and try to find your own quotes.\n\nTip Three: Realise that good quotes do not necessarily have to come from the main character. Yes, the main character does often have good quotes associated with whatever they're saying, but just know that you do have minor characters who can say something really relevant and have a really good point too. Their quote is going to be just as strong in your essay as a main character's quote, which will probably be overused and overdone by so many other students.\n\nTip Four: Develop a new interpretation of a famous or popular quote. Most of the time, the really popular quotes are analysed in very much the same way. But if you can offer a new insight into why it's being said or offer a different interpretation, then this is automatically going to create a really good quote that's going to offer a refreshing point of view.\n\nFor example, if we look at The Great Gatsby, one of the most famous quotes that is constantly being used is, 'He found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass.' What most people will do is they will analyse the part about the 'grotesque thing a rose', because that's the most significant part of the quote that stands out. But what you could do instead, is focus on a section of that quote, for example the 'raw'. Why is the word raw being used? How does the word raw contribute extra meaning to this particular quote? This way you're honing in on a particular section of the quote and really trying to offer something new. This automatically allows you to investigate the quote in a new light.\n\nTip Five: Just remember that the best quotes do not have to be one sentence long. Some of the best quotes tend to be really short phrases or even just one particular word. Teachers actually love it when you can get rid of the excess words that are unnecessary in the sentence, and just hone in on a particular phrase or a particular word to offer an analysis. And also, that way, when you spend so much time analysing and offering insight into such a short phrase or one sentence, it shows how knowledgeable you are about the text and that you don't need to rely on lots and lots of evidence in order to prove your point.\n\nThose are my five quick tips on how to find good quotes from your texts!\n\nNeed more help with quotes?

Summary\n\nThe Crucible is a four-act play that portrays the atmosphere of the witch trials in Salem. As an allegory of McCarthyism, the play primarily focuses on criticising the ways in which innocent people are prosecuted without any founded evidence, reflecting the unjust nature of the corrupted authoritarian system that governs Salem. It starts off with the girls dancing in the woods and Bettyâs unconsciousness, which causes the people of Salem to look for unnatural causes. People start scapegoating others to escape prosecution and falsely accuse others to gain power and land, facilitating mass hysteria which ultimately leads to the downfall of the Salem theocracy. The protagonist John Proctor is one of those that decides to defy the courts and sacrifices his life towards the end of the play, ending the play on a quiet note in contrast with its frenzied conflict throughout the acts.\n\nThe Dressmaker shows the audience the treatment towards Tilly Dunnage upon her return to fictional town Dungatar years after she was wrongly accused of being a murderess. Rosalie Ham critiques the impacts of rumours on Tilly and Molly, also establishing her condemnation of the societal stigma of this isolated town. Tilly starts making haute couture outfits to transform the lives of the women in the town and help them present themselves as more desirable and elevate their ranks. However, the townspeople still see Tilly negatively, except for some individuals who are able to look past the opinions of others and get to know Tilly themselves. Hamâs gothic novel garners the audienceâs sympathy towards the outcasts of the town and antagonises those who find pleasure in creating drama and spreading rumours about others. Â\n\n2. Themes, Motifs and Key Ideas\n\nThrough discussing themes, motifs, and key ideas, weâll gain a clearer understanding of some super important ideas to bring out in your essays. Remember, that when it comes to themes, thereâs a whole host of ways you can express your ideas - but this is what Iâd suggest as the most impressive method to blow away the VCAA examiners. Throughout this section, we'll be adhering to the CONVERGENT and DIVERGENT strategy to help us easily find points of similarity and difference. This is particularly important when it comes to essay writing, because you want to know that you're coming up with unique comparative points (compared to the rest of the Victorian cohort!). I don't discuss this strategy in detail here, but if you're interested, check out How To Write A Killer Comparative. I use this strategy throughout this discussion of themes and in the next section, Comparative Essay Prompt Example.\n\nSimilarities and Differences (CONVERGENT and DIVERGENT Ideas)\n\nSocial ClassÂ\n\nBoth The Crucible and The Dressmaker talk extensively about class. By class, what I mean is the economic and social divisions which determine where people sit in society. For instance, we could say that the British Royals are âupper classâ, whilst people living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to get by are âlower classâ.\n\nUltimately, both The Crucible and The Dressmaker are set in classist societies where there is no opportunity for social advancement. Whilst Thomas Putnam steals the land of poor Salemites accused of witchcraft, the McSwineys are left to live in absolute poverty and never leave the âtipâ where they have lived for generations. Dungatar and Salem view this social division as a âgivenâ and reject the idea that there is anything wrong with certain people living a life of suffering so others can have lives of wealth and pleasure. As such, for both Salem and Dungatar, the very idea that anyone could move between the classes and make a better life for themselves is inherently dangerous. What we can see here is that class shapes the way communities deal with crisis. Anything that overturns class is dangerous because it challenges the social order â meaning that individuals such as Reverend Parris in The Crucible, or Councillor Pettyman in The Dressmaker may lose all their power and authority.\n\nFor The Crucible, thatâs precisely why the witchcraft crisis is so threatening, as the Salemites are prepared to replace Reverend Parris and deny his authority. Although Abigail and the group of girls thus single-handedly overturn Salemâs class structures and replace it with their own tyranny, Parrisâ original intention was to use their power to reinforce his authority. In The Dressmaker, Tilly is threatening because she doesnât neatly fit in to Dungatarâs class structure. Having travelled the outside world, she represents a worldly mindset and breadth of experiences which the townspeople know they cannot match.\n\nFor this theme, thereâs a DIVERGENCE of ideas too, and this is clear because the way that class is expressed and enforced in both texts is vastly different. For The Crucible, itâs all about religion â Reverend Parrisâ assertion that all Christians must be loyal to him ensures the class structure remains intact. More than that, to challenge him would be to challenge God, which also guides Danforth in executing those who donât follow his will. In the case of The Dressmaker, thereâs no central authority who imposes class on Dungatar. Rather, the people do it themselves; putting people back in their place through rumour and suspicion. However, by creating extravagant, expensive dresses for the townspeople, Tilly inadvertently provides people with another way to express class.Â Â\n\nIsolated Communities\n\nCONVERGENT:\n\nThe setting forms an essential thematic element of The Crucible and The Dressmaker. Both communities are thoroughly isolated and, in colloquial terms, live in the âmiddle of no-whereâ.\n\nDIVERGENT:\n\nHowever, what is starkly different between the texts is how this isolation shapes the respective communitiesâ self-image. For Salem, its citizens adopt a mindset of religious and cultural superiority â believing that their faith, dedication to hard work and unity under God make them the most blessed people in the world. Individuals as diverse as Rebecca Nurse and Thomas Putnam perceive Salem to be a genuinely incredible place. They see Salem as the first battleground between God and the Devil in the Americas, and as such, construct a grand narrative in which they are Godâs soldiers protecting his kingdom. Even the name âSalemâ references âJerusalemâ, revealing that the Salemites see themselves as the second coming of Christ, and the fulfilment of the Bibleâs promises.\n\nNot much of the same can be said for The Dressmaker. Dungatar lacks the same religious context, and the very name of âDungatarâ references âdungâ, or beetle poop. The next part of the name is 'tar', a sticky substance, creating the impression that Dungatar's people are stuck in their disgusting ways. The townspeople of Dungatar are acutely aware of their own inadequacy, and that is why they fight so hard to remain isolated from the outside world. Tilly is therefore a threat because she challenges their isolation and forces the men and women of Dungatar to reconsider why their community has shunned progress for so long. In short, she makes a once-isolated people realise that fear, paranoia, division and superstition are no way to run a town, and brings them to acknowledge the terribly harmful impacts of their own hatred.\n\nOn top of that, because Salem is literally the only Christian, European settlement for miles, it is simply impossible for them to even think about alternatives to their way of life. They are completely isolated and thus, all of their problems come from âwithinâ and are a result of their own division. For Dungatar, itâs a mix of societal issues on the inside being made worse by the arrival of people from the outside. The township is isolated, but unlike Salem, it at least has contact with the outside world. All Tilly does, therefore, is show the people of Dungatar an alternative to their way of life. But, for a community used to the way they have lived for decades, it ultimately contributes to its destruction.\n\nâ\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\n3. Comparative Essay Prompt Example\n\nThe following essay topic breakdown was written by Lindsey Dang. If you'd like to see a completed A+ essay based off this same essay topic, then check out LSG's A Killer Comparative Guide: The Crucible & The Dressmaker, written by 50 study scorer and LSG tutor, Jordan Bassilious!\n\n[Modified Video Transcription]\n\nCompare the ways in which outcasts are treated in The Crucible and The Dressmaker.\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nBefore writing our topic sentences, we need to look at our key words first. The keywords in this prompt are outcasts and treated.\n\nSo, who are considered outcasts in the two texts? Outcasts can be those of traditionally lower classes, they can be characters with physical flaws, those that are different to others or those who do not abide by the standards of their respective societies.\n\nIn The Crucible: Tituba, Abigail, John Proctor or even Martha Giles can be considered as outcasts.\n\nIn The Dressmaker: We can consider Tilly, Molly, The McSwineys, etc.\n\nWe also need to look our second key word âtreatedâ. How would we describe the treatment towards these characters? Are they treated nicely or are they mistreated and discriminated against? Do ALL members of that community have that same treatment towards those outcasts or are there exceptions? Remember this point because we might be able to use this to challenge the prompt.\n\nWeâre going to skip Step 2: Brainstorm today, but if youâre familiar with LSG teachings, including the THINK and EXECUTE strategy discussed in my How To Write A Killer Text Response ebook, then youâll be good for this part.\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nARGUMENT 1\n\nBoth texts portray outcasts as victims of relentless accusations or rumours, seeking to engage the pathos of the audience towards those who are marginalised.\n\nIn The Crucible, Tituba the âNegro slaveâ is the first person to be accused by witchcraft in Salem. Her âconsequent low standingâ is also shown through her use of language âYou beg me to conjure! She beg me make charmâ which is fraught with grammatical errors, compared to Judge Danforth who uses legal jargon and the Putnams who are much more well-spoken.\n\nSimilarly, the McSwineys are also those of lower class and are seen as the outcasts of Dungatar. Their names show us their position in the social hierarchy because they are associated with swines which are pigs. This is confirmed by Sergeant Farrat who said âTeddy McSwiney was, by the natural order of the town, an outcast who lived by the tipâ. Even when Teddy McSwiney died, the townspeople still did not reflect on the impacts that their prejudice and bigotry had on him, eventually forcing the McSwineys to leave the town because they could not find a sense of belonging living there.\n\nTilly is also poorly treated due to the fact that she is fatherless, being bullied by the kids at school especially Stewart Pettyman and also used by William as a leverage to marry Gertrude, threatening Elsbeth that âitâs either her [Gertrude] or Tilly Dunnageâ\n\nAlso discuss Giles Coreyâs death and the significance of his punishment as the stones that are laid on his chest can be argued to symbolise the weight of authority\n\nARGUMENT 2\n\nMiller and Ham also denounce the ways in which outcasts are maltreated due to their position in the social hierarchy through his antagonisation of other townspeople.\n\nThereâs also a quote on this by Molly âBut you donât matter â itâs open slather on outcasts'. Herein, she warns the audience of how quickly outcasts can become victims of rumours and accusations as the term âslatherâ carries negative connotations.\n\nSimilarly, the theocracy that governs Salem dictates the rights of their people and children. He specifically states 'children were anything but thankful for being permitted to walk straight, eyes slightly lowered, arms at sides, and mouths shut until bidden to speak', which explains the girlsâ extreme fear of being whipped. Salem is very violent to children, slaves and helpers and it can be seen that this is the result of the social hierarchy and the Puritan ideology.\n\nFor The Dressmaker, also discuss the ways in which they name others in this quote âdaughter of Mad Molly is back â the murderess!â Likewise discuss how Goody Osbourne the âdrunkard half-wittedâ and Sarah Good an old beggar woman are the first ones to be named. You can talk about Martha who is accused of being a witch just because she has been âreading strange booksâ, and Sarah Good due to the mere act of âmumblingâ. The normality of these actions underlines the absurdity of the accusations made against these individuals, furthering Millerâs chastisement of the fictitious nature of the trials and also the ways in which outcasts are the first to be scapegoated.\n\nARGUMENT 3\n\nHowever, there are still characters that are driven by their sense of morality or remorse instead of mistreating the outcasts of their community.\n\nBoth Sergeant Farrat and Proctor are motivated by their remorse to make amends. Proctorâs evasion of âtearing the paperâ and finding âhis goodnessâ is motivated by his desire to atone for his sin (having committed adultery with Abigail), and Sergeant regretted sending Tilly away. He, in his eulogy, says âif you had included [Tilly], Teddy would have always been with usâ, expressing his regret for the ways outcasts are treated in Dungatar. Similarly, Teddy McSwiney also has a pure relationship with Tilly and treats her differently instead of judging her based on the rumours about her being a âmurderessâ.\n\nWhile those who can sympathise with outcasts in The Dressmaker are either outcasts themselves or are remorseful (or both), there are those in The Crucible that are purely and solely motivated by their moral uprightness. Rebecca Nurse is neither an outcast (as she is highly respected for her wisdom) nor remorseful (as she has remained kind and pure from the beginning of the play). She is always the voice of reason in the play and tries to stop authoritative figures from convicting and prosecuting outcasts. A quote you can use would be âI think you best send Reverend Hale back as soon as he come. This will set us all to arguinâ again in the society, and we thought to have peace this year'.\n\n4.

Additionally, possible contentions are included, ensuring you can see how arguments about these topics can be effectively made.Â\n\nTopics\n\n1. Kanyeâs blow-up - The necessity of the media to stop platforming celebrities spreading harmful ideas\n\nAmerican rapper Kanye West has always been a controversial figure, but since his endorsement of Trump in 2016 heâs seemingly been on a particularly bad downward spiral. His descent into increasingly more extremist right-wing politics has led to the question of whether the news media, detached and neutral as they might claim to be, should even be reporting on him.Â\n\nAs of writing (late 2022), Kanyeâs recent appearances on far-right talk shows to voice support for Hitler and question the existence of the Holocaust (which has no doubt been topped by something equally controversial by the time this gets published) pushes this question right to its limit.Â\n\nEvents like this are undoubtedly big stories that many people would like to know about, but does reporting on them do more harm than good? Do we realistically all have the self-control to ignore these figures when so much of modern news already revolves around controversy and gossip?\n\nPossible Contentions:\n\nMajor media companies should reach an agreement to actively avoid covering celebrity behaviour that spreads dangerous ideas.Â\n\nNews media should make an extra effort to disprove the dangerous ideologies of those they cover, rather than presenting them in a âneutral wayâ.\n\nâ\n\n2. Amber Heard - How online discourse can villainise marginalised groups and encourage âdogpilingâ\n\nA similar celebrity controversy that dominated 2022 headlines was the two-way public defamation lawsuit between actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, which involved accusations of abuse on both sides. One of the most notable parts of this case was the online depiction of Heard, on social media platforms such as Facebook and Youtube.Â\n\nHeard emerged as the internetâs new favourite punching bag, with an endless stream of videos and memes where her âallegations of domestic violence and sexual assault were mocked for entertainmentâ. Crucially, these were made to criticise her in a way that most clearly mirrored historical sexist stereotypes about emotionally manipulative women. You probably came across examples of these yourself, as platforms like Youtube have a history of directing users to this kind of content.Â\n\nAs such, key issues were identified in terms of how social media warps online discussions of allegations of abuse. Additionally, like the last topic, the very fact that this legal dispute was publicly broadcast raises questions as to whether the mediaâs focus on this event may have worsened the issue.Â\n\nPossible Contentions:\n\nPersonal legal proceedings between celebrities are not something that should be broadcast to the public.\n\nThe online discussion regarding this trial demonstrates the need for increased regulation of hateful and abusive content on social media platforms.\n\n3. Should Australia be made a republic in the wake of the Queenâs death?\n\nThe death of Queen Elizabeth II in September of 2022, among many other things, drew Australia back into a debate it's been having for decades; should we become a republic? This would be a shift from our current state of (effectively) being overseen by the United Kingdom as a âconstitutional parliamentary monarchyâ, with the âhead of stateâ now being an Australian citizen rather than the UK monarch.Â\n\nAlthough the replacement of the Queen with the new head of state (King Charles III) shouldnât really shift peopleâs perspective on this issue, it most likely will. Queen Elizabeth has been the welcoming and approachable symbol of the monarchy for many Australians. Her death could be the catalyst for a shift in public opinion, severing the connection that many citizens still had to the UK monarchy.Â\n\nThis issue can be approached from many different angles, inducing discussion on HOW the process of Australia becoming a republic should occur (especially how the new head of state should be chosen), as well as stepping back and assessing the positives and negatives of making this shift.\n\nPossible Contentions:\n\nAustraliaâs transition to a republic is a necessary step in helping honour the countryâs Indigenous population and rejecting its colonial past\n\nAustraliaâs transition to a republic, although often framed as an act of national unity, will actually worsen the cultural divides within our country.Â\n\nAlthough Australia should transition to a republic, the current rise of nationalist politics makes a public election of the new head of state extremely risky.\n\n4. Are NFTs a positive advancement in contemporary technology?Â\n\nWhether or not you understand what it actually means, the phrase âNFTsâ has probably been inescapable on your social media feeds over the last year. Without getting too detailed, these âNon-Fungible Tokensâ are essentially investments into non-replicable representations of artwork, which will (supposedly) increase in value over time.Â\n\nDespite seemingly being an exciting new technology that could have given control back to artists through copyright ownership, NFTs have instead been heavily criticised for commercialising artwork by reducing it to a literal piece of digital currency. Further issues have arisen in terms of how this technology can easily be used to scam people through misrepresenting the value of individual NFTs, or NFT owners simply taking the money and running.\n\nWhat do you think? All new technology seems shaky and uncertain at the start, and maybe we should recognise that the current negative impacts of NFTs must simply be overcome with time. How do we weigh the benefit this technology has for individual artists against its potential drawbacks?\n\nPossible Contentions:\n\nFor their many flaws, NFTs give the power back to creators and, therefore, need to be improved rather than roundly rejected.Â\n\nDespite preaching democratisation, NFTs and Bitcoin are both a part of a technological trend that will further increase wealth inequality.\n\n5. How much can Western citizens really do to fight injustice via social media activism?\n\nThe effect of the COVID pandemic on developing countries, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and human rights abuses by the nation of Qatar - this year has seen an innumerable number of news stories that would make any reasonable person jump to their phones to see what they could do to help, like signing an online petition or sharing a public post to spread awareness.\n\nHowever, as you probably know, these forms of social media 'slacktivismâ have historically drawn criticism for their ineffectiveness and self-serving nature. Increasingly though, this debate has become more complicated, moving away from the simplified dismissal of any social media activism that emerged around the turn of the century. Others have rightly pointed out that many influential contemporary social movements, that have had real-world impacts, did emerge from social media, such as the BLM and #MeToo movements.Â\n\nAs such, thereâs a lot of room for different arguments here regarding whether a critical perspective of âsocial media slacktivismâ has become outdated in a world that is increasingly unavoidably based on the internet.\n\nPossible Contentions:Â\n\nSocial media activism is unavoidably the way that young people are going to engage with political issues, and a rejection of it is naive and impractical.Â\n\nPolitical activism should distance itself from the online world if it wants to make real-world change that doesnât fit neatly under existing power structures.\n\n6. Is the overload of various media streaming service subscriptions sustainable?\n\nâStreaming fatigueâ has emerged as a 2023 talking point that may have seemed unthinkable just a few years ago. Remember when we just had Netflix offering us a new way of consuming film and TV that was both more convenient and cost-effective than âpay TVâ packages (which were often heavily inflated in price and packed with unwanted channels)?\n\nHowever, as we move into 2023, many have argued that the current subscription landscape now mirrors the previous pay-TV model. Consumers once again find themselves having to pay for an increasingly large amount of services if they want to conveniently access their film and TV shows. Predictably, this has seen a re-emergence of video piracy.Â\n\nDoes this mean that it's fundamentally impossible for us to access our media as conveniently as weâd like to, and the years of Netflix being the only streaming service that had all we wanted were never sustainable? Or maybe corporations are unfairly squeezing every dollar they can out of us, and piracy is a fair and just consumer response?Â Â\n\nPossible Contentions:\n\nThrough offering convenience that is unparalleled by any other previous technology, streaming services are still worth the cost.Â\n\nConsumers should actively engage in digital piracy until media corporations create a more affordable streaming environment.\n\n7. Is a post-COVID work-at-home model healthy for the next generation of workers?\n\nAlthough 2020 and 2021 may be remembered as the âyears of COVIDâ, 2022 onwards is perhaps when we will see which long-term impacts of the pandemic continue to stick around. Aside from the permanent placement of public hand sanitiser stations, working from home has emerged as one of the most prominent main-stays from our lockdown years.Â\n\nIs this something that we should embrace? A lot was said during the lockdown about the mental health effects of being deprived of human connection; is this something we should just forget about when it comes to work? As with many of these issues, the question arises as to whether this shift is an inevitable effect of technological advancement, which we can either accept or fruitlessly battle until it becomes the new normal.Â\n\nHowever, the fact that this âwork from homeâ dynamic only emerged due to a pandemic complicates this idea, making it possible that we may have accidentally all become accustomed to a new economic model of work that we would be better off without.Â\n\nPossible Contentions:Â\n\nWe must actively push back against the âwork from homeâ model; if we donât, we will suffer both mentally and financially into the future.Â Â\n\nWorking from home is a win-win; it's more convenient and cost-effective for both employer and employee.\n\n8. How can gentrified and aestheticised versions of social movements be avoided?\n\nI wonder whether you saw the Indigenous name for Victoriaâs capital city (Naarm) appear more frequently on your social media feeds this year, with people adding it to their Instagram bios or referring to it on TikTok? What started as a conscious choice to respectfully refer to the city by its original Indigenous name quickly became criticised as a trendy aesthetic for outwardly progressive white Victorians, with terms like ânaarm-coreâ becoming short-hand for a specific kind of trendy fashion that was âdevoid of any ties to First Nations peopleâ.Â\n\nâNaarm-coreâ, therefore, stands as another example of a movement that may have started with admirable aims, but was drowned out by those who just wanted the social benefits of participating in progressive politics. Think of the recent similar debates about ârainbow capitalismâ, with similar criticisms being made of brands that co-opt progressive concepts like LGBQTI+ identity purely for social (and financial) capital. The question naturally emerges as to how we can avoid this for future political movements.Â\n\nOr maybe you disagree with all these critiques? Political discussion moves so fast these days that it can feel like people are in such a rush to criticise things that they miss actual progress being made. After all, the use of the term âNaarmâ to refer to Melbourne was undeniably popularised on the back of this trend.Â\n\nâPossible Contentions:Â\n\nThe criticism of political movements that deal with race being tokenised by white people can only be solved by allowing people of colour at the centre of these movements.\n\nPeople are too cynical about social movements and trends; virality and popularity, despite âinauthentic intentionsâ, often do more good than harm.Â\n\n9. How can the highly polarised discussion concerning COVID vaccines become more productive?\n\nAnother thing you may have witnessed from living in a post-COVID world is an increase in how divided simple issues seem to make us. Ever tried to convince a relative or friend that, no, in fact, vaccines are not designed to implant us with microchips - seems impossible right?Â\n\nFor many people, the pandemic was a tipping point into full-blown conspiracy communities, meaning people are increasingly able to exist within their own social-media realities that donât need to be bound to scientific truth or objective fact. This all creates a division between those with different beliefs that is somehow wider than before, where we canât even agree on simple statements of truth.Â\n\nThe debate around what to do about this deals with questions of human psychology, social media (again), but also freedom of speech. Should spreading (potentially dangerous) false information that conflicts with scientific consensus be allowed on social media? Most importantly, how do we encourage actual communication between different sides?\n\nPossible contentions:\n\nTalking in person is the only way for people with vastly different beliefs to find common ground.\n\nThose spreading dishonest and dangerous conspiracy theories about public health cannot be reasoned with, and need to be actively shut down wherever they appear.\n\n10. With the infamous Oscar slap, what âconsequencesâ should comedians and satirists face for what they say?\n\nHereâs a news story that youâre probably tired of hearing about! Actor Will Smithâs act of violence against Oscar host and comedian Chris Rock for a joke about his wifeâs alopecia (hair loss) caused many different conversations to happen at once; about toxic masculinity, celebrity culture, violence as a spectacle. These are all totally valid angles for your Oral Presentation, but letâs focus on maybe the most common debate; did Chris Rock deserve this?Â Â\n\nFunctioning as a comedian hosting an awards night, Rockâs job was to poke fun at everyone participating, and these sorts of roles have often involved controversial comments and jokes. Does this mean they have immunity from any consequences for their words though? What should these consequences look like? And, if we excuse smaller acts of violence, what does that normalise?Â\n\nThe 2015 terrorist shooting of the staff of satirical French magazine âCharlie Hebdoâ for their depiction of the Islamic prophet may seem a world away from Will Smithâs slap, but some may argue that this is the logical end-point for a world that believes physical violence is the way to deal with jokes people donât like.Â\n\nPossible Contentions:\n\nThe idea of comedians actually being threatened by violence is overblown; the slap was an isolated incident.\n\nProtecting the safety of those who make controversial jokes is paramount to maintaining freedom of speech.\n\n11. With Optus and Telstraâs recent data breaches, is placing all our valuable personal information in virtual spaces sustainably safe?Â\n\nThis year saw a record-level data breach from one of Australiaâs leading telecommunications companies, Optus. The personal details of almost 10 million customers were given to the hackers.Â\n\nThen, two weeks later, a similar data breach happened at Telstra. Yes, this time, no customer information was leaked, but information on the companyâs employees was again released.Â\n\nAll of this may disturb the image we all have in our heads of online databases as relatively unbreachable, locked away behind thousands of firewalls somewhere in the cloud. In fact, much of modern society operates on this assumption. Maybe youâve added your credit card details to your Chrome tab because it makes online purchases easier? This convenience comes with the implicit assumption that online personal info is pretty much always safe when protected by a big tech company, but these events arguably prove otherwise.Â Â\n\nCyberattacks are âincreasing as a threatâ, yet danger for the sake of convenience is something that all of us deal with. Maybe you think there are degrees to this; should we draw a line at information that can cause us legitimate harm if given to a malicious party?Â Â\n\nPossible Contentions:\n\nOur society is already too technologically dependent to try and âgo offlineâ for the sake of data safety.\n\nValuables of any kind are always going to run the risk of being stolen, and digital piracy is no different.\n\n12. What is the role of Western countries in resisting the unlawful Russian invasion of Ukraine?\n\nAs already mentioned, the Russian invasion of Ukraine was one of the biggest news stories of 2022. Putinâs unlawful decision to attack the countryâs capital in February of 2022 has left more than 10,000 people dead and millions displaced from their homes. Virtually all world leaders condemned this act immediately. Yet, almost a year later, the war continues, and documented war crimes occur on Ukrainian soil.\n\nThinking larger than just social media, the question of what can actually be done to help by the countries who condemn this war has naturally emerged. Many nations have supported Ukraine financially, including the US giving nearly $20 billion. Some may argue that this is not nearly far enough, and that all world powers have a responsibility to wage direct war against Russia in support of Ukraine. Naturally though, many are strongly against Western intervention in this form, believing that countries like the US should not see themselves as all-knowing powers that can intervene in other nations based on their ideological beliefs.Â\n\nâPossible Contentions:\n\nAny attempt to guilt individual citizens about their need to âdo something about Ukraineâ is completely unfair; the responsibility for any meaningful action is entirely on the government.\n\nThe West, particularly the US, has a long history of militarily invading smaller nations for their own purposes; their condemnation of the Russians is hypocritical.\n\nIf you havenât already done so, check out our Ultimate Guide to Oral Presentations for some general tips and tricks to get you started!\n\nWritten by Milo Burgner\n\nThis blog was updated on 21/10/2020.\n\nContents\n\n1.

Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nThe Secret River is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Secret River is a historical novel telling the story of William Thornhill, a poor Englishman from the early 19th century who was deported and transported to New South Wales, Australia in 1806 for theft. This novel tells the story of Australia's founding and the moral choices made when Â Europeans colonised land that was already inhabited by Aboriginal people.\n\nBackground\n\nDuring 18th century to mid 19th century, 162,000 men and women were transported to Australia, with majority from England. These people, known as âconvictsâ, had committed crimes such as larceny and robbery â acts which were considered severe offenses and demanded heavy sentences. In order to deal with the overwhelming masses of criminals, the government exported crowds of convicts to Australia to serve their term as labourers. The reason driving the deportation included an attempt to decrease poverty and crime in England while concurrently developing the British colony in Australia.\n\nMany of the fleets from England were destined for New South Wales, Australia. Those on the fleets included the criminals, marines, and their families. Living in a penal colony, the criminals were employed depending on their various skills: farmer, boatman, servant etc. The settlers were award a âticket of leaveâ if they presented good behaviour during labour. This meant that settlers would become emancipists, where they were set free from the governmentâs sentence and could begin a life for themselves by making their own living. This suited the governmentâs goal for a successful and thriving colony since it would only be possible if people were to work for themselves, and not under the terrain of the government.\n\nAlthough Australia was chiefly populated with Indigenous Australians, the first century of colonisation saw a drastic decline in their population. This was due to a clash of desire for the land; the nativeâs innate protection of their land and the white settlers struggle to declare their right to an area already inhibited by natives â possibly for 40,000 years. The two cultures failed to ever create a peace agreement or compensation and as a result, the frontier was often marked with blood. Overtime, a successful of the British colony meant that white settlement overpowered any possibility of the natives retaining their land. The Secret Riverâs exploration of this powerful change in Australiaâs history is a poignant reflection of the past, and demands attention to the sensitive issue of Australian and native relationship that is still present today.\n\nSetting\n\nSet during the early 19th century. Located in London, Sydney and on the Hawkesbury.\n\nChapter 1: Strangers\n\nPlot\n\nThe Alexander, a transport ship for convicts has reached New South Wales, Australia after a travelling across the world for majority of the year. William Thornhill, an Englishman convicted to sentence his ânatural life in the Year of Our Lord eighteen hundred and sixâ [pg 3] will serve as a labourer.\n\nDuring his first night in New South Wales, where their homes are âonly a flap of bark, a screen of sticks and mud,â Thornhill digested the new land with its ârich dank smellsâ¦restless waterâ¦no Pole starâ; an environment vastly differentiated from England. The unfamiliar situation is overwhelming as âhe had not cried, not for thirty yearsâ¦.but now his throat was thickening.â In his despair, Thornhill describes how being sentenced to New South Wales could potentially be worse than dying itself.\n\nInitially, Thornhill believed his tears are clouding his vision since the âdarkness moved in front of himâ [pg 5]. However, he then realised that a human, âas black as the air itselfâ stood before him. The unusual appearance of this human struck Thornhill since âhis skin swallowed the lightâ¦[and] eyes were set so deeply into the skull.â Although clothed, Thornhill ironically felt âskinlessâ against the other who was completely naked and holding a spear. Thornhill repeatedly demanded that the man âbe offâ, for fear of his family and himself being attacked. Despite his shouting, this only impelled the man to move closer to the point where they almost touched. The âblack manâ [pg 6] reproduced âbe offâ in Thornhillâs exact tone. While Thornhillâs fear of this strange human is prominent, he grappled the strength to exert a bold, intrepid veneer, as âhe was not about to surrender to any naked black manâ. When he glanced back to his wife and children however, the man promptly disappeared, leaving only the darkness behind. Thornhill returned to his hut where he laid back down to rest yet âevery muscle was tensedâ¦the cold moment of finding that unforgiving thing in his flesh.â\n\nAnalysis\n\nEnvironmental / Landscape conflict\n\nFor Thornhill, who has spent a lifetime in England, the confrontation of a new environment evokes a powerful sense of unfamiliarity. The unknown land presents him with various intrapersonal conflicts, one of which is the difference between England and Australian stars. While the physical distance of this new land from Thornhillâs home is demonstrated by the lack of a âPole Star, a friend to guide him on the Thames, [and] no Bear that he had known all his life,â [pg 4] the unrecognisable stars above Australia only depict a âblaze, unreadable, [and] indifferent.â His conflict demonstrates his physical and emotional distance from Thames, a place he grown up surrounded by compared to Australia, where learning begins from the very basics, as shown when he absorbs the natural landscape around him. The night described as âhuge and damp, flowing in and bringing with it the sounds of its own lifeâ [pg 3] highlights how the Australian land is unique, possessing qualities of existence.\n\nThornhillâs sense of negligence in the vast forest that continues âmile after mileâ is illustrated through the imagery of the âtrees [which] stood tall over him,â depicting that nature is a powerful and dominant force over the Europeans. While the trees render him insignificant, it also demonstrates his alienation from the environment. The âAlexander,â a common traditional English name, represents an intrusion of the Europeans onto the Australian land, further highlighting the idea that they do not belong on this island.\n\nThe Australian land is depicted to be harsh and unforgiving, as highlighted through the imagery of âdirt chill...sharp stab...alien stars' [pg 4] This conflict with the brutal landscape, along with the unknown leaves Thornhill apprehensive of what is to come. His feeling that he was ânothing more than a flea on the side of some enormous quiet creatureâ [pg 4] depicts the Australian land almost like a monster. Additionally, the words ârestlessâ draw to the idea that the land is at discomfort or uneasy to have new inhabitants.\n\nRacial/Cultural conflict\n\nThe conflict between two cultures is shown through the initial encounter between Thornhill and an Indigenous Australian. Without any conversation, the tension between the two is clear, merely through their actions in each otherâs prescence. Thornhill notes the Aboriginal maleâs tattoos, yet regards them as âscarsâ since he is unaware to their culture. Even before this man, Thornhill is still infused with a sense of nakedness because of his unfamiliarity.Â His feeling that âevery muscle was tensedâ¦the cold moment of finding that unforgiving thing in his fleshâ highlights the tension of his first encounter of an Australian Aboriginal while it also foreshadows a suffering and anguish for his time ahead.\n\nIf you'd like to see the all Chapter plots, their analysis, along with important quotes, then have a look at our The Secret River Study Guide.\n\nQuotes\n\nConflict with land quotes\n\nâNow it had fetched up at the end of the earth.â [pg 3]\n\nââ¦this prison whose bars were ten thousand miles of water.â [pg 3]\n\nâforeign darknessâ [pg 3]\n\nââ¦soughing of the forest, mile after mile.â [pg 3]\n\nâHe was nothing more than a flea on the side of some enormous quiet creature.â [pg 4]\n\nThornhillâs inner conflict quotes\n\nâHe had not cried, not for thirty years, not since he was a hungry child to young to know that crying did not fill your belly.â [pg 4]\n\nâBut every muscle was tensed, anticipating the shock in his neck or his belly, his hand going to the place, the cold moment of finding that unforgiving thing in his flesh.â [pg 6]\n\nRacism quotes\n\nâIt took a moment to understand that the stirring was a human, as black as the air itself.â [pg 5]\n\nâClothed as he was, Thornhill felt skinless as a maggot.â [pg 5]\n\nâThis was a kind of madness, as if a dog were to bark in English.â [pg 6]\n\nâHe was not about to surrender them to any naked black man.â [pg 6]\n\nSample Essay Topics\n\n1.

This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nTheme-Based essay prompt: The Secret River depicts many layers of conflict, within but also between its key characters. Discuss\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThe key term of this prompt is conflict, but I think itâs also important to analyse how itâs discussedâas something that exists in layers, and something that can happen both within and between characters. This seems to hint at the idea that conflict can be internalâthat is a single character can feel conflicted about somethingâas well as externalâthat is two or more characters can have some kind of dispute. This prompt will require us to think about all these different types of conflict.Â\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nLetâs start with the most internal layerâconflicts with the self. In terms of key characters, consider William but also Sal: what debates do they have with themselves, or what do they say or do that shows they feel conflicted or unsure about something?Â Â\n\nThen, letâs broaden that out to interpersonal conflicts between characters. How do William and Sal, for example, come into conflict with their neighboursâboth their white neighbours and their Aboriginal neighbours? How do they come into conflict with each other, even?\n\nMaybe itâs worth separating the racial conflict into another categoryâconflicts between groups of characters, rather than individual characters. If we make this distinction, we need to be prepared to back it upâin what ways is this conflict of a different nature?\n\nStep 3: Create a plan\n\nI think we can pretty justifiably separate out our layers of conflict into those categories: interpersonal, interpersonal and interracial. This gives us three neat(-ish) paragraphs and a clear, affirmative contention: yes, there are many layers of conflict, and those are the three layers.Â\n\nP1: At its most intimate layer, conflict is internalâthe moral dilemmas of William and Sal are particularly strong examples.\n\nP2: Conflict can also be interpersonalâwe can see this between William and Dan, or William and his neighbours, or between William and Sal even. Itâs up to you which way you cut this paragraph.\n\nP3: However, perhaps the central conflict that the novel is built around is interracial conflict between white colonisers and the Aboriginal people whose land they occupied. To extend the prompt a little, we can talk about conflict not just between characters or people, but also between value systems. For example, the way colonisers saw land and property were fundamentally incompatible with how Aboriginal people saw itâthis is another type of conflict.\n\nIn this sense, weâre largely agreeing with the prompt, backing up the distinction between interpersonal and interracial conflict, and finding a way to extend on it a little towards the end. We can build this into the contention as well: there are many layers of conflict, but they occur not just between characters. They can also exist between the broad cultural values of entire groups of people as well.Â\n\nIf you find this essay breakdown helpful, then you might want to check out our The Secret River Study Guide where we cover 5 A+ sample essays (written by a 50 study scorer!) with EVERY essay annotated and broken down on HOW and WHY these essays achieved A+ so you reach your English goals!

Choosing the best topic for you is easily the most difficult part of this SAC, so to hopefully ease the burden, Iâve crafted this list with the latest and biggest global debates. My two biggest pieces of advice are NOT to choose an overly complex subject and NOT to choose anything you donât really understand. A simple idea that is argued effectively works far better than a complex idea argued poorly. Moreover, find a topic that you are genuinely passionate about; regardless of what your ideas are, your passion is the key to success.\n\nThat being said, if you are currently struggling to find some inspiration, have a read of the following oral topics that will hopefully bring light to the relevant and pressing issues of the world.\n\nIf you havenât already, check out our Ultimate Guide to Oral Presentations for some general tips and tricks to get you started!\n\nTopics\n\n1. Not enough is being done to address gender discrimination, violence and inequality in Australia\n\nWe are lucky to live in a country where gender discrimination is on the decline, and where weâre progressively making our way towards equality. Unfortunately, we havenât quite reached it yet. Gender discrimination and sexist ideologies slowly make their way through our school locker rooms, into our classrooms, across our halls, and most tragically, into our homes. Do we really focus on fixing these issues from youth through education, or are the government and media just letting these problems run their course?\n\nÂ The key thing to focus on is the barriers still present in society that are preventing us from reaching true equality. Search for famous female figures in Australia and the struggles they had to overcome solely based on their gender like Julia Gillard, Grace Tame and Nicole Kidman. Moreover, in a country as advanced and progressive as Australia, why are hundreds of women continuing to be murdered in domestic abuse disputes? Itâs these terrifying statistics that demonstrate how far we have to go as a country, and how quickly we need action.\n\n2. Addressing the âClimatic Catastropheâ is being hindered by climate scepticism and multimillion-dollar corporations\n\nClimate change. A buzzword for the top problem of the future. Even now, weâre feeling the terrible effects of the heating climate - floods, droughts and life-changing bush fires that have misplaced thousands of Aussies. A problem this big should require immediate action, right?\n\nWell, two things are preventing us from slowing the changing climate and growing emissions. Firstly, Australia is clearly over-reliant on the coal industry. It is our top export after all, and our mining industry always proves to be a âbooming successâ. Not to mention the several âgenerousâ donations provided from multimillion-dollar fuel corporations to several of our own government parties.\n\nSecondly, there seems to be certain online rhetoric that perpetuates false information. Otherwise known as âclimate scepticismâ, there are people who genuinely believe that climate change is a âhoaxâ and not worth the time or effort to address. Think about the impact that the spreading of this misinformation can do.Â\n\n3. Are we too reliant on fossil fuels?\n\nThe Russian war against Ukraine has had several terrible impacts across the world, affecting countries that werenât even involved in the conflict to begin with. You may have heard your parents complain about the soaring fuel prices, or even had to cash out almost double for petrol yourself. The main reason for this is Australiaâs reliance on fuel imports from Russia, which have quite obviously been disrupted.\n\nThis brings forward an important question, are we too reliant on fossil fuels as a nation? Imagine if we had made the switch to electric cars even just a few years earlier. I have a feeling our transport situation would be significantly better. Think about the policies we would need to introduce to become greener and more self-sufficient.\n\n4. Indigenous injustices and deaths in custody are still being ignored\n\nWARNING: This topic contains descriptions and the name of a recently deceased Indigenous person.\n\nVeronica Nelson, a 37-year-old Indigenous woman, died whilst in custody after calling out 40 times for help from prison staff while being tragically ignored. Her unjust death evaded all sorts of media attention until her recent coronerâs report was revealed. According to doctors, if she had simply received medical attention that night, she would still be here with us today. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated issue.\n\nHundreds of reports of police brutality, deaths in custody and compliant media sources have been covered up or callously ignored. Take a look at the recent Royal Commission into the almost 500 Indigenous deaths in custody. What can we do as a nation to prevent further harm to our First Nation People?\n\n5. Are social media âinfluencersâ skewing our perceptions of reality?\n\nThereâs no denying it, social media is one of the most influential platforms across the world. We often look towards celebrities and new âinfluencersâ for inspiration, life advice and familiarity. Especially coming out of the pandemic, these influencers have been a source of comfort for many during lockdowns. Unfortunately, lives are easy to fake and we are left wondering whether the people we look up to in the social media world are creating unrealistic expectations for us. Are they gaining profit at the expense of our mental health, or do they genuinely care for human connection?\n\n6. Overconsumption in the fashion world: SHEIN, Fashion Nova and more\n\nOnline shopping is becoming our new reality, but rapidly growing fashion trends have led to mass production and inhumane outsourcing of labour. Think about the new fast fashion outlets that opened in Melbourne. Should we really be giving a retail platform to businesses that exploit workers and tailors, consistently produce poor-quality clothes and contribute to extensive land pollution? Weâve experienced huge clothing turnover over the past decade, contributing to one of our biggest land-fill issues at the moment. The emphasis on the constant need for more âtrendyâ pieces results in items of clothing being poorly produced and going âout of fashionâ faster and consequently getting thrown out at the end of a new season. Fast fashion is an affordable option for many, but it comes at a cost of underpaid labour and pollution. How can society work towards finding the middle ground, so that everyone benefits and more importantly, what individual efforts can be made to ensure this?\n\n7. Alcohol consumption amongst youths is becoming increasingly normalised\n\nEveryone knows about the impact of alcohol on the body and mind, especially when it is consumed under age. Yet, binge drinking in Australia is a common weekend occurrence for students and is constantly normalised at social gatherings. Turning 18 and officially becoming an adult is exciting for many because of the prospect of finally being able to legally purchase and consume alcohol. However, even now, the long-term effects of alcohol have been proven to be the same as certain drugs and yet, it is heavily marketed by various companies, particularly to young Australians (Cassidy, 2021).\n\nMany healthcare professionals stress that we need to work on reducing the culture of heavy drinking in Australia by increasing awareness of the genuine dangers. Think about ways in which we can do this that are different from what we have in place already.\n\n8. The treatment of Ukraine vs. the Middle East/Sri Lankan/Asian refugees\n\nWhen the war began in Ukraine, it rightfully caused worldwide outrage. Countries pledged artillery, medical aid and further security assistance for those fighting and opened their borders to Ukrainian refugees. However, during numerous conflicts in the Middle East, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, the world remained silent. The irony lies too within our own government, which was quick to reprimand Russia during the war and willingly state Australia will accommodate Ukrainian refugees, yet sends all other refugees that arrive in Australia to Christmas Island, or back home. There was, and still is, a difference in the treatment of vulnerable people that has long been tied into prolonged systematic racism, and it is still not being addressed.\n\n9. âFinancial influencersâ are damaging peopleâs lives and careers\n\nWeâve all seen it online, across Facebook and TikTok. âFinancial influencersâ that can âturn you into a millionaireâ as long as you invest in their 12-step monetised plan for monetary freedom. For the most part, it is unsupported financial advice from online influencers who donât have any qualifications. They cover bitcoin, cryptocurrency and âNFTsâ on social media, mainly encouraging people to quit their jobs and fully focus on the stock markets. Whilst some people have given out genuinely helpful and accessible advice, most end up teaching teenagers and young adults the wrong information, or strategies that have a low chance of success. We have a duty to protect people online, and adults making unsupported gambles with their finances is going against that. A good place to start would be to find out the real-life experiences of people who have lost money and stability as a result of this âadviceâ.\n\n10. Social media has led to growing desensitisation and a lack of human empathy\n\nThe internet can be a place of joy and entertainment, allowing us to connect with people across the world and have access to endless information. Unfortunately, it is also a dark space filled with unregulated content that can be easily accessed. Weâve seen mass shootings, suicides and other disturbing material live streamed, exposing us to the worst acts of human nature. There are even those with a âmorbid curiosityâ who purposefully try and find this content. Continued exposure to this type of content results in more desensitisation towards this material. If we continue this path, are the majority going to lack empathy towards others? Have a look at the wider effects of this type of content on the development of the brain.\n\n11. The gaps in our labour market are only going to grow without rapid action\n\nOver the past year, we have had some of the worst gaps in the labour market. There have been shortages in some of the most essential positions such as nursing, teaching, paramedics and 000 operators. The low wages and stressful nature of the jobs have made it difficult to find enough people willing to enter those job sectors. However, they are vital for our society to function, so how come nothing has yet been introduced to rapidly fix these shortages? Currently, we are out-sourcing labour, but this isnât a long-term solution and we need to ensure that we donât experience these problems in the future.\n\n12. Vaccine privilege\n\nOver the past few years, especially in Australia "
