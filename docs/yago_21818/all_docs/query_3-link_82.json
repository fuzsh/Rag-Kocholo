        "text": "There’s just something about the brands we connect with. We have an affinity with them that’s hard to put your finger on. It’s as if we know them. In some cases, it’s as if we love them.\n\nWhat is it that attracts us to these brands? Why do we welcome them into our family or show loyalty towards them?\n\nIs it awesome Ad copy, amazing brand identity design or some kind of trickery?\n\nThe answer? Brand Archetypes.\n\nIn this article, we’re going to show you how you can use them to hack the mind of your audience to create enduring connections.\n\nThe 12 Brand Archetypes\n\nHere is a snapshot of the 12 Brand Archetypes we’ll be deep-diving into.\n\nHow The Brand Archetype Framework Builds Emotive Brands\n\nAlthough all brands are businesses that we have a transactional relationship with (they give you something in exchange for your money), for some brands, we feel connection, loyalty and in some cases love.\n\nThe most loved brands connect with their audience on a deeper level than most brands and those with an authentic brand purpose often capture hearts. According to Netbase, Lego is the third most loved brand in Europe with 280,314 expressions of love towards it back in 2017. Business Insider’s article dives into the full list of 21.\n\nNo doubt you will have some fond memories of at least one or two of them.\n\nMaybe you’re attached to your Macbook, your Air Max or your Heinz Baked beans.\n\nIt’s probably none of those things but I’ll bet you my last tin of beans you have a connection with a brand where the alternative just won’t cut it.\n\nAlmost all brands that you feel such a bond with are built with a solid alignment to an archetype, which are grounded in decades of psychological research and have their roots in Greek Mythology.\n\nPsychologist Carl Jung who coined the term in the early 20th century was in good company. Though Carl and Sigmund fell out later on.\n\nHow Human Emotion Gave Birth To The Archetype\n\nWe all have basic human desires. We aren’t taught to want or need them. We just do.\n\nThey are instinctive and primitive. I’m sure you can relate.\n\nHere are the basic human desires that each match with a specific archetype;\n\nLIBERATION > THE OUTLAW\n\nPOWER > THE MAGICIAN\n\nMASTERY > THE HERO\n\nINTIMACY > THE LOVER\n\nENJOYMENT > THE JESTER\n\nBELONGING > THE EVERYMAN\n\nSERVICE > THE CAREGIVER\n\nCONTROL > THE RULER\n\nINNOVATION > THE CREATOR\n\nSAFETY > THE INNOCENT\n\nUNDERSTANDING > THE SAGE\n\nFREEDOM > THE EXPLORER\n\nYour heart rate will increase for some more than others.\n\nAs we are all different, our desires are different. My core desire might be Innovation, while yours might be Freedom or Mastery.\n\nWhen we consider that certain behaviours or personalities increase certain desires, we can understand why some personalities appeal to us more than others.\n\nEnter Archetypes – The Masters At Evoking The Required Desire\n\nArchetypes are the personification of these behaviours and provide a roadmap that enables you to more accurately appeal to a given desire with a specific personality.\n\nThere are two primary reasons you would want to align your brand with an archetype.\n\nConnection: Most brands today are in the coalface competing on features, benefits and price. If you don’t want your brand to become a commodity, you will need to make a deeper connection with your audience.\n\nDifferentiation: When it comes to standing out in a crowd, differentiation strategies seem well worn, with latecomers to the party left with little to work with. Personalities, on the other hand, have infinite possibilities. They’re not only unique but can be extremely memorable.\n\nBuild A Brand Personality That Demands Attention\n\n(Grab the 4-Step Archetype Checklist Now)\n\nDon’t build a LIMP APOLOGETIC BRAND that’s easily ignored. Cult brands with fanatic followers DEMAND ATTENTION by oozing personality to make emotional connections. Use the ARCHETYPE FRAMEWORK and FOLLOW THESE FOUR ACTIONABLE STEPS to help your brand find out WHO your brand is.\n\nThis Is Why Archetypes Are So Unbelievably Effective\n\nThrough the use of story, art, religion, myths, Archetypes characterise universal patterns of behaviour that we all instinctively understand.\n\nWhen you dive into these archetypes and the behaviour traits of each, you will probably recognise yourself, your family and your friends.\n\nWhether it’s your funny uncle acting like The Jester at your grans birthday or your anti-establishment friend dropping conspiracy theories in the pub as The Outlaw, you will see these archetypal personalities time and again.\n\nAlthough the behaviours of your uncle and friend are familiar through experience, the behaviour or archetypes whom you don’t have experience with will also be recognisable.\n\nWhy? Because they are pre-programmed into your subconscious.\n\nWe don’t immediately think of an archetype character when we see the behaviour but it is an instinctive understanding and it feels familiar.\n\nBecause the understanding of these archetypes is instinctive, we are able to connect with (or avoid) others very quickly when we experience them.\n\nBecause this recognition is pre-programmed into our brains, they are an extremely useful tool when defining the position of your brand and the personality traits that will resonate with your intended audience.\n\nI mean, I don’t like using superlatives but as the headline reads, it’s like a hack into the mind of your audience.\n\nSeriously, any brand that wants more than transactional relationships with their audience, need to work with archetypes. It’s a no-brainer.\n\nArchetypes Have A Rich History\n\nNow I don’t want this article to be a historical field guide, but their history shows they’re not some fad.\n\nArchetypes are as old as the art of storytelling itself.\n\nPlato, (The Greek philosopher) who was knocking about in Athens in 348 B.C. explored the idea of archetypes when he spoke of “forms of intuition” as the templates of intuitive understanding.\n\nSwiss Psychiatrist Carl Jung coined the term “Archetypes” in the context of personality. He said we all have a “collective unconscious” that channel experiences and emotions, resulting in typical patterns of behaviour.\n\nIn other words, we are born with the same instincts and unconscious understanding of behavioural patterns and we recognise them when we see them.\n\nIn their 2001 book “The Hero and the Outlaw: Building Extraordinary Brands Through the Power of Archetypes” Margaret Mark and Carol S. Pearson state that; “Archetypes are the heartbeat of a brand because they convey a meaning that makes customers relate to a product as if it actually were alive in some way, they have a relationship with it and care about it.”\n\nThere’s A 95% Probability That A Brand Archetype Has Seduced You\n\nAs you can see, archetypes aren’t some pie-in-the-sky growth-hack. They’re legit with actual science to back them up.\n\nWe know that we have emotional connections to some brands despite the fact that our relationship is based on a transaction.\n\nWe also know that the reason we feel this way is based on the way these brands communicate with us and they do that by leveraging the science of archetypes.\n\nYou definitely don’t hear the term “Archetype” every day; yet they have likely influenced what’s sitting in your pocket, your gym bag or even your driveway.\n\nAccording to Harvard Professor Gerald Zaltman; a whopping 95% of our purchasing decisions are made in the subconscious mind. This means that brands with a strong archetypal personality that connects on an emotional level with their audience, have a massive advantage over their competition.\n\nMy Name is Maximus Decimus Meridius … And I’m an Archetype!\n\nAs you’ll see when we uncover the 12 Jungian Archetypes, each one is very familiar. As we covered already, this is partly to do with your intuition and partly to do with experience, culture and storytelling.\n\nYou see, long before branding and marketing experts got their mitts on archetypes, storytellers and filmmakers had been writing and creating some of the worlds most loved books and films with archetypal characters.\n\nHere are a few examples.\n\nThe exploits of Indiana Jones as The Explorer.\n\nThe guiding wisdom of Yoda as The Sage in Star Wars.\n\nThe rising from the ashes conquest of Maximus as The Hero in Gladiator.\n\nAll of these much-loved characters are built on archetypal foundations, as the storytellers knew about your intuitive instinct to connect with them quickly.\n\nThey are brought to life through story, where their personality can work to evoke an emotion within you, which allows you to form a connection with the character.\n\nThis is why you’re at the edge of your seat when Indy is in danger or why wish you had Yoda about to ask him some questions or why you celebrate Maximus’ bloody victory.\n\nThe Brand Archetype Strategy Goes Beyond Selecting Characteristics\n\nIf you don’t want to be just another business in the market competing on price, benefits and features, then you will need to connect with your audience on a deeper level.\n\nYour brand needs a real personality with a tone of voice.\n\nLess experienced brands may pick a couple of traits that they think their audience will relate to. But archetypes are fully formed personalities with an outlook on life, an opinion on the world and firm beliefs that allow brands to connect as though they were human.\n\nIn other words, if you want your audience to know who you are as a brand, your brand needs to know who it is.\n\nAligning your brand as tightly as possible to a single archetype will allow your brand personality feel all the more familiar to your audience and allow you to communicate with the consistency and humanity of a real person.\n\nBrand Archetypes Are Not About Appealing To Everyone\n\nAs the old adage goes “If you try to please everyone, you’ll end up pleasing no one”. Great brands are focussed.\n\nYou may be tempted to take traits from multiple archetypes to express your brand’s individualism but understand the consequences of a “confused brand”.\n\nReferenced in the book “The Hero and The Outlaw” an analysis uncovered that brands with “tightly defined” archetypal identities rose in value by 97% more over six years than “confused brands” or brands with characteristics from many different archetypes.\n\nThe moral of the story? Know who you are, know who your audience is and don’t try to please everyone.\n\nTry listening to your audience more, and your archetype will be more effective.\n\nHang On…Who is the Archetype? My Customer or my Brand?\n\nAs archetypes represent all personalities then they are both your customer and your brand.\n\nThe trick is to identify your customer’s personality, then align your brand with the archetype that would most appeal to a desire within your customer (They are often the same but not always).\n\nFor example; your audience might be “The Everyman” but you want your brand to appeal to “The Explorer” within them. In This case your brand should be more aligned with “The Explorer” Archetype and use personality and communication to evoke their desire to explore.\n\nWe’ll dive into some more strategy a little further down.\n\nHere Are The 12 Brand Archetypes [+ Infographic]\n\nOk, but I hate to disappoint you because you already know them. (Get it? Archetypes…? Unconscious Understa… never mind).\n\nHere are the infographics in full if you’d like to save them.\n\nEmbed Infographic (Top Section)\n\nEmbed Infographic (Bottom Section)\n\nThe Outlaw Archetype\n\nThe Outlaw Personality\n\nThe Outlaw has a desire for revolution partly to change the world for the better and partly for the anarchy involved. They have a disdain for rules, regulation and conformity that would remove any form of their freedom of choice (or anyone else’s). They are good at the core but anger is part of their motivation, which can become the dominant force. Without a fight, they are lost.\n\nThe Outlaw Branding Strategy\n\nTo appeal to an outlaw you need to prove to them first that you see the world as they do. Status Quo and Conformity are the common enemy and showing disdain for either will go a long way to resonating. Encouraging, facilitating or empowering revolution on the other hand, will make you an instant family (or gang) member. Formal communication should be avoided and your language and tone should be laced with grit and attitude.\n\nThe Outlaw Industries And Categories\n\nAutomobile (Motorcycles)\n\nDestruction Tools\n\nAlternative Apparel\n\nBody Art\n\nThe Outlaw Brand In Action – Harley Davidson\n\nThe Magician Archetype\n\nThe Magician Personality\n\nThe Magician strives to make dreams come true through somewhat mystical ways. They have the ability to take people on a journey of transformation through the experience of a magical moment. They believe that we are limited only by imagination and defy the common belief of the laws of reality to lead us to a better future. Magicians have a thirst for knowledge though they don’t willingly share it, rather they use it to show their vision.\n\nThe Magician Branding Strategy\n\nThe Magician archetype rarely fits a buyer persona but appeals to different personas with their ability to transform. Brands that provide a product or service that take their customers on a transformational journey (Lost to found, Insecurity to security, Worn out to refreshed), could well consider the Magician Archetype as the personality to connect with their audience.\n\nThe Magician Industries And Categories\n\nEntertainment\n\nBeauty\n\nRelaxation / Well-Being\n\nHealth\n\nThe Magician Brand In Action – Disney\n\nThe Hero Archetype\n\nThe Hero Personality\n\nThe Hero’s main motivation is to prove their worth through courage and determination.\n\nThey work hard in order to have the skills they deem requirements and take pride that their work rate sets them apart from the rest.\n\nThey need to meet challenges head-on and carry defeats or failures until they are corrected.\n\nThe Hero wants to save the day to prove their worth to themselves but also so the world knows of their ability.\n\nThe Hero Branding Strategy\n\nTo appeal to a hero you should inspire them and make them feel empowered to succeed and achieve.\n\nThey see themselves as upstanding citizens and the bully’s nemesis and they stand up for what’s right.\n\nHero’s want to rise to their ambitions and brands that can acknowledge those ambitions and encourage the challenge will connect with them.\n\nA Hero wants to be inspired by the possibility to achieve and gratification that comes with it.\n\nThe Hero Industries And Categories\n\nSportswear\n\nSports Equipment\n\nOutdoor / Tactical Equipment\n\nEmergency Trade Services (Plumbing, Electricity, Locksmiths, Mechanic)\n\nThe Hero Brand In Action – Nike\n\nThe Lover Archetype\n\nThe Lover Personality\n\nThe lover desires to be desired. The experience of Intimacy, closeness and sensual pleasure are what the lover seeks and will use the means they have to achieve it. They are motivated to become more physically and emotionally appealing to increase their capacity to attract others.\n\nThey fear being unnoticed, unloved and unwanted and because their passionate desires cloud their judgement, they can easily be misled. Even when Lovers achieve all their desires, they are still fearful of loss.\n\nThe Lover Branding Strategy\n\nTo appeal to a Lover you need to make them feel attractive or stir their passionate desires for connection and intimacy. Because of their attraction to sensory pleasure, communication and messaging should use sensual language and tone. Imagery and tone of voice are especially important for The Lover archetype.\n\nBrands appealing to Lover personalities can leverage their audiences desire for sensual pleasure through sight, sound, smell or touch. The colour red is especially appealing to The Lover.\n\nThe Lover Industries And Categories\n\nFragrance\n\nCosmetics\n\nWine\n\nIndulgent Food\n\nIndulgent Travel\n\nThe Lover Brand In Action – Alfa Romeo\n\nThe Jester Archetype\n\nThe Jester Personality\n\nThe Jester is all about having fun and living life in the moment. They not only love having fun themselves, they see it as their duty to be a ray of sunshine in everyone’s life around them.\n\nThey are optimists and can’t be kept down long due to their ability to see the good in every situation. Jesters are young at heart and continue their child-like nature long after their friends have grown up and become serious.\n\nThe Jester Branding Strategy\n\nLike Magicians, Jesters are rarely a buyer persona but can be a perfect archetype for brands in the business of entertaining or wanting to associate themselves with good times.\n\nRegardless of archetype and personality, everyone likes to laugh and provided the context and the timing is right, the Jester personality can be a memorable and loving point of differentiation.\n\nAs the Jester Archetype your brand should highlight the light-hearted and positive side of life with a playful and entertaining spirit. Brands that are able to connect with their audience through happiness and laughter can become much-loved brands.\n\nThe Jester Industries And Categories\n\nConfectionary\n\nProfessional Services\n\nBeer / Lager\n\nChild Services\n\nThe Jester Brand In Action – Dollar Shave Club\n\nThe Everyman Archetype\n\nThe Everyman Personality\n\nThe Everyman above all wants simply to belong. They tend to blend into society as ‘everybody” and don’t like to stand out in the crowd. They’re friendly and easy to talk without being overly funny or overly rude or overly loud.\n\nThey lend their trust easily though they fear being rejected. They are relatively positive and strive to fit into the group. They tend to have a liking for most things without being overly passionate about one. The Everyman can be quite liked but can also be easily forgotten.\n\nThe Everyman Connection Strategy\n\nTo appeal to an Everyman you need to make them feel a sense of belonging. Brands that revolve around everyday activities might use this archetype with the message that it’s ok to be normal.\n\nHome or family life brands fit this archetype perfectly while elitist positioning or “we’re better” messaging would be a turn-off. Appealing to an Everyman requires honest, humble, friendly and down to earth communication that doesn’t exclude.\n\nThe Everyman Industries And Categories\n\nHome / Family Life\n\nComfort Foods\n\nEveryday Apparel\n\nAutomobile (Family / Everyday)\n\nThe Everyman Brand In Action – The Gap\n\nThe Caregiver Archetype\n\nThe Caregiver Personality\n\nThe Caregiver is a selfless personality who is driven by the desire to protect and care for others, especially those in need. They are often maternity figures and take those who are in need of care, under their wing until they are stronger to take care of themselves.\n\nThis personality is personified perfectly by the nursing profession and though they like their effort to be recognised don’t like being patronised. Caregivers are not just reactive, they are also preventative and tend to be in and around an event of harm, before or after.\n\nThe Caregiver Branding Strategy\n\nThe Caregiver archetype is a perfect fit for brands that help those in need. The people such brands help are often vulnerable and sensitive and require a soft touch. Warm, thoughtful, generous and motherly approach offers a feeling of safety that will appeal to their needs.\n\nA Caregiver brands aim is to make their customers feel secure, protected and cared for. Caregiver brands may need to appeal to wider audiences as they often require external input in order provide care for those in need. In such a case, educational and conscience evoking messages may be the key.\n\nThe Caregiver Industries And Categories\n\nHealth & Aged Care\n\nNot-for-profits\n\nHospitals\n\nEducation\n\nThe Caregiver Brand In Action – Unicef\n\nThe Ruler Archetype\n\nThe Ruler Personality\n\nThe Ruler desires control above all else and is a dominant personality. They are authoritative in their communication and in their actions and carry a sense of intimidation. Their goal is for prosperity and success and for that prosperity to trickle down to those that are loyal to his rule. They are confident, responsible and in control of their lives and expect the same from others. Rulers see themselves at the top of the food chain and aggressively defend that position.\n\nThe Ruler Branding Strategy\n\nTo appeal to a Ruler you must re-affirm their sense of power, control and respect. Rulers want to feel a sense of superiority. That they are part of an exclusive V.I.P. club. Appealing to the masses will not get the Rulers attention and would more likely turn them off. Ruler brands must provide their customers with a sense re-affirmation that they are at the top of the ladder of success and are part of an exclusive club.\n\nThe Ruler Industries And Categories\n\nAutomotive (Luxury)\n\nWatch Manufacturers\n\nHotels\n\nFormal Wear Apparel\n\n(Any Brands Providing Luxury or High Quality)\n\nThe Ruler Brand In Action – Mercedes-Benz\n\nThe Creator Archetype\n\nThe Creator Personality\n\nThe Creator has a desire to create something new and exceptional, that wasn’t previously there, and has enduring value. They need to express themselves with their individual talent and strive to bring their vision to life through that expression. Creators believe that if you imagine it, it can be created but are often stifled by their own desire for perfection.\n\nThe Creator Branding Strategy\n\nTo appeal to a creator you must celebrate the creative process while inspiring self-expression. Brands that provide the means or tools to express themselves creatively with freedom of choices would be well positioned with the Creator Archetype. Their communication should stir the desire for the creative process and inspire their customers to express their nature to the best of their ability. Creator brands leverage their audiences’ imagination and their desire to create and innovate.\n\nThe Creator Industries And Categories\n\nArts\n\nDesign\n\nInformation Technology\n\nMarketing\n\nWriting\n\nThe Creator Brand In Action – Lego\n\nThe Innocent Archetype\n\nThe Innocent Personality\n\nThe innocent is a positive personality with an optimistic outlook on life. They crave safety but ultimately, they want themselves and everyone else to be happy.\n\nThey are honest and pure and have no ill-will towards anybody. They don’t hold grudges and believe everyone has the divine right to be who they truly are.\n\nThey see beauty in everyone and have a knack to see inner beauty that others don’t.\n\nThe Innocent Branding Strategy\n\nTo appeal to an innocent, you need to earn their trust with simple, honest and most importantly, positive communication. Negative or guilt based communication is a complete turnoff. They need to associate your brand with safety and will feel a connection when their inner beauty is recognised.\n\nThe Innocent Industries And Categories\n\nBeauty & Skin Products\n\nOrganic\n\nCleaning\n\nFresh Food\n\n(Anything you put in or on the body)\n\nThe Innocent Brand In Action – Dove\n\nThe Sage Archetype\n\nThe Sage Personality\n\nThe Sage is a seeker of truth, knowledge and wisdom. Their drive comes from the desire to not only understand the world, but to then share that understanding with others. They are life-long learners and enjoy expressing their knowledge with philosophical conversations. They are more likely to pass on their wisdom to someone who can use it to change the world, rather than change the world with it themselves.\n\nThe Sage Branding Strategy\n\nTo appeal to a sage you need to pay homage to their intelligence as you communicate. Higher level vocabulary with layered or philosophical meaning will be acknowledged and appreciated while over simplified or dumbed down messages will not. They expect factual and well-researched information, which should be watertight to avoid challenges.\n\nThe Sage Industries And Categories\n\nMedia and News Networks\n\nSchools and Universities\n\nEducational Businesses\n\nConsultancies\n\nSearch Engines (Google, Bing)\n\nThe Sage Brand In Action – Google\n\nThe Explorer Archetype\n\nThe Explorer Personality\n\nThe explorer has a palpable inner drive to push themselves outside their comfort and conformity of everyday life; into the rugged environment they feel at home in. They are brave, adventurous and love a challenge. The challenges are more about understanding themselves more than proving to others and they are on an everlasting journey of discovery.\n\nThe Explorer Branding Strategy\n\nTo appeal to an explorer, you need to challenge them. Challenging the confines of modern life will also allow you to resonate with them quickly. You should promote the outdoors and the unknown as the land of the free and challenge them to explore it, with your brand of course. Modern society is the common enemy in which many explorers live. A stand against such conforms can go a long way to resonating with the explorer and evoking their desires.\n\nThe Explorer Industries And Categories\n\nExtreme Sports\n\nOutdoor Equipment\n\nAutomotive (SUV Category)\n\nAdventure Travel\n\nThe Explorer Brand In Action – The North Face\n\nArchetype Branding is Chess, Not Checkers… A Differentiation Strategy Is Key\n\nWithout a doubt, you recognise these archetypes or more specifically their personalities. But how do you choose which one to apply to your brand?\n\nYour industry will often have a typical personality that your audience would expect. The healthcare sector would be The Caregiver as an example.\n\nAlthough differentiation is key to a strategic brand (here are 10 ways to differentiate), communication to would-be healthcare customers, as an Outlaw or a Jester wouldn’t go down well would it?\n\nThis is where the Archetypal Mix comes in.\n\nYou need a core archetype that will represent a minimum of 70% of your brand personality (any less, your personality will be confusing and you’ll struggle to connect with your audience through familiarity).\n\nThe other 30% is your influencer archetype, which is left to spend on differentiation. But don’t let this 30% burn a hole in your pocket. Use it when you must and spend it wisely.\n\nYour core archetype may need to be aligned with your industry archetype (depending on your sector). If so, you need to get creative with your remaining 30%.\n\nIf you can go against the grain of your industry with your core archetype (eg. if you’re not a Caregiver in the Health space etc), you have an opportunity to make some real noise in your sector.\n\nRemember, you want to differentiate your brand not blend in. If you’re just going to jump into a flock of flamingos with pink feathers then we won’t be able to see you will we?\n\nWhen The Outlaw Became The Creator\n\nIt’s possible for a brand to break through to their audience as one archetype but to develop a closer alignment to another as it evolves.\n\nApple is a perfect example of a brand breaking through with one and developing with another.\n\nIn 1984, Microsoft dominated the personal computer market. They were very much then, and still remain, a “Ruler” brand.\n\nApple came to the market with their anti-regime “1984” ad, and with it, a message to the world that they were “The Outlaw” that wanted to right the wrongs of their industry.\n\nApple ran many more “Outlaw” campaigns, including the hugely successful “I’m a Mac vs I’m a PC”, which signified who best represented their audience; Younger users that wanted more choice and had creative tendencies. This piece by referral candy outline how Apple continue to break the mould.\n\nIn 1997, Steve Jobs inspired Apples’ “Think Different” campaign, which celebrated Icons that had changed the world, including creative geniuses such as Bob Dylan, Thomas Edison and Pablo Picasso.\n\nApple aligned themselves with creatives, encouraged their audience to “Change the World” through their creativity, and provided a tool of self-expression to do so, and so the became a “Creator” brand.\n\nHere, Neil Patel dives into what we can learn from Apple’s Marketing.\n\nArchetypes Are Masters At Evoking Your Desires\n\nArchetypes in branding are not simply about mirroring the personality of your audience.\n\nIt’s about identifying the desire that you want your brand to evoke and using that desire to define your personality.\n\nSo before defining your archetype based purely on your audiences’ personality, consider the primary motivation and the desire you want your archetype to evoke, and develop your brand archetype with that desire at the core. Emotion in branding, as always, is the key.\n\nBrand archetypes speak to your customer’s primary motivations which are often emotionally charged.\n\nKnowing what you want to mean to your audience is key to taking that position in their mind. Here are some of the most common positional approaches.\n\nWe are the same:\n\nYour personality reassures your audience that they are the same as you. You provide a sense of belonging and togetherness.\n\nYou can be me:\n\nYour personality represents everything your audience aspires to be. Through the alignment of your brand your audience feel like they have arrived at their idea of success.\n\nI can guide you:\n\nYour personality represents safety, like a lighthouse in a stormy sea. You need to acknowledge the predicament but reassure them you know the path to safety. You are trustworthy and steadfast.\n\nYou can be great:\n\nYour personality inspires your audience to believe in themselves so they can achieve what they want in life. Your communication and personality is motivating.\n\nDownload The Brand Archetype Framework Checklist\n\nBrands that make emotional connections with their audience have personality built on an archetypal framework. Follow these four steps to help your brand find out who it is.\n\nOnce Your Character is Defined… Your Story Begins\n\nOnce you have an archetype in place, you now have the foundation and character for a brand story.\n\nAristotle knew a thing or two and he reckoned human beings are hardwired for story.\n\nThe science of Neural Coupling backs that up (This Ted video on Neural Coupling and storytelling by Uri Hasson is an absolute eye-opener). It turns out we are 22 times more likely to remember a story than fact. Although that’s enlightening, something about it doesn’t feel surprising.\n\nThis is because story activates a much deeper part of the brain than simple fact sharing. More than that, our brainwaves when listening to a story, match the brainwaves of the storyteller. The term “we’re on the same wavelength” was made for storytelling.\n\nArchetypes are about your brand knowing who it is and being able to communicate with a consistent personality and tone of voice as a character in the life of your audience.\n\nBut what is a character without a story?\n\nIf you describe Indiana Jones to someone, they might seem interested in his character, but if you read them “The Temple of Doom”, you’ll take them on a journey where they’ll fall in love with the character.\n\nPeople don’t want information; they want to be taken on a journey.\n\nSo, as you develop your archetypal brand character, you can begin to weave a story around it.\n\nWhere did it come from?\n\nWhere is it going?\n\nWhat will happen along the way?\n\nUse this detail to build your brand character, personality and story. Add to it as you go and tell chapters of the story along the way.\n\nWhere your character takes your audience is entirely up to you.\n\nConclusion\n\nBrand archetypes are not a new concept but they are an underutilised one, especially in the smaller business space.\n\nThat’s refreshing to know. Not much is underutilised these days.\n\nWith so much noise in any market, it is only brands that connect on a human level that garner any kind of affection.\n\nThere is no better way to connect on a human level than with a human personality and there’s no better way to develop a human personality than using an archetypal framework developed to evoke human desires.\n\nBrand Archetypes are a tool that can help you differentiate your brand, give it a depth of personality and use it to truly connect with your audience so they begin to feel something for you.\n\nAn effective Brand Story is intriguing and an opportunity to be truly authentic.\n\nIf your brand is lacking direction, identity or human connection with your audience then it’s not appealing to their desires.\n\nIdentify what it is you want your audience to feel, map the archetype that will appeal best and develop a real personality to give your brand conviction.\n\nMake sure you know who your brand is, what it stands for and where it’s going.\n\nBrands that know where they’re going, inspire people to follow.\n\nOver To You\n\nIf you’ve gotten all the way through this article, then congratulations. You’re now armed with some powerful knowledge to help you build a brand with emotional connection.\n\nNow it’s over to you.\n\nLeave a comment and let me know your thoughts.\n\nHow are you connecting with your audience?\n\nWhere do you stand on branding with emotion through personality?\n\n11K Shares\n\nBy |\n\nAbout the Author: Stephen Houraghan\n\nStephen is a passionate Brand Creator and Founder of Iconic Fox Brand Agency.
