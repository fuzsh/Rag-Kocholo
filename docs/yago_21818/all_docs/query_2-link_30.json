        "text": "Hey… How ya’ll doinnn? 🙈😂\n\nLet’s just call thissss “when March becomes May.”\n\nOriginally, my intention was to take a few months off to rest, turn down the volume on everything in my life, && recover. Little did I know, May would arrive in the blink of an eye, bringing an extraordinary past few months that I now refer to as my “selfish era.” 😌 During this time, my health transformed, my relationships blossomed, and our personal life underwent a massive shift.\n\nFor those of you following me on social media, you’ve gotten a little sneak peek of the changes over the last few weeks, but there is SO much more to come and I can’t wait to keep sharing. In just a few days, we’re about to embark on yet another nomadic journey, and I couldn’t be more excited. Stay tuned for next episode where I’ll dive into our plan that is complete with homeschooling and all the craziness that comes with it. Plus, I can’t wait to spill the tea on how I’m 30 pounds lighter! 🏋🏻‍♀️ Buuuut more on that in the next episode. Today, let’s focus on business.\n\nLook Back At It\n\nTo give you some context, let’s rewind to 2022. That year marked our third stint of nomadic living, and we traveled the world, starting in Costa Rica and making our way through Europe, living in Italy, London, Amsterdam, and Paris. It was an extraordinary time, both personally and professionally. I unlocked so many personal success codes and managed to generate over $400,000 that year while working only 10-15 hours a week. Damn Gina, that girl was on fire. 🔥 It was a year of immense creativity and financial success, but by the end of it, I was exhausted.\n\nIn 2023, we decided to return to America, build our dream home, and settle down. We landed in Texas, built and furnished a beautiful home, but quickly realized it wasn’t for us. The vibrant, full-color life we experienced while traveling dulled significantly. Despite having more time, my creativity and motivation waned, partly due to the routine of daily life and partly because I felt turned off by the online business industry. 🫠\n\nTurning It All Off\n\nDuring the second half of 2023, I felt burnt out and began deconstructing my business, aiming to rebuild it with integrity and impact. Two things I didn’t let slip away, but definitely wasn’t prioritizing over societal standards. This period led to a bit of perfectionism and an identity crisis. I questioned whether I belonged in this industry, felt the pressure of societal expectations, and doubted my choices for my children and my business.\n\nBy the end of the year, I knew I needed to take a break. So, I turned everything off. 🎚️📴 The podcast, social media, email — everything except my mastermind, my membership, and my private clients. This break allowed me to breathe and reflect, although it wasn’t easy. I chose to let go of 75% of my team and drastically reduce my working hours, which was challenging for someone who is so masculine & driven to their core. 🙋🏻‍♀️\n\nLessons Learned and New Beginnings\n\nDuring my selfish era, I faced significant challenges… Something I won’t totally get into, but a situation occurred where I faced massive trust issues with the last team member I had which led to me letting her go, some legal hurdles like protecting my IP and trademark infringements, and a lot of resurfaced sisterhood wounds. 🩹❤️‍🩹 Although this was painful in the moment, this situation taught me invaluable lessons about protecting my business, updating contracts, and ensuring I surround myself with the right team.\n\nThis era also reminded me of how crucial my wellness and adventurous lifestyle are to my creativity and business success. I embarked on a “glow-up,” focusing on my health and relationships, which brought back my creativity and energy. ⚡️ I rediscovered the importance of feeling good in my body and living adventurously. Again, more to come on that in next episode…\n\nMoving Forward with More Than Enough\n\nAs I emerged from my selfish era, I’m now entering what I call my “more than enough” phase. I’m no longer chasing endless growth for the sake of it. Instead, I’m focused on presence, peace, and sustainability — making good money with minimal effort to enjoy life fully and ensure a comfortable future. My husband and I have never been open to discontentment, but I’ve realized that doesn’t always mean chasing more, more, more… It can mean being happy with enough and being so grateful for the bonuses that get to come. 🌈✨\n\nI’m hungry for more than just success. I’m hungry for a life that is above the standard. 📈 A fulfilling life where I can be present for my loved ones and myself. Where I prioritize my marriage, motherhood, and my wellness above business. This shift in focus has already been so rewarding. 🥹\n\nHere’s to living adventurously, embracing our selfish eras, and finding our more than enough.\n\nxoxo, Ash\n\nCOMEBACK SALE OFFERS\n\nThe Retired Bundle ⏤ Valued at $688, this bundle is just $87 for the month of May!
