        "text": "Last month, we talked about the subject of creative inspiration: that an artist’s many influences affect his worldview and sensibilities in ways totally unique to him, and that they, along with his particular life experiences, constitute his voice. In time, those influences become so embedded in his subconscious that he is no longer necessarily aware of the sway they hold over the art he produces, and as his confidence in his craft intensifies, his intellectual capacity to identify them in his work diminishes in kind.\n\nAs it happens, a week or two after posting the treatise, I received an object lesson in its very proposition. The experience was an acutely emotional one for me, though not at all unpleasant or unwelcome, and a reminder of what storytelling at its best can do: A story can comment on its times while reflecting timeless truths. It can depict a very specific world that is nonetheless universally relatable. It has the power to preserve a moment or an episode in all its emotional complexity, serving as a time capsule that can continue to yield new insight with age. A good story changes the course of history, in some unquantifiable measure, influencing subsequent real-world events and artistic works in ways that, I think, go mostly unconsidered.\n\nHere’s how one movie no one’s ever heard of exerted appreciably more impact on my personal and creative evolution—and even on my forthcoming novel—than I’d heretofore considered, and how it had something profoundly meaningful to say to me, both then and now.\n\nTwo years ago, I published a post with recommendations for Irish-themed movies to help celebrate St. Patrick’s Day; among them, a long-forgotten crime drama from 1990 about the Irish Mob in Hell’s Kitchen called State of Grace, which had the cosmic misfortune of opening the very same week as Martin Scorsese’s GoodFellas. The latter, as I’m sure you know, was a box-office hit that deservedly claimed an immortal place in the cultural consciousness, while the former—starring no less than heavyweights Sean Penn, Ed Harris, Gary Oldman, Robin Wright, John Turturro, John C. Reilly, and Burgess Meredith—quietly disappeared from theaters within two weeks of release and promptly faded into obscurity. No one really saw it, and the bankruptcy of its studio, Orion Pictures, soon thereafter assured that it mostly remained unseen in the years to follow.\n\nMy cousin’s husband owned a video store out in Jersey at that time, and he was always bringing by screener copies—sometimes even bootlegs—of current films, which was how I first experienced both State of Grace and GoodFellas when I was fourteen. For a kid that had up till that point subsisted on a cinematic diet of almost exclusively Spielbergian fantasy, the comedies of John Hughes and Eddie Murphy, and the action extravaganzas of Stallone and Schwarzenegger, those two movies—‘cause I hadn’t yet seen The Godfather—were nothing short of revelatory.\n\nState of Grace was a particular favorite, and I even managed to score a copy of the promotional one-sheet from my local video shop in the Bronx when they were done with it, which hung in my bedroom throughout high school. The movie was my introduction to newly minted Oscar-winner Gary Oldman, and he delivers a searing, unsettling, heartbreaking performance that made me a fan for life. But by the mid-nineties, my secondhand VHS of Grace had gotten misplaced, and given the scarcity of the film’s availability, I haven’t had occasion—despite trying in 2016 for that best–of–St. Patty’s post—to see it since.\n\nUntil this month, when I found a wonderful Blu-ray reissue, limited to 3,000 units, and, like the story’s troubled protagonist, I ventured back into Hell’s Kitchen to reunite with some very old faces…\n\nA SORT OF HOMECOMING\n\nShot entirely on location in New York City in 1989, State of Grace tells the story of Terry Noonan (Penn), who returns to his hometown after a ten-year absence (for reasons he’d rather not make known) and resumes his relationship—both personal and professional—with the Flannerys: Frankie (Harris), the ambitious capo of a half-assed gang modeled after the real-life Westies; Jackie (Oldman), Frankie’s loose-cannon younger brother and henchman; and their sister Kathleen (Wright), the girl who got out and made good—and Terry’s first love. Being a mob movie, though, what starts as a happy reunion eventually spirals into a vortex of bloodletting and betrayal. The narrative is what Save the Cat! would classify as Institutionalized—a “Family Institution” tale about incompatible loyalties (as are GoodFellas and The Godfather).\n\nIt’s always a little tricky going back to a movie (or a book) you loved as a kid but haven’t seen since, because you run the very real risk of discovering it isn’t as good or as meaningful or as powerful as it seemed at the time. Sometimes these things, I’ve discovered, are better left remembered than revisited. Another 1990 bomb that nobody recollects, Christian Slater’s pirate-radio drama Pump Up the Volume, is a movie that resonated so intensely with me at that unhappy time in my life, I have by choice not looked at it again in a quarter century. However, I decided to take a chance on State of Grace.\n\nWeirdly, I recalled many passages of dialogue in Grace nearly verbatim, yet couldn’t predict as I watched it where each scene was going, or where the plot led next. Like memories of life itself, I remembered the moments with such vivid—almost tactile—clarity, but not necessarily their contextual place in the Big Picture. And I was delighted to discover, appraising it now as a storyteller myself, that the plot is elegantly simple, allowing all those small details—from the dive bars in the Kitchen to the vacant lots of the South Bronx—to live and breathe, to seep under your skin.\n\nEverything about this movie—from its unhurried pace, to its character-driven script, to its restrained performances (Oldman’s unhinged hooligan notwithstanding), to Ennio Morricone’s melancholic score—is hauntingly elegiac. State of Grace (purposefully) lacks GoodFellas wind-you-up kinetic energy. It’s wistful; it’s a lamentation for a doomed way of life: the period in which organized crime got chased out of New York (by then–District Attorney Rudy Giuliani) and corporate gentrification moved in (its own form of organized crime, in a way).\n\nChrist, these guys aren’t even hip mobsters, like the GoodFellas troika, at least having themselves a wee old time of livin’ on the edge; they’re wannabes (Frankie), or losers (Jackie), or victims of incurable self-torment (Terry). They don’t have prestige, or respect, or money; they’re just vermin, feeding off gutter scraps, yearning either for times gone by or times never to come. As remarkable and suspenseful and enthrallingly dramatic as Grace is, even all these years later, it isn’t hard to understand why it got whacked at the box office by GoodFellas: Scorsese’s saga seduces you into its decadent world, incrementally, then grabs you by the fuckin’ throat, whereas with State of Grace, director Phil Joanou peels back the tattered curtain on an already moribund way of life just in time for its pitiful death-croak. It’s less a morality play, like GoodFellas, than it is a bagpiped funeral dirge.\n\nSTATE OF MIND\n\nWhat is hard to fathom, looking back on the movie with middle-aged eyes, is precisely what I found so hypnotically relatable about it at fourteen, fifteen years old! Penn’s Terry Noonan, after all, was probably the first fictional antihero I ever empathized with. Prior to Terry, I’d exclusively admired unambiguous “white hats”: John McClane and Tango & Cash and all that early-era Steven Seagal shit, and one-note TV sleuths like Michael Knight and Thomas Magnum and Dennis Booker. Good guys were, above all, good—and psychologically uncomplicated. And then came State of Grace in all of its emotional intricacy and moral ambiguity, challenging my naïve perspective. That obviously made a bigger impression on me than I’d previously acknowledged.\n\nIt’s certainly had an influence on my writing in ways unexamined up till now, directly (if unconsciously) serving as an inspiration for my forthcoming novel Escape from Rikers Island. One of the key characters in the book, Dennis, who plays a small but crucial role, was himself a lowlife rent-a-thug for the Westies in the seventies and eighties. Is it possible I unknowingly named him for State of Grace screenwriter Dennis McIntyre?\n\nAlso like Grace, EFRI takes place on the mean streets of New York, and features as its heroes men who operate in its underworld—the real city behind the Disneyfied veneer. That world’s morals exist in a nebulous, gray-shaded territory that EFRI’s policeman protagonist is very much trying—with dubious success—to navigate: He’s a man who longs to be a white hat, but questions how realistic such fanciful Hollywood idealism is. He and the novel’s antihero, the shot caller of a violent street gang based out of Brooklyn, are themselves grappling with feelings of displacement in a gentrified city that no longer resembles the working-class bastion in which they came of age—the very culture Gary Oldman’s Jackie sees slipping away during the events of his story.\n\nHell, if all that weren’t enough, according to Joanou’s audio commentary, McIntyre’s original script for State of Grace even opened with an unfilmed action sequence depicting—wait for it—an escape from Rikers Island. How ‘bout that?\n\nBut none of that really explains why Grace seeded itself so prominently in my receptive imagination. Why did a kid who’d only a year earlier think the coiffed detectives of Miami Vice and 21 Jump Street emblemized the pinnacle of moral complexity suddenly find himself so taken with the tenebrous ethos of State of Grace? Terry and Jackie, et al., were men coming to grips—or, more accurately, not coming to grips—with disillusionment, with disenfranchisement. Their story was a requiem for the end of their particular era. In stark contrast, I was a student in his first year of high school!\n\nBut maybe, in retrospect, I was feeling a little elegiac myself at the time. The emotional simplicity of boyhood had given way to the hormonal complexity of adolescence. My parents had just divorced; I barely saw my father after that till his funeral a decade later. (It should say something that I was appalled by the copious alcohol consumption in State of Grace when I recently rewatched it, but thought absolutely nothing of it at fourteen.) As all that was underway, my best friend left the neighborhood, suddenly and painfully, to live with the other of his divorced parents, and for many years thereafter I thought he’d intentionally moved away from me (because, like a true egocentric thirteen-year-old, it never for a moment crossed my mind that what happened to him was in no way about me).\n\nAnd still reeling from all that, I found myself displaced from the familiar comfort of the halls of public school, where I’d enjoyed tremendous freedom with minimal oversight or accountability, and thrust into the regimented, buttoned-down structure of Jesuit prep school. Overnight, nothing in my life was the same as it had so reliably been. Only a year earlier, I’d had a very clear vision of where everything was headed—an idiotic John Hughes–inspired fantasy of infinite free-range teenage adventures with me and my little gang on the streets of the Bronx, just as life had always been.\n\n“But it was only an idea. Had nothin’ to do with the truth, it’s just… a fuckin’ idea, like… you believe in angels, or the saints, or that there’s such a thing as a state of grace. And you believe it. But it’s got nothin’ to do with reality. It’s just an idea. I mean, you got your ideas and you got reality. They’re all… they’re all fucked up.”—Terry Noonan in State of Grace\n\nAnd so perhaps it was that State of Grace spoke to the first bout of crushing disillusionment I’d ever experienced—the gap between how things are and how they ought to be; the reality that times change, unexpectedly and unceremoniously, and they never go back to how they were no matter how badly you wish otherwise. It was the right movie at the right time in my life. That no one saw it back in 1990 isn’t at all true; I saw it—and it affected me.\n\nIt gave me a healthy, private outlet to mourn what had been lost in my own life at that exact moment—to cope with the trauma and anger over the ground falling out—and it didn’t pull any punches or promise some happy ending, some deus ex machina resolution, that wasn’t coming for me. That it was so different from anything I’d ever seen up till that point probably accounts for how forcibly it imprinted its message on me; it stayed with me long after I lost touch with it. I see that now. The proof is in my own works of fiction.\n\nTERRY I HARDLY KNEW YE\n\nSo, that’s what the movie is to me: an elegy. And it works as such on so many thought-provoking levels. It grieves the loss of plebeian New York and its ethnic traditions, when the Irish-American district of Hell’s Kitchen, imperfect though it may’ve been, was rechristened by the incoming yuppies as “Clinton.” (I wonder what Oldman’s Jackie would think of the asshole hipsters who’ve since reinstated the neighborhood’s old sobriquet for its authenticity, man. I have no doubt he’d gleefully give them an authentic Hell’s Kitchen experience.) It certainly eulogizes (but in no way romanticizes) the Irish Mob, exterminated as it was by Giuliani’s RICO indictments.\n\nIt also, as Joanou points out in his commentary, was part of an inadvertent last hurrah for old-school mobster movies. That autumn, the genre essentially performed its swan song with five successive releases: First Grace, then GoodFellas, followed by Abel Ferrara’s King of New York, the Coen brothers’ Miller’s Crossing, and, in a fitting, full-circle coda, The Godfather, Part III (which Coppola had hoped to title, quite aptly, The Death of Michael Corleone).\n\nEven Hollywood itself was on the cusp of tectonic change, with the unprecedented opening-weekend grosses of 1989’s Batman begetting a new industrial model of all-in, big-budget tentpoles, their size and noise—on the subject of corporate homogenization—slowly but surely crowding out smaller, more thoughtful, more dramatic films. Those kinds of stories, like the mafia of our pop culture itself (The Sopranos), quietly migrated to the untamed, inconspicuous underground of cable television.\n\nAnd I guess, in a very personal way, Grace now operates as a kind of elegy for that transitional, pubescent period of my own youth. In my mid-thirties, I had a chance to chat with my aforementioned best friend—the one who moved away in eighth grade—about what he was going through at that time, and what I was feeling, and how the friendship of two emotionally whiplashed thirteen-year-olds became frayed by a series of misunderstandings and external circumstances neither one had any control over or comprehension of. All that bullshit’s in the rearview now, but our relationship, almost thirty years hence, motors on through the changing seasons, only improving with age.\n\nTerry Noonan went back to Hell’s Kitchen with the best of intentions: to look the past in the eye and come to terms with it. His efforts were met, if you’ll permit the spoiler-free understatement, with mixed results. But I know from his experiences—and mine, too—that reconnecting with old faces, whether we’re talking flesh-and-blood friends or fictional characters, can offer enlightenment and, if you’re open to it, catharsis. I’m sure my old pal Terry would agree it can even be fun—at least for a little while."
