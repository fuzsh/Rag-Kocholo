        "text": "Editor: Diane Labrosse\n\nCommissioning Editor: Thomas Maddux\n\nProduction Editor: Christopher Ball\n\nCopy Editor: Bethany Keenan\n\nA warm and very sincere thanks to the contributors to this roundtable for reviewing my book: The Road to Dien Bien Phu: A History of the First War for Vietnam. I know how time-consuming it is to read a book, especially one weighing in at over 500 pages, and then, on top of that, to pen such thoughtful and honest reviews of it. I would also like to thank the editors at H-Diplo for kindly organizing this roundtable.\n\nI do not have any ideological ax to grind in The Road to Dien Bien Phu. More than anything else, what drove me to write this book on the First Indochina War (1945-54) was my reading of Franz Fanon’s 1961 essay, The Wretched of the Earth.[45] As a Martiniquais partisan in the Front de libération nationale (FLN) battling the French during the Algerian War (1954–1962), Fanon was focused on the concept of “revolutionary violence” in a time of decolonization. While reading Fanon’s pamphlet, I was particularly struck by his fascination for what the Vietnamese had done to the French at Dien Bien Phu. How, he asked, had the Vietnamese, led by President Ho Chi Minh, generated the armed force capable of bringing down the French imperial army in a set-piece battle in this remote valley in northwestern Vietnam? Fanon must have asked this question knowing that the FLN had failed to generate the violence needed to defeat the same French army in conventional warfare in Algeria.\n\nIntrigued, I, too, wanted to understand how Ho Chi Minh had done this, and why no other movement of national liberation in the twentieth century ever “duplicated a Dien Bien Phu”—not in Algeria, not in Indonesia, Mozambique, the Congo, nor even in the recent “forever wars” in the Middle East. In crafting my response, I did not discard the power of nationalism as a mobilizing force, or the importance of Chinese training and military support for that matter. Nationalism was as important for Ho Chi Minh in his struggle for independence against the French as it was for President Ferhat Abbas leading the resistance government in Algeria against the same foe. But nationalism, I humbly submit, can condition outcomes; it cannot, alone, explain how Ho and his disciples defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu any more than it can serve as the unique factor making sense of how the Ukrainians have pushed back so hard against the invading Russian army in conventional clashes as I write.\n\nWhat I tried to do in my book was to tell the story of how Ho Chi Minh turned a ragtag guerrilla army, a “tiger” as he put it to a sympathetic American journalist in 1946, into a modern fighting force capable of bringing down a Western colonial army in modern, pitched battle in the open. Guerilla armies, after all, never fight “Dien Bien Phus.” They do not deploy artillery or use antiaircraft guns. They do not operate in regiments, let alone divisions (Ho had seven by 1954). Nor do they engage in trench warfare—ever. The Vietnamese did. That said, my goal was not to provide yet another entertaining battle history of what happened at Dien Bien Phu[46] or any other of the set-piece battles opposing the French and their Vietnamese adversaries during the First Indochina War.[47] I was interested in the “longer road,” the deeper forces at play, that made Dien Bien Phu possible. I wanted to explain how Ho actually transformed a highly decentralized, archipelago-like guerilla state into an increasingly consolidated single-party Communist state that was capable of running a large standing army and mobilizing hundreds of thousands of people for conventional and guerilla warfare in ways which Fanon could not have fathomed as his book went to press in 1961—but which the Chinese, Soviets, and North Koreans most assuredly could. I concluded my book by suggesting that Fanon could not really grasp this form of “revolutionary violence” because the author of The Wretched of the Earth was not privy to this Eurasian form of Communist warfare arcing from the Soviet Union in the early 1920s to northern Indochina in the mid-1950s by way of Communist China. As a member of this Communist community since the 1920s, at ease in Russian and Chinese (and not just French), Ho Chi Minh was. Fanon must have realized that all wars of decolonization are not alike.[48]\n\nI would like to thank Alex-Thai Dinh Vo for kindly sharing his family’s experiences from within the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) during the First (and Second) Indochina Wars. His beautifully told story takes us into the outer banks of the DRV archipelago state in areas located south of the imperial capital of Hue, better known during the Indochina War as Zone V. Alex-Thai Dinh Vo’s grandparents were among the hundreds of thousands of non-Communists who joined Ho Chi Minh in the war of independence against the French when it first broke out in 1945-46. The patriotic outpouring in those years was real. Alex-Thai Dinh Vo is also right that until the Chinese Communists came to power in late 1949 and threw their military, political, and diplomatic weight behind Ho, the Vietnamese Communists had operated what I call a “coalition state,” consisting of people of all political colors united by their common opposition to this second French colonial invasion of their country (the Japanese overthrew French Indochina at the close of the Second World War). The Communists lined up behind Ho may have been at the helm of important ministries and the army’s general staff in the DRV, but they were acutely aware of the fact that their control over this state in the early years was precarious at best (there were only 5,000 Communist members in 1945 out of a total Vietnamese population at the time of around 20 million people). Ho realized that he needed scores of competent non-Communists to help him run the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and its nascent army as the French Expeditionary Corps went on the offensive. He had no choice. The Communists also needed people like the Vo’s to feed guerilla fighters and then, from 1950, regular soldiers organized in much bigger formations engaging the French army directly. If scholars have increasingly paid attention to the non-Communist Vietnamese who joined the French as part of the “Associated State of Vietnam” in 1949 and then its postcolonial avatar that emerged in 1955 in the form of the Republic of Vietnam,[49] we know little about the tens of thousands of people like the Vo’s, who joined the independent government run by Ho on the grounds that there could be no collaboration with the colonialists.\n\nMy book is admittedly focused on the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as Claire Tran correctly notes. I do, however, take up the non-Communists in my narrative. I treat in detail the Communist-led assault on the nationalist parties in 1946. I certainly did not ignore the Associated States of Indochina the French brought to life with their partners in 1949.[50] But as Alex-Thai Dinh Vo recognizes, I was particularly interested in the non-Communists who joined the DRV. I intentionally wove their stories into mine, in particular the moving memoirs of Nguyen Cong Luan, whose father was a member of the anti-Communist Vietnamese Nationalist Party, or VNQDD, who put his ideological differences on hold and joined the DRV in 1945 in opposition to the French. He refused repeated colonial offers to extricate him from the DRV in exchange for his collaboration with the French-created Associated State of Vietnam. But the Communists also mistrusted this man despite his impeccable anticolonial credentials. In the end, his non-Communist nationalism was such that it landed him in jail in the late 1940s where the Communists let him die. Luan and his father were not the only case I explore in my book. As I point out in chapter 1, the powerful Communist organizer Le Duc Tho was furious to learn that non-Communists within the Viet Minh front were actually challenging the Communist party’s right to lead the resistance against the French.[51] Those who want to understand the origins of civil war in Vietnam might want to look in places like this, too.\n\nAlex-Thai Dinh Vo is also right that one of the things I try to show in my book is how, thanks to the support provided from early 1950 by Mao Zedong, the leader of communist China, the Vietnamese Communists in charge of the coalition state were able to light a slow burning coup d’état against their non-Communist allies within the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. They did this when Ho Chi Minh willingly aligned the DRV with the Eurasian Communist bloc (the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, North Korea, and China), its statecraft, models, and methods: the Stalinist cult of personality; Sino-Soviet mass mobilization techniques in the form of “hero worship” and “emulation campaigns”; Maoist “rectification campaigns” to homogenize the army and state under party control; massive amounts of Communist propaganda; the socialist nationalization of industry, banking, and the economy; and the introduction of the “agricultural tax” and “land reform” in the countryside. Those non-Communists inside the archipelago who opposed this communization of the coalition state could resist; but in so doing they risked engaging in a civil war against the Communists within the DRV. They faced repression from an army and security service that was increasingly under the Communist party’s firm control. Some left the DRV to cross over to the “Associated State of Vietnam” hoping that the French would grant its leader, the former emperor, Bao Dai, the independence they had so stubbornly refused to Ho Chi Minh. Tens of thousands of other non-Communist nationalists stayed put to continue resisting the French. They kept their political heads down, hoping that the coalition state would survive, as Ho had promised once the colonialists had been defeated.[52]\n\nIt was not to be, though. During the second half of the conflict, Ho and his Communist entourage began transforming the democratic state that was born in 1945 into a single-party Communist state of an authoritarian kind like its sister states running from Eastern Europe to North Korea by way of the Soviet Union and China. Ho was no “Asian Tito” during the Indochina War. Ho even relied on Leninist notions of federalism (which were used to hold the Russian empire together in the Communist form of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) to justify the creation of Associated States of a Communist kind for Laos (the Pathet Lao) and Cambodia (the Khmer Issarak) under Vietnamese Communist control. They mirrored the monarchical ones which the French created for Bao Dai in Vietnam, King Sisavavong in Laos, and Norodom Sihanouk in Cambodia. Stein Tønnesson and I will have to agree to disagree on federalism: I maintain that French colonialists and Vietnamese Communists saw in federalism a strategy of political governance allowing them to administer supranational entities of colonial and Communist design on their terms, each of which denied their respective “Indochinese associated states,” by definition, full sovereignty.[53] What is more, by creating these two sets of Associated States of Indochina from 1949, President Ho Chi Minh and his French nemesis at that time, the High Commissioner for Indochina, Léon Pignon, ensured that civil war would spread to western Indochina with terrible consequences for the Laotians and Cambodians over the next half century.\n\nI accept Alex-Thai Dinh Vo’s critique that I could have pushed my story to 1956. There is, indeed, a case to be made for taking the war-driven communization of the DRV up to that year when Ho finally ended the radical land reform he and his party had initiated in 1953. I admittedly balked at doing so given that the book had already become too big. I would have needed to add another chapter to get from 1954 to 1956. And even then, how would I bring my other thematic chapters up to speed, if I had to extend each one by almost three years? I am confident that Alex-Thai Dinh Vo’s work on this topic and that of others of his pathbreaking generation will do a better job than I in dealing with the period running up to 1956 and beyond. They already have.[54]\n\nMany thanks to my colleagues and friends, Stein Tønnesson and Claire Tran, for their penetrating critique of my use of the concept of “War Communism”. To be clear, I used this notion, which was first developed by Vladimir Lenin during the Russian Civil War (1917–1922), as a heuristic device in my book for trying to understand how a specific form of Communist warfare emerged from within this Eurasian arc that aimed both at fighting war and using it simultaneously to drive state-building under the increasing control of the Communist Party. This is what Lenin aimed to do coming out of the First World War; Mao Zedong added to it during the struggle against the Japanese during the Second one and then during the Chinese civil war. Tønnesson and Tran do not agree that Ho Chi Minh would have embarked his countrymen on such a coercive road to victory along the lines I detail in the second half of my book. As Tønnesson writes:\n\nI surmise that the ability of Vietnam’s “War Communists” to mobilize the people during 1950-54 was not primarily due to imported Russian, Chinese and Korean techniques or from radical land reform, but rather to the popular legitimacy that the DRV and the person of Ho Chi Minh had gained in the coalition period.\n\nI would like to emphasize that I do believe that Ho Chi Minh was a nationalist, and I do believe that nationalism (“popular legitimacy” as Tønnesson puts it) was a very important factor explaining the Vietnamese victory over the French at Dien Bien Phu. For the record, Communists, like anti-Communists, can be patriots. But at the risk of repeating myself, nationalism can condition outcomes; it cannot alone explain the end result, whether it be of Communist design or not. French revolutionaries coming to the defense of the young Republic in 1792 at Valmy were patriots of the highest order. However, the leaders of the embattled Republic quickly realized that “popular legitimacy” was not enough to move French people to turn over their crops or give up their sons to the war state in sufficient quantities and numbers to prevail on the battlefield. In order to move enough people to fight in the Revolutionary Wars in the 1790s (and those of Napoléon Bonaparte in the ensuing years), the Directoire imposed military conscription and passed a general mobilization law, better known together in French as the levée en masse. Ho Chi Minh had no choice but to adopt the same coercive state methods in order to take the battle to the French in the open from 1950. To that end, Ho had already decreed conscription in late 1949 and imposed a general mobilization law a few months later. These were landmark decisions in the military, political, economic, and social history of the First Indochina War. All the more so when General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny as High Commissioner of Indochina imposed the same things on his Associated State of Vietnam in 1951 in the form of a colonial levée en masse and Bao Dai let him do it (colonial “Association” required it). No other war of decolonization, to my knowledge, ever witnessed the imposition of this dual levée en masse of the Vietnamese populations across the board. Does this make the Indochina War a “total war” as Claire Tran suggests? I’m not so sure. Following the advice of Hew Strachan and Talbot Imlay, I avoided using this concept in my book. Their articles convinced me that the concept of “total war” should be used with great caution.[55]\n\nBut Ho went further as a Communist when he adopted a range of specifically Sino-Soviet methods allowing him to use the war—indeed to ramp it up—to consolidate his party’s control over the DRV coalition state, its society, and army with the Communist tools Ho knew from his time in the Soviet Union and China since the 1920s:again, the cult of personality, models for hero worship, emulation competitions, rectification campaigns, recipes for massive propaganda drives, the socialization of the economy, the agricultural tax, and land reform. “Land reform” is but one tool in the War Communist chest. It is the entire repertoire—including the levée en masse—that differentiates Vietnam from Algeria in terms of statecraft and warfare, but aligns Ho’s Vietnam squarely with wartime China, the Soviet Union, and North Korea.[56] Some 200 advisors Mao sent to work alongside Ho from 1950 onwards not only helped the Vietnamese create the People’s Army of Vietnam or PAVN, they also introduced these Sino-Soviet methods, based on their own experiences during two decades of war in China. The Vietnamese applied them in the crucible of their anticolonial war to consolidate their hold over the state, master and deploy military force of a modern kind, and, at the same time, take control and mobilize people in the hundreds of thousands to serve the state, feed its bureaucrats, and man and feed the newly created PAVN’s divisions from areas along the border with China to lower central Vietnam below Hue, not far from where the Vo’s once lived.\n\nTuong Vu is right to point out the importance of the work of Charles Tilly on how war makes states, and those states make war at the same time. But as Tuong Vu also correctly notes, Tilly was most interested in monarchical states opposing each other in early modern Europe. In my book, I tried to push Tilly’s insights beyond Europe and into the twentieth century. I intentionally shifted the focus of the study of statecraft to wars of decolonization that occurred in the non-Western world, where European colonial states went up against weak anti-colonialist states of an archipelago kind, but whose leaders were fiercely determined to forge states in and of violence. This explains why I draw heavily in the book on the comparison between what happened in Vietnam and Algeria during what I call the long French “Indo-Algerian War” (1945–1962). I also tried to push the study of Vietnam’s statecraft during the First Indochina War into the Communist world, into what I refer to as a “Eurasian communist arc” (436-37) running from the Soviet Union to Thai Nguyen. My goal was to try to show how Ho Chi Minh tapped into a specific type of “War Communism” (Lenin’s term) that was unknown in world history until the end of World War I. This gave rise to a unique form of communist warfare of a very coercive kind by the mid-twentieth century.\n\nI concur entirely with Claire Tran that Chinese assistance to the Vietnamese was essential to Ho’s ability to take the war to the French on the battlefield and I say so in my book. I also state clearly in my book that American assistance kept the French in the war (I went so far as to argue that had the Americans not sent aid by 1951, de Lattre would have lost the Red River delta). I agree, too, that Volodymyr Zelensky could never have taken on the Russians without the Atlantic alliance standing behind him, providing arms and training like the Chinese did for Ho Chi Minh. My point, however, is that Zelensky never had to create a professional army from scratch or, at the same time, forge a state capable of running it in a conventional war with Russia. The Vietnamese Communists and non-Communists in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam did. The Communist mobilization techniques Ho applied were important, for they helped Ho create a state that was capable of mobilizing—yes, through coercion—the hundreds of thousands of civilians needed to run the human logistical services I describe carefully in my book. In Ukraine, and this is extremely important, Zelensky’s army can rely on mechanized logistics—transport trucks, trains, helicopters, and airplanes. Only at Dien Bien Phu did “this”—mechanized logistics, the availability of transport trucks—become a real possibility for the Vietnamese. Until then, the Vietnamese, like the North Koreans and Chinese Communists before them, had to rely on human logistics. How these states could do this requires explanation.\n\nTønnesson states in his review of my book that the popular mobilization and patriotic legitimacy which David Marr discussed for 1945–1946 in Vietnam: State, War, and Revolution could have responded to the needs in manpower and resources for the post-1950 period.[57] That is my point: it could not. The mobilization Marr analyzed in the early years of the war (his book only covers the period from mid-1945 to early 1947) was sufficient to fight a guerilla war similar to the one the Indonesians were operating against the Dutch and the Algerians would run against the French. But the “state capacity” of the DRV as it existed in early 1947 could never have responded to the requirements in logistics (people power) and supplies (gathering rice in massive quantities) needed to execute eight set-piece battles between Cao Bang and Dien Bien Phu. A seven-division strong PAVN was not a “tiger”; by early 1954 it had become an “elephant” weighing in at around 200,000 hungry men. Ho Chi Minh and his Communist entourage and Mao and his Chinese advisors all knew this and acted accordingly with the war communist methods including the levée en masse mentioned above. This, then, is how the Vietnamese guerilla state of 1945–1946 became something very different from 1950, as Ho pushed his party’s control and state capacity to mobilize people and resources down to the district and village levels wherever he could. The FLN would never do this. The Chinese had already done so.\n\nI would like to thank Martin Grossheim and Claire Tran for recognizing the brutality of the First Indochina War. If we can believe the French specialist of the First Indochina War, Bernard Fall, as many as one million Vietnamese died between 1945 and 1954, the overwhelming majority of whom were civilians.[58] Vietnamese sources put the number at half a million.[59] Even if we accept the lower number, this makes the First Indochina War the most violent war of decolonization of the twentieth century. I tried to show at different stages in my book how and why the First Indochina War became such a brutal affair. Part of the reason is this shift to conventional warfare and the use of modern arms like artillery and napalm. This of course led to more intense and deadly battlefield confrontations from 1950.\n\nBut part of it is also due to the fact that the borders of the archipelago state, the zones where Ho’s islands bumped up against those of the French colonial federation and those of its Vietnamese allies, were dangerous places for the people living there. Mindboggling violence could occur in these borderland regions when one side decided to push in administratively, militarily, or both on the other side’s territory in the form of “pacification operations.” Some of the worst atrocities of the Indochina War occurred in villages caught in this savage war of sovereignties that broke out repeatedly across the archipelago and claimed an untold number of civilian lives. The violence was indeed often committed by Vietnamese against Vietnamese; but let us be clear that the French advocated from the outset the use of civil war as a strategy and, in so doing, increased the level of violence of their colonial war by arming one side against the other in order to keep Indochina in the empire as part of the French Union. The powerful French administrator in the late 1940s, Léon Pignon, was but one advocate of colonial-backed civil war. De Lattre was another. Colonial-driven civil war wasn’t such a new idea, however. “Pacification”, as I argue in my book, was intrinsically a form of “colonial-fired civil war”. So were the Associated States of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia Pignon brought to life in 1949.[60] And by pushing back against both at the village level, the leaders of the DRV (Communist and non-Communist anticolonialists mind you) only made the Indochina War all the more destructive in terms of the civil strife it created in the borderlands. Those who paid the highest price were the tens of thousands of innocent Vietnamese civilians sucked into this bloody maelstrom that must have provided Fall with that ghastly number, if true, of one million dead (Curiously, to my knowledge, Fall never said a word about the massive civilian suffering that occurred on the French watch during the First Indochina War)."
