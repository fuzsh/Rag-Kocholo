        "text": "The “Endless Drill” & Wilson\n\nAfter Gatsby’s death, Nick describes the events as an “endless drill” of reporters coming in to glance at Gatsby’s body; keep in mind, though, that barely anyone shows their condolences for Gatsby’s death. On the contrary, disgusting rumors were spread about Gatsby’s after his death, and barely any remorse was shown: “Most of these reports were a nightmare–grotesque, circumstantial, eager and untrue” (163).\n\nThe “endless drill” also pertains to Gatsby’s unstoppable quest to achieve the American Dream; it sets the tone for the American Dream in general. As Americans, we are always on an endless, ambitious path to achieve our Dreams — no matter the obstacles.\n\nInterestingly enough, Catherine (Mr. McKee’s wife) stands up for her sister, and dismisses the rumors of Gatsby and Myrtle as simply untrue; it is interesting that someone from the Valley of Ashes (someone who is seen as being not worthy enough by aristocrats and the higher social class) deems these rumors as being untrue and shows class for the death. This highlights on the fact that even when three people have died (all people from the bottom of the social ladder; Gatsby, included, because he did not earn his money in an honest way and was originally from a poverty-stricken family), horrifying rumors are still lingering; this further evidences the corruption and loss of morals that Gatsby’s supposed “friends” possess.\n\nOnce Catherine dismisses the rumors, however, Wilson is made out to look like he was “deranged by grief” (164). Surely, Wilson was mourning and was possessed by the events that occurred, but as we learn, it is really Tom who provokes Wilson to kill Gatsby. Eventually then, Wilson leaves the earth being known as a deranged mad man (when in reality, he was an incredibly nice man before Tom wrecked his life). The rumors about Gatsby eventually come to an end because Catherine dismisses them, but also because Gatsby’s supposed friends did not find a need to care anymore: “…because no one else was interested–I mean, with that intense personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end” (164). As a result, Gatsby’s name first becomes equated with “grotesque” rumors, and eventually, becomes equated with nothing. We discussed yesterday that part of Gatsby’s American Dream is to climb the social ladder and to make a name for himself; for example, Tom is recognized and respected in society simply because he hails from the Buchanans. Gatsby bended over backwards to achieve this same social status; unfortunately, all that he has worked for (his wealth, his material possessions, and his facade as an aristocrat) has not only failed to obtain Daisy, but it has alsofailed to gain him any genuine human companionship. Therefore, Gatsby’s funeral proves that his American Dream has inevitably failed.\n\nWealth Does Not Promise Human Companionship\n\nAs we know, Daisy does not call; in fact, Nick calls to see if she is coming to Gatsby’s funeral, and she and Tom refuse to pick up the telephone; supposedly, they have left East Egg. This not only evidences Daisy’s callousness, but it may also exemplify her original intent; was Daisy ever going to leave Gatsby? Probably not. Considering her lavish lifestyle, Gatsby provides Daisy with an outlet or a source of entertainment. Some of us discussed yesterday that perhaps she did not come to the funeral because she just cannot handle Gatsby’s death; some of us disagreed, however, and said that this proves the type of person Daisy actually is: she is a callous, has a cold heart, and has inevitably led Gatsby on this entire time. As Nick states in Chapter 7, Daisy looked as though she was never going to follow through with leaving Tom and be with Gatsby; on the contrary, she just wants to have fun. To a large degree, this is solidified by her not even entertaining Gatsby’s funeral, nor even acknowledging Nick’s phone calls. One can even go as far to say that Daisy does not go to Gatsby’s funeral because she does not want to associate herself with an individual who is being scorned by such horrifying rumors; again, she is more concerned with her social status and her name in society. She does not want her reputation to be scarred further by Gatsby’s existence and now his death. Therefore, there is a large amount of evidence that proves that Daisy never loved Gatsby.\n\nBecause Daisy nor Wolfsheim (Gatsby’s supposed best friend) never show their face at Gatsby’s funeral, Nick feels responsible for Gatsby; although Nick has his flaws (he can be a bit of a liar from time to time, and contradicts himself by judging people when he says that he is “inclined to reserve judgments”), he does actually care for Gatsby:\n\n“I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he lay and reassure him: ‘I’ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don’t worry. Just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you–\n\nHere, we not only see again Nick’s genuine feelings for Gatsby, but we also see how Nick feels responsible for Gatsby; ironically enough, Nick knew the real Gatsby, and still admires and is willing to attend his funeral despite the grotesque rumors and the fact that people view Gatsby negatively. Nick also wants to prove that Gatsby did not work his entire life for nothing. Nick has an immense amount of empathy for Gatsby. In a way, bringing people to Gatsby’s funeral proves that Gatsby’s dream is not dead, but is still present and alive after his death. Unfortunately, the funeral scene proves this to be incorrect.\n\nGatsby’s Involvement in Selling Counterfeit Bonds\n\nWe realize in this Chapter that Gatsby is also involved in selling counterfeit bonds (which attributed to the 1929 Stock Market Crash). A man by the name of Slagle calls, demanding to speak to Gatsby. However, once Nick tells him that he isn’t Gatsby and that Gatsby is indeed dead, this man hangs up the telephone immediately. This scene evidences two things: for one, up until this point, we did not know that Gatsby was also involved in selling counterfeit or uninsured bonds; secondly, the fact that this man he was speaking to hangs up the phone immediately exemplifies the lack of morals and corruption that enveloped 1920s society. As opposed to feeling empathy that Gatsby has just been murdered, this man disconnects the line because he is concerned with getting in trouble due to the illegal activity he is involved in. Similarly to Wolfsheim, the men Gatsby does business with do not care for him; they are from a “different generation”, meaning they do not get caught up in emotions or sentimentality. Gatsby, on the other hand, is the exact opposite; one can argue, however, that Gatsby’s emotional and sentimental qualities are what lead him to his inevitable downfall.\n\nGatsby’s Father – Mr. Gatz\n\nThe fact that Gatsby’s father even exists proves that Gatsby was also lying about his family; he had initially told Nick that all of his family was dead, remember? What is interesting about Gatz is that he states that Gatsby could have been something important if he had lived longer:\n\n“If he’d of lived, he’d of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill. He’d of helped build up the country” (168).\n\nAs much as we love Gatsby, his American Dream does not embody these qualities; members of the 1920s society are not concerned with building up the country or leaving back a legacy. On the contrary, they are concerned with obtaining wealth, social mobility, and material possessions. Obviously, Gatsby is not vapid like Tom and Daisy, but he still does possess these aspirations that define America — wealth, success, stability, etc. His father, on the other hand, is clearly from a different generation; in addition, he is from the West, clearly indicating that there are different morals and ideals in the West, as opposed to the East. Interestingly enough, Gatsby’s father compares him to James J. Hill. James J. Hill was referred to as the “Empire Builder” in that he built railroads across the Midwest, and died with a net worth in excess of fifty million dollars. Clearly, Gatsby differs from Hill, which is outlined in Nick’s “uncomfortable” reply. Gatsby’s dream is not to leave back a legacy or to build up a country; like so many Americans during the 1920s, their interest was to be able to participate in consumerism, and was more so focused on individuality or reinventing one’s identity. While there is nothing wrong with this, it is important to note that there is a stark difference between both versions of the American Dream.\n\nBoth dreams, in a way, are dead in this novel; as we discussed yesterday, Gatsby’s dream turned out to be an ILLUSION (with an I… that was my idiotic error), meaning that his dream was just a mirage — it wasn’t actually attainable. His father’s idea of the American Dream is also dead; nowhere do we see this kind of American Dream throughout the novel (someone who is interested in building the country, and leaving behind a legacy that is to be admired). Therefore, these two versions of the American Dream, are either dead or unattainable. This is Fitzgerald’s analysis and criticism of the American Dream.\n\nGatsby’s Funeral Scene\n\nFurthermore, Gatsby’s Funeral Scene exemplifies the death of the American Dream, or the fact that it is completely unattainable: we will all eventually die with no shelter, but what is striking about Gatsby’s death is that his grave is the complete opposite of his luxurious mansion. Contrary to his mansion, Gatsby is now underground with no shelter, emphasizing on the fact that his wealth did not make him die any differently, nor did it bring any of his supposed “friends” and loved ones to his funeral. Fitzgerald also uses setting to display how the American Dream is unattainable and dead; the fact that it is raining on Gatsby’s funeral further indicates that now that Gatsby is dead, his wealth nor his “friends” provide him any shelter from the gloomy, cold weather.\n\nNick & Tom\n\nNick sees Tom in the city much later after Gatsby’s death, and walks away from him for fear that Tom might see him; he is clearly not interested in conversing with Tom. However, Tom sees Nick and calls him “crazy” for not shaking his hand. Tom then reveals to Wilson that he told Wilson that Gatsby was having an affair with Myrtle and that he ran over Myrtle; he seems to justify his explanation to Wilson for two reasons: one being that Gatsby deserved it, and two being that Wilson came to his house with a revolver in his hand. Regardless, we see that the social barrier between East Egg and West Egg (and the Valley of Ashes) contributes a lot to the death of Gatsby; Nick states that to Tom, his actions are “entirely justified” (179). Again, this highlights that because Tom is from East Egg, treating Gatsby, Myrtle, and Wilson with such “carelessness” is just an attribute that he has due to his social class. Indeed, Tom and Daisy are therefore “careless people” (179) who “smash up” peoples’ lives, do not clean up the mess they have both created, and leave behind the broken glass. This is simply the nature of aristocratic East Egg.\n\nThrough critiquing these two characters, Fitzgerald is criticizing an America that is supposed to be full of equal opportunity; how can equal opportunities — or the American Dream — exist if people like Daisy and Tom maintain most of the power and the wealth? Social barriers have not only kept these individuals down, but they have killedthem as well. This is a reoccurring criticism that Fitzgerald incorporates into The Great Gatsby. It is imperative that you understand this — regardless of whether or not you agree with Fitzgerald’s criticism.\n\nAfter Gatsby’s Death (Please do not copy anything verbatim for your essay)\n\nAfter Gatsby’s death, Nick leaves back to his hometown in the Midwest. However, before he goes, he spends time in New York to distract himself from Gatsby’s abandoned mansion and from Gatsby’s chaotic death altogether.\n\n“I spent my Saturday nights in New York, because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden” (179)\n\nWhat may this description symbolize? For one, they may symbolize the summer of Gatsby — the summer when Gatsby tried to fulfill his idea of the American Dream. However, these things no longer exist anymore; instead, Nick describes them as being “faint” in the distance, meaning he can hear them but he cannot reach them. They are no longer tangible. This also alludes to Gatsby’s American Dream; it was always faint in the background and like the past, Gatsby could recall its existence but he could never reach for it and have it in his very hands.\n\nNick describes Gatsby’s now abandoned house as a “huge incoherent failure of a house” (179). Why might he describe Gatsby’s once luxurious mansion in such a negative way? For one, the house was supposed to behave as a catalyst in fulfilling his idea of the American Dream; it was right across the street from Daisy, it was supposed to turn him into a status symbol (meaning he would be recognized and admired by Old Money), and it was supposed to bring him genuine, human companionship. Unfortunately, this was not the case; like the abandoned house, Gatsby could never fit in with Old Money, and always stuck out awkwardly. His now abandoned house re-emphasizes Gatsby’s inability to climb the social ladder, and fully fit in with Old Money. Therefore, we see the novel as more of a story about class, rather than simply a love story (which is what the film makes it out to be).\n\nIn addition, Gatsby’s house does not only stick out awkwardly, but it is now a place that receives criticism, obscene graffiti, and overall, is mocked by society. In effect, the reputation he worked so hard to obtain has only equated to a house that receives criticism and mockery on a regular basis.\n\nThe Green Light V. The Pastoral Green\n\nNick looks across the shore on page 180, and sees that the only light that is visible is a “shadowy, moving glow” (180). The lack of light indicates that Gatsby’s dream is dead, being that the green light once signified Gatsby’s American Dream (Daisy, wealth, status, stability, recognition, Old Money). This one, shadowy moving glow could symbolize the last remnants of Gatsby; although the light is faint, there is still some part of him out there. Like the faint light, one can argue that the American Dream is also faint in that it appears there but it is not exactly attainable in this novel.\n\nNick then begins to image the Dutch settlers, who first inhabited New York before it appears the way it does today; he says it must have looked like a “fresh, green breast of a new world” (180). This differs immensely with Gatsby’s green light. Contrary to Gatsby’s green light, the pastoral green symbolizes purity, and a world of opportunity that is free from corruption; Gatsby’s green light, on the other hand, symbolizes wealth, material possessions, status, and a need to rise above the social ladder in order to be recognized and participate in consumerism. It also symbolizes the need to climb away from the Valley of Ashes, and to live a life full of opportunity. Unfortunately, this need to fulfill the “green light” brings corruption, violence and greed; the green pastoral, however, connects back to a utopian world of morals — a world that was pure, before we, as the human race, destroyed it to suit society’s expectations of what defines a real, admirable American: “Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’s house” (180). Therefore, Nick is really critiquing 1920s greed and culture here — a culture that America deems to be correct and honorable; a culture that if one does not abide by it, they cannot be recognized nor respected.\n\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter–tomorrow, we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther…and one fine morning—–\n\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, born back ceaselessly into the past.”\n\nDespite the obstacles, Gatsby still believes in the American Dream (the green light) — he believes that it will allow him to live a better life, enjoy real human companionship, and allow him to participate in the same opportunities that Old Money participates in. He believes in the sensual, delightful future that year by year goes farther and father away before us. We are all stuck in the past to some degree, and year by year, it becomes impossible to reinvent or recreate it. Year by year, it becomes more faint — just like the shadowy, faint light on the Sound. It eludes us (meaning the past escapes from our grip), yet we chase after it anyway. Like Gatsby, many of us still believe in the American Dream, and our ambition convinces us to go up against the obstacles — no matter how dire or impossible they may seem.\n\nThe “—–” indicates that one fine morning, like Gatsby, we wake up and realize that our dreams cannot be achieved. Yet, we beat on anyway; we are all little boats that go up against a huge current in order to achieve our idea of the American Dream. This highlights on Fitzgerald’s criticism that the American Dream is not tangible, nor attainable. But, no matter the obstacles, we still believe that the American Dream is possible. Like Gatsby, we are sometimes born back ceaselessly into the past, meaning that we are unwilling to let the past go, and we are unwilling to let our dreams go unfulfilled. Americans, like Gatsby, are part of this “endless drill” in trying to recreate the past.\n\nFitzgerald is critiquing our society, but in a way, he is also complimenting it; he admires our ambition as Americans. No matter how many obstacles we go up against, we will not give up on our dreams. Like Gatsby, we never lose hope — and in a way, these are characteristics that are undeniably American and are incredibly admirable; like Gatsby, many of us never lose hope in our dreams.\n\nComment on whether or not you agree with Fitzgerald’s criticism of the American Dream.\n\nComment on Nick’s relationship with Gatsby by the end of the novel.\n\nComment on the ending of Gatsby — what did you think?\n\nAlthough I did not mention it in this post, feel free to comment on the last conversation that happens between Nick & Jordan."
