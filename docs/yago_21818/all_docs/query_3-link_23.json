For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nâSummary\n\nThings Fall Apart is set in a fictional group of Igbo villages called Umuofia, around the beginning of the twentieth century. The first half of the novel is dedicated to an almost anthropological depiction of Igbo village life and culture through following the life of the protagonist Okonkwo. Okonkwo is the greatest wrestler and warrior alive in the nine villages and beyond. He has dedicated his life to achieving status and proving his strength to avoid becoming like his father Unoka â a lazy, improvident, but gentle man. Weakness is Okonkwoâs greatest fear. After men in another village kill a woman from Umuofia, a boy named Ikemefuna is given to Umuofia as compensation and lives in Okonkwoâs compound until the Gods decide his fate. Ikemefuna quickly becomes part of Okonkwoâs family; he is like a brother to Okonkwoâs son Nwoye and is secretly loved by Okonkwo as well. Over the next three years, the novel follows Okonkwoâs family through harvest seasons, religious festivals, cultural rituals, and domestic disputes. Okonkwo is shown to be more aggressive than other Igbo men and is continually criticized and rebuked by the village for his violence and temper. When the Oracle of the Hills and Caves decides that Ikemefuna must be killed, Okonkwo is warned by a respected elder to have no hand in the boyâs death because Ikemefuna calls him âfatherâ. However, afraid of being thought weak, when Ikemefuna runs to Okonkwo in hope of protection, Okonkwo delivers the fatal blow. Ikemefunaâs brutal death deeply distresses Nwoye who becomes afraid of his father.Â\n\nAt the end of Part One, Okonkwo accidentally kills a clansman at a funeral after his faulty gun explodes and is exiled to his motherland, Mbanta. During his exile, British missionaries arrive in Mbanta and establish a church. Nwoye, disillusioned with his own culture and Gods after Ikemefunaâs death, is attracted to Christianity and is an early convert. This is a heartbreaking disappointment to Okonkwo. When Okonkwo and his family return from exile after seven years they find that the missionaries and colonial governors have established Umuofia as the center of their new colonial government. Clashes of culture and morality occur, and as the British make the Igbo more dependent on them through introducing trade and formal education, the Igbo way of life is continually undermined. When a Christian convert unmasks an egwugwu during a tribal ritual, a sin amounting to the death of an ancestral spirit, the egwugwu burn down the village church. The men who destroyed the church are arrested and humiliated by the District Commissioner, and Okonkwo beheads a court messenger at a village council in rebellion. When none of his clansmen rise with him against the British, Okonkwo realizes his culture and way of life is lost and commits suicide in despair. Suicide is a crime against the Earth Goddess, Ani, so Okonkwo is left to rot above ground in the Evil Forest, like his father Unoka â a shameful fate he spent his life desperate to avoid. The final paragraph, written from the perspective of the District Commissioner, reduces Okonkwoâs life to a single sentence about his death in his planned book The Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of The Lower Niger. Achebe has filled an entire novel with evidence of the complexity and sophistication of Okonkwoâs individual and social life and the District Commissionerâs casual dismissal and belittling of him causes us to flinch with horror and dismay. This is a metaphor for the reduction of Igbo culture in the eyes of its colonizers.Â\n\nThe title gives away the plot of the novel and anticipates the collapse of Okonkwo and his society. Things Fall Apart is about the connection between the tragic downfall of Okonkwo, who fate and temperamental weakness combine to destroy, and the destruction of his culture and society as the Igbo way of life is assailed by forces they do not understand and are unprepared to face.Â\n\nThemes\n\nA Full and Fair Representation of Ibo Traditional Life\n\nThe first part of the novel presents the traditional world of the Ibo with specificity and vibrancy. The imbedded descriptions of the patterns of interaction, daily routines and seasonal rituals of Ibo life creates an overwhelming impression of community and shared culture. We see the established system of values which regulates collective life and how closely related this is to natural cycles and environments. The Iboâs moral values are contained in sayings and stories, rituals and festivals. Achebe depicts a comprehensive and sustaining social, spiritual, economic, agricultural, and legal order. (Chapters to consider: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12, 19)\n\nWhile Ibo society is marked by the internal coherence of its organization and the poetry of its rituals, this coherence is partially formed by the repression of the individual and the inflexibility of social norms. Achebe shows the violence, dehumanization, and discrimination vulnerable groups experience in Umuofia due to the rigid adherence to tradition and superstition. This includes the customary abandonment of newborn twins, the sacrificial murder of Ikemefuna in the name of justice, and the discriminatory caste structure that denies inclusion to the osu (Chapters 7, 18).\n\nObierikaâs questioning of the stern logic of some customs suggests that many laws are enacted from a sense of duty and inevitability rather than from a firm conviction in their justice or efficacy (Chapter 13). The cultural demand for conformity places a huge moral and psychological burden on individuals who must reckon with the sometimes heartless will of the gods. This internal tension is epitomized in the character of Okonkwo, discussed below.Â Â\n\nClash of Cultures\n\nWhen the Ibo are confronted with rival institutions a mirror is held up to their society. Fall Apart honestly considers and reflects on Ibo practices, customs, values, and beliefs. The novel is a frank articulation of the nature of the African past and its relevance to the present and future. Achebe wants to illuminate Ibo culture to dispense with lingering colonial prejudices, but he is not sentimental or nostalgic for the past. Instead he is shifting through it to identify the valuable aspects of Ibo culture to bring into the future and help define Nigeriaâs post-independence identity.\n\nAchebe recognises that the colonial encounter which led, swiftly and seemingly inevitably, to the disintegration of Ibo culture revealed its profound weaknesses. Achebe suggests that with the arrival and contrast against another culture, a cultural reckoning was inevitable for the Ibo. However, cultural reckoning and revaluation is not the same thing as destruction and erasure. The British colonialists were a hostile force seeking cultural domination. By pointing out some of the weaknesses of the Ibo tradition, Achebe in no way excuses or justifies colonial domination or diminishes the pain and tragedy of the cultural erasure that occurred.\n\nColonial Domination\n\nThe anti-colonial position and purpose of the novel is powerfully clear. Achebe depicts the process of colonial initial establishment and the resultant cultural suspension of Ibo society. The British colonizers believed in their inherent cultural superiority and arrived in Umuofia with the intention to âbring civilizationâ (p.151) to Africa. They wanted to achieve full control by supplanting Ibo religion and culture with their own.\n\nThe British arrived quietly and non-confrontationally with their religion and the clans allow them to stay, misinterpreting their silence as peaceability. An Ibo proverb warns that there is danger in silence and nothing to fear from someone who reveals their motivations (Chapter 15). Obierika recognizes how the white manâs strategy disguised their intentions and gave them the freedom to grow and fortify. He explains the political consequences for the clan, now divided by the new religion, they can no longer act as one (Chapter 20). Without strength in unity, the Ibo are vulnerable to further encroachment of British control in their other institutions.\n\nAs only a small number of Ibo initially converted to Christianity, the church was only able to establish itself firmly in the villages because of the Iboâs religious tolerance (Chapter 2, 22). Mr Brown learns about Ibo religion and his willful blindness to its complexity shows how the colonizers justified their colonial rule and imposition through labelling their subjects âprimitiveâ. Mr Brown understands that Christianity held no appeal for people well integrated in Ibo society, concluding that âa frontal attack on it would not succeedâ (p.132) and thus introduces education as a new method of cultural displacement and erasure. Additionally, trade also increased the Iboâs dependence on the introduced economy (Chapter 21).\n\nFrom the very first introduction of the colonizers we understand that violence and fear were tools of oppression and dominance, forcing the Ibo to submit and keeping them unresisting (Chapter 15, 20, 23). Not only do the British impose foreign rule on the Ibo and judge them by standards they do not recognize, the District Commissionerâs personal brand of âjusticeâ is corrupt and hypocritical. When the elders are arbitrarily and falsely imprisoned, he tells them that what they have done âmust not happen in the dominion of our queenâ (p.141), combining personal corruption with a state apparatus of paternalism, hegemony, and occupation (Chapter 20, 23).\n\nDogmatic zealot, Reverend Smith, encourages fanaticism in his converts, motivating them to insult and humiliate the clan (Chapter 22). Under Reverend Smithâs wrathful guidance, the colonial agenda becomes transparently aggressive. The grief and pathos of the Iboâs situation and collective trauma is displayed evocatively in the final episodes as Achebe depicts this painful moment of acute crisis (Chapter 22, 23, 24, 25).\n\nFate\n\nA recurring thematic question in Things Fall Apart is to what degree the collapse of the Ibo and the downfall of Okonkwo are due to their own internal weaknesses or the whims of a pernicious fate.Â\n\nThe Ibo understand fate to be in a dynamic and somewhat ambiguous relationship with personal agency. This is evident in their proverb âwhen a man says yes his chi says yes alsoâ (p.20) which acknowledges and privileges the role of an individualâs choices in shaping their destiny (Chapter 4). The saying âas a man danced so the drums were beaten for himâ (p.135) also relates this idea â fate is a response to oneâs behaviour. Okonkwo is warned that killing Ikemefuna, his surrogate son, is the âkind of action for which the goddess wipes out whole familiesâ (p.49).This demonstrates the clanâs belief that the goddessâs (or fateâs) punishments are not arbitrary but the result of individual action (Chapter 8).\n\nAlthough there is an element of chance in Okonkwoâs gun accidentally exploding and killing someone, his exile carries the suggestion of just comeuppance in its echo of the guns failure to shoot when purposely aimed at Ekwefi (Chapter 5, 13). Likewise, although the arrival of the Christians was unexpected and chanced, Nwoyeâs rejection of his father is traceable directly to Okonkwoâs choice to kill Ikemefuna (Chapter 7). The desertion of people injured by Ibo traditions is a blow to the clan that feels equally earned (Chapters 16, 17, 18).Â Â\n\nAfter his exile, Okonkwo believes his chi has turned against him (Chapter 14). He renunciates the wisdom of his elders by denying the active role he had in directing the course of events. His refusal to reflect on the connection between his actions and punishment reflect his fatal flaws: hubris and willful lack of self-knowledge. By refusing to self-analyze and self-correct, Okonkwo loses the opportunity of redemption. Comparably, the Ibo, despite believing in a relationship between action and fate, do not reflect on the cause of their kinsmenâs desertion to Christianity. Achebe provides numerous examples of the clanâs dogma and brutal traditions denying people such as Ikemefuna or twins control over their lives (Chapter 2, 7). It was the shortcomings of the Ibo social and religious order that made members susceptible to the attraction of a competing value system with a more articulated concept of individuality. The Iboâs cultural lack of self-apprehension meant they could not adjust their traditions to save themselves.\n\nHowever, just as Achebe shows how individuals in the clan are at the mercy of rigid overarching authority, he shows how the fateful forces of history constrain human agency. The Britishâs hostile intention to erase and supplant the Ibo way of life is a punishment greater than the Ibo deserve and a force stronger than they can rise to. In his description of the grief and trauma of colonial imposition, Achebe demonstrates his compassion and sorrow for the Ibo as they faced the sweeping and unforgiving forces of change in their moment of historical crisis.Â\n\nSample Essay Topics\n\n1. \"Things Fall Apart demonstrates how the values and customs of a society help us to deal with the familiar but not with change.\" Discuss.\n\n2. \"Traditional ideas of honour dominate Okonkwo's life and finally they destroy him.\" Discuss.\n\n3. \"Nwoye knew that it was right to be masculine and to be violent, but somehow he still preferred the stories his mother used to tell.\" How does Achebe explore masculinity in Things Fall Apart?\n\nâ\n\nNow it's your turn!

This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nLet's look at an essay prompt in this video below:\n\n[Video Transcript]\n\nIn Things Fall Apart, women suffer the most and are victimised by men. Discuss.\n\nWhenever you are breaking a prompt down. Ask yourself...\n\nWhat are the key words/ ideas that you need to address?\n\nWhich theme is the prompt referring to?\n\nDo you agree with prompt? Or do you disagree with it?\n\nThe keywords of this prompt would be women, suffer,, victimised and men. The prompt requires us to address the role of women in the text and the ways in which they suffer in a society that is pervaded by patriarchal values. It also asks us, âWho is to blame?â Are men solely responsible for the maltreatment or are there other causes to their suffering? The word âmostâ in this prompt is actually there to give us a bit of room for discussion. Yes, women do suffer, but do they suffer the most? Or do men suffer as well?\n\nNow that weâve thought about the prompt, we can move on to the second step of the THINK part of the THINK and EXECUTE technique.

One way to do this is to work out whether the paragraph agrees or disagrees with the prompt at hand. We could follow this structureâ¦\n\nâ\n\nYes, the prompt is true because X\n\nYes, another reason it is true is X\n\nWhile it is true, it is limited by X\n\nBy elucidating the ways in which women are seen as inferior to their male counterparts, the writer establishes his critique on a society that victimises and oppresses women.\n\nFrom the outset of the book, Okonkwo is characterised as a violent man who ârules his household with a heavy handâ, placing his wives in perpetual fear. The frequent beating and violence fortifies the portrayal of him as a man who is governed by his hatred of âgentility and idlenessâ, further showing the terror that his wives are forced to be living in.\n\n\"Do what you are told woman. When did you become one of the ndichie (meaning elders) of Umuofia?\"\n\nHe also sees his wifeâs mere act of questioning as disrespect, as evidenced through the ways in which he implies that she is overstepping her role.\n\nâThere were many women, but they looked on from the fringe like outsiders\"\n\nThis simile also shows how women are often marginalised and treated as outcasts, underlining the overarching yearning for social justice throughout the text. This pitiful image of women looking âon from the fringeâ also helps Achebe relay his criticism of gender double standards and the unfairness that Igbo women are forced to live with.\n\nAchebeâs sympathy for womenâs suffering and condemnation of menâs mistreatment towards are also evident through his depiction of a society that normalises misogyny.\n\nâHis mother and sisters worked hard enough, but they grew womenâs cropsâ¦ Yam, the king of crops, was a manâs cropsâ\n\nThe personification of the crops, in particular, the menâs crops, the âyamâ, being the âking of cropsâ establishes this gender hierarchy in yet another way. More specifically, the position of men in the social hierarchy is highlighted and the negative connotation attached to the âwomenâs cropsâ undermine their hard work, rendering it in significant.\n\nWhile women are the main victims of Igbo gendered prejudice, Achebe does not disregard the undue burden that societal expectations impose on men.\n\nâHe was afraid of being thought weak.â\n\nAchebe explores the burdens of unrealistic expectations that are placed on both men and women. This quote exemplifies societal expectations on men to be strong, powerful and fearless leaders who never show emotions.

Of the five daughters born to Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and Lydia, Jane takes an early liking to Mr. Bingley despite his friend, Mr. Darcy, initial coldness and apathy towards her younger sister Elizabeth. Though Mr. Darcyâs distaste soon grows to attraction and love.\n\nWhile Jane and Mr. Bingley begin to fall for each other, Elizabeth receives and declines a marriage proposal from her supercilious cousin Mr. Collins, who eventually comes to marry Elizabethâs dear friend Charlotte. While Mr. Darcy is in residence at Netherfield Park, Elizabeth finds and enjoys the company of a young officer named Mr. Wickham who too has a strong disliking for Mr. Darcy. Mr. Wickham claims it was Mr. Darcy who cheated him out of his fortune, which then deepens Elizabeth's initial ill impression of the arrogant man.\n\nAfter a ball is held at Netherfield Park, the wealthy family quits the estate, leaving Jane heartbroken. Jane is then invited to London by her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner, which Mr. Darcy fails to tell Mr. Bingley as he has persuaded him not to court Jane because of her lesser status.\n\nWhen Elizabeth visits her newly married friend Charlotte, she meets Lady Catherine de Bourghâs (Mr. Darcyâs Aunt) other nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam. While there, Mr. Darcy appears and proposes to Elizabeth unexpectedly claiming he loves and admires her. To Mr. Darcyâs surprise, Elizabeth refuses as she blames him for ruining Mr. Wickamâs hopes of success and for keeping Jane and Mr. Bingley apart. Mr. Darcy later apologies in a letter and admits to persuading Mr. Bingley not to pursue Jane, but argues that her love for him was not obvious. In the letter, he also denies Wickamâs accusations and explains that Wickham had intended to elope with his sister for her fortune.\n\nElizabeth joins her Aunt and Uncle in visiting Mr. Darcyâs great estate of Pemberley under the impression he would be absent. It is there that Elizabeth learns from the housekeeper that Mr. Darcy is a generous landlord. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy then have a chance encounter after he returns home ahead of schedule. Following her previous rejection of him, Mr. Darcy has attempted to reform his character and presents himself amiably to Elizabethâs Aunt and Uncle as she begins to warm up to him.\n\nMr Darcy happens upon Elizabeth as she receives the terrible news that Lydia has run off with Wickam in an event that could ruin her family. Mr. Darcy then going out in search for Wickham and Lydia to hurry their nuptials. When Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy return to Netherfield Park, Elizabeth is pleased to see him though Darcy shows no sign of his regard for her. Jane and Mr. Bingley soon become engaged.\n\nSoon thereafter, Lady Catherine visits the Bennets and insists that Elizabth never agree to marry her nephew. Darcy hears of Elizabeth's refusal, and when he next comes, he proposes a second time which she accepts, his pride then humbled and her prejudices overturned.\n\nCharacters\n\nElizabeth Bennet\n\nMr. Fitzwilliam Darcy\n\nJane Bennet\n\nMr. Charles Bingley\n\nMr. Bennet\n\nMrs. Bennet\n\nGeorge Wickham\n\nLydia Bennet\n\nMr. Collins\n\nMiss Bingley\n\nLady Catherine De Bourgh\n\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner\n\nCharlotte Lucas\n\nGeorgiana Darcy\n\nMary Bennet\n\nCatherine Bennet\n\nThemes\n\nPride\n\nWithin the text the theme of pride is ever present as it plays a major role in how Austenâs characters present themselves, their attitudes and how they treat each other. For much of the novel pride blinds both Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth of their true feelings and hence becomes something both characters must overcome. While Darcyâs pride makes him look down upon those not immediately within his social circle, Elizabeth takes so much pride in her ability to judge the character of others that she refuses to amend her opinions even when her initial judgements are proven wrong. Indeed, this is why Elizabeth despises the benign Darcy early on in the text, but initially takes a liking to the mendacious Wickham. By the denouement of the novel, both Datcy and Elizabeth have overcome their pride by encouraging and supporting each others own personal evolution. Indeed, as Darcy sheds his elitism Elizabeth comes to realise the importance of revaluation.\n\nPrejudice\n\nThe tendency of others to judge one another based on perceptions, rather than who they are and what they value becomes a point of prolific discussion within Pride and Prejudice. Indeed, the title of the text clearly implies the related nature of pride and prejudice as both Darcy and Elizabeth are often shown to make the wrong assumptions; Darcyâs assumptions grounded in his social prejudice whereas Elizabethâs is rooted in her discernment led astray by her excessive pride. As Austen subtly mocks the two lovers biases, she gives the impression that while such flaws are common faulting someone else for the prejudice is easy while recognising it in yourself is hard. While Austenâs representation of prejudice is aligned with personal development and moral growth as she wittingly condemns those who refuse to set aside their prejudices like Lady Catherine and Caroline.\n\nFamily\n\nThe family unit that Austen displays with Pride and Prejudice becomes the social and domestic sphere as it forms the emotional center of the novel in which she grounds her analysis and discussion. Not only does the family determine the social hierarchy and standing of its members but provides the intellectual and moral support for its children. In the case of the Bennet family, Austen reveals how the individuals identity and sense of self is molded within the family as she presents Jane and Elizabeth as mature, intelligent and witty and lydia as a luckless fool. Not only this, Austen reveals the emotional spectrum that lives within every family as shown through Elizabethâs varying relationship with her parents; the tense relationship with her mother and sympathy she shares with her father.\n\nMarriage\n\nAt the center of its plot, Pride and Prejudice examines the complex inequality that governs the relationships between men and women and the limited options that women have in regards to marriage. Austen portrays a world in which the socio-economic relationship between security and love limits the woman and her choices as it based exclusively on a familyâs social rank and connections. Indeed, the expectations of the Bennet sisters, as members of the upper class is to marry well instead of work. As women can not inherit their families estate nor money, their only option is to marry well in the hope of attaining wealth and social standing. Through this, Austen explains Mrs. Bennetâs hysteria about marrying off her daughters. Yet Austen is also shown to be critical of those who marry purely for security, thereby offering Elizabth as the ideal, who initially refuses marriage as she refutes financial comfort but ends up marrying for love.\n\nClass and Wealth\n\nAs Austen focuses much of her novel on the impacts of class and wealth, she makes clear of the system that favours the rich and powerful and often punishes the weak and poor. Characters like Lady Catherine, whose enforcement of rigid hierarchical positions often leads her to mistreatment of others. Other characters like Mr. Collins and Caroline are depicted as void of genuine connection as they are unable to live and love outside the perimeter of their social standing. In contrast, characters such as Bingley and the Gardiners offer a respectable embodiment of wealth and class through their kindness and manners. Indeed, Austen does not criticise the entire class system as she offers examples that serve to demonstrate the decency and respectability. Darcy embodies all that a high-class gentleman should as though he is initially presented as flawed and arrogant, it becomes clear as the novel progresses that he is capable of change. Always generous and compassionate, his involvement with Elizabeth helps to brings his nurturing nature to the foreground, evident in his attempts to help the foolish lydia. Ultimately, Austen suggest through Darcyâs and Elizabeth's union that though class and wealth are restrictive, they do not determine oneâs character nor who one is capable of loving.\n\nLiterary Devices\n\nSymbolism, imagery and allegories\n\nSetting\n\nNarration\n\nTone\n\nWriting style\n\nTitle\n\nThree Act plot\n\nImportant Quotes\n\nâIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.â (ch.1)\n\nWhen writing on any text in Text Response, it is essential to use quotes and analyse them.\n\nLetâs take this quote, for example.\n\nâit is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wifeâ\n\nThis is the opening line of the novel. It is satirical, ironic and mocking in tone. Austen makes fun of the notion that wealthy bachelors must be wanting to marry in order to be valued in society. By using this tone, she subverts this âtruth universally acknowledgedâ and encourages readers to question this societal presumption of wealth and marriage.\n\nHave a look at the following quotes and ask yourself, âhow would I analyse this quote?â:\n\nâShe is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.â (ch.3)\n\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do.\" (ch.20)\n\nâIn vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.â (ch.34)\n\nâThey were all of them warm in her admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!â (ch.43)\n\nâYou are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject forever.â (ch.58)\n\nEssay Topics\n\nâ\n\n1. What do the various relationships shown in Pride and Prejudice tell us about love, marriage and society?\n\n2. Austen shows that even those of the best moral character can be blinded by their pride and prejudice. To what extent do you agree?\n\n3. Elizabeth Bennet holds a radical view of marriage for her time. What impact does this attitude have on the other characters' lives and relationships? Discuss.\n\nFor more sample essay topics, head over to our Pride and Prejudice Study Guide to practice writing essays using the analysis you've learnt in this blog!\n\nEssay Topic Breakdown\n\nWhenever you get a new essay topic, you can use LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response because itâll dramatically enhance how much you can take away from the following essays and more importantly, to then be able to apply these in your own writing.\n\nTHINK\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a PlanÂ\n\nCharacter-based Prompt: Elizabeth Bennet holds a radical view of marriage for her time. What impact could this attitude have on the other characters' lives and relationships? Discuss.Â\n\nThe following comes essay topic breakdown comes from our Pride and Prejudice Study Guide:\n\nStep 1: AnalyseÂ\n\nElizabeth Bennet holds a radical view of marriage for her time. What impact could this attitude have on the other characters' lives and relationships? Discuss.\n\nA character based essay prompt is pretty self-explanatory as the prompt will have a specific focus on one character or a group of characters. While they may look relatively simple and straightforward, a lot of students struggle with character based questions as they find it is hard to discuss ideas in a lot of depth. With that in mind, it's important that we strive for what the author is saying; what is the author trying to convey through this specific character? What do they represent? Do they advocate for specific ideas or does the author use this character to condemn a certain idea and action?Â\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nThis question is looking at the attitude Elizabeth Bennet has in regard to the expectation and institution of marriage and how her view could impact the lives of the people around her. As always, we want to make sure that we not only identify our key words but define them. I started by first defining/ exploring the attitude Elizabeth holds towards the institution of marriage; as marriage was not only an expectation in the times of regency England but a means to secure future financial security, Elizabethâs outlook that an individual should marry only for the purpose of happiness and love was not only radical but dangerous. Her outlook, while noble, could and did put her family at jeopardy of being cast out from their estate as without a union between one of the Bennet daughters and Mr. Collins, Mr. Collins would have every right to do so as the only male inherent. I also looked at the wider implications Elizabethâs outlook could have on the lives of the other characters such as Charlotte, Darcy and Bingley.\n\nStep 3: Plan\n\nContention: Your contention relates to your interpretation of the essay prompt and the stance youâre going to take â i.e. are you in agreement, disagreement, or both to an extent.\n\nWhile radical for her time, Elizabeth's progressive view of marriage can be seen to advocate for the rights of women and love and happiness but also, can jeopardise the livelihoods of those around her as Elizabeth is guided by selfish motives.Â\n\nP1: The radical view of marriage Elizabeth holds can be viewed as selfish and guided by her own self interest which is shown to negatively impact the lives of her family.Â\n\nP2: As Elizabeth diverts from the traditional approach to marriage, she encourages her friends and loved ones to follow their own hearts and morals rather than society's expectations.Â\n\nP3: Because Elizabeth is depicted as a bold and beautiful woman, she is unable to recognise that her radical view is a luxury that not all characters have access to.Â\n\nIf you'd like to see an A+ essay on the essay topic above, complete with annotations on HOW and WHY the essays achieved A+ so you can emulate this same success, then you'll definitely want to check out our Pride and Prejudice Study Guide: A Killer Text Guide!

Some people donât do them simply because they donât want to, some sacrifice them because they think theyâll run out of time, and some do âplansâ, but in reality, theyâre only a rough mental outline. Each of these situations place too many students time and time again in sticky situations come an English SAC or exam.\n\nWhy plans are essential for any good essay\n\nThey ensure that you canât mind blank â itâs all on the paper in front of you!\n\nThey ensure that you always stay on topic.\n\nMental plans or not having a plan at all mean that you donât have a true direction in which your essay is going. If youâre not sure where youâre going, well, how are you going to get anywhere?\n\nThey save you time in writing time. Â\n\nInstead of wasting reading time, youâve done most of your thinking right at the beginning of the SAC or exam, positioning you to do really well in your essay because you can focus on constructing some really juicy, coherent analysis in your body paragraphs, rather than remembering your basic points and/or making sure your essay is actually answering the question.\n\nLetâs have a look at an essay topic that Iâve tackled in the past. This one is based on Kate Grenvilleâs The Lieutenant, a current VCE Year 12 English text. To learn more about themes, quotes, characters about this text, and to have a look at an essay topic breakdown, check out this blog post written by outstanding LSG tutor, Angelina!\n\nâBut a man could not travel along two different paths.â How does Grenville explore Rookeâs conflict of conscience in The Lieutenant?\n\nStep 1: Highlight key words\n\nNow, it may seem like I've just highlighted the whole prompt, and I understand why you might think that! However, each of the words highlighted convey something meaningful within the prompt. If you're ever unsure about what could be considered a key word, consider whether the prompt would have the same meaning without the word in question.\n\nStep 2: Define key words\n\nIn this topic, the main phrase that needs defining is âconflict of conscienceâ. For me, this signals that we must consider morality and the weighing up of right and wrong, especially when tough decisions have to be made.\n\nIâd also take a moment to analyse the quote. This essay prompt is quote-based, so itâs imperative that we discuss the quote and consider the meaning of the quote throughout our essay. For some more detailed info on how to tackle different types of essay prompts, check out this blog post.\n\nStep 3: Start essay plan\n\nNext, Iâd start tackling the plan itself. Although it seems like the above steps would take a while, my real-life planning process only takes about 5 minutes. You certainly donât have to write everything down and you certainly donât have to make it make sense to anyone but yourself.\n\nPersonally, I like to format my plans in dot-point form. I write 1, 2, 3 for each of my body paragraphs and I leave a space underneath each so I can plan each paragraph.\n\nFirst, Iâll just write rough topic sentences under each, so I can really step back and consider whether my plan of action for the essayâs body paragraphs will do a good job at answering the prompt itself. Again, these are only rough topic sentences â fancying them up will come during the essay writing phase.\n\nStep 4: Important things to include in each paragraph\n\nOnce Iâve decided on what each of my body paragraphs will be about, I can them go into a bit more depth for each of them individually.\n\nThese are the elements that I include for each:\n\nIdeas\n\nEssentially, the points that Iâll argue and the reasoning behind the paragraph\n\nQuotes\n\nThe evidence that Iâll be using to reinforce my point(s).\n\nLiterary devices/metalanguage\n\nIn Year 12, I made a conscious effort to include one literary device or metalanguage example per body paragraph in all of my English essays. This really set me apart from the rest of the state because, in reality, not enough students really focused on the language of their texts, which can really impress examiners.\n\nStrategy: Colour-coded plans\n\nFor me, using different colours in my plans helped me organise my thoughts, distinguish between them, and ensure that I had covered everything that I wanted to cover.\n\nObviously, you can come up with a colour system that works for you, but this is what I came up with:\n\nGreen = metalanguage\n\nRed = quotes\n\nBlack/blue = everything else!\n\nAnd thatâs it â my four-step but five minute essay planning process. Donât be afraid to modify this to make it work for you and your needs. However, definitely DO be afraid of not planning â itâs absolutely essential for any good essay.\n\nHappy planning!\n\nâ\n\n[Video Transcription]\n\nHey guys. I've been doing a load of essay topic breakdowns for you guys, and we've been looking at plans for them, so I thought I would actually show you how I actually do a real life plan, one that I would do on paper if I was preparing for a SAC or an exam, as opposed to the ones that I do on YouTube because the ones that I do on YouTube are slightly different. I definitely go into more detail than I normally would. But at the same time I still do use the same concepts as I would when I do read the steps on YouTube. So I'm going to go and show you that today. And before I actually do that, I just want to preface this and tell you guys why doing a plan is so important.\n\nSo I know that a plan is something that one, a lot of people just don't do, or two, they tend to sacrifice it if they feel like they don't have enough time, or three, they do a plan in their head, but they don't actually write it down on paper. Now, all of these things are pretty detrimental for you, especially because when you write a plan, it actually helps to secure you and ensure that one, you're not going to mind blank throughout your essay or let me rephrase that, if you do mind blank throughout your essay, you will still have a piece of paper in front of you telling you, \"This is what you were thinking Lisa, just go and follow this method or what you've written down here.\" So that way you don't just get stuck in the middle of your essay and start having a freak out because you've forgotten what you were supposed to write.\n\nSecond thing is that it ensures that you don't go off topic. This is something that happens quite frequently. If you don't have a plan, then you have this idea of, \"Oh, I'll write this and this\", and then somehow halfway through an essay, halfway through a paragraph, you realize, \"Holy crap, I have completely veered off the topic or this has gone completely in the other direction from what I intended. This is not what I wanted.\" So in order to prevent that from happening, just do a plan, please! You will find that it ends up saving you so much time and it just gives you that reassurance that you need in situations where there are so many unpredictable factors, like what prompts you're actually going to get. And your focus and attention should be more about developing those ideas, rather than having a mind blank in the middle of your essay and then having a little bit of a freakout as a result.\n\nSo I'm going to base this video on a previous essay topic breakdown in the past, and that is on Kate Grenville's The Lieutenant. I was going to say Lieutenant, because I always accidentally say that, but no, it is Lieutenant. Now, if you are not doing as text as always, don't stress about it because what I want you to take away from this video is how you actually do plans, the thinking that goes behind it and the formatting around it. So let's just get started.\n\nThe essay topic that we're doing today is, \"But a man could not travel along two different paths.\" How does Grenville explore Rooke's conflict of conscience in The Lieutenant. So as always, my first step is I will highlight the keywords that I see inside the prompt. Keywords are different for everyone, but these are the ones that I think are most important.\n\nFirstly, the actual quote itself, how Grenville, conflict of conscience. Pretty much in this case I could probably just highlight the entire thing, but for the sake of just defining some keywords, this is what I would do. So the next step is to define key words. I think the only big key word that I need to define here is conflict of conscience. And so to me, the conflict of conscience suggests internal conflict, which implies that we'll need to consider morality and the concepts of right and wrong, especially when a difficult decision must be made and sides need to be taken. So as you can see, I've written these words down next to the keyword and that will just help me ensure that I stay on topic or I stay in tune with what the keyword is about and I don't suddenly change my mind halfway through the essay.\n\nThen what I'll do is, I will analyze the quote itself. So this is unique because this particular essay prompt has a quote inside it, but I'll have to think about, okay, where did I see this quote? Who might've said it and what might it mean? And I'll draw it down a few notes for that. Then I'll pretty much just go straight into my plan. Now, my plans I've written within five minutes, most of the thinking is actually done during reading time. So personally, I've always found that just writing dot points is completely fine. I don't need to go more beyond that. And I'll show you a few examples now of real life year essay plans that I did during that time. And as you can see, they are pretty much just scribbles and if anybody else was to look at my essay plans, they would have no idea what I'm talking about. But you know what, for me it makes complete sense and that's all that matters. You're not graded on your plan, so just go ahead and do it your way. You do you.\n\nSo what I'll do is I'll quickly dot down one, two, three, and these represent my body paragraphs. Then I'll just write down very quickly what the topic sentences will be. I don't actually write the full topic sentence itself, but I guess the essence of it, so the key things that I will mention in the topic sentence. By writing down the three topic sentences, this allows me to take a step back and look at the essay holistically and ensure that I am answering it the way that I want to. Then what I'll do is I'll move into each individual body paragraph and write down some things that I think are important for me to remember when I go ahead and write it. So I might write down a couple of ideas that I think are important. I will write down quotes that I think are essential to my discussion. And then what I'll do is I will throw in at least one literary device or a metalanguage that I think is important to discuss.\n\nSo in this case, in this first body paragraph, it's limited omniscient third person perspective. By throwing this in, I will ensure that I can show my examiner or show my teacher that I can go on that deeper level. I'll repeat this method with both paragraph two and three. Of course for you, you might need to write down more dot points. You can write fewer dot points, it's really just dependent on every individual. If you are somebody who needs to write down the quotes more, then go ahead and do that. But for me, a lot of the quotes will stick in my head. I just need one point just to bounce off, and then from there, I'm able to pull in all of the other quotes that are necessary.\n\nYou also notice that I do things in different colors. Now, I think this is a strategy that I implemented in order to make things a lot clearer for myself before jumping into an essay. So for example, for anything that's a metalanguage based, I'll write it in green. The whole purpose for that is to ensure that in every single body paragraph, I do cover some form of a literary device because that was always really important for me. I thought that it was one of the key things that helped me differentiate myself from other students. So if I took a step back from the plan and I looked at it overall, I could see, okay, there's a green color in every single body paragraph, done. I have ticked off that criteria.\n\nI also used to write quotes in red as well. So red just helped me do the same thing. It helps me take a step back and go, \"Yep, there's a bit of red in every single body paragraph. I'm definitely including quotes,\" which might sound pretty stupid, but it's just that little bit of reassurance that I think really makes that difference when it comes to a stressful situation.\n\nThat's pretty much it. It's just five minutes of your time, so we probably don't need to go into it in too much more detail than that. But as you can see from my essay plans, I'm quite minimal. I just keep things as short as possible because that's all I really need because a lot of the information is here, but I just need to reinforce it and ensure that it is concrete when it is on paper.\n\nSo for yourself, I would recommend that you start practicing your plans. You can try my method and see if that works for you, but over time, I'm sure that you'll come to find your own way of writing plans that work for you.\n\nNext week I'm going to have another essay topic breakdown for you. Can you guess what it might be? If you want to take a stab, put it in the comment section below, but that's it for me in this week guys. I hope that was helpful for you, and don't forget plans are crucial to an amazing essay.\n\nIf you needed any extra help, then my mailing list is always available for you guys.

Most schools will treat it as an opportunity to expose you to the VCE curriculum, but with Year 10 level texts. This means theyâll cover the same assessment tasks and begin teaching you the skills you need to have by the time you get to VCE.\n\nOther schools will use this year to prepare students for the different English subjects that are offered at the VCE level, so they can decide by the end of the year. These may include VCE English/EAL, VCE Literature and VCE English Language.\n\nFor this blog, weâll focus on the current Victorian Year 10 Curriculum (this will be updated as they change).\n\nSimilar to the VCE years (Year 11-12), most Year 10âs will be expected to complete the following assessment tasks:\n\nText Response\n\nComparative text response\n\nCreative (with a written explanation)\n\nArgument Analysis\n\nUnder each area of study, there will be key skills that you will need to learn to nail the accompanying assessment tasks.\n\nConsidering what you would have learnt in Year 9, Year 10 builds on those skills a bit further. Fundamentally, you would need to provide more detail whenever youâre expected to analyse evidence or provide an explanation and there will be specific essay structures your teacher will want you to follow. This may vary depending on your school.\n\nCheck out 'What should Year 9 students expect when they enter Year 10' for a more in depth breakdown of the Year 9 to 10 transition!\n\n2.

This is because the text will need to be understood inside out for you to score highly on the essay.\n\nWhen you begin annotating your text, look for the following:\n\nKey ideas explored by the author\n\nCharacterisation and character transformation\n\nSocial/Historical/Cultural/Political context\n\nStylistic features used by the author, such as symbolism, motifs, etc.\n\nWords you donât understand (and then define them)\n\nTo help you have a better understanding of your text, teachers will usually assign you comprehension questions about your text and that will be their way of easing you into writing analytical body paragraphs.\n\nExamples of prompts you may receive for text response include:\n\nâNight paints a vivid picture of a broken society in a broken place.â Discuss.\n\nâHoldenâs critique of phonies in The Catcher in the Rye is his way of critiquing society.â Do you agree?\n\nAs important as the keywords are in the prompt, you need to be able to identify the type of prompt you have chosen to answer. Similarly, you must take some time to familiarise yourself with the task words that commonly pop up in prompts.\n\nCheck out The Ultimate Guide to Text Response to get a more specific idea of HOW you can smash out this essay.\n\nComparative Text Response\n\nThis is oftentimes deemed to be the most difficult area of study students will complete in English. Instead of just interpreting and analysing one text, youâre now presented with two texts you will need to find common ideas and themes to discuss.\n\nTo get in the high-scoring range you will need to do the following to help you stand out from the rest of your classmates:\n\nConstantly form links between the texts and the prompt youâre answering\n\nConsistent and detailed comparison throughout the essay between the two texts\n\nBe able to demonstrate a depth understanding of the texts\n\nRefer back to the writerâs views and values (their intention/message to the reader)\n\nExplore the different ideas expressed by the author\n\nExamine HOW the author has created certain effects on the reader, taking into consideration their use of narrative and stylistic choices\n\nUse relevant metalanguage\n\nWe also have The Ultimate Guide to VCE Comparative to help you break down HOW you can best prepare for this assessment task.\n\nIf you would like to know the pros and cons of the different comparative essay structures you can follow, check out this blog.\n\nCreative Task\n\nThis particular assessment will generally be based on the text you have studied with your class. It may be a collection of short stories, a novel, poems, etc. The majority of the time, teachers will expect you to pick one of the characters from the text and write an alternate plot for them while also mirroring the style of the original text.Â\n\nSometimes, teachers will allow you to pick the story and character you get to focus on, other times, theyâll provide you with a list you can choose from. If youâre given free rein for this task, check out our creative ideas you can adopt.\n\nA written explanation usually accompanies this assessment task as well. This is where you break down your creative task for your teacher, sharing with them your purpose for writing it the way you have. You will address your language choices, themes, literary devices used, intended audience, etc. This tends to be around 200 words in length. Hereâs a blog that explains HOW you can write the best written explanation.\n\nSome more creative writing resources to help you out with this assessment:\n\nHow To Achieve A+ In Creative Writing\n\nHow YOU Can Be A Better Creative Writer! For ANY Student\n\n11 Mistakes High School Students Make In Creative Writing\n\nArgument Analysis\n\nMimicking the analysing argument essay you will need to complete in both Year 11 and Year 12, you will be expected to:\n\nDemonstrate your understanding and knowledge of both written and visual features of persuasion in your analysis (this is where the intended effect of the writer comes into play)\n\nBe able to identify and explain your assumptions with sophisticationÂ\n\nShow insightful knowledge of both explicit and implicit meaning within the texts\n\nProve that you know HOW language choices can influence the audience\n\nUse relevant metalanguage (this may include persuasive devices, language or visual techniques)\n\nSome schools like to pick a specific issue to focus on, for instance, social media. All of the articles and tasks they assign their students to analyse will then be focused on this issue. Other schools will expose their students to a variety of different issues. Either way, you will be exposed to a variety of persuasive material and forms, including opinion pieces, speech transcripts, editorials, cartoons, etc. This is elaborated on in The Ultimate Guide to VCE Language Analysis.\n\nDifferent schools will teach different analysis techniques. One of the most common ones includes the WHAT-HOW-WHY method. This will be applicable when you move into Year 11 and 12 English too.\n\nIntroductions for this particular essay are just as straightforward and can be quite formulaic. Check out our YouTube video on how to write an A+ language analysis introduction to learn the elements you need in an argument analysis introduction. If youâre curious about the writing process for the entire essay, then check out this video.\n\nA lot of the time in Year 10, you will also be unpacking media advertisements. This will tie into the argument analysis area of study.\n\nHere, you may be analysing HOW and WHY advertisements are created the way they are and the choices made by the creator to influence the specific target audience. Sometimes, you will also have the opportunity to create your own! If this is the case, you will also most likely write up a written explanation of around 200-300 words explaining the choices you have made.\n\n3. Year 10 English Texts\n\nAs you would have read in The Ultimate Guide to Year 9 English, reading is one of the most important skills that need to be maintained as you progress through high school.\n\nHere is a list of 10 texts many students at a Year 10 level may have read:\n\nAnimal Farm by George Orwell\n\nJane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte\n\nLord of the Flies by William Golding\n\nOf Mice and Men by John Steinbeck\n\nPride and Prejudice by Jane Austen\n\nThe Book Thief by Markus Zusak\n\nThe Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald\n\nThe Life of Pi by Yann Martel\n\nThe Simple Gift by Steven Herrick\n\nTo Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee\n\nHow many of these texts can you tick off the list?Â\n\n4. How To Get Good Marks in Year 10 English?\n\na) Knowing Where to Start\n\nOf course, itâs important to acknowledge your strengths in English; however, to improve upon your marks and do even better, you will also need to fine-tune your weaknesses. Merely relying on strengths wonât be enough anymore.Â\n\nIdentify the skills you need to improve and be specific!\n\nFor example, âI need to make my introductions shorter and simplerâ or âI will plan my essay more extensively so I will know which pieces of evidence will be relevant for each body paragraph.â\n\nIf this is the case, writing a million essays wonât get you to where you want to be. It would be inefficient and a waste of everyoneâs time. Hone down your focus to one or two things, instead of every skill that falls under essay writing.Â\n\nReferring back to the above example, if you want to make your introductions shorter and simpler, read through a few sample high-scoring introductions and test them you can adopt for an introduction and know which one will work best for you. Or if your pain point is the planning process, compile different essay planning templates and use them in your essay planning so you can narrow down your options for different types of prompts.\n\nThis way, starting small will help you improve without overwhelming you so much. Check out How I Went From Average To A+ In High School English to get that boost of motivation and confidence before you embark on this learning journey.\n\nAs you do this, donât forget to keep in mind the 7 Deadly (English Writing) Sins you should always avoid!\n\nb) Work With Your Teacher\n\nAs weâve explained in our Instagram post on the feedback loop, getting feedback for your essay or paragraph from your teacher and tutors will also help you improve much faster!\n\nIf youâre not familiar with the essay writing feedback loop process, it goes:\n\nStep 1: Write a paragraph(s) or essay\n\nStep 2: Get input on what works and fix what doesnât (this input can come from your teacher and/or tutor)\n\nStep 3: Redraft or write a new one to test your skills\n\nStep 4: Repeat\n\nWhether itâs just a plan, an introduction, a body paragraph or even a complete essay, taking the initiative to seek help from your teacher will provide you with clarity on what it is you need to be working on. This is crucial if you want to jump from a C grade to an A+.Â\n\nEach time you write a practise essay or paragraph, you should have a goal in mind so you know what youâre trying to improve upon. This way, you can cut down your workload and reduce study time!\n\nI would recommend you do this as many times as necessary until you get that 10/10 essay so you can use it as a template or model essay in the future!\n\nc) Write Under Timed Conditions\n\nEven though a lot of the time in Year 10, teachers will be a bit more lenient so theyâll permit you to bring in a cheat sheet into the exam or assessment. However, that doesnât always mean youâll be able to finish on time, so itâll serve you best to do some additional practise essays under timed conditions.Â\n\nSome things to look out for when you do practise writing timed essays or paragraphs:\n\nEnsuring that your handwriting is legibleÂ\n\nTrial and error different types of planning methods to find which suits you best\n\nKnow the essay structure you want to adopt for the particular essay\n\nAvoid âfluffâ (unnecessary details) and get straight to the core idea and analysis since that is where youâll get the marks\n\nPractise makes perfect!Â\n\nHereâs a YouTube video that details how you can go about writing 3 essays in 3 hours which youâll eventually need to do!\n\nAt LSG, we have the most qualified tutors who have received the marks youâre after who can walk you through your high school English journey with you.Â\n\nWhat will we offer you?\n\nRegular English advice and support (whether that is homework help, essay feedback or if you just want to go the extra mile and get ahead with your English studies)\n\nA specialised LSG Signature Program that can cater to your goals and help you develop the knowledge and get all the consistent writing practise you need\n\nGuidance as we work through the necessary writing skills and strategies that will get you the A+ you desire\n\nAccess to exclusive LSG resources that will save you time creating your own notes (planning and writing templates, sample high-scoring essays, and so much more!)\n\nIf you want more information on why you should pick us, check out our tutoring page.

For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\n1. Summary\n\nWhen most people think of Hitchcock, itâs the screeching violins fromÂ PsychoÂ that first come to mind. Whilst he is indeed known for his hair-curling thrillers,Â Rear WindowÂ is a slightly subtler film which focuses not on a murderer at large, but rather a crippled photographer who never even leaves his apartment.\n\nOur protagonist L.B. âJeffâ Jefferies is portrayed by James Stewart, who was known at the time for portraying cowboys in various Western films as well as starring in an earlier Hitchcock filmÂ Rope. After breaking his leg after a racing accident, Jeff begins to spy on his neighbours, one of whom he suspects of having committed a murder.\n\nDespite some initial misgivings, his insurance nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) and lover Lisa (Grace Kelly) also come to share his suspicions and participate in his spying. Their contributions ultimately allow the mystery to be solved.\n\nIntertwined with this mystery is also the rather complex story of Jeff and Lisaâs relationship. Jeff on one hand resembles the âmachoâ men of action whom Stewart is very accustomed to playing. On the other hand, Kelly portrays a character much like herself, a refined and elegant urbanite whose lifestyle inherently clashes with that of an action photographer.\n\nHitchcock ultimately resolves both of these storylines in the filmâs denouement.\n\n2. Historial Context\n\nBefore getting into the nitty-gritty of the film, it is crucial to understand a bit about its historical context. As with any other text, the social conditions at the time ofÂ Rear Windowâs release in 1954 inform and shape the interactions and events of the film.\n\nReleased in theÂ post-war period, the film is undoubtedly characterised by the interpersonal suspicion which defined the era. In particular, there was a real fear in America of Communist influences and Soviet espionage - so much so that a tribunal was established, supposedly to weed out Communists despite a general lack of evidence. This practice of making accusations without such evidence is now known as the McCarthyism, named after the senator behind the tribunal.\n\nThe film undoubtedly carries undertones of this, particularly in Jeffâs disregard for his neighboursâ privacy and his unparalleled ability to jump to conclusions about them. During this era, people really did fear one another, since the threat of Communism felt so widespread. Jeffâs exaggerated interpretations of his neighboursâ actions lead him to an irrational sense of suspicion, which is in many way the basis of the entire film.\n\nAt the same time, the 1950s saw aÂ boom in photojournalismÂ as a legitimate profession. To some extent, this was fuelled by the heyday ofÂ LifeÂ magazine (an American weekly, as well-known then asÂ TimeÂ magazine is today). This publication was almost entirely photojournalistic, and one of their war photojournalists, Robert Capa, is actually the basis of Jeffâs character. This explains the prevalence of cameras in his life, as well as his ability to emotionally distance himself from those whom he observes through the lens.\n\nAnother crucial historical element isÂ the institution of marriage, and how important it was to people during the 1950s. It was an aspiration which everyone was expected to have, and this is reflected statistically - only 9.3% of homes then had single occupants (as opposed to around 25% today). People also tended to marry at a younger age, generally in their early 20s.\n\nConversely, divorce was highly frowned upon, and once you were married, you would in general remain married for the rest of your life. In particular, divorced women suffered massive financial difficulties, since men, as breadwinners, held higher-paying jobs, and women were only employed in traditionally female roles (e.g. secretaries, nurses, teachers, librarians). Seen in this light, we can understand Lisaâs overwhelming desire to marry and settle down with Jeff. The importance of marriage is also evident in the lives of Jeffâs neighbours; Miss Torsoâs 'juggling [of the] wolves', and Miss Lonelyheartâs depression both reflect this idea.\n\n3. Themes\n\nCombining a basic understanding of the filmâs plot, as well as our knowledge of its history, we can begin to analyse some of the themes that emerge.\n\nPossibly the central tenet of the film is the big question ofÂ privacy. Even in todayâs society, the sanctity of privacy is an important concept; every individual has a right to make their own choices without having to disclose, explain or justify all of them. The character of Doyle says almost these exact words:Â\n\n'Thatâs a secret and private world youâre looking into out there. People do a lot of things in private that they couldnât possibly explain in public'\n\nThe tension that Hitchcock draws upon is this other idea of public responsibility, or civic duty - that is, the need to uphold the peace and protect oneâs fellow citizens from harm. These ideas clash inÂ Rear Window, as fulfilling this civic responsibility (which for Jeff means privately investigating Thorwald) means that Thorwaldâs right to privacy gets totally thrown out the window. So to speak.\n\nEvidently, this is a majorÂ moral dilemma. If you suspect that someone has committed murder, does this give you the right to disregard their privacy and surveil them in this way? While the film doesnât give a definite answer (and you wonât be required to give a definite answer), Hitchcock undoubtedly explores the complexity of this question. Even Jeff has misgivings about what heâs seeing:Â\n\nÂ 'Do you suppose itâs ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long-focus lensâuntil you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail? Do you suppose itâs ethical even if you prove he didnât commit a crime?'\n\nIn some ways, the audience is also positioned to reflect on this question, and in particular, reflect on the paranoia that characterised and defined the McCarthy era.\n\nSomewhat separate to these questions is theÂ romanceÂ between Jeff and Lisa, since Hitchcock seems to keep the thriller storyline and the romance storyline separate for a large part of the film. Their contrasting lifestyles and world views present a major obstacle in the fulfilment of their romance, and the murder mystery both distracts and unites them. Hitchcock further alludes to the question of whether marriage will be able to settle those differences after all - a major example is the following scene, in which Lisa not only reveals her discovery of Mrs Thorwaldâs ring, but also expresses a desire for Jeff to âput a ring on itâ as well:\n\n4. Cinematography\n\nItâs impossible to study a Hitchcock film without considering how he impacted and manipulated its storytelling. The cinematographic techniques employed inÂ Rear WindowÂ are important ways of shaping our understanding of the film, and Hitchcock uses a wide array of visual cues to communicate certain messages.\n\nLightingÂ is one such cue that he uses a lot - it is said that at certain points in filming, he had used every single light owned by the studio in which this film was shot. In this film, lighting is used to reveal things: when the lights are on in any given apartment, Jeff is able to peer inside and watch through the window (almost resembling a little TV screen; Jeff is also able to channel surf through the various apartments - Hitchcock uses panning to show this).\n\nOn the contrary, a lack of lighting is also used to hide things, and we see Thorwald utilise this at many stages in the film. Jeff also takes advantage of this, as he often sits in a position where he is very close to being in the shadows himself; if he feels the need, he is able to retreat such that he is fully enshrouded. Low-key lighting in these scenes also contributes to an overall sense of drama and tension.\n\nAnother handy visual cue is theÂ cross-cut, which is an example of theÂ Kuleshov effect. The Kuleshov effect is an editing technique whereby a sequence of two shots is used to convey information more effectively than just a single shot. Specifically, the cross-cut shifts from a shot of a person to a second shot of something that this person is watching.\n\nWe see this often, particularly when Jeff is responding to events in the courtyard; Hitchcock uses this cross-cut to immediately show us what has caused Jeffâs response. This visual cue indicates to viewers that we are seeing what Jeff is seeing, and is one of the few ways that Hitchcock helps audiences assume Jeffâs point-of-view in key moments.\n\nSimilarly, Hitchcock also usesÂ photographic vignettingÂ to merge our perspectives with Jeffâs - in certain shots, we see a fade in clarity and colour towards the sides of a frame, and this can look like a circular shadow, indicating to us that we are seeing something through a telescope or a long-focus lens.\n\nInterestingly, a vignette is also a short, descriptive scene that focuses on a certain character and/or idea to provide us with insights about them - in this sense, itâs also possible to say that Jeff watches vignettes of his neighbours. Since this word has two meanings, you must be careful about which meaning youâre referring to.\n\nâ\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\nâ\n\n5. Key Symbols\n\nAs with any other text, itâs important to consider some of the key symbols that Hitchcock draws upon in order to tell his story. That being said, one of the benefits of studying a film is that these symbols tend to be quite visual - you are able to see these recurring images and this may make them easier to spot. Weâll be going through some of these key images in the final part of this guide.\n\nOne of the first symbols we see isÂ Jeffâs broken leg, which is propped up and completely covered by a cast, useless for the time being. Because he has been rendered immobile by his leg, readers can infer from this symbol that he is also incapable of working or even leaving his apartment, let alone solving a murder mystery. The broken leg is in this sense a symbol of his powerlessness and the source of much of his discontent.\n\nAnother interpretation of the broken leg however, is that it represents his impotence which on one hand is synonymous for powerlessness or helplessness, but is on the other hand an allusion to his apparent inability to feel sexual desire. Being constantly distracted from Lisa by other goings-on in the courtyard definitely supports this theory. All in all, Jeffâs broken leg represents some compromise of his manhood, both in the sense that he cannot work in the way that a man would have been expected to, but also in the sense that he is unable to feel any attraction towards Lisa, even as she tries her best to seduce him.\n\nConversely, JeffâsÂ long-focus camera lensÂ is a symbol of his passive male gaze, which is more or less the only thing he can do in his condition. It is the main means through which he observes other people, and thus, it also symbolises his voyeuristic tendencies - just as his broken leg traps and inhibits him, his camera lens transports him out of his own apartment and allows him to project his own fears and insecurities into the apartments of his neighbours, watching them for entertainment, for visual pleasure.\n\nIn this latter sense, the camera lens can also be understood as a phallic symbol, an erection of sorts. It highlights Jeffâs perverted nature, and the pleasure he derives from the act of observing others. Yikes.\n\nOn the other hand,Â Lisaâs dressesÂ underscore the more positive parts of her character. Her initial wardrobe represents her elegance and refinery whilst also communicating a degree of incompatibility with Jeff. However, as she changes and compromises throughout the film, her wardrobe also becomes much more practical and much less ostentatious as the film wears on, until she is finally wearing a smart blouse, jeans and a pair of loafers. The change in her wardrobe reflects changes in her character as well.\n\nFinally,Â the wedding ring of Mrs ThorwaldÂ is hugely significant; wedding rings in general represent marriage and commitment, and are still very important symbols that people still wear today. Specifically, Mrs Thorwaldâs ring means a couple of things in the context of the film - it is firstly a crucial piece of evidence (because if Mrs Thorwald was still alive, she would probably still be wearing it) and it is also a symbol through which Lisa can express a desire for stability, commitment and for herself to be married.\n\nThereâs definitely plenty to talk about with HitchcockâsÂ Rear Window, and I hope these points of consideration help you tackle this film!\n\nTest your film technique knowledge with the video below:\n\nReady to start writing on Rear Window?

Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nWhenever you get a new essay topic, you can use LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy - a technique to help you write better VCE essays. This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response because itâll dramatically enhance how much you can take away from the following essays and more importantly, your ability to apply this strategy in your own writing.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nTHINK\n\nFilm technique-based prompt:\n\nHitchcockâs use of film techniques offers an unnerving viewing experience. Discuss.\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nWhile we should use film techniques as part of our evidence repertoire in each essay, this particular type of essay prompt literally begs for it. As such, Iâd ensure that my essay has a greater focus on film techniques (without concerning myself too much over inclusion of quotes; the film techniques will act as a replacement for the quotes).\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nSince the essay prompt is rather open-ended, it is up to us to decide which central themes and ideas weâd like to focus on. By narrowing down the discussion possibilities ourselves, weâll 1) make our lives easier by removing the pressure to write about everything, and 2) offer teachers and examiners a more linear and straightforward approach that will make it easier for them to follow (and give you better marks!).\n\nThe âunnerving viewing experienceâ is present throughout the entire film, so my approach will be to divide up each paragraph into start of the film, middle of the film and end of the film discussions. This will help with my essayâs coherence (how well the ideas come together), and flow (how well the ideas logically progress from one to another).\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nContention: Through a diverse range of film techniques, Hitchcock instils fear and apprehension into the audience of Rear Window.\n\nP1: The opening sequence of Rear Window employs various film techniques to immediately establish underlying tension in its setting.\n\nP2: Through employing the Kuleshov effect in the strategically cut scene of Miss Lonelyheartsâ attempted suicide, Hitchcock adds to the suspenseful tone of the film by developing a guilty voyeur within each viewer.\n\nP3: In tandem with this, Hitchcock ultimately adds to the anxiety of the audience by employing lighting and cross-cutting techniques in the climax scene of the plot, in which an infuriated Thorwald attempts to enter Jeffâs apartment.\n\nIf you find this helpful, then you might want to check out our A Killer Text Guide: Rear Window ebook, which has all the information and resources you need to succeed in your exam, with detailed summaries and background information, as well as a detailed analysis of all five essay prompts!\n\n8.

This new AoS in the 2024 study design has essentially expanded and replaced the previous study designâs approach to creative writing, now placing a greater focus on the process of creating texts and embracing multiple forms of writing.\n\nHereâs what the study design states the outcome of this unit is:\n\nâOn completion of this unit the student should be able to demonstrate effective writing skills by producing their own texts, designed to respond to a specific context and audience to achieve a stated purpose; and to explain their decisions made through writing processes.â (VCAA English Study Design, 2024-2027)\n\nSo, while before VCAA did not place a heavy focus on this unit, now it is heavily emphasised, being one of the three sections of the English exam. Now, more so than before, you are required to write â even if just a little bit â creatively.\n\nGiven that Creating Texts is now reflected in the end-of-year exam, it is very important to nail it. And to do that, you first need to know what this Area of Study is all about.\n\nFramework of Ideas\n\nA big part of this AoS is the Framework of Ideas, which provides students and, perhaps most importantly, schools, with thematic guides to encourage discussion and unique writing. The study design states:\n\nâThe Framework of Ideas presents four broad ideas through which students can engage with writingâ.Â\n\nHereâs what they are, as directly taken from the study design:\n\nWriting about country: 'Exploration of place and belonging'\n\nYou can also explore ideas of oneâs sense of national belonging, the climate crisis, colonisation and decolonisation, and different forms of cultural identities in relation to the land. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives can also be addressed.\n\nWriting about protest: 'Explorations of conflict and contest, what it means to protest, the value of protest, the outcomes of protest, personal stories of protest, struggle and war'\n\nFor this framework, you can dive deep into prominent figures who spearheaded social movements through protests, or you can look at protest more broadly and investigate its role and effectiveness within society, the history of protest and its many facets.\n\nÂ Writing about personal journeys: 'Explorations of âlifeâ or biographical explorations'\n\nIdeas surrounding the importance of storytelling and personal change, and invitations for students to create autobiographical written pieces are also outlined in the study design.\n\nÂ Writing about play: 'Explorations of experiences and traditions of play and playing in many cultures and through history'\n\nThis framework also invites thought into how play intersects with technology, the role of play and make-believe in our daily lives, and even how performance and social media may influence how we view the world today.\n\nNOTE: The study design also offers many other possible ways to explore these ideas, so make sure to check it out and read it carefully. It can be found HERE.\n\nAs you can see, the ideas within the frameworks are very broad. This was intentionally done, so that you have ample opportunity to find something within those ideas that engage you. Your school will choose only one of these frameworks, so you are in no way expected to dissect all four â that would be a huge undertaking!\n\nMentor Texts\n\nThere are also four mentor texts for each framework, which range from TED Talks, blog posts, short stories, speeches and argumentative articles, to name a few. Their purpose in the curriculum is to serve as examples of effective writing, as the selected texts show a competent understanding of context, purpose and audience, as well as confident use of textual features such as tone, vocabulary and authorial voice. This is similar to what you might have encountered in Year 11, where you were asked to read and analyse a range of creative texts to then inform your own writing.\n\nWhen studying your mentor texts, make sure to keep all of this in mind and carefully analyse each text and what is successful about them in relation to your framework. This will make your life much easier when it comes to writing your own.\n\nIf you donât feel very confident in creating texts or think these frameworks are very broad and hard to come up with good ideas for, just remember that youâre not going into this unit completely blind, neither are you expected to write completely from scratch.\n\nBesides your experience last year, your given framework and mentor texts are there to provide a guide to effective writing and introduce you to many different ideas, so make sure to use them to your advantage! Besides, having more freedom in a creative writing task should definitely be viewed as a benefit rather than a hindrance.Â\n\nOh No! Does This Mean I Have To Write a Narrative?Â\n\nNo, it doesnât! If the aforementioned formats of the mentor texts were any indication, this AoS encourages you to embrace the variety of different writing styles.\n\nWhen before you might have been required to write within a narrative format or asked to âfill a gapâ in an already existing short story, now you have the freedom to write in whatever way you want, and it does not need to be a narrative, let alone fictional storytelling.\n\nIn the context of the Creating Texts AoS, âcreative writingâ does not only equate to creating fictional characters, worlds and narratives. Instead, it gives way to the many other forms of writing that show off a writerâs creativity, which is not solely dependent on what is written, but also how and why the text has been written. This links back to the context, purpose and audience idea I talked about before.\n\nThe study design also heavily focuses on the process of writing and experimentation and not just the final draft. This AoS is your chance to fully immerse yourself in writing, so you should make sure to brainstorm and try new modes of writing you might not have thought of before. You might end up surprising yourself and coming up with great texts!\n\nSo, hereâs a non-exhaustive list of writing styles you can choose to tackle:\n\nYour classic narrative or short story\n\nMemoir\n\nArgumentative article\n\nTranscript of a Podcast episode\n\nSpeech\n\nPoetry/Song (just remember you are not allowed to write in these formats for the Exam!)\n\nReflective essay\n\nBiographical texts\n\nYou may find that, as you work through the unit, some formats may be more effective than others depending on your framework, chosen audience, chosen tone or even just your personal preference. For example, writing in a blog post format post would be more effective in engaging the particular audience of teens and young adults.Â\n\nOr, you may choose to convey your ideas with a specific tone in mind. For example, if you want to address your framework in an emotive way you might choose to write a first-person narrative short story. Conversely, if you want to address it in a rational and factual way, you might choose to write an article.Â\n\nThatâs another reason why experimenting and trying new things is so important -Â so that you can find out what, in your opinion, suits you and the framework best.\n\nCheck out our blog post on the Skeleton Approach for a suggestion of how you could potentially structure your Creative piece.\n\nWhat Your SAC Will Look Like\n\nThis AoS is worth 60 of the 100 marks allocated for Unit 3, so it is a big deal. However, if you have a look at the study design, those 60 marks are split into three equal parts worth 20 marks each, which means your SAC will consist of three things:\n\nâ1) âA written text constructed in consideration of audience, purpose and context.â And, of course, your text will also need to be constructed in relation to your chosen framework.\n\n2) âA written text constructed in consideration of audience, purpose and context.â Yep, thatâs right. For this SAC you have to create two distinct writing pieces. The assessment task as it is outlined in the study design does not mention whether they need to have completely different formats or audience/purpose/context from one another, so the specifics might be up to your school to decide.\n\n3)Â âA commentary reflecting on writing processes.â This is the same as a Written Explanation, which you likely have come across before. This is where you write a couple of paragraphs outlining and justifying your choices for each written text you produced, especially in relation to your framework and your audience, purpose and context. Having a successful commentary means you clearly describe the authorial intent in your work, so make sure to be specific and self-analytical in your writing!\n\nWhat the Exam Will Look Like\n\nThe 2024 English exam will be the first exam that follows the new 2024-2027 study design, and the biggest change between now and the previous years is that Section B, which used to ask students to write a Comparative Response to a set of texts they would have studied at school during the year, is now all about Creating Texts. So much so that now Section B is called â you guessed it â âCreating textsâ.\n\nVCAA has been kind enough to release a sample of this new requirement, which outlines very faithfully what this section will look like in the actual exam. The exam paper consists of a page of general instructions which apply to all students, and then four pages with three pieces of stimulus material each, which relate to each of the four frameworks.\n\nThe stimuli consist of one statement, an image, and a section of a poem/story, and the exam paper says you must use âat least oneâ of them in your writing. (Hereâs a quick tip: if the examiners are asking for at least one, use two or more.)\n\nThere is also a compulsory title given for each framework, which must be the title of your text.\n\nThe instructions in the VCAA sample exam also outline that in Section B âyou must create one written text (not including song, poetry or verse)â, and that âyou must include meaningful connections with ideas drawn from one of the Frameworks of Ideasâ as well as the provided title and the stimulus material. You should choose the framework you have studied in depth at school to write about, and you are also able to refer to your mentor texts, although that is not compulsory in the exam.\n\nAnother point is that âyou must develop your text with a clear purpose, incorporating at least one of the following: to explain, to express, to reflect, to argue.â\n\nYou may remember these purposes from the Unit 1 Crafting Texts Area of Study in Year 11. They are pretty much self-explanatory, and chances are that any writing you do will already serve one of these purposes without it being your conscious decision. Also, similar to the stimulus material, try to incorporate two purposes within your piece instead of just one, if possible.\n\nAnd, as previously was the case as well, Section B is worth one-third of your full exam marks.\n\nYou can find the 2024 English sample exam and other very helpful resources such as past exams and exam reports by clicking HERE.Â\n\nThree Tips to Help You Ace Creating Texts\n\nSo, now that we know what Creating Texts is all about, here are three helpful tips to keep in mind as you make your way through this Area of Study:\n\n1) Play to Your Strengths\n\nAs you experiment and become familiar with a range of writing styles and formats, you may find that youâve become really good at writing argumentative essays, or you became more interested in writing short stories, or maybe you remember that in Year 11 you got a high mark for writing a strong reflective essay. Make sure to self-assess and keep in mind what your strengths are in writing, even if they might not be apparent at first glance.\n\nAlso remember that, in the exam, you have a very limited amount of time to come up with a unique piece of writing from scratch, so having a text format in mind that you feel really confident and comfortable writing with can provide at least a little bit of guidance and reassurance when youâre writing something new.\n\n2) Choose Formats That Will Help You Show a Deep Understanding of Your Framework\n\nFor instance, if you have the âwriting about playâ framework and you are deeply inspired by an example of how play can help people heal from trauma from one of your mentor texts which happens to be a memoir, you might deem it best to write a short story or a personal fictionalised diary entry which shows you have taken inspiration from that memoirâs central idea, but you are also engaging with the frameworkâs implications in society.\n\nOf course, this should be judged on a case-by-case basis, but it can be a helpful guide if you feel stuck and unsure of where to start your writing process.\n\n3) Be Flexible\n\nThis is especially important for the exam. You donât want to walk in with a memorised text! Examiners can definitely tell when a student has just route-learned their way into essay writing, and this will undoubtedly be extra noticeable for creative texts, especially when the exam gives you no choice but to integrate their given stimulus material.\n\nThis is why becoming used to as many writing formats as possible, alongside consistent planning and brainstorming, are incredibly important skills to develop throughout the year, so that when it comes time to the end-of-year exam you are ready to go regardless of what the examiners throw at you!\n\nThe best way to succeed in this Unit, like pretty much all other tasks in English, is to consistently practice your writing and experiment with as many writing styles as you possibly can. Be open to new ways of thinking, not only about the framework you are given, but about the concept of writing itself! Although certainly challenging, the Creating Texts AoS can prove itself to be great fun. So, best of luck in creating texts, and happy writing!\n\nFor an overview of the EAL study design plus tips and tricks for reading comprehension, time management and more, check out The Ultimate Guide to EAL.\n\nThe listening tasks of the EAL exam are worth 20% of the total exam marks.Â Since this section was introduced to the exam fairly recently, limited past exam questions are available for students to practice. In my blog post EAL Listening Practice and Resources, I provide you with some awesome listening resources that you should definitely check out! And more importantly, I teach you a step-by-step approach for how to use those listening resources to help you better prepare for EAL listening. If you havenât already read that blog post, go and check it out before coming back to this one so that you understand the steps weâre following.\n\nHere weâll be working through another exam-style practice to help us improve on the EAL listening section. We will be adopting the same strategies introduced in EAL Listening Practice and Resources.Â For more advice on how to boost your skills in the listening section, check out Tips on EAL Listening.\n\nUse this link to access the audio clip that weâll be using in this listening practice: Hospital Parking Fees - Classroom - BTN (abc.net.au)\n\nDownload this worksheet so that you can work through this listening task on your own too!\n\n1st Time Listening\n\nStep 1:Â Read and Annotate Background Information (below)\n\nHighlight the name of the speakers.\n\nUnderline important information.\n\nStep 2:Â Read and Annotate the QuestionsÂ\n\nDevelop a system that works well for you personally. For example, I usually underline the keywords that give me information on âwhatâ, âwhyâ, âhowâ, âwhereâ, âwhenâ. I highlight the speakers in the example below.Â\n\nStep 3: Listen to the Audio (Without the Visual)\n\nHospital Parking Fees - Classroom - BTN (abc.net.au)\n\nStep 4: Write Down Side Notes\n\n2nd Time ListeningÂ Â\n\nStep 1: Fill in the blanks and try to be aware of words you donât quite âgetâ.\n\nThis is where you have the opportunity to fill in the blanks for the challenging words that you did not pick up in the first round. For example: petition, democratic, campaign, rare.Â\n\nCOMMON MISTAKE: check the spelling for ârareâ, not ârearâ\n\nStep 2: Note down how the speakers convey their attitude, feeling, ideas, etc.\n\nLet's take a look at this section of the audio clip:\n\nGIDON: âIt gives me a really good feeling to know that I've made a change, that change has happened. I think what I would like to say to all the other people, especially kids who want to start change, is that it really does sometimes seem impossible that someone that doesn't have a vote and who doesn't have as much democratic power really as adults do, I think what this has shown is that it really is possible to do these things that we still can affect our country and that small people can make great change.âÂ\n\nHereâs one way I analysed the delivery of the audio:\n\nThe cheerful and hopeful tone used to deliver the message that the change brings him âa really good feelingâ demonstrates Gidonâs approval of the change in parking fees. Furthermore, Gidon states this in a high pitch and fast pace, unveiling that he is pleased and satisfied about the reduction in hospital parking fees.Â\n\nStep 3: Interaction between speakers.Â\n\nThis step does not apply to this particular audio clip since the audio/ video is a recount of the event rather than direct conversation between two or more speakers.Â\n\n3rd Time ListeningÂ Â\n\nThe transcript is available HERE.Â\n\nWhilst reading through the transcript with the audio on, try and pick up any information that you missed in previous rounds of listening and also words that you might have spelt incorrectly.Â\n\nSample Questions and Answers\n\nHave a go at these VCAA-style questions that I wrote up, and then check out my sample answers to see how your own answers compare. You will probably notice that a lot of the information you gather from the âWâ words actually provides you with the answers to the majority of the questions here.\n\nSample Questions\n\nSample Answers\n\n1.Â Gidonâs petition is about lowering the fee for parking in hospitals and putting a limit on how much the hospital can charge.\n\n2. Gidon has a rare blood condition which means he visits the hospital quite regularly. Since his diagnosis, Gidonâs family paid more than ten thousand dollars just to visit the hospital.\n\n3.Â When hospital parking fees are too expensive, patients will buy food and other necessities instead of going to the hospital. Thus, patients may not go to the hospital because parking is too expensive, these poor patients need to choose between paying parking fees and buying food.Â\n\n4. Regular hospital attendants will receive a 90% discount on what they are currently paying.\n\nÂ 5. Families, patients and carers for regular visitors of public hospitals.\n\nCOMMON MISTAKE: check the spelling for âcarerâ, not âcareerâ or âcarrierâ\n\n6. Gidon is very happy and proud of the change in hospital fees. Gidon uses a cheerful and hopeful tone (1st mark) to deliver the message that the change brings him âa really good feelingâ and he feels âunbelievably proudâ that âsmall people can make great changeâ (2nd mark). In addition, Gidon states this in a high pitch and fast pace, demonstrating that he is pleased and satisfied with the "
