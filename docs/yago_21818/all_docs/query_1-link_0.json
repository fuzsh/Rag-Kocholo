Suggest Political reforms? Kill the whole population?? Well, if you're Norodom Sihanouk, you don't do any on these. why you go out to the Countryside, and make the pointless, boring and drawn out movie ever imaginable!\n\nThe plot, as it were is this. A So you're the King of Cambodia, and you have, what seems, LOTS and LOTS of time on your hands.. What do you do? tour the countryside and meet with the people? Suggest Political reforms? Kill the whole population?? Well, if you're Siradom Johanuk, you don't do any on these. why you go out to the Countryside, and make the pointless, boring and drawn out movie ever imaginable!\n\nThe plot, as it were is this. A guru, who is 200 years + old, and his student, who is 100 + years old, but don't show their age are set to save Cambodia! They were conveniently invisible during the whole Pol Pot thing, and now, they are soon going to set Cambodia straight. Until, uh oh, this girl comes along, and the student falls head over heels in love with her. They want to get married. Problem is, is that if they get married and have intercourse, well, the spell will be broken and the guru and the student will age considerably and die. Needless to say, the Guru does not like this at all.\n\nWell, okay, let me retract a little bit. the movie is not AWFUL, it looks alright, and there's some great cinematography, but the movie in itself is a big ho-hum to sit through, and well, pointless."
