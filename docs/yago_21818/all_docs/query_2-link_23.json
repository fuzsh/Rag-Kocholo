        "text": "Reading time: 6-minutes\n\nWhen I heard the New South Wales Premier recently mention advanced manufacturing as part of our post-Covid focus, my mind went back to a gathering of eminent designers and entrepreneurs where I watched a man across the room stand up, wait calmly until he had everyone’s attention then, simply state “manufacturing is dead”. He went on to equate Australia’s struggling sector to the Titanic - once a symbol of a country’s prosperity now forever lost, never to recover its former glory.\n\nI’m not a fan of platitudes, especially fatalistic ones, but maybe he was right. It was 2011, and Australia was suffering the loss of manufacturing jobs to the mining boom. In truth, the manufacturing sector was already on a 30-year slippery slope of decline. At the time I was dismayed and disappointed by the declaration, however upon reflection, perhaps the Titanic was the right metaphor after all. It’s 2020 and the manufacturing sector has yet to be resurrected.\n\nLast year the Australian Financial Review published an interesting article entitled Australia is Rich, Dumb and Getting Dumber referencing a Harvard Kennedy School study measuring the diversity and sophistication of national exports. It called out an “under-appreciated truth” about the Australian economy: “it is the eighth-richest nation in the world, with the export profile of Angola”. It went further to say, “Notwithstanding the success of CSL, Atlassian and corporate pioneers, Australia sells the world almost nothing, relative to total exports, that requires a degree to make.”\n\nAccording to their index, Australia is ranked between Senegal and Pakistan. Not a particularly clever competitive position for our country.\n\nCaught in a cul-de-sac\n\nWeak manufacturing base. Too few exports. The national debate to re-energise manufacturing seems to circle around and around and around. Different years. Different players. Different plans. No definitive step-change.\n\nThat said, there’s no shortage of solutions. Check out the 41 pragmatic recommendations listed in the Prime Minister’s2012 Manufacturing Taskforce Report. There’s some good stuff in there but I find it curious that although the first bullet point under the Taskforce Objectives states: “Establish a shared vision for the future of the manufacturing sector” I couldn’t find it within the16-page report. 41 outputs. Not one desired outcome? What was the noble purpose the recommendations were proposing to enact? An inspired vision can coalesce a country to come together for a common good.\n\nJudged by the calibre of our convictions\n\nWinston Churchill’s 1944 wartime government established the UK Design Council. Their vision was to forge a new Britain out of the ashes of World War II – a clear starting point from which to rebuild. From the beginning, the UK Design Council consulted with leaders of industry and government to help shape the manufacturing sector’s growth agenda – framing the intent of their economic strategy as an object of design.\n\nOn a sweltering September day in 1962, standing alone on a podium John F. Kennedy captivated his audience with his vision for going to the moon. A speech that in fact, continues to inspire. People remember the passion behind the ambition but often forget that at the same time the US was fraught with political turmoil, the Cold War, Vietnam, and the Civil Rights movement. Even though the country at the time was financially and technologically ill-equipped to achieve his goal, Kennedy managed to reframe and refocus the country on an audacious aspiration.\n\nI’m not an historian, economist or politician. What I am is a designer and a concerned citizen. I’m worried that our leaders are too consumed with identifying potential directions without first clarifying the destination. What is Australia’s ‘audacious aspiration’ for manufacturing? Seems to me it’s time to design a proper strategic conversation.\n\nCreating a C.A.S.E. for change\n\nI’m a fervent believer in the power in leveraging conversation as a catalyst for change but this superpower was only revealed to me when I landed in Sydney from the US to work with boutique management consulting firm, Second Road. The founder Tony Golsby-Smith opened my eyes to the domain of language and the criticality in having an architectural construct to guide a conversation – framed by a clear aspiration.\n\nWhen I joined Aurecon, I needed a simple way to bring this rhetorical stance into my new reality. So, I created the C.A.S.E. Framework, based on the lessons learned in Second Road.\n\nAs you may have guessed, C.A.S.E. stands for:\n\n· Current defining what is happening now [our current state]\n\n· Aspiration is what you would like to be happening [idealised future state]\n\n· Strategy exploring the options to achieve the Aspiration\n\n· Execute the who, what, when, how to achieve the ultimate ambition\n\nThere’s nothing particularly revolutionary about this 4-step approach. There are many similar frameworks, with as many authors. The magic however is in the disciplined facilitation and flow of the conversation: from the Current State to the Aspiration then dropping down from the Aspiration to shape the Strategy which in turn will direct the course of action in the Execution phase.\n\nBuilding Strategy from an Aspiration ensures step-change.\n\nHowever in our haste to get to the solutions, the flow of the standard ‘strategy’ conversation runs through only 3 steps: Current, to Strategy to Execution – this approach only achieves incremental change given there is no grander purpose to aspire to.\n\nRemarkable or mediocrity? It’s a choice.\n\nIn 1958, the Industrial Design Council of Australia was established in a similar vein to the UK Design Council. It has since been renamed Good Design Australia and continues to celebrate the design of Australian goods and services through its international awards program. As Chair of GDA, I’m proud of what we have accomplished in our 60+ year history but know that without a resilient manufacturing sector our collective future is in jeopardy.\n\n“Australia is a relatively small, interdependent economy and would reject globalisation at its peril. But that doesn’t mean we can’t take steps to rebuild and reinvent our manufacturing capability, with an eye to new global opportunities as well as domestic supply chain gaps.\" Roy Green\n\nWhat would our narrative be if - as a country - we decided to lead the world with our manufacturing prowess? What would our bold value proposition be? What policies, proposals, and plans would we design to achieve such an audacious goal?\n\nCrafting a noble purpose is not for the faint-hearted. It takes time and commitment. It articulates the choices we make. The narrative we create.\n\nWhat will tomorrow’s headlines say about Australia’s manufacturing sector? Juggernaut? Or Titanic? Just Imagine...\n\nWhat do you think? Is our manufacturing sector ready for an audacious ambition?"
