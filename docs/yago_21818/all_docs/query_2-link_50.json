        "text": "💡 Remember, Your Assistant is Human Too... Over my last couple posts, I talked about the hurdles of working with an Overseas Assistant. But let's imagine for a second that every single issue was solved. They're in a big city, in a huge firm, surrounded by generators, and even local troublemakers are kept at bay with bribes. Plus, they've synced up with your North American hours. But here's the thing – your Assistant is a person, with a life outside work. They've got families, hobbies, weddings, funerals, their kids' dance recitals, and soccer games. All happening in THEIR daytime hours, while they're working your North American hours. 🌞🌜 How many family milestones can they miss before it’s just too much? And then there's the health angle. Ever heard about the risks of night-shift work? Google it. The findings are startling – everything from heart disease to a shorter lifespan. That’s some heavy stuff. 💔 Missing out on life's moments, plus health risks? An Overseas Assistant might not be the Mini-Me Assistant you're looking for. Sure, they could be great for other roles, but as your right-hand person? It's a tough call. Business is tricky enough without adding unnecessary complications. Why struggle to fit a square peg in a round hole with an Overseas Assistant when you can simplify? Think about it. What's more important? Saving a few bucks or ensuring you've got someone who can truly be there, in all the ways that count? Being cheap on hiring an Assistant is one of the most expensive mistakes you could ever make.\n\n💡 Remember, Your Assistant is Human Too...

Consider where you’ll reside, the logistics of moving your personal belongings, and envision what your ideal new life will look like. 🛩 Plan Once you have a clear idea, create a plan working backwards for job prospects that are best suited to your timeline. i.e. if you're needing to work right away, what recruiter can I get in contact with to pick up a short-term contract while I hunt for my dream role. 🛩 Communicate with Your Current Employer Discussing your plans with your employer a few months in advance could open unexpected doors. In my experience, my previous leaders were supportive and helped connect me with contacts in my desired city. If you’re aiming for progression or a promotion, this conversation might spark internal opportunities. 🛩 Build Connections Early Once your timeline is realistic and you've researched visas and work requirements, start connecting with relevant hiring managers and recruiters. Be transparent about your plans. For example, \"I intend to arrive on [specific date] but will need at least three weeks to settle before starting a new role.\" Setting the right expectations is crucial for building trust and your professional reputation. 🛩 Update Your Application Materials Ensure your CV and cover letters reflect your updated situation. Pro tip: If you have an overseas number, include it, or provide a WhatsApp number for contact. 😁 Stay Positive Relocating is complex and full of elements beyond your control. Always put your best foot forward and maintain a positive outlook. Relocating can be challenging, but with the right preparation and mindset, it can also be a rewarding experience. Best of luck to all those considering an overseas move! #relocating #jobmove (This advice is based on my personal experience for the purpose of seeking a job, and your situation may require a different approach. Ensure you gain legal advice from an immigration advisor.)\n\n#careerpathchange Want to ask what Dominika has in store for you all today? Career change adventures is the answer, my dear friends! What change? A change from being an Immigration Lawyer/Global Mobility Expert to IT Staffing Specialist. Quite unique journey, huh ;)? It will be absolutely justified, if you want to ask why for God sake you would give up career in law (after years of very demanding studies) for staffing IT project (having ZERO tech experience)?? And Lady, what this whole staffing actually is?? Okay, okay. Answers are coming your way. Staffing and Supply Coordinator in the simplest terms is ... choosing the right people from company’s available resources to the right projects opened by the clients. Easy peasy, right? Well, that’s the short version of generally very complex and demanding area of work. Are in which I had zero experience before. So, why did I choose it instead of something I was already trained for and that I was comfortable with? Three words: perspectives, growth and ambitions. Working in Global Mobility area was definitely an interesting time. Dealing with legalization of work and stay of foreigner employees was sometimes a very difficult and challenging tasks. Sometimes also a very rewarding one. To some extend that time made me the woman I am today. Stress resistant, ready to take on any challenge, used to multitasking, experienced in introducing process improvements and few others ;). However, there may come time in one’s life when perspective changes. For me it happened when I realized there is no more dragons to slay in GM area for me. Learning opportunities were not there anymore, space for growth in the team became too small. Also, I realized my specialization in Polish immigration law won’t necessary let me have the cool international career in business I was silently dreaming about ;). Luckily for me #EPAM is a company where changing career path is quite an easy and encouraged (!) process. With the support of my colleagues I found out that my amazing future boss Martyna has an opening in her OPS team. Two months later I joined the staffing world. And I couldn’t be happier about this choice. The best step for my career I could made. Have amazing team, learned tone of knowledge (e.g. IT related vocabulary, delivery specifics, basis of account management and many others), gained tone on skills and .... Actually most importantly, probably found out what my final career goal should be. But... that’s a story for another day ;). I can just tell you all that much for now: Account Operations universe – are you ready for me ;)? #MyEpamjourney #LifeAtEpam #IT #staffing #globalmobility #accountoperations #changes\n\nWhy we think #ExpatSpouseCareerSupport is Essential for the #Retention of Expats.
