        "text": "A care bundle for reducing perinatal mortality\n\nVersion 3.1, July 2023\n\nClassification: Official\n\nPublication reference: PRN00130\n\nExecutive summary\n\nThe Saving Babies’ Lives Care Bundle’ (SBLCB) provides evidence-based best practice, for providers and commissioners of maternity care across England to reduce perinatal mortality.\n\nThe NHS has worked hard towards the national maternity safety ambition, to halve rates of perinatal mortality from 2010 to 2025, and achieve a 20% reduction by 2020 (DHSC 2017). ONS data showed a 25% reduction in stillbirths in 2020, with the rate rising to 20% in 2021 with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. While significant achievements have been made in the past few years, more recent data show there is more to do to achieve the ambition in 2025.\n\nVersion 3 of the care bundle has been co-developed with clinical experts including front line clinicians, Royal Colleges, and professional societies; service users and maternity voices partnerships; and national organisations including charities, the Department of Health and Social Care and a number of arm’s length bodies (See Appendix A: Acknowledgements).\n\nBuilding on the achievements of previous iterations, Version 3 includes a refresh of all existing elements, drawing on national guidance such as from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) or the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) green top guidelines, and frontline learning to reduce unwarranted variation where the evidence is insufficient for NICE and RCOG to provide guidance. It also includes a new, additional element on the management of pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy based upon data from The National Pregnancy in Diabetes (NPID) audit. There are now 6 elements of care:\n\nElement 1: reducing smoking in pregnancy\n\nElement 1 focuses on reducing smoking in pregnancy by implementing NHS-funded tobacco dependence treatment services within maternity settings, in line with the NHS Long Term Plan and NICE guidance. This includes carbon monoxide testing and asking women about their smoking status at the antenatal booking appointment, as appropriate, throughout pregnancy. Women who smoke should receive an opt-out referral for in-house support from a trained tobacco dependence adviser who will offer a personalised care plan and support throughout pregnancy.\n\nElement 2: Fetal growth\n\nElement 2 covers fetal growth: risk assessment, surveillance, and management. Building on the widespread adoption of mid-trimester uterine artery Doppler screening for early onset fetal growth restriction (FGR) and placental dysfunction, Element 2 seeks to further improve FGR risk assessment by mandating the use of digital blood pressure measurement. It recommends a more nuanced approach to late FGR management to improve the assessment and care of mothers at risk of FGR, and lower rates of iatrogenic late preterm birth.\n\nElement 3: Raising awareness of reduced fetal movement\n\nElement 3 is focused on raising awareness of reduced fetal movement (RFM). This updated element encourages awareness amongst pregnant women of the importance of detecting and reporting RFM, and ensuring providers have protocols in place, based on best available evidence, to manage care for women who report RFM. Induction of labour prior to 39 weeks gestation is only recommended where there is evidence of fetal compromise or other concerns in addition to the history of RFM.\n\nElement 4: Effective fetal monitoring\n\nElement 4 promotes effective fetal monitoring during labour through ensuring all staff responsible for monitoring the fetus are competent in the techniques they use (IA and/or CTG) in relation to the clinical situation, use the buddy system, and escalate accordingly when concerns arise, or risks develop. This includes staff that are brought in to support a busy service from other clinical areas, as well as locum, agency of bank staff.\n\nElement 5: Reducing preterm birth\n\nElement 5 on reducing preterm birth recommends three intervention areas to reduce adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes: improving the prediction and prevention of preterm birth and optimising perinatal care when preterm birth cannot be prevented. All providers are encouraged to draw upon the learning from the existing BAPM toolkits and the wide range of resources from other successful regional programmes (e.g. PERIPrem resources, MCQIC).\n\nElement 6: Management of pre-existing diabetes\n\nThe new Element 6 covers the management of pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy for women with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, as the most significant modifiable risk factor for poor pregnancy outcomes. It recommends multidisciplinary team pathways and an intensified focus on glucose management within maternity settings, in line with the NHS Long Term Plan and NICE guidance. It includes clear documentation of assessing glucose control digitally; using HbA1c to risk stratify and provide additional support/surveillance (National Diabetes Audit data); and offering consistent access to evidence based Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) technology to improve glucose control (NICE and NHS plan).\n\nIn addition to the provision of safe and personalised care, achieving equity and reducing health inequalities is a key aim for all maternity and neonatal services and is essential to achieving the National Safety Ambition. Each element in SBLCB v3 has been reviewed to include actions to improve equity, including for babies from Black, Asian and mixed ethnic groups and for those born to mothers living in the most deprived areas, in accordance with the NHS equity and equality guidance.\n\nAs part of the Three year delivery plan for maternity and neonatal services, NHS trusts are responsible for implementing SBLCBv3 by March 2024 and integrated care boards (ICBs) are responsible for agreeing a local improvement trajectory with providers, along with overseeing, supporting, and challenging local delivery.\n\nSBLCBv3 also sets out a number of important wider principles to consider during implementation. These are not mandated by the care bundle but reflect best practice care and are recommended to be followed in conjunction with the 6 elements.\n\nForewords\n\nONS data suggests that because of the improvement in the perinatal mortality rate since 2010, at least 900 more babies will return home alive with their families this year. That is a great achievement, and all those who work in maternity and neonatal services should be incredibly proud of our progress towards the National Safety Ambition.\n\nThe recent rise in the perinatal mortality rate is likely to be related to the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and is a stark reminder that there will always be challenges to reducing stillbirths and neonatal deaths. The trajectory to meet the national ambition was unlikely to ever be a simple linear progression, particularly as the factors that lead to avoidable perinatal mortality are many and varied. We should all acknowledge that while we have reduced avoidable deaths, there is more to be done.\n\nIf we are to meet the national ambition for a 50% reduction in the stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates by 2025, we need to address longstanding inequitable outcomes associated with ethnicity and levels of deprivation. While it is clear that some solutions lie beyond the control of the health sector, our services must do everything possible to mitigate against the wider social determinants of health to continue to drive down the perinatal mortality rate.\n\nThe need to continuously iterate and improve care is why we have developed Version 3 of the care bundle at pace. Clinical experts, professional bodies, charities, service users and national regulators have collaborated to develop national best practice. It is important to remember that the care bundle is just one of a series of interventions to help reduce perinatal mortality and pre-term birth and shouldn’t be implemented in isolation. The Three year delivery plan for maternity and neonatal services describes more broadly how providers should continue to implement best practice care wherever possible and a set of wider principles are included in this version of the care bundle.\n\nDespite the recent set back in perinatal mortality rates the stillbirth rate was still 19% lower in 2021 than in 2010, and the neonatal mortality rate 30% lower. Thank you to all those who have worked tirelessly to drive improvement in our maternity services, whether they be NHS employees, parents or charities. I am confident that the collaborative approach modelled by the Saving Babies’ Lives Care Bundle will continue to deliver improvements in outcomes and reduce the number of parents who have to face the tragedy of perinatal bereavement.\n\nMatthew Jolly National Clinical Director for Maternity and Women’s Health, NHS England\n\nOn behalf of the Royal College of Midwives, I welcome the publication of this third version of the Saving Babies’ Lives Care Bundle. We continue to support the ambition to achieve a 50% reduction in stillbirths and maternal and neonatal deaths by 2025. The care bundle to date has made a vital contribution to achieving this.\n\nThe RCM know that the relationships that professionals form in the workplace, in their teams and with women, are key to safety and preventing the avoidable tragedies of stillbirth and the death of babies. We are therefore pleased to see continued emphasis on professionals working together and with women to help them to make choices about their care and reduce the risks to their baby.\n\nGill Walton, Chief Executive, Royal College of Midwives\n\nAs Saving Babies’ Lives Care Bundle (SBLCBv3) enters its third edition and its 7th year, it continues to innovate and drive forward quality improvement in key areas of maternity care. We welcome the addition of an element covering diabetes in pregnancy and the continued development of the other successful five elements. This version builds on versions 1 and 2, to focus on supporting those caring for pregnant women and to help support women to make choices about their care and reduce unnecessary intervention.\n\nWhenever a new guideline is introduced, it will always have limitations and there will be compromises to be made influenced by lack of current evidence and resource requirements to support successful implementation. However, the premise of the bundle is to reduce variation and provide a framework for continuous improvement. This will be supported by ongoing learning from evaluation of the bundle and is key to its success and value.\n\nThe Saving Babies’ Lives Care Bundle is part of a number of initiatives to improve maternity care and safety. However, there are areas that we urgently need to address if we are to ensure a continued reduction in perinatal mortality for all women and babies. We must, therefore, harness the expertise and experience of obstetricians and specialists in fetal and maternal medicine, frontline maternity teams, academics and policymakers to tackle inequality and the social determinants of health in the pregnant population.\n\nBMFMS is honoured to have worked closely on all three versions of SBLCB and fully supports the initiatives within this new version and the opportunity to work to deliver improvements in maternity care.\n\nKatie Morris, President, British Maternal and Fetal Medicine Society\n\nEvery day, maternity services support thousands of women and their families through pregnancy and childbirth. The majority of those using maternity services have good outcomes and report a positive experience of care but maternity care is complex and, unfortunately, adverse events occur.\n\nRecent public inquiries into maternity care have emphasised the importance of continued learning and action on improving safety. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists warmly welcomes the publication of the third version of the Saving Babies’ Lives Care Bundle, which will support further progress towards a 50% reduction in the rate of stillbirths, neonatal mortality and serious brain injury and a reduction of pre term births from 8% to 6% in the UK by 2025, as set in the NHS Long Term Plan.\n\nMaternity care is delivered through multi-professional teams working together to support all women, requiring a wide range of skills, knowledge and expertise, and a supportive context in which these can be applied. By implementing the evidence-based, best practice elements of the Saving Babies’ Lives Care Bundle, local maternity teams can ensure women receive personalised care that will continue to reduce perinatal mortality.\n\nImportantly, each element of the care bundle includes action to improve equity, including for babies from Black, Asian and mixed ethnic groups and for those born to mothers living in the most deprived areas. Maternity systems must continue work to embed these into their local action plans.\n\nThe care bundle aligns with and complements a range of other important maternity safety initiatives and tools, including wider work being taken forward through the Maternity Transformation Programme as well as initiatives such as the Avoiding Brain Injury in Childbirth (ABC) programme.\n\nThe Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists will continue to work with partners, including other Royal Colleges, national policymakers and safety leaders, to support the NHS to implement these together, to improve the quality and safety of care that women and babies receive in the UK.\n\nDr Ranee Thakar, President, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists\n\nHaving achieved the first national ambition milestone of reducing by 20% the perinatal mortality rate by 2020 the focus is now on achieving the further 30% reduction by 2025. This will require accelerated progress in the face of having probably dealt with the ‘easier’ problems to prevent and manage.\n\nActivities on multiple fronts are going to be required which is why, amongst other actions, the full implementation in all trusts of the Saving Babies’ Lives Care Bundle is needed. This, the third version of the Care Bundle, is a welcome reminder of the five elements from version two and the introduction of a sixth new element to improve diabetic management in pregnancy for women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n\nAs demonstrated in the National Diabetes in Pregnancy Audit, monitoring and managing tight glycaemic control from pre-pregnancy and throughout pregnancy is key to reducing the risks of adverse outcomes including congenital anomalies and perinatal death. The 2022 MBRRACE-UK maternal confidential enquiry illustrated the risks to both diabetic pregnant women and their babies of poorly managed diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\nThe steps outlined in element six of the new version of the Care Bundle provide practical advice for service delivery to support improved management for this high-risk group of mothers and babies. Achieving the improvements that could be realised from the full implementation of all six elements of the new version of the Care Bundle will provide some of the essential pieces of the jigsaw of activities still needed to further reduce the national rate of perinatal deaths.\n\nProfessor Jenny Kurinczuk, Professor of Perinatal Epidemiology; Director, National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit; National Programme Lead MBRRACE-UK/PMRT, University of Oxford\n\nDespite falls in perinatal mortality in recent years, too many parents and families are still devastated by the death of their baby. The exact impact of Covid 19 is as yet unclear but it’s very possible that the pandemic has had a significant negative impact not just on women and pregnant people’s experiences of maternity, but crucially on outcomes for both them and their babies. Importantly, the government is unlikely to meet the National Ambition to halve stillbirths and neonatal baby deaths by 2025.\n\nComing in the wake of further investigations into poor care such as the Ockenden and East Kent reports, this third version of the Saving Babies’ Lives Care Bundle has urgency towards ensuring better, safer care. This new version maintains the focus of version two but adds another crucially important element around caring for women with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes who we know to be at 4-5 times increased risk of losing their baby. This version also encourages awareness among those who are pregnant of the importance of early warning signals that something may be wrong, such as noticing and reporting reduced fetal movements (RFM).\n\nAn innovation in this version is an assurance tool to help Trusts track their progress in implementation, thereby removing the need to have regular implementation surveys.\n\nListening to bereaved parents’ experiences is vital in understanding why babies die, and learning from every baby’s death is essential part of the continual improvement that underpins this Care Bundle. Parents tell us that if lessons can be learned from the death of their baby it can help them live with their grief, providing an important and lasting legacy.\n\nThis updated, third version of the Saving Babies’ Lives Care Bundle carries essential knowledge for every healthcare professional who supports and works with those who are pregnant. It helps address inequalities with the same emphasis of continuity of carer, especially for those from black and minority ethnic backgrounds and those living in areas of social deprivation. When the worst happens, it ensures standards in bereavement care, in line with the National Bereavement Care Pathway.\n\nWe welcome its implementation and believe that it provides an opportunity to protect babies’ lives in the future\n\nClea Harmer\n\nChief Executive, Sands\n\nTommy’s work is dedicated to reducing rates of pregnancy complications and baby loss as we know the heartbreak and devastation this causes far too many parents and families. Despite ambitious targets, the rates of stillbirth and preterm birth are not falling as quickly as we would have hoped, and indeed the stillbirth rates sadly rose in 2021. It is also clear that variation in care continues, and not all women and birthing people have the same chance of taking home a healthy baby – the outcome every family deserves.\n\nSo, we warmly welcome version 3 of the Saving Babies’ Lives Care Bundle as a vital resource for all professionals involved in supporting people to have a safe and healthy pregnancy and birth.\n\nResearch is continually advancing understanding and growing evidence and it is vital this is translated into improvements in care. While this guidance has been produced before the evaluation of version 2, we support the fast tracking of new evidence so that everyone can benefit as quickly as possible, and potentially more babies’ lives can be saved.\n\nWe know from the MBRRACE data that some communities continue to experience much poorer outcomes than others. This is unacceptable and we’re therefore particularly pleased that version 3 has been reviewed from an inequity standpoint and highlights the promotion of equity and equality as an important principle to apply when implementing the care bundle. It is also positive to see that continuity of carer is explicitly noted as a key intervention to improve equitable outcomes.\n\nA key addition to version 3 is the management of diabetes in pregnancy. The number of women and birthing people with diabetes is on the rise and perinatal mortality rates for pregnant people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes have remained very high for the last five years. This practical guidance should standardise pathways and join these up with other aspects of maternity care to reduce risk.\n\nThe care bundle also contains a renewed focus on reduced fetal movement (RFM). This is such an important message given the relationship between episodes of RFM and stillbirth, and the vital role of timely hospital attendance and fetal monitoring. Everyone must feel they can and should contact their hospital if they are worried that their baby’s movements have changed.\n\nThis version of the bundle is another important step on the journey to safer pregnancy and birth. We know that when all maternity units follow these actions, fewer families will face the heartbreak and devastation of pregnancy complications and loss.\n\nKath Abrahams, Chief Executive, Tommy’s\n\nPreterm birth causes 78% of deaths in the neonatal period (first 28 days of life)*and is also a major contributor to childhood disability and poorer neurodevelopmental outcome. Interventions to reduce the impact of prematurity on morbidity and mortality must therefore be a major focus to move towards the national ambition to halve the rate of stillbirth, neonatal death, maternal death and serious intrapartum brain injury by 2025.\n\nBAPM therefore welcomes expansion of element 5 in the SBLCB v3 which aims to reduce preterm birth where possible and optimise perinatal care where preterm birth cannot be prevented. Given the importance of the interventions in improving outcomes, BAPM strongly encourages trusts to ensure that appropriate time is allocated to the neonatal medical and nursing leads of the preterm birth team, in addition to the maternity and obstetric leads, to allow rapid implementation.\n\n*National Child Mortality Database Thematic Report: The contribution of Newborn Health to Child Mortality across England. July 2022\n\nEleri Adams, BAPM President\n\nIntroduction\n\nProgress towards the National Safety Ambition\n\nIn 2015, the Secretary of State for Health announced a national safety ambition, to halve the rates of stillbirths, neonatal and maternal deaths and intrapartum brain injuries by 2030, with a 20% reduction by 2020. In 2017, the ambition was extended to include a reduction in the rate of preterm births from 8% to 6%, while the date to achieve the ambition was also brought forward to 2025.\n\nOffice for National Statistics (ONS) data (shown in Figure 1, below) demonstrated a 25% reduction in stillbirths between 2010 and 2020 from 5.1 to 3.8 per thousand births, showing the 2020 milestone had been exceeded for stillbirths. It is not absolutely clear why stillbirth rates increased during the Covid pandemic, but it is likely that the direct effects of the Covid virus as well as the indirect impact of the pandemic on accessing maternity services played a part in the increase of the stillbirth rate from 3.8 per 1000 births in 2020 to 4.1 in 2021. The neonatal mortality rate also increased between 2020 and 2021 from 1.3 to 1.4 per 1000 live births at 24 weeks gestation and over. Despite the significant challenges faced by the NHS, these rates remain 19% and 30% lower (respectively) than in 2010. This equates to more than 900 families returning home with a healthy baby in 2021, than if the rates had remained unchanged from 2010.\n\nThe latest data on serious brain injury shows that rate of occurrence during or soon after birth fell by 9% between 2014 and 2019 to 4.25 per 1000 live births. Further reduction in the rate is needed to meet the 2025 ambition, a rate of 2.16 per 1000 live births.\n\nFigure 1: National maternity safety ambition – summary of progress on stillbirths\n\nDespite the achievements of the past few years and in light of the recent setbacks, there is clearly much more to be done to achieve the ambition by 2025. In particular, there is a need to address inequitable outcomes associated with ethnicity and levels of deprivation. MBRRACE-UK perinatal mortality surveillance data show that the lowest stillbirth rates were for babies of White ethnicity from the least deprived areas, at 2.78 per 1,000 total births. The highest stillbirth rates were for babies of Black African and Black Caribbean ethnicity from the most deprived areas, at around 8 per 1,000 total births. The pattern is similar for neonatal deaths. Maternity services must do everything possible to mitigate against the wider social determinants of health in order toto continue to drive down the perinatal mortality rate.\n\nProgress of the Saving Babies’ Lives Care Bundle\n\nThe first version of the Saving Babies’ Lives Care Bundle (SBLCBv1) was published in March 2016, and focused predominantly on reducing the stillbirth rate. An independent evaluation in 2018 showed a decrease in stillbirths in participating trusts, concluding that despite being one of many concurrent interventions, it was highly plausible that version 1 had contributed to the reduction.\n\nThe evaluation helped inform the development of Care bundle version 2. Launched in March 2019, version 2 aimed to go further in reducing stillbirth while also minimising unnecessary intervention. In answer to the expansion of the national safety ambition in 2017, it introduced element 5 on reducing pre-term birth, and further decreasing perinatal mortality.\n\nThe care bundle is now a universal innovation in the delivery of maternity care in England and continues to drive quality improvement to reduce perinatal mortality. It has been included for a number of years in the NHS Long Term Plan, NHS Planning Guidance, the Standard Contract and the CNST Maternity Incentive Scheme, with every maternity provider expected to have fully implemented SBLCBv2 by March 2020.\n\nONS and MBRRACE-UK data demonstrate the urgent need to continue reducing preventable mortality. Published 4 years after SBLCBv2, Version 3 of the care bundle (SBLCBv3) has been developed through a collaboration of frontline clinical experts, service users and key stakeholder organisations. All existing elements have been updated, incorporating learning from the Clinical Negligence Scheme for trusts: Maternity Incentive Scheme (CNST MIS) and insights from NHS England’s regional maternity teams. SBLCBv3 aligns with national guidance from NICE and the RCOG Green Top Guidelines where available but it aims to reduce unwarranted variation where the evidence is insufficient for NICE and RCOG to provide guidance. SBLCBv3 also includes a new element on optimising care for women with pregnancies complicated by diabetes.\n\nWhile SBLCBv3 would ideally be informed by the evaluation of SBLCBv2, this has been delayed due to the pandemic. Stakeholders agreed that improvements to best practice couldn’t be delayed when evidence is readily available for improvements to several elements. The evaluation of SBLCBv2 remains a priority and will be published in 2023. Findings will help inform the next iteration of SBLCB, which will also include important innovations from the Avoiding Brain Injury in Childbirth (ABC) collaboration along with anticipated updates to Green Top Guidance.\n\nSBLCBv3 should not be implemented in isolation, but as one of a series of important interventions to help reduce perinatal mortality and preterm birth. It is important that providers continue to implement best practice care whenever possible, including by following NICE guidance and using the National Maternity and Neonatal Recommendations Register to assess their organisations’ compliance with recommendations from confidential enquiries and other key national reports.\n\nImplementing version 3 of the care bundle\n\nAs part of the Three Year Delivery Plan for Maternity and Neonatal Services, all NHS maternity providers are responsible for fully implementing SBLCBv3 by March 2024.\n\nOverseeing implementation\n\nAn implementation tool is being developed and will be available by May 2023 on the Maternity Transformation Programme’s Future NHS platform. This tool will support providers to baseline current practice against SBLCBv3, agree a local improvement trajectory with their ICB, and track progress locally in accordance with that trajectory.\n\nTo reduce assurance burdens, national implementation surveys are being stepped down. Instead, trusts will be asked to use the implementation tool in 2 ways to ensure local oversight:\n\nTrack and demonstrate compliance to the Trust Board and ICBs. ‘Full implementation’ of the care bundle means completing all interventions for all 6 elements. Compliance will therefore be expressed as a percentage of completed interventions for each element, and across all elements.\n\nHolding quarterly quality improvement discussions with the ICB. These provider-commissioner discussions should include, at a minimum:\n\nDetails of element specific improvement work being undertaken including evidence of generating and using the process and outcome metrics for each element.\n\nProgress against locally agreed improvement aims.\n\nEvidence of sustained improvement where high levels of reliability have already been achieved.\n\nRegular review of local themes and trends with regard to potential harms in each of the six elements.\n\nSharing of examples and evidence of continuous learning by individual trusts with their local ICB and neighbouring Trusts.At 39+0 weeks\n\nWhile there will be no routine, deadline-based submissions of data to the national NHS England team for the purposes of assurance, the maternity team will review data stored on trust implementation tools on an ad-hoc basis to assess national progress in implementation.\n\nOrganisational roles and responsibilities\n\nSuccessful implementation of SBLCBv3 requires providers, commissioners, and networks to collaborate successfully. National levers including NHS Planning Guidance, the NHS Standard Contract, and Safety Action 6 in the CNST Maternity Incentive Scheme will be updated in due course to reflect the following organisational responsibilities:\n\nProviders are responsible for implementing SBLCBv3, including baselining current compliance, developing an improvement trajectory, and reporting on implementation with their ICB as agreed locally. They are also responsible for submitting data nationally relating to key process and outcome measures for each element.\n\nICBs are responsible for agreeing a local improvement trajectory with providers, along with overseeing, supporting, and challenging local delivery. Where there is unresolved clinical debate about a pathway, providers may wish to agree a variation to an element of the care bundle with their integrated care board. An integral part of ICSs, LMNSs are accountable to ICBs and have the system’s maternity and neonatal expertise to support planning and provide leadership for improvement, facilitating peer support, and ensuring that learning from implementation and ongoing provision of SBLCBv3 is shared across the System footprint.\n\nClinical Networks and Regional Maternity teams are responsible for providing support to providers, ICBs and LMNSs to enable delivery and achieve expected outcomes. It is important that specific variations from the pathways described within SBLCBv3 are agreed as acceptable clinical practice by their Clinical Network.\n\nPrinciples to be applied when implementing version 3\n\nIt has been necessary to restrict the scope of the SBLCBv3 to ensure it is deliverable. Nevertheless, it is just one of a series of important interventions to help reduce perinatal mortality and preterm birth. The following principles should be considered alongside implementing the care bundle.\n\nPromoting equity and equality\n\nHealth inequalities are unfair and avoidable differences in health across the population, and between different groups within society. Equity in maternity and neonatal care means that all mothers and babies have a fair and just opportunity to attain the best health outcomes. To achieve equity and reduce inequalities, action must be universal, but with a scale and intensity proportionate to the level of disadvantage; this is known as ‘proportionate universalism’ (Marmot 2010).\n\nEngland is one of the safest countries in the world to give birth. However, stillbirth rates and neonatal death rates are higher for some groups, such as women who are Black, Asian and those living in the most deprived areas. This emphasises the need for a continued focus to address these inequalities when implementing the care bundle. This includes ensuring that services reflect the needs of different groups, with support increasing as health inequalities increase. This requires use of quantitative and qualitative data on the local population and their health needs, along with co-production, to inform pathways and processes during implementation. Maternity and neonatal services also need to respond to each person’s unique health and social situation –– so that care is safe and personal for all.\n\nContinuous improvement activity related to each element of the care bundle will routinely require consideration of access, experience, and outcomes in relation to protected characteristics and other variables influencing inequalities, such as factors related to deprivation. Pathways and processes should be changed, or additional supportive activity carried out, to address any inequity or inequalities identified.\n\nWhile most people using maternity and perinatal services are women, the CQC Maternity Survey (2022) found that 0.65% of respondents stated that their gender was not the same as their sex registered at birth. Intersex, transgender, and non-binary people experiencing pregnancy and birth can experience particular health inequalities including poorer access and a lack of information and support in relation to their specific clinical and care needs within maternity services.\n\nThe role of midwifery continuity of carer\n\nEvidence shows that continuity models improve safety and outcomes; women who receive Midwifery Continuity of Carer (MCoC) are 16% less likely to lose their baby, 19% less likely to lose their baby before 24 weeks and 24% less likely to experience preterm birth1. It is widely acknowledged that it is beneficial for women to know and form a relationship with the professionals caring for them2. It is a recurring theme within confidential enquiries that some groups in society struggle to access health care, and/or raise concerns.\n\nThe implementation of MCoC has been challenging particularly in the context of the pandemic and staffing shortages. Whilst the ambition remains for MCoC to be the default model of care for all women, currently there is not a national target timeframe for this to be achieved. In September 2022, NHS England published a letter asking trusts to review their safe staffing levels and decide to either: continue existing MCoC provision and continue to roll out; cease further rollout and continue with current levels of provision; or immediately suspend existing MCoC provision.\n\nMCoC remains an important intervention to address higher perinatal mortality rates in Black and Asian women and women from economically disadvantaged groups. In line with the CORE20PLUS5 strategy, Local Maternity and Neonatal Systems, regional and national colleagues will continue to support Trusts with sufficient staffing to focus rollout of MCoC to neighbourhoods with high numbers of women from Black, Asian, and Mixed ethnic groups, and women living in deprived areas, for whom CoC is linked to significant improvements in clinical outcomes3 .\n\nInformed choice and personalised care\n\nEvidence shows that better outcomes and experiences, as well as reduced health inequalities, are possible when pregnant women can actively shape their care and support. Personalised care means pregnant women have choice and control over the way their care is planned and delivered, based on best available evidence, ‘what matters’ to them and their individual strengths, needs and preferences. Pregnant women receiving maternity care make informed decisions. They and their maternity professionals discuss evidence-based options together exploring preferences, benefits, risks, and consequences to enable a safe and positive experience.\n\nFor any given situation where a decision needs to be made, women are supported by their maternity professionals to understand their options, the benefits, harms and consequences of each. They have all the information they need for shared decision making and give consent, in line with the Montgomery ruling.\n\nLinked to this principle, the following areas are of particular relevance to implementing a number of Elements in Version 3:\n\nInforming women of the long-term outcomes of early term birth\n\nOne of the key interventions in elements 2 and 3 of the SBLCBv3 is offering early birth for women at risk of stillbirth. It is important that this intervention is not extended to pregnancies not at risk. The Avoiding Term Admissions Into Neonatal units (Atain) programme has identified that babies born at 37 – 38 weeks gestation were twice as likely to be admitted to a neonatal unit than babies born at later gestations. There are also concerns about long term outcomes following early term birth (defined as 37 and 38 weeks). These concerns relate to potential long term adverse effects on the baby due to birth prior to reaching maturity, for example, the baby’s brain continues to develop at term 4 Birth results in huge changes to the baby’s physiology, for example, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen increases by a factor of three to four within minutes following birth and it is plausible that earlier exposure to these changes could alter long term development of the child’s brain and data exist to support this possibility4. One example is the risk that the child will subsequently have a record of special educational needs (SEN). The risk of this outcome is about 50% among infants born at 24 weeks of gestational age and it progressively falls with increasing gestational age at birth, only to bottom out at around 40 – 41 weeks.\n\nFigure 2: Prevalence of special educational needs by gestation at birth4.\n\nAfter adjusting for maternal and obstetric characteristics and expressed relative to birth at 40 weeks, the risk of SEN was increased by 36% (95% CI (confidence interval)) 27 – 45) at 37 weeks, by 19% (95% CI 14 – 25) at 38 weeks and by 9% (95% CI 4 – 14) at 39 weeks. The risk of subsequent SEN was 4.4% at 40 weeks. Hence, assuming causality, there would be one additional child with SEN for every 60 inductions at 37 weeks, for every 120 inductions at 38 weeks, and for every 250 inductions at 39 weeks compared with the assumption that they would otherwise have delivered at 40 weeks4. Recent data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study confirmed the finding that children born at early term gestational ages (37 to 38 weeks) were more likely to fail to achieve the expected level of attainment in primary school but, interestingly, there was no association between early term birth and poorer attainment at secondary school 5. Moreover, as the current data are based on the observed gestational age at birth, the negative associations with later outcome may be explained by the factors that determined early term birth rather than a direct effect of gestational age. However, induction of labour prior to 39 weeks should continue to be considered as a significant medical intervention which requires appropriate justification.\n\nConsidering how the risks of induction of labour change with gestational age\n\nFor uncomplicated pregnancies NICE guidance on induction of labour should be followed. In all cases of induction, it is important women receive a clear explanation about why they are being offered induction and that the risks, benefits and alternatives are discussed.\n\nAt 39+0 weeks gestation and beyond, induction of labour is not associated with an increase in caesarean section, instrumental vaginal birth, fetal morbidity or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit6. The NICE guidance and data from the ARRIVE study6 provide contradictory evidence as to whether induced labours are associated with a longer hospital stay or more painful labours. Induction of labour may also increase the workload of the maternity service which has the potential to impact the care of other women.\n\nSafe and healthy pregnancy information to enable women and their families to make informed choices regarding their health and reducing risks to their babies.\n\nIt is important that women have access to high quality information before and during their pregnancy to enable them to reduce risks to their baby. The Office for Health Inequalities and Disparities and Sands have developed some key messages:\n\nFigure 2: Summary of safe and healthy pregnancy key messages\n\nPre-pregnancy:\n\nChoose when to start or grow your family by using contraception.\n\nConsult with your GP if taking medication for long-term conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, epilepsy) as your medication may have to change prior to pregnancy.\n\nEat a healthy balanced diet and be physically active to enter pregnancy at a healthy weight.\n\nTake a daily supplement of 400 micrograms (400 µg) folic acid before conception (some women will require a higher dose of 5mg as advised by a healthcare professional).\n\nEnsure that you are up to date with routine vaccinations e.g., measles, rubella, Coronavirus (Covid 19), flu.\n\nFind out if you think you or your partner could be a carrier for a genetic disorder.\n\nStop smoking and/or exposure to second hand smoke.\n\nReduce/stop alcohol consumption.\n\nDuring pregnancy:\n\nContinue to take 400 micrograms (400 µg) folic acid until the 12th week of pregnancy (some women will require a higher dose of 5mg as advised by a healthcare professional).\n\nPregnant women should have 10µg of vitamin D a day.\n\nYou may be advised to take aspirin from 12 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAlcohol – the safest advice is to not drink alcohol, if you are concerned, talk to your midwife, or doctor and help and advice is available for you.\n\nDon’t smoke and avoid second hand smoke; support is available to help with this.\n\nDo tell your midwife if you use illegal street drugs or other substances, help is available for you.\n\nEat healthily and be physically active to maintain a healthy weight while pregnant.\n\nMaintain oral hygiene. Free dental care is available to all pregnant women and up to a year after the birth.\n\nRecommended vaccinations and boosters: seasonal flu; pertussis (whooping cough); Coronavirus (Covid-19)\n\nAlways check with your pharmacist, midwife of doctor about medicines and therapies used in pregnancy, even if you have taken them for a long time on prescription or think they are harmless.\n\nAvoid contact with people who have infectious illnesses, including diarrhoea, sickness, childhood illnesses or any rash-like illness.\n\nReduce the risk of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Toxoplasmosis, Monkeypox infections etc.,\n\nAttend all antenatal appointments.\n\nContact the maternity service promptly if you are worried about reduced fetal movements, vaginal bleeding, watery or unusual discharge, signs of pre-eclampsia or itching. Don’t wait!\n\nIn later pregnancy (after 28 weeks), it is safer to go to sleep on your side than on your back.\n\nAppendix B provides more detailed information on how women can plan, prepare, and look after themselves before and during pregnancy. This information is also available at NHS.uk and the Safer Pregnancy website developed by Sands.\n\nWorking within networks for more specialist care\n\nIn a number of specialist fields, maternity services are working within networks so that women and babies with complex needs have consistent access to the most specialist care, while also encouraging local expertise, and ensuring that care remains as close as possible to home.\n\nWhile a networked model has been in place for a number of years in fetal medicine and in neonatal care, NHS England announced the creation of 14 maternal medicine networks, which are now in operation across England.\n\nAll providers should be engaging in these networks and contributing to the development of joint protocols and ways of working. In this vein, new elements of best practice shouldn’t be implemented in isolation locally. Providers should consider what implications or opportunities this presents for ways of working agreed within wider maternal medicine, fetal medicine, or neonatal operational delivery networks.\n\nImplementing relevant NICE guidance\n\nIntegrated care systems/ boards (ICS/ICBs) are under an obligation in public law to have regard for NICE guidance and to provide clear reasons for any general policy that does not follow NICE guidance.\n\nProviders and commissioners are encouraged to implement NICE guidance relating to antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care. In particular, implementation of the NICE guidance on the management of diabetes in pregnancy, hypertension in pregnancy and multiple pregnancy, along with service provision for women with complex social factors are key to addressing some of the most significant contributors to perinatal mortality.\n\nBest practice care in the event of a stillbirth or neonatal death\n\nDespite the reduction in stillbirth rates sadly thousands of parents each year will experience the devastation of their baby dying before, during or shortly after birth. A best practice pathway for the clinical management of women experiencing stillbirth is available on the North West Coast (NWC) Strategic Clinical Network website.\n\nSands have developed a National Bereavement Care Pathway (NBCP) to help ensure that all bereaved parents are offered equal, high quality, individualised, safe and sensitive bereavement care when they experience pregnancy loss or the death of a baby. The NBCP is available at www.nbcpathway.org.uk.\n\nThe national Perinatal Mortality Review Tool (PMRT) is used to support hospital reviews by providing a standardised, structured process so that what happened at every stage of the pregnancy, birth and after, from booking through to bereavement care is carefully considered by staff reviewing care. This online tool may help staff understand why a baby has died and whether there are any lessons to be learned to saves future lives.\n\nContinuous improvement and maternity and neonatal services\n\nAs part of the update of SBLCBv3, we are maintaining an approach of continuous improvement. Within each element the focus is on a small number of outcomes with fewer process measures. Implementation of the elements will require a more comprehensive evaluation of each organisation’s processes and pathways and an understanding of where improvements can be made.\n\nEach organisation will be expected to look at their performance against the outcome measures for each element with a view to understanding where improvement may be required. We have provided suggested areas for improvement within each element, but these lists are not meant to be exhaustive.\n\nThere is an expectation that as well as reporting on the organisation’s implementation of each element, there will be complimentary reporting of ongoing improvement work (with associated detail of interventions, and improvement in process measures and outcomes) within each element. An integral component of this improvement work will be a focus on learning from incidents or enquiry. Harm may have occurred in relation to implementation of or non-compliance with an element described in the care bundle. The use of the Perinatal Mortality Review Tool will complement the investigation and learning in this context.\n\nElement 1: Reducing smoking in pregnancy.\n\nInterventions\n\n1.1 CO testing offered to all pregnant women at the antenatal booking and 36-week antenatal appointment.\n\n1.2 CO testing offered at all other antenatal appointments to groups identified within NICE Guidance NG209.\n\n1.3 Whenever CO testing is offered, it should be followed up by an enquiry about smoking status with the CO result and smoking status recorded.\n\n1.4 Instigate an opt-out referral for all women who have an elevated CO level (4ppm or above), who identify themselves as smokers or have quit in the last 2 weeks for treatment by a trained tobacco dependence treatment adviser (TDA) within an in-house tobacco dependence treatment service.\n\n1.5 Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) should be offered to all smokers and provision ensured as soon as possible.\n\n1.6 The tobacco dependence treatment includes behavioural support and NRT, initially 4 weekly sessions following the setting of the quit date then regularly (as required, however as a minimum monthly) throughout pregnancy to support the woman to remain smokefree.\n\n1.7 Feedback is provided to the pregnant woman’s named maternity health care professional regarding the treatment plan and progress with their quit attempt (including relapse). Where a woman does not book or attend appointments there should immediate notification back to the named maternity health care professional.\n\n1.8 Any staff member using a CO monitor, should have appropriate training on its use and discussion of the result.\n\n1.9 All staff providing maternity care to pregnant women should receive training in the delivery of Very Brief Advice (VBA) about smoking, making an opt-out referral and the processes within their maternity pathway (e.g., referral, feedback, data collection).\n\n1.10 Individuals delivering tobacco dependence treatment interventions should be fully trained to NCSCT standards\n\nContinuous learning\n\n1.11 When analysing patient safety incidents, maternity care providers should review smoking status throughout pregnancy and determine whether the appropriate pathway of care for this was followed.\n\n1.12 Maternity providers should regularly review (a minimum of quarterly) their smoking-related data to understand performance and develop improvement plans (this list is designed to provide a steer and is not exhaustive):\n\nA. Identification of women who smoke – Determine any factors that would optimise CO testing rates and enquiry about smoking status, from both the provider/pathway and service-user perspective and make changes to pathways and processes as appropriate.\n\nB. Training of staff – Ensure all staff involved in identification, referral and treatment of women who smoke, and provision of VBA are appropriately trained.\n\nC. Engagement – Determine and address any barriers to engagement with treatment services or compliance with treatment interventions from both the provider/pathway and service-user perspective.\n\nD. Referral – Determine and address any factors that are influencing opt-out referral, from both the provider/pathway perspective and service-user perspective.\n\nE. Quit rates – Consider the pathway holistically to determine which steps can be optimised to facilitate quit attempts and successful quits.\n\nF. Relapse – Determine factors that are contributing to relapse and whether additional support or changes to pathways may address these.\n\nG. Inequalities – Consider all the above by protected characteristics and other variables influencing inequalities, such as factors related to deprivation. Make changes to pathways and processes, or carry out additional supportive activity, to address any inequity or inequalities identified.\n\n1.13 In order to monitor quality and effectiveness of pathways, maternity services should set ambitions for their pathway with regular review (a minimum of quarterly) of data and targeted quality improvement work to ensure they are being achieved.\n\n1.14 Based on highly performing areas, stretching ambitions to achieve effective implementation of the full Element may include:\n\nA. 95% of women where CO measurement and smoking status is recorded at their booking appointment.\n\nB. 95% of women where CO measurement and smoking status is recorded at their 36-week appointment.\n\nC. 95% of smokers have an opt-out referral at booking for treatment by a TDA within an in-house service.\n\nD. 85% of all women referred for tobacco dependence treatment engage with the programme (have at least one session and receive a treatment plan).\n\nE. 60% of those referred for tobacco dependence treatment set a quit date.\n\nF. 60% of those setting a quit date successfully quit at 4 weeks.\n\nG. At least 85% of quitters should be CO verified.\n\n1.15 Individual providers should examine their outcomes in relation to other providers or systems with similar smoking prevalence or populations. National benchmarking is available through the Maternity Services Dashboard and will be available to ICS/LMS as the Tobacco dependence patient level collection is established.\n\nProcess indicators\n\n1a. Percentage of women where there is a record of:\n\n1.a.i. CO measurement at booking appointment\n\n1.a.ii. CO measurement at 36-week appointment\n\n1.a.iii. Smoking status** at booking appointment\n\n1.a.iv. Smoking status** at 36-week appointment\n\n1b. Percentage of smokers* that have an opt-out referral at booking to an in-house/in-reach tobacco dependence treatment service.\n\n1c. Percentage of smokers* that are referred for tobacco dependence treatment who set a quit date.\n\nOutcome indicators\n\n1d. Percentage of smokers* at antenatal booking who are identified as CO verified non-smokers at 36 weeks.\n\n1e. Percentage of smokers* that set a quit date and are identified as CO verified non-smokers at 4 weeks.\n\n* a “smoker” is a pregnant woman with an elevated CO level (4ppm or above) and identifies themselves as a smoker (smoked within the last 14 days) or has a CO level less than 4ppm but identifies as a smoker (smoked within the last 14 days).\n\n** Smoking status relates to the outcome of the CO test (>4ppm) and the enquiry about smoking habits.\n\nRationale\n\nSmoking increases the risk of pregnancy complications, such as stillbirth, preterm birth, miscarriage, low birthweight and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Whether or not a woman smokes during her pregnancy has a far-reaching impact on the health of a child throughout their life. Whilst a number of studies have found that the risk of a number of poor pregnancy outcomes can be reduced to that of a non-smoker if a successful quit is achieved early in pregnancy. Others show increased risk with any smoking in pregnancy, and increasing risk with continued smoking. This reinforces the need to support women to quit smoking as early as possible in pregnancy to reduce the risk of poor pregnancy outcomes.\n\nSmoking at time of delivery (SATOD) rates have declined since the release of previous versions of the care bundle, albeit at a slower rate than required to meet the government’s 2022 national ambition of 6% (and ultimately a smokefree generation by 2030). Although there is significant variation, the national SATOD rate was 9.1% in 2021/22, demonstrating that further work to reduce smoking during pregnancy is required.\n\nThis element is evidence-based and provides a practical approach incorporating the NHS Long Term Plan pathway for a smokefree pregnancy and core elements of NICE guidance. It builds on the previous version of the care bundle’s focus on CO testing to support identification of smokers, with referral to in-house tobacco dependence treatment services and ensuring that effective treatment is available to all pregnant women who smoke. Research indicates that pregnant women expect to be asked about smoking by their maternity care provider and if the issue is not raised it can be incorrectly interpreted that smoking is not a problem for the pregnancy. Learning from front line services demonstrates a need for a treatment offer that is part of the maternity pathway and the woman’s maternity journey. This should include processes for referral, treatment, and feedback that are timely and optimise engagement, with dedicated leadership within the maternity service that has oversight of the full pathway. To support this, consistent messages should be given from all clinicians who the woman comes into contact with during pregnancy.\n\nThis element impacts positively on the other care bundle elements. Reducing smoking in pregnancy will reduce instances of fetal growth restriction, intrapartum complications and preterm birth. This demonstrates the complementary and cumulative nature of the care bundle approach.\n\nThis element also reflects the wider prevention agenda, impacting positively on the health of babies and the long-term outcomes for families and society.\n\nImplementation guidance\n\nKey factors for effective implementation include:\n\nIn-house pathways:\n\nClinical leadership, delivery and oversight of the service and its outcomes remains with maternity. Services are considered as in-house when the woman’s care for treating their tobacco dependence remains within the maternity service i.e., is not referred out to another provider like a local authority stop smoking service[b].\n\nOpt-out referral pathways:\n\nEffective pathways are in place to ensure that as soon as a smoker is identified there is rapid referral to the tobacco dependence adviser on an opt-out basis. Immediate referral and consultation with the tobacco dependence adviser is the ideal, but as a minimum the woman should be contacted within 1 working day and seen (ideally face-to-face) by a TDA within 5 working days.\n\nNicotine replacement therapy:\n\nPathways should ensure provision of long and short acting nicotine replacement therapy at the earliest opportunity to facilitate quitting at an optimal time to improve perinatal outcomes and maximise engagement with referral and treatment services. Ideally this should be at the earliest opportunity when maternity care has commenced, even if prior to a formal booking appointment.\n\nRecent quitters:\n\nThe definition of a smoker includes those who have smoked within the past 2 weeks. However, it is good clinical practice to offer support to all women who have quit smoking since conception given that changes in first trimester pregnancy symptoms may affect smoking habits.\n\nCO testing:\n\nAll pregnant women should be offered CO testing at the antenatal booking and 36-week antenatal appointment, with testing offered at all other antenatal appointments after booking to groups identified within NICE guidance NG209. All staff providing antenatal care should have access to a CO monitor and training in how to use it and interpretation of results. Appropriate procurement processes should be in place for obtaining CO monitors and associated consumables (for example, tubes and batteries).\n\nCO verified non-smokers at 4 weeks:\n\nThis corresponds to the 4-week quit that is regularly captured by stop smoking services and is a comparable indicator that can be used to assess the quality of the intervention.\n\nCO Levels:\n\nThe most common reason for a raised CO level is smoking, however exposure may come from other sources such as second-hand smoke, faulty boilers, faulty heating/cooking appliances or car exhausts (and can happen at home or at the workplace). If women have raised CO levels and are non-smokers environmental exposure from a source in the home should be considered and the women should be advised to contact the Gas Emergency Line on 0800 111 999 for further advice. Referral for further medical advice should be sought if symptoms are consistent with CO poisoning. For NICE guidance on air pollution and vulnerable groups see recommendation 1.7.7. in NICE guidance NG70.\n\nTobacco dependence treatment:\n\nFollowing an initial appointment where a quit is initiated, weekly face-to-face appointments with the tobacco dependence adviser should take place for at least four weeks after the quit date is set followed by regular appointments (as required, but as a minimum monthly) throughout the pregnancy. Treatment includes behavioural support and a combination of long and short acting NRT. A recommended delivery model pathway is available on the Prevention Programme’s NHS Futures webpages.\n\nRecording data:\n\nThere should be routine recording of the CO test result and smoking status for each pregnant woman on maternity information systems (MIS), reporting through to the tobacco dependence patient level collection and, where appropriate, the Maternity Service Data Set (MSDS).\n\nReview and act upon local data:\n\nUse tools available (for example, the Maternity Services Dashboard’s Clinical Quality Improvement Metrics) to review the current situation with smoking and data quality, compare with other nearby or demographically similar Trusts and identify if your Trust is an outlier and/or where improvements can be made.\n\nVaping:\n\nThe Royal College of Midwives position statement states that “If a pregnant woman who has been smoking chooses to use an e-cigarette (vaping) and it helps her to quit smoking and stay smokefree, she should be supported to do so”. There is also more information available via the Smoking in Pregnancy Challenge Group.\n\nSystemwide action:\n\nAction to help pregnant women stop smoking should be supplemented by wider activity across the local system to reduce smoking rates among women, partners and other household or family members. This includes reducing smoking rates in women pre-conception, in addition to working with neonatal care and health visiting services to ensure there are links with local stop smoking services to support quitting postnatally. Local tobacco control networks alongside LMNSs, ICSs and regional teams should be able to support with integrating activity to reduce smoking prevalence in all population groups which can impact on reducing maternal smoking.\n\nImplementation resources\n\nResources:\n\nThe NHS Long Term Plan delivery model for smokefree pregnancy provides details of the pathway and treatment programme that should be delivered in this element. This can be found on the NHS Futures webpages with additional resources and shared materials.\n\nInformation and links to further resources are also available from the Maternal and Neonatal Health Safety Collaborative. Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) produce annual briefings for Integrated Care Systems showing the impact of smoking, using data at ICS level. The briefings include national data on maternal smoking and other clinical areas broken down to ICS level, and signpost to current resources and information.\n\nThe Smoking in Pregnancy Challenge Group produces a range of resources and information for health professionals working to reduce maternal smoking. Those with an interest can also join the Smokefree Pregnancy Information Network administered by ASH, which will provide up to date information throughout the year. For more information contact admin@smokefreeaction.org.uk.\n\nTraining – tobacco dependence adviser:\n\nThose providing tobacco dependence treatment interventions are specialist advisers and should have successfully completed NCSCT stop smoking practitioner training (or local training to the to the required NCSCT Standard) and a speciality course for smoking in pregnancy (requires registration and log-in) including opportunities to observe good practice; to ensure they have the knowledge and skills to deliver the treatment. Tobacco dependence advisers should receive annual refresher training. NCSCT derived competency frameworks are also available on NHS Futures.\n\nTraining – all maternity health professionals:\n\nAll multidisciplinary staff providing maternity care for pregnant women should receive training on how to use a CO monitor (see CO testing section), the delivery of Very Brief Advice (VBA) about smoking, making an opt-out referral and the processes within their maternity pathway (e.g., referral, feedback, data collection). Annual refresher training should align with the Core Competency Framework. Very brief advice on smoking in pregnancy training can be accessed via NCSCT e-learning or HEE eLearning for Health Hub.\n\nElement 2: Fetal growth – risk assessment, surveillance, and management\n\nElement 2\n\nRisk assessment and management of babies at risk of or with fetal growth restriction (FGR).\n\nInterventions\n\nReduce the risk FGR where possible.\n\n2.1 Assess all women at booking to determine if prescription of Aspirin is needed using an appropriate algorithm agreed with the local ICSs.\n\n2.2 Recommend Vitamin D supplementation to all pregnant women using an appropriate algorithm agreed with the local ICS.\n\n2.3 Assess smoking status and manage findings as per Element 1.\n\nMonitor and review the risk of FGR throughout pregnancy.\n\n2.4 Perform a risk assessment for FGR by 14 weeks gestation using an agreed pathway (for example, Appendix D). In multiparous women risk assessment should include the calculation of previous birthweight centiles. The pathway and centile calculator used should be agreed by both the local ICSs and the regional maternity team.\n\n2.5 During risk assessment trusts are encouraged to use information technology platforms to facilitate accurate recording and correct classification of risk by staff. No single provider is recommended, but technology platforms should not prevent compliance with Element 2 guidance and should follow national recommendations on the use of fundal height and fetal growth charts.\n\n2.6 As part of the risk assessment for FGR, blood pressure should be recorded using a digital monitor that has been validated for use in pregnancy.\n\n2.7 Women who are designated as high risk for FGR (for example see Appendix D) should undergo uterine artery Doppler assessment between 18+0 to 23+6 weeks gestation.\n\n2.8 The risk of FGR should be reviewed throughout pregnancy and maternity providers should ensure that processes are in place to enable the movement of women between risk pathways dependent on current risk.\n\n2.9 When an ultrasound-based assessment of fetal growth is performed Trusts should ensure that robust processes are in place to review which risk pathway a woman is on and agree a plan of ongoing care.\n\n2.10 Women who are at low risk of FGR following risk assessment should have surveillance using antenatal fundal height (FH) measurement before 28+6 weeks gestation. Measurements should be plotted or recorded on charts by clinicians trained in their use.\n\n2.11 Staff who perform FH measurement should be competent in measuring, plotting (or recording), interpreting appropriately and referring when indicated. Only staff who perform FH measurement need to undergo training in FH measurement.\n\n2.12 Women who are undergoing planned serial scan surveillance should cease FH measurement after serial surveillance begins. FH measurement should also cease if women are moved onto a scan surveillance pathway in later pregnancy for a developing pregnancy risk (e.g., recurrent reduced fetal movements).\n\n2.13 Women who are at increased risk of FGR should have ultrasound surveillance of fetal growth at 3-4 weekly intervals until delivery (see RCOG guidance and Appendix D)\n\nProvide the correct surveillance when FGR is suspected and delivery at the right time.\n\n2.14 When FGR is suspected an assessment of fetal wellbeing should be made including a discussion regarding fetal movements (see Element 3) and if required computerised CTG (cCTG). A maternal assessment should be performed at each contact this should include blood pressure measurement using a digital monitor that has been validated for use in pregnancy and a urine dipstick assessment for proteinuria. In the presence of hypertension NICE guidance on the use of PlGF/sflt1 testing should be followed.\n\n2.15 Umbilical artery Doppler is the primary surveillance tool for FGR identified prior to 34+0 weeks and should be performed as a minimum every 2 weeks. Maternity care providers caring for women with early FGR identified prior to 34+0 weeks should have an agreed pathway for management which includes fetal medicine network input (for example, through referral or case discussion by phone). Further information is provided in Appendix D.\n\n2.16 When FGR is suspected, the frequency of review of estimated fetal weight (EFW) should follow the guidance in Appendix D or an alternative which has been agreed with local ICSs following advice from the provider’s Clinical Network and/or regional team.\n\n2.17 Risk assessment and management of growth disorders in multiple pregnancy should comply with NICE guidance or a variant that has been agreed with local ICSs following advice from the provider’s Clinical Network\n\n2.18 All management decisions regarding the timing of FGR infants and the relative risks and benefits of iatrogenic delivery should be discussed and agreed with the mother. When the estimated fetal weight (EFW) is <3rd centile and there are no other risk factors (see 2.20), initiation of labour and/or delivery should occur at 37+0 weeks and no later than 37+6 weeks gestation.\n\n2.19 In fetuses with an EFW between the 3rd and <10th centile, delivery should be considered at 39+0 weeks. Birth should be achieved by 39+6 weeks. Other risk factors should be present for birth to be recommended prior to 39 weeks (see 2.20)\n\n2.20 Fetuses who demonstrate declining growth velocity from 32 weeks’ gestation are at increased risk of stillbirth from late onset FGR. Declining growth velocity can occur in fetuses with an EFW >10th centile. Evidence to guide practise is limited and guidance (see Appendix D) is currently based on consensus opinion. In fetuses with declining growth velocity and EFW >10th centile the risk of stillbirth from late onset FGR should be balanced against the risk of late preterm delivery. In infants where declining growth velocity meets criteria (see Appendix D) delivery should be planned from 37+0 weeks unless other risk factors are present. Risk factors that should trigger review of timing of birth are: reduced fetal movements, any umbilical artery or middle cerebral artery Doppler abnormality, cCTG that does not meet criteria, maternal hypertensive disease, abnormal sFlt1: PlGF ratio/free PlGF or reduced liquor volume. Opinion on timing of birth for these infants should be made in consultation with specialist fetal growth services or fetal medicine services depending on Trust availability.\n\nContinuous learning\n\nLearning from excellence and error, or incidents\n\n2.21 Trusts should determine and act upon all themes related to FGR that are identified from investigation of incidents, perinatal reviews, and examples of excellence.\n\n2.22 Trusts should provide data to their Boards and share this with their ICS in relation to the following:\n\na) Percentage of babies born <3rd birthweight centile >37+6 weeks’ gestation.\n\nb) Ongoing case-note audit of <3rd birthweight centile babies not detected antenatally and born after 38+0 weeks, to identify areas for future improvement (at least 20 cases per year, or all cases if less than 20 occur).\n\nc) Percentage of babies born >39+6 and <10th birthweight centile to provide an indication of detection rates and management of SGA babies.\n\nd) Percentage of babies >3rd birthweight centile born <39+0 weeks gestation\n\n2.23 Use the PMRT to calculate the percentage of perinatal mortality cases annually where the identification and management of FGR was a relevant issue. Trusts should review their annual MBRRACE perinatal mortality report and report to their ICS on actions taken to address any deficiencies identified.\n\n2.24 Individual Trusts should examine their outcomes in relation to similar Trusts to understand variation and inform potential improvements.\n\n2.25 Individual Trusts should provide data on the distribution of FGR outcomes with relation to maternal reported ethnicity.\n\n2.26 Maternity providers are encouraged to focus improvement in the following areas:\n\na) Appropriate risk assessment for FGR and other conditions associated with placental dysfunction and robust referral processes to appropriate care pathways following this.\n\nb) Appropriate prescribing of aspirin in line with this risk assessment in women at risk of placental dysfunction.\n\nc) Review of ultrasound measurement quality control. Trusts are encouraged to comply with BMUS guidance on audit and continuous learning with relation third trimester assessment of fetal wellbeing\n\nd) Trusts will share evidence of these improvements with their Trust Board and ICS and demonstrate continuous improvement in relation to process and outcome measures.\n\nProcess indicators\n\n2a. Percentage of pregnancies where a risk status for FGR is identified and recorded at booking. (This should be recorded on the provider’s MIS and included in the MSDS submission to NHS Digital once the primary data standard is in place.)\n\n2b. Percentage of pregnancies where an SGA fetus is antenatally detected, and this is recorded on the provider’s MIS and included in their MSDS submission to NHS Digital.\n\n2c. Percentage of perinatal mortality cases annually where the identification and management of FGR was a relevant issue (using the PMRT).\n\nOutcome indicators\n\n2d. Percentage of babies <3rd birthweight centile born >37+6 weeks (this is a measure of the effective detection and management of FGR).\n\n2e. Percentage of live births and stillbirths >3rd birthweight centile born <39+0 weeks gestation, where growth restriction was suspected.\n\nRationale\n\nThere is strong evidence linking undiagnosed FGR to stillbirth 7 8 . Therefore, antenatal detection of growth restricted babies is vital and has been shown to reduce stillbirth risk significantly because it gives the option to consider timely delivery of the baby.\n\nThe previous versions of this element have made a measurable difference to antenatal detection of FGR across England. The last version resulted in the widespread uptake of uterine artery Doppler screening for the first time outside of tertiary centres in England and a significant improvement in the quality of care provided to pregnant women in all types of maternity setting. By introducing more nuanced risk assessment we have sought to reduce intervention whilst maintaining the focus on delivering babies at risk. In this version we seek to clarify this further so that all members of staff caring for women have clear, practical guidance. Our new title “Fetal growth: risk assessment, surveillance, and management.” reflects this.\n\nImportant changes in this update\n\nFollowing a review by the Chief Scientific Office team only digital measurement of blood pressure is now recommended for risk assessment and monitoring of FGR.\n\nThe previous definition of suboptimal fetal growth of <20g/day in the late third trimester has been too didactically interpreted and has therefore been removed. A prospectively tested method of identifying suboptimal fetal growth in babies >10th centile remains elusive so suggestion for replacement is contained within Appendix D.\n\nNational guidance from RCOG on FH and EFW charts remains awaited so Trusts may continue to use a range of charts. However, charts that are appropriate for plotting EFW and birthweight are recommended for reporting to reduce discrepancies.\n\nThe risks and benefits of early term delivery\n\nIt is well recognised that preterm birth is associated with both short and long-term sequelae for the infant. The distinction between preterm and term birth is based on the 37+0-week threshold. However, like any threshold on a continuous scale, the separation into two groups is arbitrary. Some of the risks associated with preterm birth are still apparent at ‘early term’ gestation, defined as 37 and 38 weeks. The association with short term morbidity can be captured by analysing the risk of admission of the infant to the neonatal unit. One of the best UK analyses was published by Stock et al9 where they compared the risk of neonatal unit admission associated with induction of labour at the given week with the comparison group of all women delivered at a later week of gestation.\n\nFigure 3: Neonatal unit admission\n\nNeonatal unit admission according to week of gestational age, comparing induction of labour versus expectant management9.\n\nHowever, delivery of the baby early prevents the subsequent risk of antepartum stillbirth. As antepartum stillbirth is the major single cause of perinatal death at term, earlier delivery will prevent perinatal death. The same paper also reported data on the risk of extended perinatal mortality associated with earlier induction.\n\nFigure 4: Extended perinatal mortality\n\nExtended perinatal mortality according to week of gestational age, comparing induction of labour versus expectant management9.\n\nThe dilemma is that early term delivery reduces the risk of a very rare but serious adverse event (stillbirth or neonatal death) while increasing the risk of much more common but less severe adverse events. Decision-making balances the risks of causing mild harm to relatively large numbers of infants in order to prevent serious harm to a relatively small number. For example, using the data above, at 37 weeks, 10 inductions will lead to one additional baby being admitted for neonatal care, but it will require more than 700 inductions to prevent each perinatal death. Hence, current care is aimed at targeting early term induction to those who are at increased risk of perinatal death.\n\nImplementation\n\nElement 2 recognises that there remains a range of expert opinions on some interventions and allows some flexibility in the choice of pathways. The pathways in Appendix D have been widely implemented but are not mandated. If an alternative pathway is chosen it should be agreed with local ICSs following advice from the provider’s Clinical Network and/or regional team as to whether the pathway is acceptable to prevent idiosyncratic care.\n\nTo implement this element effectively trusts should:\n\nensure that all pregnant women are assessed for their risk of placental dysfunction with the associated potential for FGR in early pregnancy.\n\nensure that a robust training programme and competency assessment is included in any processes designed to detect an FGR fetus, for example measurement of FH, use and interpretation of charts, ultrasound scanning for growth and uterine artery Doppler measurement to detect early onset FGR.\n\nagree a plan so that all blood pressure monitors in use with pregnant women are compliant with Guidance from the Chief Scientific Officer. Plans and timescales must be in view of local resources, with priority given to the replacement of analogue/aneroid blood pressure monitors. In the meantime, the use of non-compliant devices should be raised in the service risk register.\n\nagree which charts will be used antenatally to measure fetal growth and ensure that these charts are based on EFW reference ranges.\n\nElectronic ultrasound database and MIS suppliers should provide EFW centile charts and birthweight centile charts with reference curves for the 3rd and 10th centiles. Providers using paper EFW centile charts and birthweight centile charts should ensure that the charts have reference curves for the 3rd and 10th centiles. Actual birthweight of the baby should be assessed using the same methodology used antenatally i.e., based on EFW reference, not a birthweight reference scale to ensure consistency.\n\nAlthough overdue for revision the RCOG SGA guideline advises that fetal biometry surveillance scans need not be performed more frequently than every three weeks unless potential abnormalities in fetal growth are identified, in which case scans may need to be performed more frequently (see intervention 2.7) and it is not anticipated that this will change in planned updates. Ultrasound surveillance of biometry in at risk fetuses should continue until delivery.\n\nProviders with capacity may wish to use assessment of Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) Doppler pulsatility indices (PI) in addition to umbilical artery Doppler to help identify and act upon potential fetal compromise in later pregnancy (after 34+0 weeks), but evidence to guide practise is due in the next 12-24 months and Trusts may wish to consider waiting for this before implementation.\n\nVersion two of the MSDS enables the recording of antenatally detected SGA using local criteria and the recording of fetal biometry, EFW and birthweight. Providers who submit these data via MSDS will be able to compare their performance with peer organisations using metrics developed by NHS Digital and available as part of the Maternity Data Viewer’s Data Access Environment, which is being developed during 2019.\n\nTrusts submitting data to the MSDS will be able to view the percentage of <10th centile and <3rd centile births in each gestational week of the third trimester in their unit annually. These data will allow Trusts to compare outcomes with similar units and to monitor the performance of their SGA and FGR detection programmes over time.\n\nElement 3: Raising awareness of reduced fetal movement\n\nElement 3\n\nRaising awareness amongst pregnant women of the importance of reporting reduced fetal movements (RFM), and ensuring providers have protocols in place, based on best available evidence, to manage care for women who report RFM.\n\nInterventions\n\n3.1 Information from practitioners, accompanied by an advice leaflet (for example, RCOG or Tommy’s leaflet available in multiple languages) on RFM, based on current evidence, best practice and clinical guidelines, to be available to all pregnant women by 28+0 weeks of pregnancy and FM discussed at every subsequent contact.\n\n3.2 Use provided checklist (on page 33) to manage care of pregnant women who report RFM, in line with national evidence-based guidance (for example, RCOG Green-Top Guideline 57).\n\nContinuous learning\n\n3.3 Maternity care providers should examine their outcomes in relation to the interventions and trends and themes within their own incidents where the presentation and/or management of RFM is felt to have been a contributory factor.\n\n3.4 Maternity care providers should ensure whether inequalities (particularly relating to ethnicity and deprivation) are being adequately addressed when there are incidents relating to presentation with or management of RFM.\n\n3.5 Individual trusts should examine their outcomes in relation to similar Trusts to understand variation and inform potential improvements.\n\n3.6 Maternity providers are encouraged to focus improvement in the following areas:\n\na) Signposting to information regarding RFM to pregnant women by 28+0 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nb) Appropriate care according to local guidance in relation to risk stratification and ongoing care for women presenting with RFM.\n\nc) Ensuring appropriate use of induction of labour when RFM is the only indication (for example, induction of labour for RFM alone is not recommended prior to 39+0 weeks).\n\nProcess indicators\n\n3a. Percentage of women who attend with RFM who have a computerised CTG.\n\n3b. Proportion of women who attend with recurrent RFM* who had an ultrasound scan to assess fetal growth.\n\nOutcome indicators\n\n3c. Percentage of stillbirths which had issues associated with RFM management identified using PMRT\n\n3d. Rate of induction of labour when RFM is the only indication before 39+0 weeks’ gestation.\n\nRationale\n\nEnquiries into stillbirth have consistently described a relationship between episodes of RFM and stillbirth, ranging from the 8th CESDI report published in 200111 to the MBRRACE-UK reports into antepartum and intrapartum stillbirths respectively11 12 . In all these case reviews unrecognised or poorly managed episodes of RFM have been highlighted as contributory factors to avoidable stillbirths. In addition, a growing number of studies, including an individual patient data meta-analysis have confirmed a correlation between episodes of RFM and stillbirth 13 14. This relationship increases in strength when women have multiple episodes of RFM in late pregnancy (after 28 weeks’ gestation)14. There is no accepted definition of what recurrent RFM means; one region of the UK has successfully adopted a consensus definition of two or more episodes of RFM occurring within a 21-day period after 26 weeks’ gestation*. The relationship between RFM and stillbirth appears to be mediated by placental insufficiency 15,16,17.\n\nThis element and its interventions are aligned with the RCOG Green-Top Guideline 57 which is the best evidence summary and set of recommendations to date. A revision of the Green-Top Guideline will be completed in 2023.\n\nImplementation\n\nA systematic review found that interventions for encouraging awareness of fetal movement were associated with a reduction in perinatal death, neonatal intensive care unit admissions and Apgar scores of <7 at 5 minutes of age and were not associated with increases in caesarean births or induction of labour. The effect of encouraging fetal movement awareness or clinical management of RFM on stillbirth is uncertain.\n\nIt is possible that altering ‘clinical management after RFM’ will cause an increase in ultrasound scans and obstetric intervention, such as induction of labour and Caesarean birth. The AFFIRM study found that a care package which recommended all women have an ultrasound assessment of fetal biometry, liquor volume and umbilical artery Doppler following presentation with RFM after 26 weeks’ gestation and offered induction of labour for recurrent episodes of RFM after 37 weeks’ gestation did not significantly reduce stillbirths but was associated with an increase in induction of labour and Caesarean births. However, this care pathway reduced the number of SGA babies born at or after 40 weeks’ gestation.18 Other studies found raised awareness of fetal movements, with no mandated management package, did not increase Caesarean births.19 20\n\nThere are no trials of computerised CTG (cCTG) following presentation with RFM. However, cCTG is recommended as this provides an objective assessment of fetal wellbeing and may be completed more quickly than conventional CTG. If a cCTG has been performed and is normal and there are no other indications for an ultrasound scan, then a scan is not required for a first presentation of RFM but should be offered for women reporting recurrent RFM*. As stated previuolsey in this document, computerised CTGs are recommended over and above visualised CTG due to the potential to reduce the risks of human error.21 If an appropriate scan has been performed within the previous two weeks and was normal a repeat scan is not required.\n\nPrior to 39 weeks’ gestation, induction of labour or Caesarean birth is associated with small increases in perinatal morbidity and neurodevelopmental delay. Thus, a recommendation for birth needs to be individualised and based upon evidence of fetal compromise (for example, abnormal CTG, EFW <10th centile or oligohydramnios) or other concerns (for example, concomitant maternal medical disease, such as hypertension or diabetes, or associated symptoms such as antepartum haemorrhage).\n\nAt 39 weeks’ gestation and beyond, induction of labour is not associated with an increase in caesarean birth, birth with forceps or ventouse, fetal morbidity or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Therefore, expediting birth by induction of labour (to women for whom this is not contraindicated) could be discussed (risks, benefits and mother’s wishes) with women presenting with a single episode of RFM after 38+6 weeks gestation. The patient decision aid for timing of induction of labour should be used.\n\nIt is important that women presenting with recurrent RFM* are additionally informed of the association with an increased risk of stillbirth and given the option of expediting birth (by the most appropriate route for them) for RFM alone after 39+0 weeks. Decision to offer birth should consider the timing as to whether this can be achieved within the safe capacity of the unit.\n\nSuggested checklist for the management of reduced fetal movements (RFM)\n\n1. Ask\n\nConfirm there is maternal perception of RFM? How long has there been RFM? Is this the first episode? When were movements last felt?\n\n2. Act\n\nAuscultate fetal heart (hand-held Doppler/Pinnard) to confirm fetal viability.\n\nAssess fetal growth by reviewing growth chart, perform SFH if not performed within last 2 weeks (if not on an ultrasound surveillance pathway already).\n\nPerform CTG to assess fetal heart rate in accordance with national guidelines (ideally computerised CTG should be used).\n\nUltrasound scan for fetal growth, liquor volume and umbilical artery Doppler only need to be offered on first presentation of RFM if there is an indication for scan (e.g., the baby is SGA on clinical assessment).\n\nUltrasound scan for fetal growth, liquor volume and umbilical artery Doppler should be offered to women presenting with recurrent RFM after 28+0 weeks’ gestation.\n\nScans are not required if there has been a growth scan in the previous two weeks.\n\nIn cases of RFM after 38+6 weeks discuss induction of labour with all women and offer birth to women with recurrent RFM after 38+6 weeks.\n\n3. Advise\n\nConvey results of investigations to the mother. Mother should be encouraged to re-attend if she has further concerns about RFM.\n\nElement 4: Effective fetal monitoring during labour\n\nElement 4\n\nEffective fetal monitoring during labour.\n\nInterventions\n\n4.1 All staff who care for women in labour are required to undertake annual training and competency assessment on knowledge and skills required for effective fetal monitoring via Intermittent auscultation (IA) [Midwives] and electronic fetal monitoring [Midwives and Obstetricians].\n\n4.2 At the onset of every labour, there is a structured risk assessment undertaken which informs the clinicians recommendation of the most appropriate fetal monitoring method at the start of labour. This risk assessment should be revisited throughout labour as part of a holistic review. 4.3 Regular (at least hourly) systematic review of maternal and fetal wellbeing should be agreed and implemented. This should be accompanied by a clear guideline for escalation if concerns are raised using this structured process. All staff to be trained in the review system and escalation protocol.\n\n4.4 A buddy system should be used to help provide an objective holistic review for example ‘Fresh Eyes’ – this should be undertaken at least hourly when CTG monitoring is used and at least four hourly when IA is utilised, unless there is a trigger to provide a holistic review earlier. 4.5 Identify a dedicated lead midwife (minimum of 0.4 WTE) and lead obstetrician (minimum 0.1WTE) with demonstrated fetal monitoring expertise to focus on and champion best practice in fetal monitoring.\n\nContinuous learning\n\n4.6 Maternity care providers should examine their outcomes in relation to the interventions, trends and themes within their own incidents where fetal monitoring was likely to have been a contributory factor.\n\n4.7 Individual Trusts should examine their outcomes in relation to similar Trusts to understand variation and inform potential improvements.\n\n4.8 Maternity providers are encouraged to focus improvement in the following areas:\n\na) Risk assessment of the woman/fetus at the beginning and regularly during labour.\n\nb) Interpretation and escalation of concerns over fetal wellbeing in labour.\n\nProcess indicators\n\n4a. Percentage of staff who have received training on CTG interpretation and intermittent auscultation, human factors and situational awareness.\n\n4b. Percentage of staff who have successfully completed mandatory annual competency assessment.\n\n4c. Fetal monitoring lead roles appointed\n\nOutcome indicators\n\n4d. The percentage of intrapartum stillbirths, early neonatal deaths and cases of severe brain injury* where failures of intrapartum monitoring are identified as a contributory factor.\n\n*Using the severe brain injury definition as used in Gale et al. 2018.\n\nRationale\n\nAs well as reducing stillbirth rates, there is a need to reduce avoidable fetal morbidity related to brain injury causing conditions such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and cerebral palsy. These conditions have a huge emotional and financial impact upon families. They also have significant economic consequences for the health and social care system through the costs of care needed to support those with an avoidable brain injury throughout their lives and litigation understandably brought by families when something goes wrong during labour.\n\nThe importance of good fetal monitoring during labour, in achieving birth of a healthy baby, is underlined by data from the RCOG’s Each Baby Counts report, showing that fetal monitoring was identified in 74% of babies as a critical contributory factor where improvement in care may have prevented the outcome.\n\nThe report identified problems with fetal monitoring using IA, including inappropriate assignment of women to ‘low risk’, delays in responding to abnormalities and switching to CTG monitoring when appropriate. There was also a failure to follow national guidelines about technique and frequency of IA and a failure to recognise transition between the stages of labour.\n\nIn the case of a high-risk labour where continuous monitoring is needed, CTG is the best clinical tool available to carry this out as it is a well-established method of confirming fetal wellbeing and identification of potential fetal hypoxia. However, CTG interpretation is a high-level skill and is susceptible to variation in judgement between clinicians and by the same clinician over time22 . These variations can lead to inappropriate care planning and subsequently impact on perinatal outcomes23.\n\nThe RCOG’s Each Baby Counts report failure to initiate CTG when indicated, failure to record a good-quality CTG, inadequate CTG interpretation and failure to communicate the findings to senior staff in a timely manner. The conclusions resulting from these findings included recommendations for:\n\na regular/rolling programme of training in the use of electronic fetal monitoring.\n\nsimple guidelines on the interpretation of electronic fetal monitoring\n\nclear lines of communication when an abnormal CTG is suspected.\n\nguidelines on appropriate management in situations where the CTG is abnormal.\n\nMany of the findings and recommendations from the Each Baby Counts report are echoed in the 2017 MBRRACE-UK Perinatal Confidential Enquiry that focused on term, singleton, intrapartum stillbirth and intrapartum-related neonatal death. Recommendations that have now been incorporated into this element of the care bundle include the use of a risk assessment tool on admission and then throughout labour to guide the nature, frequency and interpretation of fetal monitoring, as well as determining the optimal form of training and competency assessment.\n\nIn addition, both reports identify that CTG or IA monitoring cannot be used in isolation and are only part of a complex assessment of fetal wellbeing – “Failure to recognise an evolving problem, or the transition from normal to abnormal, was a common theme. It was rarely due to a single issue, more commonly appearing to arise from a more complex failure of situational awareness and ability to maintain an objective overview of a changing situation” (MBRRACE-UK Perinatal Confidential Enquiry). There is, therefore, a real need for all staff to undertake multidisciplinary training that includes situational awareness, human factors, and communication. The importance of ensuring situational awareness is present in teams performing complex tasks is also highlighted in the Each Baby Counts report from 2015.\n\nImplementation\n\nTrusts should be able to demonstrate that all qualified staff who care for women in labour are competent to interpret IA [Midwives] and CTG [Midwives and Obstetricians] in relation to the clinical situation, use the Buddy system and escalate accordingly when concerns arise, or risks develop. This includes staff that are brought in to support a busy service from other clinical areas such as the postnatal ward and the community, as well as locum, agency or bank staff (medical or midwifery)\n\nIntervention 4.1:\n\nOwing to a lack of validated packages it is not possible to be prescriptive about the exact nature of either training packages or competency assessment. Principles for training packages are included in Appendix E.\n\nHowever, it is recommended that all trusts mandate annual human factor training for all staff working in a maternity setting; this should include the principles of psychological safety and upholding civility in the workplace, and ensuring staff are enabled to escalate clinical concerns. The content of human factor training must be agreed within the LMNS, Ockenden, 2022\n\nIntervention 4.2:\n\nThe MBRRACE-UK Perinatal Confidential Enquiry report recommended the national development of a standardised risk assessment tool. As this is not yet available the procedure should comply with fetal monitoring guidelines.\n\nIntervention 4.3:\n\nThe principle underlying this intervention is that fetal wellbeing is assessed regularly (at least hourly) during labour and documented using a structured proforma. This review should be more than recording the fetal heart rate via IA or categorisation of the CTG (Appendix E).\n\nIntervention 4.4:\n\nA discussion between the midwife caring for the woman and another midwife or doctor should occur at least 4 hourly when undertaking IA and at least hourly when using CTG monitoring. The discussion should include the FHR (IA or CTG), review of antenatal risk factors such as concurrent reduced fetal movements, fetal growth restriction, previous caesarean section; and intrapartum risk factors such as meconium, suspected infection, vaginal bleeding or prolonged labour and should lead to escalation if indicated (Appendix E).\n\nIntroduce a Buddy system to pair up more and less experienced midwives during shifts to provide accessible senior advice with protocol for escalation of any concerns.\n\nIntervention 4.5:\n\nSome Trusts may choose to extend the remit of the Practice Development Midwife to fulfil the role of Fetal Monitoring Lead, whereas others may wish to appoint a separate clinician. The critical principle is that the Fetal Monitoring Leads have dedicated time within their remit to support staff working in intrapartum care to provide high quality intrapartum risk assessments and accurate fetal heart rate interpretation using either IA or CTG. The role should contribute to building and sustaining a safety culture in intrapartum care with all staff committed to continuous improvement.\n\nElement 5: Reducing preterm births and optimising perinatal care.\n\nElement 5\n\nReducing the number of preterm births and optimising perinatal care when preterm birth cannot be prevented.\n\nPredict\n\nAssess all women at booking of risk of preterm birth\n\nPreterm birth clinics, cervical length scanning, Fibronectin\n\nPrevent\n\nSmoking cessation, low dose aspirin, continuity of care\n\nCervical cerclage, progesterone, Arabin pessary\n\nPreterm birth clinics, consider aspirin, smoking status, Cervical length scanning\n\nPerinatal optimisation\n\nPlace of birth\n\nAntenatal steroids\n\nIntrapartum antibiotics\n\nCord management\n\nNormothermia\n\nEarly maternal breast milk\n\nVolume targeted ventilation\n\nCaffeine\n\nPreterm birth lead team\n\nObstetrician\n\nMidwife\n\nNeonatologist\n\nNeonatal nurse\n\nInterventions\n\nPreterm Birth Lead Team\n\n5.1 Each provider trust should have.\n\na) An Obstetric Consultant lead for preterm birth, delivering care through a specific preterm birth clinic, or within an existing fetal medicine service.\n\nb) An identified local preterm birth/perinatal optimisation Midwife Lead\n\nc) A Neonatal Consultant lead for preterm perinatal optimisation\n\nd) An identified Neonatal Nursing lead for preterm perinatal optimisation\n\n5.2 Each Preterm Birth Lead team should have clear audit and QI pathways for preterm birth prevention, prediction and perinatal optimisation, and should engage in shared learning and QI with local preterm birth clinical networks, LMNSs and neonatal ODNs.\n\nPrediction\n\n5.3 Assessment of all women at booking for their risk of preterm birth and stratification to low, intermediate and high-risk pathways using the criteria in Appendix F.
