        "text": "The energy transition is off-track. The aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ripple effects of the Ukraine crisis have further compounded the challenges facing the transition. The stakes could not be higher - every fraction of a degree in global temperature change can trigger significant and far-reaching consequences for natural systems, human societies and economies.\n\nLimiting global warming to 1.5°C requires cutting carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions by around 37 gigatonnes (Gt) from 2022 levels and achieving net-zero emissions in the energy sector by 2050. Despite some progress, significant gaps remain between the current deployment of energy transition technologies and the levels needed to achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise to within 1.5°C of pre-industrial levels by the end of this century. A 1.5°C compatible pathway requires a wholescale transformation of the way societies consume and produce energy.\n\nCurrent pledges and plans fall well short of IRENA’s 1.5°C pathway and will result in an emissions gap of 16 Gt in 2050. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-LEDS) and net-zero targets, if fully implemented, could reduce CO₂ emissions by 6% by 2030 and 56% by 2050, compared to 2022 levels. However, most climate pledges are yet to be translated into detailed national strategies and plans - implemented through policies and regulations - or supported with sufficient funding. According to IRENA's Planned Energy Scenario, the energy-related emissions gap is projected to reach 34 Gt by 2050, underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive action to accelerate the transition.\n\nAnnual deployment of some 1 000 GW of renewable power is needed to stay on a 1.5°C pathway. In 2022, some 300 GW of renewables were added globally, accounting for 83% of new capacity compared to a 17% share combined for fossil fuel and nuclear additions. Both the volume and share of renewables need to grow substantially, which is both technically feasible and economically viable.\n\nPolicies and investments are not consistently moving in the right direction. While there were record renewable power capacity additions in 2022, the year also saw the highest levels of fossil fuel subsidies ever, as many governments sought to cushion the blow of high energy prices for consumers and businesses. Global investments across all energy transition technologies reached a record high of USD 1.3 trillion in 2022, yet fossil fuel capital investments were almost twice those of renewable energy investments. With renewables and energy efficiency best placed to meet climate commitments - as well as energy security and energy affordability objectives – governments need to redouble their efforts to ensure investments are on the right track.\n\nEvery year, the gap between what is achieved and what is required continues to grow. IRENA’s energy transition indicators (Table S1) show significant acceleration is needed across energy sectors and technologies, from deeper end-use electrification of transport and heat, to direct renewable use, energy efficiency and infrastructure additions. Delays only add to the already considerable challenge of meeting IPCC-defined emission reduction levels in 2030 and 2050 for a 1.5°C trajectory (IPCC, 2022a). This lack of progress will also increase future investment needs and the costs of worsening climate change effects.\n\nThe share of renewable energy in the global energy mix would increase from 16% in 2020 to 77% by 2050 in IRENA’s 1.5°C scenario. Total primary energy supply would remain stable due to increased energy efficiency and growth of renewables. Renewables would increase across all end-use sectors, while a high rate of electrification in sectors such as transport and buildings would require a twelve-fold increase in renewable electricity capacity by 2050, compared to 2020 levels. Globally, annual renewable power capacity additions would need to reach an average of 1 066 GW per year from 2023 to 2050 under the 1.5°C scenario.\n\nElectricity would become the main energy carrier, accounting for over 50% of total final energy consumption by 2050 in the 1.5°C scenario. Renewable energy deployment, improvements in energy efficiency and the electrification of end-use sectors would contribute to this shift. In addition, modern biomass and hydrogen would both play more significant roles, meeting 16% and 14% of total final energy consumption by 2050, respectively.\n\nBy 2050, 94% of hydrogen would be renewables-based in the 1.5°C scenario. Hydrogen would play a key role in the decarbonisation of end-uses and flexibility of the power system. The 1.5°C Scenario envisages that total final energy consumption would decrease by 6% between 2020 and 2050, due to efficiency improvements, deployment of renewables, and changes in behaviour and consumption patterns.\n\nAn enduring investment gap\n\nA cumulative USD 150 trillion is required to realise the 1.5°C target by 2050, averaging over USD 5 trillion in annual terms. Although global investment across all energy transition technologies reached a record high of USD 1.3 trillion in 2022, annual investment must more than quadruple to remain on the 1.5°C pathway. Compared with the Planned Energy Scenario - under which a cumulative investment of USD 103 trillion is required – an additional USD 47 trillion in cumulative investment is required by 2050 to remain on the 1.5°C pathway. Around USD 1 trillion of annual investments in fossil fuel-based technologies currently envisaged in the Planned Energy Scenario must therefore be redirected towards energy transition technologies and infrastructure.\n\nRenewable energy investment remains concentrated in a limited number of countries and focused on only a few technologies. Investment in renewable energy (including both power and end-uses) reached USD 0.5 trillion in 2022 (IRENA and CPI, 2023); however, this is around one-third of the average investment needed each year in renewables under the 1.5°C Scenario. Furthermore, 85% of global renewable energy investment benefitted less than 50% of the world’s population and Africa accounted for only 1% of additional capacity in 2022 (IRENA, 2023a; IRENA and CPI, 2023). Investments in off-grid renewable energy solutions in 2021 amounted to USD 0.5 billion (IRENA and CPI, 2023) – far below the USD 15 billion needed annually to 2030. While many technology choices exist, most investments were in solar PV and wind power, with 95% channelled toward these technologies (IRENA and CPI, 2023). Greater volumes of funding need to flow to other energy transition technologies such as biofuels, hydropower and geothermal energy, as well as to sectors beyond power that have lower shares of renewables in total final energy consumption (e.g. heating and transport).\n\nSome 75% of global investment in renewables from 2013 to 2020 came from the private sector. However, private capital tends to flow to the technologies and countries with the least associated risks, be they real or perceived. In 2020, 83% of commitments in solar PV came from private finance, whereas geothermal and hydropower relied primarily on public finance - only 32% and 3% of investments in these technologies, respectively, came from private investors in 2020 (IRENA and CPI, 2023). Stronger public sector intervention is required to channel investments towards countries and technologies in a more equitable way.\n\nPublic finance and policy should crowd in private capital, but greater geographical and technological diversity of investment requires targeted and scaled-up public contributions. For many years, policy has focused on mobilising private capital. Public funding is urgently needed to invest in basic energy infrastructure in the developing world, as well as to drive deployment in less mature technologies (especially in end uses such as heating and transport, or synthetic fuel production) and in areas where private investors seldom venture. Otherwise, the gap in investment between the Global North and the Global South could continue to widen.\n\nOvercoming barriers to the transition\n\nPolicy makers need to strike the right balance between reactive measures and proactive energy transition strategies that promote a more resilient, inclusive and climate-safe system. Several of the root causes of current crises stem from the fossil fuel-based energy system, such as overdependence on a limited number of fuel exporters, inefficient and wasteful energy production and consumption, and the lack of accounting for negative environmental and social impacts. An energy transition based on renewables can reduce or eliminate many of these. It is therefore the speed of the change that will determine the levels of energy security and economic and social resilience at the national level and offer new opportunities for improved human welfare globally.\n\nAccelerating progress worldwide requires a shift away from structures and systems built for the fossil fuel era. The energy transition can be a tool with which to proactively shape a more equal and inclusive world. This means overcoming existing barriers across infrastructure, policy, workforces and institutions that hamper progress and impede inclusivity (Figure S2).\n\nMore can be done in the short term. While the energy transition undoubtedly requires time, there is significant potential to implement many of the available technology options today. Upward trends in the deployment of these solutions demonstrate that the technical and economic case is sound. However, comprehensive policies are needed across all sectors to ramp up deployment, as well as to instigate the systemic and structural overhaul required to realise climate and development objectives.\n\nA profound and systemic transformation of the global energy system must occur within 30 years\n\nThe Global Stocktake at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) must serve as a catalyst for scaling up action in the years to 2030 to implement existing energy transition options. Whilst planning must provide room for innovation and additional policy action, a significant scale up of existing solutions is paramount. For example, advancing efficiency and electrification based on renewables is a cost-effective avenue for the power sector, as well as for transport and buildings. Clean hydrogen and its derivatives, and sustainable biomass solutions, also offer various solutions for end uses.\n\nThe period following COP28 will be pivotal for efforts to curb climate change and achieve the sustainable development goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda. The energy transition is crucial for delivering on economic, social and environmental priorities. It is imperative for governments, financial institutions and the private sector to urgently re-evaluate their aspirations, strategies and implementation plans to realign the energy transition with its intended trajectory.\n\nDeveloping structures for a renewables-based energy system\n\nA profound and systemic transformation of the global energy system must be achieved within 30 years. This condensed timeframe necessitates a strategic shift that expands beyond the focus on decarbonisation of energy supply and energy consumption, toward designing an energy system that not only reduces carbon emissions but also supports a resilient and inclusive global economy. As a result, planning needs to extend beyond borders and the narrow confines of fuels to focus on the requirements of the new energy system and the economies it will sustain.\n\nFocusing on the enablers of a renewables-dominated system can help address the structural barriers that hinder progress in the energy transition. Pursuing fuel and sectoral mitigation measures is necessary, but is insufficient to transition to an energy system fit for the dominance of renewables. From energy production and transportation to processing coal, oil and gas, the global infrastructure dedicated to energy will need to change. This will have impacts on power generation, industrial production and manufacturing, as well as on rail, pipelines, shipyards and other means of supplying fossil fuels. Enhancing the focus on systems design will help accelerate the development of a new energy infrastructure and sustain its implementation.\n\nGovernments can proactively shape a renewables-based energy system, overcome the flaws and inefficiencies of current structures, and more effectively influence outcomes. The simultaneous, proactive shaping of physical, policy and institutional structures will be essential to realising development and climate objectives, and achieving a more resilient and equitable world. These underpinnings should form the pillars of a structure that supports the energy transition:\n\nPhysical infrastructure upgrades, modernisation and expansion will increase resilience and build flexibility for a diversified and interconnected energy system. Transmission and distribution will need to accommodate both the highly localised, decentralised nature of many renewable fuels, as well as different trade routes. Planning for interconnectors to enable electricity trade, and shipping routes for hydrogen and derivatives, must consider vastly different global dynamics and proactively link countries to promote the diversification and resilience of energy systems. Storage solutions will need to be widespread and designed with geo-economic impacts in mind. Public acceptance is also critical for any large-scale undertaking and can be secured through project transparency and opportunities for communities to voice their perspectives.\n\nPolicy and regulatory enablers must systematically prioritise the acceleration of the energy transition and a reduction in the role of fossil fuels. Today, the underlying policy and regulatory systems remain shaped around fossil fuels. While it is inevitable that fossil fuels will remain in the energy mix for some time, their share must dramatically decrease as we approach mid-century. Policy frameworks and markets should therefore focus on accelerating the transition and provide the essential underpinnings for a resilient and inclusive system.\n\nA well-skilled workforce is a lynchpin of a successful energy transition. Work by IRENA and the International Labour Organization (ILO) has shown that the renewable energy sector employed some 12.7 million people worldwide in 2022, growing from about 7.3 million in 2012. Energy transition modelling indicates that tens of millions of additional jobs will likely be created in the coming decades as investments grow and installed capacities expand. A broad range of occupational profiles will be needed. Filling these jobs will require concerted action in education and skills building, and governments have a critical role in coordinating efforts to align the offerings of the education sector with projected industry needs - whether in the form of vocational training or university courses. To attract talent to the sector, it is crucial that jobs are decent, and that women, youth and minorities have equal access to job training, hiring networks and career opportunities.\n\nThe way forward: Prioritising bold and transformative actions\n\nAchieving the necessary course-correction in the energy transition will require bold, transformative measures that reflect the urgency of the present situation. A considerable scale-up of renewables needs to go hand-in-hand with investments in enabling infrastructure. Comprehensive policies are needed not only to facilitate deployment but also to ensure the transition has broad socio-economic benefits.\n\nNet-zero commitments must be embedded in legislation and translated into implementation plans that are adequately resourced. Without this crucial step, climate announcements remain aspirational, and the necessary progress out of reach. The current energy system is deeply woven into socio-economic structures that have evolved over centuries. This means significant structural change must occur in a condensed timeframe of less than three decades to successfully deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nEvery investment and planning decision concerning energy infrastructure today should consider the structure and geography of the low-carbon economy of the future. Energy infrastructure is long-lived, so investment in fixed infrastructure should consider the long term. Electrification of end uses will reshape demand. Renewable power will require existing infrastructure to be modernised, with grid reinforcement and expansion on both land and sea. Green hydrogen production will also occur in locations other than today’s oil and gas fields. The technical challenges and economic costs of redesigning infrastructure should be accounted for, and the environmental and social aspects adequately addressed from the outset.\n\nA just and inclusive energy transition will help to overcome deep disparities that affect the quality of life of hundreds of millions of people. Energy transition policies must be aligned with broader systemic changes that aim to safeguard human well-being, advance equity among countries and communities, and bring the global economy in line with climate, broader environmental and resource constraints.\n\nSupporting developing countries to accelerate the energy transition could improve energy security while preventing the global decarbonisation divide from widening. A diverse energy market would reduce supply chain risks, improve energy security and ensure local value creation for commodity producers. Access to technology, training, capacity building and affordable finance will be vital to unlock the full potential of countries’ contributions to the global energy transition, especially for those rich in renewables and related resources.\n\nHuman welfare and security must remain at the heart of the energy transition. Systemic changes beyond the energy sector will be needed to overcome pervasive problems related to human welfare and security, as well as deeply embedded inequalities; a renewables-based energy transition can help alleviate some of the conditions that underly these issues. The more the energy transition can help solve these broad challenges, the more its popular acceptance and legitimacy will rise, provided also that community needs and interests are well represented and integrated into transition planning.\n\nRewriting international co-operation\n\nThe dynamism of energy sectors and geopolitical developments necessitates greater scrutiny of international co-operation modalities, instruments and approaches to ensure their relevance, impact and agility. To achieve a successful energy transition, international co-operation needs to be enhanced and redesigned. The centrality of energy to the global development and climate agenda is undisputed, and international co-operation in energy has increased exponentially in recent years. This co-operation plays a decisive role in determining the outcomes of the energy transition and is a critical avenue for achieving greater resilience, inclusion and equality.\n\nThe expanding variety of actors engaged in the energy transition requires an assessment of roles to leverage respective strengths and efficiently allocate limited public resources. The imperatives of development and climate action, coupled with changing energy supply and demand dynamics, require coherence and alignment around priority actions. For instance, investment in systems for cross-border and global trade of energy commodities will require international co-operation on an unprecedented scale. It is, therefore, essential to reconsider the roles and responsibilities of national and regional entities, international organisations, and international financial institutions and multilateral development banks to ensure their optimal contribution to the energy transition.\n\nAchieving the energy transition will require collective efforts to channel funds to the Global South. In 2020, multilateral and bilateral development finance institutions (DFIs) provided less than 3% of total renewable energy investments. Going forward, they need to direct more funds, at better terms, towards large-scale energy transition projects. Moreover, financing from DFIs was provided mainly through debt financing at market rates (requiring repayment with interest rates charged at market value) while grants and concessional loans amounted to just 1% of total renewable energy finance (IRENA and CPI, 2023). These institutions are uniquely placed to support large-scale and cross-border projects that can make a notable difference in accelerating the global energy transition.\n\nAs in previous editions, IRENA uses six performance indicators to monitor progress towards the 1.5°C pathway:\n\nUse of renewables to generate electricity: comprising two sub-indicators; 1) the amount of electricity generated from renewables and 2) the share of renewables in the total electricity generated.\n\nDirect uses of renewables: comprising two sub-indicators; 1) the share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption and 2) the quantity of modern bioenergy used.\n\nImprovements in energy intensity.\n\nThe electrification of end-use sectors.\n\nProduction and supply of clean hydrogen and derivative fuels.\n\nThe amount of carbon dioxide captured and removed by various methods.\n\nTable 1.1 details the 2020 standing of the six indicators, both globally and in the G20, compared with projections of their standing in 2030 and 2050 under the 1.5°C Scenario and a reference scenario based on current plans.\n\nUnder the 1.5°C Scenario, electricity generation would more than triple from 2020 to 2050, with 91% of the total electricity supply coming from renewable sources, compared to 28% in 2020 (see Figure 1.1). Coal- and oil-based power generation would experience a sharp decline over the decade before being phased out entirely by mid-century. By 2050, natural gas would provide 5% of total electricity needs, with the remaining 4% being met by nuclear power plants. The transition features a synergy between increasingly affordable renewable power technologies and the wider adoption of electric technologies for end-use applications, especially in transport and heat. The electrification of transport, heat and other end uses implies that global renewable power generation capacity would need to expand by a factor of almost 12 by end-2050, compared to 2020 levels, in order to meet the 1.5°C target. A detailed analysis can be found in Chapter 2.\n\nThe scale-up would grow the share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption (TFEC) from 18% in 2020 to 82% by 2050. The 1.5°C Scenario envisages electricity becoming the main energy carrier, accounting for over 50% of TFEC (see Figure 1.2). Renewable energy deployment, improvements in energy efficiency and the electrification of end-use sectors contribute to this shift. In addition, modern biomass and hydrogen are projected to play more significant roles, with 16% and 14% of TFEC by 2050, respectively. Notably, 94% of hydrogen production is expected to come from renewables, indicating a growing reliance on clean energy sources (IRENA, 2022b, 2022c, 2022d). The pathway also suggests that TFEC could fall 6% between 2020 and 2050, suggesting a potential trend towards decarbonisation and a more sustainable energy future.\n\nTotal primary energy supply remains stable due to increased energy efficiency and growth of renewables (see Figure 1.3). The share of renewable energy in primary energy supply would grow from 16% in 2020 to 77% in 2050. The energy mix would change drastically in the process, with a net gain of 61 percentage points of renewable energy share in total primary energy supply, driven by a mix of end-use electrification, renewable fuels and direct uses. Achieving this level of renewable energy penetration is critical to meeting global climate goals and would require significant investment and policy support, as well as continued innovation.\n\nRenewables would account for 77% of primary energy supply by 2050 in the 1.5°C Scenario\n\nThe energy transition should aim to deliver improved energy intensity across the economy through a range of energy efficiency technologies, complemented by structural and behavioural changes. Energy intensity improvements are associated with a combination of deployments of renewable and efficient technologies in end-use sectors, along with extensive electrification.\n\nPower demand would need to grow three-fold by 2050 through extensive electrification of end-use sectors - 37% supplied by solar and 36% by wind. By 2030 the installed capacity of renewable power would need to expand almost four times to set the world on track for the transition. Specifically, the share of variable renewable energy (VRE) in the generation mix would need to increase from the current 9% to 46% by 2030, requiring additional flexibility in the operation of the energy system for economic and security reasons.\n\nMuch improved energy efficiency, structural and behavioural changes are all needed under the 1.5°C Scenario\n\nBioenergy for modern uses in various forms (i.e. solid biomass, biogas, biomethane and liquid biofuels) would supply 22% of total primary energy by 2050 - 2.5 times present levels. In the transport sector, sustainable biofuels would meet 13% of TFEC by 2050.\n\nFrom its negligible levels in 2020, the production of clean hydrogen, both for direct use as well as use of derivative fuels, should ramp up to 523 Mt by 2050. Hydrogen and its related compounds – ammonia, methanol and kerosene – would account for 14% of final energy use by 2050. Early investment in the green hydrogen supply chain (electrolysis, fuel cells, transport pipelines, storage caverns, etc.) is vital to the uptake of hydrogen applications in end-use sectors and to carbon reduction goals. This is especially the case for hard-to-decarbonise sectors like air, marine and heavy-duty transport, as well as some primary industrial processes. By 2030 IRENA expects that 50 Mt of green hydrogen would be required, which would need to scale up ten-fold by 2050.\n\nWith only 0.04 Gt of carbon captured in 2020, removal and storage measures - from carbon capture and storage (CCS) to bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and other methods – should be scaled up to remove 7 Gt by 2050. Although ambitious expansions of renewables and efficiency measures account for most emission reductions, remaining carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from fossil fuels - primarily in industrial processes and some transport – would require CCS technologies together with CO₂ removal measures. A total of 109 Gt of CO₂ would require removal between 2023 and 2050. CCS from bioenergy will be important in power, heat and cogeneration plants, as well as in some industrial applications. Meanwhile, fossil fuel-based carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) and CCS are vital processes for removing emissions in cement, iron, steel and chemicals production. Captured carbon needs to reach 2.2 Gt by 2030 from current negligible levels, with the main focus being industrial processes.\n\nIn the Planned Energy Scenario, the reference case of this study, annual emissions would decline only slightly to 34 GtCO₂ in 2050 (see Figure 1.4). By contrast, to meet Paris Agreement commitments, IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario plots a steep and continuous drop to net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050. The Scenario depends on a steep reduction in global CO₂ emissions through 2030, followed by a continued downward trajectory, reaching net zero by 2050. To accomplish this, substantial efforts beyond those already planned in sectors such as power, heat and industry would be needed, with negative emissions delivering the necessary additional carbon reductions.\n\nIf all the above-mentioned technologies and measures were achieved, global CO₂ emissions could be reduced dramatically, reaching negative emissions of 0.2 GtCO₂/year by 2050 (i.e. removing more CO₂ than is produced). The largest declines would come from the use of renewables in power generation and for direct uses in heat and transport, combined with energy conservation and efficiency; together these would make up more than half the cuts in global CO₂ emissions, followed by a 19% contribution from the direct electrification of various end-use sectors and 12% from the use of hydrogen and its derivatives, including synthetic fuels and feedstocks (see Figure 1.5). As noted above, the remaining CO₂ in the period to 2050 would need to be captured and stored either through CCS/CCU, BECCS or other carbon removal measures such as direct air capture, soil carbon sequestration, enhanced mineralisation, ocean-based CO₂ removal and afforestation or reforestation.\n\nIRENA also compiles several regional renewable energy and energy transition outlooks. These studies provide deeper regional and country insights into the technologies, measures, policies and impacts associated with the transition. They also provide views on regional co-operation and joint actions (see Box 1.2).\n\n2.2.1 Status and trends\n\nInstalled renewable energy capacity and generation\n\nThe power sector is crucial for he energy transition requiring rapid scale-up of renewablesbased generation capacity\n\nThe power sector has seen good progress in installed renewable capacity and generation. Renewables represented 83% of capacity additions and installed power generation capacity reached 40% globally in 2022, with the addition of 295 gigawatts (GW) of renewables (Figure 2.1), the largest-ever annual increase in renewable energy capacity (IRENA, 2023a). The strong business case for renewables, combined with policy support, has sustained an upward trend in their share of the global energy mix. However, overall deployment remains centred on a few countries and regions, with China, the European Union and the United States accounting for 75% of capacity additions. Although large-scale renewable energy deployment is typically associated with countries that have well-developed power systems, deployment must be expanded elsewhere, especially in developing nations lacking electricity access.\n\nAmong renewable technologies, solar photovoltaic (PV) installations grew the fastest, with a twenty sixfold increase in the 13-year period from 2010 to 2022. This was due to significant cost reductions backed by technological advancements, high learning rates, policy support and innovative financing models. By the end of 2022, global cumulative solar PV installed capacity reached 1 047 GW, of which 191 GW was added in 2022 alone, with 59% of the installations in Asia (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nRenewable power has seen significant growth since 2010 with solar capacity growing by 26 times\n\nWind power saw over five-fold growth in the 13-year period from 2010 to 2022. In 2022, global cumulative onshore wind power installed capacity reached approximately 836 GW. As with solar PV, Asia led in the onshore wind market, with 393 GW of cumulative installed capacity, and it was home to more than 55% of the installations in 2022. The offshore wind market remains smaller than the onshore wind market, with 63 GW of cumulative installed capacity by the end of 2022. Both Asia and Europe contributed 50% to this total capacity (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nHydropower continues to be the largest renewable power source in terms of installed capacity. In 2022, global hydropower installed capacity (excluding pumped hydro) reached 1 256 GW (37% of total renewable capacity). Other renewable power technologies, such as bioenergy, geothermal, solar thermal and marine energy, also grew rapidly over the past decade, albeit from a small base. The combined installed capacity of these renewables reached 171 GW in 2022, of which bioenergy power accounted for 87% (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nConcerning off-grid renewables, their cumulative capacity (in all regions excluding Eurasia, North America and Europe) grew by 1 237 megawatts in 2022 to reach 12.4 GW, an 11% increase from 2021 levels. Solar expanded by 478 megawatts to reach 5.1 GW, off-grid hydro capacity remained about the same as in 2021 and the remainder of this increase came from the expansion of different types of bioenergy (IRENA, 2023a).\n\nRenewables-based power generation costs and energy price volatility\n\nRenewables represent a vital pillar in the global effort to reduce and ultimately phase out fossil fuels and increase countries’ resilience to volatility of fossil fuel prices. High coal and fossil gas prices in 2021 and 2022 further undermined the competitiveness of fossil fuels, making solar and wind even more attractive.\n\nThe decline in renewable electricity costs has make it the most economical choice for power generation in many areas. In 2021, over 163 gigawatts (GW) of renewable power generation capacity produced electricity at a lower cost than the cheapest source of new fossil fuel-based capacity. These 163 GW represented 73% of the total global increase in renewable power generation capacity. The new projects deployed in 2021 will generate cumulative undiscounted savings of at least USD 149 billion over their lifetimes. Besides these direct cost savings, renewables’ deployment brings substantial economic benefits due to reduced CO₂ emissions and local air pollutants. These need to be factored in - as do their energy security advantages - when considering the total benefits.\n\nIn total, the 12-year period between 2010 and 2021 saw the deployment of 786 GW of renewable power generation capacity that cost less than the cheapest fossil fuel-based alternative in the Group of Twenty (G20).\n\nSince 2010, there has been a seismic shift in the competitiveness of renewable power generation options. The global weighted average levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of newly commissioned utility-scale solar PV projects declined by 88% over the 12-year period from 2010 to 2021. Meanwhile, the LCOE for onshore wind, concentrated solar power and offshore wind fell by 68%, 67% and 60%, respectively. In 2021, the LCOE of utility-scale solar PV declined by 13% year-on-year, whereas those of onshore wind and offshore wind fell by 15% and 13%, respectively (Figure 2.2).\n\nPrices of PV modules and wind turbines\n\nRenewable electricity costs continued their historic downward trend, in spite of the pandemic\n\nIncreases in commodity and renewable equipment prices affect project costs with a delay, given there is a time gap between a financial investment decision and when a project is commissioned. Hence, the global weighted average costs of solar PV, as well as onshore and offshore wind power, fell in 2021. However, the total installed project cost data for the projects commissioned in 2021 did not show any significant increase on average, despite the emerging supply chain challenges and rising commodity costs in the same year. This was attributed to the lag between equipment cost increases in the commissioned projects.\n\nThe global weighted average LCOE of onshore wind projects commissioned in 2021 fell from USD 0.039/kWh (kilowatt hour) in 2020 to USD 0.033/kWh.\n\nThe global weighted average LCOE of newly commissioned utility‑scale solar PV projects fell from USD 0.055/kWh to USD 0.048/kWh in 2021. This was driven by a 6% decline in this technology’s global weighted average total installed cost, from USD 916/kW in 2020 to USD 857/kW for the projects commissioned in 2021. This was less than the 12% decline observed in 2020, since rising PV module prices at the end of 2020 appear to have had some impact on total costs for a significant number of projects. Overall, the impact was limited, with only three of the top 25 markets for new installations in 2021 seeing an increase in their countrylevel weighted average total installed costs.\n\nSince 2022, many countries have seen the average cost of electricity from solar PV and onshore wind increase. Increases are more common for onshore wind and are also larger than for solar PV. Both the supply chain constraints that began in 2020, and the general commodity price inflation beginning in 2022, are now being felt in project costs much more widely than in 2021, at least for onshore wind. At a global level, the impact has been muted, given the dominance of China in the share of solar PV and onshore wind deployment, and their continued cost declines.\n\nThe decarbonisation of the power sector by 2050 is crucial to achieve the 1.5°C target\n\nYet, as noted above, the impact of these factors on the projects commissioned in 2021 was not enough to raise the full-year weighted average LCOE in many individual markets as well as globally.3 That is not to say that individual projects commissioned towards the end of 2021 did not experience higher costs than in 2020, but that the cost of electricity for all projects in 2021 was on average still lower than in 2020. Although there are limits to what can be extrapolated from IRENA’s data, five key factors may be noted:\n\nOverall equipment cost increases were moderate in late 2020 and early 2021, when many projects commissioned in 2021 would have placed their orders.\n\nLarger projects have greater purchasing power and longer lead times, blunting price hikes and delaying their impact. Such larger projects are also increasingly dominating capacity additions outside Europe.\n\nContingency allowances in most projects appear in many cases to have absorbed some or all of any increased costs.\n\nTechnology improvements (e.g. more efficient PV modules and larger wind turbines) and improvements in manufacturing efficiency and scale continue, reducing the impact of increases in commodity prices.\n\nChina remains the dominant market for new solar and wind capacity additions and has lower commodity prices and transport costs, while in 2021, its local market/policy dynamics also favoured lower pricing – at least for onshore wind.\n\nWhen examining the cost of capital, which is a major determinant of the cost of electricity from renewable technologies, the very low financing costs for renewable power projects in 2020 and 2021 have also contributed to the low LCOEs seen in 2022, despite the equipment cost increases, given that the majority of projects would have been financed in 2021 prior to the sharp increases in risk-free rates (IRENA, 2023b).\n\n2.2.2 Power sector transformation: Key indicators\n\nThe power sector is one of the largest contributors to global emissions and accounted for 40% of CO₂ emissions in 2022 (IEA, 2023a). Decarbonisation of this sector by 2050 is an ambitious yet crucial goal in combatting climate change and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide. Electrification is a key enabler of power sector decarbonisation, which, along with achievement of the 1.5°C target, requires a transition from fossil fuels to renewables to generate electricity.\n\nThe technical potential of renewable energy technologies far exceeds the current global electricity production (IRENA, 2022a). In fact, over the outlook period, most capacity additions are projected to come from renewables. To support renewables’ expansion, a database of suitable power projects should be prepared in this coming decade to build a pipeline of projects in further decades leading up to 2050. In the Planned Energy Scenario (PES), renewable energy capacity expands to 6 773 GW by 2030 and 15 835 GW by 2050 (see Figure 2.3 and Table 2.1). Renewables’ share in generation scales up from 28% in 2020 to 46% in 2030, and to over 70% in 2050. However, the current plans as foreseen in the Planned Energy Scenario fall well short of limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5°C. The gap between where we need to be and where we are headed is widening every year.\n\nIn IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, electricity consumption in end-use sectors would triple by 2050, to over 87 000 terawatt hours (TWh), compared with 2020. To meet the rising demand, the power sector would undergo even deeper decarbonisation than most other sectors, reaching 68% and 91% of renewable energy share in the total electricity generation in 2030 and 2050, respectively (see Table 2.1). Total installed renewable generation capacity would need to increase four-fold by 2030 (11 174 GW) and twelve-fold by 2050 (33 216 GW), over the 2020 level. This means annual average renewable energy capacity addition of approximately 1 000 GW in the current decade, more than three times the installed renewable capacity addition in 2022 and close to 1 100 GW by 2050.\n\nIn line with the deep decarbonisation of the sector, the share in overall electricity generation of coal- and oilfired power plants would see a sharp decline over the decade (from 34% in 2020 to 9% in 2030 for the former, and from 3% in 2020 to 0% in 2030 for the latter) before being completely phased out by the middle of the century. By 2050, natural gas would account for 5% of the total electricity generation and the remaining 4% would be provided by nuclear power plants.\n\nThe scaling up of renewable power generation capacity from a range of technologies in all countries across the globe is required to meet the 1.5°C target. The degree of penetration of different renewable energy technologies within countries varies depending upon their technical resource potential and cost competitiveness in the market. Most of the deployment is expected to occur in the G20, which would account for more than 80% of renewable installed capacities globally by 2030. G20 countries' renewable capacity needs to scale up by almost four times to reach 9 400 GW by 2030, and by ten times to reach nearly 24 900 GW by 2050, from the 2020 level, in order to align with a 1.5°C pathway.\n\nVariable renewables, mostly solar PV and wind, will dominate the capacity rollout globally, representing the vast majority of capacity additions and transforming electricity systems and markets. This sees these technologies supplying 46% and 70% of electricity generation by 2030 and 2050, respectively from a combined share of 9% in 2020 (see Table 2.1). The growth is driven by the availability of ample resources, technology cost reductions, the modularity of these technologies, advancement of energy storage technology, and government policies supporting renewable energy development.\n\nThe nature of these resources sees a need for scaling and enhanced management of transmission and distribution systems to facilitate higher electrification and transmit renewable power to demand centres. Coupled with electricity storage and smart electrification, these can flexibly allow demand to be met, whilst minimising curtailment of renewables across very wide geographic areas (see Box 2.1 for further elaboration on the benefits of power system flexibility).\n\nThe high rollout of VRE without effective integration measures across the system will lead to more costly electricity supply, so they must scale together. Generation sources that can be readily dispatched to meet demand during periods of low VRE supply (such as reservoir hydropower) will also be very important and a key component in power system design at lowest cost.\n\nExisting VRE targets included in the Planned Energy Scenario would increase the total VRE capacity to 5 071 GW by 2030, representing slightly more than half of the capacity (8 990 GW) needed to achieve the 1.5°C target. Under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, installed solar PV capacity would exceed 5 400 GW by 2030 and 18 200 GW by 2050. Wind installations would surpass 3 500 GW by 2030 and reach almost 10 300 GW by 2050.\n\nOver the coming decades, solar PV and wind will dominate the growth of renewables in the power sector\n\nSolar PV capacity has grown significantly in recent years, and it continues to show an upward trend. As mentioned earlier, under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the global installed solar PV capacity would increase almost eight-fold by 2030, compared to 2020 capacity, surpassing 5 400 GW, and would expand to over 18 200 GW by 2050. To accomplish this, annual solar PV capacity additions would increase from 191 GW in 2022 to 615 GW on average out to 2050. The potential for solar PV varies significantly across regions. This variation depends on solar irradiation and other factors, such as land availability and policy support. The global solar PV market would be dominated by G20 countries, with the market expected to grow seven-fold by 2030, reaching a cumulative capacity of approximately 4 530 GW, and twenty-fold by 2050, reaching 13 315 GW of capacity from the 2020 level. Achieving these targets would involve net average annual capacity addition of almost 450 GW in the 28-year period from 2023 to 2050.\n\nWind energy has grown rapidly over the past decade, with installed capacity trebling over the period between 2012 and 2022 (IRENA, 2023a). According to IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, wind energy would be one of the largest sources of electricity worldwide, with installed capacity expanding to almost 10 300 GW by 2050. Over the past decade, 55 GW of wind capacity were added annually on average, with 75 GW added in 2022. Meanwhile, the overall outlook period would see 335 GW of net average annual wind capacity additions. Global onshore wind requires significant expansion, with nearly 280 GW of annual capacity deployment on average, to reach 3 040 GW within this decade. This growth would have to be even faster to reach nearly 7 820 GW by 2050 – a more than eleven-fold increase from the 2020 level. China, the United States, Canada, Brazil and many European countries have high onshore wind potential.\n\nUnder the 1.5°C Scenario, the global installed offshore wind capacity would reach almost 500 GW in 2030, a fourteen-fold growth over 2020 levels. Meeting this target would require a massive expansion in annual capacity additions (54 GW) in this decade as against only 3 GW per year in the previous decade. By 2050, offshore power plants of almost 2 500 GW in combined capacity would need to be installed globally. G20 countries would account for the largest shares of 94% (approximately 460 GW) and 95% (approximately 2 300 GW) of the total offshore capacity in 2030 and 2050, respectively. The majority of expansions would be in the top four markets (China, EU-27, the United States and India), accounting for more than 60% of the entire market by 2030.\n\nThe power systems of tomorrow will need to integrate very large shares of generation from variable renewables. This will be a considerable challenge, but is possible to achieve with novel operational strategies and mechanisms. However, a range of renewable sources are needed to achieve the 1.5°C target and each technology plays a key role in meeting electricity demand. VRE would dominate the capacity expansion in both the near and long-term, as shown in Figure 2.4. This would represent a transformative shift in power system supply and demand dynamics. Linking this expansion with battery capacity would enable smoother integration of these sources over time and help reduce the impact of transmission bottlenecks in power networks.\n\nThe 1.5°C Scenario sees battery storage offering significant flexibility to the power system, reaching almost 360 TW by 2030, and 4 100 GW by 2050, with two-thirds of this being in the G20. Whereas pumped hydro would also provide much needed short- and long-term system flexibility, long-term storage using hydrogen is expected to be restricted to very limited applications where few alternatives are available, owing to its much lower efficiency.\n\nAlso important are sources of clean renewable power that can offer inherent flexibility and dispatchability. Under the 1.5°C Scenario, by 2030, global installed hydropower capacity (excluding pumped hydro) would grow by almost 21% from the 2020 level, reaching 1 465 GW. By 2050, global hydropower installed capacity would double from the 2020 level, surpassing 2 500 GW. Achieving the 1.5°C Scenario would require increasing global average annual additions to almost 50 GW over the outlook period. G20 countries together account for 79% (over 1 100 GW) of the global hydropower capacity by 2030. Among the different regions, Asian countries have substantial technical potential for hydropower growth. All of this hydropower must adhere to the Hydropower Sustainability Standard, a global certification scheme that details sustainability expectations for hydropower projects around the world. It is also worth mentioning that while significant hydropower is needed, without it, other renewables would have to be deployed at much higher levels to compensate for energy shortfalls. Furthermore, extensive long- and short-term storage would be required to ensure year-round electricity supply.\n\nBioenergy, geothermal, concentrated solar power and ocean energy would play a major supporting role in the energy transition of the power sector, especially in the later decades, and many projects can - and will - provide much needed system flexibility in operation. Their total installed capacity is expected to scale almost five-fold by 2030 from the 2020 level, reaching almost 720 GW, as shown in Figure 2.4. This would require average annual capacity additions of around 70 GW in this decade. By 2050, strong growth in these technologies would lead to nearly 2 200 GW of installed capacity. G20 countries would account for more than half of the global installed capacities in 2030 and 2050.\n\nWhile storage enables flexibility over wider time spans in power use, transmission enables flexibility across wider distances. It also enables more cost-effective use of generation assets over wider areas, which applies to both VRE and non-VRE sources, but only if coupled with effective system operation across these areas to minimise the cost of electricity overall.\n\nAll power sector components must combine to deliver an effective, reliable, highly renewable and decarbonised power system\n\nUltimately, each component of the power sector transformation is key and all must combine to deliver an effective, reliable, highly renewable and decarbonised power sector, using technologies that exist today. Such a global uptake of renewables could deliver 155 gigatonnes of CO₂ (GtCO₂) reductions in the 1.5°C Scenario compared with the Planned Energy Scenario and play a formative role in a climate compatible world.\n\nOf the 87 Mt (10 440 petajoules) of hydrogen consumed in 2020, almost all came from fossil fuels (IRENA, 2022g). What steps are needed to expand the production of clean hydrogen, which is set to play a crucial role in the energy system of the future? As global economies aim to become carbon neutral, competitive hydrogen and synthetic fuels derived from hydrogen (such as ammonia, methanol and kerosene) emerge as key components of the energy mix. These fuels will offer an emissions mitigation solution for industry and transport processes that are hard to decarbonise through direct electrification.\n\nIn a 1.5°C future, hydrogen requires significant support encompassing physical infrastructure (e.g. production facilities, storage systems and pipelines), policy and technology. International trade agreements are needed to establish a global hydrogen market, with governments acting to spur early adopters to drive initial demand. Certification schemes would help ensure the sustainability of low-carbon hydrogen production and minimise emissions. Innovative solutions and technological advancements are also needed to improve efficiency and reduce the cost of hydrogen production, storage and distribution. Key areas to consider for R&D include electrolysis, CCS, advanced materials for hydrogen storage and fuel cell technologies. Blue hydrogen, produced from natural gas with CCS, can serve as an interim solution while green hydrogen production from renewable electricity scales up (provided that CCS technology continues to advance).\n\nClean hydrogen is vital for a low-carbon future and requires infrastructure, policies and global co-operation\n\nDirect electrification, where possible, is preferable to using hydrogen, based on the efficiency of the gas' conversion to useful energy. About two to three times more electricity is needed to deliver the same service via hydrogen as direct electricity, due to conversion losses. Economic efficiency depends on a range of factors, including the availability and cost of primary energy sources, the cost of electricity generation and storage technologies, and the cost of hydrogen production, storage, and transport. This means that the use of hydrogen needs to be carefully considered and undertaken only when there are no practical alternatives. As outlined in the previous section, the global power system’s capacity needs to increase five-fold to support the energy transition – and much of this capacity is for hydrogen production. By 2050, the electricity needed for hydrogen production could amount to one-quarter of power generation in the world, and even more in some countries. Integrated planning is needed to ensure a bankable pipeline of renewable power projects to meet this growing demand for hydrogen as well as electrolysers.\n\nHydrogen and its derivative fuels, such as methanol and ammonia (which are more suitable for some applications and as liquid fuels are easier to transport over long distances), would together account for 14% of final energy consumption by 2050 in the 1.5°C Scenario, which is much more than their negligible share of today’s global energy mix. To deliver emissions reductions would necessitate a sea change in how hydrogen is produced: by 2050 most would need to be green and produced from renewable electricity through electrolysis. “Blue” hydrogen – produced from fossil fuels but with their emissions captured – will also be needed.\n\nUnder IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, green and blue hydrogen production needs to grow from negligible levels today to almost 15 exajoules (EJ) (125 Mt) by 2030 and 63 EJ (523 Mt) by 2050 (see Figure 2.5), with green hydrogen dominant across the longer time horizon, rising from 40% in 2030 to 94% by 2050. In this context, hydrogen needs to be low carbon from the outset and ultimately green (produced via electrolysis, using renewable electricity). Green hydrogen today may cost between two and three times more than blue hydrogen, whose base costs are difficult to estimate while facilities are nascent. Reducing renewable power costs and improving electrolyser technologies could make green hydrogen cost-competitive by 2030 or earlier. The cumulative installed capacity of green hydrogen electrolysers needs to grow to some 233 GW by 2030 and 5 722 GW by 2050, when a wide distribution of hydrogen production is envisaged across the world (IRENA, 2022b). This also implies a need for the full supply chain and production capacity for these electrolysers to be developed, in addition to hydrogen infrastructure to transport the gas. Projects to build hydrogen pipelines are especially challenging since they require materials that can withstand high pressures and are resistant to embrittlement. They also require careful design to ensure purity preservation of hydrogen, safe operation as well as material compatibility. At current prices, cost benefit ratios are generally unfavourable. These barriers will need to be overcome to see use of green hydrogen and related carriers, such as ammonia and methanol, reach almost 1% of TFEC in 2030 and 13% by 2050 in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario.\n\nClean hydrogen is likely to play an important role in the industry sector including for green steel production using direct reduced iron, and feedstocks in chemicals and petrochemicals. Its total use (including nonenergy applications) would grow to around 14 EJ by 2030 and 40 EJ by 2050 in those sectors. Hydrogen can also play a fundamental role in balancing renewable electricity supply and demand by absorbing shortterm variations and offering long-term storage to help balance renewables’ seasonal variability. In the 1.5°C Scenario, the production of a very large volume of hydrogen from renewable power in combination with hydrogen storage can help secure long-term seasonal flexibility from 2030 onwards and provide storage capacity estimated at 800 TWh by 2050.\n\nClean hydrogen production must rise significantly to support broad utilisation across sectors under the 1.5°C Scenario\n\nIn other end-use sectors, clean hydrogen and its derivatives, such as methanol and ammonia, will play an important role in certain transport modes. In the 1.5˚C Scenario, they comprise less than 1% of the transport sector’s energy in 2030, but almost 25% by 2050. Clean hydrogen’s use in the buildings sector would remain minor, at around 0.15 EJ by 2030, largely due to the low efficiency of its use compared to direct electrification. Table 2.2 outlines key indicators for hydrogen use in 2030 and 2050 under the 1.5°C Scenario.\n\nGreen hydrogen has risen rapidly up the policy agenda in recent years\n\n2.4.1 Key indicators for bioenergy supply and consumption\n\nBioenergy plays a key role in reaching the 1.5°C climate goal (IRENA, 2021a). Given its potential to replace fossil fuel in all energy sectors – including in electricity production; in end uses in industry, buildings and transport; and as a chemical feedstock – it is important in the transition towards a renewables-based energy mix. In 2020, bioenergy accounted for 9.5% of the total primary energy supply. Bioenergy supply was dominated by modern uses of solid biomass (43%), followed by biomass for traditional cooking and heating purposes in developing countries (39%) and by biogas and biofuel feedstocks (18%).\n\nAs shown in Figure 2.7, under the 1.5°C Scenario, biomass supply would need to grow to 86 EJ by 2030 and 135 EJ by 2050, from the 2020 level (56 EJ). This includes reducing inefficient use of traditional biomass, which is currently used as fuel for cooking and heating. Modern bioenergy would need to increase from 33 EJ (current levels) by a factor of about 2.5 by 2030 and increase four-fold by 2050. While the estimate of about 135 EJ of biomass supply is towards the higher end of what can potentially be sustained, as estimated by IRENA and other institutions for 2050 (Faaij, 2018; IRENA, 2014, 2016b, 2016a), such a level can in principle be supplied sustainably without negative changes in land use. However, it will be a major challenge to scale up biomass production to those levels while avoiding adverse environmental or social consequences.\n\nPower generation from bioenergy 6 would represent around 4.5% of the generation – 6.5 EJ in 2030 and 14.9 EJ in 2050 – under the 1.5°C Scenario. This would be an increase of more than three and seven times, respectively, from current levels. Biomass use combined with CCS in the power sector and some industrial sectors would be critical in achieving the net-zero goal. Processes using biomass, to which CCS could in principle be applied, could potentially capture approximately 10 GtCO₂ equivalent per year by 2050 (Lyons et al., 2021). Under the 1.5°C Scenario, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is assumed to capture and store about 3.4 GtCO₂ in 2050 (84% from the power and heat sectors and 16% from industry).\n\nUnder the 1.5°C Scenario, modern bioenergy supply would need to increase four-fold by 2050 compared to 2020\n\nBioenergy accounted for 11% of the final energy consumption in 2020. Its consumption was distributed among traditional use of biomass (51%), and modern uses in industry (22%), buildings (17%), transport (9%) and other consumption (1%) (see Figure 2.8). Traditional use involves the use of biomass in simple and inefficient stoves and open fires. This type of use causes indoor air pollution and has severe health consequences. It also results in forest degradation, leading to GHG emissions and biodiversity loss. A global effort is needed to provide clean cooking fuel for all – as embodied in UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 (IEA et al., 2021: 7).\n\nSubstantial reduction of traditional biomass use by 2030 is required to achieve SDG7\n\nThe main steps required to achieve the 1.5°C Scenario include substantial reduction of inefficient (traditional) biomass use by 2030; greater modern biomass use for energy in buildings until 2030 and stabilising growth until 2050; steep rises in bioenergy in industry until 2050; and greater use of biofuels for road transport, aviation and shipping.\n\nBy 2030, the 1.5°C Scenario envisages massive reductions in inefficient uses of biomass for cooking and heating in the buildings sector. Achieving universal access to clean cooking technologies and fuels by 2030 would require rolling out clean technologies such as efficient improved cookstoves fuelled by sustainably produced bioenergy or electric stoves. Modern use of bioenergy in buildings would grow from 7.3 EJ in 2020 to 11.3 EJ by 2030, and 9.4 EJ by 2050.\n\nBioenergy will play an important role in medium- and high-temperature heat applications in industry, and as a chemical feedstock. Under the 1.5°C Scenario, global bioenergy demand in the industry sector would be 21 EJ by 2030 and 27.6 EJ by 2050. Meanwhile, global bio-based plastic production would reach 73 Mt annually in the chemical and petrochemical sector, up from just above 2 Mt today. This would represent approximately 20% of the total plastic production. A further 51 Mt of other synthetic organic materials would be produced from biomass feedstock by 2050. Bio-based feedstocks play a minor role in chemical production today. Bio-based feedstocks are used to produce about 1% of plastics and less than 1% of chemicals. Under the 1.5°C Scenario, use of bioenergy feedstocks for chemical production grows to 4.1 EJ in 2030 and 10.9 EJ in 2050.\n\nBioenergy contributes to transport decarbonisation. Under the 1.5°C Scenario, bioenergy consumption in transport would grow from 3.7 EJ in 2020 to 9.1 EJ by 2030, and to 12 EJ by 2050. This growth would complement fuel efficiency improvements and the increased number of electric vehicles on the road. Increasing biofuel blending ratios, especially in this decade, could be crucial to reduce emissions from road transport until global fleets are electrified.\n\nSustainability must be a key consideration in bioenergy policy\n\nIn aviation, biojet fuels play a much bigger role. Their use together with synthetic fuels opens opportunities to decarbonise the sector. Under the 1.5°C Scenario, approximately 110 billion litres of biojet fuels would be produced annually. Liquid biofuel would meet 24% of the overall energy demand in the transport sector, and their production would grow almost four-fold by 2050. In the shipping sector, biofuel would play a more limited role, with only a 10% share in the energy mix by 2050 under the 1.5˚C Scenario. Table 2.3 outlines key indicators for bioenergy supply and consumption in 2030 and 2050 under the 1.5°C Scenario.\n\n2.6.1 Policies for buildings sector transformation\n\nBuilding energy codes are a key instrument to promote energy efficiency\n\nThe transition to net-zero buildings requires policy support and enabling measures, including to reduce buildings’ energy demand, make them energy efficient and promote electrification and the direct use of renewables for heating and cooling. Suitable policy packages may be chosen based on climate conditions, renewables’ potential, financial resources and other factors unique to countries and cities. Some widely adopted policies include building codes; ban of fossil fuel use for heating; financial and fiscal incentives for renovation, efficiency and renewables; targets on net-zero buildings; minimum energy performance standards (MEPSs) as well as mandates of solar hot water for public or residential buildings.\n\nBuilding energy codes are the most widely recognised and scalable actions to decarbonise the buildings sector (UNEP, 2018). Enacted by national or subnational governments, they typically include regulations for the construction, renovation and repair of buildings and other structures that people may occupy. These codes can promote energy efficiency through performance standards for new and refurbished buildings or encouraging the deployment of renewable applications, including solar PV rooftop and solar water heaters. Over 80 countries worldwide have implemented building codes, with the majority covering both residential and public buildings (IEA, 2022d). Policy makers can enhance building energy codes by extending their scope to cover all types of buildings, imposing stricter energy performance requirements, in alignment with net-zero targets. For example, Australia, Japan, Türkiye, the United States and many European countries have mandatory building energy codes for existing buildings (Battelle Memorial Institute, 2021).\n\nReliance on fossil fuels can be minimised by phasing out their use for heating in buildings, in turn creating a market for electrified solutions and renewables’ direct use. By 2022, some 13 countries and 59 cities had passed or proposed restrictions on the use of fossil gas, oil or coal for heating or cooking in buildings (REN21, 2022) . In 2017, Norway adopted a national regulation to ban fossil oil for heating in buildings from 2020 (MCE, 2019). In the United Kingdom, starting in 2025, low-carbon heating sources will be mandatory in new homes. Also, as of 1 May 2023, the country banned all sales of traditional house coal (DEFRA, 2022). Municipalities can play a stronger role. For example, in 2021, New York City adopted a policy to prohibit natural gas in new buildings under seven stories, effective 2024, and for all new buildings, effective 2027 (Maldonado, 2023). Similarly, in 2020, Seattle (United States) announced a ban on fossil fuel for heating in new constructions (IRENA, 2022j).\n\nMEPSs are the main policy measures to achieve energy efficiency for electric appliances. Some 80 countries have adopted MEPSs to promote efficient home appliances. These cover almost 80% of energy use for all residential refrigeration and three-quarters of energy use for televisions (IEA, 2022e). Some developing countries, such as Thailand, Viet Nam and Malaysia, have adopted mandatory MEPSs for air conditioners and refrigerators (International Copper Association, 2016). However, new MEPSs should be technology neutral to avoid persistence of less efficient appliances in the market (CLASP, 2023). Aside from MEPSs, energy efficiency in buildings can also be promoted through energy labelling and energy performance certificates.\n\nLeading countries and regions have begun adopting targets for regulating emissions from new buildings. These targets for 100% zero-emission buildings are achieved through high energy efficiency and the supply of the remaining energy requirements with renewables. In 2021, the European Commission proposed a policy requiring all new buildings to release zero emissions starting in 2030 (European Commission, 2021a). The City of Vancouver (Canada) also aims to have all new buildings 100% emission free starting in 2030 (City of Vancouver, 2016). About 21 city authorities, including Cape Town, Copenhagen, Johannesburg, Medellín and San José, have committed to owning, occupying and developing only net-zero assets by 2030 (C40, 2023).\n\nEnergy efficiency and renewables in buildings can also be supported through financial and fiscal policies, including direct funding, subsidies, grants, rebates and loans. In 2022, the European Commission approved a scheme proposed by the German government to provide state aid of EUR 2.98 billion in grants until 2028 to encourage the promotion of new district heating networks, which must operate on at least 75% renewables and waste heat. The grant can cover up to 40% of the investment cost of renewable heating projects (Abnett, 2022). Seoul (Republic of Korea) metropolitan government launched a programme in 2020 to support projects integrating solar PV in buildings. The programme can cover 80% of the installation costs (C40, 2021).\n\nGovernments can also consider applying information and communications technology to collect, monitor and analyse energy consumption data (through sensors and smart meters) for buildings, including consumption for lighting, heating and cooling, and all electric appliances. This can provide a basis for diagnosing energy consumption, setting building efficiency benchmarks and developing tailored actions to improve operation and propose changes to occupants’ behaviours. In Shanghai, China, the municipal government launched a digital platform to monitor the energy consumption of government-owned office buildings and large-scale public buildings (over 20 000 m2 of floor area) since 2010. By the end of 2021, the monitoring system had covered 2 143 public buildings (approximately 101 million m2 of floor area) within the city. The system has been crucial in improving city-level building codes and supporting other relevant policy making (SHHURD and SHDRC, 2022).\n\nMandates and fiscal incentives can help promote the direct use of renewables in buildings\n\nDistrict heating and cooling networks can allow using low-temperature renewables and can be feasible and cost-effective in dense urban areas with high heating/cooling demands and abundant renewable resources. The networks can be made even more effective with thermal storage for excess heating and cooling capacity during low-demand periods, which can be supplied during peak demand (IRENA and Aalborg University, 2021). Connection mandates for new developments and public buildings can support the expansion of district energy networks and ensure heating demand. For example, all new developments in Amsterdam (the Netherlands) are required to have a district heating connection. The same is also required for all municipal buildings in Oslo (Norway), unless there is evidence that they have lower-emissions alternatives (IRENA, 2022j).\n\nTo support the energy transition, countries should also prioritise policies and measures to promote the direct use of solar thermal and geothermal for heating. In this regard, solar thermal installation mandates for new or existing buildings have been implemented in many countries and cities, and have proven effective, with Barbados, Cyprus and Israel becoming the top three countries in terms of installed per capita capacity (IRENA et al., 2020). Solar thermal mandates are typically combined with financial or fiscal incentives. For instance, Italy’s national scheme, Conto Termico, helped the country to achieve 83% more solar thermal installations in 2021 than in the previous year. The scheme provides solar heating plants of sizes up to 2 500 m2 with an incentive that covers up to 65% of solar thermal project investment costs (Solar Thermal World, 2022).\n\n2.7.1 Key indicators for transport sector transformation\n\nAccelerated deployment of low-carbon solutions is needed to transform the transport sector\n\nMobility, of people and goods, is key in today’s economy and society. The transport sector, which relies heavily on fossil fuels, released 6.9 GtCO₂ emissions in 2020, representing a fifth of the global energy-related CO₂ emissions. However, these emissions were lower than those in 2019, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, the transport sector released close to a quarter of the global energy-related CO₂ emissions. The sector consumed 104 EJ of energy in 2020, 14% lower than in 2019, meeting its demand predominantly with fossil fuels (95%), followed by biofuels (4%) and electricity (1%). Road transport alone was responsible for more than three-quarters of the sector’s energy consumption, followed by shipping (10%), aviation (8%) and rail (2%). With the global demand for transport services expected to increase in future years, it is crucial to sustainably transform the sector to a zero-carbon sector.\n\nIRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario sees the transport sector undergoing a faster and more significant transformation compared with current projections, with accelerated deployment of low-carbon solutions. Figure 2.14 shows the estimated evolution of transport energy consumption along with the CO₂ emissions trajectory until 2050 according to the 1.5°C Scenario.\n\nThe 1.5°C Scenario sees widescale electrification of transport sector energy consumption\n\nA combination of low-carbon approaches would reduce transport emissions to just 0.6 GtCO₂ annually by 2050, a 91% reduction compared with 2020. These include measures in electrification, scale-up of renewable fuels, including biofuels, hydrogen and derivative fuels; and energy efficiency and technological innovation measures across all transportation modes.\n\nAccelerating EV adoption for road transport, along with power supply decarbonisation, is by far the most important lever for transport sector decarbonisation. Technological progress – notably, evolution of batteries – has greatly improved the economic case for EVs in recent years, and the scope of application is quickly expanding to a broader set of road vehicle segments and service types (see Box 2.9). Under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, EVs 1 would account for more than 90% of all road transport stock by 2050 (95% of the technology mix in motorcycles, 93% in light passenger vehicles, 82% in buses, 80% in light-duty trucks and 67% in heavyduty vehicles). Some G20 countries already have very strong electrification targets to reduce fossil fuel dependency, as reflected in the Planned Energy Scenario. An example is the plan to ban CO₂-emitting cars from 2035 in Europe (European Council, 2023). Other countries would have to set more ambitious targets aligned with IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario.\n\nElectrification is also crucial for deeper decarbonisation of the rail sector. In 2019, electricity met 42% of global train energy demand. Electric train technology is mature, and electrification is technically possible and can be cost-effective under a broad set of circumstances. High-speed train routes reduce the demand for short-haul aviation. Under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, electricity would account for 89% share in rail energy consumption by 2050.\n\nStringent efficiency standards and behavioural changes are crucial for transport sector transformation\n\nTransport sector decarbonisation will require scaling up the adoption of renewable fuels, including sustainable biofuels, hydrogen and synthetic fuels. Under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, the production of sustainable liquid biofuels would need to be scaled up 3.3 times over the current level by 2050. Mitigating transport sector CO₂ emissions would require countries to adopt ambitious biofuel blending targets, especially in this decade until ramp-up of EVs. In certain countries, such as Brazil or Indonesia, biofuels would be crucial in road transport decarbonisation, reaching around 35% in the final energy consumption by 2050. Other countries are currently setting ambitious targets for biofuel blending, for example, India’s 20% blending ratio target for ethanol in gasoline by 2030 (MoPNG, 2018). Biojet fuels would account for 24% of the total energy consumption in aviation under the 1.5°C Scenario by 2050.\n\nRenewables-based fuels 8 would have a 23% share in transport final energy consumption by 2050 (21 EJ). The aviation sector would account for 39% of this consumption, followed by shipping (31%) and road transport (30%). Road transport would see hydrogen demand coming mostly from heavy-duty trucks. The global hydrogen stock would represent a share of 17% by 2050. International shipping would see a diverse mix of low-carbon fuels for decarbonisation, with ammonia, methanol and hydrogen composing almost 61% of the fuel mix by 2050 under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. In aviation, synthetic kerosene use in the total energy consumption would grow up to 42% by 2050.\n\nStringent efficiency standards for all transportation modes are crucial for sectoral transformation, along with behavioural changes. Decarbonisation can be supported through structural changes in the delivery of mobility services. A modal shift from private passenger cars to collective transport, and from passenger aviation and road-based freight to rail, is highly possible but would require developing the necessary infrastructure. This could reduce the energy intensity of the transport sector. Despite an increase in transport demand, the sector’s final energy consumption would decrease 13% by 2050 compared with 2020 levels or by 25% compared with 2019 levels under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. Transport demand in more developed economies would stabilise in the coming decades. Consumption in some of these markets is estimated to decrease by around 50% by 2050 compared with 2019, due to the use of more efficient technologies and modal shifts. However, some emerging economies are expected to see a considerable increase in transport demand in the coming decades; despite a switch to more efficient technologies, this would see an increase in transport energy demand in the order of up to 80% by 2050 over that of 2019.\n\nIRENA’s analysis of the 1.5°C Scenario shows that a combination of efficiency measures and low-carbon approaches would reduce transport consumption to 91 EJ by 2050. Under this scenario, electricity would account for 52% of consumption (91% of which is supplied by renewables), followed by hydrogen and its derivatives (accounting for 23%) and biofuels (representing about 13% of the fuel mix). Fossil fuels would meet the remaining consumption (approximately 11%). At the same time, increased environmental awareness, improved urban planning and behavioural changes are projected to result in a smaller increase in transport demand compared with the Planned Energy Scenario.\n\nLand transport\n\nPopulation and economic growth in developing economies is expected to boost road transport activity. Emerging economies are expected to see a considerable increase in light-duty passenger vehicles per capita (from about 0.04 to 0.23 vehicles) by 2050, whereas this is expected to remain stable in developed economies, and even decline, due to behavioural changes and modal shift towards public transport. Rail transport activity is expected to continue increasing towards 2050 – growth being higher under the 1.5°C Scenario to accommodate the increased demand due to a modal shift.\n\nFuel diversification, and unlocking all possible decarbonisation solutions in transport, are vital\n\nAviation\n\nAviation demand is expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels by 2023. Future growth, measured in revenue passenger-kilometres, would be 2.6% per year on average under the Planned Energy Scenario and slightly lower (at 2.4%) under the 1.5°C Scenario. IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario sees aggressive growth of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) (both biojet fuel and synthetic fuel) from the predominant use of oil today, with shares up to 82% in the energy mix by 2050. Meanwhile, the introduction of novel hydrogen and electric aircraft (or hybrids) from 2035 for short-haul flights would radically transform the aviation sector.\n\nShipping\n\nThe international shipping sector would see a diverse mix of low-carbon fuels to decarbonise the sector, with ammonia, methanol and hydrogen composing almost 61% of the fuel mix by 2050 in IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario. As the International Maritime Organization (IMO) aims to reduce the sector’s carbon intensity by at least 40% by 2030 (relative to 2008), significant efforts to address supply, infrastructure and technological challenges are necessary to increase the uptake of alternative fuels under the 1.5°C Scenario. The maritime sector is already adopting dual-fuel engines for both new vessels and retrofits, with methanol-fuelled options expected to enter the commercial market as early as 2024.\n\nVehicle efficiency policies and standards, including fuel economy standards and tailpipe emissions standards, are a cornerstone of the decarbonisation of the transport sector. Fuel economy standards typically regulate the distance new cars must be able to travel on a unit of fuel, and they can push automakers to manufacture more energy-efficient vehicles. Wide adoption of energy-efficient vehicles and continuous enhancement of fuel efficiency standards can improve the average fuel economy of vehicles. More than ten jurisdictions, including Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and the Republic of Korea, accounting for 80% of new light-duty vehicle sales, have adopted or proposed such policies. Six of them (China, Canada, India, the European Union, the United States and Japan) also apply standards for heavy-duty vehicles (GFEI, 2020). Similarly, tailpipe emissions standards can impose a limit on the maximum pollutant emissions from vehicles. In 2023, the US government proposed new federal vehicle emissions standards, which, if adopted, would add substantial vehicle emissions reductions and increase the sales of electric vehicles (US EPA, 2023).\n\nFuel economy standards have proven effective in enhancing vehicle efficiency\n\nTargets on zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) can provide strong signals to vehicle markets and rapidly increase ZEVs’ market share. In 2021, more than 30 national governments signed the ZEV declaration at COP26. The declaration signatories pledged to work towards 100% ZEV sales for new cars and vans globally by 2040, and by no later than 2035 in leading markets (Owen-Burge, 2021). Five of the signatories are in Africa – namely Cabo Verde, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco and Rwanda. In 2022, major markets announced new targets. China, for instance, announced targets to build charging infrastructure sufficient to meet the needs of more than 20 million ZEVs by 2025 and for 60% of expressway service areas to have rapid charging by 2025 (Government of China, 2022) with subnational targets announced in Guangxi and Guangzhou. ZEV targets will also impact EV supply chains, such as batteries, and installers and operators of charging infrastructure. Similarly, bans on new sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles can send clear signals to investors and manufacturers. The European Union has agreed to ban the sale of ICE-powered cars and vans from 2035.\n\nZEV demand can be effectively boosted through financial and fiscal incentives, including subsidies, capital grants or tax rebate for ZEV purchases, measures that many countries and subnational governments have adopted successfully. France, Germany and the United States are among major EV markets providing financial support for EV purchases. In 2023, the United States under the Inflation Reduction Act offered a consumer tax credit of USD 7 500 for EVs, while in France and Germany subsidies of up to EUR 8 000 and EUR 6 750 were available, respectively. However, subsidies for EVs are a costly measure, and many countries, especially those in the developing world, may not be able to afford them. The state of Gujarat in India is one of few examples of EV subsidies in the developing world for cars, two and three wheelers (First Post, 2021).\n\nRapid electrification of two- and three-wheelers in developing and emerging markets provides affordable clean transport options and maximises synergies with environment and livelihood. Key measures include fiscal and financial incentives, and standardisation. Examples of this can be found in China, India, Kenya and Rwanda.\n\nSubnational authorities also have an important role to play. For example, Athens, Madrid and Mexico City have decided to ban petrol- and diesel-powered cars by 2025, and Paris aims to do so by 2030 (IRENA, 2021b). Cities can also transition to zero-emission mobility through public procurement of electric buses for public transit operators and municipal fleets. In China, for example, the ministries of transport, finance, and industry and information technology jointly promulgated a rule in 2015 that requires all-electric buses to represent 80% of all additions and replacements in ten cities and provinces, including Beijing. In Europe, Oslo, Trondheim and Gothenburg have also deployed electric buses. In Latin America, Chile’s capital, Santiago, deployed 100 electric buses at the end of 2018, with the number reaching almost 800 by the end of 2020. Colombia considered replacing 75% of all public buses in Bogotá and Medellín with zero-emission vehicles by 2040 (IRENA, 2021b).\n\nMunicipal governments have several policy options to promote ZEVs for urban transport. City-level lowand zero-emission zones can support the transition by deterring people from purchasing fossil fuel-based cars and motivating them to use public transit modes (buses, trams, light rail and subways). London, United Kingdom, provides a leading example on low-emission zones, which have also been adopted by hundreds of other European cities. Numerous cities including Milan (Italy), Stockholm (Sweden), Singapore, Tehran (Islamic Republic of Iran) and Washington, DC (United States) have implemented congestion pricing for urban areas. Some cities, especially Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou in China, have adopted vehicle quotas through auctions or lottery systems. Similarly, Mexico City (Mexico), Delhi (India) and Jakarta (Indonesia) have adopted license plate restrictions with preferential policies on EVs to encourage EV deployment.\n\nA wide range of policies will be needed to support adoption of EVs\n\nGovernments can promote EV charging infrastructure through mandates and incentives. They can make cable availability for EV charging a necessity for newly constructed and renovated buildings or require the installation of specific percentages of EV chargers in public or business car parks. With the EV stock growing in some markets and cities, “smart” charging systems have become critical to prevent adverse impacts on power grids and harness the potential grid flexibility service that EVs can provide to the power system. Policy makers should therefore consider smart charging policies as part of transport transition measures, which have been adopted in the United Kingdom (mandating Open Charge Point Protocol compliance from 2022), Belgium and Luxembourg.\n\nTo achieve a just transition for the vehicle industry, governments and companies must provide retraining and recertification programmes for ICE industry workers, including social protection for the affected workers and communities to cope with a potentially lengthy and difficult transition period.\n\nIn the short and medium term, policies to increase the biofuel-fossil diesel and biofuel-gasoline blending ratio will be needed to decarbonise ICE stocks and promote biomethane use for transport in some countries. Key policies include blending mandates and renewable fuel standards, which have been adopted in the United States, Brazil, Indonesia and many other countries. However, policies must ensure sustainable biofuel feedstock and production processes through targets integrating sustainability, cross-sectoral co-ordination, regulations and certifications. The EU’s sustainability criteria in the renewable energy directive and Brazil’s RenovaBio provide some examples.\n\nShipping decarbonisation will need effective international measures to succeed\n\nRailway decarbonisation will mainly rely on electrification through renewable projects or procurement of renewable electricity. In India, the central-government-owned Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has been using solar PV rooftops since 2014 to provide renewable electricity to the system. The company signed a power purchase agreement with the state government of Madhya Pradesh to procure more solar PV electricity for the system (IRENA and GIZ, 2018).\n\nPolicies for aviation\n\nTargets for the use of SAFs remain the most important policy for aviation decarbonisation. The aviation industry, through the International Air Transport Association (IATA), has adopted a target to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 in support of the Paris Agreement goal. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) also adopted two global aspirational goals for the international aviation sector, which include 2% annual fuel efficiency improvement through 2050 and carbon-neutral growth from 2020 onwards, as established at the 37th Assembly in 2010 (ICAO, 2022). The ReFuelEU Aviation proposal mandates fuel suppliers to include SAFs in aviation fuel supplied at EU airports, starting at 2% SAFs in 2025, and increasing gradually to 5% in 2030. The targets will increase more rapidly to 20% in 2035, 32% in 2040 and 63% in 2050. The proposal also includes a sub-obligation of 0.7% for e-kerosene from 2030 (European Commission, 2021b).\n\nBlending mandates for aviation can help to create markets, but if they are for SAFs in general, then quotas might be fulfilled with biofuels instead of promoting synthetic fuels. Six European countries have adopted blending targets for SAFs, with the Scandinavian countries leading the way. Mandating policies can specify a gradually increasing share of sustainable renewable fuels for aviation, before reaching 100% renewable fuels by 2050.\n\nPolicies for shipping\n\nShipping decarbonisation will mainly rely on international measures for emissions reduction in international shipping. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) can play a role in setting sectoral decarbonisation targets and strategies and promoting its wide adoption by industries and countries. In 2018, the IMO adopted a strategy to reduce shipping sector GHG emissions, which sets quantitative carbon intensity and GHG reduction targets for international shipping, including at least 40% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030 and efforts towards 70% reduction by 2050, both compared with 2008 levels. It also aims to peak GHG emissions from international shipping as soon as possible and reduce them by at least 50% by 2050 compared with 2008 levels, while pursuing efforts towards phasing them out consistent with the temperature goals in the Paris Agreement (IMO, 2018).\n\nIMO’s strategy adopted enabling measures to align national actions with international targets, including supporting the development and update of national action plans; encouraging ports to facilitate GHG reductions from shipping; initiating and co-ordinating R&D activities by establishing an International Maritime Research Board; pursuing zero-carbon or fossil-free fuels for the shipping sector and developing robust life cycle GHG/carbon intensity guidelines for alternative fuels; undertaking additional GHG emissions studies to inform policy decisions and estimate marginal abatement cost curves for each measure; and encouraging technical co-operation and capacity-building activities.\n\n3.2.1 Global energy transition investments: Long- and short-term priorities\n\nBetween now and 2050, USD 150 trillion in investments would be required under the 1.5°C Scenario\n\nTo achieve climate objectives, the energy transition requires more speed in renewable power and end-use generation, in electrification of end-use sectors and in better energy efficiency. A concomitant rise in capital spending would require an additional USD 47 trillion, for a total of USD 150 trillion in the 1.5°C Scenario, compared with USD 103 trillion under the Planned Energy Scenario (PES) (see Figure 3.1).\n\nIn the 1.5°C Scenario, investments of USD 150 trillion in transition technologies and infrastructure by 2050 amount to USD 5.3 trillion per year on average. Put another way, this is an additional USD 1.7 trillion per year compared with the Planned Energy Scenario.\n\nIn end-use sectors, investments in transition technologies amount to USD 73 trillion or about 47% of the total investment required by 2050. This includes investments in conservation and efficiency (USD 43 trillion), electrification (USD 16.6 trillion), production and direct use of renewable technologies (USD 6 trillion), green hydrogen (USD 4.7 trillion) and carbon removal (USD 3 trillion).\n\nCumulative investments in moving the power sector toward renewables would need a total of USD 61 trillion to be spent on renewable power generation capacity (USD 39 trillion) and enabling infrastructure for renewables i.e. power grids and flexibility (USD 22 trillion). Investment in fossil fuels supply would account for USD 12 trillion and investment in fossil fuel and nuclear power generation for USD 1.9 trillion and USD 1.6 trillion, respectively.\n\nAbout USD 1 trillion of average annual investments in coal- and oil-based fossil fuel technologies in the Planned Energy Scenario would be redirected towards transition technologies and infrastructure in the 1.5°C Scenario. Total redirected investments would total about USD 26 trillion over the period to 2050.\n\n3.2.2 Investment opportunities by sector and technology\n\nGlobal investment across all transition technologies reached a record high of USD 1.3 trillion in 2022 (section 3.3). Yet annual investment would need to more than quadruple to remain on the 1.5°C pathway. Table 3.1 explores the required annual investments for achieving the 1.5°C Scenario in various technologies and sectors, whilst the following section explores specific investment requirements in more detail (section 3.2.3).\n\nInvestment in the power sector would continue to increase in both the Planned Energy Scenario and the 1.5°C Scenario. This investment would be directed towards additional renewable power generation capacity, grid extension and resiliency, and other grid flexibility measures (from better renewable power generation forecasting to integrated demand-side flexibility and stationary battery storage). In the Planned Energy Scenario, annual average investment in renewable power generation capacity and power grids and flexibility is estimated at more than USD 1 trillion over period to 2050. Transforming the power sector under IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario would require an average of more than USD 2.2 trillion per year through 2050. A total of USD 61 trillion would be needed under the scenario – more than double the cumulative investment required under the Planned Energy Scenario (USD 28.5 trillion) until 2050. The increased investment is necessitated by higher demand stemming from widespread electrification, green hydrogen production and higher upfront capital costs for renewable capacity (compared to fossil fuels) and flexibility measures.\n\nUnder IRENA’s 1.5°C Scenario, investment in the power sector accounts for 43% of total investment over the outlook period. By 2050, annual investment needs in renewable power generation technology would reach almost USD 1.4 trillion per year, while the annual average investment needs in grids and system flexibility is estimated to need to reach USD 0.8 trillion per year. This investment must be fully integrated and co-ordinated to ensure that when power generation projects are commissioned, they can meaningfully be integrated into the system and both their value and utility to the system maximised to deliver a reliable power system.\n\nRenewable energy technologies such as solar and wind attract the largest share of investment. From now until 2050, Solar PV (rooftop and utility scale) would draw an annual average investment of USD 333 billion, onshore wind would require an annual average investment of USD 356 billion, and offshore wind would require annual deployment of USD 283 billion. An annual increase in investment of 2.6, 3.7, and 5 times in solar PV, onshore and offshore wind, respectively, over 2021 would be required.\n\nInvestment also needs to be scaled up in other renewable power technologies. This includes over USD 400 billion annually until 2050 in a range of technologies including hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal, solar thermal and ocean technologies.\n\nIn the buildings sector, cumulative investments over the period 2023-2050 would exceed USD 34 trillion, which represents about 23% of the total transition investments towards 2050 under the 1.5°C Scenario. Energy efficiency accounts for the largest share, reaching 77% followed by investment in heat pumps (17%), and use of other renewables (largely solar thermal) for the remainder 6%. This represents hikes in annual investment in heat pumps and energy efficiency of 2.1 and 3.7 times, respectively, compared with previous years.\n\nIn the transport sector, investments would rise to USD 15 trillion to 2050 (11% of total transition-related investment). Electric charging infrastructure would account for 58% of the total and its development would be key for the ramping up of the electric vehicle’s adoption. Energy efficiency would represent 27%, support for transport electrification 9% and hydrogen stations and bunkering facilities the remaining 5%. An annual investment increase of 39 times in charging infrastructure compared with previous years would be required.\n\nInvestments in the industry sector are focused on energy efficiency and conservation measures (implementation of best available technology and processes based on new carriers). Cumulative investments under the 1.5°C Scenario are estimated at about USD 12 trillion between 2023 and 2050, double the levels under the Planned Energy Scenario. Other efforts in the sector involve carbon removal infrastructure – carbon capture and storage (CCS) and bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) – with cumulative investments estimated at USD 2.2 trillion, deployment of other renewables-based technologies (i.e. biomass, geothermal and solar thermal) estimated at USD 0.7 trillion, bio-based ammonia and methanol at USD 0.7 trillion, circular economy measures at USD 0.5 trillion and use of heat pumps at USD 0.06 trillion.\n\nWhen focusing on other types of energy supply, it is imperative to note the importance of expanding and broadening biomass supply chains while ensuring their sustainability and enhancing and scaling up conversion technologies. Meanwhile, hydrogen production and infrastructure would need to be scaled considerably.\n\nBioenergy investments would rise to USD 6.2 trillion by 2050 (5% of total transition-related investment), most of it for bioenergy-based power generation capacity (USD 2.6 trillion) and to increase biofuels supply (USD 2.4 trillion). The remainder would be needed to produce ammonia and methanol from biomass (USD 0.7 trillion), deploy bio-based plastics and organic materials (USD 0.3 trillion) as part of circular economy practices and facilitate the direct use of bioenergy in end-use sectors (USD 0.2 trillion).\n\nInvestments in electrolysers to produce green hydrogen, hydrogen supply infrastructure and renewablesbased hydrogen feedstocks for chemical production would amount to USD 170 billion per year on average through 2050. Due to the early stage of development of green hydrogen, supply chain investments of USD 5 billion per gigawatt (GW) of supply would be required.\n\n3.2.3 Investments in physical infrastructure enhancements for the transition\n\nRequired enhancements in power grids to scale up renewables\n\nAs the world transitions towards a 1.5°C emissions pathway, the integration of renewable sources into the power grid becomes more and more vital. But power grids present a challenge for renewables, as the grids were designed to accommodate large, centralised dispatchable power plants. To facilitate the integration of renewables, power grids would require a range of enhancements. These include investments in management and control systems able to accommodate distributed power generation. Upgraded transmission and distribution infrastructure could handle the increased capacity needs and bi-directional flows of power. Furthermore, the adoption of smart grids and the use of advanced analytics would optimise operations and improve system reliability. In the 1.5°C Scenario, these investments in networks cumulatively amount to USD 22.4 trillion to 2050. Roughly 80% of this investment would expand the electricity grid; the remaining 20% would go to flexibility measures, like storage. With enhancements, power grids can accommodate renewables and present a resilient, flexible and sustainable energy system.\n\nGreen"
