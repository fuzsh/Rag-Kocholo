Until We Meet Again!!) is the 134th episode of the Pokémon anime. It was first broadcast in Japan on February 10, 2000, and in the United States on February 3, 2001.\n\nBlurb\n\nWhen Ash hears of the nearby Charicific Valley, he is sure a quick trip would be just the thing to reignite his Charizard's flagging spirits. When they reach the valley, though, they find its dragon denizens anything but cordial. Judged weak, and denied entrance to the valley, Charizard is left more dejected than ever.\n\nPlot\n\nA fatigued Ash and his friends hike along a path, followed by a similarly fatigued Team Rocket. Jessie contemplates abandoning the trio's quest to capture Pikachu, while James mentions how many Pokémon Ash's friends have compared to them, using Ash's Charizard as an example. As they walk, Ash mentions that with Pikachu and Charizard by his side, he could beat any opponent, but his friends mention that he uses Charizard excessively, making it unfair for opponents. The group overhears a faint echo, so Brock decides to respond. A woman calls over to them from atop a cliff and introduces herself as Liza, the caretaker of the Charicific Valley. Liza knows that Ash has a Charizard by the faint scent on him and reveals that she knows him because of his victory at the Violet Gym, before inviting the group to visit the valley.\n\nLiza calls out Charla, a female Charizard that helps transport Liza, Misty, and Brock in a balloon. There isn't enough room for Ash, but Liza suggests that he fly on his Charizard. Charla takes off as Ash asks how to ride, which stuns Liza that he had never flown on a Charizard. Ash summons his Charizard and requests a ride; he refuses at first, but Liza's taunt motivates Charizard to try. Ash and Pikachu hop on Charizard as he stomps and flies off, but he accidentally leaves them behind. After getting them back on, Charizard unsteadily and furiously flies with them onboard. Meanwhile, Liza mentions that the Charizard in the valley are wild, except for Charla. Ash and Charizard catch up, but Charla speeds forward, angering Charizard. Meanwhile, Team Rocket slides down a mountain hill towards the valley.\n\nAs Liza, Misty, and Brock reach the Charicific Valley, Liza mentions its history and how the Charizard train naturally without humans by battling each other, with the intense competition making them the strongest worldwide. Misty thinks that it would be too intense for Ash's Charizard, but Charizard tries to prove their strength. However, Charla and Liza note that only weak Charizard show off, suggesting that he needs training. Charizard fires a Flamethrower to disprove this, but he briefly sets Ash on fire while he takes her comments as an insult. Ash demands to have a battle with Liza using Charla, but she mentions that she raised her since she was a Charmander. As a result, Ash and Charizard want to battle the ones in the valley, so Liza shows them all of the other Charizard, leaving them stunned at their larger size. One larger Charizard walks by and Liza points out that if Ash's Charizard can defeat it, he may qualify to join.\n\nCharizard marches up behind it and hits it in the face with Flamethrower. However, the wild Charizard inhales the attack and retaliates with its own, leaving Ash's own Charizard burnt, and he collapses. Charizard gets back up and shakes off the dust as Liza points to one sleeping, mentioning that despite it being larger than Ash's, it is still the gentlest of the Charizard. Charizard confronts that one and fires another Flamethrower, but the wild Charizard hardly reacts and simply lashes its tail, tossing Charizard into a wall. Ash tries to console Charizard, stating that he will always be good enough for him. Charizard refuses to listen and tries to attack again, but another lash from the gentle Charizard knocks him down. Despite the pleas of Ash and the others, Charizard persists but continues to get beaten, eventually getting kicked out of the valley. Charizard struggles to climb up the stairs, but Liza kicks the whole group out of the valley and closes the gates, telling them to return after some training.\n\nTeam Rocket, watching from a distance, realizes they cannot capture any of the Charizard in the valley because they were easily able to beat Ash's Charizard, who always beats them, while the mecha that they bought is inadequate, hence why Jessie names it a \"Gigantic Mistake\". Meanwhile, after Charizard repeatedly beats the gates, Liza reopens them and repeats her instructions, but Charizard stubbornly refuses. Liza allows Charla to attack, and Charizard is tossed into a lake. Liza tells Charizard to stay put and reflect before closing the gates again. When night falls, Misty notes that Charizard has stayed in place since that afternoon. Ash wants to leave, but Charizard doesn't budge. Team Rocket watches as Meowth translates Charizard's thoughts about wanting to be stronger. Throughout the night, Ash and his friends fall asleep, but Team Rocket tosses rocks at Charizard to keep him awake and prevent his flame from dying out. Through the gates, Liza and Charla realize how determined Charizard is to get in.\n\nThe next morning, Ash wakes up and sees Charizard still sitting in place. Just then, Team Rocket's mecha shows up and rolls up to the gates, attempting to break in. Charizard confronts the mecha and hits it with Flamethrower, causing it to explode and send Team Rocket blasting off, just as the trio had planned. The gates open, revealing an applauding Liza, who invites Charizard in, explaining that he finally proved that he wants to enter. Shocking his friends, Ash coldly tells Charizard that he should stay in the valley if he wants to, and then adds that he doesn't want a weak Charizard anyway. Ash starts to walk away and points to the valley, telling Charizard that he has a lot to learn there. Then, out of fear that he might change his mind, Ash starts running away, followed by Misty and Brock. Pikachu briefly remains to bid Charizard farewell before following the group as well. As Ash runs, tears stream down his face as he silently hopes that Charizard will train as hard as he can in the Charicific Valley and that Charizard won't forget him. Charizard bids his Trainer farewell by roaring and firing a Flamethrower into the sky as Ash, knowing that he can't look back, keeps running.\n\nMajor events\n\nAsh leaves his Charizard to train at the Charicific Valley.\n\nFor a list of all major events in the anime, please see the history page.\n\nDebuts\n\nHumans\n\nLiza\n\nPokémon debuts\n\nCharla\n\nCharacters\n\nHumans\n\nAsh\n\nMisty\n\nBrock\n\nJessie\n\nJames\n\nLiza\n\nPokémon\n\nWho's That Pokémon?: Sunflora (US and international), Charizard (Japan)\n\nPikachu (Ash's)\n\nMeowth (Team Rocket)\n\nTogepi (Misty's)\n\nBulbasaur (Ash's; fantasy)\n\nCharizard (Ash's; leaves)\n\nSquirtle (Ash's; fantasy)\n\nSnorlax (Ash's; fantasy)\n\nHeracross (Ash's; fantasy)\n\nChikorita (Ash's; fantasy)\n\nGoldeen (Misty's; fantasy)\n\nStaryu (Misty's; fantasy)\n\nPsyduck (Misty's; fantasy)\n\nPoliwag (Misty's; fantasy)\n\nOnix (Brock's; fantasy)\n\nGeodude (Brock's; fantasy)\n\nZubat (Brock's; fantasy)\n\nVulpix (Brock's; fantasy)\n\nArbok (Jessie's; fantasy)\n\nLickitung (Jessie's; fantasy)\n\nWeezing (James's; fantasy)\n\nVictreebel (James's; fantasy)\n\nCharizard (Liza's; Charla)\n\nCharizard (multiple)\n\nTrivia\n\nThis was chosen by Shōko Nakagawa as the sixth episode of Pocket Monsters Premier 10.\n\nCharizard's tail is completely submerged in the water, but the flame was unharmed. This also happened when he was a Charmander in Island of the Giant Pokémon.\n\nThis episode is featured on Volume 3: Charizard from VIZ Media's Pokémon All-Stars series.\n\nThis is one of the few episodes where Team Rocket actually wants to get sent blasting off. They help Charizard become stronger by allowing him to blow up a Team Rocket mecha which they used to break into the Charicific Valley.\n\nTeam Rocket doesn't recite their motto in this episode.\n\nHowever, the motto theme is played when Team Rocket attacks the valley with their mecha.\n\nNot counting the Pokémon seen in James's thoughts, the only Generation II Pokémon to appear in this episode is Togepi.\n\nTeam Rocket's mecha in this episode resembles a Bug Catcher.\n\nThis episode was partially adapted into the book All Fired Up.\n\nMusic from Mewtwo Strikes Back was used in this episode.\n\nCharizard is confirmed to be male in this episode, as both Jessie and James refer to him as such in the Japanese version.\n\nParts of this episode were reanimated and used for flashback material for The Fires of a Red-Hot Reunion!.\n\nA shot of this episode was remade and reused in a flashback in Alola, Kanto!.\n\nErrors\n\nIn Charizard Chills, Charizard is capable of carrying Ash without any trouble, while in this episode, he struggles with his weight.\n\nWhen James counts the Pokémon of Ash and his friends, a picture of all of them is shown. Snorlax is also pictured, even though it is back at Professor Oak's Laboratory at the time.\n\nIn the English dub:\n\nThe voiceover in the title card incorrectly refers to this episode as Charizard's Burning Ambition.\n\nAsh says that he has not ridden Charizard before; however, this is not true, as he rode on Charizard in both Attack of the Prehistoric Pokémon and Charizard Chills. He never said this in the Japanese version.\n\nTechnically, the moment in Attack of the Prehistoric Pokémon doesn't really count as Ash riding Charizard, as it wasn't intentional. Additionally, both Charizard and Ash were half-asleep from Jigglypuff's singing, so they may not remember it.\n\nThe initial dialogue between Liza, Brock, and Ash was changed completely; this included changing Liza from calling for Charizard in general to calling for Charla. This creates an error since multiple Flamethrowers emerge from behind the mountains as a response to her call, which couldn't have been produced by one Charizard.\n\nLiza refers to Misty by her name despite nobody ever telling her that name. In the Japanese version, Liza never refers to Ash, Misty, and Brock by their name.\n\nWhen Team Rocket blasts off, their mouths move, but no sound comes out.\n\nDub edits\n\nPokémon Karaokémon: Song of Jigglypuff\n\nA closeup shot of Ash's Charizard being hit very hard by a wild Charizard and sent flying into the top part of the entrance to the Valley with its tail was cut and replaced with an impact animation.\n\nCharla being evolved from a Charmander was not present in the original Japanese dialogue.\n\nSeveral scenes of dialogue involving Team Rocket are changed in the English dub:\n\nIn the Japanese version, Jessie breaks the fourth wall by telling Meowth their problem is that they are going up against the increasingly popular Pikachu. Meowth denies this by saying that their lack of strength, not popularity, is their problem. The dub changes this to Jessie suggesting that they should pick on somebody else for a change.\n\nIn the Japanese version, James counts the Pokémon of Ash's friends but trails off by the time he reaches number seven. In the dub, he doesn't trail off and stops at twelve, which is wrong as, counting Snorlax, there are a total of sixteen Pokémon.\n\nIn the Japanese version, Team Rocket once again breaks the fourth wall by talking about how popular Charizard is and how it's just too powerful for them to defeat. They gather together at the end and declare Charizard \"unfair\". The dub changes this to them wondering what the Boss would say if he knew how afraid they are of Charizard.\n\nSeveral scenes of dialogue involving Liza are also changed in the English dub:\n\nIn the Japanese version, Liza says that the Charizard in the Valley are seen as the guardian deities of the area. The dub changes this to Liza saying that it was \"a place where Charizard have lived in peace for thousands of years\" and an \"ancient place where the greatest Charizard in Pokémon history have come from\". Later, Liza says that \"the Charizard in the Valley turn out to be the best in the whole world\", which was also never said in the Japanese version.\n\nWhile Liza just warns Ash that shooting out fire randomly is dangerous and could get him burned in the Japanese version, she instead states \"only weak Charizard show off like that\" in the dub.\n\nIn the dub, Liza tells Ash that \"she can't be responsible for what happens if Charizard continues to fight\", while in the Japanese version, she tells that \"she understands how Ash's Pokémon feel but that it really is no use for it to continue like that\".\n\nIn the dub, Liza says to Ash's Charizard that \"he will never be a great Charizard if he acts tough and doesn't respect his own limitations\". However, in the Japanese version, Liza tells Ash that Charizard will be okay as long as the flame on his tail doesn't go out, which is the reason a lot of close-up shots happen throughout the rest of the episode.\n\nIn the Japanese version, James never says that the mecha was purchased online.\n\nIn other languages\n\nLanguage Title Arabic طموحات تشاريزارد Bulgarian Горящите цели на Чаризард Mandarin Chinese 噴火龍山谷，直到下次重逢 Czech Charizardovy plamenné ambice Dutch Charizards Brandende Verlangen Finnish Charizardin tulikoe European French La séparation German Herausforderung für Glurak Hebrew תשוקתו של צ'ריזארדtshukato shel Charizard Hindi Charizard की अग्नि-परीक्षा Charizard ki Agni-Pariksha * Hungarian Charizard harca Italian La valle dei draghi*\n\nLe brucianti ambizioni di Charizard* Polish Płonąca ambicja Charizarda Portuguese Brazil O Desejo Ardente de Charizard Portugal As Ambições Calorosas do Charizard' Romanian Ambițiile Arzânde a lui Charizard Spanish Latin America ¡La gran ambición de Charizard!
