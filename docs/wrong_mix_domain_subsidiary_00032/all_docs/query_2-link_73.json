Visit our alerts dashboard to learn more.\n\nVisit siouxfalls.gov/alerts\n\nWhy we spray\n\nThe Mosquito Control Program limits harmful mosquitos that spread viruses like West Nile. South Dakota is the number one hotspot for West Nile in the United States.\n\nTrucks spray low-concentration products in the air, reducing the number of harmful mosquitoes. This allows residents to safely enjoy the outdoors.\n\nWhen we spray\n\nThe Mosquito Control Program monitors the population of harmful mosquitoes. Mosquitos are trapped and tested each weekday. We spray a zone or city-wide if enough harmful mosquitos are found.\n\nTo learn what zone you are in, use our Interactive Spray Zone Map. Sign up for text alerts so you know when we are spraying in your Zone.\n\nWe spray at night when the mosquitoes are out, unless it is too cool, too windy or raining. Recreational trails may be sprayed in the evening or morning hours, as mosquito activity is at its peak at dawn and dusk.\n\nThe products used in our sprays are specifically formulated for mosquito control purposes and have been proven to present low-risk to people, pets, and the environment. If you have a medical sensitivity or wish to avoid the trucks, please sign up for text alerts so that you can make personal decisions during our control efforts.\n\nAbout the sprays\n\nThe Mosquito Control Program uses safe, industry-tested products. We use the smallest amount of chemicals necessary. The active ingredients are less than a fraction of a raindrop per square foot. The Environmental Protection Agency evaluates our sprays to ensure they do not pose a risk to our community.\n\nIf you have questions, read our FAQs or call our Mosquito Control Program at 605-367-8284.\n\nMosquito Sprayings\n\nRecreation trail spraying\n\nThe City of Sioux Falls Mosquito Control Program aims to spray the recreational trails 1 to 2 times a week throughout the summer, as weather conditions allow. These spray efforts will occur in the morning hours between 3 to 7 a.m.\n\nFind your spray zone"
