        "text": "As cooling temperatures hint at the arrival of the fall season in Bellevue, Washington, there’s no better time to visit some of the city’s celebrated bars and restaurants for steamy entrées and smoky beverages for a warming lift. Bellevue’s diverse dining scene hosts an array of enticing options, from innovative cocktails enveloped in a cloud of smoke to delectable dishes that will delight the eye as well as the palate with their misty presentations.\n\nCivility & Unrest\n\nA Tale as Old as Time cocktail\n\nDrawing inspiration from the timeless tale of Beauty and the Beast, Civility & Unrest’s innovative A Tale as Old as Time cocktail utilizes smoke to take an already dramatic concoction to a whole new level. This libation blends the tanginess of passion fruit and lime juices with a gently sweet chamomile-citrus simple syrup, along with whiskey, bitters, and a top layer of whipped egg white foam. The addition of squid ink discreetly conceals this otherwise vibrant flavor profile, creating an element of surprise. As a nod to the classic tale, a single dried rose petal is added as the cocktail’s final layer. Once shaken together, the drink is then placed in a smoked-filled cloche, which further adds to the enchanting experience.\n\nGo behind the scenes! Join Visit Bellevue’s dining and nightlife ambassador Nelson Yong on The Vue as he visits Civility and Unrest to see how they craft of some of their unique cocktails.\n\nCantina Monarca\n\nCadillac Fog cocktail\n\nCantina Monarca is another restaurant that excels in using scented fog to create mesmerizing presentations, showcased perfectly in one of their signature cocktails — the Cadillac Fog. This margarita-esque creation contains one of Cantina Monarca’s specialty tequilas blended with a tangy citrus base and topped with a Grandeza orange liqueur float. For a touch of theatrical flare, the Grandeza liqueur is also poured into a beaker containing dry ice, and as the fog gracefully ascends, it co-mingles with the drink to create a visual spectacle that unites the flavors and delights the senses.\n\nGet a glimpse into the flavors that await. On this episode of The Vue, Nelson takes us through the grandeur of Cantina Monarca that transports you to a Tulum-inspired paradise.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Cantina Monarca\n\nPeony Kitchen\n\nTea Smoked Chicken\n\nSmoke isn’t just used to enhance the flavor of cocktails, but also of food. At Peony Kitchen, the Tea Smoked Chicken undergoes a fascinating flavor and texture transformation through the use of tea-infused smoke. A blend of traditional recipes and innovative techniques, the chicken is infused with tea leaves, grilled, and presented whole and encased within a dome of fragrant smoke. This captivating presentation not only preserves the essence of smokiness but also provides a tantalizing aroma that heightens the anticipation for that first delicious bite. Paired with a ginger-scallion aioli, this dish imparts a burst of flavors that linger long after the meal is over.\n\nThird Culture Coffee\n\nCoffee\n\nIndulge in Third Culture Coffee’s globally inspired brews, where each steamy sip transports you to another land. Rooted in Indian influences, this cafe is dedicated to sharing the art of coffee from around the world, expertly crafting beverages that pay homage to the traditional origins they come from. A decadent French drinking chocolate, an espresso and condensed milk Spanish rendition, and a range of imported teas are just a few of the piping hot items on the menu that beautifully showcase its diversity. Driven by a mission to champion inclusion through the use of health-conscious and sustainable products, this cafe is working to unite individuals from various backgrounds while also providing you with a jolt of steamy indulgence to brighten your day."
