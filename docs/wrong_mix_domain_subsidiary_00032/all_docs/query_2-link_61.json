        "text": "Is it possible to combine a no-code website builder with a CRM, a tool that helps you collect payments, and improve your SEO and email marketing at the same time?\n\nWix says it’s possible!\n\nThe Wix Ascend is a set of tools that do just that and more. Ascend by Wix is available for all Wix users for an additional fee or for free with limited capabilities and options.\n\nIn this article, you’ll learn exactly what Wix Ascend is, how it may help you in selling your products or services through Wix, how much it costs, and in which scenarios is it worth considering.\n\nLet’s get to it.\n\nWhat Is Wix Ascend?\n\nWix Ascend is a set of tools that help to further improve your Wix website, available for an additional fee on top of your regular Wix cost and subscription.\n\nAscend by Wix combines customer management with customer service tools, such as a support live chat, invoices, quotes, email marketing and SEO tools, marketing integrations, and more.\n\nTaking into account all that Wix Ascend can do, we can’t help, but realize that it very much resembles a CRM. Many of which we have already discussed, analyzed, and compared to each other on our blog, e.g., Studio vs HoneyBook, Tave vs HoneyBook, or Plutio vs Suitedash.\n\nWix Ascend Plans\n\nAscend by Wix pricing comes down to four plans in total, out of which, the first one is free to use.\n\nHow Much Does Wix Ascend Cost?\n\nWix Ascend costs either nothing or $10, $24, $49 respectively for each Ascend by Wix paid plan.\n\nSo the yearly cost of adding Ascend on top of your regular Wix account subscription is:\n\nBasic: $120\n\nProfessional: $288\n\nUnlimited: $588\n\nWhat You Get: Wix Ascend Features\n\nAscend by Wix offers many different features.\n\nSo it may feel like a complicated maze that’s very easy to get lost in, especially for new users or those of us who haven’t had much experience with CRMs or similar tools yet.\n\nAnd that’s why after testing Ascend by Wix possibilities, we’ve decided to group its features into 4 main categories that will help us move around the platform a bit better and evaluate its true worth.\n\nSo, without further ado, here is an overview of what you can expect from Wix Ascend!\n\nSelling Services and Products\n\nIf you decide to use Ascend by Wix on your Wix site, you can take advantage of the possibility to create and sell services, as well as physical and digital products.\n\nThe catch here is that only Wix premium plan users can actually collect payments through Wix. The free version of Wix Ascend lets you only create the services or products you’d wish to sell.\n\nWhen it comes to the whole process of adding a new product or service, it’s all pretty simple. Everything seems to be in one place, descriptions, images, adding prices, adding a subscription option, coupons, and more.\n\nAscend by Wix tops it all off with a few unique features, such as the possibility to sell gift cards for your products and services, a loyalty program your clients can join, or their back-in-store requests.\n\nWhen it comes to collecting payments, paid plans’ users can connect their PayPal, Stripe, or use the manual payments option to accept payments in cash, check, or any other form of payment.\n\nYou can also create quotes and invoices if you wish to offer more custom-made services or products.\n\nBut the things that came as a bit unintuitive in this category were the quotes, invoices, and tax settings, whereas the creation of services and products was quite simple, even though a bit extensive.\n\nAnd if you take your time with the tool, you’ll find that any item you add anywhere in the software is automatically remembered by it. Meaning that you can then choose it from a dropdown list the next time you create, for example, a quote.\n\nCRM\n\nComing straight to the next category of features offered by Wix Ascend, CRM.\n\nUnfortunately, this category leaves a spacious room for improvement by Wix creators to fill and you’ll have to bear with us, because we’re going to nag a little bit here and there.\n\nTo the point.\n\nWix CRM can be divided into Contacts, Communication, Tasks & Reminders, Workflows & Automations, and Forms.\n\nThe Contacts tab is pretty simple, basically letting you add clients and teammates and collect their details. You can then use that information to send the created Wix invoices and quotes to your clients. You can also assign other team members to clients.\n\nCommunication with clients is mainly performed through either a live chat that you can connect via available integrations or by sending your clients emails.\n\nTasks & Reminders are pretty much just as simple. All you can do is add new tasks, set a due date, and connect the created tasks with clients. You can then view all your tasks and filter them by either to-do or completed ones.\n\nWorkflows on the other hand are a bit more complicated, but that doesn’t really do Wix Ascend any favors. We didn’t necessarily understand the purpose of Ascend’s workflows at first glance.\n\nSo, Wix workflows work based on Trello-like cards with different stages of the project. You can add a Card, add an Automation, or Send Email Campaign in each one. And here’s the thing that was the most unintuitive, adding a Card means you’re adding a Contact. Which in itself is pretty pointless.\n\nBut, it turns out that you can actually click on the specific cards you add and clicking on them reveals a lot. Namely, workflows, tasks, contact info, attachments, subscriptions, badges, labels, or notes. Meaning that you can track many details about your clients and leads throughout the different stages of the project. The tab that pops up is also customizable. But getting there was no fun.\n\nAutomations, on the other hand, can either be connected with workflows or serve as a standalone feature. The automations are pretty extensive and there’s great potential in this particular functionality. For example, you can set automatic chat messages to clients based on the triggers you specify. Unfortunately, the automations in Wix Ascend for now are pretty unintuitive.\n\nAnd last but not least, we want to mention the creation of Forms in Ascend by Wix. The form creators are pretty cool, but users on the free Ascend plan can just window-shop some of the functionalities, such as adding a file upload, file download, or a signature field to their forms. There’s also a limitation on the forms you can create (even on two of the paid plans) and the number of fields you can add to each form.\n\nBut if you’re not that demanding, you’ll get a nice, simple form creator with different templates you can use.\n\nThe whole CRM category is for now a bit too simple or in more advanced features, unintuitive.\n\nMarketing & SEO\n\nNow, after the sorrows and shortcomings of the CRM offered by Wix Ascend, we’re diving into, in our opinion, its best category of features, Marketing & SEO.\n\nWe won’t go into every little feature, because this category is quite big. But, we have to mention a few things that really caught our attention in a good way.\n\nThe first one is the Wix email marketing feature. Ascend by Wix lets you easily create professional-looking email marketing campaigns, customize them to your liking, work on many nice templates, and send those emails to your contacts. The only con would be the fact that email scheduling is reserved for paid users only.\n\nBut the outcome is pretty cool and the whole process was very much intuitive for a change.\n\nNext up, we have the social media marketing and Wix video maker features. This time, what won us over were the templates. So. Many. Templates.\n\nAnd it’s so easy to customize them to your specific needs and then share those creations directly on social media or simply download them and post wherever you want.\n\nAscend by Wix definitely knows how to make the creative work easier!\n\nIntegrations\n\nAnother worth-noting thing about Wix Ascend is the amount of integrations it comes with.\n\nFrom marketing and SEO integrations, such as Google Search Console, Google Analytics, through the Wix ads integrations, including Google Ads, Facebook Ads, financial integrations, like QuickBooks, Xero, or Open Payout, to different booking applications and live chats.\n\nThere’s a potential to make Wix Ascend your business hub if you take a look at just how much Wix app market offers.\n\nWix Ascend Pros and Cons\n\nHaving moved around Wix Ascend, we can now craft a pros to cons ratio for anyone interested in this particular software.\n\nPros\n\nIf you already have a website built with Wix, it can give you even more possibilities\n\nMarketing features are pretty neat\n\nThere are a lot of great templates to use\n\nYou can also download the Wix mobile app (Wix Owner app) for easy access to your site and tools\n\nCons\n\nSteep learning curve\n\nToo many features to get a grip of\n\nA bit unintuitive\n\nOnly available on Wix sites and for Wix users\n\nCRM features not that great just yet\n\nNo client portal\n\nIt’s difficult to find relevant information about Wix Ascend pricing\n\nBecause the tool has this many features, it’s sometimes a bit slow\n\nAre There Better Options?\n\nThe question of whether there are better options than Wix Ascend out there is actually quite difficult to answer. At the very least, the answer won’t be binary.\n\nBecause it very much depends on your preferences and needs.\n\nIf you’re after the marketing features and you already have a Wix subscription, using Wix Ascend is not a bad idea at all. You can even take advantage of the free Wix plan, so as not to spurge on the additional features.\n\nAlternative options that also combine marketing and CRM features usually come as pretty pricey, e.g., HubSpot that for the most basic kit costs around 45 EUR paid monthly or 27, 59 EUR when committing to an annual subscription. This tool also offers a limited free plan, but you might as well keep it simple and just use Wix Ascend to get basically the same features without the chaos of switching to yet another software.\n\nZendo\n\nBut if you’re more after a tool that makes it easy to sell your services, issue quotes and invoices, and contact your clients at the same time, you’ll find many more affordable options out there.\n\nOne such tool we want to mention particularly because of how well it combines useful features with affordable prices is Zendo.\n\nZendo is a fairly new tool on the market that’s been built around a simple to use chat that combines both client and team communication. It can easily serve as your main spot for selling services online and crafting them to be custom, productized or subscription-based.\n\nOn top of easily creating your services, you can also list them on a customizable Service Catalog to let your clients self-serve in ordering, and then deliver the services through Zendo as well.\n\nMoreover, you can work on customizable order forms with file uploads, collect payments, issue quotes and invoices, and update your clients’ orders with automatic and manual statuses sent via the chat!\n\nNot to mention its modern look that’ll make sure your clients see you as an absolute professional.\n\nAnd the best part is that your clients can also use Zendo to log in to your workspace, access any files shared with them, and get in touch with you and your team!\n\nThis tool also comes with some unique features, such as the Impersonation feature that lets you impersonate your clients or other team members. Whether that’s to check how the client portal looks from the client’s perspective or substitute an agent on leave to keep the customer’s journey smooth and consistent.\n\nZendo Pricing\n\nZendo is not a feature creep, it’s built for users who crave an easy to use tool. And its pricing definitely reflects that, because you have three straightforward plans:\n\nFree Starter: all the essential functionality to sell your services and communicate with your customers online. The Starter plan is dedicated for smaller teams of up to two agents that wish to take advantage of a modern client portal solution for free. This plan won’t cost you a penny.\n\nGrowth: the Growth plan comes with even more possibilities on top of the basic functionality. It will give you more automation options, unlimited access to subscriptions, and the possibility to whitelabel your client portal for the ultimate professionality. The Growth plan costs $19 per month, per agent when choosing annual billing or $23 per month, per agent if you decide to pay on a monthly basis.\n\nEnterprise: in case you’d wish to build something unique and have custom features, take advantage of the Enterprise plan that offers just that for a custom price based on your needs.\n\nWix Ascend Pricing And Costs In 2023: Final Verdict\n\nWix Ascend overall positively surprised us. We especially like its marketing-related features, such as the email campaign or the video creator.\n\nBut we are not really fond of its poor CRM possibilities and the limitations it puts on the free plan users. Moreover, this set of tools is only available to use for Wix users on Wix sites.\n\nTo conclude this analysis, we have to say that if you’re on the lookout for a good online marketing tools kit and you already have a Wix website, you should definitely try Wix Ascend, especially the free plan.\n\nBut if you long for something much more intuitive that doesn’t force you to work on a Wix website, and that focuses more on client communication and selling services online, then we’d suggest going for Zendo.\n\nYou can create and sell different type of services, collect payments, issue quotes and invoices, get in touch with clients, and offer your clients the possibility to log in and access their messages, requests, and files in one place, all and more.\n\nIf that sounds promising, try Zendo for free to see how it fits your business!\n\nKeep from $120 up to $588 in your pocket switching from Wix Ascend to Zendo and get a free, lifetime access to a modern client portal that makes it easy to sell your services.\n\nAnd if you want to jump in head first, go for the paid plan to gain even more, including subscriptions, the possibility to connect your own domain, remove Zendo branding, and gain even more automations to further ease your work life.\n\nWhatever you choose, we hope it’ll make your work-life balance much more, well, balanced!"
