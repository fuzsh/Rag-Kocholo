However, the image of direct selling is often marred by the unethical practices of the pyramid schemes. Because of the many complaints received from the consumers, the Government through the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs has seen the need to come out with a law to regulate the direct selling industry.\n\nAs a result, the Direct Sales Act 1993 was developed with 3 important objectives:\n\na)Regulate and promote ethical direct selling business.\n\nb)Protect the consumers.\n\nc)Ban all pyramid direct selling business.\n\nWith effect from 1 June 1993, all Distributors must comply with the requirements of the Direct Sales Act. Below are important details about the Act and some points that you should note as a Distributor.\n\n1.Companies incorporated under the Companies Act 1965 wishing to operate a direct sales business must now apply for a Direct Sales License.\n\n2.Authority Card Distributors involved with Direct Sales must have with them at all times the following:\n\n2.1National Registration Identification Card (I.C.)\n\n2.2An Authority Card with the following details:\n\na.Name and address of the Distributor.\n\nb.Name, address and telephone number of the Company issuing the Authority Card.\n\nc.Company authorised signature on the Authority Card issued by the Company.\n\nd.Direct Sales License number issued to the Company by the Ministry.\n\ne.Photograph of the Distributor with the following specifications:\n\ni)Size of photo is approximately 3.8 cm x 3.2 cm and must be without the white edges.\n\nii)Full face of the Distributor. The measurement from the chin to the top of the head must not be less than 2.54 cm (1 inch) in upright position.\n\niii)The photo must be taken without any head face coverings. Exemptions are given if the head covering is following religious or customary beliefs and provided that the headgear does not hide the main features of the face.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\ni)Please ensure that you show your I.C. and Authority Card every time you are conducting your business as well as during prospecting. It is an offence under the Direct Sales Act 1993 if you do not do so and an action can be taken against you as well as the Company by the Ministry of Domestic Trade & Consumer Affairs.\n\nCODE & ETHICS| 8\n\nii)If the customer requests you to leave his premises, please do so. Do not persist in trying to convince or push a sale. The customer has a right to make a complaint if you continue to insist that he listens to you. This is considered as applying high pressure sales and it is an offence under the Direct Sales Act.\n\niii)A new Authority Card as specified by the Government will be issued to all Distributors by the Company.\n\niv)You have to paste your photograph onto the Authority Card as soon as you have received it. Your photograph must be of the correct size and specifications as stipulated above.\n\nv)Printed copies of the “Direct Sales Contract” together with “Notice of Rescission” forms are available from ASCEND 1.\n\n3.HOURS OF CALL\n\nYou are not allowed to call on customers/prospects:\n\n3.1.On Sunday (in areas where Sunday is observed as a rest day).\n\n3.2.On Friday (in areas where Friday is observed as a rest day).\n\n3.3.On any public holidays.\n\n3.4.From 7.00 pm to 9.00 am daily on other days.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\ni)The above hours of call do not apply if you have made an appointment and the customer has consented for you to call on them.\n\nii)Distributors are strongly urged to always make appointments. Unless you have done so, do not attempt to conduct business at the prohibited hours ofcall.\n\n4.DIRECT SALES CONTRACT\n\nFor sales to end consumers valuing RM300.00 and above per transaction, a Direct Sales Contract is required.\n\n4.1.The Contract must be in writing.\n\n4.2.The Contract must be signed by both parties: the seller and the buyer. The buyer must be given a copy of the signed contract.\n\n4.3.The Contract must have a statement printed: “This contract is subject to a cooling-off period of 10 working days.”\n\n4.4.The details of product sold or services to be rendered must be specified.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\ni)Anything below RM300.00 per transaction does not require a Direct Sales Contract and is not subjected to the 10 working days cooling-off period.\n\n5.COOLING-OFF PERIOD\n\n5.1.Applies to products/services worth RM300.00 and above per transaction only. A cooling-off period of 10 working days after the date of the Direct Sales Contract is required to allow customers to change their minds about buying your products/services.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\ni)No delivery of products or services can be carried out during the cooling-off period.\n\nii)You are not allowed to receive any payment/down payment from the customer before the cooling-off period is over.\n\n6.DIRECT SALES CONTRACT TERMINATION\n\n6.1.During the 10 working days cooling-off period, a customer who has changed his mind can terminate the contract in writing by registered mail or by hand to the Distributor.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\ni)Rescission/Cancellation of the Direct Sales Contract is made via “Notice of Rescission.”\n\nii)A copy of the “Notice of Rescission” that states the customers’ rights to cancel must be given to the customer together upon signing any Direct Sales Contract (for transactions of RM300.00 and above).\n\n7.SHORTENING THE COOLING-OFF PERIOD OR NOTICE OF WAIVER\n\nA customer who requires the products or services earlier than the stipulated 10 working days can serve a Notice of Waiver to the Distributor who made the Direct Sales Contract with the customer after 72 hours has lapsed from the time the Direct Sales Contract was signed.\n\nCODE & ETHICS| 9\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\ni)Printed copies of the “Notice of Waiver” forms are available from ASCEND 1.\n\nii)It must be noted that the “Notice of Waiver” is only to be used at the request of the customer who wishes to obtain the products/services earlier than the cooling-off period of 10 working days but after 72 hours from the time the Direct Sales Contract was signed.\n\nThe penalties imposed for the offences under the Direct Sales Act are heavy and the negative publicity resulting from such offences will tarnish the good image of ASCEND 1 Distributors and the Company. The Company supports the Act which will weed out the pyramids and ensure fair play in the direct selling industry. The Act will in the long run provide a favorable environment for healthy growth in the direct selling industry. We strongly urge all Distributors to abide by the above Regulations.\n\nCODE & ETHICS| 10"
