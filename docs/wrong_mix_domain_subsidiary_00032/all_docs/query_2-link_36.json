        "text": "Cannes, June 27, 2024 â Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), today announced the promising results of the ASCEND (Advanced Space Cloud for European Net zero emission and Data sovereignty) feasibility study. Launched in 2023 and funded by the European Commission under the Horizon Europe program, this initiative aims to study the feasibility of space-based data centers to work toward the EU Green Dealâs objective of net-zero carbon by 2050 and transform the European space and digital ecosystem.\n\nFor this study, Thales Alenia Space coordinated a European consortium of partners with complementary expertise in environmental aspects (Carbone 4, VITO), cloud computing (Orange Business, CloudFerro, Hewlett Packard Enterprise), launchers (ArianeGroup), and orbital systems (German space agency DLR, Airbus Defence & Space, and Thales Alenia Space).\n\nA project within Europeâs reach\n\nASCEND Â© Thales Alenia Space/Master Image Programmes\n\nThe purpose of the ASCEND study was to compare the environmental impacts of space-based and Earth-based data centers. It was also intended to validate the technological feasibility of developing, deploying and operating such centers in orbit. In order to significantly reduce the CO2 emissions generated by the processing and storage of digital, the results of the study estimate that such space infrastructures would require the development of a launcher ten times less emissive over its entire lifecycle. Moreover, space data centers would not require water to cool them, a key advantage in times of increasing drought.\n\nCurbing the energy and environment impacts of data centers could kick-start major investments within the framework of the EU Green Deal, potentially justifying the development of a high-capacity, eco-designed and reusable launcher. Thanks to ArianeGroupâs contribution and to analytics from ESAâs PROTEIN feasibility study, ASCEND validated the feasibility of a launcher capable of conducting multiple launches while mitigating their carbon footprint. Modular space infrastructures would be assembled in orbit using robotic technologies from the European Commissionâs EROSS IOD (European Robotic Orbital Support Services In Orbit Demonstrator) led by Thales Alenia Space, scheduled to fly its first mission in 2026. This would enable Europe to restore its leadership in transportation, space logistics and assembly of large in-orbit infrastructures.\n\nEnsuring Europeâs digital sovereignty\n\nASCEND Â© Thales Alenia Space/Master Image Programmes\n\nThe ASCEND project could contribute to Europeâs digital sovereignty, reducing its digital carbon footprint while ensuring data security for citizens and businesses alike. The market for data centers by 2030 is estimated at 23 gigawatts of capacity; ASCEND aims to deploy one gigawatt before 2050. The results of the study also confirm the projectâs economic viability, offering a prospect of a return on investment of several billion euros between now and 2050.\n\nâThe results of the ASCEND study confirm that deploying data centers in space could transform the European digital landscape, offering a more eco-friendly and sovereign solution for hosting and processing data. Weâre proud to be contributing to an initiative supporting Europeâs net-zero objectives and strengthening its technological sovereignty.â said Christophe Valorge, Chief Technical Officer, Thales Alenia Space.\n\nThales Alenia Space and its partners now intend to pursue the ASCEND feasibility study to consolidate and optimize its results. At the same time, a paradigm shift within the space sector is required to accomplish the projectâs goals, leveraging technologies that are within reach for Europe.\n\nFunded by the European Union.
