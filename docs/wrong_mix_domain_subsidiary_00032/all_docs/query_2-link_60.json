        "text": "Imagery is a transformative tool that can help us see things in a new way. The Devereux Center for Resilient Children (DCRC) often uses imagery to share valuable information about the science of resilience – the ability to “bounce back” from misfortune or change.\n\nPicture this: Adults are like pitchers. When we take steps to prioritize our health, our pitchers are full. This means we have the ability to “pour” kindness and patience into others. Alternatively, if we do not take care of ourselves, our pitchers can become empty, and it is challenging to be the person we want to be for our family, friends and colleagues. For parents, we can take this imagery one step further. If parents are the pitchers, then children are the cups. When our pitchers are full, we are better prepared to fill our children with love, joy and confidence.\n\nAs we spend time with our family and friends this summer, the DCRC team offers resilience-building tips to keep our pitchers full – and to fill our children's cups with all they need to flourish."
