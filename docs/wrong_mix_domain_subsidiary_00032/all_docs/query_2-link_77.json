        "text": "Gateway Elements\n\nWith its modular design offering flexibility and extensibility over its minimum 15-year lifespan in lunar orbit, Gateway offers a building block approach to deep space exploration and development.\n\nPower and Propulsion Element (PPE)\n\nThe Power and Propulsion Element is a high-power, 60-kilowatt solar electric propulsion spacecraft that will provide power, high-rate communications between Gateway and Earth, attitude control, and orbital transfer capabilities for Gateway.\n\nIn May 2019, NASA selected Maxar Technologies of Westminster, Colorado, to develop and build PPE.\n\nThe PPE project is managed out of NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nHALO (Habitation and Logistics Outpost)\n\nHALO is one of two habitation elements where astronauts will live, exercise, prepare meals, rest, prepare for lunar surface missions, and conduct research while visiting Gateway. The pressurized living quarters will provide docking ports for visiting spacecraft like NASA’s Orion spacecraft, lunar landers, and logistics resupply craft, and serve as the backbone for command and control and power distribution across Gateway. The module will perform other core functions, including hosting science investigations via internal and external payload accommodations, and communicating with lunar surface expeditions through the Lunar Link system provided by ESA.\n\nHALO is managed out of NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. Northrop Grumman of Dulles, Virginia was awarded a contract for the preliminary design of HALO in 2020, and the remaining content for HALO was finalized between NASA and Northrop Grumman through signing a contract in July 2021.\n\nLunar I-Hab\n\nGateway second habitable element, Lunar I-Hab is a pressurized module that will provide living quarters for astronauts visiting the Gateway, and multiple docking ports for visiting vehicles and other modules.\n\nLunar I-Hab is led by ESA, which selected Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor. JAXA is making significant contributions to Lunar I-Hab, providing the environmental control support system, thermal cooling pumps, and batteries.\n\nLunar View\n\nProvided by ESA, Lunar View is a habitable element that will transport cargo to Gateway, provide storage space once docked at the space station, provide fuel to Gateway’s propulsion system, and provide a view of space and the Moon through its windows.\n\nThe prime contractor for Lunar View is Thales Alenia Space.\n\nCrew and Science Airlock\n\nProvided by the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre of the United Arab Emirates, the Crew and Science Airlock will be a critical piece of infrastructure for Gateway’s planned minimum 15-year lifespan in lunar orbit, permitting crew and science payload transfers to and from the habitable environment of Gateway’s crew modules to the vacuum of space – transfers that will be essential for space station maintenance and conducting science in the deep space lunar environment.\n\nDeep Space Logistics (DSL)\n\nAs astronauts conduct missions at Gateway and prepare for lunar surface expeditions, they will need deliveries of critical pressurized and unpressurized cargo, science experiments, and supplies like sample collection materials. In March 2020, NASA announced SpaceX as the first U.S. commercial provider under the Gateway Logistics Services contract to deliver cargo and other supplies to Gateway.\n\nThe Gateway Deep Space Logistics Office is based at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nCanadarm3\n\nPart of the Gateway External Robotics Systems (GERS) provided by CSA, Canadarm3 is a robotic system that will use cutting-edge software to perform Gateway tasks. The system will help maintain, repair and inspect Gateway, capture visiting vehicles, help astronauts during spacewalks, and enable science in Gateway’s lunar orbit.\n\nVehicle System Manager (VSM) software will allow Gateway to operate autonomously, representing a leap forward in spacecraft capability. VSM will provide activity planning, resource management, vehicle control, and fault management for Gateway.\n\nAdditional Artemis elements not managed under the Gateway Program:\n\nThe Orion spacecraft will deliver crew and supplies to the Gateway space station."
