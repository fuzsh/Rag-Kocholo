Representing the pinnacle of computing power, the Atlas 900 AI cluster consists of thousands of Ascend processors. Leveraging the Huawei cluster communication library and job scheduling platform, it also integrates HCCS, PCIe 4.0, and 100G RoCE interfaces to fully unlock the computing power of the Ascend processors.

Atlas 900 delivers ultra-high AI performance. This means faster AI model training with images and speech, more efficient astronomical and oil exploration, weather forecast, and faster time to market (TTM) for autonomous driving.
