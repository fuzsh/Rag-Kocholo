In the example below, the author is the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations and the publisher is the Department of the Navy.\n\nIn the example above, the author is NOT an umbrella organization, signatory, or any of the following:\n\nChief of Naval Operations\n\nDeputy Chief of Naval Operations\n\nW. F. Moran\n\nDepartment of Defense\n\nNavy Pentagon\n\nR. P. Burke\n\nUnited States of America​\n\nDo not include acronyms for organizations listed as authors in the List of References or footnotes:\n\nYES: Office of the Chief of Naval Operations.\n\nNO: Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO or OCNO).\n\nNO: CNO or OCNO.\n\nWhen naming government organizations, be consistent: for example, either Department of Defense or U.S. Department of Defense. If citing organizations from multiple countries, ensure that it is clear which organization is associated with which country—for example, Australian Department of Defence, South African Department of Defence, Sri Lanka Ministry of Defence, Singapore Ministry of Defence.\n\nEvery equation that is not field-specific common knowledge needs to be cited. You may weave the source into the narrative:\n\nThe next step was to apply the X method (Ochoa, 2022), to describe ...\n\nOchoa (2022) summarizes the derivation as follows ...\n\nHere is an example of citing properly before the equation. Note the period at the end. Equations must function grammatically as part of the text:\n\nBoito et al. (2015) address the widely used metric, the cost per flying hours (CPFH). The formula for CPFH is\n\nAdapted from Moreau, P. P. (2022).

This metric, expressed as\n\n,\n\ntakes the total O&S costs and divides it by the total number of aircraft (Boito et al., 2015).\n\nAdapted from Moreau, P. P. (2022).

A citation is not needed when all elements of the figure are your own creation.\n\nSee Figure 1 for placement of the title and the in-text citation.\n\nPut a period and a space after the title.\n\nIf you use the figure exactly as it appears in the source, use\n\n“Source: ___.”\n\nIf you alter the original figure or use someone else's image or data to create the figure, use “Adapted from ___.”\n\nFigure 1. A Figure with a Citation in APA, Chicago Author-Date, or INFORMS Style. Source: Author (2017).\n\nor\n\nFigure 1. A Figure with a Citation in APA, Chicago Author-Date, or INFORMS Style. Adapted from Author (2017).\n\nFor more details, see the Thesis Template.\n\nIf any information is missing from a source (a journal with no volume number, for example), simply omit that information. For sources consulted in hardcopy, omit the URL and any additional verbiage that introduces it. Anything retrieved online, however, MUST have a link. The only exception is journals retrieved from a subscription database such as ProQuest.\n\nWhen listing an online document (for example, a thesis, report, or journal article) in the references, if possible, provide a DOI. If the source does not have a DOI, link to the document itself (PDF, etc.) or to the landing page that directs the reader to the full text.\n\nDo not insert a hard or soft return within the URL string: doing so breaks the link.\n\nA DOI or URL does not belong in an in-text citation. Ever.\n\nWhen citing a source retrieved online, use the \"online\" format even when you or someone else printed out the material. For example, if you print out a thesis or your advisor provides you with a printed thesis, it is still categorized as an online document.\n\nOnly cite as a print source when the material has been produced by a publisher in hard copy. For example, if you obtain a print journal or book from the library stacks, it is categorized as a printed source.\n\nAn indirect source is a source that cites some other work that you discuss in your text.\n\nWhenever possible, consult primary sources and your sources’ sources yourself. Upon investigation of the primary source, you may find you disagree with the indirect source author’s analysis or methods.\n\nHow to Incorporate Indirect Sources\n\nThe following passage incorporates a properly credited indirect source. The indirect source information is highlighted in yellow; the primary source information is highlighted in blue.\n\nWalker (2008) describes Miguel Roig's 1999 experiment, which correlates inadequate paraphrasing in student writing with poor reading comprehension. Citing Roig’s data, Walker explains that \"students do in fact possess skills necessary for paraphrasing but … may be impeded from applying those skills when dealing with rigorous text\" (p. 387).\n\nNote: Include only the indirect source (the source you consulted) in your reference list.\n\nFor more information\n\nSee the TPO's \"Citing Your Sources’ Sources\" handout.\n\nA citation is required if you did not wholly create the table—i.e., if you used someone else's data. A citation is not needed when all elements of the table are your own creation.\n\nSee Table 1 for placement of the title and the in-text citation.\n\nPut a period and a space after the title.\n\nIf you use the table exactly as it appears in the source, use\n\n“Source: ___.”\n\nIf you alter the original table or if you use someone else's data to create the table, use “Adapted from ___.”\n\nTable 1.

Old and rejected poems. (1989). Translated by Hickinson, P. Narrow Fellow Press.\n\nFor works in languages other than English, format the title in sentence case, then give the translation, also in sentence case, in square brackets immediately following:\n\nR: Manqué, M.
