        "text": "Most of my research is concerned with modelling and analysis of devices.\n\nModelling and systematic analysis of interactive systems\n\nCurrent research on this topic includes exploring mechanisms for proving properties of specifications of interactive behaviour using model checkers [Campos & Harrison, 2001, 2003] and theorem provers [Harrison, Campos, Masci, 2015]. Some of this work focuses on the IVY tool developed by Jose Campos at Braga. which supports the instantiation of standard property templates to a particular model. These templates can be applied systematically to analyse interactive devices [Campos & Harrison, 2008, 2009, 2011] and [Harrison, Campos & Masci, 2013] and the use of information resources to restrict analysis to cognitively plausible paths [Doherty, Campos & Harrison, 2008, Campos, Doherty and Harrison, 2014, Harrison, Campos, Silva & Curzon, 2016]. Much of the research now uses the PVS theorem prover and tools developed by Paolo Masci. This allows the analysis of larger models.\n\nThis research has been funded by a half time research fellowship at QMUL (http://www.chi-med.ac.uk) in the context of medical instruments. More recent research has considered the complementary role of model checking and theorem proving in the analysis of interactive devices, see for example [Masci et al. 2013, Harrison et al, 2019, 2021]. Most of the model checking work involves collaboration with Campos at the University of Minho in Braga although I have also developed an analysis as part of a safety case, with the Royal Victoria Infirmary at Newcastle, for a neonatal dialysis machine. The theorem proving work involves collaboration with Masci at the National Institute of Aerospace, USA. A current focus is the analysis of use centred safety requirements in integrated clinical environments.\n\nCurrent ongoing research is the development of relevant tools to ease the analysis process, see [Campos et al, 2020]"
