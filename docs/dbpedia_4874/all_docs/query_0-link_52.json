This is where you can sign in guests, and check out carts, lockout keys, or keys to rooms that you have reserved. The Information Center is staffed 24/7 either by students or security guards. If you have an emergency please call Penn Police first and then, if you want, you can call the Info Center so that they can contact the RA/GA who is on duty to let them know.\n\nHarrison House Office - P: 215-573-3539 E: harrison@collegehouses.upenn.edu\n\nThe Harrison House Office is a great resource. The staff in the Office works to keep all the events going on in Harrison running smoothly.
