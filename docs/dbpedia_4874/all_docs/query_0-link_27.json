As a nurse, I appreciate that she takes the time to listen and discuss goals of care with the patient and family. I also want to acknowledge the nurse Brittany in the office who went out of her way to contact me with my father’s results and coordinating appointments!\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 2/5/2024\n\nNicole took her time with me, gave me enough blood work to check everything out. We found out that I had pneumonia and I’ve taken a test that she asked me to take waiting waiting to get my chest CAT scan.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 11/27/2023\n\nNicole Harrison goes above & beyond just my [ ] She asks how I am holistically & checks in with all of my issues. She definitely cares for her patients.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 9/24/2023\n\nNicole was amazing(and unusual) in that she took the time to explain every I needed to know and understand about my condition, her approach and treatment. I have had this life altering condition for so many years I can’t remember not having it. Other doctors have acknowledged the problem but have done NOTHING to solve the problem in order to make my life bearable… but they always billed me!!!! Nicole is a lifesaver!!!! I will never forget her help, professionalism, and the kindness of the staff!!!\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 6/10/2023\n\nNicole Harrison works under Dr Waheed. She listened to me when I was very concerned and confused about a meeting I had with Dr waheed. I was on Carboplatin & taxol for approximately 5 years. All my CT scans were stable. I asked waheed about getting off chemotherapy. He got angry and said \"\" you've been on 2 kinds chemotherapy and by now we are probably looking at scar tissue...but keep going to chemotherapy..very confusing. I think I was in remission for years .\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 5/24/2023\n\nNicole was wonderful! She answered my list of questions thoroughly and in a kind, professional manner. She didn’t rush the appointment and made sure that I had all my answers before I left.\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\nStar\n\n5 out of 5 stars5 of 5 stars\n\nReviewed on 5/15/2023\n\nI rarely find medical providers that I would literally trust with my life. I feel that FNP Harrison is 100% invested in my care and helping me understand what my options are, what she recommends (and why), and hematology’s role in my overall care. She treated me and my husband with dignity and talked to us like human beings. The nurse and front desk were awesome as well. Well done!"
