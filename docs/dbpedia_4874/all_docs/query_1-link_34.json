        "text": "Biography\n\nWillie Harrison graduated from Utah State University in 2007 with his MS in Electrical Engineering and from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2012 with his PhD is Electrical and Computer Engineering. In 2012, he joined the faculty of the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs as an Assistant Professor, and he has been with the BYU Electrical and Computer Engineering Department since 2017.\n\nAt UCCS, he served on the proposal, instructor search, graduate fellowship selection, and Internationalization Advisory committees, and he additionally served as faculty advisor to the IEEE student club. He earned the Teacher of the Year award for the 2015-2016 academic school year for the UCCS College of Applied Science.\n\nAt BYU, Dr. Harrison was voted the Most Influential Faculty Member in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department for the 2022-2023 academic year, and he has taught courses in information theory, coding theory, machine learning, physical-layer security, stochastic processes, digital communications, digital signal processing, satellite communications, and signals and systems.\n\nHe also serves actively in the broader electrical engineering community. Over the past six years, he has participated in fourteen workshops and conferences, many of which covered wireless security. He has served as a reviewer on five NSF proposal review panels, a “remote reviewer” for CHIST-ERA ERA-NET (a European consortium of twenty research funding organizations), and as a scholarly reviewer for multiple IEEE publications.\n\nHis experience extends internationally, as he is fluent in Mandarin Chinese and for three years directed an NSF-funded International Research for Students (IRES) program in conjunction with the University of Coimbra, Portugal."
