        "meta_description": "The higher classification of termites requires substantial revision as the Neoisoptera, the most diverse termite lineage, comprise many paraphyletic and polyphyletic higher taxa. Here, we produce an updated termite classification using genomic-scale analyses. We reconstruct phylogenies under diverse substitution models with ultraconserved elements analyzed as concatenated matrices or within the multi-species coalescence framework. Our classification is further supported by analyses controlling for rogue loci and taxa, and topological tests. We show that the Neoisoptera are composed of seven family-level monophyletic lineages, including the Heterotermitidae Froggatt, Psammotermitidae Holmgren, and Termitogetonidae Holmgren, raised from subfamilial rank. The species-rich Termitidae are composed of 18 subfamily-level monophyletic lineages, including the new subfamilies Crepititermitinae, Cylindrotermitinae, Forficulitermitinae, Neocapritermitinae, Protohamitermitinae, and Promirotermitinae; and the revived Amitermitinae Kemner, Microcerotermitinae Holmgren, and Mirocapritermitinae Kemner. Building an updated taxonomic classification on the foundation of unambiguously supported monophyletic lineages makes it highly resilient to potential destabilization caused by the future availability of novel phylogenetic markers and methods. The taxonomic stability is further guaranteed by the modularity of the new termite classification, designed to accommodate as-yet undescribed species with uncertain affinities to the herein delimited monophyletic lineages in the form of new families or subfamilies. Here, the authors produce an updated termite classification with genomic scale analyses, highlighting thirteen family-level lineages and resilience of their classification to future termite research.",

        "text": "Phylogenetic analyses and their implication on the higher classification of termites\n\nOur phylogenetic reconstructions support the monophyly of all currently recognised termite families (sensu Krishna et al.7, modified by Wang et al.33), except Rhinotermitidae, which is paraphyletic with respect to Serritermitidae and Termitidae, as previously acknowledged3,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44.\n\nThe Rhinotermitidae (sensu Krishna et al.7) can be divided into four monophyletic lineages diverging early alongside Serritermitidae and Termitidae (Figs. 1, 2): Heterotermitinae Froggatt + Coptotermitinae Holmgren, Psammotermitinae Holmgren + Prorhinotermitinae Quennedey & Deligne, Rhinotermitinae Froggatt, and Termitogetoninae Holmgren. All our analyses supported the monophyly of these four clades, and our analyses with RogueNaRok found no evidence of rogue taxa within these clades. Assigning each of these four clades a familial rank resolves the challenges embodied in Rhinotermitidae as traditionally conceived. Accordingly, we raise these four lineages to familial rank. We restrict Rhinotermitidae to Acorhinotermes, Dolichorhinotermes, Parrhinotermes, Rhinotermes, and Schedorhinotermes, the five genera composing the Rhinotermitinae (i.e., Rhinotermitidae Froggatt, sensu novo). We synonymise the two largely unused names Arrhinotermitinae and Leucotermitinae with Coptotermitinae and Heterotermitinae, respectively. We further synonymise Coptotermitinae with Heterotermitinae. The synonymy of the monogeneric Coptotermitinae (Coptotermes) with Heterotermitinae is justified by the paraphyly of Heterotermitinae, within which Coptotermitinae are nested. Heterotermitinae, having precedence over the other names, is here elevated to familial rank (i.e., elevated as Heterotermitidae Froggatt, stat. nov.). The monogeneric subfamilies Prorhinotermitinae and Psammotermitinae are together raised to familial rank, the latter having precedence (i.e., Psammotermitidae Holmgren, stat. nov.). Lastly, we elevate Termitogetoninae to Termitogetonidae Holmgren, stat. nov. (see Systematics, infra).\n\nThe phylogenetic relationships of Psammotermitidae and Termitogetonidae, which diverged shortly after the origin of the clade Serritermitidae + Rhinotermitidae + Termitogetonidae + Psammotermitidae + Heterotermitidae + Termitidae, are unresolved and variable among analyses (Fig. 1). Our phylogenetic analyses placed Termitogetonidae in four potential topological conformations, being sister to: Psammotermitidae (analyses on concatenated data: UFBs = 49–93, n = 7/30 analyses; coalescence analyses: LPP = 0.49, n = 1/21); Serritermitidae + Rhinotermitidae (UFBs = 60–99, n = 13/30; LPPs = 0.35–0.54, 6/21); Heterotermitidae + Termitidae (LPPs = 0.49–0.90, n = 6/21); and Psammotermitidae + Heterotermitidae + Termitidae (UFBs = 52–99, n = 10/30; LPPs = 0.38–0.88, n = 8/21). The latter branching was recovered in both majority rule consensus trees, but with sCFs close to 33.3% (32.1–32.5%; Figs. 1, 2), the values obtained for alignments generated at random, indicating the absence of signal for this node in the alignments50. To assess the anomaly zone surrounding the origin of Termitogetonidae and Psammotermitidae, we performed a series of topology tests displacing Termitogetonidae. Topology tests indicated that Termitogetonidae could be sister to non-Stylotermitidae Neoisoptera and Psammotermitidae + Heterotermitidae + Termitidae, as reported in some mitogenome-based Bayesian phylogenies51, but it was never in a direct sister relationship with any of these families (AU tests; Supplementary Data 6).\n\nOur sampling of Termitidae included a total of 77 representative genera. Notably, the Syntermitinae were found to be paraphyletic and include the enigmatic monotypic genus Genuotermes Emerson (see Fig. 1). Although sharing key features with the Syntermitinae, Genuotermes was first tentatively assigned to the Termitinae52, based on similar soldier morphologies (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 17, 18). Genuotermes was identified as a rogue taxon by RogueNaRok in one analysis performed on concatenated sequence data (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 5). Genuotermes was also retrieved sister to Onkotermes in one coalescence analysis (Fig. 2; tree 36 in “File 4: trees.tar”, available on Dryad at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.02v6wwqbm; LPP = 0.66), both genera forming a clade outside the Syntermitinae and the Microcerotermes clade. The phylogenetic position of Genuotermes is, therefore, not entirely resolved; however, our analyses generally placed Genuotermes within the Syntermitinae53, and we hereby formally transfer this genus to the subfamily Syntermitinae.\n\nOur phylogenetic analyses indicate that all other subfamilies of Termitidae are monophyletic, with the exception of the polyphyletic Termitinae, within which four other subfamilies are nested: Cubitermitinae, Engelitermitinae, Nasutitermitinae, and Syntermitinae. The relationships within the Termitinae + Cubitermitinae + Engelitermitinae + Nasutitermitinae + Syntermitinae clade are largely unresolved. This clade is composed of a dozen monophyletic lineages with uncertain relationships and separated by exceedingly short internodes (see Figs. 1, 2). Based on our phylogenetic reconstructions, we recognise 18 major monophyletic lineages within Termitidae, eight of which already have subfamilial status. Giving subfamilial ranks to the other ten lineages resolves the polyphyly of Termitinae while simultaneously retaining the subfamilial status of four subfamilies supported as monophyletic: Cubitermitinae (UFBs = 100; LPPs = 1; sCFs = 64–64.9%), Engelitermitinae, Nasutitermitinae (UFBs = 100; LPPs = 0.99–1; sCFs = 52.1–53%), and Syntermitinae (UFBs = 100; LPPs = 0.92–1; sCFs = 62.9–64%). Accordingly, we redefine Termitinae Latreille sensu novo and restrict it to Termes and related genera, which unambiguously formed a monophyletic group in all our analyses (UFBs = 100; LPPs = 1; sCFs = 56.5–57%). We advocate the resurrection of three monophyletic subfamilies: Microcerotermitinae Holmgren stat. rev. (UFBs = 100; LPPs = 0.74–1; sCFs = 48.2–49.7%), Mirocapritermitinae Kemner stat. rev. (UFBs = 99–100; LPPs = 1; sCFs = 55–56.1%), and Amitermitinae Kemner stat. rev. (UFBs = 99–100; LPPs = 0.98–1; sCFs = 45.8–46.9%). The aforementioned subfamilies were found monophyletic across all analyses, with the exception of Microcerotermitinae, as Onkotermes was placed sister to Microcerotermes + Syntermitinae in two coalescence analyses (LPPs = 1; trees 34, 50 in “File 4: trees.tar”, available on Dryad at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.02v6wwqbm) and sister to Genuotermes in one coalescence analysis (see above). Although not entirely supported by our phylogenetic analyses, the placement of Onkotermes within Microcerotermitinae is also justified by their similar gut morphologies, with a characteristic elbowed junction between the mixed segment and the ileum (Fig. 3). Our topology tests did not reject Microcerotermitinae + Syntermitinae as sisters to other non-Sphaerotermitinae, non-Macrotermitinae, non-Foraminitermitinae and non-Apicotermitinae Termitidae (Supplementary Data 6), while coalescence analyses placed the clade on a polytomy in 8 of 21 coalescence analyses run with diverse sequence matrices and substitution models (Fig. 2).\n\nLastly, we propose to erect six monophyletic lineages to new subfamilies in Termitidae: Crepititermitinae subfam. nov., Cylindrotermitinae subfam. nov. (UFBs = 78–100; LPPs = 0.70–1; sCFs = 44.4–44.7%), Forficulitermitinae subfam. nov., Neocapritermitinae subfam. nov. (UFBs = 100; LPPs = 1; sCFs = 76.6–77%), Protohamitermitinae subfam. nov., and Promirotermitinae subfam. nov. (UFBs = 100; LPPs = 1; sCFs = 77.4–79.5%). These six subfamilies were placed on a polytomy, reflecting their uncertain phylogenetic positions, varying among analyses. The monotypic subfamilies Crepititermitinae and Forficulitermitinae were identified as rogue taxa in, respectively, two and ten analyses performed on concatenated sequence data from edge-trimmed protein-coding loci (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 5). Our topology tests did not reject Engelitermitinae and Forficulitermitinae as forming a clade sister to other non-Sphaerotermitinae, non-Macrotermitinae, non-Foraminitermitinae, non-Apicotermitinae, non-Microcerotermitinae and non-Syntermitinae Termitidae (AU tests; Supplementary Data 6). The Crepititermitinae were retrieved as sister to Cylindrotermitinae + Protohamitermitinae in 18 of 30 analyses performed on concatenated sequence data (Fig. 1; UFBs = 51–87), a scenario absent in our coalescence analyses (Fig. 2). The uncertain phylogenetic positions of Crepititermitinae and Forficulitermitinae, together with their unique combinations of morphological and biological characteristics (see the Systematics section below; Fig. 3), justified their placements in two separate subfamilies.\n\nSystematics\n\nWe present the revised classification of extant Isoptera in Table 1. The diagnoses and distribution maps of Neoisoptera families and subfamilies presented herein are based on and modified from Krishna et al.7. The biogeographic boundaries follow Holt et al.54. The descriptions of digestive tubes follow Noirot55.\n\nFamily-level classification changes for Neoisoptera\n\nIn the following, we provide abridged diagnoses for families with changes. Please refer to Supplementary Note 1 for extended diagnoses of all neoisopteran families and Supplementary Note 2 for a revised identification key to all families of Isoptera.\n\nFamily Rhinotermitidae Froggatt, sensu novo\n\nThe subfamily Rhinotermitinae Froggatt21, 1897: 518, is herein elevated to the familial rank.\n\nType genus: Rhinotermes Hagen56, 1858.\n\nIncluded genera (5): Acorhinotermes Emerson, Dolichorhinotermes Snyder & Emerson, Parrhinotermes Holmgren, Rhinotermes Hagen, and Schedorhinotermes Silvestri (Macrorhinotermes Holmgren, syn. nov.).\n\nDiagnosis: Imagoes with inflated clypeus, slightly or not at all drawn out over the labrum —reminiscent of a “nose-like” projection; and a narrow groove running from the fontanelle to the clypeus. Imago-worker left mandible with an apical tooth, followed by three distinct (unequal) marginal teeth. Imagoes, workers, and soldiers with anterior margin of postclypeus convex. Soldiers without setae surrounding the fontanelle. Soldier labrum elongated, forming a brush apically and endowed with a groove in the centre along which the chemical secretion of the frontal gland flows from the fontanelle.\n\nRemarks: Macrorhinotermes was initially described as a subgenus of Rhinotermes57. Snyder26 considered Macrorhinotermes as a potential synonym of Schedorhinotermes but did not unambiguously synonymize the two names, and Macrorhinotermes has remained a valid genus name. Here, we formally synonymize Macrorhinotermes and Schedorhinotermes, the latter having precedence over the former. There is an interesting diversity of soldier morphologies among Rhinotermitidae. Soldiers can be monomorphic as in Acorhinotermes and Parrhinotermes; dimorphic as in Dolichorhinotermes, Rhinotermes, and most Schedorhinotermes; or trimorphic as in some Schedorhinotermes. Rhinotermitidae occur in the Australian, Afrotropical, Neotropical, Oriental, Palaearctic (Sino-Japanese), and Oceanian realms.\n\nFamily Termitogetonidae Holmgren, stat. nov\n\nThe subfamily Termitogetoninae Holmgren23, 1910: 286, is herein elevated to the familial rank.\n\nType genus: Termitogeton Desneux58, 1904\n\nIncluded genus: monogeneric.\n\nDiagnosis: Imagoes densely hairy. Head subtriangular with posterior margin sinuate. Pronotum small, with median projections from anterior margins. Soldiers are densely hairy with a heart-shaped head. Soldier mandibles elongated without marginal teeth. Soldier legs with two protibial apical spurs. All castes dorso-ventrally flattened.\n\nRemarks: Termitogeton is a wood-feeding termite known from the Oriental and Oceanian realms. It is composed of only two known extant species.\n\nFamily Psammotermitidae Holmgren, stat. nov\n\nThe family Psammotermitidae regroups the Psammotermitinae and Prorhinotermitinae subfamilies.\n\nSubfamily Psammotermitinae Holmgren24, 1911: 64.\n\nType genus: Psammotermes Desneux59, 1902\n\nSubfamily Prorhinotermitinae Quennedey & Deligne60, 1975: 265.\n\nType genus: Prorhinotermes Silvestri61, 1909.\n\nIncluded extant genera (2): Psammotermes Desneux and Prorhinotermes Silvestri.\n\nDiagnosis: Imagoes with pronotum flat; tarsi tetramerous. Wings with all veins arising independently from inside the wing scales. Nymphs with fused wing buds forming two shield-looking structures on the mesothorax and metathorax. Imago-worker left mandible with an apical tooth followed by three distinct marginal teeth. Soldiers with tibial spurs formula 3:2:2; presenting a more or less marked groove from the fontanelle to clypeus60.\n\nRemarks: The extinct genus †Zophotermes Engel, 2011 is included in the Psammotermitidae. The distribution of Prorhinotermes is mostly insular. This distribution has fuelled speculation that colonies can be transported in driftwood by ocean currents, thus accounting for such a wide distribution on islands of the South Pacific. In sharp contrast, Psammotermes is a desert dweller occurring in the Afrotropical (incl. Madagascan), Saharo-Arabian and Oriental realms.\n\nClade Geoisoptera Engel, Hellemans, & Bourguignon, nov\n\nThis is an important group of termites as it includes the Termitidae, the most species-rich family of Isoptera, and the Heterotermitidae, which include some of the most widespread and critical pest species. In this clade, the number of chromosomes is fixed to 2n = 42 (reviewed in Jankásek et al.62), and their mitogenomes are characterised by a complex repeat structure in their control region36. Additionally, all species of this clade have a true worker caste (as in Mastotermitidae, Hodotermitidae, and Rhinotermitidae sensu novo) and typically live in large colonies.\n\nEtymology: The clade name is a combination of the Ancient Greek prefix geo– (γεω–, from gê / γῆ, meaning “soil,” “land,” or “earth”) and Isoptera. The name references the growing reliance on organically rich soil as a source of nitrogen63.\n\nFamily Heterotermitidae Froggatt, stat. nov\n\nThe subfamily Heterotermitinae Froggatt21,1897: 550, is herein elevated to the familial rank.\n\nHeterotermitinae Froggatt21, 1897: 550. Type genus: Heterotermes Froggatt21.\n\nLeucotermitinae Holmgren23, 1910: 285. Type genus: Leucotermes Silvestri64, 1901 [= Heterotermes Froggatt21, 1897].\n\nCoptotermitinae Holmgren23, 1910: 285. Type genus: Coptotermes Wasmann65, 1896. Syn. nov.\n\nArrhinotermitinae Sjöstedt66, 1926: 8. Type genus: Arrhinotermes Wasmann67, 1902 [= Coptotermes Wasmann]. Syn. nov.\n\nType genus: Heterotermes Froggatt21, 1897\n\nIncluded genera (3): Coptotermes Wasmann, Heterotermes Froggatt, and Reticulitermes Holmgren. †Lukotermes Perkovsky & Nel, syn. nov. is an extinct member of Heterotermitidae.\n\nDiagnosis: Imagoes with postclypeus devoid of nose-like projection or groove extending from the fontanelle. Head round in Coptotermes and oval with even posterior margin in Heterotermes and Reticulitermes. Pronotum without median projection on the anterior margin; tarsi tetramerous. Workers and soldiers with anterior margin of postclypeus flat or concave. Soldiers with fontanelle surrounded by setae and katana-shaped mandibles devoid of marginal teeth (though with basal serrations); protibia with more than three protibial apical spurs. Soldiers of Coptotermes displaying an egg-shaped head with a large fontanelle directed forward and oozing latex-appearing secretions. Soldiers of Heterotermes and Reticulitermes exhibit a rectangular head with a small indistinct fontanelle.\n\nRemarks: Some species exhibit slightly dimorphic soldiers68. The Heterotermitidae now encompass the three genera often referred to as “subterranean termites”, a term historically associated with “Rhinotermitidae” with an extensive pest status in the literature. The Heterotermitidae occur across most temperate and tropical regions.\n\nSubfamily-level classification changes for Termitidae Latreille\n\nThe number of subfamilies within the Termitidae is expanded given that the current Termitinae are demonstrably polyphyletic. We describe the new subfamilies of Termitidae erected in this paper and redescribe the Termitinae. We do not address the Syntermitinae, as the inclusion of Genuotermes does not alter the diagnosis of the subfamily. We do not address the other seven subfamilies of Termitinae, as they remain unaltered (i.e., Sphaerotermitinae Engel & Krishna; Macrotermitinae Kemner; Foraminitermitinae Holmgren; Apicotermitinae Grassé & Noirot; Engelitermitinae Romero Arias, Roisin, & Scheffrahn; Nasutitermitinae Hare; and Cubitermitinae Weidner). Diagnoses for these subfamilies can be found in Krishna et al.7 and Romero Arias et al.20. An updated key for all subfamilies of Termitidae is given in Supplementary Note 3. An updated list of all genera of extant Isoptera currently recognised is given in Supplementary Note 4. A list of the top 20 UCEs diagnostic for each subfamily of Termitidae (excluding subfamilies represented by only one sample, i.e., Crepititermitinae, Forficulitermitinae, and Protohamitermitinae) is provided in Supplementary Data 7. An accompanying diagnostic tool is available on the Termite UCE Database (in “File 5: termitidae_diagnosing_database_v1.fasta.gz” available on Dryad at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.02v6wwqbm; also available at: https://github.com/sihellem/TER-UCE-DB/). Diagnostic features for each of the 18 subfamilies are given in Supplementary Figs. 1–18.\n\nSubfamily Amitermitinae Kemner, stat. nov\n\nAmitermitinae Kemner69, 1934: 110.\n\nType genus: Amitermes Silvestri64, 1901.\n\nIncluded genera (14): Ahamitermes Mjöberg, Amitermes Silvestri, Dentispicotermes Emerson, Drepanotermes Silvestri, Eremotermes Silvestri, Globitermes Holmgren, Gnathamitermes Light, Hoplotermes Light, Incolitermes Gay, Invasitermes Miller, Orthognathotermes Holmgren, Prohamitermes Holmgren, Pseudhamitermes Holmgren, and Synhamitermes Holmgren.\n\nDiagnosis: Imago-worker left mandible with apical tooth (LAt) shorter than marginal teeth (LMt), except in a few genera such as: Ahamitermes and Invasitermes70, or Orthognathotermes (see Supplementary Fig. 1i). Worker gut with ileum (P1) tubular, dilated, or globular, without loop ventrally; each pair of Malpighian tubules united in one base (or nodule), except in Prohamitermes in which each tubule ends in its own nodule. Soldiers generally have a pear-shaped head and are devoid of frontal projection (except in Eremotermes and Dentispicotermes). Diagnostic UCE loci are listed in Supplementary Data 7. Diagnostic features are given in Supplementary Fig. 1.\n\nThe subfamily is most similar to the Promirotermitinae, whose enteric valve (P2) position, i.e. the insertion of P1 into the paunch (P3), occurs on the right side of the abdomen (rather than the left side, as in Microcerotermitinae, Mirocapritermitinae, and Neocapritermitinae; Fig. 3). The Amitermitinae can be distinguished from the promirotermitines by: P1 tubular to inflated (always inflated in Promirotermitinae); soldier mandibles of various forms, ranging from crushing, piercing, slashing, or symmetrical snapping (always symmetrical snapping in Promirotermitinae); and soldier head pear-shaped without frontal projection (a notable frontal hump or projection is present in Promirotermitinae).\n\nRemarks: Amitermitinae are widespread across every tropical and subtropical biogeographic realm. Species feed on various substrates, including mounds, soil, wood (incl. dry grasses), and the soil-wood interface. The genus Invasitermes is reported as soldierless.\n\nSubfamily Crepititermitinae Hellemans, Engel, & Bourguignon, subfam. nov\n\nZoobank registration: https://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:5F7D1841-7543-4914-B552-10318E2224C2.\n\nType genus: Crepititermes Emerson71, 1925.\n\nIncluded genera: monogeneric.\n\nDiagnosis: Imago-worker left mandible lacks a third marginal tooth (LMt3). Right mandible lacking second marginal tooth (RMt2). Worker gut with a blind diverticulum or caecum on P3; Malpighian tubules forming two pairs attached individually. Soldiers with subrectangular heads, labrums with concave apical margins and sharp apicolateral points, flattened frons, and symmetrical snapping mandibles. Diagnostic features are given in Supplementary Fig. 3.\n\nThe presence of a blind diverticulum on P3 and the absence of an indentation between LMt3 and LMt1+2 in Crepititermitinae are reminiscent of the Cubitermitinae, but the former can be distinguished by: the presence of a columnar belt (of the generalised type) in the gizzard (absent in Cubitermitinae); P1 tubular (P1 inflated in Cubitermitinae); the absence of intermediate cushions on the enteric valve armature (intermediate cushions present in Cubitermitinae; see Supplementary Fig. 4j, k); and the blind diverticulum on P3 occurring dorsally (ventrally in Cubitermitinae).\n\nRemarks: Crepititermes was previously assigned to the Termes-group. A comprehensive re-description of Crepititermes was provided by Rocha & Cuezzo72. The genus is exclusively Neotropical, with species that feed on humus. Crepititermes workers use an autothysis mechanism that involves the rupture of the upper side of the abdomen, near the junction with the thorax, to expose their sticky gut for colony defence.\n\nSubfamily Cylindrotermitinae Hellemans, Engel, & Bourguignon, subfam. nov\n\nZoobank registration: https://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:DEEDCE51-6696-4C97-BB2E-654EF86C8F9F.\n\nType genus: Cylindrotermes Holmgren73, 1906.\n\nIncluded genera (2): Cephalotermes Silvestri and Cylindrotermes Holmgren.\n\nDiagnosis: Imago-worker left mandible with apical tooth (LAt) roughly equal or shorter than LMt1+2 and LMt3 well-developed. Worker gut with long, P1 tubular, forming a loop ventrally under the rectum (P5). Enteric valve bearing six unequal cushions. Soldier head elongated, subrectangular, devoid of frontal projection, covered by short bristles; mandibles short, robust, of biting/slashing type; weak humps on the frons located immediately between the antennae above the basolateral corners of clypeus. Diagnostic UCE loci are listed in Supplementary Data 7. Diagnostic features are given in Supplementary Fig. 5.\n\nThe Cylindrotermitinae can be differentiated from the Amitermitinae as in the latter, P1 forms a loop ventrally under P5 and P2 occurs on the left side of the abdomen (Fig. 3).\n\nRemarks: The two genera of Cylindrotermitinae were previously assigned to the Amitermes-group sensu Krishna et al.7. Cylindrotermitinae are wood-feeding termite genera from separate biogeographic regions: Cephalotermes is Afrotropical, while Cylindrotermes is Neotropical. Cephalotermes builds mounds, and forms populous colonies with few soldiers, headed by one king and one extremely physogastric queen that loses the ability to crawl as the colony matures (J. Šobotník, pers. obs.). Cylindrotermes are found in dead wood and form small colonies.\n\nSubfamily Forficulitermitinae Hellemans, Engel, & Bourguignon, subfam. nov\n\nZoobank registration: https://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:429D8F1D-1D78-44AD-BF91-4AAE9492251F.\n\nType genus: Forficulitermes Emerson74, 1960.\n\nIncluded genera: monogeneric.\n\nDiagnosis: Imago-worker right mandible with well-developed second marginal tooth (RMt2). Worker gut with four Malpighian tubules attached in pairs at the junction of the mixed segment. Soldier head subquadrangular with fontanelle located in a small depression, with two flat longitudinal ridges located in front of the opening on each side and forming a faint groove-like structure leading to the base of the clypeus; small, elevated humps on each side between the fontanelle and antennal base; mandibles elongate and slender, without marginal teeth, used to bite and unable to snap; apical margin of the labrum with medioapical convexity and sharply pointed apicolateral angles. Diagnostic features are given in Supplementary Fig. 8.\n\nThe Forficulitermitinae can be distinguished from termitines in their newly restricted circumscription by the absence of a Malpighian nodule (generally present in Termitinae sensu novo). In addition, the soldier mandibles are elongated and not of snapping type, while in Termitinae the mandibles are generally snapping (except in three genera with biting/slashing mandibles: Divinotermes, Spinitermes, and Tuberculitermes). Lastly, the soldier head has a faint groove running from the fontanelle, which sits in a shallow depression, to the clypeal base and with small humps on either side of the channel between the fontanelle and the antennal toruli, while termitines lack such a groove, depression, or lateral humps and instead have a medial frontal prominence of varying degrees of development.\n\nRemarks: Forficulitermes was previously assigned to the Termes-group sensu Krishna et al.7. It is an exclusively Afrotropical genus, including species that feed on soil. A comprehensive re-description of Forficulitermes was provided by Scheffrahn & Křeček75.\n\nSubfamily Microcerotermitinae Holmgren, stat. nov\n\nMicrocerotermitinae Holmgren76, 1910: 145.\n\nType genus: Microcerotermes Silvestri64, 1901.\n\nIncluded genera (2): Microcerotermes Silvestri and Onkotermes Constantino.\n\nDiagnosis: Imago-worker left mandible with third marginal tooth (LMt3) well developed, right mandible with posterior margin of LMt2 long and straight. Worker gut with a conspicuous Malpighian knot; junction of the mixed segment with P1 constricted and elbowed, not fully visible in ventral view; P1 tubular, dilated anteriorly, constricted posteriorly at the connection with P2 on the left side of the abdomen, without loop ventrally. P2 is constricted and poorly ornamented. Soldier devoid of frontal projection, head generally long and narrow. Imago head subrectangular. Diagnostic UCE loci are listed in Supplementary Data 7. Diagnostic features are given in Supplementary Fig. 10.\n\nMicrocerotermitines are similar to Amitermitinae but have P1 inserted on P3 on the left side of the abdomen rather than the right in the latter clade (Fig. 3). In addition, the soldier head of Microcerotermitinae is subrectangular rather than the pear-shaped form of Amitermitinae.\n\nRemarks: Species of this group were previously assigned to the Amitermes-group but were found to consistently form a sister relationship with Syntermitinae. The microcerotermitines are pantropical wood feeders (sensu lato: wood and grass).\n\nSubfamily Mirocapritermitinae Kemner, stat. nov\n\nMirocapritermitinae Kemner69, 1934: 166.\n\nType genus: Mirocapritermes Holmgren76, 1914.\n\nIncluded genera (14): Dicuspiditermes Krishna, Homallotermes John, Indocapritermes Chhotani, Kemneritermes Ahmad & Akhtar, Krishnacapritermes Chhotani, Labiocapritermes Krishna, Mirocapritermes Holmgren, Oriencapritermes Ahmad & Akhtar, Pericapritermes Silvestri, Procapritermes Holmgren, Pseudocapritermes Kemner, Rinacapritermes Amina & Rajmohana, Sinocapritermes Ping & Xu, and Syncapritermes Ahmad & Akhtar.\n\nDiagnosis: Imago-worker right mandible with anterior margin of RMt2 convex or straight, posterior margin concave. Worker gut with Malpighian tubules attached in two separate pairs fused proximally, devoid of Malpighian nodules. Soldiers with rectangular heads and snapping mandibles are generally asymmetrical (symmetrical in some species of Procapritermes). Soldier head devoid of frontal projection (except in Mirocapritermes). Diagnostic UCE loci are listed in Supplementary Data 7. Diagnostic features are given in Supplementary Fig. 11.\n\nMirocapritermitinae can be distinguished from the termitines in their restricted sense by the absence of a Malpighian nodule (present in Termitinae sensu novo) and the absence of a frontal projection (generally present in Termitinae). In the imago-worker mandible, RMt2 is distinctly present and with a concave posterior margin, while it is absent or vestigial with a straight posterior margin in Termitinae sensu novo.\n\nRemarks: Mirocapritermitinae include species previously assigned to the Pericapritermes-group. Their distribution is restricted to the Oriental region, with the exception of Pericapritermes, which is also found in the Australian, Afrotropical, Palaearctic (Sino-Japanese), and Oceanian regions. Mirocapritermitines feed on soil or at the soil-wood interface.\n\nSubfamily Neocapritermitinae Hellemans, Engel, & Bourguignon, subfam. nov\n\nZoobank registration: https://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:B9567537-33EF-4B4D-992F-34E0C16B8701.\n\nType genus: Neocapritermes Holmgren25, 1912.\n\nIncluded genera (3): Neocapritermes Holmgren, Planicapritermes Emerson, and Schievitermes Roisin.\n\nDiagnosis: Imago-worker left mandible with apical tooth (LAt) shorter than LMt1+2; right mandible with RMt2 slightly reduced, posterior margin straight. Worker gut with two pairs of Malpighian tubules fused anteriorly and inserted in a single point at the mixed segment junction, devoid of Malpighian nodule; mixed segment long, distally bilobed into mesenteric sacs in Neocapritermes and Schievitermes (see Roisin77); junction of the mixed segment with P1 constricted and elbowed; P3 inflated, with wall bearing numerous spines. Soldiers with asymmetrical snapping mandibles and subrectangular heads devoid of frontal projection. Diagnostic UCE loci are listed in Supplementary Data 7. Diagnostic features are given in Supplementary Fig. 13.\n\nLike the Termitinae, the imago-worker mandible has RMt2 reduced and with a straight posterior margin but can be distinguished by the absence of a Malpighian nodule (present in Termitinae sensu novo) and the absence of a frontal prominence on the soldier head (generally present to varying degrees in Termitinae). The Neocapritermitinae differ from the Old World Mirocapritermitinae in three ways: the posterior margin of RMt2 is straight (rather than concave in mirocapritermitines); the molar area has distinct ridges (molar area smooth to faint and reduced striations in mirocapritermitines); the enteric valve armature is composed of three folds (six in mirocapritermitines). The Neocapritermitinae exhibit an elbowed midgut-P1 junction as the Microcerotermitinae but can be distinguished by their soldiers (snapping in Neocapritermitinae, piercing/slashing in Microcerotermitinae).\n\nRemarks: The species of Neocapritermitinae were previously assigned to the Termes-group. The subfamily is exclusively Neotropical, with species that feed on decayed wood or at the wood-soil interface.\n\nSubfamily Promirotermitinae Hellemans, Engel, & Bourguignon, subfam. nov\n\nZoobank registration: https://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:1F08A9B3-6F94-498C-A8B4-78ABF508FDA6.\n\nType genus: Promirotermes Silvestri78, 1914.\n\nIncluded genera (2): Angulitermes Sjöstedt and Promirotermes Silvestri.\n\nDiagnosis: Imago-worker right mandible with well-developed RMt2. Worker gut with two pairs of Malpighian tubules fused in a common base. Soldier head is subrectangular to egg-shaped (Promirotermes), with symmetrical snapping mandibles and either a pointed frontal projection (Angulitermes) or a blunt frontal hump (Promirotermes). Diagnostic features are given in Supplementary Fig. 14.\n\nThe subfamily can be distinguished from Termitinae sensu novo by its imago-worker mandible with well-developed RMt2, which is otherwise absent or at least considerably reduced in termitines. The subfamily is most easily distinguished from Amitermitinae by its subrectangular soldier heads with a frontal process (generally absent in Amitermitinae) and bifurcate labrum (rounded, or with slightly pointed tips in Amitermitinae).\n\nRemarks: The species of this group were previously assigned to the Termes-group (sensu Krishna et al.7) and are humus-feeders. Promirotermes is exclusively Afrotropical, while Angulitermes is also distributed across the Oriental region, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nSubfamily Protohamitermitinae Hellemans, Engel, & Bourguignon, subfam. nov\n\nZoobank registration: https://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:2C4DDA82-D86C-40CA-BCB9-F5CD5AA60E7B.\n\nType genus: Protohamitermes Holmgren25, 1912.\n\nIncluded genera (2): Orientotermes Ahmad and Protohamitermes Holmgren.\n\nDiagnosis: Imago-worker right mandible with well-developed subsidiary tooth at the base of the first and second marginal teeth (RMt1 and RMt2), with anterior margin angular and posterior margin curved. Worker gut with two pairs of Malpighian tubules connected to the mixed segment by two nodules, one for each pair; with long, tubular ileum (P1), forming a loop ventrally under the rectum (P5) (as in Cylindrotermitinae and part of the Apicotermitinae). Diagnostic features are given in Supplementary Fig. 15.\n\nThe Protohamitermitinae can be distinguished from the Amitermitinae by the presence of a long P1 that loops ventrally under P5 (ventral loop absent in Amitermitinae) and by the presence of a subsidiary tooth on the right imago-worker mandible (absent in Amitermitinae). The subfamily differs from Cylindrotermitinae by the presence of the subsidiary tooth and the absence of soldiers.\n\nRemarks: The Protohamitermitinae include two Oriental soldierless species feeding on wood. They were previously assigned to the Amitermes-group sensu Krishna et al.7. Although the type-genus Protohamitermes was not included in our analyses, its relationship with Orientotermes is known from previous phylogenetic analyses3.\n\nSubfamily Termitinae Latreille, sensu novo\n\nTermitina Latreille80, 1802: 293. Type genus: Termes Linnaeus81.\n\nMirotermitini Weidner82, 1956: 99. Type genus: Mirotermes Wasmann83, 1897 [= Termes Linnaeus81, 1758].\n\nCapritermitini Weidner82, 1956: 100. Type genus: Capritermes Wasmann83, 1897.\n\nType genus: Termes Linnaeus81, 1758\n\nIncluded genera (23): Apsenterotermes Miller, Capritermes Wasmann, Cavitermes Emerson, Cornicapritermes Emerson, Cristatitermes Miller, Dihoplotermes Araujo, Divinotermes Carrijo & Cancello, Ekphysotermes Miller, Ephelotermes Miller, Hapsidotermes Miller, Hesperotermes Gay, Inquilinitermes Mathews, Lophotermes Miller, Macrognathotermes Silvestri, Palmitermes Hellemans & Roisin, Paracapritermes Hill, Protocapritermes Holmgren, Quasitermes Emerson, Saxatilitermes Miller, Spinitermes Wasmann, Termes Linnaeus, Tuberculitermes Holmgren, and Xylochomitermes Miller.\n\nDiagnosis: Imago-worker right mandible with RMt2 reduced or absent and posterior margin straight. Left mandible with apical tooth (LAt) longer or slightly shorter than LMt1+2. Worker gut with two pairs of Malpighian tubules attached on a nodule connected to the mixed segment. P2 is on the left side of the abdomen (except in Cornicapritermes, whose P1 forms a ventral loop and P2 is on the right; M.M. Rocha and T.F. Carrijo, pers. obs.). Soldiers with head subrectangular, a frontal prominence varying in size among genera, and snapping mandibles, except in Divinotermes and Spinitermes, which exhibit biting/slashing mandibles; and Tuberculitermes, which has snapping/slashing mandibles (A. Buček, pers. obs.). Diagnostic UCE loci are listed in Supplementary Data 7. Diagnostic features are given in Supplementary Fig. 18. Additional diagnoses are provided in the systematic sections of Promirotermitinae, Neocapritermitinae, Mirocapritermitinae, and Forficulitermitinae (above).\n\nRemarks: The Termitinae have a pantropical distribution, found in the Afrotropical, Australian, Neotropical, Oceanian and Oriental regions. Termitinae comprises species feeding on diverse substrates, including soil, mounds, wood, and the soil-wood interface.\n\nBiological samples and sequencing\n\nWe gathered genome assemblies of 135 termites and three wood-feeding subsocial cockroaches from the genus Cryptocercus to reconstruct the phylogenies. We used previously published UCE datasets44,87, which we supplemented with sequences of 56 samples (see Supplementary Data 1). Our dataset includes representative species from all genera of Rhinotermitidae sensu lato and every subfamily of Termitidae, including all the new subfamilies described here. Within the Termitidae, we included representatives of all termitine lineages that arose shortly after the origin of the first Termitinae.\n\nAll samples reported in this study were housed in collections, and no new field collection was performed. Specimens from collections were obtained in accordance with local and worldwide regulations at the time of their collection. Specifically, this involved the terms of the following permits: Australia, no sampling permits required; Bolivia, No. MMAyA-VMABCCGDF-DGBAP No. 1052/2013; Brazil, No. IBAMA #144/2010 and SISBIO #40673; Cameroon, No. 000000010/MINRESI/B00/C00/C10/C12 and No. 00000075/MINRESI/B00/C00/C10/C12; Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), collections permitted under Belgian Science Policy (BELSPO) institutional project COBIMFO (2010–2015), as well as during the Boyekoli-Ebale-Congo Expedition in 2010 (organised by: the University of Kisangani (DRC), the Royal Museum of Central Africa (Tervuren, Belgium), the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, the National Botanical Garden of Belgium; supported by: the Belgian Development Cooperation, BELSPO); Ecuador, No. 06-2011-FAU-DPAP-MA; French Guiana, No. TREL1902817S/136; Israel, no permits required; Ivory Coast, permits granted for protected areas (Taï, Marahoué, Comoé, Banco) by Office Ivoirien des Parcs et Réserves; Kenya, No. NACOSTI/P/15/7983/7214; Madagascar, No. 035/19/MEDD/SG/DGF/DSAP/SCB.Re and No. 202-19/MEDD/SG/DIREDD.AATS.ANS.AND; Martinique, no permits required; Mexico, permits provided to the late Paul M. Ban in 1996; Panama, No. SEX/A-36-10; Paraguay, permits provided to Rudolf Scheffrahn through the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural del Paraguay in 2012; Peru, Carta No. 592-2014-MINAGRI-DGFFS/DGEFFS; Singapore, No. NP/RP12-063a; Thailand, sampling carried out through the Khao Chong Insect Laboratory; USA, no permits required; Venezuela, permits provided to Rudolf Scheffrahn in 2008.\n\nSamples were either preserved in 80–100% ethanol and stored at room temperature or preserved in RNA-later®, initially stored for up to several weeks at room temperature, and subsequently at temperatures varying between − 20 °C and − 80 °C. Whole genomic DNA extraction was performed using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue extraction kit (Qiagen). Tissue samples were disrupted in 2 mL microtubes using two 3 mm steel beads and the TissueLyser II (Qiagen). Library preparation was achieved using the NEBNext® UltraTM II FS DNA Library Preparation Kit (New England Biolabs) and the Unique Dual Indexing Kit (New England Biolabs), with reagent volumes reduced to one-fifteenth of recommended volumes. Because the DNA of samples preserved in ~ 80% ethanol at room temperature is typically highly fragmented, the incubation time of the enzymatic fragmentation step was set to a maximum of five minutes. This duration ensures a proper end repair, 5´ phosphorylation and dA-tailing, but limits any further significant fragmentation. Concentrations of final libraries were measured with a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen) using the QubitTM 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen). The fragment size distribution of libraries was assessed with a 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent) using the High Sensitivity D1000 Kit (Agilent). Libraries were pooled in equimolar concentration, and paired-end reads were generated using the NovaSeq 6000 and HiSeq X Illumina platforms at a read length of 150 bp.\n\nGenome assemblies and extraction of UCEs\n\nRaw reads were quality-trimmed using fastp v0.20.188 and assembled with metaSPAdes v3.1389. We extracted the core UCEs from these draft assemblies with flanking 200 bp at both 5’ and 3’ ends (~ 600 bp loci) using PHYLUCE v1.6.690 and LASTZ91. We used the termite-specific bait set targeting 50,616 loci published by Hellemans et al.44. The species identification codes (“File 1: ids_to_species.txt”) and UCE dataset produced in this study (“File 2: TER_UCE_DB_CONTRIB_4.fasta.gz”) are available on the Dryad Digital Repository, at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.02v6wwqbm. This paper represents Contribution #4 to the Termite UCE Database, available at: https://github.com/oist/TER-UCE-DB/.\n\nAlignments and supermatrices\n\nExtracted UCEs were combined in a total of seven supermatrices (see below) used for subsequent phylogenetic analyses. All UCE loci were aligned with MAFFT92, as implemented in phyluce_align_seqcap_align. Alignments were either trimmed internally using phyluce_align_get_gblocks_trimmed_alignments_from_untrimmed that implements Gblocks93,94 with default parameters or only edge-trimmed with phyluce_align_seqcap_align. Loci absent in more than 30% of taxa were filtered out using phyluce_align_get_only_loci_with_min_taxa.\n\nWe assessed the compositional bias of each locus after both internal- and edge-trimming treatments (3234 and 3233 loci, respectively) to identify low-quality and rogue loci. We computed the relative composition frequency variability (RCFV) and its normalised version (nRCFV) using RCFV_Reader v195. Chi-square tests of nucleotide homogeneity were performed with BaCoCa v1.10596. None of the internally trimmed loci significantly deviated from homogeneity, while five edge-trimmed loci did (at the default α = 0.01; for details, see Supplementary Data 2, 3). However, the nRCFV values of these five loci were below 0.005, indicating the deviations from base composition homogeneity were marginal. Consequently, we kept all loci in our analyses.\n\nFrom the internally trimmed alignments, we constructed three supermatrices using phyluce_align_format_nexus_files_for_raxml: the unfiltered, cogenic, and intergenic datasets. The cogenic and intergenic datasets were obtained using the functional annotation of UCEs from the GFF file (NCBI Annotation Release 100) accompanying the draft genome of the archotermopsid Zootermopsis nevadensis (GCF_000696155)97. The cogenic dataset consisted of merged non-overlapping UCEs (from the pool of the 40,966 singly annotated UCEs) occurring within the same gene.\n\nFrom the edge-trimmed alignments, we constructed four supermatrices using the loci coding for proteins along their full length. The position of the UCE loci and their strand orientation was determined by mapping Z. nevadensis loci (TER-4-UCEDB) against their corresponding genome (accession GCF_000696155) and GFF annotation file (NCBI Annotation Release 100) using BLASTn v2.10.0+ and bedtools v2.29.298. The reading frame and corresponding amino acid sequences were identified and retrieved using the transeq function of EMBOSS v6.6.099. We constructed two datasets by filtering out sequences with stop codons: one retaining all loci and the other retaining only loci displaying fewer than three stop codons. For each dataset, we aligned the protein sequences of each locus with MAFFT v7.305 and back-translated the protein alignments into codon alignments with PAL2NAL v14100. Subsequent analyses were carried out on both the protein and the codon matrices for each dataset (i.e., four supermatrices). All concatenated sequence supermatrices are described in Supplementary Data 4 and provided in the Dryad Digital Repository (“File 3: supermatrices.tar”), at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.02v6wwqbm.\n\nPhylogenetic reconstructions\n\nWe reconstructed 51 phylogenetic trees using diverse models and two main approaches: (1) maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses performed on concatenated sequence data and (2) multi-species coalescence analyses, which infer the species tree by summarising a collection of maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees constructed for each UCE locus.\n\nA total of 30 maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using IQ-TREE v1.6.12101 on concatenated sequence data with 1000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates (UFB) to assess branch supports102. A summary of the parameters used for all 30 analyses performed in this study is available in Supplementary Data 5. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using nucleotide, codon, or protein sequences. We either used the best-fit substitution model selected with the Bayesian Information Criterion using ModelFinder103 implemented in IQ-TREE or directly specified one of several predefined substitution models. Briefly, we used a GTR + F + I + G4 nucleotide substitution model on five types of nucleotide alignments: unfiltered, cogenic, intergenic, and protein-coding with and without third codon positions. For alignments of protein-coding nucleotide sequences, we used the empirical ECMK07 + FU model and the mechanistic GY2K + F and MG2K + F3X4 codon models104. For amino acid alignments, we used the improved general amino acid replacement matrix (LG) LG + F + G4 alone and combined with a C20 mixture of profiles (LG + C20 + F + G)105,106, the revised Dayhoff matrix (DCMut)107, and the insect-based Q matrix (Q.insect)108,109. The models were either applied to the unpartitioned supermatrix or the loci-partitioned supermatrix by examining the top 10% of partitioning schemes using the fast relaxed clustering approach110,111. For each reconstruction, we used RogueNaRok v1.0.1-3112 to identify potential rogue taxa based on their bootstrap tree sets.\n\nAs maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees reconstructed with concatenated data may fail to properly resolve short internodes113, we also ran a total of 21 multi-species coalescence reconstructions with ASTRAL-III v5.7.7114. ASTRAL was run on gene trees reconstructed independently for each locus with IQ-TREE using the same models and parameters as in the analyses on concatenated sequence data (for details, see Supplementary Data 5). For gene tree reconstructions, we used the option “-czb” to allow polytomies and reduce gene tree biases. To control for poor-quality loci and rogue taxa, we ran all ASTRAL analyses once more after pruning outliers (at quantile 0.05) independently in each gene tree with TreeShrink v1.3.9115. Local posterior probabilities (LPPs) estimated from gene tree quartet frequencies116 were calculated as branch support values for each tree.\n\nAll phylogenetic trees reconstructed in this study are provided in the Dryad Digital Repository (“File 4: trees.tar”), at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.02v6wwqbm. We used phytools117 implemented in R v4.0.2118 to generate 50% majority rule consensus summary trees, independently for analyses performed on concatenated sequence data and for coalescence analyses (with or without pruning by TreeShrink). Branch support values are UFBs and LPPs for concatenation and coalescence analyses, respectively. We also calculated site concordance factors (sCFs) as an alternative branch support metric50. sCFs are defined as the percentage of decisive alignment sites supporting a branch. Branches with sCFs > 50% (i.e., supported by a majority of alignment sites) are considered robust. We calculated sCFs on each consensus tree with IQ-TREE using the option “-scf” and the unfiltered supermatrix. Finally, we assessed alternative topologies for unresolved interfamilial nodes using the approximately unbiased (AU) test119. The tests were performed with IQ-TREE, using the unfiltered supermatrix as data input and 10,000 resampling estimated log-likelihood (RELL) replicates (option “-zb 10000”). Alternative topologies were tested against the majority rule consensus tree summarising the 30 analyses performed on concatenated sequence data.\n\nNomenclatural acts\n\nThis published work and the nomenclatural acts it contains have been registered in ZooBank, the proposed online registration system for the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN).
