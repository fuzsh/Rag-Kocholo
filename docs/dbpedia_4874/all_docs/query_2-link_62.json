        "text": "After weeks of speculation and anticipation, many of the names of former associates, employees, friends and victims of deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have been released.\n\nThe names were unsealed from a lawsuit filed by Virginia Giuffre, an alleged trafficking victim, against British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend. Maxwell, 61, is serving a 20-year prison sentence after she was convicted in December 2021 of helping Epstein recruit and sexually abuse underage girls.\n\nMany of those whose names appear in the documents released Wednesday aren't accused of wrongdoing or have been mentioned previously in legal proceedings or news accounts. The documents released Wednesday are not an Epstein \"client list.\"\n\nIn December, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska found no legal justification for continuing to withhold the names of as many as 175 individuals allegedly connected with Epstein, ordering the unsealing to begin from January 1.\n\nHere are the contents of the documents released Wednesday in Giuffre v. Maxwell by the Southern District of New York\n\nNearly 90 names were included in the documents, with four redacted.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell\n\nVirginia Lee Roberts Giuffre\n\nKathy Alexander\n\nMiles Alexander\n\nJames Michael Austrich\n\nPhilip Barden\n\nREDACTED\n\nCate Blanchett\n\nDavid Boies\n\nLaura Boothe\n\nEvelyn Boulet\n\nRebecca Boylan\n\nJoshua Bunner\n\nNaomi Campbell\n\nCarolyn Casey\n\nPaul Cassell\n\nSharon Churcher\n\nBill Clinton\n\nDavid Copperfield\n\nAlexandra Cousteau\n\nCameron Diaz\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio\n\nAlan Dershowitz\n\nDr. Mona Devanesan\n\nREDACTED\n\nBradley Edwards\n\nAmanda Ellison\n\nCimberly Espinosa\n\nJeffrey Epstein\n\nAnnie Farmer\n\nMarie Farmer\n\nAlexandra Fekkai\n\nCrystal Figueroa\n\nAnthony Figueroa\n\nLouis Freeh\n\nEric Gany\n\nMeg Garvin\n\nSheridan Gibson-Butte\n\nRobert Giuffre\n\nAl Gore\n\nRoss Gow\n\nFred Graff\n\nPhilip Guderyon\n\nREDACTED\n\nShannon Harrison\n\nStephen Hawking\n\nVictoria Hazel\n\nBrittany Henderson\n\nBrett Jaffe\n\nMichael Jackson\n\nCarol Roberts Kess\n\nDr. Karen Kutikoff\n\nPeter Listerman\n\nGeorge Lucas\n\nTony Lyons\n\nBob Meister\n\nJamie A.

Maxwell.\n\nClick here to read Ghislaine Maxwell's disclosures in Giuffre v. Maxwell.\n\nClick here to read the documents in full.\n\nWhat to know about the release of this trove of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents\n\nPreska's order on Dec. 18 noted that unsealing is justified due to \"no interests that outweigh the presumption of access\" to the documents.\n\nSome portions of the records will remain confidential, including those identifying people who were children when they were sexually abused by Epstein, who took his own life in August 2019 in a federal prison in Manhattan as he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges.\n\nPreska gave lawyers for each of the people named the opportunity to review the files before they were unsealed and argue in favor of keeping them out of public view.\n\nOne woman, \"Doe 107,\" whose name appears in the records, has been given 30 more days to make arguments to the court as to why her name should stay redacted. On Wednesday, it was announced a second inquiry, by \"Doe 110,\" is currently under review by the court.\n\nThe release of the documents has fueled misinformation this week.\n\nAfter a crack by New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers made Tuesday on ESPN's \"The Pat McAfee Show,\" social media users falsely claimed that late-night host Jimmy Kimmel's name might appear in the documents.\n\nKimmel said in a response on X that he had never met Epstein and that Rodgers' \"reckless words put my family in danger.\"\n\n\"Keep it up and we will debate the facts further in court,\" Kimmel wrote.\n\nA host of prominent figures have been linked to Epstein and Maxwell, including Prince Andrew and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump.\n\nGiuffre alleges that Maxwell arranged for the then 17-year-old to have sex with Epstein and other prominent men, including Prince Andrew. The British royal has denied the allegations and settled with Giuffre out of court in February 2022.\n\nGiuffre also alleges she was directed to have sex with former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, the late fashion and modeling director Jean-Luc Brunel, billionaire hedge fund manager Glenn Dubin, and the then governor of New Mexico, Bill Richardson.\n\nBloomberg reported in August 2019 that Richardson, who passed away in September 2023, said he had never met Giuffre. The outlet reported that he called the allegations \"completely false\" and said that during his limited interactions with Epstein, he had never seen him in the presence of underage girls.\n\nIn the same article, Mitchell told Bloomberg in a statement that the allegation is false. He said he never met, spoke with, or had contact with Giuffre, or knew of or suspected that Epstein had inappropriate conduct with underage girls.\n\nDubin and his wife, Eva, called the allegations \"demonstrably false and defamatory.\" In an emailed statement to Bloomberg, also in August 2019, a spokeswoman added: \"The Dubins have flight records and other evidence that definitively disprove that any such events occurred.\"\n\nNewsweek has contacted Mitchell via email for comment.\n\nClinton has maintained that he did not have any contact with Epstein after he was accused of sex crimes, and never visited his private island of Little St. James in the U.S. Virgin Islands. There is no indication that the sealed records contain sign of any wrongdoing on Clinton's part.\n\nA spokesperson for the former president previously reiterated his July 2019 statement to Newsweek.\n\n\"President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York,\" the statement said.\n\nThe statement confirmed Clinton had flown on Epstein's plane along with his staff and added, \"He's not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade, and has never been to Little St. James island.\"\n\nDuring Maxwell's 2021 trial, it was revealed that Trump had flown several times on Epstein's jet, dubbed the \"Lolita Express,\" in the 1990s."
