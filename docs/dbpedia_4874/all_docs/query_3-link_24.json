        "text": "Term Paper: The major assignment of this course is to write a term paper. For this paper, you will attempt to address a topic related to the correctional system. As part of this task, you should be able to cover three major themes in your paper. First, you will describe a problem within the correctional system (e.g., effective prison-based drug treatment). Secondly, you should write about the tactics that have been employed in the past to combat such problems and discuss the strengths and weaknesses for each of these approaches. The final element of this paper should be the policy implications and/or future impact this will have on the correctional field. The term paper should include the following sections: 1. Title page 2. Statement of the problem 3. Discussion on current tactics/strategies 4. Future policy and research implications 5. References Page guidelines for the paper are 8-10 pages (excluding title page and references). All sources will need to be properly cited (in APA format). The guideline for the minimum number of references required is 20 scholarly sources (e.g., peer reviewed journals). All papers should be typed and double-spaced. I recommend Times 12 point font (or similar). Margins should be 1 inch. Please turn in an electronic copy of your assignment. The final paper is worth 80 points. Note due dates are indicated on the weekly course schedule below.\n\nResearch articles are also often known as scientific or peer-reviewed articles. If the article is NOT written by the person or group who did the research, it is NOT a peer-reviewed or scientific article. Research articles are important for knowing what new discoveries have been made. This is why it is important to use recent articles, since they will be the first things published on a new scientific development.\n\nHere's a quick overview of how to identify these journal articles:\n\nwritten by the scientist(s) who actually did the research\n\nfollows a specific format\n\nabstract\n\nintroduction\n\nmaterials & methods\n\nresults\n\nconclusions\n\nreferences\n\nassumes reader already knows background information about the topic has been evaluated by experts\n\nTip: Look for a statement about when the article was accepted for publication. Most peer-reviewed articles will include one.\n\nPopular press articles are also often known as non-scientific articles. They are most useful for very current or general information.\n\nHere's a quick overview of how to identify these articles:\n\nabout current events, opinions, and general information\n\ninclude color photos and everyday product advertisements\n\nwritten by journalists/reporters, staff or freelance writers\n\neasy to understand writing\n\nPopular press articles are often published as a reaction to a research article, making the information available to the general public.\n\nA title page is required for all APA Style papers, unless noted otherwise by your professor. Students should follow the guidelines of their instructor when determining which title page format is most appropriate to use. If not instructed otherwise, students should include the following elements on the title page.\n\nNOTE: Student title pages do not require a running head, unlike a professional title page.\n\nTitle\n\nName\n\nUniversity attended, including department or division\n\nCourse number and name\n\nInstructor name\n\nAssignment due date\n\nParaphrasing\n\nWhen the author's name appears in the sentence, it does not need to be repeated in the citation.\n\nExample:\n\nRecent literature has examined long-run price drifts following initial public offerings and other factors (Luna, 2020).\n\nLuna (2020) reaches more or less the same conclusion.\n\nTwo or more sources within same parentheses\n\nOrder the citations of two or more works by different authors within the same parentheses alphabetically in the same order in which they appear in the reference list (including citations that would otherwise shorten to et al.). Separate the citations with semicolons.\n\nExample:\n\nSeveral studies (Adams et al., 2019; Shumway & Shulman, 2015; Westinghouse, 2017))...\n\nQuotations\n\nExample:\n\nFor people with osteoarthritis, \"painful joints should be moved through a full range of motion every day to maintain flexibility and to slow deterioration of cartilage\" (Flores, 2019, p. 20).\n\n(Gecht-Silver & Duncombe, 2015, p. 210)\n\nMore than three authors\n\nExample:\n\n(Smith et al., 2014, p. 203)\n\nNo author\n\n(Title Page #)\n\nExample:\n\n(Plagiarism and You 1942)\n\n(\"Five Ways to Protect Yourself\" 1993)\n\nNo page number\n\nBecause the material does not include page numbers, you can include any of the following in the text to cite the quotation:\n\nA paragraph number, if provided; alternatively, you could count paragraphs down from the beginning of the document.\n\nAn overarching heading plus a paragraph number within that section.\n\nA short title in quotation marks, in cases in which the heading is too unwieldy to cite in full.\n\nExample:\n\n(Anderson, 2013, para. 1).\n\nStart the reference list on a new page after the txt and before any tables, figures, and/or appendices. Label the reference list \"References,\" capitalized, in bold, and centered.\n\nDouble-space all reference list entries (including between and within references).\n\nUse a hanging indent for all references, meaning that the first line of each reference is flush left and subsequent lines are indented by 0.5 in.\n\nWorks are listed in alphabetical order by the last name of the first listed author.\n\nLast name, Initials. (Year). Article title, sentence style capitalization. Journal title, volume(issue, if available), pages. URL, if no DOI available\n\nExample:\n\nAhmann, E. (2018).

Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 77(3), 437-471. http://doi.org/fg6rf9\n\nIf a conference paper has been published (for example, in a proceedings), the published form is usually either a chapter of an edited book or an article in a journal.\n\nPapers published in conference proceedings, book\n\nLast name, Initials.

As with court decisions, statutes exist on both the federal and state levels, such as an act by Congress or by a state government.\n\nName of Act, Title Source Â§ Section Number (Year). URL\n\nExample:\n\nEvery Student Succeeds Act, 20 U.S.C. Â§ 6301 (2015). https://www.congress.gov/114/plaws/publ95/PLAW-114publ95.pdf\n\nIn-Text Citation\n\nThe in-text citation format for a federal statute is similar to that for other APA Style references. Cite the name of the statute and the year.\n\nExample:\n\nFamily and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (2006)\n\n(Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 2006)\n\nAuthor or organization name.

We view writing as a process that involves planning, reading, drafting, revising, and editingâ€”writing with substance involves discovering your meaning through brainstorming, sharing, and getting lots of feedback.\n\nTutors help you gain a fresh perspective on the writing process, and can assist with any stage of the process: choosing a topic or working through writer's block, generating ideas, creating an outline, sharpening a thesis, arranging and organizing paragraphs, citing correctly and fluently, editing grammar and mechanics, and more.\n\nInstructors receive a copy of the tutor report completed during the session, to illustrate your engagement with the writing process and meeting the demands of writing across disciplines.\n\nServices are on a walk-in basis, so no appointment is necessary. Schedules are posted in the Writing Center, on Inside DelVal, and on professors' Blackboard course pages.\n\nTutors look forward to working with you!"
