        "text": "Academic degrees are capitalized only when the full name of the degree is used, such as Bachelor of Arts or Master of Science. General references, such as bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degree, are not capitalized. Use an apostrophe (possessive) with bachelor’s degree and master’s degree, but not in Bachelor of Arts or Master of Science. Do not use an apostrophe with associate degree or doctoral degree. Do not capitalize the discipline specialty unless it is a proper noun or it is part of a recognized degree name (such as MBA and MSAT).\n\nassociate degree\n\nbachelor's degree\n\nmaster's degree\n\ndoctoral degree\n\nBachelor of Arts in English\n\nBachelor of Science in chemistry\n\nMaster of Business Administration\n\nAbbreviations such as BA, MS, and PhD should be used in text only when there is a need to identify many people by academic degree and use of the full names would be cumbersome. Note: Do not use periods in these abbreviations.\n\nIn most writing, use of the general terms bachelor’s or bachelor’s degree; master’s or master’s degree; and doctorate or doctoral degree are preferred to use of the full name of the degree or initials.\n\nOnly those with an MD are referred to as Dr. and then only on first reference.\n\nWhen listing names of alumni, the bachelor's is the default and needs no letter next to the year. Include “A” for associate, “M” for master's, and “D” for doctoral.\n\nJoe Smith ’73\n\nMary Jones A’90, ’92, M’99\n\nOmit periods in abbreviations of academic degrees, unless required for tradition or consistency. For example, the University catalog has always used periods to abbreviate degrees in the faculty listings.\n\nExcept for languages such as English and Spanish, the names of academic disciplines, majors, and minors are not proper nouns and should not be capitalized.\n\nAcademic degrees are capitalized only when the full name of the degree is used, such as Bachelor of Arts or Master of Engineering. General references, such as bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree, are not capitalized. Use an apostrophe (possessive) with bachelor’s degree and master’s degree, but not in Bachelor of Arts or Master of Science. Do not use an apostrophe with associate degree or doctoral degree. Do not capitalize the major or academic discipline unless it is part of the formal degree name.\n\nBachelor of Arts in communication, Bachelor of Science in biology\n\nbachelor’s degree in communication, master’s degree in English\n\nMaster of Science in Accounting and Taxation (formal degree name)\n\nSeparate parts of a sentence.\n\nEm Dash\n\nThe em dash is perhaps the most versatile of punctuation marks. It can be used in sentences to create a strong break, to show emphasis, or to denote a change in thought. Depending on the context, the em dash can take the place of commas, parentheses, or colons. Many confuse the em dash for the slightly narrower en dash or the even narrower hyphen.\n\nShe likes all kinds of music—classical, jazz, country, and rock.\n\nMatt joined the company a month before it went public—and long before it became the billion dollar giant it is today.\n\nThe em dash can be created by holding down the ALT key and typing 0151 on the numeric keypad (right side of the keyboard). Macintosh users, press Shift-Option and the minus key at the same time.\n\nEn Dash\n\nThe en dash is used to represent a span or range of numbers, dates, or time. There should be no space between the en dash and the adjacent material. Depending on the context, the en dash is read as “to” or “through.”\n\nThe president's term was 1960–64.\n\nHawktober Weekend will be held Oct. 14–16.\n\nThe en dash can be created by holding down the ALT key and typing 0150 on the numeric keypad (right side of the keyboard). Macintosh users, press the option and minus keys simultaneously.\n\nThe debate over usage of health care is one of the hottest that exists with much confusion over whether health care should be one or two words; require a hyphen when used as a modifier; be used differently depending on whether you are talking about the industry as a whole or the providing of health care; or be based on what part of the world you are in.\n\nIt often leads to one big headache that may require a visit to a health care facility!\n\nWe currently have opted to follow the more focused style guidelines of two important entities representing the fields of medicine and journalism—the American Medical Association and the Associated Press—both indicating that health care be used as two words in all uses, without the need to include a hyphen when using health care as a modifier.\n\nhealth care reform\n\nhealth care professionals\n\nI work in health care.\n\nExceptions: Official proper names of health care organizations (Hartford HealthCare) and approved academic degree program names (Master of Healthcare Administration).\n\nWhen necessary in body copy, a URL (uniform resource locator) or email address may be broken at the end of a line as follows:\n\nAfter a colon or double slash:\n\nhttp://\n\nwww.chicagomanualofstyle.org\n\nBefore a single slash, period, or other punctuation mark or symbol:\n\nhttp://www\n\n.chicagomanualofstyle.org\n\nBetween words or syllables:\n\nhttp://www.chicago\n\nmanualofstyle.org\n\nNever insert a hyphen when breaking a URL or email address that falls at the end of a line. The extraneous punctuation only confuses a valid URL.\n\nIn many cases it is no longer necessary to use http:// or www in web addresses. But be sure to test any URL that will appear online or in a print publication to ensure that the link connects.\n\nDo not omit the period when a web address ends a sentence:\n\nUNotes, the University’s e-newsletter, is available at hartford.edu/daily.\n\nRefrain from using the hackneyed and unnecessary “click on” to direct users to Internet links. URLs are easily recognizable in body copy and generally require no further instruction on accessing them."
