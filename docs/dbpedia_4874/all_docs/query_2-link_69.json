        "text": "Reese Witherspoon, Garth Brooks, Dakota Fanning, and Brad Pitt are just some of the celebrities who go by their middle names. And all were born in, you guessed it, the South.\n\nIf you, too, go by your middle name, you'd probably love the chance to convince any parents who are considering naming their child this way not to. As a middle-nameite myself, I'm all too familiar with the roll-call confusion every first day of school, the mail addressed to two different names, and downright tuning out your first name when it's called at, say, a doctor's office waiting room. (Oh wait, that's me, you think.)\n\nBut how did this inconvenient practice get started in the first place? I was in my early 20s the first time someone suggested it was a \"Southern thing.\" I was out to dinner with a coworker when she spotted my first name on my credit card, inevitably kicking off the same exchange I've had 2,984 times in my life, which goes something like:\n\nFriend: Why did you decide to start going by your middle name?\n\nMe: I didn't. My parents have always called me this.\n\nBut this time, my colleague, who was from New York, informed me that she thought calling children by their middle names was a Southern tradition. I'd lived in the South (Georgia and Texas, to be specific) my whole life up until that point and knew plenty of people who went by their middle names, so I wouldn't have exactly known the difference. (In the South, they're not Southern traditions, they're just...traditions.)\n\nA cursory internet search doesn't return a definitive answer, and neither does there seem to be an expert on the topic, but there's lots of anecdotal evidence to support the theory. The best explanation seems to stem from Southerners' penchant for keeping a name going down the line, especially for males. You end up with John Smith Jr., III, and IV in one family, and calling a child by his middle name is an easy way to distinguish between him and his father. In my family, my grandfather, father, and brother all have the same first name, so my dad and brother are known by their middle names.\n\nIt doesn't help that, as retired Middle Tennessee State sociology professor Ben Austin explained, \"So many generations of families have lived in the same place.\"\n\nBut how does that explain the vast number of Southern women, who presumably weren't named after their mothers, who go by their middle moniker? Psychologist Elisabeth Waugman, Ph.D., writes that Southerners have a tradition of giving girls \"double names\" — Mary Ann, Katherine Leigh, Sarah Beth — which has its roots in the \"mass migration of the Scots and Irish into the South, with large concentrations in Appalachia.\" Both names used together, Waugman explained, have a lyrical \"three beat\" quality, which was \"popular in 19th-century lyric poetry when many European immigrants were coming to the U.S.\"\n\nGarland Pollard, a Virginia native living south of Tampa, Florida, uses his middle name because he is the fourth in a line of men with the same name. \"At least in my family, the middle name was more of an early 20th-century invention,\" says Pollard, the director of communications for the Diocese of Southwest Florida and former editor of Virginia Living magazine. \"Looking at genealogy charts, I seem to have many 19th-century ancestors with only a first and a last name.\"\n\nPollard points out that the use of a middle name, in general, can \"preserve a surname that has disappeared from a bloodline.\" Reese Witherspoon, for example, is Laura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon — Reese is her mother's maiden name.\n\nPollard posits that, because the United States is not a monarchy, people dislike having a number attached to their name, so having the same first name (but not the middle) continue down the family tree makes more sense. The tradition that started with boys probably carried over to girls once it became popular and accepted practice."
