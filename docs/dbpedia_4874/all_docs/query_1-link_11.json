        "text": "Paul’s research interests lie at the intersection of geography, philosophy and social and cultural theory. His work focuses on the development of specifically geographic engagements with phenomenology, post-phenomenology and deconstruction. In the context of contemporary geographic work his work has been associated with the development of 'non-representational' theories.\n\nPaul’s current research has three main themes. First; an focus on the ‘radically passive’ or non-intentional nature of corporeal existence, (for example, vulnerability, susceptibility, suffering, lassitude, sleep, boredom), and the existential, ethical and political significance of these aspects of being a body. Second; an examination of the act of bearing witness or giving testimony to traumatic or so-called ‘unspeakable’ events. Third; an on-going interest in the implications of finitude and mourning for social and political thought.\n\nPaul joined the Geography Department in 2000. He completed his BA (hons) in Geography (1994) at the Department of Geography, University of Liverpool, and an MSc in Society and Space (1996) and PhD (2000) at the School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol."
