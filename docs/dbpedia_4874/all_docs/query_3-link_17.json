        "text": "a period in which the Navy’s size and therefore the school’s input was declining. Through Harrison’s efforts the school was able to retain top faculty personnel, ensure sufficient openings for hiring strong new talent, and meet the strictures of reduced funding.\n\nWhile Harrison outwardly appeared to be a kindly grandfather figure, his incisive method of leadership ensured a detailed knowledge of and impact on all issues associated with instruction, faculty and educational support. He had unusual strengths in the area of informational technology and was able to ensure smart decisions were made concerning computer services and equipment as well as library support. At the personal computer level, Harrison showed an uncommon ability to use various software for combining multiple data sources to compare performance, reveal problems, and evaluate solutions. Harrison was the perfect person to have in the academic leadership position at the school during a time of change and the need to strengthen the school’s capabilities. The results of his efforts played a major role in justifying the retention of the school during the reviews of the early 1990s to close military bases.\n\nproduce results of sufficient accuracy. Description of the correlation energy (defined as the error in the Hartree-Fock energy) using digital computers required a new approach.\n\nWorking with Löwdin, Shull approached this as a problem in numerical analysis rather than a problem in chemistry. They showed that the continuum problem could be avoided by simply expanding in a complete discrete basis set with no physical significance [1955]. They then used this approach to generate an accurate wave function for the helium atom. Factorization of this function into its expansion into Natural Orbitals led to a very compact and easily interpreted result even though the individual terms had no relation to any zero’th order model problem [1955, 1959]. Shull extended this approach to the hydrogen molecule [1959] and then showed how the results could be simply interpreted [1960].\n\nShull and Löwdin extended the helium atom results to the ground and first excited triplet state of the iso-electronic two-electron atomic ion series, H−, He, Li+, etc. [1956]. They were the first to note that the correlation energy of the ground state of these ions is nearly independent of the atomic number, Z. This led Shull to two additional papers. In one, he examined other iso-electronic atomic ion sequences and showed that those which became degenerate in the high-Z limit had correlation energy which was linear in Z, while those that remained non-degenerate had a correlation energy that was nearly independent of Z [1960]. This has been a key paper in constructing accurate tables of atomic energies. In the second, he showed that direct variational calculation of the excited state energy as a higher root of a secular equation could lead to the exact wave function without convergence of the lower states [1958]. Before this it had been assumed that the lower roots would have to be converged in order to get an accurate wave function for the higher state.\n\nThis flurry of key papers profoundly changed the way people approached the electronic structure problem. Before these papers, the problem had been approached using qualitative reasoning or semi-empirical explanations for spectra and bonding. After these papers, the problem was viewed more as a problem in numerical analysis and construction of rapidly converging sequences of approximations. Other research groups around the world with access to digital computers soon adopted this viewpoint."
