        "text": "In March 2024, I wrote a tutorial on Real Python detailing the steps to build a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot using LangChain. The chatbot, formally named the Hospital System Chatbot, uses Neo4j to retrieve data from a synthetic hospital system dataset with information about patients, patient reviews, hospital locations, visits, insurance payers, and physicians.\n\nThe Hospital System Chatbot agent is hosted via FastAPI, and can be accessed through a Streamlit app — all packaged up with Docker Compose:\n\nAll code is available on GitHub, and anyone can read about the project in detail on Real Python.\n\nSince writing the tutorial, I’ve maintained the project on GitHub to improve the Hospital System Chatbot’s capabilities and make it more production-ready. For instance, I’ve added unit tests, refactored code to correct for deprecated features, created deployments with GitHub actions, and most recently integrated dynamic few-shot prompting to improve Cypher query generation."
