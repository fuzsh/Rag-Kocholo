Some of today’s most popular names for boys fit the style, like Jackson, Parker, and Mason. People love them for a variety of reasons, whether they’re looking to honor someone or simply love the fashionable feel that comes with the surname style.\n\nSuper common last names like Smith and Jones make awesome first names, as they’re unexpected and have a bit of a secret agent vibe. Miller, Davis, and Wilson offer the same cool factor if you love the feel. A major plus to using these common names is the lack of spelling and pronunciation issues.\n\nUncommon last names for boys used as first names are popping up more often too to counteract the more common finds like Carter and Cameron. As seen in Everly, a name that’s witnessed a meteoric rise with girls, these are bursting with style that parents can’t get enough of. From these less common picks, we’ve seen Cruz, Hudson, and Harrison rise dramatically in popularity. Picks like Ashby, Landry, and Crosby are on our radar as the next stars to come from this group.\n\nLast names are a great way to honor people you admire, too. Using last names for boys as first names is a clever way to honor a loved one. Say you love Great Uncle Horace, but not his first name. You could uses his surname Evans for the same effect. This is especially popular with musicians, with a spike seen in rock and roll picks like Jagger, Hendrix, and Lennon on the playground. Scientist surnames are great for brainy babes, with Edison and Newton just two awesome options among them. Of course, the most famous last names for boys are presidential picks, with Lincoln, Monroe, and Pierce being favorites with parents. Roosevelt and Ford are standouts in the group for us, as they have all-star appeal and crisp styling.\n\nGive these surname names a shot for something different. You’ll be surprised at what you find."
