        "text": "Quantitative Approach\n\nAdaptation of a quantitative framework to the ACMG/AMP guidelines will allow for refinement to the relevant strength of each piece of evidence, rather than the current “Met”/”Not Met” approach to each evidence type. Towards this goal, SVI evaluated the ACMG/AMP framework for compatibility with Bayesian statistical reasoning (Tavtigian et al., 2018). A high level of compatibility with the ACMG/AMP combing criteria was observed when scaling the relative strength of the ordered evidence categories to the power of 2.0, as multiple pairs of the ACMG/AMP pathogenic combining criteria were related to each other by this factor, as, for example, two strong criteria were equivalent to one very strong criterion. The resulting relative odds of pathogenicity for Supporting, Moderate, Strong, and Very Strong pathogenic evidence were estimated to be 2.08:1, 4.33:1, 18.7:1, and 350:1, respectively ( ). This quantitative framework provides opportunities to further refine evidence categories and combining rules, and can support evaluation of appropriate strength-level criteria modifications to the guidelines. For example, if assessment of a functional assay for PS3 application indicates that ~90% of variants with damaging calls from the assay are truly pathogenic, then a moderate strength level is appropriate (4:33:1 odds or ~81% accuracy) as this assay does not meet the strong strength level threshold (18.7:1 odds or ~95% accuracy). We consistently advocate for conservative interpretations of all forms of evidence to avoid overestimating the pathogenicity of a variant.\n\nAllele Frequency Considerations\n\nA variant occurring at a much higher population frequency than expected for the disease it is associated with is such a significant indicator of a benign impact that the ACMG/AMP guidelines awarded this piece of evidence as “Benign stand-Alone” (BA1). This means that if a variant were to meet the BA1 criterion, it could be considered benign without the need for assessing other evidence. The BA1 criterion in the ACMG/AMP guidelines was defined as “Allele frequency is >5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium.” In 2018, ClinGen SVI proposed an updated definition of BA1 to “Allele frequency is >0.05 in any general continental population dataset of at least 2,000 observed alleles and found in a gene without a gene- or variant-specific BA1 modification” (Ghosh et al., 2018). This proposed updated definition allowed use of subpopulation groups while avoiding errors that may arise in allele frequency estimation due to population diversity and size (i.e., incorrectly concluding a variant is benign due to a high allele frequency in a small or bottlenecked population). To aid in proper usage of allele frequency data, ExAC and gnomAD have included a “filtering allele frequency” (FAF) annotation, which is the highest true population allele frequency for which the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of allele count under a Poisson distribution is still less than the variant’s observed allele count (Whiffin et al., 2017). In practice, this annotation functions as equivalent to a lower bound estimate for the true allele frequency of an observed variant given a population size (i.e., the FAF for a given variant will always be lower than the calculated allele frequency). In both ExAC and gnomAD, the highest FAF from any continental population is displayed. To control against incorrect usage due to population diversity or size, gnomAD does not calculate FAF for non-continental populations (Finnish and Ashkenazi Jewish subpopulations) nor is FAF calculated for continental populations with a singleton observation.\n\nCalculating and Applying BA1/BS1 Thresholds\n\nA second important caveat added to SVI’s updated definition of BA1 is the recognition that the proposed >0.05 threshold for calling a variant benign is an order of magnitude higher than necessary for many genes and disorders. To calculate a gene- or disease-specific threshold for BA1 or BS1 (“Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder”) it is important to consider disease prevalence, genetic (locus and allelic) heterogeneity, and penetrance. With these parameters, thresholds can be determined by calculating the maximum credible population allele frequency for a disease, defined as: (prevalence x heterogeneity) / penetrance (Whiffin et al., 2017). displays the varying prevalence, penetrance, and heterogeneity input values used by ClinGen VCEPs to calculate both BA1 and BS1 thresholds. For the majority of VCEPs (Cardiomyopathy, RASopathy, Hearing Loss - Autosomal Recessive, and PAH), BA1 and BS1 calculations were differentiated by varying heterogeneity values (locus vs. allelic), while prevalence and penetrance values were kept constant. Alternatively, two VCEPs (CDH1 and Hearing Loss - Autosomal Dominant) kept heterogeneity and penetrance values constant while varying prevalence inputs between BA1 and BS1. These differences likely reflect different degrees of confidence with the reported values of each variable. While approaches to prevalence, penetrance, and heterogeneity values may have differed among VCEPs, all VCEPs followed our preference of using the most conservative estimates for BA1 calculation and less conservative estimates for BS1 calculation.\n\nTable 2.\n\nCriteriaPrevalenceHeterogeneityPenetranceThresholdCardiomyopathy (AD)BA11:20010.60% L30%≥0.001 (0.1%)BS12% A≥0.0002 (0.02%)PM21:50050%<0.00004 (0.004%)RASopathy (AD)BA11:2500100%40%≥0.0005 (0.05%)BS150% L≥0.00025 (0.025%)PM2---Absent RCDH1 (AD)BA11:800100%30%≥0.002 (0.2%)BS11:1250≥0.001 (0.1%)PM2---<0.00001 (0.001%) RHearing Loss (AD)BA11:305% L/A80%≥0.001 (0.1%)BS11:150≥0.0002 (0.02%)PM2---<0.00002 (0.002%) MHearing Loss (AR)BA11:2007.2% A100%≥0.005 (0.5%)BS14.4% A≥0.003 (0.3%)PM2---<0.00007 (0.007%) MPAH (AR)BA11:500090% L80%≥0.015 (1.5%)BS12% A≥0.002 (0.2%)PM2---<0.0002 (0.02%) MPTEN* (AD)BA1---≥0.01 (1%)BS1---≥0.001 (0.1%)PM2---<0.00001 (0.001%) R\n\nWith this approach of defining BA1 and BS1 thresholds based on the maximum credible population allele frequency for a disease, these thresholds can then be compared to the FAF for all variants in the genes of interest. If a variant has a FAF above BA1 or BS1 thresholds for a condition of interest, then BA1 or BS1 can confidently be applied to that variant. For example, using allele frequency data from ExAC, the Cardiomyopathy VCEP applied BA1 criterion (≥0.001) to all 46 variants in MYH7 that had a FAF >0.001 (Kelly et al., 2018).\n\nCalculating and Applying PM2 Thresholds\n\nDetermining if modifications to PM2 criterion phrasing (“Absent from controls, or at extremely low frequency if recessive, in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium”) are necessary can also vary by gene and disease depending on whether or not affected individuals are expected to be present in large population datasets. For adult-onset conditions, affected individuals may be present in the dataset and for these reasons, approaches to calculating a PM2 threshold are not as consistent as those for BA1 and BS1 ( ). Approaches for determining a PM2 threshold have included: calculating the maximum credible population allele frequency using more realistic and less conservative values than BA1/BS1 (Cardiomyopathy VCEP), assumption that 0–2 individuals in gnomAD would have disease (0 – 0.002%) based on prevalence and frequency of known pathogenic variants (RASopathy, CDH1, and PTEN), and selecting a threshold that is numerically an order of magnitude smaller than the BS1 threshold (Hearing Loss and PAH).\n\nSelecting a PM2 threshold that is simply the inverse of BS1 (i.e., <0.0002 for PM2; >0.0002 for BS1) is discouraged because in that scenario the difference of a single allele count in a population dataset would move a variant from moderate strength for pathogenicity to strong benign evidence strength. This notion is supported by the Bayes classification framework in which a strong piece of benign evidence has 1:18.7 odds of pathogenicity while a moderate piece of pathogenic evidence has 4.33:1 odds of pathogenicity ( ), suggesting a “grey zone” in allele frequency thresholds between BS1 and PM2 in which no criteria is applied is necessary.\n\nLastly, regardless of the calculated PM2 threshold, “absence” should only be assumed if the variant type is expected to be detected by large population datasets (as large indels and variants in repetitive or low complexity regions may be missed or incorrectly annotated), if read depth at that position is sufficient for an accurate call, and if the individual harboring the identified variant is of a genetic background represented in the dataset. If any of these considerations are not met, then the significance of a variant being “absent” from the dataset is unknown, and this criterion should not be applied.\n\nFuture Directions\n\nGiven the range of expected variant allele frequencies, moving towards a spectrum approach in which allele frequency data is not limited to Benign Stand Alone (BA1), Benign Strong (BS1), and Pathogenic Moderate (PM2) evidence types is anticipated. The ClinGen Hearing Loss VCEP accounted for this issue by also creating and defining BS1_Supporting and PM2_Supporting strength levels for allele frequency data, recognizing that while a variant allele frequency may not meet a stringent threshold for BS1, for instance, the frequency may be high enough that some evidence towards benign interpretation is warranted (BS1_Supporting). This notion of additional allele frequency strength levels is also included in the Invitae/Sherloc specifications to the ACMG/AMP guidelines which include five allele frequency categories, “Absent” and “Pathogenic range” on the Pathogenic side and “Very high”, “High”, and “Somewhat high” on the Benign side, supporting this spectrum approach to allele frequency data (Nykamp et al., 2017).\n\nAdditionally, concerns have been raised that PM2 is given too much weight in the framework. This concern is supported by findings from ExAC that 99% of identified high-quality variants have a frequency <1% and that 54% of identified high-quality ExAC variants are only seen once in the entire data set, suggesting that rarity is actually common. This concept of absence or within pathogenic range is an important factor during variant assessment but may be better suited as a consideration or caveat for application of other criteria, such as taking into account allele frequency before applying PS4 for observation of the variant in multiple affected individuals or insuring an LoF variant does not have an allele frequency inconsistent with the expected prevalence. However, the combining rules outlined in the ACMG/AMP guideline requires multiple evidence types be met in order to reach a classification, meaning removal or downgrading the weight of PM2 would have a major impact on variant classification. Due to those constraints, a general recommendation that PM2 weight be decreased for all diseases cannot be endorsed until the combining rules or inclusion of PM2 into other evidence types are considered.\n\nLoss of Function Variants\n\nIn the ACMG/AMP guidelines, the only criterion designated with Very Strong strength level for pathogenicity is PVS1, defined as “null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical ±1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) in a gene where loss-of-function (LoF) is a known mechanism of disease” (Richards et al., 2015). Given the weighting of this criterion as Very Strong and the potential impact of inappropriate usage, SVI published guidance on application of PVS1 that included a decision tree format to determine the applicable strength of PVS1 by assessing variant type, predicted consequence, and location within the gene (Abou Tayoun et al., 2018). Additionally, this recommendation reiterated the concept that the PVS1 criterion should only be applied for genes where LoF is an established disease mechanism; however determination of whether LoF is an established disease mechanism can be subjective. Several resources, including the ClinGen haploinsufficiency (HI) score (Riggs et al., 2012) and the ExAC/gnomAD probability of LoF intolerance (pLI) score and observed/expected score (Lek et al., 2016), can help determine if LoF is a potential disease mechanism. The HI scores are divided into six tiers based on manually curated evidence, with a score of “3” indicating “Sufficient evidence suggesting dosage sensitivity is associated with clinical phenotype”; however, not all genes have undergone this manual curation (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/dbvar/clingen/). The pLI score in computationally derived and measures the intolerance of a given gene to LoF variants in the general population, with a pLI >0.9 suggesting a significantly lower than expected rate of LoFs in the gene (Lek et al., 2016). However, with release of v2.1, gnomAD now recommends using the observed / expected (oe) score to measure expected LoF intolerance, in place of pLI scores (https://macarthurlab.org/2018/10/17/gnomad-v2–1/). While a higher pLI score (i.e., closer to 1.0) indicated strong intolerance of LoF variants, lower oe values (i.e., closer to 0) are indicative of strong LoF intolerance. The change from pLI to oe with a 90% confidence interval (CI) was intended to facilitate easier interpretation and continuity across the spectrum of selection. Additionally, a threshold of <0.35 for the upper bound of the oe confidence interval was suggested as a measure of significant LoF depletion (similar to the pLI >0.9 threshold).\n\ncompares variant spectrum curations and annotations for 22 genes from ClinGen VCEPs. Comparing HI and oe annotations to ClinGen VCEP curations for PVS1 applicability identifies key considerations. First, disease context is critical given that LoF may be a mechanism for one disease caused by a given gene but not another disease caused by that same gene. For example, for PTPN11 the RASopathy VCEP indicated that PVS1 is not applicable, although oe score is 0.03 (and upper bound of 90% CI is <0.35 threshold) suggesting LoF intolerance and HI score is 3 (“Sufficient evidence suggesting dosage sensitivity is associated with clinical phenotype”). However, the HI score for PTPN11 is based on metachondromatosis, a phenotype unrelated to RASopathy. The PVS1 assessment of applicability from the RASopathy VCEP is specific to assessing variants in PTPN11 with regards to pathogenicity for RASopathy-related conditions. Second, the oe score is only considered a valuable metric for genes that cause a disease inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern via haploinsufficiency, as all genes associated with diseases inherited in an autosomal recessive and PVS1 marked as applicable in have an upper bound of oe 90% CI >0.35, suggesting no significant depletion of LoF variation. This makes sense, as there is typically little or no selective pressure against the heterozygous (carrier) genotype for such disorders. ExAC and gnomAD calculate a probability score of a gene being intolerant to biallelic loss of function (pRec); however, those authors caution against using pRec as a metric for determining if recessive genes are tolerant of LoF (Lek et al., 2016). Lastly, as oe scores reflect gene tolerance relative to reproductive fitness, age of onset and disease severity need to be considered when assessing whether depletion of the disease-causing variant type is expected in population datasets. For example, for PTEN, CDH1, and MYO6, the upper bound of the oe CI exceeds the suggested <0.35 threshold for measuring LoF intolerance; however each VCEP indicates PVS1 as applicable given that the expected phenotype is not pediatric-onset or is unlikely to impact reproductive fitness, meaning affected individuals are not expected to be excluded from gnomAD. These data suggest that while oe CI <0.35 can help identify genes expected to be intolerant to LoF variation, this score will not identify all LoF intolerant genes and that oe should be viewed as a continuous value rather than a strict threshold. It is hoped that future implementations of a continuous, fully quantitative system can convert these frequencies into odds of pathogenicity.\n\nTable 3.\n\nGeneDisease Area (MOI)HI ScoregnomAD LoF oe metric (90% CI)PVS1?Missense Z score (ExAC / gnomAD)PP2?MYH7Cardio (AD)00.45 (0.35–0.57)Yes (Mod)6.54 / 3.93NoBRAFRAS (AD)10.1 (0.05–0.21)No3.99 / 3.72YesHRAS00.36 (0.16–0.93)No2.69 / 1.51YesKRAS00.63 (0.34–1.24)No1.36 / 2.32YesMAP2K100.15 (0.07–0.38)No3.43 / 3.11YesMAP2K210.1 (0.04–0.33)No1.48 / 1.87YesPTPN1130.03 (0.01–0.14)No3.43 / 3.13YesRAF100.19 (0.11–0.35)No2.82 / 2.46YesSHOC2-0 (0.00–0.14)No2.57 / 2.97YesSOS100.07 (0.03–0.14)No2.18 / 3.05YesPTENPHTS (AD)30.24 (0.13–0.51)Yes3.71 / 3.49YesCDH1HDGC (AD)30.25 (0.15–0.43)Yes0.81 / 0.71NoPAHPKU (AR)301.12 (0.84–1.50)Yes−1.54 / −0.65NoCDH23HL (AR)300.38 (0.26–0.57)Yes−0.24 / 0.71NoGJB2-2.62 (1.39–1.98)Yes−1.07 / 1.17NoMYO7A-0.7 (0.58–0.85)Yes−1.44 / 1.07NoSLC26A4-0.89 (0.68–1.18)Yes−3.23 / −2.01NoTECTA300.45 (0.35–0.58)Yes2.3 / 1.61NoUSH2A300.76 (0.67–0.86)Yes−5.12 / −2.47NoCOCHHL (AD)-0.59 (0.40–0.91)No0.34 / 0.68NoKCNQ4-0.22 (0.12–0.41)Yes2.73 / 1.83NoMYO6-0.3 (0.22–0.42)Yes1.02 / 1.39NoTECTA300.45 (0.35–0.58)No2.3 / 1.61No\n\nMissense Constraint and Hotspot/Functional Domains\n\nFor missense variation, differences in the expected and observed number of rare missense variants in population databases can be informative re pathogenicity if a gene demonstrates constraint for missense variation and if that constraint is observed across the entire gene (PP2) or only confined to specific regions of the gene (PM1). Based on data from ExAC, a missense constraint Z score >3.09 is equivalent to a p-value of 10−3 and is considered a significant threshold when splitting transcripts into constrained (meaning significantly depleted of missense variation) and unconstrained classes (Lek et al., 2016). ClinGen VCEPs have been encouraged to use this information when determining if ACMG/AMP criterion PP2 is applicable for their gene of interest ( ). However, similar to PVS1 and oe or pLI scores, caution should be placed on relying on the missense constraint Z score alone to determine if PP2 is applicable. One potential area of concern is applying PP2 for all missense variants in a gene when the constraint observed is isolated to a specific region of the gene. For example, MYH7 has a missense constraint Z score of 6.54 and 3.93 in ExAC and gnomAD, respectively, suggesting significant depletion of missense variation (or missense constraint). However, PP2 was marked not applicable for this gene by the Cardiomyopathy VCEP, as recent studies suggest that this high constraint is actually driven by a statistically significant clustering of pathogenic variants in the head region of the protein (Homburger et al., 2016; Walsh et al., 2017). Based on these data, the Cardiomyopathy VCEP concluded this evidence was most appropriately weighted as moderate (PM1) through application of the critical domain rule (Kelly et al., 2018). Specification of PM1 has required gene-by-gene curation by disease experts, combined with laboratory data to determine regions intolerant to variation. These findings suggest that while missense constraint Z score can help inform application of PP2, additional curation is necessary, specifically with regards to PM1.\n\nQuantitative Approaches to Case-Level Data\n\nAs general recommendations for usage, ClinGen SVI has released quantitative-based approaches for both de novo occurrences (PS2/PM6) and occurrences of the variant in trans with a pathogenic variant (PM3). As stated in the ACMG/AMP guidelines, a de novo occurrence can be used as evidence supporting pathogenicity, dependent on the phenotype in the patient matching the gene’s disease association with reasonable specificity, with the strength of a de novo occurrence varying based on whether tested parental samples are confirmed (PS2) versus assumed (PM6) to be from the biological parents of the patient. It is important to note that “confirmed” and “assumed” for de novo occurrences does not refer to parental samples being “confirmed” or “assumed” to be negative for the putative pathogenic variant. In both scenarios the parent samples have been tested and are negative for the variant; the “confirmed” and “assumed” terms pertain to whether or not the tested samples were shown through identify testing to be the biological parents of the patient. This may be done most simply in cases of trio exome or genome sequencing by confirming that there are very few Mendelian inconsistencies in the trio. Otherwise, biologic parentage can be confirmed by STRP analysis.\n\nGiven that a variant may have arisen de novo in multiple individuals with varying parental confirmation scenarios and varying phenotypes, ClinGen SVI established a quantitative approach to determine the appropriate strength level to apply for de novo data (https://www.clinicalgenome.org/site/assets/files/3461/recommendation_ps2_and_pm6_acmgamp_critiera_version_1_0.pdf). With this approach, each proband with a de novo variant is awarded a point value based upon phenotypic consistency and confirmed or assumed de novo status ( ). The combined point value of all probands with de novo occurrences is then compared to the PS2/PM6 point thresholds ( ) to determine the applicable evidence strength level.\n\nTable 4.\n\n4A.

However, no directions were provided on how to increase PM3 weight based on multiple occurrences or to decrease PM3 weight if phasing is unknown (Amendola et al., 2016). To aid in consistency in application of PM3, ClinGen SVI proposed a quantitative approach to determine the appropriate PM3 strength level to apply for in trans occurrences (https://clinicalgenome.org/site/assets/files/3717/svi_proposal_for_pm3_criterion_-_version_1.pdf). Similar in scope to the de novo point system described above, with this proposal each proband is awarded a point value based upon phasing of the two variants in question (confirmed in trans versus unknown) and classification of the variant on the other allele ( ). Point values from all probands are then summed and compared to PM3 point thresholds ( ) to determine the applicable strength level.\n\nDisease Specification and Alternative Usage of PS4 Criterion\n\nIf the prevalence of a variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to controls, based on suggested odds ratio or relative risk >5.0, criteria PS4 can be applied. However, for many diseases or individual variants, sufficient data is unavailable to perform significant case-control studies. The ACMG/AMP guidelines provides a method for this data type to still be utilized as PS4 evidence by noting “in instances of very rare variants where case–control studies may not reach statistical significance, the prior observation of the variant in multiple unrelated patients with the same phenotype, and its absence in controls, may be used as moderate level of evidence” (Richards et al., 2015). ClinGen SVI endorsed this notion and recommended VCEPs specifying the ACMG/AMP guidelines for autosomal dominant disorders establish proband counting thresholds for varying PS4 strength levels (VCEPs specifying autosomal recessive disorders were encouraged to use PM3 instead of PS4 for case counts - see above). With this suggestion, VCEPs have specified PS4 usage to include counts of multiple unrelated probands with consistent phenotypes. Differences in the number of probands needed for each strength level has varied by VCEP according the specificity of the phenotype/disease of interest ( ). As PTEN and CDH1 specifications were developed after the Bayes adaptation of the ACMG/AMP guidelines, both VCEPs scaled the relative strength of PS4 to the power of 2.0. Additionally, while the majority of VCEPs defined strength levels based on the number of probands with consistent phenotypes, the PTEN VCEP instead used a point system in which the weight of each proband varied based on the specificity of the phenotypic features (Mester et al., 2018).\n\nBayesian Approach to Combining Rules\n\nIn addition to refining the relative strength of evidence types, another advantage of a quantitative approach to the ACMG/AMP guidelines is refinements to the combining rules. Following recommendations from the ACMG/AMP guidelines that “likely pathogenic” and “likely benign” be used to mean greater than 90% certainty of a variant either being disease-causing or benign, respectively, the Bayesian framework used the following posterior probability (Post_P) ranges for classification ( ): Pathogenic Post_Ps >0.99; Likely pathogenic Post_P between 0.90 and 0.99; Likely benign Post_P between 0.001 and 0.10; Benign Post_P <0.001. In modeling the ACMG/AMP guidelines into a Bayesian framework, each of the 18 combining rules outlined in the ACMG/AMP guidelines were evaluated for consistency by determining if the Post_P for each scenario is within the expected Post_P range for that classification. For example, from Richards et al (2015) , combing criteria for Likely pathogenic (iv) - ≥3 Moderate should result in a Post_P in the Likely pathogenic range (between 0.90 and 0.99). Of the 18 combining rules, only two combinations were mathematically inconsistent with the overall framework. The first inconsistent combing rule, Pathogenic (ii) - ≥2 Strong, resulted in a Post_P of 0.975, which was in the Likely pathogenic range (0.90 – 0.99), not the Pathogenic range (>0.99). The second inconsistent combining rule, Likely pathogenic (i) - 1 Very Strong AND 1 Moderate, resulted in a Post_P of 0.994, which was in the Pathogenic range (>0.99). The Likely pathogenic (i) - 1 Very Strong AND 1 Moderate combining rule is most commonly applied for novel LoF variants (PVS1 and PM1). While this combination may warrant a Pathogenic classification for certain variants, considerations such as confidence in LoF impact based on variant type and location need to be addressed and included in criteria evaluations before this modification can be adopted.\n\nTable 5.\n\nPost_P RangeClassificationPost_P > 0.99Pathogenic0.90 < Post_P ≤ 0.99Likely pathogenic0.10 ≤ Post_P ≤ 0.90Uncertain significance0.001 ≤ Post_P < 0.10Likely benignPost_P < 0.001Benign\n\nNovel Combining Rules\n\nThe Bayesian framework approach to the ACMG/AMP guidelines has also facilitated the development of combining rules not explicitly stated in the guidelines, as Tavitigian et al provided a simple spreadsheet calculator that allows users to calculate a Post_P for any set of criteria (Tavtigian et al., 2018, supplemental table). For example, the ACMG/AMP guidelines included two combining rules for a Likely benign classification, (i) 1 Strong and 1 Supporting and (ii) ≥2 Supporting, which result in Post_P of 0.003 and 0.025, respectively, both of which are within the Likely benign Post_P range (0.001 – 0.10). However, while not stated in the guidelines, one Benign Strong piece of evidence on its own results in Post_P of 0.006, which is within the Likely benign Post_P range. This scenario is most commonly applicable for variants that meet BS1 allele frequency threshold with no conflicting pathogenic data. Currently, three of the six approved VCEPs (Hearing Loss, RASopathy, Cardiomyopathy) have included in their specifications to the ACMG/AMP guidelines a note that in addition to specifying criteria usage, these VCEPs have also specified the combining rules to allow BS1 to reach a likely benign classification, provided there is no conflicting evidence. Additionally, the Hearing Loss VCEP proposed that a combination of one Very Strong criterion and one Supporting criterion reach a variant classification of Likely pathogenic. This combination, which was not included in the ACMG/AMP guidelines combining rules, was considered given that the Hearing Loss VCEP adopted the stringent criteria for evaluating predicted LoF variants proposed by SVI, such that rare LoF variants meeting at least PM2_Supporting have at least a 90% chance of being pathogenic. This additional combining rule was approved by SVI as one Very Strong and one Supporting results in Post_P of 0.988, which falls within the Likely pathogenic range (0.90–0.99).\n\nClassifying Variants with Conflicting Data\n\nWith the ACMG/AMP guidelines (Richards et al., 2015), a VUS classification can result from either insufficient evidence or due to contradictory benign and pathogenic criteria. The guidelines did not provide guidance about classifying variants when the strength of conflicting evidence is not balanced. For example, if a variant occurred de novo, with paternity and maternity confirmed (PS2), a well-established functional assay suggests a deleterious impact (PS3), and the variant was absent from population databases (PM2), the variant would reach a Pathogenic classification. If for this same variant, multiple lines of computational evidence suggested this variant had no impact and criterion BP4 was also applied, then pathogenic and benign criteria are contradictory and the classification would now be uncertain, according to strict adherence to the ACMG/AMP combining rules. However, a quantitative approach to the guidelines would help identify instances in which both pathogenic and benign criteria are applied but the evidence is predominantly on one side versus the other. For example, for the variant outlined above, if only the pathogenic criteria (PS2, PS3, PM2) were applied, the Post_P is 0.994, which is within the Pathogenic range (>0.99). If benign criterion BP4 were also applied (PS2, PS3, PM2 plus BP4), then Post_P lowers to 0.988, which is now in the Likely pathogenic range (0.90–0.99).\n\nOne limitation to this approach is the assumption that all criteria at a given strength level are in fact mathematically equivalent evidence. Richards et al was constrained by the need to have categories or tiers of evidence and precision may have been sacrificed. Determining which evidence types at a given strength level constitutes contradictory evidence may be subjective. For example, the ACMG/AMP guidelines state that when supporting by splicing predictions (BP7) and computation evidence (BP4), “one can classify novel synonymous variants as likely benign” (Richards et al., 2015). This scenario is supported by the Bayesian approach as two benign supporting criteria results in Post_P of 0.025, which is in the likely benign range (0.001–0.10). However, if this synonymous variant is novel, then PM2 is also applicable, which would result in contradictory benign and pathogenic criteria and an uncertain classification (Post_P of 0.10; BP4, BP7, plus PM2). This specific issue could be mitigated by removing or decreasing the weight of PM2, as previously discussed."
