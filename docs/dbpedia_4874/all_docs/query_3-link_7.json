        "text": "Hey there, you know Prince Harry? Grandson to the late Queen Elizabeth? Husband to Meghan Markle and father of Archie and bb Lilibet Diana? Person who somewhat dramatically quit the royal family and is fifth in line to the throne? Well, a couple of fun facts about his name: First of all, it’s not Harry. It’s Henry!\n\nAnd while we’re at it, his full name is Henry Charles Albert David, which begs the question: Does Harry just…not have a last name? TBH, it’s complicated due to a bunch of various rules and proclamations, so let’s get into it.\n\nNo, Harry Technically Doesn’t Have a Last Name\n\nDue to being royal, Harry doesn’t have a last name like us mere mortals do. In fact, the official name listed on his son Archie’s birth certificate is His Royal Highness Henry Charles Albert David Duke of Sussex. (Side note: Imagine your occupation being “Prince of the United Kingdom.”)\n\nHowever! Back when he served in the military, Harry used the last name Wales and was known as Captain Harry Wales, according to a circa 2011 Telegraph article.\n\nSo, Where’d Archie Mountbatten-Windsor Come From?\n\nWhile Harry technically doesn’t have a last name, his son, Archie, used to use Mountbatten-Windsor prior to officially becoming a prince in March 2023. Why, you ask?! It’s a little complicated, but TL;DR: This name came into royal use back in 1960, when the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip decided they wanted their untitled descendants (read: royals who didn't use “HRH”) to have their ~own special last name~.\n\nIn fact, the royal family’s website states, “The Queen’s descendants, other than those with the style of Royal Highness and the title of Prince/Princess or female descendants who marry, would carry the name of Mountbatten-Windsor”...which is why now neither Archie, Lilibet, nor Harry (because they are all princes/princesses!) use it.\n\nPsst: In case you’re curious, Mountbatten is the last name of Prince Philip’s maternal grandparents, while Windsor is the surname George V gave his descendants before Elizabeth switched things up.\n\nSo, What Happens Now That Harry’s Not an HRH?\n\nAt this point, you might be wondering what’s going to happen now that Harry is no longer using “His Royal Highness” amid stepping down from the royal family. While he could start using the last name Mountbatten-Windsor, he apparently hadn’t signed any paperwork with that name as of April 2020. So for now, he’s simply Harry, Duke of Sussex (or Prince Harry, if you’re feeling fancy!).\n\nEither way, Harry can use Mountbatten-Windsor whenever he wants: Part of the Queen’s 1960 declaration states that when members of the royal family need a last name (think: official paperwork), they can use Mountbatten-Windsor. On top of that, it should be noted that Prince William and Kate Middleton’s kids use the last name Cambridge at school, which suggests Harry could potentially use Sussex as a last name if he wanted to. TBD, friends!"
