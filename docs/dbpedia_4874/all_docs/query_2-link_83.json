        "text": "By Leila Kozma\n\nUpdated Jan. 24 2024, 12:19 p.m. ET\n\nFounded in 1989, the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop is a family operation in every sense of the word. The Las Vegas landmark is currently spearheaded by Rick Harrison and his oldest son, Corey \"Big Hoss\" Harrison.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nRick's dad, the late Richard \"The Old Man\" Harrison, had a lasting influence on how the store is run. He also played a pivotal role in the corresponding reality TV show, Pawn Stars. While Rick runs the store now, audiences wonder what may happen to it in the future. Perhaps his kids will take up the pawn shop mantle!\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n'Pawn Stars' host Rick Harrison is the father to three sons.\n\nRick reportedly tied the knot with his first wife, Kim, when he turned 17. They had two children, Corey and Adam. Corey was born in 1983, while Adam was born in 1984.\n\nRick and Kim reportedly got divorced in 1985 after three years of marriage. Rick met his second wife, Tracy, shortly afterward. They got married in 1986, and they stayed together until around 2011. They share a son named Jake.\n\nRick also has three daughters, named Ciana, Sarina, and Marissa.\n\nRick's oldest son, Corey Harrison, started helping out at the store over a decade ago.\n\nRick's oldest son, Corey, started appearing on Pawn Stars in 2009. His clever exchanges with co-workers like Austin 'Chumlee' Russell helped him garner a great deal of popularity among fans.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nCorey spends a considerable chunk of his time at the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop. Unfortunately, it seems this tendency had a negative impact on his marriage with Korina \"Kiki\" Harrison, which came to an end after only a year in 2018.\n\n\"Karina and I love each other very much,\" Corey previously told The Blast. \"With our competing work schedules, we just weren't able to make the marriage work but remain good friends and want only the best for each other.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nRick's second-oldest son, Adam Harrison, died in January 2024 of a suspected drug overdose.\n\nIn January 2024, Adam's representative, Laura Herlovich, said that Adam was found dead on January 19 and that his suspected cause of death was a drug overdose. Adam was 39 at the time of his death. Unlike Corey, he had not appeared on the popular reality TV show.\n\nFollowing the announcement of his death, both Rick and Corey posted touching tributes to their loved one on social media.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nJake Harrison made his debut on 'Pawn Stars' in 2021.\n\nJake made his first debut in Season 18 of Pawn Stars. As a part of his initiation, he had to work out the difference between a fake and a real Rolex. Jake passed the test with flying colors.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nRick Harrison's daughters have not been on 'Pawn Stars.'\n\nWhile Corey and Jake have both followed in their dad's footsteps, Rick has three daughters who have not been on the show at all. Their names are Ciana, Sarina, and Marissa, and they appear to be Rick's stepdaughters.\n\nCiana was married in June of 2022, and Rick had the honor of walking her down the aisle at her wedding. She has since given birth to a daughter, who has Rick wrapped around her finger, judging by his posts on Instagram featuring her. Marissa is a hair and makeup artist whose clients include Corinne Fox and Heidi Montag. Sarina is an alumna of Louisiana State University."
