        "text": "An article about the overuse of spinal imaging has been retracted after the distributor of a chiropractic product it criticized in passing complained to the journal.\n\nThe paper, “An investigation into the chiropractic practice and communication of routine repetitive radiographic imaging for the location of postural misalignments,” was retracted in June from the Journal of Clinical Imaging Science after the editor-in-chief learned it contained “controversial statements regarding the commercial product Denneroll,” according to the statement.\n\nDenneroll is a line of support products that purports to help with “spinal remodeling” for people whose spines aren’t curved in the normal way, according to a company brochure. The company’s website states that the Denneroll products are “second to none in spinal orthotics.”\n\nThe retraction notice said Deed Harrison, a chiropractor whose family distributes the Denneroll product line, “claimed that the data presented against this product lacks scientific backing.” Harrison’s father, Donald Harrison, originated a technique called Chiropractic BioPhysics (CBP) which is the basis of the Denneroll product line, according to the CBP website.\n\nAccording to the notice, “the authors of the manuscript acknowledged the error. Therefore, on ethical grounds, the article is being retracted.” The corresponding author, Brogan Williams, a researcher at the Association of Musculoskeletal Sports Physiologists in Auckland, New Zealand, did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nVikram Dogra, the editor-in-chief of the journal, did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nAs the authors of the retracted paper discussed evidence they said showed “no association between pain and reversed cervical curves,” they wrote:\n\nIt must be addressed that over the years, there have been some contradictory studies by one very active group, the Harrisons.\n\n“The Harrisons have been challenged multiple times by many leading chiropractors, claiming the method was ‘physiologically flawed’ and the studies extremely ‘vulnerable to false-positive diagnoses,’” Williams and his colleagues wrote, citing a 1998 study.\n\nThey also mentioned two 2006 critical reviews of a 2005 paper by both Harrisons supporting “structural rehabilitation of the spine” and the CBP method. The reviews “concluded that ‘we must reclassify their studies as seriously flawed controlled clinical trials’ and ‘inconclusive evidence that may be viewed as professionally irresponsible by the scientific and academic community,’” Williams and his colleagues wrote.\n\nWe attempted to contact the authors from each paper referenced, but none responded to our request.\n\nHarrison told Retraction Watch that he is “pleased with the decision by the Editor, the Board, and the Publisher based on the information I provided to them.” He refused to share the letter he sent the journal and would not respond to other questions.\n\nTwo “testimonies” on the Denneroll website state “I personally use the Denneroll Orthotic device for my patients. Now, I have chosen to put the CBP name behind the Denneroll and recommend it to other Chiropractors.” They are attributed to Deed E. Harrison and Deed E. Harrison 2. A third, with the standard “Lorem ipsum dolor” text indicating filler, is attributed to Deed E. Harrison 3.\n\nUpdate, 8/3/24, 1300 UTC: Headline, first paragraph, and fourth paragraph edited to clarify that the Harrisons are distributors of Denneroll, not the owners.\n\nLike Retraction Watch?
