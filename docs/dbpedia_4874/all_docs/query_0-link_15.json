He is also working on a third book called Wildcat!, about the films of Marjoe Gortner, a former child evangelist who turned to acting as an adult and starred in a number of entertaining and interesting exploitation and drive-in films.\n\nJohn has also appeared regularly on film-related radio and television shows such as Film Buff's Forecast and Video in Focus, and has provided live on-stage introductions for various screening put on by the Cinemaniacs film society in Melbourne, including The Warriors, Flash Gordon, Bloodsucking Freaks and, most recently, Bless the Beasts and Children."
