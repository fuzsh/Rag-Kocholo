Look, I came to this Earth seeking redemption, but I realize now, you're right. Greatness isn't in the cards for me...\n\n„ ~ H.R. Wells to Cisco\n\nHarrison \"H.R.\" Wells is a major character in Season 3 of The Flash. On Earth-19, an alternate universe where he originated, he was the previous face and \"conceptual genius\" of S.T.A.R. Labs.\n\nHistory[]\n\nH.R. Wells was thought to be a brilliant and prolific scientist during his years on Earth-19, although he was actually simply a novelist and journalist. He was no longer admired and lost his reputation after being exposed for posing as a bright scientist. When Team Flash transmitted a cryptogram containing a code, Randolf, H.R's partner, received it and decoded it.\n\nWhen HR discovered the message's code, he saw the potential to continue producing books and journals in order to be considered deserving of something. He was eventually accepted by Team Flash, despite his lack of scientific understanding and ineffective contributions to the team.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nH.R. Wells was a compassionate, naïve, and selfless man. He was a genuine and compassionate individual who was driven to explore and assist his friends in reaching their full potential. He was always willing to assist people and never acted selfishly. Despite being frequently mistreated by his teammates, he never retaliated and instead continued to encourage and assist them. His teammates thought his efforts were futile and worthless, but he proved them wrong when he saved Iris' life. He prevented Iris' death by sacrificing himself. As his life came to an end, he was relieved that Iris was saved.\n\nNavigation[]"
