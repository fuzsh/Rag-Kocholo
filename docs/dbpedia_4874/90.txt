Harrison Repository - extensive ancestry available. [I think this is his grandfather but not positive yet.]

T. P. HARRISON, who is engaged in farming in Washington county and is also filling the position of county assessor, was born about five miles south of Prairie Grove on the 6th of May, 1871, and is a son of RICHARD P. and MALINDA (HOWELL) HARRISON, the former a native of Washington county, Arkansas, while the latter was born in East Tennessee and was brought to this state by her parents during her early girlhood. Further mention of Mr. and Mrs. Richard P. Harrison is made in connection with the sketch of J. M. HARRISON on another page (427-8) of this book. The son, T. P. HARRISON, was a pupil in the country schools and thus laid the foundation of his success in later life. He was trained to the work of the farm, early becoming familiar with the best methods of tilling the soil and caring for the crops, so that he had broad and valuable practical experience when he began farming on his own account after reching adult age. His entire attention was given to the further cultivation of his land until 1918, when he was elected to the office of county assessor, entering upon the duties of the position the following year. He served with such capability during his first term of two years that he was reelected in 1920 and is now serving for the second term. He devotes about six months of the year to the duties of the office and the remainder of his time to his farm. He still owns the old home place of one hundred twenty acres and carries on general agricultural pursuits, raising the crops best adapted to the soil and climate conditions here. He also has an orchard and raises considerable fruit and has always lived a life of industry, thrift and enterprise.

In 1891 Mr. Harrison was married to Miss ORA WHEELER, who was born in Washington county, a daughter of R. A. and ELLA (WEST) WHEELER, also native of this county, where for many years her father followed farming but is now retired. He served for four years in the Union army during the Civil war and he has always been a republican in politics, giving stanch support to the principles of the party. He belongs to the Methodist church and his life has ever been guided by high and honorable principles. To him and his wife have been born eight children, four sons and four daughters, and the family five are yet living, the eldest being Mrs. Harrison. The others are MRS. LOU SKELTON, whose husband is clerking in a store in Prairie Grove; ELLA, the wife of J. ED ROGERS, a farmer of Prairie Grove; MARVIN, who is an oil man living at Fullerton, California; and LYDE, the wife of ROY F. ABSHLER, also a resident of California.

The marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Harrison was blessed with nine children: LACY, who was a resident of California was there killed in an automobile accident in 1914; JACOB, who is now engaged in the drug business at Tulsa, Oklahoma, served in the World war, being trained at Camp Pike. He was in France for thirteen months and later was with the Army of Occupation in Germany following the signing of the armistice. He was in the front line trenches many times, participated in the battle of St. Mihiel and the Argonne Forest and received his discharge in August, 1919; LUELLA, the third of the family, is at home; DWIGHT has completed the high school course; HELEN died of influenze in the year 1919; THOMAS, MARY and GERTRUDE are all in school; RICHARD PERSHING, two and a half years old, comples the family.

Since reaching his majority Mr. Harrison has always voted with the domocratic party and has taken an active interest in promoting its growth and securing its success. He belongs to the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and is promiment in the independent Order of Odd Fellows, in which he has passed through all of the chairs. He has likewise been a representative to the grand lodge three times and is well known in the organization throughout this state. He has ever been active in the public life of the community and has left his impress upon public thought and action.
