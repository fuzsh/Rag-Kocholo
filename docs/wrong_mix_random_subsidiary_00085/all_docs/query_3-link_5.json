        "text": "Breast abscess due to Finegoldia magna in a non-puerperal women.\n\nPubMed\n\nCobo, Fernando; RodrÃ­guez-Granger, Javier; Sampedro, Antonio; Navarro-MarÃ­, JosÃ© MarÃ­a\n\n2017-10-01\n\nFinegoldia magna is a Gram-positive anaerobic coccus involved in a wide variety of infections. We report a unusual case of breast abscess in a non-puerperal patient. A 46-year-old woman presented with pain and a nodular lesion in the left breast. Culture of abscess drainage resulted in isolation of F.Â magna. Initial treatment with clindamycin was changed to a definitive treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate for 10 days due to resistance to clindamycin, and improvement of this infection was documented.

We present a case of F.Â magna associated non-valvular cardiovascular device-related infection in an 83 year-old male who received a permanent pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome seven weeks prior to his presentation. Five weeks after the implantation, the pacemaker and leads were explanted because of clinical evidence of pacemaker pocket infection. He was initially treated with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim based on the Gram stain results from the removed pacemaker. However, two weeks later, he was readmitted with sepsis and was successfully treated with ampicillin-sulbactam. Culture results from the pacemaker and pocket as well as blood cultures grew F.Â magna. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of F.Â magna infection when initial gram stain results show \"gram positive cocci\". Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, puerperal sepsis remains a leading cause of maternal mortality throughout the world. Group A streptococcus (GAS), Streptococcus pyogenes, is an organism associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality from puerperal infections. When associated with sepsis, known as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, mortality rates approach 30-50%. Group A streptococcus can cause invasive infections in the form of endometritis, necrotizing fasciitis, or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. The clinical presentation of women with puerperal GAS infections is often atypical with extremes of temperature, unusual and vague pain, and pain in extremities. Toxin production by the organism may allow GAS to spread across tissue planes and cause necrosis while evading containment by the maternal immune system in the form of a discrete abscess. Endometrial aspiration in addition to blood cultures may be a useful rapid diagnostic tool. Imaging may appear normal and should not dissuade the clinician from aggressive management. When suspected, invasive GAS infections should be treated emergently with fluid resuscitation, antibiotic administration, and source control. The optimal antibiotic regimen contains penicillin and clindamycin. Source control may require extensive wound or vulvar debridement, hysterectomy, or a combination of these, which may be life-saving. The benefit of immunoglobulins in management of puerperal GAS infections is unclear.\n\nAnalysis of hyaluronic acid concentration in rat vocal folds during estral and gravidic puerperal cycles.\n\nPubMed\n\nPedroso, JosÃ© Eduardo de SÃ¡; Brasil, OsÃ­ris CamponÃªs do; Martins, JoÃ£o Roberto Maciel; Nader, Helena Bociane; SimÃµes, Manuel de Jesus\n\n2009-01-01\n\nHormone plays an important role in the larynx. Among other substances, vocal folds contain hyaluronic acid, which tissue concentration may vary according to hormone action. the objective of this study is to analyze hyaluronic acid concentration in the vocal folds during estral and gravidic-puerperal cycles. Experimental study. 40 adult rats were divided into two groups. In the first group we used 20 rats to establish the concentration of hyaluronic acid during the estral cycle and in the second group, 20 animals were submitted to the same procedure but during the gravidic-puerperal cycle. Variations in hyaluronic acid concentration was not observed during the estral cycle. In the gravidic puerperal cycle group, an increase in hyaluronic acid concentration was observed in the puerperal subgroup. Comparing the two groups of estral and gravidic-puerperal cycles, no difference was observed. In comparing all subgroups of estral and gravidic-puerperal cycles, an increase in hyaluronic acid concentration was noticed only in the puerperal phase.\n\nRising Trend of Use of Antidepressants Induced Non- Puerperal Lactation: A Case Report.\n\nPubMed\n\nKukreti, Prerna; Ali, Wazid; Jiloha, R C\n\n2016-06-01\n\nNon puerperal lactation or galactorrhea is a well known side effect of antipsychotic drugs but has been infrequently described with the use of antidepressants. In past few decades, there have been emerging trend of isolated case reports of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors induced non puerperal lactation. We report a case of non puerperal lactation following usage of second generation tricyclic antidepressant, nortriptyline and resolution on withdrawing the drug. Literature review has been done for antidepressant induced galactorrhea to understand the current trends, putative mechanism as different from one implicated for antipsychotics and its clinical utility.\n\nPuerperal infections.\n\nPubMed\n\nEschenbach, D A; Wager, G P\n\n1980-12-01\n\nThis comprehensive review on puerperal infections covers risk factors, causative bacteria, pathophysiology, diagnosis, therapy of specific entities, and prevention. Puerperal infection is problematic to define especially with antibiotics that change the course of fever. I may present as endometritis (most common), myometritis, parametritis, pelvic abscess, salpingitis, septic pelvic thrombophlebitis or septicemia, and also includes infections of the urinary tract, episiotomy, surgical wounds, lacerations or breast. Each of these is discussed in terms of contributing factors, microbiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, treatment, prevention and complications. Risk factors in general are cesarean section, premature rupture of the membranes, internal fetal monitoring, general anesthesia, pelvic examinations. The most common bacterial involved are group B and other streptococci, E. coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Gram positive anaerobic cocci, Mycoplasma and pre-existing Chlamydial infections. Diagnosis of the causative organism is difficult because of polyinfection and difficulty of getting a sterile endometrial swab. Diagnosis of the infection is equally difficult because of the wide variety of symptoms: fever, abnormal lochia, tachycardia, tenderness, mass and abnormal bowel sounds are common. Therapy depends of the responsible microorganism, although 3 empirical tactics are suggested while awaiting results of culture: 1) choose an antibiotic for the most common aerobic bacteria; 2) an antibiotic effective against B. fragilis and one for aerobic bacteria, e.g. clindamycin and an aminoglycoside; 3) a nontoxic antibiotic active against most aerobic and anaerobic organisms, e.g. doxycycline or cefoxitin. An example of an infection recently described is pudendal-paracervical block infection, often signaled by severe hip pain. It is associated with vaginal bacteria, is usually complicated by abscess even with antibiotic coverage, and may end in paraplegia or fatal sepsis\n\nRadiological and clinical features of adult non-puerperal mastitis.\n\nPubMed\n\nTan, H; Li, R; Peng, W; Liu, H; Gu, Y; Shen, X\n\n2013-04-01\n\nTo describe the radiological and clinical features of adult non-puerperal mastitis and to determine the most accurate method of preventing unnecessary surgical procedures. Clinical and imaging findings were retrospectively reviewed in 51 females with non-puerperal mastitis, which was confirmed by biopsy/surgical pathology. All 51 patients had pre-operative MRI; 45 patients also had sonograms and 25 also had mammograms, pre-operatively. Of the 51 cases with non-puerperal mastitis, 94.1% (48/51) were confirmed as having acute or chronic inflammation, and the other 3 had plasma cell mastitis; areola papillaris inflammation was found in 39.2% (20/51) of the cases. Overall, 6 of the 25 cases that were examined with mammography and 2 of the 45 cases that were examined with sonography appeared normal, but all 51 lesions were positively identified on MRI. Asymmetrical density (12/25) on mammograms and solitary or separated/contiguous, clustered, hypoechoic mass-like lesions (31/45) on ultrasound were the most common signs of non-puerperal mastitis. On enhanced MRI, 90.2% (46/51) of patients showed non-mass-like enhanced lesions. Multiple regional enhancements in the pattern of distribution (32/46) and separated or contiguous, clustered, rim-like enhancements in the pattern of internal enhancement (29/46) were the most common manifestations in non-mass-like enhanced lesions. Of the 51 patients, mastitis Type 1 and Type 2 in the time-signal intensity curve were detected in 47.1% and 51.0% of the patients, respectively. The breast imaging reporting and data system categories with the highest number of patients were Category 0 (9/25) on mammography, Category 4a on sonography (18/45) and Category 4a on MRI (29/51). The findings from mammography and ultrasound are non-specific; therefore, using MR can be helpful in the diagnosis, especially in the presence of non-mass-like enhancements that are multiple, regional, separated, or contiguous, clustered and rim-like. Mastitis is\n\nPuerperal and intrapartum group A streptococcal infection.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAnteby, E Y; Yagel, S; Hanoch, J; Shapiro, M; Moses, A E\n\n1999-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the demographic and clinical variables characteristic of non-epidemic intrapartum or puerperal group A streptococcal (GAS) infection. METHODS: The records of 47 patients diagnosed with intrapartum or puerperal GAS infection over a 6 1/2 year period at Hadassah-University Hospital-Mt. Scopus, Jerusalem were reviewed. Data regarding 25,811 women, the general population of women that delivered during that period, were obtained from their computerized medical records. Frequency distributions, t-test, chi-square, and Spearman's Rank Correlation were used, as appropriate, to analyze and compare demographic and clinical variables associated with development of GAS infection, its clinical course and subsequent development of septic shock. RESULTS: Mean age of mothers with GAS infection was higher than that of our general pregnant population (30.4 versus 27.4 years, P = 0.0019), and a higher proportion of GAS infected patients (30% versus 12%, P < 0.005) experienced PROM. Thirty-one (66%) women had fever as their sole presenting symptom, eight (17%) had fever and abdominal pain, seven (15%) had fever and abnormal vaginal bleeding, and one patient (2%) presented with a rash. Three patients (6%) developed a septic shock. Two of these patients presented with symptoms more than 14 days after delivery. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the characteristics of non-epidemic intrapartum or puerperal GAS infection. Data from our study and review of the literature suggest that some patients who develop septic shock may present later in the puerperium than patients with an uncomplicated GAS infection.

This cross sectional study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of low BMD in puerperal women and to identify associated risk factors. We surveyed all puerperal women who had BMD measurements taken 4-6 weeks after delivery in a tertiary university hospital, and did not have any bone loss-related comorbidities. Among the 1,561 Korean puerperal women, 566 (36.3%) had low BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and/or trochanter. Multivariate analysis revealed that underweight women had a significantly higher risk of low BMD compared with obese women at pre-pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.83-5.63). Also, women with inadequate gestational weight gain (GWG) were 1.4 times more likely to have low BMD than women with excessive GWG (aOR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.04-1.94). One-way ANOVA showed that BMDs at the lumbar spine and total hip were significantly different between the 4 BMI groups (both P < 0.001) and also between the 3 GWG groups (both P < 0.001). In conclusion, this study identifies a high prevalence of low BMD in puerperal women and thus suggests the need for further evaluation about the change of BMD in pregnancy and postpartum period.\n\nPregnancy complications in Brazilian puerperal women treated in the public and private health systems.\n\nPubMed\n\nVarela, PatrÃ­cia Louise Rodrigues; Oliveira, Rosana Rosseto de; Melo, Emiliana Cristina; Mathias, Thais Aidar de Freitas\n\n2018-01-08\n\nto analyze the prevalence of pregnancy complications and sociodemographic profile of puerperal patients with complications, according to the form of financing of the childbirth service. cross-sectional study with interview of 928 puerperal women whose childbirth was financed by the Unified Health System, health plans and private sources (other sources than the Unified Health System). The sample was calculated based on the births registered in the Information System on Live Births, stratified by hospital and form of financing of the childbirth service. Data were analyzed using the chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. the prevalence was 87.8% for all puerperal women, with an average of 2.4 complications per woman. In the case of deliveries covered by the Unified Health System, urinary tract infection (38.2%), anemia (26.0%) and leucorrhea (23.5%) were more frequent. In turn, vaginal bleeding (26.4%), urinary tract infection (23.9%) and leucorrhoea (23.7%) were prevalent in deliveries that were not covered by the Unified Health System. Puerperal women that had their delivery covered by the Unified Health System reported a greater number of intercurrences related to infectious diseases, while women who used health plans and private sources reported intercurrences related to chronic diseases. A higher frequency of puerperal adolescents, non-white women, and women without partner among those assisted in the Unified Health System (p < 0.001). the high prevalence of complications indicates the need for monitoring and preventing diseases during pregnancy, especially in the case of pregnant women with unfavorable sociodemographic characteristics.\n\n[Woman's participation in the decision process of the pregnancy and puerperal cycle: nursing care integrative review].\n\nPubMed\n\nBusanello, Josefine; Lunardi Filho, Wilson Danilo; Kerber, NalÃº Pereira da Costa; Lunardi, ValÃ©ria Lerch; dos Santos, Silvana Sidnei\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThis is an integrative review that aims to identify the contribution of nursing care for woman's participation in the decision process of the pregnancy and puerperal cycle, as described in Brazilian scientific publications. The scientific productions were retrieved in May, 2010, from the Virtual Library of Health (Biblioteca Virtual em SaÃºde) database. From the eight articles reviewed, two themes stood out: Contributions of nursing care to the woman's participation in the decision process of the pregnancy and puerperal cycle; and Limitations of nursing care to the woman's participation in the decision process of the pregnancy and puerperal cycle. The following review supports the production of knowledge in nursing, by identifying a gap in what nurses know and do about this issue, as shown by the lack of nursing researches that concern, specifically, the participation of the woman in the decision process during the pregnancy and puerperal cycle and the possible contributions of nursing care to ensure women of this right.\n\nVirulence arsenal of the most pathogenic species among the Gram-positive anaerobic cocci, Finegoldia magna.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoyanova, Lyudmila; Markovska, Rumyana; Mitov, Ivan\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThis review focuses on the virulence arsenal of the most pathogenic species among Gram positive anaerobic cocci, Finegoldia magna according to recently published data from 2012 to 2016. Virulence factors like sortase dependent pili and F.âmagna adhesion factor (FAF) facilitate the start of the infection. Albumin binding protein (PAB) enhances F.Â magna survival. FAF, subtilisin-like extracellular serine protease (SufA) and superantigen protein L protect the bacteria from factors of innate defense system. SufA, capsule and tissue-destroying enzymes provide a deep penetration or spread of the infections and the protein L is associated with infection severity. Biofilm production results in infection chronification and complicated treatment as well as to persistence of multi-species biofilms. Resistance rates to quinolones (13.0->70%) and clindamycin (0-40.0%) are important, and resistance to penicillins (<4%), chloramphenicol (7.0%) and metronidazole (<7%) has been reported. F.Â magna should not be overlooked when present in monoinfections or mixed infections in humans. Copyright ÃÂ© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The WHO defined puerperal sepsis in 1992 as an infection of the genital tract occurring at any time between the rupture of membranes or labour and the 42nd day post partum; in which, two or more of the following are present: pelvic pain, fever, abnormal vaginal discharge and delay in the reduction of the size of the uterus. At the same time, the WHO introduced the term puerperal infections, which also include non-genital infections in the obstetric population. Recent epidemiological data shows that puerperal sepsis and non-genital tract infections are a major area of concern. In puerperal sepsis, group A streptococcus (GAS) is the most feared pathogen. Up to 30% of the population are asymptomatic carriers of GAS. GAS commonly causes throat infections. Women who died from GAS-positive sepsis all had signs of a throat infection themselves or one of their family members suffered from a throat infection. The pathway of infection is from the hands of the pregnant women or the mother to her perineum. In non-genital tract infections, influenza viruses and the HIV pandemic in the developing part of the world are responsible for many maternal deaths, and demand our attention. The physiological changes of pregnancy and the puerperium can obscure the signs and symptoms of sepsis in the obstetric population. A high level of suspicion is, therefore, needed in the care for the sick pregnant patient. If sepsis is suspected, timely administration of antibiotics, sepsis care bundles, multidisciplinary discussion and early involvement of senior staff members are important to improve outcome.

Compared with other forms of mental affliction, puerperal insanity was known for its good prognosis, with many women recovering over the course of several months. Even so, a significant number of deaths were associated with the disorder, and a large proportion of sufferers struggled with urges to destroy their infants and themselves. The disorder evoked powerful delusions concerning death, with patients expressing intimations of mortality and longing for death.\n\nDelivery-associated presence of supramolecular fibronectin-fibrin complexes in puerperal and cord plasma.\n\nPubMed\n\nLis-Kuberka, Jolanta; Berghausen-Mazur, Marta; KÄ tnik-Prastowska, Iwona; Orczyk-PawiÅowicz, Magdalena\n\n2018-05-15\n\nThe variable fibronectin (FN) molecular forms are known to be engaged in coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways as well as tissue remodeling and repair processes. Some of them seem to be indispensable molecules within intensive biological processes associated with delivery. The aim of the study was to evaluate the FN molecular status in maternal and cord plasma after vaginal birth and cesarean section (C-section). The study included nonpregnant women's plasma samples (nâ=â31) and puerperal and cord plasma samples collected from 49 mothers who delivered healthy newborns at term by vaginal birth (nâ=â25) and C-section (nâ=â24). The maternal and cord plasma FN concentrations and presence and relative ratios of different FN-fibrin complexes were determined by ELISA and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) -agarose immunoblotting, respectively. FN concentration in puerperal plasma after vaginal birth (232.08âÂ±â71.8âmg/L) and C-section (228.17âÂ±â71.2âmg/L) was significantly higher than in the plasma of nonpregnant women (190.00âÂ±â48.75âmg/L). In contrast, FN concentration in cord plasma of the C-section group (101.95âÂ±â30.3âmg/L) was significantly lower than that of the vaginal birth group (121.80âÂ±â22.2âmg/L). Immunoblotting of puerperal and cord plasma distinguished the most abundant dimeric plasma FN form, the 220-280-kDa FN degradation products and 750-1900-kDa FN-fibrin complexes, which occurred more frequently and in higher amounts in puerperal and cord plasma groups than the nonpregnant women group, although independently of the mode of delivery. Occurrence and relative amount of delivery-associated FN-fibrin complexes in both puerperal and cord plasmas might be bound with the physiological adaptive mechanisms reducing the risk of hemorrhage and intensive remodeling and repair processes after delivery.\n\n[Choice of type of delivery: factors reported by puerperal woman].\n\nPubMed\n\nNascimento, Raquel Ramos Pinto do; Arantes, Sandra Lucia; Souza, Eunice Delgado Cameron de; Contrera, Luciana; Sales, Ana Paula Assis\n\n2015-01-01\n\nTo know the factors listed by puerperal woman that influenced the choice in type of delivery. Qualitative research, developed with 25 puerperal women in a University Hospital of Mato Grosso do Sul, between September and November 2014. A semi-structured interview was used for data collection and the Collective Subject Discourse was used to organize and tabulate the data collected. The Collective Subject Discourses resulted in the following categories: Desire for the type of delivery; Respect for the chosen type of delivery and Factors that influenced the choice. Most of the women interviewed (76%) expressed a preference for normal birth due to rapid recovery, less pain and suffering. The influence of family members, previous experience with childbirth, professional-customer interaction and internet information influenced the type of delivery chosen, which reinforces the importance of health education since the pre-natal stage, highlighting the need to equip women to perform a conscious choice.\n\nThe Effect of Surveillance and Appreciative Inquiry on Puerperal Infections: A Longitudinal Cohort Study in India\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHussein, Julia; Ramani, K. V.; Kanguru, Lovney; Patel, Kalpesh; Bell, Jacqueline; Patel, Purvi; Walker, Leighton; Mehta, Rajesh; Mavalankar, Dileep\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjective To evaluate the effects of an intervention comprising surveillance and an organisational change called Appreciative Inquiry on puerperal infections in hospitals in Gujarat state, India. Methods This longitudinal cohort study with a control group was conducted over 16 months between 2010 and 2012. Women who delivered in six hospitals were followed-up. After a five month pre-intervention period, the intervention was introduced in three hospitals. Monthly incidence of puerperal infection was recorded throughout the study in all six hospitals. A chi-square test and logistic regression were used to examine for associations, trends and interactions between the intervention and control groups. Findings Of the 8,124 women followed up, puerperal infections were reported in 319 women (3.9%) over the course of the study. Puerperal sepsis/genital tract infections and urinary tract infections were the two most common puerperal infections. At the end of the study, infection incidence in the control group halved from 7.4% to 3.5%. Levels in the intervention group reduced proportionately even more, from 4.3% to 1.7%. A chi-square test for trend confirmed the reduction of infection in the intervention and control groups (p<0.0001) but the trends were not statistically different from one another. There was an overall reduction of infection by month (ORâ=â0.94 95% CI 0.91â0.97). Risk factors like delivery type, complications or delivery attendant showed no association with infection. Conclusion Interruption of resource flows in the health system occurred during the intervention phase, which may have affected the findings. The incidence of infection fell in both control and intervention groups during the course of the study. It is not clear if appreciative inquiry contributed to the reductions observed. A number of practical and methodological limitations were faced.

Patients with puerperal mastitis who were admitted to a county-based teaching hospital between January 1997 and December 2005 were identified by International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, codes (675.1, 675.2). Data collected included demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, treatment, duration of admission, premorbid antibiotic exposure, and bacteriology. Demographic variables and obstetric outcomes were compared with all other pregnant women delivered at our hospital. One hundred twenty-seven of 136,459 women delivered at our teaching hospital were admitted for puerperal mastitis (9.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.8-11.1] per 10,000 deliveries). The incidence of mastitis only during the study period was 6.7 (95% CI 5.4-8.3) per 10,000 deliveries, and the incidence of mastitis with breast abscess was 2.6 (95% CI 1.8-3.6) per 10,000 deliveries. Puerperal mastitis was significantly associated with younger women (23.4 years compared with 25.1 years, P<.001) and decreased parity (P=.02). Clinically significant breast abscess (n=35, 28%) was seen most commonly with community-acquired MRSA (n=18, 67%) during the data-collection period. The majority (15 [56%]) of women with culture-proven MRSA did not receive antibiotic therapy to which this organism was sensitive. They were discharged without complication, and there were no treatment failures. Community-acquired MRSA was most commonly associated with breast abscess. The empiric use of antibiotics ineffective against community-acquired MRSA did not adversely affect the outcomes in this study.\n\nQuantitative Analysis of Diffusion-Weighted Imaging for Diagnosis of Puerperal Breast Abscess After Polyacrylamide Hydrogel Augmentation Mammoplasty: Compared with Other Conventional Modalities.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Lihua; Long, Miaomiao; Wang, Junping; Liu, Ning; Ge, Xihong; Hu, Zhandong; Shen, Wen\n\n2015-02-01\n\nPuerperal breast abscess after polyacrylamide hydrogel (PAAG) augmentation mammoplasty can induce breast auto-inflation resulting in serious consequences. Mammography, ultrasound, and conventional MRI are poor at detecting related PAAG abnormality histologically. We evaluated the value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the quantitative analysis of puerperal PAAG abscess after augmentation mammoplasty. This was a retrospective study, and a waiver for informed consent was granted. Sixteen puerperal women with breast discomfort underwent conventional breast non-enhanced MRI and axial DWI using a 3T MR scanner. Qualitative analysis of the signal intensity on DWI and conventional sequences was performed. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the affected and contralateral normal PAAG cysts were measured quantitatively. Paired t test was used to evaluate whether there was significant difference. Both affected and normal PAAG cysts showed equal signal intensity on conventional T1WI and fat saturation T2WI, which were not helpful in detecting puerperal PAAG abscess. However, the affected PAAG cysts had a significantly decreased ADC value of 1.477 Â± 0.332 Ã 10(-3)mm(2)/s and showed obvious hypo-intensity on the ADC map and increased signal intensity on DWI compared with the ADC value of 2.775 Â± 0.233 Ã 10(-3)mm(2)/s of the contralateral normal PAAG cysts. DWI and quantitative measurement of ADC values are of great value for the diagnosis of puerperal PAAG abscess. Standardized MRI should be suggested to these puerperal women with breast discomfort or just for the purpose of check up. DWI should be selected as the essential MRI sequence.\n\nCA-MRSA puerperal mastitis and breast abscess: a potential problem emerging in Europe with many unanswered questions.\n\nPubMed\n\nPÃ©rez, AndrÃ©s; Orta, Lourdes; Padilla, Emma; Mesquida, Xavier\n\n2013-06-01\n\nPuerperal mastitis and breast abscess caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is a condition rarely described in Europe to date. We report and comment on a case of CA-MRSA puerperal breast abscess in a 22-year-old primiparous mother. This aetiology was suspected before the antibiotic susceptibility profile of the strain isolated from the abscess was known on account of a history of previous skin colonisation detected in her baby. Additionally, the most striking epidemiological and therapeutic aspects, potential consequences of cross-infection between mother and child, and infection control management of this entity are briefly reviewed and discussed.\n\n[Recurrent subareolar non puerperal abscess of breast with fistules of lactiferous ducts (Zuskas disease)].\n\nPubMed\n\nMÃ³ricovÃ¡, P; Å½Ãºbor, P; KapustovÃ¡, I; Å vecovÃ¡, I; Danko, J\n\n2013-09-01\n\nZuskas disease (ZD) is an illness also known as the recurrent subareolar non-puerperal abscess of breast with fistulas of lactiferous ducts or as a periductal mastitis. ZD is rare, but painful chronic disease of breast characterized by local inflammation and evacuation of viscous content from abscess around the nipple. We present a rare form of the non-puerperal mastitis in patients with recurrence of this disease and with the description of management and treatment. The treatment of ZD is often inadequate and it leads to the recurrence of ZD and retraction of the nipple. Definitive treatment of ZD is surgical excision of the fistulation, removing of whole retroareolar fibroglandular tissue, abscess cavity and ductal tissue inside the nipple, including the obstructed ducts. The ratio of patients cured by this method is high, as well as their satisfaction with the final cosmetic effect of the nipple and breast.\n\nNon puerperal uterine inversion in a young female- a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nRathod, Setu; Samal, Sunil Kumar; Pallavee, P; Ghose, Seetesh\n\n2014-09-01\n\nWe report a case of 28-year-old, primipara who presented with complaints of mass descending per vaginum along with excessive bleeding and foul smelling vaginal discharge for the past six months. Clinical examination revealed an inverted uterus, cervix and vagina with a large submucosal fundal fibroid. A diagnosis of non-puerperal uterine inversion was made. Surgical management included vaginal myomectomy with repositioning of the uterus using an abdomino-vaginal approach and a successful outcome. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of leiomyoma. Hence, we conclude that uterus-sparing surgery should be considered in young females desirous for future pregnancy until the final pathology is known.\n\nPelvic inflammatory disease and puerperal sepsis in Ethiopia. I. Etiology.\n\nPubMed\n\nPerine, P L; Duncan, M E; Krause, D W; Awoke, S\n\n1980-12-01\n\nAmong 100 outpatient women with symptoms and signs of pelvic inflammatory disease and 200 asymptomatic, postpartum women, the prevalence rates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were 19% and 9%, respectively. Of 46 women hospitalized for PID, 33% were culture-negative, 22% grew Enterobacteriaceae, 20% grew streptococci, 15% grew gonococci, and 15% grew anaerobes from blood, pus, or abscesses. One third of 67 women hospitalized for puerperal sepsis (PPS) were culture-negative; the bacteria isolated most frequently from the uterus, blood, urine, and pus were Enterobacteriaceae (36%), gonococci (28%), streptococci (25%), and anaerobes (4%). The low frequency of isolation of anaerobes in women with PID and PPS was due largely to limitations placed on the collection and processing of specimens for anaerobic bacteriology.\n\nSonographic and MR features of puerperal uterine inversion.\n\nPubMed\n\nThakur, Shruti; Sharma, Sanjiv; Jhobta, Anupam; Aggarwal, Neeti; Thakur, Charu S\n\n2014-06-01\n\nPuerperal uterine inversion is a rare and potentially life-threatening complication of a mismanaged third stage of labour. Early diagnosis is mandatory for proper management of the patient. Complete uterine inversion is a clinical diagnosis. However, incomplete uterine inversion is difficult to identify and warrants further workup. Sonographic evaluation, although a bedside procedure, may be confusing. The conspicuity of findings is much greater on MR examination than on ultrasound. Only a few diagnostic imaging findings in uterine inversion have been described in previous reports. We present the case of a 26-year-old woman who had a full-term vaginal delivery and presented after 20 days with acute urinary retention and mild vaginal bleeding. She was diagnosed as a case of neglected subacute incomplete uterine inversion. Both greyscale and Doppler sonographic and MR features of the case are described with an emphasis on better delineation of uterine and adnexal anatomy on MR imaging.\n\n[Syphilis positivity in puerperal women: still a challenge in Brazil].\n\nPubMed\n\nRodrigues, Celeste S; GuimarÃ£es, Mark D C\n\n2004-09-01\n\nTo investigate the factors associated with positive syphilis serology results in puerperal women who were receiving care at 24 health centers accredited by Brazil's National Program on Sexually Transmitted Diseases and AIDS. This cross-sectional study included a probabilistic random sample of 3047 puerperal women. The eligibility criterion was being admitted for delivery or curettage in the selected centers. After an interview to collect demographic and clinical information, a blood sample was taken and then examined with the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) slide test. With positive VDRL results, the fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test (FTA-Abs) was used for confirmation. The event considered for analysis was positivity on the VDRL test, with confirmation by the FTA-Abs. For the statistical analysis, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. The model fit was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The prevalence of syphilis among the women studied was 1.7%. Multivariate analysis showed that increased risk for positive VDRL and FTA-Abs results was associated with the following characteristics: family income below one minimum wage, age < 17 years at first sexual intercourse, age < or = 14 years at first pregnancy, history of syphilis or of other sexually transmitted diseases prior to the current pregnancy, treatment for syphilis during the current pregnancy, partner having been tested for syphilis, having a positive HIV test result or having no HIV test result on record, previous preterm delivery, and stillbirth as an outcome of pregnancy. Only 43% of the women had had six or more prenatal visits, and only 3% had had one VDRL test during the first trimester of pregnancy and another VDRL test during the third trimester, as is recommended by Brazil's national Ministry of Health. This study shows that the problem of congenital syphilis is far from being solved in Brazil.

However, clinical malaria or scrub typhus is unusual without fever. On the other hand, altered sensorium with or without fever, dehydration, hemorrhage and hemolysis may lead to low blood pressure. Presence of toxic granules and elevated band forms in such patients can even mimic sepsis. When such a patient is in the peripartum period, it creates a strong clinical dilemma for the physician especially in unbooked obstetric cases. We present such a case where a 26-year-old unbooked female presented on second postpartum day with severe anemia, altered sensorium, difficulty in breathing along with jaundice and gum bleeding without history of fever. Rapid diagnostic test for malaria was negative and no eschar was seen. These parameters suggested a diagnosis of HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelet) syndrome with or without puerperal sepsis. Subsequently she was diagnosed as having asymptomatic malaria and scrub typhus and responded to the treatment of it. The biochemical changes suggestive of HELLP syndrome also subsided. We present this case to emphasize the fact that mere absence of fever and eschar does not rule out scrub typhus. It should also be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with symptoms and signs suggesting HELLP syndrome. Asymptomatic malaria can complicate case scenario towards puerperal sepsis by giving false toxic granules and band form in such situations.\n\nPelvic inflammatory disease and puerperal sepsis in Ethiopia. II. Treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nDuncan, M E; Perine, P L; Krause, D W; Awoke, S; Zaidi, A A\n\n1980-12-01\n\nWhere bacteriologic support is lacking, a combination of penicillin and streptomycin (P/S) is used empirically to treat serious gynecologic infections in Ethiopia. We compared the efficacy of P/S to a combination of penicillin and chloramphenicol (P/C) in hospitalized women who had bacteriologically confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease or puerperal sepsis (PPS). Treatment of PPS with P/C was significantly more effective in limiting the duration of fever than was treatment with P/S. Twenty-eight of 40 PPS patients had endometritis with retained products of conception that required evacuation of the uterus. The duration of fever in patients with PID who were treated with the P/C regimen was no different than that in those treated with P/S. Twenty of the 24 PID patients required surgery for drainage of abscesses, in addition to antibiotics.\n\nFrom Folklore to Scientific Evidence: Breast-Feeding and Wet-Nursing in Islam and the Case of Non-Puerperal Lactation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMoran, Lia; Gilad, Jacob\n\n2007-01-01\n\nBreast-feeding practice has an important medical and socio-cultural role. It has many anthropological aspects concerning the âpower structuresâ that find their expression in breast-feeding and the practices that formed around it, both socially, scientifically, and legally-speaking. Breast-feeding has been given much attention by religions and taboos, folklore, and misconception abound around it making it a topic of genuine curiosity. This paper aims at expanding the spectrum of folklore associated with breast-feeding. The paper deals with historical, religious, and folkloristic aspects of breast-feeding, especially wet-nursing, in Islam and focuses on an intriguing Islamic tale on breast-feeding - lactation by non-pregnant women (or non-puerperal lactation). Apparently, accounts of non-puerperal lactation are not restricted to Islam but have been documented in various societies and religions throughout centuries. Two medical situations - hyperprolactinemia and induced lactation, appear as possible explanations for this phenomenon. This serves as an excellent example for the value of utilizing contemporary scientific knowledge in order to elucidate the origin, anthropology and evolvement of ancient myth and superstition.

In Uganda, the WHO- MDG 5 (aimed at reducing maternal mortality by 75Â % between 1990 and 2015) has not been attained. The current maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in Uganda is 438 per 100,000 live births coming from 550 per 100,000 in 1990. This study sets out to find causes and predictors of maternal deaths in a tertiary University teaching Hospital in Uganda. The study was a retrospective unmatched case control study which was carried out at the maternity unit of Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH). The sample included pregnant women aged 15-49Â years admitted to the Maternity unit between January 2011 and November 2014. Data from patient charts of 139 maternal deaths (cases) and 417 controls was collected using a standard audit/data extraction form. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess for the factors associated with maternal mortality. Direct causes of mortality accounted for 77.7Â % while indirect causes contributed 22.3Â %. The most frequent cause of maternal mortality was puerperal sepsis (30.9Â %), followed by obstetric hemorrhage (21.6Â %), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (14.4Â %), abortion complications (10.8Â %). Malaria was the commonest indirect cause of mortality accounting for 8.92Â %. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, the factors associated with maternal mortality were: primary or no education (OR 1.9; 95Â % CI, 1.0-3.3); HIV positive sero-status (OR, 3.6; 95Â % CI, 1.9-7.0); no antenatal care attendance (OR 3.6; 95Â % CI, 1.8-7.0); rural dwellers (OR, 4.5; 95Â % CI, 2.5-8.3); having been referred from another health facility (OR 5.0; 95Â % CI, 2.9-10.0); delay to seek health care (delay-1) (OR 36.9; 95Â % CI, 16.2-84.4). Most maternal deaths occur among mothers from rural areas, uneducated, HIV positive, unbooked mothers (lack of antenatal care), referred mothers in critical conditions and mothers delaying to seek health care.

A prospective study of measles-rubella (MR) vaccination in the early puerperal phase was conducted in 171 mothers, who had insufficient antibody titers when screened for immunity to measles (â¤ 1:4 on the neutralization test [NT]) or rubella (â¤ 1:16 on the hemagglutination inhibition [HI] test) during pregnancy. To evaluate the efficacy of MR vaccination in the postpartum period, we determined their post-vaccination antibody titers and immune responses to vaccination, and investigated the association between these and their prolactin (PRL) levels and Th1/Th2 ratios at the time of vaccination. We also examined the passage of viral RNA and antigen into breast milk. Of the 169 participants who completed the study schedule, 117 and 101 had low antibody titers against measles and rubella, respectively. In the measles-seronegative group, the antibody-positive rate was 87% on the NT assay, and the NT geometric mean antibody titer was 11.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.0-13.0). In the rubella-seronegative group, the antibody-positive rate was 88% on the HI test assay, and the HI geometric mean antibody titer was 64.0 (95% CI, 53.9-76.0). There was no association between the post-vaccination antibody titers and the PRL levels or Th1/Th2 ratios at the time of vaccination. In the rubella-seronegative group, subjects with higher Th1/Th2 ratios showed higher rates of responsiveness than those with lower ratios (P=0.045). Although measles virus RNA was isolated from the breast milk of two vaccinated mothers, breastfeeding was not associated with clinical disease in any infants. MR vaccination in the early puerperal phase is considered an effective way to prevent the diseases, regardless of the mother's immunological status and hormonal milieu.

Although control efforts have primarily been focused on major infectious diseases such as diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV infection, the prevalence and impact of many local or minor infectious diseases are still unclarified in this country. In this review, we present our recent experience and outcomes of collaborative research on puerperal infection (PI), which is a poorly defined infectious disease in Bangladesh. PI is the most common complication during the perinatal period in developing countries. We investigated the incidence of individual species of aerobic bacteria causing PIs and their drug resistance, and the genetic traits of isolates during the two-year period (2010-2012). The common species of isolates from patients with PIs were Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. A remarkable finding was the high rates of resistance to cephalosporins among Gram-negative bacteria harboring extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes, which were associated with carbapenem resistance in a few isolates. This study defined the importance of control of antimicrobial resistance in Bangladesh, and provided suggestions for the future direction of collaborative research on infectious diseases in Bangladesh.\n\nDoes uterine gauze packing increase the risk of puerperal morbidity in the management of postpartum hemorrhage during caesarean section: a retrospective cohort study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGuo, Yu-Na; Ma, Jue; Wang, Xiao-Jin; Wang, Bing-Shun\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground: To compare the outcomes especially the puerperal morbidity of uterine gauze packing (UGP) with those of uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) in the management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) during caesarean section (c-section). Methods: It was considered success as no requirement for either a further therapy or hysterectomy for PPH. The postpartum infection risk was pragmatically measured as puerperal morbidity. Results: The identified PPH subjects were subdivided into two groups for comparison, in which UGP or UBT was used as second-line therapy for women undergoing c-sections between January 2010 and September 2014. Of the 318 c-section subjects initially treated by basic managements for expected PPH, 99 cases underwent UGP and 66 UBT as the second-line therapies to stop persistent bleeding. The success rates of the UGP and UBT groups were 90.91 and 87.88%, respectively. Only one patient in UBT group resorted to hysterectomy. The respective rates of puerperal morbidity were 10.10 and 13.64%, with risk ratio of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.32, 1.72). There were no significant differences between the two groups even after the adjustment for potential confounding factors. Conclusion: UGP appears to be effective in treating PPH during c-section without an observed increase in the risk of potential postpartum infection when compared with UBT. UGP could be recommended as routine for patients who are not responding to conventional basic therapies in addressing PPH, along with the provision of appropriate training.

A controlled, randomized clinical study was conducted in a Brazilian maternity ward. Forty puerpere were randomly divided into two groups: TENS high frequency and a no treatment control group. Post-episiotomy pain was assessed in the resting and sitting positions and during ambulation. An 11-point numeric rating scale was performed in three separate evaluations (at the beginning of the study, after 60 min and after 120 min). The McGill pain questionnaire was employed at the beginning and 60 min later. TENS with 100 Hz frequency and 75 Âµs pulse for 60 min was employed without causing any pain. Four electrodes ware placed in parallel near the episiotomy site, in the area of the pudendal and genitofemoral nerves. An 11-point numeric rating scale and McGill pain questionnaire showed a significant statistical difference in pain reduction in the TENS group, while the control group showed no alteration in the level of discomfort. Hence, high-frequency TENS treatment significantly reduced pain intensity immediately after its use and 60 min later. TENS is a safe and viable non-pharmacological analgesic resource to be employed for pain relief post-episiotomy. The routine use of TENS post-episiotomy is recommended. Â© 2012 The Authors.

A total of 75 mothers who sought primary care between October 2014 and February 2015 were investigated. The form was applied by the main researcher and the data was analyzed, using descriptive statistics with Microsoft Office Excel, and Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) programs. Association tests and statistical power were applied. Among the 75 mothers, 47 (62.7%) would have liked to receive more information about the newborn screening, especially regarding the correct sample collection period, followed by the screened morbidities. Most participants (n=55; 85.9%) took their children to be tested between the third and the seventh day of birth, as recommended by the Brazilian Health Ministry. Fifty-four women (72%) were unable to name the morbidities screened by the test in Minas Gerais, and they were also unaware that most have genetic etiology. The health professional who informed the mother about the Guthrie test was mainly the physician. This information was given prenatally to 57% of the cases, and to 43 % at the time of discharge from the hospital. The association test showed that mothers with higher education have more knowledge about the purpose and importance of the Guthrie test. The statistical power was 83.5%. Maternal knowledge about the Guthrie test is superficial and may reflect the health team's usual practice.\n\nPuerperal Mastitis: a Reproductive Event of Importance Affecting Anti-Mucin Antibody Levels and Ovarian Cancer Risk\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCramer, Daniel W.; Williams, Kristina; Vitonis, Allison F.; Yamamoto, Hidemi S.; Stuebe, Alison; Welch, William R.; Titus, Linda; Fichorova, Raina N.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nPurpose Test the hypothesis that puerperal mastitis may alter immunity related to the mucin (MUC) family of glycoproteins and lower risk for ovarian cancer. Methods In two case-control studies conducted in New England between 1998â2008, we examined the association between self-reported mastitis and ovarian cancer in 1,483 women with epithelial ovarian cancer and 1,578 controls. IgG1 antibodies against (MUC1) CA15.3 and (MUC16) CA125 were measured using electrochemiluminescence assays in a subset of controls (n=200). Preoperative CA125 was recorded in 649 cases. The association between ovarian cancer and mastitis was assessed using unconditional logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios, OR, and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Associations between mastitis and anti-CA15.3 and anti-CA125 antibodies and preoperative CA125 levels were evaluated using adjusted linear regression models. Results Prior mastitis was associated with a significantly lower risk for ovarian cancer: OR (and 95% CI) of 0.67 (0.48, 0.94) adjusted for parity, breastfeeding, and other potential confounders. The association was strongest with 2 or more episodes of mastitis; and risk declined progressively with increasing number of children and episodes of mastitis. Among controls, prior mastitis was associated with significantly higher anti-CA15.3 and anti-CA125 antibody levels and, among cases, with significantly lower preoperative CA125 levels. Conclusion Puerperal that mastitis may produce long-lasting anti-mucin antibodies that may lower the risk for ovarian cancer, plausibly through enhanced immune surveillance. Studying immune reactions related to MUC1 and MUC16 in the 10â20% of breastfeeding women who develop mastitis may suggest ways to duplicate its effects through vaccines based on both antigens.

We retrospectively reviewed recorded cases of PGH at Zekai Tahir Burak Research and Training Hospital, Ankara, Turkey, between January 2010 and 2014. Next three patients were chosen as control group. There were 47 cases of PGH with an incidence of 1 in 762 deliveries. Patients with PGH were younger, more likely to be nulliparous and had a greater weight gain during pregnancy than the control group. Patients with PGH had a longer first and second stage of labor than the control group. Mediolateral episiotomy and operative delivery were more frequently performed in patients with PGH than the control group. Neonates born to mothers with PGH were heavier than the control group (3525âÂ±â428 versus 3325âÂ±â579; pâ=â0.031). In the logistic regression model, nulliparity (OR: 8.68, 95% CIâ=â2.96-25.3), instrumental delivery (OR: 7.96, 95% CIâ=â1.37-49.0) and mediolateral episiotomy (OR: 6.67, 95% CIâ=â2.61-17.1) were factors which had an independent impact on risk of PGH. Nulliparity, instrumental delivery and mediolateral episiotomy are the main risk factors for hematomas.\n\nSemmelweis and the aetiology of puerperal sepsis 160 years on: an historical review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNOAKES, T.Â D.; BORRESEN, J.; HEW-BUTLER, T.; LAMBERT, M.Â I.; JORDAAN, E.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nSUMMARY It is generally accepted that Professor Ignaz Semmelweis was the first to identify the mode of transmission of puerperal sepsis. However no appropriate statistical analysis of Semmelweis's data supporting his theory has been reported. Mean annual percent maternal mortality rates for the Allgemeines Krankenhaus and Dublin Maternity Hospitals (1784â1858) were analysed. The introduction of pathological anatomy at the Allgemeines Krankenhaus in 1823 was associated with increased mortality. After 1840 maternal mortality was higher in Clinic 1 which was staffed by male obstetricians and medical students who, unlike the midwives in Clinic 2, attended autopsies. The introduction of chlorine washing of the male cliniciansâ hands in Clinic 1 by Semmelweis in 1847 reduced mortality, whereas the cessation of handwashing after Semmelweis left Vienna in 1850 was associated with increased mortality. This statistical analysis supports Semmelweis's hypothesis that âthe cadaveric particles adhering to the hand hadÂ â¦Â caused the preponderant mortality in the first Clinicâ.

Other important issues in the nutrition of infants exposed to the virus include severe maternal illness, which makes suckling extremely difficult, and feeding orphans. Wet nursing is one of the recommended steps in addressing the feeding problems of such infants but for reasons of sociocultural disapproval, it appears not to be popular in traditional African settings. Non-puerperal induced lactation or re-lactation of a close relation, usually a grandmother, which hitherto has been used to rehabilitate severely malnourished motherless infants, may be equally useful. The procedure of re-lactation and the limitations of the method are highlighted. Also, the need to employ information, education and communication in improving the sociocultural acceptability of this veritable infant feeding method in tropical Africa is discussed.\n\nEffect of puerperal metritis on reproductive and productive performance in dairy cows in Argentina.\n\nPubMed\n\nPiccardi, M; Romero, G; Veneranda, G; Castello, E; Romero, D; Balzarini, M; BÃ³, G A\n\n2016-03-15\n\nThe objectives of this study were to evaluate the reproductive and productive performance of dairy cows with and without puerperal metritis and to evaluate the effectiveness of using a long-acting ceftiofur preparation. Dairy cows in one dairy farm, calving from July 2009 to January 2010, were examined between 3 and 14 days postpartum and classified on the basis of vaginal discharge into three groups: cows with normal discharge (control; C); cows with a bloody mucus purulent or pathologic nonfetid discharge (PnFD), and cows with bloody mucopurulent or purulent fetid discharge (PFD). Cows in C and PnFD groups were not treated, whereas those in the PFD group were randomly allocated to receive 2.2 mg/kg of ceftiofur subcutaneously behind the ear (PFD-T) or remain untreated (PFD-No T). From the 640 cows examined, 58.2% formed the C group, 13.4% formed the PnFD group, and 28.4% formed the PFD group. Survival curves differed between cows in the C group and PFD-No T group (P = 0.0013) and between PFD-No T versus PFD-T group (P = 0.0006). Survival curves of PnFD were intermediate and did not differ from those in the C group (P = 0.2) and PFD-T group (P = 0.1) but tended to be different from the PFD-No T group (P = 0.056). The postpartum interval to achieve a 25% pregnancy rate was 72 days for cows in the C group, 73 days for the PFD-T group, 83 days for PnFD group, and 95 days for the PFD-No T group. The chance of pregnancy in a cow in the C group was 1.98 times higher (95% confidence interval = 1.33, 3.08) and in cows in the PFD-T group was 2.16 times higher (95% confidence interval = 1.37, 3.50) than that in the PFD-No T group. Finally, the chance of pregnancy in cows in the PnFD group tended to be higher (P = 0.08) than that in the PFD-No T group but did not differ from the other two groups. Cumulative 305-day milk production was higher (P < 0.0001) in C group than those with vaginal discharge, regardless of fetidness and regardless of treatment. It is concluded that\n\nSubcutaneous immunization with inactivated bacterial components and purified protein of Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Trueperella pyogenes prevents puerperal metritis in Holstein dairy cows.\n\nPubMed\n\nMachado, VinÃ­cius Silva; Bicalho, Marcela Luccas de Souza; Meira Junior, Enoch BrandÃ£o de Souza; Rossi, Rodolfo; Ribeiro, Bruno Leonardo; Lima, Svetlana; Santos, Thiago; Kussler, Arieli; Foditsch, Carla; Ganda, Erika Korzune; Oikonomou, Georgios; Cheong, Soon Hon; Gilbert, Robert Owen; Bicalho, Rodrigo Carvalho\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn this study we evaluate the efficacy of five vaccine formulations containing different combinations of proteins (FimH; leukotoxin, LKT; and pyolysin, PLO) and/or inactivated whole cells (Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Trueperella pyogenes) in preventing postpartum uterine diseases. Inactivated whole cells were produced using two genetically distinct strains of each bacterial species (E. coli, F. necrophorum, and T. pyogenes). FimH and PLO subunits were produced using recombinant protein expression, and LKT was recovered from culturing a wild F. necrophorum strain. Three subcutaneous vaccines were formulated: Vaccine 1 was composed of inactivated bacterial whole cells and proteins; Vaccine 2 was composed of proteins only; and Vaccine 3 was composed of inactivated bacterial whole cells only. Two intravaginal vaccines were formulated: Vaccine 4 was composed of inactivated bacterial whole cells and proteins; and Vaccine 5 was composed of PLO and LKT. To evaluate vaccine efficacy, a randomized clinical trial was conducted at a commercial dairy farm; 371 spring heifers were allocated randomly into one of six different treatments groups: control, Vaccine 1, Vaccine 2, Vaccine 3, Vaccine 4 and Vaccine 5. Late pregnant heifers assigned to one of the vaccine groups were each vaccinated twice: at 230 and 260 days of pregnancy. When vaccines were evaluated grouped as subcutaneous and intravaginal, the subcutaneous ones were found to significantly reduce the incidence of puerperal metritis. Additionally, subcutaneous vaccination significantly reduced rectal temperature at 6Â±1 days in milk. Reproduction was improved for cows that received subcutaneous vaccines. In general, vaccination induced a significant increase in serum IgG titers against all antigens, with subcutaneous vaccination again being more effective. In conclusion, subcutaneous vaccination with inactivated bacterial components and/or protein subunits of E. coli, F. necrophorum and T. pyogenes\n\n[Social representations of Mexican pregnant teenagers about the puerperal care, lactation, and newborn care].\n\nPubMed\n\nFranco-RamÃ­rez, Julieta A; Cabrera-Pivaral, Carlos E; ZÃ¡rate-Guerrero, Gabriel; Franco-ChÃ¡vez, Sergio A; Covarrubias-BermÃºdez, MarÃ­a Ã; Zavala-GonzÃ¡lez, Marco A\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPuerperal care and feeding of the newborn are guided by entrenched cultural meanings between women, so it is important to know and identify how they are acquired and perpetuated. Regarding this knowledge, the social representations that Mexican pregnant teenagers have about puerperium, lactation and newborn care were studied. An interpretative study was made based on principles of the theory of social representations. Interviews were conducted to obtain information from 30 Mexican adolescents who attended prenatal care at the gynecological obstetrics area in a second-level hospital during 2015. Classical content analysis strategies were applied to analyze the information; this process consisted of coding and categorizing information. A conceptual map was also developed to describe the social representations found. In this study, 190 codes and three social representations were identified: \"breastfeeding is a practice based on myths\", \"newborns are fragile\" and \"mother and child must be synchronized\". Three social representations were identified that explain the practices of adolescents towards breastfeeding and the care of them and their children, which were acquired through family communication and strengthened by the need for support due to the temporary or permanent absence of the couple, personal crises motivated by bodily changes, fear of new modifications due to breastfeeding and ignorance about how carry out breastfeeding and care during the puerperium.

A case report].\n\nPubMed\n\nColombel, M; Rebillard, C; Nathou, C; Dollfus, S\n\n2016-08-01\n\nPuerperal psychosis (PP) is a psychiatric disorder that occurs in 1Â out of 1000Â pregnancies. Well known since antiquity, its symptoms have often been described in mothers, but few studies have successfully investigated a related disorder in fathers. The characteristic of this pathology is more related to its appearance than to its semiological description which is why its nosographic place is always discussed. The objective here is to focus on the definition of PP and to suggest an entity for both genders. Our case report focused on the clinical description of an eighteen-year-old man suffering from an acute psychosis episode that occurred around the birth of his first child. Delusion followed a sudden decline in mood that lasted for a short period of time during the course of the third trimester of his wife's pregnancy. The delirium was rich with auditory and cenesthesic hallucinations, pregnancy and birth denial, feeling movements and hearing voices in his stomach. The symptoms disappeared after one month of treatment via an antipsychotic drug, risperidone. We can confirm that the symptomatic description of the disorder in this patient fits the classical descriptions of PP. Two elements make the PP different from other acute psychoses: the context of pregnancy and delirium focused on the child which can lead to a child murder. The absence of a framework precisely defining the PP does not improve its prevention and can lead to legal attitudes rather than medical care. Men suffering from acute psychosis in a context of pregnancy are submitted to the same risks as women. It is necessary to emphasize descriptions of PP in men to redefine the disease and consider that this entity involves both men and women. Copyright Â© 2016 LâEncÃ©phale, Paris.

Sixty-one non-puerperal patients with pathologically confirmed single benign mastitis lesions underwent preoperative examinations with conventional MRI and axial DWI. Patients were categorised into three groups: (1) periductal mastitis (PDM), (2) granulomatous lobular mastitis (GLM), and (3) infectious abscess (IAB). Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of each lesion were recorded. A one-way ANOVA with logistic analysis was performed to compare ADC values and other parameters. Discriminative abilities of DWI modalities were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. ADC values differed significantly among the three groups (P = 0.003) as well as between PDM and IAB and between PDM and GLM. The distribution of non-mass enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI differed significantly among the three groups (P = 0.03) but not between any two groups specifically. There were no differences in lesion location, patient age, T 2 WI or DWI signal intensity, enhancement type, non-mass internal enhancement, or mass enhancement characteristics among the three groups. ADC values and the distribution of non-mass enhancement are valuable in classifying mastitis subtypes. â¢ Mastitis subtypes exhibit different characteristics on DWI and DCE MRI. â¢ ADC values are helpful in isolating PDM from other mastitis lesions. â¢ Distribution of non-mass enhancement also has value in comparing mastitis subtypes.\n\nDiagnosis of acute puerperal metritis by electronic nose device analysis of vaginal discharge in dairy cows.\n\nPubMed\n\nBurfeind, O; Bruins, M; Bos, A; Sannmann, I; Voigtsberger, R; Heuwieser, W\n\n2014-07-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of an electronic nose device using vaginal discharge samples to diagnose acute puerperal metritis (APM) in dairy cows. Uterine fluid was sampled manually with a gloved hand and under sterile conditions for electronic nose device analysis (day in milk (DIM) 2, 5, and 10) and bacteriologic examination (DIM 5), respectively, and on additional days, if APM was diagnosed during the daily clinical examinations. A dataset containing samples from 70 cows was used to create a model and to validate the APM status predicted by this model, respectively. Half of the dataset (nÂ =Â 35; 14 healthy and 21 metritic cows) was provided with information regarding the APM diagnosis and contained all three measurements (DIM 2, 5, and 10) for each cow and was used as a training set whereas the second half was blinded (nÂ =Â 35; 14 healthy and 21 metritic cows) and contained only the samples collected on DIM 5 of each cow and was used to validate the created prediction model. A receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated using the prediction results of the validation test. The best observed sensitivity was 100% with specificity of 91.6% when using a threshold value of 0.3. The calculated P-value for the receiver operating characteristic curve was less than 0.01. Overall, Escherichia coli was isolated in eight of 28 (28.6%) and 22 of 42 (52.4%) samples collected from healthy and metritic cows, respectively. Trueperella pyogenes and Fusobacterium necrophorum were isolated in 14 and six of 28 (50.0% and 21.4%) and 17 and 16 of 42 (40.5% and 38.1%) samples collected from healthy and metritic cows, respectively. The prevalence of Escherichia coli and Trueperella pyogenes was similar in the samples obtained from metritic cows used for the training set and the validation test. The results are promising especially because of the objective nature of the measurements obtained by the electronic nose device.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the process and outcome of using aromatherapy treatments to increase relaxation and decrease fatigue for mothers during the first to the seventh day of the postpartum period. This non-randomized controlled study with a quasi-experimental one-group pretest-posttest design was used to evaluate scores in relaxation and fatigue before and after the intervention. Aromatherapy hand treatments were performed on a purposive sample of 34 postpartum mothers in Tokyo, Japan, from May to July 2016. The single treatment included a choice of one of five essential aroma oils through hand and forearm massage. Relaxation and fatigue were measured by self-administered valid and reliable questionnaires. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted to analyze the data before and after the intervention. The software programs SPSS, v. 23.0 (SPSS, Tokyo), was used to analyze the data, with the significance level set at 5%. Valid responses were obtained from 29 participants. A comparison of the scores before and after aroma treatment intervention indicated that the participants' relaxation scores increased significantly (P<0.001) and fatigue scores were significantly reduced (P<0.001). The majority of participants (77.8%) were satisfied with the treatment. The aroma treatments significantly improved relaxation and reduced fatigue for mothers in the early puerperal period and were well received.

Onsets in the same phase are especially a feature of prepartum psychosis and are the strongest indication of a specific trigger operating during pregnancy. Onsets in different phases provide a prima facie case for links between 'puerperal psychosis' and other reproductive onsets. They suggest that the 'picture puzzle' is not just about early onset puerperal psychosis, but a group of related reproductive triggers.\n\nHigh Incidence of Pathogenic Streptococcus agalactiae ST485 Strain in Pregnant/Puerperal Women and Isolation of Hyper-Virulent Human CC67 Strain\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Liping; Wang, Rui; Huang, Yan; Huang, Ting; Luo, Fuguang; Huang, Weiyi; Yang, Xiuying; Lei, Aiying; Chen, Ming; Gan, Xi\n\n2018-01-01\n\nGroup B streptococcus (GBS) is the major pathogen causing diseases in neonates, pregnant/puerperal women, cows and fish. Recent studies have shown that GBS may be infectious across hosts and some fish GBS strain might originate from human. The purpose of this study is to investigate the genetic relationship of CC103 strains that recently emerged in cows and humans, and explore the pathogenicity of clinical GBS isolates from human to tilapia. Ninety-two pathogenic GBS isolates were identified from 19 patients with different diseases and their evolution and pathogenicity to tilapia were analyzed. The multilocus sequence typing revealed that clonal complex (CC) 103 strain was isolated from 21.74% (20/92) of patients and ST485 strain was from 14.13% (13/92) patients with multiple diseases including neonates. Genomic evolution analysis showed that both bovine and human CC103 strains alternately form independent evolutionary branches. Three CC67 isolates carried gbs2018-C gene and formed one evolutionary branch with ST61 and ST67 strains that specifically infect dairy cows. Studies of interspecies transmission to tilapia found that 21/92 (22.83%) isolates including all ST23 isolates were highly pathogenic to tilapia and demonstrated that streptococci could break through the blood-brain barrier into brain tissue. In conclusions, CC103 strains are highly prevalent among pathogenic GBS from humans and have evolved into the highly pathogenic ST485 strains specifically infecting humans. The CC67 strains isolated from cows are able to infect humans through evolutionary events of acquiring CC17-specific type C gbs2018 gene and others. Human-derived ST23 pathogenic GBS strains are highly pathogenic to tilapia.

Porphyromonas gingivalis, a keystone pathogen for periodontitis, utilizes the T9SS to transport many proteins including the gingipain virulence factors across the outer membrane and attach them to the cell surface via a sortase-like mechanism. At least 11 proteins have been identified as components of the T9SS including PorK, PorL, PorM, PorN and PorP, however the precise roles of most of these proteins have not been elucidated and the structural organization of these components is unknown. In this study, we purified PorK and PorN complexes from P. gingivalis and using electron microscopy we have shown that PorN and the PorK lipoprotein interact to form a 50 nm diameter ring-shaped structure containing approximately 32-36 subunits of each protein. The formation of these rings was dependent on both PorK and PorN, but was independent of PorL, PorM and PorP. PorL and PorM were found to form a separate stable complex. PorK and PorN were protected from proteinase K cleavage when present in undisrupted cells, but were rapidly degraded when the cells were lysed, which together with bioinformatic analyses suggests that these proteins are exposed in the periplasm and anchored to the outer membrane via the PorK lipid. Chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry analyses confirmed the interaction between PorK and PorN and further revealed that they interact with the PG0189 outer membrane protein. Furthermore, we established that PorN was required for the stable expression of PorK, PorL and PorM. Collectively, these results suggest that the ring-shaped PorK/N complex may form part of the secretion channel of the T9SS. This is the first report showing the structural organization of any T9SS component.\n\nStructural Insights into the PorK and PorN Components of the Porphyromonas gingivalis Type IX Secretion System\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGorasia, Dhana G.; Veith, Paul D.; Hanssen, Eric G.; Glew, Michelle D.; Sato, Keiko; Yukitake, Hideharu; Nakayama, Koji; Reynolds, Eric C.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe type IX secretion system (T9SS) has been recently discovered and is specific to Bacteroidetes species.

The T9SS is poorly characterized but a number of proteins involved in the assembly of the secretion apparatus in the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis have been identified based on genome substractive analyses. Among these proteins, PorY, and PorX encode typical two-component system (TCS) sensor and CheY-like response regulator respectively. Although the porX and porY genes do not localize at the same genetic locus, it has been proposed that PorXY form a bona fide TCS. Deletion of porX in P. gingivalis causes a slight decrease of the expression of a number of other T9SS genes, including sov, porT, porP, porK, porL, porM, porN, and porY. Here, we show that PorX and the soluble cytoplasmic domain of PorY interact. Using electrophoretic mobility shift, DNA-protein co-purification and heterologous host expression assays, we demonstrate that PorX does not bind T9SS gene promoters and does not directly regulate expression of the T9SS genes. Finally, we show that PorX interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of PorL, a component of the T9SS membrane core complex and propose that the CheY-like PorX protein might be involved in the dynamics of the T9SS.

Pretreatment diffusion-weighted imaging data at 3.0 T were obtained for 80 patients (NPM, n = 27; BC, n = 53) and were retrospectively assessed. Two readers measured ADC values according to 2 distinct region-of-interest (ROI) protocols. The first protocol included the generation of ADC histograms for each lesion, and various parameters were examined. In the second protocol, 3 freehand (TF) ROIs for local lesions were generated to obtain a mean ADC value (defined as ADC-ROITF). All of the ADC values were compared by an independent-samples t test or the Mann-Whitney U test. Receiver operating characteristic curves and a leave-one-out cross-validation method were also used to determine diagnostic deficiencies of the significant parameters. The ADC values for NPM were characterized by significantly higher mean, 5th to 95th percentiles, and maximum and mode ADCs compared with the corresponding ADCs for BC (all P < 0.05). However, the minimum, skewness, and kurtosis ADC values, as well as ADC-ROITF, did not significantly differ between the NPM and BC cases. Thus, the generation of volumetric ADC histograms seems to be a superior method to the traditional 2-dimensional method that was examined, and it also seems to represent a promising image analysis method for distinguishing NPM from BC.\n\n[Adapting and validating the generic instrument CollaboRATEâ¢ to measure women's participation in health related decision-making during the reproductive process].\n\nPubMed\n\nBravo, Paulina; Contreras, Aixa; Dois, Angelina; Villarroel, Luis\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThere is a worldwide interest in involving patients in health related decisions, so patients can actively search for therapeutic options and choose course of action that allows them to have better quality of life and wellbeing.

In particular, cysteine proteinases named gingipains are of interest given their abilities to degrade host proteins and process other virulence factors such as fimbriae. Gingipains are translocated on the cell surface or into the extracellular milieu by the Por secretion system (PorSS), which consists of a number of membrane or periplasmic proteins including PorK, PorL, PorM, PorN, PorO, PorP, PorQ, PorT, PorU, PorV (PG27, LptO), PorW and Sov. To identify proteins other than gingipains secreted by the PorSS, we compared the proteomes of P.Â gingivalis strains kgp rgpA rgpB (PorSS-proficient strain) and kgp rgpA rgpB porK (PorSS-deficient strain) using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and peptide-mass fingerprinting. Sixteen spots representing 10 different proteins were present in the particle-free culture supernatant of the PorSS-proficient strain but were absent or faint in that of the PorSS-deficient strain. These identified proteins possessed the C-terminal domains (CTDs), which had been suggested to form the CTD protein family. These results indicate that the PorSS is used for secretion of a number of proteins other than gingipains and that the CTDs of the proteins are associated with the PorSS-dependent secretion.

A second objective was to evaluate the metabolic status at calving and at the time of PM diagnosis (d 0) in affected and matched healthy cows. Cows diagnosed with PM (n = 200) were assigned randomly to receive 1 of 2 treatments: (1) control received 3.75 mL of Optimum UterFlush [Van Beek Natural Science, Orange City, IA, containing yucca extract, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and a proprietary blend of carvacrol (4-isopropyl-2-methylphenol, at 0.47 g/mL)] diluted in 117 mL of distilled water by intrauterine infusion, administered every other day for a total of 3 treatments (n = 100); (2) calcium-supplemented (CA) received the same intrauterine treatment plus 6 oral capsules providing calcium ('O' Cal-D Cap, Bio-Vet Inc., Barneveld, WI; 7.5-9.0 g of Ca/capsule) once per day, for 3 consecutive days after diagnosis of PM. All cows received hypertonic saline solution (500 mL of 7.2% solution i.v. once), dextrose (500 mL of 50% solution i.v. once), and oral aspirin (5 boluses/d for 3 d). Outcome variables included fever, presence of fetid vaginal discharge, and uterine score at d 6 and 14 after diagnosis, survival at 30 and 100 d in milk, reproductive performance, and incidence of other health disorders after PM. A group of 200 control healthy cows (CH) was matched with PM cows at d 0, and calcium and fatty acid serum concentrations were determined at calving and at the day of diagnosis of PM (d 0). Calcium status was also assessed in PM cows at d 1, 2, 3, and 6 after diagnosis. Treatment effects were tested by logistic regression, repeated measures analysis, and ANOVA. Average calcium serum concentrations at d 0 were lower in PM cows (1.57 mmol/L) compared with CH cows (2.10 mmol/L). In PM cows, calcium\n\nSuppression of Cytochrome P450 Reductase (POR) Expression in Hepatoma Cells Replicates the Hepatic Lipidosis Observed in Hepatic POR-Null Mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBanerjee, Subhashis; Stolarczyk, Elzbieta I.; Zou, Ling\n\n2011-01-01\n\nCytochrome P450 reductase (POR) is a microsomal electron transport protein essential to cytochrome P450-mediated drug metabolism and sterol and bile acid synthesis. The conditional deletion of hepatic POR gene expression in mice results in a marked decrease in plasma cholesterol levels counterbalanced by the accumulation of triglycerides in lipid droplets in hepatocytes. To evaluate the role of cholesterol and bile acid synthesis in this hepatic lipidosis, as well as the possible role of lipid transport from peripheral tissues, we developed a stable, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated cell culture model for the suppression of POR. POR mRNA and protein expression were decreased by greater than 50% in McArdle-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells 10 days after transfection with a POR-siRNA expression plasmid, and POR expression was nearly completely extinguished by day 20. Immunofluorescent analysis revealed a marked accumulation of lipid droplets in cells by day 15, accompanied by a nearly 2-fold increase in cellular triglyceride content, replicating the lipidosis seen in hepatic POR-null mouse liver. In contrast, suppression of CYP51A1 (lanosterol demethylase) did not result in lipid accumulation, indicating that loss of cholesterol synthesis is not the basis for this lipidosis. Indeed, addition of cholesterol to the medium appeared to augment the lipidosis in POR-suppressed cells, whereas removal of lipids from the medium reversed the lipidosis. Oxysterols did not accumulate in POR-suppressed cells, discounting a role for liver X receptor in stimulating triglyceride synthesis, but addition of chenodeoxycholate significantly repressed lipid accumulation, suggesting that the absence of bile acids and loss of farnesoid X receptor stimulation lead to excessive triglyceride synthesis.
