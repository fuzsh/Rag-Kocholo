For Latin words the venerable Engb'-' tradition is followed [e.g., Caesar (se zur) except where some other pronunciation i well established, as in ecclesiastical name (e.g.. Salve Regina (sal'va raje'nu)]. The so called classical pronunciation, which ap proximates the pronunciation Caesar usd [e.g., Caesar (fcl'sar)], is not given, as beini not usual in English conversation. The purpose of the pronunciation sj’mbols is to give at least one serviceable way in which the word in question may be pro- nounced when used by careful speakers of English. In this work a pronunciation is ordinarily indicated for words printed in boldface ' when this pronunciation is not obvious to the English-speaking reader. Of two or more words or- names in succession spelled and pronounced alike, a pronunciation is frequently indicated for the first occurrence only. For names of localities in English-speak- ing areas the local pronunciation is pre- ferred, provided it is acceptable to careful speakers. For foreign words and names the speaker of English desires to use a pronunciation NOTES that will be acceptable to other speakers of English (unless he is speaking in a foreign language). In many cases (e.g., P.aris) there is a traditional pronunciation that resembles little the current native pronunciation, and attempts to introduce into English conversation an approximation of the native form (something like pare') are re- garded as an affectation. It is customary with foreign names that have no conven- tional English form to pronounce them with English sounds approximating the foreign ones. Such an approxim.ation is in- dicated in this work, whenever there is no established usage to follow. Actual good foreign-language pronuncia- tions can be acquired only' through imita- tion and study. Nevertheless, Englishmen and Americans have for many years made C T Sti;(i«r.

In its early da 3 's the sport was known as roj’al tennis because of the interest it held for French and English roj*- alty. En3o>'ing vaiydng degrees of popularity over the years, the sport first was played in the United States in 1876. Court tennis is plaj'ed on an indoor, cement court 110 ft. by 38 ft., which is surrounded by four walls 30 ft. high. A player hits the ball — made of tightly wound cloth — with a 16-ounce, 27-inch racquet, over the center net and plaj*8 the surface of the floor, the walls, and the ceiling to put the ball out of reach of the opponent. The scor- ing is intricate, and hitting the ball into wall open- ings also wins points. Among the game’s great plaj’ers have been Tom Pettit and Pierre Etche- baster, professionals, and J&y Gould and Ogden Phipps, amateurs. See Allison Danzig, The Rac- quet Game (1930).

Cousin, Victor (v5kt6rG» 1792-1867, French educa- tional leader and philosopher, founder of the eclec- tic school. He lectured at the Sorbonne from 1814 until 1821, when political reaction forced him out. Recalled to teaching in 1828, Cousin was named in 1830 to the council of public instruction and was made councilor of state. In 1832 fie became a peer of France, and in 1840 he accepted the position of minister of public instruction. He became virtu- allj' the national arbiter of educational and philo- sophical matters. His chief works in education were the complete reorganization and centraliza- tion of the primary' sj’stem and the establishment of a policj’ of philosophical freedom in the universi- ties. As an eclectic. Cousin sought to develop a ^'Stem wHch combined the ps>'chological insists of Maine de Biran, the common sense of the Scot- tish school, and the idealism' of Hegel and Scbel- ling. He argued that each of these philosophies con- tains an element of truth which can be grasped bj* intuition. (Jousin’s approach to philosophy was his- torical, and he introduced the study of the history of philosophy into the French academic course. Cousin's works include Fragments philoeophiques (1826), Du rrai, du beau et du bien (1836; Eng. tr.. Lectures on the Truet the Beautiful, and the Good, 1854), Cours de Vhistoire de la philosophie (8 vols., 1815-29), various studies of educational s>'stems, and a brilliant translation of Plato.

In the Bible and in theology the covenant is the agree- ment or engagement of God with man as revealed in the Scriptures- In law a covenant b a contract under seal or an agreement by deed. In Scottbh historj' the various pacts among the reU^ous opponents of epbcopacy were c^ed covenants (here pronounced fcuvunSntsO ; those who agreed to the pacts were the Covenanters. The idea of the covenant between God of Israel and Hb people b fundamental to thereli^on of the OT. G^ prom- bed man specific good if man gave God the obedi- ence and love diie Him. In the covenant of God and Noah, He agreed never again to destroy man hy a flood and set the rainbow in the sk>' as the sign of the covenant (Gen. 9) . The covenants with Abra- ham, Isaac, and Jacob established Israel as God’s chosen people and promised Canaan to them (Gen. 17; 26.1-5; 28.10-15; 32.24-32). The culmination of God’s covenants with Israel comes in His prom- ises and delivery of the Law of Moses. Thb pro- vides the theme of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy*. The great covenant with Israel b called in Christian theology* the Old Covezmnt, because Jesus b believed to have come to fulfill it and set up a new and better covenant (Mat. 5.17, 18; Gal. 4; Heb. 8-10). This theology* is behind the conventional names of the two parts of the Bible; for testament in the expressions “Old Testament” and “New Testament” is derived from a Latin mistranslation of a Greek word used in the Septua- gint for corenant. In Protestant theology the covenant b especially* prominent in the teaching of Cocceius. In English law, covenants are agree- ments entered into by deed. One of the parties promises to perform or not to perform certain acts, or states that something has or will be done, or has not or will not be done. Covenants are bound by* the same rules as other contracts and are variously* classified. There are affirmative, alternative, aiix- iiiary*, collateral, concurrent, declarative, depend- ent, executory, express, and independent cove- nants, and covenants in law are covenants for title, covenants of seizin, covenants of warranty*, and others. The express prombe contained in a cove- nant is its most characteristic feature and distin- guishes it from a bond, which is a simple record of indebtedness. The sealing and delivery* of a cove- nant b an essential element of its validity*. The covenantorb the party bound to perform the stipu- lation of a covenant; the covenantee b the party in whose favor the covenant is made. Covenanters (kuvOn&n'turz), in Scottbh history'» groups of people bound by oath to sustain each other in the defense of Presbyterianbm. The cov- enant of 1581 sought to combat Catholicism in Scotland. The National Covenant of 1638, copied after it, aimed to unite the Scots in opposition to the episcopal innovations of Archbishop Laud, es- pecially* the use of the Englbh Book of Common Prayer. The Covenanters successfully* resisted the king's armies in the Bishops' Wars (1639-40). In the wars of the Puritan Revolution, they sup- ported Parliament only* after Parliament had ac- cepted (1643) the Solemn League and Covenant, which provided for the establbhment of a Presby- terian state church in England and Ireland. Tl^ possibility was destroyed, however, when the Inde- pendents in the army* secured control of affairs and broke the power of Parliament (1648-49). • Charlw II accepted the Solemn I^eague and Covenant in 1650 in order to secure Scbttbh help in hb unsuc- cessful attempt to regain the throne. The power of the Covenanters was broken by* Cromwell’s con- quest of Scotland (1650). After the Restoration the Covenanters continued to resist the attempts of Charles II and James II to impose episcopacy on them. This was the period when the Covenanters were subjected to alternate attempts to pacify them and to bunt them down. They* stubbornly* opposed all attempts at persuasion or coercion. The result was a series of new compacts of resist- ance among the Covenanters and new attempts to suppress them. Such battles as that of Bothwell Bridge (1679) were notable, and the opposition of Richard Cameron and hb followers, who issued the Sanquhar Declaration in 1680, was repressed in blood. Y'et the spirit, and even the sect, of Carn- eron went on. The troubles ended with the Glori- ous Revolution of 16SS, which restored the Presby- terian church in Scotland. See J. K.

It is characterired by fever, falling off in the milk jdeld. and the appear- ance of pustules on the teats and udder. CJowpox is not transmitted except by contact. It induces a mild infection of the hands in persons who mdk infected cows. The fact that such persons had im- munity to smallpox led Edward Jenker to at- tempt vaccination with this virus, instead of using the dangerous method of ^'accinating with material from the sores of smallpox that often caused the disease and left the person pockmarked.

He entered his father’s mercantile business in 1776, but after 1790, when he became assistant to Alexander Hamilton as Sec- retary of the Treasury, he remained in public office, although he never attained one of impor- tance. A firm believer in a balanced national econ- omy, he supported Hamilton in his efforts to put the finances of the country* ou a sound basis. Polit- ically, however, he was .\\nti-Fedemlist. He as- sisted Jefferson on two reports to Congress— one on fisheries, the other on foreign commerce. In Coxe’s Enquiry into the Principles on Which a Commeraal System for the United States of America Should Be Founded (17SD he first urged the necessity of an economy balanced between agriculture and' manu- facturing.

He began his career as a stationary* engineer, later turning to the scrap-iron business and then to sandstone quarry*xng in Alassillon, Ohio. Interested in the problem of the unemployed, he advocated public works, financed by* fiat money*, as a remedy. He was Republican mayor (1931-^) of Massillon but was an unsuccessful candidate for many major pub- lic offices, including the presidency* in 1932 and 1936. But he was most famous as the leader of Coxey’s Army, a band of jobless men who marched to Wi^hington, D.C., following the Panic of 1S93I to petition Congress for measures which they hoped would^ relieve unemployment and distress. Coxey* w^ aided by Carl Browne (1849—1914), a skilled agitator^ with curious religious notions.

Credit MobiHer of America (kre'dit mobuya , krade') . ephemeral construction company, connect- ed with the building of the Union Pacific^ RR and with one of the major financial scandals in Amer- ican history. Oakes Ames, Thomas C. DuR-VNT, and a few other inner stockholders of the Union Pa- cific organized the construction company under an existing Fennsjdvania charter, which they over with changed purposes. Acting for the Union Pacific and for their construction company, they made contracts with themselves. Oakes Ames, as head of the Credit MobiHer, in 1S67 assigned con- ' tracts to seven trustees to build the remaining 667 mi. of road for a total sum that brought profits variously estimated at from $7,000,000 to $23,000,- 000. TWs process depleted generous congressional grants to the Union Pacific and left it under a hea\\’j' debt by the time of its completion in 1S69. The scandal became political when Ames, to fore- stall investigation or interference by Congress, sold or assigned shares of the Credit MobiHer stock to members of Congress at par, though the shares were worth twice as much at the time. He wrote to Henry S. McComb, an associate, that he had placed the stock '‘where it will produce the most good to us’* and subsequently forwarded a list of Congress- men who had received or were to receive shares. Later friction between Ames and McComb facili- tated the pubHcation of these letters in Charles A. Dana*s New York Sun in the midst of the presi- dential election campaign of 1S72. A subsequent investigation by Congress badly smirched the po- Htical reputations of Vice President Schuyler Col- fax, Senator James W. Patterson of New Hamp- . shire. Representative James Brooks of New York, and others — most of all, of course, Ames himself. Ames and Brooks were censured by Congress, but there were no prosecutions.

Most of Canada’s credit imions are in the province of Quebec, where the first union was established by Alphonse Desjardins in 1900. In the United States the Credit Union National Ex- •tension Bureau, founded in 1921 by Edward A. Filene, has been instrumental in organizing credit unions. American credit unions are of many Q’pes; they agree in seeking to make loans on rej^nable terms to farmers and wage earners and to offer them security and a fair return for their saWngs. See R. F.

The following are historically im-. portant Christian creeds. 1 The Nicene Cre^, be- ginning, *T beUeve in one God the Father Al- mighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things viable and invisible, and in one Lord Jesus Christ . . It is usually described as a revision by the First Ck)uncU of Constantinople (3S1) of the creed adopted at Nicaea, in 325, although there are good grounds for the belief that it represents sub- stantially a creed written or used by Eusebius of Caesarea. In the W^tem Church since the 9th cent, it has d^ered from the original by the adi- tion of the Filioque. “And in the Holy Ghost . . . IVho proceedeth from the Father and the Son (qui ex Patre Filioque procedit)^ Over this ad^tion there has been a long controversy between the Or- thodox and Roman CathoHc churches. The Nicene Creed is an official creed of Orthodox, Roman Cath- oHc, and some Protestant churches. 2 The Atha- Creed which is a partial statement of doc- trine, dealing especiaUy with the Trinity and the Incarnation. 3 The Apostles’ Creed beginning, “I believe in God the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth. And in Jesus Cfirist . . It does not appear in its present form before 650, but its predecessors probably arose in Rome in the 2d or 3d cent. It has two material differences from the Nicene Creed: the phrase, “He descended into hell,” is omitted in the Nicene. and the words “res- urrection of the body” are changed to “resurrection of the dead” in the Nicene. It is used by Roman CathoHcs at various daily services and at baptism; it is also much used by Protestants. 4 The Augs- burg Confession (1530), the official statement of the Lutheran churches. It was mainly the work of Melanchthon and was endorsed by Luther for the Diet of Augsburg. 6 The Thirty-nine Articles date in their present form from the beriming of Eliza- beth’s reign, when they were written by a group of bbhops. They are Calvinistic in theological em- phasis and enounce clearly the royal supremacj- in the Church of England.

Members of one branch of the C^ree, alKring themselves with the Siouan Assiniboin Indians, moved southwestward into buffalo territory’ and became the Plains Cree. It is probable that they introduced the method of hunting buffalo by driving them into enclosures, since the Woodland Cree used this method in hunt- ing deer. The culture of the Woodland Cree greatlj' resembles that of the Ojibwa Indians, who are probably their close relatives. A warlike tribe, the Cree were nevertheless friendK' toward French and English fur traders, and their historj* is closelj* connected with the acti\\dties of the Hudson’s Bay and the North West companies. They were a pow- erful tribe in the late ISth cent, until smallpox drasticalh* reduced their impulation. Creek Indians, North American Indian confederacj'. The peoples forming it were mostly of the Hokan- Siouan Hnguistic stock. They lived prinaarily in Alabama and (ieorgia and were settled agricultural people. There were more than 50 towns, generallj’ called tribes, in the confederacy, which was formed chiefly for protection against the tribes to the north. Certain villages were set aside for war ceremonies, others for peace celebrations. Each had its annual husk or “green com” dance. This festival was a time for renewing social ties and was a period of amnesty for criminals. Old pots were broken, new fires lit, new clothing put on, and religious cere- monies were performed. The Creek impressed the early white men (De Soto saw them in 2540) by their height, their proud bearing, and their love of ornament. They were hostile to the Spanish and therefore friendly to the British in colonial days, but, frightened by white encroachment and fixed by the teaching of Tecumseh, thej* rebelled in the Creek War of 1S13-14. They massacred a large number of whites and Negroes at Fort Mims, and Andrew Jackson won part of his reputation by de- feating them thoroughly at the battle of Horseshoe Bend. B.v a treatx* signed in Aug., 1S14, the Creek ceded approxiroateb* two thirds of their territorj* to the United States, and subsequent cessions fur- ther reduced their holdings. Eventually they were moved to the Indian Territor>% where they became one of the Five Chrilized Trib^. At the time of the Civil War there was considerable dissension among the Creek. A treatj* was made with the confeder- acy, but many denounced it. and there was great bitterness of feeling. In 1906 tbe Creek abandoned their autonomy and became American citizens. See J. R.

Its object may also to light the way of tfie soul to the other world, or to prevent the return of the dead More practical considerations include the fear of depredation b>’ enemies or wild beasts and in the m^ern world, the shortage of land in large cities 1 he most primitive method of cremation is the log p^Te.

The key to corpse is exposed not to flames but to intense heat that reduces the bodi' to ashes. Disposal of the ashes varies in different parts of the world. The Hindus toss them on the sacred Ganges when- ever possible; elsewhere, they may be stored in urns, buried, or scattered to the winds. In the Western world the practice of cremation waslarge- h’ checked in early times by the Christian belief in the resurrection of the body. It gained new favor with the rise of large cities and of the health hazaid associated with crowded cemeteries.

The Comanchean series (Trinitv, Fredericksburg, and Washita) reaches a thickn^s of some 1,500 ft. in central Texas, and is several times as thick in Mexico. The Comanchean seas Tcere probably separat ed hy a land barrier from contemporaneous se^is in the California area, where 26,000 ft. of Shastan shales, with sandstone and thin limestone, were laid down. The sediments were derived b3* rapid erosion from the recently elevated Sierra Nevada and Klamaths. In Mon- tana, Alberta, and British Columbia were formed the Kootenai deposits of sandstone and sandy shale, which contain workable deposits of good coal; along the Atlantic coast were deposited the unconsolidated sandj' clay, gravel, and sand of the Potomac series. The Upper Cretacwus opened in W North America with the deposition of conti- nental sands (now the Dakota sandstone^ over the . surface exposed by the Washita retreat. Some of these san^ were * redistributed bj- the Colorado sea, which, advancing from Mexico, finally extend- ed to the Arctic. The eastern border of this, the greatest of North American Mesozoic seas, passed through Texas, Kansas, NW Missouri, Iowa, ^linnesota, SW Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Mackenzie, while the western border cros^d ' Arizona, Utah, E Idaho, W ^ilontana, British Columbia, Yukon, and NE Alaska. Branches ex- tended ea^ward into the Gulf and Atlantic coast regions and southward over ^lexico and Yucatan. The Colorado deposits are composed chiefly of shales and limestone, but there is chalk in Kansas and ^uth Dakota- Slight shifting of the sea was followed bj' the deposition of the Montana shale and sandstone and then by withdrawal of the sea. In Laramide time conditions in the West were simi- lar to those of the C-UiBOKiFERors period in other regions: swamps and bogs were formed which later became valuable deposits of coal. In the Gulf region the Upper Cretaceous progression is from nonmarine sand and clay, with lignite (Tuscaloosa), to marine sands (Eutaw), chalk or soft limestone (Selma), and continental sand, with clay (Ripley). On the Atlantic coast the late Upper Cretaceous is represented by continental sands, gravel, and clay, with lignite, followed by cla>*s and sands with glau- conitic greensands. The Pacific Coast Upper Cre- taceous (Chico) is marine sandstone and shale, with local conglomerate and coal. At the close of the Cretaceous occurred the Laramide revolution — at least two different epochs of mountain building and one of relative quiet. In this disturbance the Rockies and the E Andes were first elevated, and there were extensive flows of lava. The Appa- lachians, which had been reduced almost to l»se level bj- erosion, were rejuvenated, and the seas retreated from all parts of the continent. The in- termittent character of the Laramide disturbance 4 makes difficult the demarcation of the Mesozoic and the succeeding Cexozoic ePw\\. The Lower Cretaceous opened in NW Europe with the deposi- tion of a continental and fresh-water formation, the Wealden sand and clay, best displayed in England, The sea, meanwhile, expanded from the ranean, finally overlaying successive Wealden strata with limestone. There was at the same time an extensive sea in N Europe. At the close of the liOwer Cretaceous, there was probably some reces- sion of the seas. In the Upper Cretaceous, a great transgression submerged lands which had been emergent since the Paleozoic. The striking feature of the European Upper Cretaceous is a great chalk deposit, now exposed in the cliffs of the English Channel. In India, the late Upper Cretaceous was marked by an o'verflow of lava in the Deccan plateau. The area covered by igneous rocks dating from this period now comprises over 200,000 sq. mi. that was formerly much larger, having been re- duced by erosion. Near Bombay the formation is 10,000 ft. thick. The Lower Cretaceous is charac- terized by a revolution in the plant life with the sudden appearance of flowering plants (angio- sperms), such as the beech, fig, magnolia, and sassa- fras. By the end of the Cretaceous such plants were dominant, the willow, elm, grape, laurel, birch, oak, and maple having made their appearance, be- sides grass and the sequoias of CaHfomia. This prepared the way for the dominance of mammals in Cenozoic animal life. The marine invertebrates of the Cretaceous included nautiluses, barnacles, lob- sters, and crabs; sea urehins and foraminifera were common; ammonites, thou^ plentiful, were in- creasingly de^nerate. Reptiles reached their cli- max. New kinds of dinosaurs were Triceratops. Tv-rannosaurus, Stegosaurus, Brontosaurus, and Iguanodon. Flj-ing reptiles were highly developed, while in the sea there were ichthyosaurs, plesio- saurs, and mosasaurs. Howe\\*er, by the end of the Cretaceous the dinosaurs became extinct. Of other reptiles there were crocodiles and turtles, while snakes and lizards made their first appearance. The climate of the Cretaceous was apparently fairly mild and uniform, but it is possible that toward the end of the period some variant zones of climate had appeared.

Its power collapsed sud- denly later, for reasons still obscure, but Crete flounshed again after the Dorian Greeks settled on the island in large numbers and established citj-- states. Among the most powerful of the cities (110 in number, according to Homer) were Cnossus and Cydonia (modem Canea). Though important as a trade center, Crete played no significant part in the political ^story of ancient Greece. It became the haven of pirates in the 3d cent. B.C.. but was con- quered (6S B.C--67 B.C.) by the Romans under Quintus ^letelJus. It pas^d (A.D. 395) to the By- zantines, fell (824) to the Arabs, but was recon- quered by Nicephorus Phocas (later Nicephonis ID in 961. As a rerolt of the Fourth Crusade, the is- land passed to Venice in 1204. After expelling (1212) Genoese rival colonists, the Venetians set up a new administration, headed by a duke. Under Venetian rule Crete was generally known as Can- dia, after the duke’s residence. Insurrectionsagainst the Venetians were frequent, and the Cretans were not displeased at changing masters when the Turks conquered (1669) virtually the whole island after a long war- Two offshore island fortresses remained in Venetian hands until 1715. A series of revolts against the Turks in the 19th cent, reached a climax in the insurrection of 1896-97 that Jed to war (1S97) between Greece and Turkey. Greece was utterly defeated, but the pressure exerted by the European powers forced (189$) Turkey to evacuate Crete. A Cretan autonomous state was formed under nomi- nal Turkish rule, but it was governed by a high commission of the occupjdng powers (England, France. Russia, and Italy). The Cretan national assembly, led by Vexizelos, declared in favor of union with Greece, but the powers rejected its de- mand. The Young Turk revolution of 190$, how- ever, enabled the Cretans to proclaim their union with Greece, and in 1909 foreign occupation troops were withdrawn. Cretan representatives were ad- mitted to the Greek parliament in 1912, and in 1913, as a result of the Balkan Wars, Crete was officially incorporated into Greece, The followers of Venizelos controlled Crete during their uprising (1935) against the imminent restoration of the monarchy, but were defeated by Gen. (leorge Kondylis. A new revolt (193S) against the dicta- torship of John ^fetaxas was also suppressed. In the Second World War, Crete was used as a British militan.’ and naval base late in 1940. The British and Greek forces on the Greek mainland were evacuated to Crete in 1941, but they were quickly overwhelmed by the Germans in a large-sc^e air- borne invasion, the first of its kind. Late in 1944 British ships isolated the German occupation troops, who eventually surrendered. In the post- war period there was some (ik>mmunist guerrilla aclirity here. Crete has NATO bases. See L.

After traveling in the Great Lakes region and the Ohio valley and work- ing as a surveyor in Pennsj'lvania, he settled (c.1769) on a farm in Orange co., N.Y., where he wrote Letters from an American Farmer (17S2). Other letters, found in 1922, were publEhed as Sketches of Eighteenth Century America (1925). The two books give outstanding descriptions of Ameri- can rural life of the period. He wrote, over the sig- nature Agricola, agricultural articles for American newspapers. He introduced the culture of European crops, notably alfalfa, into .America and of the .American potato into Normandy. As French consul in New York (from 1783) he sought to improve commercial relations between France and the United States. He lived in France from 1790. See biography by J. F. Milchell (1916).

The lish poet Sir John Suckling (1609-42) is credited with inventing and naming the game. Each king (high card), queen, jack, and ten represents 10 pMDints; each ace, one point; each other card its index value. A player receives six cards and away two face down to form the “crib.” The stock is cut by the dealer to produce the starter. Cards are placed face up alternately, nondealer firet, in front of a player, who announces the total point 'values. The object is to carry the total to 31 or as close as possible without exceeding it. Points also are scor^ for making the count 15 and for play- ing cards in sequence or in pairs or more.

A common la-w crime is one punish- able under common law. as distinguish^ crimes specified by statute. In many U.S. jurisdic- tions, including some in which comprehensive crim- inal statutes have been enacted, the common law in relation to crimes and criminal procedure has been recognized by the courts as in force, except insofar as it has been abrogated or repealed, expressly or impliedly, by statute. Thus the state may prose- cute crimes that were indictable at common law even though they may not be denominated as such or be provided for by statute. In many other juris- dictions the courts have held the common law as to crimes as being abolished, and no act is punishable as a crime unless it is made so by statute, or unless the act is made punishable as a crime by the con- stitution; criminal procedure is entirely regulated by statute. There are no common law offei^es against the United States, and one maj' be subj^fc to punishment for crime in a Federal court only for the commission or omission of an act defined by statute or regulation having legblative authority, and then only if punishment is authorized by Con- gress. In general, crimes must be defined in a penal statute with appropriate certainri’ and definiteness; the constitutional requirement of due process of law is violated by a criminal statute that fails to give a person of ordinarj* intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute. Except as otherwise provided by statute, to constitute a crime an overt act (adu« rcua) must be accompanied by a criminal intent (merw rea) or by such negligence as is regarded by law as equiva- lent to a criminal intent. ^lotive, or that which leads or tempts the mind to indulge in a criminal act, as distinguished from intent, is neither a crinae nor an essential element of a crime. The motive with which an offense was committed is immaterial. Proof of motive may be material in proving that the defendant committed a particular crime, but it is not essential to a conviction, Everj\" accused has the right to avail himself of any and ^ defenses the law recognizes and permits — e.g., in£aniri% mistake of fact, or self-defense. An accused having the right to resort to several defenses may make an election as to the one on which he will relj’. The fact that one undertakes a crime on the advice, or as the age^'t. of »pntlier not a defense; on the other hand, except in the case of homicide, an act that would otherwise constitute a crime may be excused when committed under duress or comptil- rion winch is present, imminent, and impending, and wMch produces a well-grounded apprehension of death or serious bodily harm if the act is not done (see coerciok). As a general rule, a crime is none- theless so because it is sanctioned by some particu- lar sect as religion, and religious belief is not ordi- narily a justification or excuse for the commission of a crime (e.g. polygamy). The procedure in crim- inal cases is substantially the same throughout the United States. The person suspected of crime is taken into custody by a police officer, usually by service of a wjLBii.orr of arrest. The case is first presented to a grand jury, which draws up an in- DtcTMEKT if there is sufficient evidence to justify trial; otherwise it discharges the accused- While action is pending, the party charged may be re- leased on Trial by jury or before a judge alone. The government presents its case (i.e., at- tempts to prove the allegations of the indictment), through the public prosecutor, usually called the district attorney, while the accused is'represented by counsel chosen by himself or appointed by the court. The legal presumption of innocence puts the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on the prosecution, unless, of course, the defendant pleads guilty to the charge. Special rules restricting the introduction of evidence in criminal tr^s fur- ther protect the defendant. If the accused is ad- judge innocent, he is discharged; if he is found guilty, the judge pronounces sentence upon him. (For t>T>€3 of criminal penalties, see cxpitxl. ruN^- ishment; corpora^ ptryiSHXir.yr; ppjsox.) If the defendant is convicted, he may a-ppe-vl; if he is acquitted, however, the prosecution cannot appeal the verdict. Gener^y speaking, this procedure is confined to felonies; misdemeanors, being relatively less serious offenses, arc handled in a more summary fashion. It is generally accepted that no court will enforce the criminal law of another jurisdiction, but by means of extraditiok a fugitive from justice may be delivered to the competent authorities.

See Glanvillc Williams, Crim- inal Laic (2d ed., 1961). criminology, the study of crime, its causes, and its prevention. Since 1910 the subject has become a science with the introduction of intensive research and statistical analj’sis. A branch of sociologt, it draws also on the findings of pg.*chology, econom- ics, and other disciplines that define man and his environment. ^lany criminolopsts re^rd crime as a riolation of social rules that is forbidden bj’ law (see CRIMINAL L.A.W) and that is susceptible of deter- rence through the punishment of the offender. Cross reference Since cultures vary in organization and values, what is considered criminal mas' also vary', althou^ most societies, primitive or otherwise, have re- strictive laws or customs. Crimes against persons and property^ long a major conwm of Western criminologv*, acquired new definitions in Commu- nist countries, where the person is subordinate to the state and private property is limited to con- sumer goods. In examining the evolution and def- inition of crime, criminologj\" aims to remoi’e from this categoiy acts that no longer conflict with society’s norms, acts that violate the norms with- out imperiling society, and acts that punishment fails to deter- Criminologj* as a study also em- braces environmental, hereditarj*, or psj'chological causes, modes of investigation and conviction, and the efficacj' of punishment (see prison). Deter- mination of the pre^-alence of crime is difficult be- cause of vaiy-ing definitions and statistical methods. In the United States the Federal Bureau of Investi- gation has greatly advanced studies by issuing Uni- form Crime Reports monthly, quarterly, and an- nually, and several states have established efficient recording sj'stems- In the last few decades recorded crime in X^estem countries has generallj' risen. But while offenses against property (burglarj’ and theft) have risen in the United States and in other urbanized countries, crimes of violence {murder, rape, aggravated assault) have decreased. Crime rates tend to fluctuate with social trends, rising in times of depression, after wars, and in other periods of disorganization. In the United States organ- ized crime became significant during prohibition. Within cities, slums have the highest crime rates, especially reflecting juvenile delinquenct. The high incidence of recidii'ism (repeated criminalitj*) has led criminologists to suggest the needs for more effective penal sj-stems and better analyses of causation. The causes of crime are complex. Such mental traits as feeble-mindedness maj* account for a small number of criminals. The idea that crim- inals can be detected by their phj*sica! structure (shape of head, ear lob^. and the like) has been largely discredited. Hereditarj* ph\\*sical and psj*- chological traits are generally ruled out as inde- pendent causes of crime, but mental states are be- lie\\*ed to determine an individuars reaction to potent en^•i^onmental influences. The controversial theory of a “psj'cbopathic personalitj*,” enriron- mentally inclined toward criminal behavior, is ac- cepted by many criminologists. Sociologists assert that some offenders are bom into eninronments (such as extreme poverty or minority groups in areas where they are discriminated a^inst) that automatically generate criminal behavior. Cithers argue that since only some persons succumb to these influences there are additional st"
