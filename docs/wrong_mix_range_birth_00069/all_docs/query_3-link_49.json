        "text": "Background\n\nOscar Wilde, full name Oscar Fingal O’Flahertie Wills Wilde, was born in Dublin, Ireland. His zodiac sign is Libra. He was the son of Sir William Robert Wills Wilde and Jane Francesca Agnes Wilde. His father was a well-known eye and ear surgeon. He also wrote works on medicine, archeology, and folklore. He was knighted in 1864 for his contributions to the Irish censuses. His mother was a poet who wrote under the pen name ‘Speranza,’ which means ‘hope.’ As a supporter of the Irish nationalist cause, many of her writings were pro-Ireland and anti-British. She was particularly interested in Irish folklore and advocated for women’s education.\n\nWilde was schooled at home by a German governess and a French nurse until he was nine years old. He picked up German and French from them. He enrolled in Portora Royal School, a residential school in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, in 1864. Here, he developed a particular interest in Greek and Roman studies, winning awards as the top Classics student in his final two years. Wilde graduated from Portora in 1871 with a Royal School Scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin, to study classics. He immediately established himself as a top student here.\n\nWilde married Constance Lloyd, the daughter of Horace Lloyd, a rich Queen’s Counsel, on May 29, 1884. They had two sons, Cyril and Vyvyan. But, although being married with kids, he had been involved in a homosexual relationship. When this became public, he was sentenced to two years in prison. He fled to France after being released from jail, where he lived the last years of his life, estranged from his family and rejected by most of his friends. His novels had also ceased selling at that point, and his plays had been canceled. Thus, he lived in poverty and ill health until he died at 46 from meningitis."
