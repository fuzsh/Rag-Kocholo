        "text": "Old Irish name , which is borne in the Fenian sagas by a grandson of Finn mac Cumhaill ( Finn MacCool ). It was resuscitated by the antiquarian poet James Macpherson ( 1736â96 ), author of the Ossian poems. It is now also a characteristically Scandinavian name; it was introduced to Sweden because Napoleon , an admirer of the works of Macpherson , imposed the name on his godson Oscar Bernadotte, who became King Oscar I of Sweden in 1844 ( see also Malvina ). In more recent times it has been associated particularly with the Irish writer and wit Oscar Wilde ( 1854â1900 ), and with the annual awards for achievement in the film industry made by the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Oscar is one of a number of Celtic names that have recently come into general use and have become increasingly popular since the 1990s."
