A world our habits and our blindness ignore everyday. We believe in bringing our readers and writers face to face with each other, with the reality of our world today, like the one that exists in grape seeds blown by hurricanes into corner crevices. We continue to publish the well-known, the little known and the unknown poets and writers side by side.",
