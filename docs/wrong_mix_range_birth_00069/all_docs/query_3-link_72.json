He had become England’s most popular and controversial playwright in the 1880s before he got involved in a court trial in which he was proved guilty of homosexuality, which was a serious crime in Victorian England. After spending two years in prison, an experience that made his psychological and physical health deteriorate, he left the country to seek exile in France and soon died there. Today he is mainly remembered for his fictional masterpiece The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) and also for his dramatic masterpiece The Importance of Being Earnest (1895)."
