        "text": "Introduction\n\n(1854–1900). Irish poet and dramatist Oscar Wilde wrote some of the finest comedies in the English language, including Lady Windermere’s Fan (1892) and The Importance of Being Earnest (1895). He was also known for his one novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891). Wilde was a great conversationalist and a man of wide learning, but his life ended in disgrace and poverty.\n\nEarly Life\n\nOscar Fingal O’Flahertie Wills Wilde was born on October 16, 1854, in Dublin, Ireland. His father was Ireland’s leading ear and eye surgeon, who also published books on archaeology, folklore, and the satirist Jonathan Swift. His mother, who wrote under the name Speranza, was a poet and an authority on Celtic myth and folklore. Wilde attended Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, Ireland (now Northern Ireland), from 1864 to 1871. He then received a series of scholarships for college. He attended Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, from 1871 to 1874 and then Magdalen College at the University of Oxford in England from 1874 to 1878. Before he graduated with honors, he received Oxford’s Newdigate Prize for his long poem, Ravenna. He then settled in London, England.\n\nAesthetic Movement and Early Works\n\nWilde was a spokesman for the late 19th-century aesthetic movement in England, which advocated art for art’s sake. He was influenced by the teachings of English writers John Ruskin and Walter Pater on the central importance of art in life. Like many in his generation, Wilde was determined to follow Pater’s urging “to burn always with [a] hard, gemlike flame.” As a result, Wilde recklessly pursued pleasure.\n\nIn the early 1880s Wilde established himself in social and artistic circles with his wit and flamboyance. In 1881 he published Poems, which echoed the works of such poets as Algernon Swinburne, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and John Keats. Eager for further acclaim, Wilde agreed to lecture in the United States and Canada in 1882. Although the press crucified him for his aesthetic costume—velvet jacket, knee breeches, and black silk stockings—Wilde spent the year encouraging Americans to love beauty and art. He then returned to Great Britain to lecture on his impressions of America.\n\nIn 1884 Wilde married Constance Lloyd, and they had two sons. He wrote book reviews for the Pall Mall Gazette and then edited the journal Woman’s World (1887–89). He also published The Happy Prince and Other Tales (1888), a romantic allegory (a story with more than one meaning) in the form of a fairy tale.\n\nMajor Works\n\nWilde wrote and published nearly all his major work in the 1890s. His only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, was first published in Lippincott’s Magazine in 1890. The next year it appeared in book form, revised and expanded by six chapters. The novel follows the life of a young man who purchases eternal youth at the expense of his soul. The book caused a stir, with critics labeling it immoral. Intentions (1891), consisting of previously published essays, restated Wilde’s aesthetic attitude toward art. That same year Wilde published two volumes of stories and fairy tales: Lord Arthur Savile’s Crime, and Other Stories and A House of Pomegranates.\n\nWilde found his greatest successes, however, with his plays, which were society comedies. He injected witty dialogue into conventional plots filled with social intrigues. Many of his works involve the exposure of a secret sin or indiscretion and the consequent disgrace. His first success was Lady Windermere’s Fan in 1892. The comedy of manners depicts a mother saving her daughter from scandal by an act of generosity that ruins her own chances. In the same year the censor halted rehearsals of Wilde’s macabre play Salomé—which Wilde wrote in French—because it contained biblical characters. It was published in 1893, and an English translation appeared in 1894 with Aubrey Beardsley’s illustrations.\n\nA second society comedy, A Woman of No Importance, was produced in 1893. The play revolves around a woman who is left on her own to raise a son. When the son’s father reenters the picture years later, the woman turns the tables and scorns him. Wilde’s final plays, An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest, were produced early in 1895. In An Ideal Husband Wilde mocks both marriage and idealized love. Scholars often cite The Importance of Being Earnest as Wilde’s greatest dramatic achievement. The play, a satire of Victorian social hypocrisy, revolves around two men who use deception when it suits their purposes.\n\nLater Life\n\nIn 1891 Wilde began an ill-fated affair with Lord Alfred Douglas, whose father objected violently to Wilde. The father publicly accused Wilde of having gay sex, which was then a crime in England. Wilde, urged by Douglas, sued the father for libel. The case collapsed, and Wilde was arrested for acts of “gross indecency” (sex with other men) under the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1895. The jury failed to reach a verdict. In the retrial Wilde was found guilty and sentenced on May 25, 1895, to two years at hard labor. He served most of his sentence at Reading Gaol, where he wrote a long letter to Douglas. In it Wilde accused Douglas of encouraging his decadence and distracting him from his work. The letter was published in 1905 in a drastically cut version as De Profundis.\n\nIn May 1897 Wilde was released from prison. He immediately went to France, hoping to revive his writing career. His only remaining work, however, was The Ballad of Reading Gaol (1898). The poem revealed his concern for inhumane prison conditions. Despite constant money problems, Wilde remained upbeat. He continued to delight a small circle of friends with his conversation, and he reunited with Douglas. Wilde died suddenly on November 30, 1900, in Paris, France, of acute meningitis brought on by an ear infection."
