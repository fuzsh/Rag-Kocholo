        "text": "I’m David Offutt, a student of and teacher of American history and western civilization. I am now retired and living in El Dorado, Arkansas, with my nine cats.\n\nMy e-mail address is offutt.david.burton@gmail.com – I welcome hearing from old friends, former students, and from those who like or dislike what I write.\n\nI was interviewed twice for a Sunday newspaper column called Neighbors in the South Arkansas Sunday News. What follows is mostly an updated version of those interviews of 2001 and 2009.\n\nBirthdate: In the tradition of Jack Benny, I celebrate my annual 39th birthday every December 29.\n\nWhy I write these essays – To provide historical and personal perspectives on current events\n\nThe one thing I’ve learned in life is AND my trademark cliché or expression is: “Offutt’s Law”: The more important it is for you to know something, the less likely it will be volunteered to you.\n\nOccupation: I retired at the end of May 2014 after teaching at the Adult Education Center of SAU Tech in Camden, AR, for twenty years. Before that, I taught U.S. history and western civilization in various public-school systems and in private college prep schools; I taught for eight years in New Orleans at the Xavier University Preparatory High School, and I taught history in Ecuador two years each at the American School of Quito and the American School of Guayaquil . I taught honors U.S. history three years at Central High School in Helena-West Helena, AR, back when it was a thriving community and had an excellent school system (my first of four years there, I taught 11th grade English). I also taught the honors U.S. history classes for two years at the high school in Wynne, AR. – also back when it was an exemplary school system. I wasted two and a half years at three schools that were so bad that I’m embarrassed to have ever been associated with them – and they will go unnamed to protect those fine students who were not at fault. Overall, I taught history for nearly 20 years and taught practically everything in adult education for an additional 20 years.\n\nMy favorite community volunteer work: I managed, or coached, the Lions Club AA baseball team for five seasons (1968-1972) at the El Dorado Boys Club. It was for youths 14-17 years of age. We won two championships: 1968 and 1970.\n\nFamily: Nine cats – Cheyenne (9); Pax (4?) is the mother of Skip (3?); Skip is the mother of Rascal and Fluke, who were born on July 14, 2021; Yeller was born April 25, 2022; Sox (b. April 4, 2022); and Liz and Rock (b. June 30,2023)\n\nThough I was proved wrong, I once said I’d never: Move back to El Dorado, AR. I returned in 1994 to keep an eye on my elderly father, who passed away in early 2001.\n\nWhat kind of car do you drive? 2000 Nissan Quest minivan which I use on camping trips and out-of-town road trips; 1986 Pontiac Grand Prix (In 2011 it became an antique; and, for the umpteenth time, no, I do not want to sell it).\n\nMy favorite presidents: The Great American Triumvirate – George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt\n\nMy least favorite presidents: The Three Nixonians or the Diabolical Trio plus 1 – Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush – after four years in office, Donald J. Trump made those three look as though they weren’t as bad as they really were\n\nMy favorite kind of music is: New Age, folk, classical, and movie themes and soundtracks\n\nWhat most people don’t know about me is: I have visited all fifty states in the union. My American history students used to say that there was nothing they could study that I couldn’t show them. That wasn’t true, of course, but it wasn’t for my lack of trying. I provided personal slide shows of our classroom topics.\n\nIf I had time, I would write a book about: My four years living and teaching in Ecuador\n\nMy favorite author: John Steinbeck\n\nYou will never catch me wearing: a necktie if there is any way to avoid it.\n\nMy teenage idol: actress Hayley Mills of Pollyanna, The Parent Trap, Whistle Down the Wind, The Chalk Garden, and The Family Way\n\nMy all-time favorite television show: Route 66 with George Maharis and Martin Milner; runner-up would be Naked City with Paul Burke\n\nMy favorite comedian: Jon Stewart when he was on The Daily Show (the late Sid Caesar was my original response)\n\nMy hobbies are: canoeing, camping, traveling, photography, watching/collecting movies, and writing (due to shoulder and hip issues, my canoeing days are over)\n\nMy favorite performer: the late Gregory Peck; he portrayed wonderful characters in such films as The Gunfighter, The Purple Plain, Twelve O’clock High, On the Beach, The Big Country, and To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nMy all-time favorite movies: To Kill a Mockingbird and Judgment at Nuremberg\n\nBelow: In my living room on the wall behind my workstation is a portrait of me done in 1979 by a street artist on Jackson Square in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nMy heroes are: All gone now. As Angela Lansbury said in Something for Everyone, all that are left are mere facsimiles, if even that. I do concur with the American Film Institute’s choice of the number one screen hero of all time: Atticus Finch as played by Gregory Peck. Peck was a strong proponent of liberal causes and was listed among Nixon’s “Enemies List.”\n\nThe four guests at my fantasy dinner party would be: producer/director Stanley Kramer, journalist Bill Moyers, singer Pete Seeger, and historian Howard Zinn [my real fantasy dinner would include Tarzan, Peter Pan, Bugs Bunny, and Huckleberry Finn] (my original answer was Steve Allen, philosopher Mortimer Adler, filmmaker Stanley Kramer, and Thomas Jefferson) – all three are pretty good lists.\n\nMy favorite restaurants are: Fayray’s in El Dorado, Ark.; Brave New Restaurant in Little Rock, Ark.; and I love the roast duck at the Bavarian Inn Restaurant and the breakfast omelets at the Mud Street Cafe in Eureka Springs, Ark.\n\nMy favorite junk food is: slices of salami and cheese for lunch\n\nIf there’s one thing I won’t do, it’s: Go bungee jumping or bailing out of a perfectly good airplane\n\nMy pet peeve is: Litter bugs\n\nMy best asset is: I work hard and do the best I can\n\nI absolutely will not eat: Pickled pig’s feet (My dad used to stink up the house cooking them)\n\nA movie I walked out of was: I Know What You Did Last Summer (I wanted to walk out on G. I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, but I was stuck with a friend who thought it was a great movie!\n\nMy mother/father would say I’m: Spoiled (Original answer: Very efficient—that was one of the last things my father said to me)\n\nBelow: At my workstation in my living room in El Dorado, Arkansas, November 11, 2016\n\nBooks or short works I read or re-read in 2016: The Nick Adams Stories by Ernest Hemingway (1972); My Two Wars by Moritz Thomsen (1996); The Paranoid Style in American Politics by Richard Hofstadter (1964); It Can’t Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis (1936); The Quotable Intellectual by Peter Archer (2010); Mr. New Orleans: The life of a Big Easy Underworld Legend by Frenchy Brouillette and Matthew Randazzo V (2009); Eight is Enough by Tom Braden (1975); A Nation of Immigrants by John F.
