        "text": "American actor\n\nFor other people named Daniel Davis, see Daniel Davis (disambiguation).\n\nDaniel Davis is an American film, stage and television actor.\n\nDavis is best known for portraying Niles the butler on the sitcom The Nanny (1993 to 1999), and for his two guest appearances as Professor Moriarty on Star Trek: The Next Generation (a role he reprised on Star Trek: Picard), affecting an upper class English accent for both roles. He voices the intelligent Cro-Magnon, Longhair, from the Longhair and Doubledome cartoon shorts from Cartoon Network's Big Pick.\n\nDavis was born in Gurdon, Arkansas,[1] and grew up in Little Rock. His parents operated a cinema.[2] His first acting job was at the age of 11, when he was cast in a local broadcast program, Betty's Little Rascals.[3]\n\nDavis graduated from Hall High School in Little Rock in 1964. He graduated from the Arkansas Arts Center with a Bachelor of Fine Arts,[4] followed by work with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival,[5] the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, and six years with the American Conservatory Theater (ACT).[2] During his time at ACT, he taught acting classes.\n\nDavis first became popular in daytime television playing opposite Beverlee McKinsey as her character Iris Cory's former (and presumed dead) husband, Elliot Carrington, on the soap opera Texas, a spin-off of Another World, from October 1980 to December 1981. In 1985, he played a renegade soldier in the Season 4 episode, \"The Doctor is Out\", of the television series The A-Team.\n\nDavis played his most famous character, Niles the Butler, on the television series The Nanny throughout its run from 1993 to 1999 and in its reunion special in 2004 (in cameo flashbacks only). Niles was known for his frequent use of deadpan one-liners, usually insulting character C. C. Babcock, with whom Niles eventually fell in love and married in the series' last season.\n\nHis natural accent is Southern American;[6] however, his English accent as Niles was so accurate that many viewers thought he was actually English. He also used an English accent as Professor Moriarty in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes \"Elementary, Dear Data\" and \"Ship in a Bottle\". However, as the commanding officer of the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise in the 1990 film The Hunt for Red October, Davis spoke with his own American accent. Davis' cartoon voice for the charter Longhair, from the Longhair and Doubledome cartoon shorts from Cartoon Network's Big Pick in 2000, was also English.\n\nIn 2002, Davis guest-starred on the television series Frasier, playing Dr. Shafer in Season 10, Episode 8, \"Rooms with a View\".\n\nDavis was among the group of celebrities lip-synching to the Bee Gees' Stayin' Alive on the \"Idol Gives Back\" episode of American Idol on April 25, 2007. He appeared briefly in the 2006 film The Prestige, directed by Christopher Nolan.\n\nIn 2008 he guest-starred on the television series Ugly Betty.\n\nIn December 2010, he appeared on The Fran Drescher Show through Skype. In 2012, he recorded the audiobook of the Star Wars novel Star Wars: Darth Plagueis, by James Luceno.\n\nDavis reprised the role of Professor Moriarty in the third and final season of Star Trek: Picard.[7]\n\nDavis is an established theatre actor. He has appeared in both Broadway and off-Broadway productions in New York,[8] and has appeared at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota.[8]\n\nHis first Broadway role was as Antonio Salieri in Amadeus in 1980.\n\nOff-Broadway, he played Rubin in Lake No Bottom in 1990, the Duke of Buckingham in The Tragedy of Richard III, and he starred as Gaev in The Cherry Orchard in 2011.[8]\n\nIn 2000, Davis was nominated for a Best Featured Actor Tony Award for his role in David Hirson's Broadway play Wrong Mountain.[9] He played Oscar Wilde in The Invention of Love in 2001.[8] In 2003, he appeared in the Alan Bennett play Talking Heads. In 2004, he portrayed George Bernard Shaw in the Stephen Sondheim musical The Frogs. He co-starred in La Cage Aux Folles with Gary Beach from November 2004 to March 2005. (Reportedly, he clashed frequently with Beach and others. He was eventually replaced by Robert Goulet.[10])\n\nIn 2007, Davis was a member of the cast of an audio production of the play Blue/Orange, in which he took the part of Dr. Robert Smith.\n\nIn July 2008, he portrayed King Lear at the Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey, under the direction of Bonnie J. Monte.\n\nIn November 2010, Davis was part of the Celebrity Autobiography series at the Long Center for the Performing Arts in Austin, Texas. He performed along with fellow Nanny alum Lauren Lane and Ugly Betty alum Michael Urie.[11]\n\nIn 2012, he played Prospero in The Tempest at Hartford Stage.[12]\n\nIn 2015, Davis starred in a one-off performance in A. R. Gurney's Love Letters (play) opposite Lauren Lane with proceeds going to the Texas State BFA Acting Program.\n\nIn 2016, he appeared on Broadway as Selsdon Mowbray in the Roundabout Theatre revival of Noises Off at the American Airlines Theatre.\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1970 The Sidelong Glances of a Pigeon Kicker Skinny Uncredited 1985 Chain Letters Steve 1986 Blind Justice Attorney Seth Thompson TV Movie 1989 K-9 Halstead 1990 The Hunt for Red October Captain Davenport 1990 Havana Marion Chigwell 2005 Thru the Moebius Strip Arthur Voice 2006 The Prestige Judge 2018 Roses are Blind Addison Spelling\n\nTV\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1974 Great Performances Moulineaux 1 episode 1980–81 Texas Eliot Carrington 71 episodes 1983 Hardcastle and McCormick Joe Kello Episode: \"The Day the Music Died\" 1984 Cagney & Lacey Arthur Cole 1 episode 1984 Highway to Heaven Lance Gaylord Episode: \"Catch a Falling Star\" 1985 Remington Steele Pierre Fumar Episode: \"Gourmet Steele\" 1985 Scarecrow and Mrs. King Robert Castille and Tony Martinet Episodes: \"Vigilante Mothers\" and \"All the World's a Stage\" 1985 The A-Team Phillips 1 episode 1985 The Eagle and the Bear Underhill TV Movie 1986 George Washington II: The Forging of a Nation Patrick Henry TV Movie 1986 Matlock James Billings Episode: \"The Professor\" 1986 Cheers Mr. Reinhardt Episode: \"The Peterson Principle\" 1986 Tall Tales & Legends Congressman 1 episode 1987 Dynasty Harry Thresher Season 8 – 5 Episodes: \"The New Moguls\", \"The Spoiler\", \"Images\", \"The Rifle\", & \"The Scandal\" 1987 The Spirit Simon Teasdale TV Movie 1988 Frank's Place Arnold David Tuney 1 episode 1988 The Equalizer Eddie Mason 1 episode 1988 What Price Victory Trainer TV Movie 1988, 1993 Star Trek: The Next Generation Professor James Moriarty Episodes: \"Elementary, Dear Data\" and \"Ship in a Bottle\" 1989 MacGyver Mr. Helman / Nicholas Helman Episode: \"Halloween Knights\" 1991 Palomino Doctor TV Movie 1991 She Stood Alone Parker Elsworth TV Movie 1991 The Perfect Tribute Gov.
