        "text": "JEFFREY BROWN:\n\nJunot Diaz's world is a vibrant mix of cultures and languages. He spent his earliest years in the Dominican Republic, came to New Jersey with his family at age 6, speaking no English, but fell in love with books at the library, and eventually graduated as an English major from Rutgers University.\n\nHis book of short stories, \"Drown,\" won him literary acclaim in 1996. His first novel, \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,\" was 11 years in the making and has just won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.\n\nSet in an urban immigrant community, the book follows an unlikely Dominican-American hero and several generations of his family, from the horror of the Trujillo dictatorship in the Dominican Republic to life in the U.S. today.\n\nNow 39, Diaz teaches creative writing at MIT, but still lives in New York.\n\nAt one of his favorite haunts, a Manhattan bar called Camaradas, we talked about the raucous mix of cultures he grew up with.\n\nJUNOT DIAZ:\n\nEverything, every race. I mean, the joke of the Caribbean is that, if it can float, it will wash up eventually on our shores.\n\nAnd then you grow up in New Jersey, which is another kind of — in some way, another kind of nexus of cultures near New York City.\n\nSo I always felt that, in my life, what I knew more was the sort of the mixtures, sort of the hustle of many cultures, rather than like the myth of one unified culture. I never saw that, never saw that.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN:\n\nYes, and like he's really nerd major. I mean, it's the kind of guy who can't but talk in \"Star Trek\" languages. If someone is going to speak Klingon in a room, it's going to be poor Oscar, you know?\n\nI feel bad, but that is really who he is as a character. And it was part of the fun writing someone not only so extreme, but in some ways so unique.\n\nJUNOT DIAZ:\n\nThe universal springs from the particular. I mean, I always say it, but you can't get around it.\n\nIt's like you look at book like \"Moby Dick,\" a book that we considered a foundational text in American letters, and that book is so incredibly particular that it's almost astonishing. I mean, it's about whaling. And that's the great American text?\n\nWell, because it's the particularity of it, the specificity of it, is in some ways what lends its power. So, yes, I mean, I wanted to write a book that was, of course, in some ways accessible, about families, about a nerd kid wanting to get a girl. It's about maybe or maybe not a curse.\n\nBut I also knew that, by not eliminating the weird particularities of this Dominican family in central New Jersey, with a kid who loves \"Dungeons and Dragons\" and loves Jack Kirby comic books, that was the way into the universal soul.\n\nJUNOT DIAZ:\n\nYes, I mean, if you think about it, a curse is just a story that you may or not inherit. I mean, you can believe your family is cursed or you can say it's not, but it's literally just a story that comes in the family the way, you know, certain characteristics and certain traits.\n\nAnd I was really fascinated by that idea, that like, you know, this is a book about this idea that you can wake up, you can be born inheriting a story that you had nothing to do with, in some ways, and, even more crazy, you have no interest in it.\n\nJUNOT DIAZ:\n\nYes, I arrived at 6 years old. My family didn't tell me why we came. In those times, adults were just like one morning, they woke you up, and they're like, \"We're going to the United States.\"\n\nAnd there wasn't even the attempt at a cliche narrative, like, \"We're leaving because of jobs,\" or, \"Because we want freedom.\" Our parents didn't tell us anything.\n\nI think part of my desire and my love of books wasn't just this kind of random encounter with them. It was an attempt for a kid who, in some ways, miraculously teleported out of one world and appeared in another that's so radically different.\n\nIt was an attempt of me to understand where I came from, where I was, how I got there. I mean, they were maps; they were just maps. And I needed them, man, because it's real confusing, though, to jump from the third world to the first world in the '70s, especially from Santo Domingo to New Jersey.\n\nJUNOT DIAZ:\n\nI mean, for me, it's a tremendous honor. I mean, who would have ever imagined? I certainly wouldn't have imagined. That wasn't the way I dreamed that something like this could happen. I just wanted to finish this darn book.\n\nAnd there's something really cool about, you know, a Dominican kid, a writer of color, a writer of African descent, immigrant kid from a nowhere place in New Jersey, spent 11 years writing a book, and anybody who wanted to read it, and that anybody wanted to give it an award, it's — I'm like, a, that's great personally, but it's also kind of hopeful for other people.\n\nI mean, there's a lot of young writers and artists of color and a lot of young writers, period, from the sort of backgrounds that people don't expect much from. And I'm like, \"Let me tell you something: If I can do this, they certainly can do it.\""
