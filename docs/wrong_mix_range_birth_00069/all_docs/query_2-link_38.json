        "text": "Melissa Milton\n\nMelissa Milton was born in the Southern United States during the turbulent 1960’s and came of age in the groovy 1970’s. The colorful clothing, interior décor, and art of those decades influences her artistic expression. She has had her art published in British Vogue, British GQ, Studio Visit, and American Mensa magazines. Her abstract and sea life art have graced the lobby of the Rogers, Arkansas Aloft Hotel in 2019-2021. Melissa has won two art awards since she began painting in 2017 (2018 Rare Artist Award and 2021 1st Place Award in Mixed Media, Courage Kenny Art of Possibilities show in Minneapolis). Melissa creates prints of her artwork in her Fayetteville, Arkansas art studio.
