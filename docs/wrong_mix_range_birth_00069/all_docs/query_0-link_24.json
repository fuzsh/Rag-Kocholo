The great majority of people being aware of this, rank themselves naturally on the side of that splendid system that elevates them to the dignity of machines, and rage so wildly against the intrusion of the intellectual faculty into any question that concerns life, that one is tempted to define man as a rational animal who always loses his temper when he is called upon to act in accordance with the dictates of reason.\n\nOscar Wilde (1854-1900) Irish poet, wit, dramatist\n\n“The Critic as Artist,” Intentions (1891)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Wilde, Oscar\n\nAn idea that is not dangerous is unworthy of being called an idea at all.\n\nOscar Wilde (1854-1900) Irish poet, wit, dramatist\n\n“The Critic as Artist,” Part 2 [Gilbert], Intentions (1891)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Wilde, Oscar\n\nIt is so easy to convert others.

The poor can think of nothing else.\n\nOscar Wilde (1854-1900) Irish poet, wit, dramatist\n\n“The Soul of Man Under Socialism,” Fortnightly Review (Feb 1891)\n\nMore quotes by Wilde, Oscar\n\nWhat is said by great employers of labor against agitators is unquestionably true. Agitators are a set of interfering, meddling people, who come down to some perfectly contented class of the community and sow the seeds of discontent amongst them. That is the reason why agitators are so absolutely necessary. Without them, in our incomplete state, there would be no advance towards civilization.\n\nOscar Wilde (1854-1900) Irish poet, wit, dramatist\n\n“The Soul of Man Under Socialism” (1891)\n\n(Source)\n\nMore quotes by Wilde, Oscar\n\nThe basis of optimism is sheer terror.\n\nOscar Wilde (1854-1900) Irish poet, wit, dramatist\n\n(Attributed)\n\nMore quotes by Wilde, Oscar\n\nSimple pleasures are the last refuge of the complex.\n\nOscar Wilde (1854-1900) Irish poet, wit, dramatist\n\n(Attributed)\n\nAfter Johnson.\n\nMore quotes by Wilde, Oscar\n\nSeriousness is the only refuge of the shallow.\n\nOscar Wilde (1854-1900) Irish poet, wit, dramatist\n\n(Attributed)\n\nMore quotes by Wilde, Oscar\n\nNo great artist ever sees things as they really are.
