        "text": "Wilde's complete adherence to aestheticism led him to write beautifully but maybe without any stress on the significance of morality. His only novel The Picture of Dorian Gray reveals his philosophy of aestheticism in both art and life. The standpoint of 'beauty' dominates the novel in a way that almost all of its possible themes are shadowed or directed through the strict filter of aestheticism. However, it seems that this is only a half-truth, as moral and social issues are also revealed with a fastidious precision. Dorian Gray is constantly troubled by the ghosts of conscience, aging, and alienation, and these ordeals force him into the dark dungeon of paranoia. Hence, the common knowledge concerning Wilde's art is a matter of debate, and this scrutiny essays to lay stress on the assumption that this novel is not solely an aesthetic work but a combination of aestheticism and realism. To accomplish this, the present study aims to delve into the inordinate fear and vulnerability of Dorian Gray's character, which is dominantly ruled by the fading beauty of his soul. The paper will put the novel under the scrutiny of the psychological trauma of narcissism to conclude how social alienation brings about Dorian Gray's mental breakdown.\n\nThis thesis aims to show how the conflict between art and morality is portrayed in Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray. It will explore this conflict in general terms, how it is rooted in the values of Victorian society, and how artists of the time reacted to it. In what way the different moral and artistic views of Wilde’s mentors, John Ruskin and Walter Pater, influenced his views, and how his aesthetic principles represented in his critical essays are portrayed in his single novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Finally, this thesis will introduce the literary reception of the moral issues of Oscar Wilde’s writings.\n\nThis research paper is a study of the aesthetic use of symbols in Oscar Wilde’s only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891) which was published in Lippincott’s Monthly Magazine in 1890. The aim of this paper is not to cover all the symbols in the book, but to offer an explanation of the most significant symbols in the work which add depth and beauty to the text, hoping that this study will help the readers to achieve some aesthetic insight into the text of the novel. The novel’s focus on sensual love and physical pleasure that undercuts Victorian aesthetics and values of order and rationality brought much criticism and heated arguments on both the book and its rebellious author. The paper begins with an introduction that highlights the social values and the aesthetic concept of the Victorian people. But contrary to their expectations, Wilde used extraordinary ideas and symbols to undermine the Victorian code of values. This conflict led to the discussion of the themes of mo...\n\nMuch scholarship on The Picture of Dorian Gray has focused on its possible textual sources and its place in literary traditions. This article demonstrates that by contextualizing the novel in the history of art and the tradition of British portraiture, we are able to answer significant yet overlooked questions such as why Wilde chose “picture” rather than “portrait” for his title and are better prepared to appreciate the serious themes underlying the fantastical tale. The magical portrait of Dorian is most readily identifiable as a literary gothic motif, yet, in developing his central plot device, Wilde also draws on metaphysical and mystical theories of portraiture current in the British tradition and from throughout the history of art. These, in turn, are rooted in wide-ranging superstitions and other cultural attitudes toward imagery that have proven both influential and enduring. The philosophical symbolism of Wilde’s portrait contributes to a narrative of metaphysical inheritance and an allegory of arrested development through which Wilde is also able to test certain aesthetic doctrines which, however cherished, are seen to fail in Dorian’s case."
