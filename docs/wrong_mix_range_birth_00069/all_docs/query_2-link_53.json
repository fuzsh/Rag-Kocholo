        "text": "BAST has always been a proper good outcast of the street art world, and we mean that lovingly. He is so essential to the aesthetic, but has always been his own singular artist. His collaborations, with either Faile or Paul Insect, have this playful nostalgic feel, and his own works used to have a pop-culture critique that was some of the best in the business.\n\nWe are excited to see the Brooklyn artist's newest works, on view through November 10 at Allouche Gallery in NYC. Melmoth Confetti sees Bast influenced by Oscar Wilde's favored alias, Sebastian Melmoth. As the gallery notes, \"The paintings are the confetti-bright, colorful and celebratory. They exemplify Bast's seminal style of blending abstraction and figuration.\""
