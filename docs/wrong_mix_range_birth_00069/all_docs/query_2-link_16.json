This document is an introduction to a collection of interviews with Oscar Wilde from his tour of America in 1882. It provides context for the interviews, noting that Wilde gave many interviews to American reporters during the tour, which helped introduce American audiences to him. The introduction acknowledges that previous scholarship on Wilde's American interviews has been incomplete and inaccurate. The compiled volume aims to repair this by providing reliable and annotated transcripts of 48 interviews from Wilde's tour, selected from a total of 98 known interviews. It also includes an appendix with Wilde's later lecture on his impressions of America.",
