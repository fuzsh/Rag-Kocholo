        "text": "Oscar Wilde - Attempt to Make a Fair Memory The sketch of the script – Svetozar Jovičin CHARACTERS: Oscar Wilde, in contrast to time, carried the power of the sword through the articulation of the voice and with the assessment of society the measure of scales that, with the reflection and judgment, turned against him.

When entering the hall, the audience sits down and puts roses at the ends of the rows into vases. And The First Scene On the scene, Percival is in his silk veil (yellow and orange) while the art of the school of Pre- Raphaelite is shown on the canvas. He stands up and passes in front of the canvas in a mild footstep and starts the dialogue with the pictures. For example,  In the mid-19th century, imagination from the wooden Celtic world, through some William Morris, DaŶte Gaďriel ‘osetti aŶd Edǁard BurŶs JoŶess frieŶds, fell into English art. Among the paintings on the canvas are Loǀe and Death with a large figure of Death and Love as a boy.
