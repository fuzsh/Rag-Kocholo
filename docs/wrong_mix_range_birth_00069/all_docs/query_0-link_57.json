Ring of Fire: The Music of Johnny Cash follows the full story of Cash’s life: his early days in the cotton fields of Arkansas, the launch of his musical career in Memphis, his marriage to his beloved June Carter, and all of the soul-stirring music he created along the way. Listen to unforgettable renditions of famous songs such as “I Walk the Line,” “Folsom Prison Blues,” “I’ve Been Everywhere” and more, delivered by actor-musicians in a toe-tapping, soul-stirring musical biography you don’t want to miss.\n\nTHE WIZARD OF OZ\n\nWritten by L. Frank Baum Music and Lyrics by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg\n\nMay 26th to August 18th on Gilliam Stage\n\nFollow the yellow brick road for a timeless story beloved by millions, brought to life with a fresh new design that will take your breath away.

There’s no place like Barter to see America’s favorite musical, The Wizard of Oz!\n\nTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION\n\nAdapted for the stage by Owen O’Neill & Dave Johns from the novella by Stephen King\n\nJune 15th to August 17th on Gilliam Stage\n\nWhen Andy Dufresne is convicted of murder and sentenced to life in Shawshank prison, he must use his wits and newly forged friendships to keep himself and his hope alive.

Based on the novella by Stephen King and popularized by the highly acclaimed movie, The Shawshank Redemption is a story of resilience and a theatrical experience like no other.\n\nCRY IT OUT\n\nWritten by Molly Smith Metzler\n\nJune 21st to August 17th at Barter’s Smith Theatre\n\nFour months ago, Jessie was a corporate lawyer with a glamorous Manhattan life. Today she finds herself in a sleepy Long Island suburb, wearing dirty yoga pants, covered in breast milk, and trying to comfort a screaming newborn while befriending other new moms in her neighborhood. Cry It Out takes a comedic and honest look at the absurdities of being home with a baby, the power of female friendship, the dilemma of going back to work, and the effect class has on parenthood in America. “It’s the smartest look at what it really means to be a woman you’ll ever see onstage.”\n\nTHE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL\n\nWritten by Horton Foote\n\nSeptember 20th to November 2nd at Barter’s Smith Theatre\n\nIn The Trip to Bountiful, elderly Carrie Watts dreams of escaping her cramped apartment in Houston and returning to simpler times in her beloved hometown of Bountiful, Texas.

Throughout her trip she encounters unexpected instances of kindness and compassion, and makes a remarkable discovery about the true meaning of home along the way."
