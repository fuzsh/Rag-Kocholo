        "text": "Whitman’s poetry sounds exactly like Emerson’s prose—has anyone ever noticed that? “The Poet” by Emerson expresses Whitman’s philosophy. The essay “English Traits” by Emerson is deeply racist. As for Whitman’s little poem, “To A Certain Civilian,” it is arrogant in the extreme. No, I understand you, Walter. And very well. The avant-garde gesture can only be made once, like putting a toilet in a museum; it’s exciting when it’s first done, but after that it quickly becomes intellectually inhibiting and didactically boring. It is thrilling to see Whitman “step out” of the “poem” and speak in a sour manner to the reader.\n\nTO A CERTAIN CIVILIAN\n\nDID YOU ask dulcet rhymes from me?\n\nDid you find what I sang erewhile so hard to follow,\n\nto understand?\n\nWhy I was not singing erewhile for you to follow, to\n\nunderstand—nor am I now;\n\n—What to such as you, anyhow, such a poet as I?\n\n—therefore leave my works,\n\nAnd go lull yourself with what you can understand;\n\nFor I lull nobody—and you will never understand me.\n\nActually, Dante had already done this. In the Vita Nuova, (wonderful book!) Dante orders his poem to to go to his lady and speaks in prose about his experiences and the poems he is about to write of these experiences, so that his thoughts are, and are not, his poems, in a kind of hyper-simple, hyper-mysterious, writing-workshop. English took a long time to catch up to Dante. Poe, a modernized Dante, compartmentalized into Criticism, Verse, Prose, was Emerson’s and Whitman’s target. (Emerson’s “The Poet” attacks Poe, unnamed.) The All-Encompassing Genius vs. Avant-garde Hacks. Emerson and Whitman represent the pseudo-liberal position, always divisive, incomplete, and rather bullying. Poe, the well-rounded genius of dulcet rhymes and remarkable innovation and reach, hounded by America’s literary elites, is, through Scarriet, having the last laugh.\n\nWhy do people take Pound so seriously? I understand he’s a religion—all those poets who made pilgrimages to St. Elizabeth’s. Talk (fame) garners fame, etc. But he began as an Imagiste (ripping off haiku). He was extremely pro-war his entire career. He didn’t know any languages; he “translated” from other’s English translations. People know that, right? He didn’t invent translation, for God’s sake. His criticism, “How To Read,” etc is nonsensical, blowhard, dreck. His attempt to write school textbooks in middle age bombed. His Cantos is 99% footnote-dreck, private ravings. Because he became a religion, he’s merely a ready-made excuse for the elevation of pseudo profound bad poetry. Never mind he fought for the Axis, he was just a madman/creep, living off of women, and he didn’t “make” anyone. Eliot, the genius of “Prufrock,” declined after he became associated with Pound. Let’s cut all this Pound crap, can we?\n\nPound influenced no one. He was a social butterfly. His chief income was money from dad. His influence was social, not literary, and even in this sphere he was a loser. When his ex-girlfriend H.D. was married to Richard Aldington, Pound would show up unannounced, to discuss poetry with her—she subsequently moved to another part of London, to escape him. It helped his reputation that he knew Yeats, but Yeats, like Eliot, like Joyce, were fully formed as artists; Pound was merely a secretary/manager of their affairs, a valet, essentially. When the creepy Yeats tried to marry Maude Gonne’s daughter (she was twenty-one, he was fifty-two) just to upset the mother, whom he had wooed unsuccessfully, Yeats turned around and married another woman in her early 20s, Georgie, who Yeats ended up calling George a year later as the marriage failed. Pound was the one witness to the wedding. Pound was “useful.” Poor Eliot had great promise, but 12 years elapsed between “Prufrock” and “The Waste Land,” and in his late 30s into his 40s, in what should have been his middle-aged peak, Eliot fled from his wife and condemned Shelley and the Jews; during this period Pound wrote harsh, empty, bombastic, criticism; embraced Hitler. Pound ends up in a cage after a sequence of literary failures; Eliot remarries and helps to rescue fascist Pound. It’s all ridiculous. Modernism a low, seedy, joke, its best moments in “Prufrock” and the 19th century French poets who influenced Eliot. Even Eliot’s criticism is over-rated; derivative; at times outlandish; but he secretly stole from some good authors: Dante, Arnold, Poe—Eliot later nastily trashed Poe when Eliot was sixty-two, reaching out in desperation for some hard-nosed Modernist relevance at that point, perhaps, as he and Pound were being held aloft as revolutionary greats by a new generation of idiots trying to “make it new.”\n\nI should add Pound didn’t “begin” with haiku rip-offs; Imagism was his H.D./second phase (producing a few ‘zines no one read); the first was a “stiff” antiquarian imitative phase, basically laughed at (same as WC Williams, who rhymed at first). Failing at traditional poetry, minimalism was a new trick, which only succeeded later for Williams and Pound when they were both picked up by the New Critic’s successful text book, Understanding Poetry—at that point, Williams and Pound were has-beens in their fifties.\n\nPeople will often show me Pound’s poetry (as if they can’t believe I’ve read him.) Oh God, I hate “In A Station At the Metro.” This wretched, failed, haiku literally tells the reader what the petals stand for. This may be the worst poem ever written.\n\nThe chief reason we are shamed into admiring Modernist poetry is the Moderns successfully condemned the “sentimental,” and somehow managed to make us think only 19th century poetry is sentimental.\n\nOscar Wilde (in the 19th century) condemned it as well: “A sentimentalist is simply one who wants to have the luxury of an emotion without paying for it.”\n\nI love Wilde but if I’m granted the luxury without paying for it, why not? This is not one of Wilde’s best epigrams.\n\nWe’ve all heard how sentimentality is abused. The terms “inauthenticity” and “mawkishness” are trotted out. Sentimentality isn’t genuine feeling, it is said. Or, it’s counterfeit feeling. It’s a demonstration, or “performance” of genuine sentiment. Ultimately, it’s just phony and untrustworthy. Etc\n\nBut don’t we get into trouble when we censor “performance” in what is essentially a dramatic art form? Or isn’t it equally untrustworthy to use the term “untrustworthy?” Socrates says all emotion is untrustworthy. Does that mean to avoid “sentimentality,” we are asking that poetry have no emotion whatsoever? Also, to “earn” the emotion—this implies length and work, when we all know wonderful poems convey emotion briefly and instantaneously. I may “trust” that James Wright loves ponies (“A Blessing”) or WC Williams loves cold plums, (“This Is Just To Say,”) but this certainly doesn’t help me understand why the Moderns consider Shelley and Poe “sentimental.” (I don’t.) The topic—let’s define more specifically the “mawkish”—may be somewhat counter-intuitive.\n\nI don’t care for Williams, but he was a clever guy. Zany/flowery vs. Utilitarian. Yes. We eat plums and only smell flowers so plums are more utilitarian than flowers. Therefore Williams made progress away from 19th century “flowery sentimentality” with his famous plums poem. (Which has been parodied endlessly—“this is just to say I used the last of the toilet paper…”) The dilemma is this. The sentimental doesn’t belong in the argument. It is a given that all poetry which moves us moves us in a sentimental manner—so the whole issue of sentimentality is a distraction/red herring. Eliot tried to think in terms of balance with his objective correlative. Eliot asked: How much emotion does this object deserve? And so with Eliot’s point in mind: If you’re emotional or sentimental about it or not, it really makes no difference—if your poem is about cold plums your poem is about cold plums and I’m not going to read it. Poe’s “A Dream Within A Dream” is highly sentimental—and would suffer as a poem if it mourned a small plum juice stain on the poet’s white shirt. Poe’s poem succeeds since it performs something which could very easily fail—but for unique (and simple) reasons, does not. But here’s the clever Modernist secret: Poems on plums cannot fail; the expectation is low. The modern poet has found a “way” not to “fail.” (The only problem is that all avant-garde tricks only work once. There can only be one Ashbery—a poet lauded because he cannot be understood. You try it today, and see how far you get.) And those “old” poems were all entirely “too sentimental.” Today’s poet—who learned from the Moderns—is sure of this.\n\nWhy is “experimental” poetry always bad? For this very reason. Avant-garde gestures—if they are truly avant-garde—work once, and once only. After the toilet is put into the museum, the toilet-in-the-museum joke is no longer funny and will never be funny, or interesting, again. Those who persist in whatever “experimentation” seems interesting at the moment are vanquished by this iron law. The idea for the poem is not the poem. This is why Poe wrote “The Philosophy of Composition” and “The Raven” and why they are both necessary to each other—and why the fact that they are necessary to each other offends those who are chronically and continually avant-garde. The avant-garde gesture (and this is why it only works once) is precisely where the “idea” of “putting a toilet in a museum” and “putting a toilet in a museum” are the same—there is no division in Modernism; it’s all experiment; it’s all idea—and that’s why there is so little art in it which is popular and lasts.\n\nWhen I say “idea” as it pertains to Modernism, I don’t mean coherent ideas, coherent thought. Every modern poet, almost without exception, says they love Pound’s work “in spite of his ideas.” Modernism never truly cared about ideas—only movements and moments. By “idea,” here, I mean, “wouldn’t it be a cool idea to put a toilet in a museum?”\n\nThe defenders of “experiment” accuse the “old” professors and Scarriet of being “nostalgic.” But nostalgia is a personal feeling, it has nothing to do with literary criticism.\n\nThe late Harold Bloom loathed Edgar Poe with a hatred bordering on mental illness. How’s that for “nostalgia?”\n\nLikewise, T.S. Eliot trembled with rage when discussing the literary accomplishments of Shelley.\n\nSalem, MA 7/16/2023\n\nThe late Harold Bloom, 25 years ago, was asked by David Lehman—who recently ‘liked’ one of my poems on FB—to compile a Best of the Best American Poetry 1988 — 1997 and Bloom complied, but his compilation completely omitted the 1996 Best American Poetry volume by the late lesbian poet, Adrienne Rich. Bloom wrote a scathing introduction saying political correctness was ruining poetry and destroying universities.\n\nBloom’s 10 year BAP anniversary anthology considered 10 volumes by these 10 guest editors: John Ashbery, Donald Hall, Jorie Graham, Mark Strand, Charles Simic, Louise Glűck, A. R. Ammons, Richard Howard, Adrienne Rich, and James Tate, 1988 to 1997.\n\nThere are several stories here.\n\nThe headline grabber, obviously: Bloom snubbed every choice by Adrienne Rich (she did find a few good poems: Marilyn Chin, Martin Espada)—Rich, a distinguished poet who was awarded the Yale Younger Poet prize by king-maker W.H. Auden.\n\nBloom could have included one or two poems and moved on, but the most famous literary critic of his day decided to make a statement. Series editor Lehman suggested what he thought were worthy poems from 1996, but succumbed to Bloom’s editorial fiat. Lehman has turned out to be a wise editor for BAP. He doesn’t encourage controversy, but he doesn’t run from it, either.\n\nAre you sitting down? Here is Bloom, from his introduction:\n\n“That 1996 anthology is one of the provocations for this introduction, since it seems to me a monumental representation of the enemies of the aesthetic who are in the act of overwhelming us. It is of a badness not to be believed, because it follows the criteria now operative: what matters most are the race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic origin, and political purpose of the would-be poet. I ardently wish that I were being hyperbolical, but in fact I am exercising restraint…”\n\n“Sincerity, as the divine Oscar Wilde assured us, is not nearly enough to generate a poem. Bursting with sincerity, the 1996 volume is a Stuffed Owl of bad verse, and of much badness that is neither verse nor prose.”\n\n“[Literary] Criticism…is dying…replaced…by ‘cultural criticism,’ a would-be social science.”\n\n“When I was a young teacher of poetry at Yale, the English Romantic poets were Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, and Keats, as well as Blake and Shelley, whose place in the canon I helped restore. On hundreds of campuses now, these poets have to share attention with the ‘women Romantic poets.'”\n\nBloom doesn’t help himself here. Why can’t women poets (or poets of color, etc) be studied, too? Poems ought to matter as much as poets—there is no such thing as a small group of poets—even if it’s the magnificent Coleridge, Byron, Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, Blake—who wrote only perfect poems. Women writers sold as well as their male counterparts in the 19th century. If Shelley is being canceled, that’s one thing; to ostentatiously lock the clubhouse door—on some lesser known women poets (some of whom are worth reading)—seems a bit much.\n\n“I have seen my profession dying for over a quarter century now, and in another decade it may be dead.”\n\n“Walt Whitman was not only the strongest of our poets…but…the most betrayed…Whitman’s poetry does the opposite of what he proclaims its work to be: it is reclusive, evasive, hermetic, nuanced, and more onanistic even than homoerotic, which critics cannot accept, particularly these days when attempts are made to assimilate the Self-Reliant Whitman into what calls itself the Homosexual Poetic.”\n\n“Authentic American poetry is necessarily difficult; it is our elitist art, though that elite has nothing to do with social class, gender, erotic preference, ethnic strain, race, or sect. ‘We live in the mind,’ Stevens said, and our poetry is either Emersonian or anti-Emersonian, but either way is informed by Emerson’s dialect of power:”\n\nAnd here Bloom quotes a passage from Emerson’s “Experience” which takes no prisoners in its radical assertion that within the sanctity of the self, everything is allowed. Emerson: “We believe in ourselves, as we do not believe in others. We permit all things to ourselves, and that which we call sin in others, is experiment for us. It is an instance of our faith in ourselves, that men never speak of crime as lightly as they think: or, every man thinks a latitude safe for himself, which is nowise to be indulged to another. The act looks very differently on the inside, and on the outside; in its quality, and its consequences. Murder in the murderer is no such ruinous thought as poets and romancers will have it; it does not unsettle him, or fright him from his ordinary notice of trifles: it is an act quite easy to be contemplated…For there is no crime to the intellect.”\n\nWhoa. Mr. Emerson. Are you really saying this?\n\nBut let us be alive to what Emerson (and Bloom, who astutely rode to profit two or three important ideas) is saying here: 1) Human beings are wicked 2) Poetry’s highest calling is to energize itself by both using and getting to the bottom of, human wickedness. Poetry is best when it is an uncompromising vessel for every kind of expression, encouraging a divine individuality of which the “good” and the “fit” and the “beautiful” have no necessary part (though they may). This echoes Plato’s embrace of “madness” as ultimately necessary for creativity (and love).\n\nPoe thought Emerson, and broad, cultural, poetry formulas like this, crazy, recommending instead “method” in the hands of a calm practitioner—think of the “escape from personality” per Eliot. “Beauty” (non-violent madness) was necessary in poetry for Poe—“beauty” wasn’t just one arrow in the quiver; it was the arrow. Emerson, seen through the Poe lens, was hyperbolic and unrealistic, like an ugly guy trying to get laid, enforcing fantastic laws on the universe. One can see here the Poe/Emerson divide which was so important to Bloom (who also apparently thought of himself as an ugly guy trying to get laid). Bloom embraced Emerson-as-Faust—and had zero patience for Poe’s buzzkill.\n\nBloom couldn’t reconcile.\n\nBack to Bloom’s introduction:\n\n“Every attempt to socialize writing and reading fails; poetry is a solitary art, more now than ever, and its proper audience is the deeply educated, solitary reader…”\n\nThe “solitary art” for the “solitary reader” recalls what Bloom just said above: his “onanistic” (it means masturbation) description of Whitman.\n\nBloom prefers the poetry of the private and squishy, objecting to broader political amorousness. The Yale professor is quite certain that concern for the “injured” belongs to him. Is he right?\n\n“The Resenters prate of power, as they do of race and gender: these are careerist stratagems and have nothing to do with the insulted and injured, whose lives will not be improved by our reading the bad verses of those who assert that they are the oppressed.”\n\nBloom ends his introduction by quoting from “The Poet,” in which Emerson lauds “insanity,” “questionable facts,” “angels, devils, magic, astrology, palmistry, mesmerism, and…departure from routine.” According to Emerson, the best is when the poets, “liberating gods,” have it that “dream delivers us to dream, and, while the drunkenness lasts, we sell our bed, our philosophy, our religion, in our opulence.”\n\nThe radical individualist will have his private, drunken, transcendent dream. This is the essence of Bloom and Emerson (kind of like geniuses on LSD). Here, then, is their democratic, demonic, elitism of lonely difficulty, where the morals of political correctness declaimed by those like Adrienne Rich are cast out as too “sincere” (Wilde).\n\nBloom is correct. One cannot have the wayward freedom of the private dream and moralizing politics at the same time; they are too antithetical.\n\nBut, in the end, there’s nothing really politically intransigent or personally bitter about this quarrel. (As far as I can tell, Rich never responded to Bloom’s attack.) It’s an academic disagreement only, except Bloom’s academy isn’t some 19th century prison: Bloom protests too much; his and Emerson’s pleas for “drunkenness” are more than satisfied in the Humanities, today—which is no longer a Latin-and-Greek, theological, boot camp. Bloom’s political beliefs (leftist, liberal) mirror Rich and the “Resenters”—who, according to Bloom, hate real poetry.\n\nAdrienne Rich, in her introduction, lays out the method for her selections in the very first paragraph:\n\n“This is a gathering of poems that one guest editor, reading through mailboxesful of journals that publish poetry, found especially urgent, lively, haunting, resonant, demanding to be reread.” (Italics mine)\n\nWhat could be more bland? “mailboxesful of journals that publish poetry…” It sounds quaint. Especially next to this by Bloom, which is how his introduction begins, and which made Rich smile, I’m sure:\n\n“My epigraph [They have the numbers; we, the heights.] is from Thucydides and is spoken by the Spartan commander at Thermopylae. Culturally, we are at Thermopylae: the multi-culturalists, the hordes of camp-followers afflicted by the French diseases, the mock-feminists, the commisars, the gender-and-power freaks, the hosts of new historicists and old materialists—all stand below us. They will surge up and we may be overcome; our universities are already travesties, and our journalists parody our professors of “cultural studies.” For just a little longer, we hold the heights, the realm of the aesthetic.”\n\nWow. 25 years ago—this actually rang across the book marts and the halls of academe.\n\nBloom ends his first paragraph by defining his criterion for the 75 poems he chose (leaving out Rich’s selections):\n\n“These pass my personal test for the canonical: I have reread them with pleasure and profit.” (Italics mine)\n\nNeither Bloom nor Rich is an Einstein. This is not Baudelaire. Or Edgar Poe. Or T.S. Eliot. This BAP battle has one professor imagining himself as a Spartan commander against another professor who thinks L*A*N*G*U*A*G*E poems written by people of color would be an improvement for a Best American Poetry volume. (She writes “Language” with the stars. Do people still do that?)\n\nHere’s Rich, again, from her introduction:\n\n“We need poetry as living language, the core of every language, something that is still spoken, aloud or in the mind, muttered in secret, subversive, reaching around corners, crumpled into a pocket, performed to a community, read aloud to the dying, recited by heart, scratched or sprayed on a wall.”\n\nWhat say you, commander?\n\nRich and Bloom are both Emersonian—so no sparks flew, or could fly. Rich’s hip, “living language” pastiche is just Waldo sounding a little more like Paul Simon.\n\nStill, there is a gulf, and here it is:\n\nBloom wants to preside over the chaotic dream of poetry and be its psychiatrist/critic—the Resenters (they care about freedom, too) don’t want to give Bloom that power; he represents to them exactly what their politics-meddling-with-poetry represents to him; both sides are radicals who differ only where the limited authority should be placed; Bloom wants it placed in him—who will decide which difficult, radical-individual, dream is in fact a good poem; Rich wants authority situated in a set of politically enlightened principles under which poetry can aspire, but not compete.\n\nThe final consideration is: how are Bloom’s selections? In his introduction, Bloom names four “major” poets represented in his Best of 1988 to 1997 anthology: Elizabeth Bishop, Amy Clampitt, James Merrill, and May Swenson—who are no longer living, adding Ashbery and Ammons (then living) as worthy to be in their company.\n\nBut as Marjorie Perloff (she agreed with Bloom that Rich’s 1996 volume was aesthetically weak) pointed out (I paraphrase her) in her general response to Bloom in the Boston Review:\n\n1) In his introduction, Bloom did not bring himself to mention any other poets in his Best anthology, focusing instead on Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Stevens, Hart Crane, and especially Emerson. (Bloom loves to quote the dead—who invariably make his points far better than he does.)\n\n2) Bloom, like Rich, is mostly a culture critic, and therefore deserves blame for what he laments: the decline of hard-nosed, close-reading, aesthetics.\n\nTwo good points from Marjorie Perloff.\n\nBloom champions Ashbery—which would seem, at first blush, a little strange. Professor Bloom began his career defending Blake and Shelley; the traditional canon suits him, Bloom quotes Tennyson in his Best introduction as an example of beautiful poetry which transcends politics; Emerson, whom he adores, is always making easily understood (if sometimes snide and psychotic) points; and Shakespeare leads the Bloom parade—so what is it which attracts Bloom so much to this grinning, nonsensical, prose poetry, jokester, Ashbery? Isn’t Bloom afraid the Ashbery hipsters are laughing at him, and not with him?\n\nBloom was wise to include Ashbery in his canon.\n\nFirst, Ashbery is apolitical. Bloom had to like that.\n\nSecond, Bloom’s avant-garde creds rose enormously by embracing the Harvard poet, who was liked by W.H. Auden. With Ashbery on his side, Bloom, from a distance at least, looks less like a dour, old-fashioned, fuddy-duddy.\n\nThird, Ashbery is never guilty of the dreaded “sincerity”—in his poems, John Ashbery, the real person, is always hiding. If you hide who you are, well of course you can never be sincere. Ashbery learned this hide-John-Ashbery trick from the beginning and stuck to it—in a steady, unassuming manner, to the end of his career.\n\nFinally, Ashbery’s stream-of-conscious, meandering, prose, poetry, is rhapsodic rather than digressive. Especially in lengthier pieces, the line between rhapsodic (good) and digressive (bad) is very fine, indeed; to pull off the former takes a real, but difficult-to-define, skill.\n\nIf this is a legitimate poetic talent—I’ve put my finger on it precisely with these two opposite terms (rhapsodic, digressive) which nevertheless hint at being one—then here is where the whole modern poetry experiment (dubious everywhere else) succeeds: in the strange rhapsody of Ashbery.\n\nWe can see this quality clearly in one of Ashbery’s shorter poems, selected by Bloom:\n\nThe Problem Of Anxiety\n\nFifty years have passed\n\nsince I started living in those dark towns\n\nI was telling you about.\n\nWell, not much has changed. I still can’t figure out\n\nhow to get from the post office to the swings in the park.\n\nApple trees blossom in the cold, not from conviction,\n\nand my hair is the color of dandelion fuzz.\n\nSuppose this poem were about you—would you\n\nput in the things I’ve carefully left out:\n\ndescriptions of pain, and sex, and how shiftily\n\npeople behave toward each other? Naw, that’s,\n\nall in some book, it seems. For you\n\nI’ve saved the descriptions of finger sandwiches,\n\nand the glass eye that stares at me in amazement\n\nfrom the bronze mantel, and will never be appeased.\n\nThis might be the best poem in the whole volume, but I also love “litany” by Carolyn Creeden, “Histoire” by Harry Matthews, “Manifest Destiny” by Jorie Graham, “Prophecy” by Donald Hall, “Facing It” by Yusef Komunyakaa, “Morning, Noon, and Night” by Mark Strand, “One Train May Hide Another” by Kenneth Koch, and “When One Has Lived A Long Time Alone” by Galway Kinnell.\n\nThere is something to be said for the compilers art, for these extraordinary poems come from poets who also have published (never mind written) poems which are less than good.\n\nThe vanity of poets (who think all their poems are good) will get in the way of truly good poems, such that it may be said the honest anthologist is really the one person to whom poetry gives itself.\n\nOne “major” poet of Bloom’s, who to this author is overrated, is Ammons—his long poem included, “Garbage,” feels digressive, not rhapsodic. The reason? It’s sincere (Oscar Wilde—and Bloom agreeing with him—get this right).\n\nFrom “Garbage:”\n\n…(I hope) to live\n\nfrom now on on in elegance and simplicity—\n\nor, maybe, just simplicity—why shouldn’t I\n\nat my age (63) concentrate on chucking the\n\nadvancements and rehearsing the sweetnesses of\n\nleisure, nonchalance, and small-time byways: couple\n\nmonths ago, for example, I went all the way\n\nfrom soy flakes (already roasted and pressed)\n\nand in need of an hour’s simmering boil\n\nto be cooked) all the way to soybeans, the\n\npure golden pearls themselves, .65$ lb. dry: they\n\nhave to be soaked overnight in water and they\n\nhave to be boiled slowly for six hours—but\n\nthey’re welfare cheap, are a complete protein,\n\nmore protein by weight than meat, more”…\n\nThis is too sincere by half. Ammons is sharing. This is not rhapsodic. It’s digression.\n\nWhy Bloom could not tell the difference I am not really sure. But since Bloom was not a poet himself, and found no elegance except in quoting others—either the dead, or his colleague W. Jackson Bate, from whom he lifted his anxiety of influence theory—perhaps the Yale professor was finally an emotional, miserable, copying machine?\n\nIf we don’t separate out Ammons, we can’t see Ashbery clearly. The rhapsody of Ashbery and the digression of Ammons get confused. Aesthetics is blurry without the surgeon’s knife. Casual readers don’t get together and consult each other. Poems don’t talk. The Critic is necessary.\n\nIn a bit of irony, I am going to quote a definition of poetry from the 19th century, which answers to that rhapsody we sometimes get from Ashbery, a definition which Edgar Poe, of all people, said of it that this definition of poetry “embodies the sole true definition of what has been a thousand times erroneously defined.”\n\nHere is the definition. It happens to likewise come from an anthologist in a preface to a poetry anthology:\n\n“He who looks on Lake George, or sees the sun rise on Mackinaw, or listens to the grand music of a storm, is divested, certainly, for a time, of a portion of the alloy of his nature. The elements of power in all sublime sights and heavenly harmonies, should live in the poet’s song, to which they can be transferred only by him who possesses the creative faculty. The sense of beauty, next to the miraculous divine suasion, is the means through which the human character is purified and elevated. The creation of beauty, the manifestation of the real by the ideal, ‘in words that move in metrical array,’ is poetry.”\n\nThe author of this poetry definition is a man who called Whitman’s poetry “filth” and betrayed his friend, Edgar Poe.\n\nRufus Griswold.\n\nIf you don’t think the lyric Ashbery poem quoted above is sublime in the way Griswold describes, what do you think the “dark towns” are meant to invoke, or the unseen “you,” and what do you think the “eye” represents? As for “metrical array,” it is there, too: spondees pair up brilliantly with anapests in Ashbery’s sonnet-like work.\n\nWell this is nuts. Bloom and Griswold, (along with Emerson) will long be remembered as deeply hostile to Poe. But here is Bloom, with the help of Griswold (and Poe nodding in agreement) hoisting Ashbery high over Adrienne Rich, guest editor of BAP 1996—who did not include Ashbery, or Ammons in her selections. But what I have outlined is really no crazier than anything poetry has given us since America became a nation (one which Rich did not like), including Spartan commander Bloom (from the “heights”) glowering down at professor Rich, the “people’s” 1996 BAP guest editor.\n\nAre all the poems in the 1996 BAP, Rich, ed. inferior to those in the Best of BAP 1988-1997, Bloom, ed.? It would make things easier for critics if it were true. Suffice it to say there are poems Bloom chose from the first 10 volumes—he tended to choose longer poems (going for “difficulty,” I imagine)—which, like “Garbage” by Ammons, have their moments, but which ultimately strike me as pedantic, digressive and yawn-producing (though perhaps this merely indicates I’m not able to appreciate poetry on the “heights.”)\n\nI think it’s safe to say that poems (which are not book-length epics) should be good to us immediately—we shouldn’t need to read a poem on and on for a “story” to develop.\n\nAesthetics should hit us in the face, and then, and only then, can the story “develop” in a way that pleases us.\n\nOr, how about this? Arresting start, turn, great end: the sonnet.\n\nThere’s not much in the way of sonnet-like poems in these competing BAP volumes—except the Ashbery poem quoted (the “Naw” is the turn) from Bloom’s selection. “Like Most Revelations” by Richard Howard (16 lines) is admirable, but the turns are multiple and a little abstract. Richard Howard might be called Oscar Wilde-lite; he had some of the manner but not all of the wit of the great Wilde; unfortunately for 20th century poetry, there is not so much a difference—as the 20th century (great in the horrors of war, certainly) holds its own, but is mostly the 19th century—watered down.\n\nWouldn’t that be something if the “champion” in this instance were a traditional form poem—by John Ashbery? (Though the wise money is on Kinnell or Carolyn Creedon—stunning poems, really.)\n\nAdrienne Rich’s 1996 volume avoids what Rich explicitly doesn’t like: “the columnar, anecdotal, domestic poem, often with a three-stress line,” like the poem by W. S. Merwin, “Lament for the Makers” which Rich chose. Or Ammons, which she did not. Her selections, compared to Bloom’s, are shorter, edgier, conversational, graffiti-like, shape-y, too consciously attempting not to be digressive, perhaps.\n\nRich or Bloom? Academic brevity or academic length. It’s basically Emerson, either way.\n\nOscar Wilde: 4-0 with a shutout in last 4 starts to help the surging Goths.\n\nThe Rome Ceilings are still in first. But barely. After dominating the Emperor Division in the first two months of the season, their starters have forgotten how to win.\n\nThe Ceilings have lost 12 of their last 16.\n\nGiacomo Leopardi had the kind of day which gives even greatness pause; it was when the Rimini Broadcasters flew into Rome to face the Ceilings—a 31-17 club beginning an 8 game home stand. The visiting Leopardi tossed a one-hitter and hit a home run, and out-dueled John Milton, 1-0.\n\nApparently, this brilliant performance by Leopardi knocked the Ceilings into a spin.\n\nSince then, Milton has not won, John Dryden has not won and missed a start (Octavio Paz lost in his place), Ludovico Ariosto (who earlier won 6 straight) has not won, and Saint Augustine has not won.\n\nThe Ceilings have never been lower.\n\nGeneral manager Pope Julius II waved his hand when asked what was wrong.\n\n“Nothing.”\n\nManager Richelieu practically spat his response.\n\n“We’re good.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Paris Goths exploded, going 12-4, as the Ceilings went 4-12, and we now have a race in the Emperor Division.\n\nThe Ceilings were hoping to break things wide open—as they appeared almost invincible in the early part of the season. But all it takes is a stumble (you start to lose those 3-2 contests instead of winning them) and another team gets hot.\n\nThe Goths of Charles X have made their run at home, in Paris, a beautiful park near the Seine, including a series against the Broadcasters in which Leopardi pitched well again, blanking the Goths for 8 2/3 innings—but Johann Wolfgang von Goethe answered with 9 shutout innings of his own, and Sophocles’ walk-off grand slam off George Orwell, the Broadcasters’ new hope, in the bottom of the ninth gave the Goths a 4-0 victory. Arthur Schopenhauer, the Goths manager, chortled afterward, “Sophocles is the ultimate goth—even more than Goethe!”\n\nGeorge Orwell, burned by Sophocles, has returned to the bullpen for the eccentric and highly individual Broadcasters with starter Samuel Taylor Coleridge now healthy—and who appears to be throwing the ball harder than ever; a good sign. And Jacques Lacan, replacing a struggling Ben Jonson in the rotation, has given the Broadcasters a lift (3-0, 2.80 ERA)—who have gained on the Ceilings, too, though their record is still under .500. A long, thrilling, grinding, road trip for the Broadcasters included two back-to-back, come-from-behind, wins in Rome for this slowly reviving team owned by Federico Fellini: Jim Morrison, Anne Sexton, and Charles Bukowski, got key hits, as Orwell beat J.S. Bach twice in nail-biting relief appearances, once in extra innings—to the horror of the Ceilings fans in Rome.\n\nThe Corsica Codes of Napoleon (Codes ace Homer going 3-0) the Madrid Crusaders, and the Broadcasters all gained on the Ceilings while playing .500 ball during the Ceilings current slump, but Philip of Spain’s Crusaders have to be the happiest—they gained in the standings playing a long road trip, and best of all, signed both Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludvig van Beethoven to their starting pitching rotation. Mozart is 2-1 and Beethoven is 2-0 in their first 4 starts. The Crusaders, playing on the road, lost Beethoven’s first 2 games, 9-5 and 4-2, despite Crusader home runs by Mary Angela Douglas and Joyce Kilmer, as Ludwig was throwing too hard and not hitting the corners. Mozart has not been dominating; composers always need to adjust in a poetry league. But the addition of Mozart and Beethoven changes things: the Emperor Division is really up for grabs.\n\n~~~\n\nCeilings 35 29 –\n\nGoths 34 30 (1)\n\nCodes 33 31 (2)\n\nCrusaders 32 32 (3)\n\nBroadcasters 30 34 (5)\n\n~~~\n\nAnd now a special treat. Scarriet Poetry Baseball caught up with Oscar Wilde and W.H. Auden in a hotel cafe, following Wilde’s 3-2 complete-game victory in Paris over the Codes, despite a two-run homer by Auden. At this writing, Auden has 20 home runs for Napoleon’s team, the most home runs in the Emperor Division, and is close to leading the entire league. Wilde has 6 wins for the Paris Goths, pitching beside Goethe, Chateaubriand, and Baudelaire.\n\nScarriet: Gentlemen…\n\nWilde: You flatter.\n\nScarriet: W.H. Auden…\n\nAuden: Now you flatter! Who’s he?\n\nWilde: (to Auden) You almost spoiled my win, silly.\n\nAuden: My home run?\n\nWilde: Yes, what were you trying to do? (laughing)\n\nAuden: I was distracted.\n\nWilde: By my pitch? (laughing)\n\nAuden: No, by an idea for a home run. (laughing)\n\nWilde: You devil! Where do you get these ideas? Not from me, I hope! (smiling)\n\nWilde and Auden pause, both looking at the interviewer.\n\nScarriet: (mind going blank) It’s a lovely day.\n\nWilde: To be outside.\n\nAuden: It’s always better to be somewhere else.\n\nWilde: Precisely. Let’s go inside.\n\nAuden: Is it too noisy here? I thought we were inside?\n\nWilde: (looking around at the space) It’s difficult to tell. Are we?\n\nAuden: We’re partially indoors. This large awning, and this carpet.\n\nWilde: A big cafe. So fancy, it’s hard to tell where we are. Who picked this place?\n\nAuden: At least we’re not directly on the street.\n\nWilde: But we can see the street…\n\nAuden: Thank God we can smoke here…\n\nWilde: I don’t know. What year is it?\n\nAuden: It always feels like a year between cigarettes for me…\n\nWilde: You measure time that way? By coughing?\n\nAuden: Yes, it’s my clock. Sixty coughs per hour.\n\nWilde: But you have the breath of ten men.\n\nAuden: My lungs are my best feature. I have handsome lungs.\n\nWilde: I can hear them. They’re lovely.\n\nAuden: A bit high-pitched.\n\nWilde: Low tones can hardly be heard. I like a good, stabbing, high-pitched, voice!\n\nAuden: (laughing, coughing) You’re making fun of me!\n\nWilde: Don’t lower your voice now! Don’t be suave, Wystan! Be yourself. Scream.\n\nAuden: (pealing, high-pitched laughter, interrupted by low, growling coughing)\n\nWilde: People are looking now! See what you’ve done, Wystan!\n\nAuden: (still choking) Me??\n\nScarriet: Can I ask—\n\nWilde: About the United States?\n\nAuden: (cough, cough) What about Ireland?\n\nWilde: Do you know what the United States was? Ireland’s revenge against England.\n\nAuden: And now? What about now, in 2020?\n\nWilde: China is England’s revenge—against the United States.\n\nAuden: People have soured on Christianity. The pendulum is swinging towards a different kind of control.\n\nWilde: Oh life is pleasant now. Let’s talk about baseball. This gentleman wants to know—\n\nScarriet: I would rather you two just talk. I’ll stay out the way…\n\nWilde: This is the worst interview ever! (smiling) Let us two gasbags go on? Is that a good idea?\n\nAuden: Perhaps we could set a few things straight. History gets everything wrong.\n\nWilde: (sighing) Wystan! Do you have to bring history in? I’m still trying to figure out my mistakes…\n\nAuden: They weren’t your mistakes. They were history’s mistakes.\n\nWilde: Yes, that’s what history is. But no, they were mine. They were my mistakes. (pause)\n\nScarriet: Can I borrow a cigarette…\n\nAuden: Oh, certainly, dear!\n\nWilde: Our interviewer is so charming!\n\nAuden: And he lets us say whatever we want! (laughing)\n\nWilde: He lets us do whatever we want! (laughing)\n\nAuden: We should retire to our rooms..\n\nWilde: I have no rooms.\n\nAuden: No rooms? Where are you?\n\nWilde: I don’t know. I don’t know.\n\n(Someone is speaking to Auden)\n\nAuden: Oh, we can’t smoke?\n\nCONNECTION LOST\n\n~~~\n\nScarriet Poetry Baseball.\n\nGeorge Byron in a pensive mood, before taking part in the opening day Scarriet baseball ceremonies.\n\nHappy Easter!\n\nScarriet has expanded and restructured its baseball league!!\n\nGone the 2 leagues of 20 teams led by 20 American poets—Eliot, Pound, Frost, Poe, Williams, Stevens, Moore, Dickinson, Millay, Jorie Graham, Ginsberg, Ransom, Cummings, Whittier, Whitman, Bryant, Longfellow, James Lowell, Ashbery, and Emerson.\n\nNow poets like Emerson, Eliot and Poe can be player/managers—to contribute to their teams both at the plate and in the field.\n\nThe field is more international—Scarriet Poetry Baseball is now 25 historical teams from all over the world.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe gods and muses must be pleased with our ten years of Poetry March Madness and our first Poetry Baseball season, where poetry is worshiped through time and space in a manner which no one has ever seen.\n\nFortunately one of the Muses has always been here to help us, Marla Muse.\n\nMarla Muse: They are indeed pleased, Tom!\n\nYou have spoken to the other muses who live in other realms, in those shadowy timeless realms where time is one and poetry lights up suns distantly—\n\nMarla Muse: Yes, and they approve! The stars in the heavens love you more than you know… I would rather die than see poetry die.\n\nThis baseball season is different. Mysterious and wealthy owners throughout time and space are bidding, some in secret, for players to fill their rosters.\n\nIn the Great Emperor League, we have the Broadcasters. Their motto is “Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name” and they feature Mick Jagger, Jim Morrison, Gregory Corso, Anne Sexton, Bobby Burns, Omar Khayyam, Rilke, Coleridge, Leopardi, Anacreon, Sappho, and Ingrid Jonker. They are rumored to be owned and funded by a business group led by Federico Fellini, and their ballpark is in Rimini, Italy.\n\nThese ballclubs are timeless, in every sense of the word (these teams compete, with actual statistics, where chance unfolds out of space, out of time) but real money, blood money, purchases these players. We know JP Morgan, for instance, wanted Shakespeare and bid heavily to get him.\n\nThe Pistols, who play in Berlin, are said to be associated with Eva Braun, but this cannot be confirmed; one older muse claims to have overheard Eva say, “I take care of this. Adolf is too busy talking to bankers and architects. He doesn’t have time for poetry.” But honestly we cannot say who owns the Pistols.\n\nNahum Tate, owner of the Laureates, for those who do not know, re-wrote a popular King Lear with a happy ending (after Shakespeare’s death when, for a long period, the Bard was out of fashion,) and was chosen as Poet Laureate of England in 1692.\n\nDick Wolf produces Law & Order on television, and appears to have a controlling interest in the Laws, playing out of Santa Barbara. He’s got Aristotle, Lord Bacon, and Horace.\n\nJohn Rockefeller opened his purse to get Walt Whitman, and he thinks that will be enough to win a championship. We don’t know. We do know baseball is all about pitching. All you need is a few good arms which dominate, defense behind them, and some clubhouse chemistry, and not too many injuries. It’s a crap shoot, in many ways, and this is why Rockefeller grumbled he wasn’t going to waste money on superstars who hit home runs and have a high batting average. He’s probably right. A team that wins 2-1 is better than a team that wins 7-4, by pure mathematics, even though the former score wins by 1 and the latter by 3 runs. It’s the ratio that counts. 2-1 = 2. 7-4 = 1.7 This simple reason is why defense wins in every sport. Rockefeller is using this formula, and the oil baron was also advised that you can’t buy a pennant—throwing money at sluggers doesn’t do any good; it’s 90% pitching and luck. Just put a a poet with critical depth on the hill and three good versifiers in the infield and sit back.\n\nSome of the rosters might have some question marks, but that’s what happens in a free market. It’s an historical fact that Longfellow did meet Queen Victoria in person. But no one expected him to play for her!\n\nAnd W.H. Auden just “wanted to play for Napoleon, I don’t why.”\n\nMarla Muse: I can’t wait for the season to begin! Spring is in the air! Around Rome, and in those still fairer isles… Let’s forget about plagues and the starvation for awhile. Songs are going to sing.\n\nHere then, are the Teams, their Mottoes, and the preliminary rosters—they are always changing (there’s a big minor leagues!)\n\n~~~~~~\n\nTHE GREAT EMPEROR LEAGUE\n\nFederico Fellini, Rimini The Broadcasters [Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name]\n\n-Mick Jagger, Sappho, Gregory Corso, Charles Bukowski, Paul Valery, Anne Sexton, Omar Khayyam, Robert Burns, Ben Jonson, Coleridge, Jim Morrison, Edmund Waller, Nabokov, Rilke, Giacomo Leopardi, Anacreon, Ingrid Jonker, Swinburne\n\nNapoleon, Corsica The Codes [Let the more loving one be me]\n\n-W.H.

Everyone is flying to Madness Island for these games. And Marla Muse has been quite the hostess.\n\nMarla Muse: I love the Romantic poets!\n\nIn Round One play, first seed artist/poet William Blake (the Tyger), who died in the first quarter of the 19th century, takes on 16th seeded author and wit Oscar Wilde, who died at the 19th century’s close.\n\nBlake’s Tyger should terrify any opponent; Blake’s music is like a hammer, like Beethoven, or like heavy metal—what simplicity, what power: “Tyger, Tyger, burning bright in the forest of the night.” One has no problem imagining Black Sabbath or Led Zeppelin singing this.\n\nWilde’s essay “The Critic As Artist” is like the music of Ravel:\n\nWe are sometimes apt to think that the voices that sounded at the dawn of poetry were simpler, fresher, and more natural than ours, and that the world which the early poets looked at, and through which they walked, had a kind of poetical quality of its own, and almost without changing could pass into song. The snow lies thick now upon Olympus, and its steep, scraped sides are bleak and barren, but once, we fancy, the white feet of the Muses brushed the dew from the anemones in the morning, and at evening came Apollo to sing to the shepherds in the vale. But in this we are merely lending to other ages what we desire, or think we desire, for our own. Our historical sense is at fault. Every century that produces poetry is, so far, an artificial century, and the work that seems to us to be the most natural and simple product of its time is always the result of the most self-conscious effort. There is no fine art without self-consciousness, and self-consciousness and the critical spirit are one.\n\nInteresting contest, because Wilde insists on the “self-consciousness” of the “critic/artist” in the face of Blake, perhaps the most impetuous, and least self-conscious, artist who ever lived.\n\nBlake romps, to the blood-curdling yells of his fans, and advances to Round Two. So long, Oscar! You are right. The artist needs the self-consciousness of the critic. The bullied child is full of knowledge.\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\nGoethe’s poetic drama, Faust v. Emily Dickinson’s “Because I Could Not Stop for Death,” a poem as iconic as Blake’s Tyger.\n\nWe kept the devil away for two millennia, thanks to the Christian religion—whether the “devil” really exists, or not. Life is merely the play of our imagination—so say the non-religious; so why then, do they object to Christianity so much? If Christianity is real, or it’s poetry, it’s still pretty good poetry. In this passage from Goethe, Faust, the professor, woos a Christian peasant:\n\nGretchen: You don’t believe in God?\n\nFaust: Do not misunderstand me, my love, my queen!\n\nWho can name him?\n\nAdmit on the spot:\n\nI believe in him?\n\nAnd who can dare\n\nTo perceive and declare:\n\nI believe in him not?\n\nThe All-Embracing One,\n\nThe All-Upholding One,\n\nDoes he not embrace, uphold,\n\nYou, me, Himself?\n\nDoes not the Heaven vault itself above us?\n\nIs not the earth established fast below?\n\nAnd with their friendly glances do not\n\nEternal stars rise over us?\n\nDo not my eyes look into yours,\n\nAnd all things thrust\n\nInto your head, into your heart,\n\nAnd weave in everlasting mystery\n\nInvisibly, visibly, around you?\n\nFill your heart with this, great as it is,\n\nAnd when this feeling grants you perfect bliss,\n\nThen call it what you will—\n\nHappiness! Heart! Love! God!\n\nI have no name for it!\n\nFeeling is all;\n\nName is mere sound and reek\n\nClouding Heaven’s light.\n\nGretchen: That sounds quite good and right;\n\nAnd much as the priest might speak,\n\nOnly not word for word.\n\nFaust: It is what all hearts have heard\n\nIn all the places heavenly day can reach,\n\nEach in his own speech;\n\nWhy not I in mine?\n\nGretchen: I could almost accept it, you make it sound so fine,\n\nStill there is something in it that shouldn’t be;\n\nFor you have no Christianity.\n\nFaust: Dear child!\n\nGretchen: It has long been a grief to me\n\nTo see you in such company.\n\nFaust: You mean?\n\nGretchen: The man who goes about with you.\n\nI hate him in my soul, through and through.\n\nAnd nothing has given my heart\n\nIn my whole life so keen a smart\n\nAs that man’s face, so dire, so grim.\n\nFaust: Beloved child, don’t be afraid of him!\n\n“Feeling is all,” says professor Faust, wooing by expanding Christian love to include sex. A great speech, Gretchen acknowledges, though not quite true to the words of my religion. This “not quite” is finally the only “not quite” there is. Faust says religion is whatever good thing our hearts hear, but Gretchen’s Christian heart won’t be melted by that, and then she mentions Mephistopheles, and again, without learning, she instinctively understands, in the most innocent simplicity, that something is not right. First she rejects the idea of “what Faust’s individual heart thinks” and then she rejects “how the devil’s individual face looks.” For Gretchen, a standard judges the individual. Faust comes from the opposite direction—the individual is supreme. Gretchen eventually is seduced—because she is an individual.\n\nEveryone knows Emily Dickinson’s great poem. But here it is no match for the mesmerizing Faust!\n\nGoethe advances!\n\n~~~~~~~\n\nColeridge’s Kubla Khan versus Karl Marx’s Das Kapital. Third seed, fourteenth seed.\n\nWhy do we include Marx in a sublime contest with poets?\n\nBecause this idea shook the world:\n\n“There is a physical relation between physical things. But it is different with commodities.”\n\nThere. It is that simple. With one blow, Marx broke everything in two. A ghost inhabited every object.\n\nTrade, or capitalism, existed long before Marx—the word “commodity” came into use in English in the 15th century.\n\nA country has excess grain and trades it for coffee, and now it has grain and coffee, two things instead of one.\n\nCommodity meant “convenience” or “advantage,” and it was a good thing as long as trade produced a greater variety for everyone.\n\nBut as trade became more sophisticated, commodity pricing—trade for the sake of trade—replaced things themselves.\n\nCommodities were still things, up until Marx. As trade became weaponized, a commodity was now more valuable and sacred than a thing.\n\nAnd this happened just when mass wealth began to upset the old hierarchical order. A new hierarchy of hoarded wealth emerged, and Marx was the bitter result.\n\nWe say “bitter result,” because with bad faith trading, things were no longer what they were; everything was ephemeral and relative, and nothing was stable.\n\nThe sublime slid into the fast and the commonplace in a manner that was nearly sublime. Marx is nearly sublime, but not finally sublime. He fell into what he criticized.\n\nKubla Khan by Coleridge is sublime.\n\nIn Xanadu did Kubla Khan\n\nA stately pleasure-dome decree:\n\nWhere Alph, the sacred river, ran\n\nThrough caverns measureless to man\n\nDown to a sunless sea.\n\nColeridge advances.\n\n~~~~~\n\nShelley (the Cloud) v. Hawthorne (the Scarlet Letter)\n\nThe passage from Nathaniel Hawthorne is lovely and sublime:\n\nShe inherited her mother’s gift for devising drapery and costume. As the last touch to her mermaid’s garb, Pearl took some eel-grass, and imitated, as best she could, on her own bosom, the decoration with which she was so familiar on her mother’s. A letter,—the letter A,—but freshly green, instead of scarlet! The child bent her chin upon her breast, and contemplated this device with strange interest; even as if the one only thing for which she had been sent into the world was to make out its hidden import.\n\nNow here is the excerpt from Shelley’s “The Cloud:”\n\nI bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,\n\nFrom the seas and the streams;\n\nI bear light shade for the leaves when laid\n\nIn their noonday dreams.\n\nFrom my wings are shaken the dews that waken\n\nThe sweet buds every one,\n\nWhen rocked to rest on their mother’s breast,\n\nAs she dances about the sun.\n\nI wield the flail of the lashing hail,\n\nAnd whiten the green plains under,\n\nAnd then again I dissolve it in rain,\n\nAnd laugh as I pass in thunder.\n\nAnd since in Shelley’s divine poetry, he captures the roving and playful essence of Hawthorne’s Pearl, Shelley advances.\n\n~~~~~~~\n\nJohn Keats v. R.H. Horne\n\nThe Englishman Richard Henry Horne (1802-1884) fought for Mexican independence in the 1820s, was a literary friend of Elizabeth Barrett (before she became Browning) and Charles Dickens in the 1840s, called himself the “father of the Australian wine industry,” as he spent most of the 1850s in Australia, and spent the last 25 years of his life in London. He published plays, and an epic poem, “Orion,” which Edgar Poe praised in 1844. From “Orion:”\n\nThere, underneath the boughs, mark where the gleam\n\nOf sunrise through the roofing’s chasm is thrown\n\nUpon a grassy plot below, whereon\n\nThe shadow of a stag stoops to the stream,\n\nSwift rolling toward the cataract, and drinks,\n\nWhile ever and anon the nightingale,\n\nNot waiting for the evening, swells his hymn—\n\nHis one sustained and heaven aspiring tone—\n\nAnd when the sun hath vanished utterly,\n\nArm over arm the cedars spread their shade,\n\nWith arching wrist and long extended hands,\n\nAnd grave-ward fingers lengthening in the moon,\n\nAbove that shadowy stag whose antlers still\n\nHung o’er the stream.\n\nThe painting here is quite admirable, and there is a certain Miltonic force to Horne’s long poem—all but forgotten today.\n\nKeats, who lived less than a third of Horne’s long life, rose to remarkable fame, and Horne was one of the few, early on, to praise Keats.\n\nFrom Hyperion:\n\nDeep in the shady sadness of a vale\n\nFar sunken from the healthy breath of morn,\n\nFar from the fiery noon, and eve’s one star,\n\nSat gray-hair’d Saturn, quiet as a stone,\n\nStill as the silence round about his lair;\n\nForest on forest hung about his head\n\nLike cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,\n\nNot so much life as on a summer’s day\n\nRobs not one light seed from the feather’d grass,\n\nBut where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.\n\nHow interesting it would be, if Horne would win…\n\nHoly God! He does! R.H. Horne advances!\n\n~~~~~~~\n\nMarla Muse: Blake, Goethe, Coleridge, and Shelley—not much surprise that these advance. And R.H. Horne in an upset!\n\nHow many outside this tournament even know who Horne is, Marla?\n\nMarla Muse: I see quite a few fans studying their programs with puzzled looks!\n\nIs it not strange that Richard Horne wrote thousands of letters to Elizabeth Barrett, before Robert ran away with her? And Poe, who loved “Orion,” also corresponded with Elizabeth, when she was still Barrett, and that Poe dedicated his 1845 Poems to her?\n\nMarla Muse: O that is sweet! And speaking of which, look who is coming this way!\n\nElizabeth Barrett versus Pushkin!!\n\nBoth of these entries are stunning!\n\nFirst Elizabeth Barrett, from her epic poem, The Drama of Exile:\n\nOn a mountain peak\n\nHalf sheathed in primal woods and glittering\n\nIn spasms of awful sunshine, at that hour\n\nA lion crouched,—part raised upon his paws,\n\nWith his calm massive face turned full on thine,\n\nAnd his mane listening. When the ended curse\n\nLeft silence in the world, right suddenly\n\nHe sprang up rampant, and stood straight and stiff,\n\nAs if the new reality of death\n\nWere dashed against his eyes,—and roared so fierce,\n\n(Such thick carnivorous passion in his throat\n\nTearing a passage through the wrath and fear)—\n\nAnd roared so wild, and smote from all the hills\n\nSuch fast keen echoes crumbling down the vales\n\nTo distant silence,—that the forest beasts,\n\nOne after one, did mutter a response\n\nIn savage and in sorrowful complaint\n\nWhich trailed along the gorges.\n\nI don’t think many of our March Madness fans are acquainted with this side of Elizabeth Barrett!\n\n“Which trailed along the gorges.” What a vast, dramatic scene she paints!\n\nThis is masterful.\n\nAnd a lyric poem from Pushkin, who is so adept at breaking one’s heart:\n\nIf I walk the noisy streets,\n\nor enter a many thronged church,\n\nor sit among the wild young generation,\n\nI give way to my thoughts.\n\nI say to myself: the years are fleeting,\n\nand however many there seem to be,\n\nwe must all go under the eternal vault,\n\nand someone’s hour is already at hand.\n\nWhen I look at a solitary oak\n\nI think: the patriarch of the woods.\n\nIt will outlive my forgotten age\n\nas it outlived that of my grandfathers’.\n\nIf I caress a young child,\n\nimmediately I think: Farewell!\n\nI will yield my place to you,\n\nfor I must fade while your flower blooms.\n\nEach day, every hour\n\nI habitually follow in my thoughts,\n\ntrying to guess from their number\n\nthe year which brings my death.\n\nAnd where will fate send death to me?\n\nIn battle, in my travels, or on the seas?\n\nOr will the neighbouring valley\n\nreceive my chilled ashes?\n\nAnd although to the senseless body\n\nit is indifferent wherever it rots,\n\nyet close to my beloved countryside\n\nI still would prefer to rest.\n\nAnd let it be, beside the grave’s vault\n\nYoung life forever will be playing,\n\nand impartial, indifferent nature\n\nSpreads, forever staying.\n\nWhich is more sublime?\n\nPushkin, who puts his whole, melancholy life into one beautiful lyric poem?\n\nOr Barrett, who displays artistic unity in one sublime passage?\n\nElizabeth Barrett wins!\n\n~~~~~~\n\nAnd look who we have now!\n\nMarla Muse: I don’t think I can contain my excitement!\n\nByron versus Poe!!\n\nThis is one of the biggest crowds we’ve ever had for March Madness. Poe against Byron. The fans are merry, not melancholy, as the excitement lifts up even the most melancholy and literary of spirits.\n\nSometimes we swear the sublime is simply that which is terribly sad.\n\nIs there anything sadder than this excerpt from Byron’s poem, “Darkness?”\n\nThe rivers, lakes and ocean all stood still,\n\nAnd nothing stirr’d within their silent depths;\n\nShips sailorless lay rotting on the sea,\n\nAnd their masts fell down piecemeal: as they dropp’d\n\nThey slept on the abyss without a surge—\n\nThe waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,\n\nThe moon, their mistress, had expir’d before;\n\nThe winds were wither’d in the stagnant air,\n\nAnd the clouds perish’d; Darkness had no need\n\nOf aid from them—She was the Universe.\n\nThis is so beautiful: “as they dropp’d they slept on the abyss without a surge.” Listen to this, children! This is poetry. No mere fop, Byron.\n\nPoe counters with an ‘end of the world’ tale of his own; not everything Poe wrote became famous. The entry is a passage from Poe’s neglected “Conversation of Eiros and Charmion” (two spirits named after Cleopatra’s attendants) which imagines a comet approaching earth; people are terrified, then realize the comet is merely made of gas, and can do no harm. Halley’s comet (1835) would have been seen by Poe a few years prior to writing this tale, and, in 1832, there actually was a “comet panic” in which scientists miscalculated, and said a comet was going to hit the earth. Poe’s stories tend to be based on facts, or at least actual scary events.\n\nThe prevalence of oxygen in the comet has a pleasurable and life-giving effect at first, as it moves into our atmosphere. Then Poe brings the hammer down:\n\nIt had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twenty-one measures of oxygen, and seventy-nine of nitrogen, in every one hundred of the atmosphere. Oxygen, which was the principle of combustion, and the vehicle of heat, was absolutely necessary to the support of animal life, and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature. Nitrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal life or flame. An unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been ascertained, in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had latterly experienced. It was the pursuit, the extension of the idea, which had engendered awe. What would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen? A combustion irresistible, all-devouring, omni-prevalent, immediate; — the entire fulfillment, in all their minute and terrible details, of the fiery and horror-inspiring denunciations of the prophecies of the Holy Book.\n\nWhy need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of mankind? That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope, was now the source of the bitterness of despair. In its impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of Fate. Meantime a day again passed — bearing away with it the last shadow of Hope. We gasped in the rapid modification of the air. The red blood bounded tumultuously through its strict channels. A furious delirium possessed all men; and, with arms rigidly outstretched towards the threatening heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud. But the nucleus of the destroyer was now upon us; — even here in Aidenn, I shudder while I speak. Let me be brief — brief as the ruin that overwhelmed. For a moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and penetrating all things. Then — let us bow down, Charmion, before the excessive majesty of the great God! — then, there came a shouting and pervading sound, as if from the mouth itself of Him; while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we existed, burst at once into a species of intense flame, for whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat even the angels in the high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name. Thus ended all.\n\nWhich deserves to win? The sublime poetry of Byron? Or the hypnotizing prose of Poe?\n\nThe March Madness committee fears a riot—whoever wins, both sides loyal and passionate, as one might expect of those souls who gather beneath the banner, Byron, or the banner, Poe.\n\nBut the crowd is calmer than expected. Deadly quiet, even.\n\nAnd with a whisper comes the result: “The winner is the poet, Lord Byron!”\n\n~~~~~~~\n\nAnd the final First Round contest in the Romantic Bracket—Cornelius Matthews versus Lord Tennyson!!\n\nEveryone knows this by Tennyson. His sublime poem, The Splendor Falls, quoted in its entirety:\n\nThe splendor falls on castle walls\n\nAnd snowy summits old in story:\n\nThe long light shakes across the lakes,\n\nAnd the wild cataract leaps in glory.\n\nBlow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,\n\nBlow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.\n\n.\n\nO hark, O hear! how thin and clear,\n\nAnd thinner, clearer, farther going\n\nO sweet and far from cliff and scar\n\nThe horns of Elfland faintly blowng!\n\nBlow, let us hear the purple glens replying:\n\nBlow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.\n\n.\n\nO love, they die in yon rich sky,\n\nThey faint on hill or field or river:\n\nOur echoes roll from soul to soul,\n\nAnd grow for ever and for ever.\n\nBlow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,\n\nAnd answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.\n\nThis may be the most iconic poem ever.\n\nMarla Muse: It makes me want to faint!\n\nOh, Marla, people love to catch you when you fall!\n\nMarla Muse: I know! (laughter)\n\nCornelius Matthews wrote a 34 stanza poem called “Wakondah,” from which has been selected one beautiful line, selected once, for praise, by Poe, in a review in which he otherwise mocked the work.\n\nAnd then we find in a letter from Poe to Matthews—where Poe asks Matthews for R.H. Horne’s address—that Poe, in his review of “Wakondah,” was only kidding, and has since become terribly ashamed, and sorry.\n\nAh, Letters!\n\nThe line is:\n\nGreen dells that into silence stretch away\n\nMagnificent!\n\nIt will be amazing to see if a single line of sublimity can beat Tennyson.\n\nBut first we must attend to Marla Muse.\n\nShe has fainted.\n\nIn case you missed it, here’s the Classical lineup:\n\nHomer\n\nPlato\n\nAristotle\n\nSophocles\n\nOvid\n\nHorace\n\nVirgil\n\nDante\n\nPetrarch\n\nda Vinci\n\nShakespeare\n\nDonne\n\nMilton\n\nG.E. Lessing\n\nThomas Gray\n\nEdmund Burke\n\nImagine the colossal stadium for this event! The ringing of metal, the roaring of engines, the strenuous efforts of athletes down through the ages—how does it compare to this? The sublime utterances of the most sublime writers in recorded history? Striving to be the most sublime? Is this not sublime in itself—to contemplate this battle of the sublime?\n\nThese figures of world history do not ask for mere responses. This is not the attention-getting trash of the merely avant-garde. These ideas and feelings tower over you and demand you contemplate them, or die. The sublime obliterates the self, and leaves in its wake a new self, made of nobler things. This is not what you may know, but what you must know.\n\nWelcome to the March Madness Sublime Tournament!\n\nThe banners are golden and the gods are here to watch.\n\nThere has never been a red carpet like this.\n\nHomer, ravishment. Plato, ultimate beauty. Aristotle, art. Sophocles, fate. Ovid, wit. Horace, criticism. Virgil, drama. Dante, morals. Petrarch, faith. da Vinci, seeing, Shakespeare, enchantment. Donne, verse. Milton, poetry. Lessing, aesthetics, Gray, elegy. Burke, political psychology.\n\nTo predict who wins the Classical bracket, the experts suggest we ask “Considering what these titans represent, what does the world need most—what can we least do without?” da Vinci would say, ” We need to see! We need to know how to look!” Burke would caution, “if citizens are not taught how to think, and get along with each other, we are doomed.” And so forth.\n\nAnd now, here is the second bracket the March Madness Committee has selected for the Sublime 2020 March Madness:\n\nROMANTIC\n\n1) Blake (the tyger)\n\nTyger Tyger, burning bright,\n\nIn the forests of the night;\n\nWhat immortal hand or eye,\n\nCould frame thy fearful symmetry?\n\n.\n\nIn what distant deeps or skies.\n\nBurnt the fire of thine eyes?\n\nOn what wings dare he aspire?\n\nWhat the hand, dare seize the fire?\n\n.\n\nAnd what shoulder, & what art,\n\nCould twist the sinews of thy heart?\n\nAnd when thy heart began to beat,\n\nWhat dread hand? & what dread feet?\n\n.\n\nWhat the hammer? what the chain,\n\nIn what furnace was thy brain?\n\nWhat the anvil? what dread grasp,\n\nDare its deadly terrors clasp!\n\nWhen the stars threw down their spears\n\nAnd water’d heaven with their tears:\n\nDid he smile his work to see?\n\nDid he who made the Lamb make thee?\n\n.\n\nTyger Tyger burning bright,\n\nIn the forests of the night:\n\nWhat immortal hand or eye,\n\nDare frame thy fearful symmetry?\n\n2) Goethe (faust)\n\nGretchen: You don’t believe in God?\n\nFaust: Do not misunderstand me, my love, my queen!\n\nWho can name him?\n\nAdmit on the spot:\n\nI believe in him?\n\nAnd who can dare\n\nTo perceive and declare:\n\nI believe in him not?\n\nThe All-Embracing One,\n\nThe All-Upholding One,\n\nDoes he not embrace, uphold,\n\nYou, me, Himself?\n\nDoes not the Heaven vault itself above us?\n\nIs not the earth established fast below?\n\nAnd with their friendly glances do not\n\nEternal stars rise over us?\n\nDo not my eyes look into yours,\n\nAnd all things thrust\n\nInto your head, into your heart,\n\nAnd weave in everlasting mystery\n\nInvisibly, visibly, around you?\n\nFill your heart with this, great as it is,\n\nAnd when this feeling grants you perfect bliss,\n\nThen call it what you will—\n\nHappiness! Heart! Love! God!\n\nI have no name for it!\n\nFeeling is all;\n\nName is mere sound and reek\n\nClouding Heaven’s light.\n\nGretchen: That sounds quite good and right;\n\nAnd much as the priest might speak,\n\nOnly not word for word.\n\nFaust: It is what all hearts have heard\n\nIn all the places heavenly day can reach,\n\nEach in his own speech;\n\nWhy not I in mine?\n\nGretchen: I could almost accept it, you make it sound so fine,\n\nStill there is something in it that shouldn’t be;\n\nFor you have no Christianity.\n\nFaust: Dear child!\n\nGretchen: It has long been a grief to me\n\nTo see you in such company.\n\nFaust: You mean?\n\nGretchen: The man who goes about with you.\n\nI hate him in my soul, through and through.\n\nAnd nothing has given my heart\n\nIn my whole life so keen a smart\n\nAs that man’s face, so dire, so grim.\n\nFaust: Beloved child, don’t be afraid of him!\n\n3) Coleridge (kubla khan)\n\n.\n\nIn Xanadu did Kubla Khan\n\nA stately pleasure-dome decree:\n\nWhere Alph, the sacred river, ran\n\nThrough caverns measureless to man\n\nDown to a sunless sea.\n\nSo twice five miles of fertile ground\n\nWith walls and towers were girdled round;\n\nAnd there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,\n\nWhere blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;\n\nAnd here were forests ancient as the hills,\n\nEnfolding sunny spots of greenery.\n\n.\n\nBut oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted\n\nDown the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!\n\nA savage place! as holy and enchanted\n\nAs e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted\n\nBy woman wailing for her demon-lover!\n\nAnd from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,\n\nAs if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,\n\nA mighty fountain momently was forced:\n\nAmid whose swift half-intermitted burst\n\nHuge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,\n\nOr chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:\n\nAnd mid these dancing rocks at once and ever\n\nIt flung up momently the sacred river.\n\nFive miles meandering with a mazy motion\n\nThrough wood and dale the sacred river ran,\n\nThen reached the caverns measureless to man,\n\nAnd sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;\n\nAnd ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far\n\nAncestral voices prophesying war!\n\nThe shadow of the dome of pleasure\n\nFloated midway on the waves;\n\nWhere was heard the mingled measure\n\nFrom the fountain and the caves.\n\nIt was a miracle of rare device,\n\nA sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!\n\n.\n\nA damsel with a dulcimer\n\nIn a vision once I saw:\n\nIt was an Abyssinian maid\n\nAnd on her dulcimer she played,\n\nSinging of Mount Abora.\n\nCould I revive within me\n\nHer symphony and song,\n\nTo such a deep delight ’twould win me,\n\nThat with music loud and long,\n\nI would build that dome in air,\n\nThat sunny dome! those caves of ice!\n\nAnd all who heard should see them there,\n\nAnd all should cry, Beware! Beware!\n\nHis flashing eyes, his floating hair!\n\nWeave a circle round him thrice,\n\nAnd close your eyes with holy dread\n\nFor he on honey-dew hath fed,\n\nAnd drunk the milk of Paradise.\n\n4) Shelley (the cloud)\n\nI bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers,\n\nFrom the seas and the streams;\n\nI bear light shade for the leaves when laid\n\nIn their noonday dreams.\n\nFrom my wings are shaken the dews that waken\n\nThe sweet buds every one,\n\nWhen rocked to rest on their mother’s breast,\n\nAs she dances about the sun.\n\nI wield the flail of the lashing hail,\n\nAnd whiten the green plains under,\n\nAnd then again I dissolve it in rain,\n\nAnd laugh as I pass in thunder.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n5) Cornelius Matthews (Wakondah)\n\n.\n\nGreen dells that into silence stretch away\n\n.\n\n.\n\n6) Keats (hyperion)\n\n.\n\nDeep in the shady sadness of a vale\n\nFar sunken from the healthy breath of morn,\n\nFar from the fiery noon, and eve’s one star,\n\nSat gray-hair’d Saturn, quiet as a stone,\n\nStill as the silence round about his lair;\n\nForest on forest hung about his head\n\nLike cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,\n\nNot so much life as on a summer’s day\n\nRobs not one light seed from the feather’d grass,\n\nBut where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n7) Pushkin (thoughts)\n\nIf I walk the noisy streets,\n\nor enter a many thronged church,\n\nor sit among the wild young generation,\n\nI give way to my thoughts.\n\nI say to myself: the years are fleeting,\n\nand however many there seem to be,\n\nwe must all go under the eternal vault,\n\nand someone’s hour is already at hand.\n\nWhen I look at a solitary oak\n\nI think: the patriarch of the woods.\n\nIt will outlive my forgotten age\n\nas it outlived that of my grandfathers’.\n\nIf I caress a young child,\n\nimmediately I think: Farewell!\n\nI will yield my place to you,\n\nfor I must fade while your flower blooms.\n\nEach day, every hour\n\nI habitually follow in my thoughts,\n\ntrying to guess from their number\n\nthe year which brings my death.\n\nAnd where will fate send death to me?\n\nIn battle, in my travels, or on the seas?\n\nOr will the neighbouring valley\n\nreceive my chilled ashes?\n\nAnd although to the senseless body\n\nit is indifferent wherever it rots,\n\nyet close to my beloved countryside\n\nI still would prefer to rest.\n\nAnd let it be, beside the grave’s vault\n\nYoung life forever will be playing,\n\nand impartial, indifferent nature\n\nSpreads, forever staying.\n\n8) Byron (darkness)\n\nThe rivers, lakes and ocean all stood still,\n\nAnd nothing stirr’d within their silent depths;\n\nShips sailorless lay rotting on the sea,\n\nAnd their masts fell down piecemeal: as they dropp’d\n\nThey slept on the abyss without a surge—\n\nThe waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,\n\nThe moon, their mistress, had expir’d before;\n\nThe winds were wither’d in the stagnant air,\n\nAnd the clouds perish’d; Darkness had no need\n\nOf aid from them—She was the Universe.\n\n9) Tennyson (the splendor falls)\n\nThe splendor falls on castle walls\n\nAnd snowy summits old in story:\n\nThe long light shakes across the lakes,\n\nAnd the wild cataract leaps in glory.\n\nBlow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,\n\nBlow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.\n\n.\n\nO hark, O hear! how thin and clear,\n\nAnd thinner, clearer, farther going\n\nO sweet and far from cliff and scar\n\nThe horns of Elfland faintly blowng!\n\nBlow, let us hear the purple glens replying:\n\nBlow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.\n\n.\n\nO love, they die in yon rich sky,\n\nThey faint on hill or field or river:\n\nOur echoes roll from soul to soul,\n\nAnd grow for ever and for ever.\n\nBlow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,\n\nAnd answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n10) Poe (conversation of eiros and charmion)\n\nIt had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twenty-one measures of oxygen, and seventy-nine of nitrogen, in every one hundred of the atmosphere. Oxygen, which was the principle of combustion, and the vehicle of heat, was absolutely necessary to the support of animal life, and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature. Nitrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal life or flame. An unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been ascertained, in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had latterly experienced. It was the pursuit, the extension of the idea, which had engendered awe. What would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen? A combustion irresistible, all-devouring, omni-prevalent, immediate; — the entire fulfilment, in all their minute and terrible details, of the fiery and horror-inspiring denunciations of the prophecies of the Holy Book.\n\nWhy need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of mankind? That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope, was now the source of the bitterness of despair. In its impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of Fate. Meantime a day again passed — bearing away with it the last shadow of Hope. We gasped in the rapid modification of the air. The red blood bounded tumultuously through its strict channels. A furious delirium possessed all men; and, with arms rigidly outstretched towards the threatening heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud. But the nucleus of the destroyer was now upon us; — even here in Aidenn, I shudder while I speak. Let me be brief — brief as the ruin that overwhelmed. For a moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and penetrating all things. Then — let us bow down, Charmion, before the excessive majesty of the great God! — then, there came a shouting and pervading sound, as if from the mouth itself of HIM; while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we existed, burst at once into a species of intense flame, for whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat even the angels in the high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name. Thus ended all.\n\n11) Elizabeth Barrett (the drama of exile)\n\nOn a mountain peak\n\nHalf sheathed in primal woods and glittering\n\nIn spasms of awful sunshine, at that hour\n\nA lion crouched,—part raised upon his paws,\n\nWith his calm massive face turned full on thine,\n\nAnd his mane listening. When the ended curse\n\nLeft silence in the world, right suddenly\n\nHe sprang up rampant, and stood straight and stiff,\n\nAs if the new reality of death\n\nWere dashed against his eyes,—and roared so fierce,\n\n(Such thick carnivorous passion in his throat\n\nTearing a passage through the wrath and fear)—\n\nAnd roared so wild, and smote from all the hills\n\nSuch fast keen echoes crumbling down the vales\n\nTo distant silence,—that the forest beasts,\n\nOne after one, did mutter a response\n\nIn savage and in sorrowful complaint\n\nWhich trailed along the gorges.\n\n12) R. H. Horne (orion)\n\nThere, underneath the boughs, mark where the gleam\n\nOf sunrise through the roofing’s chasm is thrown\n\nUpon a grassy plot below, whereon\n\nThe shadow of a stag stoops to the stream,\n\nSwift rolling toward the cataract, and drinks,\n\nWhile ever and anon the nightingale,\n\nNot waiting for the evening, swells his hymn—\n\nHis one sustained and heaven aspiring tone—\n\nAnd when the sun hath vanished utterly,\n\nArm over arm the cedars spread their shade,\n\nWith arching wrist and long extended hands,\n\nAnd grave-ward fingers lengthening in the moon,\n\nAbove that shadowy stag whose antlers still\n\nHung o’er the stream.\n\n13) Hawthorne (the scarlet letter)\n\nShe inherited her mother’s gift for devising drapery and costume. As the last touch to her mermaid’s garb, Pearl took some eel-grass, and imitated, as best she could, on her own bosom, the decoration with which she was so familiar on her mother’s. A letter,—the letter A,—but freshly green, instead of scarlet! The child bent her chin upon her breast, and contemplated this device with strange interest; even as if the one only thing for which she had been sent into the world was to make out its hidden import.\n\n14) Marx\n\nThere is a physical relation between physical things. But it is different with commodities. There, the existence of the things qua commodities, and the value-relation between the products of labor which stamps them as commodities, have absolutely no connection with their physical properties and with the material relations arising therefrom. There it is a definite social relation between men, that assumes, in their eyes, the fantastic form of a relation between things. In order, therefore, to find an analogy, we must have recourse to the mist-enveloped regions of the religious world. In that world the productions of the human brain appear as independent beings endowed with life, and entering into relation both with one another and the human race. So it is in the world of commodities with the products of men’s hands. This I call the Fetishism which attaches itself to products of labor, so soon as they are produced as commodities.\n\n15) Emily Dickinson (because i could not stop for death)\n\n.\n\nBecause I could not stop for Death –\n\nHe kindly stopped for me –\n\nThe Carriage held but just Ourselves –\n\nAnd Immortality.\n\n.\n\nWe slowly drove – He knew no haste\n\nAnd I had put away\n\nMy labor and my leisure too,\n\nFor His Civility –\n\n.\n\nWe passed the School, where Children strove\n\nAt Recess – in the Ring –\n\nWe passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –\n\nWe passed the Setting Sun –\n\n.\n\nOr rather – He passed Us –\n\nThe Dews drew quivering and Chill –\n\nFor only Gossamer, my Gown –\n\nMy Tippet – only Tulle –\n\n.\n\nWe paused before a House that seemed\n\nA Swelling of the Ground –\n\nThe Roof was scarcely visible –\n\nThe Cornice – in the Ground –\n\n.\n\nSince then – ’tis Centuries – and yet\n\nFeels shorter than the Day\n\nI first surmised the Horses’ Heads\n\nWere toward Eternity –\n\n.\n\n.\n\n16) Wilde (the critic as artist)\n\nI should have said that great artists worked unconsciously, that they were “wiser than they knew,” as, I think, Emerson remarks somewhere, but it is really not so.\n\nAll fine imaginative work is self-conscious and deliberate. No poet sings because he must sing. At least, no great poet does. A great poet sings because he chooses to sing. It is so now, and it has always been so. We are sometimes apt to think that the voices that sounded at the dawn of poetry were simpler, fresher, and more natural than ours, and that the world which the early poets looked at, and through which they walked, had a kind of poetical quality of its own, and almost without changing could pass into song. The snow lies thick now upon Olympus, and its steep, scraped sides are bleak and barren, but once, we fancy, the white feet of the Muses brushed the dew from the anemones in the morning, and at evening came Apollo to sing to the shepherds in the vale. But in this we are merely lending to other ages what we desire, or think we desire, for our own. Our historical sense is at fault. Every century that produces poetry is, so far, an artificial century, and the work that seems to us to be the most natural and simple product of its time is always the result of the most self-conscious effort. There is no fine art without self-consciousness, and self-consciousness and the critical spirit are one.\n\nThe longer one studies life and literature, the more strongly one feels that behind everything that is wonderful stands the individual, and that it is not the moment that makes the man, but the man who creates the age. Indeed, I am inclined to think that each myth and legend that seems to us to spring out of the wonder, or terror, or fancy of tribe and nation, was in its origin the invention of one single mind.\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nSome interesting choices here! Karl Marx?? And who is R.H. Horne? And Cornelius Matthews? Perhaps only the Scarriet March Madness Committee knows for sure.\n\nTeasing is a psychological state which is crucial to understanding human nature, and yet, as far as I know, it has never been given its due.\n\nTeasing is ubiquitous—most of us tease, consciously, or impulsively—but teasing is also highly ambiguous and complex—part of its nature is to disappear into other modes—humor, cruelty.\n\nBut why does teasing fall completely below the radar of social science? Apart from its hiding capacity, the most obvious reason why teasing as a legitimate psychological category eludes researchers, scholars, and distinguished and credentialed pedants of all stripes, is that teasing refuses to take itself, or others, seriously—therefore it naturally eludes all serious study.\n\nThe pithy remarks of an Oscar Wilde belong to the comic stage or the quotation book; serious scholars shudder at the idea of Wilde’s teasing wit upending their authoritative conclusions. One of teasing’s many manifestations is wit, destructive wit—the enemy of science, philosophy, and religion. “The best way to resist temptation is to give into it,” laughs Oscar. Teasing is walled off—even as it promotes wise laughter—from the wise investigations of the pundit.\n\nI will now give teasing the prominence it deserves.\n\nLet me posit the two most obvious modes of human behavior and psychology, which occupy the opposite sides of the behavioral spectrum—fighting on one side, and cooperation, affection, or love on the other. We’ll call it love, for simplicity’s sake. Hate and love. The fighting impulse and the loving impulse.\n\nTeasing, as I see it, is perfectly suited to connect the two, to occupy the third, or middle ground which partly interacts with hate and partly interacts with love. Teasing, as is well known, and which I have observed above, is an extremely common behavior which covers a great deal of ambiguous psychological territory—teasing can be affectionate and humorous; we tease those we like, we tease those we want to like more, and we tease those with whom we feel extremely comfortable.\n\nTeasing can be neutral—we tease to find out how much a person can take, and this can be part of just getting to know a person, though it can seem invasive, even if it’s done out of friendliness or curiosity.\n\nTeasing can also be vindictive, insulting, terrible.\n\nAnd teasing can seem cruel, even if this is not its intention.\n\nWe would expect nothing less of this far-reaching cloud of ambiguity which unites hate and love.\n\nWhat is life but a tease?\n\nThe mature soul understands the tease of admiring and desiring things which we both hate and love—the teasing mixture.\n\nThe craven person and the child don’t deal in hybrids—they only love or hate.\n\nMaturity deals with the hybrid, and is resigned to being teased constantly.\n\nThe immature person viciously avoids being teased, and takes a sadistic delight, quite often, in teasing.\n\nTeasing, then, is good and bad. Which should be expected, since hate sits on one shoulder, and love on the other.\n\nTeasing rounds out love and hate as a three-part psychology—and teasing, itself, exists in three parts, friendly, neutral, and hostile.\n\nSatire, a form of teasing, can run the gamut from hostile to elevating, depending on how it is seen; satire can be a nasty political weapon, or it can use literature to gently seek truth.\n\nPoetry, which today is mostly officious and uptight, once indulged in the sweet rivalry of teasing. Who can forget Byron teasing the poet laureates of England, William Wordsworth and Robert Southey?\n\n“Go little book, from this, my solitude!\n\nI cast thee on the waters—go thy ways!\n\nAnd if, as I believe, thy vein be good,\n\nThe world will find thee after many days.”\n\nWhen Southey’s read, and Wordsworth’s understood,\n\nI can’t help putting in my claim to praise—\n\nThe first four rhymes are Southey’s every line:\n\nFor God’s sake, reader! Take them not for mine.\n\nTeasing has this most important property: the ability to defuse hate (because it is comedy) and the equal ability to defuse love (because it is ridicule)—teasing can lead to war or love, with cunning or accidental, suddenness.\n\nTeasing can be sweet and appropriate, or embarrassing and clumsy, depending on all sorts of psychological, material, and personal skill factors, both natural and learned.\n\nIs it any wonder that ubiquitous, ambiguous teasing belongs prominently in the middle of the two most defined poles of human behavior—the fighting impulse, and the cooperative one?\n\nFurther, teasing is a directional indicator—it can be an intellectual vehicle to move towards love, or an intellectual vehicle to move towards hate. Or it can simply exist for itself, a buffer against hate to “keep the peace,” a buffer against love to “remain grounded.”\n\nMost of us, in fact, live in the ambiguous state of teasing all the time, with a cloudy, occluded, semi-curious, bemused view of all those “higher” issues that escape teasing, and make life serious, or thrilling, or sublime, or tragic. We giggle at the serious, and feel protected, and rather content, in our “teasing” bubble, as we stay clear of serious hate on one side and serious love, on the other, each pole dangerous for different, and perhaps similar (!) reasons. Teasing is a highly effective means to deal with hate—to ridicule what we dislike, so that we laugh, an effective way of dealing with our own anger and dislike. And satire is a way for us to safely contemplate love—aren’t comedians, with their worldly, urbane personalities, genuinely wise when it comes to the dangers, extremes, and follies of love?\n\nThe danger is, that if we laugh too hard, we will never love, again.\n\nJust as if we hate too much, we will never love again.\n\nIt may be comfortable to always mock, but teasing is also wrapped up in fear. Teasing is real; it is not just an occasional strategy.\n\nTeasing eclipses love and hate. Teasing also eclipses real feelings.\n\nSome people never reach a state of sublime love—it’s nothing but Romantic poppycock to them—the goal of love is merely a sad, or perhaps an amusing, tease to them; either they have no partner, or, if they do, it is a lover or husband whom they don’t quite love—but they tease them, sometimes affectionately, sometimes cruelly, and these feeling-states are really the best they can do, so vast is that middle ground of teasing, hovering between hate and love.\n\nThe thing about teasing is that it allows us to tease, but it also teases us.\n\nIn this ambiguous, granular state of continual confusion, in the middle-ground, teasing, mode, we glimpse the warrior and the lover, truly sublime figures who truly live, dimly, as in a mist. The teasing state really doesn’t know anything. Teasing is an attitude, not knowledge. Teasing has no true feelings, though it has a general sense of what they are, since it exists beside hate and love. In the teasing state we ridicule all those who take life seriously. We intellectualize, but in a fraudulent manner. We know ourselves to be frauds. We only know small things at small moments. All we can do, with any vigor at all, is mock.\n\nThe whore has no philosophy. Those completely without love, the whore and the recluse, represent the two extremes—the whore teases; the recluse is teased. The whore and the recluse are both anti-social. Society finds it difficult to function if there are too many of these in their ranks.\n\nAnd those with extremist views (who politicians cynically weaponize) become even more extremist when they are teased about their views. When someone tells you that you are wrong, that is one thing, but when someone tells you are wrong as they are laughing, that is another thing altogether.\n\nTeasing, in itself, is neither good nor bad. It is a highly social way of behaving—it can mollify, it can lead to friendships, but it can also incense and enrage.\n\nA recluse shies away from teasing.\n\nA whore loves to tease.\n\nIt is a cliché to say the whore is stupid, but it’s always true. All they can do is tease. They laugh at both hate and love, and this is their intellectual position, the intellectual position of all who remain in the ambiguous state of mockery and bland, mindless, ambiguity.\n\nTo the whore, all intellectuals to them are one person: Woody Allen, a guy who talks very fast, in a high voice. If the Woody Allen makes them laugh, they are OK, but if the intellectual should turn “serious,” the whore only hears a high voice talking too fast, and nothing the intellectual says when the intellectual is being “serious” matters, or makes any sense. Which is probably true, since most intellectuals are frauds.\n\nThe whore sees men in three ways; they are either rapists, or a Woody Allen—who might occasionally amuse them by making them laugh—or finally a man with a hairy mustache, a nice stubble, who mumbles in French, in a deep voice, and has a big jaw and tiny eyes (see! I tease) whom the whore perhaps wishes to sleep with. Of course the man with the mustache, whom the whore favors, is not a real person, as unreal as the whore herself—a mere collection of errant atoms—who teases, and is teased, by a reality that remains shut to them, in their ambiguous state of mockery and stupidity. There is nothing they can know, and their “philosophy” is “we cannot know anything!” The male equivalent to the whore is the cunning, ambiguous, fake-intellectual man who is determined to tease the whore whom he is attracted to—to give her a dose of her own medicine. Knowledge is absent. Everything is impulse. All intellectuality in this realm is merely teasing, to give oneself a temporary, mocking, advantage.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with living in the teasing state—it is where everyone, except the psychopath, or the genius, lives. It belongs to the sad, charming smile of humility; it resides with humorous affection. It is a guard against extremes. It is the mystery in which we dwell with a smile.\n\nBut life is not truly lived, or experience"
