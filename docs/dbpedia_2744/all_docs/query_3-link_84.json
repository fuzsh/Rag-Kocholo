        "text": "Guy Ritchie has returned to the genre where he made his name in new movie The Gentlemen, but sadly it doesn't sound like it was worth the wait.\n\nThe gangster movie packs a stellar cast, including Matthew McConaughey, Hugh Grant, Henry Golding and Michelle Dockery to name a few, and follows a drug lord as he tries to sell off his empire.\n\nHowever, the first reviews aren't glowing, with some suggesting it is an \"autopilot\" rehash of his previous gangster movie days, while others called the movie 'offensive' and full of \"racial slurs\".\n\nHere's what the critics are saying:\n\nScreen International\n\n\"Charting a bloody turf war between London drug barons, The Gentlemen is a disposable crime caper on autopilot.\n\n\"Propped up by an all-star ensemble, particularly the sturdy Charlie Hunnam and scene-stealer Colin Farrell, Guy Ritchie reclaims the genre that brought him to fame but does little more than shuffle battered parts into an intermittently entertaining configuration.\n\n\"While recycling the familiar, leaning on stylised violence and unleashing a flurry of self-satisfied dialogue have long been the writer/director's specialty, this isn't a return to form. And, even though it arrives so soon after his blockbuster Aladdin remake, this is certainly not a whole new world, rather a routine return to an easy, well-greased template.\"\n\nIndieWire\n\n\"The Gentlemen is the kind of shaggy-dog yarn that Ritchie spun with diminishing returns before the tantalizing paychecks of franchise cinema were dangled his way: a hard-R venture, populated by RADA graduates pointing weapons and cursing at one another between elaborate double-crosses.\n\n\"The difference is that its director is now in a position to equip his cobblers with the budgetary heft of an American indie (The Gentlemen emerges under the apparently deathless Miramax banner) and an altogether starrier ensemble. The problem is that at no point does Ritchie seem to have realized such material is still, on a fundamental level, bollox.\"\n\nVariety\n\n\"The actors, splendidly kitted out in autumnal suiting and knitwear by costume designer Michael Wilkinson, have what fun they can with such thin, dated material, but everyone here deserves better: Despite scattered references to grime music and Brexit, The Gentlemen carries precious little flavor, either in its quick, choppy craft or its familiarly expletive-laden dialogue, of British life, politics, vernacular or even filmmaking in 2019: Where Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, for all its obnoxious, now over-imitated tics, burst onto the UK indie scene with genuinely reckless, rebellious energy, this feels as much a mouthy tourist in its modern London as McConaughey's enterprising scumbag. Himself gentrified by a decade in Hollywood's big leagues, Ritchie doesn't much seem to know his own scuzzy world anymore.\"\n\nThe Independent\n\n\"Being an 'equal opportunity offender' doesn't magically excuse racism. You'd think writer-director Guy Ritchie would be aware of this in 2019. And yet, here we have The Gentlemen, in which an all-star cast repeat racial slurs under the delusion that its standard practice for a no-holds barred comedy about shady men and their even shadier dealings.\n\n\"In truth, Ritchie's ultra-British gangster films have always walked a thin line between their boys-will-be-boys flippancy and plain cruelty – take Snatch's aggressive stereotyping of Irish Travellers as nonsense-talking fighters and layabouts, despised and degraded by society. But The Gentlemen seems to be the angriest of all Ritchie's films.\"\n\nThe Guardian\n\n\"The Gentlemen barrels cheerfully along like a 113-minute Madness video, and one reason it's more watchable is that Ritchie doesn't indulge his terrible habit of speeded-up montage scenes.\n\n\"Another reason is that it has Hugh Grant playing against type as an outrageously déclassé hacker-snoop-turned-screenwriter who reckons he has the goods on a drug baron, played by Matthew McConaughey, and attempts to blackmail him into stumping up the cash to produce his film based on this mobster's dirty dealings.\"\n\nDigital Spy now has a newsletter – sign up to get it sent straight to your inbox."
