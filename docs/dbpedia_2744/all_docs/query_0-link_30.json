        "text": "GUY RITCHIE | WARNER BROS. PICTURES\n\nMAIN TITLE\n\nPrologue wanted to create a main title sequence consistent with Guy Ritchieâ€™s high style. Ritchie provided a cut of his film, as well as stencil artwork from the street artist Banksy as an idea for what he wanted the studio logos and titles to accomplish. Prologue created most of the stencil artwork from scratch, manually drawing the entire alphabet to recreate the studio logos and titles. Then, using stop-motion photography, each letter was spray-painted over. Prologue also created the graphics for each of the main cast members and set them in front of recognizable London locations, such as the Tower Bridge. These graphics are accompanied by frenetic animations that speak to the uniquely unhinged nature of the ensemble cast of criminals."
