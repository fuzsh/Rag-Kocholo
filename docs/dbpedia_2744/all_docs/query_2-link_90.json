        "text": "AS years go, it’s been a pretty good one for Tom Wilkinson. The dependable English actor started off 2008 with an Oscar nod for playing a mentally unbalanced lawyer in “Michael Clayton.” He followed with a series-stealing turn as a dandyish Ben Franklin in HBO’s “John Adams,” and by playing James Baker in the channel’s excellent political drama “Recount.” He earned Emmy nominations for both and won for “Adams.”\n\nNext Wilkinson goes off-type a bit, playing a ruthless London crime boss in “RocknRolla,” the latest intricate, hypercharged crime epic from Guy Ritchie. The film marks a return to form for Mr. Madonna after misfiring with “Revolver” and “Swept Away.” It opens Wednesday.\n\nRitchie is a bit of an icon in England. Does appearing in one of his movies bestow a certain kind of status?\n\nI don’t know. I got a telephone call out of the blue from my agent saying, “Do you want to meet Guy Ritchie? He’s interested in you being in his movie, but he doesn’t want to show you a script.” So I was curious about Guy Ritchie, because he has an odd reputation in [England] – odd in the way that the British can very much turn on people they think are too successful or too handsome or too lucky. In the press, there’s always an ambiguous attitude toward Guy, which I didn’t have. I was only too happy to meet him. He came ’round to my house and pitched this thing, and I thought, What have I got to lose playing a role I don’t do much? Or ever?\n\nDoes the highly stylized nature of his films appeal to you?\n\nTo tell you the truth, “RocknRolla” is the only Guy Ritchie movie I’ve ever seen. I am impressed by it. I think it’s a wonderful film. Naturally enough, at least in [England], the posh newspapers didn’t seem to get it, and I don’t understand why, except in the context of what I told you earlier.\n\nYou’re in “Valkyrie,” the oft-delayed, badly buzzed-about Tom Cruise WWII movie. Has it been unfairly maligned?\n\nIf it’s unfairly maligned, it’s for the reasons akin to the reasons Guy Ritchie’s movies are. I think people have issues with Tom Cruise over and above the work he does, which is unfair. I haven’t seen the movie, but I’ve talked to two or three people who have, and they say it’s very good indeed. And these are people for whom there’s nothing in it to say it’s good. It’s an intelligent script, well directed, and Tom Cruise is a good actor.\n\nWhy didn’t you attend the Emmys?\n\nI’ve just had a double hip operation. I had them both replaced. They were getting worn down. During the Emmys, I was in the hospital. I’d loved to have gone, but I was unfortunately detained. It’s one of those things where you come out feeling worse than when you went in. I can get around OK, but on crutches.\n\ndid working on “Recount” affect your opinion of the American political system?\n\nAs an English guy, what I became aware of was how much democracy there is in the American system – all the kinds of balances and different courts that can do this and that. In England, it’s much more streamlined, and it may not be in a good way. For example, the prime minister has much more power in the British context than the American president has. There aren’t all these built-in constraints. It was very interesting from that point of view. I couldn’t pretend to understand all the ins and outs and the legal niceties of when you can have a recount and when you can’t.\n\n* “This year I’ve hardly been working, because I haven’t been able to walk properly. My free time used to be filled up by such devastatingly original pastimes as playing golf. That’s gone by the wayside. Now I’m sort of plunked on the sofa watching TV.”\n\n* “I haven’t been to Broadway for ages. Last time I went, I took the kids before Christmas to see ‘Jersey Boys,’ which was fantastic. My eldest daughter came up to me at the interval and said, ‘Dad, I just don’t want it to end.’ “\n\n* “I don’t think [I’ll ever move to America from London]. The kids are being educated and will continue to be educated for the next three or four years, so I can’t see us shifting. One of the attractions of California, as you look out on this gloomy day in London, is the weather. I think both my wife and I are attracted to warm weather rather than cold. But you get stuck in your ways. I like this city.”\n\n* “The financial crisis is absolutely scary, scary, scary. I’ve got money in banks, and I thought banks were invulnerable. They were the ultimate sort of thing. You don’t speculate with your money, you put it in a bank. I was doing a movie last year, and I looked across the river in Jacksonville, and there were one, two, three – three buildings with Wachovia written on them. And you thought, Wow! Big, big buildings, big, big operations. And it’s on its knees now. It’s unbelievable.”"
