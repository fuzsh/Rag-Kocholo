        "text": "MerrittTheFerret (5 out of 10 )\n\nWell, ten stars for the script, but one star for the movie that got made. Funny story, I saw this movie in theaters with three good friends of mine, I had recently gotten a gift-card for the movie theater and I asked everybody if they wanted to go see a movie. We all decided \"RockNRolla\" looked like the best movie they were showing and soon we were in the theater, watching it. Two and a half hours later, we all walked out saying \"WTF?\" But in the end, we had a pretty good time, even if the movie was pretty horrible.\n\nEddy (10 out of 10 )\n\nWOW- The movie was poor? ETTO I suppose, would be a boring world if we all liked the same things. Personally I thought it was brilliant, so many good characters and its the type of film that can be watched over and over.\n\nFrank (5 out of 10 )\n\nIf rock and rolla is poor then there is not much that can interest you I reckon.\n\nRolaball (10 out of 10 )\n\nAmazing film, brilliant dialogue, brilliant acting. Second favourite film after Pulp Fiction. The characters are excellent and the plot is great. Ritchie done a great job of directing, if you came out from watching this thinking what then I would love to know how the hell you got your head around Inception. Can't wait for the next 2 films in the series bring it on.\n\nCameron (10 out of 10 )\n\nRocknrolla is a hilarious crime comedy with, of course, a lot of rock music, hence the name.\n\nLeandro (10 out of 10 )\n\nGuy Ritchie at his finest. One of the best crime movies made in England that we can watch."
