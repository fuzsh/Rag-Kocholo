        "text": "According to Variety, acclaimed filmmaker Guy Ritchie is currently developing his next feature directorial project titled Wife and Dog, which will tackle British aristocracy.\n\nRitchie most recently explored the colorful and eccentric world of the British upper class in Netflix‘s The Gentlemen series starring Theo James, which served as a spin-off to his 2019 movie of the same name. At the moment, the streamer hasn’t announced if the crime comedy-drama would be returning for a second season. Besides The Gentlemen series, Ritchie also recently directed Henry Cavill in the action period comedy The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, which is now available to rent or own on digital platforms.\n\nWho’s involved in Wife and Dog?\n\nWife and Dog will written and directed by Ritchie. Further details about its plot and characters remained under wraps. Just like Ritchie’s previous movies, the project is expected to assemble an A-list cast, who are reportedly still in negotiations. The film will be produced by Ritchie, Ivan Atkinson and John Friedberg, with Teddy Schwarzman and Michael Heimler set as executive producers.\n\nBesides Wife and Dog, Ritchie has two more high-profile projects lined up, including the action thriller In the Grey which will reunite him Cavill and Jake Gyllenhaal (The Covenant). The British filmmaker is also currently in production for the upcoming heist adventure movie Fountain of Youth, which will see John Krasinksi and Natalie Portman playing siblings.\n\nProduction on Wife and Dog is slated to begin later this year in October."
