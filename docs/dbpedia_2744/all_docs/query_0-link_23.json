        "text": "I didn’t even know he had made a new movie. His last one wasn’t my fav, at least Andre 3000 was great in it.\n\nI just watched the trailer, I don’t know either. Now there’s Ludacris… And I love The Subways song but doesn’t sound good, not the best choice. The whole trailer like a pastich of both Snatch and Lock, Stock. I’ll wait for the movie, can’t judget beforebut I’m not that excited for the release.\n\nNice for sharing the vid though\n\nHard to tell much from the trailer. Lots of flash but nothing that sticks out. I hope he amps up the humor which was lacking in Revolver, which I noticed was not mentioned as a movie “written by” Guy in the trailer.\n\nAnyone see the U.S. cut of revolver? They made it even worse. They butchered my favorite scene with sorter deciding to go ape shit on their asses.\n\nanyways, back on topic. I really hope Guy can bring back his early flare. Directors are supposed to get better with age, yes? Does that not hold up anymore? Its hard to imagine that Guy just got lucky with his first two movies. One more flop and no one will touch another film of his.\n\nThe cast is great though, I must say. Jeremy Piven, Thandie Newton, Mark Strong and a bunch of old and new geezers who faces I know but names escape me. I wish he could have fit Vinnie Jones in there somewhere but with Gerard Butler as the films bad ass I guess theres not much point.\n\nGood luck Guy!\n\n[quote=“Knoxville Kingpin”]\n\nanyways, back on topic.

I guess it’s his last chance not to loose all his fans. I haven’t seen the Revolver US version but the european one wasn’t good either."
