        "text": "Aladdin\n\nPerhaps the most appropriate word to describe Disney’s 2019 re-make of their 1992 classic, Aladdin, is “unnecessary.” “Pointless” might also apply. Although those terms could be employed for a host of remakes, they are more apt here ...\n\nGentlemen, The\n\nFor any Downton Abbey fans desirous of hearing Lady Mary Crawley drop the f-bomb, Guy Ritchie has you covered. Not only does Michelle Dockery spew profanity with enough frequency and vigor to keep up with her numerous male co-stars, but she kn...\n\nGuy Ritchie's The Covenant\n\nThe Covenant offers Guy Ritchie an opportunity to step out of his comfort zone and try something with more substance than is usual for him. Gone are the snarky one-liners and zingers that have become his trademarks. And, although there’s certain...\n\nKing Arthur: Legend of the Sword\n\nThe most important name associated with this new telling of the tale of King Arthur is “Guy Ritchie.” More than most working directors, Ritchie comes to projects with his own specific take on them – one that inevitably rubs some viewers ...\n\nLock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\n\nThe tale of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is the most improbable of success stories. After having difficulty securing a financial backer, Guy Ritchie's debut feature became one of the biggest home-grown successes in the U.K. last year. Now...\n\nMan from U.N.C.L.E., The\n\n17 years ago, the film industry dusted off a popular 1960s spy show, created a bloated, big-screen iteration with stars like Ralph Fiennes, Sean Connery, and Uma Thurman, and watched it implode at the box office. Terrible reviews and public indiffere...\n\nMinistry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, The\n\nIn his famous 1944 speech to the Third Army, General George S. Patton said the following: “The Nazis are the enemy. Wade into them. Spill their blood. Shoot them in the belly.” I don’t know whether director Guy Ritchie thought of those w...\n\nOperation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre\n\nOperation Fortune: Ruse de guerre represents the second consecutive collaboration (and fifth overall) between director Guy Ritchie and actor Jason Statham. My main complaint about their 2021 effort, Wrath of Man, was related to the somber tone. For...\n\nRevolver\n\nRevolver had its world premiere at the 2005 Toronto Film Festival, some 27 months before finding its way into a small number of U.S. multiplexes. If that says nothing else, it's that distributors shied away from the film, fearing its complete lack...\n\nRocknRolla\n\nGuy Ritchie made his mark for film-goers not by marrying one of the world's most visible pop stars, but by crafting Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. He exploded onto the cinematic scene with the former; the reaction from Hollywood wa..."
