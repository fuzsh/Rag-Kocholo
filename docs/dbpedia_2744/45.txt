Guy Ritchie, the dude who directed the definitely-not-G-rated Snatch and RocknRolla, has been tapped by the Disney bosses to helm a live-action update of their 1992 megaclassicAladdin. Ritchie will be directing from a script by Titan A.E. writer John August, Deadline reported Monday. If this sounds like a potentially not-great idea to you, here's a friendly reminder that Disney's similar approach to this year's The Jungle Book revival stacked up almost a billion bucks at the global box office.

The original Aladdin, featuring the voice talent of Scott Weinger and the late Robin Williams, has endured as one of Disney's most beloved animated films. Though not on the same level of arguable dopeness as the 1992 original, the film also inspired two straight-to-video sequels, Aladdin and the King of Thieves and The Return of Jafar.

In addition to very Ritchie movies like the aforementioned Snatch and RocknRolla, dude is also known for for his pair of Robert Downey Jr.-starring Sherlock Holmes blockbusters in 2009 and 2011. Ritchie also recently wrapped production on King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, a film centered on a young Arthur (Charlie Hunnam) as he comes to terms with all the cool shit Excalibur allows him to do. The film is due next year.

In September, Disney announced Jungle Book director Jon Favreau would be returning for more reinvented nostalgia with a live-action update of The Lion King. "The Lion King builds on Disney's success of reimagining its classics for a contemporary audience with films like Maleficent, Cinderella, and The Jungle Book," Disney said in a press release. "Like Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King will include songs from the animated film."
