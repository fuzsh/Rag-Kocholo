        "text": "Abstract The premise of my doctoral research is to ask how sacred Hindu iconography in traditional Indian classical dance might translate to secular, feminist performance. Similar to a choreographic design, the practical creative work and the theoretical research engage in a ‘duet’ of movement back and forth, both sharing a strong gestural motif that reinforces the central theme of \"sacred to secular\", and \"tradition as transgression”. The thesis will establish my relationship to Goddess Kali phenomena as my cultural milieu, both past and present, and situate my practice in the context of other global practitioners. Artists who demonstrate precedents of my practice include Indian choreographer and dancer, Chandralekha (b. 1928 - 2006), performance artists including American Carolee Schneeman (b. 1939), Japanese born Yoko Ono (b. 1933) and Serbian-born Marina Abramovic (b. 1946), as well as American photographic artist, Cindy Sherman (b. 1954) who all employ often confrontational and sometimes violent imagery in their work. In tracing Kali from pre-colonial to postcolonial India, drawing on Indian scholar David R. Kinsley (b. 1939 - 2000), this thesis will explore the evolution of Kali iconography to embrace subjects beyond sacred ritual and tradition that challenge attitudes of racial stereotyping, identity, culture, and predominantly as protest to attitudes of female shame. Because the momentum of my practice addresses both feminist and intercultural theories, it draws on Indian scholarship such as the feminist, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak (b. India 1942), activist Mala Sen (b. 1947-2011) and intercultural scholar Rustom Bharucha (b.1953) whose writing underpin the exegesis. An autoethnographic approach (Ellis, C et al., 2011, p.1) links the threads of the scholarly enquiry. The creative research, the performance work, Urban Kali, extends the concept of tradition as transgression, and explores the tensions between the sacred and the secular through what might be described as contemporary feminist intercultural performance. The research suggests that contemporary performance utilising traditional Kali iconography can transcend and subvert cultural significance to express and embody feminine identity.\n\nThis article takes an ethnographic approach to examine how Muslim public persona of diasporic artists employ stereotypical cultural signs of the Muslim to manifest and challenge the dichotomy of so-called immigrant and host culture. Considering the performative Muslimness of artistic self-exposure and practices, this study examines how self-design can visually challenge the nativist sense of belonging while reclaiming and redefining North American identity in Canada and the US. I contend that aesthetic Muslimness reflects an individualized version of Islam that confronts both the supposedly unified group identity of diasporic Muslim inner communities and broader social cohesion projects based on identity thinking. Such particular artistic initiative brings forward alternative ways of fostering mutual understanding of individuals from diverse communities countering misrecognition in the inner and broader community. Thereby, the article reveals how a subaltern case of Muslim identification with artistic public persona associates with a visual sense of dissonant cultural belonging to diverge from precepts of assigned group identity.\n\nThrough an analysis of local Sundanese music in distinct settings in village and urban contexts, this article observes and analyses different constructions of meaning around Sundanese Islamic music, as well as the role played by cultural activists and village audiences in those constructions. Based on fieldwork in Tasikmalaya, West Java, I explore the novel meanings given to village genres in urban contexts, and contrast that with the affective responses of village audiences. I find that musical meanings offer different processes of identity formation within particular social boundaries. Emergent Indonesian political developments shape these processes. Keywords Islamic music-Sundanese culture-the construction of meaning-village-urban settings-local identity 1 Introduction West Java has long been a site of tension over Islam and cultural expression. The most recent incidents involved the destruction of statues. On 11 Febru-ary 2016, members of the hard-line Muslim group Front Pembela Islam (FPI, Islamic Defenders' Front) ventured out at midnight to destroy statues depicting the wayang character Arjuna in a tourist park in Purwakarta Regency. The regency is well-known for its wayang statues erected in the park and in other prominent locations. In a later attack, a number of other statues in the city Downloaded from Brill.com01/05/2021 07:53:50AM via free access"
