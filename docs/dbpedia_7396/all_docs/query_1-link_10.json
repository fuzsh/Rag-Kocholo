        "text": "An inside look into the lives of one of the most talented bunch of musicians in the country and their experience with Pepsi Battle of the Bands\n\nLoves: Singing\n\nTravelling\n\nSnazzy cars/bikes\n\nPet peeves: Being disorganized\n\nTalking a lot\n\nFavorite moment from BOB: When we got the much awaited standing ovation\n\nFavorite judge: Strings\n\nThat one moment when you felt you owned the stage?\n\nWhile performing Azaadi\n\nMoment you felt most nervous on stage?\n\nFirst danger zone\n\nThe band you enjoyed competing with most in Pepsi Battle of Bands?\n\nTamasha and Xarb\n\nYour biggest fear has always been?\n\nTo die before fulfilling my dreams\n\nYour biggest driving force?\n\nMy parents\n\nIf you werenâ€™t a musician, what you would be?\n\nI have no freaking idea. I think I would have loved to be a professional driver and drove across the globe\n\nYour ultimate inspiration from the global music fraternity of all times, and why?\n\nI love the fact how music is not bound by time or any single person. A lot of people inspire, play their part and leave. But one person who I regard highly in terms of performance and dedication is MJ (Michael Jackson). I have never ever seen better performer than him\n\nThree things you cannot function without?\n\nFood\n\nSleep (although Iâ€™ve been compromising on that a lot lately)\n\nMy favourite people\n\nMuqueet Shahzad\n\nThat one moment when you felt you owned the stage?\n\nI can recall such feeling from two occasions. First, when we played at the Lahore Music Meet 2018 to an amazing crowd with good weather and a brilliant setup. Second, when we performed Azadi at the Pepsi Battle of the Bands. Emotions during that performance were really high and we are glad we were able to translate our emotions into our performance\n\nMoment you felt most nervous on stage?\n\nMost nervous moment wasnâ€™t pre-performance or during performance. In fact, it was post-performance. This was while on stage, receiving feedback from the judges after our Episode 3 performance. That was really something.\n\nThe band you enjoyed competing with most in Pepsi Battle of Bands?\n\nXarb: what a brilliant bunch of individuals to experience this journey with! One may call it competition but it honestly wasnâ€™t a competition, more than anything else it was a celebration of music. Looking forward to work with them again in future\n\nYour biggest fear has always been?\n\nNot trying for something I want\n\nYour biggest driving force?\n\nInspiring someone, using your existence to improve someoneâ€™s life. As Einstein said, â€œThe best life is the life lived for others.â€ That sums it up for me.\n\nIf you werenâ€™t a musician, what you would be?\n\nWell, the interesting bit is that all of us are doing something else alongside music in our lives as well. We have different jobs that we feel as passionate about as we do for music. However, speaking strictly in terms of artistic direction â€“ if I werenâ€™t a musician, I would be a filmmaker or a designer.\n\nYour ultimate inspiration from the global music fraternity of all times, and why?\n\nThere is never one inspiration, you get inspired by so many artists as you journey through life. I would like to mention two artists here who have had a profound impact on me not only as a musician but as a human:Â Iron Maiden and Hans Zimmer.\n\nOn a deserted island youâ€™d wish to be left alone with…?\n\nChristopher Nolan\n\nThree things you cannot function without?\n\nOxygen\n\nWater\n\nFood\n\nThat one phrase or line which describes you to the core is?\n\nZindagi mukhtasir hai tou pyar karein, kyun larein, kyun apna shikaar karein. (Life is short so letâ€™s love, why fight, why prey on oneself.)\n\nMansoor Lashari\n\nThat one moment when you felt you owned the stage?\n\nDefinitely during Azaadi. We barely remember what we were doing on stage. There was so much energy and passion during that performance that we felt unstoppable.\n\nMoment you felt most nervous on stage?\n\nThe first danger zone. Iâ€™ll be honest, I wasnâ€™t expecting the danger zone so early on and I was worried.\n\nThe band you enjoyed competing with most in Pepsi Battle of Bands?\n\nThe most direct and high stakes situation we had to face was against Tamasha. Theyâ€™re awesome guys making great music and Iâ€™m humbled to have been able to share that stage with them.\n\nYour biggest fear has always been?\n\nStagnating in my work and music.\n\nYour biggest driving force?\n\nA deeply embedded spirit of randomness mixed with the undying support of my family.\n\nIf you werenâ€™t a musician, what you would be?\n\nIâ€™d probably still be working the same day job but Iâ€™d be bored with life :p\n\nYour ultimate inspiration from the global music fraternity of all times, and why?\n\nThe source of inspiration changes as one grows and matures. But I guess if I had to choose someone, Iâ€™d choose John Bonham from Led Zeppelin.\n\nOn a deserted island youâ€™d wish to be left alone with?\n\nSome books. And the ability to get back to normal life when I want to.\n\nThree things you cannot function without?\n\nWater\n\nFood\n\nAir\n\nThat one phrase or line which describes you to the core is?\n\nBuilding a life of purpose is the purpose of life.\n\nShahrukh Aslam\n\nLoves: Catz (no, not a typo)\n\nChocolate\n\nPet peeves: People who are always late\n\nLaunda style badtameezi (hooliganism and bad manners)\n\nFavourite judge?\n\nBilal\n\nFavourite moment?\n\nThe fact that Paani Aur Mitti doesnâ€™t have a â€œcomposedâ€ solo. I winged it and it didnâ€™t suck.\n\nThat one moment when you felt you owned the stage?\n\nWhen I played part of the national anthem during Azadi\n\nMoment you felt most nervous on stage?\n\nThe top 8 episode when we played the Hadiqa Kiyani song\n\nThe band you enjoyed competing with most in Pepsi Battle of Bands?\n\nXarb, for sure.\n\nYour biggest fear has always been?\n\nLosing the people I care for.\n\nYour biggest driving force?\n\nHonda City\n\nIf you werenâ€™t a musician, what you would be?\n\nIâ€™m not a musician right now either. Iâ€™m a program manager who plays the guitar.\n\nYour ultimate inspiration from the global music fraternity of all times, and why?\n\nPearl Jamâ€™s Alive\n\nOn a deserted island youâ€™d wish to be left alone with?\n\nAhem. Catz (still not a typo).\n\nThree things you cannot function without?\n\nFood\n\nWater\n\nThe company of the people who matter\n\nThat one phrase or line which describes you to the core is?\n\nI am mine.\n\nHaider Abbas\n\nLoves: Trekking, Nature, Positivity\n\nPet peeves: Negativity, closed-mindedness\n\nFavorite judge: Bilal Maqsood\n\nThat one moment when you felt you owned the stage?\n\nThe performance of Azaadi was one of the greatest highlights on stage for me. The attitude, energy and the preparation all made up for the performance.\n\nMoment you felt most nervous on stage?\n\nGoing into the danger zone for the first was quite taxing mentally. Since it was the start of the competition, we werenâ€™t expecting to receive such criticism.\n\nThe band you enjoyed competing with most in Pepsi Battle of Bands?\n\nThe second finalist, Xarb, was the perfect competition in the show. They had a seamless journey with some great music. The boys from Xarb are amazing humans and weâ€™re looking forward to a collaboration with them in near future.\n\nYour biggest fear has always been?\n\nGetting stuck in a mundane lifestyle with little to look forward to.\n\nYour biggest driving force?\n\nThe yearning to make an impact and be a source of inspiration for generations to come.\n\nIf you werenâ€™t a musician, what you would be?\n\nIn an alternate life, I would be a video game developer.\n\nYour ultimate inspiration from the global music fraternity of all times, and why?\n\nI have a range of inspirations from different styles and genres of music. But if I were to choose just one musician, it would be Hans Zimmer. Music itself is a story for the listener and presenting it with the perfect visuals is something Iâ€™ve always wanted to do.\n\nOn a deserted island youâ€™d wish to be left alone with…?\n\nA Playstation, endless supply of games and a music instrument (piano ideally).\n\nThree things you cannot function without…\n\nSleep, food, air\n\nThat one phrase or line which describes you to the core is?\n\nWe are One.\n\nLifestyle symbolizes creativity and individuality with a blend of trends reflected in the designs. Meet Raheel and Zoya, the creative team and co-founders of Creo, a home accessories and living accents brand. Their passion for accessories stemmed from their motivation to renovate their own home\n\nBy Haider Rifaat\n\nWalk us through your journey.\n\nAfter starting our lives together, we wanted to create a space that was an expression of our personalities. That goal not only pushed us to look at options beyond what was available in the local accessories market, but it also forced us to consider ways to redo our space without a budget breaking overhaul. The result was stunning customized pieces for our home and the birth of Creo.\n\nHow did your creative talent translate into a full time profession?\n\nThe beginnings of Creo are humble and close to the heart. We always had an innate flare for interior and design but we realized our passion when we started our home improvement project.\n\nWhat accessories do you specialize in?\n\nCreo has a spectrum of home and lifestyle accessories. From unconventional hangings and floor planters, occasional tables, exquisite lamps to stunning serve ware and unique bookends, we offers a range of accessories and accents pieces.\n\nWhat are your professional roles as two creative people?\n\nThe design process is a shared responsibility. Raheel leads manufacturing and finance, while sales and marketing are my forte.\n\nWhat is your crafting process? What steps are involved in making luxury home accessories?\n\nOur creative process is very fluid. Sometimes a particular material will inspire a product, and in other cases, design options are discussed once we have determined what type of product we wish to create.\n\nAs a couple, how would you describe lifestyle?\n\nThere is a growing trend to try to fit into a mold, but we feel lifestyle should reflect your values and personality.\n\nWas your journey struggle free or a tough one?\n\nWhile our journey wasnâ€™t struggle free, we havenâ€™t faced a choice so difficult, a problem so substantial that we have not been able to overcome. In fact, our resolve to work hard only becomes stronger with each challenge.\n\nHow does your individual talent reflect in your designs? Is it a struggle for you both to land on the same page?\n\nWe share a similar aesthetic vision and our individual talents complement each other. We have mastered product form, proportions and the ability to merge them with functionality. We seldom find ourselves in a design deadlock.\n\nAs a couple, how do you regulate conflict of interest in a business?\n\nWe have faith in each otherâ€™s ideas and even when we disagree, we give each other the autonomy and space to experiment. Neither of us has regrets about being unable to try something we believed in.\n\nHow are affordability and luxury both an asset to your brandâ€™s philosophy? Do the terms not contradict each other?\n\nWe donâ€™t believe luxury and affordability are mutually exclusive. Luxury should not be associated with specific price points or exclusive access; instead it should be associated with particular characteristics or values, such as style, quality and finish.\n\nDo you find your designs exotic and far from the mainstream? Is that why you chose not to amalgamate yourselves with the local industry?\n\nWhile our products are bold and unique, they reflect the urban Pakistaniâ€™s burgeoning desire for a modern and luxe aesthetic.\n\nâ€œAs artists, we are the ambassadors of our country. It is our responsibility that we convey a positive message to the audiences and around world through our art, music and voiceâ€\n\nHow much work is required to create household and office items? Guide me through the process.\n\nThe design process is a bit unpredictable. Something that is seemingly easy to create may in fact takes much longer to develop on account of hurdles during execution.Â Some products will take days while others may take months to complete.\n\nWho do you cite as your influences?\n\nWe greatly admire the work of international designers such as Kelly Wearstler and Jonathan Adler for their adventurous flare. We have also been inspired by local arts and crafts and have developed ways to incorporate such art and artisanship into our accessories.\n\nAre people receptive to your business? Has it been positive or a mix of both?\n\nThe response has been overwhelming. Creo is lauded for offering sumptuous home accessories that deliver functionality at affordable price points.\n\nHow do you intend to take your business to the next level?\n\nWe want to introduce our products to customers all over Pakistan. To that end, we are planning a series of exhibitions in major cities early next year.\n\nActress Hira Mani, who stars in the acclaimed drama serial Mom Ka Dia, started out briefly hosting a morning show withÂ her husband, Mani. This charming and grounded young lady believes in believing and does not keep fake relationships with anyone she meets, be it for 2 minutes or 2 years. Hira reveals to Haider Rifaat what sheâ€™s really like as a person\n\nWho is Hira Mani? Â Â Â Â Â\n\nI am a free minded and relaxed person and I like starting conversations. Words such as lively, realistic, humble and down to earth describe me well. Pretense is a big NO for me.\n\nÂ I believe if God has created you, what is the point of pretense?\n\nI believe things are easy in life but you make them difficult for yourself. My kids are scared of me but they really like me for who I am. Every day, I play different roles in my life, as I play the character of a good wife.\n\nWhat was your last job prior to taking up acting as a full-fledged career?\n\nBefore stepping into the media industry, I designed clothes for my family and friends. It was more of a hobby but I never thought of choosing it as a career.\n\nHira’s excited about her next drama serial, the love story Aseeray Mohabbat, airing soon\n\nWhat are you known for the most: acting or hosting?\n\nPeople know me more for acting now. Mani and I started hosting a trendsetting show, and were cited â€œThe Pakistani Host Couple.â€ It is more of acting than hosting today.\n\nTell me about your married life. How did you and Mani meet?\n\nMani and I met just like an ordinary couple but we were destined to be together. After 11 years of our marriage, we love each other wholeheartedly and fulfill the duties of a married couple happily.\n\nSo far, how has your experience been filming the hit drama Dil Mom Ka Diya? Are there any other dramas you are working on?\n\nI play the character of Tamkinat in the acclaimed serial Dil Mom Ka Diya. It is the talk of the town, and I can relate to the character because it depicts how patience and sacrifices keep a family going. Another project that will be on air soon is the love story titled Aseeray Mohabbat, and I am anxiously waiting for it to come out.\n\nWhat kind of roles appeal to you the most? Which role do you want to do next?\n\nI want to do the girl-next-door character, someone who is lively and bubbly, as well as dark and meaningful roles.\n\nHow do you keep Hira Mani dissociated from the character she is playing?\n\nWhile I am playing a character, it does become difficult to stop living it when the camera is off. My kids often help to bring me back to reality.\n\nYou have mostly played characters that are victims. Will your fans get to see you portray a negative role?\n\nI am an actor and any role with solid content gets my attention. I donâ€™t really have dos and donâ€™ts as far as negative or positive roles are concerned.\n\nAre impactful characters seldom attributed to female actors?\n\nFemale actors usually get good roles, but only a few of them are impactful. We need writers to come up with good scripts for brilliant actors we have in our industry.\n\nIf offered a film, which actor would you like to work with?\n\nI would love to work with Nawazuddin Siddiqui. He is one powerful actor with tremendous talent.\n\nDoes screen fright get to you at times or is it something you have recovered from?\n\nI never have screen fright. I donâ€™t know why. Even in my earlier hosting days, I only kept one thing in mind â€” to maintain the respect of my family and myself.\n\nWhat have you learned about yourself and the world since you became a celebrity?\n\nI have learned a lot about myself since I started working in this industry. My husband has provided a great support system, which has brought me here today. He is the one who always believes in me and my work.\n\nâ€œMani and I started hosting a trendsetting show, and were cited â€˜The Pakistani Host Coupleâ€™â€\n\nWhat do you do when you are not working?\n\nI like spending time with my kids. We go on playdates, to the pool and make the most of our time.\n\nAre you a fashion girl?\n\nI donâ€™t follow fashion blindly. I have my own sense of style that works for me.\n\nWhat are some things in life that are a mystery to you?\n\nThe only mystery for me is how to provide a better lifestyle to all the orphans and needy children on a larger scale.\n\nAre you competitive? Do you thrive under pressure?\n\nWell, I donâ€™t think so. I am competitive but I donâ€™t take any pressure. I love my work and I try to give it my 100% and perform better than before.\n\nHow do you stay positive in negative situations?\n\nBy focusing on my blessings and knowing that things happen for a reason\n\nHow has your family helped you blossom in this industry?\n\nMy extended family, especially my spouse, have my back. Without their constant encouragement and support, I wouldnâ€™t have been able to last a day.\n\nDoes stardom create arrogant celebs?\n\nSadly, it is true. One should act responsibly and kindly.\n\nâ€œI would love to work with Nawazuddin Siddiquiâ€\n\nDo you enjoy a decent fan base?\n\nDefinitely! It keeps me motivated and makes me want to do even better.\n\nDoes social media draw unwanted attention?\n\nYes, it does! Today, our lives are programed in such a way that we are constantly on social media sharing our daily activities. We need to think outside of social media and enjoy life as it should be.\n\nIf you had the authority to rule the world, what would you like to see different?\n\nOnly if I could, I would want to eradicate child labour and hunger from the world. It is saddening to see the current state we are living in. Every needy child should be given the basic necessities of life.\n\nDo you think we are doing a good enough job to sustain water shortage? What are you doing to contribute your part?\n\nWe need to do so much collectively. Water shortage is one thing that will affect our planet like nothing else. I enforce conserving water through controlled usage while washing dishes or turning the tap off while we brush our teeth and getting domestic leakages fixed. It is about being aware in general to not waste water.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on mental health stigmas in Pakistan?\n\nMental health is the most neglected topic in Pakistan. We are constantly competing, our lives revolve around social media and we fail to accept us as we are. We need to come out of it, accept it, talk openly about mental health and help everyone around us.\n\nWhat advice would you give your younger self?\n\nThat I should have started acting earlier\n\nThe best word of advice you ever received.\n\nThere are no shortcuts. Hard work is the name of the game.\n\nPhotographs by\n\nRehan Mithani & Hasan Habib Hashmi"
