        "text": "Iqbal's Shikwa and Jawaab-e-Shikwa - Translated by Khushwant Singh\n\nWhy must I forever lose, forever forgo profit that is my due,\n\nSunk in the gloom of evenings past, no plans for the morrow pursue.\n\nWhy must I all attentive be to the nightingales lament,\n\nFriend, am I as dumb as a flower? Must I remain silent?\n\nMy theme makes me bold, makes my tongue more eloquent,\n\nDust fills my mouth, against Allah I make complaint.\n\nWe won renown for submitting to Your willand it is so;\n\nWe speak out now, we are compelled to repeat our tale of woe.\n\nWe are like the silent lute whose chords are full of voice;\n\nWhen grief wells up to our lips, we speak; we have no choice.\n\nLord God! We are Your faithful servants, for a while with us bear,\n\nIt is in our nature to always praise You, a small plaint also hear.\n\nThat Your Presence was primal from the beginning of time is true;\n\nThe rose also adorned the garden but of its fragrance no one knew.\n\nJustice is all we ask for. You are perfect, You are benevolent.\n\nIf there were no breeze, how could the rose have spread its scent?\n\nWe Your people were dispersed, no solace could we find,\n\nOr, would Your Beloveds following have gone out of its mind?\n\nBefore our time, a strange sight was the world You had made:\n\nSome worshipped stone idols, others bowed to trees and prayed.\n\nAccustomed to believing what they saw, the peoples vision wasnt free,\n\nHow then could anyone believe in a God he couldnt see?\n\nDo you know of anyone, Lord, who then took Your Name? I ask.\n\nIt was the muscle in the Muslims arms that did Your task.\n\nHere on this earth were settled the Seljuqs and the Turanians,\n\nThe Chinese lived in China, in Iran lived the Sassanians.\n\nThe Greeks flourished in their allotted regions,\n\nIn this very world lived the Jews and Christians.\n\nBut who did draw their swords in Your Name and fight?\n\nWhen things had gone wrong, who put them right?\n\nOf all the brave warriors, there were none but only we.\n\nWho fought Your battles on land and often on the sea.\n\nOur calls to prayer rang out from the churches of European lands\n\nAnd floated across Africas scorching desert sands.\n\nWe ruled the world, but regal glories our eyes disdained.\n\nUnder the shades of glittering sabres Your creed we proclaimed.\n\nAll we lived for was no battle; we bore the troubles that came,\n\nAnd laid down our lives for the glory of Your Name.\n\nWe never used our strength to conquer or extend domain,\n\nWould we have played with our lives for nothing but worldly gain?\n\nIf our people had run after earths goods and gold,\n\nNeed they have smashed idols, and not idols sold?\n\nOnce in the fray, firm we stood our ground, never did we yield,\n\nThe most lion-hearted of our foes reeled back and fled the field.\n\nThose who rose against You, against them we turned our ire,\n\nWhat cared we for their sabres? We fought against canon fire.\n\nOn every human heart the image of Your oneness we drew,\n\nBeneath the draggers point, we proclaimed Your message true.\n\nYou tell us who were they who pulled down the gates of Khyber?\n\nWho were they that reduced the city that was the pride of Caesar?\n\nFake gods that men had made, who did break and shatter?\n\nWho routed infidel armies and destroyed them with bloody slaughter?\n\nWho put out and made cold the sacred flame in Iran?\n\nWho retold the story of the one God, Yazdan?\n\nWho were the people who asked only for You and no other?\n\nAnd for You did fight battles and travails suffer?\n\nWhose world-conquering swords spread the might over one and all?\n\nWho stirred mankind with Allah-o-Akbars clarion call?\n\nWhose dread bent stone idols into fearful submission?\n\nThey fell on their faces confessing, God is One, the Only One!\n\nIn the midst of raging battle if the time came to pray,\n\nHejazis turned to Mecca, kissed the earth and ceased from fray.\n\nSultan and slave in single file stood side by side,\n\nThen no servant was nor master, nothing did them divide.\n\nBetween serf and lord, needy and rich, difference there was none.\n\nWhen they appeared in Your court, they came as equals and one.\n\nIn this banquet hall of time and space, from dawn to dusk we spent,\n\nFilled with the wine of faith, like goblets round we went.Over hills and plains we took Your message; this was our task.\n\nDo you know of an occasion we failed You? is all we ask.\n\nOver wastes and wildernesses of land and sea,\n\nInto the Atlantic Ocean we galloped on our steed.\n\nJawab-e-Shikwa (The answer to the complaint)\n\nTranslated by Khushwant Singh\n\nWords spoken from the heart never fail to have effect;\n\nSacred and pure their origin, on lofty heights their sights are set.\n\nThey have no wings and yet they have power to fly;\n\nThey rise from the dust and pierce through the sky.\n\nSo headstrong and insolent was my love, so much on mischief bent,\n\nSo outspoken my plaint, it tore through the firmament.\n\nThe aged vault of heaven heard. There is someone somewhere, said he.\n\nThe planets spoke, Here on these ancient heights someone must be.\n\nNot here, said the moon, it must be someone from the earth below.\n\nSpoke the Milky Way, It must be someone hidden here we do not know.\n\nOnly the gatekeeper of Eden did some of my plaint recognize\n\nAnd understood that I was the man thrown out of paradise.\n\nHe even rails against Allah, he has become so proud;\n\nIs he the same Adam before whom the angels bowed?\n\nHe knows about things, their quantity and quality;\n\nYes, these he knows, but nothing of the secret of humility.\n\nTheir power of speech men always proudly flaunt,\n\nBut of the way of the speaking they are quite ignorant.\n\nSpoke the Voice: Your tale is indeed full of sorrow;\n\nYour tears tremble at the brim and are ready to flow.\n\nYour cry of lament the sky has rung;\n\nWhat cunning your impassioned heart has lent your tongue!\n\nSo eloquently did you word your plaint, you made it sound like praise.\n\nTo talk on equal terms with Us, man to celestial heights did rise.\n\nLimitless is Our bounty, but none for it will pray.\n\nTheres no one on the seekers path; to whom do We point the way?\n\nNot one proved worthy of the care with which they were raised;\n\nYou are not the clay of which another Adam could be made.\n\nIf there were one deserving, Wed raise him to regal splendor,\n\nTo those who seek, We would unveil a new world of wonder.\n\nYou have no strength in your hands; in your hearts God has no place;\n\nOn the name of My messenger, you people have brought disgrace.\n\nDestroyers of false gods are gone; only the idol-maker thrives;\n\nThe sons of Abraham have departed, Azars idolatrous breed survives.\n\nStrange the company you keep; from new vats a new vintage wine you brew;\n\nYou have built yourselves a new Kaaba with new idols because you yourselves\n\nare new.\n\nThere were days when this very Allah you regarded as sublime;\n\nThe tulip of Islam was the pride of the desert in blossom time.\n\nThere were days when every Muslim loved the only Allah he knew;\n\nOnce upon a time He was your Beloved; the same Beloved you now call untrue.\n\nNow go and pledge your faith to serve some local deity\n\nAnd confine Muhammads following to some one locality.\n\nWho blotted out the smear of falsehood from the pages of history?\n\nWho freed mankind from the chains of slavery?\n\nThe floors of My Kaaba with whose foreheads swept?\n\nWho were they who clasped My Koran to their breasts?\n\nYour forefathers indeed they were: tell Us who are you, We pray?\n\nWith idle hands you sit awaiting the dawn of a better day.\n\nThe only people in the world of every skill bereft are you.\n\nThe only race which cares not how it fouls its nest are you.\n\nHaystacks that within them conceal the lightnings fires are you.\n\nWho love by selling tombs of their sires are you.\n\nIf as traders of tombstones you have earned such renown.\n\nWhat is there to stop you in trading in gods made of stone?\n\nHeavy weighs the light of dawn, how loathe you are to rise?\n\nWhy protest you love Us? It is your slumber that you prize.\n\nOn your carefree spirit Ramadans fast does heavily press;\n\nAsk yourselves and answer: Is this the way of faithfulness?\n\nA people are bound by faith; without faith they cease to be;\n\nIf nothing binds you, you are like meteors, not stars in a galaxy.\n\nYour mentors are immature: theres no substance in what they preach;\n\nNo lightning flashes enlighten their minds. Theres no fire in their speech.\n\nOnly a ritual the call to prayer; the spirit of Bilal has fled.\n\nTheres no end to philosophizing; Ghazzalis discourse remains unread.\n\nNow mourn the empty mosques. No worshippers fill them with prayer.\n\nThe likes of noble Hejazi gentlemen are no longer there.\n\nYou are one people, you share in common your weal and woe,\n\nYou have one faith, one creed and to one Prophet allegiance owe.\n\nYou have one sacred Kaaba, one God and one holy book, the Koran,\n\nWas it so difficult to unite in one community every single Mussalman?\n\nIt is factions at one place; divisions into castes at another,\n\nIn these times are these the ways to progress and to prosper?\n\nAll of you drink the wine of bodily indulgence, lead lives of ease without\n\nstrife.\n\nYou dare to call yourselves Muslims? Is this the Mussalmans way of life?\n\nYou take neither Alis pledge of poverty, nor Osmans path of wealth pursue;\n\nWhat kinship of the soul can there be between your ancestors and you?\n\nAs Muslims your forefathers were respected;\n\nYou gave up the Koran and are by the world rejected."
