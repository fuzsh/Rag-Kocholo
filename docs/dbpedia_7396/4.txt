(Zafar Hussain - Sydney, 29 June 2011)

Legendary female Urdu poetess Noshi Gilanis new book of poetry Hawa Chupke se Kehti Hai was published in Lahore last week by Mavra Publishers. Noshi Gilani is one of the most renowned and loved female Urdu poets of her generation with enviable readership. According to publishing sources in Lahore, the new book received such a warm response that its first edition was sold out within 2 hours of its arrival in Urdu Bazar. The book has created a great buzz and interest among Urdu literati and readers around the world as Noshi Gilanis last book was published back in 2003.

This is an exciting news and proud moment for local community and Urdu circles too as Noshi Gilani lives locally in Sydney. Noshi moved to Sydney in March 2009 after her marriage to Saeed Khan on October 25, 2008 in Bahawalpur. As most readers would remember, Sada-e-Watan was the first news paper in world to break the news of their marriage.

Local readers would feel a special connection with Hawa Chupkey se Kehti Hai as many of the ghazals and nazms included in the book were written in Australia.

The book is expected to reach Australia in July and inauguration ceremonies are anticipated in Sydney and across Australia over the coming months.

Sada-e-Watan would like to congratulate Noshi Gilani on publishing of her new book Hawa Chupke se Kehti Hai and wishes her every success.

The candour and frankness of her highly-charged poems is unusual for a woman writing in Urdu and she has gained a committed international audience, performing regularly at large poetry gatherings in Pakistan, Australia, Canada and the US. Unknown outside the Pakistani community, the translations here mark her introduction to an English-speaking audience.

Living through Diaspora has increased the complexity of her poems and reinforced her sense of female identity and introduced a new revolution against restraint creative writers in Pakistani society.

Poems

To catch butterflies...

This prisoner breathes

The breeze rewrites

Can someone bring me my entire being

I say nothing anywhere

The flower is torn at the heart
