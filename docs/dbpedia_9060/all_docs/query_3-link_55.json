        "text": "Plymouth, Massachusetts (November 29, 2023) -- Plimoth Patuxet Museums, the living history museum of 17th century colonial and Indigenous New England, announces that Mayflower II, its 66-year-old historic reproduction of the tall ship that brought the Pilgrims to the shores of Patuxet in 1620, is scheduled to depart Plymouth, Massachusetts on Thursday, November 30, for routine maintenance work at Mystic Seaport Museum’s Henry B. duPont Preservation Shipyard.\n\nAccompanied by Plimoth Patuxet’s Maritime Preservation and Operations team, the 106-foot ship will be under tow for this journey by Stasinos Marine. Once at Mystic Seaport, the ship will be moved into dry dock for “regular and routine maintenance such as some re-caulking of seams where necessary, cleaning and painting the bottom, painting the rest of the hull above the waterline, and other sprucing up and painting during the winter months,” said Mayflower II Captain, Whit Perry. The ship will return to Plymouth Harbor in mid-April, in time for Plimoth Patuxet Museums’ spring 2024 season.\n\nMayflower II will depart Plymouth for Mystic Seaport on Thursday, November 30, 2023, at approximately 10 a.m. The ship is expected to pass through Cape Cod Canal on Thursday, November 30 at approximately 12:30 p.m. She is expected to arrive at Mystic Seaport on Friday, December 1.\n\nThe ship’s travel schedule is entirely dependent on tide, weather conditions, and other factors, and therefore subject to change without notice.Track Mayflower II’s progress along her journey and look for updates on Plimoth Patuxet’s Facebook page.\n\nAbout Plimoth Patuxet\n\nPlimoth Patuxet is one of the Nation’s foremost living history museums. Founded in 1947, the Museum creates engaging experiences of history built on thorough research about the Indigenous and European people who met along Massachusetts' historic shores of change in the 1600s.

Major exhibits include the Historic Patuxet Homesite, the 17th-Century English Village, Mayflower II, and Plimoth Grist Mill. A private, 501(c)(3) not-for-profit educational institution, Plimoth Patuxet is supported by admission fees, donations, memberships, and revenue from a variety of educational programming, dining and gift shops.
