        "text": "MYSTIC, Conn.—They are getting ready to refloat the Charles W. Morgan.\n\nThe rugged, 113‐foot whaling ship is the sole survivor of the great New England whaling fleet of the mid‐19th century. She has been landlocked in a bed of sand since 1941, when she first came here to Mystic Seaport, the country's best ‐ known maritime museum.\n\nThe Morgan's rebirth, tentatively scheduled for next fall, will be the culmination of an extraordinary program of research and pioneering restoration work that has been under way since 1965.\n\n“What we have here,” said Waldo C. M. Johnston, director of the seaport, “is a whole new science: ship geriatrics.”\n\nThe Morgan, along with the Wavertree at the South Street Seaport in New York City, is one of the most famous vessels undergoing extensive restoration in this country. But the movement to preserve old ships and maritime artifacts is gaining momentum in seafarming nations around the world. In fact, the first international congress of maritime museums was held in London last fall.\n\nMystic Seaport is concerned with the entire maritime history of New England, and the Morgan is only one of its projects. But the three‐masted Morgan is the flagship of the Mystic fleet and there is no doubt that her restoration is the most important project now under way.\n\nTo date, the project has involved everything from painstaking studies of wood technology, including specificgravity tests of 200 borings from the 132‐year‐old ship's hull, to searches for specific timbers, such as hackmatack, a variety of larch, to be used for special braces in the ship's sides.\n\nConvincing the Farmers\n\n“Hackmatack was used by the original builders in 1841,” said J. Revell Carr, curator of the seaport, “and the whole idea of this restoration is to proceed exactly as the original builders did in the 19th century.”\n\nHackmatack, or tamarack, is used for braces between the hull and crosspieces because its roots extend from the trunk of the tree at almost a 90‐degree angle. Each tree provides a single brace or “knee,” fashioned by nature into a section of immense strength.\n\n“To find the trees—they're all in Maine—is one thing,” Mr. Carr said. “Convincing the farmers to let us have them is another.”\n\nThe Charles W. Morgan was built, almost two decades before the Civil War, at the yard of Jethro and Zechariah Hillman in New Bedford, Mass., then the whaling capital of the world. Mystic had whaling ships of its own, but was known mostly as a shipbuilding community then.\n\nIn her working life, of almost 80 years, the Charles W. Morgan made 36 voyages to the South Seas. She brought back 54,483 barrels of oil and 152,934 pounds of whalebone.\n\nThe ship was exhibited at Round Hill estate in Dartmouth, Mass., until the seaport here acquired her in 1941. Her present position is at a wharf at the seaport, where, from the distance, she appears to be afloat. At high tide, the waters of the Mystic River come up around the ship's sides and even flow into the hull to supplement the tons of the concrete block ballast that keep the Morgan settled solidly in the sand.\n\n“Floating her is a far more delicate operation than it may seem,” Waldo Johnston said. “After all, no one really has seen her bottom since 1941.” Mr. Johnston said he had two main considerations in mind in the course of floating the Morgan: “the safety of the vessel and the integrity of restoration.”\n\n“The easiest thing to do would be to fill her hold with cement and make it just a stationary platform for the upper decks and the rigging,” he said. “We thought hard about that possibility, believe me.”\n\nInstead, the seaport chose to keep the old vessel intact as a working ship. “We decided to save the life of the old girl to keep her alive and visible for future generations,” Mr. Johnston said.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Johnston said, the decision was made to do a complete restoration, in part because Mystic Seaport is uniquely equipped to tackle such a project.\n\nFull Shipbuilding Facilities\n\nAmong the facilities at the seaport, which is formally known as the. Marine. Historical Association, is a complete shipyard where a new Charles W. Morgan can be built from the keel up. The seaport has its own rigging loft, capable of rigging any major sailing vessel; its own sail loft, which can sew. a complete 13,000 squarefoot set of sails for the Morgan, and its own forges to fashion iron fittings. There is even a saw mill to cut ship's timbers from the seaport's own store of seasoned logs.\n\n“We want to preserve not only the vessels but also the tools, the skills, the expertise that originally were used to build them,” Mr. Johnson said. Some of Mystic's craftsmen, now in their 70's learned their ship‐building skills in the days of sail.\n\nOthers, younger men, left such careers as computer programing and teaching to become shipwrights.\n\n“You work nights and weekends here,” said Maynard Bray, the shipyard's youthful supervisor, “but there is a deep satisfaction to this kind of work. Not many people will ever again have a chance to experience it.”"
