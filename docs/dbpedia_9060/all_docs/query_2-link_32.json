        "text": "The Mystic Grove is one of the four Main Dungeons that can be visited, and is the first dungeon in the main quest available to be explored.\n\nA lush forest filled to the brim with strange creatures, the Mystic Grove is where you will complete your first major objective: Finding ironbark to build a small ship for your errand to Sage Asmodius in All Hands on Deck.\n\nThe Mystic Grove is also the location of your first side quest: Silencing the pestering goblin tribe in Trouble in the Woods.\n\nNative Creatures\n\n[]\n\nThe most striking feature of the Grove is the colourful creatures that call it home. The first beasts that you can encounter are simple, oversized bugs, wandering around their habitat and shielding themselves in thick carapace.\n\nOgrish goblins also share a home with the critters, with a centralised settlement constantly meddling with passers-by.\n\nThe Fey are strange, arcane critters native to the grove, being very fluent in manipulating the Aether. Their effigies will prove to be troublesome opponents with regeneration, and you will have to get through them if you want your precious ironbark.\n\nUnfortunately, many humans take advantage of the low security around the area, settling into illegal trades such as poaching and smuggling.\n\nFloor 1-12\n\n[]\n\nForest's Rim\n\nUpon your first steps into the Mystic Grove, expect to be faced with significant opposition straight from the getgo. While the enemies you can encounter here are not too dangerous, they are still very capable of killing a fresh character if you approach combat recklessly. Take the time to explore and learn about your opponents before you dive further.\n\nTier 1 Monsters Humans Beasts Ogroids Arcane Constructs Poacher Giant Bug Goblin Warrior Fey Watcher Straw Effigy Outlaw Aether Bug Goblin Tinker Fey Magus Thug\n\nFloor 13+\n\n[]\n\nFey Forest\n\nVenturing deeper into the mystical grove beyond, as you hit Floor 13, you will discover that the enchanted glade is not so welcoming of you. The fey presence has only strengthened, in addition to a higher diversity of creatures coming to hunt you down. Still, it is remarkably easier compared to other areas at this tier. All previous monsters will continue to appear as well.\n\nTier 2 Monsters Humans Beasts Ogroids Arcane Constructs Smuggler Fire Bug Goblin Marauder Fey Enchanter Soul Effigy Hedge Wizard Leech Bug Goblin Brute\n\nFloor 16+\n\n[]\n\nDepths of the Grove\n\nFrom this point onward, you will begin to notice the previous denizens of the Grove becoming stronger, as you venture deeper into the forest. Over time, their stats will gradually scale upward to better meet your own progression, preventing them from becoming easy pickings for you to stomp over.\n\nFrom this point onward, all monsters begin to scale stats, initially receiving +2 HP, +1 Attack Damage, +1 Armor, and +1 Spell Resistance, gradually growing as you delve deeper.\n\nBosses\n\n[]\n\nThe bosses of the Mystic Grove, while certainly the weakest out of their progeny in stats, are not to be messed with.\n\nThe first boss of the Mystic Grove can be encountered from character level 6 and floor 15: the Fey Avatar, the leader of all fey that guard the ironbark tree and the first true test of your combat capacity. Slaying it completes All Hands on Deck and unlocks the Low Harbor and Hollow Reef.\n\nThe second boss of the Mustic Grove can be encountered from character level 12 and floor 30: the duo of goblin leaders, Clink and Clank. A unique double fight against two supergoblins, your victory will drive the goblin encampments off and complete Trouble in the Woods.\n\nBosses File:Acc skullfetish.png Floor 15 File:Acc skullfetish.png Fey Avatar File:Acc skullfetish.png Floor 30 File:Acc skullfetish.png\n\nClink & Clank\n\nMinibosses\n\n[]\n\nAt any point in this dungeon, you may be presented with the rare and risky option of fighting a miniboss. They are more powerful compared to your average foe, and can output enough damage to seriously dent your run.\n\nMinibosses\n\nBrack 'o Lantern\n\nElder Bear\n\nSpirit of the Glade\n\nJournal Entries\n\nJournals of Sage Erideus\n\nPages 1-3 of the Journals of Sage Erideus can be found at floors 3, 8 and 13 of the Mystic Grove, obtained when you go over the dungeon exit even if it is locked.\n\nDungeon Floor 3\n\nJournal of Sage Erideus of the Sun Court, Southern Isles Expedition, 1245 IE, Entry 1\n\nI, Sage Erideus of the Sun Court, set these words to parchment in order to record events regarding my upcoming expedition to the Archipelago of the Southern Isles, on the behest of my old mentor and the headmaster of my order, Grand Sage Asmodius.\n\nJust the other day, Asmodius approached me with an interesting proposition: he claims to have made a pivotal discovery that could forever change the way we perceive and utilize magic. I must admit my skepticism at first - Asmodius having a sort of reputation for bold claims - but the nebulous story he told me that evening in the Sun Court's central library has piqued my interest for several reasons, and has been keeping me awake at nights ever since.\n\nFor one, it is closely related with one of my fields of research, which is, I presume, why the headmaster came to me in the first place. The field itself is not very popular among my colleague sages these days, but has been a hobby of mine ever since my adept days - I speak, of course, of the Mua-Ta, the infamous natives of the Isles, and their unusual approach to magic, which baffles scholars of the arcane across the Empire. But the hour grows late, and I shall not bore the reader with fine academic details of why that is at this point...More on the subject later.\n\nDungeon Floor 8\n\nJournal of Sage Erideus of the Sun Court, Southern Isles Expedition, 1245 IE, Entry 2\n\nBack to Asmodius' proposition: the headmaster has informed me that he has come into possession of an ancient Mua-Ta text, etched into an ironwood tablet, and brought to the Empire by an unsuspecting merchant from the Southern Isles. From what he could decipher, Asmodius found that it contains instructions for an arcane ritual, supposedly practiced by the Mua-Ta of old. The purpose of the ritual itself is irrelevant at this point, but the fine details of its implementation are...Interesting, to say the least.\n\nTo understand why, one must first understand the basic principles of arcane art: all magic that we know of originates from the Outside, or, more precisely speaking, the six Arcane Realms of Magic - Elemental Realms of Earth, Fire, Air and Water that provide the \"base ingredients\", so to say, and Abstract Realms of Order and Chaos that bind them together or break them apart. Channeled through the Great Aetherial Sea by a trained arcane practitioner, a mixture of the above mentioned realms' arcane essences forms what we commonly call a spell. Or that's what we've been taught to believe, at least...\n\nBut, not so with the ritual from the Mua-Ta Text! It circumvents all rules of arcane spellcasting, and taps into something entirely unknown...And, if the text is to be trusted, powerful beyond comprehension. Asmodius believes it to be the seventh Arcane Realm - the fabled origin place of all magic - which, until now, we thought to be but a myth. I'm not so assured myself, but i'm inclined to give his hypothesis a consideration, if only for the immense implications of it all...\n\nDungeon Floor 13\n\nJournal of Sage Erideus of the Sun Court, Southern Isles Expedition, 1245 IE, Entry 3\n\nAfter going through the ancient Mua-Ta text and translating it completely, carefully separating fact from fiction, I have concluded the matter should be thoroughly investigated. The text is incomplete, though, as if the key element of the ritual is missing...If the necessary knowledge can be recovered at all, there is no better place to start looking than the distant homeland of the Mua-Ta, and the place from which the text originated: the Archipelago of the Southern Isles.\n\nAsmodius was happy to see his theory supported, and has already peititioned the Emperor to fund an expedition to the southern colonies. I am to be its leader, as the foremost expert on the subject of the Mua-Ta language and civilization. We plan to set out as soon as we get the Emperor's funding, and agree on others who are to accompany me - the matter should be treated with discretion, though, as its implications are indeed huge, and could cause quite an uproar with the more orthodox minds at the Sun Court.\n\nIn the meantime, Asmodius is gathering a team of like-minded sages to conduct experiments based on the incomplete text. He's started calling it \"Project Heaven's Gate\" - a bit pompous for my taste, but that's Asmodius for you. They've already made some progress, but the results, as promising as they are, are still miles away from the ritual's full potential, as described by the ancient Mua-Ta...\n\nMua-Ta Memory Stones\n\nThe first two Memory Stones can be found on floors 7 and 17 of the Mystic Grove."
