        "text": "Trip Report\n\nMystic Beach, Juan de Fuca Trail BC â€” Tuesday, Mar. 19, 2024\n\nType of Hike\n\nDay hike\n\nTrail Conditions\n\nMinor obstacles posing few problems\n\nRoad\n\nRoad suitable for all vehicles\n\nBugs\n\nBugs were not too bad\n\nSnow\n\nSnow free\n\nBottom Line:\n\nEarly morning hike on the Canadian side of the Strait of Juan de Fuca west of Victoria and across from Callam Bay WA; \"Mystic Beach\" lives up to its name with fog and filtered sunshine framing its famous waterfall; low water level in the waterfall, but spectacular nonetheless; visiting near high tide has the waterfall dropping directly into the ocean; BEAUTIFUL! A longer nearby gem is the East Sooke Trail.\n\nStats:\n\nDistance: 4-1/4 miles\n\nDuration: 2-1/4 hours\n\nVertical: 725 feet\n\nRoad/Parking: Parking is at the China Beach trailhead with a very large parking lot (the 1st lot on the right being for Mystic Beach); no parking pass required; toilets available; took the Black Ball ferry from Port Angeles to Victoria, and then it is about a 75 min drive to the trailhead; Hwy 14 is quite bumpy after Jordan River (prime surfing spot)\n\nWeather: Sunshine with patchy fog becoming mostly sunny; 50Fs; no wind; calm ocean with variable swell; CAUTION: the shoreline is cliffs and caves, and larger swells can leave one without an escape route\n\nTrail: The trail is somewhat rough, and had plenty of down trees and mud; there are orange tree markers, but we still lost the trail for a bit as you can see from the map below (but saw the other waterfall in the pic below as a result - bonus!); the suspension bridge is fun and spectacular; the descent to the beach has plenty of boardwalks and steps that are not in the best of condition (slippery!); the trailhead is one of many along the ~30-mile Juan de Fuca trail, and a popular entry point for thru hikers; CAUTION: it is really important to pay attention to tides as the beach is cliff/cave bound and one can easily become trapped at high tide; I was alone at the beach for a time enjoying the eagles that flew especially low due to the fog, but others quickly arrived as the sun broke out in earnest (spring break north of the border!)\n\nTakeaway: Even near high tide, the beach was beautiful - waterfalls, cliffs, caves, sculpted rock, and nice sand. Would like to return at low tide for a completely different experience! In the early summer, kids enjoy running through the waterfall, especially when it has more water :)\n\nThe attached short 4K video focuses mainly on the caves and waterfalls :) I probably got a little photo happy with the waterfall, but the light kept changing its character! Most of the shots are extended exposures, smoothing out the surf, where there were definitely some large swells (don't want to turn your back to the ocean)\n\nDid you find this trip report helpful?\n\n16"
