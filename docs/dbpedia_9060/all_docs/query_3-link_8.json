        "text": "Good vibes happen on the tides! Tide Clocks were designed by a fisherman nearly 40 years ago to show the time between the tides. The moon is the major cause of the tides with the lunar day of 24 hours and 50 minutes. Most East Coast locations have two high tides and two low tides each day. Therefore, the hand on our clocks rotates every 12 hours and 25 minutes, twice each lunar day. It is best to set the tide hand at high tide during a full or new moon.\n\nWhether you lean more toward Coastal Casual or a Modern Seaside Retreat, our Mystic Connecticut Tide Clocks fit every coastal style. Each Wood Map Tide Clock is offered in 5 accent options and two water colors.\n\nThe signature look of Sea & Soul Nautical Chart Art is produced with a creative use of new technology combined with time-honored techniques. All our products are completely and proudly made in the USA.\n\nPRODUCT DETAILS:\n\nSize: 16” Diameter\n\nMade of Baltic Birch\n\nAvailable in Deep Blue or Blue Green Water Stain\n\nAccent Ring available in all Birch, Driftwood Gray, Warm Americana or Sun Bleached Blue\n\nWater with laser engraved depth contours is recessed one level below the shoreline.\n\nShips fully assembled and ready to hang.\n\nQuartz mechanism operates on one AA battery, not included.\n\nWe do not offer tide clocks for use on the West Coast or Gulf of Mexico. Those tides are too irregular for a quartz tide clock to work properly."
