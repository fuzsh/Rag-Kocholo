Savage (Strophes 1, 3, and 4)\n\nO star of Truth, down shining\n\nThrough clouds of doubt and fear,\n\nI ask but 'neath Thy guidance\n\nMy pathway may appear.\n\nHowever long the journey,\n\nHow hard so e'er it be,\n\nThough I be lone and weary,\n\nLead on, I'll follow Thee!\n\nThe bleeding feet of martyrs\n\nThe toilsome road have trod;\n\nBut fires of human passion\n\nMay light the way to God.\n\nThen, though my feet should falter,\n\nWhile I Thy beams can see,\n\nThough I be lone and weary,\n\nLead on, I'll follow Thee!\n\nThough loving friends forsake me\n\nOr plead with me in tears;\n\nThough angry foes may threaten,\n\nTo shake my soul with fears;\n\nStill to my high allegiance\n\nI must not faithless be:\n\nThrough life or death forever\n\nLead on, I'll follow Thee!\n\nTHERE IS A MYSTIC TIE THAT JOINS\n\nSung in English\n\nUnion Hymnal 1914\n\nWords: Max Meyerhardt\n\nThere is a mystic tie that joins\n\nThe children of the martyr-race,\n\nIn bonds of sympathy and love\n\nThat time and change cannot efface.\n\nE'en though today the Jews do dwell\n\nIn every clime and every land,\n\nYet, joined by that immortal tie,\n\nA holy brotherhood they stand.\n\nFor still in reverent tones is heard\n\nThe sacred cry, always the same,\n\n'O Israel, hear, our God is One,\n\nBlest be for aye His holy name!\"\n\nThis is the mystic tie that joins\n\nThe children of the ancient race;\n\nThis is the grand and holy bond\n\nThat time and change cannot efface.\n\nTO THEE WE GIVE OURSELVES\n\nSung in English\n\nUnion Hymnal 1914\n\nWords: Gustav Gottheil\n\nTo Thee we give ourselves today;\n\nForgetful of the world outside,\n\nWe tarry in Thy house, O God,\n\nFrom eventide to eventide.\n\nFrom Thine all-searching righteous eye\n\nOur deepest heart can nothing hide;\n\nIt crieth out for Thee, for peace,\n\nFrom eventide to eventide.\n\nWho could endure, shouldst Thou, O God,\n\nAs we deserve, forever chide;\n\nWe therefore see Thy pardoning\n\nFrom eventide to eventide.\n\nO may we lay to heart how swift\n\nThe years of life do onward glide;\n\nAnd learn to live that we may see\n\nThy light at our own eventide.\n\nBEHOLD IT IS THE SPRINGTIDE OF THE YEAR\n\nSung in English\n\nUnion Hymnal 1914\n\nWords: Alice Lucas (Strophes 1, 2, and 4)\n\nBehold, it is the springtide of the year!\n\nOver and past is winters gloomy reign,\n\nThe happy time of singing birds is near,\n\nAnd clad in bud and blooms are hill and plain.\n\nAnd in the spring, when all the earth and sky\n\nRejoice together, still from age to age\n\nRings out the solemn chant of days gone by,\n\nProclaiming Israel's sacred heritage."
