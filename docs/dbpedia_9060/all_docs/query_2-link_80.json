        "text": "For any questions not addressed here, please call the Membership Office at (562) 437-3474 (FISH).\n\nBECOMING A MEMBER AND RENEWING YOUR MEMBERSHIP\n\nWhy should I join or renew as a member of the Aquarium?\n\nMembers receive unlimited general admission, which means every day is free, and you can visit as often as you like! You will also receive exclusive discounts and offers, invitations to members-only events, 50 percent off parking with pre-paid parking vouchers, and so much more. Take a look at our member levels and benefits to find out which membership level is best for you.\n\nWhen does my membership start?\n\nYour membership becomes active on the date of purchase and is valid for one year from this purchase date.\n\nDo you have a membership for grandparents?\n\nYes! Grandparents may purchase a Family-level membership, which will allow you to bring your grandchildren (age 17 and under) on each visit.\n\nI purchased my membership online. When do I receive my materials?\n\nIf you purchased your membership online, you should receive an acknowledgement e-mail a few minutes after completing your purchase. You will receive your membership card(s) at Member Services during your first visit.\n\nI purchased my membership over the phone or through the mail. When do I receive my materials?\n\nIf you purchased your membership over the phone or through the mail, please allow two to three weeks to receive your materials via mail. Your membership card(s) will be issued at Member Services during your first visit.\n\nWhen does my membership expire?\n\nYour membership expires 12 months from the original purchase date. If you don’t remember your expiration date, you may ask an associate at any ticket counter or call the Membership Office at (562) 437-3474.\n\nWhat happens if I renew before my membership expires?\n\nAn additional 12 months will be added to your expiration date. For example, if you renew in February but your membership expires in June, then we’ll add 12 months to your expiration date and your membership will expire in June of the following year. This means you don’t “lose” any months from your membership.\n\nWhat happens if I renew after my membership has expired?\n\nYour membership will have a new expiration date, which will be 12 months from the date you renewed your membership. For example, if your membership expired in June but you renew two months later in August, then your new membership expiration date will now be in August of the following year.\n\nCan I still use my old membership card(s) if I renewed after my expiration date?\n\nYes, your membership card(s) will automatically be updated with your new expiration date when you renew.\n\n↑ Back to Top\n\nMEMBERSHIP CARD\n\nWhen do I receive my membership card?\n\nYour membership card will be issued on site at Member Services during your first visit as a member.\n\nWhat happens if I lose or forget my membership card?\n\nIf you forgot your membership card, please bring a photo ID to the Aquarium and we can check you in at the Membership Desk.

Download the Aquarium Visitor Guide Mobile App, go to the “Members” category, and input your membership number or scan your membership card’s barcode. All member cardholders will still need to take their picture at Member Services during their first visit.\n\n↑ Back to Top\n\nTRANSFERABLE MEMBER CARD\n\nIs my membership transferable? Can I change the second adult on my membership?\n\nYour annual membership is non-transferable. As a result, we cannot change the second adult on your membership. If you would like a transferable card, please consider upgrading to our Plus membership (or higher) so that you will receive a transferable card as part of your benefits.\n\nWhat is a transferable member card?\n\nA transferable card allows you to bring one additional guest and may only be used once per day. The cost for a replacement transferable card is $35.\n\nDo I need to be present for my guest to use the transferable member card?\n\nYou do not need to be present for your guest to use the transferable card. Many of our members give the transferable card to their babysitter, nanny, or grandparent so they may enjoy the Aquarium with the children. Your guest should still bring your membership card to check-in any children under your membership.\n\nWhat happens if I lose or forget my transferable membership card?\n\nIf you lose your transferable membership card, it will cost $35 to reissue the card at Member Services. If you forgot your transferable membership card, you must purchase a ticket for your guest. The good news is that all members receive 20 percent off guest admission tickets.\n\n↑ Back to Top\n\nVISITING THE AQUARIUM\n\nDo you have any blackout dates?

This includes the restroom located outside the Aquarium near the Member’s Express Entrance. The women’s restroom on the first floor near the head of the blue whale has a mommy lounge with a couch and an activity area for toddlers.\n\nWhat are rubbing tiles?\n\nRubbing tiles are tiles that have imprinted designs of different animals located throughout the Great Hall. We invite our members to see if you can find all of the rubbing tiles; Member Services has paper and crayons available for you to use.\n\n↑ Back to Top\n\nGIFT MEMBERSHIPS\n\nHow do I purchase a membership as a gift for someone?\n\nYou may purchase a gift membership online, on site, over the phone, or through the mail. Before starting the purchase process, it is helpful to have the name and contact information of the person who will be receiving the membership. Please note: All gift membership materials are sent to the purchaser unless a special request is made on the date of purchase by calling (562) 437-3474.\n\nWhen does the gift membership start?\n\nIf the gift membership is purchased online, the gift membership must be redeemed within one year from the purchase date.

When will I receive them?\n\nIf you purchased your membership online, your guest tickets will be at the Membership Desk within 24 hours of purchase. If you purchased your membership over the phone or through the mail, you will receive your guest tickets in the mail within two to three weeks. Please note: Some membership levels do not receive guest tickets.\n\nI haven’t received my complimentary guest tickets in the mail, but I want to use them today. What should I do?\n\nPlease call us at (562) 437-3474 to discuss your specific situation.\n\nWhen do my complimentary guest tickets expire?\n\nYour complimentary guest tickets are valid for one year from the date that you purchased your membership.

What is the cost?\n\nYes, we offer our members three pre-paid parking vouchers at a discounted rate of $12 (at the regular price, three parking tickets would cost $24). Member parking vouchers are good for one year from the date of purchase.\n\nWhat are member parking vouchers?\n\nPlease see question above.\n\nHow can I purchase the member parking vouchers?\n\nMember parking vouchers are available for purchase on site, over the phone, or through the mail. Unfortunately, we do not have an online option to purchase pre-paid parking vouchers.\n\nWhen will I receive my member parking vouchers?\n\nMember parking vouchers purchased over the phone or through the mail will be mailed to you within two to three weeks of the payment processing date.\n\nHow do I use the member parking vouchers?\n\nWhen you enter the structure you will be issued a white parking ticket from the machine at the entrance. Insert your white parking ticket from the parking structure at the kiosk (located on the first and second floors), and then scan your pre-paid parking voucher (each one has a barcode printed on it). This will validate your white parking ticket. When leaving the parking structure, you will insert your white parking ticket at the gate to exit.\n\nI lost my member parking voucher. Can it be reissued?\n\nUnfortunately, we are unable to reissue member parking vouchers. The parking structure is owned and operated by a third party, so the Aquarium has no way of tracking whether or not a parking voucher is used. We recommend treating your member parking vouchers as if they are cash and keeping them in a safe place.\n\nI decided not to purchase member parking vouchers. What should I do?\n\nPlease be sure to get a validation scan for your parking ticket for the discounted $8 Aquarium daily rate. There are validation scanners at the Aquarium Map podium and near the Aquarium exit.\n\n↑ Back to Top\n\nMISC MEMBER QUESTIONS\n\nHow do I update my contact information on my membership?\n\nPlease call us at (562) 437-3474, or send an e-mail to memberservices@lbaop.org to update your contact information.\n\nI recently moved. How do I change the address on my membership?\n\nPlease see the question above.\n\nWhat does it mean to go paperless?\n\nGoing paperless means that you are electing to receive all your membership materials and communication via e-mail.\n\nHow do I go paperless?\n\nPlease call us at (562) 437-3474, or send an e-mail to memberservices@lbaop.org to go paperless.\n\nDo I have to give my email for my membership?\n\nEmail is optional for members; however, you will miss out on member benefits that are often sent via email.
