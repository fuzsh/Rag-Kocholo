        "text": "Tim Binder\n\nSenior Vice President of Animal Care and Health\n\nTim Binder is the senior vice president of animal care and health; overseeing all aspect of The Florida Aquarium’s world-class animal care including a large team of biologists and veterinarians. With the symbiotic relationship between animal care and operations, Tim also administers Engineering, Water Quality lab and Dive Safety Operations.\n\nDespite growing up far from the oceanic world in Rapid City, South Dakota, Tim has been a respected leader in animal welfare, husbandry and conservation for over 40 years. He has led world renowned organizations, pioneered new animal care practices and much more through outstanding leadership, depth of experience and strategic vision.\n\nIn high school, Tim worked at a roadside attraction on the road to Mount Rushmore. This small aquarium cared for seals, sea lions and dolphins. That experience sparked his passion and led to a distinguished 40+ year career in animal care that continues to make an impact in the zoo and aquarium world today.\n\nIn his early 20s, Tim joined the staff of the highly regarded Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut, where his skills earned him a senior leadership position. After a long tenure at Mystic, Tim became one of the first people hired by the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta. At the time of its opening in 2005, it was the largest aquarium in the world. Among his most notable accomplishments was ensuring the welfare of the whale sharks; making Georgia the only facility outside Asia where you can see these animals.\n\nIn 2008, he left Georgia to consult on various projects to improve care and welfare practices in the US, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Central and South America. A year later, he joined Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium to become executive vice president of animal care. There he formalized and expanded the animal rescue and rehabilitation program; calling on his 16 years of experience in stranded marine mammal rehabilitation of numerous seal and cetacean species in southern New England.\n\nAmong Tim’s most notable accomplishments is the key role he served in developing and implementing animal handling procedures and protocols to do health assessments – over a multiyear period – on free ranging beluga whales in a remote area of southwest Alaska.\n\nWith his steep tradition and deep passion for conservation, attracted by the Aquarium’s vital efforts, Tim joined The Florida Aquarium in 2018, citing the tremendous opportunities to have a direct impact on significant conservation issues in very unique and exciting ways.\n\nDuring his tenure in the zoo and aquarium sector, Tim has served in leadership and advisory roles for a variety of industry organizations and committees. A member of the American Humane Association’s Scientific Advisory Committee, Tim helped develop the association’s humane conservation certification program that certifies humane treatment of animals in human care at zoological facilities. As a member of the Association of Zoos and Aquarium (AZA) task force, he worked collaboratively for the development animal welfare standards for cetaceans in AZA accredited facilities. He has also served on the AZA’s Honors & Awards and Annual Conference Program committees.\n\nDebborah Luke, Ph.D.\n\nSenior Vice President of Conservation\n\nDr. Debborah Luke serves as The Florida Aquarium’s senior vice president of conservation and is an internationally recognized leader with more than 25 years of marine and environmental conservation leadership experience. Utilizing a science-based, impact-driven\n\napproach, she ensures that conservation is infused throughout the Aquarium, from messaging, to sustainable business practices, to science, to action. She manages the Aquarium’s local, regional and international portfolio of conservation that strategically focuses on conservation initiatives that advance the Aquarium’s conservation priorities, amplify its expertise, leverage and promote partnerships and maximize its ability to serve as Florida’s leading conservation-based aquarium.\n\nPreviously, Dr. Luke served as senior vice president of conservation and science for nearly a decade at the Association of Zoos & Aquariums (AZA). She successful launched the field conservation programs that supported SAFE, AZA’s premier Saving Animals From Extinction program. In addition, Dr. Luke intimately understands the workings of an aquarium, having served as the director of education & research at Sea Life Park in Hawaii, and as the director of manatee care & research (along with other various roles) during 10 years at Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium.\n\nDr. Luke is no stranger to Tampa, having earned both her Doctorate and Master’s degrees in cognitive neuroscience and marine science from the University of South Florida and an undergraduate degree in psychology from New College in Sarasota.\n\nKeri O’Neil\n\nDirector & Senior Scientist, Coral Conservation Program\n\nAn interest in coral reefs that began for Keri O’Neil during childhood snorkeling trips to Florida led her to The Florida Aquarium and groundbreaking work in coral conservation.\n\nAs director and senior scientist, coral conservation program at The Florida Aquarium’s Apollo Beach, FL campus, Keri oversees the daily care of corals rescued from the spread of Stony Coral Tissue Loss disease in Florida. She also oversees the Aquarium’s induced spawning lab – the site of the world’s first induced spawn of the threatened pillar coral in a laboratory setting. She and her team at The Florida Aquarium have spawned and raised 10 species of coral native to Florida and have worked with partners to outplant thousands of coral recruits onto Florida’s Coral Reef. While continuing to work to induce spawning of new coral species, Keri is dedicated to improving the process of coral spawning and rearing with the goal of efficiency, reliability and widespread dissemination of the techniques.\n\nKeri earned her B.S. in biology from the University of Maryland, where she began studying corals. After college, she spent nearly a decade at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, MD. She went on to pursue her Master’s Degree in marine biology and environmental science in 2009 at Nova Southeastern University, where she raised corals for reef restoration projects on the east coast of Florida.\n\nStephen Schwanebeck\n\nManager of Horticulture, Landscaping & Grounds\n\nStephen Schwanebeck is The Florida Aquarium’s senior horticulturist, caring for a vast collection of Florida native species found in and around the Aquarium; most notably the mangroves and large native trees within the wetlands dome. Stephen is helping to create a world-class conservation site at the Aquarium’s Apollo Beach campus with habitat restoration and more.\n\nStephen has been a nature enthusiast his entire life. As a Tampa native, he attended every zoo camp possible at Busch Gardens. Making a strong impression, he was hired for a work-study program at Busch Gardens at just 14 years of age. His career continued as a stage manager and production assistant with the Anheuser-Busch Co. while simultaneously touring with Sigfried & Roy Productions. In 1998 while attending Valencia College and working as a Disney ambassador during the 25th anniversary celebration, Stephen was invited to join the opening team of Disney’s Animal Kingdom.\n\nStephen initially joined The Florida Aquarium in 2015 as a member of the Learning Department. His extensive knowledge gained the immediate attention of the long-tenured and original horticulturist, and he was quickly recruited. Less than a year later, following his mentor’s retirement, Stephen was promoted.\n\nStephen proudly continues his passion for conservation and enthusiasm for the world of plants. He can be found inside the wetlands dome and around campus meticulously caring for the Aquarium’s trees and plants. He is tireless in his efforts to positively impact the environment and inspire future generations, taking a contributing role in habitat restoration and educational/volunteer programs of The Florida Aquarium."
