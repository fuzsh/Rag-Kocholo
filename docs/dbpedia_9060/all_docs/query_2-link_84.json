        "text": "Those who stay at the Inn at Mystic will find a sublime experience no matter what time of year they choose to come. The summertime provides guests with the opportunity to canoe straight from the Pequotseptos River dock, explore the English-style gardens, or get some sun at Ocean Beach Park. The fall is a time for taking in the autumn foliage in the surrounding wooded area, while the winter is a time for settling down in front of one of the cozy guest room fireplaces. The spring brings out the lovely cherry blossoms and sees the return of the colorful spring warblers from their southern migration. The inn delights its guests during every season, and has been doing so since it first opened its doors in 1963, continuing a family tradition started in Maine in 1944. The inn’s many pleasures are so well known that over half of its guests are either returnees or referrals. Now, this exceptional and successful operation has arrived on the market.\n\nThe serene grounds occupy more than 15 acres, encompassing a charming pond, tennis court, swimming pool, and large bluestone patios with sweeping views out to Mystic Harbor and Fisher’s Island Sound. The acreage comprises six contiguous lots, with a total of 9.41 acres zoned RH-10 and 5.86 acres zoned LS-5. On the grounds stand a series of buildings offering deluxe accommodations, including a main building, historic and classic Colonial Revival known as the Haley Mansion and overlooking the orchards, luxurious East Wing with harbor and Sound views, and secluded Gate House just for two. In total, the buildings have 45,211 interior square feet and 67 rooms designed in the turn-of-the-century style. The Inn at Mystic also comes complete with the well-regarded Flood Tide Restaurant, with its elegant cuisine, space for large-scale gatherings and breathtaking high vantage point views. The inn has become a highly popular wedding destination as well, providing an ideal environment with its fine decor, top-notch dining and superb grounds.\n\nLocated at 7 Williams Avenue in downtown Mystic, this property offers close proximity to all of the amenities for which the area is known, including Mystic Aquarium, Mystic Seaport, Stonington Borough and nearby casinos. The new owner will discover that the inn presents myriad opportunities for further development, whether growing the current operations or creating RH-10 zone residential housing or a senior living facility. The Inn at Mystic is truly a rare New England opportunity, and is now available for $8,500,000 with William Pitt Sotheby’s International Realty.\n\nTo schedule a private viewing, please contact Colette Harron at +1 860 304-2391 or Rick Weiner at +1 860 227-3191."
