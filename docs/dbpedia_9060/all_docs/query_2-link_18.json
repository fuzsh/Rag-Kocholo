        "text": "\"We therefore recommend that the incoming Imperial Potentate be requested to appoint a Committee of three members of the Imperial Council, and that he instruct said Committee to prepare a concise history of the Ancient Arabic Order from which our Order emanates, and to add thereto a short history of the Imperial Council from date of its inception up to the year 1915, and to present the same in manuscript form to the Imperial Council at its next Annual Session for its consideration.\n\n\"We further recommend that such expenses of the Committee as may be approved by the Imperial Potentate shall be paid from the Imperial Council funds, but that the compensation for services rendered by the Committee, or any one else, in the compilation of the historical matter shall be fixed by the Imperial Council.\"\n\nSee Printed Proceedings, 1914, Page 215.\n\nAlmost without exception, the origin and early history of any order, and more particularly the history of any secret\n\norganization, becomes shrouded in the mists of uncertainty as time progresses. The founders drop from the ranks, facts\n\nbecome contaminated by fiction, and fiction in turn is elab­orated into myth. It is not my purpose to enter into or to seek to excite controversy, but to present these extracts from the Minute Book and Records of Mecca Temple for the study of those interested in the subject. These records are all intact, and form part of the Archives of Mecca Temple.\n\nPerhaps it will he well first to establish the Masonic stand-\n\n(4) The following is from the minute-book of Aurora Grata Lodge of Perfection:\n\n\"At a special communication of Aurora Grata Lodge of Perfection held at their rooms, Halsey's Building, on Tuesday evening, April 16, '67, Ill. Bro. C. T. McClenachan 33° proposed Bro. W. J. Florence, Age 40, Occupation, Actor; Residence, Metropolitan Hotel. Refers to Ill. Bro. Mc­Clenachan and Ill. Chas. Brown, M.D., which was on motion received and referred to Ill. Bros. Willets, Smith, and McCienachan for investigation, who immediately reported favorably and recommended his election. The T. P. G. M. then ordered a ballot and Bro. Florence was declared duly elected. Bro. F. being about to depart for Europe, and wishing to receive the degrees of the A, & A. Rite, permission was given Ill. Bro. McClenachan to confer the degrees upon him as soon as convenient and wherever his judgment might dictate.\n\nD. G. SMITH, G. S. K. S. A.\n\n\"Acting upon above authority Bro. McClenachan con­ferred upon Bro. W. J. Florence the degrees from 4th to 14th inclusive at Metropolitan Hotel on 21st April, '67, in presence of and assisted by Ill. Bro. Wilson Small 33°, A. T. C. Pierson 33° S. J., Ill. Gabriel McGowan 33° of the S. J., Chas. Brown, M. D., 32°, Thos. J. Leigh 32°, and D. G. Smith 32°, Secretary of Aurora Grata Lodge of Perfection.\n\nD. G. SMITH, G. S. K. S. A.\"\n\nIn the Consistory minute-book the Secretary makes a similar entry, stating there also that Florence received the degrees from the Fourth to the Fourteenth, inclusive. The Secretary is evidently in error in the Consistory record for every­thing else indicated the conferring upon Florence of the degrees up to the Thirty-second. For example, in the Consistory record of April 30, 1867, there appears in the list of receipts for the night, \"W. J. Florence, $55.00 for degrees.\" By joint resolution of October 30, 1866, it had been provided that \"When a person applies for the degrees of Perfection the application shall be accompanied with a petition for the degrees in the Council, Chapter, and Consistory, together with the fees for the same.\" The same joint resolution provided that, \"the initiation fee of $55.00 shall include all the degrees, payable to the Treasurer, who shall apportion the amount among the several bodies.\"\n\nThe Secretary had himself received the degrees by com­munication but two months earlier, and had served as secretary at only one communication preceding this Special. He may be excused, therefore, this slight slip in the record.\n\n3\n\n42 HISTORY OF THE IMPERIAL COUNCIL\n\nof the proposed organization, and the part that each was to play therein.\n\nIt does not seem important to mention the details of the preliminary organization, but it is sufficient to say that Noble Fleming called the meeting to order and presided over its de‑\n\nliberations. The organization was effected by the election of the following officers, all of whom were elected for a term of three years:\n\nMost Illustrious Walter M. Fleming, New York, Grand Potentate.\n\nVery Illustrious George F. Loder, Rochester, N. Y., Deputy Grand Potentate.\n\nIllustrious Philip F. Lenhart, Brooklyn, N. Y., Grand Chief Rabban.\n\nIllustrious William H. Whiting, Rochester, N. Y., High Priest and Prophet.\n\nIllustrious Samuel R. Carter, Rochester, N. Y., Oriental Guide.\n\nIllustrious Aaron L. Northrup, New York, Grand Treasurer.\n\nIllustrious William S. Paterson, New York, Grand Recorder.\n\nIllustrious Albert P. Moriarty, New York, Grand Financial Secretary.\n\nIllustrious John L. Stettinius, Cincinnati, Ohio, Grand First Ceremonial Master.\n\nIllustrious Benson Sherwood, New York,\n\nGrand Second Ceremonial Master.\n\nIllustrious Samuel Harper, Pittsburgh, Pa., Grand Marshal.\n\nIllustrious Frank Bascom, Montpelier, Vt., Grand Captain of the Guard.\n\nIllustrious George Scott, Patterson, N. J., Grand Outer Guard.\n\nOf the foregoing officers-elect, Nobles Lenhart, Whiting, Moriarty, Stettinius, Sherwood, Harper, and Bascom were not present at- the organization. The other officers-elect were in­stalled into office by Noble Charles T. McClenachan, and The Imperial Grand Council was proclaimed duty organized.\n\nA resolution was adopted fixing New York as the Grand\n\nOrient of The Imperial Grand Council. Nobles Charles T. McClenachan, Edward M. L. Ehlers, and J. H. Hobart Ward were appointed a Committee to draft Statutes and Regulations\n\n\"We most respectfully report and recommend that Charters be granted to the following Temples, at present under Dispensation :\n\nAbdallah Temple of Leavenworth, Kansas. Acca Temple of Richmond, Va.\n\nIsis Temple of Salina, Kansas.\n\nOsiris Temple of Wheeling, W. Va.\n\n\"We would further recommend that\n\nJerusalem Temple, New Orleans, La.,\n\nRameses Temple, Toronto, Canada,\n\nHella Temple, Dallas, Texas,\n\nBallut Abyad Temple, Albuquerque, New Mexico,\n\nbe continued under Dispensation for another year.\n\n\"We would further recommend that no Charter be granted to Saltanat Temple of London, Ontario, and that their Dispensation be recalled.\n\n\"And WHEREAS, Your Committee has received from the Imperial Potentate a Petition from Nobles residing in Brooklyn, Long Island, asking that necessary permission be granted to organize and establish a Temple in their city, we therefore would respectfully recommend that a Charter be granted.\"\n\nOn motion, the report was received and the subjects and recommendations were ordered to be taken up seriatim.\n\nEach subject of the report was separately read, considered, and on motions severally made, Charters were granted to\n\nAbdallah Temple, Isis Temple, Acca Temple, and Osiris Temple; Dispensations being also reported for continuance during the\n\nensuing year, relative to Jerusalem Temple, Rameses Temple, Hella Temple, and Ballut Abyad Temple; while it was ordered that no Charter be granted to Saltanat Temple, and that its Dispensation be recalled.\n\nThe recommendation of the Committee to grant a Charter to Petitioners from Brooklyn, Long Island, was then considered.\n\nand after some discussion was, on motion, adopted.\n\nDiscussion ensued as to the regularity of the procedure, and on motion, the adoption of the recommendation was recon­sidered.\n\nOn motion, the entire subject was referred back to the Com­mittee for further consideration to be made the special matter\n\nfor action after a short recess.\n\nrepaid by an absolute knowledge of the growth and present condition of subordinate Temples. In every instance a high and appreciative order of talent has been incorporated in the respective Divans, and the rendition of the Ritual in each Temple visited has been elaborate, accurate, intelli­gent, and impressive. The social feature appears well guarded in each Temple that has been personally in­spected, and the postprandial exercises evince a well con­certed effort on the part of the officers of Temples to com­mendably vie with each other in elaborating and varying the entertainment at each successive Session, thereby increasing the interest in the observances, and contributing to that most to be desired end, an intimate and sincerely Fraternal intercourse among all the Nobles.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\"What in the beginning was intended to be a 'brief', has lengthened out beyond my honest intent, and I trust you may 'forgive and quite forget' the fault.\n\n\"I thank you for your respectful attention, and ask that your endeavors be now, as they heretofore have been, entirely for the advancement of our Order.\"\n\nA condensed report of the Imperial Treasurer was sub­mitted through Noble James McGee, as follows:\n\n\"Just another thought or two. Now that we are almost on the threshold of a new year I trust that it will be the ambition of every Potentate to place his Temple in the very front rank, that nothing broad, vulgar, or even suggestive, will be permitted in our Ceremonial Sessions or appear in our Circulars. Sometimes I think we give far too much in­formation to the public press and draw the attention of the outside world to our proceedings. I think that we should\n\n95 Khartum.....................
