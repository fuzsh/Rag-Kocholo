        "text": "Seaside Shadows is a Haunted History Tour Company weaving a blend of local history and mystery through live storytelling at dusk by lantern light in the quaint town of Mystic.\n\nSeaside Shadows features ghostly strolls through the historic drawbridge district several nights a week telling guests about some of the darkest legends, lore and events that transpired on the scenic landscape and the true paranormal encounters had today. Guests have an opportunity on all tours to capture their own evidence. They also feature moonlit graveyard tours of Whitehall Cemetery visiting the graves of local men and women without whom the town of Mystic would not exist today. Their tales of bravery, resilience and encounters with the macabre haunt all who visit and hey, there is even tale of a real vampire or two.\n\nSlightly different to the evening tours, Seaside Shadows also offers Elm Grove Cemetery tours featuring true tales of Victorian era funerals, mourning and spiritualism wove along a tour path featuring tales of shipbuilders, Civil War heroes and even true crime stories.\n\nIf walking tours aren’t your thing, Seaside Shadows also offers seasonal ghost boat tours on the Thames and Mystic Rivers with themes such as Shoreline Epidemics, Revolutionary War Ghosts and Wicked Waters. If you’re looking to add to your storytelling experience there are special events in graveyard and local historic sites annually where guests can learn to ghost hunt utilizing EMF, EVP and Thermal equipment alongside trained investigators and celebrity guests.\n\nSeaside Shadows founder, Courtney McInvale Reardon, has also written three books on local legends and lore including Haunted Mystic, Revolutionary War Ghosts of Connecticut and Civil War Ghosts of Connecticut -(Bury My Bones Series, Volume 1).\n\nYou can experience more from Seaside Shadows virtually on their YouTube channel featuring local segments such as Mystical Monday, Witchy Wednesday, Cemetery Saturday and Spooky Story Sunday.
