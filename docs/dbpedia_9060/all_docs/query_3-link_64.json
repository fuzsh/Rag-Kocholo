        "text": "Mystic, Conn. (May 14, 2015)—Plimoth Plantation and Mystic Seaport announced today that Mayflower II is now scheduled to depart Mystic Seaport on the morning of Monday, May 18 for her return trip to Plymouth.\n\nThe delay is due to difficulties with the availability of a tugboat to tow the ship back to Massachusetts.\n\nThe ship is scheduled to cast off at 8 a.m., although the exact time is dependent on tide levels and weather conditions that morning. The journey to Plymouth is expected to take two days. Once back at her berth, the ship will be inspected by the U.S. Coast Guard and other preparations will be carried out to make her ready to reopen to visitors prior to the Memorial Day weekend.\n\nThe full-scale reproduction ship owned by Plimoth Plantation has been at Mystic Seaport to undergo an extensive survey and the first phase of multi-year restoration at the Museum’s Henry B. duPont Preservation Shipyard.\n\nFor more information about Mayflower II and her restoration, visit www.plimoth.org/sos.\n\nImages are available for download at the Mystic Seaport website.\n\nAbout Plimoth Plantation\n\nPlimoth Plantation is a 501(c)3 charitable organization and a living museum dedicated to telling the history of Plymouth Colony from the perspective of both the Pilgrims and the Native Wampanoag people.
