        "text": "I'm planning the maiden voyage of Moon Dance from North Quincy, MA toMystic, CT this spring. I have crewed on several shorter cruises overthe same waters but did not pay too much attention to tides, currents,distance, etc…Initially I was planning on three days stopping at Sandwich and Newport,but now I'm thinking of only two days. I know a key factor is thecurrent through the Cape Cod Canal and am planning on entering the canalshortly after high tide.Assuming we can average 5 knots, leaving at sunrise, I think we cancomfortably reach North Falmouth the first night. That will leave alittle bit longer sail the next day. We would have to leave about ½hour before sunrise to arrive in Mystic before sunset. One other optionI am considering is leaving a little earlier the first day and, if wecan average 5.5 knots., staying at Cutty Hunk for the night. That wouldleave us with a shorter sail the following day and could enjoy 2 hoursof daylight at our destination.Moon Dance is an '82 SR with 150 Jib, 25XP, 3 blade 12x12 fixed prop.My Questions are:1. What speed should I assume for planning this trip?2. Are there any other suggested destinations halfway?3. I have reviewed charts along the way, but are there any dangers Ishould be aware of? 4. I will have one experienced sailor with me and one novice. Would itbe too crowded with a forth person?Thanks for any comments.Dave\n\ndid it last year\n\nDaveWe did a similar trip bringing our boat down from Gloucester MA to Warwick RI last July - a bit longer trip than you are anticipating but the route is the same. We left Gloucester around noon on a Friday, hit max ebb at the Falmouth Canal entrance (different than high tide by a few hours) and transited the Canal in about 45 minutes! We continued down through Buzzards Bay on a following breeze (the most significant part of the trip) and motored across to Narr Bay through the night arriving at Warwick around 6 a.m. Saturday - about a 20 hr trip covering 120 miles.It's a very relaxing and scenic trip and I was much more anxious about a new boat on an overnight than I should have been but...There isn't much to stop at in Falmouth. If you want to break up the trip or if the wind is blowing up Buzzards Bay, best to stop in Onset or somewhere else nearby. The greatest inconvenience you'll face is a stiff southerly against you in Buzz Bay. Check the tide schedule closely for the Canal - I don't recall offhand the tide difference to full ebb and watch out for the fishing nets south of Saconet River which have bright orange barrels easily picked up on radar.We had only 2 sailors aboard out of the 6 of us and the autopilot was on duty most of the night which made it much more relaxing. Have a great tripDonIllusion\n\nIt Depends\n\nHi Dave,Good luck on your maiden voyage on Moon Dance. Based on the tempature outside I'm sure spring is still 100 years away so you have plenty of time to plan your trip.We sail out of Boston as well, and although I haven't been to Mystic we have done the canal, Cuttyhunk Newport on many occasions.Here are a couple of thoughts that may help you in your planning. 1st the current in the canal well likely set the outline for your plan. Make sure you have this years Eldridge and read the section on the canal a few times. It will also give you the exact timing of the ebb and flood currents for the canal.In general if the favorable currents are in the morning I like to stop someplace north of the Canal the day before to give myself plenty of time to catch the current. Sandwich always appears full. You may have better luck in the spring. I usually stop at Scituate. It makes for a light first day but it's a quick hop out of the harbor and back on your track. If the favorable current is in the afternoon or evening you may be able to get through the canal on your first day. We usually stay at Onset or Red Brook Harbor.I also try to be conservative on planning the day. If I can average 5.5 knots I would probably use 5.0 for estimating distance and time. I don't like planning a long day were everything has to go exactly right. I would much rather plan a shorter day and then discover that the weather, boat, and crew are all in a good mood and willing to go further. I also like to avoid leaving or entering an unfamilair port in low light situations. I find things confusing enough at high noon Since it appears you are planning long sailing days I would opt for the 4th person. I enjoy the extra hands for a lookout and an extra stent at the helm. Good Luck,-wayne\n\nNice Trip\n\nDave,I've done the trip in my Hunter 380 and it's a great time. Hunter will be having another rendezvous at Mystic shipyard this August sometime and we'll be there for that.I live on the Cape and sailed, from Harwichport to Newport RI then to Mystic in two full days. The wind did not blow from the Southwest in 2000 especially those two days. We had a NE the first day at 15-20 knots and it blew us to Newport with the tide in only 9 hours (80nm)The second day we left Newport and headed due south with a North Breexe building to over 20knots. Fun trip till I rounded up hard near Fisher's Island Sound and scared my daughter half to death!I've also completed the Race Around Cape Cod several times and know your route well. Couple of points.You'll be heading into a Southwest breeze (usually) that builds all day. You'll be tacking and possibly motor sailing to keep your course made good reasonable. 5 Knots is not unreasonable to expect but tacking will add miles to your trip. I agree that if you get through the canal on day one do not head for Falmouth. Hug the mainland side and look at Onset or Marion. Or I guess you could look at Kingman Marine and Parker's Boat Yrad on the Cape side in Pocasset. They are side by side, both have transient moorings and slips. Kingman is busier with bar/Restuarant and Powerboaters. Parkers is quieter, families, and sailors.Also from experience while motoring through the canal eat a meal... when you exit the canal in Buzzards Bay you'll be with the tide and against the wind creating short steep waves that Buzzards Bay is famous for. This is not time to need the head, chart at the Nav Station, or sleep. The motoring through the canal will take at least an hour so plan ahead for the banging that will soon follow.On the second day you'll do well to make Newport since you'll probably be against the wind again. From Newport to Fisher's Island is about 30 nm and a great sail. The water near Fisher's Island as you enter the protected waters and leave Block Island Sound can be lumpy and uncomfortable for the last 5 miles. Once inside Fisher's Island Sound your home free through Mystic is another hour from there up a tricky channel (for 1st timers anyway)All in all a great trip!Have fun, be safe, plan at least two alternate harbors for each day in case the unexpected happens.Bob KnottH380\n\nDave...a few thoughts on your trip\n\nregardless of how carefully you plan your voyage you must expect the unexpected. wind and sea conditions can drastically effect your trip. for instance if the wind is from the southwest you will be on the nose all the way from the canal to mystic. you will have to power most of the way or do a lot of tacking in which case it will take you twice as long to get there.If there is fog (very common) you might be going a bit slower or not at all.Do not forget about pt. judith harbor of refuge, it is a great anchorage and great spot to spend the night if you don't get as far as you hoped. Newport takes you quite a way out of your way (10 miles or so each way) compared to a direct line from cuttyhunk to pt. judith.Between pt. judith and watch hill there is no where to pull in so you have to make that in one shot...once inside fishers island sound there are lots of harbors or protected lee shores to drop a hook but by then your almost to your new home port. What marina in mystic are you docking at?Be cautious of rocks at the entrance to cuttyhunk. Also Westport harbor on the north west end of buzzards bay is an alternate to cuttyhunk.Also be cautious of rocks on the south side of fishers island sound...use your charts and if clear visibility stay north of the green buoys marking the south side of the sound...rock reefs all along inside those buoys.Four people is fine on your 30 I've had four people for a week on a catalina 25.You might want to consider sailing in shifts and going 24 hours straight.Let me know if you want some company for the trip, I've never been through the canal...also John P. went through the canal out to p-town last year he might want to join you as well.Best regards,Dave L.S/V Windward Jan, ODay 35"
