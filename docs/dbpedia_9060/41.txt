The Mystic Tide

In late 1964/early 1965, a group of four high school musicians from the Long Island, NY suburb of Woodbury foormed a band. While most Long Island bands were playing soul music, The Mystic Tide refused to go along with the trend. By not following trends and sticking to their own originals and improvised covers, they develeop a sound that was way ahead of its time. The result is the legendary psychedelic sound that lives on today in this Distortions Records re-issue "Solid Sound."
