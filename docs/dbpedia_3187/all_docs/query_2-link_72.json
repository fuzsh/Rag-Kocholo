        "text": "SEARCH PULP INTERNATIONAL\n\nThe headlines that mattered yesteryear.\n\n1995—Mickey Mantle Dies\n\nNew York Yankees outfielder Mickey Mantle dies of complications from cancer, after receiving a liver transplant. He was one of the greatest baseball players ever, but he was also an alcoholic and played drunk, hungover, and unprepared. He once said about himself, \"Sometimes I think if I had the same body and the same natural ability and someone else's brain, who knows how good a player I might have been.\"\n\n1943—Philadelphia Experiment Allegedly Takes Place\n\nThe U.S. government is believed by some to have attempted to create a cloak of invisibility around the Navy ship USS Eldridge. The top secret event is known as the Philadelphia Experiment and, according to believers, ultimately leads to the accidental teleportation of an entire vessel.\n\n1953—Soviets Detonate Deliverable Nuke\n\nThe Soviet Union detonates a nuclear weapon codenamed Reaktivnyi Dvigatel Stalina, aka Stalin's Jet Engine. In the U.S. the bomb is codenamed Joe 4. It is a small yield fission bomb rather than a multi-stage fusion weapon, but it makes up for its relative weakness by being fully deployable, meaning it can be dropped from a bomber."
