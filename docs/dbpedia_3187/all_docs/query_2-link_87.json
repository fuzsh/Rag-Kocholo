        "text": "The BBC's award-winning murder mystery drama Shetland will have a new lead actor when it returns next year.\n\nAshley Jensen will star as DI Ruth Calder, a native Shetlander who returns to the isles after 20 years working for the Met in London.\n\nThe Scottish actor takes on the lead detective role left vacant by DI Jimmy Perez, played for seven series by Douglas Henshall.\n\nJensen said she was \"absolutely thrilled\" to be joining the show.\n\nThe 53-year-old, who was born in Annan in Dumfriesshire, got her big break when she starred alongside Ricky Gervais in Extras in 2005.\n\nShe went on to appear regularly in US TV series Ugly Betty before returning to the UK with roles in shows such as Agatha Raisin and Catastrophe.\n\nIn 2019 she reunited with Gervais in the Netflix comedy series After Life.\n\nThe new series of Shetland will film in locations on Shetland and across Scotland from the spring.\n\nIt will see Jensen join series regulars such as Alison O'Donnell (DS Alison 'Tosh' McIntosh), Steven Robertson (Sandy), Lewis Howden (Billy) and Anne Kidd (Cora).\n\nJensen said: \"There will be a different dynamic with Ruth amongst the regular characters and a few more new interesting characters to enjoy.\n\n\"However the integrity of the show and the world that has been created will remain very much in the same tone as the last seven seasons.\n\n\"It's a real privilege to be asked to lead this show into a new chapter.\""
