        "text": "Hollywood stars will be on the edge of their seats at tonight's Golden Globe Awards, not because of the gongs on offer but because of the evening's host.\n\nComedian Ricky Gervais has told his more than 1.4 million Twitter followers: \"No-one knows what I'm going to say until I say it.\"\n\nThe Idiot Abroad creator added: \"That was my only stipulation to host again.\"\n\nHaving offended half of Hollywood's A-listers at the glitzy red-carpet event in 2010, he was invited to return for a second time.\n\n\"Also not nominated - I love you Phillip Morris. Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor, two heterosexual characters pretending to be gay. So the complete opposite of some famous scientologist,\" joked Gervais to gasps in 2011.\n\nBut the so-far bulletproof host's wicked sense of humour has earned him a third consecutive invitation to front tonight's awards.\n\n\"I am keen having to write new jokes as I pick my victims, I mean targets, I mean presenters to introduce,\" tweeted Gervais.\n\nBut Gervais is not the only British export expected to make the headlines at the Golden Globes.\n\nWar-time drama Downton Abbey leads the nominations race with four and the 1950s newsroom drama The Hour is up for two acting gongs.\n\nKate Winslet is nominated for best actress in Mildred Pierce and for her role in the film Carnage and Jeremy Irons goes head-to-head with Damian Lewis for best actor.\n\n\"I think British talent in TV acting and dramas is peerless,\" critic Kevin O'Sullivan told Sky News.\n\n\"As a nation we have always produced arguably the best actors in the world. We have the tendency to make programmes which are a bit more upmarket, a bit more artistically credible.\"\n\nAnd it is not just British TV talent punching above its weight in LA.\n\nFor her role in We Need to Talk about Kevin, Tilda Swinton is up for best actress.\n\nBut no Globe Awards would be complete without nominations for George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Leonardo Dicaprio.\n\nThough who would raise their heads above the parapet when your host threatens humiliation by humour?\n\n:: List Of Golden Globe Nominees\n\nMOTION PICTURES\n\nPicture, Drama\n\nThe Descendants,\n\nThe Help\n\nHugo\n\nThe Ides of March\n\nMoneyball\n\nWarhorse\n\nPicture, Musical or Comedy\n\n50/50\n\nThe Artist\n\nBridesmaids\n\nMidnight In Paris\n\nMy Week With Marilyn\n\nActor, Drama\n\nGeorge Clooney, The Descendants\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio, J Edgar\n\nMichael Fassbender, Shame\n\nRyan Gosling, The Ides of March\n\nBrad Pitt, Moneyball\n\nActress, Drama\n\nGlenn Close, Albert Nobbs\n\nViola Davis, The Help\n\nRooney Mara, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\n\nMeryl Streep, The Iron Lady\n\nTilda Swinton, We Need to Talk About Kevin\n\nDirector\n\nWoody Allen, Midnight in Paris\n\nGeorge Clooney, The Ides Of March\n\nMichel Hazanavicius, The Artist\n\nAlexander Payne, The Descendants\n\nMartin Scorsese, Hugo\n\nActor, Musical or Comedy\n\nJean Dujardin, The Artist\n\nBrendan Gleeson, The Guard\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt, 50/50\n\nRyan Gosling, Crazy, Stupid, Love\n\nOwen Wilson, Midnight in Paris\n\nActress, Musical or Comedy\n\nJodie Foster, Carnage\n\nCharlize Theron, Young Adult\n\nKristen Wiig, Bridesmaids\n\nMichelle Williams, My Week With Marilyn\n\nKate Winslet, Carnage\n\nSupporting Actor\n\nKenneth Branagh, My Week With Marilyn\n\nAlbert Brooks, Drive\n\nJonah Hill, Moneyball\n\nViggo Mortensen, A Dangerous Method\n\nChristopher Plummer, Beginners\n\nSupporting Actress\n\nBerenice Bejo, The Artist\n\nJessica Chastain, The Help\n\nJanet McTeer, Albert Nobbs\n\nOctavia Spencer, The Help\n\nShailene Woodley, The Descendants\n\nForeign Language\n\nThe Flowers Of War\n\nIn the Land of Blood And Honey\n\nThe Kid With A Bike\n\nA Separation\n\nThe Skin I Live In\n\nAnimated Film\n\nThe Adventures of Tintin\n\nArthur Christmas\n\nCars 2\n\nPuss In Boots\n\nRango\n\nScreenplay\n\nWoody Allen, Midnight In Paris\n\nGeorge Clooney, Grant Heslov, Beau Willimon, The Ides Of March\n\nMichel Hazanavicius, The Artist\n\nAlexander Payne, Nat Faxon, Jim Rash, The Descendants\n\nSteven Zaillian, Aaron Sorkin, Moneyball\n\nOriginal Score\n\nLudovic Bource, The Artist\n\nAbel Korzeniowski, W.E.\n\nTrent Reznor, Atticus Ross, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\n\nHoward Shore, Hugo\n\nJohn Williams, War Horse\n\nOriginal Song\n\nHello Hello (music by Elton John, lyrics by Bernie Taupin), Gnomeo & Juliet\n\nThe Keeper (music and lyrics by Chris Cornell) Machine Gun Preacher\n\nLay Your Head Down (music by Brian Byrne, lyrics by Glenn Close), Albert Nobbs\n\nThe Living Proof (music by Mary J Blige, Thomas Newman, Harvey Mason Jr, lyrics by Mary J Blige, Harvey Mason Jr, Damon Thomas), The Help\n\nMasterpiece (music and lyrics by Madonna, Julie Frost, Jimmy Harry) W.E\n\nTELEVISION\n\nSeries, Drama\n\nAmerican Horror Story\n\nBoardwalk Empire\n\nBoss\n\nGame Of Thrones\n\nHomeland"
