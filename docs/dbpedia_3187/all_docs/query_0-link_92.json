        "text": "Tag Archives: france\n\nHiroshima Mon Amour\n\nI was an architect, she was an actress. I drew the Eiffel Tower upon her dress. So we could see the world… The flash burnt our shadows right into the wall. But my best friend and I will leave them behind in Hiroshima. I will keep her secrets, I will change my name. My sweetheart and I are saying goodbye to Hiroshima.\n\n—-My Favorite, Burning Hearts\n\nI have been taking too much pleasure in the NBA playoffs and as always happens when you take too much pleasure in something it all went to shit. My team, after a fantastic start, crashed and burned and went down to humiliating and ignominious defeat.\n\nMy lesson learned, again, I turned the game off and switched over to the always reliable backup – The Criterion Channel (the best streaming money you can spend). I cruised through the copious selection of marvelous and recherché moving picture shows and settled on a classic that I have never seen, Alan Resnais’ Hiroshima Mon Amour.\n\nResnais had made his reputation with a string of documentary films, including the first-rate Night and Fog, about the Nazi death camps. He was approached to make a similar nonfiction work about the Hiroshima bomb and traveled to Japan to start work. He realized that he could not make a simple documentary about that horror, especially for Western audiences (who, in the 1950’s, generally thought of the bomb as the end of the war) and proposed he make a fictional film instead.\n\nHe hired the novelist Marguerite Duras to write the screenplay and made a groundbreaking film. The surface plot is about a French actress (played by the luminous Emmanuele Riva) in Hiroshima to make a documentary about the bombing – she has a brief but intensely passionate affair with a Japanese architect (played by the equally riveting Eiji Okada). They have only thirty-six hours before she must go back to Paris.\n\nBut time in the film isn’t the same as it is in the real world. The story is told in conversations between the couple, in flashbacks, in dream sequences, in bits of newsreel footage.\n\nThe fourteen minute opening sequence is an amazing kaleidoscopic montage surrounding a scene of two naked bodies writhing in passion while radioactive dust falls from the sky and sticks to their sweat-drenched skin.\n\nThe film is full of questions, symbolism, conundrums wrapped in enigmas, doubling (the actress has had forbidden affairs with soldiers of both of the West’s enemies in WWII) and all the other accouterments of the French New Wave.\n\nDespite all this, the film is watchable to anyone tired of the MCU. If nothing else, you can look at Emmanuele Riva and her expressive face (at eighteen and thirty four) as she is buffeted by history, war, the past, and the passion of today.\n\nDecades ago I stumbled across an obscure New York band called My Favorite. I have been a bit of a fan ever since. Watching the movie I realized that one of their “popular” songs, Burning Hearts, was inspired by the movie. Cool.\n\nGerminal\n\n“This sounded the death knell of small family businesses, soon to be followed by the disappearance of the individual entrepreneur, gobbled up one by one by the increasingly hungry ogre of capitalism, and drowned by the rising tide of large companies.”\n\n― Émile Zola, Germinal\n\nFor three years I have been working my way through the 20 novels of Émile Zola’s Les Rougon-Macquart series. So far:\n\nLa Fortune des Rougon (1871) (The Fortune of the Rougons)\n\nSon Excellence Eugène Rougon (1876) (His Excellency Eugene Rougon/ His Excellency)\n\nLa Curée (1871-2) (The Kill)\n\nL’Argent (1891) (Money)\n\nLe Rêve (1888) (The Dream)\n\nLa Conquête de Plassans (1874) (The Conquest of Plassans/A Priest in the House)\n\nPot-Bouille (1882) (Pot Luck/Restless House/Piping Hot)\n\nAu Bonheur des Dames (1883) (The Ladies’ Paradise/Shop Girls of Paris/Ladies’ Delight)\n\nLa Faute de l’Abbé Mouret (1875) (The Sin of Father Mouret/Abbe Mouret’s Transgression)\n\nUne Page d’amour (1878) (A Lesson in Love/A Love Episode/A Page of Love/A Love Affair)\n\nLe Ventre de Paris (1873) (The Belly of Paris/The Fat and the Thin/Savage Paris/The Markets of Paris)\n\nLa Joie de Vivre (1884) (The Joys of Living/Joy of Life/How Jolly Life Is/Zest for Life)\n\nL’Assommoir (1877) (The Dram Shop/The Gin Palace/Drink/Drunkard) and the movie Gervaise\n\nL’Œuvre (1886) (The Masterpiece/A Masterpiece/His Masterpiece)\n\nLa Bête Humaine (1890) (The Beast in the Man/The Human Beast/The Monomaniac)\n\nGerminal (1885)\n\nNana (1880)\n\nLa Terre (1887) (The Earth/The Soil)\n\nLa Débâcle (1892) (The Downfall/The Smash-up/The Debacle)\n\nLe Docteur Pascal (1893) (Doctor Pascal)\n\nFor all of 2021 I’ve been reading Germinal – reading too slow – I haven’t been reading enough. Over the last few days, however, I took a few days of vacation with the family in Hot Springs Arkansas, and that gave me the time to finish the book.\n\nGerminal is generally considered Zola’s masterpiece and is the most popular of all the volumes in Les Rougon-Macquart cycle. It is the story of the terrible conditions in the coal mines of France during the Second Empire (set in the 1860s). It’s protagonist is Étienne Lantier, the son of Gervaise from L’Assommoir and the brother of Jacques Lantier from La Bête Humaine and Claude Lantier from L’Œuvre. Étienne suffers from the family malady of drunkenness and fits of violent madness, but balances that with a sharp mind and a truly caring spirit.\n\nSuffering from a business slump the owners of the mines keep reducing the pay of the colliers in the pits until they can barely feed themselves. There is a strike, which does not go well for anybody.\n\nThe story is truly heartbreaking, both in the terrible conditions in the mine and associated villages – plus the inevitable doom as they all go on strike.\n\nOne overarching theme is the philosophical battle between capitalism and socialism (in several various flavors). Zola spills a lot of ink contrasting the struggles of the mine workers with the lavish lifestyle of the bourgeoisie living off their investments in the mines. It is well done and absolutely heartbreaking.\n\nIt is interesting to read a book about socialist and communist ideals written in 1885 – long before Stalin, Mao, or Castro. Despite the terrible horrors of the strike there is still a youthful optimism about the struggles that were to come.\n\nZola ends the novel on a note of hope:\n\nBeneath the blazing of the sun, in that morning of new growth, the countryside rang with song, as its belly swelled with a black and avenging army of men, germinating slowly in its furrows, growing upwards in readiness for harvests to come, until one day soon their ripening would burst open the earth itself.\n\nOne other point that I have learned reading the entire Zola cycle is the importance of a good, modern translation. When I started I thought I’d read the free, Project Gutenberg ebook editions. However, those are contemporary and highly bowdlerized translations. I actually read Germinal… maybe forty years ago, in one of those versions and barely remember it. This time I bought the Oxford’s World Classic edition, translated by Peter Collier – and it is an amazing, modern, memorable translation. I highly recommend it (though there are probably other modern translations as good).\n\nI also see that there are several film editions of Germinal. A fairly recent French version is available to stream and I’ll see if I can set aside some time in the next few days to watch it.\n\nOtherwise, it’s on to the next book, Nana. This is about the half-sister of Étienne Lantier and her decent through the underbelly of sexual exploitation in Paris. It’s another one that I read a long, long, time ago and am looking to revisiting a better translation.\n\nIt’ll be slow, though. My Difficult Reads Book Club is about to embark on Haruki Murakami’s 1Q84 – which will be a good bit of work.\n\nSo many book, so little time.\n\nA good article on the book:\n\nRereading Zola’s Germinal\n\nJean Renoir and La Bête humaine\n\n“You see, in this world, there is one awful thing, and that is that everyone has his reasons.”\n\n― Jean Renoir\n\nSo yesterday, I finished La Bête humaine by Emile Zola.\n\nI have written before about my love for the streaming wonderfulness of The Criterion Channel. So tonight I sat down and watched the 1938 film by Jean Renoir, his version of Zola’s La Bête humaine.\n\nIt was very good – though very different than the book. The plot was significantly trimmed down – most of the murders were gone (only the two key homicides were left). The big set pieces were cut too, for time and also, probably for budget – the special effects cost for train wrecks and blizzards has to be enormous.\n\nWhat is left is a more personal story, one of the first examples of film noir – with a femme fatale (Simone Simon – who I recognized from Cat People, filmed a few years later). A love triangle, murder, and Zola’s inherited madness make for a lively time.\n\nRenoir’s genius is in his ability to make his characters come alive on screen. He also shows a wonderful respect for the working class folks that populate the story. Even at their worst – his characters have their reasons, they are driven by the sins of the past.\n\nIt did still have the trains, though. The plot moves along like a hot steam engine on a track. A lot of the film was done on location instead of in studio – which added a gritty realism to the story. The Criterion Channel had an interview with Peter Bogdanovich who said that the original impetus for the film was that the star, Jean Gabin, wanted to make a movie where he got to drive a train.\n\nLa Bête humaine\n\n“Don’t go looking at me like that because you’ll wear your eyes out.”\n\n― Emile Zola, La Bête humaine\n\nIt’s been awhile… since September, 2018, to be exact. For two and a half years I have been working my way through the 20 novels of Émile Zola’s Les Rougon-Macquart series. So far:\n\nLa Fortune des Rougon (1871) (The Fortune of the Rougons)\n\nSon Excellence Eugène Rougon (1876) (His Excellency Eugene Rougon/ His Excellency)\n\nLa Curée (1871-2) (The Kill)\n\nL’Argent (1891) (Money)\n\nLe Rêve (1888) (The Dream)\n\nLa Conquête de Plassans (1874) (The Conquest of Plassans/A Priest in the House)\n\nPot-Bouille (1882) (Pot Luck/Restless House/Piping Hot)\n\nAu Bonheur des Dames (1883) (The Ladies’ Paradise/Shop Girls of Paris/Ladies’ Delight)\n\nLa Faute de l’Abbé Mouret (1875) (The Sin of Father Mouret/Abbe Mouret’s Transgression)\n\nUne Page d’amour (1878) (A Lesson in Love/A Love Episode/A Page of Love/A Love Affair)\n\nLe Ventre de Paris (1873) (The Belly of Paris/The Fat and the Thin/Savage Paris/The Markets of Paris)\n\nLa Joie de Vivre (1884) (The Joys of Living/Joy of Life/How Jolly Life Is/Zest for Life)\n\nL’Assommoir (1877) (The Dram Shop/The Gin Palace/Drink/Drunkard) and the movie Gervaise\n\nL’Œuvre (1886) (The Masterpiece/A Masterpiece/His Masterpiece)\n\nLa Bête Humaine (1890) (The Beast in the Man/The Human Beast/The Monomaniac)\n\nGerminal (1885)\n\nNana (1880)\n\nLa Terre (1887) (The Earth/The Soil)\n\nLa Débâcle (1892) (The Downfall/The Smash-up/The Debacle)\n\nLe Docteur Pascal (1893) (Doctor Pascal)\n\nLooking at this list, I realize I read L’Œuvre (1886) (The Masterpiece) this summer and never wrote a blog entry about it. Sorry. It was good, not the best of the series, but an interesting take on the artistic life and the madness behind it. I’ll write it up in the next few days, once I think about it and take a look at the text again.\n\nI have been neglecting Zola lately, mostly because I’ve been participating in a Zoom group that is reading Dostoevsky’s The Brother’s Karamazov (which I have been enjoying immensely). We took a bit of a break over the holidays and I used the time to devour La Bête humaine.\n\nI had read a paperback copy of La Bête humaine years and years ago – but I remembered very little about it other than it had trains and murders.\n\nWOW. This is one hell of a book. One surprising thing about the 20 books in the Rougon-Marquart universe is how wildly diverse they are. They range from frilly romance to gritty poverty to hopeless alcoholism to rampant greed. And now, we have this.\n\nLa Bête humaine is a book of murder(s). By the end of the story pretty much every major character is a killer, a victim, or both. All these murders sans one stem from the same cause – jealous rage. The one other example is a chilling description of a compulsive killer, consumed by powerful, mysterious violent urges of madness, insanity, and desire. The wheels of justice don’t help much – they turn slowly, then grind to a stop. The only innocent character is eventually blamed and convicted.\n\nIt is a novel of the railroad. Specifically, the nineteenth century steam engines that ran between Paris and the coast at Le Havre. Zola’s prodigious powers of description are used to paint portraits of the stations, the line, and especially the powerful engine “La Lison” which becomes practically a living character imbued with almost sexual powers.\n\nFinally, it is a novel of arresting and amazing set pieces. The entire chapter where a wagon containing two huge hunks of rock is pushed into the path of “La Lison” is one of the most sensational and electrifying chunks of text I have ever read. There are horrifying killings, terrifying betrayals, and moments of sexual tension surprising for a classic novel. The final scene, especially, is chilling and horrific, even though it ends before the inevitable apocalypse.\n\nThere are free public domain versions of the novel available (from Project Gutenberg and other places) but I am glad I bought the excellent Roger Pearson translation from Oxford World Classics. It is written in a modern style, which fits this story very well.\n\nSo this was an enjoyable, if horrific, read. And now, on to Germinal, arguably the best in the series. I’ve already bought a good translation and am ready to go. However, I will wait until the end of January, have to finish The Brothers Karamazov first.\n\nSo little time, so many books.\n\nGervaise\n\n“With almost superhuman strength she seized Virginie by the waist, bent her forward with her face to the brick floor and, notwithstanding her struggles, lifted her skirts and showed the white and naked skin. Then she brought her beater down as she had formerly done at Plassans under the trees on the riverside, where her employer had washed the linen of the garrison.\n\nEach blow of the beater fell on the soft flesh with a dull thud, leaving a scarlet mark.”\n\n― Emile Zola, L’Assommoir\n\nYesterday I finished Zola’s L’Assommoir and enjoyed it a lot. In doing some online research about the book I discovered it had been made into a 1956 French film called Gervaise that wasn’t supposed to be too bad. It was directed by René Clément and starred Maria Schell (sister of Maximilian). I was able to find a copy of the film and waited until I finished the book – then sat down to watch it.\n\nL’Assommoir is a big, complicated, 500 page book and I knew they would have to slim it down to get the story into a movie. They did, but remained faithful to the spirit of the Zola novel. The movie concentrates on Gervaise – not surprisingly – and leaves out a lot of the tumult around her. I really liked the film – despite being over sixty years old (a year older than me) it holds up well. Gervaise’s decent into abject poverty, despair, and destruction is rushed as compared to the book – she is still alive at the end of the film and the book conveys the horrors of her descent better. There is a political subplot added to the movie that wasn’t in the book – and I didn’t think it added much. But otherwise, I thought the movie did a good job and illustrated the look of a lot of the story that I had trouble imagining (having never been to Paris of the Second Empire myself).\n\nLike the book, the movie suffered from prudish editing – luckily the version I found seems mostly uncut (it was 116 minutes long). The biggest difference seems to be in the fight in the wash house between Gervaise and her arch-rival Virginie at the beginning of the story – the version I saw had a bloody scene of Gervaise tearing off Virginie’s earring and then beating her bare bottom with a wooden paddle. Tame by modern standards – those scenes were too much for the 1950’s.\n\nThe movie is one of the most expensive (in modern currency) foreign films ever made. The sets are extensive, detailed, and realistic.\n\nAnd the best thing is that many of the memorable set pieces of the book are preserved. The wedding party and its visit to the Louvre, the horrifying fall her husband takes off a roof on the day she is to buy her shop, Gervaise’s Name-Day feast, Coupou’s alcoholic madness (though transferred from an asylum to Gervaise’s shop – probably more dramatic that way), and most of all the famous fight between Gervaise and Virginie in the wash house – all were giving loving care and exciting treatment.\n\nCompare this scene to:\n\nAt least Degas’ woman still has her hat (Gervaise has pawned hers).\n\nReviews of Gervaise:\n\nAdapting Emile Zola’s L’Assommoir, René Clément’s Gervaise (1956)\n\nGervaise: True Grit\n\nGERVAISE – ESSENTIAL ART HOUSE\n\nL’Assommoir\n\n“While the storm was erupting, she stayed, staring at it, watching the shafts of lightning, like someone who could see serious things, far away in the future in these sudden flashes of light.”\n\n― Emile Zola, L’Assommoir\n\nI am now a good chunk (have been reading for a year and a half) into Emile Zola’s twenty volume Rougon Macquat series of novels. Attacking this pile of books in the recommended reading order:\n\nLa Fortune des Rougon (1871) (The Fortune of the Rougons)\n\nSon Excellence Eugène Rougon (1876) (His Excellency Eugene Rougon/ His Excellency)\n\nLa Curée (1871-2) (The Kill)\n\nL’Argent (1891) (Money)\n\nLe Rêve (1888) (The Dream)\n\nLa Conquête de Plassans (1874) (The Conquest of Plassans/A Priest in the House)\n\nPot-Bouille (1882) (Pot Luck/Restless House/Piping Hot)\n\nAu Bonheur des Dames (1883) (The Ladies’ Paradise/Shop Girls of Paris/Ladies’ Delight)\n\nLa Faute de l’Abbé Mouret (1875) (The Sin of Father Mouret/Abbe Mouret’s Transgression)\n\nUne Page d’amour (1878) (A Lesson in Love/A Love Episode/A Page of Love/A Love Affair)\n\nLe Ventre de Paris (1873) (The Belly of Paris/The Fat and the Thin/Savage Paris/The Markets of Paris)\n\nLa Joie de Vivre (1884) (The Joys of Living/Joy of Life/How Jolly Life Is/Zest for Life)\n\nL’Assommoir (1877) (The Dram Shop/The Gin Palace/Drink/Drunkard)\n\nL’Œuvre (1886) (The Masterpiece/A Masterpiece/His Masterpiece)\n\nLa Bête Humaine (1890) (The Beast in the Man/The Human Beast/The Monomaniac)\n\nGerminal (1885)\n\nNana (1880)\n\nLa Terre (1887) (The Earth/The Soil)\n\nLa Débâcle (1892) (The Downfall/The Smash-up/The Debacle)\n\nLe Docteur Pascal (1893) (Doctor Pascal)\n\nThe next one up (the thirteenth) was L’Assommoir – I picked up an excellent Penguin Classics translation by Robin Buss entitled The Drinking Den (there is no good English translation for the French word L’Assommoir).\n\nFrom the article 10 Intoxicating Facts About Edgar Degas’s L’Absinthe\n\n9. IT INSPIRED A LITERARY MASTERPIECE.\n\nL’Assommoir by celebrated French novelist Émile Zola was an exploration of alcoholism among the poor of Paris. Zola must have seen the painting during its disastrous 1876 debut, as his book was published the following year. The author credited Degas for some of L’Assommoir ‘s imagery, telling him, “I quite plainly described some of your pictures in more than one place in my pages.”\n\nIt took me five months to finish L’Assommoir – well, actually I read it in a week – I spent five months reading other stuff. I guess that’s all right.\n\nAfter reading La Joie de Vivre I had to decide – I had already read L’Assommoir – along with four of the next five. Years ago, before the internet, I was able to get my hands on L’Assommoir, Germinal, La Bête Humaine, and Nana – but none of the others in the Rougon-Macquart Cycle. So, do I re-read L’Assommoir? Or skip ahead to L’Œuvre (which looks really interesting).\n\nI decided to re-read the ones I had poured through already. At least with L’Assommoir I’m glad I did.\n\nFirst of all it’s arguably (along with Germinal) the best book in the series. It’s a terribly sad story but an arresting one, full of fascinating full-blooded characters filling a complete world. We can’t live (thank God) in the world of the underbelly of Paris in the Second French Empire – but the book takes us there and we can feel the moments of passionate fun along with the grinding poverty and ultimate doom of a group of people we come to know well and care deeply about.\n\nThe story follows Gervaise Macquart, who we met briefly in the first novel in the series,La Fortune des Rougon, where she ran away from her country town of Plassans to Paris with her lover, Lantier. She works as a washerwoman and has two children with Lantier until he leaves her for another woman. Then she marries a non-drinking roofer, Coupeau and her life takes a turn for the better. She is able to put together the funds to open her own laundry, hire employees, and her daughter is born (Nana – who will have her own book later on, as will Gervaise’s other two children) – everything is going great. This is Zola, however, and he accounts for the madness in the Rougon-Macquart family and after Coupeau is severely injured in an accident they go on a long, heartbreaking, alcohol-fueled fall into abject poverty, disaster, and madness.\n\nThe second reason I was glad I re-read the book is that I was able to get a good great translation. As I’ve written before all Zola’s books are available for free in ebook form from Project Gutenberg. However, these translations done by the Vizetelly family are not the best. Henry Vizetelly was imprisoned over the publication of his translation of La Terre, which was considered offensive. Subsequent editions of all of Zola’s novels were heavily edited by his son Ernest in order to avoid further prosecutions.\n\nI have learned to bite the bullet and buy a modern translation if one is available. This is especially true of L’Assommoir. It is filled with street slang and risque scenes which are omitted from the Vizetelly versions. The Penguin edition I had was translated by Robin Buss and was very well done. I’m going to look for his translations of any French novels in the future.\n\nThe arc of the story of L’Assommoir is heartbreaking but I loved the structure of the novel. It is built around a series (pretty much one per chapter) of set pieces. In keeping with Zola’s style of literary naturalism these scenes are finely detailed, rollicking, and the reader feels in the heart of the action. The wedding (with a tumultuous visit to the Louvre), Gervaise’s triumphant feast (the zenith of her life which also contains the seeds of her downfall), and the final battle with alcoholic madness of her husband Coupeau, are some of the most famous – but there are more.\n\nSo, if you want an introduction to the seedier side of Paris, an introduction to Zola and naturalist literature, with a great (although heartbreaking) story – you can’t do better than L’Assommoir.\n\nThe Joy of Life\n\n“Did not one spend the first half of one’s days in dreams of happiness and the second half in regrets and terrors?”\n\n― Émile Zola, The Joy of Life\n\nI am now a good chunk (have been reading for over a year) into Emile Zola’s twenty volume Rougon Macquat series of novels. Attacking this pile of books in the recommended reading order:\n\nLa Fortune des Rougon (1871) (The Fortune of the Rougons)\n\nSon Excellence Eugène Rougon (1876) (His Excellency Eugene Rougon/ His Excellency)\n\nLa Curée (1871-2) (The Kill)\n\nL’Argent (1891) (Money)\n\nLe Rêve (1888) (The Dream)\n\nLa Conquête de Plassans (1874) (The Conquest of Plassans/A Priest in the House)\n\nPot-Bouille (1882) (Pot Luck/Restless House/Piping Hot)\n\nAu Bonheur des Dames (1883) (The Ladies’ Paradise/Shop Girls of Paris/Ladies’ Delight)\n\nLa Faute de l’Abbé Mouret (1875) (The Sin of Father Mouret/Abbe Mouret’s Transgression)\n\nUne Page d’amour (1878) (A Lesson in Love/A Love Episode/A Page of Love/A Love Affair)\n\nLe Ventre de Paris (1873) (The Belly of Paris/The Fat and the Thin/Savage Paris/The Markets of Paris)\n\nLa Joie de Vivre (1884) (The Joys of Living/Joy of Life/How Jolly Life Is/Zest for Life)\n\nL’Assommoir (1877) (The Dram Shop/The Gin Palace/Drink/Drunkard)\n\nL’Œuvre (1886) (The Masterpiece/A Masterpiece/His Masterpiece)\n\nLa Bête Humaine (1890) (The Beast in the Man/The Human Beast/The Monomaniac)\n\nGerminal (1885)\n\nNana (1880)\n\nLa Terre (1887) (The Earth/The Soil)\n\nLa Débâcle (1892) (The Downfall/The Smash-up/The Debacle)\n\nLe Docteur Pascal (1893) (Doctor Pascal)\n\nThe next one up was The Joy of Life (La Joie de Vivre/The Joys of Living/Joy of Life/How Jolly Life Is/Zest for Life).\n\nIt is a sort-of sequel to The Belly of Paris. The protagonist is Pauline Quenu – the daughter of the owners of the successful Paris charcuterie in that novel. Between the two novels she is orphaned, and sent at nine years of age, along with her substantial fortune inherited from the business, to live with distant relatives in a dismal seaside fishing village. She moves in with an older couple, the Chanteaus, and their 19 year old son, Lazare.\n\nThe title, The Joy of Life, is an ironic one – there is little joy in the Chanteau household. The old man is crippled with gout and his wife crippled by regret. The son is a dilettante and flits from one grandiose scheme to another – each one a greater disaster than the last. Pauline is a generous, good person – and is taken advantage of over and over by everyone else in the story. Her fortune is slowly wasted away, spent on wild ideas and hopeless charity until everyone is left in abject poverty. As she comes of age she inevitably falls in love with Lazare, which is the worst thing that could possibly happen to her.\n\nThe detailed portrait of Lazare and his wasted life is a fascinating chronicle of mental illness written before our modern understanding. Lazare suffers not only from depression, anxiety and ennui – but from what we would now call OCD:\n\nWith all this were mingled certain ideas of symmetry. He would take three steps to the right and then as many to the left, and touch the different articles of furniture on either side of a window or door the same number of times. And beneath this there lurked the superstitious fancy that a certain number of touchings, some five or seven, for instance, distributed in a particular fashion, would prevent the farewell from being a final one.\n\nI guess it’s not surprising, given the detailed and heartbreaking description of mental illness and its disastrous consequences – The Joy of Life was the favorite book of Vincent van Gogh and is included in two of his paintings: Still Life with Bible and Vase with Oleanders and Books.\n\nThe book was interesting for its characters and dire setting, but isn’t one of the better books in the series. It’s relentless pessimism becomes predictable and repetitive – it makes its point about human weakness and disaster over and over – hammering it home with no subtlety or relief.\n\nAnother problem is that I only had access to the contemporary Vizettely translation and the most dramatic part of the book – a nine page section of chapter ten outlining a terribly difficult birth scene – was cut out and replaced with one short paragraph:\n\nThere came a cruel and affecting scene. It was one of those dread hours when life and death wrestle together, when human science and skill battle to overcome and correct the errors of Nature. More than once did the Doctor pause, fearing a fatal issue. The patient’s agony was terrible, but at last science triumphed, and a child was born. It was a boy.\n\nIt seems that a depiction of childbirth was too much for the delicate English-speakers of the time.\n\nAt any rate – I did enjoy the book and found it very interesting even though it became a bit of a depressing slog.\n\nBut now I have a decision to make – the next book in the series, L’Assommoir – along with four of the next five – I have already read. Years ago, before the internet, I was able to get my hands on L’Assommoir, Germinal, La Bête Humaine, and Nana – but none of the others in the Rougon-Macquart Cycle. So, do I re-read L’Assommoir? Or skip ahead to L’Œuvre (which looks really interesting).\n\nThe thing is, I have other reading to do – a lot of reading. So I should take a break and by skipping the three I have already read I’m only four books from the end.\n\nBut the other thing is… L’Assommoir is a great book – one of the best books I’ve ever read – better than the others in the cycle (so far). I’m sure I would get a lot out of it reading it as an old man and having read all the novels leading up to it. Likewise, Germinal is a classic, La Bête Humaine a heart-stopping thrill ride and Nana a guilty pleasure. So I’ll probably take a break – read my Dostoevsky – and then take up Zola’s cycle in full.\n\nWish me luck.\n\nThe Belly of Paris\n\n“Respectable people… What bastards!”\n\n― Émile Zola, The Belly of Paris\n\nI am now a good chunk (have been reading for about a year) into Emile Zola’s twenty volume Rougon Macquat series of novels. Attacking this pile of books in the recommended reading order:\n\nLa Fortune des Rougon (1871) (The Fortune of the Rougons)\n\nSon Excellence Eugène Rougon (1876) (His Excellency Eugene Rougon/ His Excellency)\n\nLa Curée (1871-2) (The Kill)\n\nL’Argent (1891) (Money)\n\nLe Rêve (1888) (The Dream)\n\nLa Conquête de Plassans (1874) (The Conquest of Plassans/A Priest in the House)\n\nPot-Bouille (1882) (Pot Luck/Restless House/Piping Hot)\n\nAu Bonheur des Dames (1883) (The Ladies’ Paradise/Shop Girls of Paris/Ladies’ Delight)\n\nLa Faute de l’Abbé Mouret (1875) (The Sin of Father Mouret/Abbe Mouret’s Transgression)\n\nUne Page d’amour (1878) (A Lesson in Love/A Love Episode/A Page of Love/A Love Affair)\n\nLe Ventre de Paris (1873) (The Belly of Paris/The Fat and the Thin/Savage Paris/The Markets of Paris)\n\nLa Joie de Vivre (1884) (The Joys of Living/Joy of Life/How Jolly Life Is/Zest for Life)\n\nL’Assommoir (1877) (The Dram Shop/The Gin Palace/Drink/Drunkard)\n\nL’Œuvre (1886) (The Masterpiece/A Masterpiece/His Masterpiece)\n\nLa Bête Humaine (1890) (The Beast in the Man/The Human Beast/The Monomaniac)\n\nGerminal (1885)\n\nNana (1880)\n\nLa Terre (1887) (The Earth/The Soil)\n\nLa Débâcle (1892) (The Downfall/The Smash-up/The Debacle)\n\nLe Docteur Pascal (1893) (Doctor Pascal)\n\nThe next one up was The Belly of Paris.\n\nOne reason I am reading this long series is that the books are available in ebook form for free from project Gutenberg. This is a good thing… a fantastic thing actually, but there is only one catch. The free, public-domain English Zola texts from Gutenberg are all contemporaneous translations by Henry Vizetelly (and his son Ernest Alfred Vizetelly). Now Vizetelly was a hero – he believed in the Zola books and paid a huge price for translating them and publishing them in England, however, the translations aren’t really all that good. They are written in an anachronistic language, hard on the modern eye, and, worst of all, are censored. The original French stories can be pretty racy and he had to cut the best parts out to get the books published in England. Still, he was prosecuted twice and imprisoned for obscene libel because of his translations of Zola’s work.\n\nBefore reading The Belly of Paris (also know as Une Page d’amour, The Fat and the Thin, Savage Paris, The Markets of Paris) I discovered that there was a modern translation by Mark Kurlansky. I have read two of his non-fiction books, Salt and Cod and really liked them. Salt in particular was very interesting to me, my first job out of college was working as a chemist at a salt mine and evaporation plant in Hutchinson, Kansas (the plant is gone now – but the mine is still working and you can take a tour).\n\nSo, I bought a copy of the Kurlansky translation and it was very good.\n\nThere is a plot arc to The Belly of Paris – Florent escapes from Devil’s Island (similar to the more famous modern story of Papillon) and returns to Paris. He spends the book trying to reestablish his life and struggling with his radical political leanings. This story is really a framing device to enable Zola to immerse the reader in the eponymous Belly of Paris. The Belly of Paris is the immense food market at Les Halles.\n\nConstructed in the 1850’s, Les Halles was a series of gigantic sheds full of stalls where every kind of food was sold – and Zola uses every excuse to tour every nook and cranny of the market – from vegetables to poultry, meat to fish, bread to spices, candy to charcuterie, the movement, preparation, and sale of every imaginable foodstuff is set down in detail. The people involved are hard working and full of human foibles – gossipy, jealous, and headstrong. These complex relationships form the real heart of the story and the conflict of the novel.\n\nImagine a huge city, a Paris of millions of (French, and food-obsessed) inhabitants that have to be fed, every day, in a world without gasoline, trucks, electricity or refrigeration. It starts in the dead of night with horse-drawn carts drawn to the city in caravans carrying the bounty of the countryside. The vegetables are prepared, the animals are slaughtered, the fish are cleaned, the salted meat is salted, the charcuterie is cured, the bread is baked – then everything is set out for sale as the population of Paris descends to buy their daily meals. Zola lays it all out in a fantastic kaleidoscope of food – sights, sounds, smells, and taste – and the characters that handle it.\n\nThe book is full of contrasts – the Fat and the Thin, Beautiful Lisa and The Beautiful Norman, political radical Florent and his comfortable brother. The Belly of Paris isn’t known as one of the series’ best – but I found it fascinating. Like The Ladies Paradise and modern retail I can’t help but compare the market at Les Halles with a modern Whole Foods or other mega grocery store.\n\nInteresting stuff. And now on to La Joie de Vivre.\n\nThe Conquest of Plassans\n\nFélicité kissed Marthe on the forehead as if the latter were still sixteen. She then extended her hand to Mouret. Their usual mode of conversation had a sharp edge of irony.\n\n‘Well,’ she asked with a smile, ‘have the police not been to arrest you yet, you old revolutionary?’\n\n‘Not yet,’ he replied, also with a laugh. ‘They are waiting until your husband gives them the order.’\n\n‘Oh, very funny, ‘ Félicité replied, her eyes blazing.\n\nMarthe appealed to Mouret with a pleading look; he had certainly gone too far. But he was off and there was no stopping him.\n\n—- Emile Zola, The Conquest of Plassans\n\nLooking back, I started in September of last year – started an ambitious reading project – I set out to read the whole Les Rougon-Macquart cycle by Émile Zola – all twenty books.\n\nI started out cranking through them with some regularity\n\nLa Fortune des Rougon (1871) (The Fortune of the Rougons) – on October 2, 2018\n\nSon Excellence Eugène Rougon (1876) (His Excellency Eugene Rougon/ His Excellency) – on October 16,2018\n\nLa Curée (1871-2) (The Kill) – On November 8, 2018\n\nL’Argent (1891) (Money) – on December 2, 2018\n\nLe Rêve (1888) (The Dream) – on December 5, 2018\n\nBut then, as I walked out of The Wild Detectives (bookstore, coffee, beer) near the end of December, I saw this sign:\n\nAnd that was all she wrote for Zola for three months. I fell into a group that met weekly and read Gravity’s Rainbow. That took up all my reading energies until the last week of March, when we finished and gave out trophies.\n\nThen, after that was finished, I suffered from some allergy-related conjunctivitis and discovered that the inability to see puts a serious crimp in ones reading schedule. But now, my eyes are full of acceptable levels of goo and I turn back into the Zola books. I didn’t really like the last one, The Dream, and am happy to report that this one, The Conquest of Plassans is back in line with most of the other books in the series.\n\nIt feels like a return to a comfortable home. Plus, while a twenty volume French series from about a century and a half ago doesn’t sound like light reading – compared to Gravity’s Rainbow... it’s like reading the Sunday Comics. Will be done with this one in a couple days.\n\nThe Dream (Le Reve) by Zola\n\n“The vision that had emerged from the invisible was returning to the invisible. It was no more an appearance that was fading away, having created an illusion. All is but a dream. And, at the peak of happiness, Angélique had vanished, in the faint breath of a kiss.”\n\n― Émile Zola, The Dream\n\nOk, for awhile now I’ve been working my way through Zola’s Rougon-Marquat 20 novel series of French life in the Second Empire – Reading them not in the order that they were written, but in the recommended reading order.\n\nNext is Le Rêve (The Dream). It is a complete departure from the other books in the Rougon-Marquat series. Instead of complex, realistic stories – it is the simple, yet fantastic, romantic tale of an orphan girl Angélique, that falls in love with a wealthy nobleman. She is a descendant of the Rougon family – providing the tenuous connection with the rest of the books. Angélique does suffer from the mental instability of her kin, which provides a window into her obsession with the saints and the idea of a perfect romance.\n\nI have to admit, though, I didn’t like the book very much. It starts out with a lot of promise, the young girl abandoned in the snow near a great cathedral in rural France – it’s a powerful image. But the story spends too many words in cataloging a parade of saints and the stories of The Golden Legend. It become tedious and not very interesting to a modern reader.\n\nIn doing research about the book, I did find something I really liked. There are a series of amazing illustrations for the novel by Carlos Schwabe. I was not familiar with the artist and looking around the web there are some really interesting stuff he’s done. I especially like the drawings he did for Baudelaire’s book of poetry, Les Fleurs du mal. Have to look into these some more."
