        "text": "“It will be an honour to lose to someone other than Jim Parsons for a change.”\n\n— Ricky Gervais, nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or a Movie for the “Derek” Special\n\n“Everyone at ‘House of Cards’ is thrilled by our nominations. Kevin, Robin and Michael were all on set when we found out. That triumvirate poured themselves into Season 3, along with all the folks behind the camera who make this show what it is. I’m especially happy for Michael Kelly. This is his first nomination and so well deserved. It’s always an honor to be recognized by our peers. It motivates us to keep making the show better. And congrats to Netflix for all its other nominations. We’re proud to be part of the Netflix family.”\n\n— Beau Willimon, showrunner of “House of Cards,” nominated in 11 categories including Best Drama Series\n\n“What great news! I am thankful to the Academy to receive this wonderful nomination and to be in such magnificent company. And to Ryan Murphy for the most extraordinary experience. Playing Elsa Mars this season was extremely special to me, and I am truly honored.”\n\n— Jessica Lange, nominated for Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her role in “American Horror Story: Freak Show”\n\n“I thrilled that ‘Shark Tank’ was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Structured Reality Program. We take such pride in promoting entrepreneurship and it’s incredible to see this show support the growth of small business in America. Congratulations to my fellow Sharks — Mark Cuban, Lori Greiner, Daymond John, Kevin O’Leary and Barbara Corcoran, the brilliant crew and production teams!”\n\n— Robert Herjavec of “Shark Tank,” nominated for Outstanding Structured Reality Program\n\n“Naturally I’m thrilled and delighted to be nominated again alongside Joanne Froggatt and that our eight nominations are a recognition of the wonderful work the whole team have put in to making the show.”\n\n— Jim Carter, nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his role in “Downton Abbey”\n\n“WOW! To be nominated again this year is truly an honor! ‘Fifth times the charm’ — is that how the saying goes? But really, I am just so happy to see my friends/colleagues/peers in the Outstanding Choreography category getting the well-deserved recognition. My routines, personally, mean a lot to me so to be recognized for something that I put my soul into is extraordinary. Plus I’m so stoked for my ‘So You Think You Can Dance’ family and our eight nominations this morning!”\n\n— Travis Wall, nominated for Outstanding Choreography for his work on “So You Think You Can Dance”\n\n“I am truly blown away at this nomination. I am grateful to Vince, Peter, and the writing staff. I also have to thank my amazing cast mates Jonathan Banks, Michael McKean, Michael Mando, Patrick Fabian and Rhea Seehorn because everyone raises everyone’s game. I promise to wear a tux to the ceremony. And, of course, thank you to the Academy!”\n\n— Bob Odenkirk, nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his role in “Better Call Saul”\n\n“Wow, I am so shocked, humbled and excited! ‘Downton’ is a true ensemble, cast and crew, and I am so proud of all the team. A huge thank you to the Television Academy for your support and for including me in this group of incredible actresses. I couldn’t be more thrilled!”\n\n— Joanne Froggat, nominated Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her role in “Downton Abbey”"
