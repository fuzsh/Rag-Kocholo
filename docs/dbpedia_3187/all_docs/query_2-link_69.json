        "text": "Any lingering doubts about Ricky Gervais's star wattage were extinguished yesterday when it was announced that a gaggle of A-list celebrities was queuing up to appear in his new sitcom, Extras.\n\nKate Winslet, Ben Stiller and Samuel L Jackson are among those who will feature alongside Gervais in his long-awaited follow-up to The Office, which won two Golden Globe awards in America last year.\n\nIn the new show, to be shown on BBC2 this summer, Gervais plays Andy Milman, a struggling actor who has given up his day job to pursue his dreams of movie stardom but with little success.\n\nIn the first episode - the only one yet filmed - Gervais's character has a bit part as a policeman.\n\nThe details about the new show were unveiled at BBC2's summer schedule launch yesterday.\n\nAmong other highlights are two new takes on the reality show genre: The Monastery, in which five laymen attempt to spend 40 days living with Benedictine monks, and How to Start Your Own Country, featuring the comedian Danny Wallace.\n\nGervais described his role in Extras as playing \"a grumpy and sarcastic character who hates being around actors and showbiz types, preferring to lie on my couch at home watching TV. It's a stretch, but I think I can pull it off\".\n\nHe added: \"Basically, this is my long-awaited new programme that some critics are already calling the disappointing follow-up to The Office.\" Appearing alongside him is the little-known Scottish actress Ashley Jenson, as a fellow struggling actor, while Gervais's co-writer Stephen Merchant plays Milman's agent.\n\nAmong the other established stars taking cameo roles are Ross Kemp, Vinnie Jones, the former footballer turned actor, and Les Dennis, the gameshow host.\n\nRoly Keating, who took over as controller of BBC2 last year, said Extras would be \"very different from The Office\".\n\nMr Keating also unveiled Joanna Lumley's first new sitcom for six years. The Absolutely Fabulous actress will star with Denis Lawson in Sensitive Skin, a black comedy about a successful couple in London, who \"struggle with sexual temptation, professional jealousy and their fear of the future\".\n\nThe participants in The Monastery were chosen because they had reached a crossroads in their lives and were seeking answers to \"bigger questions\"."
