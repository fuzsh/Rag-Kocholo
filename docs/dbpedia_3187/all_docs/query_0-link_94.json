        "text": "You can read more about this year in film here. The Best Picture race is discussed here, with reviews of all the nominees. First there are the categories, followed by all the films with their nominations, then the Globes, where I split the major awards by Drama and Comedy, followed by a few lists at the very end. If there’s a film you expected to see and didn’t, check the very bottom – it might be eligible in a different year. Films in red won the Oscar in that category (or Globe, in the Globes section). Films in blue were nominated. Films with an asterisk (*) were Consensus nominees (a scale I put together based on the various awards) while those with a double asterisk (**) were the Consensus winners.\n\nI’m listing the top 8 in the categories but only the top 5 earn Nighthawk nominations.\n\nNighthawk Awards:\n\nBest Picture\n\nTouch of Evil\n\nSmiles of a Summer Night\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof *\n\nNights of Cabiria\n\nThe Defiant Ones **\n\nVertigo\n\nDeath of a Cyclist\n\nMon Oncle\n\nAnalysis: There are those who will immediately turn away from this post because I put Vertigo in sixth place. But, while I rank Vertigo as a **** film, I have it on the lower edge of ****. The actual vertigo scenes don’t work very well for me and I think Kim Novak’s performance isn’t all that good. It’s just not the all-time great film to me that it is to so many others. Touch of Evil, on the other hand, is one of the greatest films ever made.\n\nYou may notice a lot of changes from my original Year in Film post. That’s because the Academy added their own database which lists official L.A. release dates (and thus, Oscar eligibility). That moved The Seventh Seal out of this year (which is good, because I hate having two films that earn a 99 in the same year), but it moved in Smiles of a Summer Night and Nights of Cabiria, and that’s what bump Vertigo out of the Top 5. There are only seven **** films – Mon Oncle is a high-level ***.5 film.\n\nBest Director\n\nOrson Welles (Touch of Evil)\n\nIngmar Bergman (Smiles of a Summer Night)\n\nRichard Brooks (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) *\n\nFederico Fellini (Nights of Cabiria)\n\nStanley Kramer (The Defiant Ones) *\n\nAlfred Hitchcock (Vertigo)\n\nJuan Antonio Bardem (Death of a Cyclist)\n\nJacques Tati (Mon Oncle)\n\nAnalysis: This is the fifth nomination and third win for Welles. He now has 360 points and is tied in third place with Hitchcock and Hawks. It’s the first nomination for the other four. It will be the only nomination for Kramer. Bergman, on the other hand, will be in the Top 10 within a decade.\n\nSmiles is an interesting film in Bergman’s history. It’s a comedy and very different from most of his work. But it’s also a big leap up from his previous work, taking the maturity from Sawdust and Tinsel and showing what he can really do with it, and paves the way for the classics that will be hitting the States in the next few years, as he will dominate the awards.\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay:\n\nTouch of Evil\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof *\n\nSeparate Tables *\n\nThe Horse’s Mouth *\n\nVertigo\n\nThérèse Raquin\n\nThe Last Hurrah\n\nThe Bravados\n\nAnalysis: Alec Guinness becomes that rare kind of nominee – an actor nominated for writing The Horse’s Mouth (who didn’t direct) – the same path that Emma Thompson would take to winning her Oscar in 1995. I actually don’t think Vertigo has that strong of a script but there wasn’t another film to really push it out. This is the third writing win for Welles (second in Adapted). I have, at this point, only read three of the source materials – Cat, Raquin and Last Hurrah, the last of which made my Top 200 list.\n\nBest Original Screenplay:\n\nSmiles of a Summer Night\n\nNights of Cabiria\n\nThe Defiant Ones **\n\nMon Oncle\n\nDeath of a Cyclist\n\nHigh Street\n\nThe Sheepman *\n\nAnalysis: I only have seven films on my whole list and five of them are foreign films. That just shows what kind of original scripts were coming out of Hollywood at the time. Given that the Academy had nominated Fellini two years before for La Strada and had given Best Foreign Film the year before to Nights, I’m a little surprised they nominated Houseboat and Teacher’s Pet rather than Nights. The same for Tati – the writers nominated him in 1955 and here he won Best Foreign Film but is passed over for his writing.\n\nThis makes three straight nominations for Fellini. It’s Bergman’s third nomination and first win, but he will go through the roof in the next two years.\n\nBest Actor:\n\nOrson Welles (Touch of Evil)\n\nPaul Newman (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) *\n\nAlec Guinness (The Horse’s Mouth)\n\nSidney Poitier (The Defiant Ones) *\n\nJames Stewart (Vertigo)\n\nTony Curtis (The Defiant Ones) *\n\nGunnar Bjornstrand (Smiles of a Summer Night)\n\nBurt Lancaster (Separate Tables)\n\nAnalysis: These are the first of many nominations for Newman and Poitier. This is the sixth nomination for Guinness, which moves him to 235 points and 11th place. This is the fifth nomination, but second win for Welles (he’s at 240 points and 10th place). Stewart now has six nominations (and two wins) and is tied for 5th with 280 points.\n\nThis is a very strong top 8, and it leaves out David Niven, who does give the best performance of his career in his Oscar-winning role in Separate Tables, but he still only makes it to 9th place on my list.\n\nBest Actress\n\nElizabeth Taylor (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) *\n\nEva Dahlbeck (Smiles of a Summer Night)\n\nGiuleta Masina (Nights of Cabiria)\n\nDeborah Kerr (Separate Tables)\n\nShirley MacLaine (Some Came Running)\n\nSimone Signoret (Thérèse Raquin)\n\nMaria Schell (Gervaise)\n\nSusan Strasberg (Stage Struck)\n\nAnalysis: These are the only nominations for Dahlbeck and Masina. This is Taylor’s first win, but her only other nomination will be her second win in 1966. This is the first nomination for MacLaine, but she will have a lot more. It’s the fourth nomination in the decade for Kerr (and eighth overall) and moves her to 340 points, ahead of Janet Gaynor, into 4th place, and just 10 behind Ingrid Bergman.\n\nThis is not nearly as strong a group as Best Actor. The top 4 are very solid (especially the top two), but there’s a drop after that, and yet another drop after Schell.\n\nBest Supporting Actor:\n\nBurl Ives (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof)\n\nLee J. Cobb (The Brothers Karamazov) *\n\nTheodore Bikel (The Defiant Ones) *\n\nArthur Kennedy (Some Came Running) *\n\nRobert Ryan (Lonelyhearts)\n\nBurl Ives (The Big Country) **\n\nMaurice Chevalier (Gigi) *\n\nChristopher Lee (Horror of Dracula)\n\nAnalysis: These are the only nominations for Ives and Bikel, the second for Ryan (who won his earlier nom) and third each for Cobb and Kennedy. Again, not nearly a strong group as the leads. Ives easily wins this. In a strong year, neither Kennedy or Ryan would have been nominated.\n\nBest Supporting Actress:\n\nHarriet Andersson (Smiles of a Summer Night)\n\nWendy Hiller (Separate Tables) **\n\nKay Walsh (The Horse’s Mouth) *\n\nMarlene Dietrich (Touch of Evil)\n\nMaria Schell (The Brothers Karamazov)\n\nCara Williams (The Defiant Ones) *\n\nHermione Gingold (Gigi)\n\nUlla Jacobson (Smiles of a Summer Night)\n\nAnalysis: This is the only nomination for Schell. It’s the third of four for Walsh. It’s the second nomination and the first of three wins for Andersson (one more for Supporting, one for lead). It’s the third for Hiller (she has a win for lead). It’s the second straight nom for Dietrich after a 33 year gap and moves her to 205 points and 7th place.\n\nDietrich is a tricky one here, and there will be more like her in future years. She really has a very short amount of screen time in Touch of Evil, but she is so good and her character is really quite key, with some major lines (“Your future’s all used up.”) and her great lines at the end of the film.\n\nBest Editing:\n\nTouch of Evil\n\nSmiles of a Summer Night\n\nDeath of a Cyclist\n\nThe Defiant Ones\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof\n\nNights of Cabiria\n\nMon Oncle\n\nVertigo\n\nAnalysis: On the one hand, Touch of Evil is brilliantly constructed. On the other hand, it was even more brilliantly constructed once they re-did the film according to Welles’ notes. Like with Ambersons, you can see how brilliant Welles was even when the studio was fucking around with him. The Defiant Ones is not only the only Oscar nominee in my Top 8, it’s the only nominee on my list at all (the Oscars gave the award to Gigi and then also nominated Auntie Mame, Cowboy and I Want to Live – a terrible group of nominees). Even in this category, where the average score to date is 34.6, these are bad choices (they earn a 15.6 from me).\n\nBest Cinematography:\n\nTouch of Evil\n\nVertigo\n\nDeath of a Cyclist\n\nSmiles of a Summer Night\n\nNights of Cabiria\n\nThe Defiant Ones\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof\n\nThérèse Raquin\n\nAnalysis: Smiles is the first of three nominations that Gunnar Fischer will earn working with Bergman. However, starting in 1960, Bergman will go with Sven Nykvist and that will be it for Fischer. Vertigo is the fourth nomination for Robert Burks (all with Hitchcock), which gets him up to 125 points and a tie for 4th place.\n\nTouch of Evil, of course, could deserve this award just for the first shot of the film, which goes on, unbroken for several minutes. But there’s also the other great work in the film, especially the work at the end of the film. And yes, Gigi won the Color Oscar while Vertigo wasn’t even nominated.\n\nBest Original Score:\n\nVertigo\n\nParash Pathar\n\nTouch of Evil\n\nNights of Cabiria\n\nThe 7th Voyage of Sinbad\n\nMon Oncle\n\nNight of the Demon\n\nCowboy\n\nAnalysis: Both Vertigo and Sinbad are composed by Bernard Herrmann. These are his first nominations since 1945 and move him into a tie for 3rd place, with 225 points. I may have some issues with the reputation of Vertigo, but the score is fantastic. The Parash Pathar score is by Ravi Shankar, who did great work composing for Satyajit Ray. The Old Man and the Sea, which won the Oscar, is the highest nominee on my list, coming in at #10.\n\nBest Sound:\n\nTouch of Evil\n\nThe Defiant Ones\n\nTorpedo Run\n\nRun Silent Run Deep\n\nThe Sheepman\n\nThe Bravados\n\nDeath of a Cyclist\n\nThe Tarnished Angels\n\nAnalysis: Vertigo is my #10, the only Oscar nominee on my list. This category, like Editing, is one in which I really don’t see eye to eye with the Academy, especially during this decade. The Tarnished Angels is based on the Faulkner novel Pylon – it’s not great, but as an airport film it’s got some great sound.\n\nBest Art Direction:\n\nSmiles of a Summer Night\n\nTouch of Evil\n\nGigi\n\nFrench Cancan\n\nHorror of Dracula\n\nNights of Cabiria\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof\n\nMon Oncle\n\nAnalysis: This one isn’t even close. Even the great sets in Touch of Evil can’t compare with Smiles. Gigi at least would win my Color award if I split them, so the Academy didn’t screw that one up (in this year, like 1957, the Black and White and Color were combined into one category for Art Direction and Costume Design).\n\nBest Visual Effects\n\nThe 7th Voyage of Sinbad\n\nTorpedo Run\n\nTom Thumb\n\nA Night to Remember\n\nAnalysis: The 7th Voyage of Sinbad is really a decent film, but it’s good splendid Ray Harryhausen effects and is a forerunner for the pure entertainment of Jason and the Argonauts. The visual effects for Sinbad are better than the other three films put together.\n\nBest Sound Editing\n\nTorpedo Run\n\nRun Silent Run Deep\n\nThe Defiant Ones\n\nThe Bravados\n\nThe 7th Voyage of Sinbad\n\nBest Costume Design:\n\nSmiles of a Summer Night\n\nGigi\n\nFrench Cancan\n\nThe Brothers Karamazov\n\nHorror of Dracula\n\nThe Red and the Black\n\nThe 7th Voyage of Sinbad\n\nTom Thumb\n\nAnalysis: Gigi really does have great costumes, so I won’t complain, and again, if I had a Color category, it would win. But I’m not sure how the costumes in A Certain Smile or Some Came Running made it on the Academy’s list rather than Brothers Karamazov.\n\nBest Makeup\n\nHorror of Dracula\n\nNights of Cabiria\n\nFrench Cancan\n\nAnalysis: I just love the gory makeup of Hammer Horror in all its glorious color.\n\nBest Original Song:\n\n“I Remember It Well” (Gigi)\n\n“Dixieland Rock” (King Creole)\n\n“King Creole” (King Creole)\n\n“Trouble” (King Creole)\n\n“To Love and Be Loved” (Some Came Running)\n\n“Tonka” (Tonka)\n\nAnalysis: “Gigi” won the Oscar, but I think it’s a terrible song. “Thank Heaven for Little Girls” was eligible, but it is so uber-creepy. But “I Remember It Well” is charming and funny and easily the best song in a year where the Elvis film didn’t have any great numbers. There were 175 songs listed at Oscars.org and I’ve seen 80 of them, with King Creole having the most (13).\n\nBest Animated Film:\n\nnone\n\nAnalysis: There’s not a single eligible Animated Film. There is one Foreign film, Panda and the Magic Serpent, but it will be in 1961.\n\nBest Foreign Film:\n\nThe Hidden Fortress\n\nElevator to the Gallows\n\nThe Magician\n\nIvan the Terrible Part II\n\nMon Oncle **\n\nCairo Station\n\nThe Music Room\n\nEnjo\n\nnote: Films in green were submitted to the Academy but not nominated.\n\nAnalysis: Only 10 films were submitted, of which I’ve seen 9. Four of them are *** films while Mon Oncle is a high-level ***.5 and easily deserved its win. Of course, as is obvious from my list, they blew it by not nominating The Magician or Cairo Station. So I blame Japan for not submitting The Hidden Fortress or Enjo (they submitted The Ballad of Narayama, which is mid-range *** and wasn’t nominated) and India for going with the mediocre Madhumati rather than the very good The Music Room. France passed over my #2 film for my #5 and won the Oscar, so they can be forgiven. The USSR was very unlikely to submit Ivan the Terrible given the long delay in its release and they didn’t submit anything.\n\nThis is a massive drop-off from the year before, of course, because 1957 is the best year in history for this category. But this is actually the third best year to date for both Top 5 and Top 10, behind only 1957 and 1955 (the next two films don’t make my list, because they’re only high-level ***, but they’re Ashes and Diamonds and Parash Pathar). This is Japan’s first win in four years. It’s the first time Sweden has had back-to-back nominations and the first time the Soviets have done that since 1929-30.\n\nKurosawa wins and Bergman comes in third; the next three times they face off Bergman will win and Kurosawa will come in second. Bergman is now tied with Marcel Carne for third place with 160 points. This is Eisenstein’s fourth, and of course, final nomination, as he died in 1948 and his film was only now escaping its ban.\n\nBy Film:\n\nnote: They’re in points order. You get twice as many points for a win as for a nomination. Hopefully your math skills will let you figure out the system.\n\nTouch of Evil (555)\n\nPicture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Actor, Supporting Actress, Editing, Cinematography, Original Score, Sound, Art Direction\n\nSmiles of a Summer Night (430)\n\nPicture, Director, Original Screenplay, Actress, Supporting Actress, Editing, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costume Design, Foreign Film (1955)\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof (325)\n\nPicture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Actor, Actress, Supporting Actor, Editing\n\nThe Defiant Ones (265)\n\nPicture, Director, Original Screenplay, Actor, Supporting Actor, Editing, Sound, Sound Editing\n\nNights of Cabiria (250)\n\nPicture, Director, Original Screenplay, Actress, Cinematography, Original Score, Makeup, Foreign Film (1957)\n\nVertigo (150)\n\nAdapted Screenplay, Actor, Cinematography, Original Score\n\nDeath of a Cyclist (110)\n\nOriginal Screenplay, Editing, Cinematography, Foreign Film (1955)\n\nThe Horse’s Mouth (105)\n\nAdapted Screenplay, Actor, Supporting Actress\n\nSeparate Tables (105)\n\nAdapted Screenplay, Actress, Supporting Actor\n\nThe 7th Voyage of Sinbad (85)\n\nOriginal Score, Visual Effects, Sound Editing\n\nTorpedo Run (80)\n\nSound, Visual Effects, Sound Editing\n\nSome Came Running (75)\n\nActress, Supporting Actor, Original Song\n\nThe Brothers Karamazov (75)\n\nSupporting Actor, Supporting Actress, Costume Design\n\nMon Oncle (60)\n\nOriginal Screenplay, Foreign Film\n\nHorror of Dracula (55)\n\nArt Direction, Costume Design, Makeup\n\nGigi (55)\n\nArt Direction, Costume Design, Original Song\n\nFrench Cancan (45)\n\nArt Direction, Costume Design, Makeup\n\nRun Silent Run Deep (40)\n\nSound, Sound Editing\n\nLonelyhearts (30)\n\nSupporting Actor\n\nKing Creole (30)\n\nOriginal Song, Original Song, Original Song\n\nParash Pathar (25)\n\nOriginal Score\n\nThe Sheepman (20)\n\nSound\n\nA Night to Remember (20)\n\nVisual Effects\n\nTom Thumb (20)\n\nVisual Effects\n\nThe Bravados (20)\n\nSound Editing\n\nAnalysis: At one point, The Seventh Seal was in this year and it was awful, because the awards were split between it and Touch of Evil. But with Smiles being stronger in other categories (and being Original), that allows for a more natural split. Gigi might set a points record to this date for a film that didn’t make the Top 100 on the year (it finished at #106).\n\nBest Film Not Nominated for Any Nighthawk Awards:\n\nThérèse Raquin\n\nAnalysis: A very good Zola adaptation from Marcel Carné that’s my #11 film of the year. It earns 6 Top 10 finishes and finishes in 6th twice (Adapted Screenplay, Actress) but just can’t get into the Top 5 anywhere. Two other ***.5 films also don’t earn any nominations: High Street and The Last Hurrah.\n\nBiggest Awards Film Not Nominated for Any Nighthawk Awards:\n\nI Want to Live!\n\nAnalysis: Nominated for 13 total awards and winner of 3, all for Best Actress (Oscar, Globe – Drama, NYFC). I don’t understand it at all. I think Hayward is okay (she is my #12 out of 13) but the direction and script (both of which managed Oscar nominations) are terrible. I think the film is quite bad (the lowest level **) and it ranks as my #139 on the year.\n\nNighthawk Golden Globes:\n\nDrama:\n\nBest Picture\n\nTouch of Evil\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof\n\nNights of Cabiria\n\nThe Defiant Ones\n\nVertigo\n\nBest Director\n\nOrson Welles (Touch of Evil)\n\nRichard Brooks (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof)\n\nFederico Fellini (Nights of Cabiria)\n\nStanley Kramer (The Defiant Ones)\n\nAlfred Hitchcock (Vertigo)\n\nAnalysis: This is Fellini’s only nomination for a Drama, while he’ll end up in the Top 10 of Comedy before too long (as opposed to Bergman – see below). It’s the third win and fifth nomination for Welles and the eighth nomination for Hitchcock, moving both of them up to 360 points and a tie for 3rd place (along with Wilder and Ford).\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay:\n\nTouch of Evil\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof\n\nSeparate Tables\n\nThe Horse’s Mouth\n\nVertigo\n\nBest Original Screenplay:\n\nNights of Cabiria\n\nThe Defiant Ones\n\nDeath of a Cyclist\n\nHigh Street\n\nThe Sheepman\n\nAnalysis: High Street is another film from Juan Antonio Bardem (who directed Death of a Cyclist). It’s hard to find, but is quite good. And again, Fellini wins here for Drama, where he’ll never get another nomination.\n\nBest Actor:\n\nOrson Welles (Touch of Evil)\n\nPaul Newman (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof)\n\nAlec Guinness (The Horse’s Mouth)\n\nSidney Poitier (The Defiant Ones)\n\nJames Stewart (Vertigo)\n\nAnalysis: Welles finally gets into the Top 10 in points, going up to 275 (2 wins, 6 total noms). Stewart is tied for 5th (280 points).\n\nBest Actress\n\nElizabeth Taylor (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof)\n\nGiuleta Masina (Nights of Cabiria)\n\nDeborah Kerr (Separate Tables)\n\nShirley MacLaine (Some Came Running)\n\nSimone Signoret (Thérèse Raquin)\n\nAnalysis: With her nomination, Deborah Kerr passes Janet Gaynor and moves into 3rd place in Drama points, behind only Bette Davis and Ingrid Bergman.\n\nBest Supporting Actor:\n\nBurl Ives (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof)\n\nLee J. Cobb (The Brothers Karamazov)\n\nTheodore Bikel (The Defiant Ones)\n\nArthur Kennedy (Some Came Running)\n\nRobert Ryan (Lonelyhearts)\n\nBest Supporting Actress:\n\nWendy Hiller (Separate Tables)\n\nKay Walsh (The Horse’s Mouth)\n\nMarlene Dietrich (Touch of Evil)\n\nMaria Schell (The Brothers Karamazov)\n\nCara Williams (The Defiant Ones)\n\nAnalysis: After not getting a Drama nomination since 1934, Dietrich is in for a second year (she was in the year before as lead). But that leaves her with 205 points and just out of a large tie in 10th place of 210 points.\n\nTouch of Evil (370)\n\nPicture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Actor, Supporting Actress\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof (300)\n\nPicture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Actor, Actress, Supporting Actor\n\nThe Defiant Ones (230)\n\nPicture, Director, Original Screenplay, Actor, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress\n\nNights of Cabiria (210)\n\nPicture, Director, Original Screenplay, Actress\n\nVertigo (170)\n\nPicture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Actor\n\nSeparate Tables (135)\n\nAdapted Screenplay, Actress, Supporting Actress\n\nThe Horse’s Mouth (105)\n\nAdapted Screenplay, Actor, Supporting Actress\n\nSome Came Running (65)\n\nActress, Supporting Actor\n\nThe Brothers Karamazov (60)\n\nSupporting Actor, Supporting Actress\n\nDeath of a Cyclist (40)\n\nOriginal Screenplay\n\nHigh Street (40)\n\nOriginal Screenplay\n\nThe Sheepman (40)\n\nOriginal Screenplay\n\nThérèse Raquin (35)\n\nActress\n\nLonelyhearts (30)\n\nSupporting Actor\n\nBest Drama Not Nominated for Any Nighthawk Golden Globes:\n\nThe Bravados\n\nAnalysis: A very good Western from Henry King, my #9 on the year, but unable to break through the more crowded Drama field in any category.\n\nComedy/Musical:\n\nBest Picture\n\nSmiles of a Summer Night\n\nMon Oncle\n\nAnalysis: An easy, easy winner. One of the greatest comedies ever made up against a year with almost nothing else. Mon Oncle is very good, but doesn’t quite break into **** for me.\n\nBest Director\n\nIngmar Bergman (Smiles of a Summer Night)\n\nJacques Tati (Mon Oncle)\n\nJean Renoir (French Cancan)\n\nAnalysis: Of course, Bergman’s only win in Comedy. I watched this film the first time on a weekend when I also saw Woody Allen’s Interiors for the first time. It was like the two directors had switched places. It’s the second of three nominations for Tati, which is impressive when you consider he only directed five films. It’s the second nomination for Renoir, but gets him into the Top 10 in Comedy points (with 135) because of the lack of dominating Comedy directors.\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay:\n\nParash Pathar\n\nMe and the Colonel\n\nAnalysis: Like with Bergman, it’s rare to have a Satyijat Ray comedy.\n\nBest Original Screenplay:\n\nSmiles of a Summer Night\n\nMon Oncle\n\nAnalysis: On the one hand, it sucks to only have two worthy nominees. On the other hand, it’s Bergman and Tati, so that’s about as good as you can get from only two nominees.\n\nBest Actor:\n\nGunnar Bjornstrand (Smiles of a Summer Night)\n\nHorst Buchholz (The Confessions of Felix Krull)\n\nDanny Kaye (Me and the Colonel)\n\nAnalysis: With a long career with Bergman, it’s nice for Bjornstrand to get in a comic performance. Buchholz gives maybe the best performance of his career and helped make himself a star in West Germany with his performance.\n\nBest Actress\n\nEva Dahlbeck (Smiles of a Summer Night)\n\nRosalind Russell (Auntie Mame)\n\nAnalysis: At least I can give Dahlbeck the win here, while she’s up against Liz as Maggie in the main category (when this film was in 1957, she was easily my winner). An interesting bit of trivia is that Russell never lost a Globe – in 5 nominations she had 5 wins. This is Russell’s fourth Comedy nom, getting her to 135 points and into 10th place.\n\nBest Supporting Actor:\n\nMaurice Chevalier (Gigi)\n\nAnalysis: Chevalier was actually nominated for Actor. He’s a bit disturbing when he sings his big song of course, but that doesn’t make his performance any less effective, just a bit creepy.\n\nBest Supporting Actress:\n\nHarriet Andersson (Smiles of a Summer Night)\n\nHermione Gingold (Gigi)\n\nUlla Jacobson (Smiles of a Summer Night)\n\nPeggy Cass (Auntie Mame)\n\nPoints: Like with Bjornstrand, Andersson would be a longtime Bergman stalwart and brilliant so often. Here, she gets to be several things she is usually not – supporting, comic and blonde (because she is blonde, for a long time I had it in my head that it was Bibi Andersson in this role).\n\nSmiles of a Summer Night (500)\n\nPicture, Director, Original Screenplay, Actor, Actress, Supporting Actress, Supporting Actress\n\nMon Oncle (135)\n\nPicture, Director, Original Screenplay\n\nGigi (90)\n\nSupporting Actor, Supporting Actress\n\nParash Pathar (80)\n\nAdapted Screenplay\n\nMe and the Colonel (75)\n\nAdapted Screenplay, Actor\n\nAuntie Mame (65)\n\nActress, Supporting Actress\n\nFrench Cancan (45)\n\nDirector\n\nThe Confessions of Felix Krull (35)\n\nActor\n\nAnalysis: Two films that fail to make the Top 100 (Gigi and Auntie Mame) both earn multiple nominations.\n\nBest Comedy Not Nominated for any Nighthawk Golden Globes:\n\nLaw and Disorder\n\nAnalysis: Solid comedy from Charles Crichton, the director of Lavender Hill Mob.\n\nRoundup for the Year in Film:\n\nEligible Films I Have Seen: 144\n\nBy Stars:\n\n****: 7\n\n***.5: 7\n\n***: 81\n\n**.5: 30\n\n**: 11\n\n*.5: 3\n\n*: 3\n\n.5: 2\n\nAverage Film Score for the Year, out of 100: 62.78\n\nAnalysis: There are the same number of films as in 1957, same number of films above ***, same number below *.5. But, there are four fewer *** films and two more ** and *.5 and that means a drop of almost a full point and the lowest overall average for a year to date.\n\nOscar-Nominated Films I Have Not Seen:\n\nnone\n\nOther Award Nominated Films I Have Not Seen (in descending order of points total):\n\nThat Night! (BAFTA – Picture, Foreign Actress – 1957)\n\nHarry Black and the Tiger (BAFTA – British Actor)\n\nnote: Another couple of BAFTA nominated films. Both of them would get official releases in the States this year but I haven’t been able to track down either one (the former hasn’t been found by many people – it has fewer than 40 votes on the IMDb).\n\nOscar Quality:\n\nBest Picture: This year ranks at #67. We have two great films that can’t break into the Top 100 (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Defiant Ones) and two films that rank below #440 (Auntie Mame, Gigi), with Separate Tables clearly in the middle. The average film is a 78.2, which ranks 61st, but the average rank is 298.8, which ranks 68th. But, this is not only the rare year where the Best Director lineup is actually worse then the Best Picture lineup, but the year where the Director lineup ranks the worst in comparison with the Picture lineup. By replacing Auntie Mame with The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, there isn’t a huge change (though it’s for the positive). But replacing Separate Tables, a very good film, with I Want to Live, a very low ranked ** film, it just plummets. The average film nominated for Best Director is a 69.4 and that 8.8 drop is the worst in history (and one of only five that have more than a 3 point drop).\n\nThe Winners: I think Gigi is a relentlessly mediocre film. Given that it swept the Oscars, that sets things up badly. The average winner ranks at 2.79 among the nominees, the worst since 1944. But that’s not all Gigi’s fault, since they chose badly in Actor, Actress and Supporting Actor, while Gigi’s Oscars for Art Direction and Costume Design were the best of the nominees. The Academy chose the worst Picture (first time since 1952 and only the second time since 1931), Adapted Screenplay (first time since 1939), Actress (first time since 1950, only second time to date) and Song (first time since 1953, second time to date). They also chose the 4th best in Director, Actor, Supporting Actor (namely because they picked the right actor but wrong film) and Musical Score. The overall acting score among the nominees is 3.5, the second worst to date (behind 1940).\n\nAmong all films, the Oscar winners are much worse. They average an 18.16, the worst since 1933 and the third worst to date. But that’s thrown way out of whack by having the 106th best film of the year chosen for Best Picture. Taking away Picture, the average winner ranks at 13.28, which is the worst to date. Neither Director nor Adapted Screenplay make my Top 50 of the year. Worse, for the first time since 1931 I don’t agree with a single winner. And only two Oscar winners even rank 2nd on my list (Supporting Actress and Costume Design). The acting is especially poor, averaging a 7.25, the third worst score to date.\n\nThe Nominees: Even the nominees weren’t good choices (how good was it going to be when my two biggest films of the year, Touch of Evil and Smiles of a Summer Night, went completely unnominated?). The overall score for the year is 41.1, the worst score since 1931. The major categories (Picture, Director, writing) earns a 40.5, the second worst score since 1942. The tech categories earn a 26.1, the worst score since 1934. Even the acting, at a decent 71.1, is the lowest score since 1947. The single best category in the year is Best Actor, with a 78.4, but even that is still one of the lower scores of the decade. The only other category to beat 70 is Best Actress, at 70.6, the second lowest score of the decade.\n\nGolden Globe Best Picture – Comedy / Musical: The Globes began a new idea this year, which would last for five years – separate categories for Best Picture – Comedy and Best Picture – Musical, though Actor and Actress would continue to be one category for both.\n\nThe Musical category couldn’t even be filled in this first year – there were only four nominees. What’s more, because there weren’t any great Musicals this year (or even very good ones), it’s filled with expected films that aren’t really worthy: Gigi, South Pacific, Tom Thumb (the best of the lot) and Damn Yankees. Without a single film in the Top 200, this ranks as the worst of this category, not just for Musicals, but for either, ranking 64th out of 64.\n\nThe Comedy category isn’t a drastic improvement, ranking 50th. None of the films ranks very high (three of them – The Perfect Furlough, Inspector General and Indiscreet all rank just above 200) and Auntie Mame, the winner, is the worst of the lot. The fifth nominee is Bell Book and Candle.\n\nOf course, given that the only two Comedies I nominate in my own awards are both Foreign films (which wouldn’t have been eligible for the Globes), there wasn’t much the Globes could do in this year.\n\nTop 5 Films of the Year:\n\n1 – Touch of Evil (reviewed here)\n\n2 – Smiles of a Summer Night (reviewed here)\n\n3 – Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (reviewed here)\n\n4 – Nights of Cabiria (reviewed here)\n\n5 – The Defiant Ones (reviewed here)\n\n5 Worst Films (#1 being the worst):\n\nQueen of Outer Space\n\nAttack of the 50 Foot Woman\n\nEarth vs. the Spider\n\nI Bury the Living\n\nSpace Children\n\nQueen of Outer Space (dir. Edward Bernds)\n\n“If [young writers] become enthusiastic, it’s about someone like Kurt Vonnegut, who is uncopyable. If they try to copy him, they’re in for a disaster.” Irwin Shaw said that, and I pull it from a wonderful little book called Fighting Words: Writers Lambast Other Writers – from Aristotle to Anne Rice. Now, that quote is in the book because can be viewed, ostensibly, as a swipe at Vonnegut. But I don’t think it really is. I think Shaw realizes that Vonnegut is a singularly great writer, and I use that word singularly on purpose. Many writers are great and you can learn to write like them, provided you have enough talent. Faulkner’s influence can be seen in Garcia Marquez, Morrison and McCarthy. You can see Hammett in Ellroy. Dickens lives on, in a more comic form, in John Irving. But Vonnegut’s style works only for him. If you try to write like Vonnegut, it becomes almost unreadable. I know, because I knew someone in grad school whose novel was clearly, massively influenced by Vonnegut and as a result, was an utter mess. Now, this not just a digression – it also has a point. In 1956, MGM released Forbidden Planet. It is one of the all-time great Science Fiction films, taking a Shakespeare plot and applying it to the Sci-Fi genre. The result was a great film, an adventure on another planet, with a great story and visual effects that earned an Oscar nomination (and deserved an Oscar). Before long, we had other movies in which a ship full of men were landing on other planets and getting into all sorts of troubles. And that’s where we get crap like Queen of Outer Space.\n\nNow, Forbidden Planet didn’t have top-notch talent. The director, Fred M. Wilcox didn’t have a great resume. Star Leslie Nielson would never be a great serious actor and co-star Walter Pidgeon was long past his prime of working with Greer Garson. Anne Francis was never much of an actress – just some eye candy for the man to fight over. But it was made by a major studio, it had a solid budget that made for some fascinating visual effects (some of its effects would inspire both Star Trek and the Tom Baker Doctor Who serial “Planet of Evil”). It had a great story that worked well enough for its cast. But, most of all, it overcame its shortcomings in the acting and directing department, for all the pieces to work together and create the best Sci-Fi film to be released between Metropolis and 2001.\n\nQueen of Outer Space has nothing that going for it. It has what isn’t a terrible premise (a ship of humans crash-lands on Venus, where they find a planet where men have been banished and women are ruled by a cruel dictator). It could have made for a decent episode of Star Trek. But they don’t manage to do anything with it. The direction, by Edward Bernds, is pretty awful (he worked a lot in low budget). The stars of the film are Eric Fleming (soon to become a star on Rawhide), as the captain of the ship and he is just simply awful. The female star is Zsa Zsa Gabor, and while she might have been beautiful once, she never could act and she’s particularly bad here. She makes Anne Francis look like an Oscar nominee (don’t be deceived by the length of her outfit in the poster – the outfits are pretty skimpy, following again from Forbidden Planet where Francis didn’t have much on). Because, unlike Forbidden Planet, this isn’t from a major studio (it’s from Allied Artists, which grew out of the low budget Monogram). So there’s nothing worthwhile in the way of special effects and no talent in the editing or cinematography.\n\nThe lesson to be learned here is that sometimes flukes happen. Sci-Fi suddenly became a bigger deal in the 50’s, partially because of the space race. But most Sci-Fi films from the decade are really pretty bad. I’ve seen 34 Sci-Fi films from the decade (as opposed to 8 made before 1950). They average a 45.2, or a mid-range ** film. But if you take out three films – Forbidden Planet, The Thing from Another World and The Day the Earth Stood Still, you get 31 films that average a 41.5. It’s just a terrible decade for Sci-Fi films, so just avoid them and move, with a few exceptions (2001, The Time Machine, Fantastic Voyage) straight on to 1977.\n\nPoints:\n\nMost Nighthawk Nominations: Touch of Evil / Smiles of a Summer Night (10)\n\nMost Nighthawk Awards: Touch of Evil (7)\n\nMost Nighthawk Points: Touch of Evil (555)\n\nWorst Film Nominated for a Nighthawk Award: Gigi\n\n2nd Place Award: Smiles of a Summer Night (Picture, Director, Actress, Editing)\n\n6th Place Award: The Defiant Ones (Actor, Supporting Actress, Cinematography)\n\nMost Nighthawk Drama Nominations: Cat on a Hot Tin Roof / The Defiant Ones (6)\n\nMost Nighthawk Drama Awards: Touch of Evil (4)\n\nMost Nighthawk Drama Points: Touch of Evil (370)\n\nWorst Film Nominated for a Nighthawk Drama Award: The Brothers Karamazov\n\nMost Nighthawk Comedy Nominations: Smiles of a Summer Night (7)\n\nMost Nighthawk Comedy Awards: Smiles of a Summer Night (6)\n\nMost Nighthawk Comedy Points: Smiles of a Summer Night (500)\n\nWorst Film Nominated for a Nighthawk Comedy Award: Gigi\n\nNote: * means a Nighthawk record up to this point; ** ties a Nighthawk record\n\nProgressive Leaders:\n\nMost Nighthawk Nominations: The Wizard of Oz (18)\n\nMost Nighthawk Awards: The Wizard of Oz (14)\n\nMost Nighthawk Points: The Wizard of Oz (795)\n\nMost Nighthawk Awards without winning Best Picture: Frankenstein / The Magnificent Ambersons (6)\n\nMost Nighthawk Nominations without a Best Picture Nomination: Captain Blood / Henry V (10)\n\nMost Nighthawk Nominations without a Nighthawk Award: My Man Godfrey (11)\n\nActor: Humphrey Bogart (475)\n\nActress: Bette Davis (555)\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder (450)\n\nWriter: Billy Wilder (760)\n\nCinematographer: Arthur Edeson / Gregg Toland (200)\n\nComposer: Max Steiner (450)\n\nForeign Film: Akira Kurosawa (320)\n\nBreakdown by Genre (Foreign in parenthesis, best film in genre following, avg. score is afterwards, in parenthesis):\n\nDrama: 51 (16) – Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (66.3)\n\nForeign: 34 – Smiles of a Summer Night (70.7)\n\nComedy: 24 (7) – Smiles of a Summer Night (64.8)\n\nHorror: 16 (2) – The Horror of Dracula (48.3)\n\nWestern: 12 – The Bravados (64.1)\n\nWar: 10 (1) – Run Silent Run Deep (65.5)\n\nMusical: 10 (4) – French Cancan (62.9)\n\nSci-Fi: 6 – It!

I’ve seen as many Horror films in 1958 as I did in the entire 1940’s. That’s in part due to Hammer and in part due to the rise of cheap indies. There is also a rise in Comedies (the most in one year to date) and a drop in Dramas (they only account for 35.6% of the films, the lowest since 1943). But the rise of cheap indies mean a lot of terrible Horror and Sci-Fi films; outside of those two genres, the year averages a 65.9, a rise of over three points.\n\nTouch of Evil becomes the first Mystery to win my Best Picture since 1934. The Foreign Films take a bigger piece of the top pie – they account for half of the top 20 for the first time.\n\nStudio Note: For the first time since the combined year of 1912-26, United Artists has the most films, with 18 (its high for one year). In second place, with 15, is Warner Bros, making this the first year since 1947 and only the third year overall where neither MGM nor Fox is in the top two. With no RKO films, the overall percentage from the remaining major studios is 63.6%, the third lowest to date. But, for the first time, I’ve seen 3 Disney films (Stage Struck, The Proud Rebel, Tonka), especially surprising since their isn’t an animated film. I’ve only seen 11 20th Century-Fox films, the lowest number for me since 1946.\n\nIt’s a bad year for the majors. Only Universal and Disney average over a 65, Warners has its lowest average since 1934 (60.4) and United Artists (60.3) and Paramount (56.6) have their lowest averages to date. Warners’ best film is #40 (Indiscreet) and Vertigo is the only Paramount film in the Top 45. Only two studios have multiple films in the Top 20 – MGM has two and United Artists has 3. Universal wins Best Picture for the first time since 1930.\n\nTwo of the independent studios start to have a lot more films: Allied Artists and American International Pictures. Unfortunately their films are terrible. I’ve seen three from the former and four from the latter and those seven films average a 29. Without these films, the average for the year goes up almost two points.\n\n42 Films Eligible for Best Foreign Film (alphabetical, with director and country in parenthesis – red are ****, blue are ***.5 – both those colors qualify for my Best Foreign Film Award; an asterisk means it was the Official selection for the Oscar, two asterisks were nominated, three asterisks won the Oscar):\n\nAjantrik (Ghatak, India)\n\nAren’t We Wonderful (Hoffmann, West Germany)\n\nArms and the Man (Wirth, West Germany) **\n\nAshes and Diamonds (Wajda, Poland)\n\nThe Ballad of Narayama (Kinoshita, Japan) *\n\nBig Deal on Madonna Street (Monicelli, Italy) **\n\nBrink of Life (Bergman, Sweden)\n\nCairo Station (Chahine, Egypt) *\n\nChalta Ka Naam Gaadi (Bose, India)\n\nThe Cheaters (Carne, France)\n\nElevator to the Gallows (Malle, France)\n\nEnjo (Ichikawa, Japan)\n\nEquinox Flower (Ozu, Japan)\n\nEroica (Munk, Poland)\n\nGiants & Toys (Masumura, Japan)\n\nThe Good Soldier Svejk: Beg to Report, Sir (Czechoslovakia)\n\nThe Great Moment (Santoa, Brazil)\n\nThe H-Man (Honda, Japan)\n\nHercules (Francisci, Italy)\n\nThe Hidden Fortress (Kurosawa, Japan)\n\nThe Idiot (Pyryev, USSR)\n\nInspector Maigret (Delannoy, France)\n\nIvan the Terrible Part II (Eisenstein, USSR)\n\nThe Last Day of Summer (Konwicki, Poland)\n\nLe Beau Serge (Chabrol, France)\n\nLes Miserables (Le Chanois, France)\n\nLove is My Profession (Autant-Lara, France)\n\nThe Lovers (Malle, France)\n\nMadhumati (Roy, India) *\n\nThe Magician (Bergman, Sweden) *\n\nMia zoi tin ehoume (Javellas, Greece)\n\nMon Oncle (Tati, France) ***\n\nThe Music Room (Ray, India)\n\nOn a Small Island (Vulchanov, Bulgaria)\n\nPanda and the Magic Serpent (Yabushita, Japan)\n\nParash Pathar (Ray, India)\n\nThe Road a Year Long (De Santis, Yugoslavia) **\n\nRosaura at 10 O’Clock (Soffici, Argentina)\n\nRusty Knife (Masuda, Japan)\n\nTwo Eyes, Twelve Hands (Shantaram, India)\n\nThe Vampire’s Coffin (Mendez, Mexico)\n\nLa Venganza (Bardem, Spain) **\n\nNote: Both France and Japan have 8 films each, a new high for any country in any single year. There are also new highs for India (6) and Poland (3) and the first film from Bulgaria. Hercules is the first Fantasy film since 1950 while Inspector Maigret and Rosaura at 10 O’Clock are the first Mysteries since 1939. There are also 4 Musicals, the most since 1949. The 42 total films are a new high for one year but it’s nothing compared to what will come in the 60’s.\n\nForeign Films Submitted for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars That I Haven’t Seen:\n\nDenmark: Dollars from the Sky (dir. Axel)\n\nnote: At this point I am making a concerted effort to see as many submitted films as I can. Only 10 films were submitted in 1958 and this is the only one I haven’t seen. Annoyingly, it’s from Denmark, which also provided one of the three I haven’t seen from 1957.\n\nFilms Eligible in This Year But Originally Released in a Different Calendar Year:\n\nWe Are All Murderers (1952)\n\nTherese Raquin (1953)\n\nFear (1954)\n\nThe Red and the Black (1954)\n\nBeautiful but Dangerous (1955)\n\nDeath of a Cyclist (1955)\n\nFrench Cancan (1955)\n\nMiracle of Marcelino (1955)\n\nSmiles of a Summer Night (1955)\n\nThe Captain of Kopenick (1956)\n\nCrazed Fruit (1956)\n\nGervaise (1956)\n\nA Man Escaped (1956)\n\nSamurai III: Duel at Ganryu Island (1956)\n\nAcross the Bridge (1957)\n\nAll at Sea (1957)\n\nBitter Victory (1957)\n\nBlood of Dracula (1957)\n\nThe Confessions of Felix Krull (1957)\n\nHell Drivers (1957)\n\nHigh Street (1957)\n\nLafayette Escandrille (1957)\n\nLovers of Paris (1957)\n\nNight Ambush (1957)\n\nNight of the Demon (1957)\n\nNights of Cabiria (1957)\n\nThe Smallest Show on Earth (1957)\n\nThe Vampire (1957)\n\nWindom’s Way (1957)\n\nNote: This list averages a 69 and includes three of the top 7 films of the year.\n\nFilms Not Listed at Oscars.org:\n\nAjantrik\n\nLe Beau Serge\n\nCarve Her Name with Pride\n\nChalta Ka Naam Gaadi\n\nGiants & Toys\n\nThe Good Soldier Svejk: Beg to Report, Sir\n\nThe Great Moment\n\nHigh Street\n\nThe Last Day of Summer\n\nMadhumati\n\nMiracle of Marcelino\n\nOn a Small Island\n\nParash Pathar\n\nThe Road a Year Long\n\nRosaura at 10 O’Clock\n\nRusty Knife\n\nTarzan and the Trappers\n\nTwo Eyes, Twelve Hands\n\nThe Vampire\n\nThe Vampire’s Coffin\n\nNote: I use the list at Oscars.org for deciding which year films are eligible in. For some films, however, they don’t appear in that database. For those films, I use the IMDb. These are the films that aren’t listed in the Oscars.org database but that end up in this year.\n\nTwo of these films I found confirmed U.S. release dates (Miracle of Marcelino, The Vampire). The rest of them are 1958 films, almost all of which seem not to have had an official U.S. release (certainly not an Oscar eligible one). All of them are Foreign language films except Carve (which is British) and Tarzan (originally made for television but apparently re-edited and released as a feature film).\n\nFilms Released This Year Originally But Eligible in a Different Year:\n\nBrink of Life (1959)\n\nThe H-Man (1959)\n\nHercules (1959)\n\nInspector Maigret (1959)\n\nIntent to Kill (1959)\n\nLes Miserables (1959)\n\nLook Back in Anger (1959)\n\nLove is My Profession (1959)\n\nThe Lovers (1959)\n\nMurder by Contract (1959)\n\nThe Naked Maja (1959)\n\nOrders to Kill (1959)\n\nThe Perfect Furlough (1959)\n\nPork Chop Hill (1959)\n\nRally Round the Flag Boys (1959)\n\nLa Venganza (1959)\n\nAren’t We Wonderful (1960)\n\nThe Captain’s Daughter (1960)\n\nCarlton-Browne of the F.O.
