        "text": "Kate Winslet led the early winners at the Golden Globes on Sunday as an unapologetic Ricky Gervais kicked off the glitzy ceremony by taking shots at some of Hollywood's biggest names.\n\nWinslet was visibly shocked as she won best supporting actress for her role as Joanna Hoffman in biopic \"Steve Jobs,\" saying she was \"extremely surprised and overwhelmed.\"\n\n\"What an incredible year for women in film, these categories are so crowded and crammed with incredible skill and integrity and I feel prouder than ever to be included this year,\" the British actress said.\n\nGervais, returning to host for the fourth time, riled up the audience with his opening monologue, calling the audience \"disgusting, pill-popping, sexual deviant scum.\"\n\nHe directed his acerbic tongue towards Sean Penn, Jeffrey Tambor, Matt Damon, Jennifer Lawrence and Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nHe praised Jenner for being a transgender role model before quickly quipping \"She didn't do a lot for women drivers. But you can't have everything, can you?\" referring to Jenner's Malibu car crash last year.\n\nHe took a swipe at Lawrence's essay on why women aren't being equally paid as men in Hollywood, saying \"How the hell can a 25-year-old live on $52 million?\"\n\nGervais also joked that he was earning what Tina Fey and Amy Poehler combined earned when they hosted the Globes last year. \"It's not my fault if they want to share the money,\" he said.\n\nAmazon's musical show \"Mozart in the Jungle\" was the surprise winner of best TV comedy series and \"My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\" newcomer Rachel Bloom took home the award for best comedy TV actress over favorite Julia Louis-Dreyfus.\n\nMaura Tierney won best supporting TV actress for her role in Showtime's \"The Affair.\"\n\nOrganized and voted for by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Globes serve up free-flowing champagne, allowing stars to let their hair down and relax.\n\nThe top awards for film will be announced at the end of the three-hour show.\n\nA win by Leonardo DiCaprio for his rugged turn in pioneer tale \"The Revenant\" could foreshadow a long-sought best actor Oscar. The night could also mint emerging talent like actresses Brie Larson and twice-nominated Alicia Vikander.\n\nRelated:"
