He’s won two Academy Awards and three Golden Globes for his powerful and varied performances, starring in such films as Philadelphia, Forrest Gump, Castaway, Apollo 13 and Saving Private Ryan. The other... is Tim Allen.”\n\nExplaining why he regretted the jab, Gervais said he believes Allen “took it wrong”.\n\nGolden Globes: All the night's winners, in pictures\n\nShow all 25\n\nAllen has now explained he simply did not understand the joke, saying it fell “flat”.\n\n“Perhaps I didn’t get it,” he told Page Six. “I wasn’t the only one. Tom and I even said [at the time]: ‘I didn’t really get it. It’s like he didn’t finish the joke. It just went flat.’ Later that night he said, ‘It didn’t go so well.’ He kind of apologised.”\n\nInsisting there was “no malice” behind his joke, Gervais said: “I have nothing against Tim Allen. He’s a good actor. He’s probably a nice bloke.”\n\nRead the full Golden Globes winners list here, and you can find a recap of all of the best jokes made by Gervais at this year's ceremony here.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
