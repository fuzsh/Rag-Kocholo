        "text": "by Nathaniel R\n\n1956 is not, from our vantage point, a particularly lauded year in cinema but it's an Oscar field we tend to think of regularly for various reasons including but not limited to:\n\n-Camp value (Ten Commandments, Bad Seed)\n\n-Musicals (The King and I, High Society)\n\n-Strange snubs (The Searchers received zero nominations despite Oscar's obsession with John Ford)\n\n-Delayed foreign grandeur (La Strada and Seven Samurai, 1954 films both, were up for Oscars)\n\n-not one but two kaiju movies (Godzilla and Rhodan)...and more.\n\nWhat's your favorite movie of 1956? I don't think I've seen enough to feel comfortable with a full top ten but here are the five I like best currently (with much more to see) after the jump...\n\n01 Written on the Wind (Douglas Sirk)\n\nEvery single performance is a keeper, not just Oscar winning Dorothy Malone's go for broke randiness. Every single color, and there are so many of them, is an eyeful. I get as drunk on the movie as Robert Stack gets inside the movie because Sirk was on fire in the 1950s.\n\n02 Giant (George Stevens)\n\nWhat a year for Rock Hudson, eh? I've been meaning to rewatch this one for the longest time. Despite my aversion to long movies (and this one is 3 hours plus) I remember being enthralled. It lives up to its title not just in the running time but in the star wattage assembled: HUDSON. TAYLOR. DEAN. MINEO. MCCAMBRIDGE. Plus P.T. Anderson loves it.\n\n03 The King and I (Walter Lang)\n\nSentimental favorite and I'm gaga for everything Yul Brynner in the mid 50s. Though, yes, I know it's \"problematic\"\n\n04 The Court Jester (Melvin Frank and Norman Panama)\n\nBecause: delightful.\n\nSOME COOL AWARDS TRIVIA FOR YOU: both Danny Kaye AND Yul Brynner lost the comedy/musical Golden Globe that year to Around the World in 80 Days' Cantinflas. Cantinflas did not receive an Oscar nomination and the Golden Globe winner in Drama Kirk Douglas in Lust for Life couldn't fend off Yul Brynner mania at the Oscars. What's more the Golden Globe supporting actor winner wasn't nominated for an Oscar and their choice for Supporting Actress lost. So it's one of those years when the majority of acting winners at the Golden Globes did not repeat at the Oscars. The only repeat winner was Ingrid Bergman for Anastasia and she was not present at either awards ceremony.\n\n05 Bus Stop (Joshua Logan)\n\nI grew up understanding that this was the consensus on Marilyn Monroe's best performance. I don't know if it still is but she's wonderful in it. I'd place it below Some Like It Hot (the pinnacle) but maybe fighting for second or third place with The Misfits and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Maybe.\n\nRUNNER UP\n\nSomebody Up There Likes Me (Robert Wise)\n\nWrote about this one here a few years back, so it's fresh in the memory. Recency bias, perhaps, but I like it and it's an amazing document of Paul Newman approaching his impending legend without quite being PAUL NEWMAN yet.\n\nI was already going to movies in 1956 and first saw and loved several of these when they were new. So here's some senior input.\n\nMy favorites (arranged alphabetically) *couldn't get it down to less than twelve\n\nBACK FROM ETERNITY-plane crash survivors in the jungle; John Farrow (Mia's father) remakes (and vastly improves) one of his 30's films; that picture's title was annoyingly spoilerish so I won't name it; the '56 version boasts a great bread and butter cast from the era (Robert Ryan, Anita Ekberg, Rod Steiger,Phyllis Kirk,Keith Andes,Fred Clark,Jon Provost,Adele Mara, Beulah Bondi)\n\nTHE BEAST OF HOLLOW MOUNTAIN-pretty unusual cowboy vs. dinosaur premise; Guy Madison and Patricia Medina sprinkle plenty of programmer stardust amid fantastic Mexican locations, sweepingly photographed in hyper-color. And that's before the dino even makes his entrance. Now available in a top quality Blu-Ray\n\nBIGGER THAN LIFE- Did James Mason ever give a bad performance? He's wonderful here as a man whose mental state soars and shatters via cortisone addiction; great support from Barbara Rush\n\nTHE CATERED AFFAIR-uncharacteristic kitchen sink drama from MGM - with terrific work from Ernest Borgnine, Bette Davis and Debbie Reynolds (as father, mother and daughter in the Bronx)\n\nTHE CREATURE WALKS AMONG US-the second sequel to \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" - and the best of the lot. Saturday matinee icons Jeff Morrow and Rex Reason star. And I still find it unexpectedly moving - with a great ending.\n\nDAKOTA INCIDENT-familiar set-up (disparate passengers on a stagecoach journey enlivened by seasoned, committed work from Dale Robertson,Linda Darnell, Ward Bond; among the best (and practically the last) of the Republic westerns\n\nGERVAISE-splendidly grim Rene Clement version of a Zola novel; still powerful - and Maria Schell's lead performance is one for the ages\n\nHELEN OF TROY-can't be objective about Robert Wise's big budget take on the Trojan War; my joint crush on Rossana Podesta and Jacques Sernas still hasn't abated\n\nTHE KING AND FOUR QUEENS-if you're a western fan and an actressexual (I'm both), this Clark Gable film is a must. Famous Eleanor Parker and not so famous Jean Willes are both terrific. Plus there's Jo Van Fleet, the under-rated Sara Shane and marvelous Barbara Nichols\n\nTHE SEARCHERS-the years have been kind to this now acknowledged masterpiece. Wayne's perfectly cast but so many of those around him (Jeffrey Hunter, Ward Bond, Hank Worden, Henry Brandon) are also memorable. And Natalie Wood's so worth searching for.\n\nSEVEN MEN FROM NOW-first of the great Budd Boetticher/Randolph Scott collaborations; about as close to perfection as westerns get. Lee Marvin's exceptional. And how did Boetticher get that beautiful performance out of Gail Russell?\n\nTHE TEN COMMANDMENTS-Cecil B. DeMille never did his thing quite as splendidly as he does here. Grand scale spectacle, with a script that frequently turns peplum pulp into poetry. Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter and Sir Cedric Hardwicke are all sublimely entertaining.\n\nMy top films of the year:\n\n1. Around the World in Eighty Days - I know that a lot of people criticise this Best Picture choice. It's worth remembering it wasn't just Oscar that went for it; it also won at the Golden Globes (Drama, evem if Cantinflas's performance came in the Comedy category), the National Board of Review and the New York Film Critics. I suspect they were all astonished by its epic sizzle. It may have been a \"you had to be there\" moment. But for me, this is a great movie, an enduring Best Picture choice, and a film that entertains on every viewing. (I see it probably once every 2-3 years.) It's also a great adaptation of the novel, and, like Phileas Fogg, it manages a perfect balance between urgency and relaxation: the suspense - the ticking clock - never lets up, but along the way, it offers so much that pleases the eye, the ear and the heart. I love it.\n\n2. Il ferroviere (The Railroad Man)\n\n3. The Man Who Knew Too Much\n\n4. Forbidden Planet\n\n5. Rebel Without a Cause\n\n6. Moby Dick\n\n7. Lust for Life\n\n8. The Searchers\n\n9. High Society\n\n10. The King and I\n\n11. The Ten Commandments\n\nI love this year in film and think there is a ton of very worthwhile films but it is also the year that the worst Best Picture winner ever was crowned. There have been other terrible films awarded but none as empty and LONG as the headache inducing Around the World in 80 Days. Just UGH!\n\nOn to happy things: Terrific list and some of those make my list as well but even the ones that don't are highly entertaining.\n\nAs far as Marilyn Monroe's best performance I'm with you that Some Like It Hot is the pinnacle with Gentleman Prefer Blondes a razor thin runner-up but she's terrific as well in Niagara, Don't Bother to Knock and The Misfits all performances that I like more than the one in Bus Stop though it is also solid work.\n\nMy top 10 in order of preference with a load of runner-ups just behind:\n\nThe Searchers-How was this totally shut out? The Duke should have had a nomination and in opinion the win along with multiple others for the film.\n\nWritten on the Wind-The cinematography, the camera movement, Sirk's firm hand and most of all Dorothy Malone!!\n\nThe Court Jester-Delightful, sweet, laugh out loud funny, Glynis Johns, Mildred Natwick and Angela Lansbury.\n\nCome Next Spring-Nice piece of Americana with two superlative performances at its core by Steve Cochran and Ann Sheridan who would be my pick for the Best Actress Oscar.\n\nThe Solid Gold Cadillac-A completely irresistible Judy Holliday as a stockholder who takes on big business.\n\nCarousel-Rodgers and Hammerstein's dark meditation on love with Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones in glorious voice.\n\nThe Man Who Knew Too Much-Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day make it special.\n\nThe Opposite Sex-The original The Women is better but I find this one very entertaining and it's a great cast.\n\nThe Ten Commandments-Absurd fun with still impressive effects.\n\nThree Violent People-Lady with a past Anne Baxter fights carpetbaggers and bad seed brother-in-law Tom Tryon alongside new hubby Charlton Heston in post Civil War Texas\n\nRunner-ups-Anastasia, The Bad Seed, The Bottom of the Bottle, The Catered Affair, Full of Life, Giant, The Harder They Fall, High Society, Hilda Crane, Joe Macbeth, The Killing, The King and I, Patterns, The Price of Fear, Seven Men from Now, Sissi-The Young Empress, There's Always Tomorrow, A Town Like Alice and While the City Sleeps"
