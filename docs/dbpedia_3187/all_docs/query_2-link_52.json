        "text": "Branded as “the biggest party of the year” by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globe Awards are traditionally viewed as the fun, slightly tipsy cousin of Hollywood’s awards show circuit.\n\nThat didn’t lessen the delight of the team behind the night’s biggest winner, The Revenant, which won a fleet of top prizes: awards for director Alejandro González Iñárritu, star Leonardo DiCaprio, and the top award of the night: best dramatic motion picture.\n\nWith a three-course dinner, free-flowing champagne and famously outré hosts, the Golden Globe Awards are a chance for the biggest stars of film and television to let their hair down, rip shots with Amy Schumer and take a selfie with Gael García Bernal – after all, it’s not like it’s the Oscars – and a chance for the viewing public to watch overserved celebrities embarrass themselves on live television.\n\nThis year’s awards were no exception, largely due to the antics of host Ricky Gervais, whose antics at the 68th annual Golden Globes in 2011 lead to über-producer and Hollywood kingmaker Harvey Weinstein threatening to have him killed. From the show’s opening monologue, in which Gervais targeted Caitlyn Jenner, worst-film-ever contender Pixels and the rest of the “disgusting, pill-popping, sexually deviant scum” assembled in the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton Hotel, to his deliciously uncomfortable introduction of Mel Gibson, LaLaLand’s bête noire left Hollywood’s biggest stars gasping in shock, delight and outrage.\n\nTo be fair, Gervais, who predicted that his return would make him “a bigger target than El Chapo”, did warn them:\n\nAs presenter Amy Adams told Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet: “I don’t think [Gervais] goes away for a couple of years and comes back without something to say.”\n\nEven the head of the body in charge of the awards didn’t escape a barb. “The Golden Globes doesn’t have an In Memoriam section to get you all depressed,” Gervais said. “Instead, we let the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press say a few words.”\n\n“Thank you for your support,” deadpanned Theo Kingma, the president in question.\n\nPersonal scandals were a rich comedic vein, cheerfully mined. At one point, Gervais recalled the travails of actor Charlie Sheen, whom Gervais had targeted in his much-ballyhooed monologue at the 2011 Golden Globes. “Joy and Trainwreck,” Gervais said, introducing two nominees, which he noted were “not the names of Charlie Sheen’s two favorite hookers”.\n\nHe also introduced nominee Matt Damon as “the only person that Ben Affleck hasn’t been unfaithful to”. Damon, a longtime friend of the recently single Affleck, could barely keep himself together when he introduced best motion picture, musical or comedy nominee The Martian.\n\nThe high point of Gervais’ hosting may have been his introduction of the long-dormant Mel Gibson, whose alcohol-fueled anti-Semitic tirade in 2006 provided an entire awards season’s worth of fodder for the comedian. “I’m sure it’s embarrassing for both of us, and I blame NBC for this terrible situation,” said Gervais. “Mel blames – well, we know who Mel blames.” Still, Gervais qualified: “I’d rather have a drink with him in his hotel room tonight than Bill Cosby.”\n\nAfter introducing Gibson, Gervais made sure to ask an important question of the former action star: “What the fuck does ‘sugar tits’ even mean?”\n\nGervais was, to his credit, eminently more watchable than most of the stars whom the evening was ostensibly celebrating. The first presenters, actors Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, kicked off the award for best supporting actress in a motion picture with an extended bit involving Hill dressed as the bear from The Revenant. Although the majority of the 22 Jump Street star’s jokes were silenced by network censors, the at-home audience’s annoyed confusion was manifest in Jane Fonda’s face.\n\nAfter Italian composer Ennio Morricone won the Golden Globe for best original score for his work on The Hateful Eight – apparently named after the number of drinks imbibed by Quentin Tarantino – the film’s director gave a frantic, disjointed speech on Morricone’s behalf. “When I say favorite composer, I don’t mean a ‘movie composer’. That’s ghetto,” said Tarantino. “I’m talking about Mozart, I’m talking about Beethoven, I’m talking about Schubert. That’s who I’m talking about.”\n\nJamie Foxx, who had presented the award, returned to the stage after Tarantino was played off, with shaken head and a single word: “Ghetto.”\n\nA few well-cast presenter pairings did, however, keep the portions of the evening not hosted by Gervais from riding off the rails.\n\nActors Eva Longoria and America Ferrera, in a callback to the incident when the official Golden Globes Twitter account mistook Ferrera for Gina Rodriguez when she announced the list of 2016 nominees, introduced themselves with reminders to viewers at home that they were not other Latina actors one might lazily mistake them for. “I’m Eva Longoria, not Eva Mendes,” said Longoria, to which Ferrera replied: “And I’m America Ferrera, not Gina Rodriguez.” Longoria then kept the joke going by reminding the audience that “neither of us are Rosario Dawson”.\n\nJennifer Lawrence, winner of the Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy film, and Amy Schumer, who told Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet that her “vagina itched today”, took a similar tack, humorously mocking Hollywood’s treatment of women.\n\n“As women in Hollywood, people have a lot of preconceived notions about us,” Lawrence said.\n\n“Yeah!” responded Schumer. “Like, they’re just like, ‘Oh, Jenny! You’re just, like, so pretty, and everyone likes them and wants to hang out with them, and they seem so fun to be around, and they should be models.’ Like ... ” she faded off, staring in mock anger at the audience, who were largely in stitches.\n\nTrue to form, some off-the-cuff celebrity moments were more entertaining than the anodyne nominee introductions onstage. Leonardo DiCaprio’s response to Lady Gaga’s Golden Globe win, for example:\n\nAs for the awards themselves, there was little indication that critics of the perceived lack of diversity among the nominated actors had their complaints heard. There were almost no non-white nominees in the film categories – Straight Outta Compton, the well-received biopic about the rise and fall of hip-hop group NWA, was snubbed when the Golden Globe nominations were announced, and Idris Elba, a supporting actor nominee for Beasts of No Nation, was also passed over in favor of Sylvester Stallone. Denzel Washington, who won the honorary Cecil B DeMille Award for “outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment”, was the only film actor of color to take home a statuette.\n\nA notable exception was Taraji P Henson, winner of the Golden Globe for best actress in a television drama. “Cookies for everyone tonight!” Henson cheered. “My treat.”\n\nIn closing the evening, Gervais perhaps best summed up the import of the Golden Globes as the unofficial kickoff of awards season – the months-long period when the world’s most overpaid and overprivileged people drape themselves in finery and soak up each others’ awesomeness - with a simple shrug."
