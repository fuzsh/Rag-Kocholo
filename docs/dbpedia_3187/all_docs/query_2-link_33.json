        "text": "Premise and characters\n\nThe show’s premise involves a documentary crew that is filming the day-to-day experiences of employees at the Wernham Hogg paper company, specifically at an office branch located in a dismal industrial estate in the town of Slough, a western suburb of London. The Slough branch is led by David Brent (played by Gervais), a desperately insecure and incompetent office manager who believes himself to be respected and liked by his staff for his great sense of humor and easygoing nature. In a “talking head” interview for the documentary, he offers his managerial philosophy: “When people say, ‘Oh, would you rather be thought of as a funny man or a great boss,’ my answer’s always the same. To me they’re not mutually exclusive.” The awkward interactions between Brent and his staff, however, suggest they consider him as neither a funny man nor a great boss.\n\nAt the outset of the first season, Brent’s no-nonsense supervisor, Jennifer Taylor-Clark (Stirling Gallacher), meets with him to alert him of the company’s plans to downsize and possibly close the Slough branch. The worried staff confront Brent, who rashly promises them that there will be no layoffs. Other staff members at the Slough branch include Dawn Tinsley (Lucy Davis), an artistically inclined but drifting office receptionist; Tim Canterbury (Martin Freeman), an amiable but also drifting sales representative; Gareth Keenan (Mackenzie Crook), a humorless, self-important assistant regional manager and team leader; and Chris Finch (Ralph Ineson), a lecherous and bullying sales representative whom Brent unwisely considers to be a friend. The camera frequently catches Tim and Dawn in the act of flirting, even though Dawn is engaged to one of Wernham Hogg’s warehouse workers, the macho and possessive Lee (Joel Beckett). In between their mundane work tasks, the Slough staff suffer through Brent’s attempts at office hijinks and disastrous team-building sessions, all the while awaiting news of the downsizing.\n\nThe second season sees Wernham Hogg’s Swindon branch close and merge with Slough’s, and Swindon’s manager, the respected Neil Godwin (Patrick Baladi), becomes Brent’s boss. Soon, Brent’s insecure joking and lax management style conflict with Neil’s far more professional manner, and Brent is laid off on camera. Meanwhile, Dawn decides to leave her job and move to the United States with Lee. After two seasons of six episodes each, The Office’s series finale featured a two-part Christmas special. In part one, three years have passed since the airing of the documentary, and the crew is again filming the staff for a follow-up. Brent has found work as a traveling salesman. Tim, who was rejected by Dawn twice before she left England, must find some other motivation for showing up at the office, with his crush no longer working there. In part two, Dawn and Lee return to Slough for the office Christmas party, which Brent also attends with a blind date. The series ends on a note of hope for Tim, Dawn, and Brent.\n\nDevelopment of The Office\n\nThe Office was inspired by a short comedy film called Seedy Boss that Merchant, with help from Gervais, made for a course for producers-in-training at the BBC. Merchant and Gervais had previously worked together at a London radio station, and both had extensive experience working office jobs. Looking to spoof reality TV shows that follow the lives of “ordinary” people, they decided to develop a series based on Merchant’s short film. The mockumentary-style approach had been used for feature films such as director Rob Reiner’s This Is Spinal Tap (1984) and in some TV shows and sketches but never before as the basis of a television comedy series.\n\nTo accurately capture the ordinariness of office work, Merchant and Gervais cast unknown actors and created a set with the drab aesthetic of a typical office, down to the fluorescent lighting and beige-colored interiors. The show was filmed with handheld cameras and had no laugh track or live audience. Instead, viewers could hear realistic details such as the sound of a photocopier in the background or dead air as characters stared at their computer screens or ignored one another in the break room. During the editing process, the footage was color-corrected to drain the color saturation and increase the drabness. In a 2021 interview with BBC Culture, Merchant said: “We wanted it to look like a documentary that had sort of been forgotten about and was sitting on a shelf at the BBC.”\n\nReception, accolades, and influence\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In 2001 the London Evening Standard called it “a bore” and said, “How this dross ever got beyond the pilot stage is a mystery.” By the second season, however, the show had become a huge hit with viewers. In 2004, when the two-part Christmas special aired, The New York Times called the series “one of the most satisfying comedies ever.”\n\nThe Office won the BAFTA Award for best situation comedy three years in a row (2002–04), and it made history at the Golden Globe Awards in 2004, becoming the first British show in the awards’ history to win for best comedy series. In 2005 part one of its Christmas special was nominated for two Emmy Awards, for outstanding TV movie and outstanding writing for a miniseries or TV movie. After the series conclusion, many other hit shows borrowed from its blend of mockumentary-style film techniques and cringeworthy humor, including Arrested Development (2003–06, 2013, 2018–19), Extras (2005–07; another of Gervais’s projects), 30 Rock (2006–13), Parks and Recreation (2009–15), Modern Family (2009–20), and Fleabag (2016–19). In addition to the well-known American version starring Steve Carell, The Office inspired a number of local versions in many other countries, including Canada, Chile, Finland, France, and India. In 2016 Gervais reprised the role of Brent for the TV movie, David Brent: Life on the Road, which revisited the former office manager in his efforts to make it as a rock star."
