        "text": "Ricky Gervais\n\n\"I wrote parts for myself, so I didn't have to audition for anything. I cheated. I was around 36, 37. I'd worked in an office for like 10 years, which is what The Office was based on,\" Gervais, show creator and star of Netflix's Derek, tells THR. \"I never thought, 'I am going to write this someday.' I was just the 'funny guy.' \"\n\nRicky Gervais\n\nUnlike some of his peers, Ricky Gervais didn't come up through the stand-up ranks. \"I never went through the struggle of having to make it as a stand-up. I was already on TV, so it was sort of easier,\" he tells THR. \"But there's also this strange duality — it's harder to do if you're on TV because they expect it to be perfect. They expect it to be the best show they've ever seen.\"\n\nJordan Peele\n\n\"Early on, it was In Living Color and SNL for me, too,\"Peele says of his first big comedy influences. \"I always wanted to be like Phil Hartman — a utility player on a sketch show. I loved the fact that he could take any role and bring such truth to it with amazing vocal work.\"\n\nDon Cheadle\n\n\"We all learn early that making people laugh — and laughing at yourself — is kind of the best feeling,\" says Don Cheadle, who plays Marty Kaan on Showtime's House of Lies. \"And to combat bullying, too. You can reach across to people that you thought you would have no connection with and laugh, and you're like, 'Oh, wait a minute, we're not that different.' And they get back to kicking your ass. But there was a minute.\"\n\nFred Armisen\n\n\"When Liam Neeson hosted SNL, we played a German family in a sketch. We all had blond hair. Liam Neeson was the dad and kept sitting on everything. We presented him with a violin, and he'd sit on it. A dollhouse the daughter made, he'd sit on it. I thought it was the funniest thing in the world. Then it went to dress rehearsal, and it was very, very dead silent. There wasn't even a groan. It was the absence of sound,\" reveals Fred Armisen of his worst comedy moment.\n\nThomas Middleditch\n\n\"I would say my character is very much an amalgamation of my contribution plus everybody else's,\" Thomas Middleditch tells THR about his role on HBO's Silicon Valley. \"We do improv, but it's not about rewriting a scene or creating a new storyline. A tangent may evolve, but it's more about character color — all these little improvs that don't necessarily make it into the show but help the writers.\"\n\nWill Forte\n\n\"Fox was into it from the beginning,\" says Last Man on Earth's Will Forte on selling the unique apocalyptic comedy. \"The hardest thing was getting them to buy into long stretches of time without people talking. We were very honest about our intentions from the beginning. The nerve-racking part was thinking that at some point, they would force us to go against their promise of letting us do what we wanted to do.\"\n\nRicky Gervais\n\n\"Monty Python is also when I became aware that I was jealous of grown men acting ridiculous,\" says Gervais. \"I got told off at school for being a fool and mucking around, but they're doing it for a living. I thought, 'This would be great.' No one could tell me not to do it because it'd be my job.\"\n\nWill Forte, Jordan Peele and Don Cheadle\n\n\"We have this wonderful thing called the race card, which we can play at any point. Any time we get a note we don't like, we say, 'It's a black thing,' and that's the end of the conversation,\" says Key & Peele's Jordan Peele.\n\nHouse of Lies' Don Cheadle chimes in, \"Just wait till they hire that black exec who's like, 'It's not a black thing.' \"\n\nRicky Gervais\n\n\"Real life is my biggest influence. A lot of my family were care workers, so I suppose I wanted Derek to be a bit of an antidote to the other stuff I'd done a lot about fame,\" says Gervais, before adding, \"[The Office's] David Brent was about a normal man getting famous. I like making the ordinary extraordinary. I want you to care for the characters.\"\n\nJordan Peele\n\n\"There's a lot of questioning of the zeitgeist and questioning what's relevant. We're also targeted at kids, so we have to write sketches about Drake and shit,\" Jordan Peele tells THR of network notes on his and Keegan-Michael Key's Comedy Central show Key & Peele. \"But one of the main reasons our show has been successful is that the network has allowed us to go places, even pushed us over the line sometimes.\"\n\nRicky Gervais\n\nDoes Ricky Gervais have a least-favorite trend in comedy? \"Yes, idiots confusing the target of the joke with the subject of a joke. It's getting worse and worse. I am all for political correctness, but it's not about that. It's about stupid people misunderstanding jokes and then getting angry. At least understand the joke before you dislike it.\"\n\nFred Armisen\n\n\"We mostly make Portlandia for us and our fans,\" Fred Armisen says of his and Carrie Brownstein's IFC comedy. \"If we feel like we've done a season of a certain type of sketch, we think, 'Let's just change it up this year.' At the beginning of every writing session, it's, 'What's the goal for this season?' And the inspiration is never-ending, so far.\""
