        "text": "Kim Cattrall has labelled Ricky Gervais' Golden Globes swipe at Sex and the City 2 as \"cheap\" and ageist.\n\nThe 54-year-old actress is best known for her portrayal of man-eater Samantha Jones in the TV show-cum movie franchise, which followed the love lives of a group of glamorous New Yorkers.\n\nCattrall was not in the audience when Globes host Gervais made a series of risqu√© gags about various celebrities, including one about attempts to cover up the true age of the Sex and the City cast.\n\n\"I was sure the Golden Globe for special effects would go to the team that airbrushed that poster,\" he joked as castmate Chris Noth laughed and nodded from the audience.\n\n\"Girls, we know how old you are. I saw one of you in an episode of (1960s show) Bonanza.\"\n\nLoading\n\nCattrall said she felt disappointed by the comments, especially because she considered ageism to be such a serious issue in the industry.\n\n\"I didn't watch it so I can't really comment on it. Ageism is out there and I fight it every day in my own way,\" she told Extra.\n\n\"So, I think that's kind of a cheap joke ... Maybe some people feel that needs to be out there. I don't particularly think so.\"\n\nIn a separate insult, Cattrall has also been nominated for a Razzie Award for worst actress and worst picture, alongside co-stars Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon.\n\nSex and the City 2 was not well received by critics when it was released last year, with accusations of racial stereotyping, the trivialising of the global financial crisis and a disappointing departure from the original television series.\n\nThe heavily-retouched promotional posters also raised eyebrows at the time.\n\nGervais, who also took aim at A-listers Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, Bruce Willis and a long list of others during the ceremony, was later criticised by Globes organisers for \"crossing the line.\"\n\nCattrall said she missed her Sex and the City co-stars, who have all been working on different ventures since promoting the movie together last year.\n\n\"I miss the girls. We've all been so busy since the show ended, privately and professionally.\"\n\nstuff.co.nz"
