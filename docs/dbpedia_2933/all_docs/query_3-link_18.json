        "text": "Attention all fans of J.R.R. Tolkien‘s epic fantasy world of Middle-earth! We’re happy to announce the release of not one but five new video games based on The Lord of the Rings by early 2024 that we believe you will absolutely love.\n\nWhether you’re a die-hard fan of the books, the movies, or both, we guarantee you won’t be disappointed with this middle earth video game series.\n\nAre you ready to dive in? Are you ready to explore new worlds, forge new alliances, and take on new challenges? Then keep reading because we’re about to take you on a journey through five new Lord of the Rings video games that you won’t want to miss!\n\nWhat are the games expected for 2024?\n\nEmbracer Group, the franchise rights holder of The Lord of the Rings, has announced five new games set in the Middle-earth universe by early 2024.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: Gollum\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: Gollum is the most anticipated game, which has had some delays. It is an action-adventure game developed by Daedalic Entertainment. Of course, it is based on the character of Gollum, a central figure in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.\n\nThis game will allow players to take on the role of Gollum and explore the world of Middle-earth from his perspective.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria\n\nReturn to Moria is a survival and crafting video game set in the abandoned mines of Moria. Free Range Games is developing the game, and North Beach Games will publish it. In this title, players will take on the role of dwarves exploring Moria. They will be facing challenges, and battling dangerous enemies. The main goal is to uncover the secrets of the ancient dwarven city. The game is expected to feature a crafting system and skill tree progression.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle Earth\n\nElectronic Arts will publish this game on Google and Apple App Stores. It is a free-to-play collectible mobile RPG. But we know that these types of games have many detractors.\n\nAlthough free-to-play games have become increasingly popular in recent years, they also have some potential disadvantages. Many free-to-play games include a pay-to-win system, where players can spend real money to gain an advantage over other players. This point can create an unbalanced playing field, making it difficult for players who don’t spend money to compete.\n\nHowever, we don’t know yet how this game will work, so let’s give it a try.\n\nWeta Workshop’s game\n\nWeta Workshop is a design and effects company based in New Zealand. It has worked on a wide range of projects, including the special effects for The Lord of the Rings and Hobbit film trilogies. So they know very well the J.R.R. Tolkien’s world.\n\nThe company mentioned will develop a new game for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Even if we know little about the game itself, the mere prospect of a new adventure in Middle-earth is enough to create so much excitement among fans of the books or films.\n\nWhat about the fifth video game?\n\nThe fifth game is like the true identity and nature of Tom Bombadil. In other words: it is a true mystery.\n\nWe don’t know yet since it is most likely an unannounced title. But Embracer is very optimistic about these new projects and their release dates.\n\nPreviously released Lord of the Rings games\n\nSeveral video games have been based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic fantasy novel. If you are a big fan, here are some of the most notable ones:\n\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Middle-earth: Shadow of War\n\nThese are open-world action-adventure games that take place in the period between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. They were released in 2014 and 2017, respectively, and allow players to explore and fight in Middle-earth.\n\nLOTR: The Battle for Middle-earth\n\nIt is a real-time strategy game that was released in 2004. Players can command armies of various factions from the novels, including Elves, Dwarves, and the armies of Mordor.\n\nLOTR: The Two Towers and The Return of the King\n\nThese are action-adventure games based on the second and third novels in the trilogy. They were both released in 2002 and are available on various platforms, including PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings Lego series\n\nIt is an action-adventure video game based on the film adaptations. The game features a mix of puzzles, combat, and exploration.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings Lego video game is known for their charming and humorous take on the source material. In this, you will find a faithful recreation of iconic moments from the films and books. The game also features an open world that allows players to explore various locations. If you love Middle-earth stories, you should play this video game. It is considered one of the best Lego games ever made.\n\nSo if you’re a fan of The Lord of the Rings and can’t get enough of the rich, detailed world that Tolkien created, be sure to check out these video games. They will provide you with hours of entertainment while you wait for the new ones."
