        "text": "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is a hack-n-slash game where you re-live the movie and can play as each of the main characters. The game plays in third person as you pick off minions and bosses from the movies. Execute combos, special moves and level up to purchase new abilities.\n\nFollow my step-by-step guide on installing, configuring and optimizing Lord of the Rings: Return of the King in Linux with PlayOnLinux.\n\nNote: This guide applies to the Retail version of Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.

Click the down-arrow to select another version of Wine.\n\nDisplay Tab\n\nVideo memory size: Enter the amount of memory your video card/chip uses\n\nInstalling Lord Of the Rings Return To The King\n\nMiscellanous Tab\n\nClick \"Run a exe file in this virtual drive\"\n\nNavigate to the folder on your desktop\n\nSelect AutoRun.exe or Setup.exe\n\nClick Open\n\nClick Install\n\nClick Yes\n\nEnter the key off the Game insert\n\nClick Next\n\nClick \"Register Later\"\n\nInstalling...\n\nInsert the Play Disc\n\nClick OK\n\nPlayOnLinux Shortcut\n\nBack to General Tab\n\nClick \"Make a new shortcut from this virtual drive\"\n\nSelect ROTK.exe\n\nClick Next\n\nName your shortcut: LOTR Return of the King\n\nClick Next\n\nClick Next\n\nClose Configure\n\nLaunch Lord Of The Rings Return To The King\n\nSelect LOTR Return of the King\n\nClick Run\n\nNote: Click Debug to see errors and bugs\n\nOptimization\n\nWhen the game begins you will see some movie clips, then it automatically begins playing.\n\nYou can press ESC to see options or wait until you get to the Home screen\n\nClick Options\n\nClick Video\n\nSet Resolution\n\nNote: LOTR only accepts 3:4 aspect ratios, so you will need to change your Linux desktop to a resolution on this list\n\nAdjust:\n\n32 bit color\n\nCharacter Detail\n\nShadows\n\nSFX\n\nAlternate Cameras\n\nRule of thumb:\n\nHigher settings = More detail, lower frame rates\n\nLower settings = Less detail, higher frame rates\n\nConclusion:\n\nOnce I set my Linux Desktop to 1400x1050 the game would appear fullscreen. There is no widescreen support. The Shadows setting would default to Low unless I set it in the ROTK.ini\n\nYou can find it in your home folder.\n\nOtherwise, the game ran perfectly and is suitable for laptops and older computers. The controls are kinda strange due to the way the in-game camera floats around. I also tested with a joystick and was able to play cooperative perfectly.\n\nGameplay Video:\n\nScreenshots:"
