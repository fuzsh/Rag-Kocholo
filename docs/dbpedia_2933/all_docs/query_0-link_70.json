        "text": "The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II is a singleplayer and multiplayer bird's-eye view RTS game in the The Battle for Middle-earth series.\n\nThe base game received six official patches, the fifth of which was produced by the GameReplays.org BFME2 section. This patch is most notable for the introduction of the hard counter system.\n\nThe game received The Rise of the Witch-king expansion pack in November 2006, outsourced to BreakAway Games. It introduced the playable Angmar faction, new units for existing factions and new campaigns. It was, however, based on an obsolete build of BFME2 (earlier than 1.05 at least), and its own single official patch left the game in a state of severe balancing problems and audio mixing/volume issues in the new campaign.\n\nAs of December 31, 2010, the official GameSpy service was shut down and all purchases were halted due to Electronic Arts' loss of the Lord of the Rings license.[1]"
