        "text": "Middle-earth: Shadow of War\n\nAction 10 October 2017\n\nMiddle-Earth: Shadow of War is a direct sequel to the well-received action-adventure game Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor. Just like the first game in the series, Shadow of War takes place in the world created by J.R.R. Tolkien. The game is presented from a third-person perspective. We can explore the rich, open world of the game by riding various steeds and by taking good use of the free-running movement system, similar to that from the Assassin's Creed series.\n\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of Mordor\n\nAction 30 September 2014\n\nA TPP action game set in J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor was developed by Monolith Productions, the creators of Aliens vs Predator 2 and F.E.A.R.: First Encounter Assault Recon. The plot takes place before the events depicted in \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of War - Desolation of Mordor\n\nAction 08 May 2018\n\nThe DLC to Middle-earth: Shadow of War, in which the player assumes the role of Baranor - the commander of Minas Ithil who faces the threat coming from the East. This Add-on offers not only a number of new story-related quests but also an entirely new region and additional pieces of gear that the main protagonist can upgrade at his dwarf friend – Torvin.\n\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of War - Blade of Galadriel\n\nAction 06 February 2018\n\nAn expansion for the game Middle-earth: Shadow of War, in which you play as Eltariel, an elite assassin, who hunts creatures corrupted by the Ring of Power. The new protagonist uses new equipment and battle abilities, and her weapons of choice are two elvish blades and the Light of Galadriel.\n\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of Mordor - Lord of the Hunt\n\nAction 16 December 2014\n\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of Mordor - Lord of the Hunt is the first big DLC for the third-person action game developed by Monolith and set in the Tolkien's Lord of the Rings universe. The expansion focuses on the various beasts that roam the lands of Mordor. During our adventures, we will once again meet Torvin, the dwarven hunter, to listen to his stories and take part in the titular hunt for the never before seen beasts, like the toxin-spitting graug.\n\nLEGO Dimensions\n\nArcade 27 September 2015\n\nNext installment in a bestselling game series devoted to LEGO bricks and developed, as usual, by Traveller’s Tales studio. This title is Warner Bros'. response to the growing popularity of franchises like Skylanders or Disney Infinity. This is the first game in the series that uses real LEGO minifigures, which are transferred into virtual word through a special port.\n\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of Mordor - The Bright Lord\n\nAction 24 February 2015\n\nThe Bright Lord is the second DLC to Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor developed by Monolith Productions. The expansion takes us to the distant past where we play as Celebrimbor. Remembering how much the Dark Lord hurt his family, Celerbrimor declares war on Sauron and tries to stop him from getting his hands on the Ring of Power. Unlike Talion, the protagonist of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor - The Bright Lord can use the power of the One Ring.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: Adventure Card Game\n\nPuzzle 05 November 2019\n\nA virtual adaptation of the card game created by Fantasy Flight Games and based on the license of The Lord of the Rings. The game allows up to two players to participate in a yet another adventure taking place in Middle-earth, during which they lead three heroes through a selected scenario. The game allows you to modify your deck and missions in many ways, making each playthrough unique.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: Gollum\n\nAdventure 25 May 2023\n\nAn action adventure game developed by the Daedalic Entertainment studio.
