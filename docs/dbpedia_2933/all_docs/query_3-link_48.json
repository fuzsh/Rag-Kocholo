        "text": "An open-world MMO adventure, the upcoming game takes place in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth, featuring the beloved stories of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings literary trilogy. Set in a persistent world, the new MMO is in the early stages of production, with the Amazon Games Orange County studio leading development. Amazon Games will publish the game globally for PC and consoles.\n\n“The world of Middle-earth continues to prove an endlessly fertile ground for creators, and Amazon Games has a passion for building immersive, compelling worlds and publishing games for a global audience”, said Lee Guinchard, CEO of Freemode. “We have the clear ambition to create the highest-quality entertainment products for this IP, whether we utilize internal resources or team up with the best industry partners that complement our capabilities. We’re taking every care to deliver an MMO which will do justice to the expansive Middle-earth universe and delight players around the world.”\n\n“We’re committed to bringing players high-quality games, whether through original IPs or long-beloved ones like The Lord of the Rings,” said Christoph Hartmann, VP, Amazon Games. “Bringing players a fresh take on The Lord of the Rings has long been an aspiration for our team, and we’re honored and grateful that Middle-earth Enterprises is entrusting us with this iconic world. We’re also pleased to be expanding our relationship with Embracer Group following our Tomb Raider deal last year, as they’ve proven to be excellent collaborators.”\n\nThis agreement is one of the deals with several industry partners, as previously communicated, and most recently in conjunction with Embracer’s Q3 report February 2023, that are jointly transformative. This specific announcement aims to create long-term value for Embracer Group and is expected to have limited effects in the short term.\n\nFor additional information, please contact:\n\nOscar Erixon, Head of Investor Relations Embracer Group AB (publ)\n\nTel: + 46 730 24 91 42\n\nEmail: oscar.erixon@embracer.com\n\nBeatrice Forsgren, Head of Brand and Communication Embracer Group AB (publ)\n\nTel: +46 704 52 57 63\n\nE-mail: beatrice.forsgren@embracer.com\n\nLee Guinchard, CEO Embracer Freemode Inc\n\nTel: +1 408 649 1100\n\nE-mail: lee.guinchard@embracer.com\n\nAbout Embracer Group\n\nEmbracer Group is a global group of creative and entrepreneurial businesses in PC/console, mobile and board games and other related media.
