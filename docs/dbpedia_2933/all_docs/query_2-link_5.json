Gollum plots to frame Sam for eating food and desiring the Ring; Influenced by the growing power of the Ring, Frodo falls for the deception and orders Sam to go home. Gollum then tricks Frodo into venturing into the lair of the giant spider Shelob. Frodo narrowly escapes and confronts Gollum, who falls into a chasm after a fight.\n\nShelob discovers, paralyzes and binds Frodo, but Sam wounds and drives her away and, lamenting Frodo's apparent death, takes the Ring. Sam realizes his mistake when a group of Orcs take Frodo captive, but manages to rescue him while the Orcs fight among themselves. Now inside Mordor, the hobbits, disguised as Orcs, continue towards Mount Doom, their destination.\n\nMeanwhile, at Helm's Deep, Pippin looks towards the palantír and sees Sauron and a burning tree. Gandalf deduces that the enemy plans to attack the capital of Gondor, Minas Tirith. As King Théoden gathers his army, Elrond tells Aragorn that Arwen is dying for refusing to leave Middle-earth. Elrond gives Aragorn Andúril, reforged from the fragments of King Elendil's sword, Narsil, and urges him to promise to claim the throne of Gondor, to which he is heir. Together with Legolas and Gimli, Aragorn travels the Paths of the Dead and promises to free the ghosts from their curse if they come to the aid of Gondor.\n\nThéoden arrives and leads his army against the Orcs. Despite initial success against the Orcs in the ensuing battle, they are decimated by Haradrim riding Oliphaunt and the Witch-king mortally wounds Théoden; However, his niece Éowyn kills the Witch-king with the help of Merry. Théoden dies in the arms of his niece. Then Aragorn arrives with his Army of the Dead, who defeat Sauron's forces. Their oath is fulfilled and the Dead are freed from their curse.\n\nAragorn decides to march towards Mordor to distract Sauron from the now extremely weak Frodo and Sam; All of Sauron's remaining forces march to confront Aragorn's distraction, allowing the hobbits to reach Mount Doom.\n\nGollum, who survived his previous fall, attacks them, but Frodo manages to enter the mountain. There, he succumbs to the power of the Ring and puts it on his finger, but Gollum manages to bite his finger and claim it, causing a fight between them before falling off the ledge. Frodo manages to hold on and Sam picks him up as Gollum falls to his death in the lava and takes the ring with him, defeating Sauron once and for all. Aragorn's army emerges victorious when its enemies and the lands of Mordor collapse and Mount Doom erupts, with Frodo and Sam narrowly escaping. Gandalf rescues the hobbits with the help of the eagles and the surviving Fellowship is happily reunited in Minas Tirith.\n\nAragorn is crowned King of Gondor and marries Arwen.\n\nLevels[]\n\nThe Secret Stairs\n\nCirith Ungol\n\nThe Paths of the Dead\n\nThe Battle of Pelennor Fields\n\nThe Black Gate\n\nMount Doom\n\nCharacters[]\n\nFrodo*\n\nSam*\n\nGollum*\n\nShagrat*\n\nFrodo (Weary)\n\nSam (Weary)\n\nFrodo (Orc Disguise)\n\nSam (Orc Disguise)\n\nAragorn*\n\nGimli*\n\nLegolas*\n\nÉowyn (Dernhelm)*\n\nKing Théoden (Armor)*\n\nMerry (Rohirrim Squire)*\n\nAragorn (Gondor Armor)\n\nPippin (Gondor Armor)*\n\nGandalf the White*\n\nThe Witch-king*\n\nMordor Orc*\n\nUruk-hai\n\nPippin\n\nMerry\n\nSauron*\n\nKing Théoden\n\nRohirrim Soldier*\n\nKing of the Dead*\n\nSoldier of the Dead*\n\nGondor Soldier*\n\nHaradrim*\n\nArwen Evenstar\n\nAragorn (Royal Armor)\n\nElrond (Third Age)*\n\nBoromir* (As a Ghost in the secret ending)\n\nDifferences from the film[]\n\nIn the film, Frodo enters Shelob's lair alone, while in the game Gollum enters there with him. This change was made to make the game more cooperative.\n\nDenethor does not appear in the game at all, so his scenes with Faramir and his madness are omitted entirely, although he can be purchased as a playable character.\n\nIn the film, Éowyn grabs Merry onto her horse. In the game, she grabs him onto a goat.\n\nIn the game, after Gollum's long fall following the encounter at Shelob's Lair, this is when Frodo sees Sam and forgives him, while in the film, it is after Sam saves him at Cirith Ungol.\n\nShagrat helps Sam defeat Shelob in the game. This is to make the game more cooperative.\n\nWhen Shelob stings Frodo, his eyes turn white and he makes a shocking expression on his face in the game, while in the film, he foams at the mouth and ends up with a blank face.\n\nIn the film, Éowyn fights the Witch-king alone. As soon as he was about to finish her off, Merry appears out of nowhere and stabs him. In the game, Merry and Éowyn fight the Witch-king together to make the game more cooperative.\n\nThe Witch-king deflates in the game after Éowyn defeats him.\n\nThe game's subtitles call Guritz \"orc harbour master.\" Also, this is the only time he appears in the game.\n\nIn the game, Frodo does not appear tied up and with his face covered by Shelob's web while he is held captive by the orcs.\n\nIn the game, Gorbag ​​is killed by Frodo and Sam when they hit a ceiling lamp and it falls on top of him and he falls deeper into the Cirith Ungol tower. Before that, Sam hits Gorbag ​​with a frying pan, causing him to lose his balance. In the film, Sam uses Sting to kill Gorbag ​​from behind just as he tries to torture Frodo.\n\nSam never gives the Ring to Frodo in the game after he rescues him. Instead, he reveals that the Ring was hidden inside Frodo's shirt.\n\nThe game features the part of the book that is omitted in the film where Frodo and Sam head to Cirith Ungol to find the orc's armor as a disguise.\n\nÉomer does not appear at all in The Black Gate level, despite being present in the film.\n\nDuring the battle at the Black Gate, the Mouth of Sauron is never revealed there when the gate is opened. Instead, Sauron's army marches immediately, as in the theatrical version of the film. But in the book and the Extended Edition of the film, he does. However, the Mouth of Sauron can be unlocked after completing the bonus level.\n\nFrodo and Sam arrive at Mount Doom while the battle at the Black Gate takes place in the film. In the game, the two stages were divided into two levels, with The Black Gate and Mount Doom as the penultimate and last level respectively.\n\nGollum knocks Sam unconscious with a flowerpot instead of a rock in the game.\n\nGollum pops Frodo's hand in the game instead of biting his finger, but Frodo later puts it back on.\n\nSam does not take Frodo's hand until Sauron is defeated in the game.\n\nAfter Sauron is defeated, the Black Gate does not collapse.\n\nIn the game, when the eagles arrive to save Frodo and Sam after the two escape Mount Doom, Gandalf wears an aviator's hat and baron's glasses and even pulls a lever on the flying eagle.\n\nIn the game, Arwen and Elrond are present during Aragorn's coronation, but in the film, the elves arrive after Aragorn is crowned when Arwen surprises him and the two share a reunion.\n\nAll of the film's multiple endings, aside from Gray Havens, are omitted from the game.\n\nThe secret ending does not show Frodo giving the red book to Sam.\n\nThis version of the scene from The Gray Havens has a happier ending as Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Boromir, who appears as a ghost, join the remaining members of the fellowship as they watch the Elven ship leave Middle-earth.\n\nLEGO The Lord of the Rings levels The Fellowship of the Ring Prologue • The Black Rider • Weathertop • The Pass of Caradhras • The Mines of Moria • Amon Hen The Two Towers Taming Gollum • The Dead Marshes • Track Hobbits • Warg Attack • Helm's Deep • Osgiliath The Return of the King The Secret Stairs • Cirith Ungol • The Paths of the Dead • The Battle of Pelennor Fields • The Black Gate • Mount Doom Bonus levels Middle-earth Middle-earth Hobbiton • Bree • Weathertop • Rivendell • The Pass of Caradhras • Lothlórien • Amon Hen • Emyn Muil • The Dead Marshes • Edoras • Helm's Deep • Isengard • Minas Tirith • Minas Morgul • Cirith Ungol • The Black Gate"
