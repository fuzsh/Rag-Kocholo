        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nElegantFrost\n\n80%PlayStation 2\n\n6h 39m Played\n\nA proper licensed title with actors from the movies, the soundtrack, and care put into designing levels based on movie scenes. The combat is engaging enough, though some combos are hard to pull off. EXP is earned based on how well you play and can unlock abilities for all characters. Designed and best played co-op, but solo play is doable. Very difficult as even on easy you can die with a lack of health drops.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nCivilwarfare101\n\n60%Emulated\n\n6h 30m Played\n\nFor being scripted brawlers based on a movie, there is some enjoyment to be found. Combat is janky but it is decent and is actually better than some WRPGs that I played. I am kind of interested in playing some musou games now after playing this, I am not even sure why, I guess there is a weird power fantasy in killing hundreds of moronic enemies. The protect missions are as bad but there are less of them in Return of the King.\n\nI do like that in Return of the King, you can buy moves and health upgrades for multiple characters so you won't be \"underleveled\" when you play as characters like Aagorn and Sam. The boss fights are awkward. I did find the scenarios where you played as Sam to be pretty cool. Like throwing spears at a shielded orc to break his defense or setting traps to kill a number of orcs or avoiding the Nazgul's line of sight while he is patrolling around the castle. Using fire to fend off the spiders was interesting too.\n\nIt's weird playing LOTR Two Towers and Return of the King tie in games. I heard they were hidden gems for a long time and they are pretty solid but all they really did was make me want to watch the LOTR movies again, so in a sense they are trailers for the movies so I am not sure if it's a good or bad thing if they are that. As games they are decent for being movie tied to a movie and as trailers, they work extremely well.\n\nOverall, some of the better movie licensed games.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nKerfMerf\n\n50%PlayStation 2\n\n8h 16m Played\n\nIt's certainly a large improvement over the first two games. I actually had a modicum of fun playing it. However, the game is surprisingly difficult (sometimes due to bad camera angles, sometimes due to long gaps between checkpoints, and, yes, sometimes due to dev-intended challenge).\n\nSimilar to Dynasty Warriors, it's not impossible to just burn straight through the campaign, but they do seem to expect that you'll grind levels over and over to level up before attempting the next stage. The difference between RotK and Dynasty Warriors is that DW gives you wide open battlefields to explore and experiment with different tactics and routes while RotK boils down to mostly linear corridors and a few circular or square arenas. Your best bet is usually to just stand still and spam speed attacks or a knockdown combo. Riveting gameplay, I know.\n\nThe combo system is somewhat improved from TTT, but it still feels underdeveloped. The two most important utilities are crowd control and knockdown, and if you can find a combo that manages both then there's really no need to use any others. Gandalf is pretty OP in that regard: one of his basic combos 1) is easy to input; 2) causes knockdown; 3) sweeps a full arc in front of him; 4) builds up his perfect meter quickly; and 5) causes super effective damage to orcs. There's almost no need to use anything else.\n\nOne other nice addition is environmental attacks. It's introduced poorly, but these attacks are actually extremely powerful. Which is nice, because it breaks up the monotony of standing in one place mashing X-X-Triangle constantly.\n\nI'm proud of myself for overcoming the challenge on my own terms, but it's still nothing to write home about. A perfectly okay game that was probably much more fun in co-op when the movies were still new.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nNojEsco\n\n50%PlayStation 2\n\n6h 18m Played\n\nThis game is largely just the same as the last one, acting as just a videogame form of a commercial for a movie â€“ literally like a reverse Kingsglaive, the main difference being that, while Kingsglaive was imperfect, it contained a lot of its own content. This on the other hand is largely just a rehash of existing sequences. The main difference is that the final portion allows you to fight Gollum, a great but frustrating character, and this is surprisingly cathartic. And a few things like the controls and visuals are at least a half-notch better than the previous game, and it is nice that there are still a fair amount of supplemental matieral. It's just...inconsequential, especially since the movie it was essentially an ad for is 15 years old now.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nthroatytrout\n\n90%Nintendo GameCube\n\n4h 38m Played\n\nThis game is a rare chance to see a movie tie in game which excels greatly. The game follows very close to the 3 main characters and allows you to play as all of the major fellowship characters. Beyond having the backing of a great movie and fantastic characters alongside this game could be a standalone title and still be great. The game is fully voiced by the actors who played the leading roles in the movies and who doesn't want to hear video game quips being said by the mighty Ian McKellan. The part that makes this game shine however is the relentless action that is the gameplay. Every level feels like a complete war, fighting off hordes and hordes of orcs not having a second to breathe. Levels end with hands aching from constantly bashing buttons and it really gives the feel that a battle has been won. The game isn't just button mashing however, you have to decide carefully when to attempt a power attack and when is the right time to hide in a corner and block ferociously, only taking a pot shot occasionally. You can also maybe even the odds with a quick combo kill which you can unlock with the xp you gain over the game.\n\nOverall this game is a real triumph of tie in games and has a real replayability factor, still wanting more even after completing the game. It is just pure relentless fun.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nSingis111\n\n90%PlayStation 2\n\n4h 21m Played\n\nThe Lord of the Rings Return of the King is a great third person hack n' slash game based on the two movies The Two Towers and The Return of the King. Unfortunately it's very short, but got great replayability where you can play as 6 characters and 3 more unlockable ones through over 10 levels. There's a simple level system: kill stuff, get xp then you can spend that xp on upgrades for your characters.\n\nThe story is butchered, as you would expect from a movie tie-in. Superb voice acting from the LOTR movie cast although no Viggo Mortensen or Orlando Bloom."
