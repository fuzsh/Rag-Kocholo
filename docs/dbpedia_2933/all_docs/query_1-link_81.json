The play disc used SafeDisc v3, a protection that lost the support in the Windows 10 (along with other older protection drivers like SecuROM, Tages and StarForce). Microsoft recommendation was mind blowing, as they've suggested to use pirate copies....Amazing, right?!\n\nThose drivers can be added in Windows 10, but you will need at least a basic knowledge in how the OS are working.\n\nYou need Secdrv.sys (x32 or x64 version, depending of your version of Windows 10) file installed to be able to run the play disc.\n\nCheck this article on TechAdvisor and don't forget to thank to Microsoft for their brilliant idea and the marvelous suggestions. An easier method for adding manually the driver is here\n\nI do not work for EA and i am not associated with the company in any way. I am a player just like you, trying to help wherever i can.I will not answer to any unsolicited PM.\n\nNo, I checked that a dozen times and it couldn’t be that because it was a new one and it wasn’t scratched when i opened it. Think it was because it just wasn’t compatible the way it was, but maybe with one of these patches it is"
