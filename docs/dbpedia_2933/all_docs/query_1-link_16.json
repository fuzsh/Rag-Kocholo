        "text": "Want to don Frodo's hairy hobbit feet and infiltrate Mount Doom? Or strap on the armour of Aragorn and explore the Paths of the Dead? Or cleave orcs in two with Gimli's trusty axe? If it's in the film, it's in here. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, the videogame, captures every memorable scene from the movie and turns it into a frenzy of action and adventure, with you in the title role.\n\nThe storyline of The Return of the King sees Frodo Baggins on his final journey to destroy the wicked One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, with only his gardener Sam Gamgee for company. Meanwhile the remainder of the Fellowship of the Ring, led by Gandalf the wizard and Aragorn, the king-to-be, must distract the forces of Sauron long enough for Frodo to fulfil his mission.\n\nThe game features a clever three-path structure that puts you in the position of either Gandalf, the trio of Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas, or Frodo and Sam. You can choose to play through the entire game as one of these character groups, or switch characters in-between levels. The Nintendo GameCube version features more than 12 environments which authentically recreate the look of the movie. You'll travel from the city of Minas Tirith to the Paths of the Dead, then onto the Pelennor Fields where the final showdown takes place.\n\nIn a major change from last year's game of The Two Towers, the environments are totally interactive. You can now swing from ropes, kick rocks at opponents and let rip with giant catapults. The experience system has also been given an overhaul. Defeating enemies rewards you with points which can be spent on improving each character's moves. You can also choose to spread these points among the Fellowship and give everyone a boost. You can also link to the Game Boy Advance version of The Return of the King (using a Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable) and download experience points from the GBA to the GCN game.\n\nInterspersed between levels are clips taken direct from the movie, plus a brand new voiceover provided by Ian (Gandalf) McKellen. The rest of the cast have also lent their voices to the characters, and the music has been provided by Howard Shore, the film's composer. And The Return of the King need not be a solo adventure. You can team up with a friend and play through the game in the new co-operative mode.\n\nWith secret characters to discover, hidden features to unlock and a game structure that demands to be replayed over and over again, The Return of the King will keep you hack-and-slash happy for a long time to come.\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nThis content is sold by Nintendo of Europe SE.
