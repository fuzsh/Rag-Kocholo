        "meta_description": "The Lord of the Rings has been used in video games before, but never to as great an effect before the movies began releasing. The popularity of those films drove production of games based on both the movies and the books, which were sold as separate licenses. At this point, there have been several games about the different movies from Electronic Arts, but all of them let players take the role of one of the Fellowship heroes in the game without allowing players to see the bigger picture of the struggle for Middle-earth. Vivendi released War of the Ring a little over a year ago but managed to create a title that while decent, wasn't particularly inspiring, nor did it really capture the feel of the series.",
