        "text": "One thread running through almost every early gaming adaptation of Tolkien’s work is a sense of over-reaching ambition. After all: You’ve just gotten your hands on one of the most beloved properties of all time—the ur-text of modern fantasy. Aren’t you going to go for it?Take, for instance, 1982's The Hobbit, developed by Beam Software. Not content with merely creating a text adventure version of a hobbit’s holiday—complete with some lovely graphics of Bilbo’s beloved hole—Beam set out to create a living version of Middle-earth, with characters and creatures moving around its large map independent of the players’ own actions. On the one hand, this system gives the impression of an impressive living world, one that won’t statically wait around for the player to come set things off. On the other, this dynamic world leads to things like, say, the note in the manual that admits the game might just go ahead and render itself completely unwinnable, since it’s totally possible for Gandalf to wander off somewhere ten minutes into the game and get himself eaten by a warg while Bilbo and Thorin are still trying to figure out how to get past those dang trolls.The Hobbit also introduces a running theme in these games: the difficulty of adapting a book series where the most prominent heroes are the worst fighters, by far. Bilbo’s just not a warrior—although you can get in a lucky shot by typing “viciously attack Gandalf” as your first command of the game, thus creating a version of The Hobbit in which our beloved Baggins cracks the smoke-ring-blowing old bastard’s head open in the foyer of his house. Guile, instead, is the order of the day—and asking for help, which you’ll need a lot of if you want to make it all the way to the Lonely Mountain and back again."
