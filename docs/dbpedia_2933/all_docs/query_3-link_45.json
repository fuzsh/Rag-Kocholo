        "text": "I’m not sure how old I was when I first tried to play a “Lord of the Rings” video game, but I suspect I wasn’t yet 10. It was in the 1980s, and my dad had brought home a computer cast off from his workplace. The machine was beige with a monochromatic green screen that sat above two floppy disk drives.\n\nAt my urging, my parents soon drove me to the nearest Waldenbooks, where I had long lingered over the paltry but tantalizing collection of computer games. We bought The Hobbit, an illustrated text adventure based on J. R. R. Tolkien’s book of the same name. Back at the house, I sat in our basement and eagerly put the disks into our computer. It whirred and clicked. And then nothing happened. Our new-to-us machine was too old.\n\nThree decades went by before I touched another Tolkien-inspired game. Perhaps subconsciously, I wanted to avoid reliving a child’s disappointment. Despite fistfuls of attempts, there was never an interactive “Lord of the Rings” that you just couldn’t miss.\n\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, which goes on sale Tuesday, is almost that game. It has been more anticipated in certain corners of the Internet than the third installation of Peter Jackson’s “Hobbit” movie trilogy."
