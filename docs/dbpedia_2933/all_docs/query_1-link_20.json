The once great kingdom has never been in more desperate need of its king. But can Aragorn answer the call of his heritage and become what he was born to be? In no small measure, the fate of Middle-earth rests on his broad shoulders.\n\nRelive the adventure of New Line Cinema's Academy Award winning epic film through The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Board game - the final game based on The Lord of the Rings epic movie trilogy. With majestic images from the film, life long followers or first time fans will find the game uniquely challenging, yet easy to play, as this saga of good against evil continues.\n\n(Deluxe Edition Notes:)\n\nFlip the game tiles to reveal the BONUS &quot;Journey to Mount Doom&quot; Game. Players travel from the Shire through the entire Lord of the Rings Trilogy by moving Frodo toward Mount Doom and keeping him from Sauron's evil gaze.\n\nCan be played as stand alone or in combination with &lsquo;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Board Game&rsquo;",
