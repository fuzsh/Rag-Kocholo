        "text": "I have played this game for 2 years. It was always a very fun time, i didn't spend much and enjoyed that i could still contribute by cleaning enemy land and Destroying forts. I was able to hold my own in epic fights that could last hours. With the new update its all changed. I am still able to fight somewhat well currently and hold my own, i understand the new fighting system and it makes sense. But now i have to add 4 commander's into one army. That used to be 4 separate armies i could send out to different places and do different task. Now they are all stuck together and all lose stamina when you move. That means i can be in only one place doing one task at a time, not to mention the movement speed is now slower. I had to cobbke togheter 4 new commanders that are worthless because i never invested in them much to be able to do one additional task a day. I have no idea how i am supposed to farm land or level up my commanders now. Building roads will be a nightmare. Breaking control points is going to be a nightmare. It will take 4 times as long to do anything. This update really has been unenjoyable so far and makes the contribution of anyone who cant fight as well much less. For now i am leaving 1 star until these issues are addressed, will update if they are\n\nIâve been playing this game for a few months now. Following up with updates, content creators, the discord, and even doing my own research with fellowship mates and friends. I love the game. If youâre looking for a decent war game that requires strong communications and teamwork, with a play style similar to risk but with more interaction then this is the game you should try.\n\nNow my only complaint would be how it is advertised to be non pay to win. That is unfortunately a blatant lie. I am not against paying to unlock extra items and I enjoy the season pass rewards. But there is a clear difference in what a Free to Play player is capable of and what someone who spends hundreds (or in the case of our server thousands) on mathoms is capable of. Respect 10 equipment is nearly impossible to get for free to play players let alone upgrade them but you added it as a major feature in season 2 and beyond.\n\nAll Iâm saying is I would love to see some deserved respect and support of your free to play or low spender players. Stop catering towards those who spend massive amounts to gain fully upgraded equipment with the best stats and abilities for multiple commanders. I hope you see this and genuinely consider my input as Iâve seen already some decent response to the community and additions like the new red book challenges.\n\nTLDR: Awesome, Risk-like multiplayer, war strategy game that is outfitted in LOTR theme. Needs to balance Free to Play and Pay to Win.\n\nThis game is super fun! So far, Iâve been playing non stop for 2 weeks. Easy game to play in between tasks at work or around the house. For us long time LOTR fans, this game is incredible for a mobile game. I have a few recommendations for developers. - it would be really fun to have a âgrand exchangeâ where we can trade items with other players across the server (much like RuneScape) - would be sweet if we could send resources (wood, stone, grain etc. To other members of our fellowship/faction) - I would like clarification as to whether mobs have special (rare drops) or not. This would increase incentive and exponentially increase the fun factor. -have no idea what a craftsmanâs contract doesâ¦ still, as there is no description. Just a side note. I feel that the pay to play features imbalance the game just a tad bit as players have access to so much more (gems, mathom box etc. Though I understand itâs importance. Thanks! Will provide more feedback as I continue my conquest for middle earth!\n\nUpdate: game still fun.\n\n-NEED REAL TIME (in-game) language translator; it is a headache to go back and forth translating language with every player. Amazing that we are all from around the world but it would be helpful to have this tool in game."
