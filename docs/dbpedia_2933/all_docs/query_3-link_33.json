        "text": "In this exclusive, deluxe edition you will find the entire content of both Kings and Lords of Middle-earth™, upgraded to ch the quality of our previous limited edition releases:\n\nA beautiful box, with uble lid and magnetic opening, hot-foil printed and embossed, to ch the size and style of the War of the Ring Anniversary Release and Warriors of Middle-earth Limited Edition.\n\nHand-painted miniatures – including the painted version of the Treebeard promo and three versions of each of the Free People sovereigns (starting, Awakened, Corrupted) with a specific color scheme – for a total of 18 figures in Kings, 8 figures in Lords, and Treebeard.\n\nTwo separate perfect-bound rulebooks, one for Kings and one for Lords, with textured covers and special paper.\n\nOverlays and tiles in both standard and deluxe size (compatible with the Deluxe Game or with the larger game board included in Collector’s Edition and Anniversary Release).\n\nA special version of the mini-expansion The Fate of Erebor, with overlay tiles suitable for use with the normal game board, Deluxe Game Mat, and Anniversary/Collector’s Edition game board.\n\nThe promo card set The Seeing-stones.\n\nNumbered authenticity certificate.\n\nLords of Middle-earth™, the first expansion for the War of the Ring™ Second Edition board game, allows players to explore new possibilities and create fresh gaming opportunities and new strategies.\n\nImportant personalities, previously featured in the game only through Event Cards, are represented by specific figures and rules. New Characters include Elrond, Galadriel, Sméagol, Gothmog and the powerful Balrog of Moria, as well as alternate versions of Gandalf, the Witch-king and the Mouth of Sauron.\n\nNew special Action Dice are included: Elven Ring Keepers dice for the Free Peoples player and Lesser Minion dice for the Shadow player.\n\nNew versions of all the Companions of the Fellowship of the Ring are also included, to use with the optional “Council of Rivendell” rules.\n\nAs an added bonus, figures for Aragorn and Gandalf the White are provided, accessories to the game that all true fans want to add to their copy of War of the Ring!\n\nKings of Middle–Earth™, the new expansion for War of the Ring™ Second Edition, introduces Sovereigns and Dark Chieftains. These two new types of Characters represent important personalities of Middle-earth with a vital role in the War of the Ring.\n\nThe Sovereigns of the Free Peoples were targeted by Sauron’s attempts to bend the will of the peoples opposing him — using the palantíri (the seeing stones), through emissaries, like Gríma, and possibly with other subtle and deceitful means. At the same time, it was crucial for the morale of the Free Peoples to rally around these charismatic figures — Brand, Dáin Ironfoot, Denethor, Théoden, and Thranduil — to fight against the Shadow.\n\nThe new rules, miniatures, cards, and Action dice included in this expansion will allow the players to fully develop this conflict and represent the role of these characters in your War of the Ring game.\n\nThis expansion also adds three new Characters, the Dark Chieftains, to the Shadow hosts. Unlike the Ringwraiths, who were fully controlled by the Rings of Power, these powerful leaders of the Shadow Armies had distinct personalities, but ultimately all were subject to the commands of Sauron or Saruman. One Dark Chieftain is included for each of the three Shadow Nations — the Black Serpent, the Shadow of Mirkwood, and Uglúk.\n\nIncludes Hunt tiles and Stronghold tiles suitable for use with both the standard edition and limited editions of War of the Ring, as well as for use with the War of the Ring Deluxe Game Mat.\n\nThese two expansions can be played together or independently.\n\nThis Limited Edition of Kings & Lords of Middle-earth has a total print run of 2000 copies.\n\nTHIS IS NOT A COMPLETE GAME.\n\nA copy of War of the Ring – Second Edition (Anniversary Release or normal version) or of the War of the Ring Collector’s Edition is required to play.\n\nThe War of the Ring, Kings of Middle-earth, Lords of Middle-earth, The Lord of the Rings and the names of the characters, places, items and events therein are trademarks of Middle-earth Enterprises, LLC, used under license by Sophisticated Games and its authorized sub-licensees.
