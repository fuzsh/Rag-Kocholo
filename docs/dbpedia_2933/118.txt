What are the games expected for 2024?

Embracer Group, the franchise rights holder of The Lord of the Rings, has announced five new games set in the Middle-earth universe by early 2024.

The Lord of the Rings: Gollum

The Lord of the Rings: Gollum is the most anticipated game, which has had some delays. It is an action-adventure game developed by Daedalic Entertainment. Of course, it is based on the character of Gollum, a central figure in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.

This game will allow players to take on the role of Gollum and explore the world of Middle-earth from his perspective.

The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria

Return to Moria is a survival and crafting video game set in the abandoned mines of Moria. Free Range Games is developing the game, and North Beach Games will publish it. In this title, players will take on the role of dwarves exploring Moria. They will be facing challenges, and battling dangerous enemies. The main goal is to uncover the secrets of the ancient dwarven city. The game is expected to feature a crafting system and skill tree progression.

The Lord of the Rings: Heroes of Middle Earth

Electronic Arts will publish this game on Google and Apple App Stores. It is a free-to-play collectible mobile RPG. But we know that these types of games have many detractors.

Although free-to-play games have become increasingly popular in recent years, they also have some potential disadvantages. Many free-to-play games include a pay-to-win system, where players can spend real money to gain an advantage over other players. This point can create an unbalanced playing field, making it difficult for players who don’t spend money to compete.

However, we don’t know yet how this game will work, so let’s give it a try.

Weta Workshop’s game

Weta Workshop is a design and effects company based in New Zealand. It has worked on a wide range of projects, including the special effects for The Lord of the Rings and Hobbit film trilogies. So they know very well the J.R.R. Tolkien’s world.

The company mentioned will develop a new game for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Even if we know little about the game itself, the mere prospect of a new adventure in Middle-earth is enough to create so much excitement among fans of the books or films.

What about the fifth video game?

The fifth game is like the true identity and nature of Tom Bombadil. In other words: it is a true mystery.

We don’t know yet since it is most likely an unannounced title. But Embracer is very optimistic about these new projects and their release dates.
