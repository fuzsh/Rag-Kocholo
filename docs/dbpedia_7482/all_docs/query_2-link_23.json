Educated in jazz and classical music at the Royal Academy of Music in London, Jackson's first solo recording, 1979's Look Sharp, was one of the first \"New Wave\" recordings to enjoy widespread popular success. This was quickly followed by I'm the Man later in 1979, and Beat Crazy in 1980, the first a top-40 hit in both the United States and Jackson's native England, and the second, with a reggae-influenced sound, nearly as successful. Jackson was commonly compared to Elvis Costello during this era of his career, for his edgy lyrics and smart, driven music. Then Jackson took a turn, the first of many, in his career, and began experimenting with swing-era jazz on Joe Jackson's Jumpin' Jive (1981), salsa and Latin-inflected percussion on Night and Day (1982), and the jazz and Latin inspired 1984 release Body and Soul. Ira Robbins, editor of the Trouser Press Record Guide, was quoted in Entertainment Weekly as saying: \"What Jackson did after his early success was indulge what turned out to be an extremely superior musical intellect.\"\n\nWith the 1987 release Will Power Jackson began experimenting with ways to incorporate his knowledge of and love for classical music, a trend that became more obvious after he left A & M Records. In 1991 Jackson signed with Virgin Records and produced two theme-based recordings, Laughter and Lust in 1991, and Night Music in 1994, both of which feature significant contributions by other artists, such as Suzanne Vega and Maire Brennan. Heaven and Hell, released in 1997 by the Sony Classical label, was described as a blend of pop and classical styles, while his 1999 release Symphony No. 1 is considered pure classical music.\n\nIn 1994, Jackson told Jim Bessman of Billboard magazine: \"My roots are in classical music more than anything else…. But I make eclectic music because I'm an eclectic person, which most of us are these days. To me, it's the more natural and honest way to go, rather than to consciously make music in a specific genre. Anyway, I can't help it.\" But for some music critics, \"it's easier to admire Jackson's adventurous, eclectic spirit than some of the fruit it bears,\" as Eric Levin put it in People: Throughout his musical career, Jackson has received mixed reviews for his risk-taking approach to making music which, especially in the 1990s, yielded creations that demanded a kind of careful listening unknown in the world of \"Top 40\" pop music. Similarly, Jackson's autobiography, A Cure for Gravity: A Musical Pilgrimage, which focuses on the musician's early career, was deemed rewarding for those most likely to be willing to go on the ride Jackson wants to take them on. \"Jackson presents a portrait of the artist as a young geek,\" wrote a reviewer in Publishers Weekly. The reviewer stated that the author spends much of the book detailing his experiences as a student of classical music, first at the Portsmouth Technical High School, then at the Royal Academy of Music in London. Jackson's success as a musician, starting with the 1979 release Look Sharp, is relegated to a few chapters at the end of the book. Reviewers singled out Jackson's prose, as well as the focus of his subject, for praise. Rosellen Brewer, writing for Library Journal, called A Cure for Gravity \"an honest, gritty look inside the music business and the mind of a musician.\" Booklist contributor Mike Tribby called Jackson's autobiography \"literate,\" noting, \"how many other pop stars would bring up the second Shostakovich string quartet?\"\n\nJackson continued his eclectic professional journey with the 2003 album Joe Jackson Band, Volume 4, a regrouping with his original band from 1978—guitarist Gary Sanford, bass player Graham Maby, and drummer Dave Houghton—as a twenty-fifth anniversary celebration. Jackson wrote all new music for this reunion, which many critics suggested was far from a nostalgic trip into the past. The song \"Awkward Age\" was, according to PopMatters music critic Gary Glauber, a \"likely candidate for [a] radio 'single,' an infectious upbeat bit of advice to an awkward youth.\" Other cuts range from the piano ballad \"Love at First Light\" to \"Fairy Dust,\" \"an acid take on the modern media's ridiculous gay stereotypes,\" according to Glauber, who felt that Volume 4 \"[did] not deliver the same type of music as Look Sharp!, but manages to provide a good pop record nonetheless.\" Similarly, for a BBC Online contributor, Volume 4 was a \"a great, albeit slightly nostalgic piece of work.\" Higher praise came from Soundstage.com reviewer Joseph Taylor, who noted that Jackson \"hasn't lost his ability to write great hooks.\" Taylor further thought that \"Volume 4 has as much power and drive as those early records. Age hasn't mellowed Jackson any.\" Noting that it had been twenty-five years since the band played together, a contributor for Punknews.org observed that \"it doesn't sound like they've missed a beat.\" For this reviewer, Volume 4 was a \"fantastically solid album.\"\n\nJackson also produced a record of the subsequent world tour of his reunion band. Afterlife included some of the songs from Volume 4, but also reprised some of the band's hits, including \"Look Sharp!\" and \"Beat Crazy.\" For Glauber, writing in PopMatters, the album was \"a great tribute to a band that regrouped for 104 dates all across the globe and recaptured the energy and fun that made them such a popular success way back when.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nJackson, Joe, A Cure for Gravity: A Musical Pilgrimage, Perseus/Public Affairs (New York, NY), 1999.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAction Now, April, 1981, \"Jamming,\" p. 42;
