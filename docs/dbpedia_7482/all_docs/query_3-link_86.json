        "text": "You’ll have to excuse me if I didnt realize that Joe Jackson was English until my thirties. I first became consciously aware of him via the sublime music of his Cole Porter flavored 1982 album Night and Day, and the Hirschfeld inspired cover art by Philip Burke sets you in a New York state of mind from the get go, so you’ll have to forgive me if the idea that he was a New Yorker was ingrained in my brain.\n\nI mean, I had heard previous hits “Is She Really Going Out With Him” and “I’m The Man” on the radio, but I didn’t associate them with this Jackson in any coherent manner. Night and Day dropped when I was 15, so, as a hormonal teen, “Steppin’ Out”, “Breaking Us In Two” and “Real Men” SPOKE to me. How that album found me in Monrovia, Liberia is a story in and of itself that involves a US Naval Destroyer, clandestine cassette copying, and unrequieted longing for my best friend’s sister, but I digress. Needless to say, I was a Jackson fan from that moment on.\n\nMy next interaction with Jackson’s ouvre was “You Can’t Get What You Want (Till You Know What You Want)” in 1984, and that segued into a hard turn to his 1981 Jazz-inspired album, Jumpin’ Jive, which has rattled around in my head ever since. I have to say in my own defense, none of this outlay implies that the guy is from the UK.\n\nSo. Jackson’s been in my life for over 40 years. But beyond his 1984 single, I haven’t really followed his later releases. Night and Day, Jumpin’ Jive, and assorted singles have been the flavor percolating.\n\nAs I’ve aged tho, I’ve prioritized seeing artists that meant something to me. So, color me excited when I found out he would be performing at the Orpheum in downtown Los Angeles on June 25th. One of the dudes that shaped me as a dude! In Town! Doing his stuff! Who I’d NEVER seen before! I tried to convince my wife to come along, but she deferred because she said he was going to play music from someone else. No problem. I was doing this solo! I got my ticket (Section F — seat 20), headed down, and was ready for a show. I had done a little research before, so I knew he was splitting the show in two, playing hits in the first half, and then new music with a 9-piece band that included two violin/viola players, piano, upright bass, trumpet clarinet flute trombone tuba. I didn’t care. I’ll take new music if I can savor the old.\n\nSide note: I sat next to this woman — Jennifer (no last name). She’s seen Jackson over 50 times. I’ll tell you what she said after the concert later.\n\nFirst half was amazing… just Jackson in a nice two-piece suit on the piano, playing hits from across the decades, also doing the Kink’s Waterloo Station, being very casual. It was everything I was hoping for. He then stepped away as they reset the stage for the second half… a collection of Max Champion dance-hall songs with a whole band. When he came back, he was transformed.\n\nJackson and his band were all dressed in early 1900 era clothes. The drummer was wearing a striped 1-piece bathing suit, the ladies were in corseted victorian dresses with high necks, the trombone/tube player wore a fez. You get the picture. And Jackson! Wearing a 3/4-length purple coat with top hat and cravat looking uncannily like a transplant from a Gilbert & Sullivan musical.\n\nThey started hard with the Max Champion rant “Why Why Why”, and for the next hour and a half didn’t stop until they had wrung every ounce of bombastic dance-hall joy drama tragedy catharsis out of the theatre. The showmanship exhibited by Jackson and his band was one of the most impressive I have ever experienced, and after, I could only stand up gobsmacked at how transcendent the night had been.\n\nSo getting back to Jennifer (you know, 50+ times Jennifer)… after the show, she turned to me and said “Well, that’s a hell of a first Joe Jackson concert.”\n\nI couldn’t agree more.\n\nMax Champion is a construct made up by Jackson, a beer-hall writer/performer variant of Moulin Rouge’s Harry Zidler, Joel Gray’s Master of Ceremonies from Cabaret, John Neville’s Baron Munchausen, and every over-the-top MC ever put down on celluloid or performed on a theater stage. As performed by Jackson with a cockney accent and a wink in his eye, Max Champion is completely aware of the conceit he is practicing, whether the song is satirical or poignent.\n\nSo, let’s talk about Mr. Joe Jackson Presents: Max Champion in “What a Racket!” Hearing it as Grand Guignol theater, as Gilbert and Sullivan pomposity, as Music Hall theater, Three Penny Opera, a gauzzy Baz Luhrmann bachanalia completely new without hearing the album beforehand was… overwhelming. So much threatricality was on display that it almost seemed too much. I needed to sit down with the album and listen to it.\n\nSo I did, and what came across is a perfect homage that evokes those long-ago dance-hall days, that pays homage to that old-timey environment, and influenced by the rallying jingoistic nature of nationalistic music played during that time. But the music itself is precisely played, and wickedly on point. The skillful performance by Jackson and his band evokes a familiar feel to each song, as if you had heard it someplace before. Whether a Cautionary Tale (“The Shades of Night” or “The Sporting Life”) or a Diatribe (“Why Why Why”, “What a Racket” or “Health and Safety”) Jackson’s figured out how to mimic the old Music Hall feel with a precision that viscerally transports you to a place where you can bump up against the tarts, smell the sweat, and slip on the spilled alcohol. In between, he peppers you with the maudlin “Dear Old Mum — A London-Irish Lament” that’ll bring a tear to your eye, or regales you with the tongue-twister “Think of the Show! — A Thespian’s Lament” that mimics the verbosity of the most bombastic Gilbert & Sullivan aria. He titillates with “Monty Mundy (Is Maltese)!” and the bawdy “The Bishop and the Actress”, which, if you heard without any context, you’d be scratching you head at how this goddamned old-timey lark could be so on-point with the shit-ton of current double-entendres about getting BIZZEE imbedded in it. The remaining two songs on the album, “Never So Nice In The Morning” and “Worse Things Happen At Sea” are an interesting pair, the first being a dirge about waking up and facing the day, and the second a salty admonition to keep your chin up, old chap, things could be worse.\n\n“Never So Nice In The Morning” is bracketed by a waltz chorus that brings to my mind the maniac Jack Nicholson belltower dance from the end of 1989’s Batman, but is obviously based off a much older heritage. It’s saucy and earnest at the same time, and makes you smile at it’s spot-on reflection of the challenge of just opening your eyes when the dawn arises.\n\n“Worse Things Happen At Sea” is a sea shanty that mimics the soldier-on attitude from Vera Lynn’s songs like “We’ll Meet Again” or “Over There” in spite of life’s trials and tribulations, and while somber in topic, is uplifting in performance. And that, is probably the one takeaway from this entire album. At the end of it, you feel uplifted at the can-do take life in stride attitude that permeates it intellectually, and the brilliant superior performance from Jackson and his band of merry players that informs it musically.\n\nSo to get back to 50+ times Jennifer, I’ll be seeing you the next time Jackson rolls into town."
