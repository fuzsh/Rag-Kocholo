        "text": "I haven't seen anyone talk much about late 70s/early 80s singer Joe Jackson. The album Night and Day is a masterpiece (includes the hit \"Steppin' Out\"). A local store I go to plays \"Breaking Us In Two\", another classic. And the video I am sharing is a favorite of mine, \"Real Men\".\n\nIs there any love for JJ here? Favorite songs, memories?\n\nI saw him in concert in the early 80s.\n\nHe was a total asshole. Wanted to control audience reaction.\n\nA veritable Patti LuPone, minus cell phones.\n\nI was convinced he was fucking one of the band who was very pretty.\n\nJackson was never a good looking man, but now he looks like a white guy doing Zhou Enlai drag.\n\nI am a HUGE Joe Jackson fan, have seen him every time he's come around since I was old enough to go, and have tickets to see him in a few weeks. Funny thing, R2, Steppin' Out came out when I was maybe 13 and I hated that \"yuppy music.\" Same thing with Steely Dan's \" Hey 19. \" When it was a radio hit it made my skin crawl. But I listened to Night and Day with fresh ears and fell in love with that whole album, and especially love the shimmering, road-tripping, \"Steppin' Out.\"\n\nI always found him attractive, perhaps not conventionally. I especially find alluring the image of him and the band in the Night and Day gatefold (photo linked below). That looks like a happy vibe I would love to be able to step into at will. His book was a trip. After hearing of the rowdy clubs where JJ got his start, I respect that he knows how to command the stage and not let a few loudmouths ruin it for everyone. In concert, his covers are a treat. \"Girl\" (The Beatles) is one of my favorites.\n\nJoe Jackson is so talented. The successful leap he made from the \"Look Sharp\" and \"I'm the Man\" albums to \"Night and Day\" is extraordinary in pop music.\n\nAnd Night and Day wasn't some fluke, created by a behind-the-scenes producer, it was Jackson's work and he continued to create and release albums that moved away from the new wave, post-punk sounds of \"Sunday Papers\" and \"Is She Really Goin' Out with Him?\"\n\nI was him perform in 2018 or 2019 - an amazing evening. One of the best concerts I've ever seen.\n\nI loved Stepping Out when it was released, though I was just a kid. I think it sort of represented my imaginary life as an adult, in which I went from elegant nightclub to nightclub, sipping cocktails and being devastatingly attractive all over the place.\n\nOf course my adult life wasn't like that at all, but it was a nice dream while it lasted!\n\nSaw Joe Jackson's concert last night in San Francisco. It's fantastic how JJ has maintained his patented vocal tone and delivery over the decades . Wonderful musicianship, arrangements, and presentation. Brilliant as ever.\n\nI love the part of his shows when the rest of the band gets a break and JJ plays a few of his piano/voice-driven songs and cover tunes. Joe Jackson's covers are always interesting, richly colored interpretations, and never note-by-note karaoke like some of these other suckers. Fortunately, someone posted to YT Jackson's cover of ABBA's \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" (linked below). Jackson introduced the song by saying something like (and I'll probably butcher the joke): \"I always cover songs I really like by bands I love. Tonight I thought I would try something different... a song I really like by a band I never loved...\"\n\n\"Stepping Out\" came out during my freshman year in college. It's brightness reminds me of being young. Ilove it. I also like \"Is She Really Going Out with Him?\". \"Breaking US in Two\" has a tune that sounds almost exactly like Badfinger's \"Day After Day\" (which is one of my favorite songs)...I'm kind of surprised that Pete Ham's estate didn't go after Jackson for plagiarism.\n\nI loved his work from the Is He Really Going Out With Her era to around Body and Soul.\n\nHe's bi and apparently, based on a few of my male friends who lived in NYC and met him/met up with him there, has a HUGE cock.\n\nHowever, I can see why R1 responded as they did - have seen him twice, once \"solo\" and once in a special concert where he was playing with a jazz band and a few other acts - and he did give off the vibe of asshole, of \"I don't want to be here.\" The only other concert I ever attended like that was a Squeeze concert, where you could tell all night that Difford and Tillbrook wanted the other to DIAGF, preferably yesterday, and it was torture to be around that vibe.\n\nI don’t listen to him very often but think he is a fine musician. R20’s clip is interesting because he is really performing, just “ out there on his own”. I think that’s pretty cool.\n\nI was a kid when his music was most popular. I do remember hearing that song “Real Men” and sensing that it was like an anthem, very personal and emotional in quality. I admire that.\n\nLove him. Many of his songs are in the permanent soundtrack of my life. Others pop into my head unexpectedly. Last week I found myself singing \"I'm the Man\" for no reason, but it's so fun that even singing it lifted my mood.\n\nI read years ago -- was it here? -- that his lover was a eunuch, and it kind of blew my mind. Was it true? Who knows?\n\nI've read other hints of odd kinks here and there (perhaps no surprise given the lyrics to \"Real Men.\")\n\nSteppin' Out was in heavy rotation on the music video shows and channels when I was an impressionable tween. Like r6 it takes me back to a very key time in my life.\n\nAnd this song wasn't necessarily part of it but like r10 I also had those ideas of what adult life would be like based on TV shows, movies, and music videos. I laugh looking back because it was nothing like what I imagined but it's funny how strong the image still is in my mind"
