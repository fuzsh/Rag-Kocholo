        "text": "JJ is great stuff, listening to the Beat Crazy album as I type. Joe Jackson probably won't ever be in, but hey, at least Madonna is in there. RRHOF is a joke.\n\nPosted by Wayne on Wednesday, 03/14/2018 @ 15:07pm\n\nHe's actually touring this year and coming to a venue near me. If I'm lucky I may get tickets. If I'm verry lucky, he'll actually do his greatest hits, but I doubt if he would. Very eclectic musician. Not a lot of them are in the Hall\n\nPosted by Jason Voigt on Wednesday, 03/14/2018 @ 16:30pm\n\nWayne! I was going to say Janet Jackson and not Joe Jackson?? I just said it! It took forever for The amazing CARS to get in. Thank goodness Rik O. made it in his lifetime, just barely. The last 2 years have been encouraging - some wrongs have been righted, I believe.\n\nPosted by BG Ohio on Monday, 09/16/2019 @ 21:17pm\n\nAbsolutely Joe needs to be in, his albums are always a masterpiecefor maybe 2 or 3 duds but his songwriting and piano also perfect production deserves he be in long ago, Rappers don't deserve to be in, its called Rock n Roll hall of fame rap and hip hop ain't rock, if they only put in rock maybe more deserving artists like JJ would be in, come up with rap hall of fame please\n\nPosted by John muolo on Thursday, 02/11/2021 @ 15:55pm\n\nThere would be no Rick Astley - \"Rick Rollin.\"- if it wasn't for this pure artist... strange how the HOF truly has no clue on true musical influences and bow down to pressure of social discord. Grow some balls and induct those worthy and not what is politically correct to fit an agenda.\n\nPosted by Edwin on Sunday, 03/14/2021 @ 03:09am\n\nJoe Jackson in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is way overdue. The Look Sharpe album is as good as anything the late 70's early 80's post punk new wave movement has to offer. Talking Heads, Blondie, Elvis Costello, Joe Jackson!!! Do the right thing!!!\n\nPosted by Bob Mc Hale on Saturday, 05/15/2021 @ 14:08pm\n\nAabhash,\n\nNow why would you called Elvis Costello, one of the most important songwriters \"average\". He's more than it, he has a discography that's crossed so many genres & his influence is very large. Not to mention, he had a lot of acclaim & won some grammys for his work. That's more than Average, it's being legendary.\n\nPosted by Jordan Einstein on Tuesday, 11/8/2022 @ 13:46pm\n\nJoe Jackson has been my favorite musician since the 1991 album \"Laughter and Lust\" was released. It's true, he doesn't have the voice of Freddie Mercury and Bruce Springsteen and he doesn't have the beautiful image of Elvis Presley. He can't dance as well as Michael Jackson, but compositionally for me he has always been number one, or at least one of the best (in pop-rock). He can go from jazz to rock, classical to punk, pop to funky, folk to country, and in every genre he knows how to be unique and create beautiful songs. Few other artists can do this successfully. It's a sacrilege that he's not yet in the \"Rock n roll of fame\".\n\nPosted by Michele Righini on Wednesday, 11/23/2022 @ 08:48am"
