        "text": "Here's a bunch of reviews:\n\nJoe Jackson looks very sharp indeed on this head-turning debut album that not only crackles\n\nwith the vivacious sonic vigor of mid-Sixties Merseybeat, but also makes explicit (even more\n\nthan the Clash or the Police) the New Wave/reggae connection. In the process, Jackson comes\n\non like a feisty cross between Billy Joel and Elvis Costello, and even pulls off an uncanny Keith\n\nRelf impersonation. Not bad for a Royal Academy of Music graduate.\n\nCut live in the studio and perfectly captured by David Kershenbaum's crisp, lucid production, Look\n\nSharp! is a stripped-down pean to spontaneous combustion, from the neo-Yardbirds raveup of \"One\n\nMore Time\" (complete with dead-ringer Relf-ian warblings and recherché harp playing) through the\n\nvintage Beat-Boom wallop of \"Got Time\" to the Rockpile-style pummeling in \"Throw It Away.\"\n\nEven though \"Is She Really Going Out with Him\" cops its title from the Shangri-Las and \"Pretty Girls\"\n\nopens with a quote from Manfred Mann's \"Do Wah Diddy Diddy,\" Jackson is no cloddish revivalist.\n\nInstead, the LP's most engaging characteristics are its pervasive Caribbean consciousness -- partially\n\ninvoked by the smoky lope of \"Fools in Love,\" but instantly apparent in such other reggae-tinged tracks\n\nas \"Pretty Girls\" and the punchy \"Sunday Papers\" -- and his sometimes acidulous social commentary. In\n\n\"Sunday Papers\" (\"If you wanna know 'bout the bishop and an actress.../If you wanna know 'bout the\n\nstains on the mattress\"), he sounds almost as fed up as Billy Joel, while avoiding Joel's terrible tendency\n\ntoward bombast.\n\nMore to the point, however, is Jackson's occasional resemblance to Elvis Costello, both lyrically (\"Fools in\n\nlove/Are there any creatures more pathetic?\") and melodically (the chorus of \"Happy Loving Couples\" is a\n\nsemiclone of Costello's \"Welcome to the Working Week\"). Most of the time, though, Joe Jackson is his own\n\nman. With proper promotion, he could easily be this year's model in the post-New Wave sweepstakes.\n\n- Kurt Loder, Rolling Stone, 5/31/79.\n\nJackson is a young English singer/songwriter of the Elvis Costello school of sensitive new wave songsters.\n\nJackson sings with a higher voice, his music is not as compressed and taut, and he doesn't sound as angry\n\nas Costello, but the same elements of solid but sparse instrumentation, a somewhat declamatory style in\n\nthe singing and sense of late '70s and early '80s frustration is present in the work of both artists. Backed\n\nonly by guitar, bass, and drums, Jackson plays piano and harmonica. Best cuts: \"Sunday Papers,\" \"Throw\n\nIt Away,\" \"Pretty Girls,\" \"Baby Stick Around.\"\n\n- Billboard, 1979.\n\nIn which an up-and-coming professional entertainer tricks up Britain's latest rock and roll fashion with\n\nsome fancy chords and gets real intense about the perils of romance. Well, better \"Is She Really Going\n\nOut With Him?\" than \"Sunday Papers,\" the social-criticism interlude, which inspires fond memories of\n\n\"Pleasant Valley Sunday.\" B\n\n- Robert Christgau, Christgau's Record Guide, 1981.\n\nNew wave was punk for the masses and it never really caught on, but Jackson's brand, particularly as\n\nexemplified on Look Sharp! was about as popular as it got, with \"Is She Really Going Out With Him?\"\n\nincluded here, being a major hit for him. Joe Jackson is a calculated musician of talent but little exposed\n\nsoul. Still, this recording is filled with bright, catchy music and is a prime example of the seventies new\n\nwave movement. The sound on the disc is very bright, at times to the point of harshness at high volume,\n\nand the sound stage is somewhat confined. Other than that, it is clear and clean. B\n\n- Bill Shapiro, Rock & Roll Review: A Guide to Good Rock on CD, 1991.\n\nHyperactive new-wave rock overlaid with the intelligent, caustic world view of a man as angry as any\n\npunk, but far more perceptive. Includes the hit \"Is She Really Going Out with Him?\" * * * * *\n\n- William Ruhlmann, The All-Music Guide to Rock, 1995.\n\nLook Sharp! presents hyper and bitter pop with a good beat. Jackson rails with intelligence and\n\ninspiration against numerous targets, scoring direct hits with the ugly-guy opus \"Is She Really\n\nGoing Out With Him?\" and the vituperative white reggae of \"Sunday Papers.\" * * * * 1/2\n\n- Allan Orski, Musichound Rock: The Essential Album Guide, 1996.\n\nI found all of these gems here: Joe Jackson - Look Sharp!\n\nOne More Time\n\nB-side \"Don't Ask Me\"\n\nReleased 18 May 1979\n\nRecorded 1978\n\nGenre Rock, new wave\n\nLength 3:15\n\nLabel A&M - AMS 7433\n\nSongwriter(s) Joe Jackson\n\nProducer(s) David Kershenbaum\n\nReleased as the third single from his debut album, Look Sharp!, in 1979. Inspired by a breakup Jackson had, the song features a guitar riff and lyrics detailing a collapsing relationship.\n\n\"One More Time\" was released as a single, but did not see any chart success. The song has since been highlighted as one of the best off Look Sharp! and Graham Maby's bassline has been singled out as praiseworthy.\n\n\"I bought a cheap secondhand upright piano and worked on a song called 'One More Time', with a driving guitar riff and anguished lyrics about the end of a relationship. The guy can't believe the girl wants to leave: Tell me one more time, he says, one more time, one more time. I'd taken a little piece of my breakup with Jill, one moment, one feeling, and embellished it into something else. I guess that's how fiction works: not creating something false, but creating new truths out of bits of old ones. Just as we create new music by endlessly reshuffling the same old chords and scales.\"\n\n— Joe Jackson\n\n----------------------------\n\nThis is a great song and has a great guitar riff that leads us off. Again we have Maby laying down a great solid bass line.\n\nIt is interesting to me that the single did nothing and can only assume that folks hadn't picked up on Jackson yet, and it is also hard to know if the song ever got any airplay.\n\nThat song rocks along at a nice pace.\n\nIt is interesting reading people's reactions to this album, and I actually wasn't aware that this was recorded live in the studio. I think the live in the studio recording explains why folks may hear this as a bit raw and/or brittle sounding. I have actually never really had any problem with the sound of the album.\n\nI guess coming from my background history of listening that the sound was in line with a lot of the stuff I had been listening to anyway. The guitar may have the mids scooped out, but I think it works here in context with the music and also gives Maby's bass more room in the mix due to that. I think the snare is tuned quite high as well and I guess these things all together are what help give it the sound it has. In some ways it is hard to believe this is the same guy that recorded Night And Day, but that is one of the magic things about Jackson's album for me. Yo can listen to them all back to back and not really get bored with them due to the variety and breadth of music covered.\n\nIt took me almost three decades to get fully familiar with this album and recognize its status as a classic. Of course, I knew and liked \"Is She Really...\" from years of hearing it on the radio throughout the '80s, so in 1990, I found a copy of the LP for a $1 in a used bin. I dubbed \"Is She Really...\" to a mix tape, and the rest of the album went unheard for years. (I know, it's sad, but in my youth I was a \"hit single\" guy, and that's all I would play off my LPs and tapes.) I might have played the record once all the way through, but that style of fast, nervy, New Wave didn't fully appeal to me yet. Then in '95 a friend lent me his copy of JJ's live 1980-86 album, and the live version of \"Sunday Papers\" caught my ear, so I then checked out the studio version. Next, while watching reruns of Moonlighting around 2000, one episode featured the title track playing in the background of a scene, so that song finally caught my ear.\n\nFinally, starting in the early 2000s, I began playing the album once a year or so and slowly started getting familiar with it (if anything, I was playing Night & Day and Body & Soul more during this time, since that was the JJ sound I was more familiar with). I remember my roommate at the time, upon hearing me play LS remarked, \"I thought that was either Phish or Primus!\" Apparently Graham Maby's bass lines can transcend genres as well as decades!\n\nThen, a few years ago, I burned a copy of Look Sharp to CD to listen to in the car. This gave me a chance to let the album soak in over several days. I had also picked up The Jam and The Cars \"complete\" box sets around this time, so I was in a New Wave frame of mind anyway. This finally allowed Look Sharp to click into place for me, both historically and personally. That's when I realized, \"Wow, this truly is a classic with hardly a wasted note on it!\"\n\nBetter late than never, eh?\n\nMy wife is a big Billy Joel fan and I'm a big Joe Jackson fan. I do like Billy's early music much more than the later 80's and after. I think Joe has more of an edge than Billy probably because he really came out of the punk/new wave era. Billy stayed away from that and went more mainstream. Look Sharp! is still his best album in my opinion. Joe had a way of putting subtle shots into his music that weren't always obvious but made for some great music. Glad to see him still going strong."
