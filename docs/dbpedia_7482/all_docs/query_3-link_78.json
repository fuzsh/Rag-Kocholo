        "text": "\"I never stopped. I'm always writing a potpourri of music, you know, it's how it is.\"\n\n— Jackson on getting back in the studio, Access Hollywood, October 2006[1]\n\n11th Studio Album is a placeholder name for the 11th studio album by Michael Jackson. This project has never been released, and it was scrapped during its development due to the artist's death on June 25, 2009. The album was confirmed by many people who worked with Jackson, mainly Michael Prince.[2][3][4]\n\nBackground[]\n\nRumors[]\n\nFans began speculating on a new LP from Michael around 2003, two years after the release of Invincible. Gossip would be shared regarding a supposed album under Resurrection, which was scrapped due to the Gavin Arvizo allegations. However, all of this info is regarded as only gossip in the community, as it was never confirmed by any of Michael's collaborators and is very likely false rumors. To this day, some believe the Resurrection album is a real deal, despite no proper evidence being available to support it.\n\nOfficial information[]\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Michael kept on creating new music all the time, whether recorded or not. Most notably, he would be joined by Brad Buxer and Michael Prince, with whom such gems as \"The Loser\", \"Gloucestershire\", and \"Adore You\" would be conceived. For many years to come, however, the tracks wouldn't see the light of day, as Michael had his hands tied with the aforementioned trial as well as financial troubles.\n\nFollowing Michael's victory over the allegations in 2005, he moved to Bahrain, an island country in West Asia, where at the 2Seas Sessions studio composed songs with Abdullah bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.[5]\n\n\"I am incredibly excited about my new venture and I am enjoying being back in the studio making music.\"\n\n— Jackson for Billboard, \"Michael Jackson Sails With Two Seas\" April 18, 2006[5]\n\nOn October 7, Michael traveled to London to record vocals for the charity single \"I Have This Dream\", featuring such guests as Snoop Dogg and Jermaine Jackson.[6]\n\nLeaving Bahrain in May 2006, Jackson went to Ireland, where he'd meet and craft new songs with a member of the Black Eyed Peas, will.i.am. Available titles confirmed to have come from this collaboration include \"Still the King\", \"I Will Miss You\", and \"Dreaming\".[7][8] The two would later focus on remixing material from the Thriller album for a then-upcoming 25th-anniversary re-release.\n\nAfter moving to Las Vegas in December, Jackson continued working on new music at the Palms Recording Studio, where eventually he would be joined by such as Akon, RedOne, or Neff-U in the following years.[9] A lot of their work would end up becoming both new materials (e.g. \"Hold My Hand\", \"Water\") and reworks of much older songs (e.g. \"A Place with No Name\", \"Hollywood Tonight\", \"The Way You Love Me\", \"Throwin' Your Life Away\" or \"Ghost of Another Lover\"). Other times, Jackson had also met with a long-time collaborator, Rod Temperton, who previously worked on Off the Wall, Thriller, and Bad. The King of Pop played several songs to the musician, in hopes of not only pieces of advice from Temperton but seeking his further input as well.[10][11] Michael had also worked on \"Stop Playin'\", a collaboration with T-Pain and Usher, which never got released after getting leaked by one of the personnel.[12] R. Kelly and Ne-Yo revealed that they were in talks to work with Michael respectively as well, and recorded demos for him, but Jackson is said to have never recorded them.[4][13] In December of 2008, the King of Pop once again moved houses, this time to a mansion in Los Angeles, where he and Michael Prince set up a studio in the pool room.\n\nDavid Michael Frank, a composer Jackson had previously worked with in 1989 on \"You Were There\", claimed that two months before the singer's death, he would be approached by Michael yet again to conceive classical music. The King of Pop would invite Frank to his mansion in L.A. where the two would craft arrangements and instrumentals. The only title currently available is \"Lady of Summer\".[2]\n\n\"For one of them, he had a whole section of it done in his head. He had not recorded it. He hummed it to me as I sat at the keyboard in his pool house and we figured out the chords – I guess this recording I made is the only copy that exists of this music. [...] He mentioned more instrumental music of his he wanted to record, including one jazz piece. I hope one day his family will decide to record this music as a tribute and show the world the depth of his artistry.\"\n\n— David Michael Frank for Billboard, July 2, 2009[2]\n\nAs soon as Jackson and his personnel would settle in the UK for the This Is It concerts, works on any new material stopped, but would continue on days off and when the singer simply had the energy for such. Michael Prince also revealed that the singer planned on digital single releases taking place every once in a while, instead of the standard rollout formula. Prince believes it would later allow Jackson to compile these singles into an LP.[3]\n\n\"I'm not gonna release albums anymore. We're just gonna put out a single every couple of months.\"\n\n— Jackson to Michael Prince[3]\n\nThis would seemingly let each song released to become a hit, similar to Jackson's premise for Thriller, where he questioned \"Why can't there be a pop album where every song is a killer?\".[14]\n\nThe King of Pop kept on making music 'til the last days of his life, his final song being an untitled classical piece made in June of 2009, written with Deepak Chopra who Jackson was in contact with twenty-four hours before his passing.[15]\n\nAftermath[]\n\nAfter Michael died, his most recent unreleased music went on to stay in the vault for years to come. However, a few instances took place, where these recordings would get leaked online or even officially released. On December 10, 2010, the first posthumous album under Jackson's name would be released, simply titled Michael. This would feature four of the tracks the King of Pop had recently worked on before his passing; \"Hold My Hand\", \"Hollywood Tonight\", \"(I Like) The Way You Love Me\" and \"Best of Joy\".\n\nWhile will.i.am was approached about including one of his songs he made with Jackson on the Michael album, he refused to release any of their collaborations out of respect for Michael's creative process.[8] Akon confirmed to never released his other recordings as well, as only two were in releasable state (likely \"Hold My Hand\" and \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' 2008\"), while other songs were just rough ideas and concepts.[16] Meanwhile, Kelly released his demos recorded for Jackson, one of which is commonly known to be \"You Are My World\". Ne-Yo later confirmed he still has his recordings, and that he might do something with them in the future.[13]\n\nIn 2010, the United States Copyright Office, ASCAP, and a bunch of other performance rights organizations received registrations for tens of previously unheard songs. While not available to the general public, these can currently be listened to at the USCO in Washington D.C.\n\nSongs[]\n\nMain article: List of unreleased songs\n\nIn 2013, TMZ revealed Jackson's notes left in his house, two of which feature 35 song titles in total, spanning from 2002 sessions up until 2009.[17] It is important to note, however, that this most definitely isn't the track list, but rather songs Michael simply planned on finishing.\n\nNote this list is based on the year each song was last worked on.\n\n2002[]\n\n\"All in Your Name\" (feat.

These would also include discs with albums Jackson would use as inspiration, learning the modern sound to eventually implement it into his creations. These included: FutureSex/LoveSounds by Justin Timberlake, Confessions on a Dance Floor by Madonna, The Dutchess by Fergie, The Emancipation of Mimi by Mariah Carey, Late Registration by Ye, Elephunk by Black Eyed Peas, and more (file no. 152).[18]\n\nIn 2014, a supposed \"lost album\" by Michael Jackson called Bible, conceived in 2007 and written by Eddie Cascio had leaked online. The original disc was auctioned three years later.[19] The record was surrounded with controversy, as the vocals very clearly did not feature Jackson singing and wasn't his work at all. The album featured \"Breaking News\", \"Keep Your Head Up\", and \"Monster\", songs previously released on the posthumous Michael album which received similar reception as Bible overall."
