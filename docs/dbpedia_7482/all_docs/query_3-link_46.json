        "text": "In 1977, RCA took out their famous press ad, “There’s old wave, there’s new wave, and there’s David Bowie.” In many respects, Joe Jackson was that idea of the uncategorisable artist made flesh. Now into his fifth decade as a performer and songwriter, he celebrates with a new album, Fool, and a winding tour that takes him across continents, during which he will be playing his latest material as well as showcasing an album per decade from his extensive repertoire: Look Sharp! for the 70s, Night And Day for the 80s, Laughter & Lust for the 90s and Rain for the 00s.\n\nEmerging during punk and new wave, Jackson often seemed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, changing styles just as wide-scale success beckoned, offering his die-hard fans a mission to follow all his byways. After the angular new wave of his first three albums, which posited him as an angry young nerd to rival Elvis Costello (and, perhaps, Graham Parker), he morphed towards swing for Jumpin’ Jive, and then offered New York-infused metro-pop for Night And Day, before forays into film scores (1983’s Mike’s Murder, 1988’s Tucker), ambient, jazz and classical.\n\nJackson’s numerous stylistic peregrinations (perhaps reflecting his moves, as a child, from Burton-upon-Trent to Swadlincote, Derbyshire to Portsmouth) mark him out as a sort of sonic character actor.\n\n“You could say that,” Jackson offers on the phone from his home in Berlin. “If I don’t really believe in it, I can’t expect anyone else to. I think it’s more so than being an actor, because I’m not assuming a fictional role. I feel like I shouldn’t put out a record unless I really believe in it.”\n\nDoes this mean that, over a lengthy career such as his, the occasional wrong turn may have been taken? “Certainly, yeah,” he replies. “I don’t like to rain on anyone’s parade, [but] there’s a couple of albums that I don’t think were my best. Yet I’ve run into people who’ve told me that they are their favourites. You just never know. I knew I always did the best I could at the time.”\n\nTrained at London’s Royal College Of Music in the 70s, Jackson was an outstanding pianist and arranger, who’d done time as MD for cabaret act Koffee’n’Kreme and been part of Portsmouth band Arms And Legs, who released three collectable singles on MAM. Jackson’s first self-written appearance on vinyl, the 1976 B-side She’ll Surprise You, lays out the cool bossa-MOR that he was to reacquaint himself with in the early 80s. But before then, punk happened.\n\nLank locks chopped, hair spiked and, with a deal at A&M, Jackson appeared as a livid, mouthy, pin-striped 24-year-old new wave elder statesman, telling us, in no uncertain terms, to Look Sharp!\n\n“I thought the angry young man thing was very funny,” Jackson says today. “I imagined this character who did everything angrily; like something from a Monty Python sketch: ‘He wakes up in the morning and he eats his breakfast angrily.’”\n\nCritics labelled him Costello-lite, but he was a great success, especially in he US, where he was considered a credible artist from the off. Jackson’s work carried great weight, but that was often far from the case in the early days.\n\n“A lot of that early stuff was satirical, sarcastic – there was a lot of humour,” he contends. “I think a lot of artists get taken too seriously. Joe Strummer told me once that when he and Mick Jones were writing songs for The Clash they’d be cracking each other up – the lyrics would just be taking the piss. And then they’d read reviews of it, where it was being analysed as political protest, and they’d be cracking up even more. I can well believe that.”\n\nFast-forward 40 years and the anger and humour still course through Jackson’s work. His latest, Fool, was recorded in Boise, Idaho with his live band: longstanding cohort Graham Maby (who has been with him on and off since Arms And Legs) on bass, Teddy Kumpel on guitar and Doug Yowell on drums. The idea was simple: to capture the magic of that outfit in the studio.\n\n“The plan was to record it wherever we ended our last tour; where the last show was, we were going to go to the studio the next day,” he explains. “I loved the fact that it was Boise, Idaho. There was a moment when the tour looked like it might extend to a couple of shows in California, and we’d end up recording in Los Angeles. That would have been horribly boring, because that’s what everyone does. I’m not a big fan of LA. Boise is quite nice, actually. We were in a studio there for a week and a half.”\n\nThe theme of the album became comedy and tragedy. The title track references Shakespeare and is akin to an over-revved sea shanty. “It’s like a party in a song,” Jackson says, “and you never quite know what is going to happen next. I threw in everything but the kitchen sink, everything that seemed silly.” Another standout is the opening track, Big Black Cloud. “That one’s about fear and paranoia – people seem to be scared of more and more things than they used to be,” he decides. “People in authority have always used fear as a way to legitimise themselves; it’s a time-honoured way of ruling people, to more or less say, ‘The sky is falling, but if you support me, I’ll make you safe and keep your children safe.’ What we don’t hear is people being inspiring; there’s more fear-mongering than there is inspiration.” Who does Jackson look to for inspiration in these troubled times? “Louis Armstrong,” he states emphatically. “I have to go back to musical heroes.”\n\nJackson is still the itinerant jobbing musician. He has been living in Berlin for the best part of the last decade, but, as he says, “I tend never to be in one place for that long, really. I can’t seem to escape the gravitational field of New York; I still have a lot of contacts and stuff going on there.” He also keeps a soft spot for Portsmouth, where he grew up, the place that he wrote so passionately about on the track Home Town on 1986’s Big World album. “Home Town was a deliberate exercise in writing a nostalgic song,” he says. “It’s not something I tend to indulge in that much. I think it turned out quite well.”\n\nPortsmouth also offers the backdrop to Dave, one of the standouts on Fool, which is full of Jackson’s trademark complex simplicity, taking the opportunity to cram in as many rhymes with the word ‘Dave’ in the song. “I can’t believe how many people of my age group are called Dave in Portsmouth – maybe all over the country, I don’t know,” he muses. “There was an epidemic of Daves. At some point it sort of burned itself out – we reached peak Dave. Dave is in a similar vein to Home Town, but there are some different ideas in it: are you better off staying in one place or travelling all the time, for instance? Who has really got the better life?”\n\nIt’s this direct, questioning approach that has provided him with several enduring songs, such as his debut hit, Is She Really Going Out With Him? It’s Different For Girls, from the 1979 album, I’m The Man, is another of his most-loved songs, and one which has been used to soundtrack debates around toxic masculinity in the past year.\n\n“It’s Different For Girls was a tongue-in-cheek song where I tried to reverse the stereotypical roles of the boy and of the girl,” he notes. “Some people didn’t get it but I think a lot of people did. I was trying to avoid falling into cliché.” Another perennial Jackson favourite is 1982’s Grammy-nominated Steppin’ Out, which has assumed a life of its own. “It’s flattering,” he admits. “I’ve always aspired to make things that are timeless and not trendy. That’s why, in the main, I avoid lyrics about issues of the moment. They can get dated quickly –\n\nI’m looking for something universal.”\n\nJackson is busy preparing for the upcoming tour. “I often get asked what can we expect, and I always say, ‘Wouldn’t you want a surprise?’”, he laughs. “The only thing I can definitely say is that we’ll do old stuff and new stuff and do the best show we possibly can every night. Beyond that, I tell them, have an open mind.”\n\nWhat we can expect, of course, is eclectic entertainment. “I’ve got to tell you something,” Jackson says, keen to get something off his chest. “I’ve never, ever, made a classical record or a jazz record or a Latin record or a reggae record or any of these things that I’m accused of having done. Every record I’ve made has been a mixture of styles in whatever way I’ve thought is cool to put them together.”\n\nIt’s Jackson’s unique talent for blending these styles that makes him so engaging, even if sustained commercial success has largely eluded him. Not that Jackson is overly concerned. He just loves to play. “We have a good time; this band has good chemistry,” he says. “I always enjoy touring and playing to people.”\n\nAnd this despite approaching his sixth decade in music. “The funny thing is that, at the time, it felt like I’d had a pretty long career,” Jackson recalls of his emergence 41 years ago with Look Sharp! “I’d done my first paying gig at 16, so when I made that first album, I was 24 and I felt like a veteran. It feels really silly looking back on it now – this kind of triumphant arrival! Some of it makes me cringe, but I’m not ashamed of it. I’m quite proud of it in many ways.”"
