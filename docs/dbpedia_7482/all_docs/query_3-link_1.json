        "text": "I was surprised to see a lot of threads about Joe's albums but no dedicated thread for his discography. I thought I would start this but have to warn those folks who want to follow this, there are gaps in my collection so I'll have to hand this off from time to time.\n\nI thought of doing this after listening to the marvelous CD of Body and Soul.\n\nThe first album introduced Jackson's acerbic songwriting style and unique way with 88 keys.\n\nLook Sharp! Immediately established him as an artist of interest. It hit the top 20 in the US and the top 40 in the UK.\n\nReleased Jan 5, 1979 the album did well primarily because of the singles \"Is She Really Going Out With Him?\" And \"Sunday Paper\".\n\n\"One More Time\" – 3:15\n\n\"Sunday Papers\" – 4:22\n\n\"Is She Really Going Out with Him?\" – 3:33\n\n\"Happy Loving Couples\" – 3:08\n\n\"Throw It Away\" – 2:49\n\n\"Baby Stick Around\" – 2:36\n\n\"Look Sharp!\" – 3:23\n\n\"Fools in Love\" – 4:23\n\n\"(Do the) Instant Mash\" – 3:12\n\n\"Pretty Girls\" – 2:55\n\n\"Got the Time\" – 2:55\n\nBonus tracks (2001 reissue)[edit]\n\n\"Don't Ask Me\" – 2:43\n\n\"You Got the Fever\" – 3:37\n\nLike Elvis Costello and Graham Parker, Jackson began as a very prolific artist producing one or two albums a year throughout the 80's.\n\nGreat thread idea! I have to admit that, unlike what appears to be the majority of Joe's fans, I am much less a fan of his first four albums than of his work starting with Night and Day. The production style of those first albums feels sort of clinical to me, and lacking much of the sonic and musical richness that was to come; however, although I prefer his later work, his talent for great pop hooks was already in evidence on that first album. I particularly enjoy the first and last songs, which inject an extra bit of energy into the proceedings.\n\nWhile the debut has never been a particular favorite of mine, it does contain the song that I performed the one and only time I ever found the courage to sing at a karaoke bar.\n\nI remember \"Is She Really Going Out With Him?\" hitting the radio and it being a really new and exciting song. There was a lot of music like that in 1979, but to this day, that single takes me back.\n\nIt's a great album, and one of the few of his I had on vinyl. Sorta frustrating on CD, as it's just not a great recording and I'm pretty sure it will never sound much better than it does now. There are several CD masterings and they all seem to vary by song.\n\nAnyhow, a great power pop album!\n\nI love Joe Jackson's early albums and I love a lot of his later albums too. Look Sharp is a great debut. The focus is on a tight band, biting lyrics and as already mentioned, great hooks. A bit \"of it's time\" and it probably works best when you're the same age as Jackson was when he recorded it, but the talent on display can't be denied. And we now know this was only scratching the surface. Had Jackson's debut touched on every style he would be doing over the next twenty years, it would surely have scared people away.\n\nCan't say the three disc Ultimate Collection is much better (well, its slightly better with a max as i recall of 11)but it does have the complete Mike's Murder which only received 2 CD releasesthat I know of (outside of the songs for MM which ended up on the horrible sounding reissue of Night and Day).\n\nJumping back into this album--I also recall quite a bit of air play for Sunday Papers another very catchy single. I recall someone comparing Is She being co pared to The Cars by some nameless radio DJ back n the day. I just don't really hear it.\n\nThe debut album sounded pretty fresh when it came out, but I don't find myself reaching for it at this point. The exception is the song Got the Time, which I still like to hear. Is She Really Going out with Him was a big hit by the standards of the new wave, and perhaps as a result, I quickly tired of it.\n\nAfter a long rest I was able to get back into it. I just love the structure of the song. Little joys, little joys.\n\nI will certainly be a participant in this forum. I have been a fan since I first heard JJ at the ripe old age of 12 (me, not him).\n\nThis is what I did with Look Sharp! & the a couple other early albums of JJ's. Well, I built this mike & stand out of a stick, cardboard & large felt pen, and man, I would sing, sing, sing! Other kids might pretend to be in Judas Priest or Kiss, but for me it was Joe Jackson. This is SHTV confession time, right?\n\nFor me, I love the pop simplicity of Look Sharp! but with a definite attitude.\n\nBut unnecessary. Just point it out. Maybe I'm reading into your post but it does come across With more than a bit of attitude. Just state the facts...we have another threat, etc. from over two years ago, etc.\n\nAnyway, we can discuss Joe's albums (in no particular order) if anyone wants since the album by\n\nalbum thread was over two years ago.\n\nThat is exactly what pulled me in on to this \"new wave\" album.\n\nI remember it coming out in my senior year of high school and I then jumped onto the skinny tie bandwagon...well started back in late '78 with seeing The Jam on one of those late night video shows. However, this was a little bit different than The Jam...and Elvis Costello and Graham Parker, which a lot of my friend pitted against JJ. I liked his voice a lot, but that bass of Graham Maby's.....WOWSA!\n\nI don't know how much I'm going to participate on this thread, as I had a bit of spotty like/dislike of JJ, but I definitely championed his first LP."
