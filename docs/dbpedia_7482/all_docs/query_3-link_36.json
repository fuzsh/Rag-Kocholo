        "text": "If you’re a music fan and haven’t already heard of Rick Beato, I highly recommend you visit his YouTube channel and poke around a little, or – more likely – so much so that you jeopardize your job and marriage. Music is a rabbit hole that’s easy to fall into, and Beato makes it all the more enjoyable by relating interesting aspects of music without dumbing things down and without condescension. Particularly enjoyable is his “What Makes This Song Great” series in which he dissects classic rock songs, isolating tracks and playing along with amazing virtuosity, while revealing what makes the song stand out.\n\nRick recently made a video of the “20 Greatest Keyboard Intros Ever,” and since I’m a keyboard guy, before watching the video I quickly made my own list, inspired mostly by song intros that I learned (or tried to learn) starting back when I was around twelve years old to – most recently – intros I learned for bands I play in now. Only three of the songs Beato covered made my list, but I kicked myself for forgetting to include Rush’s Signals and Genesis’s Dancing in the Moonlit Night, both of which I learned back in the early 80s.\n\nWithout further ado, here are my Top 20 keyboard Intros that I recall learning over the years:\n\n1) Bloody Well Right – Supertramp\n\n2) Foreplay – Boston\n\n3) Angry Young Man – Billy Joel\n\nThese overlap with Beato’s list, all essential inclusions, and although I thought I learned them all when I was a teenager, even performing “Foreplay” in the 1984 Brookfield Central Battle of the Bands, it wasn’t until I reached my 40s that I actually learned how to play these intros correctly. All are great fun, highly satisfying intros that still mess me up from time to time. The latter is a bitch to play unless you’re on a grand piano – I’ve found keyboards don’t have the action required for the rapid repeated notes. Then again, maybe it’s just my playing.\n\n4) Another Man’s Woman – Supertramp\n\nI could fill my Top 20 list with nothing but Supertramp songs (“From Now On,” “Take the Long Way Home,” etc.), but if I limit it to two, this has to be the other inclusion. Another wonderful Rick Davies intro.\n\n5) Levon – Elton John\n\nBuying the Elton John Greatest Hits album in the winter of 1979-1980, followed shortly thereafter by an accompanying piano book, was monumental for me, opening up a whole new world of piano playing that went beyond Michael Aaron lesson books. I could easily pick twenty Elton John intros for this essay (“Skyline Pigeon,” “Idol,” “Take Me to the Pilot,” etc.), but “Levon” is the one that made the biggest impression on me.\n\n6) Nobody Home – Pink Floyd\n\nThat same winter of 1979-1980, Pink Floyd’s The Wall made its debut, and – prior to me playing by ear more frequently – this was another piano book that inspired me. This intro isn’t earth-shattering, but it sets the melancholy song up so well. Very tasty.\n\n7) Fooling Yourself – Styx\n\nFor a young keyboardist, this Styx song was highly satisfying, as it was easy to reproduce the original part note for note and even get the synth patch pretty close (often not such an easy task on a four-octave Korg Delta keyboard). Nothing fancy here, but effective.\n\n8) Fire in the Hole – Steely Dan\n\n9) Aja – Steely Dan\n\nMy brother challenged me to learn “Fire in the Hole,” and I got it kinda sorta down before moving onto “Aja.” Today, I could learn these songs with a bit of hard work, but I remember struggling mightily just trying to figure out the opening chord to “Aja.” I didn’t even know what a major seventh chord was at the time, so I was at a distinct disadvantage! I remember showing my piano teacher Fred Tesch what I had written out on manuscript paper, and he immediately wrote out a bunch of chords that I needed to master, which subsequently made learning songs a helluva lot easier.\n\n10) Trilogy – Emerson, Lake and Palmer\n\n11) Awaken – Yes\n\nThese songs provided a different sort of challenge. Instead of blues and jazz-based chords, these intros were more classically-influenced, and once the patterns were deciphered, they weren’t too difficult to learn. The fast runs of “Awaken” are merely suspended chords and pretty easy to play. But again, they sound really tasty.\n\n12) Trampled Under Foot – Led Zeppelin\n\nPerhaps an odd one to include, as it’s a whopping two measures long, but in the days when learning a song meant placing down the needle on a record, lifting it, plunking out a few notes on a keyboard, placing the needle back down on the record (but too far to the right, so the fade out of “Houses of the Holy” was still audible), listening, lifting, playing, dropping, listening, lifting, playing, etc., learning even a two-measure intro wasn’t so easy! Also, not understanding pentatonic and blues scales made it a lot more challenging.\n\n13) Jungle Land – Bruce Springsteen\n\nRoy Bittan’s handywork was a lovely work of art to reproduce, not only the intro here but the entire song. Monumental.\n\n14) Abacab – Genesis\n\nMy high school band took on this song and did a pretty damn good job of it! Once again, when I relearned this song about five years ago, I realized that my ears hadn’t picked up on a few things back in mid-80s. YouTube set me straight as it always seems to do.\n\n15) Target – Joe Jackson\n\n16) Be My Number Two – Joe Jackson\n\nThe former’s Latin-based piano part is probably a joke to those who know the ins and outs of this style of music, but for my young ears in 1982, I didn’t understand what was happening here at all. It wasn’t until the late 80s that I finally wrote out the parts to figure out the syncopation. I never did master Latin patterns and rhythms the way I’d like, but I got this Joe Jackson part down pretty well. “Be My Number Two” was more my speed, and I love hearing what Joe’s done to the middle section lately when he plays live, modulating every two measures or so before resolving back to the original key.\n\n17) The Way It Is – Bruce Hornsby\n\nI can’t tell you how exciting this song was for a piano player in 1986. In a decade awash with synth sounds, this was an honest-to-goodness piano track, and playable too! The solo later in the song required more finesse, but even that was doable. Bruce put piano back on the map.\n\n18) Locomotive Breath – Jethro Tull\n\nThis is another one I kinda sorta learned until recently, when YouTube came to the rescue. Slowing things down at half-speed sure makes the faster runs a lot easier to dissect! I just played this intro last month at a gig and had a lot of fun doing it.\n\n19) The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway – Genesis\n\nThis gets my vote for the best keyboard intro ever. In typical Tony Banks fashion, the chord progression here is insanely odd – something I’d never come up with in a million years. It’s also – like “Angry Young Man” – hard to play (for me, anyhow) without a grand piano, and even then I’ll still mess up the final run. I learned this intro for a proposed Genesis tribute band that never came to fruition, but it was so much fun to learn.\n\n20) Year of the Cat – Al Stewart\n\nThere’s more to this intro than meets the eye, as after the initial memorably eight bars the piano delves into some interesting voicings that aren’t so easy to hear initially. This intro captures the mood of the song perfectly.\n\nSo there you are – my Top 20 Keyboard Intros. Oddly absent are any songs by Ben Folds, especially “Philosophy” and “Landed,” but only because I haven’t actually learned those songs. Why? I don’t know. Ben Folds was a breath of fresh air when the debut album came out in 1995, as important to me in my late 20s and early 30s as Elton John was to me in my teens, but I still need to learn the tunes.\n\nSome other honorable mentions:\n\n1) Sweet Dreams – The Eurythmics\n\n2) 1000 Miles – Vanessa Carlton (it once again put piano back on the map in the 2000s.)\n\n3) Take on Me – Uh Huh\n\n4) Waiting for a Girl Like You – Foreigner (read about how Thomas Dolby came up with this intro – amazing!)\n\n5) Lady Madonna – The Beatles\n\n6) Don’t Do Me Like That – Tom Petty (the piano is sparse and simple, and the organ is perfect)\n\n7) Jump – Van Halen (of course)\n\n8) Atlantic – Keane (man, I love this eerie opening)\n\n9) The Great Gig in the Sky – Pink Floyd\n\n10) Vienna - Billy Joel\n\n11) Head over Heels - Tears for Fears\n\nLot of great stuff to choose from! If you’ve got any others I should have mentioned, send them my way.\n\nThirty down with another twenty below. This list of albums I can’t live without is limited to rock/pop albums, no greatest hits or typical live albums are allowed, and double albums count for two picks unless only two sides are chosen. Here are my first thirty entries, in no particular order:\n\nKean - Hopes and Fears\n\nAerosmith - Toys in the Attic\n\nInnocence Mission - Umbrella\n\nJackson Browne - Standing in the Breach\n\nLyle Lovett - The Road to Ensenada\n\nFleetwood Mac - Tusk (sides 1 and 2)\n\nFleetwood Mac - Tusk (sides 3 and 4)\n\nRadiohead - The Bends\n\nCompany of Thieves - Ordinary Riches\n\nStevie Wonder - Songs in the Key of Life (sides 1 and 2)\n\nThe Pursuit of Happiness - Love Junk\n\nBig Country - Peace in our Times\n\nPink Floyd - The Wall (sides 1 and 2)\n\nPink Floyd - The Wall (sides 3 and 4)\n\nRandy Newman - Little Criminals\n\nRandy Newman - Bad Love\n\nBad Examples - Kisses 50¢\n\nPaul Simon - Suprise\n\nOff Broadway - On\n\nJoni Mitchell - Court and Spark\n\nLloyd Cole - Don’t Get Weird on Me Babe\n\nPhil Collins - Hello, I Must Be Going!\n\nThe Who - Quadrophenia (sides 1 and 2)\n\nGabriel Kahane - Where are the Arms\n\nSupertramp - Crisis? What Crisis?\n\nSupertramp - Breakfast in America\n\nR.E.M. - Automatic for the People\n\nYes - Close to the Edge\n\nElton John - Madman Across the Water\n\nElton John - Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\n\nUp to speed? Okay - here are my next twenty selections in detail:\n\nRickie Lee Jones – Rickie Lee Jones (1979). Wow, what a debut. I’m not sure how an unknown singer managed to nab Steve Gadd, Dr. John, Randy Newman, Jeff Porcaro, etc. to accompany her, but having first-class musicians to backup your debut sure doesn’t hurt! Jones’s next two albums are also wonderful, but listening to them front to back, her debut is the standout, with nary a weak track to be found, offering a wide ranging output: playful, nostalgic, desperate, loving and chilling. “Last Chance Texaco” and “On Saturday Afternoons in 1963” are favorites of mine. That’s another release from 1979. More to come!\n\nPete Townshend – White City: A Novel (1985). Just a few years post-Who, Townshend returns with an excellent solo effort, a sort of story (though I’ve never followed it) taking place in a section of London in the 60s, Townshend surrounds himself with a terrific cast of musicians and focuses on short, melodic songs without getting too bogged down in the story it’s supposed to tell. Instead, we’re simply left with a solid set of songs, with “Crashing By Design” the highlight.\n\nAimee Mann – Music from the Motion Picture Magnolia (1999). Mann’s first solo effort in 1993 has a few of my favorite tracks ever, but six years later her soundtrack to a film that left my jaw on the floor upon first viewing hits the nail on the head. Once in a while a soundtrack is so inextricably linked to a movie, the opening chords of a song like “Wise Up” is enough to send chills down the spine and transport one right back to the film. Mann has such a knack for writing lyrics that so perfectly describe a character, it’s easy to overlook the labor that Mann must expend to finish a song. Either that or she’s just plain brilliant. Maybe both. But this is a great album filled with wonderful characterizations. The soundtrack also two Supertramp songs and a few other cuts, but the album stands on Mann’s contributions alone. Jon Brion produces and adds his tasty flavoring throughout.\n\nLed Zeppelin – Physical Graffiti, Sides 1 and 2 (1975).\n\nLed Zeppelin – Physical Graffiti, Sides 3 and 4 (1975). Funny how some songs grate on you after decades of being overplayed while others sound as fresh and urgent as the first time you heard them. For me, Led Zeppelin’s sixth album is full of the latter. I’ve never gotten tired of hearing the ball-busting intro to “Kashmir.” If I were a professional baseball player, that would be my song when I came up to bat. (Think it’s weird to fantasize about being an MLB player? Yeah, fair enough.) “Ten Years Gone” is among the most beautifully-crafted songs ever produced, with Page’s multiple guitar tracks interweaving perfectly into a sublime climax. With just the right balance of rockers and softer tracks, long and short, blues-based and folk-based, Physical Graffiti is one of the best albums in rock history.\n\nGenesis – A Trick of the Tail (1976). My favorite Genesis albums have shifted over the years. Wind and Wuthering and Selling England by the Pound used to be tops, but these days if I am to pick a few albums by one of my top two favorite prog-rock bands, one has to be the first album with Phil Collins on lead vocals. I’ve never been one of those goofballs who claim that Genesis after Peter Gabriel isn’t worth the time of day. This album is a kick-ass clinic on all things prog, from shifting time signatures, obscure and fanciful lyrics and deft musicianship, but unlike many bands in this genre, Genesis manages to achieve all the essential elements while crafting beautiful melodies over challenging harmonic structures, with just enough lyrical universality to entrance the listener. Take “Mad Man Moon,” a preeminent track composed by keyboardist Tony Banks. I couldn’t tell you exactly what the song means or what Banks intended, but it seems to tell a tale of a man who leaves his loved-one in search of glory, and winds up in a desert, where he keenly observes how no matter where you live, the grass appears to be greener elsewhere. Nothing miraculous there, but beautifully stated over absolutely sublime chord changes, with a mid-section of subtle percussion and piano. It’s just a perfect, standout track on a standout album. Only the unfortunate “Robbery Assault and Battery” keeps this album from being flawless.\n\nBen Folds Five – Ben Folds Five (1995).\n\nBen Folds – Rockin’ the Suburbs (2001). Just like I can’t overstate the importance of Supertramp to the 11 year-old me, I can’t tell you how revitalized my interest in music became when I first heard Ben Folds Five on WXPN, Philadelphia. Finally, a pianist with edge, wit and chops, with a kick-ass drummer and bass player to boot. This music influenced my own compositions in a big way, much like Randy Newman had just a few years before. The debut album holds up oh, so well, and so do the second and third albums, but if I have to choose one from Ben Folds Five, it has to be the one that put them on the map, with “Philosophy,” “Underground” and “Boxing” the highlights. And a mere six years later, Ben Folds releases an almost perfect solo effort, with some of this most exciting and moving pieces to date. “Still Fighting It,” “Gone” and “Not the Same” are my favorites.\n\nMarc Cohn – Burning the Daze (1998). You know him for his pseudo hits, “Walking in Memphis” and “Silver Thunderbird,” and while his debut album is undeniably solid, it’s his third album that grabs me and doesn’t let go. Oddly, Cohn plays virtually nothing from this release when he performs live, and one gets the feeling that he’s lost all affinity for it. This collection of songs is deep and dark, delving into the insecurities and baggage that humans carry with them on convoluted paths, with “Lost You in the Canyon” a standout, a song whose lyrics about disconnection from a loved one could be applied to society as a whole twenty years later\n\nRufus Wainwright – Want One (2003). To date, this is Wainwright’s crowning achievement, a fifty-eight minute single release absolutely packed with memorable tunes, lush arrangements and lyrics that are utterly empathetic to the human experience. “I Don’t Know What It Is” is one of my favorites tracks ever, “14th Street” is a gem, and “Dinner and Eight” brings me to tears if I’m in the right sort of mood (or, perhaps, the wrong sort of mood). Wainwright sometimes aims high and misses the mark – which is entirely forgivable – but with Want One he hits the bulls-eye. In the age of streaming, you’ll be hard-pressed to hear highly-produced (i.e., expensive) albums like this being recorded anymore.\n\nSara Bareilles – Kaleidoscope Heart (2010). Hey, I stand by this, so back off! Bareilles is ridiculously talented, a pop-melodist extraordinaire, and I love that her lyrics are both vulnerable and strong, providing a great role model for youth and elders alike, male or female, but there’s no denying that she played an important musical role in my daughters’ upbringing. “Uncharted” and “Let the Rain” are standouts.\n\nBilly Joel – Turnstiles (1976). I wasn’t aware of just how good an album this is until a few years ago. I knew all but two of the songs, but hadn’t realize they were all from the same album, self-produced by Billy Joel after relocating back to New York after a stint in LA. Joel is a consummate lyricist, and the greatest pleasure in listening to his songs – aside from impressive melody – is picking up on lyrics like “Now as we indulge in things refined/We hide our hearts from harder times.” None of Joel’s albums is perfect, and Turnstiles is no exception, with “All You Want to Do Is Dance” the clunker on Side A, but the other good stuff is so good, I’ll allow it.\n\nPaul McCartney – Chaos and Creation in the Backyard (2005). Tug of War and Flowers in the Dirt aren’t nearly as good as I remember them, Back to the Egg is a favorite with just a few too many weak points, Ram may be in vogue with the critics but it really doesn’t measure up, and Band in the Run is undoubtedly a worthy contender, but for me McCartney’s 2005 release is the most solid album from start to finish, and it’s one that speaks to me more lyrically than the nonsensical words on some of his other releases. I’ve written about Chaos and Creation before, but suffice to say that it’s a great effort with beautiful melodies that are much more complex than they appear to be at first glance. My one gripe is that I’d love to have more backup vocals – I can actually hear where they should go and what they should be – but producer Nigel Godric opted for a sparser album.\n\nSteely Dan – Gaucho (1980). Aja is probably their crowning achievement, but I’m kind of tired of the tracks, and I don’t really like “I Got the News.” Instead, I choose the smooth-jazz follow-up, Gaucho, an album that makes me want to drink a dirty martini in a high-class nightclub. Polished beyond belief – you can read stories about the lengths that Donald Fagen and Walter Becker went to to get the sounds they wanted – it still breathes humanity and musicianship. “Babylon Sisters” and the title track are my favorites here.\n\nJoe Jackson – Look Sharp! (1979). One more from 1979! Joe Jackson has put out so much great material in so many different genres over four decades, I feel a little bad for picking his very first effort, but there’s simply no denying its magnificence. From top to bottom, Jackson effuses sarcasm and wit with enough insight and substance to keep it from getting downright cranky, and he wades into the waters of so many different musical feels – the breakdown of the title track, the manic anxiety of “Got the Time,” the reggae feel of “Fools in Love” – that it never gets redundant. My favorite lyric: “Happy loving couples/in matching white polo-necked sweaters/reading Ideal Homes magazine.” Fantastic!\n\nJoe Jackson – Blaze of Glory (1989). Just a decade later Joe put out his most ambitious record to date, the fifty-seven minute-long Blaze of Glory that he played in its entirely when I saw him in September that year. Each album side plays uninterrupted, beginning with the idealistic outlook of a young man who eventually grows disillusioned and who has to scratch and claw his way to an unsatisfying, but inevitable, consolation. Bold and beautiful, the only unfortunate aspect of the album is the highly produced and electronically triggered snare and tambourine sounds. When I saw him live these sounds were prerecorded (or triggered somehow), the drummer literally avoiding playing the snare. It sure was the 80s! I found this album on vinyl a few years ago for something like $8 and was ecstatic.\n\nThe Hush Sound – Like Vines (2006). I was turned onto this band after some of its members who attended my town’s local high school rehearsed in my neighbor’s garage, but this isn’t some homer fascination with a local band. The Hush Sound is serious shit, having produced three albums and gone onto do other musical projects both individually and together. With a beautiful melding of male vocalist Bob Morris and female vocalist Greta Salpeter, the band produced fabulous dynamic changes from sweet piano waltzes to ballsy guitar rockers and was on regular rotation throughout much of my children’s upbringing. Greta’s voice and influence grew as the band went on (she was all of 17 when the first album was recorded), but it’s this second album that balances both singers’ influences in perfect harmony. I see on-line and on Spotify that “Wine Red” has been remixed into a positively horrendous dance tune, a black spot for anyone with musical taste. If you take the jump, find the original CD avoid this egregious affront to music lovers.\n\nSimple Minds – Once Upon a Time (1985). Two years before The Joshua Tree, I felt like this Scottish band was accomplishing what U2 was still hoping to achieve: a consistent, powerful album with mass appeal and a unifying sound. One Upon a Time is nearly perfect, with each of the first five tracks absolute juggernauts. When they performed “Ghost Dancing” at Live Aid in Philadelphia, I’m not sure the American audience quite knew how blessed they were. The band’s next album, Street Fighting Years, a whopping four years after, was such a disappointment, it gets my vote for worst follow-up to a magnum opus ever.\n\n10,000 Maniacs – In My Tribe (1987). This could have gone either way: the band’s 1987 release or its last with singer/songwriter Natalie Merchant, Our Time in Eden. The latter packs more punch in parts, but the former album marked a clear delineation for me when I purchased it at Tower Records on Mass Ave in Boston instead of Toto’s seventh album. I chose something new, something progressive, instead of the usual fair I’d been accustomed to. I’ve never turned my back entirely on classic rock bands, but this purchase opened the door to Elvis Costello, Innocense Mission, and on and on. This is a terrific release. I’m ashamed to say – or maybe the U.S. education system should be ashamed – that I didn’t know who Jack Kerouac was in 1987, so that upon hearing the second song on the album – my favorite – I didn’t know who or what Merchant was singing about. I just knew it was good. Just as this album opened up musical doors, it also opened up literary doors, as On the Road was soon part of my library.\n\nJames Taylor – Never Die Young (1988). James Taylor is an American treasure, but he’s laid a few eggs in his time, and few of his albums are terrific from front to back. I thought I might pick Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon, but then returned to a tried and true album that I listen to regularly: Never Die Young. Aside from the fact that I have a personal relationship with this album – my wife and I danced our first dance as a married couple to “Sweet Potato Pie” – there’s just a lot here to like: the quirky “Valentine’s Day” that I fondly recall Taylor playing it at a concert back in 1996, and an ostensibly silly song like “Sun on the Moon” that’s actually quite poignant, speaking to the rat race that many of us choose to engage in. The only tune I could do without is the last on the album, “First of May,” which is kind of ironic, as this track was the sole representative of the album on JT’s most recent tour. Go figure. Probably played better live.\n\nSo there you are! One more entry and I’ll be finished with my list of albums I can’t live without. Stay tuned as we ramp up into the new year."
