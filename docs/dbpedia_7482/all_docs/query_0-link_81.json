        "text": "Recently, it was time again for Turntable Talk, a fun monthly recurring feature hosted by Dave who pens the great A Sound Day blog, where he invites posts from fellow bloggers on topics he picks. This time the ask was to write about an album which had cover art or packaging we dig. Following is my contribution, which first was published on Dave blog on June 18. The post has been slightly edited to fit the format of this blog.\n\nSummer is back and so is Turntable Talk, the gift that keeps on giving! In this 27th round of the monthly feature, host and fellow blogger Dave asked us to write about the packaging of an album we like, be it the cover art, the liner notes or any inserts. Sometimes when Dave sends us a topic, I have to sleep on it. In this case, not only did I decide right away that I wanted to focus on an album cover, but I also immediately knew which cover I wanted to highlight.\n\nMy spontaneous pick may be surprising, given there are so many albums with great covers. The Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side of the Moon, The Rolling Stones’ Sticky Fingers, Nirvana’s Nevermind and Deep Purple’s In Rock are some that come to my mind. When making my decision which album cover to write about, I only thought of The Dark Side of the Moon as the next option after I had decided on my pick: Breakfast In America by Supertramp.\n\nWhile my decision to get the album on vinyl around the time it was released in March 1979 was solely driven by the music, I’ve always thought Breakfast in America has one of the coolest covers I know, especially the front. The cover was conceived by English designers Mike Doud and Mick Haggerty. It resembles a view of Manhattan through an airplane window. In the front there’s an image of American actress and singer-comedienne Kate Murtagh as the Statue of Liberty. She’s dressed as a diner waitress, holding up a glass of orange juice on a small plate in one hand (instead of the statute’s torch) and in her other hand a menu titled “Breakfast In America.”\n\nBut the truly amazing thing to me is the depiction of Lower Manhattan in the background: an assortment of breakfast items and utensils, including a cornflake box, ashtray, cutlery, pancake syrup bottles, egg crates, salt and pepper shakers, coffee mugs, ketchup and mustard bottles, etc. The twin towers of the World Trade Center (at the time) appear as two stacks of boxes. There’s also a breakfast plate representing The Battery, formerly known as Battery Park, a public park located at the southern tip of Manhattan.\n\nThe back cover photo is less spectacular but certainly fits well. It shows the members of Supertramp, with each reading their respective hometown newspaper. Kate Murtagh makes another appearance as the diner waitress. The image was taken at a Los Angeles diner called Bert’s Mad House. I suspect it no longer exists, though I couldn’t verify that.\n\nThe cover won Breakfast in America one of two Grammys at the 1980 awards, for Best Album Package, defeating albums by Chicago (Chicago), Talking Heads (Fear of Music), Led Zeppelin (In Through The Out Door) and Joe Jackson (Look Sharp!), among others. The album also won in the category of Best Engineered Non-Classical Recording and received nominations for Album of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.\n\nSince this is a music-related post, I’m leaving you with three songs from Breakfast in America. All were written by co-founder and co-frontman Roger Hodgson (vocals, keyboards and guitars), who penned most of the band’s hits.\n\nThe Logical Song\n\nBreakfast in America\n\nTake the Long Way Home\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube\n\nIt’s Friday and time for another installment of Chris & Max Pick…, a song series started by fellow blogger Max from PowerPop in June 2023. He covered the years 1955 through 1995, and I’ve picked it up beginning with 1996, fiercely determined to take it all the way to 2024. Max generously agreed to be in for the ride. Today we shall take a look at 2003.\n\nJoe Jackson Band/Awkward Age\n\nThe first pick is Joe Jackson who rightfully has been called a chameleon. Over a 45-year recording career, the British artist has explored multiple genres, such as pub rock, new wave, punk, ska, swing, pop and, most recently, music hall. For his 16th studio release from March 2003, Jackson decided to revive the band who had backed him on his first three albums – guitarist Gary Sanford, bassist Graham Maby and drummer David Houghton – and appropriately call it Volume 4. Here’s Awkward Age, which like all tracks was penned by Jackson who provided piano, organ, electric piano, melodica and lead vocals. Great song!\n\nThe Jayhawks/Save It For a Rainy Day\n\nIn April 2003, The Jayhawks came out with their seventh studio album Rainy Day Music. I didn’t know the alternative country and rock band at the time, who started out as a short-lived trio in 1984 in Minneapolis, Minn. before expanding to a four-piece. By the time they recorded Rainy Day Music, their line-up featured co-founders Gary Louris (guitar, vocals) and Marc Perlman (bass, vocals), along with Stephen McCarthy (pedal steel guitar, banjo, lap steel guitar, vocals) and Tim O’Reagan (drums, percussion, guitar, conga, vocals). All except McCarthy remain with the group to this day. Here’s Save It For a Rainy Day, written by Louris. Love their warm sound and neat harmony vocals!\n\nJohn Hiatt & The Goners/My Baby Blue\n\nEver since I started exploring John Hiatt a few years ago, I’ve loved the singer-songwriter whose songs have been covered by the likes of Bonnie Raitt, Emmylou Harris, Delbert McClinton and Bob Dylan. My Baby Blue, a personal favorite, appeared on Hiatt’s seventh studio album Beneath This Gruff Exterior, released in May 2003. Like on on 1988’s Slow Turning and 2001’s The Tiki Bar Is Open, he was backed by The Goners. This time, they received front cover credit.\n\nFountains of Wayne/Stacy’s Mom\n\nWhile Fountains of Wayne were a one-hit wonder, the New Jersey-based power pop band developed a dedicated fanbase. Between 1995 and 2013 with a two-year hiatus from 1999 until 2001, the group released six albums. They never formally announced their breakup. Original member Adam Schlesinger who also co-founded a few other bands, wrote songs for TV and film and was a producer, passed away in April 2020 due to complications from COVID. Stacy’s Mom, off the band’s third studio album Welcome Interstate Managers from June 2003, became their Grammy nominated hit. Apparently, many of their fans don’t think it’s their best. But it’s the one I know, plus I find it hilarious.\n\nJet/Are You Gonna Be My Girl\n\nThis brings us to Max’s pick: Are You Gonna By My Girl by Jet, another great song I hadn’t known. Jet are an Australian garage rock band who initially were founded in 2001 in Melbourne around brothers Nic Cester (vocals, rhythm guitar, piano) and Chris Cester (drums, vocals). Jet’s influences include The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Faces, AC/DC and T. Rex – a fine list! Are You Gonna Be My Girl, co-written by Nic Cester and the group’s lead guitarist Cameron Muncey, was included on their highly successful debut album Get Born, which dropped in September 2003. The song also became their best-selling single.\n\nDido/White Flag\n\nThe final pick for 2003 is White Flag, a pop ballad by English singer-songwriter Dido. I’ve always liked her ethereal vocals, which remind me a bit of Sarah McLachlan, as well as the song’s atmosphere. White Flag, co-written by Dido, Rick Nowels and co-producer Rollo Armstrong, was first released in July 2003 as the lead single to Dido’s sophomore album Life For Rent, which appeared in September of the same year. It became Dido’s biggest hit and won Best British Single at the 2004 Brit Awards.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Acclaimed Music; YouTube; Spotify\n\nWhile this supplementary feature to my weekly new music reviews was never designed to run on a regular basis, it’s been more than four months since the last installment. The reason for the long gap certainly is not that I was caught up on new releases in the meantime. Recently, it occurred to me I completely missed the latest albums by Pretenders and Graham Parker, both of which came out in September – certainly a good reason for another Catching Up post!\n\nPretenders – Relentless\n\nThe English-American rock band around songwriter, lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Chrissie Hynde, who I trust doesn’t need much of an introduction, has been around since 1978. The group’s current line-up also features James Walbourne (backing vocals, guitar, bass and various other instruments) with whom Hynde wrote all songs; Carwyn Ellis (guitar, keyboards); and Kris Sonne (drums). Chris Hill and Dave Page provided bass on select tracks.\n\nRelentless, out since September 15, only is the group’s 12th studio album. But Hynde has been busy on other fronts. Since 2014, she has released three solo albums. Prior to that, in 2010, she teamed up for an album with Welsh singer J.P. Jones, Fidelity, billed as J.P., Chrissie and the Fairground Boys.\n\nJust like on Hate for Sale, the previous album by Pretenders I reviewed here, Hynde who turned 72 on September 7 remains a compelling vocalist. Based on my initial impression, the songs are pretty good as well. Here’s Let the Sun Come In, one of my early favorites.\n\nOther tracks I’d like to call out are opener Losing My Sense of Taste, A Love, Domestic Silence and I Think About You Daily. The last song features strings composed and conducted by Jonny Greenwood, lead guitarist and keyboarder of Radiohead.\n\nGraham Parker & The Goldtops – Last Chance to Learn the Twist\n\nEnglish singer-songwriter Graham Parker has been active since the early ’70s and starting with his 1976 debut Howlin’ Wind has released more than 20 albums to date. Best known as Graham Parker & The Rumour, Parker has also put out albums as Graham Parker & The Shot, Graham Parker & The Figgs, Graham Parker & The Goldtops and under his own name only. Parker preceded Elvis Costello and Joe Jackson, two other artists who emerged from the British pub rock scene he’s often compared to.\n\nParker’s latest album, Last Chance to Learn the Twist, appeared on September 8 and is billed to Graham Parker & The Goldtops. It marks his first new studio effort since 2018’s Cloud Symbols, which he also released with The Goldtops. Apart from Parker (guitar, harmonica), core members of the band include Martin Belmont (guitar), Geraint Watkins (keyboards), Simon Edwards (bass, Mini Moog, vocals) and Jim Russell (drums, percussion).\n\nWhile my knowledge of Parker’s music is limited and, as such, I cannot make well informed comparisons to his previous album, my first impression of Last Chance to Learn the Twist is quite positive and certainly wants me to further explore his catalog. Here’s the opener The Music of the Devil.\n\nOther tracks I immediately liked include Sun Valley, It Mattered to Me, Pablo’s Hippos and We Did Nothing.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; AllMusic; YouTube; Spotify\n\nThis post first appeared last week as a contribution on A Sound Day, penned by fellow blogger Dave who hosts a great monthly feature titled Turntable Talk where he invites fellow bloggers to share their thoughts around a topic he suggests.\n\nThis time, Dave asked us to write about a song that we felt should have been a hit but wasn’t. Following is what I submitted. After the post had been published, I found what I feel is a better live version of the song and used it to replace the original clip. This version of the post has also been slightly edited to fit the format of my blog.\n\nTurntable Talk, now in its 16th round, truly is a gift that keeps on giving. I always enjoy participating, so thanks for having me back, Dave!\n\nThis time, thanks to Max from PowerPop blog, our task was to identify a song that we feel should have been a hit but wasn’t. Dave rightly acknowledged that defining what is a hit can be tricky but did not set any guidelines other than suggesting we should only focus on tunes that were released as singles. Of course, this still leaves many options from which to pick.\n\nAs I further reflected on how I would define a hit, I decided it should be a single that entered the top 40 pop/mainstream singles chart. The next question was which country’s chart. Since I live in the U.S., naturally the Billboard Hot 100 came to mind first. Looking at that chart, you can find some incredible examples of songs that failed to become hits, such as AC/DC’s Highway to Hell, the Jimi Hendrix Experience’s Purple Haze and Queen’s Don’t Stop Me Now, stalling on at no. 47, no. 65 and no. 86, respectively.\n\nThen I thought while the U.S. undoubtedly is an important music market, so are Australia, Canada and the UK, to name a few others. Once you consider more markets, finding a song that should have been a hit but wasn’t becomes more complicated.\n\nWhile Highway to Hell missed the top 40 in the U.S., it climbed to no. 4, no. 9, no. 17, no. 24 and no. 30 in the UK, New Zealand, The Netherlands, Australia and Germany, respectively, clearly satisfying my above-mentioned definition of a hit in these countries. Or take Purple Haze, which undoubtedly was a hit in the UK (no. 3), Norway and Austria (no. 7 each), The Netherlands (no. 11) and Germany (no. 17).\n\nThis little exercise finally made me conclude that my real task was to find a single I really dig, which was released in multiple markets but failed to place within the top 40 in any. At first, it looked a bit like a daunting task. Then I suddenly remembered Joe Jackson had a number of singles that didn’t make the top 40 or didn’t chart at all. This includes one of my all-time favorites by the versatile English artist and my pick for this post: Down to London.\n\nWritten, arranged and produced by Jackson, Down to London was included on his 10th studio album Blaze of Glory released in April 1989. It also became one of three singles. Based on Wikipedia and Discogs, Down to London appeared as a single in the UK and various other European countries, Australia, New Zealand, the U.S. and Canada. Incredibly, not only did it fail to make the top 40 in any of these markets, but it didn’t chart at all anywhere except for Australia where it reached a measly no. 126!\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Down to London is an autobiographical tune that was inspired by Jackson’s early music career in London. “The song is from the point of view of a teenager who’s going to the big city for the first time,” Jackson told VH1 during an interview in 1989. “The songs on Blaze of Glory are loosely a journey through time from the perspective of someone who’s getting older as it goes along. The song is the third on the album. To me, it’s when I was about 17.”\n\nHe went on, “It’s an old story that’s retold everyday – people going to the big city to seek excitement, fame or just a job. The ambivalence of the song, I think, is although it’s your first exposure to that big city excitement, at the same time you’re exposed to a certain amount of harshness. You can’t afford to stay in a nice hotel, you’re sleeping on someone’s floor. There’s an element of that, but on the whole, I think the song is pretty positive.”\n\nHere’s a version, included on Jackson’s 2004 live album Afterlife that was recorded during various gigs in California in August 2003.\n\nDown to London may not be quite up there with Joe Jackson classics like Is She Really Going Out with Him?, One More Time, It’s Different For Girls or Steppin’ Out, but it sure as heck is a great song that at least would have deserved to land in the top 40 in the UK and the other markets in which the single appeared.\n\nI’ll leave you with the lyrics.\n\nStop – what’s that sound\n\nIt’s the death rattle of this rusty old town\n\nStop – listen again\n\nIt’s the sound of laughter all along the Thames\n\nHey – what’s my line\n\nDo I have to stay here ’til the end of time\n\nI’m – good looking and bright\n\nI want to see life after ten at night\n\nSo if they ask you where I am\n\nI’m in the back of a transit van\n\nIn a squat on the earls court road\n\nGone down to London turning coal into gold\n\nDown to London – down to London\n\nGone down to London to be the king\n\nHey – what’s your name\n\nThe boys back home all seem to look the same\n\nYou – should stick with me\n\nAnd one of us will make it, just you see\n\nStop – what’s that sound\n\nSeems like the sixties are still swinging around\n\nHey – can you hear me back there\n\nOr is there anybody left to care\n\nSo if you ask me where they are\n\nThey’re hanging tough in a soho bar\n\nPlaying guitars in the underground\n\nGone down to London trying to chase that sound\n\nDown to London – down to London\n\nGone down to London to be the king\n\nSo I ask you should I cry or laugh\n\nDrinking tea in a kings cross caff\n\nA leather jacket against the cold\n\nGone down to London turning coal into gold\n\nDown to London – down to London\n\nGone down to London to be the king\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Discogs; YouTube\n\nHappy Wednesday! I’m back from a one-week hiatus and like to welcome you to a new installment of Song Musings. This weekly feature takes a closer look at tunes I’ve only mentioned in passing or not covered at all to date. My pick for today is Sunday Papers by Joe Jackson.\n\nWritten by Jackson, Sunday Papers first appeared on the versatile English musician’s and singer-songwriter’s debut album Look Sharp!, which came out in January 1979. Combining new wave and ska, the precursor to rocksteady and reggae, the tune also became the album’s and Jackson’s overall second single in February 1979 after Is She Really Going Out With Him?.\n\nJust like the initial release of Is She Really Going Out With Him? in October 1978, Sunday Papers didn’t make the UK Official Singles Charts and also failed to chart in other countries. Unlike Jackson’s first single, Sunday Papers wasn’t reissued, possibly a mistake. When Is She Really Going Out With Him? appeared for the second time in 1979, the single received much more attention, reaching no. 13 in the UK, and climbing to no. 8, no. 9, no. 15 and no. 18 in Ireland, Canada, Australia and the U.S., respectively.\n\n“It started out with this riff, which is really a standard sort of rhythm and blues riff,” Jackson explained in a 2011 mini-documentary about the making of Sunday Papers, posted on YouTube channel Top 2000 a gogo. According to their description, these mini documentaries are part of an annual Dutch television programme, made by NTR for NPO3. [Jackson playing piano] “I was putting it more on the off beats, so it has almost more like a ska reggae feel to it” [continues playing piano]. “And then the bass is going…” [continues playing piano, demonstrating the bass line] Here’s how the great song sounded live in June 2022, captured at The Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles.\n\nI’ve really come to dig Sunday Papers and Jackson’s debut album overall. One important reason is the terrific bass playing by Graham Maby who continues to work with Jackson to this day and can prominently be seen in the above live clip. The other members of Jackson’s original band, Gary Sanford (guitar) and David Houghton (drums), certainly were no slouches either.\n\nLook Sharp! did better in the charts than Sunday Papers, reaching no. 40 in the UK and no. 20 in each the U.S., Canada and Australia. It performed best in New Zealand where it peaked at no. 13. The album has since secured Platinum certification in Canada (80,000 units); Gold certifications the U.S. (500,000 units) and The Netherlands (50,000 units); and Silver certification (60,000 units) in the UK. While the chart performance and sales figures are pretty modest compared to Jackson’s most successful album Night and Day (June 1982), they aren’t too shabby for a debut.\n\nFollowing are some additional insights for Sunday Papers from Songfacts:\n\nOne of the few songs on Joe Jackson’s debut album Look Sharp! that isn’t about interpersonal relationships and matters of love, “Sunday Papers” is a takedown of the Fleet Street press, the UK print media that were prone to cover sensationalistic and frightening news stories to boost readership. Jackson had his battles with the press, who often categorized him in ways that weren’t to his liking (New Wave?). His message here: don’t trust everything you read, and don’t let it affect your lifestyle.\n\nIn 2011, it was revealed that the British newspaper News of the World was involved in phone hacking, and it produced quite a scandal. In 2012, we asked Joe Jackson about this event and if his song was prophetic. His reply: “I think that what applied now applied then. I think that some of the worst people just got busted, that’s all. All that stuff with the News of the World, I think it was business as usual. There are certain publications in the UK that have gone down market, that have gotten trashier. And there are some that are still at least trying to maintain a certain dignity. But yeah, I’m not a big fan of the UK media in general.”\n\nJackson used a reggae beat on this song, which is something The Clash, The Police, and Elvis Costello were also up to. Another Jackson song with a reggae influence is “Fool in Love.”\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Top 2000 a gogo; Songfacts; YouTube\n\nThis post originally appeared on A Sound Day by Dave as part of the most recent round of his great recurring feature Turntable Talk, for which he invites fellow blogger to provide their thoughts on a topic he suggests. In Dave’s words: This month, our topic is First Time’s The Charm. We’ve asked our guests to pick a debut record by an artist that really impressed them…and maybe let us know if they feel the artist kept up the quality and momentum with subsequent works.\n\nFollowing is my submission, which I reformatted to fit the template of my blog. I also added the Spotify link to the album at the end.\n\nThanks, Dave, for fearlessly continuing your fun series Turntable Talk and, of course, for inviting me back to share some additional thoughts.\n\nWhen I saw the topic for this round, I immediately had an idea which debut album that really impressed me I would cover. Then, as oftentimes happens once I start reflecting on stuff, I had second thoughts, so I decided to get inspired by Mr. Google.\n\nOne of the first hits I got was Rolling Stone’s list of the 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time, published on July 1, 2022. While the list includes fine debuts, such as The Beatles’ Please Please Me (1963), The Doors’ The Doors (1967), Pink Floyd’s The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967), The Jimi Hendrix Experience’s Are You Experienced? (1967), Lynyrd Skynyrd’s (Pronounced ‘Lĕh-‘nérd ‘Skin-‘nérd) (1973) and Pretenders’ Pretenders (1979), it excludes gems like Jackson Browne’s Jackson Browne (1972), Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers’ Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers (1976) and Joe Jackson’s Look Sharp! (1979).\n\nOf course, no list can be perfect. When I realized Rolling Stone also didn’t feature the album that had come to my mind first I thought, ‘screw it, I go with my initial pick’ – The eponymous debut album by Dire Straits, released in June 1978!\n\nWhen I first heard Sultans of Swing as a teenager in the late ‘70s, I was immediately hooked on the British group and Mark Knopfler’s cool sound he got out of his Fender Stratocaster. Since German radio would always fade out the song, which drove me nuts, I needed to own that tune myself. So I bought the vinyl album that includes Sultans of Swing, not realizing I could have gotten the single instead. I’m glad I did what I did since I would have missed out on great music otherwise, at least at the time!\n\nSultans of Swing, the album’s best-known tune, is the first song on the B-side. The single was first released in the UK in May 1978. In the U.S., it came out in January 1979. It climbed all the way up to no. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached no. 8 on the U.K. Official Singles Chart. But there’s definitely more to the album than Sultans of Swing.\n\nLet’s start with side A and the great opener Down to the Waterline. Like Sultans of Swing and all other tracks on the album, it was penned by Mark Knopfler. Mark’s brother David Knopfler, the band’s first rhythm guitarist, has said the song was based on Mark’s teenage memories walking along a river at night under the lights with his girlfriend.\n\nAnother tune on side A I’ve always liked is Water of Love, which also became the album’s second single. Knopfler created a cool sound on that song, playing a so-called resonator guitar. Some critics noted the song’s style is reminiscent of J.J. Cale’s blues approach. I think that’s fair. I also don’t have a problem at all that Knopfler was inspired by another great guitarist. In fact, I would argue great musicians getting inspiration from other great musicians happens all the time!\n\nMoving on to side B, I’m skipping the above-mentioned Sultans of Swing and go right to Into the Gallery. Sure, you could say Knopfler’s electric guitar sound is more of the same. I just happen to love it, so I don’t mind getting more of it!\n\nLet’s do one more: Wild West End. Songfacts explains the title refers to an area in London (West End) where Knopfler enjoyed walking around, “always with an eye on the ladies”. Apparently, this particular tune recalls “a particularly attractive young woman in Shaftesbury Avenue.” Interestingly, the official video only shows the band performing the song on a stage and doesn’t include any footage of the West End.\n\nTo me and I guess to most other Dire Straits fans, most of the band’s appeal came from Mark Knopfler and his melodic and sparing way to play the guitar. An important aspect of his technique is the use of his fingers on the strumming hand instead of a pick, which creates a very transparent and distinct sound. Knopfler was a pretty good writer as well, which would become more obvious on the group’s later works, especially Making Movies, their third studio album released in October 1980.\n\nWhile it is fair to say that Mark Knopfler was Dire Straits’ dominant force, a band is never just one guy. So this post wouldn’t be complete without acknowledging the other musicians on the album: Mark’s aforementioned brother David Knopfler (rhythm guitar, vocals), John Illsley (bass, vocals) and Pick Withers (drums).\n\nUndoubtedly, Dire Straits are best remembered for their 1985 studio album Brothers in Arms and the mega hit single Money For Nothing. While I won’t deny it’s a good album, I will always prefer their 1978 debut, along with Making Movies. Thanks to fellow blogger Graham from Aphoristic Album Reviews, I’ve also gained new appreciation for Love Over Gold, the September 1982 predecessor to Brothers in Arms.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfacts; YouTube; Spotify\n\nHappy Sunday and welcome to another trip into the beautiful and diverse world of music, six tracks at a time. Hop on, fasten your seatbelts and let’s go!\n\nMiles Davis/So What\n\nToday, I’d like to start our journey in August 1959 with some early Miles Davis. I have to admit I find this more accessible than Bitches Brew and other of his later more experimental music I’ve heard. I guess I’m not alone. According to Wikipedia, many critics regard Davis’s Kind of Blue album as his masterpiece, the greatest jazz record, and one of the best albums of all time. In 1976, it became his first album to reach Gold certification in the U.S., and as of 2019, it has reached 5X Platinum. More importantly, the album’s influence reached far beyond jazz. None other than the great Duane Allman, guitarist of The Allman Brothers Band, said his soloing on songs like In Memory of Elizabeth Reed, “comes from Miles and Coltrane, and particularly Kind of Blue.” Pink Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright noted the chord progressions on Kind of Blue influenced the structure of the introductory chords to the song Breathe on their 1973 gem The Dark Side of the Moon. Meanwhile, Davis ended up viewing Kind of Blue and his other early work differently. During a 1986 interview, he said, “I have no feel for it anymore—it’s more like warmed-over turkey.” Here’s the album’s opener So What composed by Davis. BTW, Davis (trumpet) was in formidable company on the album, including saxophone greats John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley, pianists Bill Evans and Wynton Kelly, as well as Paul Chambers (double bass) and Jimmy Cobb (drums).\n\nChristine McVie/One in a Million\n\nFor our next stop, we’re jumping 25 years ahead to January 1984. I trust Christine McVie (born Christine Perfect) doesn’t need much of an introduction. It’s safe to assume most folks know her as a long-term member of Fleetwood Mac. She joined the group as keyboarder and vocalist in 1970 after her departure from blues band Chicken Shack and the release of her first solo album Christine Perfect. Following the Mac’s 13th studio album Mirage from June 1982, they went on a temporary hiatus, giving McVie the time to record her second eponymous solo album, Christine McVie. She was backed by Todd Sharp (guitar, backing vocals), George Hawkins (bass, backing vocals) and Steve Ferrone (drums, percussion) who 10 years later would join Tom Petty’s band The Heartbreakers. Mac’s Lindsey Buckingham (guitar) and Mick Fleetwood (drums) had guest appearances on certain tracks, as had Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood. Clearly, McVie didn’t have any challenges to secure high-caliber talent for the album. Here’s One in a Million, co-written by her and Sharp. It’s one of the tunes featuring Winwood who in addition to synthesizer also provided lead and backing vocals. Nice pop-rocker!\n\nThe Moody Blues/Watching and Waiting\n\nThis next pick has been on my list of earmarked Sunday Six songs for several months – not quite sure what took me so long! Watching and Waiting is the beautiful closer of the Moody Blues’s fifth studio album To Our Children’s Children’s Children, released in November 1969. Co-written by band members Justin Hayward (vocals, guitar, sitar) and Ray Thomas (vocals, flute, tambourine, bass flute, oboe), the tune also appeared separately as a single. It didn’t chart, unlike the album, which climbed to no. 2 in the UK, no. 11 in Canada and no. 14 in the U.S. The band’s remaining members at the time were Mike Pinder (Mellotron, piano), John Lodge (bass) and Graeme Edge (drums, percussion). During a 2014 interview Hayward said, “when we heard that song in its studio beauty, we thought, “This is it! All of those people who had been saying to us for the past 3 or 4 years, “You’ll probably just do another Nights in White Satin with it” — no! We had shivers up the spine, and that kind of stuff. But when it came out and you heard it on the radio, you kept saying, “Turn it up! Turn it up!! Oh no, it’s not going to make it.” So it didn’t happen.”\n\nTom Faulkner/River On the Rise\n\nOn to the ’90s and Tom Faulkner, a great American singer-songwriter who isn’t exactly a household name. My former bandmate and longtime music buddy from Germany brought him and his excellent 1997 album Lost In The Land Of Texico on my radar screen last year, and this is the second track from that album I’m featuring on The Sunday Six. To date, Faulkner has only released two albums. His most recent one, Raise the Roof, appeared in 2002. For the most part, he has made his living with commercial music for radio and TV. According to this bio on last.fm, Faulkner has created hundreds of national jingles and scores, including some of the most memorable commercial music on television and radio. Most notably, he composed and sang the wildly popular “I Want My Baby Back” for Chili’s, a jingle that has since found its way into motion pictures (Austin Powers) and over a dozen major network TV shows. He also created the multi-award winning music theme for Motel 6 and Tom Bodett, the longest running commercial campaign in the history of advertising (23 years, 5 CLIOs, and counting). Check out River On the Rise, a nice bluesy tune!\n\nJoe Jackson Band/Take It Like a Man\n\nIt’s time to feature a couple of songs from the current century, don’t you agree? First, let’s go to March 2003 and Volume 4, the 16th studio album by versatile British music artist Joe Jackson, released as Joe Jackson Band. For this project, Jackson (piano, organ, electric piano, melodica, lead vocals) brought back together his original backing band of Gary Sanford (guitar, backing vocals), Graham Maby (bass, backing vocals) and David Houghton (drums, backing vocals). And there’s definitely some of that cool vibe from Jackson’s first three albums Look Sharp! (January 1979), I’m the Man (October 1979) and Beat Crazy (October 1980). Over his now 50-plus-year career, Jackson has touched many different genres ranging from pub rock, new wave, swing, and jazz-oriented pop to even classical music. Here’s the album’s great opener Take It Like a Man, which like all other tunes was penned by Jackson.\n\nCandy Dulfer/Jammin’ Tonight (feat. Nile Rodgers)\n\nAnd once again, it’s time to wrap up. For this final track, we’re traveling back to the present and a funky tune by Dutch jazz and pop saxophonist Candy Dulfer: Jammin’ Tonight featuring Mr. funky guitar Nile Rodgers. Dulfer, the daughter of Dutch tenor saxophonist Hans Dulfer, began playing the drums as a five-year-old before discovering the saxophone a year later. Since the age of seven, she has focused on the tenor saxophone. By the time she was 11, Dulfer made her first recordings for her father’s jazz band De Perikels (the perils). Three years later, she opened up two European concerts for Madonna with her own band Funky Stuff. Two years later, in 1989, she duetted with Dave Stewart (of Eurythmics) on the worldwide instrumental hit Lily Was Here, from the motion picture soundtrack of the same name. The following year, she put out her solo debut album Saxuality. The above tune Jammin’ Tonight is from Dulfer’s forthcoming album We Never Stop, which is scheduled for October 28. Funky!\n\nLast but not least, here’s a Spotify playlist featuring all of the above tunes. Hope there’s something for ya!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; last.fm; YouTube; Spotify\n\nAnother Sunday is upon us, which means the moment has come again for some music time travel. Hop on board, fasten your seat belt and let’s do this!\n\nSantana/Welcome\n\nOur journey today starts in 1973 with jazz fusion by Santana – very different from Evil Ways, Jingo, Soul Sacrifice, Oye Cómo Va, Samba Pa Ti and, of course, Black Magic Woman, which brought Carlos Santana and the classic line-up of his band on my radar screen 40-plus years ago. Welcome is the title track of Santana’s fifth studio album released in November 1973, and the follow-on to Caravanserai, which had marked a major departure from their classic seductive blend of Latin grooves and rock to free-form instrumental jazz fusion. I have to admit it was an acquired taste, and I still need to be in the right mood to listen to this type of music. If you haven’t done so, I encourage you to give this a listen. It’s amazing music!\n\nJoe Jackson/Friend Better\n\nAfter a six-and-a-half minute-trance-inducing instrumental, it’s time to add some vocals and pick something a bit more mainstream. Enter Joe Jackson, a British artist I’ve admired since ca. 1980 when I received his sophomore album I’m the Man as a present for my 14th birthday. Initially called “an angry young man,” Jackson quickly proved to be a versatile artist. Over a 40-year-plus-and-counting recording career, he has gone far beyond his origins of punk-oriented pub rock and embraced multiple other genres like new wave, big band jazz and pop. Friend Better is from Jackson’s most recent 20th studio album Fool, which came out in January 2019. All songs were written, arranged and produced by Jackson. I also got to see him during the supporting tour and thought he was still the man. If you’re so inclined, you can read more about Fool here and the gig here.\n\nThe Church/Reptile\n\nFor our next stop, let’s jump to February 1988 and The Church, and I’m not talking about a house of worship. That’s when Starfish came out, the Australian rock band’s fifth album, which brought them their international breakthrough. Fellow blogger Bruce from Vinyl Connection had a great post about this gem a couple of weeks ago. When back in the day I heard the album’s first single Under the Milky Way, I was immediately hooked by the amazing sound and got Starfish on CD right away. Only mentioning Milky Way gives me some chills. Okay, admittedly, I’m also listening to the bloody tune as I’m writing this! While this song undoubtedly is the best-known track on Starfish, there’s definitely more to the album. Point in case: Reptile, the second single, credited to all four members of the group Steve Kilbey (lead vocals, bass), Peter Koppes (guitars, lead vocals), Marty Willson-Piper (guitars, lead vocals) and Richard Ploog (drums, percussion). Kilbey remains the only original member in the Aussie band’s current incarnation.\n\nThe Temptations/Get Ready\n\nI trust Motown legends The Temptations need no introduction. When it comes to multi-part harmony singing, the Detroit vocal group ruled in my book. If you haven’t heard it, check out their heavenly rendition of Silent Night, and you quickly know what I mean. This brings me to Get Ready, released in February 1966, the group’s third no. 1 single in the U.S. on Billboard’s R&B charts and their second top 10 on the UK Official Singles Chart. Written and produced by Smokey Robinson, the tune also appeared on The Temptations’ fourth studio album Gettin’ Ready, released in June that same year. Motown founder and head Berry Gordy Jr. wasn’t impressed with the song’s performance on the mainstream Billboard Hot 100 (no. 29). Subsequently, he replaced Robinson with Norman Whitfield as the group’s producer. Whitfield would become instrumental in shaping what became known as psychedelic soul in the late ’60s. Among others, he co-wrote and produced the epic Papa Was a Rollin’ Stone.\n\nCounting Crows/Mr. Jones\n\nWe’re starting to get into the final stretch with one of my all-time favorite tunes by Counting Crows and the ’90s for that matter. Like I bet was the case for many other music listeners as well, Mr. Jones brought the rock band from San Franciso on my radar screen when they suddenly burst on the scene in December 1993. Not only marked Mr. Jones the group’s breakthrough, but it also was their very first single. Interestingly, the lead single off their studio debut August and Everything Thereafter, which had come out three months earlier, failed to chart in the U.S. but proved successful elsewhere. Mr. Jones, co-written by Counting Crows guitarist and lead vocalist David Bryson and Adam Duritz, respectively, hit no. 1 in Canada and no. 13 in Australia. In the UK, it reached a respectable no. 28. I wonder whether American audiences felt the tune sounded too much like R.E.M. – not an unfair comparison, though it never bothered me. Last year, Counting Crows hit their 30th anniversary (unreal to me!). Bryson and Duritz remain part of the current line-up.\n\nLittle Richard/Tutti Frutti\n\nAnd once again, this brings us to our final destination for this Sunday. While he called himself Little Richard, there was nothing small about Richard Wayne Penniman. The flamboyant artist was a giant of the classic rock & roll era, one of the most exciting performers who also wrote and co-wrote gems like Tutti Frutti, Slippin’ and Slidin’, Long Tall Sally and Jenny, Jenny. And I’m only talking about tunes from Richard’s debut album Here’s Little Richard released in March 1957. As was common at the time, it essentially was a compilation of Richard’s singles that had appeared earlier. Tutti Frutti, co-written by Penniman and Dorothy LaBostrie, had first been released in October 1955 and become Little Richard’s first U.S. hit, a no. 2 on Billboard’s R&B charts. It also reached the top 20 on the mainstream pop chart (no. 18). Inexplicably, at least from a musical perspective, Penniman never had a no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. His most successful tune there, Long Tall Sally, reached no. 6.\n\nThis wraps up another installment of The Sunday Six, folks, but we’ll embark on a new trip next Sunday. Meanwhile, this post wouldn’t be complete without a Spotify playlist of the above tunes.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\nAnother Wednesday is upon us, which means time to pick another tune to take to that imaginary desert island. I’m up to the letter “J”, and taking a look at my music library reveals artists and bands like Joe Jackson, The Jackson 5, The Jayhawks, Jean-Michel Jarre, Nora Jones and Janis Joplin. Each would be a good choice, except I’ve covered them more often than my pick James Gang.\n\nI only know a handful of James Gang tunes, which made my selection pretty easy: Funk #49. Co-written by band members Joe Walsh (vocals, guitars, percussion, piano, keyboards), Jim Fox (drums, percussion, organ, piano, keyboards) and Dale Peters (bass guitar, percussion, vocals), the song is from the group’s sophomore album James Gang Rides Again, released in July 1970. It also appeared separately as a single that same year.\n\nLike James Gang’s other charting songs, Funk #49 was moderately successful in the U.S., reaching no. 59 on the Billboard Hot 100. It did better in Canada where it climbed to no. 26, marking their highest-charting single there. This doesn’t change the fact that I love this tune!\n\nFollowing are some additional insights from Songfacts:\n\nThe James Gang is best known for their guitarist, Joe Walsh, whose playing on this track helped establish him as a superstar axeman. Walsh joined the Cleveland-based group in 1969 after making a name for himself as one of the top guitar men in Ohio. He replaced Glenn Schwartz in the band, who Walsh considers a mentor. They were a 5-piece when Walsh joined, but were down to three (like popular acts Cream and The Jimi Hendrix Experience) when they released their second album James Gang Rides Again.\n\nWith just three members, it meant Walsh had to play both rhythm and lead guitar parts, and also sing (he got a lot more help when he joined the Eagles in 1975). It was quite a learning experience for Walsh, who left the James Gang in 1971 after recording three studio albums with the group.\n\n…The song is about a girlfriend whose wild ways the singer just can’t tame…There isn’t much in the way of lyrics, as the song is mostly a showcase for Walsh’s guitar work. He explained in the book The Guitar Greats, “I came up with the basic guitar lick, and the words never really impressed me intellectually, but they seemed to fit somehow. It was a real good example of how we put things together, bearing in mind that it was a three piece group, and I don’t think that there was any overdubbing. The only thing we really added was the percussion middle part, which the three of us actually played, putting some parts on top of the drums, but that’s the three piece James Gang, and that’s the energy and kind of the symmetry we were all about.”\n\n…“Funk #49” became a staple of Album Oriented Rock and Classic Rock radio, but it wasn’t the biggest chart hit for the James Gang – that would be “Walk Away,” which made #51 in 1971 and was later reworked for Walsh’s 1976 solo album You Can’t Argue with a Sick Mind. “Funk #49” is one of Joe Walsh’s most popular songs, and by the mid-’70s he admitted that he couldn’t stand playing it any more, but did so because fans loved it.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube\n\nThis Musings of the Past revisits a post about the British television music show The Old Grey Whistle Test. It was originally published in July 2017. In case you haven’t seen any previous installments, Musings of the Past is a recurring feature in which I republish posts that first appeared when the blog got less traffic or content I feel otherwise deserves a second exposure.\n\nA key reason for me to republish this post is what I feel are great clips of artists like Neil Young, David Bowie, Joni Mitchell, John Lennon, Bonnie Raitt and Emmylou Harris. It was fun to revisit this content. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!\n\nThe Venues: The Old Grey Whistle Test\n\nThe British television music show featured an impressive array of artists\n\nThis post and the related new category I’m introducing to the blog was inspired by a dear friend from Germany, who earlier today suggested searching YouTube for “Old Grey Whistle Test,” just for fun! Since he shares my passion for music and always gives me great tips, I checked it out right away and instantly liked the clips that came up. This triggered the idea to start writing about places where rock & roll has been performed throughout the decades.\n\nAt this time, I envisage The Venues to include famous concert halls and TV shows. Many come to mind: The Fillmore, The Beacon Theater, The Apollo, The Hollywood Bowl, Candlestick Park, Winterland Ballroom, The Ed Sullivan Show, Rockpalast – the list goes on and on! Given it was my dear friend who inspired me, it feels right to start with The Old Grey Whistle Test.\n\nI admit that until earlier today, I had never heard about The Old Grey Whistle Test. According to Wikipedia, the British television show aired on the BBC between September 1971 and January 1988. The late night rock show was commissioned by British veteran broadcaster Sir David Attenborough and conceived by BBC TV producer Rowan Ayers.\n\nThe show aimed to emphasize “serious” rock music, less whether it was chart-topping or not – a deliberate contrast to Top of the Pops, another BBC show that was chart-driven, as the name suggests. Based on the YouTube clips I’ve seen, apparently, this was more the case in the show’s early days than in the ’80s when the music seems to have become more commercial. Unlike other TV music shows, the sets on The Old Grey Whistle lacked showbiz glitter – again, probably more true for the ’70s than the ’80s period.\n\nDuring the show’s early years, performing bands oftentimes recorded the instrumental tracks the day before the show aired. The vocals were performed live most of the time. After 1973, the show changed to an all-live format. In 1983, the title was abridged to Whistle Test. The last episode was a live 1987/88 New Year’s Eve special, including a 1977 live performance of Hotel California by The Eagles and Meat Loaf’s Bat Out of Hell.\n\nSo what kind of music did the show feature? Let’s take a look at some of these YouTube clips.\n\nNeil Young/Heart of Gold (1971)\n\nSteppenwolf/Born to Be Wild (1972)\n\nDavid Bowie/Oh, You Pretty Things (1972; not broadcast until 1982)\n\nRory Gallagher/Hands Off (1973)\n\nJoni Mitchell/Big Yellow Taxi (1974)\n\nJohn Lennon/Slippin’ & Slidin’ (1975)\n\nBonnie Raitt/Angel From Montgomery (1976)\n\nEmmylou Harris/C’est La Vie (1977)\n\nTom Petty & The Heartbreakers/American Girl (1978)\n\nJoe Jackson/Sunday Papers (1979)\n\nRamones/Do You Remember Rock ‘n’ Roll Radio?\n\nLos Lobos/Don’t Worry Baby (1984)\n\nSimply Red/Holding Back the Years (1985)\n\nU2/In God’s Country (1987)\n\n– End-\n\nThis post was originally published on July 1, 2017.
