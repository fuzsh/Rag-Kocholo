        "text": "Template:BLP sources Template:EngvarB Template:Use dmy dates Template:Infobox musical artist\n\nDavid Ian \"Joe\" Jackson (born 11 August 1954) is an English musician and singer-songwriter.[1] After years of studying music and playing clubs, Jackson's first release, \"Is She Really Going Out with Him?\" became a hit in 1979. This was followed by a number of new wave singles before he moved to more jazz-inflected pop music and had a Top 10 hit in 1982 with \"Steppin' Out\". He has also composed classical music. He has recorded 19 studio albums and garnered 5 Grammy Award nominations throughout the course of his career.[2]\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly years[]\n\nBorn in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, David Jackson spent his first year in nearby Swadlincote, Derbyshire. He grew up in the Paulsgrove area of Portsmouth, where he attended the Portsmouth Technical High School. Jackson's parents moved to nearby Gosport when he was a teenager. Jackson learned to play the violin but soon switched to piano and prevailed on his father to install one in the hall of their Paulsgrove council house. Jackson began playing piano in bars at the age of 16, and he also won a scholarship to study musical composition at London's Royal Academy of Music.\n\nJackson's first band, formed in Gosport, was called Edward Bear,[note 1] later renamed Edwin Bear and then Arms and Legs, but the band broke up in 1976 after two unsuccessful singles. He was still known as David Jackson while in Arms and Legs, but around this time he picked up the nickname \"Joe\", based on his perceived resemblance to the puppet character Joe Piano, who was Snoopy in Joe Cool guise playing piano.[3] Jackson then spent some time performing on the cabaret circuit to make money to record a demo.\n\nJoe Jackson Band[]\n\nIn 1978, a record producer heard Jackson's demo tape and signed him to A&M Records. The next year the newly formed Joe Jackson Band released their debut album, Look Sharp!, its mix of energetic New Wave rock and bitter British punk similar to his contemporaries Elvis Costello and Graham Parker. The album enjoyed wide critical success: in 2013 Rolling Stone magazine named Look Sharp! number 98 in a list of the 100 best debut albums of all time. Some commercial success also followed, as the debut single \"Is She Really Going Out with Him?\" reached the top 40 in 5 countries, and no. 9 in Canada.\n\nThe Joe Jackson Band released I'm the Man in 1979. The album followed a similar musical pattern, and received good, though not as strong, reviews. It did produce the single \"It's Different for Girls\", which became Jackson's highest charting UK single, peaking at no. 5.[4] Beat Crazy followed in 1980. Jackson also collaborated with Lincoln Thompson in reggae crossover.Template:Citation needed\n\nIn 1981, Jackson produced an album for the British power pop group The Keys. The Keys Album was the group's only LP.[5] The Joe Jackson Band toured extensively until it broke up. Jackson subsequently recorded an album of old-style swing and blues tunes, Jumpin' Jive, with songs by Cab Calloway, Lester Young, Glenn Miller, and Louis Jordan. The album, and associated single release, was credited to the band Joe Jackson's Jumpin' Jive.[2]\n\nJackson's 1982 album Night and Day was his only studio album to reach either the UK or US Top 10, peaking at No. 3 (UK)[4] and at No. 4 (US).[6] Two singles released from the album, \"Steppin' Out\" and \"Breaking Us in Two\", were US top 20 hits.[7] The tracks \"Real Men\" and \"A Slow Song\" referred obliquely to New York City's early 1980s gay culture.[8] \"Real Men\" also became a top 10 hit in Australia.[9]\n\nBy 1984, New York had become Jackson's home base, and he recorded Body and Soul there; an album he later said was \"from the point of view of a relative newcomer\".[10] Heavily influenced by pop and jazz standards and salsa, it had the US No. 15 hit single \"You Can't Get What You Want (Till You Know What You Want)\".[7]\n\nIn 1985 Jackson played piano on Joan Armatrading's album Secret Secrets, and in 1986 he collaborated with Suzanne Vega on the single \"Left of Center\" from Pretty in Pink's soundtrack. Jackson's next album was Big World, with all-new songs recorded live in front of an audience instructed to remain silent while music was playing. Released in 1986, it was a three-sided double record; the fourth side consisted of a single centering groove and a label stating \"there is no music on this side\". The instrumental album Will Power (1987), with heavy classical and jazz influences, set the stage for things to come later, but before he left pop behind, he put out two more albums, Blaze of Glory (which he performed in its entirety during the subsequent tour) and Laughter & Lust. In 1995, Jackson contributed his version of \"Statue of Liberty\" on a tribute album for the English band XTC called A Testimonial Dinner: The Songs of XTC.\n\nPost pop[]\n\nIn the late 1990s Jackson expanded into classical music; he signed with Sony Classical in 1997 and released Symphony No. 1 in 1999, for which he received a Grammy for Best Pop Instrumental Album in 2001.[11]\n\nIn 2003, he reunited his original quartet[2] for the album Volume 4, and a lengthy tour. In 2004, he contributed a cover of Pulp's \"Common People\" with William Shatner for Shatner's album Has Been. In 2005 he teamed up with Todd Rundgren and the string quartet ETHEL for a tour of the US & Europe. A dedicated smoker, he gave up his New York apartment in 2006 partly in protest over the ascendancy of smoking bans, and made the Berlin neighbourhood Kreuzberg his new home. It was there that he recorded, with longtime collaborators Graham Maby and Dave Houghton, his eighteenth studio album, Rain (Rykodisc, January 2008); the album was followed by a five-month tour.[12]\n\nIn 2015, Jackson announced the completion on his follow-up to 2012's The Duke via his official website. The album's title, Fast Forward, and track list were confirmed in addition to North American tour dates. The titular first single was released for streaming via his official Soundcloud page. The entire record was briefly posted before being taken down a day later.[13]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nJackson was married to his wife, Ruth, for two years, but the marriage ended in divorce and was later called a \"disaster\" by Jackson.[14]\n\nOther activities[]\n\nJackson has actively campaigned against smoking bans in both the United States and the United Kingdom, publishing a 2005 pamphlet (The Smoking Issue)[15] and a 2007 essay (Smoke, Lies and the Nanny State),[16] and recording a satirical song (\"In 20-0-3\") on the subject.[17]\n\nJackson wrote an autobiography called A Cure For Gravity, published in 1999, which he described as a \"book about music, thinly disguised as a memoir\". It traces his working-class upbringing in Portsmouth and charts his musical life from childhood until his twenty-fourth birthday. Life as a pop star, he insisted, was hardly worth writing about.[18]\n\nDiscography[]\n\nStudio albums[]\n\nYear Title Chart positions UK\n\n[4] AUS\n\n[9] GER\n\n[19] NL\n\n[20] NZ\n\n[21] US\n\n[6][22] 1979 Look Sharp! 40 20 — 36 13 20 I'm the Man 12 81 — 45 47 22 1980 Beat Crazy 42 82 — 32 47 41 1981 Joe Jackson's Jumpin' Jive 14 29 — — 12 42 1982 Night and Day 3 5 11 3 8 4 1983 Mike's Murder (soundtrack) — 91 — 10 28 64 1984 Body and Soul 14 21 21 2 8 20 1986 Big World 41 22 24 2 27 34 1987 Will Power — 67 58 25 — 131 1988 Tucker (soundtrack) — — — 99 — — 1989 Blaze of Glory 36 31 27 12 — 61 1991 Laughter & Lust 41 57 20 22 — 116 1994 Night Music — — — — — — 1997 Heaven & Hell — — — — — — 1999 Symphony No. 1 — — — — — — 2000 Night and Day II — — — 65 — — 2003 Volume 4 — — 49 27 — — 2008 Rain — — 44 12 — 133 2012 The Duke — — 33 21 — 93 2015 Fast Forward — — 54 11 — — \"—\" denotes a title that did not chart, or was not released in that territory.\n\nLive albums[]\n\nBig World (1986) - a studio album recorded before a live audience, asked to remain quiet so no applause or chat-ups.\n\nLive 1980/86 (1988 A&M Records) - with live recordings from the Beat Crazy, the Night & Day, the Body & Soul and the Big World tours.
