        "text": "Musician-producer Joe Jackson, whose works include New Wave, classical and jazz-inflected pop music, will perform on May 26. at the Riffe Center Davidson Theatre, 77 S. High St.\n\nTickets start at $40 and can be purchased starting at 10 a.m. Friday at the CBUSArts Ticket Center at the Ohio Theatre, 39 E. State St., online at capa.com or CBUSArts.com, and by phone at 1-614-469-0939.\n\nAs part of his Two Rounds Of Racket Tour, Jackson will present a two-part show beginning with a solo set of numbers from his own catalog, which includes the songs \"Is She Really Going Out With Him?\" and \"Steppin' Out.\"\n\nThink P!nk: Record-setting pop star Pink will return to the Schottenstein Center on Oct. 9\n\nThe second half will feature Jackson with a nine-piece band performing songs from his new album, \"What A Racket: The Music of Max Champion,\" a collection of works written by long-forgotten English Music Hall performer Max Champion. Jacksonâ€™s new album and tour mark the first performances in more than 100 years of Champion's music.\n\nChampion's music career was cut short by World War I and his songs faded into obscurity until 2014, when his sheet music started to surface, first in Malta, then in England and Belgium. By 2019, enough songs had been recovered for Jackson to resurrect them."
