        "text": "''Believe it or not, I'm still getting reviews where people call me the angry young man of British New Wave,'' Joe Jackson remarked recently. ''People latch on to one image so they don't have to think, and that kind of laziness has come to characterize the whole music scene these days.''\n\nSuch outspoken sarcasm is typical of Joe Jackson, the 28-year-old singer, song writer and keyboardist from Portsmouth, England, who will be performing tonight at the Byrne Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford, N.J. In the late 70's, Mr. Jackson was lumped together with Elvis Costello and Graham Parker as a characteristically ''angry'' British rocker. But ''Night and Day'' (A&M SP-4906), Mr. Jackson's fifth album and his first major commercial success, is only very distantly related to the lean post-punk rock of his first two albums, ''Look Sharp!'' and ''I'm the Man.''\n\nRecorded in New York City, his adopted home base when he's not on tour, ''Night and Day'' features as its dominant musical idiom an elegant fusion of pop and salsa. Other styles the album embraces include Steely Dan-influenced pop-jazz, string chamber music, Phil Spector, drum-machine dance-rock, and Middle Eastern and Oriental modes. And with its Art Deco cover illustration and a title that harks back to Cole Porter, ''Night and Day'' also means to make connections between different eras.\n\n''I'm not a nostalgist,'' Mr. Jackson emphasized. ''Since I wasn't born until 1954, how could I be nostalgic for a time I never lived in? The music I make is for the moment - for 1982.''\n\nIndeed ''Night and Day'' captures the flavor and tempo of contemporary Manhattan very evocatively. The hybrid Latin rhythms echo New York's vivid multi-ethnic swirl, while Mr. Jackson's blunt, catchy tunes pay homage to the city's longstanding pop traditions. At the same time, Mr. Jackson's surly, acidic singing - his principal link to English post-punk -is emblematic of the economically embattled bohemian cultures of both New York and London.\n\n''Night and Day'' isn't Mr. Jackson's first dive into pop eclecticism, only his most successful. After two early rock albums, he made the spare rock-reggae record, ''Beat Crazy'' and last year followed it up with ''Jumpin' Jive,'' a tribute to the 1940's swing of Louis Jordan and Cab Calloway.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
