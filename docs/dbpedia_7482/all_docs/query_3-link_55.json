        "text": "A short time ago I wrote a post about the early 1970s hit “Kung Fu Fighting” by Carl Douglas. In that post (which you can read here) I talked about how the arrival of martial artist/actor Bruce Lee in California in the mid-1960s seemed to set off a chain reaction of events that led to the Kung Fu movie craze, a television show called Kung Fu, a hit song that predated the launch of Disco music and, finally the incorporation of Kung Fu-like moves into the repertoire of the emerging dance form known as breaking, which then evolved into one of the foundational elements of Hip Hop. From Bruce Lee landing in California all the way to Afrika Bambaataa organizing the various local music groups and factions under the unifying umbrella of Hip Hop in The Bronx in the 1970s, it all seemed like a series of events that naturally evolved, one from the other, until the full timeline of the connections was complete. But did this all just organically happen? Was Bruce Lee so absorbed in his own pursuits in Hollywood that he had no knowledge or input into the sudden surge in Kung Fu studios that opened across the country? Was he contacted by the television executives for input into the new show they were creating that eventually starred David Carradine and highlighted the philosophies that were the backbone of Kung Fu? We did find out that singer Carl Douglas recorded his big hit song completely at random, but why did his producer have such a song at the ready? Sometimes things just happen of their own accord and that is fine. However, sometimes things are more highly orchestrated than they might first appear. I thought about that as I wrote the “Kung Fu Fighting” post because as I was typing the words for that story, I was also hearing the lyrics to another song in my head. That song was “I’m the Man” by Joe Jackson.\n\n“I’m the Man” by Joe Jackson was a song that, surprisingly enough, only ever charted well in Canada. Luckily enough for me, I am Canadian, so I heard this song while I was living in Toronto when it was first released in the early 1980s. Joe Jackson has ended up being one of my favourite artists. I fell in love with his early New Wave roster of songs, such as “Is She Really Going Out With Him?”, “Would You Be My Number Two?”, “Steppin’ Out”, “Real Men”, “Beat Crazy”, “Fools in Love”, “It’s Different For Girls” and many more. Jackson was born in England and is a pianist by trade, but he actually plays multiple instruments which allow him to create songs from a variety of perspectives. In any case, his song “I’m the Man” is one that casts a cynical eye at the whole notion of fads in society. He has always been a bit of a contrarian in his own career, constantly adopting new personae in the same way that David Bowie did throughout his career. Jackson burst on the scene when New Wave was at the height of its popularity, but as soon as he started being referred to as a New Wave artist in the press, Jackson immediately switched gears and went into Jazz and Swing music. Jackson has also released albums of classical music and is now touring North America in support of an album of turn of the century English music hall tunes based upon a fictional character that he created called Max Champion. (A post about the real life music hall star Harry Champion, upon which Joe Jackson’s “Max Champion” character is based can be read here). Jackson’s refusal to be pre-packaged for commercial consumption led him to write “I’m the Man”. This is a song filled with lyrics about how many popular fads or crazes that sweep the nations of the world are actually concocted in advertising boardrooms and that we, as consumers, are gullible and open to being manipulated on a seemingly endless basis and need to be more aware of when we are being conned. “I’m the Man” specifically mentions Kung Fu as one of the fads that was created by marketing types. He also talks about skateboards, hula hoops and the fact that a classic movie such as Jaws morphed into an amusement park ride in Florida.\n\nTo further his point, the music video for “I’m the Man” showcases Jackson in the guise of a spiv. For those who may not be aware, a “spiv” is a British term that refers to a well dressed, slick haired con man. The term originated during WWII when England had passed a law that mandated the rationing of essential goods. A spiv would be a slickly dressed man who would magically appear in neighbourhoods or town squares with suitcases filled with forbidden items that could be had for a price. In times of deprivation, many people actually admired these spiv characters as being someone who they believed had their best interest at heart because they produced items of desire or need at a time when that desire or need was at its apex. In reality, a spiv was nothing more than a profiteer or a thief who quickly and easily separated the weak and the gullible from their hard-earned money. There exists a whole subgenre of British cinema that features spiv-like characters in starring roles. In music, the most popular example of a spiv character might be the one played by Ray Davies of The Kinks in the series of songs that came from their hit double album in the 1980s called “Come Dancing”. Whatever your reference point, Joe Jackson definitely channeled his best “spiv” energy with the song lyrics and the music video for “I’m the Man”.\n\nOne of the reasons that “I’m the Man” was spinning through my mind as I wrote the “Kung Fu Fighting” post was that, for the most part, I believe what Joe Jackson says in his song to be true more often than not. I know from firsthand experience that many of the trending entertainment industry stories are being driven not by public demand but, instead, by salespeople and marketing teams behind the scenes. I know this because for a very short while I was part of that world. I have told this story before, but one of my very first jobs after graduating from university was as Assistant Marketing Manager of London, Ontario radio station CKSL. Don’t let the flashy job title fool you. Essentially, it was a minimum wage job that had two main requirements. First of all, I was responsible for distributing the paper copies of CKSL’s Top 40 list to record stores and entertainment venues that hosted live music. Secondly, I was the person who operated the promotional booths at live events. You would think that a Top 40 list would be driven by consumer demand, but the exact opposite appeared to be true. The list was compiled in ways that created consumer demand. Specifically, the Top 40 list was used to promote artists who were making appearances in the area. My first taste of this was when singer Corey Hart went to No.1 on the CKSL Top 40 list with his, in my opinion, cringe-worthy cover of the Elvis song “Can’t Help Falling in Love”. Hart went to No.1 because he was to be the headlining act at London’s annual Western Fair. Corey Hart rising to No.1 on our chart meant that there was an increased demand for tickets to his concert. Then, when the concert date actually arrived, I was the person tasked with hawking his merch to pre-pubescent girls who came to the concert because of how his looks were being marketed to the teenage demographic. There was nothing secret about how it all worked. Meetings were held months and weeks in advance regarding Corey Hart’s appearance in London. His concert was a very big deal in that city at the time, and I, in my role as minimum wage minion, was in the middle of it all by helping to operate the hype machine. I guess that I was very naïve in those days because the whole experience left an incredibly sour taste in my mouth which, in turn, fuelled my decision to not pursue a career in broadcasting but, instead, opt for being a teacher. The same must have been true for Corey Hart because, not long after that, he dropped out of the Canadian music limelight as well. Being a teen idol was not who he really was. The whole experience was exhausting to the point that eventually he physically collapsed while on tour. That was the wakeup call Hart needed to reevaluate his career and what he wanted out of it as a person and an artist. Not everything of value in this world has to revolve around commerce and the accumulation of monetary wealth. (I wrote a previous post about Corey Hart that you can read here).\n\nAdmittedly, I remain somewhat naïve in my outlook on life. I still believe that there is goodness in the world and that sometimes people achieve miraculous success in a truly organic way. I cling to the hope that success stories based on personal merit still exist and that there are leaders out there who sincerely wish to create the conditions for regular folks to experience the best that life has to offer, not because they can make a buck or two from it but because it is the right thing to do. Period. End of story. But part of my growth as a person is that I, like Joe Jackson, have grown better able to spot the spivs of our world as I mature. I know now that not everyone in the world cares about helping others to discover their own path in life. Instead, our world is filled with too many people who have dollar signs in their eyes. As our towns and cities are increasingly filled with subdivision communities in which there is no space to actually enjoy life, and we are increasingly drawn into experiencing the world through the artificial lens of technology, it is becoming easier for the spivs of today…the con men dressed in slick outfits concocted by advisers in a boardroom…to appear as saviours of the people. Don’t be fooled! Always ask yourself why these spivs appear so willing to be your friend. What’s in it for them? What’s the real con? I will end this post by telling you that just one day ago, I saw news articles about Donald Trump selling bibles in order to raise money to defray his legal expenses that are accruing from the numerous lawsuits he is involved in and losing. Apparently, many MAGA supporters are sending him the money that he has requested. A spiv is a spiv is a spiv. And fools are easily separated from their money. It is a saga as old as time. Sometimes it is important to put on those cynical pants and wade out into the world. “I’m the Man” by Joe Jackson does just that when it comes to Kung Fu and other fads of the 1970s. Perhaps Kung Fu was something that the people sincerely were interested in. More likely, it was a trend that was served to them on a silver platter, which they eagerly lapped up. Geez! Now I have the Miley Cyris song “Jaded” in my head. Time to stop. Thanks for reading my words, as always.\n\nThe link to the song “I’m the Man” by Joe Jackson can be found here. ***The lyrics version is here. *This is an audio only video but the full lyrics are written in the video description found immediately below the actual video..\n\nThe link to a “reaction” video by one of my favs Jamel aka Jamal can be found here. ***I really enjoyed watching him enjoy this song so much. As well, Jamal spoke of the musicianship evident in the whole band, especially bass player Graham Maby. It served to remind me that Joe Jackson is a singer and a musician but also often part of a band, as he was for “I’m the Man”. What a great tune, politics aside!\n\nThe link to the official website for Joe Jackson can be found here.\n\n***As always, all original content contained within this post remains the sole property of the author.
