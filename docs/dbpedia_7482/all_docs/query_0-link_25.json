        "text": "The Historic Ryman Auditorium in Nashville was half full Monday night for the Joe Jackson & Todd Rundgren concert. Each performed solo sets after an opener by a string quartet, followed by a finale featuring all.\n\n'Stepping Out' to board the tour bus post-show Jackson came near 'Breaking Himself in Two' tripping on the bus steps and falling forward while focused on dodging the crowd. He could use some lessons in chilling out from the always personable Rundgren, who was generous in spending time with the apx. 20 who hung around the bus.\n\nHope Joe wasn't hurt too bad.\n\nPlaying a Yamaha Grand Piano, Jackson entertained the crowd with old and new material:\n\nHome Town (from BIG WORLD)/ Stepping Out (from NIGHT & DAY)/ Awkward Age/ Take it All Away/ It's Different For Girls (from I'M THE MAN)/ Obvious Song (from LAUGHTER & LUST)/ Love at First Light/ Girl (Beatles cover)/ Be My Number Two (beautiful tune from BODY & SOUL)/ Citizen Sane/ Is She Really Going Out With Him? (an audience favorite & partial sing-along).\n\nNext was Rudgren's turn, with him alternating between guitar (acoustic and plugged in but at a low volume) and piano. His segment included:\n\nLove of the Common Man/ I Saw the Light/ Nobody Leaves Here Alive/ Vikiing Song/ Hello It's Me/ Have Pity on Me/ Bang the Drum all Day/ Even in My Afterlife/ You've Got to Hide Your Love Away (more Beatles)/ Won't Go to War No More.\n\nEthel, the string quartet whose opening set had been ragged and out of tune, were in better form when they returned for the finale, performing \"Real Men\" with Jackson and \"Can't Help Myself\" with Rundgren.\n\nThe encore numbers were \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" (more Beatles) and \"Black Maria,\" a Todd composition.\n\nSince we gained an hour traveling into central time, we got to the theater in time to greet the musicians as they arrived and were the only two to do so.\n\nGot albums signed by Joe (although not easy to do) and Todd, but only photo opps with Todd, as Joe said he didn't like cameras.\n\nMany of the people I talked to said they'd like to hear both with their bands, particularly Jackson with the tight group he had in the NIGHT & DAY era. This was my first time to hear Jackson live and second for Rundgren. Ethel was featured on Joe's NIGHT AND DAY TWO (II) album a few years ago.\n\nJB\n\njfiedler17 said:\n\nSounds quite awesome! I love both those guys, but Joe's set sounds especially cool! That's so awesome that he played \"Be My Number Two\"! (I play that one on the piano all the time!) Unbelievably gorgeous song; one of the greatest things he's ever written.\n\nJeff F.\n\nI read another review of this concert, and it was about the same--the encore, with \"Weeps\", was especially moving. Could have just been an off-night for Ethel.\n\nMuch as I like Jackson, I'd have preferred to hear him with a band. I missed out on the JJ Quartet reunion tour two years ago, and Volume 4 is a helluva good recording with his original band. Too bad they won't be touring any time soon.\n\nSteven J. Gross said:\n\nTodd is right up there with Herb Alpert as my favorite artist. I've seen him a dozen times at least.\n\nI don't have too much of Todd's stuff - only \"Something/Anything?\" and \"A Wizard/A True Star\" (I absolutely love \"Just One Victory\") - but I really should get some more, 'cause I think he's an incredible artist. Any recommendations on what I should get next?\n\nRudy said:\n\nMuch as I like Jackson, I'd have preferred to hear him with a band.

I've seen Joe perform solo, but, as impressive as it sounded, it still wasn't as \"wow\" inducing as when I've seen him with a band behind him. He surrounds himself with some incredible musicians. Graham Maby, for one, has definitely got to be one of my favorite bassists. One of the most mind-blowing performances I've ever seen on TV was Joe playing a sped-up \"Steppin' Out\" with Maby beside him, frantically replicating the synth part on his bass. It was just stunning to watch!\n\nJeff F.\n\nI don't have too much of Todd's stuff - only \"Something/Anything?\" and \"A Wizard/A True Star\" (I absolutely love \"Just One Victory\") - but I really should get some more, 'cause I think he's an incredible artist. Any recommendations on what I should get next?\n\nI'm a Rundgren fan too, but his albums tend to be really uneven. Unless you're really into the more experimental stuff, I recommend the Rhino two-CD best-of (ANTHOLOGY).\n\nI have three favorites out of his studio albums (besides the incredible SOMETHING/ANYTHING?):\n\n- HEALING (the title track is really a moving piece of work, and the tune \"Time Heals\" is a real get-in-your-head tune);\n\n- HERMIT OF MINK HOLLOW (which contains one of my favorite of all his rockers, \"Bread,\" along with the hit \"Can We Still Be Friends\") and\n\n- NEARLY HUMAN, which has the distinction of being all recorded live-in-studio. The vocal harmonies on this are incredible, especially on the song \"The Waiting Game.\" I believe this one is out of print.\n\nHe also has an excellent Live album called BACK TO THE BARS that's really worth seeking out.\n\nThere's also the Utopia albums to consider, but they're even more \"out there\" than the Rundgren albums. My favorite is OOPS! WRONG PLANET which contains the hit \"Love is the Answer.\""
