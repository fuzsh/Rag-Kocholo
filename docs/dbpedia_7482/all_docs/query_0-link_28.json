        "text": "Okay, other than whipping his kids for fuckin up on dance moves when they were young, I think people are only bitter towards Joe because of Michael's feelings towards him. Ive never really heard any of the other brothers or sisters expressing those same feelings towards. We how sensitive and soft MJ was, and we know that he pushed away everybody who told him what he need to hear to help me.\n\nAt the red carpet for the BET Awards, the media wanna act like he was shamelessly promoting his new label and artists, when he was just answering a question a reporter asked him about what hes been up to.\n\nIt sounds to me that Joe wanted what was best for Michael. I think Joe said that last time he spoke to Michael was shortly before he died, Michael negotiating some kind of a deal with some industry people and Joe showed up just to make sure MJ wasnt being taken advantage of - and now recently Latoya has come out sayin that she feels Michael was forced into do those 50 concerts.\n\nWhy does everybody hate Joe?\n\n[Edited 9/2/09 8:30am]\n\njapanrocks\n\nIn one altercation—later recalled by Marlon Jackson—Joseph held Michael upside down by one leg and \"pummeled him over and over again with his hand, hitting him on his back and buttocks.\"[5] It was alleged that Joseph would also trip up or push his male children into walls. One such claim was that one night while Michael was asleep, Joseph climbed into his room through the bedroom window. Wearing a fright mask, he entered the room screaming and shouting. Joseph said he wanted to teach his children not to leave the window open when they went to sleep.

A lot of people only feel that way towards Joe because of the things Michael said, but who are we to say how Joe should raise HIS children? .. Joe was a hard worker and refused to let his kids fail in life. Like I've been saying, look at where Joe got his kids ..

I dont really care for the \"a lot of people do it so its ok\" argument. that argument is just weak not just in this case but in every case IMO.\n\nI think the worst thing Joe (maybe Kate too) did was giving those kids the responsibility of financially sustaining a family at that age. And yes we might never have had J5 or MJ or Janet but I'd still say it's a cruel thing to do to a child..\n\noh well who the fuck am i to judge\n\n[Edited 9/2/09 10:04am]\n\nTimmy84\n\nmidiscover said:\n\nWell, we really don't know because we didn't grow up with the Jackson family\n\nbut I personally don't think he's as bad as people make him seem\n\nHe seems to really care about his family though he's hard on them but most fathers from his era are like that.\n\nI've heard people will often complain that their father rarely showed them love though they admit that their father did take care of the house. There were some fathers who acted recklessly. Guess Joe's a mixed bag because he DID take care of his kids, they have said that Joe helped them to get where they got to. But he also seemed to have other problems that caused him and his children to be estranged at points. It's a mixed bag especially with a person who grew up the way Joe did. His father rarely showed him any love either from what I heard.\n\nBree8016\n\nMy main problem is Joe's behavior after Michael's death. He seemed to want to turn the situation around and make a profit. (i.e., promoting his new label at BET awards and suggesting MJ's kids go on tour)\n\nJoe beating/whooping his kids isn't a huge deal to me beacuse it's common. I think the damage he did to his family was mainly mental and emotional. I've never met Joe but he seems to be lacking a heart sometimes. He doesn't express love for his family like he acknowledges their talent.\n\nHow can I stand 2 stay where I am? / Poor butterfly who don't understand.\n\nTimmy84\n\nBree8016 said:\n\nMy main problem is Joe's behavior after Michael's death.

He doesn't express love for his family like he acknowledges their talent.\n\nThat's my problem with Joe, according to some of his kids, they think Joe was cold to them and that he was a mental abuser. I think Marvin said the same thing about his dad, that he was a mental abuser. Like it's been said physical discipline was nothing new back then, but when you add on how they were mentally, then it just makes the disciplines worse. I think Joe's kids just wanted their father to open his love to them sometimes. I mean there were some times that Joe did show some appreciation but I guess it was not what they wished it was. Like I said, it's a 50/50 thing.\n\nStillDirrty\n\nYes. There is a reason why most of the Jacksons are crazy and I think that Joe is the root of it. Let's not forget this MESS of an interview with BBC.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/pres...script.pdf\n\n& just because it's the norm for many black parents to be extremely rough with their children doesn't mean that it's not wrong or that it's not child abuse. That is one of the many things that the black community needs to reform imo but that's a whole other topic.\n\nwhatsgoingon\n\nI think it was Latoya that goes on about the beatings and physical abuse more so than Michael did. I think with MJ it was more to do with the emotional side, I mean Katherine gave hims beatings too and he obviously loved her to death. I don't think MJ made a big deal about the beatings, he mentioned it but that wasn't his biggest resentment against Joe. If you read his biography his hang up was more to do with NOT having a father and son relationship, to such an extent he became very close to Berry Gordy, who gave him the affection that his father couldn't give him. He wanted a proper father, not a father that treated him like a cash cow and emotionally abused him.\n\nVinnyM27\n\ntricky2 said:\n\nI like Joe Jackson!!\n\nI just looked up Joe the other day. I really want a collection of his hits. \"Steppin' Out\" is such a great song.\n\nAs for Joe, I imagine since it wasn't just one of his kids saying bad things about him and the fact that he is ready to bounce in on capitalizing on his son's death, he isn't the best guy on the planet. And I could be wrong, but I think those that say only nice things about Joe and constantly defend him are often taken in with his charisma. I think he did quite a number on his family even if he was well meaning.\n\nTimmy84\n\nwhatsgoingon said:\n\nI think it was Latoya that goes on about the beatings and physical abuse more so than Michael did.

He didn't mind the beatings.\n\nSuperstition\n\nYes and no.\n\nHe's a product of his time. I'm not saying its right, but anyone ever wonder how Joe was raised himself? He's old school.\n\nI'm not dismissing what he did, but as someone (can't remember if it was Rev. Run or D.M.C. said), he was just a father trying to get his family out of the poor house.\n\nAll I know is that his family forgave him, so why the hell should anyone else have any say in the matter?\n\nTimmy84\n\nBut the Jackson boys and some other folks (like Bobby Taylor) should also be credited for that. Joe for years couldn't find the person to take them away from Gary. He tried with James, failed, tried with Sam & Dave, failed. Bobby Taylor was the only guy BALLSY enough to say \"you guys need to get a deal with Motown\" and drove them to Detroit to convince Berry that the Jacksons could be viable to Motown when Berry wouldn't allow child acts into the label after Stevie Wonder, who turned 18 the year the Jacksons auditioned and signed with Motown. Berry Gordy, Suzanne de Passe and other Motown staff found ways to make sure the Jackson 5 never had to return to Motown. So it wasn't as if Joe single-handly drove his family out of the Gary ghettos. Katherine needs some credit as for the Jackson brothers themselves when each of them discovered they had the talent that put the motivation in Joe and Katherine.\n\nlowkey\n\njoe jackson seems to be a cold hearted man. i dont have a problem with him whuppin his kids asses when they did something wrong but beatin kids ass because they missed a dance step or they might not feel like singing today is abuse.i agree that the media can sometimes overdo it and he seems to have been demonized by people like nancy grace, but joe need to be more aware of the things he say in public.the bet award thing was trifling imo, your child just died and here you are chillin at an awards show looking like a 80 year old pimp, and he had his boys with him.im sorry but seeing joe sittin there smiling and having a good time rubbed me the wrong way.i mean we talking 3 days after his son unexpectedly died, joe brings alot of the perception people have of him on himself."
