        "text": "Singer-songwriter Joe Jackson will perform at Hershey Theatre on Wednesday, May 29, 2024, at 8 p.m. as part of his upcoming “The Two Rounds Of Racket Tour.”\n\nTickets are available online at www.HersheyEntertainment.com and www.Ticketmaster.com.\n\nRenowned musician and producer Joe Jackson announces “The Two Rounds Of Racket Tour,” appearing in cities across the U.S. in summer 2024, including a stop in Hershey, Pa. This tour follows his newly released album “Mr. Joe Jackson presents: Max Champion in ‘What a Racket!’” reviving the songs of enigmatic early 20th-century English Music Hall artist Max Champion.\n\nEach show will be performed in two parts: a solo set by Joe Jackson of his original songs, and a set based on the album “What A Racket!” – the first performance in more than 100 years of the songs of forgotten Music Hall genius Max Champion, with Joe and a nine-piece band."
