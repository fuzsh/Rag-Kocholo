These concerns were reinforced by Iraqi warnings and by Baghdad's long association with international terrorist movements. However, the Iraqis proved unable to make effective use of terrorism to support their war effort. This failure resulted from many factors, including effective counterterrorist measures by the allies. These included major deportations of Iraqi diplomatic staff throughout the world and the freezing of Baghdad's assets in Western banks as part of the U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq. In addition, several other countries with terrorist linkages pressured their own terrorist clients to refrain from helping Saddam Hussein. They did this for reasons of their own that nevertheless supported allied strategy. Finally, the Iraqis' lack of any preparation, prior to the crisis, for terrorist action meant that they were simply unable to conduct more than a few ineffective operations.
