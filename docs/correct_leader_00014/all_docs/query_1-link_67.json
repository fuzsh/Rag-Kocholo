The “new” Babylon was so poorly done, it started to crumble several years later].\n\nSaddam spent millions on this marble palace, outfitting it with intricately carved doors, crystal chandeliers, and gold toilets. And despite all the glitz and glamour, he was said to have spent only one night in the joint.\n\nToday, most of the trappings — which were stripped by locals after Saddam was overthrown — are gone, replaced by graffiti, barbed wire, and (oddly enough) a basketball hoop."
