        "text": "U.S. forces in Baghdad might now be searching high and low for Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, but in the past Saddam was seen by U.S. intelligence services as a bulwark of anti-communism and they used him as their instrument for more than 40 years, according to former U.S. intelligence diplomats and intelligence officials.\n\nUnited Press International has interviewed almost a dozen former U.S. diplomats, British scholars and former U.S. intelligence officials to piece together the following account. The CIA declined to comment on the report.\n\nWhile many have thought that Saddam first became involved with U.S. intelligence agencies at the start of the September 1980 Iran-Iraq war, his first contacts with U.S. officials date back to 1959, when he was part of a CIA-authorized six-man squad tasked with assassinating then Iraqi Prime Minister Gen. Abd al-Karim Qasim.\n\nIn July 1958, Qasim had overthrown the Iraqi monarchy in what one former U.S. diplomat, who asked not to be identified, described as \"a horrible orgy of bloodshed.\" According to current and former U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, Iraq was then regarded as a key buffer and strategic asset in the Cold War with the Soviet Union. For example, in the mid-1950s, Iraq was quick to join the anti-Soviet Baghdad Pact which was to defend the region and whose members included Turkey, Britain, Iran and Pakistan. Little attention was paid to Qasim's bloody and conspiratorial regime until his sudden decision to withdraw from the pact in 1959, an act that \"freaked everybody out\" according to a former senior U.S. State Department official.\n\nWashington watched in marked dismay as Qasim began to buy arms from the Soviet Union and put his own domestic communists into ministry positions of \"real power,\" according to this official. The domestic instability of the country prompted CIA Director Allan Dulles to say publicly that Iraq was \"the most dangerous spot in the world.\"\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Miles Copeland, a veteran CIA operative, told UPI that the CIA had enjoyed \"close ties\" with Qasim's ruling Baath Party, just as it had close connections with the intelligence service of Egyptian leader Gamal Abdul Nasser...."
