HOW SADDAM HUSSEIN ABUSED THE UNITED NATIONS OIL-FOR-FOOD PROGRAM ---------- MONDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 2004 U.S. Senate, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, Washington, DC. The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 12:04 p.m., in room SD-342, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Norm Coleman, Chairman of the Subcommittee, presiding. Present: Senators Coleman, Levin, Collins, Bennett, Lieberman, Pryor, and L. Graham. Staff Present: Raymond V. Shepherd, III, Staff Director and Chief Counsel; Joseph V. Kennedy, General Counsel; Leland Erickson, Counsel; Mark Greenblatt, Counsel; Steven Groves, Counsel; Jay Jennings, Investigator; Katherine English, Counsel; Mary D. Robertson, Chief Clerk; Katherine Russell, Detailee, FBI; Phillip Thomas, Detailee, GAO; Gregory Coats, Detailee, IRS; Jeffrey James, Detailee, IRS; Sean Gray, Intern; Elise J. Bean, Staff Director and Chief Counsel to the Minority; Dan Berkovitz, Counsel to the Minority; and Zack Schram, Professional Staff to the Minority. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR COLEMAN Senator Coleman. This hearing of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is called to order. Good morning, and thank you all for being here. Today's hearing represents the first findings from our investigation into the United Nations Oil-for-Food (OFF) Program. The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations began this bipartisan investigation in April. After 7 months of investigating, 8 subpoenas, 13 Chairman's letters, numerous interviews with key participants and the receipt of over a million pages of evidence, we are just beginning to understand the behind-the-scenes machinations of participants in the Oil- for-Food Program. The magnitude of fraud perpetrated by Saddam Hussein in contravention of UN sanctions in the Oil-for-Food Program is staggering. The Majority staff estimates that Saddam generated personal profits of over $21.3 billion, in contravention of UN sanctions, from 1991 to 2002. Today, we examine in more detail how it occurred. But why it was able to occur and flourish over the course of a decade is still not fully understood. The extent to which member states were motivated by Saddam's influence-peddling to ignore the fraud and lack of oversight has not been fully explored. The question that hangs out there is how high up does the corruption go? The extent to which UN officials personally benefited from Saddam's influence-peddling has not been fully explored. We need substantially greater cooperation from the United Nations to answer these and other questions. Senator Levin and I have joined together and requested access to the United Nations' investigative reports and personnel. To our dismay, those requests have to date been denied. In addition, I am angered by the proactive interference of the United Nations with our efforts to question groups contracted by the United Nations to oversee parts of this program. I believe the credibility of the United Nations to monitor any future sanctions programs hangs in the balance unless the corruption and mismanagement in Oil-for-Food is identified and rooted out. In the end, my goal, and I believe the goal of all of us on this Subcommittee is to reach conclusions based on facts, to ask questions to which answers must be given, and hopefully when candor and fairness return, end the quagmire of doubts about the Oil-for-Food Program and the United Nations' role in it. The Oil-for-Food Program was intended to allow the Government of Iraq to provide for humanitarian aid and assistance for its people. Instead, under the Oil-for-Food Program, Saddam Hussein generated massive amounts of money that had one sole purpose--to keep him in power. He used the money to cultivate international support to avoid being responsive to UN resolution after UN resolution. The Iraqi people suffered, the world is more dangerous, and Saddam laughed at world opinion and UN sanctions. And the failure of the program wasn't just in providing food, medicine and comfort to the Iraqi people, but the failure of the program was also in not having strong oversight and checks and balances that would have prevented a small group of people and nations from reaping billions and billions of dollars from the people of Iraq. Finally, the question must be raised as to what happened to Saddam's billions, and are they being used today to fuel an insurgency that has taken the lives of over 1,000 American and Coalition servicemen and women and thousands of our Iraqi allies? The clear inference can be drawn that the failed management of the Oil-for-Food Program has cost the lives of many innocent individuals. We have an obligation to more fully understand how this massive fraud was able to thrive for so long, who benefited from it, and what has been its past and ongoing costs in dollars and in lives. So how much money did Saddam generate, in contravention of the UN sanctions, from 1991 to 2002? As stated earlier, the Majority staff estimates the figure to be $21.3 billion. That figure builds upon previous estimates of the General Accounting Office, $10.1 billion, and the figure contained in the Duelfer report, $10.9 billion. This $21.3 billion estimate is based upon evidence discovered during our investigation and was formulated with the assistance of experts from the Joint Economic Committee, the Congressional Budget Office, and GAO. The estimate of $21.3 billion includes--and I would refer to a chart to my left, Chart 1a. \\1\\--it includes oil smuggling facilitated through trade protocols with Iraq, as well as unauthorized smuggling, including topping-off of oil tankers, $13.5 billion; surcharges on oil purchases, $241 million; kickbacks on humanitarian goods, $4.4 billion; sub-standard goods purchased under the Oil-for-Food Program, $2.1 billion. I believe that is a new category that had not been included in other estimates, as are the abuses in the Northern Kurdish region, $405 million, and investment of illicit revenues, $403 million. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ See Exhibit No. 1a., which appears in the Appendix on page 102. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Today, the Subcommittee will unveil evidence that will show how Saddam used vouchers to peddle influence and reward friends around the world, how Saddam extracted illegal surcharges from oil purchases, and how blue chip international corporations gave Saddam millions in illegal kickbacks. Our first witness today is Charles Duelfer, Special Advisor to the Director of Central Intelligence on Iraq's WMD. We look forward to his testimony about the report he prepared for the Administration detailing Iraq's abuse of the OFF Program.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ Comprehensive Report of the Special Advisor to the DCI on Iraq's WMD, September 30, 2004 (Volumes I, II, and III), prepared by Charles Duelfer, Special Advisor to the Director of Central Intelligence, retained in the files of the Subcommittee as Exhibit No. 37. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Duelfer report concludes that Saddam Hussein's primary goal was to have UN sanctions lifted. In addition, he found that the introduction of the OFF Program was a key turning point for the regime. This program provided additional illicit billions of dollars in revenue streams of kickbacks and surcharges. More importantly, the program rescued Iraq's economy from UN sanctions by increasing economic activity and reducing international support for UN sanctions. It appears that OFF abuses, particularly vouchers to well-placed individuals and entities favoring Iraq, and kickbacks and surcharges which went unhindered by the UN Security Council despite their knowledge of them, emboldened Saddam Hussein to finance and procure missile delivery systems, dual-use items and military munitions. As we know, Saddam Hussein devised a myriad of ways to violate the OFF Program. On the second panel, investigative counsels from the Subcommittee will present new evidence that describes three of the principal ways that Hussein abused the sale of Iraqi oil under the OFF Program. First, we will hear testimony that illustrates how Saddam converted oil into influence. In that segment, we will examine how Saddam gave so-called oil vouchers to foreign officials, journalists and possibly even terrorist entities in order to peddle influence and reward friends. In doing so, we will reveal previously undisclosed evidence that indicates what oil vouchers were and how the voucher process worked. For instance, we will introduce a number of documents that illustrate how high-ranking officials in Saddam's regime, such as Tariq Aziz, were personally involved in handing out these favors. We will present a step-by-step review of how voucher recipients turned these favors into cash. For instance, we will see evidence of how Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a prominent Russian politician, invited an American oil company to negotiate the sale of an oil voucher. We will show how vouchers which translated into formal oil contracts were then approved by the UN. As an example, we will trace a voucher given to a Syrian journalist named Hamidah Na'na, and see how that voucher ended up as a formal contract for the sale of oil under the Oil-for-Food Program. In the end, our presentation will reveal how Saddam turned UN sanctions on their head and actually used the Oil-for-Food Program to his own advantage. Aside from our analysis of Saddam's oil vouchers, we will examine a second method that Saddam used to abuse the sale of oil under the OFF Program, namely oil surcharges. While the voucher scheme was employed to peddle influence, the surcharge was simply a way to generate under-the-table revenue for Saddam's cash-strapped regime. We will explore how Saddam managed to generate roughly $230 million in revenue through the oil surcharges. Our presentation will include new evidence of who made under-the-table payments to the regime. We will also explore how they made those payments. For instance, we will trace one transaction that involved an American oil company in which more than $1 million in illegal payments were made to the Hussein regime. Finally, we will present an excerpt of a document created by the Government of Iraq that details each and every surcharge payment. In addition to influence-peddling and generating illicit revenue from oil vouchers and surcharges, Saddam Hussein concocted a separate scheme to siphon off billions of dollars for himself by demanding kickbacks on contracts for humanitarian goods. Saddam used his freedom to contract with whomever he pleased to cut deals that were in his own best interests and not for the humanitarian needs of his people. We will also hear testimony describing the kickbacks paid by a Scottish company called The Weir Group, which did over $80 million worth of business under the Oil-for-Food Program. The story of Weir is particularly disturbing, since it demonstrates that legitimate, reputable corporations were complicit in enriching the regime of Saddam Hussein. Our investigation revealed that in June 2000, the Iraqi regime demanded kickbacks from Weir. Rather than reject the demand, Weir agreed to enter into an arrangement to pay a portion of every subsequent contract back to Saddam. We will hear testimony detailing this arrangement and a step-by-step description of how Weir inflated its contracts by marking up the price of its products and by overstating the quantity of parts shipped. At the direction of the Iraqi regime, and over the course of 4 years and 15 contracts, Weir paid over $8 million into a secret Swiss bank account in the name of a non-existent corporation called Corsin Financial Limited. Weir and Iraq were able to transact business in this manner with impunity under the nose of the United Nations and without regard of the sanctions imposed by the international community. The Office of the Iraqi Program, the UN entity that oversaw the Oil-for-Food Program, approved Weir's contracts even though the prices of the contracts were sometimes inflated by 30 to 40 percent. Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Juan Zarate is the perfect witness to wrap up the hearing today. As head of the Interagency Iraqi Asset Tracking Task Force, Mr. Zarate will provide valuable information on the efforts of the U.S. Government and its Coalition partners to identify, locate and repatriate the assets of the Iraqi people. Although the Department of the Treasury's primary mission is recovery of Iraqi assets, one tangent of this recovery effort has been the uncovering of information pertaining to the illegal kickbacks, surcharges and other fraudulent activities committed by the former Iraqi regime under the UN Oil-for-Food Program. How much of the $21.3 billion, as estimated by this Subcommittee, has been channeled into the hands of terrorists or is currently funding the insurgency in Iraq? I don't know if Mr. Zarate can answer this question, but he will provide examples of Treasury's efforts in undermining terrorist activities through the identification and freezing of assets, as well as the designation of terrorist individuals and organizations. Again, the question of how much of this $21.3 billion is fueling insurgency today is one that ultimately has to be answered. The weaknesses in the Oil-for-Food Program raise serious questions about the United Nation's ability to enforce sanctions and administer a humanitarian aid program in the future. American taxpayers pay close to 22 percent of the UN's operating costs. They need assurances and deserve assurances that their tax dollars are being well spent, especially in light of the fact that sanctions will likely be imposed upon other nations in the future. The mal-administration--and I submit to you this is an understatement--of the program has also undermined the infrastructure and the economy of Iraq, which has led to a substantially greater level of U.S. money needed for the reconstruction of Iraq after the war. The Iraqi people were harmed by sub-standard food and medicine, severely affecting the quality of life of innocent Iraqis. Finally, allegations have been raised by credible sources that money diverted from the OFF Program has been diverted to the Iraqi insurgency and to terrorist activities both in Iraq and elsewhere around the world. If these allegations are true, then the failure of the OFF Program can be tied directly to the loss of American lives, Coalition lives and the lives, as I said before, of thousands of our Iraqi allies. I anticipate that our investigation will lead to many more disclosures over the next several months. The Subcommittee will continue to work diligently to uncover the truth, and when we feel confident that we have found it, we will schedule additional hearings. I especially want to thank Mr. Duelfer and Mr. Zarate for their cooperation in helping us get to the truth. I hope that others will be equally forthcoming. Before I turn it over to the Subcommittee's Ranking Member, Senator Levin, I do want to acknowledge the presence of our Committee's Chairman, Senator Collins, and the Ranking Member, Senator Lieberman. Thank you both very much for being here. With that, I turn it over to the Subcommittee's distinguished Ranking Member, Senator Levin. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEVIN Senator Levin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Today, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is conducting the first of several hearings examining efforts by Saddam Hussein to undermine the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program and to misuse its humanitarian aims to obtain illicit revenues. It is important that we take some time to understand what worked and what didn't work in the Oil-for-Food Program, how the program succeeded and how it failed, and how Saddam Hussein worked to undermine the sanctions. Sanctions are a club which can have an impact, as they apparently are doing today in Iran. It is useful to learn from the Iraqi experience, in which sanctions basically achieved their goals but were weakened in a number of ways, so that we can make sanctions work as effectively as possible. The Subcommittee's investigation can contribute to that learning process. Much of the testimony today will concern how Saddam Hussein attempted to circumvent the UN sanctions program to obtain revenues that helped perpetuate his regime's iron grip on power in Iraq. A major focus of today's hearing will be the Duelfer report.\\1\\ This report provides extensive detail on how Saddam Hussein gamed the system, including the use of so-called trade protocols, oil vouchers, contract awards, surcharges and kickbacks in an attempt to undermine the sanctions, while simultaneously obtaining illicit revenues and prohibited military equipment. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Comprehensive Report of the Special Advisor to the DCI on Iraq's WMD, September 30, 2004 (Volumes I, II, and III), prepared by Charles Duelfer, Special Advisor to the Director of Central Intelligence, retained in the files of the Subcommittee as Exhibit No. 37. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The objective of the UN sanctions was to prevent Saddam Hussein from developing weapons of mass destruction and rebuilding Iraq's conventional military forces. The sanctions were not intended to stop all international trade with Iraq, but to prevent Iraq from re-arming and threatening regional stability. While Saddam had some success in circumventing sanctions, for the most part the UN sanctions achieved their intended objective of preventing Saddam from re-arming and developing weapons of mass destruction. In testimony before the Senate in 2001, Secretary of State Colin Powell testified that the sanctions had been successful and should be continued. He explained as follows, ``Saddam Hussein has not been able to rebuild his army, notwithstanding claims that he has. He has fewer tanks in his inventory today than he had 10 years ago. Even though we know he is working on weapons of mass destruction--we know he has things squirreled away--at the same time we have not seen that capacity emerge to present a full- fledged threat to us.'' Referring to sanctions, Secretary Powell added, ``So I think credit has to be given for putting in place a regime that has kept him pretty much in check,'' referring again to the sanctions regime. Earlier this year, our new Ambassador to Iraq and former U.S. Ambassador to the UN John Negroponte testified before the Senate that the sanctions had largely achieved their purpose, ``The U.S. Government supported the program's general objective of creating a system to address the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi civilian population, while maintaining strict sanctions enforcement of items that Saddam Hussein could use to rearm or reconstitute his WMD program.'' And Negroponte concluded, ``We believe the system the Security Council devised by and large met those objectives.'' Most recently, the Duelfer report provided a detailed analysis of how UN sanctions constrained Saddam's efforts to re-arm. The Duelfer report states, ``Sanctions imposed constraints on potential WMD programs through limitations on resources and restraints on imports. The sanctions forced Iraq to slash funding that might have been used to refurbish the military establishment and complicated the import of military goods. Rebuilding the military, including any WMD capability, required an end to sanctions.'' The Duelfer report also found that sanctions had prevented Iraq from significantly rebuilding its conventional forces, confirming Secretary Powell's 2001 assessment, as well as a report by the General Accounting Office in 2002. The GAO report stated the following, ``According to U.S. and UN officials, there is no indication that Iraq has purchased large-scale weapons systems, such as aircraft, ships or armor. Iraq's conventional rearmament efforts are limited to purchases of small arms and spare parts to keep weapons and vehicles not destroyed during the Gulf War operational. Most importantly, according to State Department arms experts, conventional weapons systems such as aircraft and ships are expensive and UN controls have limited the amount that Iraq can spend on arms.'' Now, the chart that I am putting up which was compiled from data recently updated by the GAO shows how effective the UN sanctions were in reducing Iraq's ability to develop weapons of mass destruction and large-scale conventional forces.\\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ See Exhibit No. 31, which appears in the Appendix on page 174. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The data shows that Iraq's military spending after sanctions were imposed in 1991 fell to a small fraction of what it had been prior to sanctions. It indicates that despite Saddam Hussein's relentless efforts to circumvent the sanctions, once they were imposed Iraq's military spending plummeted. The fact that the sanctions were basically meeting their objective was the main reason that Saddam Hussein tried so hard to get around them. The Duelfer report surmises that had Saddam Hussein succeeded in ending the sanctions, he would likely have resumed re-arming Iraq, with potentially dangerous results. Whether Saddam Hussein would have succeeded in ending sanctions will never be known. What we do know is that the sanctions, in fact, largely prevented Iraq from re-arming. We also know that the Oil-for-Food Program weakened the sanctions by allowing Saddam to pick the winners of the contracts issued under the program. The proceeds from the oil sales went into an escrow account for humanitarian use, but Saddam repeatedly inflated the dollar amount for humanitarian contracts and obtained kickbacks from these contracts and the oil sales to the tune of about $1.7 billion. Saddam's abuse of the Oil-for-Food Program, however, provided only a fraction, about one-sixth, of Iraq's total illicit income. According to the Duelfer report, the vast majority, which is in blue there, nearly three-quarters of Saddam's illicit income during the sanctions period, was generated through publicly-disclosed trade agreements, called protocols, to sell Iraqi oil to its neighbors, primarily Jordan, Syria, and Turkey. Those protocols constituted a far greater subversion of the sanctions because Iraq, instead of the UN, controlled the estimated $8 billion in proceeds. The world, including the United States, knew of these contracts between Iraq and its neighbors, but winked at them, even though they represented the vast majority of Saddam Hussein's illicit income. Now, the chart, which uses data in the Duelfer report, depicts the amounts and types of illicit income earned by Iraq during the sanctions period.\\1\\ It shows that the trade agreements which were not part of the Oil-for-Food Program were the largest single source, about 75 percent, of Iraq's illicit income, generating $8 billion out of a total that was estimated in the Duelfer report of $10.7 billion. According to the Duelfer report, the Oil-for-Food Program generated about $1.7 billion, or about 16 percent of Iraq's total illicit income. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ See Exhibit No. 32, which appears in the Appendix on page 175. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Iraq also used the trade protocols to obtain illicit income; also, not only that, but military items prohibited by the UN sanctions. The Duelfer report provides extensive information about how Iraq used the protocols, those sales agreements, to obtain equipment for its conventional military forces, including missile, jet engine and radar components. Indeed, it appears from the Duelfer report that the vast majority of Iraq's illegal military equipment was procured through the trade protocols rather than through abuse of the Oil-for-Food Program. Iraq's ongoing oil sales to its neighbors was no secret. Both the United Nations and the United States knew of it and deliberately let the trade continue, presumably to maintain the support of Iraq's neighboring countries for the overall sanctions regime and to obtain other foreign policy objectives. In the United States, successive Administrations, both the Clinton Administration and the Bush Administration, acknowledged the existence of the Jordanian and Turkish trade deals, and routinely waived provisions of U.S. law that would have prohibited U.S. foreign aid to these countries for violating the UN sanctions on Iraq. According to the Duelfer report, Jordan and Syria were the major sources of illicit income for Iraq during the sanctions regime and the major sources of prohibited military equipment as well. The failure of U.S. Administrations to take forceful action to stop Iraq's illicit dealings with Syria, a nation branded by the State Department as a major sponsor of terrorism, is perhaps the most troubling. The illicit oil trade between Iraq and Syria began in late 2000 with the opening of a pipeline and it quickly expanded. In February 2001, Secretary of State Powell said that he had obtained personal assurances from the Syrian president that he would place the Syrian-Iraqi trade under the UN Oil-for-Food Program. According to a contemporaneous press report, ``Mr. Powell said that he had won agreement from Syria to place into a United Nations escrow account revenues that Mr. Hussein was receiving from oil flowing through Syrian pipelines. In the last few months, those revenues have been going into Mr. Hussein's pockets, illustrating the fraying of sanctions. The commitment from Syria was so firm that President Assad stated it three times during the meeting, Secretary Powell said, that the Secretary said that he telephoned President Bush to tell him.'' But Syria not only failed to keep its promise; it increased its oil trade with Iraq, paying Saddam more than $1 billion annually. This trade continued right up to the outbreak of war, when the U.S. military finally cut off the illegal flow of oil from Iraq to Syria. Iraqi oil sales to Syria supplied Saddam Hussein with billions of dollars in illicit revenue. Yet, the United States and other nations apparently did little to stop it. In February 2002, The Washington Post reported, ``U.S. officials have applied little direct pressure on Damascus, even though this revenue is one of the few ways Iraqi President Saddam Hussein can pay to maintain his military and finance any efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction.'' It then quoted an Administration official who acknowledged the trade but expressed little, if any, determination to curtail it, ``Make no mistake about it, the pipeline issue is a serious topic and a point of contention. Are we willing to make it a sticking point so that it affects the relationship between our two countries? No. We have to be pragmatic.'' The bottom line is the United States and other nations tolerated the trade protocols and the Iraqi oil sales which, according to the Duelfer report, produced billions of dollars in unaccounted revenue for Saddam, as well as prohibited military equipment for Iraq. Evaluating whether this policy of acquiescence was the right course of action is a key issue not only in drawing lessons from the Iraqi sanctions, but also in designing future international sanctions programs. The Oil-for-Food Program abuses themselves were presumably not acquiesced in. These abuses included awards of oil vouchers and allocations to curry favor, contract surcharges to generate kickbacks, and the use of front companies and bank accounts in countries with corporate and bank secrecy laws. We will hear not only about Saddam Hussein's demand for corrupt payments, but also about the willingness of some companies and individuals to go along with those demands. Oversight was supposed to be provided not only by the United Nations Security Council and its 661 Committee, including the United States, which took on the responsibility of reviewing Oil-for-Food contracts, licensing U.S. companies to do business with Iraq and monitoring Iraq's compliance with UN sanctions. We need to examine the shortcomings in oversight, with the same goal of ensuring that future sanctions regimes will be tighter and more effective. That is what this hearing and subsequent hearings before this Subcommittee are about, helping the world design more effective international sanctions, and I commend Chairman Coleman for his strong leadership in that effort. Thank you. Senator Coleman. Thank you, Senator Levin. Chairman Collins. OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN COLLINS Chairman Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me begin by commending you for conducting this much-needed investigation into Saddam Hussein's abuse of the United Nations' Oil-for-Food Program. I know that you have worked extraordinarily hard during the past several months to unravel the strands of this corrupt scheme. We should remember during the course of this investigation that the Oil-for-Food Program was created out of a genuine desire by the members of the United Nations Security Council to meet the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people while the UN sanctions worked to force compliance with Security Council resolutions. But what happened was that the effort quickly mutated into what the Wall Street Journal has called ``the largest bribery scheme in the history of the world.'' One of the most disturbing aspects of this scandal is its sheer size. While the world may never know exactly how much money was plundered by Saddam Hussein's regime, the Government Accountability Office estimated in July that Saddam amassed more than $10 billion in illegal revenues between 1997 and 2002. That is $10 billion out of a total of $67 billion during that time period. The Subcommittee's estimate, which looks at a longer time frame, is more than $21 billion. It is deeply troubling that the UN sanctions could be circumvented by Saddam Hussein on such a massive scale. Moreover, the evidence suggests that the Oil-for-Food Program was manipulated by Saddam Hussein to erode the international community's resolve to enforce the sanctions against his regime. Just one example of how this money was stolen can be found in Saddam Hussein spending $2 billion during the 1990s to build nine lavish presidential palaces. As former General Tommy Franks said during a visit to one such palace, perhaps the Oil- for-Food Program should have been dubbed the Oil-for-Palaces program instead. But far worse, much of Saddam Hussein's illicit revenue was used for the more sinister purpose of undermining sanctions and rebuilding the Iraqi war machine. I view what happened a little differently than my friend and colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin. One of today's witnesses, Charles Duelfer, will tell us, as he reported in September, that ``The billions of dollars of revenue generated by the various protocols, illicit surcharges and oil smuggling schemes drove the explosive growth in Iraq's military imports.'' This allowed the Iraq Military Industrialization Commission, which was the agency responsible for overseeing the Iraqi military-industrial infrastructure, to smuggle millions of dollars' worth of military equipment into Iraq, in contravention to the UN sanctions. Mr. Duelfer's report explains that this commission's budget grew from $7.8 million in 1996, to $350 million in 2002, to $500 million in 2003, all during a period when Iraq was supposed to be under strict UN sanctions. I look forward to hearing the testimony of today's witnesses and the light that they will shed on this very complex course of events. I think this investigation and series of hearings is extraordinarily important. I commend the Chairman and Senator Levin for investigating the scope of this scandal and for identifying what steps need to be taken to ensure that this kind of blatant wrongdoing and corruption never again occurs in any future humanitarian programs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Senator Collins follows:] PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR COLLINS Let me begin by commending you for conducting this much-needed investigation into Saddam Hussein's abuse of the United Nations Oil- for-Food Program. I know that you have worked extraordinarily hard for months at unraveling the strands of this corrupt scheme. The Oil-for-Food Program was created out of a genuine desire by the members of the United Nations Security Council to meet the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people while UN sanctions worked to force compliance with Security Council resolutions. But this effort quickly mutated into what the Wall Street Journal has called ``the largest bribery scheme in the history of the world.'' One of the most disturbing aspects of this scandal is its sheer size. While the world may never know exactly how much money was plundered by Saddam Hussein's regime, the Government Accountability Office estimated in July that Saddam amassed more than 10 billion dollars in illegal revenues between 1997 and 2002. That's 10 billion dollars in a 67 billion dollar program. The Subcommittee's estimate over a longer period is a staggering 21 billion dollars. I am deeply troubled that UN sanctions could be circumvented by the former Iraqi regime on such a massive scale. Moreover, the evidence suggests that the Oil-for-Food Program was manipulated by Saddam to erode the international community's resolve to enforce the sanctions against his regime. Just one example of how this money was stolen can be found in Saddam spending two billion dollars during the 1990s to construct nine lavish presidential palaces. As General Tommy Franks said during a visit to one such palace, perhaps the Oil-for-Food Program should have been dubbed the ``Oil for Places'' program instead. But far worse, much of Saddam Hussein's illicit revenue was used for the more sinister purpose of undermining sanctions and rebuilding the Iraqi war machine. One of today's witnesses, Charles Duelfer, reported in September that, ``The billions of dollars of revenue generated by the various protocols, illicit surcharges, and oil smuggling schemes drove the explosive growth in [Iraq's] military imports. This allowed [Iraq's Military Industrialization Commission] to smuggle millions of dollars worth of military equipment into Iraq in contravention of UN Sanctions.'' The Military Industrialization Commission, incidentally, was the agency in Iraq's government responsible for overseeing the Iraqi military-industrial infrastructure. Mr. Duelfer's report explains that this Commission's budget grew from 7.8 million dollars in 1996 to 350 million dollars in 2002 to 500 million in 2003, all during a period when Iraq was supposed to be under UN sanctions. I look forward to the testimony of today's witnesses, and the light they will shed on this very complex course of events. And I again commend Senator Coleman and Senator Levin for investigating the scope of this scandal and what steps need to be taken to ensure that the same kind of wrongdoing never occurs in future such humanitarian programs. Senator Coleman. Thank you, Chairman Collins. Senator Lieberman. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LIEBERMAN Senator Lieberman. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I thank you and Senator Levin for initiating this critically important investigation. Mr. Chairman, this investigation is not only important insofar as we learn lessons from it that will help us and the United Nations and the international community in the application and implementation of sanctions. I think it may be important in terms of our understanding, and perhaps even the American people's understanding, of the history of what was going on in Iraq. I am pleased to see Mr. Duelfer here. I must say that the bottom line here is that this investigation, Mr. Duelfer's and now the Subcommittee's, has shown us the way in which a supposedly humanitarian program, certainly a program adopted for humanitarian reasons, in part as a result of a cunning international marketing campaign by the Saddam Hussein regime to develop concern about people suffering in Iraq as a result of the sanctions--that humanitarian program was corrupted and exploited by Saddam Hussein not only illicitly, but for the most horrible and aggressive of purposes. Mr. Duelfer's report in this regard and the Subcommittee's investigation, I think, shows that Saddam Hussein was guilty of the grandest larceny in pursuit of a grand plan to re-arm, including the reconstitution of his program of weapons of mass destruction. I must say, Mr. Duelfer, I appreciate that the Subcommittee has brought you back because I feel that your initial report was a superb piece of work and, in my opinion, may have been the most mis-reported and misinterpreted governmental document in my 16 years in the Senate of the United States. The reason I say that is that too many people jumped on your conclusion that you did not find weapons of mass destruction, even though in your report--and I have read every word of it and I have read every public statement of yours on the report that I could find--you caution that readers not reach definitive conclusions based on your inability to find WMD, and certainly not to conclude that Saddam didn't have them at the time the war began, or perhaps even that there were not some there. In fact, your report documents a network of clandestine laboratories involved in work related to both biological and chemical weapons. But more to the point of this investigation, what you make clear--and this is based not on any pre-war intelligence which we now have so much doubt about--it is based on the Iraq Survey Group which you headed, more than 1,500 people, as I recall, with full range, as much as you could throughout Iraq, and access to people that, needless to say, in Saddam Hussein's government, we had no access to prior to the war. I think you reach some very clear and compelling conclusions, and I want to just read from the report. ``Saddam Hussein wanted to recreate Iraq's WMD capability after sanctions were removed. Saddam aspired to develop a nuclear capability, but he intended to focus on ballistic missile and tactical chemical warfare capabilities in the short run.'' I continue to quote, ``Saddam recognized that the reconstitution of Iraqi WMD enhanced both his security and his image. Consequently, Saddam needed to end UN-imposed sanctions to fulfill his goals. Saddam continually directed his advisers to formulate and implement strategies, policies and methods to terminate the UN sanctions regime established by UNSCR 661.'' I am continuing to read selectively from the report. ``Under Saddam's orders, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Iraq formulated and implemented a strategy aimed at these United Nations Security Council members and international public opinion, with the purpose of ending UN sanctions and undermining its subsequent Oil-for-Food Program by diplomatic and economic means.'' Then you say, ``Once that undermining,'' by the various forms that we have heard described already today--``Once the money began to flow into Iraq, the regime's authorities devised and implemented methods and techniques to procure illicit goods from foreign suppliers. To implement its procurement efforts, Iraq, under Saddam, created a network of Iraqi front companies, some with close relationships to high-ranking foreign government officials, to procure illicit goods, services and technologies for Iraq's WMD-related conventional arms and/or dual-use goods programs,'' so again WMD-related. The regime financed these government sanctions programs by several illicit revenue streams that we will describe here today. ``Saddam used the Iraq Intelligence Service to undertake the most sensitive procurement missions. Consequently, the IIS facilitated the import of UN-sanctioned and dual-use goods into Iraq through countries like Syria, Jordan, Belarus, and Turkey. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs played a critical role in facilitating Iraq's procurement of military goods and dual-use goods pertaining to weapons of mass destruction, transporting cash and other valuable goods earned by illicit oil revenue and forming and implementing a diplomatic strategy to end UN sanctions and the subsequent Oil-for-Food Program by nefarious means.'' ``Nefarious'' is the right word. So I conclude from this section of your report that Saddam Hussein was doing everything he could to both evade and abuse the sanctions program, the Oil-for-Food Program, with the purpose of protecting the intellectual and other capacity he had for a WMD program, including the development and delivery systems like long-range missiles, much of it with the intent of breaking out of the sanctions program for a primary purpose of reconstituting at full pace his WMD program, with an emphasis on long-range delivery systems and chemical weapons, but also returning to his biological and nuclear weapons programs, which says to me--and I apologize for this, but to me it is central-- that those who argue that the war to overthrow Saddam was a mistake because WMD was not found, do not allow for the many other good reasons to overthrow Saddam because he was a brutal dictator and murdered hundreds of thousands of his people and he supported terrorism. But based on your report, after the war, talking to people who weren't available before the war, and based particularly on these sections that document his cruel, merciless evasions of the sanctions program, it is clear to me that had we not overthrown Saddam Hussein, by this time he might have broken out of sanctions. He certainly would have been on the way to doing so, and therefore reconstituting his WMD program, which says to me, as many of us have said many times before, the world is a lot safer with Saddam Hussein in prison and not in power. I want to just add a final word about the United Nations and complimenting the Chairman and Ranking Member of this Subcommittee on their persistence. For many of us who continue to hold dear the ideals which motivated the formation of the United Nations, too much of its behavior too much of the time has eaten away at what I believe are those ideals. Your report here, and the Subcommittee's investigation unfortunately holds another cloud, a dark cloud over the United Nations and our hopes for its constructive peace-making and peace-keeping role in the world, because it is clear here that the UN not only mismanaged the Oil-for-Food Program, but that United Nations officials themselves may have participated in Saddam's efforts to undermine the very controls they were charged with enforcing. Now, it goes without saying that those are extremely serious charges, and until the facts are in it would be premature and unfair to reach any conclusions. In fact, the UN has opened its own investigation, headed by Paul Volcker, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve. But that is no excuse for the United Nations not to have cooperated with this Subcommittee's investigation. I wanted to join with Senators Coleman and Levin in urging the United Nations to cooperate fully and promptly with this Subcommittee's requests, or to risk further diminishing the support that does still exist in this Congress for the important work of the United Nations. I thank the Chairman. Senator Coleman. Thank you, Senator Lieberman. Senator Pryor. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PRYOR Senator Pryor. Thank you. I just wanted to really say thank you to Chairman Coleman and Senators Levin, Collins, and Lieberman, for your great leadership not just on this issue, because you have been great on the Oil-for-Food Program, but also on a variety of issues over the last couple of years since I have been in the Senate that relate to Iraq, homeland security, national defense and national security. They relate to intelligence, and the list goes on and on. I want to thank you all, and if we don't accomplish anything else today other than to get a clear and accurate picture of what was going on in Iraq during the Oil-for-Food Program, this hearing would be worth doing. But I think there is a larger and more significant piece to this. That in and of itself is very important, but maybe more significant than that is to look to the future because we know it won't be long--we don't know when, but at some point the United Nations or some other organization will impose sanctions on some other country. In fact, there are sanctions that exist today around the world, but to learn from what was going on in Iraq will help us to do a better job in the future to make sure that sanctions are most effective and that they actually accomplish the goals that they set out to accomplish. So, again, I want to thank the Chairman and everyone for their leadership on this issue. Senator Coleman. Thank you, Senator Pryor. Senator Pryor, let me return the compliment by saying I don't know if there is another single Member of this Subcommittee who has been as active in all our investigations and all the work we have done. So we greatly appreciate your deep involvement in all the matters that have come before us. Thank you. We would now like to welcome our first witness at today's hearing, Charles Duelfer, the Special Advisor to the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency who prepared the comprehensive report of the Special Advisor to the DCI on Iraq's WMD. This recently released report provides an overview and some examples of the abuses related to the Oil-for-Food Program. Mr. Duelfer, I want to express my personal appreciation for the extraordinary service you have rendered this Nation in your search for Saddam Hussein's conventional, radiological, chemical and biological weapons, and for your evaluation of the Oil-for-Food Program. According to press accounts, I understand that an assassin sought to take your life during your recent visit to Baghdad, which resulted in the death of two American soldiers and the wounding of three others. I am glad that you were not injured and can be with us today. I also want to express my condolences to the families of those who gave their lives in service to this Nation and wish a speedy recovery for those who were injured in the attack. I appreciate your attendance at today's important hearing and I am looking forward to hearing your observations about the Oil-for-Food Program. I note, Mr. Duelfer, that you have two of your colleagues with you. Would you identify them for the record, please? Mr. Duelfer. Steve Zidek to my immediate left and Chris Johnsten next to him. Senator Coleman. Thank you very much. Gentlemen, before we begin, pursuant to Rule VI, all witnesses who testify before this Subcommittee are required to be sworn. At this time, I would ask you to please stand and raise your hand. Do you swear that the testimony you give before this Subcommittee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you, God? Mr. Duelfer. I do. Mr. Zidek. I do. Mr. Johnsten. I do. Senator Coleman. We will be using a timing system today. Please be aware that approximately 1 minute before the red light comes on, you will see the lights change from green to yellow and it will give you an opportunity to conclude your remarks. Your written testimony will be printed in the record in its entirety. We ask that you limit your oral testimony to no more than 10 minutes. Mr. Duelfer, you may proceed. TESTIMONY OF CHARLES DUELFER,\\1\\ SPECIAL ADVISOR TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE ON IRAQ'S WMD, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, ACCOMPANIED BY STEPHEN ZIDEK AND CHRISTOPHER JOHNSTEN Mr. Duelfer. Mr. Chairman and Senators, thank you very much. It is customary to thank the Subcommittee for the opportunity to be here, and I do that. But again, as you noted, as a personal note I have to declare my thanks to three individuals who are not here. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The prepared statement of Mr. Duelfer appears in the Appendix on page 67. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As you noted, there was a suicide bomb attack on a convoy I was in and we lost two of the protective details, a staff sergeant, Clinton Wisdom, and Specialist Donald Cleary. And Specialist Nathan Gray was badly injured. Without their actions, I doubt whether I would be here today. And in a way, I think that lends even more gratitude that you are taking this interest in this material because the report and the facts we tried to assemble were not done without significant cost. And I think they merit debate; they merit a lot of attention in terms of lessons learned. This has been a long tragedy for many decades, and my experience last week was only just the most recent. So, as with your colleagues, Mr. Chairman, I think it is good that this investigation take place. My report and the supporting analysis aimed at providing a synthetic view of the former regime's decisions and strategies as it related to WMD. It was one of my objectives to describe the context within which Saddam made his decisions about WMD. WMD did not happen in a vacuum. To understand what happened to Iraqi and WMD, and perhaps to learn lessons that might inform future policies, I felt it was important to examine the surrounding factors that impinged on Saddam's decisions. At different times, Saddam opted to have, and then to have not, WMD. It was my hope to try to illuminate the conditions that led to these different courses. I also tried to analyze the regime's relationship with WMD over time. We have been wrestling with the prospect of the Iraqi Nation with Saddam and WMD for almost three decades. It would have been grossly deficient to simply tally up the remnants of the WMD program. My goal was to understand the dynamics behind the decisions that Saddam made. To this end, we delved into the nature of Saddam's objectives and his perspectives on the world. A significant part of the report addresses the manner of Saddam's rule and his vision for himself and Iraq. Unlike previous reports on the regime, we had access to primary sources, Saddam's top advisers, as well as to Saddam himself. Understanding and analyzing WMD in Iraq is in one way simplified because the regime was basically one person--Saddam Hussein. This certainly bounded the analysis. The second way we found of bounding the problem was to consider the limited amount of resources available to the regime. Sanctions and the oil embargo put strict limits on Iraq's disposable income. It struck me that if we could account for the resources available to the regime and examine how the regime allocated them, we could learn a great deal about its objectives and actions related to WMD. This line of investigation quickly highlighted not just the tangible resources available to Iraq, but also the influence that the regime accrued through the potential to allocate future resources. Examination of the resource decisions and actions that the regime took to disburse its favors proved an excellent way of highlighting the objectives and intentions of Saddam. We identified several key inflection points in this history. One was the summer following the 1991 war. The UN Security Council had taken a decision to link the lifting of sanctions and oil embargo imposed in August 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, to Iraq's ridding itself of WMD. The new inspection organization was created for this purpose. Initially, all thought it would be short-lived, Saddam amongst them. However, during the summer, early inspections proved more meddlesome than Saddam anticipated. And while he made early decisions to offer partial compliance, it became obvious that this would not suffice. Saddam then established as his top priority to get out from the web of international sanctions, and other matters would be pursued on a non-interference basis with this prime objective. His policies, his actions, his tactics and strategies from that point all had the objective of getting rid of sanctions. The evolution of his approach toward the UN Security Council reflected his usual dual approach of reward and threat. In the same way he ruled at home, he dealt with the international community and the UN Security Council, in particular. Saddam offered partial compliance combined with defiance. He always wanted to bargain. He exerted pressure on the Security Council and tried to divide it. He would acquiesce to their demands only when unavoidable, and usually he would acquiesce only partially. He preferred confrontation. His lieutenants criticized this approach as having prolonged the sanctions. Saddam's goal of getting out of sanctions was prime and shaped all his relations with the Security Council and its members. The Security Council recognized from the start that sanctions were a penalty imposed on all Iraqis, not just the leadership. From 1991 on, the Security Council had made available the option for Iraq to sell oil, under condition that the revenues would go only for humanitarian purposes. The Council was very sensitive to accusations that their actions--imposing the sanctions--were the cause of the suffering of the Iraqi people. A pair of resolutions, UNSCR 706 and 712, first provided this option of humanitarian relief to the regime. Saddam understood this pressure and the leverage it conveyed to him. He understood that if he exercised the option of exporting oil under the condition that only humanitarian aid could be delivered, then it would relieve the pressure on the Council to lift sanctions in their entirety. He steadfastly refused to accept this option and at every opportunity chose to link the Security Council and the problems with the inspectors with the deaths of thousands of Iraqi children. In essence, he held his population hostage. Saddam sustained this position for 5 years, during which time conditions in Iraq decayed. Infrastructure collapsed, health care diminished. Aid agencies such as UNICEF reported the statistics of decay. The middle class was wiped out. The value of one Iraqi dinar was over $3.00 before the 1991 war. By 1996, the value was on the order of 1,500 dinars to the dollar. In effect, the entire savings of the middle class vanished. Jobs vanished. Iraqis tried to leave to find work elsewhere. In mid-1995, Saddam's son-in-law, Hussein Kamal, defected to Jordan. Hussein Kamal was the key figure who had been in charge of the development for Saddam of all the WMD programs. When he left, the regime was forced to acknowledge it had not been fully forthcoming with the UN inspectors and WMD documents, materials and programs had been concealed. The sympathy and support that had been building in the Security Council for the Iraqi position dissipated. Even Iraq's friends in the Security Council backed off. Suddenly, Baghdad realized sanctions would not soon be lifted. At the same time, their effect continued to grind down Iraq's people. In 1995, a new resolution, Security Council Resolution 986, was passed to offer relief again to the Iraqi civilian population. This resolution, which became known as the Oil-for- Food Program, was not accepted by Saddam until December 1996, and only after several months of negotiations between the Office of the Secretary General and Baghdad. Saddam only accepted this program when the damage of the sanctions on the civilian infrastructure became regime-threatening. The initiation of this program turned out to have many benefits for the regime. The program did achieve the higher objective of reducing the suffering of the Iraqi population. However, it also had unanticipated collateral benefits for the regime. First, there began a large flow of businessmen to Baghdad in search of contracts. While the UN held the checkbook, in effect, Baghdad still made the decisions on who would get the money. This provided a lever that empowered Saddam to reward or punish those seeking OFF contracts. The flow of commerce expanded quickly to include the refurbishment of the decayed oil infrastructure. Baghdad shrewdly played various parties off against one another to win their favor. They made it clear that sanctions would not last forever, and when they were lifted, Baghdad would remember who their friends were. This attitude permeated all transactions, and the attitude grew that sanctions were eroding and, ``everyone else was making money.'' This effect was intangible, but powerful nevertheless. The report describes the nature of income that Iraq was able to generate during this period. We broke them into largely four types. As some of you have mentioned, there were protocols with neighboring countries, there was smuggling of oil products, there were kickbacks associated with the OFF contracts, and there were surcharges on oil exported through the OFF Program. The report describes in illustrative cases how transactions occurred, estimated their magnitude and, more to the point of the report, where the funds were directed. It has shown, for example, that the budget of the Military Industrial Commission surged from $7.8 million in 1998 to $350 million in 2001. In 2003, Iraq had budgeted $500 million for this organization. Saddam's priorities were quite clear. The process of allocating oil liftings was also instructive in terms of the strategy and tactics of Saddam regarding escaping sanctions. We began obtaining data last winter from the oil ministry and the state oil marketing organization, SOMO. The objective was to review the resources that were available to Iraq and determine if they led to any WMD activities. Combined with our investigation of the procurement mechanisms for sanctioned goods, we developed a fairly robust picture of the systems the regime used. It is not an all- inclusive picture. We made no attempt to unearth all activities, but rather the illustrative examples that were supported by the testimony of Iraqis we debriefed. It is important to emphasize that our work took as a point of departure the Iraqi perspective. We sought to understand what Iraq was doing. We were not investigating the countries that supplied sanctions to Iraq, nor were we investigating the judgments or culpability of any party. I will note a couple of major points from this examination. We found that there was a momentum shift in late 1998, when Iraq terminated cooperation with UN inspectors. To that point, Iraq had been pursuing two tracks to getting out of sanctions. They participated in the inspection and monitoring process at the same time they worked to erode support for that process, and also the sanctions. The decision by Baghdad to terminate cooperation and focus strictly on a policy of erosion of sanctions began in August 1998. The full cessation of cooperation with inspections provoked a limited 4-day bombing campaign by the United States and the United Kingdom in December 1998. Other Council members, including Russia and France, were furious at what they declared to be an unauthorized military action. This left the Security Council deeply divided. At the same time, the OFF Program was continuing and commerce growing in Iraq. The inspectors were gone. As Tariq Aziz, the former Deputy Prime Minister, commented, Baghdad could have sanctions with inspectors or sanctions without inspectors. They chose the latter. Throughout 1999, the Security Council debated how to address Iraq. The sanctions remained, but were fraying, and Iraq applied whatever tools it could to generate support for its position. Ultimately, the Council agreed upon a new resolution, 1284, in December 1999. This replaced the former inspection organ, UNSCOM, with a new one, UNMOVIC, and changed certain other provisions related to the prospects for lifting of sanctions based upon progressive steps of compliance by Iraq. Nevertheless, Iraq chose to ignore the resolution and did not permit inspection. By 2000, funds from the four general revenue streams I noted earlier made life much better for the regime. I would observe that the Jordanian protocol created in the early 1990s now began to be replicated in this period. It was a model Iraq and its neighbors used to open and increase commerce. The infusion of funding allowed Iraq to begin efforts to refurbish conventional military capabilities, among other things, such as palace construction. In 2000, we found Saddam made a decision to invigorate his long-range ballistic missile programs. This was directly keyed to the availability of resources and material and expertise, in spite of sanctions. The view for Iraq was good in 2000 to 2001. Businessmen filled Baghdad's hotels. Flights were restored into Saddam International Airport. The Baghdad International Fairs were bursting with foreign companies and representatives soliciting business with the regime. Saddam was looking like a winner in many places. Attention at OPEC meetings was riveted on the prospects for increased Iraqi oil production. Baghdad derived substantial international leverage from the speculation about its future decisions and their potential effect on markets. Oil analysts and traders were solicitous, if not groveling, with the Iraqi delegations. It was also apparent to Baghdad that the American effort to revise sanctions with so-called Smart Sanctions was an indication of weakness. Baghdad was hearing from other Security Council members that these steps were all favorable to Iraq. It is also important to appreciate that Baghdad was never an easy friend to its supporters. The regime kept making more demands of its friends and often ignored their advice on how to relate to the Security Council. True to form, Saddam made one last strategic blunder. He failed to grasp the effect of the attacks of September 11, 2001. He did not understand how this radically changed the international environment. Only following the January 2002 State of the Union Message did Saddam begin to realize he could no longer stonewall on weapons inspections. He realized too late that his friends on the Security Council were limited in what they could or would do. Yet, he still insisted upon attempts to bargain. He would not simply accept inspections, but rather opened a long process of negotiation with the UN. Ultimately, this worsened the conditions under which Saddam finally accepted inspectors. During 2002, while Saddam tried to negotiate conditions for accepting inspections, the United States pressed for a new resolution with tougher measures than the Council agreed previously, in December 1999. That was in Resolution 1284. This was as reverse from the trend in the Security Council of loosening constraints on Iraq. The tougher U.S. line found more traction in the Council following September 11. Saddam did not understand the changed environment. In conclusion, the portion of this report devoted to the Oil-for-Food Program and the regime's finances is aimed at supporting assessments about WMD programs. It is also a vital indicator of the direction and intentions of the former regime. We were not conducting an investigation of the OFF Program, per se, the United Nations or other nations' actions. Our goal was to delve into the interior of a very opaque and dangerous regime. Much of what we found was ugly. The regime depended not on bringing out the best in people, rather on promoting the worst. It poisoned everything it touched, including the UN. Thank you very much. Senator Coleman. Thank you very much, Mr. Duelfer. If we could put up Exhibit 2.\\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ See Exhibit No. 2, which appears in the Appendix on page 107. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Exhibit 2 is a timeline. Just to make sure I understand kind of the impact of Oil-for-Food, what I heard from you, Mr. Duelfer, is that with the implementation of the Oil-for-Food Program, there was almost a change in the whole atmosphere with Saddam. We have had the Jordanian protocol, for instance, since 1991. But in 1996, we have Oil-for-Food. And if you look, UN actions in blue, and actions by Iraq in yellow. Illicit earnings in 1997 allow them to pursue military procurement, and I think in your testimony you indicated--are you making reference to the MIC, the Military Industrialization Commission, that their budget grew from $7.8 million in 1996 to $350 million in 2002, to $500 million in 2003? Mr. Duelfer. Yes. Senator Coleman. First of all, what was the MIC responsible for? What were they spending that money on? Mr. Duelfer. The Military Industrial Commission or Corporation, depending on the translation, is basically the government-run military industrial complex. It is the entire defense industry. Senator Coleman. So we see a huge increase in their military industrial complex from the time Oil-for-Food gets started until the end of Saddam's regime? Mr. Duelfer. Correct. Senator Coleman. And in 1997, Phase III--it is on the bottom of the chart, vouchers to favorable political parties and individuals. And we are going to have some more discussion of vouchers later on, but I think it is fair to say that Saddam--and you indicated that folks were now dealing directly with Saddam in the capacity to do the contracts, a direct relationship. But vouchers, in effect, gave individuals the option and opportunity to buy Iraqi oil at less than market price, is that correct? Mr. Duelfer. That is correct, yes. Senator Coleman. I think in your report you may even have provided some approximation of where those vouchers went. Thirty percent to Russia, China 15 percent, and 10 percent France--is that from information in your report? Mr. Duelfer. We presented the raw data that we received from Iraq in terms of the assigning of those vouchers, yes. Senator Coleman. And then in 1998, Iraq weaponized VX gas, missile and warheads. Is that from your report? Mr. Duelfer. No. There was a debate in 1998 where UNSCOM raised evidence that Iraq had weaponized VX prior to that time, which they had not admitted. This was a serious issue because it would have thrown off all of the declarations that Iraq had made with respect not only to its chemical weapons program, but also its missile program. This was a huge issue of debate between the UN and Iraq. It was never resolved. Senator Coleman. Did the inspectors, in fact, find VX nerve gas in the summer of 1998? Mr. Duelfer. What we found, or what the inspectors found, was degradation products in remnants of warheads that Iraq had declared has no VX in them. So what they found was evidence that there was VX where there should not have been. Senator Coleman. If I can just touch upon the WMD capabilities, I want to touch upon that. At the onset of Operation Iraqi Freedom, can you just briefly talk about Saddam's WMD capabilities when it came to developing missile technology? How would you characterize that? Mr. Duelfer. At the beginning of OIF, he had a very substantial program in something called the Al-Samood program, which was a missile developed from technology largely derivative of an SA-II, which is a surface-to-air missile. It had a range which exceeded the 150-kilometer limit by the UN. I believe they had in their inventory at that time close to 80 missiles, and a couple of them were used during OIF. Senator Coleman. A capable delivery system for nuclear weapons, chemical, and biological weapons? Mr. Duelfer. What Iraq declared was simply conventional warheads. But, of course, in a WMD program the long pole in the tent is the ballistic missile. So we were concerned about what the potential was. Senator Coleman. And it was fair to say that Saddam successfully acquired all the equipment and supplies necessary to begin manufacturing of biological weapons? Mr. Duelfer. Iraq had the equipment, the intellectual capacity totally indigenously to create biological weapons, should it make that decision. But we did not see evidence that it had biological weapons at that time. Senator Coleman. What I am trying to understand is, and what I heard in the testimony and read in the report, a sense that at one point Saddam was waiting for the end of sanctions, perhaps, to be able to move forward. On the other hand, it appears that with the Oil-for-Food Program Saddam had achieved a lot of his goals. He had hard currency with kickbacks and surcharges, is that correct? Mr. Duelfer. Yes. Senator Coleman. Hard currency that was used to finance weapons procurement? Mr. Duelfer. Absolutely. Senator Coleman. He had influence-peddling, vouchers to politicians, vouchers to journalists who were supportive of the Iraqi cause. He had increased economic activity that you have outlined in your testimony that allowed a cover for smuggling. Smuggling included military weapons. In fact, as you have laid out in your report, he had front operations for this smuggling. And is it correct to say that some of those front operations had Oil-for-Food contracts? Mr. Duelfer. Yes, that is true. Senator Coleman. So they could be profitable by Oil-by-Food at the same time they were involved in smuggling of weapons? Mr. Duelfer. That is true. Senator Coleman. And then the Oil-for-Food--I will move on. If I can, in your report, I want to get to some of the individuals who benefited from the vouchers, one in particular. You indicate that Benon Sevan got 13 million barrels. He was the Executive Director of the Oil-for-Food Program, is that correct? Mr. Duelfer. That is correct. What we are reporting simply is what the Iraqis--their own data showed, because again we were not investigating the UN. We were simply reporting what the Iraqi data itself showed. Senator Coleman. And when you say their data, what are you talking about? Mr. Duelfer. Their listings of the oil vouchers and who got them. Senator Coleman. And the way the oil vouchers work is if you had an oil voucher, you, in fact, could sell it to a legitimate oil trader and you would get a commission. In other words, the price set by the UN for oil was below market price, so you could go to a legitimate oil trader and get a percentage commission, and you could still sell it to somebody at below cost of what the world price for oil was. Is that correct? Mr. Duelfer. That is correct. I mean, the voucher had monetary value. You don't have to exercise it yourself. Senator Coleman. And we are talking about tens of thousands, and perhaps in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars that individual could profit from having these vouchers? Mr. Duelfer. It obviously depended on the number of barrels that the voucher was for and the price discount, but they tended to be between 10 and 30 cents per barrel discounts, or profit that you could make off of it, which would mean each voucher was a substantial amount of money. Senator Coleman. Now, you indicated in your report that Vladimir Zhirinovsky and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia received 53 million barrels of oil. Now, that is one of the largest parties in the Duma? Mr. Duelfer. Ask me a question about Iraq. I will feel more comfortable. Senator Coleman. A lot of money you can make from 50 million barrels of oil, though. Mr. Duelfer. It is, but again that is the Iraqi data. I can't tell you for sure that---- Senator Coleman. You found Iraqi data indicating that Zhirinovsky has got 53 million barrels. Do you know if Zhirinovsky is a known Iraqi sympathizer? Do you have any information about him? Mr. Duelfer. Well, what I can tell you is what the Iraqis thought, and the Iraqis were quite pleased when he came and visited Baghdad. I mean, they saw him as a favorable influence. Senator Coleman. Was it also correct--and I don't have a name here--that among those listed in Iraqi data as getting these vouchers were the son of a Russian ambassador to Iraq? Mr. Duelfer. That was listed in their listing of oil vouchers. That is correct. Senator Coleman. Russian presidential office? Mr. Duelfer. That is correct. Senator Coleman. Russian foreign ministry, no name? Mr. Duelfer. Yes, that is correct. Senator Coleman. Ukraine Communist Party? Mr. Duelfer. Yes. Senator Coleman. In France, Iraqi-French Friendship Society? Mr. Duelfer. This is as they are listed in the Iraqi document. Senator Coleman. Mr. Charles Pasqua, a former interior minister of France? Mr. Duelfer. As listed by the Iraqis, that is true. Senator Coleman. Syrian journalist Hamidah Na'na, author of a biography of former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz? Mr. Duelfer. I didn't know the latter part of that, but I will take your word for it. Senator Coleman. There was a Samir Vincent, apparently a U.S. citizen--Samir Vincent. Mr. Duelfer. That was on the list. Senator Coleman. Do we know whether any organizations with specific terrorist ties were included as getting vouchers, such as Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine? Mr. Duelfer. I don't know off the top of my head. We looked at that question and to the extent--I don't know how thoroughly we could--we didn't go into every possible path, but we didn't see anything obvious. Senator Coleman. I have a lot more to discuss with Mr. Duelfer, but would like to note the presence of Senator Graham, from South Carolina, who is not a Member of this Subcommittee. Senator Graham, I do want to welcome you here today and give you the opportunity later to make a statement for the record, and certainly participate in the hearing. Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Coleman. I will defer any further questions perhaps to the next round and go to the Subcommittee's Ranking Member, Senator Levin. Senator Levin. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Duelfer, your report discusses the tactics which were used by Saddam Hussein to undermine UN sanctions on Iraq, including selling oil to his neighbors under the so-called trade protocols, and then offering oil vouchers and contracts under the Oil-for-Food Program to win favors from recipients-- two different streams of illicit income, as you have pointed out in your report. Why was Saddam trying to undermine the UN sanctions? Mr. Duelfer. Well, I mean they were the largest constraint on his freedom of movement and in achieving what he envisioned as his grand future. Senator Levin. Did they constrain his ability to rebuild his military? Mr. Duelfer. They constrained his ability to do almost everything, but, of course, including the military. Senator Levin. When Secretary Powell testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that those sanctions then had been successful, at least to that degree or in that sense that they constrained him from rebuilding his military--as he put it, the sanctions regime kept him pretty much in check--do you agree with Secretary Powell? Mr. Duelfer. Well, that is a judgment beyond, I think, what we were looking at because to determine whether sanctions are successful or unsuccessful is a very broad question because the sanctions have effects far beyond just limiting WMD or limiting conventional military. And, I think it is a vital question, it is an important debate, but it is much broader than the context of this report. Senator Levin. Let's go back, then, to your testimony and your report. A number of times in your report you indicate that the sanctions were truly biting on Saddam and that his major goal, besides his own survival, was to get rid of those sanctions. Is that correct? Mr. Duelfer. That is true. Senator Levin. Weren't they then useful at least to that extent that they---- Mr. Duelfer. That became clear in 1991 that his highest priority, aside from survival, was to figure out a way of getting rid of the sanctions. Senator Levin. And the fact that he couldn't get rid of the sanctions, does that not lead anyone reasonably to the conclusion that those sanctions were useful? Mr. Duelfer. Well, the report again tries to not look at just a static point in time, and this is where the trends, and so forth, are important and we tried to identify the trends. And, certainly, the sanctions were in place up until OIF. Senator Levin. You discuss a number of sources of illicit income for Hussein during that sanctions period, including now the trade protocol funds, which were those sales agreements that he had with a number of neighboring countries which were open. Is that correct? Mr. Duelfer. That is correct. Senator Levin. And they produced the bulk of his illicit income, did they not? Mr. Duelfer. Certainly, they provided most of the revenues, as the charts have indicated, and the Jordanian one provided the most because that started the soonest. Senator Levin. Those are your numbers, I believe. Mr. Duelfer. Correct. Senator Levin. Looking at that chart \\1\\ and adding up your numbers, then, would you conclude that the blue [Trade Protocols] represents the bulk of his illicit income? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ See Exhibit No. 32, which appears in the Appendix on page 175. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mr. Duelfer. Yes, that is correct. Senator Levin. Now, he openly entered into those agreements and the UN, including the United States, acquiesced in those agreements, did they not? Mr. Duelfer. Well, I don't know whether they formally said they are OK. They took note of them, particularly the Jordanian one in 1991. I am not sure that anybody ever said, oh, that is OK. I suspect far from that. Senator Levin. But we ignored them, didn't we? Mr. Duelfer. Well, I am not---- Senator Levin. We allowed them to happen? Mr. Duelfer. I am not in a position to answer that. I am not sure about the exchanges which went on. Senator Levin. Well, let me then tell you what the law was. The law was that in order to maintain our aid agreements or our aid activities with Jordan and with Turkey that the President, whether it was President Clinton or President Bush, would have to sign a waiver. And they signed a waiver saying that they knew that these deals between Iraq and Turkey and Iraq and Jordan occurred. Nonetheless, despite those deals and despite the fact that they provided the bulk of his illicit income, they said continue the aid. Is that not correct? Are you aware of that fact? Mr. Duelfer. I am aware of it, sir. But, again my line of inquiry is focused on Iraq. Senator Levin. But you were with UNSCOM at that point? Mr. Duelfer. I was in UNSCOM, yes. Senator Levin. Did you bring to the attention of the U.S. Government that why are you not putting pressure on countries which are getting around the sanction program? Why are you continuing to waive any action against countries that are producing the bulk of his illicit income? Did you ever express that opinion to the U.S. Government? Mr. Duelfer. Sir, I was working at the United Nations at that time, and so that wasn't my job. Senator Levin. Did you express it to the United Nations? Mr. Duelfer. No, because, again we were looking for weapons of mass destruction at that point. I mean, it is a very legitimate point that you are making, but that was not my position. Senator Levin. There are two exhibits, 33 and 34, Mr. Chairman, that I would ask be made part of the record at this point.\\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ See Exhibits No. 33 and 34, which appear in the Appendix on pages 176 and 181. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Senator Coleman. Without objection Senator Levin. These are the waivers that both President Clinton and President Bush's Administration filed with the Congress that were required if we were going to continue our aid programs to both Turkey and to Jordan, and indicating explicit awareness of the fact that these activities, in violation of the sanctions program, were going on. For instance, the first exhibit (Exhibit No. 34) which is dated October 18, 2002, to then-Chairman Biden of the Foreign Relations Committee, signed by the State Department, says on page 4, ``Despite UNSC [U.N. Security Council] resolutions banning Iraqi oil imports (except under the terms of `oil-for- food' resolutions . . . Jordan has continued since 1991 to import oil from Iraq. The UN Sanctions Committee, with USG [U.S. Government] support, has `taken note of' Jordan's imports of Iraqi oil and its lack of economically viable alternatives. That said, we have consistently urged Jordan to seek alternative energy sources.'' So other than urging Jordan to look for other energy sources, we were very well aware of the fact that they were buying Iraqi oil in violation of the UN sanctions program. Is that correct? Mr. Duelfer. Sir, that is not my mandate. Senator Levin. I understand, but is that correct? Did I read that correctly? Mr. Duelfer. Yes. Senator Levin. And the vouchers, which is a different issue because here, under the Oil-for-Food Program, the UN allowed the sale of Iraqi oil to other entities, individuals and countries--they had to be reported, but Saddam was allowed to pick and choose who would get those vouchers. Is that correct? Mr. Duelfer. That is correct. Senator Levin. And it is your estimate that those vouchers and kickbacks produced about how much money? Mr. Duelfer. Well, the $1.5 billion. I mean, that is an estimate. Senator Levin. That is your estimate? Mr. Duelfer. Correct. Senator Levin. And your estimate is that that money then was a clear violation of UN law, UN regulations, because there was no provision in the Oil-for-Food Program that anybody would get a kickback. Is that correct? Mr. Duelfer. That is right, and largely the methodology there was it was based on discussions with Iraqis in specific cases and we averaged it out to about 10 percent the value of a contract, was what they had to kick back to get the contract. Senator Levin. That is your estimate. Now, you have an Annex B on your report which lists all of the voucher recipients, and I don't know how many thousands of--do you know about how many there are that are on that annex? Mr. Duelfer. The number of the vouchers? Senator Levin. Yes, approximately. Mr. Duelfer. No, I'm sorry. I don't know. Senator Levin. It's in the thousands, though? Mr. Duelfer. No. I think it is hundreds. Senator Levin. In the hundreds, all right. Whatever the number is, have you---- Mr. Duelfer. It was a lot. Senator Levin [continuing]. Have you compared that--well, first of all, do you know that everybody on that list actually received a voucher or are you basing that on Iraqi documents? Mr. Duelfer. We are going by Iraqi data, and the Iraqi data tends to indicate those--and it is pretty good; they are pretty methodical about this, but who received the voucher and if a lifting actually occurred. Senator Levin. All right, but---- Mr. Duelfer. And that is reflected in those charts. Senator Levin. Right, but the chart or the annex is based on Iraqi documents. Is that correct? Mr. Duelfer. That is correct. Senator Levin. You don't know that those vouchers were received, do you? Mr. Duelfer. We did not check that, no. Senator Levin. So you don't know that those vouchers were received? You base your statements that they were allocated on Iraqi documents, but you personally, for instance, have not concluded, have you, that those---- Mr. Duelfer. I have not gone through it and checked every voucher, but clearly the SOMO data is--money appeared in banks, oil left the terminals. Senator Levin. Therefore, for instance, that that UN person who is named here, Benon Sevan---- Mr. Duelfer. We did not investigate individual cases, but certainly what happened was that vouchers were given, oil was lifted. Senator Levin. We know that, but I am just trying to be very specific because my time is up. You have in your annex a title, ``Known Oil Voucher Recipients.'' Do you know that Benon Sevan received a voucher? That is my question. Mr. Duelfer. The Iraqi firmly believe that. Senator Levin. Do you know that he did? This is your document. This isn't a document which says Iraqi documents that state the following. This is your---- Mr. Duelfer. I would conclude with high confidence from the data that the Iraqis provided from all that we saw that that happened. Senator Levin. All right, so that you have concluded based on Iraqi documents that this UN representative has---- Mr. Duelfer. I certainly did not see---- Senator Levin. I understand that, but you have concluded that he has done that, because it is a very serious allegation. And that is one of the allegations this Subcommittee is looking at and it is one of the allegations we are determined to find out if it is true, and so Kofi Annan determined to find out whether it is true. It is critically important that UN officials not receive kickbacks. We are all interested in that. And so my question is to you, have you concluded that, in fact, this person received an allocation of vouchers? That is my question to you. Mr. Duelfer. But my response, Senator, is that was not our job to investigate these individuals. Our job was to investigate the approaches that Iraq was using to use its influence and whether or not these resources were funding WMD programs. There is the Volcker Commission which is looking at this in excruciating detail. There are other investigations, such as this Subcommittee, which are going into that. I apologize, that was not our mandate to go look into these individual cases. Senator Levin. Well, except your annex says that he is a known recipient. Mr. Duelfer. We are conveying the data that we received from Iraq and when we had confidence in it, that is what we said. Senator Levin. Thank you. Senator Coleman. Thank you, Senator Levin. Senator Bennett. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR BENNETT Senator Bennett. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't have an extended line of questions here. I am impressed by the 40,000- foot view that you have of this situation, and let me just go over that so that I understand it correctly. This was a very carefully constructed program to evade UN resolutions. Is that correct? Mr. Duelfer. A lot of thought went into it and a lot of testing and response to those tests, yes. Senator Bennett. So it wasn't a haphazard, lower-level kind of bureaucratic graft going on. It was centrally controlled and directed from the highest levels in Iraq? Mr. Duelfer. Yes, it was run from the highest levels, but there was a lot of trial and error in how it evolved. Senator Bennett. But when it did evolve and got to its final status, would you describe it as a fairly well-oiled, shake-down kind of operation that ran rather smoothly? Mr. Duelfer. Parts of it went fairly regularly in terms of the Oil-for-Food and how the oil liftings were allocated, and so forth. I could not conclude that they knew that they were going to derive these benefits when they signed up for the program in December 1996. I think they discovered this as they went along. Senator Bennett. I understand that, but when it reached its maturity, it would require not only a degree of coordination and sh"
