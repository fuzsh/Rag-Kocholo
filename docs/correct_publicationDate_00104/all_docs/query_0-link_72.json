        "text": "An author is not obliged to write only books who promote his own worldview and in my humble opinion many, if not most books of that kind turned out to be badly written. As we are in sci-fi and fantasy, we are reading books which describes things which are (at least currently) not part of our world or our worldviews, so we violate this idea constantly.\n\nA strong personal Roman-Catholic believer as a good writer will have no problems to describe a fully atheistic society as a complete atheist is capable to create a world with functioning gods. While you may get the personal view of a writer by reading his books, this is by no means sufficient to get insight into personal beliefs.\n\nThe second problem is that people may have personal religious views which are non-standard and it can be very tiring if both atheists and supporter of widely known religions try to fit someone in their preconceived compartments. Arthur C. Clarke has called himself \"Pantheist\", \"Crypto-buddhist\" and \"atheist\", so this indicates that he had a much more complex worldview. Your argument depends on the assertion that he must be a strong atheist and in context this conclusion is not fully supported.\n\nIf you as a Unitarian, Deist or Pan(en)theist experience that atheists call you believer and believers call you atheist, quote you out of context to support their beliefs what you are, insinuate that you are not really a XXXist, but a crypto whatevernaughty and worse of all, trying to convert you....than you may be stop talking about religion or call yourself a \"Pagan\" or \"Jedi\".\n\nThe answer already given touches on whether what an author writes, is the same as what an author believes.\n\nHowever, in the specific case of the Rama series, after the first book, it's not so much Arthur C. Clarke writing as it is Gentry Lee. Especially the last of the series, Rama Revealed, was written by Gentry Lee, with Arthur C. Clarke only consulting.\n\nAs the Wikipedia article on Gentry Lee reads:\n\nRendezvous With Rama was written in 1972 and Clarke had no intention of writing a sequel. Lee attempted to turn the Rama series into a more character-driven story following the adventures of Nicole des Jardins Wakefield, who becomes the main character in Rama II, The Garden of Rama and Rama Revealed. When asked, Arthur C. Clarke said that Gentry Lee did the writing while he was a source of ideas.\n\nThe source for that seems to be an interview with Arthur C. Clarke by Sci-Fi.com, which can be found on the Internet Archive.\n\nAnother important influence on my life, of course, has been Gentry Lee, who was introduced to me by Peter Guber, who wanted to make a film based on Gentry's ideas. It was never filmed, but it led to the novel, Cradle, which was based on our joint ideas but almost entirely written by Gentry. Since then Gentry has collaborated on Rama II and The Garden of Rama, and Rama Revealed, which was written virtually entirely by him, though with consultation with me. I've described our collaboration in the preface, \"Co-Authors and Other Nuisances,\" I think in Rama II.\n\nI have read them all and I see no relation to religion in any of it. Unless... You take the Neolithic ideal that any form of life on a higher order than ones self is a god. If you do then this means we are gods to all creatures who are of lower form than we which would only prove the non-existence of a creature believed to be god and would show the arrogance of man by thinking itself on a higher order than an ameba.\n\nWe are no more a higher order than an ant is over a microbe. We are simply a different living creature operating and living differently than other creatures around us."
