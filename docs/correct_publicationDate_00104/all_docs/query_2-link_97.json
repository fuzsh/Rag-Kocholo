        "text": "Sir Arthur C. Clarke (1917-2008) was an English author of hard science fiction as well as an inventor and futurist.

Clarke published his first short story in 1937, Travel by Wire!. His first novel, Against the Fall of Night was published in 1948. It would later be revised as The City and the Stars.
