        "text": "July 5, 2015\n\nAbsolutely the worst book I've ever read in my entire life. Arthur C. Clarke is my favorite Science Fiction writer. He partnered with Gentry Lee on some of the Rama books, (in retrospect) to develop the characters in Rama. I loved the Rama series. Since this was a continuation of Rama, I had high hopes. Some spoilers, so don't read further if you don't want to know. The book sets a plot of good defeating evil all the way up to the end, and then the bad guy wins, the good guy loses, and the girl dies. Not just any girl, but a futuristic Nun who helps pretty much the whole world and is the sweetest and most kind person ever. The hero is ultimately emasculated to wear an alien bra to breast feed the baby of the dead mother (Nun Pun), a baby sired by the evil Muslim rapist father, all while hopelessly trapped on an island inside a space ship, which is itself one giant bad acid trip. Seriously, WTF? Science fiction is an existential metaphor that allows us to tell stories about the human condition. It's supposed to help us imagine other possibilities and a better tomorrow. I get what Gentry Lee was trying to do, especially as a setup for the next book and the metaphysical fantasy both books embrace (I didn't read the 2nd one). If I wanted a big dose of life-sucks with a disappointing ending, I would just read the Bible.\n\nJune 6, 2016\n\nThis is not a good book. The cover proclaims that it is \"set in the Rama Universe\" which itself is hardly much of an incentive for readers, since the Rama sequels were borderline insufferable. Yet, even for those that may have been fans of those books, Bright Messengers lives to disappoint. It may set in the Rama universe technically, but its actual connection to any of the events of the Rama series is limited to a few passing references. It reads like a different sci-fi story (albeit one suspiciously similar to the Rama plot) that had a few allusions to Rama tossed in the hopes of selling a handful more copies.\n\nThe characters across the board fit into the \"insanely good and virtuous person\" or \"human representation of pure evil\" categories. I would say it is comic-book level characterization, except comic books have come a long way in their literary value, and I don't wish to denigrate them. Maybe it is more like the novelization of some Vin Diesel starring sci-fi film.\n\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, the book is bifurcated into two halves which seem to have little to do with each other. It doesn't matter. Neither half is engaging.\n\nAnd--as my brother pointed out to me the day I bought the book from a used bookstore--the cover is a transparent rip-off of the Death Star. Take a look at it. He's right.\n\nJuly 19, 2016\n\nThis book starts off back in time approximately fourteen years or so after the events of the first Rama book. Earth's economy is collapsing. The colony on Mars is being left to fend for itself. Abandoned to the point the planetary prison is overrun and the inmates create their own wild west out of what's left. While this is happening some certain people on both planets experience extraterrestrial event, some describing them as angels or angelic visitations.\n\nOn a small outpost near the Martian ice cap where ice is mined for water several of these people are brought together of course you can't have a story so one is conveniently recruited (before the breakout) from the prison because although he's scum out of your worst nightmare he's also a mechanical genius. A scientific expedition is lost, one body recovered. Her records are so fantastic that the skeletal crew must investigate. Proof of alien intelligence,perhaps surpassing Rama are found.\n\nA global sandstorm of catastrophic nature is heading for the outpost. Of course the main characters and of course the villain, can't leave him behind, plus a few others (but not all, we never hear about anyone else)are rescued and then begins a long 'can't you see it's god not aliens or aliens doing god's work?' augment. Somehow the aliens have saved or replayed some of Earth's worst moments and plays them for two special characters (the others we hear unbelievable stories about but never see anyone but the villain again) the first nuclear weapons used, Nazi atrocities, American atrocities to the native peoples. I know this review is rambling but that's how the story goes and makes me feel. Too much religion for science fiction not enough answers for good science fiction. I wonder if this is why Clarke took a hands-off approach with this novel. It opened foreshadowing into story lines we've already read in earlier book in this series. Too many unanswered questions too much god. I read it, I can't say it's a favorite though it wasn't horrible and in the end I did finish it.\n\nOne more novel to go. I hope it makes more sense.\n\nJuly 31, 2009\n\nI tend to go easy on Gentry Lee. He gets beat up by many sci-fi fans, and not without some cause. Unlike many ‘great’ authors, Lee is not adept at concealing that each of his books is built around one basic storyline that he keeps adapting to different characters and settings.\n\nOne of this novel’s strong points is offering a glimpse at what a colonized Mars might look like. And coming from the boys club of engineers, Gentry Lee is inclined to give us a world where gritty people work hard, swear a lot, and then go out to drink and have sex with the same gusto. Many sci-fi fans don’t go for this, although it’s almost certainly what settlements in space will be like. Guess what? It’s what Earth is like.\n\nStill, there’s not much in this novel that feels new or innovating. We’ve seen the broad strokes before in Gentry Lee and Arthur C. Clarke’s Rama trilogy. And those, as much as I love them, aren’t literary masterpieces either.\n\nSeptember 27, 2007\n\nGentry Lee does the enigmatic aliens/wow-factor thing quite well on his own, without Mr. Clarke on board. If you enjoyed the Rama stories, you'll enjoy this too.\n\nMarch 5, 2009\n\nExcellent Clarke based scifi read. Stimulating and imaginitive. What happened to dreaming of science and space? Oh yeah, TV.\n\nJuly 13, 2017\n\nIt takes place in space, yet the characters are so one dimensional. I'll read the sequel for sake of completion, but this was a big letdown from the Rama series.\n\nApril 20, 2020\n\n2.5 stars. Slow start to the book. There's character-building, then there's going on too long about things that just don't seem to matter to the plot of the book. But, hey, once that's past, the book charges ahead into mediocrity! Being on Mars was a bit more interesting, and getting to the space ship was a step in the right direction, but we've already had the previous books for the exploring the mysterious space ship theme before. The final part of the book could have taken place anywhere and isn't much in the way of science fiction. The writing was fine, the subject matter lacked. Overall, disappointing but I'll read the next as the book just ends without ending.\n\nOctober 30, 2017\n\nJust like the \"new Rama\" series before, \"Bright Messengers\" and \"Double Full Moon Light\" are actually one longer book split in two for publication purposes, so this review will be the same for both.\n\nI was a big fan of the \"remastered\" Rama series, so I had at least modest expectations from these two novels. Unfortunately, I couldn't be more disappointed. The setting is pretty much the same, but the characters are supremely annoying, and the plot is one huge chunk of cheese. I was rolling my eyes every other page. I managed to get through the first book in hopes that the second will improve the situation. Fat chance of that happening.\n\nNot a horrible series, but one to avoid, for sure.\n\nJune 10, 2020\n\nSimilar to the other Rama books, but an entirely new set of characters and adventures. A good story line but some really bad things happen. The end is good (I was still annoyed by some other parts of the story) but it is a cliffhanger so you will need to follow it up in DOUBLE FULL MOON NIGHT. Definitely worth a read for RAMA lovers.\n\nFebruary 25, 2021\n\nAwful book that emphasizes God is fine with rape babies; women truly are subservient and lack critical thinking, and God only cares about women for reproduction. The bad guy wins and his warped morality is utterly proven in line with \"God's\" will. If your religion believes women are objects and raping is acceptable, even promoted by god and rewarding, this is the book for you.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nNovember 1, 2019\n\nToo much exposition. Almost all of the action is telegraphed way on advance and there's no dramatic tension. This book is half of the story and the author explicitly states that it will be finished with Double Full Moon Night. I'm not going to bother reading it.\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n+ fast reading, cant put away\n\n+ Strong characters, good dialogues\n\n+ Mystery\n\n- Holes in the story, unknown what happens to some people\n\n- no dragons\n\nOctober 13, 2018\n\nSome people disparage Gentry Lee's Rama-based work, but I say, if ii is good enough for Arthur C. Clarke, it's good enough for me. I quite enjoyed this book and look forward to more.\n\nDecember 29, 2021\n\nHorrible. Absoutely Horrible. I was excited for another Rama book, but this was a ridiculous waste of time.\n\nJuly 2, 2024\n\nThis is a science fiction novel??? It reads more like what one might find in a romance novel. Dr. Lee is no doubt a brilliant scientist, but Arthur C. Clarke he is not. A pathetic offering…\n\nAugust 31, 2017\n\nWhen I saw this book was \"set in the Rama universe\", I was very excited to read it. I loved the Rama books and really wanted to continue in that same world. I was quite disappointed in the relation to the Rama books...it mentions the Rama spacecraft a few times, and there is a group of people called The Rama Society...but that's about all the connection there is.\n\nI went through about half of the book waiting for some major connection to appear, but it never came.\n\nI also feel that the first half of the book felt very disconnected from the second half. When I finished the book, I went back and looked at some of the first half, and I had completelt forgotten it was the same book I had just finished.\n\nWith that said, I did enjoy the second half of the novel...but was somewhat disappointed in how it ended. Part of that is probably because I didnt realize it was only the first book of 2 in the story when I started reading it.\n\nNot sure if I'm going to read the second installment or not...I wasn't left wanting more or wanting to really find out \"what's next\" at the end...so we'll see if I get around to reading the next one anytime soon...\n\nMarch 19, 2014\n\nGreat Book set in the Rama Universe. If you like the how the story is told in the Rama series, this book (two actually) continues in the same manner. These two books actually ties up a loose end in the originally Rama series but still is not needed for the story. I like it because I loved the Rama series. However, if you didn't I would skip these two (Bright Messengers and Double Full Moon Night).\n\nAugust 17, 2015\n\nIt was several years ago when I finished this book. I do not wish to give away much of its content, I agree with some of the other reviewers that it did mention the Rama Universe but barely mentioned Rama. This was likely just to sale the book.\n\nI will say one thing. It and Double Full Moon Nights (the sequel) are a good series. The actual Rama series with Arthur C Clarke and Gentry Lee is better. The date when I finished this book is just a guess. I have not that much memory.\n\nOctober 18, 2016\n\nNot a bad addition to the Rama \"quadrilogy\" as a book that is \"set in the Rama Universe\" but it's a very difficult read. I've no problem with sex in books, but in my opinion Gentry has some sort of serious abuse/sex hangup. Starts off very slow (for the first 40%) picks up becomes enjoyable...and then he takes it to a very \"dark\" place. Don't think it's worth it. Started the second (\"6th\") and final book now...ugh...I kind of dread what I'm about to read next.\n\nJuly 5, 2017\n\nI got this for free in a pile of books given to me by a friend. It's okay. Rather predictable. Nowhere near as engaging as the Rama books which this and its sequel are an off-shoot of but it kept me interested to the end. I'm not sure if I want to read the sequel, Double Full Moon Night. It's not really calliing my name.\n\nDecember 15, 2009\n\nI believe Gentry Lee is the brainchild behind the Rama saga (the plots are much more elaborate than the original Rendevous with Rama by Clarke).\n\nwhat happened to Gentry Lee? have not seen any new offering from him for quite some time. Could it be the big D?\n\nMarch 14, 2019\n\nTo nadal Rama - ale czuć brak Artura C Clarke. Nie chodzi mi o to, że książka jest słaba - wręcz przeciwnie - jest bardzo dobra. Ale zniknął gdzieś ten duch autora. To jak z uniwersum Metro2033 - każdy autor rysuje swe historie odmiennie. Tu mamy w miniaturce ten sam efekt.\n\nApril 15, 2010\n\nAn interesting tale that test your humanity. Not really my thing though.. especially after the heroine dies. This one goes bye-bye."
