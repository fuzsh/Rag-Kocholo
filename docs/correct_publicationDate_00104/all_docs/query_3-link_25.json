        "text": "Title: Rama II and The Garden of Rama\n\nAuthor: Arthur C. Clarke (theoretically) and Gentry Lee\n\nMedia: Literature\n\nTopic: Rendezvous with Rama\n\nGenre: Sci-Fi\n\nURL: They are actual printed books that you have to actually buy.\n\nCritiqued by AdmiralSakai\n\nAs Mass Effect The First War continues to drag on to an uncertain conclusion, I’ve decided I’ll be taking a break every five or so chapters to keep things interesting around here. Normally I’ll be riffing oneshots or fanart or doing goodfic recommendations during these interludes, but there’s something else I’ve been meaning to look at for a good long while now that, while it falls under LotD’s general umbrella of “really terrible writing based on a pre-existing canon”, is not technically fanfiction. Think of this as similar in a lot of ways to Bats’s comic retrospectives, although really it probably is closer to just plain fanfiction that somehow got published alongside the original source material.\n\nPlease be aware that I have blacked out spoilers for the original work here, although those are mostly confined to the summary of said original work since the sequels have precious little to do with its mythology.\n\nArthur C. Clarke’s 1972 Rendezvous with Rama is an absolute classic and generally shows up high on lists of the greatest pieces of science fiction of all time. It involves an asteroid-defense system picking up a large object (code-named the titular ‘Rama’) entering the solar system which is determined to be artificial in origin. A team of astronauts is hastily assembled to board the thing, and most of the book is taken up with their explorations of the interior before Rama passes dangerously close to the sun and they have to abandon it.\n\nIt’s a very simple story but it works very well because of just how many layers of mystery are wrapped around Rama and how utterly strange the device is. The astronauts themselves don’t really have a lot of character dedicated to them and don’t really get into complicated interactions with each other, nor is Rama itself actively threatening in any way, but it’s immense and utterly alien in its construction; and since the astronauts can only stay there for a limited time and couldn’t on such short notice bring all the equipment they needed to fully explore the place there’s a very real sense of tension to every effort they make to learn as much as possible. As such, they’re a rare example of a ‘blank-slate’ protagonist done right, since they essentially serve as the reader’s eyes and ears to solve this mystery without having too much of their own agenda to distract from that.\n\nThey end up learning a bit about the mechanics of Rama’s function and even find what appears to be storage for clothing and tools to be used by its presumable inhabitants, but no real information about who built it or why, although the book does end with a very obvious sequel hook. The architects of Rama had a weird emphasis on threefold redundancy in the physical construction of the object, leading to the very last sentence being “The Ramans did everything in threes” and the obvious implication that two more objects may soon be inbound.\n\nI am focusing on the first two sequel books, Rama II (oh, wow, how original) and The Garden of Rama (oh, wow, how pretentious). There are a metric crapton more of the things (a total of six, in fact) but those are the two I was able to read before throwing the last one in disgust; I really could not bring myself to read any more on my own although I suppose I might liveblog them at some point or something. All of them are ‘co-written’ by Clarke and some dude named Gentry Lee who as near as I can tell has done diddly-squat else in terms of literature although he was an engineer involved with the Galileo space probes and has been featured in a number of space documentaries. That’s probably for the best, because writing is not his thing.\n\nApparently Lee did most of the actual writing and Clarke’s name is on the books just because he came up with the original concept so, yeah, as far as I’m concerned this is just Lee’s Rama fanfiction which somehow managed to get officially published alongside Clarke’s actual works.\n\nRama II– Synopsis\n\nRama II starts out a lot like the original and shares the same basic premise. Another Rama object is indeed detected in the solar system, and another exploration team is sent to it to pick up where the first left off. One would think that, having some idea of what to expect inside the thing in terms of navigating it and a chance to bring more equipment they would be able to make significantly more headway. In contrast to the trained professionals in Rendezvous who are able to focus on their very important job despite having been thrust into it unexpectedly, however, this purpose-built Rama Contingency Team is a bunch of undisciplined nitwits with dubious qualifications who spend most of their time bickering with each other and is also smaller in manpower than the original (what the fuck?). Highlights include:\n\nThe primary POV character and medial officer, Nicole des Jardins.\n\nSome engineer named Andrew Wakefield.\n\nSome other engineer named Dr. Brown.\n\nGeneral O’Toole, a Catholic follower of Catholicism who is Catholic and commands some kind of dedicated military presence that I cannot for the life of me remember.\n\nAn Italian news reporter lady who is boffing Dr. Brown and planning… something.\n\nSome Japanese guy who is an expert on the first Rama expedition (one would think all of the expedition would be briefed on this backward and forward), who is actually ineligible to be on a front-line expedition like this due to a heart condition but somehow faked his medical exam.\n\nA few what are basically NPCs.\n\nThe big problem now is that the second Rama appears to be heading directly for Earth, so the exploration team is sent with a nuke and, if they cannot discover evidence that the thing will turn itself, have orders to blow it up as they leave.\n\nTheir work is also hindered by the fact that while the original Rama was effectively uninhabited (there are organic robots onboard manufactured by the station itself, but they’re effectively mindless and only perform simple tasks) this one is eventually discovered to have living, apparently intelligent creatures inhabiting its interstices- some kind of birds and also giant yellow-and-black tarantula-like things the team calls “octospiders”. I always thought that name was given because they had eight legs, and only when I was writing this retrospective did I consciously remember that regular spiders already have eight legs. Maybe it’s derived from ‘octopus’, but their limbs are described as segmented and they live on land so the eight legs are the only commonality there too.\n\nMost of the first half of the story is taken up with the characters bickering over whether or not to leave the nuke (in a complete absence of any actual serious investigation of Rama’s systems to try to gain more information), Des Jardins bickering with Japanese Guy about his hiding his condition, Dr. Brown and Italian Lady bickering with each other over relationship problems, and very cursory efforts to locate and learn more about the octospiders.\n\nJapanese Guy wanders off on his own and dies (it is unclear if his heart condition killed him or the octospiders did; his body is later found in an octospider-controlled area but they could just as easily found it after the fact and brought it back for study). Des Jardins and Andrew Wakefield get themselves stranded in a closed-off part of the station due to a combination of contrivance and their own incompetence crashing the aircraft the expedition team brought along, and wander around there for a while while falling in wuuuuuv. Des Jardins starts getting these weird visions that feature her dead mother and help her navigate the station, because that‘s always a great thing to include in your hard-science-fiction story. It’s also worth noting that Des Jardins is the only one who ever does this and is also the only crew member of otherwise-unspecified African descent.\n\nAt least she’s not Amerindian, I guess?\n\nItalian Lady is set up as a primary villain (because, in a series entirely focused on exploration and understanding the alien, we totally needed one of those) but it is unclear how she actually negatively impacted the mission or for that matter what she even wants other than being one of the main advocates for the nuclear option. We are treated to a flashback of how she got into the TV news business by seducing some elderly media baron when she was in her mid-teens, though. Thanks, story- we all really needed to see that.\n\nSo as Des Jardins and Wakefield are still trying to make their way back to the human camp, Rama passes the point of no return and the rest of the explorers have to bug out and leave the nuke behind them. They can’t actually arm the nuke because it requires the authorization of a certain percentage of the senior staff and the removal of Des Jardins, Wakefield, and Japanese Guy has put them below the quorum limit (one would think that if this new Rama turned out to be super-hostile and incapacitated most of the team you’d want the nuke to be easier to set off, but whatever. Actually, now that I think about it, why does the medical officer have a say in this at all?). Once they’re back, the two lovebirds see Rama’s engines fire up and decide it won’t hit Earth at all and there is no need for the nukes.\n\nOf course they’re still stuck on the thing, although it’s revealed that there is an area in the underlevels seemingly set up to be inhabitable by humans with controls for a replicator and also General O’toole stayed behind with them. Also Des Jardins is pregnant with Wakefield’s kid (the contraceptives they were given just… I guess… didn’t work), so O’Toole marries them and I guess this is supposed to be a happy ending even though they’re still three people stuck in an utterly alien environment that killed another guy and they don’t even know how to make food and they have no way of ever returning to Earth and one of them now has a kid to worry about that she wants to keep for some incomprehensible reason.\n\nRama II– Analysis\n\nRama II is like a shitty, watered-down version of Rendezvous in nearly every way. It has the same basic plot of ‘get in, see what you can see, get out before this place goes poof’, but there is less exploration in order to make room for a bunch of pointless soap-opera nonsense with characters we have no reason to like. A bunch of these plot threads don’t even really hold together or have any sort of ultimate relevance, and I don’t think that Lee realized just how bleak the ending he wrote actually was.\n\nThis being a professionally-published and -edited novel, the prose doesn’t display the ridiculous failings of basic grammar or the inhuman dialogue that we usually see in fanworks, but it’s still kind of lackluster. Rendezvous wasn’t especially lush in its description, but Clarke very effectively used what detail he allowed in order to paint a really atmospheric picture of this stark, cold, utterly alien environment; the sequels just kind of… don’t show us a lot of stuff. It doesn’t help that we spend a lot less time actually inside Rama and more on the transport ship or on Earth.\n\nRama itself has also degraded somewhat in a number of ways. Putting live aliens which are, in the grand scheme of things, not even all that alien on it makes it less of the sort of mechanical cipher it is in Rendezvous and in a way kind of distracts from the austere perfection of the place. Additionally, Clarke did an excellent job of showing and not telling when he included the builders’ focus on threefold symmetry- much like in Riven, The Sequel to Myst references to the number really do appear absolutely everywhere in Rama’s design, some obvious and some subtle, and your mind progresses right along with the astronauts’ as you realize it is significant. In the sequels, there is much less of this numerology and the architecture is more random.\n\nI also balk a little at the sequels’ decision to have some structural differences between the Rama objects. It’s unnecessary from a plot perspective because the first Rama had all sorts of areas left unexplored that could easily contain new things, it makes the alien, mathematical aesthetic the first book worked so hard to create less present with its discontinuity, and if we are being pedantic can we even say “The Ramans did everything in threes” when they sent different ships each time?\n\nDes Jardins’s visions, in light of the above, probably aren’t the absolute worst thing about Rama II, but they definitely were the first thing to jump out at me when I was reading it and the single element that makes the least sense. They are very jarring in what was previously a very hard sci-fi setting, nothing ever explains why or how they are happening, and more to the point they are also completely unnecessary. The Rendezvous astronauts were perfectly able to make more progress navigating Rama’s interior with deductions and creative kitbashing, but with more equipment and prior knowledge Des Jardins needs a hint system?? Not buying it.\n\nI think this story could have been sort of saved by cutting out a lot of the soap opera nonsense and just repeating the formula of Rendezvous, but this sort of exploration- and mystery-centric plot walks a very fine line between the need to tie off everything with actual answers, and the fact that any final revelation of what those answers actually are necessarily deflates everything that came before.\n\nSo obviously the solution to all of this was to write another sequel.\n\nThe Garden of Rama– Synopsis\n\nThe second book is where things come completely unhinged (I say, fully aware that there might be still worse and weirder things in the remaining four other sequels).\n\nWe pick back up with Des Jardins and Wakefield (and also O’toole), who if you recall from the previous book thought for some reason that it would be an excellent idea to raise a child in a potentially hostile alien environment they don’t really understand with basically no supplies and zero records of Earth and only the three of them as any form of contact. After some years(!) of living in their tiny section of Rama and apparently completely ignoring the octospiders and bird aliens that live nearby, the object docks with a kind of automated maintenance station and everyone is transferred over to it and moved to a larger area.\n\nDes Jardins has some more kids, and gets concerned about the long-term genetic viability of their descendants (which is ANOTHER reason why deciding to procreate here was a terrible idea) and decides that the solution is to have another with General O’toole. Obviously he is initially not OK with this, and several chapters are spent with Des Jardins trying to talk him into it and him getting cold feet. During one iteration of this she tries to have sex with him while he’s asleep (!!), but surprisingly he wakes up and freaks out. Eventually he comes around (so to speak) and she has another kid, who turns out to have some kind of unclear mental disability (i.e. one that was invented specifically for the story) for some reason. Then she decides that one of her daughters with Wakefield should then marry O’toole for more DNA shenanigans. She’s thirteen and O’toole is in his eighties.\n\nAll of this, by the way, isn’t even going to help in the long run because there’s still only THREE PEOPLE in the starting population and the minimum viable population for complex vertebrates like humans is generally agreed to be in the hundreds to thousands. And also their descendants are still going to be isolated from all other human life for presumably forever with not even comprehensive records of Earth’s culture.\n\nDes Jardins talks to the intelligence that runs the maintenance station and it allows her to leave the section she’s been confined to to see a large ‘hub’ area from which other sections containing other alien species are visible. Des Jardins is already not in the least bit bothered by the fact that none of them are able to leave without the AI’s say-so, and is equally unperturbed by the revelation that she and her family are being watched at all times. I don’t think she even tells any of the others.\n\nThe AI translates for another alien that looks like an eel and they talk about their respective life cycles. The eel aliens are never encountered again after that one scene and convey no actionably relevant information. I would sort of like to think the eel was just screaming “HEY! GET US OUT OF HERE! SEND HELP!!!” over and over again the whole time and the AI just made up the translation on its own.\n\nThe AI starts running experiments on all of the humans to try to figure out how to put them into suspended animation. I guess it can still gain valuable insights without actually endangering its very limited pool of human lab rats. Or maybe they just got incredibly lucky, I don’t know. It says it wants to send them back to Earth to deliver a message that another Rama ship is coming and Earth should send hundreds of people to fly back on it. Des Jardins thinks that the initial message sounds too much like a threat or at least a demand, but doesn’t amend it or anything.\n\nThey get put on the new Rama craft and put in suspended animation, although the AI decides that O’toole and his child bride (that’s the term the story itself uses, BTW, not something I am adding to be snarky) need to stay behind. Des Jardins has more visions of her kids while in stasis, and upon waking it is revealed that the process didn’t slow their aging completely and her 10-year-old daughter now has a 16-year-old body. It’s not clear whether they knew this was going to happen beforehand and did it anyway, or the stasis was supposed to work and fucked up, because Des Jardins’s response to these developments is the same as her response to everything else she saw while in the AI’s custody on the service station:\n\nSo Des Jardins gets back to Earth orbit and relays her message. The UN-on-steroids world government hems and haws for a little bit trying to figure out whether to comply with the request or not, and there’s also this weird paragraph-long subplot where China isn’t part of the world government (and is no longer Communist but operates under an economic model invented by a modern-day Catholic monk; the story never says what this economic model is) and then a united Korea agrees to leave the UN and federate with China. It goes nowhere and accomplishes nothing.\n\nEventually the UN decides not to blow the new Rama to kingdom come, as they are suitably cowed by the threatening nature of the message and don’t know the Ramans’ true offensive capabilities.\n\nRemember, the Ramans are still supposed to be the good guys in this.\n\nInstead, the UN puts out a call for volunteers from their armed forces, scientific institutes, diplomatic corps, and other elite groups to form an armed-to-the-teeth expeditionary force which will make this one-way trip, ascertain the aliens’ true intentions, and do their best to halt their plans should they prove hostile.\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\nHahaha, just kidding, they actually recruit a bunch of random civilians (including a contingent of convicted felons) by telling them they are going to a Mars colony and not revealing the truth until they are already on their way.\n\nWe follow one of the potential colonists, a historian, as he agrees to sign on to go to “Mars” and then visits the Italian reporter lady from the last book. He’s going to accuse her of… something in a book he’s writing, but she invites two fashion models to go swimming with him so he decides not to. Grand.\n\nOnce transferred to Rama and briefed on the situation, instead of doing what sensible people would do and rioting en masse to demand that they be brought back to Earth, the colonists decide to elect Nicole Des Jardins their President.\n\nNobody ever stops to think that the Ramans are probably surveilling them constantly here too.\n\nYears pass as Rama 3 makes its return trip. The colony splits itself into different ethnic enclaves and organized crime somehow develops even though in the original Rendezvous what little we saw of future Earth made it look like a Roddenberry-style utopia of complete equality and free love. Rama II claims in its intro that there was some kind of economic crash that ‘reaffirmed traditional institutions’ but I’m not buying it.\n\nPeople start dying of a type of communicable heart failure which spreads exactly like HIV because this was written in 1991 and AIDS was a thing. There is concern that emissions from the colonists’ wood-burning fires are destabilizing Rama’s life-support systems because this was written in 1991 and the ozone hole was a thing. (How many fucking wood-burning fires do these people have, anyway??)\n\nThey consider tinkering with Rama’s internal systems or at least seeing how they work and President Des Jardins shoots down all plans to do so. The humans are sectioned off from most of Rama’s volume by a partition wall and they consider trying to drill through it under controlled conditions to at least see what’s over there, and President Des Jardins shoots down all plans to do so. Her forcibly-adulted daughter starts to fall in with the Yakuza people.\n\nIn light of these developments, plus the fact that she got them into this mess against their will to begin with and her public claims to receive messages from the dead, it is thus a horrible and unfair campaign of slander against Nicole Des Jardins’s good name that makes her very unpopular.\n\nTwo female ex-convict characters are introduced so that they can talk about having sex with a lesbian drug dealer back on Earth to get discounts. They are never mentioned again.\n\nDes Jardins agrees to step down and run an election, has a vision about her preferred candidate Historian Guy getting assassinated, but is unable to prevent that from actually occurring and instead a Yakuza-aligned guy takes power. He starts to separate out the people with Space-AIDS (because when I think ‘Early 90s Christian Conservative’ I immediately think ‘Japanese Gangsters’) but really the only other thing he does that’s supposed to be bad is send Des Jardins’s disabled son to some kind of facility instead of letting him live with her and the others. In the one time we even see him we see that whatever his problem is is severe enough to prevent him from carrying on a conversation and more to the point Nicole Des Jardins is a horrible parent WHO CLAIMS TO RECEIVE SIGNALS FROM THE DEAD so I’m with the Yakuza on this one.\n\nEventually they put Des Jardins on trial for… well, basically leading them all into alien captivity under false pretenses, and her aged-up daughter comes to testify against her because she was a horrible parent who happened to screw over that particular child more than the others. She gets sentenced to death which only seems a little harsh, and Andrew Wakefield (remember him? I sure didn’t!) flees by tunneling through the barrier. He ends up in a habitat populated by the bird aliens and explores their civilization for a little while, in a section that is actually sort of readable science fiction.\n\nBut then we’re back to the colony, which has instigated a draft which in turn has picked up some of Des Jardins’s other kids. I can sort of see why they did this, actually, since they’re in this completely unfamiliar and potentially hostile environment and don’t even know where they’re going and really everyone sent here should have already been trained soldiers or dedicated support personnel to begin with. It is odd, though, that the draft is stated to only apply to males when the original Rendezvous featured female personnel on the original paramilitary expedition force. In 1972, nineteen years before Garden was written. Also, “Everybody doing their part, working day and night to keep up the fight.” is another thing I immediately think of when I hear “the government has been taken over by organized crime”.\n\nSo the human military gets across the barrier in force and starts fighting the bird aliens. Great work there, Mr. Wakefield.\n\nThe book finally ends with Wakefield bumping into a group of human soldiers for the first time and Nicole Des Jardins getting executed. She has one last vision that’s a kind of a fly-over of the whole area featuring all of her kids, and then we hear a kind of transmission being sent back to the refitting station from the Rama ship that basically says “things are shit”.\n\nNo, DUH.\n\nThe Garden of Rama– Analysis\n\nThis is terrible.\n\nAll of the problems that were present in Rama II are present in Garden, and all of them are worse. In II the lack of description and decreased numerology was less obvious because we were still on a Rama craft and could kind of crutch off Rendezvous‘s own descriptions, but now that we’re in completely new areas like the refit station it’s painfully obvious that Clarke’s prose just isn’t there. The sense of mystery and exploration is completely gone now for any number of reasons, partially because due to the above issues with description there is only Formless Void left to explore and partially because now we’re carrying on conversations with the mysterious architects of Rama and it turns out they are just regular garden-variety assholes.\n\nExcept all the human characters are also assholes, or at least the only one the narrative seems to have any interest in is. We spend the first third of the story watching Nicole Des Jardins micromanage the sex lives of her fellow passengers in a vain attempt to start some kind of splinter human population in an environment that’s really not habitable long-term by humans, the second watching her collaborate with a crazy AI to shanghai a bunch of other humans into what is essentially a massive zoo, and the final third watching her confused and ineffective governance convince the people she shanghai’d to turn to Yakuza fascists as a preferable alternative.\n\nNicole Des Jardins is Thorax with Freudian baggage.\n\nNot only is all of this nonsense completely unrelated to, you know, exploring Rama, but it’s not even good on its own. Its attempts to tackle social issues are preachy, oversimplified, and manage to come across both as more dated and less progressive than a book written nineteen years prior which didn’t even try to make political statements. It’s like the unholy fusion of a poorly-written ‘issues’ Star Trek episode, an after-school special, and a bad Tom Friedman op-ed. It’s a disaster in basically every way, and I think you’ll forgive me for deciding to abandon the series when I did.\n\nAs a bit of a footnote, there was actually a Rama game released a while back, which is a Myst-type puzzle-adventure game. I’d say that’s exactly the right genre for the Rama series, but……….. it includes all of the idiotic characters from the sequels, doing their idiotic drama, and ends with your POV character stuck on the departing Rama spacecraft alongside O’toole, Wakefield, and the Mad Shipper herself. Yikes!\n\nSo I think I can give the Gentry Lee Rama sequels the simultaneously highest and lowest honor that can be given to a badfic- having actually tainted the source material itself.\n\n…\n\nI wonder if there’s, like actual Rama fanfiction by actual random internet people on ff.net.\n\nI wonder if it’s better or worse than the official sequels.\n\nI wonder if there is octospider porn?"
