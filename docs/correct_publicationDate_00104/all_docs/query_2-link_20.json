        "text": "For the Thai king, see Rama II.\n\n1989 novel by Arthur C. Clarke and Gentry Lee\n\nRama II is a science fiction novel by Gentry Lee and Arthur C. Clarke, first published in 1989. It recounts humankind's further interaction with the Ramans, first introduced in Rendezvous with Rama. Written primarily by Lee,[1] Rama II has a distinctly different writing style than the original, with a more character-driven narrative and a closer-to-contemporary mindset, ambience and human relations than the first novel's more futuristic tones. Rama II is the first novel of the \"new\" Rama series, as Rendezvous with Rama is not always counted as part of it. The Rama series includes two more sequels: The Garden of Rama and Rama Revealed.\n\nSeventy years after the events of Rendezvous with Rama, a second Raman vessel enters the Solar System. Its arrival is expected, and on Earth the chosen crew of twelve readies for the voyage to unlock more of Rama's mysteries. Interpersonal conflicts among crew members begin prior to the launch date.\n\nAfter arriving, an accident kills the leader of the group while still outside Rama, and there is debate over who the replacement should be. The tools and vehicles the crew bring to Rama, based on knowledge from the first expedition, make exploring Rama easier.\n\nThe novel ends with three of the twelve astronauts abandoned inside Rama as it travels out of the Solar System.\n\nCrew of the Newton:\n\nRichard Wakefield: British electrical engineer\n\nFrancesca Sabatini: Italian journalist\n\nDavid Brown: American scientific leader\n\nShigeru Takagishi: Japanese scientist, expert on first Rama craft\n\nJanos Tabori: Russian cosmonaut\n\nValeriy Borzov: Russian General and Rama II mission commander\n\nNicole des Jardins: French chief medical and life-sciences officer\n\nMichael O'Toole: American general\n\nIrina Turgenyev: Russian cosmonaut and pilot\n\nHiro Yamanaka: Japanese cosmonaut and pilot\n\nReggie Wilson: American videographer working with Sabatini\n\nOtto Heilmann: German admiral\n\nRendezvous with Rama (1973)\n\nRama II (1989)\n\nThe Garden of Rama (1991)\n\nRama Revealed (1993)\n\nGentry Lee also wrote two further novels set in the same Rama Universe.\n\nBright Messengers (1996)\n\nDouble Full Moon Night (2000)\n\nSierra Entertainment created Rama in 1996 as a point and click adventure game in the style of Myst. Along with highly detailed graphics, Arthur C. Clarke also appeared in the game as the guide for the player. This game featured characters from Rama II."
