        "text": "THE GARDEN OF RAMA (Bantam, $20) by Arthur C. Clarke and Gentry Lee is the third in a series of novels that began in 1973 with Mr. Clarke's \"Rendezvous With Rama.\" The original Rama was a massive cylindrical spaceship that blundered into our solar system and allowed itself to be searched by human explorers before blasting off again into interstellar space. Although its level of technology was far superior to anything on Earth, Rama was otherwise an enigma; there was no sign on board of its creators and no clue as to its ultimate destination or purpose. \"Rama II,\" by Mr. Clarke and Mr. Lee, published in 1989, brought Rama back for a second look; this time when the mysterious ship left the solar system (to avoid a phalanx of nuclear-tipped missiles launched from Earth) it carried three unwilling human passengers.\n\nThe new novel begins with a birth. In her diary Nicole des Jardins, a life scientist and the wife of Richard Wakefield, a computer scientist, describes the delivery of a daughter with the help of Gen. Michael O'Toole, a sensitive friend of the family. The first hundred pages describe the attempts of this plucky little band to survive inside an alien artifact whose self-regenerating systems offer both life-saving resources and deadly dangers. Feeling an obligation to provide a more varied gene pool for their descendants, the three adults play a conscience-stricken game of procreative musical chairs. Just when it appears that they have succeeded in making their house in space a home, Rama arrives at a space station so vast that the state of Rhode Island could fit into one of its decks.\n\nText:\n\nHere the humans (whose numbers have doubled through more births) learn that the primary purpose of the \"Nodal Intelligence\" controlling Rama and the enormous space station is \"to catalogue life-forms in this part of the galaxy.\" Pressed for further explanations, the Nodal Intelligence turns coy; it communicates with its guests through a biomechanical surrogate that resembles a human being with a feathered torso, the face of an eagle and more ways of saying \"no comment\" than a Presidential press secretary. But its own curiosity about humans is not to be denied. Repaired and refitted, Rama returns to Earth with Nicole and Richard (and four of the children); the humans have agreed, somewhat reluctantly, to help recruit a larger human colony for further observation.\n\nAt this point the narrative switches gears, from the Swiss Family Robinson in space to political allegory. The new colony is named New Eden. Under the watchful eyes of the Nodal Intelligence, the 2,000 colonists re-create all the horrors of recent human history: repression, xenophobia, rape, war, self-destruction. Unfortunately the authors, who juggle technological marvels with aplomb, lack the resources to bring this sort of material to life. The result is a leaden morality play that takes up nearly half the book.\n\nThings begin to pick up again when Richard meets the intriguing aliens who share Rama with the human colony, and an outbreak of interspecies war rouses the Nodal Intelligence from its Olympian detachment. For those eager to find out what happens next, yet another sequel is in the works. Personally I intend to reread \"Rendezvous With Rama\" and see if I can experience again that little shiver of delight I felt on first reading the words \"The long-hoped-for, long-feared encounter had come at last. Mankind was about to receive the first visitor from the stars.\"\n\nOrson Scott Card's XENOCIDE (Tor/Tom Doherty, $21.95) is also the third novel in a series. Its theme is summed up in the title. \"Xeno\" comes from the Greek for stranger, guest or host. Xenophobia means fear of foreigners; xenocide, as Mr. Card defines it, refers to the extinction of any intelligent nonhuman species. If it is intentional, there can be no greater crime. In \"Ender's Game,\" the first novel in the series, Andrew Wiggin became a hero on Earth for his part in repelling the alien invaders known as \"buggers.\" Learning that the entire war had been caused by a misunderstanding, he sought to shoulder his \"terrible moral burden\" by saving the buggers from extinction and by becoming a euologistic \"Speaker for the Dead,\" the title of the second novel in the trilogy. In \"Xenocide\" the stakes are even higher.\n\nOn a planet called Lusitania, where Andrew Wiggin has secretly brought the buggers' \"hive queen\" to reanimate her species, an ingenious virus flourishes. Deadly to human beings, this microorganism is indispensable to the multistage existence of Lusitania's intelligent natives. Meanwhile, an entirely new form of life has somehow developed within the computers that oversee the faster-than-light communications network linking the human-inhabited planets controlled by Starways Congress. Events set in motion by this congress threaten the existence of one or more of these fragile and precious forms of life. Worse, the choices available to Andrew and the other players in this novel always seem to involve a trade-off of one life form for another. And I haven't even mentioned the planet Path, where human beings are threatened only by themselves and the grim secret buried in their brains.\n\nIf the story sounds complicated, that is partly because it is and partly because knowledge of what happened in the first two novels is essential to understanding this sequel. In fact, the three books form one long tale in which characters and concepts grow and deepen. Despite the epic confrontations called for in the plot, very little actually happens. The real action is philosophical: long, passionate debates about ends and means among people who are fully aware that they may be deciding the fate of entire species, entire worlds.\n\nInevitably there are slow patches, dialogue that seems to have been lifted from books rather than ripped from life-or-death deliberations: \"Our great civilizations are nothing more than social machines to create the ideal female setting, where a woman can count on stability; our legal and moral codes that try to abolish violence and promote permanence of ownership and enforce contracts -- those represent the primary female strategy, the taming of the male.\"\n\nIn the right hands, science fiction is a fine medium for philosophical speculation; its imaginative worlds offer endlessly flexible settings for the statement of theses and for their illustration and development. Mr. Card might have been wiser to compress his argument into a single book. But those who choose to follow him from start to finish will find that a novel of ideas can also be a novel of suspense.\n\nDEATH QUALIFIED (St. Martin's, $22.95) by Kate Wilhelm comes with a subtitle, \"A Mystery of Chaos,\" that hints at deep meaning. But that is only part of Ms. Wilhelm's narrative strategy. She has written a book not about ideas but about the impact of ideas -- in this case, scientific ideas -- on people who believe themselves immune to such intrusions. The ideas in question have to do with the new mathematics of chaos and fractals. The people range from self-absorbed lawyers to all-too-sane scientists. What brings these people together is murder, the destruction of a life in the name of bloodless abstractions like truth and fame and wealth and even love.\n\nThe setting is the Pacific Northwest, described in knowing detail that not only frames the action but plays an important role in the whodunit denouement. The lawyer who eventually solves the mystery is Barbara Holloway, who, like her father, is \"death qualified,\" meaning that she has served on a defense team in a capital case and so is qualified to represent a client who faces the death sentence if found guilty. The defendant, Nell Kendricks, is accused of shooting her estranged husband, Lucas, who has fallen in with a team of scientists on the trail of a discovery so big it will redefine the fabric of reality: He \"had the arrogance of almost knowing, and that's the worst kind.\" Ms. Wilhelm takes her time getting the pieces into place; but the ending, which I found both surprising and believable, makes good on all her promises."
