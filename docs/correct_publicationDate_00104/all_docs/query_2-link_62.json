        "text": "Whales lie inexplicably stranded on a beach in the Florida Keys.\n\nOvernight a dozen whales, wandering far from their normal migratory route, have appeared from nowhere and beached themselves. More of the creatures are floundering in dangerously shallow water, while a contingent of local citizens and fishermen try to steer them back to the open sea.\n\nLocal photojournalist Carol Dawson is sent to cover the story, and after some research identifies a small area of the ocean where, she believes, something must be causing the whales to panic and wander from their normal route.\n\nShe hires a boat, and together with its owner Nick Williams goes out to investigate. At first their dive reveals nothing but a perfectly normal looking undersea trench running between two coral reefs, but then they spot more whales, moving aimlessly and sluggishly as if drugged; and when they go closer to investigate they see what looks like a large hole, with metallic-looking ‘lips’ in the ocean floor; and emanating from the opening, a set of marks that look like tank tracks…Carol Dawson and Nick Williams are about to experience the most momentous discovery in the history of the human race.\n\nOnce again Arthur C. Clarke, the world’s bestselling SF writer, has produced a novel in which surprises and marvels are unveiled with masterly skill; if anything, his collaboration with top American space scientist and writer Gentry Lee has given Clarke’s work another dimension. Combining the tension of an outstanding thriller with ideas and revelations matching anything Arthur C. Clarke has ever written, Cradle is a masterwork of soaring visionary imagination, bound to prove as popular as such Clarke classics as Rendevous with Rama and 2001: A Space Odyssey."
