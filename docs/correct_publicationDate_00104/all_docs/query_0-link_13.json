        "text": "3 stars\n\nFirst Sentence: Two nights ago, at 10:44 Greenwich time on the Earth, Simone Tiasso Wakefield greeted the universe.\n\nThoughts: I did not hate this book. At least not entirely. There are several good points in Garden of Rama. For example:\n\n*The alien species were fascinating. One of my favorite parts was the conversation between Nicole and the caped eel at the Node. It was very “Oh my God you are so neat! What is it like to be you?” Phrased in scientific language, of course, but the sense of wonder was palpable.\n\n*Speaking of the alien races, the avian/myrmicat/sessile web/manna melon species was going in a very interesting direction before the book ended. I’m tempted to read Rama Revealed just to find out how that works.\n\n*Everything relating to space travel was excellent. The somnarium, especially. The aliens in charge of Rama do a lot of testing to figure out just how much the humans can take as the ship speeds up and slows down and all of that was extraordinary.\n\n*The entire sequence where the humans designed their own habitat on Rama and how they explained their needs to the aliens in charge of the ship was surprisingly interesting and entertaining.\n\nIn short, everything scientific or relating to aliens was great. What was not great was everything relating to the human characters. Especially:\n\n*the way the authors+ try too hard. All the “awards commitees love this!” boxes are checked off: black female protagonist, multicultural cast, AIDS analogue that in no way dates this book to the early 1990s, frank discussion of sex (see below), and heavy-handed moralizing. However this cultural and social sensitivity is severely under cut by…\n\n*multiple racial slurs directed towards the Japanese characters. What the hell?\n\n*sending a shipload of criminals to join a space colony. What is this, Australia in Space? And while we’re on that topic…\n\n*the way the human colony on Rama almost immediately collapsed into anarchy and war. That’s optimistic!\n\n*Nicole des Jardins-Wakefield. I’m going to have to start a new paragraph for her.\n\nNicole des Jardins-Wakefield is the single most irritating aspect of this book. She is a terrible character; one of those overachievers you only see in fiction. She’s a Olympic runner with at least one gold medal, a geneticist, a cosmonaut, and mother of six. Where did she find the time to do all of that? I know there’s a lot of time dilation on the journeys to and from the Node, but she did most of that on Earth. Nicole is completely unbelievable in other ways as well. She’s not a real person. She’s what a woman would be if she was designed by a robot who had only a vague idea of how humans act. Her dialogue in particular is completely stilted. Let’s take a look at The Talk she gives her daughter Ellie on her wedding day.\n\n“Sex is an important component of marriage, but it is not the most important. Because of your lack of experience, it is unlikely that sex will be wonderful for you at the beginning. However, if you and Robert love and trust each other, and both of you genuinely want to give and receive pleasure, you will find that your physical compatibility will increase year after year.”\n\nI can’t be the only person who read that in Lt. Commander Data’s voice. And while we’re at it, why does she wait until the morning of her daughter’s wedding to have the sex talk with her? One would think that discussion would come sooner. Oh, I forgot, Nicole’s a robot who has no idea how real humans act.\n\nBut by far the most annoying factor in this 593-page tome is the fact that the story is not finished on the last page. I spent hours, days, nay weeks reading this book and when I finally get to the last fifty pages I find new plot points and conflicts! Just when I have hope that this nonsense will finally end and I’ll have some resolution I find “To Be Continued…” This book is lucky I didn’t throw it across the room.\n\nThis is why I have a problem with the series epidemic in fantasy and science fiction. I love both of those genres but authors writing in them need to learn how to pick a plot to focus on and wrap it up by the end of the book.\n\nI know I’m going to read the rest of the books in the series, especially Rendezvous with Rama, because I am interested in the science aspects and I do want to know what’s going on with the manna melon species. But not for a while. I have to forget how irritated I am with Garden of Rama first."
