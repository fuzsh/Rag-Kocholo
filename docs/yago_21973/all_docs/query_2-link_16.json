He portrayed Gilderoy Lockhart in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\n\nBorn in Belfast, Northern Ireland, Branagh is well known for his Shakespeare adaptations, a number of which he co-starred in with Emma Thompson, to whom he was married from 1989 to 1995. Thompson portrays Sybill Trelawney in the Harry Potter films. Branagh was later involved with Helena Bonham Carter, who portrays Bellatrix Lestrange in the films.\n\nIn 2001, Branagh won an Emmy Award for the TV movie Conspiracy. His remake of Sleuth, with Michael Caine and Jude Law, was released in 2007.\n\nOutside his Shakespeare work, Branagh has also delved into SF and fantasy, playing Dr. Frankenstein in a popular mid-90s version of the Frankenstein story, and as Dr. Loveless in a film version of the TV series The Wild Wild West. In 2011, he directed a film adaptation of the comic book superhero Thor, and appeared in My Week with Marilyn with Emma Watson, Geraldine Somerville, Toby Jones, and Zoë Wanamaker.\n\nIn 2012, he was knighted at the 2012 Birthday Honours for his services to drama and to the community in Northern Ireland.[1]\n\nSelected filmography[]\n\nActor[]\n\nYear Film Role Notes 2013 Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit Viktor Cherevin Supporting role as well as director 2011 My Week with Marilyn Sir Laurence Olivier Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor 2009 The Boat That Rocked Sir Alistair Dormandy 2008-2010 Wallander (TV series) Kurt Wallander 6 episodes 2008 Valkyrie Henning von Tresckow 10 Days to War Colonel Tim Collins TV Series: 1 Episode 2007 Sleuth Other Man on TV Uncredited 2006 American Experience (TV series documentary) Narrator 1 episode\n\nThe Man Behind Hitler 2005 Warm Springs Franklin D.
