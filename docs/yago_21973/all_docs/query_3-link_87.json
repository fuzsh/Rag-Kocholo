        "text": "The young man has been caught by his best friends in a seriously compromising position. One of four forsworn swains in the splashy, hit-or-miss musical adaptation of Shakespeare’s “Love’s Labour’s Lost,” which opened on Monday night at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, this red-faced lad has been found — oh, the shame of it — composing a love poem to a member of the opposite sex.\n\nThat amounts to treason, since the man, Longaville by name and winningly played by Bryce Pinkham, has taken a solemn vow with his pals to have nothing to do with women. But what’s really embarrassing is that, for some reason, Longaville has been venting his poetic side dressed in sequined hot pants with a skimpy matching vest.\n\nAnd, oh yes, he’s been hoofing like Ruby Keeler to music that sounds suspiciously like the finale of “A Chorus Line,” with his own personal high-kicking backup tap dancers. Thus discovered, Longaville resorts to words uttered by many a soul surprised in flagrante delicto: “I can explain!”\n\nNo you can’t, dude. And I’ll bet you the talented creators of this spirited but slapdash show — the writer and director Alex Timbers and the composer Michael Friedman — can’t, either. I mean, why would Longaville, who has so far been presented as an amiable slacker-stoner type, turn out to harbor razzle-dazzle Broadway fantasies?\n\nFor that matter, why did the clean-cut King of Navarre (Daniel Breaker, the donkey in the Broadway “Shrek”), who had initiated this chastity pledge, morph into a pumped-up black-leather rock star only minutes earlier, as he revealed that he, too, had fallen in love? And why full Elizabethan costume, and a lute accompanist, for yet another declaration, this one by their chum Dumaine (Lucas Near-Verbrugghe)?\n\nThe point appears to be that love makes fools of everyone, which is also the point — or a point — of the Shakespeare play that inspired this woozy frolic. But comedy is funniest, and truest, when people make fools of themselves in ways peculiar to their characters. In this production, there is seldom a real connection between the singers and their songs. It’s as if the musical numbers, which cover a gamut of pastiche styles, had been assigned at random from a mixtape playlist.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
