        "text": "Share this Article:\n\nProduction is underway on Kenneth Branagh’s next film, The Last Disturbance Of Madeline Hynde. Here are some casting details.\n\nActor, writer and director Kenneth Branagh’s next film will be The Last Disturbance Of Madeline Hynde. The plot hasn’t been revealed as yet, but if we were to speculate, the title hints at some sort of thriller or mystery (Branagh has been making those Poirot films of late). Jodie Comer was cast in the production earlier this year, and according to Deadline, the rest of the cast has been confirmed.\n\nComer stars alongside Patricia Arquette, Michael Sheen, Tom Bateman, Vicky McClure, Michael Balogun, Kristina Tonteri-Young, Karla Crome, Aiysha Hart and Gemma Whelan.\n\nBranagh will next be seen starring alongside Ryan Reynolds in Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley’s Mayday for Apple TV.\n\nKenneth Branagh may be better known as a Shakespearean actor, but he’s built up an impressive and eclectic filmography as a director. Making his debut in 1989 with an adaptation of Henry V, he went on to steer the noir romantic thriller Dead Again. Also in the early 1990s, we got Peter’s Friends – one of his best films. Rita Rudner and Martin Bergman’s script gives the ensemble cast, including Branagh, Rudner, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Tony Slattery, Emma Thompson and Phyllida Law, some terrific dialogue to work with.\n\nPodcast: In The Bleak Midwinter (aka A Midwinter’s Tale) live, with Kenneth Branagh and more\n\nUndoubtedly his most underrated, and certainly lesser seen film, is In The Bleak Midwinter, which he wrote and directed in 1996. It is a wonderful ensemble comedy about a troupe of actors attempting to stage a production of Hamlet at Christmas. We recently screened the film with Branagh and cast in attendance for a live podcast.\n\nAfter a brief foray into Hollywood action cinema with 2014’s Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, he found success directing and starring in a string of Agatha Christie adaptations as the magnificently mustachioed Hercule Poirot. Murder On The Orient Express, Death On The Nile and A Haunting In Venice have been produced so far.\n\nProduction on The Last Disturbance Of Madeline Hynde is underway in the UK. We’ll keep you updated as we learn more."
