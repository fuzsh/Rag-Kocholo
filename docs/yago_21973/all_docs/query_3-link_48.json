        "text": "[Editors Note: Project of the Day is presented in partnership with Blackmagic Design, one of the world’s leading innovators and manufacturers of creative video technology.]\n\nHere’s your daily dose of an indie film, web series, TV pilot, what-have-you in progress — at the end of the week, you’ll have the chance to vote for your favorite.\n\nIn the meantime: Is this a project you’d want to see? Tell us in the comments.\n\nLove’s Labour’s Lost\n\nLogline: Four boarding school boys, distracted by four enchanting exchange students, struggle to keep a vow of chastity in this new adaptation of Shakespeare’s bawdy comedy.\n\nElevator Pitch:\n\nFerdinand, student president of Navarre Academy, convinces his three classmates to commit to a chastity vow in pursuit of their studies. But we soon see that “young blood doth not obey an old decree.” With the arrival of four new girls at their school, the boys quickly fall for each of their new classmates. Meanwhile, their bombastic Spanish teacher, caught in a love triangle with the pothead janitor, lusts for the school’s sultry nurse. From secret parties in the woods to Russian disguises, the students’ and teachers’ wild antics come to life in this modern adaptation of Shakespeare’s bawdy comedy!\n\nProduction Team:\n\nDirectors: Jennifer Sturley, Jake O’Hare\n\nExecutive Producers: Alexandra Malick, Andrea Ogden, Genie Ratcliff\n\nCo-Producers: Jake O’Hare, Jennifer Sturley\n\nSupervising Producer: Michael Dolan (“Dance with the One”)\n\nCinematographer: Tom Rosenberg (“Nothing Human”)\n\nEditor: Grey Ellis\n\nAbout the Film:\n\nWhen we first discovered Love’s Labour’s Lost, we were inspired by how much we connected to this story written 400 years ago. We believe Shakespeare is still important and relevant today. This film highlights the ridiculous characters who have the same hopes and dreams as all of us…namely to get laid. Shakespeare was a raunchy poet, and we’re bringing that raunchy humor to life! Love’s Labour’s Lost will make Shakespeare comfortable for you if you’ve always been Bard-phobic, and fun for you if you’re bored of the Shakespeare you studied in English classes. There’s something here for everyone to love!\n\nCurrent Status: Our initial Indiegogo campaign raised over $29,000 for production. Now we’re crowdfunding for the second half of our post-production and distribution budget.\n\nGot a project that you’d like to be featured? Submit to Project of the Day!"
