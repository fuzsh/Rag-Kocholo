        "text": "This article is about Shakespeare's play. For other uses, see Love's Labor's Lost (disambiguation).\n\nAt first glance, one of William Shakespeare's plays, the early comedy Love's Labor's Lost, simply entertains and amuses. Four young men (one of them a king) withdraw from the world for three years, taking an oath that they will have nothing to do with women. The King of Navarre soon learns, however, that the Princess of France and her ladies are about to arrive. Although he lodges them outside of his court, all four men fall in love with the ladies, abandoning their oaths and setting out to win their hands.\n\nThe laughter triggered by this story is augmented by subplots involving a braggart soldier, a clever page, illiterate servants, a parson, a schoolmaster, and a constable so dull that he is named Dull. Letters and poems are misdelivered, confessions are overheard, entertainments are presented, and language is played with, and misused, by the ignorant and learned alike.\n\nAt a deeper level, Love's Labor’s Lost also teases the mind. The men begin with the premise that women either are seductresses or goddesses. The play soon makes it clear, however, that the reality of male-female relations is different. That women are not identical to men’s images of them is a common theme in Shakespeare's plays. In Love's Labor’s Lost it receives one of its most pressing examinations.\n\nMost scholars believe that Shakespeare wrote Love’s Labor’s Lost in 1594–95. The play was published in quarto form in 1598; an earlier printed version probably existed, though it has not survived. Shakespeare’s sources for this play have been difficult to establish with certainty.[1]\n\nProductions at the Folger\n\nLove's Labor's Lost (2019)\n\nLove's Labor's Lost (Shenandoah Shakespeare Express, 2002)\n\nLove's Labor's Lost (Shenandoah Shakespeare Express, 1997)\n\nEarly editions\n\nFirst Folio\n\nLUNA: First Folio: L1v - M6v\n\nHamnet: STC 22273 Fo.1 no.68\n\nSecond Folio\n\nLUNA: Second Folio: L1v - M6v\n\nHamnet: STC 22274 Fo.2 no.07\n\nFirst Quarto\n\nLUNA: First Quarto\n\nHamnet: STC 22294 copy 1\n\nSecond Quarto\n\nLUNA: Second Quarto\n\nHamnet: STC 22295 Copy 2\n\nThe title page of the 1623 First Folio edition of Love's Labor's Lost.
