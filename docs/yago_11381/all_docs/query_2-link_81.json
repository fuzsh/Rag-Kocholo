        "meta_description": "Cardboard sleeve - S/S - CALLE MAYOR - 2016 -  Rose Marie is a 1936 musical film starring Jeanette MacDonald, Nelson Eddy and Reginald Owen and directed by W. S. Van Dyke. It was the second of three movie adaptations from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer of the 1924 Broadway musical of the same name. A silent version was released in 1928 and a color film in 1954. All three versions are set in the Canadian wilderness. Portions of Rudolf Friml and Herbert Stothart's original score for the Broadway musical are utilized in both the 1936 and 1954 films. Although the original plot was changed, and most of the songs were dropped, the 1936 film was a huge success and became MacDonald and Eddy's best-known film. Their duet of ''Indian Love Call'' was a major hit for the two singers and remained a signature song throughout their careers",
