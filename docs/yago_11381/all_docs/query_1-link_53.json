(In contrast, the 1932 adaptation has Jekyll transform almost to an animal, by use of lots of latex.)\n\nNote: there had been already at least five direct film adaptations of the story. Another was produced the same year as this, and more every decade after, and spin-offs, besides.\n\nThe film is in the public domain in the U.S., and copies are available on-line.\n\nL’uomo meccanico\n\nThe mechanical man\n\n1921 Milano Film\n\n−− criminals use robots for evil\n\nsilent\n\ndirectedAndré Deed\n\nAndre Deedas Saltarello Valentina Frascarolias Mado Mathilde Lambertas Elena D’Ara Gabriel Moreauas Prof. D’Ara Ferdinando Vivas-May Giulia Costa\n\nLess than half of the film has been recovered.

In Russia, they joke that the message might be from Mars.\n\nThe sets and outfits are pretty wild, extravagant.\n\nIs it really sci-fi? Inasmuch as it all turns out to be a dream, not really: it is, explicitly, fantasy. There’s little science to the fantasy, only the idea that travel to Mars, and being on Mars, might be possible would now be deemed science fiction. (At the time, few could have made the distinction, though.)\n\nWunder der Schöpfung\n\n(Our Heavenly Bodies\n\nor\n\nA Trip to the Planets)\n\n1925 Kulturfilm\n\n+ science education with sci-fi fantasy\n\nsilent\n\ndirectedHanns Walter Kornblum wroteHanns Walter Kornblum,\n\nErnst Krieger\n\nPaul Bildt Willy Kaiser-Heyl Theodor Loos Oscar Marion\n\nThis is the best, most complete, dissemination of its time about the cosmos, and very much a forerunner of Carl Sagan’s series Cosmos. The science fiction is only a fantastical segment of what is otherwise a science documentary.\n\nVehicle: a “phantasyship” with electric motors (later called a “spaceship”). A curious contraption, looking like a combination airship and submarine, in a sort of globe.\n\nFeatures what appears to be footage from rocket or balloon launches; a depiction of launch of the spaceship from a futuristic city.\n\nThe spaceship lands on Mars, where men crawl out, and proceed to bounce around as though on trampolines. They go on to travel to the speed of light and beyond, and visit different sorts of stars. They travel as far as the edge of the Milky Way… beyond which the film speculates whether there is anything at all. This is because, until the year the film was being made, the fact that other galaxies lie outside the Milky Way was still a matter of debate.\n\nAbout Sagan’s Cosmos: The similarities are very strong: Sagan had his “Ship of the Imagination” in which he explores the cosmos.\n\nCould he have seen this film? I have my doubts. By the time he was an adult, the film was well and lost, and a big war had been fought. Could he have seen it as a child? A German import into the U.S., between the wars? Could he have talked with someone who had seen it? This last possibility seems very strong to me: an expatriate German scientist, filled with wonder at an old educational film he had seen in his home country.\n\nThe Lost World\n\n1925 First National Pictures, Inc.\n\n+ dinosaurs discovered\n\nsilent, with stop-action\n\ndirectorHarry O.

Hibbard Jacko himself\n\nThis is the first full-length dinosaur movie, and generally a very fine production. A few scenes of the stop-motion dinosaurs are all most people have seen of it. But this is an epic action-adventure, with character development and an arc, and seen in its entirety, it’s pretty entertaining.\n\nThe animations are excellent — the dinosaurs breathe and emote. They’re at least as good as anything that appeared until Harryhausen’s animations of the ’60s.\n\nPlace: “…somewhere beyond the reaches of the Amazon”\n\nLike many of the films of the era, the originals of this film were lost, and most of the copies disintegrated in time. Only a few scenes reappeared over the years (sometimes as a cheap and fast way to insert dinosaurs, sometimes as ridicule of old-time filmmaking). Researchers found eight partial copies, only by carefully searching many film archives; this sufficed to restore most of the original. My edition is:\n\n2000 Edition Produced by Serge Bromberg, David Shepard\n\nRestoration Editor Mathieu Duboscq\n\nLobster Films, Paris\n\nThe acting of the principals is very good, given the styles of the times. Challenger and White are particularly believable.\n\nOn the other hand, the portrayal of South American natives is poor. There’s a girl who might belong in a Mexican cantina, except for her grass skirt, and a guide played by a white man in blackface. Was this really necessary?\n\nBefore the team even reaches the land of the dinosaurs, they are beset by a band of fanged ape-men and chimpanzees! Well, ape-men appeared in the book, and presumably, the chimp represents an ape-man. For me, it detracts from the main premise.\n\nThe dinosaur menagerie includes: pterodactyl, brontosaurus, allosaurus (who beats up on … a duck-bill something), triceratops and baby, triceratops with spiny shield.\n\nIt’s a girl who gets the ball rolling, of course:\n\n“I will only marry a man of great deeds and strange experiences — a man who can look death in the face without flinching!”\n\n(And she returns to playing with her cat with a mouse on a string.)\n\nMetropolis\n\n1927 UFA\n\n++ future class society & androids\n\nsilent\n\ndirectorFritz Lang set designOtto Hunte,\n\nErich Kettelhut,\n\nKarl Vollbrecht cameraKarl Freund,\n\nGünther Rittau. special effectsKonstantin Tshetwerikoff combination processEugen Schüfftan based onThea von Harbou’s\n\nnovel screenplayThea von Harbou\n\nAlfred Abelas Joh Fredersen Gustav Fröhlichas Freder, Fredersen’s son Fritz Raspas the Thin Man Theodor Loosas Josaphat Erwin Biswangeras 11811 Heinrich Georgeas Grot, guardian of the Heart Machine Brigitte Helmas Maria\n\nThis is a great film that has affected science fiction films ever since. It’s also a great story.\n\nMost of the original film was lost or destroyed. Researchers reconstructed the film from fragments of prints that they discovered over the years. Some sequences are known only from one low-quality damaged print. Some sequences of the film may be lost for good.\n\nThe style is high Art Deco.\n\nTitanic machines, cityscapes. Elevated roadways and rail lines; biplanes fly between buildings. The boss communicates with a 2-way video screen.\n\nArmies of workers, heads bowed, are barely able to step in line. The workers’ city is deep below. At the “Club of the Sons”, sons of the rich exercise, and damsels entertain them. You know this isn’t going to go well.\n\nThe son, Freder, of the richest guy, there meets Maria, who is just trying to get them to help poor kids, and there is your boy-meets-girl.\n\nChoreographed workers operate a huge steam machine “M-Machine”. A worker falters, and it overheats, men are thrown everywhere! Before Freder’s eyes the machine becomes the man-devouring Moloch!\n\nThe machine-woman is, in the film, a re-creation of the Inventor’s lost wife, Hel. This aspect is like the Frankenstein story. But there is more than one guy mad with his own badness: Fredersen wants to use her to crush the workers. They conspire to give the machine-woman the likeness of Maria, each for his own reason.\n\nThe scene of Maria in the preparation tube was directly ripped off by The Fifth Element.\n\nThe machine-woman-Maria is much like Maria but with more mascara and a twisted smile and walk — her transformation from saintly to wicked is one of my favorite parts of the film. She raises hell among the young rich in the “Yoshiwara” district (this taken from an official prostitution district in Tokyo).\n\nI had the pleasure of seeing the reconstructed film with a live orchestral accompaniment at the Babylon in Berlin. I can attest that musical accompaniment greatly adds to the experience.\n\n“The mediator between the head and hands must be the heart!”\n\nFrau im Mond\n\nWoman in the Moon\n\n1929 UFA\n\n++ intrigue and moon flight\n\nsilent\n\ndirectionFritz Lang screenplayThea von Harbou cinematographyCurt Courant head of productionEduard Kubat based onThea von Harbou’s\n\nFrau im Mond artistic collaboratorsProf. Dr. Gustav Wolff,\n\nJoseph Danilowatz scientific collaboratorProf. Hermann Oberth\n\nWilly Fritschas Wolf Helius Gerda Maurusas astronomy student Friede Velten Klaus Pohlas Prof. Georg Mannfeldt Fritz Raspas (the man who calls himself) Walter Turner Gustl Stark-Gstettenbauras Gustav Gustav von Wangenheimas Eng.

It has plenty of time to treat the central topic of travel to the Moon, but luxuriates in complicated and dubious intrigues, both before the trip and on the Moon.\n\nA woman wrote the story, and women figure into the action importantly. There is a cigar-munching female industrialist, a breathtakingly pretty poisoner, and Friede, who besides being an assistant and an astronomy student, serves as photographer and nurse on the mission, and voice of bravery and calm, as well as the pinnacle of a love triangle.\n\nReason for going to the Moon: its mountains are made of gold!\n\nVehicle: Friede. A stubby bullet shape, but with very long fins of boxlike construction, rectangular holes open at front and back. The film presents a nice cutaway model of the rocket, showing two levels of crew compartments in the nose, and canisters and machinery below.\n\nHelius has already sent an unmanned register rocket H23 to the Moon, to produce a magnesium explosion visible from Earth. The H23 looks rather more like conventional rockets, except again with fins of boxlike construction.\n\nThe intertitles provide some numerical details as well as a trajectory of the flight to the Moon: 11,200 kph as an escape velocity. They point out that there is an “opposite side” to the Moon. They also mention a theory that, on that side, there is an atmosphere.\n\nIt seems they are not the first to attempt the Moon. A memorial appears, showing the names of people have tried before, and died.\n\nThe young scamp is reading a pulp fiction novel. What is barely legible:\n\nMINGO\n\nder\n\nNick Carter\n\nder Luft\n\nSaturn-Piraten\n\n(Nick Carter was a detective character in pulp fiction serials. But web searches turn up no mention of Mingo.) Later, on board the rocket, he pulls out his stash of novels. They read:\n\nMondvampire\n\nDas Geheimnis der unreadable Mondstrahlen\n\nIm Kampf mit Mondkalbern\n\nMingos Heimkehr zur Erde\n\nAnd when they arrive at the Moon, the boy exclaims “this is the way Mingo would go!”\n\n(A book notes this literature: Der deutsche Zukunftsroman 1918-1945: Gattungstypologie und socialgeschichtliche Verortung, von Dina Brandt)\n\nThe rocket rolls out of the hangar standing upright on rails.\n\nAerial photos of the rocket hangar are surprisingly realistic, showing aircraft wing and shadows moving over it.\n\n“Because the spaceship is too light to stand freely, it is submerged in a water basin in which it stands upright.”\n\n(Why? It was standing upright until it got to the basin.)\n\nThere is a count-down to launch, and the rocket sling-shots into space!\n\nThe crew consists of: the young visionary, the feeble old professor, his pet mouse, the pretty assistant, the other assistant (her betrothed), and a scoundrel… and a young stowaway.\n\nThey experience respiratory distress and writhe a lot from the acceleration. They “dump middle rocket” partway up, which appears to be the box-shaped fins. By the time they get to escape velocity, everybody has passed out.\n\nScientific depictions:\n\nThey look back to see Earth from space, as almost an after-thought.\n\nWeightlessness, difficulties of and techniques for dealing with fluids.\n\nA scene shows Earth setting over the Moon, as they fly to the dark side.\n\nThey have to test the air to see if they can breathe it, which they do by lighting matches, which burn. No further space suits are required.\n\nThe Woman in the Moon is of course Friede.\n\nThe Mysterious Island\n\n1929 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\n+ undersea adventure\n\npartly with soundtrack, partly with intertitles\n\ndirectorLucien Hubbard screenplayLucien Hubbard based onJules Verne’s\n\nL’Île mystérieuse\n\nLionel Barrymoreas Count Dakkar Jacqueline Gadsdenas Sonia Dakkar Lloyd Hughesas Nikolai Roget Montagu Loveas Falon Harry Gribbonas Mikhail\n\nThe relation of the screenplay to Verne’s book appears to be one of an explanation for the later stories L’Île mystérieuse: \"Le capitaine Nemo était un indien, le prince Dakkar…\" Since this film begins with a prince Dakkar building submarines, it must have been intended as background for the Verne stories.\n\nThis represents an interesting time in filmmaking: it’s a “part-talkie”, some short scenes having a soundtrack, but it also has intertitles.\n\nAs with many films of this era, even important ones, the film was thought to have been lost, but enthusiasts and archivists have reassembled enough of it to make a whole movie.\n\nThe prince launches two submarines. Giant octopuses appear, as do underwater humanoids. Also, workers wear very elaborate diving suits, somehow representing how a diving suit of the 19th century might have looked. And a woman goes out in one (unlike in Verne’s writing)!"
