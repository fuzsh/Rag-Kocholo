        "text": "Lucien Hubbard\n\nDirector B Reeves, Lucien Hubbard and Douglas Z Doty\n\nLucien Hubbard was born 21 Dec 1888 in Ft Thomas, Ky. the son of Gilbert Frank and Rose Ann (Swingle). By the 1900 census he was living in Bellevue Ky. and attended the schools there. One of his teachers there was Miss Julia Merrill and he graduated in 1905. He was married to Alice about 1915 who was from Ohio. He became a writer for the Cincinnati Post and later moved to Hollywood where he became a screenwriter and director. He died in Los Angeles California 31 Dec 1971 and was buried in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City.\n\nHubbard is best known for producing the 1927 film Wings, for which he received the first Academy Award for Best Picture. Lucien produced and or wrote ninety-two films over the course of his career. He lived in the same house in Beverly Hills until the day he died; he was an avid polo player and would frequently ride out of the stables located, in those days, at the rear of his Hillcrest Road property, to Will Rogers' house in the Palisades; he also occasionally rode his horse to Paramount Studios where he had been elevated to president shortly after the Academy Award-winning Wings which he produced, was released. This film helped director William A Wellman's rise into major studio films.\n\nBefore coming to Los Angeles, he was night editor of The New York Times. He had written five screenplays on the side and decided one day to travel to Hollywood to see if he could sell any of them; he sold three and in 1923, his career was launched. A film he loved and the adaptation for, The Vanishing American (1925), was the first film to portray the Indian in a favorable light; he received an award from the Cherokee nation for this. He discovered and mentored many talents over the life of his career and was known as a very generous man with a sharp eye for good writers.
