        "text": "VAN NUYS >> Actress Rose Marie, who had one of the longest-running careers in show business, highlighted by her work on “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” died Thursday at age 94.\n\nAccording to her official website, Rose Marie died at 2 p.m. Thursday in Van Nuys.\n\nBorn Rose Marie Mazetta, she began her show-business career at age 3, performing in Atlantic City and touring the country as Baby Rose Marie. She went on to a career on radio, was given her own show and sang for three presidents.\n\nShe moved to the big screen in 1929 with the short “Baby Rose Marie the Child Wonder,” and later appeared in films including “International House,” “Top Banana” and “The Big Beat.”\n\nIn 1946, she married Bobby Guy, the lead trumpeter on “The Tonight Show,” bringing her to California. Around the same time, she was hired by mobster Bugsy Siegel to headline shows at the new Flamingo hotel-casino in Las Vegas.\n\nShe went on to make guest appearances on television shows such as “Gunsmoke,” “The Red Skelton Hour” and “The Bob Cummings Show” before landing the role of comedy writer Sally Rogers on “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” which ran from 1961-66, propelling her to stardom.\n\nShe continued to work regularly for decades after the show’s run ended and continued working into the 2000s, most recently lending her voice to “The Garfield Show.”\n\nBobby Guy died in 1964. Rose Marie said in a recent interview that he enjoyed the trademark bow she wore in her hair beginning as a child, and she continued to wear one every day in his memory. One of her black bows is displayed at the Smithsonian museum.\n\nHer death comes about two months after the release of the film “Wait for Your Laugh,” a documentary that traces Rose Marie’s career and features interviews with the stars who worked alongside her over the decades.\n\nShe recently became active on Twitter, with a post on her official account in the past day reminiscing about her days as a “Flamingo Girl” in Las Vegas.\n\nShe is survived by her daughter, Georgiana Marie, and son-in-law Steven Rodrigues.\n\nFuneral services were pending.\n\nFlowers will be placed on her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 11 a.m. Friday. The star is located at 7083 Hollywood Blvd."
