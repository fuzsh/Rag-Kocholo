Our film critic Justin Chang recommends the independent drama \"Good One,\" which premiered at this year's Sundance Film Festival and opens in theaters August 9. It's the first feature written and directed by India Donaldson and stars James Le Gros and Lily Collias as father and daughter on a camping trip that goes gradually and suspensefully awry. Here's Justin's review.\n\nJUSTIN CHANG, BYLINE: Too often, the month of August is regarded as a fallow period for moviegoing, after the big blockbusters of the summer but before the awards contenders of the fall. But the aptly titled new movie \"Good One\" is a reminder that there are always smart, interesting films being released if you're willing to look beyond the obvious. As it turns out, looking beyond the obvious is something that the writer-director India Donaldson has a real knack for. In just 90 minutes, she tells a three-character story that appears simple enough on the surface, yet it's so sharp and engrossing that you might not immediately notice the deeper story taking shape underneath.\n\nLily Collias plays 17-year-old Sam, who's going backpacking in the Catskills with her father, Chris - that's the terrific James Le Gros in a too-rare leading role. They're supposed to be joined by Chris' oldest friend, Matt, and his teenage son, Dylan. But Matt winds up being the only one to come along. He and Dylan's mom are recently divorced, and Dylan isn't taking it well.\n\nChris himself has been divorced for a while. And he and Sam have a pretty harmonious relationship by comparison. They seem to get along even when they're bickering, as in this scene where Chris criticizes Sam's driving.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"GOOD ONE\")\n\nJAMES LE GROS: (As Chris) OK, so on this curve - just easy, easy.\n\nLILY COLLIAS: (As Sam) I'm taking them easy.\n\nLE GROS: (As Chris) Yeah, yeah. Just sometimes, it doesn't feel easy.\n\nCOLLIAS: (As Sam) I'm just driving.\n\nLE GROS: (As Chris) OK, slow down a little bit. Just slow down.\n\nCOLLIAS: (As Sam) I'm going the speed limit.\n\nLE GROS: (As Chris) You're actually going five miles over.\n\nCOLLIAS: (As Sam) I'm not. And you always go, like, at least 10 over.\n\nLE GROS: (As Chris) That is my privilege as father.\n\nDANNY MCCARTHY: (As Matt) She's a better driver than you, man.\n\nLE GROS: (As Chris) That's because I taught her.\n\nCOLLIAS: (As Sam) Thank you, Matt.\n\nLE GROS: (As Chris) Take a left up here.\n\nCHANG: Much of the movie consists of Sam listening quietly as Chris and Matt go on and on, reminiscing about old times, yet always finding new things to grouse about. Chris, a savvy outdoorsman, can't stop complaining about how badly Matt has overpacked for a three-day hiking trip. While the two men rarely ask Sam how she's doing or feeling, they seem cool enough where it counts. Chris has long been supportive of his daughter's queer identity. She has a girlfriend whom she texts during the trip whenever she can get a cellphone signal. Matt tells Sam that she's wise beyond her years.
