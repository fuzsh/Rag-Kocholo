        "text": "For nearly 90 years \"Miss Rose Marie's\" husky-voice, good looks, and comedic timing entertained millions. She started her career at the age of 3 and soon had her own radio show, was making records, and starring in several of the earliest talking films beginning with the 1929 short, \"Baby Rose Marie the Child Wonder.\" She worked with all the greats of vaudeville, theatre, radio, television and film. She had a brief Broadway run in \"Top Banana,\" made numerous guest appearances on all the hottest shows of the day, starred in several television series, including \"The Doris Day Show,\" and \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" which made her a household name. She spent years as the top center square on \"Hollywood Squares\" and is the only original member to have been part of all of its reincarnations. As part of a singing and comedy act called \"4 Girls 4,\" she toured extensively with Rosemary Clooney, Helen O'Connell and Margaret Whiting, breaking house records all over the world. In 2002 she penned her best-selling memoirs \"Hold The Roses,\" and just months before she passed away at the age of 94 on December 28, 2017, her documentary, \"Wait For You Laugh\" was released to critical acclaim.\n\nIn recognition of her amazing career and her contribution to the world of comedy her archives, including her trademark bow, costumes, scripts, awards, correspondence, photos, home movies and scrapbooks are housed at the National Comedy Center with the likes of George Carlin, Shelley Berman and Lucille Ball. As a testament to her standing in the world of entertainment, the Smithsonian's Museum of American Historyhas enshrined numerous items from her lifetime of performing.\n\nAugust 15 of 2023 marks Mother's centennial. In honor of her 100th, a CD of Mother's music has been produced. The CD, \"Rose Marie Sings\" is in response to her faithful fans' requests to hear more of her singing. Her birthday will be celebrated on her social media with 100 daily posts of \"Rose Marie Facts.\" I hope you'll join us in marking this anniversary of her birth.\n\nThanks for stopping by my mother's website, and please follow her official account on twitter and facebookwhere I share photos and memories.\n\nNoopy\n\nCDs are available at AMAZON and your favorite music retailer\n\nor you can get a special deluxe edition here which includes a photo card of\n\nadditional rare images, autographed by Rose Marie's daughter, Noopy.\n\nClick here and visit Rose Marie's Closet to acquire treasures from her estate.\n\nFollow @RoseMarie4Real"
