The\n\nphotograph is dropped, REVEALING ANOTHER, MORE compromising\n\none. Then another, and another. More moans.\n\nCURLY'S VOICE\n\n(crying out)\n\nOh, no.\n\nINT. GITTES' OFFICE\n\nCURLY drops the photos on Gittes' desk. Curly towers over\n\nGITTES and sweats heavily through his workman's clothes, his\n\nbreathing progressively more labored. A drop plunks on Gittes'\n\nshiny desk top.\n\nGittes notes it. A fan whiffs overhead. Gittes glances up at\n\nit. He looks cool and brisk in a white linen suit despite\n\nthe heat. Never taking his eyes off Curly, he lights a\n\ncigarette using a lighter with a \"nail\" on his desk.\n\nCurly, with another anguished sob, turns and rams his fist\n\ninto the wall, kicking the wastebasket as he does. He starts\n\nto sob again, slides along the wall where his fist has left\n\na noticeable dent and its impact has sent the signed photos"
