        "text": "Modern hotel with a rooftop pool and bar in Santiago’s hippest district\n\nThe Singular Santiago is a luxury hotel in the Lastarria neighbourhood of Santiago.\n\nA sister hotel to The Singular Patagonia, The Singular Santiago is located in one of the artiest areas of the Chilean capital, Lastarria: the Museum of Fine Art, the Museum of Visual Arts, and the Gabriel Mistral Center are all within walking distance of the hotel.\n\nIt’s not just the location that’s appealing: the rooftop pool provides a scenic setting in which to both cool down after a day exploring Santiago and take in the view; the spa offers post- or pre-long-haul flight massages; and the Singular Restaurant serves French dishes alongside local specialties, such as Guanaco and Penca, to keep the flavour decidedly Latin. The ninth-floor Sky Bar is the perfect place to polish off a day in Lastarria.\n\nThere are 62 rooms: the Patio Rooms and the Classic Rooms overlook the Plaza Mulato Gil, and the Deluxe Balcony Rooms have views across the Parque Forestal. All rooms at The Singular benefit from stylish decor and all the mod-cons you could wish for, including wireless internet, LCD TVs, large and comfortable beds, and well-equipped, spacious marble bathrooms."
