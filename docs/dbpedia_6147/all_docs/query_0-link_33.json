        "text": "Year Purchased: 1978\n\nAbout the owner:\n\nI have enjoyed living in the area and have known some of the neighbors for many years. The neighbors are quiet. I and my husband raised 3 boys there. It is great to take walks or bike along the creek area by Great America, and watch fireworks on special events from the backyard. I am a Registered Nurse with a teaching degree and experience. I enjoy the special arts and crafts events in the area. I enjoy going to many different things, and able to get out of the traffic quickly. The wine tasting in Saratoga, Morgan Hill, and Gilroy are close and more down to earth than many others. The flower shows are quiet enjoyable.\n\nWhy the Owner Chose North San Jose, San Jose, CA, USA:\n\nVery clean, open feeling, and many places to travel to and come back within the same day for a quiet night. New local eating areas within a couple of miles. House stays cool with insulation (even without the AC) and is comfortable after a day out. All types of sporting events to attend or participate in the area. San Francisco is a train ride away (SF can be a problem for parking). San Jose has an International airport within 10 minutes. Close to shopping at Santana Row and many other shops on Stevens Creek Blvd. The shopping location is part San Jose and part Santa Clara. Museums, Winchester House, Leviâ€™s stadium for games and concerts, Great America, theater plays movies within 5 minutes, music events, and wine tasting.\n\nThe Unique Benefits at this House:\n\nHouse has great location, is open, and has large backyard with a large patio. Park nearby."
