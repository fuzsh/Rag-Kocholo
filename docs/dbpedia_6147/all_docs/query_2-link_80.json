I feel extremely privileged and humbled to have been able to travel and live in another country for a full semester. I lived with an incredible host family that gave me cultural lessons every night during \"Once\" and reminded me of those universal family values that unite each and every one of us as human beings. I was able to explore the beautiful array of geographical wonders that Chile has to offer as well. I went sandboarding in the Atacama Desert, hiking in Patagonia, and surfing in Pichilemu. Those these sights were truly breathtaking, the thing I enjoyed most were the small moments with the various people I met in Chile. I met an amazing friend who worked in the IES building where I had my classes. Though I was still working on my Spanish, she was patient and so welcoming. We talked about our families, our pets, and our hopes and dreams. I also met my host-family's extended family who took me in like I was one of their own. We sat around all Saturday afternoon playing cards as I listened to old family memories and moments they had all shared together. Though I was in a country far from home, there was not much of a difference between the conversations at my dinner table in New Jersey and theirs that day in Val Paraíso. If anyone has the opportunity to study abroad in Santiago, I would 100% recommend it. I was challenged in the best way possible in daring to make relationships with different people from all walks of life and it made me realize how communication can really open up a whole new world.\n\nWhat is your advice to future travelers on this program?\n\nMy advice would be to just be open to all the new places and people you encounter. No one's experience is going to be exactly the same and that's what's so beautiful about living and just plain being in another country. Don't compare your experience to someone else's because every moment, good or bad, is so valuable. Take pictures of all the beautiful things but don't forget to be present with the people around you. Lastly, relax as best you can and take it all in. It's a beautiful place filled with a lot of beautiful people!\n\n107 people found this review helpful.\n\nAbena\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nA Rewarding Experience\n\nMy time in Chile was one I will never forget. The program was very comprehensive and formative for my career goals. I had the opportunity to observe a variety of healthcare professionals at work, which I had not done a lot of prior to my semester abroad. I had the opportunity to work with a community-based organization, which shaped the way I view the world and respond to health-related issues. Thus, I think that anyone interested in pursuing a career in healthcare and wants to learn medical Spanish should not overlook overlook this program.\n\nThe program center had recently undergone some renovations and I think that it provided my cohort with just the right resources and space. My group was small, so we got to know each other pretty quickly and often spent time together as a group. The staff was also very accommodating and planned a variety of field trips and experiences that really helped us engage with Chilean culture. Chile also has a very diverse terrain and I would encourage anyone who has the means to explore it to do so!\n\nIf you did this all over again, what's one thing you would change?\n\nI would budget better for trips outside of the city. I did not really think about leaving Santiago too much prior to my trip, so I did not plan accordingly to truly explore all that Chile has to offer. It is a beautiful country with a lot to offer (deserts, geothermal springs, mountains, etc.), so there's a little bit of everything for everyone, no matter what your interest are.\n\n119 people found this review helpful.\n\nTaylor\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\n!Siempre Chile!\n\nMy study abroad experience was incredible and I would encourage any student looking for a pre-health and Spanish speaking program to consider this one. I was able to learn about the health care of Chile while learning many medical terms and health-related topics in Spanish. On top of this, I gained shadowing experience in a public hospital of Santiago where I saw many different fascinating medical cases and surgeries, something most people don´t get the chance to do here in the US.\n\nOur group trips and personal trips around Chile were amazing and I experience things I had never done before such as canyoning, rafting, and holding a newborn lamb!\n\nI will never forget the people I was able to meet in my program and Chile. The bonds that were created are some that I will never forget.\n\nOverall, I could not have asked for a better experience abroad.\n\nWhat was the most unfamiliar thing you ate?\n\nChorillana- Chilean cuisine that consists of fries with meat, and a fried egg on top. It honestly sounded pretty weird at first but it was one of my favorite dishes there and something my group with get often when we went out.\n\n110 people found this review helpful.\n\nMarissa\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nThe most incredible experience of my life!\n\nThis program was more incredible than I could have imagined. I loved the life and energy in the city of Santiago, and lived a 5 minute walk from the IES center. My classes and professors were fantastic and taught me so much about culture, medicine, and helped me to improve my Spanish greatly. I loved being able to shadow medical professionals in the public hospital- I even befriended some surgeons and got to play tennis with them on the weekends! The program allowed a lot of weekend time so my friends and I took advantage of every opportunity to travel and explore all of the amazing nature and experiences Chile has to offer like surfing in Pichilemu, skiing in the Andes, sand boarding in the Atacama Desert, summiting a volcano in Pucón, and hiking through Patagonia after my program finished. I made some incredible friends, both from in my program and from the class I took at the local university with Chilean students. My abroad experience was the greatest experience of my life and I learned so much about culture, medicine, Spanish, travel, and about myself while in Chile with IES Abroad.\n\nWhat is your advice to future travelers on this program?\n\nI highly recommend taking every opportunity possible to travel! Chile has an amazing variety of climates and landscapes and traveling is super affordable there! Seeing all of the culture in smaller towns and getting to speak with Chileans from different towns and locations is an invaluable experience.\n\n118 people found this review helpful.\n\nIsabella\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nBest Summer Ever!\n\nI learned so much on this program! I now know more about the Chilean health system than I do about the United States system. I got 60 hours of hospital observation, including seeing many surgeries and the birth of a baby! All of my experiences in the hospital were completely in Spanish, which made it very intimidating at first. However, by the end I could understand everything happening around me and I loved it! I also made friendships that I know will last for the rest of my life. The IES Abroad center staff was so kind and genuinely cared that we had a great time, and I loved my host family. The city of Santiago now feels like a second home to me, and I can't wait to go back some day. I would recommend this program to anyone who wants to improve their Spanish, learn about medicine, and have a summer full of adventure!\n\nWhat is your advice to future travelers on this program?\n\nDon't be afraid to speak Spanish! The more you practice the better you'll be. And say yes to anything you're remotely interested in. Every experience can be life-changing!\n\n111 people found this review helpful.\n\nLauren\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nThe Best Summer of my Life!\n\nMy summer in Santiago, Chile as part of the IES Abroad Summer Health Studies Program was the most amazing summer of my life. There are several options for how/where to do your observations, and I chose to do them at the public hospital in Santiago. I got to shadow doctors of many different specialties and even got to see a few surgeries. I gained so much experience in the medical field and learned a ton of medical terminology in Spanish, a vital skill in our changing cultural landscape. The staff at the IES Abroad Center were so welcoming and more than willing to help you with anything, whether that was help with academics, travel safety tips, or just finding the best place to buy an empanada. Also, Chile is such an amazing and diverse country with amazing opportunity to travel on the weekends to places like the Atacama Desert or Easter Island. This program is PERFECT for those wanting to enter the health field AND learn medical Spanish that will be vital in your career. If you are wanting the most fun, challenging, and life-changing summer of your life while ALSO boosting your resume for medical school/career, this is the place to go. ¡Viva Chile!\n\nWhat is your advice to future travelers on this program?\n\nMy advice is to take advantage of all the amazing things Santiago and the entire country of Chile have to offer. Use your weekends to travel to amazing places like Santa Lucia in Santiago, or go to the Atacama Desert, Easter Island, or the Patagonia. Chile is such a diverse and beautiful country, so make sure you do your best to experience all it has to offer!\n\n116 people found this review helpful.\n\nRead my full story\n\nSara\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nA Program as Great as its City\n\nThe location of Santiago is just incredible. It's a cosmopolitan city between mountains with so much to see and do- whether you want to hike or go to a museum, eat Peruvian, Thai, or traditional Chilean food, spend a day in the park or be a real Santiaguino and venture to the markets- everything is accessible through public transportation. Just an hour and a half from the Pacific coast where you can relax on the beach or explore the grungy and colorful Valparaíso, it feels as though whatever you could want is within reach. I loved Santiago as a city and Chile as a country. As long as the U.S. is wide, the varying landscapes were unlike anything I had ever seen. From glaciers to deserts, Chile has it all.\n\nThe IES program that I participated in gave me the opportunity to not just experience this beautiful place, but make the most out of my time there in each and every sphere of my life. I had the time and encouragement to travel and get to know not just the city, but the region. I was challenged in my academic courses, from understanding the political and social role of the arts in Latin America to the radical traditions that define the nation today. I went into my study abroad experience knowing next to nothing about Chile and Latin America, and leaving with a true connection to the region that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. Besides the hard skills that I developed through my critical courses and hands-on internship experience, I also developed a higher social awareness, deepened my sense of empathy, and left with a level of confidence I didn't know I could have.\n\nThis program is great for people who are adventurous and curious, who want to learn and be challenged, and have a less traditional study abroad experience. I chose this program because I didn't want to go to Europe and I wanted to learn Spanish. I know a lot of people go to Europe because it's easy to travel around, but I was lucky to travel around a lot- around Chile, in Peru, and to Argentina twice- for comparable if not less expense. The things I saw were unlike any Roman cathedral or Grecian cave, but they put me in awe at the world we live in. Hiking through Valley de la Luna in the driest desert in the world made me feel like I was hiking through an episode of Planet Earth and the cities of Buenos Aires and Lima are equally as astonishing as Santiago. I can't stress enough how much I recommend this program and how badly I wish I was still a part of it every day.\n\nWhat was the most unfamiliar thing you ate?\n\nSea urchin right out of the water on the little island of Chiloé at a little seafood stand off the side of the highway. It tasted exactly how you think, but even saltier.\n\n115 people found this review helpful.\n\nBrianna\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nDiscovering yourself in Chile\n\nStudying abroad in Santiago, Chile was one of the best choices I have made in my life. I am a neuroscience major, but have always had a desire to become fluent in Spanish. For that reason, I decided to study in the Health Studies Program, to learn more about the health system in Chile, but also to fully immerse myself into a Spanish-speaking culture. This program allows students to take a seminar where they can choose between shadowing in hospitals and clinics, or intern at a Public Health organization in an underserved community. I decided to intern at the Public Health organization, and through that experience, was very inspired by the theory of Popular Education, and experienced first-hand the power and importance of community health. This experience for sure inspired me so much, and made me think a lot more about the type of career I would like in the future.\n\nIn addition to the educational aspect of the program, Chile was a great country to study in with the goal to learn Spanish. Even living in the capital city of Santiago, it was rare that you would enter a restaurant or mall and find someone who could, and would, speak english to you. Santiago is also a wonderful city to live in, which many beautiful parks, restaurants, and hills to hike. I also loved the nature that Chile has to offer, and simply by traveling outside of Santiago to these natural environments were very inspiring as they are beautiful settings to both challenge yourself and reflect on life.\n\nWhat is your advice to future travelers on this program?\n\nMy advice to future students for this study abroad program would be to fully immerse yourself into the Spanish-speaking culture. Studying abroad with other English-speaking students can sometimes prevent you from wanting to challenge yourself and speak the host-country's language, but take advantage of the opportunities to have conversations with your host family, attend events at the local University, or even travel alone and force yourself to speak Spanish.\n\n113 people found this review helpful.\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nQuestion\n\nAlumni Interviews\n\nThese are in-depth Q&A sessions with verified alumni.\n\nLauren Freije\n\nWhy did you choose this program?\n\nI wanted a program where I could improve my capabilities in Spanish and gain medical experience. This program offered both of those as I was able to learn Spanish in the classroom and through immersion while gaining medical experience by shadowing doctors in local hospitals. This program is the perfect program for students who want to learn Spanish and plan on entering the medical field.\n\nWhat did your program provider (or university) assist you with, and what did you have to organize on your own?\n\nMy program provider organized living arrangements and academics. We were all placed with host families in Santiago and lived fairly close to the IES Abroad Center. They also organized our academics by placing us at the correct level of Spanish and organizing our medical observations. They gave us plenty of safety tips and helped us to navigate the city by bus or subway. We were in charge of our own transportation to Santiago and had to book our own flights to arrive on the specified day.\n\nView Entire Interview\n\nWhat is one piece of advice you'd give to someone going on your program?\n\nStudying abroad will be both the most challenging and the most amazing experience of your life. Take advantage of all the amazing things that Chile has to offer and take advantage of all the resources that the IES Abroad Center and its staff have to offer.\n\nAlso, this program gives you the opportunity to observe medicine in a way that is not possible in the US until after medical school. Take advantage of that by asking tons of questions to discover what specialty of medicine you may want to enter in the future.\n\nWhat does an average day/week look like as a participant of this program?\n\nDuring a normal week, we would have a Spanish class two-three times a week and a seminar on the Chilean health system two times a week. We would also do our medical observations three times a week. Occasionally, there would be organized activities like a dance class, cooking class, or a cultural immersion activity.\n\nGoing into your experience abroad, what was your biggest fear, and how did you overcome it? How did your views on the issue change?\n\nMy biggest fear was that my Spanish would not be sufficient enough to be able to communicate in Chile. Luckily, being immersed in a language boosts your learning of that language immensely and I quickly became more proficient in communicating in Spanish. Looking back, I realize that rough patch at the beginning was all part of the process and now I am nearly fluent in Spanish.\n\nAny other tips for prospective travelers?\n\nSantiago is such a diverse and unique city. It is a beautiful mix of North American, South American, and European architecture and design. Some parts of the city were so modern and beautiful, while others were antique and elegant. Santiago is also the best place to go for foodies, as you can experience so many different types of ethnic foods. Santiago and the entire country of Chile have so much to offer so you have to make sure to take full advantage of it!\n\nOther Programs You Might Like\n\n103 reviews\n\n\n\n\n\nIES Abroad\n\nIES Abroad London\n\nEngland\n\n4.93 •103 reviews\n\nStudy abroad in London and discover all that this world-class, multi...\n\n99 reviews\n\n\n\n\n\nIES Abroad\n\nIES Abroad Madrid\n\nSpain\n\n4.94 •99 reviews\n\nMadrid will be your classroom.
