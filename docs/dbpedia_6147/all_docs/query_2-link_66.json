We are very sorry you had a bad family experience at our hotel. We completely understand your discomfort because your family could not stay at connected rooms. Unfortunately, we cannot warranty our guests connected rooms until the moment they Check In at our hotel, specially in high season. We apprecciate your understanding and we hope to host you again and offer you a stay that exceeds your expectations. Receive our warmest greetings. Sincerely, Rebeca Lara Customer Service PULLMAN SANTIAGO VITACURA\n\nIn general, it was good. Many of their staffs are friendly and kind. However, some of them are not well trained, particularly at the reception. When checking in, we waited for a while, because group tour people were checking in just before us. So, it was understandable, but after this long waiting time, they never mention to this. In most cases of other hotels, like Marriot group or IHG groups, they will give some words regarding such a wating time. Besides, they didn't give any information regarding the fundamental services of the hotel, e.g. lift location, restaurant location and service hours, breakfast location and avaiable time, etc. Even when checking out, they didn't try to even ask whether I need an invoice or not, until I requested them to issue. During the stay, there is a day that they didn't clean up my room although I left my room befor 11am by hanging \"make up request tag\" on the door and came back after 4pm. Other than these, many of staffs are nice and give us a good quality of services. The point is the quality of their service depends on staffs. This is what I hope they improve.\n\nDear Matt. We appreciate the time you have taken to answer our satisfaction survey. We are truly sorry you did not have a good experience during your stay at our hotel, because of the service our staff offered you. We will share you valuable feedback with all our team so we can improve the training of our staff and the service they offer to our guest's. We offer you our deepest apologies again, and aprecciate your comments. Receive our warmest greetings. Sincerely, Rebeca Lara Welcomer PULLMAN SANTIAGO VITACURA"
