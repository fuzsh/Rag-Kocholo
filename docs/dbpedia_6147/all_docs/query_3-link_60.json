I was challenged by a reader comment to give my own take on the Personal Hedgehog idea and how I was working on it. I've given a full reply over at our new corporate blog at Modus Cooperandi. It's appropriate because it is indeed the formation of Modus Cooperandi that represents the realization of my own Personal Hedgehog Concept.

I've added my APLN Board Membership to my resume and my LinkedIn Profile.

Currently, that means planning the forthcoming APLN Leadership Summit in Seattle....\n\nAn Open Source Digital Kanban Board for TFS\n\nI'm sure more than a few of my readers will be interested in this.

Chris Matts is presenting Real Options on the same morning and this is great opportunity to see us both on the same day and understand how kanban and real options combine as a very powerful solution for scheduling and prioritization for optimal value delivery. Please support the APLN by signing up for the conference and coming along...\n\nPurging the Kanban Backlog\n\nOne of the PM's in our office calls it a \"clean out.\" From time to time you should purge your kanban backlog to keep it fresh and relevant. The backlog is either a set of requirements for a project or program or a set of change requests for a sustaining engineering effort. There will always be new backlog incoming as the business changes and people have new ideas. Depending on this incoming rate compared to throughput of software delivery, the...\n\nEnterprise Scale Continuous Integration\n\nBack in January when I spoke at the OOP conference in Munich, I described how I didn't believe that continuous integration scaled to enterprise level. Indeed, we hadn't managed to make it work. What we were doing was taking a more Lean approach to integration - little and often - and moving to fewer codelines. We were achieving this by implementing latent code patterns that enabled several projects to live in the same environment and avoid the problem of new...\n\nBugs and Kanban\n\nCorey Ladas takes a look at two ways to treat bugs in a kanban system. The second option is the more challenging. It requires patient courageous management. My feeling is that option 2 will produce the net higher velocity (and throughput) in the long term because it teaches the team to really focus down on prevention of bugs while option 1 treats bugs as part and parcel of the business of software development. While option 1 will suffer a throughput...\n\nThe Chinese view of India\n\nIn San Francisco, the only North American city hosting the torch, officials shortened the April 9 route through the city and have abbreviated the ceremonies.

Unfortunately, Feedburner will only forward a feed for 30 days and many RSS readers don't seem process permanent redirects well (change the URL permanently, not just follow it). As a result, you might not be seeing updated IT Conversations shows in your favorite podcatcher.

I must have lost my poker face, because he chuckled and said, “Well, you do what you can with that many projects.” You do. And I don’t buy that you’re actually managing them, or more than one of them. Sure, you might be doing damage control, or helping people see that they have a disaster.
