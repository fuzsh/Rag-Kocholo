        "text": "The Palacio de la Real Audiencia y Cajas Reales, also known as Palacio de la Real Audiencia or Palacio de las Cajas, or Palacio de la Independencia, is a historical building located in the north-central sidewalk of the Plaza de Armas in Santiago de Chile. The building, which dates back to 1808, has been the home of the National History Museum of Chile since 1982. It is situated on part of the land that once belonged to Pedro de Valdivia, facing the Plaza de Armas of Santiago.\n\nArchitectural Style and Historical Events\n\nThe building was inaugurated in 1808, showcasing a neoclassical architectural style. It was built by Juan José de Goycolea y Zañartu between 1804 and 1808. The building became the epicenter of political events during the beginning of the Independence, housing the First National Congress in 1811, and the government house during the Patria Vieja, between 1812 to 1814.\n\nDeclaration as a National Monument\n\nOn December 1, 1969, the building was declared a National Monument due to its historical and architectural merits. Years later, it was taken over by the National History Museum, which reconstructed it between 1978 and 1982, restoring its original features and adapting it to house its collections and dependencies."
