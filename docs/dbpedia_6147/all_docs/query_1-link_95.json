        "meta_description": "There have been a number of major acquisitions in the security space in the past two years, including Hewlett-Packard purchasing ArcSight for $1.6 billion, Symantec acquiring Verisign for $1.3 billion, Apax Partners buying Sophos for $580 million in 2010, and chip giant Intel stepping into the security business by scooping up McAfee for $7.8 billion. The Intel-McAfee deal, announced in 2010 but completed in February this year, was just a hint of how traditionally nonsecurity-focused companies would snap up security companies in 2011. Sometimes a technology buy and other times a way to sign on renowned security experts, the deals signaled how organizations were prioritizing security and privacy. High-profile security breaches, malware outbreaks and privacy scandals dominated news headlines in 2011 as attackers targeted governments, small and large enterprises, and individual consumers. The Federal Trade Commission and Congress took technology companies to task over securing user privacy. Global cyber-security spending in 2011 reached $60 billion and is expected to grow 10 percent every year for the next three to five years, according to the \"Cyber-Security M&A\" report released by PwC recently. Below, eWEEK has put together a baker's dozen (plus one) notable security-related deals announced in 2011.",

        "text": "3IBM—Q1 Labs\n\nIBM in October announced its plans to buy Q1 Labs, a data-analytics software company. Q1 Labs specialized in security information and event management, the ability to gather data about what is happening in the network and correlate it to detect and flag suspicious events. Q1 Labs became part of the newly minted IBM Security Systems unit, joining other security companies Big Blue had snapped up over the years.\n\n14Motorola—3LM\n\nThis one is actually a bonus, as the company actually closed the deal at the end of 2010, but Motorola did not make the announcement until February. Startup Three Laws Mobility developed mobile enterprise security software and solutions and mobile device management products for Android to give IT departments the tools they need to manage Android devices within corporate environments.\n\nProperty of TechnologyAdvice.\n\n© 2024 TechnologyAdvice.
