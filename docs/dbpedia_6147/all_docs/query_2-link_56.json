        "text": "Chile is described as having three geographical areas. The first one, continental Chile, is a long strip of land that runs down the western side of the Southern Cone, extending between parallels 17°29'57\"\" S and 56°32'12\"\" S, mainly from the south-eastern banks of the Pacific Ocean to the highest peaks of the Cordillera de los Andes. It spans 4,270 km (2,653 miles) long, a maximum width of 445 km (276 miles) at 52°21' S and a minimum width of 90 km (56 miles) at 31°37' S. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast and Argentina to the east, totaling 7,801 km (4,847 miles) of land borders, and the Drake Passage to the south.\n\nThe second area, insular Chile, is a set of islands of volcanic origin in the South Pacific Ocean: the Juan Fernández Archipelago and the Desventuradas Islands, belonging to South America, and Salas y Gómez Island and Easter Island, located in Oceania.\n\nThe third area, Chilean Antarctic Territory, is an area of Antarctica covering 1.250,257,6 km² (7,768,738 sq mi) between the meridians of 53° O and 90° O, over which Chile claims sovereignty, extending its southern border up to the South Pole. This claim was suspended according to the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty to which Chile is a signatory party. As a result, Chile defines itself as a tri-continental country.\n\nChile’s coastline is 6,435 km (4,000 miles) long and exercises exclusive rights, claims in varying degrees, and sovereignty over a maritime area known as the Chilean Sea. This includes four areas: the territorial sea (120,827 km2), the adjacent area (131,669 km2), the exclusive economic area (3,681,989 km2), and the corresponding continental platform (161,338 km2)."
