To solve most non-standard issues, Technical Support requests that you generate an Analytic Package. This article describes the different ways to generate an Analytic Package.\n\nTo generate a Sensor Analytic package from the server console:\n\nThis method is the preferred way to generate a Sensor Analytic Package because it collects additional information that isn't available through other methods. This option is available only when the Sensor is connected to the server. If the Sensor isn't connected to the server, the option isn't available through the management console.\n\nLog on to the management console.\n\nClick the Sensors tab, and then click the Properties icon in the Sensor row.\n\nIn the Sensor properties, you can choose to change the Logging level of Sensor log from INFO to DEBUG.\n\nClick Generate.\n\nDownload and save the file to your workstation.\n\nTo manually generate a Sensor Analytic package (not through the server):\n\nWhen the Sensor isn't connected to the server, the only way to generate a Sensor Analytic package is locally, from the location where the Sensor is installed. Perform the appropriate steps for your operating system:\n\nWindows\n\nNavigate to the Sensor installation directory.\n\nRight-click the Analytics.exe file and click Run as Administrator.\n\nSend the output file analytics_XXXX_XXXXX.zip to Technical Support. (The value XXXX_XXXXX is the system date.)\n\nLinux\n\nFor Trellix:\n\nRun the following command:\n\n/sbin/service mfe-dbs-sensor create_analytic_package\n\nSend the output file to Technical Support.\n\nFor Sentrigo:\n\nRun the following command:\n\n/etc/init.d/sentrigo-sensor create_analytic_package\n\nSend the output file to Technical Support.\n\nSolaris\n\nFor Trellix:​\n\nRun the following command:\n\n/etc/init.d/mfe-dbs-sensor create_analytic_package\n\nSend the output file to Technical Support.\n\nFor Sentrigo:\n\nRun the following command:\n\n/etc/init.d/sentrigo-sensor create_analytic_package\n\nSend the output file to Technical Support.\n\nAIX\n\nFor Trellix:\n\n1. Run the following command:\n\n/etc/rc.d/init.d/mfe-dbs-sensor create_analytic_package\n\n2. Send the output file to Technical Support.\n\nFor Sentrigo:\n\n1. Run the following command:\n\n/etc/rc.d/init.d/sentrigo-sensor create_analytic_package\n\n2. Send the output file to Technical Support.\n\nHP-UX\n\nFor Trellix:\n\n1. Run the following command:\n\n/sbin/init.d/mfe-dbs-sensor create_analytic_package\n\n2. Send the output file to Technical Support.\n\nFor Sentrigo:\n\nRun the following command:\n\n/sbin/init.d/sentrigo-sensor create_analytic_package\n\nSend the output file to Technical Support.\n\nAffected Products\n\nLanguages:\n\nThis article is available in the following languages:"
