        "text": "Today, AWS announced the opening of a new AWS Direct Connect location within the Sonda Quilicura Q2 data center in Santiago, Chile. By connecting your network to AWS at the new location, you gain private, direct access to all public AWS Regions (except those in China), AWS GovCloud Regions, and AWS Local Zones.\n\nThe new Santiago location offers dedicated 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps connections, with MACsec encryption available for 10 Gbps. Using this new Direct Connect location to reach resources running in the Santiago AWS Local Zone is an ideal solution for applications that require single-digit millisecond latency or local data processing.\n\nThe Direct Connect service establishes a private, physical network connection between AWS and your data center, office, or colocation environment. These private connections can provide a more consistent network experience than those made over the public internet.\n\nFor more information on the over 115 Direct Connect locations worldwide, visit the locations section of the Direct Connect product detail pages. Or, visit our getting started page to learn more about how to purchase and deploy Direct Connect."
