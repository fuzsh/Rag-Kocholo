        "text": "Some hotels are transformational. Stepping in from the chaos of downtown Santiago – accentuated by the toots of taxis, and those of mopeds trying to overtake them – the concierge pushes open the tall, heavy wooden doors to usher you into a very different world. Jazz music spins around the lobby which is handsomely decked out with leather chairs and retro lampshades. It has a distinctively 1920s vibe to it; what I imagine the reading room of F.Scott Fitzgerald might look like – piles of beautifully bound leather books and a bar.\n\nWithin a moment of being inside the Singular I’ve reached an inner peace; almost entirely forgetting the bewildering airport immigration queues and traffic getting here. I’m smiling, and I feel quite at home. There’s an old school glamour here, which is a rare find in South America. The decadent interiors with frosted mirrors and softly lit chandeliers could be right out of a Ferrero Rocher advert. This little fantasy of mine becomes a reality as the suited and booted receptionist offers Mr Smith and I a chocolate, opening a pearl case on the desk. Monsieur – or Señor – is certainly spoiling us.\n\nHaving checked into our spacious and tastefully appointed room, Mr Smith and I begin to investigate. The gym downstairs is so modern and clean that I might actually consider using it. The mood lighting and warm scented air seeping from the spa area is a silent siren to my tired, travel-weary limbs. (It doesn’t take more than five minutes for us to return in robes.)\n\nBut it’s the rooftop bar and pool area that holds the most allure. With a view over the mountains and monochrome architecture of modern Santiago, you’re surrounded by an eye-catching cityscape that acts as a gentle reminder that, although you may be cocooned in the stylish setting of the Singular, there’s a big city to discover outdoors.\n\nMr Smith and I agree that we really ought to stretch our legs that afternoon. Right on the doorstep of the hotel is the historic Lastarria neighbourhood – a neat collection of cobbled streets lined with artisans selling their wares, a handful of colourful restaurants, bars and art galleries, and traditional buildings with ornately carved wooden balconies. The lush, green mound of Santa Lucía hill overlooks the streets and marks the foundation of the city in 1540. This has always been the most affluent region of Santiago, and continues to have that aristocratic yet bohemian feel today. It’s easy to see why the Singular chose to open doors here: it’s the quintessential Santiago neighbourhood.\n\nThe concierge helps us shortlist a few spots for dinner later but we decide to head to the rooftop bar for a sundowner first. So drawn in are we by the cocktails, the crab empanadas, the delicious cheeseboard and charcuterie, that we decide to stay. The evening is warm and the Santiago skyline is inviting. Beyond, the Andes mountains are blushing under the sunset, their stony cheeks turning shades of deep purple as the sky turns a flaming red and orange. It’s quite the show, and we have front row seats – with bar service.\n\nWe hit our high thread-count sheets early, and sleep late into the next morning – the blackout curtains leaving us unperturbed by the city waking up outside. Breakfast is a veritable banquet of freshly baked pastries, fresh fruits, cold cuts and creamy Chilean avocado. Eggs are how you like them – Mr Smith goes scrambled, and I ask for my personal favourite, and the true litmus test of a good hotel, Eggs Benedict. Delicate portions arrive with presentational flair. We both approve, and order more coffee."
