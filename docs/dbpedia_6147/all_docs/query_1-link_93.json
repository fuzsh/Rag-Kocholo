        "text": "Israeli cyber security company Demisto has raised $6 million in a Series A financing round from Accel, Cylance CEO Stuart McClure, Lookout CTO Kevin Mahaffey and Blue Coat Systems president Mike Fey. The new funding will be used to expand sales and marketing efforts, and to grow partner ecosystem integrations.\n\nThe company also announced the availability of its Demisto Enterprise security bot.\n\nWith offices in Tel Aviv and Cupertino, California, Demisto was founded in July 2015 by CEO Slavik Markovich (formerly of Intel Security, McAfee and co-founder and CTO of Sentrigo), VP marketing Rishi Bhargava (formerly of Intel Security, McAfee and Solidcore); VP products, Dan Sarel (formerly of Intel Security, McAfee, Sentrigo and Check Point); and VP engineering, Guy Rinat (formerly of Intel Security, McAfee and Sentrigo).\n\nThe founders set out to address the biggest pain point facing Security Operations teams - the ever widening security talent and skills gap combined with the lack of automation across security tools. After exploring how areas such as IT operations and DevOps are solving similar issues, the Demisto team realized that building the industry’s first chat-driven, bot-powered interface for security would best address these problems.\n\nMarkovich said, “We are on a mission to make the life of security operations analysts productive and impactful while helping scale scarce security talent for our customers. We are already hearing from our early customers that a ChatBot-based approach to automating security operations, documenting entire incident lifecycle, and enhancing collaboration goes above and beyond security automation to create a better security operations center for them.” “The Security Operations Center is supposed to be the brain of the security organization yet the tools used to empower this organization are disjointed,” said Jake Flomenberg, a partner at Accel who joins Demisto’s board as part of this investment. “Demisto brings a unique and fresh approach to this problem by combining collaboration and automation to allow security analysts to do their job more efficiently and effectively.”\n\nPublished by Globes [online], Israel business news - www.globes-online.com - on May 25, 2016"
