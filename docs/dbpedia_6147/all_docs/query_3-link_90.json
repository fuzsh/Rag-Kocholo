Don’t have any fear as this session is for you! Social networking can be a very confusing place and when you don’t know where to start, that makes it even worse. In this session, we will go over different facets of Social Networking and how you can use them to enhance not only your personal lives but just as importantly, your professional one. We’ll be covering Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nJohn Morehouse\n\nTrack and Room: Misc Track - N/A\n\nTitle: Advanced SQL Injection techniques\n\nAbstract: SQL injection remains one of the most widely-used tactics used by hackers to exploit security vulnerabilities of databases in order to get at sensitive information or to gain further system access to wreak havoc with more attacks. Though the majority of SQL injections are fairly simple and familiar, the more advanced ones can evade detection by some conventional security measures. I will offer up an in-depth analysis of some sophisticated SQL injection hacks and attacks, and offer up some best practices on how to harden your applications and databases against them in order to keep business-critical information safe.\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nSlavik Markovich\n\nTrack and Room: SQL Dev Track - N/A\n\nTitle: But it worked great in Dev! Perfomance for Devs\n\nAbstract: If you’ve ever found yourself stating the above, this session is for you. For many developers, writing T-SQL that works is not the challenge. But too often, functional T-SQL is not the same as good T-SQL. In this session, we will examine why “SQL that works” is not good enough. Understanding indexes, exectuion plans, sargability, and more are all critical to writing good T-SQL. We will also examine several real-world examples of T-SQL that “worked great in dev” but caused major issues when it hit production.\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nRandy Knight\n\nTrack and Room: SQL Dev Track - N/A\n\nTitle: Replication Basics\n\nAbstract: Let’s cover the basics of setting up and monitoring SQL server Replication.
