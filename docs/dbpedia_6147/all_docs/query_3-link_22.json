        "text": "Sentrigo, Inc., a database security software provider, has announced the latest version of its database vulnerability assessment and security scanning software solution. The new release, Repscan 4.0, available with more flexible pricing options, offers support for additional database platforms, productivity enhancements for database administrators (DBAs), and added management capabilities.\n\nRepscan 4.0 expands platform support by including capabilities for scanning of Sybase ASE systems, extending the breadth of platforms which already included Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and IBM DB2.\n\nIn addition, among the new platforms supported by Repscan 4.0 is Microsoft SQL Azure Database, a cloud-based relational database service built on SQL Server technologies that provides a highly available, scalable, multi-tenant database service hosted by Microsoft in the cloud. According to Sentrigo, its support for the Microsoft SQL Azure platform represents the first database vulnerability assessment solution to test against the cloud-based database, and further assists organizations by providing a more secure environment in which to leverage the benefits of cloud computing.\n\nWith Repscan 4.0, Sentrigo also expands its support for open source databases with the addition of PostgreSQL, a widely-deployed open source database system. Support for MySQL was added in the previous release of Repscan, introduced this past June."
