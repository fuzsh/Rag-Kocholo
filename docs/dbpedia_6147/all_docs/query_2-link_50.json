        "text": "2024 ACM SIGMOD/PODS @Santiago, Chile\n\nWelcome\n\nWelcome to the home of the 2024 ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference, to be held in Santiago, Chile, on June 9 - June 14, 2024.\n\nThe Conference. The annual ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. The conference includes a fascinating technical program with research and industrial talks, tutorials, demos, and focused workshops. It also hosts a poster session to learn about innovative technology, an industrial exhibition to meet companies and publishers, and a careers-in-industry panel with representatives from leading companies.\n\nThe Santiago de Chile Area. Nestled in a plain of small valleys and coastal destinations, central Chile stands out as one of the most populated areas and surprises with the assortment of activities that can be performed, from the mountains to the beach. Santiago is a distinguished city in cultural, gastronomic, and socio-political terms. It is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the region, represented in the culture of the city, and mainly in its cuisine, which has positioned itself among the most varied in the region. While in Chile there is a lot to do, from the extreme north with the driest desert in the world to the austral south with eternal ice and inverted waterfalls, Chile is an invitation hard to refuse.\n\nThe Conference Hotel. The conference will be held in the Intercontinental Santiago Hotel. The conference venue is located on Santiagoâs Eastside, in the El Golf sector â known as the new financial, commercial and gastronomic center of the capital of Chile â in the Las Condes commune. Its location allows you to reach the center of Santiago in 20 minutes and the airport in 15 minutes. You can access ski resorts in 45 minutes and the Pacific coast in less than two hours.\n\nThe Conference Format. Please refer to Conference Format for more details about how the conference will be organized.\n\nSIGMOD/PODS 2024 Anti-Harassment Policy\n\nSIGMOD 2024 adheres to the ACM Policy Against Harassment.
