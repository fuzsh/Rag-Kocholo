        "text": "Today’s Video of the Day from the European Space Agency features Santiago, the capital city of Chile. The city is located in the center of the Santiago Metropolitan Region, which has a population of about eight million people.\n\n‘The weather of Santiago resembles the Mediterranean climate with dry and warm summers with temperatures reaching up to 35°C (from October to March) and cool and humid winters that can drop to 0°C (from April to September).”\n\n“The city lies in the centre of the country’s central valley around 80 km from the Pacific Ocean to the west and borders Argentina to the east. A tiny part of Argentina is visible in the top-right corner of the image where the mountain crest of the Andes Mountains acts as a divider between the two countries,” says ESA.\n\nVideo/ Image Credit: ESA\n\n–—\n\nBy Chrissy Sexton, Earth.com Editor"
