        "text": "April 5, 1997\n\nParque Bustamante (Bustamante Park) station, a facility of Line 5 of the Chilean rapid transit system known as the Santiago Metro, first went into service in the commune of Providencia in the vicinity of Chile’s capital city of Santiago. This underground station owes its name to the urban park that is located right above it.\n\nParque Bustamante station was one of a dozen stations to be opened on the same date as part of the inaugural section of Line 5. The dedication of this segment of the Santiago Metro took place at Bellavista de La Florida, station, which was the southern terminus of Line 5 until the opening of the Vincent Valdés station in 2005. Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, who served as president of Chile from 1994 to 2000, officiated at that dedication.\n\nA notable design feature of Parque Bustamante station is its artwork, which includes “The Place of Things,” created by Pablo Rivera; and “Life and Work: The Eyes and Hands of Effort,” created by Alejandro González.\n\nLine 5 now encompasses 30 metro stations and 18.5 miles (29.7 kilometers) altogether. The Santiago Metro in its entirety encompasses a total of seven lines, 143 metro stations, and 92.6 miles (149 kilometers).\n\nPhoto Credit: Eduardo Villagrán (licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic license at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/deed.en)"
