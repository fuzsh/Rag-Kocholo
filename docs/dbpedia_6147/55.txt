Sentrigo, Inc., a Santa Clara, CA-based provider of data protection solutions for the datacenter and the cloud, has secured $6m in a Series C funding round.

Investors include existing shareholders Benchmark Capital and Stata Venture Partners, and new strategic partner Juniper Networks, via the Junos® Innovation Fund.

The company intends to use the new capital to increase global sales and marketing activities, as well as to continue expanding its database security and data integrity solutions for the cloud.

Sentrigo’s suite of database security and compliance solutions includes components for vulnerability assessment, real-time monitoring, virtual patching and low-overhead audit. Its products monitor database threats and activity locally on each database server, allowing efficient and effective operation regardless of the deployment model.

The company’s flagship product, Sentrigo Hedgehog Enterprise is designed to protect sensitive data either on premises or in the cloud, from both external attacks as well as misuse by privileged insiders, addressing critical issues related to compliance audits for key industry regulations.

Led by CEO Nathan Shuchami, the company is a member of the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA).
