Please send a bug report!\n\nThis includes details on your browser/OS, and a list of the last edits you made on the map, so that I can reproduce the issue:\n\nTo send it, you can:\n\nEmail the report to [email protected] or use the Feedback page.\n\nSend it anonymously.... Note that, this way, I won't be able to get back to you.\n\nIf you send via email, please consider adding a screenshot to your report.\n\nPlease describe what went wrong and hit Send:\n\nReport sent successfully. Thank you for the feedback!\n\nYou recently sent an anonymous report. Please wait a few minutes before sending again.\n\nWhat is this?\n\nWhen you color a province with a pattern (dots, stripes, etc.), the pattern by default gets scaled (resized) to fit its size. You can change this to use nonscaling patterns that look the same on all provinces. Examples:\n\nScaling (default)\n\nNonscaling\n\nWhat to choose?\n\nIt can depend on the map or the patterns/colors you select, but generally:\n\nScaling patterns (default) are better for maps with small subdivisions, like the detailed maps or the US counties map.\n\nScaling patterns (default) are better for zoomed in areas.\n\nNonscaling patterns can look better for maps with larger subdivisions, like the simple World map or the US states map.\n\nNonscaling patterns can look better when you have a small number of patterns in your map, as they stand out more.\n\nIn any case, you can switch this setting on/off as many times as you need to see the difference live on your map. More details on the blog.\n\nControl Hold and move your mouse over the map to quickly color several provinces.∗ Control + Shift Hold and move your mouse over the map to quickly uncolor several provinces.∗ Shift Hold and click on a province to quickly remove its color.∗ C Open the Select Color dialog to quickly choose a color. F Pick a color from the map. S Use single-clicking on the map to color. R Select and color using a rectangle. E Select and color using an ellipse. P Select and color using a polygon. B Turn borders on/off. 1 - 9 Select the corresponding legend color (1 for the first, 2 for the second, etc.)\n\nZ Activate Zoom Mode. Press again to deactivate. Esc Deactivate Zoom Mode. Control + Z Undo last action. Control + Y Redo last action. Control + S Save current map settings. Control + Shift + S Open the Save As... dialog (Plus only). Alt + D Download map. Control + Esc Clear all.\n\n∗ Change this behavior in Advanced settings.\n\nRight-click on a province to remove its color or pattern, copy a color/pattern from another province, show, or hide it.\n\nIn the legend table, click on a color box to change the color for all provinces in the group. Right-click on it to select the color again or use the numpad keys 1 to 9.\n\nUse to detach and move the color picker around the page.\n\nFind all your saved map configurations below.\n\nLoading a configuration replaces your current map. Use Undo to go back if needed.\n\n* Showing configurations from compatible maps (e.g. from the Europe map, if you are on a world map page).\n\nUse your mouse wheel to zoom in/out:\n\nClick and drag to move the map around:\n\nDouble-click to zoom in.\n\nUse the keyboard shortcuts I O or + - to zoom in/out and W A S D or the keyboard arrows to move the map.\n\nUse the controls at the bottom right of the map for the same functions.\n\nClick on Reset or use R to set the map to its initial zoom.\n\nClick on EXIT ZOOM or use Esc to stop the zoom tool.\n\nWhile in zoom mode, you can still edit the map, change colors, etc.\n\nAdd a title for the map's legend and choose a label for each color group. Change the color for all provinces in a group by clicking on it.\n\nDrag the legend on the map to set its position or resize it.
