        "text": "Thomas De Witt Talmage had a very successful ministry at the Brooklyn Tabernacle in New York. But the congregation was challenged by the occasions when their building was destroyed by fire, not once, but three times — in 1872, 1889, and 1894. After the third conflagration, Talmage retired from that pastorate. As he began a trip around the world, he wrote to his friends: “Our church has again been halted by a sword of flame. The destruction of the first Brooklyn Tabernacle was a mystery. The destruction of the second a greater profound. This third calamity we adjourn to the Judgment Day for explanation. The home of a vast multitude of souls, it has become a heap of ashes. Whether it will ever rise again is a prophecy we will not undertake. God rules and reigns and makes no mistake. He has his way with churches as with individuals. One thing is certain; the pastor of Brooklyn Tabernacle will continue to preach as long as life and health last. We have no anxieties about a place to preach in. But woe is unto us if we preach not the Gospel! We ask for the prayers of all good people for the pastor and people of Brooklyn Tabernacle.”\n\n(Receive our blog posts in your email by clicking here.

Dr. Shedd hastened to the Russian Consulate and found it already dismantled and everybody getting ready to leave. It was evident there was no help from the Russians and taking leave of the Consul with the words, ''Panah ba Khuda,” ''Refuge with God,\" he returned to the city. — Mary Lewis Shedd, writing of her husband in the midst of events in Urmia, Persia (now Iran), on January 1, 1915, as the Armenian genocide was unfolding, in The Measure of a Man: The Life of William Ambrose Shedd, Missionary to Persia (1922), p. 141.\n\nAmerican Presbyterian missionaries to Persia were deeply affected by the events connected with the political situation resulting from World War I, including what has come to be known as the Armenian Genocide, a term first used officially today (April 24, 2021) by an American President, Joseph Biden, on Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day.\n\nThe story is told from the perspective of missionaries on the ground, such as William Ambrose Shedd and his wife Mary Lewis Shedd, and others including Mary A. Schauffler Labaree Platt, author of The War Journal of a Missionary in Persia (1915), and Frederick G. Coan, author of Yesterdays in Persia and Kurdistan (1939) [not yet available on Log College Press, but hopefully soon]. Coan’s 1918 account of some aspects of the genocide is particularly gripping.\n\nSimonetta Carr published a very helpful sketch last year of these tragic events as they relate to the Shedds which is available here. The atrocities are heart-breaking to read about. It is estimated that around 1 million Armenians were slaughtered. Many American Presbyterians were eyewitnesses to the horrors of massacre and war resulting in the shedding of much innocent blood. It was a time of grief and sadness, but also a time of courage and of prayer in the midst of suffering. But we do well to harken to the words (which Simonetta has highlighted, found in Mary L. Shedd, The Measure of a Man: The Life of William Ambrose Shedd, Missionary to Persia (1922), p. 280) of Rev. Shedd, who wrote in 1916:\n\nIt lies with us to see that the blood shed and the suffering endured are not in vain. May God grant and may we who know so well the wrongs that have been borne, so labor that the cause of these wrongs be removed. That will be done when Christ rules in the hearts of those who profess His name and is acknowledged by all, not merely as a great prophet but as the Saviour for Whose coming prophecy prepared the way, Who is the fulfillment of revelation, and in Whom human destiny will find its goal.\n\n(Receive our blog posts in your email by clicking here.

Rev. Benjamin Woods Labaree and his servant Israel were killed by a band of Kurds near Urmia. It was “the first murder in the mission’s seventy-year history. The motive was either religious or racial hatred, combined with robbery” (Susan M. Stein, On Distant Service: The Life of the First U.S. Foreign Service Officer to Be Assassinated, p. 218).\n\nLabaree was the son of American Presbyterian missionary to Persia Benjamin Labaree. The account of his death (by repeated dagger blows) is given in a letter by the younger Labaree’s wife, Mary A. Schauffler Labaree Platt (she later remarried). He, his servant, and another male missionary set off from Urmia to escort two female missionaries to the city of Khoy. It was on the return trip that their journey left “this mortal coil.” The timeline of events relating to Labaree’s death is given by the editor of Woman’s Work for Woman.\n\nMarch 4.—Mr. Labaree left Urumia in charge of a party of several persons bound for Khoi.\n\nMarch 9.— Murder of Mr. Labaree and servant, by a Persian and three Kurds.\n\nMarch 10 or 11. — Rev. Wm. Shedd with escort of soldiers went to Ula to bring the bodies of the dead to Urumia.\n\nMarch 11. — The Governor of Urumia sent a long, sympathetic telegram from Tabriz, assuring Dr. Cochran that he would heartily do all in his power to find the murderers.\n\nMarch 14. — Funeral at the College, one mile and a half outside the city, and burial at Seir, six miles farther out.\n\nAccounts of this tragedy may be found in Robert Elliott Speer’s biography of Joseph Plumb Cochran, “The Hakim Sahib\",” The Foreign Doctor: A Biography of Joseph Plumb Cochran, M.D., of Persia (1911); and Mary Lewis Shedd’s biography of her husband, The Measure of a Man: The Life of William Ambrose Shedd, Missionary to Persia (1922). William A. Shedd dedicated his book Islam and the Oriental Churches (1908) to the memory of B.W. Labaree, “who met a cruel death, Salmas, Persia, March Ninth, MCMIV - a true friend and devoted missionary.”\n\nHis widow wrote days after the sad event:\n\nGod is very close to us and His help is real and wonderful. As I realize more and more what He is to me, it makes my whole heart yearn to teach these people of this poor, wicked land to know Him. Do not grieve and mourn too much for us, dear ones, but pray that we may be able to bear it and that this overwhelming sorrow may be to the glory of God.\n\nLater, when some came to offer her condolences and in so doing cursed the murderers of her husband, “She cried out, ‘O how your words hurt ! Every one is a dagger to my broken heart. My children and I are praying that God may revenge us by changing the hearts of those men and saving them from eternal death. We are praying as our Master did for His enemies, 'Forgive them,' for they knew not what they did. It is my comfort to believe that out of this great sorrow shall come that great blessing’\" (Elwood Morris Wherry, Methods of Mission Work Among Moslems, p. 112).\n\nB.W. Labaree’s younger brother, Robert McEwan Labaree, after learning of the tragedy, volunteered to serve as a missionary to Persia in his place. After many years of service in that mission field, he went on to become a highly respected professor at Lincoln University near Oxford, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn July 1904, Seyid Ghaffar, the accused murderer, was captured and incarcerated. He claimed a lineal descent from the Prophet Muhammad, and so the local authorities were unwilling to execute him for his crime (he was also accused of killing another British citizen on a separate occasion), but he died in prison several years later. Other members of his band were captured but did not stay in prison long.\n\nThe Labaree Memorial Church in Urmia was erected in 1906 in memory of the martyred missionary. B.W. Labaree’s legacy has inspired many over the years to pray and labor for the cause of Christianity in the Middle East. The example of forgiveness by his widow is a powerful witness to the grace of God toward sinners. May we continue to honor the legacy of the missionary martyr and his widow with our prayers and labors today."
