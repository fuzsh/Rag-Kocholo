It can write blog posts, emails, press releases, interview questions, scriptsâ¦the list goes on. There are many ways creators can use ChatGPT to remove guesswork, improve their workflows, and grow their audience.Â You just need the right prompts. Think Mad Libs, but for content production.Â\n\nIn this article, we'll give you more than 100 prompts and advanced workflows for podcast and video production, including scriptwriting, storyboarding, content planning, social networking, email composing â basically, all the stuff you have to do before you do the stuff you get to do. That's what AI is there for.\n\nOne caveat: ChatGPT has some limitations you should be aware of. First, it canât verify facts, so you need to fact-check any research it does for you. Second, its training data stops in 2021, so itâs unaware of current events or trends.Â\n\nKnowing that, thereâs a whole lot ChatGPT can do. So letâs start doing it. Click the links below to jump to that section in the article.\n\nSpeed up your creative workflow\n\nGrow your following, get guests, and build an audience\n\nChatGPT for video creators: YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and more\n\nChatGPT for your podcast\n\nAdvanced tips\n\nWords to get you started\n\nThe following prompts are simple enough â just fill in the blanks and youâre off to the races. But for times when filling in the blanks isnât so simple, here are a few suggestions. Whenever you need a word to describe a tone or writing style, check out the Feelings Wheel for an organized list of emotion words.Â\n\nAnd hereâs a chart of verbs you can use at the start of your prompts.Â\n\nâ\n\nSpâeed up your creative workflow\n\nEverything begins with the written word. Before you start shooting video or checking mic levels, you have to get the ideas on paper â a roadmap to give you direction. ChatGPT can help with that.Â\n\nBrainstorming with ChatGPT\n\nThe best prompts are specific and include details about your audience.Â\n\nAs an example, I looked at YouTuber Susi Vidal, better known for Only Pans on TikTok with 3.4 million followers. Vidal is âtrying to make cooking fun,â so letâs give her some recipes.Â\n\nPrompt: âCan you provide me with some [topic] ideas for [niche] food for [demographic] who are [skill level]?â\n\nâ\n\nNot bad.Â But thereâs more nuance you can give ChatGPT to get more interesting results.Â\n\nUse âact asâ or âyou are aâ to add depth and context based on specific roles\n\nPrompt: \"Act as [famous person/job title]. Give me [number] ideas to improve [activity] to reach [goal].âÂ\n\nPrompt: âYou are a [job title] of [workplace]. How do you achieve [goal] on [platform]?\"\n\nPrioritize odd and peculiar ideas in a list\n\nPrompt: âGive some uncommon strategies that [industry, person] can use to [goal] on [platform].â\n\nIterate on those uncommon ideas and have a chat with GPT\n\nPrompt: âExplain how to [idea] to achieve [goal] on [platform].â\n\nCreate a concise and snappy Twitter thread instantly\n\nPrompt: âCreate a Twitter thread from [idea #]. [Do/do not] include hashtags.â\n\nKeep going until youâre satisfied\n\nYou can also combine all of the above tactics to dig deeper into the idea. ChatGPT is meant to be a âchatâ function where you give it information and iterate on what it provides.Â\n\nPrompt: âAct as [title] of [profession] doing [goal].â\n\nPrompt: âAct as [title] of [profession] doing [goal] + uncommon ideas only.â\n\nPrompt: âMake a list of 5 [idea] types of [root idea] that were viral in the past.â\n\nPrompt: âGive me 10 more examples.âÂ\n\nRead more: How to use ChatGPT to improve your creative process\n\nNow that youâve got a healthy list of ideas, letâs create a content calendar around your core topic.Â\n\nCreate a content calendar with ChatGPT\n\nInstead of counting calendar days to determine when you should publish what, ask ChatGPT to create a publishing schedule for you.\n\nPrompt: âCan you create a content calendar for the next [month/quarter/year] that includes [specific number] of blog posts, [specific number] of 60-second social media videos, [specific number] of 5-7 minute videos, and [specific number] of email newsletters?âÂ\n\nGenerate outlines to get started on your content faster\n\nWriting is easier with a well-structured outline in place. To cover the ideas and topics you care about, give ChatGPT relevant keywords, questions, and ideas you want to cover.\n\nPrompt: \"I'm writing a newsletter/blog post on [topic] and would like an outline that includes [idea/subtopic 1], [idea/subtopic 2], [idea/subtopic 3], and [idea/subtopic 4]. Can you also suggest some related topics that I can cover in the post? Please ensure that the outline includes [specific detail] and [specific detail] to provide the reader with valuable insights. I'm looking for [adjective] ideas that will capture the reader's attention and keep them engaged throughout the post.\"\n\nYou can use one of the outlineâs headings as a prompt and ask it to build each paragraph.Â\n\nPrompt: âWrite me a paragraph on [insert heading]. Open with a [non-obvious/obvious/bold/counterintuitive/argumentative] statement, and develop this idea with evidence with links to sources. Then, summarize the content while transitioning into the next paragraph for [insert next heading].âÂ\n\nWrite first drafts of blogs in minutesÂ\n\nYou can also bypass the outline altogether and just ask ChatGPT to take the first crack at the article.\n\nPrompt: âCan you write a [number]-word article about [topic], outlining the [benefits] of [product] for [reader/audience/persona]?â\n\nPrompt: \"Write a blog post about the impact of [specific event/news] on [specific industry or community].\"\n\nPrompt: \"Write a blog post about the key takeaways from [insert book/article] and how they can be applied to [insert industry/field].\"\n\nPrompt: âCan you write a blog post arguing [for/against][subject] from the perspective of [person]? Before you do so, state the benefits of reading the blog post.â\n\nPrompt: \"Write a blog post about some common misconceptions about [insert topic] and how they can be corrected.\"\n\nPrompt: \"Write an explanatory blog about the process of [specific task or project] and include tips on how to do it efficiently.\"\n\nPrompt: âCan you write a [number]-word article with a [professional/emotional/exciting/fun] tone that explains the benefits of [topic] for [reader]? The article should start by using the PAS formula to compel the reader to read the whole article, and include a call to action in the last paragraph mentioning [offer].â\n\nPrompt: \"Write a blog post that gives an overview of the advantages of [specific activity or hobby]. Provide [tips/insights/mistakes/lessons/etc.] and a list of the recommended equipment to get started.\"\n\nChatGPT isnât the greatest writer â itâll probably produce something thatâs thin on substance and thick with fluff. Your job is to update it with research and tweak it to match your writing style and brand voice.Â\n\nFine-tune your writing to match your voice and engage readers\n\nPrompt: \"Voice and style guide: Write at a [grade/degree] level. Use [clear/simple/difficult/elaborate] language. Bias toward short sentences. Avoid [jargon, acronyms etc.].\"\n\nPrompt: \"[insert text] Rewrite my writing in a more [formal/funny/serious/sarcastic/optimistic/pessimistic/lighthearted] way.â\n\nPrompt: â[insert text] Rewrite the text for readers with [education level].â\n\nPrompt: \"Format your response using markdown. [Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and bold to organize the information etc.].\"\n\nPrompt: âRewrite the text to be more [concise/emphatic/humorous/descriptive/persuasive/informative/action-oriented].â\n\nPrompt: \"Rewrite the text emulating [Ernest Hemingway, Daniel Kahneman, J.R.R. Tolkien]âs writing style.\"\n\nGenerate a variety of headlines and select your favoriteÂ\n\nPrompt: \"Write [number] headlines for an article on [topic] for [audience].\"\n\nPrompt: [paste article/podcast or video transcript] Based on this content, give me [number] headlines for [audience]. Use [keyword].âÂ\n\nYou can get even better headlines for your blog or YouTube videos by giving the AI more context. Try building your ChatGPT prompt for any headline with these elements:\n\nWho: This is your audience. Give ChatGPT demographics, psychographics or job titles.Â\n\nWhat: This should be a noun like tips, reasons, mistakes, lessons, examples, templates, etc.Â\n\nWhy: This is the reason or outcome your audience wants, like getting promoted, learning something new, living a happier life, etc.Â\n\nThe topic or industry youâre targeting.Â\n\nThe parameters around character limits.Â\n\nYouTube has a 100-character limit but the best titles, those that display on all devices, are 60â70 characters.Â\n\nGoogleâs max character length is 600 pixels or about 60 characters.Â\n\nFacebook ad headlines give you 40 characters.Â\n\nLinkedInâs viewable text before the âsee moreâ button is 210.Â\n\nInstagram truncates captions to 125 characters.Â\n\nKnowing all that, here are some prompts you can use to get headlines almost instantly.\n\nPrompt: â[Paste blog/transcript] Using the above, write [number] click-worthy headlines for [who] that provide [what] and [why] for [topic/industry]. Limit your character count to [number].â\n\nPrompt: âWrite [number] headlines for [audience/persona/job title] that provides [tips/tricks/mistakes/lessons/examples about topic] and what the outcome or benefit will come from reading.â\n\nSpeed up your research (and a verification hack)\n\nChatGPT is a good first step in your research, but it shouldnât be the last. Thatâs because the AI doesnât have any information newer than 2021, and it can also make things up entirely. Still, feel free to use the following prompts, then double-check ChatGPTâs work with the trick below.\n\nPrompt: \"Give me some [adjective like fun/interesting/scary] facts and statistics about [topic] that [demographic audience] needs to know.\"\n\nPrompt: \"What are the best [methods/process/frameworks] that will help [the audience] solve [problem]? Include sources and links.\"\n\nPrompt: \"Tell me about the history of [topic] as it relates to [secondary topic]. Limit your explanation to the 20th century.\"\n\nTo fact-check quickly: If you use Google Docs, you can highlight the stats and facts in your copy and hit âCMD+Kâ on a Mac (âWindows Key+Kâ on a PC). It will quickly pull up the closest matching web result for the stat, which you can read to find the latest evidence.Â\n\nGrâow your following, get guests, and build an audience\n\nAll the blog posts in the world wonât help you if you donât have anyone to read them. Hereâs how to use ChatGPT to get a healthy social media following.\n\nGrow your network on social media\n\nChatGPT canât find followers for you, but it can sure help. For this, youâll want to block off 30 minutes during the day to spend on the social platform youâre trying to grow.Â\n\nStep 1: Spend 10 minutes writing and posting on social media.\n\nFor these prompts, youâll need blogs youâve written or transcripts from your podcasts or videos.Â\n\nPrompt: âWrite a 150â300 word [Instagram/Facebook/TikTok] caption that provides some key takeaways from this [paste text]. Drive the reader to click the link to the [blog/podcast/video] by telling them what benefit they will get from reading.â\n\nPrompt: â[Paste in transcript] Write a [Twitter thread/social carousel] with no more than [number] posts based on the key insights and takeaways of this: [video/podcast transcript]. Include a final tweet in the thread that is a CTA to check out the [podcast/website/newsletter/Twitter profile].â\n\nPrompt: â[Paste in a section of transcript] Repurpose this content into a Twitter thread that appeals to [audience] and drives engagement.â\n\nSome quick prompts for social media posts on any platform:Â\n\nPrompt: âWrite a [adjective] [platform] post about [topic].â\n\nPrompt: âGenerate [number] Instagram photo captions for a picture of [describe whatâs in the picture] about [topic].â\n\nPrompt: âDevelop [number] viral Instagram Reel ideas about [topic].â\n\nPrompt: âCreate a caption for my [product/service] on [platform] enticing users to click through to my site and consider making a purchase.\"\n\nPrompt: âGive me [number] ideas for an [Instagram/LinkedIn] live Iâm running with [describe guest host] about [topic]. Generate [number] questions I should ask the guest. Write an [adjective] [number]-second introduction to the guest.âÂ\n\nPrompt: âWrite a LinkedIn post about [topic] for [job title].

Generate three hashtags based on the content.â\n\nPrompt: âGenerate [number] different angles for LinkedIn posts that will get [persona] to share it with their network. Generate two to three hashtags based on the content.âÂ\n\nPrompt: âDevelop [number] of obvious problems with non-obvious solutions for [job title] for LinkedIn posts about [topic].â\n\nPrompt: âGive me [number] LinkedIn posts that make me a thought leader in [industry/topic] that provides valuable information to [persona].â\n\nTIP: Post in LinkedIn groups to get traction on your posts from people outside your network. Use the right hashtags and LinkedIn will ask you if you want to crosspost.Â\n\nAsk ChatGPT to create social captions based on holidays and celebrations.\n\nPrompt: âCreate a social media giveaway post for [insert special day]. Hereâs what the reader has to do to enter to win the prize: [describe here]. Winners will be announced on [date].â\n\nPrompt: âWrite a(n) [inspirational/comedic/empathetic/etc.] social media message about [insert special day/month] for the [platform] account [account URL].â\n\nGenerate polls or quizzes for a subtle yet effective way to know your audience and plan future content:\n\nPrompt: âCreate a [platform] poll about [event/challenges your audience faces/workflows/trending topics/etc.].âÂ\n\nStep 2: Spend 10 minutes searching hashtags in your niche and commenting on those threads and posts.\n\nYou can search natively on Twitter or TikTok for trending hashtags.

Recommend [number] Twitter accounts to follow to help extend my reach.â\n\nPrompt: â[Paste social post] Based on this post, come up with [number] ideas that [are contrarian/support the argument] and add to the conversation with takeaways about [topic] in [industry/job title/career].âÂ\n\nâ\n\nNow that youâve left breadcrumbs of your own content across a bunch of relevant social profiles, itâs time to make sure that when people click over to see what youâre about, your profile presents you perfectly.Â\n\nOptimize your social profiles and gaining followers\n\nAn optimized profile is like an ad for your personal brand â it must contain the reasons someone should follow you.Â\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPrompt: âWrite a LinkedIn [about or summary] section using my resume: [paste resume]. Use the keywords [keyword x,y,z] and appeal to hiring managers and [job titles] at [company size][industry]. Write in first person and use a [adjective] tone of voice.

Give me [number] options.\"\n\nâ\n\nChâatGPT for video creators: YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and more\n\nMaking a video is more than just hitting record and letting it rip. If you want a video that gets an audience, you need a plan: a script with a tempting hook, a flashy thumbnail, and maybe even a marketing strategy. ChatGPT can help with all of that.Â\n\nWrite hooks that stop the scroll, increase watch time, and grow your audience\n\nA headline is a title and should address the who, what, and why of the article your audience is about to read. A hook is your movie trailer. It tells you the beginning and hints at the end with more room to play.Â\n\nThe hook is the first 5â15 seconds of your video. To capture the attention of your audience, you need to do two things.Â\n\nCreate intrigue. Pique your audienceâs curiosity to make them want to keep watching.\n\nQualify your audience. A hook on the wrong audience is attention bait. Target the right audience to improve data and conversions.Â\n\nHere areÂ 5 types of hooks with 5 examples of each:\n\nâ\n\nâPrompt: Write [number] hooks for this video: [paste video transcript]. Itâs aimed at [type of audience] in order to get them [benefit]. Make it attention grabbing and keep it focused on [subject].\n\nProduce engaging TikTok scripts in less time\n\nHooks will get you viewers on any platform. To win big on TikTok, youâll also need to capitalize on trending sounds and songs. For that, scroll TikTokâs For You page, use TikTokâs search bar, and browse TikTokâs sound library. Also check out Tokboard for the weekâs top songs, search Spotify for TikTok playlists, and pay attention to the Billboard charts.Â\n\nOnce youâve chosen your trending sound, itâs time to plan your video.Â\n\nPrompt: âWrite a [30/60/120] second TikTok influencer script promoting [product] that helps users achieve [benefit]. Include the following features [X, Y, Z value propositions] and end with a CTA [follow more/buy now/subscribe/etc.]Â\n\nPrompt: âGive me [number] of scene ideas for this script.Â\n\nPrompt: âCombine the script and scene ideas togetherâ\n\nPrompt: âFormat into a table with detailed scene descriptionsâ\n\nPrompt: âWrite 3 alternative hook variations for the first 3 seconds of each videoâ\n\nBoost your virality with ChatGPT\n\nTo go viral, you need to appeal to a broad audience and chase the ârightâ ideas. Jonah Berger wrote a book on going viral called Contagious: Why Things Catch On. In it, he details the six elements of virality:\n\nSocial currency. The most valuable content is shareable content. Who is your audience trying to impress? Who would watch this video and immediately click to share it?\n\nTriggers. A word, phrase, or image associated with a message or anything that reminds your audience of the content.Â\n\nEmotion. People share things they care about.\n\nPublic. Itâs more likely to be shared if itâs something people are already talking about â think public events over promotional content. Likewise, sensitive topics, polarizing opinions, and NSFW content can turn people off from sharing.Â\n\nPractical value. Your audience wants relevant and helpful information.Â\n\nStories. Information is easier to spread if itâs part of a story your audience can tell.Â Â Â\n\nLetâs use ChatGPT to develop ideas to engage your audience enough for them to share.Â\n\nPrompt: âWrite me a viral [platform] video about [topic]. Give me [number] of ideas for headlines that capture the attention of [target audience] and make them want to share it with their friends.âÂ\n\nPrompt: âWrite a [platform] video script that teaches [persona] something new about [topic]. I need it to be relevant and helpful while also entertaining. Avoid political and NSFW content and have an extremely strong opinion about [topic].\"\n\nPrompt: âI want a [platform] video about [topic]. Give me a catchy title, a script, and a list of hashtags that will help the video go viral and encourage people to share it.â\n\nPrompt: \"I want to make a TikTok following this trend: [explain trend]. Write a script for a video like this, then give me [number] options for a headline and description.\"\n\nWrite an engaging YouTube script\n\nBy now, youâre familiar with ChatGPT prompts. We could simply ask it to âwrite a super engaging YouTube video script on [topic],â but the more specifics you give ChatGPT, the better your result.Â\n\nFirst, give ChatGPT the tone of voice you want:\n\nFunny\n\nInformal\n\nHumorous\n\nSerious\n\nOptimistic\n\nMotivating\n\nAssertive\n\nRespectful\n\nThen, identify the type of video you want to create:\n\nExplainer video\n\nInterview/Q&A video\n\nFeatured/Product video\n\nUser-generated video\n\nLive video\n\nEvent recap video\n\nShort-form social media video\n\nCase study video\n\nTestimonial video\n\nNext, tell it what you want the video to do:\n\nEngage my audience\n\nProvide valuable information\n\nShowcase features and benefits\n\nProvide clear and concise answers\n\nBreak down the steps in an easy-to-follow format\n\nConsider what you want out of it:\n\nDrive brand awareness\n\nIncrease my subscribers\n\nIncrease traffic to my website or blog\n\nSell a product or service\n\nFinally, give it a runtime or word count. (The average adult reader reads 300 words per minute.)\n\n5â7 minutes (good for YouTube)\n\n60â180 seconds (good for TikTok/Instagram)\n\nIf youâve written a blog, paste in the text ChatGPT needs to generate the script. It can also recommend visuals to go alongside the text with a two-column table.Â\n\nPrompt: âWrite a [tone of voice] [platform] [type of video] video script that [benefit to audience] and [benefit to you] that is [number] [minutes/words]. Output the script in a 2-column table with the narration on the left and the associated visuals on the right.Â Use [blog URL] to generate the content for the script.â\n\nâExample:\n\nââWrite a comforting YouTube explainer video script that provides valuable information and drives traffic to descript.com that is 5 minutes long.

Alternatively, use DALL-E 2 or MidJourney for free.Â\n\nYou can build your prompt by\n\nAsking for images in the style of your favorite artist, like Georgia OâKeeffe, Ansel Adams, or Bill Watson.Â\n\nStating the type of art like illustration, digital art, or photography (including the type of camera)\n\nGiving it your brand colors\n\nMentioning mediums like canvas or stained glass\n\nProviding contexts like a blog header or movie poster\n\nYou canât edit the image or specify the size (yet), but you can import the image to Canva or Pixlr and create a YouTube thumbnail thatâs the right size.Â\n\nPrompt: âCreate a [type of art] In the style of [artist] on [medium] that looks like a [context]. [Write out what you want the visual to look like]â\n\nYou can get reasonable outputs with simple prompts, too.Â\n\nOn the left is a 1980s robot drinking coffee and staring at a computer screen.Â\n\nOn the right is a cyborg drinking coffee and typing on their computer, anime style.Â\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nChâatGPT for podcasters\n\nA podcast can turn you into a content creation machine, and thatâs especially true if you combine the power of Descript and ChatGPT.Â\n\nUse Descript to record, edit your episode via the transcript, then publish it to your podcast host.Â\n\nUse Descriptâs video templates for custom audiograms and video clips with animated captions to share on social media.Â\n\nPaste the transcript from Descript into ChatGPT to create a Twitter thread.\n\nUse the same transcript to create a blog post on your website.Â\n\nUse the blog in your weekly newsletter.Â\n\nBut before all that happens, youâll need an episode that gets people listening. Hereâs how ChatGPT can help you do that.Â\n\nResearch your podcast guest using ChatGPT\n\nChances are this wonât be the first time your guest is on a podcast. They may also have a YouTube channel, a TikTok account, or a Twitter presence, so you can check there to get more information on them as a person.\n\nChatGPT can help you make this process faster with some simple prompts.Â\n\nPrompt: âI need a summary of [book] by [guest]. What are the key takeaways? What can you tell me about the author?â (Note: You may need to paste the publisherâs description of the book to give ChatGPT more context.)Â\n\nPrompt: â[paste YouTube transcript] What can you tell me about [guest] from this show?â\n\nPrompt: â[paste social media URL] What can you tell me about the person on this account?â\n\nGenerate open-ended questions that make your interviews more interesting\n\nPrompt: âGive me [number] questions to ask [URL of social media account].â\n\nPrompt: âDevelop [number] questions to ask a [subject matter expert] about [topic] on my podcast. Be sure to address how [topic] impacts [industry/audience] and use real-world examples to frame your questions where possible.â\n\nâ\n\nPrompt: âResearch [general podcast theme] through the lens of [topic of the show] over the years. Then use your research to develop [number] questions to ask a [subject matter expert/job title] on my podcast.âÂ\n\nPrompt: âList [number] questions to ask a [persona] during a podcast about [topic].â\n\nPrompt: âWhat would [audience] like to know about [topic]?â\n\nPrompt: âGive me [number] questions I could ask [prominent figure] about in the world of [industry/topic]. Do not consider [prominent figure]âs history, but rather the general nature of their position.â\n\nWrite an intro and outro that pulls your audience in and makes them hit subscribe\n\nMuch like any intro of any video, you need a hook to pull your audience in. One way to do that is by playing a teaser quote from the episode up top before your podcast intro. If you use Descript, you can easily search for that quote and paste it at the beginning to open your episode.Â\n\nOnce youâve done that, itâs time for the intro. ChatGPT can help out with that, too.\n\nPrompt: âWrite me a podcast introduction about [topic] that speaks to [audience] in [industry]. I need it to be no more than 30 seconds in length. Use short words and engaging copy to hook listeners.ââ\n\nPrompt: âWrite me a podcast outro about [topic] in [industry] with a call to action to get listeners to follow or subscribe to my podcast. I need it to be no more than 15 seconds in length.Â â\n\nPrompt: â[paste copy of transcript] Write an introduction to this podcast based on the provided transcript. Provide some context and relevant history and statistics about [topic].âÂ\n\nAdâvanced tips for content creators using ChatGPT\n\nThe most successful social accounts post daily, but it doesnât mean you have to create every day. ChatGPT can help you brainstorm post ideas in bulk so that you can schedule them in advance and spend more time making what you want.Â\n\nBulk create for your always-on content\n\nAsk ChatGPT for 30 days of contentÂ :\n\nPrompt: âList 30 tips for [audience] about [topic]â\n\nCopy the list then head over to Google Sheets or Excel composition and paste the ideas in the âAâ column.Â\n\nHit file>export/download as a .CSV file.Â\n\nHead over to Canva, find an Instagram Post template (or create a new one to match your visual identity).Â\n\nOn the left side, click âappsâ and scroll until you see âBulk createâ (youâll need Canva Pro for this)\n\nUpload your .CSV file. Click the text box where you want your ChatGPT ideas to populate and hit âConnect data.â\n\nIn the left pane, hit the purple âContinueâ button and then âGenerateâ and voila â 30 Instagram posts ready to publish.\n\nâ\n\nAIPRM Chrome extension for more advanced prompts\n\nIf youâre using Google Chrome, thereâs an amazing Chrome extension called AIRPRM for ChatGPT that has more than 2,000 prompts.\n\nWriting a YouTube script (and so much more) in seconds\n\nBelow is a screenshot from ChatGPT with the AIPRM extension installed where you can see just how many options they have to create YouTube content in seconds.Â Essentially, there are details in the background that are pre-filled so all you have to do is select the language output, the tone, and writing style.\n\nAIPRM Prompt: âWrite a script titled [headline]. Make sure to cover [topic 1, topic 2, topic 3]. Write it for an audience of [demographics like age, interests, hobbies]. Include a call to action to [action you want viewers to take].]â\n\nâ\n\nAutomation for no-touch task management\n\nâZapier is a tool that automates tasks between platforms â for instance, cross-posting your Instagram posts to Twitter, or creating a Squadcast recording session when a podcast guest creates a new Calendly event. In March 2023, ChatGPT became one of Zapierâs available platforms. By using Zapier to connect your favorite apps to ChatGPT, you can automate your most mundane tasks. For example, you can have ChatGPT draft a response to a new email matching a particular search query. At the end of the day, just pop into Gmail, edit the drafts ChatGPT wrote you, and hit send!\n\nâ\n\nTrain ChatGPT to follow tried-and-true formulas\n\nInstead of open-ended prompts, you can give ChatGPT instructions and constraints.Â\n\nBy reverse engineering the top Twitter threads (which also happen to make great Instagram carousels and TIkTok videos), you can create a template and educate ChatGPT on the expectations.Â\n\nHere are three you can use.\n\nâThread type: The contrarian opinion\n\nâ\n\nHereâs Brendan Huffordâs most viral tweet thread to date.

Hereâs how the [insert thread type] works [paste details]. Here is a sample text: [include text from viral Twitter thread]. Create a Twitter thread based on [thread type] that includes [X,Y,Z].âÂ\n\nChatGPT is your AI intern\n\nBy knowing the right prompts, ChatGPT gives you the power to create content at the scale of the top influencers in the world. It will help you move faster and find new audiences backed with the confidence of a never-ending idea machine that can write copy, grow your followers, and become omnipresent on every platform. You can use the rest of the time working on the stuff you really love â and maybe even sneak in an afternoon on a beach chair once in a while."
