Our reviews are all 5 star on Yelp so we ask you to check out what students are saying about us in “not recommended reviews” section or go to google and see our 5 star rating.\n\nI’ve worked with Dan one on one and he makes the process fun and natural. Sharing his past experiences as he grew into the world of fame and showing that acting is more then one may think. There’s laughter and joy in learning this world and Dan helps others see that. I look forward to continuing my journey with the studio even as I travel away from Palm Springs as he offers online classes!\n\nA.S. (Yelp Review from January 2023)\n\nDan is awesome! He got me in very last minute for a self tape while visiting Palm Springs. Also, an awesome price. Thanks Dan!!\n\nJ. D., New York. (Yelp Review from 2022)\n\nI love this class! Dan is a wonderful acting coach and very passionate about what he does. I HIGHLY recommend attending his acting classes.\n\nC.C. (Yelp Review)\n\nI am a Canadian actor that was on holiday in Palm Springs and found Dan Gauthier Acting Studio online . So happy I did, Dan was a wonderful collaborator that held a warm environment to work in. I would absolutely recommend this studio for self taping to any actor whether green or seasoned veteran actor. On my next holiday I know who i will call when I get an audition.Thanks Dan!!\n\nJ. C. Central Vancouver, Vancouver, Canada (Yelp Review)\n\nThe Dan Gauthier Acting Studio is simply the best – there is nothing like it in the entire desert. I have had other good acting teachers in the Coachella Valley, but this Acting Studio is the full package. Dan’s unique teaching style is laid back and keeps everyone at an equal level. HIs ability to share his 30 of acting experience (he is still a working actor) in multiple ways keeps the experience fun, fresh, most of all, a valuable experience. In the current class, there is a mix of improv, filmed scene study, guest teachers from the industry, and of course always in the mix are his wonderful stories. This guy knows his stuff but what I like is everything I am learning is helping me to be a more confident person in my everyday life. So even if I decide not to act, I win. Having our scene study filmed is incredibly helpful because I can actually see where I need to improve and that is helping me a more effective communicator.\n\n– Carol D., Rancho Mirage, CA\n\nRead all reviews on Yelp.\n\nGoogle Top Reviews\n\nREVIEW US ON GOOGLE\n\nReview on the Improv Class:\n\nNo one among our group of 6 had done anything like this before and we wondered what it would be like. Dan did a great job of making us feel relaxed as we started. We had a really fun time. And it was funny. We were laughing a lot, and so was Dan! What impacted us all was the idea of the importance of listening in order to do improv well. What a life lesson! And another thing we learned was that there is no real failure in improv as long as you’re trying and having fun. We did! 5 star experience.\n\nD.P, Google Review from 2022\n\nMy daughter is an actress, and while in Palm Springs visiting the grandparents she had a self-tape audition opportunity. We were so thankful to find the Dan Guathier Acting Studio. Dan was very accommodating so we could send the tape in good time. He and his wife, Lisa, met us at the studio and read with my daughter. Coaching, direction, and quality of tape was great. Her agent was very pleased!\n\nErin, Google Review\n\nReview from an actor attending both in-person and then virtual classes throughout the Pandemic:\n\nI am a Canadian Actor and writer from Vancouver, B.C. I joined the Dan Gauthier Acting Studio in 2019 as a snowbird to the Coachella Valley and really enjoyed the classes. Through the pandemic I continued classes through zoom from Canada until I returned to the Palm Springs area this winter and have met with this awesome group of people again.Everyone, on zoom or in person is supportive and kind. And that is so important when we do this work. Both Dan and Lisa are wonderful to work with. The approach they use allows you to get out of your head and be real in the moment. Being organic is what it’s about! The direction is clear and actionable. This is a great class, no matter what level of experience you have. There is support and encouragement to be the best of yourself. Since taking this training I have had Casting Directors comment on my skills! I highly recommend this studio!\n\nC. P. Google Review\n\nReview from a mom, on the acting class for her child:\n\nMy son has had a great experience at Dan Gauthier Acting Studio! Typically, my son is more relaxed about things he does (doesn’t show too much excitement), but these classes have really turned on his enthusiasm. Once he gets out of class, he says he can’t wait until the next and it shows. He works diligently on his “homework” (monologues he is given to practice) and goes back all smiles. A big part of that reaction comes from Dan’s ability to make the class fun, low pressure, and educational. I highly recommend this studio to all seeking a new experience or to better their craft.\n\n– Jessica P. Parent to a child who attended a kids acting class\n\nLearn more about the kids acting class here\n\nI’ve taken other acting classes, but they’ve always felt false or unhelpful to me. It was always scene study, or focus on interpreting a text. Dan’s approach is novel because under under his system, the actor isn’t really interpreting the text. Rather, the text is interpreting the actor. Everything Dan preaches is about honesty, and the importance of letting the text drive your action and reactions, rather than trying to “make it interesting” or “emote properly.” It’s a great class, Dan and Lisa are great. They create an environment where it feels safe to take risks, which is a big deal when so many acting teachers denigrate and demean their students. I highly recommend this class to anyone interested in taking their acting up a level – or writers, directors, artists who are trying to get in touch with that elusive spirit of spontaneity that always seems present when we’re at our best.\n\nCody F.\n\nReview from a participant attending a company improv workshop\n\nI attended an improv workshop here with a group of work colleagues. Dan was a superb host! We had so much fun and he guided us through really well. Highly recommended.\n\nLisa R.\n\nI love my current class with Dan Gauthier and his wife, Lisa. They are committed to sharing their experience from over 30 years of acting and it shows in Dan’s teaching style and all the little extras from Lisa. Class is a mix of improv, filmed scene study, all interspersed with Dan’s experience (still a working actor) and vast knowledge of the business. In addition to an incredible learning experience, I have never had so much fun in a class.\n\nCarol D.\n\nReviews on Facebook\n\nThis review is from a Grandmother looking for acting classes for her grandchildren while visiting Coachella Valley\n\nTook my two 8 year old Grandkids for a private lesson, and they had a great time. Dan and his wife Lisa are wonderful instructors, very friendly and work great with kids. They are very encouraging and bring out the best in the students. It was a great experience, wish my grandkids lived closer so they could attend weekly classes.\n\nK.H. Facebook Review\n\nDan and Lisa are thoughtful and encouraging instructors, and have a knack for bringing out excellence in students. Everyone in class and seemed inspired to push themselves. I was impressed with the first class at the studio, and I’ll definitely be back!\n\nCaring and honest teachers in Dan and Lisa, dynamic classes. Dan and Lisa know how to bring out the best performances in students.\n\nK.J. Facebook Review\n\nFind us on Facebook\n\nInstagram Acting Class Reviews\n\nFinished my last acting class of the year at Dan Gauthier Acting Studio. Almost three years with this acting studio and it’s the best acting family I could ask for!\n\nSee post\n\nFrom Improv Class Attendees\n\nDoes your child want to learn to act?
