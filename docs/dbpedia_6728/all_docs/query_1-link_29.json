        "text": "If you’re a developer, an instructor or anyone in the IT field who might need to include various code blocks to Google documents, what do you do? Do you write the code and format it, using the standard built-in formatting functions in Google Docs? You might, but that’s not always the most efficient way to go. Your code could be malformed, which does you no favors — especially when you’ve spent time crafting elegant and clean code.\n\nAdd an extension: Code Blocks\n\nFortunately, there are plenty of tools in the Google Workspace Marketplace that will do the job. The add-on I’ve found to be the best is Code Blocks. With this extension, you can select a block of code and format it to your liking within your document. It’s easy to use and best of all, it’s free — all you need is a Google account.\n\nThe Code Blocks feature set includes:\n\nSyntax highlighting.\n\nAutomatic language detection.\n\nPlenty of color themes to choose from.\n\nAbility to format code inline or as blocks.\n\nPreview function.\n\nLet me show you how to install and use this Google Docs add-on, so you can include your code in cloud-based documents.\n\nHow to install Code Blocks\n\nInstalling Code Blocks is quite simple:\n\nOpen a browser that’s logged in to your Google account, and point it to the Code Blocks page in the Google Workspace Marketplace.\n\nClick Install, and when prompted, click CONTINUE. You will be required to select an account for the add-on.\n\nOnce you’ve selected your account, you’ll then have to accept the necessary permissions for Code Blocks, which include:\n\nView and manage documents in the application.\n\nAllow the application to run when you aren’t present.\n\nView and manage data associated with the application.\n\nDisplay and run third-party web content in prompts and sidebars inside Google applications.\n\nIf you’re OK with those permissions, scroll down and click Allow. Code Blocks will install and is ready to use.\n\nSEE: Learn how to check the word count in Google Docs.\n\nHow to use Code Blocks in Google Docs\n\nUsing Code Blocks is equally simple. Open Google Docs and create a new document. With the document open, click Extensions | Code Blocks and then select Start from the menu. A new right sidebar will open (Figure A), where you can make use of the tool.\n\nFigure A\n\nTo use Code Blocks, write or paste your code in the document. Once you have the code in place, select the complete section of code and then:\n\nSelect the language from the Language dropdown.\n\nSelect a theme from the Theme dropdown.\n\nClick Preview to view the code in the preview pane (Figure B).\n\nFigure B\n\nMake any necessary changes (such as selecting a different theme).\n\nWhen the code looks exactly how you want, click Format.\n\nThe code block should now be formatted, exactly how you like it, in your document (Figure C). You’re ready to move on to the next section of text or a new block of code.\n\nFigure C\n\nOne nice thing about the code block you just added is that you can edit it. To do so:\n\nClick inside the block and change any text you need.\n\nAfter you’re done editing your code block, click the X in the upper right corner of the Code Blocks add-on to close the sidebar.\n\nAnd that’s all there is to adding code blocks to your Google Docs cloud-based documents. If you’ve struggled to format your code into presentable blocks, you can now breathe easy and do so with a couple of clicks.\n\nBenefits of adding Code Blocks to Google Docs\n\nOne of the main benefits of adding a code block in a Google Document is that these blocks follow syntax rules according to the language; this means that with a code block you’ll have proper indentation and highlighting.\n\nSEE: Explore the top programming languages for systems admins.\n\nIf you copy and paste your code directly into the document, you must manually format the code so it looks correct. Also, if someone copies your code from the document, the formatting may not stick. However, with a code block, the formatting should transfer in the copy and paste. Code blocks can be edited without messing up the formatting or highlighting.\n\nUse the built-in Google Workspace option: Code block\n\nGoogle added the built-in ability to insert a code block to a Google document in late 2022 for select editions of Google Workspace: Business Standard and Plus, Enterprise Standard and Plus, Education Standard and Plus and Nonprofits.\n\nTo add a code block, open a Google Doc in a web browser, select Insert | Building blocks | Code block. Then, select from one of five options:\n\nC/C++\n\nJava\n\nJavaScript\n\nPython\n\nUnset\n\nOnce the block has been created, you may enter your code in the code block directly. The built-in building block feature has fewer display options than the Code Blocks add-on, as shown in Figure D, although it doesn’t require giving a third-party add-on access permissions.\n\nFigure D\n\nImprove your Google Docs experience\n\nWhether you prefer the Code Blocks add-on or the built-in code block option, you can now easily highlight code, so it stands out from the rest of your document in Google Docs.\n\nOptimize your Google Docs workflow with one hour of content on “editing, formatting, styling, & more” with this deal from TechRepublic Academy."
