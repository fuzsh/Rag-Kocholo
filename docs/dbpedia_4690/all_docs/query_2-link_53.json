        "text": "Clarence Acox, Seattle JazzED Co-Founder\n\nAn outstanding educator for over 40 years, Clarence Acox was the long time director of the award-winning Garfield High School Jazz Ensemble, which has qualified and placed among the top three bands in the Essentially Ellington competition at Jazz at Lincoln Center for many years. A native of New Orleans, he graduated from Southern University. In 2002 he received the national Educator of the Year Award from Downbeat magazine, and has been voted Earshot Jazz Musician of the Year.\n\n“My kids often come back and tell me how much playing in the band changed their lives. Playing music — especially jazz — can do that to you. I’ve dreamed of making that experience available to every kid who wants it.”\n\nMarina Albero\n\nBorn into the family band Grallers de Banyoles-Estampida Medieval, Marina Albero has been steeped in the sounds of Barcelona since childhood. As a young girl, extensive training in percussion and piano in both Spain and Cuba sent her on the road to early achievement and success. Albero played European festivals and was awarded the annual prize for talented youth in Brussels.\n\nMarina has collaborated on recording projects with players like Silvio Rodríguez, and tours in Catalonia, Spain, and Portugal with the band Barnhabana, conducted by Grammy winner Barbarito Torres. Currently, Marina performs in flamenco shows with renowned dancers and companies, including the Ballet Nacional De España.\n\nBrian Bermudez\n\nBrian Bermudez is a saxophone chameleon performing in many musical styles across the Puget Sound region for the better part of a decade. He is a Magna Cum Laude graduate of Cornish College of the Arts majoring in Saxophone Performance. His time performing on the Seattle Music Scene has shaped his philosophy that quality music education should be accessible to as many people as possible. That lessons learned while playing an instrument and performing with others bolsters lifelong soft skills and can provide lifelong enrichment. Brian believes that mentorship is one of the greatest traditions in Jazz.\n\nSamantha Boshnack\n\nWhether blasting through the sonic explorations of her 14-piece alternative chamber orchestra, B’shnorkestra, or leading Seismic Belt and her quintet, Samantha Boshnack’s sound pulses with vitality. In addition to running her own three ensembles, she is part of the acclaimed composers’ collective Alchemy Sound Project and has toured extensively in the zany, postmodern Reptet. She has released twelve recordings with these five ensembles. In 2018, Boshnack was awarded the annual Make Jazz Fellowship, a three month-residency sponsored by the Herb Alpert Foundation. Boshnack graduated from Bard College in 2003 with a BA in music, and is an alumni of the Gabriela Lena Frank Creative Academy of Music (GLFCAM), Mutual Mentorship for Musicians and the Jazz Composers Orchestra Institute at UCLA.\n\nBoshnack has been a music educator for 20+ years. She believes that music is a fun and rewarding way to express oneself and be creative, as well as learn important lessons in patience, practice, and discipline. Students are encouraged to find joy and passion in music while becoming the best all-around musician they can be.\n\nVanessa Bruce\n\nVanessa Wells Bruce has been making music since the age of four. A native of Philadelphia Pennsylvania, she was a leader in all-city groups as a violist and vocalist. Her study of music theory, viola, pipe organ, and piano continued at Oberlin Conservatory, where she earned a Bachelor of Music Education. She took post-graduate classes at West Chester State University and Drake University in vocal pedagogy and conducting.\n\nIn addition to being a mother, educating youth has been her life’s passion. For decades, Vanessa was an elementary and middle school vocal music teacher in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Iowa. Her creativity as performer, accompanist, choir director, clinician, musician, playwright, drama director, composer and arranger has afforded Vanessa many opportunities since she and her children moved to Washington State in 1998.\n\nVanessa is currently the Artistic Director for The Sound of the Northwest, a choir whose mission is to enrich diverse, multi-generational, and multi-cultural audiences and artists. Through the presentation of musical performances and various other art forms, they commit to the preservation of the history and legacy of African Americans, thereby cultivating a musical future for all humanity.\n\nKat Bula\n\nKat Bula is a fiddler/violinist, guitarist, vocalist, mandolinist, accordionist, and songwriter. She has been performing and teaching music across a variety of genres since she was teenager herself. Specializing in improvisation, music theory and jamming skills, Kat has worked with hundreds of adult and teenage students across the U.S. and Canada via live workshops, online courses and private lessons. She’s won awards at numerous fiddle contests, including the Washington State and Northwest Regional championships, and has had articles published in Fiddler Magazine and Mel Bay Publications’ Fiddle Sessions. As a performer, Kat has recorded and toured extensively with bands ranging from hardline traditional bluegrass and Western swing, to pirate-themed folk-punk. Along the way she’s found opportunities to work with everyone from GRAMMY-winning bluegrass and Hawaiian musicians, to regional math-rock, metal, and hip-hop artists.\n\nLuiggi Chancafe\n\nLuiggi is an active musician and educator in the Seattle area who is always searching for new opportunities to share his passion for music with both his listeners and students. Luiggi graduated from the University of Washington in 2021 with a B.A in Music Performance/Jazz studies.
