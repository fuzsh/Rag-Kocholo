The cliché is not wrong: Philosophy engages with the “Big Questions”. What is the nature of reality? Is a truly fulfilling life possible for human beings? What is the origin and character of our responsibility to each other and for nature? Does our rigorous thought point to the necessity of something worthy of the name “God”? These are the main “big questions” that engage me.\n\nI didn’t start off in philosophy though. I did a B.A. in History at the University of Toronto, then went to seminary at the Center for Christian Studies in Toronto followed by an M.A. at McGill in Religious Studies. After a brief foray in the education at Dalhousie I finally admitted my calling as a philosopher and completed a PhD in Philosophy at the Pennsylvania State University. Since then I’ve worked on a variety of topics. My 2014 book, The Vitality of Contradiction, won the Biennial Book Prize of the Canadian Philosophical Association. In addition to traditional philosophical work, I also research several important social movements in Brazil. My position at Bishop’s is in both Philosophy and Liberal Arts.\n\nI find university teaching to be an extraordinarily rewarding and fulfilling career, and believe that the small classes and warm atmosphere of Bishop’s is ideal not just for students but for me as a professor as well.\n\nResearch\n\nIn recent years my research pertains to the intersection of metaphysics and ethics. The main point of reference here is the debate about Plato’s argument for the “Good”—an eternal “form” that makes demands upon us to seek the Truth and be responsible to others. This means that the main philosophers I find myself working hardest on are Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, G. W. F. Hegel, Simone Weil, and Emmanuel Levinas. I have also devoted a great deal of energy in recent years to the (closely related) study of the philosophy of science.\n\nMy research in Brazil, meanwhile, focusses on the struggle for social justice for social movements, Afro-Brazilian communities and Indigenous peoples. This involves me in work not only on human rights, but also the rights of nature. To that end, I am an Adjunct Professor in the Faculty of Law at the Federal University of Goiá𝑠, in central Brazil.\n\nPublications\n\nThe Vitality of Contradiction: Hegel, Politics and Liberal-Capitalism, McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2014.\n\n“Marxism and Human Rights: History, Exploitation and the Labour-Capital Compromise”.
