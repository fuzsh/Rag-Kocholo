Over the years, I've been a listener, performer, judge and clinician. I'm grateful for all of the experiences with the late Chuck Frank, Bob Brown, Dan McCarthy, Ed Michaels and Dave Sterner. In my view, it's several decades of fine musicianship and exceptional music education, and I'm glad to have played a small role.\"\n\n-Paul Ferguson, Music Director of the Cleveland Jazz Orchestra\n\nI had the privilege to be associated with the Lakeland Jazz festival as the director of the Lakeland Jazz Orchestra and as Artistic Director of the Festival. This annual event brought the attention of music students and the community some of the greatest jazz musicians to play the music.

It was a positive force for the music before me and continues as one of the great events in Northeast Ohio. Once again it was a privilege and a joy to be part of it!\n\n-Ernie Krivda, Cleveland Jazz Legend Award, 2005\n\n\"Love it!
