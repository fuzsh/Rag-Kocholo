He attended college at Indiana University and graduated in 1962 with a Masters Degree in Saxophone. He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music by Indiana University in 1992. He also plays piano, bass and banjo.\n\nIn 1989, the International Association of Jazz Educators inducted Jamey into their Hall of Fame at the San Diego convention. With this award, Jamey joins other jazz luminaries such as Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Louis Armstrong and others.\n\nJamey is a internationally-known saxophonist and authority on jazz education and improvisation, and has developed a series of Play-A-Longs (book and cd sets (now numbering almost 130 volumes) as well as various other supplemental aids for the development of improvisational skills. The Aebersold book and recording sets allow a musician the opportunity to practice and improvise with well-known jazz personalities at home as well as in the classroom. The recordings employ some of the best jazz musicians in the world. This concept has been responsible for changing the practice habits of thousands of musicians around the world.\n\nJamey was one of the first to encourage small group classes which concentrate on jazz improvisation, and he is the director of the Summer Jazz Workshops which now have 40+ years on record. Jamey feels that improvisation is something all people can do — and his clinics and lectures concentrate on demonstrating how the creative and spontaneous nature of each person can be brought to light.\n\nThese week-long Summer Jazz Workshops are having a profound effect on musical communities around the world. The Workshops have traveled to Australia, New Zealand, Germany, England, Scotland, Denmark and Canada. Every summer there are at least two week-long Workshops in the U.S. These camps employ many of the finest player/teachers in jazz and are open to any serious jazz student regardless of ability or age.\n\nIn 2007, Jamey was awarded the Indiana Governor's Arts Award by Mitch Daniels, the Governor of Indiana.\n\nOn October 4, 1987, CBS' \"Sunday Morning\" with Charles Kuralt and Billie Taylor featured Jamey with the Summer Jazz Workshops in an exciting jazz educational segment.\n\nJamey has taught at three colleges and universities in the Louisville, Kentucky area and has made guest appearances in dozens of cities around the world. While conducting a jazz clinic in Brazil he produced a 110-minute DVD/video appropriately titled \"Anyone Can Improvise\" which has become a best-seller.\n\nJamey's hobby is listening to jazz, especially new young players. He also enjoys playing basketball (he has hit 50 free throws in a row!) and is very much interested in Metaphysics and spiritual pursuits as they apply to the growth of the individual. In December 2004, the Jazz Midwest Clinic bestowed upon Jamey the \"Medal of Honor\" in Jazz Education.\n\nJamey has been a driving force in America's native art form, Jazz, and continues to kindle the fires of musical imagination in those with whom he comes in contact.\n\nGriffin Campbell\n\nBorn in 1958 in Stanly County, North Carolina, and raised in a musically enriched household, Griffin Campbell's love for music was ignited at an early age. His journey with the saxophone began when he was ten years old, and he soon discovered his lifelong dedication to mastering the instrument.\n\nCampbell's academic pursuits led him to earn a bachelor's degree in music education from Pfeiffer College (now Pfeiffer University) studying saxophone with Michael Price and Donald Grant, followed by a master's degree and Doctorate in saxophone performance from Michigan State University, where his saxophone studies were with James Forger. Throughout his career, he has had the privilege of working with many influential figures in the music world, shaping his unique musical voice and pedagogical approach.\n\nAs a performer, Griffin's saxophone playing is characterized by its rich tone, expressive phrasing, and remarkable technical prowess. His influences weave together various musical genres, from raucous improvisations to breathtaking classical interpretations. Whether performing as a soloist or collaborating with ensembles, his performances leave an indelible impression on audiences, evoking a wide range of emotions and showcasing the saxophone's versatility.\n\nBeyond his accomplishments as a performer, Griffin's passion for education led him to pursue a career in academia. He held the first position as professor of saxophone at Louisiana State University from 1984-2024. Through his nurturing and supportive teaching style, he inspired his students to cultivate their own artistic voices while providing them with a solid foundation in technique, theory, and musical interpretation. Recognized for his exceptional teaching abilities, Griffin is often invited to lead masterclasses and workshops at music festivals and educational institutions worldwide. His pedagogical approach emphasizes creativity, musicality, and a deep understanding of the historical context of the saxophone and its role in art music.\n\nGriffin Campbell's contributions to the world of music extend far beyond his individual accomplishments. Through his exceptional saxophone playing, dedicated teaching, and artistic vision, he continues to inspire and shape the next generation of musicians, leaving an indelible mark on the world of music.\n\nView Member Directory Profile\n\nKenneth M.

His schooling began in Arlesheim, Switzerland and continued in Stuttgart where he graduated from the first Waldorfschule. After having played piano for some time, he decided to study clarinet with Philipp Dreisbach at the Hochschule fÃ¼r Musik in Stuttgart (1928/1929) In an interview, Rascher said, \"Obeying necessity, not following my inclination, I started to play saxophone in order to be in a dance band. As I did this for a couple of years, I became more and more unsatisfied. I started to practice furiously and slowly found out that it had more possibilities than was usually thought of.\"\n\nIn 1930 Rascher moved to Berlin where he was called upon when a saxophonist was needed to perform in the Philharmonic. This is where he met the composer and conductor Edmund von Borck, who composed a concerto for him in 1931. Borck's Concerto, Op. 6 for Saxophone and Orchestra was chosen to be performed at the General German Composers Festival in Hanover, Germany on October 3, 1932. It was such a success that the Berlin Radio Orchestra, under the baton of Eugen Jochum, gave a performance with Rascher in Berlin on January 6 of 1933. In the summer of the same year, Rascher performed the Borck concerto again in Strasbourg at Hermann Scherchen's International Musician's Working Conference, and in 1935 he performed it with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw under the baton on Eduard van Beinem.\n\nAs Hitler rose to power in 1933, Rascher's friend, Johan Bentzon, whom he had met in Strasbourg, invited him to Copenhagen, Denmark, where Rascher then taught at the Royal Danish Conservatory, 1934 also in MalmÃ¶, Sweden. Concert tours throughout Europe,(Norway, Italy, Spain, Poland,England, Hungary etc.) with the exception of Germany, followed, 1938 to Australia. In 1939 he moved to the United States.\n\nRaschÃ¨r arrived in the United States in 1939 and made his American debut with the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Serge Koussevitzky on October 20, 1939. On November 11 of the same year, he was a featured soloist in Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic under the baton of Sir John Barbirolli. He was the first saxophonist to appear as a soloist in a subscription concert with both orchestras.\n\nHis career continued with solo appearances in Washington, D.C. and at New York City's Town Hall in the spring of 1940, which Toscanini attended and thereupon embraced Rascher. With war looming in Europe, he could not return to Germany. On the 4th of November 1941, his wife Ann Mari, of Swedish descent, joined him in the United States where they established their home on a small farm in the rural town of Shushan in northern New York, where they would reside for nearly 60 years.\n\nAlthough he was born in Germany, publicity from the 1940s often refers to RaschÃ¨r as having come from Sweden. This reflected both his distaste for the Hitler regime, and reaction to American suspicion during that time of all things German. His international career as a soloist and his ability to gain residence and citizenship in many countries could have been damaged or destroyed if any suspicion arose about his background.\n\nAfter World War II ended in 1945, RaschÃ¨r was invited to give concerts in Europe again, where he traveled for months on end, performing as soloist with many orchestras. As RaschÃ¨r's reputation grew in the United States, he also performed many orchestra concerts as soloist as well as with various university bands.\n\nRaschÃ¨r went on to perform as soloist with more than 250 orchestras and wind ensembles worldwide, including concerts in Europe, Asia, Australia, Canada and the United States.\n\nWith his daughter Carina, Linda Bangs and Bruce Weinberger (currently still member), Rascher founded the RaschÃ¨r Saxophone Quartet in 1969, one of the first classical saxophone ensembles to perform world-wide. They appeared at major concert halls in Europe and the United States during the first ten years with Sigurd Rascher. The quartet was acclaimed as the \"Uncrowned Kings of the Saxophone\" (Wiener Zeitung). The Rascher Quartet has performed in all countries of Europe, the United States, Mexico, Canada, South East Asia and Australia. It is the longest existing saxophone quartet and is entirely self-supporting. Rascher's tireless pursuit of classical composers is continued by the quartet. Their impressive technical abilities and reputation led over 300 composers from more than 35 nations to dedicate works to the RaschÃ¨r Saxophone Quartet. The best known composers who have written for the group include Luciano Berio, Philip Glass, Iannis Xenakis, Sofia Gubaidulina, Charles Wuorinen, Giya Kancheli, Lera Auerbach, Pehr Henrik Nordgren, Miklos Maros, Mauricio Kagel, Cristobal Halffter etc.\n\nHis last saxophone solo performance was playing the Glazounov Concerto with the Vermont Symphony in 1977, on the eve of his 70th birthday. He died in Shushan, New York in 2001, aged 93.\n\nDuring RaschÃ¨r's life, 208 works for saxophone were dedicated to him, many counted as among the most important 20th century works for the concert saxophone.\n\nBio from Wikipedia\n\nDebra Richtmeyer\n\nHonorary Life Member Since March 2014\n\nDebra Richtmeyer, an internationally renowned saxophonist and pedagogue, has been Professor of Saxophone at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign since 1991 and has performed as a soloist and clinician in the United States, Canada, England, France, Germany, Italy, Scotland, Spain, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Thailand and China.

In high school he led a group with Jackie McLean, Kenny Drew, and Art Taylor. He rehearsed with Thelonious Monk for several months in 1948, and from 1949 to 1954 recorded intermittently with a number of leading bop musicians and groups, including J. J. Johnson, Charlie Parker, Fats Navarro, Bud Powell, Max Roach, Art Blakey, Monk, and the Modern Jazz Quartet. His most frequent associate during these early years was Miles Davis, with whom he performed in clubs from 1949 and recorded from 1951. In one of these recording sessions with Davis, in 1954, he introduced three compositions of his own which later became jazz standards: Airegin, Doxy, and Oleo. In 1955, while overcoming his dependence on drugs, he worked in Chicago and, in December, joined the Clifford Brown-Max Roach Quintet. He remained with Roach until May 1957, then performed briefly in Davis's quintet; thereafter, however, he has led his own groups.\n\nIn 1956 came the first of a series of landmark recordings issued under Rollins's own name: Valse Hot introduced the practice, now common, of playing bop in 3/4 meter; St. Thomas initiated his explorations of calypso patterns; and Blue 7 was hailed by Gunther Schuller as demonstrating a new manner of \"thematic improvisation,\" in which the soloist develops motifs extracted from his theme. Way Out West (1957), Rollins's first album using a trio of saxophone, double bass, and drums, offered a solution to his longstanding difficulties with incompatible pianists, and exemplified his witty ability to improvise on hackneyed material (Wagon Wheels, I'm an Old Cowhand). It Could Happen to You (also 1957) was the first in a long series of unaccompanied solo recordings, and The Freedom Suite (1958) foreshadowed the political stances taken in jazz in the 1960s. During the years 1956 to 1958 Rollins was widely regarded as the most talented and innovative tenor saxophonist in jazz. Nevertheless, he was discontented: he could not find compatible sidemen, saw shortcomings in his own playing, and suffered from poor health. For these reasons he voluntarily withdrew from public life from August 1959 to November 1961. During this period of retirement his habit of practicing on the Williamsburg Bridge in New York became legendary.\n\nOn resuming his career Rollins had improved his already prodigious skills, but his style was now considered conservative. In an effort to rejoin the vanguard of jazz fashion he began, in mid-1962, collaborating with Don Cherry, Billy Higgins, and other musicians playing free jazz; East Broadway Run Down (1966) illustrates the furthest extent to which he incorporated noise elements into his playing. During these years, as Rollins continued to struggle with changing personnel and instrumentation, he focused increasingly on unaccompanied playing, and by the end of the decade he had become famous for his extended, \"stream-of-consciousness\" extemporizations on traditional tunes and on his own calypso songs.\n\nIn 1965 Rollins wrote the film score for Alfie (apart from the title song, which is by Burt Bacharach). He pursued spiritual interests in India for five months in 1968, and abandoned music altogether from September 1969 to November 1971. From 1972, when he resumed playing once more, he has led various groups of young, lesser-known musicians, performing in a commercial vein and making use of electronic instruments and African-American dance rhythms; a film made the following year, Sonny Rollins Live, captures the exuberance of a concert performance. Rollins has continued to experiment, recording on soprano saxophone in 1972 and on lyricon in 1979. However, touring the USA in 1978 as a member of the Milestone Jazzstars (with McCoy Tyner, Ron Carter, and Al Foster), he demonstrated that, as an individual, he remained essentially true to the bop tradition, an aspect of his playing that was again especially apparent in an acclaimed solo performance at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1985. Except for a six-month hiatus in 1983, after he collapsed from exhaustion, Rollins remained active through the late 1980s, touring the USA, Europe, and Japan, and recording a fusion of bop and soul music with his quintet.\n\nHe won his first performance Grammy for This Is What I Do (2000), and his second for 2004's Without a Song (The 9/11 Concert), in the Best Jazz Instrumental Solo category (for \"Why Was I Born\"). In addition, Sonny received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in 2004. Additional honors include: 2006 Rollins - Academy of Achievement; 2009 - Austrian Cross of Honor for Science and Art; 2010 - election to American Academy of Arts and Sciences; 2010 - Edward MacDowell Medalist; 2011 - Medal of Arts awarded by President Barack Obama. On December 3, 2011 Sonny Rollins was one of five 2011 Kennedy Center honorees, alongside actress Meryl Streep, singer Barbara Cook, singer/songwriter Neil Diamond and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Rollins said of the honor, \"I am deeply appreciative of this great honor. In honoring me, the Kennedy Center honors jazz, America's classical music. For that, I am very grateful.\"\n\nBio from PBS's Jazz and SonnyRollins.com\n\nView Member Directory Profile\n\nEugene Rousseau\n\nHonorary Life Member Since (unknown)\n\nEugene Rousseau has performed across North America and on five continents since his Carnegie Hall debut.

His solo performances include appearances with the U.S. Army Band at Kennedy Center, the Budapest Strings in Hungary, and the Tokyo Bach Band, as well as the Hamamatsu International Wind Instrument Festival in Japan.\n\nThe Chicago-born Rousseau's service to the saxophone community is of long standing. Since 1972, he has been the Yamaha Corporation's chief consultant for saxophone research, contributing to the development of acoustic improvements in saxophones and mouthpieces. In 1985, he recorded a video program for Yamaha, Steps to Excellence. Rousseau co-founded the World Saxophone Congress in 1969 and has been President of both the North American Saxophone Alliance (1979-80) and the ComitÃ© International du Saxophone (1982-85). In May 1998, he was honored as a Distinguished Alumnus by the University of Iowa, at which institution he earned the Ph.D. degree, his principal teacher being Himie Voxman. He holds the title of Distinguished Professor of Music at Indiana University, having served on the IU faculty from 1964 to 2000. Dr. Rousseau joined the faculty of the University of Minnesota School of Music in fall 2000. In 1993, Eugene Rousseau was designated an honorary faculty member of the Prague Conservatory. In 2003, Rousseau and the University of Minnesota School of Music hosted the 13th World Saxophone Congress Convention. He left his position at the University of Minnesota in 2015 to pursue continued performances, master classes, recording and writing.\n\nAdditional information is available on his website, www.eugene-rousseau.com, including a list of awards and recognitions, publications, and recordings.\n\nView Member Directory Profile\n\nJohn Sampen\n\nHonorary Life Member Since May 2012\n\nAs one of America's leading concert saxophonists, John Sampen is particularly recognized as a distinguished artist in contemporary literature.

He was a member of radio station WJR's live studio orchestra and he was a member of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra (DSO) from 1943 to 1964. Not only did he play sax, as one might expect, but he also performed on clarinet and was the DSO's first desk flutist, a rare enough feat then and almost unheard of now. Additionally, he opened his own music studio and staffed it with players from the orchestra. It was one of the most reputable, demanding and prestigious of its kind in the country. His studio near Wayne University where many high school and collegiate students studied saxophone.
