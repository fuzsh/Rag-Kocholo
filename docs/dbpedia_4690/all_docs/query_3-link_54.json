        "text": "Theological Horizons creates rich opportunities for the broader community to hear speakers explore the connections between vibrant faith and social engagement.\n\nWherever our guests are on their spiritual journey, authentic spiritual conversations are intellectually rich inquiries about honest faith in a complex world. These conversations can be in the form of a book talk, a salon, a house concert or a film night and address a wide range of topics: poverty, art, missions, business, politics and more.\n\nIn the warmth of the Bonhoeffer House, there is space to ask questions and test ideas. Our guests include members of the Charlottesville community, faculty from the University of Virginia, and students.\n\nAll are welcome.\n\nTo receive invitations, be sure to sign up at the bottom of any page to join our email list.\n\nTo watch or listen to past conversations, click here.\n\n“When is the last time that you had a great conversation, a conversation which wasn't just two intersecting monologues, which is what passes for conversation a lot in this culture? But when had you a great conversation in which you overheard yourself saying things that you never knew you knew, that you heard yourself receiving from somebody words that absolutely found places within you that you thought you had lost and a sense of an event of a conversation that brought the two of you onto a different plane, and then…a conversation that continued to sing in your mind for weeks afterwards? …They're like, as we would say at home, they are food and drink for the soul.” - John O’Donohue\n\n“God has willed that we should seek and find his living Word in the witness of a brother, in the mouth of a person. Therefore, the Christian needs another Christian who speaks God’s Word to him” - Dietrich Bonhoeffer\n\nPast Events\n\n“Cafe Nights”\n\nDuring the pandemic summer, we hosted a series of Zooms with wonderful guests like John Sarrouff and Donnell Woodson and Kate Harris.\n\nListen.\n\n\"Ordinary Saints: Facing ourselves, each other and the Beloved.\"\n\nArtist Bruce Herman, who holds the Lothlórien Distinguished Chair in Fine Arts at Gordon College, shares about his exhibit opening in Charlottesville at First Presbyterian Church.\n\nListen\n\n“Telling Our Healing Stories”\n\nProf. Kate Burke and Ms.Terri Powers–both cancer survivors–tell the stories of their illness and discuss the role of faith in healing.\n\nListen\n\n“Beat The Rush”\n\nLed by experienced counselors, alumni, a pastor and other women from the community.\n\nAn annual lunch for all UVa first year women during the sorority rush season.
