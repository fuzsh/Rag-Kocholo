        "text": "We want to tell you about\n\none new book, happily and a bit urgently – we are one of the very few bookstores in the country to\n\nstock this and we couldn’t be more confident that it will be an exceptional\n\ngift for some of our friends and fans. This is very new, and we just got our shipment a few days ago. You ought to consider ordering it right away – it is a beautifully designed art book, a brilliant idea, precious and good for anyone. What a find!\n\nQu4rtets $35.00\n\npaperback, 102 pages\n\nY ou surely know the famous poem by T.S. Eliot called “Four Quartets“, a very important work in\n\nthe canon of American poetry, by one of the important voices of faith in the\n\nmodern world. In this new coffee-table sized,\n\npaperback gift book, a handful of contemporary artists and critics ruminate on the\n\nEliot piece and offer art, words, and music inspired by and in response to\n\nthis epic work. Is this a great idea, or\n\nwhat? Why didn’t somebody think of this\n\nsooner? We had heard that this was in the works — it was encouraged by CIVA (Christians in the Visual Arts) and IAM (International Arts Movement) and the Fujimura Institute, and we are thrilled it is finally out. Kudos to those who offered patronage, Walter & Darlene Hansen, Stephen & Denise Adams, Howard & Roberta Ahmanson and John & Jean Kingston, amongst others.\n\nRenowned Japanese-American\n\nartist Makoto Fujimura and Gordon College professor and painter Bruce\n\nHerman each contribute stunning original work for this book and classical musician\n\nChristopher Theofanidis offers a new musical composition, about which he\n\nwrites. These pieces alone make this a\n\none of a kind example of contemporary, profoundly Christian, illuminating art, illustrating ways in which evangelicals, especially, have deepened their\n\ncommitments to cultural engagement in recent decades. And it is so very interesting. There is a middle section, too,\n\nwhere the glossy paper folds out into a larger spread-sheet, showing the progression\n\nof a few key pieces. As you might guess, there are golds and yellows and hues of transcendence, developed by these stunning art workers. Qu4rtets is a project and artifact in which to rejoice, and with which to sit, to gaze and ponder.\n\nAdded to the vivid,\n\nabstract and imaginative art and ruminations on it by the artists and composer, there is an\n\nastute and glorious introduction by Image magazine editor, Gregory Wolfe. Wolfe is always worth reading and even with the economy of words demanded by a preface, he offers much, here.\n\nFurther, there are three very significant essays (also enhanced with lovely type and smaller\n\nart pieces throughout.) Matthew Milliner, James\n\nMcCullough, and Jeremy Begbie are the authors who add their critical\n\nreflections, celebrating and exploring not only the original work of Elliot\n\nbut of these recent works done in response to him. What\n\na joy to see them reflecting on Eliot and Herman, Eliot and Mako. What a\n\ngrand, collaborative effort this all is and what a grand gift that results. Qu4rtets is simply magnificent.\n\nHere is a description of the project from their own website:\n\nFour Quartets is relevant to our own cultural moment because of its\n\npowerful testimony to the grace and vision of the Gospel message in a\n\nmulticultural milieu. In Eliot’s vision all hinges upon the “still\n\npoint” where the human experience of time evokes wonder, fear and\n\nlonging for continuance and redemption, and where Christ’s presence is\n\nthe pivotal point for the entire Creation. Herman and Fujimura have made\n\na substantive response in painting, not so much illustrating Eliot’s\n\nwork or making direct allusion to passages in the poem as attempting to\n\nfind, in Eliot’s words, the “objective correlative,” between the poet’s\n\nthemes and their own works. Christopher Theofanidis has produced a\n\ncompelling score that evokes the brooding and brilliant light of Eliot’s\n\npoem. In effect, the painters and composer are collaborating in\n\nintentional dialogue with the poem, revealing the staying power of its\n\ngenius and its self-declared reliance on the Christian literary and\n\ntheological tradition.\n\nT hese seven contributors are true culture-makers, indeed, they are culture leaders, and to\n\nhave this handsome example of their work is a gift to behold, and it is a contribution from which we can learn. Of course we recommend it to the bookish and literate, the culturally engaged, those with a love for poetry and paint, for criticism and culture. But also for those who ought to know a bit about the contemporary world in which we live, the influences and impact of the art of our time, the joys and the sorrows, exposed by Mr. Eliot and by the faithful artists who use their imagination and insight to underscore and extrapolate.\n\nThe attractive paperback book was\n\ndesigned to accompany a touring show of this work which will appear throughout\n\n2013 starting at Baylor University (where it on display currently), moving to Duke University, Yale University, and Gordon\n\nCollege. One could hardly\n\nimagine a better idea for a book and we are truly thrilled to end the year on\n\nthis high note of book recommending. Buy\n\nthis now, maybe one for your own use, and one for a gift. Kudos to all involved. We thank them for allowing us the privilege of stocking it, and we thank you for supporting our work as a bookseller who finds these sorts of treasures, and passes the invitation on to you. All if this makes us very glad — glad for artists, for special independent book projects, for willing authors, and generous patrons, book buyers, of course, supporters. Thanks for reading BookNotes, for caring about this kind of thing, for allowing us to tell you about new books.\n\nfrom Qu4rtets “Spring/Earth/Childhood” (Bruce Herman)"
