        "text": "Robert W. Christensen, BM ’62, MM ’64\n\nMajor/Instrument: Composition/Trumpet\n\nStudio Teacher: Sidney Mear – Trumpet; Thomas Canning, Wayne Barlow, Louis Mennini, John LaMontaine – Composition\n\nLife and Career Since Eastman\n\nRobert Christensen has directed music schools and conducted choruses in New York City, Rochester (NY), Chicago, St. Louis, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. He founded and directed the Mohawk Valley Center for the Arts and the Mohawk Valley Choral Society in Upstate New York.\n\nAs a composer, such groups as the Chicago Chamber Orchestra, Boston Civic Orchestra, St. Louis Little Symphony, Gordon College Community Chorus and Orchestra have performed his works. He is published by Shaffner Publications, Choral Arts Society, and the Arts Publication Society. He is a member of BMI. He has devoted much of his career to writing and performing sacred choral music and is currently choir director and organist at the Church of the Reconciliation in Webster, MA.\n\nChristensen also has had a full career in non-profit management, first as director of music schools and for the last 15 years as a grantswriter and fundraiser; he currently serves as Director of Development and Communications for the Saint Antoine Community in N. Smithfield, RI.\n\nHe is married to Shelley (Christensen) and lives with their son, Mackenzie (a drummer) in Webster, MA. Between them, they have three sons and one daughter, as well as five grandchildren.\n\nPersonal Reflection\n\nI received an excellent foundation and experiences at the Eastman School of Music for a life in music. I met and became friends with some terrific and talented people who remain friends to this day.\n\nGale Furman Coffee, BM ’61\n\nMajor/Instrument: Flute\n\nStudio Teacher: Mariano\n\nLife and Career Since Eastman\n\nMM from School of Fine Arts, Boston University, 1963\n\nSolo performances at Isabelle Gardner Museum, WGBH FM, DeKalb, IL; Cheney & Spokane, WA; Missoula, MT; Seattle, WA\n\nMember, American Wind Symphony (2 yrs)\n\nSun Valley Music Festival Orchestra, New Hampshire Music Festival\n\nSpokane Symphony – 2nd Flute/1st Piccolo – 1970-2008\n\nPersonnel Manager, Spokane Symphony – 1989-2008\n\nBoard Member, Spokane String Quartet (SCMA)\n\nMena Marucci Colella, BM ’62,\n\nMajor/Instrument: Applied Music/Piano\n\nStudio Teacher: Orazio Frugoni\n\nLife and Career Since Eastman\n\nFollowing my marriage to a University of Rochester medical student, I continued my studies with Orazio Frugoni, at the Pius XII Graduate School of Fine Arts at Villa Schifanoia in Florence, Italy. Having previously won the Silver Medal, I again competed in the Geneva International Piano Competition that year, and continued studying privately with Frugoni for another two years in Rochester.\n\nIn 1973, I began participating in piano teacher master classes and lectures at the University of Maryland, which evolved into their International Piano Festival and Competition and eventually into the present-day William Kapell Competition. Meeting adjudicators and artists, I was exposed to a variety of styles and techniques from Lily Kraus to George Bolet. In addition to attending these concerts and seminars, I taught privately for many years, as my children grew.\n\nDuring her Maryland sessions, I became enthralled with Juilliard’s Adele Marcus and her approach to the keyboard, auditioning to study with her, in 1980. I initiated that work over the next four years. Subsequently, I continued to teach piano to my daughter, while she and my three sons also studied various wind instruments at Peabody. Later, I taught five of my 10 grandchildren, as well.\n\nThe Eastman School and the University of Rochester have represented key parts of my life. My husband graduated from the Medical School and my daughter and son-in-law from the River Campus. She incidentally continued her flute studies at Eastman, as an elective. Soon my granddaughter will begin her Freshman year at the U of R, an Early Decision enrollee.\n\nPersonal Reflection\n\nFrom the practice rooms to the studios, my time at Eastman presented me with many wonderful opportunities, from twice yearly recitals to accompanying various students and groups, to orchestral performances culminating with the Chopin 2nd Concerto with Howard Hanson and the Eastman Philharmonia. A special remembrance is having been led by Paul White with the Student Orchestra, in the Brahms 2nd Concerto, fulfilling a dream not only for me but for my father.\n\nMy years at Eastman generated a life-long love of music, encouraging my enjoyment of recitals, orchestral performances and opera with renowned artists, throughout the United States and Europe, as well as in my own home.\n\nJoyce Hansen Colotti, MM ’61\n\nMajor/Instrument: Music Education – Voice\n\nStudio Teacher: Anna Kaskas and Dr. Herman Genhart\n\nLife & Career Since Eastman\n\nI taught vocal K-12 as a member of MMTA (Minnesota Music Teachers Association) and NCTA (National Certified Teacher of Music). I have maintained a private voice and piano studio in my home. For the first time in the state, I had a high school young artist in voice + piano both performed at the state MMTA convention at the U of M the same year. Both continued on with college music studies. One of my students whom I’ve had from age 9 – HS senior was accepted at ESM and received a MM Ed and has been teaching in the Twin City area. I have been a vocal performing artist of the St. Paul Schubert Club. One of my performances the first again in the area of early Arnold Schoenberg artist songs.\n\nPersonal Reflection\n\nWhen I applied to ESM as a PhD Theory and Music Ed – after one week of ESM, I knew that what I wanted was to work and study with the caliber of teachers at ESM. I didn’t want to “read” about it, I wanted to “be” one of those lucky students of ESM. So I did! I was privileged to be accepted by Anna Kaskas and Dr. Herman Genhart. They accepted me in voice so I got the M. Mus. Ed degree in spite of having a MM in piano which I received from my previous college – McPhail. I’m so glad – and the fact of ESM would accept me instead of my PhD – Theory, Mus. Ed. Thanks!\n\nCarol Diane Critelli, MM ’62\n\nMajor/Instrument: Cello\n\nLife & Career Since Eastman\n\nInstructor at University of Montana, 1962-64\n\nAssociate Professor, Eastern Montana College, 1964-1987; now called Montana State University; retired in 1987\n\nCurrently private teacher of cello in Billings\n\nPerforms in Yellowstone Chamber Players (in Billings)\n\nRetired from Billings Symphony Orchestra & Rimrock Opera Orchestra\n\nPersonal Reflection\n\nAlthough many years have passed since I was a student at Eastman, I still remember my fellow classmates with great pleasure. I hope they have received as much satisfaction as I have in music as a career. I often think how fortunate I have been to work in a field that enriches one’s life so much.\n\nI am thankful to the Eastman School of Music and its faculty members who worked so hard with us. I hope that my students appreciate my efforts as much as I appreciate my former teachers.\n\nTony H. Dechario, BM ’62, MM ’63\n\nMajor/Instrument: Trombone\n\nStudio Teacher: Emory Remington\n\nLife & Career Since Eastman"
