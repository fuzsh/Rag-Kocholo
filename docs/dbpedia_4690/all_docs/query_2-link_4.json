Answering questions such as, What do you believe are some of the unique challenges facing Black students in Christian universities today, and how do you work to support and empower them? In your opinion, what can be done to address systemic racism and discrimination within Christian universities and communities? What are some books or movies that you consider helpful in exploring or learning about black history?\n\nSupport the Show.\n\nToday we have with us Sydney Dvorak, Angela Konrad and Kate Muchmore Woo to talk a student practicum project where over 100 theater posters spanning 50 years were digitized and archived in TWU’s Special Collections.\n\nFor more information about the project and to access the archive please see:\n\nhttps://create.twu.ca/library/2022/03/09/search-twu-theatre-production-posters-online/\n\nhttps://archivessearch.twu.ca/posters-3\n\nhttps://www.twu.ca/news-events/news/history-student-digitizes-over-100-theatre-production-posters-twu’s-archives-and\n\nLearning Matters: a Bridge to Practice\n\nDiscussing matters of learning and building bridges to practice.\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/learningmatters-twu\n\nPodcasting from Studio Yarah at Trinity Western University – hosted by Scott Macklin.\n\nSupport the Show.\n\nMissing episodes?\n\nClick here to refresh the feed.\n\nToday we have with us Monika B. Hilder who teaches in the English Department at Trinity Western University. Monika is an author, teacher, and speaker who specializes in Fantasy and Children’s Literature with a particular focus on the writings of C.S. Lewis and other Inklings-related writers. She edited The Inklings and Culture: A Harvest of Scholarship from the Inklings Institute of Canada (Co-edited with Sara Pearson and Laura Van Dyke).\n\nHow did five twentieth-century British authors, C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Charles Williams, Owen Barfield, and Dorothy L. Sayers, along with their mentors George MacDonald and G. K. Chesterton, come to contribute more to the intellect and imagination of millions than many of their literary contemporaries put together? How do their achievements continue to inform and potentially transform us in the twenty-first century?\n\nMonika serves as the Co-Director of the Inklings Institute of Canada (IIC). IIC encourages the advancement of Inklings scholarship through literary criticism and related collaborative research across the disciplines; investigates how these authors critiqued their own cultures and therefore help us to respond to our own historical/cultural context; promotes the publication of research and scholarship in peer-reviewed journals, books, and other suitable venues appropriate to the various disciplines; fosters undergraduate and graduate student involvement in such research and scholarship; seeks funding for Inklings research; contributes to the current return of religious language to public discourse—and does so within the campus, with associated members nationally and internationally, and with the general public.\n\nhttps://www.twu.ca/research/institutes-and-centres/university-institutes/inklings-institute-canada\n\nhttps://monikahilder.com/\n\nSupport the Show.\n\nToday we have with us Erica Grimm, Joshua Hale, Alysha Creighton, and Patti Victor, to talk about the opening their exhibition at the Langley Centennial Museum, titled \"Upstream/Downriver: Walking the stɑl̓əw̓ Watershed,\" a collaborative research-creation project that addresses climate change at the local scale of the lower Fraser River watershed.\n\nTWU faculty partnered with experts from a wide range of science, humanities, and Indigenous knowledge backgrounds to walk the stɑl̓əw̓ Watershed, experts including Dr. Heesoon Bai (SFU), Dr. Katharine Bubel, Dr. David Clements, Dr. Tim Cooper (UFV), David Jordan, Dr. Maxwell Ofosuhene, Dr. Sam Pimentel, Dr. Bruce Shelvey, Annelyn Victor (Xwchíyò:m Nation), and Chief Andrew Victor (Xwchíyò:m Nation).\n\nSupport the Show.\n\nToday we have with us Russ Rosen discussing the Bez Arts Hub as a place for nurturing creativity and planting seeds for the harvest of ones life’s work.\n\nLearning Matters series on convening methodologies for holding space for hope, healing and restoration.\n\nRuss serves the artistic director at Bez Arts Hub in Langley, BC where he and his wife (Sandy) train and mentor emerging artists, host live music events, dance shows, workshops and all manner of arts and community interactions.

He was selected as the recipient of the 2018 Distinguished Teaching Award. His scholarship explores the evolution of transnational political identities and their impact on civic engagement and political participation, with a focus on Palestinians and American Muslims. As an interdisciplinary social scientist, he examines social contexts related to religion, identity, and politics to describe, explain, and provide answers to persisting theoretical and policy questions. The overarching theme of his scholarly journey is centered on how ethno-, socio-political, and religious identities are formed, evolve, and transform under different socio-economic and political circumstances.\n\nHie is the founding Director of The American Muslim Research Institute (AMRI), and the co-Principal Investigator of The Muslim American Public Opinion Survey (MAPOS), which remains one of the largest surveys of Muslims in the US, a decade on.

Hunter’s first tool was the violin accompanying him on laps around the world. Playing since age 5, he was fortunate to travel the world and absorb various musical styles at a young age. Receiving his degree in Performance Violin, with keen interest in politics and philosophy, Hunter set his sights on the intersection between art, community, and a rapidly evolving clash of culture. Touring with his band mate Joe Seamons in the internationally acclaimed, award-winning blues duo, Ben Hunter & Joe Seamons, Hunter’s stirring instrumentation and timbre brought tales of the slave trade, reconstruction, racial reconciliation, and America’s still broken promises to the uninclined.\n\n​\n\nSeeking to formalize the education he received in school and delivered in music venues across the world, Hunter then founded Community Arts Create. In a time when music and arts education is being surgically extracted from school curriculums, the non-profit seeks to create space and opportunity for people of all ages and backgrounds to engage with their individual and collective creative identities, using that as a lens to view their connection with social justice. However, schools only provided a temporary sanctum for Hunter’s gospel of changing the world through art. He needed a headquarters that existed for the sole purpose of bridging divides, filling knowledge gaps, and fostering a community around those ideals.\n\n​\n\nThe Hillman City Collaboratory was soon formed. Housed in South Seattle’s Hillman City neighborhood, the “social incubator” has brought and maintained camaraderie, inclusiveness, education, and social wellbeing to the residents in and around an area that is seeing rapid shifts due to unrelenting displacement. His ultimate wish is to inspire a Collaboratory in every underserved community in the nation, showcasing the collective might of community members defying precarious economic circumstances through creativity, engagement, and dialogue. That still wasn't enough for Hunter, and in 2016 he co-founded the Black & Tan Hall, a co-operatively owned restaurant and performing arts venue, shifting the for-profit paradigm to an alternative platform that is hyper-local, built by and for people rooted in community, and serves as an anti-gentrification model that combats displacement and sustains good jobs. More specifically, B&TH supports and elevates arts that give voice, agency, and power to those too often ignored. A place where art and the artists are dignified, valued, and heard!\n\nTo find out more about Benjamin’s work, check out: www.benjaminhuntermusic.com\n\nCommunity Arts Create collective education\n\nHillman City Collaboratory social incubator\n\nBlack & Tan Hall co-operatively owned restaurant and performing arts venue\n\nSupport the Show.\n\nToday we have with us Lisa Levine discussing helping people to get unstuck and reconnected to limitless possibilities.\n\nLearning Matters series on convening methodologies for holding space for hope, healing and restoration.\n\nLisa is a Certified Life and Health Coach at Audacious Health & Wellness.
