        "text": "Barbara Morgan, who will go on to become Martha Graham's primary photographer, joins UCLA's first graduating class with a focus in design. She receives her teaching degree in 1923 and is a member of the faculty from 1926 to 1931.\n\nHaving been located on Vermont Avenue for its first ten years, the university moves to a brand-new Westwood campus that opens with 5,544 students and four permanent buildings, including Royce Hall.\n\nLaura Andreson begins working in and teaching ceramics, establishing the medium as an important one at UCLA early on. Students in the 1930s source their own clay from the streams surrounding the still-sparse Westwood campus.\n\nThe painter Annita Delano (an influential faculty member from 1919 to 1962) cultivates relationships with major modern art collectors, including Galka Scheyer and Walter and Louise Arensberg. Scheyer's collection of work by Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, and others (now at the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena) becomes the subject of several small exhibitions that Delano installs for students to study up close.\n\nThe College of Applied Arts is founded with six departments, one of them the Department of Art, making it possible for the first time for students to major in art at UCLA, separately from the original Teachers' College.\n\nWith the passage of the GI Bill, which provides soldiers returning from World War II with a free education, thousands of veterans flood universities, including art departments, shifting the gender dynamics at institutions nationwide, including UCLA. Artists such as Ed Moses, BA '55/MA '58, and Ronald Reiss, BA '55/MA '56, take advantage of this program.\n\nThe art faculty soon becomes male-dominated, with figurative painters Gordon Nunes and Jan Stussy, and later Sam Amato and the abstract painter William Brice, joining its ranks. All of them exhibit their work at the city's then-prominent modern art galleries, Felix Landau and Paul Kantor.\n\nClinton Adams joins the faculty, after having been a student in the late 1930s. A painter, Adams soon delves into printmaking, eventually becoming director of the prominent master print shop Tamarind, founded by June Wayne (who herself later serves as a visiting professor in the department).\n\nMartin Friedman receives his MA in art and art history. Beginning in the 1960s, he will serve for decades as director of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, playing a crucial role in putting that institution at the forefront of the contemporary art world.\n\nThe modernist sculptor Anna Mahler, daughter of composer Gustav Mahler, joins the department for the year as a visiting faculty member. Her work will later be installed permanently on campus as part of the Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden.\n\nDanes oversees the founding of the UCLA Art Galleries, which are established to present student and faculty shows as well as contemporary and historical exhibitions. He hires Frederick S. Wight, an artist, professor, and curator, who mounts exhibitions on a wide range of subjects, for instance architect Richard Neutra, Spanish masters, the art of the Congo, and the Bauhaus.\n\nJohn Paul Jones is hired to establish a program in printmaking—a medium that is experiencing a rebirth in the field of fine arts.\n\nThe College of Applied Arts is reestablished as the College of Fine Arts, offering degrees in art, dance, music, and theater, with the goal of balancing theory and practice.\n\nFranklin D. Murphy is named the third chancellor of UCLA. He is a firm believer in the importance of the arts as part of the university experience and is an ally in continuing to develop the art history and painting departments, as well as the university galleries.\n\nChancellor Franklin D. Murphy establishes the UCLA Student Committee for the Arts (SCA), composed of graduate and undergraduate students, to encourage student awareness of and participation in the arts at UCLA.\n\nFranklin D. Murphy successfully recruits the painter Richard Diebenkorn to join the department. Diebenkorn moves his studio from San Francisco to Santa Monica and remains on the faculty until 1973, his career growing exponentially during his UCLA years.\n\nThanks to the efforts of Robert Heinecken, photography is offered for the first time as an area of study at the graduate level. This program is one of the first of its kind in the nation, at a time when photography was still struggling to be valued as a fine art medium.\n\nVasa (Velizar Mihich) joins the faculty, which will eventually split between art and design, and does not retire from the department until fifty years later.\n\nCharles E. Young is named UCLA chancellor, succeeding Franklin D. Murphy. He will serve in that office for twenty-nine years, until 1997, and continue Murphy's dedication to fostering the study of art on campus.\n\nThe UCLA Art Galleries are renamed the Frederick S. Wight Art Gallery in honor of the galleries' founding director, then chair of the Department of Art.\n\nRobert Heinecken is awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in photography and convenes an important summer symposium on the medium, including the curator Carl Chiarenza and the artists Judith Golden and Todd Walker.\n\nChris Burden begins teaching in the department, earning tenure in 1986. He institutes a new study area, New Genres, which for the first time incorporates performance and video and ushers in a new era of avant-garde artistic research at UCLA.\n\nEmulating Robert Heinecken's commitment to bringing world-class visiting professors to the photography program, other subject areas attract a steady stream of artists for visiting positions beginning in the late 1970s, including Magdalena Abakanowicz, Vito Acconci, Mike Kelley, Yoshitomo Nara, Bruce Nauman, Carolee Schneemann, and Alexis Smith.\n\nOnly a few years into his career, Charles Ray joins the faculty, soon becoming one of the contemporary art world's most prominent sculptors.\n\nPaul McCarthy is hired onto the arts faculty, joining Chris Burden in New Genres, and contributes another performance- and video-based practice to the expanding department.\n\nThe graduate art studios move to an industrial zone of Culver City at the corner of Warner Drive and Hayden Avenue, and are soon known as the UCLA Warner Graduate Studios. Heading into the 1990s, annual open-studio events there become important moments on the art world calendar.\n\nPainters Roger Herman and Patty Wickman join the faculty as professors of painting and drawing, both beginning decades-long careers of teaching in the department.\n\nThe exhibition Teaching Artists at UCLA's Wight Art Gallery makes clear an aspect of the Los Angeles art scene that is perhaps less valued on the East Coast: that to teach is an important and desirable part of an artist's life and practice.\n\nThe Department of Art and the Department of Design separate into distinct academic units with separate faculties when the College of Fine Arts undergoes restructuring. Art history, previously part of the art department, moves to the College of Letters and Science.\n\nThe exhibition Helter Skelter: L.A. Art in the 1990s, curated by Paul Schimmel at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, receives considerable press and puts a new generation of Los Angeles artists on the map, including many UCLA artists: faculty Chris Burden, Paul McCarthy, Lari Pittman, Charles Ray, and Nancy Rubins, and alumnus Raymond Pettibon, BA '77.\n\nSeveral UCLA artists—Chris Burden, Raymond Pettibon, BA '77, and Charles Ray (as well as future faculty members Lari Pittman and Andrea Fraser)—are included in the 1993 Whitney Biennial, an influential and controversial edition due to its focus on politically relevant subjects such as race, gender, and identity.\n\nThe arts programs at UCLA are restructured as the School of the Arts and Architecture, with the addition of Architecture and Urban Design.\n\nJason Rhoades, MFA '93, student and collaborator of Paul McCarthy, has his first post-MFA exhibition at Rosamund Felsen Gallery. It propels him to the forefront of the contemporary art scene and is described by Los Angeles Times art critic Christopher Knight as \"one of the most ambitious and memorable gallery solo-debuts I've seen.\"\n\nUCLA takes over the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center, later the Hammer Museum, which begins its gradual transformation into a leading center for contemporary art. It eventually establishes deep relationships with members of the arts faculty and serves as a major resource to students.\n\nJames Welling is hired to head the photography program at UCLA, following in the strong tradition that Robert Heinecken had started, and soon begins recruiting Catherine Opie to join him.\n\nAfter teaching in the department for ten years (ever since his departure from CalArts in 1986), the renowned conceptual artist John Baldessari joins the art faculty as a full professor.\n\nDaniel Neuman, a professor in the Department of Ethnomusicology since 1995, is named dean of the School of the Arts and Architecture.\n\nThe 1997 Whitney Biennial is wryly dubbed the \"UCLA Biennial,\" reflecting the sheer number of artists associated with the school represented in the exhibition—nearly one-third of the faculty and numerous recent graduates.\n\nMary Kelly organizes the first of her Spring Symposia at UCLA, which bring together major voices in contemporary art, theory, and criticism around a particular theme. The first, \"On the Ugly,\" includes talks by renowned critics and artists Hal Foster, Rosalind Krauss, Mark Cousins, Fred Wilson, and Yvonne Rainer. Kelly organizes six more symposia over the next eight years, contributing crucial dialogues to the university art community and beyond.\n\nDennis Cooper's \"Too Cool for School\" article in Spin magazine brings national attention to the department's current students, their unconventional aesthetic approaches, and the intense interest they are attracting from curators and collectors. Artists photographed and interviewed include Liz Craft, MFA '97, and Evan Holloway MFA '97. Charles Ray notes of the school's success: \"Most art schools are about teachers and students. UCLA is about artists working as artists.\"\n\nVija Celmins, MFA '65, receives a MacArthur Foundation \"genius grant\" in recognition of her renowned career as a painter, sculptor, draughtsman, and printmaker.\n\nIn a long article in the New York Times Magazine (\"How to Succeed in Art\") journalist Deborah Solomon features UCLA's art department as a lens through which to examine the prevalence and growing importance of the MFA degree.\n\nBarbara Drucker becomes department chair.\n\nFaculty member Adrian Saxe receives both a Flintridge Foundation award and a Guggenheim Fellowship. Several years later, in 2009, his work is featured in a major ceramics exhibition, Dirt on Delight: Impulses That Form Clay, that travels from the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.\n\nOnly six years after receiving her MFA at UCLA, Toba Khedoori, MFA '94, is awarded a \"genius grant\" from the MacArthur Foundation.\n\nAfter being named acting dean the previous year, Christopher Waterman, professor in the Department of World Arts and Cultures since 1996, is named dean of the School of the Arts and Architecture.\n\nJennifer Bolande, whose widely exhibited work spans numerous mediums, joins the faculty in the New Genres program. Two years later, she is awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, one of her numerous past and future awards.\n\nAndrea Fraser joins the New Genres program, adding her experience as a renowned artist and thinker to its ranks.\n\nHirsch Perlman joins the faculty.\n\nOn the footprint of the former Dickson Art Center, the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Center opens. Richard Serra's sculpture T.E.U.C.L.A. (2006) is installed on an adjacent plaza, made possible by a $23.2 million gift from the Broad Foundation.\n\nHirsch Perlman's work is featured in four solo exhibitions in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Madrid.\n\nRussell Ferguson, previously senior curator at the Hammer Museum and an established scholar and critic, joins the UCLA faculty and becomes chair of the Department of Art.\n\nCatherine Opie guides the establishment of the UCLA Department of Art Visiting Artists Lecture Series at the Hammer Museum, which becomes an important facet of the museum's annual programming. In addition to faculty and former students (including Evan Holloway, MFA '97, and Yoshua Okón, MFA '02), the series has featured such artists as Sam Durant, Dan Graham, Wangechi Mutu, Laura Owens, Jeff Wall, and Rachel Whiteread.\n\nChris Burden's large-scale public work Urban Light debuts at the inauguration of LACMA's new entrance plaza. It quickly becomes a beloved L.A. icon, dubbed by Curbed L.A. \"Los Angeles's Great Landmark for the Twenty-First Century.\"\n\nAfter a celebrated run outside the Punta della Dogana museum in Venice, Charles Ray's sculpture Boy with Frog is installed on the main staircase entrance to the Getty Museum, where it instantly becomes an iconic addition to the institution's public art offerings.\n\nFrom fall 2011 to spring 2012, dozens of exhibitions take place across the greater Los Angeles area as part of the Getty's unprecedented exhibition initiative Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A., 1945–1980, focusing on the history of art in Southern California. Numerous UCLA artists are included, solidifying the school's importance in the development of the contemporary art scene.\n\nThe Hammer Museum establishes the first biennial of art from Los Angeles, Made in L.A. A testament to the strength of the department, the inaugural edition includes more than a dozen UCLA art alumni: Math Bass, MFA '11, Michelle Dizon, MFA '08, Patricia Fernandez, BA '02, Pearl C. Hsiung, MFA '97, Vishal Jugdeo, MFA '07, Mimi Lauter, BA '05, Dashiell Manley, MFA '11, Allison Miller, MFA '01, Meleko Mokgosi, MFA '11, Ruby Neri, MFA '98, D'Ette Nogle, MFA '00, Camilo Ontiveros, MFA '09, Ry Rocklen, BA '02, Analia Saban, MFA '05, Ryan Sluggett, MFA '11, David Snyder, MFA '10, and Brenna Youngblood, MFA '06.\n\nFor her groundbreaking work in photography, Uta Barth, MFA '85, receives a MacArthur Foundation \"genius grant.\"\n\nHirsch Perlman is named chair of the Department of Art.\n\nPainter Silke Otto-Knapp joins the art faculty, and two years later is featured in the Hammer Museum's Made in L.A. 2016 biennial, along with alumni Rafa Esparza, BA '11, and Gala Porras-Kim, BA '07.\n\nGuggenheim Fellowships are awarded to three arts alumni: Phyllis Green, MFA '81, Sharon Hayes, MFA '03, and Xavier Cha, MFA '04.\n\nChris Burden, Andrea Fraser, Barbara Kruger, Paul McCarthy, Catherine Opie, Lari Pittman, and Charles Ray are included in America Is Hard to See, the inaugural exhibition at the new location of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.\n\nThe major reinstallation of MOCA Los Angeles's permanent collection, The Art of Our Time, includes a large number of professors (Chris Burden, Andrea Fraser, Catherine Opie, Lari Pittman) and former students (Vija Celmins, MFA '65, John Divola, MFA '74, Sharon Hayes, MFA '03, Elliott Hundley, MFA '05, Betye Saar, BA '49) working across a range of mediums.\n\nThe Broad Museum opens in downtown Los Angeles with an inaugural exhibition that features the work of faculty members John Baldessari, Barbara Kruger, and Charles Ray, among others.\n\nSeveral UCLA faculty and alumni receive fellowships from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, including Mary Kelly, Tim Hawkinson, MFA '89, Vishal Jugdeo, MFA '07, and Michael C. McMillen, MFA '73.\n\nAs of 2015, the Board of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, includes four current or retired professors from UCLA's Department of Art: John Baldessari, Barbara Kruger, Catherine Opie, and Lari Pittman.\n\nWu Tsang, MFA '10, is awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in film and video.\n\nWith generous lead funding from Margo Leavin, the UCLA Department of Art announces plans to build a new $31 million complex to house its graduate artist studios, replacing the Warner Graduate Studios building in Culver City.\n\nThe School of the Arts and Architecture at UCLA ranks number two on U.S. News & World Report list of best art schools in the country.\n\nWu Tsang, MFA '10, is awarded a MacArthur Fellowship."
