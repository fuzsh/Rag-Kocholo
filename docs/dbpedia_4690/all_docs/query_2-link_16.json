        "text": "Danielle Herman has a 10-year plan. While the Binghamton University student’s plan is multi-faceted and consists of many different college degrees, it all revolves around the creation of art.\n\n\"Everyone’s worried about where they’re going to be in the future and what’s going to happen,” Herman, 21, of Vestal, said. “Doing art and designing and thinking and being innovative makes you not so afraid of the future. I’m working for it. I have my stepping stone.”\n\nHerman graduated from Owego Free Academy in 2012 and received an associate’s degree in visual communications from SUNY Broome Community College. She is now working on a bachelor’s degree in graphic design, with a minor in painting. From there, she plans to pursue a master’s degree in fine arts, with a teaching minor, at SUNY New Paltz and then move on to the Fashion Institute of Technology to pursue fashion design.\n\n“Just going to fashion design, you have a thinking box. You’re only thinking about fashion design,” Herman said. “While, if you do graphic design or if you do visual communications and then you do fine arts and you have teaching under your belt, and painting, you understand how everything works. I could potentially, in the future, make a dress that’s all out of oil paint.\"\n\nA baggy black T-shirt shielded her clothing from excess paint flying through an art studio inside the Binghamton University Fine Arts Building. A multi-colored striped miniskirt poked out from beneath the makeshift smock, the skirt’s purple tones matching her long purple hair.\n\n“I feel like I have almost zero fashion sense,” Herman said. “I just kind of throw on whatever right now. But, I definitely care. I definitely notice other things.\"\n\nMost recently, painting has been added to Herman’s plan. She began painting three years ago, as a requirement for a public mural class at SUNY Broome Community College. Although Herman said she was “not even thinking about painting at all,” her very first painting — a religious-themed painting featuring a girl with blue hair — was praised by professor Bruce Greig. Since then, Herman began selling her paintings.\n\nHerman’s specialty is portraits, which she also produces at Binghamton University. An unfinished, yet familiar, face stretched across a four-foot canvas in the studio.\n\n“It’s going to say ‘get that baby out of here,’” Herman said while looking at her portrait of Donald Trump, inspired by an August speech by Trump that was interrupted by a baby's cries.\n\nIn addition to selling her paintings, Herman also works as a graphic designer for Bullseye Signs & Graphics and assists with custom framing at Michael’s. With interests also in sculpting, pottery and glass blowing, Herman said there isn’t a medium she wouldn’t try.\n\nAfter all, being exposed to numerous forms of art is all part of her plan.\n\n“That’s how I’m trying to get a leg up and [an] advantage,\" Herman said, \"by getting all of that experience ahead of time.”\n\nFollow @MaggieGilroy on Twitter\n\nDo you consider yourself a creator?
