Prior to joining Rutgers University, she was an Associate Professor at the University of Western Ontario in Canada. She did her Ph.D in the Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics, at McGill University, Montreal, Canada followed by postdoctoral studies at the Robarts Research Institute in Ontario. Dr. Bhattacharya has mentored many trainees; her trainees acquire multidisciplinary training and attain specialized skills in pre-clinical animal models, advanced molecular imaging, molecular techniques and translational research.\n\nThe Bhattacharya lab is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms by which G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate metabolic disorders such as cancer (breast and liver cancer) and obesity induced fatty liver disease. These multidisciplinary studies are conducted using cell and 3-D culture models, genetically engineered mouse models as well as clinical biopsies and blood samples.\n\nOur Research Team\n\nMagdalena Dragan\n\nResearch Associate\n\nStephania Guzman\n\nPh.D Candidate\n\nShivani Rao\n\nResearch Assistant\n\nAmy Narakornpichit\n\nUndergraduate Student\n\nContact Us\n\nClinical Academic Building\n\n125 Paterson Street, CAB 7148\n\nPhone: (732) 235-5269\n\nEmail: moshmi.bhattacharya@rutgers.edu\n\nThe Babwah Laboratory studies the regulation of female fertility through a better understanding of pubertal development and early pregnancy events.\n\nIt is estimated that in the US alone, 10% or over 6 million women of reproductive age suffer from infertility. Infertility is caused by many defects that may arise before or after the onset of puberty. To better understand the regulation of fertility, the Babwah laboratory has focused its attention on the uterus. Here they study the roles of several estradiol- and/or progesterone-regulated factors in regulating the preimplantation and early post-implantation periods of pregnancy in both mice and women. Their studies specifically test how these factors regulate the acquisition of uterine receptivity, embryo implantation, decidualization, decidual function and early placentation. Among their findings, they have identified critical roles for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in regulating progesterone receptor signaling and demonstrated that a lack of GPCR signaling blocks the acquisition of uterine receptivity. Their work has also focused on understanding the negative impact of gonadotropin-dependent ovarian stimulation, an important aspect of in vitro fertilization, on embryo implantation.\n\nDr. Babwah is committed to the training of highly qualified personnel through research mentorship and teaching, particularly in the area of continuing medical education. He currently holds appointments in the Department of Pediatrics, Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, The Child Health Institute of New Jersey, and several Rutgers Graduate School Programs (Endocrinology and Animal Biosciences, Molecular Biosciences and The Joint Graduate Program in Toxicology).\n\nOur Research Team\n\nJennifer Schaefer, Ph.D, candidate - Jennifer is a Ph.D, candidate from the Joint Graduate Program in Toxicology (JGPT) completing her thesis research under the supervision of Drs. Andy Babwah and Sally Radovick. In the lab she investigates the role of GÎ±q/11-coupled receptors (KISS1R & GPR83) in female fertility status and early pregnancy events from uterine receptivity to placentation using transgenic mouse models.\n\nThe mission of the Metabolomics Research Lab is to provide services that support Rutgers Cancer Institute's national leadership in the field of cancer metabolism including: services that enable the analysis of the metabolic state of tumors from cell and mouse models as well as from clinical samples, including the quantitation of metabolites and lipids; analytical instruments that enable the identification of novel cancer targets by identifying novel and unexpected metabolites; methodological development in the field of spatial metabolomics, and imaging mass spectrometry to enable single-cell resolution.\n\nXiaoyang Su, PhD, serves as MSR co-Director. Dr. Su has an extensive background in biochemistry, analytical chemistry, and computational biology and has developed experimental and computational methods for metabolomics that markedly improve measurements of isotope labeling and fluxes. These tools contribute substantially to the training and research services offered.\n\nMore on the Metabolomics Research Lab"
