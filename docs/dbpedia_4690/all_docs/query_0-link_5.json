Steve Brereton, President of the AMS noted that \"staffing problems have arisen as a result of the resignation of Reg Rickaby.\" Rickaby had been named winter Pub manager in the spring. Rickaby, when asked about his reasons for his resignation, ex- pressed his lack of faith in the AMS and in its handling of the summer Pub operation. In ad- dition, he said, \"the AMS is getting away from the original objectives that were laid down when the Pub first went into operation five years ago.\" Brereton, when questioned about the possibility of naming an acting Manager, he said that \"it was felt that an interim staff would be totally inappropriate.\" Applications for the positions of winter Pub manager and assistant managers will be re- opened and a committee set up to select the new management. Until the AMS Outer Council ratifies the committee's choice, it appears that the Pub will remain closed. When asked about the situation. Queen's Student Agencies (QSA) director.Paul Mahaffy said, \"as is the case with the Typing Service, the Pub will not open until controls and the proper procedures are open to us.\" He added, \"the AMS will not leap into these things without considering the financial feasibility of the operation. We hope to put more method into our madness.\" Brereton noted that no residual money remains from the summer operation in order to float an advance for an early operation of the Pub. Also, \"it is our concern that we do not run into the same problems we encountered during the summer, when the cost of handling beer was exorbitant,\" he added. \"We must also consider what kind of orientation the AMS wishes to provide. Does it mean introducing the freshmen to the Pub as the centre of campus activity?\" he asked. Besides, he said, \"the AMS does not exist solely to provide pubs.\" Underground parking lot open by Bob Mutrie After considerable delay, the underground parking garage under the lower campus playing field on Stuart Street has finally opened. However, Queen's faculty and students are still without a playing field. The parldng garage, which was originally scheduled for opening last spring, was opened on September 4 to provide parking for 700 Queen's students and employees as well as employees and visitors of Kingston General Hospital. Parking will be provided on either a long or a short-term basis. Students.faculty and staff may obtain eight month permits from the Parking Office in the Physical Plant at a charge of $120. Parking is also provided at a charge of twenty-five cents per hour or $2.00 for eight con- secutive hours or more up to a maximum of twenty-four con- secutive hours. Rain was given as the cause for the delay in finishing the garage. Last May the inordinate amount of rainfall held up construction for some time. When the top soil could finally be put in place and the grass seed planted, there was not enough rain. As a result, the playing field will not be in con- dition for use for another year. Library exceeds million mark Sometime during the spring, Douglas Library joined the libraries of the University of Toronto and the University of Western Ontario as the universities in Ontario having holdings of over a million volumes. The passing of the milestone figure was discovered after a physical count of library resources was taken at the end of June. It wa!s revealed that the total holdings of the library, including government documents, had reached a total of 1,038,000 books. Donald A. Redmond, Chief Librarian at Queen's, stated that \"no special volume of celebration was planned to mark the oc- casion. We are adding books all the time as faculty members and students request them for their studies. It is appropriate that the millonth book was one which someone on the campus needed for his work.\" Eight years ago, Queen's had library resources of almost 500,000 volumes. Four years ago, the figure had reached 750,000, representing a growth rate of over 70,000 volumes a year since 1969. In addition to books, the Library has over half a milhon other -items — 412,000 microforms; 82,000 maps, 20,000 pamphlets, 6,500 musical scores, 5,000 sound recordings, 2,400 films and filmstrips, and 22,000 photographs. ^^Bke yCnir date to a v^ld^mous iBstauTaiit m f McDonaldis I ■ I® 277 BATH RD. Queen's surpasses enrolment projection \"We will have more freshmen entering Queen's than we ex- pected,\" commented H.W. Sterne, assistant Registrar (Ad- missions). An estimated 2300 first year students in all faculties will be participating in Orientation programs this week. According to Sterne, total enrolment will be in excess of the projected 8900. \"We expect a total enrolment of over 9000,\" he added. At a time of stabilizing enrolment in Ontario, Queen's remains one of the only institutions to meet or surpass its enrolment ob- jectives. The only other university to come close to meeting projections is the university of Toronto, St. George campus. However, both Scarboro and Erindale colleges are well below target. At other universities many professional programs such as Nursing, Architecture and Physical Education are filled; however, hardest hit are the Faculties of Arts and Science. Those institutions with only Arts and Science programs such as Trent and Brock have been most seriously affected. In addition to decreased applications from High School many universities have suffered drastic declines in upper year enrolments. More than one university has lost several hundred students between first and second year ; many have simply failed to show up at registration. The no-show situation has not yet been a problem at Queen's but authorities are watching the situation closely. mm TAK in operation Found at 544-1771, Telephone Aid Kingston (TAK) offers you a friend from 7 pm to 7 am daily. Just formed last spring, TAK is a student operated listening ser- vice and referral and information centre. TAK volunteers are students and are anything but amateur psychologist-counsellors with a hatful of advice. They just promise to be there when someone needs a friend or a good listener. However, professional coun- sellors from the city hospitals, the university of Psychology Department and the student counselling services are always on call for emergencies or par- ticularly difficult problems. All TAK volunteers are given basic training in the supplying of information, in telephone procedure, human problems, and in establishing quick, close relationships with callers. All must be capable, emphatic listeners and not judgemental or anxiety prone. TAK volunteers are willing to listen and assist others with problems of an emotional academic, family, sexual, or financial nature. They also maintain a knowledge of campus activities and will give out in- formation of that nature. All calls are kept confidential, and callers may remain entirely anonymous.

Gaels, bosses, frees, proctors, floor seniors, and professors alike will attempt to impart to the freshmen, their knowledge of Queen's. Advice will be easily come by. In- formation sources will be plentiful. Traditions will be passed on as the new members of our community gradually become integrated. Well-worn cliches about university life will be heard everywhere, as some greet a new phase in their lives and as others review what went before. The cliches - they all apply. ' \"University is an encounter with yourself. If you do not find your time here disturbing or difficult, you have missed its purpose. University is one person - you. \"The multiversity can lose you; you can find everything. This unique setting offers a myriad of opportunities external, internal, social, soul. . . \"Frightening and forbidding at first, the campus becomes familiar from a growing organic association . . . \"A freshman fast learns the places. The pub, the Manor, are watering places; the coffee shop, the Purple Room, are people places. Agnes, the lake, are private places. Living in a residence complex, sharing with your cellmates, the monotony of meal lines, the tentative forays into friendship, sometimes makes you feel you are nothing more than a tiny appendage on a giant centipede. The whole place may be screaming, yet you can be very much alone. . . \"Limestone, lecture halls, and labs are yours to find. . . \"The encounter is painful but priceless.\". . . (Tricolor '70) This week, this year, this segment of one's life - can be everything, or nothing. University will be exactly what the in- dividual decides to make it. Frosh think too The student entering Queen's for the first time is barely given time to register before he is assaulted by people who feel it their duty to tell him why he is here. The freshman's reason for coming to university is something which he is never expected to know for himself. A freshman who seems to possess any definite ideas on the subject is regarded with a kind of amused scorn, and he requires an extremely strong will if he is not to become completely confused by those who insist that he must conform to their ideas of how he should spend his years at Queen's. It is no wonder that the freshman sometimes spends most of his first year in a confused daze or a state of bored apathy. His first week here can bring about one of two results. He may throw up his hands in despair and follow none of the advice he has been given, or he may try to do everything which has been suggested, entering into a dozen extracurricular activities, trying at the same time to keep up with his studies and ending the year in a state of nervous exhaustion. It would not be so bad if the varied forms of advice possessed some degree of correlation, but he is told that he is here primarily to get an education and his text-books must occupy almost all his time; that one of the most important aspects of university is the social one, and he must wear himself out making friends and doing things; that education is a wonderful thing and an end in itself ; that he should limit himself to one extracurricular activity and do it well ; that his interests should include everything from the Drama Guild to the Math and Physics Club. The list goes on indefinitely. . . Those who feel it necessary to set the fresh- man straight do have some justification. It is well known that few high schools do anything toward preparing students for what they will encounter at university, and it is therefore assumed that the new student is in complete ignorance. But this is not a logical assumption. If a new student did not have some ideas of what he wants from university he would not be here. It is time he was given credit for being able to think for himself. Editorial September 27, 1955 Queen's tradifions \"Every tradition grows ever more venerable - the nnore remote its origin, the more confused that origin is. The reverence due to it increases from generation to generation. The tradition finally becomes holy and inspires awe.\" — Nietzsche, 1878 would bate up an innocent student on a truped-up charge, convict, and fine him. . . . From the proceeds, refresh- ments — need I say from here — were purchased for the Court. From this beginning the AMS Court aided by the Constables, has gained control over all discipline for non- academic activities. The right to discipline ourselves is one of the most important rights of Queen 'smen. . . Perhaps the tradition of which I am most proud — and one which I hope you will come to cherish — is the tradition of equality. In- dicative of this equality is the ban on \"Frats\" . . . The final tradition I wish to emphasize is that of academic excellence ... you will not be doing Queen's justice unless you strive to learn . . .\" - From Queen's Journal, Sept. 2 4, 1 9 6 3. \"The first tradition that a newcomer encounters is the Scottish tradition. Queen's was founded in 1841 by the Presbyterian Church of Canada with the help of the Church of Scotland ... the most obvious links now are the tams, the tribal incantations of Oil Thigh, the name of Ban Righ Hall (House of Queen's), the kilted pipe band, the Scottish dancers at football games, the name of the Golden Gaels etc. . . . A second tradition of which Queen's is proud is that of a strong and independent students' government ~ the Alma Mater Society. Queen's has the oldest student government in Canada founded in 1858. . .\" The AMS Court is a third tradition. . .its beginnings are dubious, beginning in a vacant lot behind a brewery where senior students would gather and form a court.

DUNNING HALL AUDITORIUM FREE CONCERT by Kiloran German It's a good thing that there are plenty of activities on campus this week, because the en- tertainment currently offered in downtown Kingston is dreary, to say the least. Easily the dreariest of the cinematic offerings is \"A Warm December\" at the Capitol Theatre. This latest effort of Sidney Poitier's is a carbon copy of \"Love Story\", that's been painted black and then whitewashed. Under his own heavy handed direction, Poitier gives a heavy handed performance as a crusading young doctor on holiday in London with his motherless child. He falls in love with a mysterious young woniiin who spends her lime dodging followers, charming her u;iy through the British diplomatic circles, and dying of the inevitable fatal disease. The plot would be barely acceptable for a T.V. soap opera. The two young lovers who have supposedly sacrificed all for the betterment of mankind, trot around looking like Vogue fashion plates, and living like millionaires. The extent of their social consciousness seems to be limited to buying ice cream and balloons for a bunch of London urchins. Despite (he efforts of Esther Anderson, a reasonably talented actress who attempts to breathe some lite into her role as the ill laled heroine, the film has no redeeming (|ualities. The photography is poor, the editing IS jiiinpy and the music is insipid. rtie characters are is at Agnes Etherington Art Centre Do not fail to see this major exhibition opened by the Secretary of State on June 3 and continuing to October 28 Note new GALLERY HOURS: Monday to Friday 9 to 5; Saturday and Sunday 1 to 5; Tuesday & Thursday evenings 7 to 9 stereotype Negroes who have been slickly packaged for the white market. This is the sort of black exploitation film that would be sickening if it wasn't so ludicrous. If you're really desperate to see a movie this week, you'd be well advised to revisit your childhood and sit through \"The Sound of Music\". At least its good for a laugh. Indian music opens concerts The first concert of the year, an introduction to South Indian classical music, is being presented by the ASUS orien- tation committee and the Division of Concerts at 8:30 tomorrow evening in Dunning Auditorium. The roots of the music extend live thousand years or more into the past and is being performed by acclaimed masters of the ancient and unusual Indian in struments. Laxmi Ranganathan will play the veena, one of India's oldest string instruments. She will be accompanied by Trichy Sankaran who will play the mrudanagam, a percussion in- strument, and Lynn Dougan who plays the tambura, a stringed drone instrument. Both Ranganathan and Sankaran have won the highest awards in India for their artistry.

The Gaels lost the services of line-backers Lee Doney and John Waddell, both with stretched knee ligaments. Given the already-decimated state of the defensive corps, their loss can be ill-afforded. The game itself was dominated by turnovers, with the Gaels able to capitalize on no less lhan five fumble recoveries, while Loyola picked up three. Loyola owned the game statistically, with 392 total yards against a paltry 272 for the Gaels, but were unable to put points on the scoreboard. The Gaels opened the scoring at the 6:06 mark of the first quarter, when lunning back Gerry Blacker lugged the ball in from ten yards out for the first of his three touch- downs. The convert was blocked, and Queen's led, 6-0. The Warriors came back with a field goal by Mike Lapensee, before Blacker again scored, this time from three yards out, in the early stages of the second quarter. Another field goal by Lapensee made it 12-6 at the half. Loyola kicked off to start the second half, but neither team was able to push across a major in the third period. Lapensee kicked his third field goal to narrow the score to 12-9, after some fine running by Wade Claire, and Peter Fogl had moved the Warriors into scoring position. The Gaels, meanwhUe, were not exactly tearing up the field on offense. Things got rolling early in the fourth quarter when Tom Taylor hit one of his two com- pletions for the day, a 24-yardor toStu Lang for a quick six points. Still no convert, though. The Warriors got back in the game when Claire, who ended up with a total of 175'/2 yards on 18 carries, broke around the right side of a 65-yard TD. Lapensee's convert made it 18-16. The Gael^ got another single when an at- tempted field goal by Will Kennedy managed to stagger into the end zone, but Loyola was on the move. A fumbled punt gave the Warriors another chance, and they moved in to take the lead, 22- 19, as end Dave McMillan hauled in a TD pass. A bad pass from centre negated the convert try. The Gaels' offence pulled itself together with about three minutes to go, and, aided by a couple of timely penalties and some fine running by Hadden, Blacker and Company, moved in to score. Blacker collected his third TD of the game on a three yard toss, and, finally, the Gaels got a convert, as Kennedy split the uprights. With the score now 26-22 Queen's, the Warriors kept trying, but three deep in- completions gave Queen's the ball in the Loyola end with seconds to go. On the final play of the game, fullback Dave Hadden slashed up the middle for 19 yards and the TD. The final score was 32-22, in Queen's favour. Despite the statistical edge enjoyed by Loyola, the Gaels' defense did not play that badly. Several individuals had out- standing games, notably Darryl Penner, who made 16 unassisted tackles and helped out on ten more from his safety position. Doug Lowry played almost the full game at guard, and played well, while Andy Sakell, who has been having some problems adjusting to the defensive line, looked good in the second half. Ian Anderson, who plays the noseguard position in the five- man front, also had a strong game. The problems seem to be on offense, despite five TD's. The Gaels did not sustain their of- fensive marches well for most of the game, and Taylor looked very shaky indeed throwing the ball. H(! completed only two of ten pass attempts, although they were for scores. Dough Latham, the other QH to see action, looked quite sharp, hitting on four of seven throws, and generally surprising observers. With Taylor at camp school all this week, Latham could get some work next Saturday against Ottawa U, The offensive line play was spotty, but the return of Tom Dickenson will help, as will a full game with the same backfield (some of the problems were line play; some the backs can take the blame for;. Whjte»ide and company will have to txt tum- sistent next week, and they should ixi. Against Ottawa IJ,, the defenw; will \\h; teHted more stringently than on Saturday. Linebacker Norm Hagarty and DT Dave Devonshire are likely to tx; ready, but the absence of Waddell will hurt. However, the deep five will probably be intact for the first time this year Dave Campbell, Joe Pal, and Peter McNabb are all strong against the run as well as the pass. They may have to be.

The Gaels suffered heavily from- graduation losses after last season, and coupled to the in- juries, they now must face the season with little experienced depth at any position. Starting on defense, where the news is worst, Queen's has lost DE's Brett Biggs and Bill Thompson, linebackers Gord Squires and Bob Grimm, DT Don Smith and safety-place-kicker Doug Cozac. Add to this injuries to DT's Paul Hand, Mike O'Shaugnessy (knees) and Dave Devonshire (bone bruises), linebackers John Waddell, Lee Doney, and Norm Hagarty and deep backs Peter McNabb, Dave Campbell and Joe Pal, and you have a decimated defense. However, the wounded are starting to heal, so things should get better. Campbell will be ready Saturday, as will Hagarty and Devonshire. The others are a more long-term proposition, with O'Shaughnessy likely out for the season. There are some good hap- penings, though. Ian Anderson has had a fine training camp, and will be a sure starter at middle bews news Blowing lazily on notice boards around campus, the watchful eye may catch the flutter of Go Bews. What's a GO BEWS? Bews is the name of the Queen's University intramural programme, among the most extensive intramural programmes is Canada. Over 25 different sports are contested yearly by intramural teams in pursuit of the James G. Bews Trophy, named after the physical education director from 1919 till 1936. Bews groupings are one unit for each year of Commerce, Arts student and law students, one unit of Applied Science freshmen, and one unit per discipline grouping of Applied Science (eg. Mechanical). They are ac- companied by units from medicine, P.H.E., Education, and each of the graduate groupings. Arts, Business, Engineering and Chemistry. Each unit is headed and co- ordinated by a unit \"Athletic Stick.\" Those units who have not selected heads yet should do so as quickly as possible, especially freshmen years, and have them see Rob Beamish, this years' intramural co-ordinator (call 547- 5849) . In the event his absence for the duration of frosh week, due to teaching commitments, questions may be directed to Stu Beck till Monday, Sept. 17. The first intramural Athletic Com- mittee will be held Tuesday, Sept. 18 at 7 p.m. in Seminar room A in thePhys. Ed. centre. Sticks from each unit should attend. So that's a Go Bews, the chance for fun, activity, and another facet of a Queen'sman's varied life - so GO BEWS. Kinncar d'Esterre 7,^5 Would ^ou Relieve ^iamoiid You've found the right man.

ONTARIO guard in the five-man front Queen's will use, while John Tovee looks solid at linebacker. Chris Harber, picked up from Carleton, will play at an outside LB spot, and handle the punting as well, while McNabb comes from U. of T with all-star credentials. As a unit, the defense will be rather small, but they should be quick and pretty good against the pass. If they can play as a unit, the running game shouldn't be too disastrous. If they don't play together, it will be a long season. Offensively, things are brighter. Only Brian Warrender and Geoff Hamlin are gone from the backfield (Gord McLellan really wasn't there enough last year to be counted in this com- parison), while John Hollingsworth and Don Gordon have left the line. Here, we have replacements. Dave Hadden moves back to fullback, his natural berth, while Stu Lang, a three-year starter, will be a slotback; look for him to see the ball quite a bit. The running back will be Gerry Blacker who starred for Sir Wilfred Laurier University last season on the way to the College Bowl finals. He is a fine acquisition. The flanker will likely be Barry St. George, who brings a wealth of experience with him from Ottawa U., but Bruce Pollock, who taxied last year, and Will Kennedy both are in the running. Quarterback is the only unsettled position, and Taylor's performance against Loyola did little to solidify it. He is in a three- way fight with Doug Latham and John Wintermeyer for the starting job. Wintermeyer has been hampered by pulled muscles in his throwing arm since early training camp, and has had problems showing just what he can do. There may be changes here as the year goes on. Providing depth for the running backs are a host of taxi- squadders and rookies. Stacy Merritt and Jim McKeen have been promising rookie backs, while Tom Hamilton, a converted quarterback in his second year, has also looked good at times. Jim McMillan, another rookie, has also impressed a number of observers. The offensive line will be an imposing unit when healthy, but God help the injuries. Tackle to tackle, the starter will be Dave Whiteside, Keith Taggart, centre Peter Demontigny, another OU addition, Tom Dickinson and Bruce Potter. Rick Koski, who has improved under the tutelage of coach Bob Climie, Doug Lowry, and Larry DuChene appear to be the backup men, but Peter Sabiston, who checked into camp late, could also figure here. The ends are Alex Melvin who caught three TD passes last year (''4 of the team output) and Greg Anderson, a lanky type who played defense last season. Ben Labovitch, who can also play linebacker, could catch on as the backup here. There are a number of people around that haven't been men- tioned; several will make the team, at least for a while, and a couple could start when healthy. They haven't been forgotten, but I'm running out of spac«, and the situation should be clearer later in the week. Look in the Friday paper for an Ottawa U. preview. unclassifieds CARPOOL?

Tricolor delayed The Tricolor yearbook will be delivered after registration again this year. They were to have been in Kingston in time to hand out at registration. The delay, according to officials of National School Services in Winnipeg, the Tricolor printer, was due mainly to the rail strike, which had held up binding supplies in Thunder Bay. In addition, there was a delay because colour seperations had to be redone. No definite date has been given to the Tricolor staff as to when to expect the book, although it had been estimated that they would be delivered three weeks after the rail strike ended.- Bus-It project begins As a result of a referendum held last March, Queen's students may ride the PUC buses free of charge, during the academic year. The service is paid for by a three dollar levy per student and a two dollar a head contribution from the university. Bus-It passes are available at the AMS office in the basement of the Union and are valid for use until September 20. After that date, the new red student identification cards which will be issued at registration, must be presented to the bus driver. Rates on all premium bus routes will be available for free, while an additional 5 cents must be paid on routes outside normal zones and for Dial-a-bus service in the west end. Course guild available The 1973-1974 Course Evaluation Guide, a two volume effort this year, is available in the AMS office for those who did not receive their's in the mail. Ross Sutherland, co-ordinator of the guide, noted that in at least one way this year's effort is an improvement over last year's. For the first time, there are evaluations of first year courses. Sutherland was disappointed in the co-operation which came from students, the Departmental Student Councils and the professors, however. His pet beef was students who softened up while evaluating the professors and the courses. In addition,only about 30 per cent of the DSC's participated this year. Sutherland noted also that he was disappointed with the upper year professors whose response was less than satisfac- tory. In the English department, although the faculty were co- operative, the students weren't, he noted. He added that in the psychology department neither faculty nor students were co- operative. 16 committee vacancies Full time faculty members and students are invited to apply for, and-or to submit the names of those qualified for positions on the Senate Committees.

Ac- cording to Ellis, approximately 27Q0 applications for loans have been filed through the student awards office. The number of applications was the same at this time last year.- \"Perhaps the students do not understand the changes in the programme,\" Ellis said. He noted that the cut off date for applications is September 30. In a statement released last April, the Minister of Colleges and Universities Jack McNie said \"we are modifying the present Student Awards Programme to bring the needs assessment more into line with today's costs and to accommodate other con- siderations, and we want to do more to encourage academic achievement.\" He said the changes will help students presently in the system and encourage high-school students who are considering post-secondary education. McNie also said that talks leading to \"substantial improvements\" in the Canada Student Loan Plan were making considerable progress, but no action had yet been taken on conditional repayment of student loans, or aid for part-time students under the federal GSL programme. Changes Changes in the method of calculating OSAP grants include: Boosting the basic family allowance from $1800 to $4000 on OSAP parental contribution tables. The Ministry estimates this will make an additional $5 million in grants available to students from lower and middle income groups. Substantially increasing allowable deductions where both parents are working and in- cluding baby-sitting expenses in the deductions. Increasing by 10 per cent the weekly miscellaneous allowance. Modifying assessment procedures so that \"married students will benefit to the extent of a half a million dollars in grants.\" Encouraging academic excellence by increasing exemptions for academic awards to the level of tuition and in- cidental fees. (The previous limit was $150.) Ontario students who have worked for at least two full years and who wish to be financially independent of their parents can now apply for independent status under the Canada Student Loans Plan. The Ministry says that it is also undertaking a programme which will make bank loans more readily available to part-time students, and will encourage post-secondary institutions to allow part-time students to spread out tuition payments over the length of the course if the fee is over $50. The government will make accelerated payments to institutions to offset any internal cash flow problems this may cause. Ellis was concerned at the government's failure to take any action on the last of these proposals. The government has not \"moved at all in this direc- tion,\" he said. Permission has been given to universities to use normal operating funds to provide bursaries to graduate students in their third consecutive term, and the Ministry is formulating plans for a revised system of graduate assistance \"based on a high level of academic achievement.\" For example The effect of the changes is shown in the following examples supplied by McNie 's office: A single student with one parent making $9000 and a second child not attending university ; in 1972-3, the expected parental contribution was $663. In that case, a student would have received $640 in assistance in the form of a loan. Under the new scheme, the parental con- tribution is $495. The student would receive $990 in assistance ~ $800 in loans, and $190 in grant. For a married student with the husband earning $1800 and the wife earning $5000 with one child under 12, last year, the expected contribution was $1430, which would have netted the student $690 worth of assistance in the form of a loan. Under the 1973-4 regulations, the expected contribution is $60. In this case, the student would receive $1910 worth of assistance - $800 in loan and $1110 in grant. Operating grants In addition to the increased student support, the government is increasing operating grants to universities and colleges by $48.5 million. Most of the increase will go to raising the Basic Income Unit ~ the funding per student which universities receive from the government. Other parts of the increase will include added weight to part- time programmes for grant purposes, and more support for bilingual programmes. The bilingual grants, which go to Ottawa U, Glendon College, Laurentian, Algonquin College and Sudbury are now to be calculated at 5 per cent of the Basic Operating Income. Schools of social work in Universities will receive supplementary grants to finance field instruction that at one time was supported by federal grants. The government is also supplying \"extra-formula grants\" for undergraduate programmes in law and medicine at nine universities. Queen's will receive such grants for its law programmes. Smaller universities, mainly Brock and Trent ~ both of which have had severe financial dif- ficulties this year - will receive added assistance \"in the form of fixed sum compensatory grants based on a careful assessment of their needs.\" McNie said of the increased amounts being spent on colleges and universities that \"the financial commitment shows that post-secondary education remains very high on the Government's list of priorities.\" During the fee withholding campaigns across the province, students had accused the Davis government of being un- concerned with post-secondary education and cutting back ex- penditures on it as a scapegoat for its financial difficulties. Ma Bell prefers students The results of an experiment conducted Wednesday afternoon seem to indicate that students can have their phone installed at least two days earlier than 'on is at Agnes Etherington Art Centre Do not fail to see this major exhibition opened by the Secretary of State on June 3 and continuing to October 28 Note new GALLERY HOURS: Monday to Friday 9 to 5; Saturday and Sunday 1 to 5; Tuesday & Thursday evenings 7 to 9 professors. Bell Canada's business office was called by a \"professor\" living at 263 University, and was told that the earliest that a phone could be installed would be on Monday. However, with a little urging the installation date was moved up to Saturday, a three day wait. When a \"first year student\" living at 158 Johnson called, Mother Bell informed him that he could have his phone installed on the next day, on Thursday. A spokesman for Bell Canada told the Journal that \"We try to install the phones as soon as possible\", and that Wednesday (the day of the experiment) and Friday were fully booked. Bell suggested that the discrepancy was due to the callers dealing with different employees. I Page 4 comment The upper year dislocation syndrome by Victoria Kt'insley I am totally discouraged and bored. I have a nagging suspicion that the whole country has been invited to a terrific party and someone forgot to mail my in- vitation. My emotions are fluc- tuating on a continuum between \"home at last\" and \"gawd, am I really going to go through it all again?\" Having returned to Kingston a week early, I looked forward to a weeks' holiday before starting back to the books in a reasonable facsimile of earnestness. But all the activities that I had looked forward to are not to be found. Even the Gibralter of our university, the pub, can't be cruised into. Is it my imagination or are there really even fewer fresh activities to crash this year. Second Coming came and went. Not that I blame anyone for that. Last year's response was far from enthusiastic, and anyway if I'd wanted a second or third or fourth coming I should have organized it myself. Never- theless, I feel somewhat like a fish in a bowl looking out at the \"heyday' of the real world. Many of the 'normal people' (as one gael called us) feel the same way. There is a sympathy for one another that creates a lackadaisical club. At this stage of the game there aren't as many \"how was your summer? '\"s and few faces ignite shouts of glee. They seemed to have all turned to greener fields or gone out to the big bad world. Consequently the union steps people watching, isn't quite the same. I know that there are things going on and I know that there is excitement and laughter and nervousness and new clothes and new faces and the first toke for someone, but I'm dislocated and they won't let me play without a red button. It's an amazing feeling to be so dispassionate toward the whole thing. The days are lazy and I'm getting lots of sleep. While the soties of people who claim they haven't slept for seventy two hours are back again, the fat cats like me don't really believe them this time. \"The cliches of years gone by are here again. And of course the usual comments about the cliches are again in themselves cliches. And everyone that is directly involved feels like its a whole new thing happening here. Arm- banders and assistants keep coming up with bright new ideas that will really make this orientation week something different. But they don't know that those are the same unique ideas someone came up with last year. Hurrah for tradition, hurrah for the status quo, hurrah for the normality of the confusion. Again the frosh are wandering around lost, as if they aren't. And Arm- banders are watching over them condescendingly, knowing they are. And someone is making nasty comments about engineering frosh and someone else is making nasty comments about the engineering orientation program and yet another is defending it in the name of creating a spirit of brotherhood within the frosh. And gaels are walking purposefully with their file folders. And someone has taken off with the keys to the orientation truck. And the chauvinists are comparing this year's \"crop\" to years gone by. And the non-involvees are making cynical comments about the whole damn thing.

The concessions offered to these foreign students is the result of pressure by individual campus representatives on the federal government. But these concessions will apply only until these students have successfully completed the academic course in which they are registered and will not apply to more recently immigrated students or to those illegally in the country before the cut-off date. A federal government pamphlet says foreign students must give \"evidence of sufficient funds for full maintenance and tuition. Some Canadian students finance their studies by working part-time and during their vacations. Foreign students, however, must not anticipate financing their studies in this manner.\" Saskatchewan students urge fee strike Saskatoon (CUP) — Student councils of the two campuses of the University of Saskatchewan are mounting a campaign urging students to withhold their second term tuition fees. They are protesting a $50 fee hike instituted this year by the provincial government. The Saskatchewan fee strike is patterned after that organized last year by the Ontario Federation of Students. The Ontario fee strife was in protest of the lack of government response to student views when they unilaterally increased tuition fees by $100 and loan ceilings by $200 in 1972. The Saskatchewan students are being asked to pay only half of their full tuition fee so that the student councils may be provided with time and bargaining power in trying to get the fee rise rescinded. The councils also hope to deter a further increase expected for the next school year. In addition, the student council at the Saskatoon campus is requesting that students who receive government student loans put the unused portion of their loans into a trust fund, claiming that this would satisfy the requirements of the Canada Student Loan Plan. bottomley Journal photog in action While on assignment, our erstwhile photographer .lim Merrithew got caught up in the action of Shinerama, one of the events of Charity Day held Wednesday to help sponsor Camp Outlook.

Please submit a written resume of past experience and extra curricular activities to the AM S office by 5 p.m., Monday, September 17. Applications are also being received for the following positions Assistant managers Bartenders Cashiers Waiters/Waitresses Written resumes for the above positions should be submitted to the AMS office by 5 p.m., Monday, September 17. THE PUB WILL REMAIN CLOSED UNTIL ALL THE ABOVE POSITIONS ARE FILLED International Centre helps them adjust For the foreign students coming onto campus this week the confusion inherent in Orientation Week is complicated by their unique problems of basic differences in language and culture. To assist the foreign students in coping with their new en- vironment, the International Centre has an extensive programme which attempts to overcome some of the initial misunderstandings and to channel the students into the com- munity. The programme starts early in the summer and is under the guidance of Kasper Pold, Executive Secretary of the International Centre. According to Pold, the Orientation programme has been evolving rapidly over the past five years and has become most effective in meeting the needs of the students. Last year there were about 800 foreign students at Queen's (not including Americans) representing thirty-five nationalities, with 70 new arrivals. This year there were close to 100 new arrivals, still many less than several years ago. In June the Centre receives notices of all foreign students accepted for the following session and detailed information regarding travelling from their home base to Queen's is sent and any special problems are discussed and followed up as closely as possible at that time. By the end of August Pold and his staff (one over-worked secretary) recruit volunteers to aid the new students in areas of general personal services such as housing, everyday living. The students acquire interim \"families\" in Kingston amongst Rotarians, faculty members, grad students and Kingston families. During the first week of September Pold supervises a busy Orientation schedule for graduate and undergraduate students alike. \"This is an attempt to combine more formalized sessions with more geographic coverage.\" There are formalized presentations, then travelling groups and at all times students are encouraged to come together at the Centre and initiate projects of their own. Pold rejected the suggestion that this type of itinerary tends to isolate students and perhaps defeat the purpose of foreign exchange. \"It doesn't build the sohdarity which might be ex- pected. There are about 35 nationalities involved, and naturally there striking differences inherent in the group.\" Often these differences reflect the political situation in existence at the time or an extremely different cultural background. Kasper Pold has been aiding students with general, social, personal, bureaucratic and academic problems and sees himself in the role of organizer, red-tape cutter and om- budsman. \"There people don't want to be patronized\" em- phasized Pold, however, he pointed out that the academic departments have no formal organization for helping in- ternational students. \"There needs to be some mechanism by which a supervisor tries to ascertain what kind of problems or state of mind the student is in\" explained Pold. He went on to criticize the undergraduate Orientation pointing out that it can have an extremely devastating effect on a person not prepared to cope with the Canadian culture in such a distorted setting.

More than half of the waiting frosh were turned away with no alternative event to attend. Most of the seven hundred who were admitted faced a snail-paced lineup which extended from the basement of Grant almost to the entrance door. More liquor tickets were sold than could be honoured, and in several cases, no refund was given to those stillholding tickets when the liquor supply ran out. And there were other problems. Although the bar and movies were ready at the scheduled opening time, the doors remained closed for nearly an hour while arrangements for crowd control were completed. No announcement that all fro.sh must wear their buttons for admittance was made until minutes before the doors opened and more than one frosh who had tw-en waiting for nearly two hours was turned away because of this .slip-up.

ONTARIO Brewed fidm puiB spfli^ water: And that's the tmhf The Queen's Journal, Friday, September 14, 1973 Page 7 editorial Criticisms: wise and otherwise The Journal has certain obvious responsibilities to the university community. Queen's University represents a very diversified population. As such, the interests and opinions of its members are varied. Difficult as it is to please all of the people all of the time, the Journal should appeal to as wide a readership as possible. It is important that news coverage be accurate, objective, and complete. Although news articles cannot avoid reflecting a certain amount of the reporter's biases, the place for an opinion, subtle or otherwise, is on the editorial page. It is the intention of the editors to pursue an active editorial policy. We do not expect to voice the opinion of everyone in the university - nor should we be e expected to. It is our hope that our editorials will spark thought, discussion, and action. Although a university newspaper cannot ignore the activities of its student pohticians, a constant stream of mindless campus politics can become tedious and of little interest to the majority of the student and faculty. The editor of a student newspaper must of course, be watchful of the student political element. However, it is not our policy nor our intention to either consistently oppose nor support our government. Our politicians will be praised and often crtiticized, according to our judgment of their actions. It is our opinion that unsubstantiated criticism and unvoiced opinion are of the same vintage, and symptomatic of the same ill. The only valid type of criticism is that which is constructive; the only valid type of opinion is that which is expressed. Quite often student papers fail because politicians run the paper and fail to reach their audience and be responsive to the readership. We hope to produce a paper which is not only well-balanced, informative, and readable, but also, one which is lively, en- tertaining, and dynamic. Accordingly, we feel that humorous, anecdotal columns and comments have a rightful place in the students' newspaper. Formerly, the classifieds became a light spot in what had become a dry, sober and conservative news sheet. No matter how well written, no one will read the Journal if its pages are not at- tractive. Through careful layout and the proper use of photography, a sense of con- tinuity can be achieved. Photos and artwork draw the reader into the paper. There is much of interest in the academic realm that has remained untouched by previous Journals. The interpretations of the meaning of 'education' are as varied as are the educational possibilities open to members of the Queen's community. The Entertainment section of the Journal and its sports pages have been consistently strong in previous years. The tradition is one to be passed on. In addition it is planned that Features will be expanded to include human interest stories, and perhaps to include an explanation of why the last issue did not live up to our goals and expectations. So you wanna work for the Journal So you want to be an editor... so you had ideas before you came to college of being a foreign correspondent... so you practice on the Jounral...and get to be editor... every Wednesday and Sunday it's press night... every Thursday and Monday there's the printer's call... and on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday you relax. ..yea? you don't... you worry. ..about what you're going to use on the other days... and about the copy somebody threw out. ..and the people who don't like the who do you sup- pose...and the people who don't hke anything but the who do you suppose. ..and those that think the Lower Campus is funny. ..and those that think that it stinks... and of course the people that don't like the Jounral...and everybody can do a better job than you. ..but they don't. ..they just com- plain...complain. ..complain. ..that's all you hear down here... crabbing and griping... about the communists... or the fascists. ..or the good coach. ..or the lousy coach. ..or the players on our teams. ..or the players who should be on our teams. ..or smoking in the classrooms... or not smoking... or swearing... or drinking. ..or the women at Queen's. ..or the men at Queen's. ..or the professors... or the courses... or humans in general... and you get the worries of the atomic bomb... and the SKAD and the IRA and OFS... and the ASUS.. .CUP...

Page B Orientations of the past: not just tarns and oil thighs Orientation 1973: If you're a fresh, you've been doing it for the last week : Gael groups, early morning wake-ups, parties, course counselling, and all the rest of it. You have been given the opportunity to get to know the campus and a few of the people, to \"get involved\" and to prepare for the academic year. \"A judicious mixture of all such activities is probably the best prescription for the continued health and well- being of the college student. The acquisition of knowledge - not only of books, but of life and character - is the fun- damental task of the year ahead, and Orientation Week points out this fact to the Freshman.\" The above quote, however familiar it may seem to a frosh of 1973, is an excerpt from a Journal editorial of October 1935. Yes, orientation, like the rest of Queen's life, has been going on for a long time. Over a span of seventy years, the first-year students have arrived early each fall, to be greeted by what has been known as orientation, hazing, initiation, or simply Hell Week. Through the years while undergoing great changes in form and character, Orientation Week has maintained certain aspects which closely link the experiences of the Class of '77 with those of the Class of '07. For example, the new student faces numerous welcoming speeches. Unitl fairly recently, the official welcome to the university was the Principal's; he would explain the goals of the entering freshman as he perceived them, and assured the students that they could count on the support of the professors and upperclass students in the years ahead. Principal W. H. Fyfe added in his speech of October 1935, \"I hope that you will preserve all that is sound in the traditions which have been built up since our royal charter was received in 1841, and that by your energy and intelligence you will add to the fame of Queen's.\" Not all welcomes to the frosh, however, were filled with promise and cliched optimism. The Queen's Journal editorial of October 3, 1930 took a less complimentary view of the newcomers of 1930: \" \"With varying emotion we inspect the Freshman Class as it hurries, furtive-eyed, about the campus. Sometimes it seems to have a scrubby look. The freshmen aren't nearly men. They are narrow-shouldered boys, with dirty collars, disgraceful shoes, and a general hang- dog appearance. At these times we feel sorry for the Old University and for the Alma Mater Society which must in the next three years degenerate into these incapable hands. We advise initiation schemes to put them in their place, and prove our own superior intellect and brawn by making them suffer ordeals of every sort, that they might better realize their inferiority and the humbleness of the position they occupy in our community.\" Nature of orientation questioned The terms \"initiation schemes\" and \"suffering or- deals\" which the Editor used forty-three years ago suggest the whole subject of the nature of Orientation, which has been a controversial one ever since. Should Orientation mean scavenger hunts, tams, purple dye and taking orders from upperclass students? Would an academically-minded week be more appropriate? These questions have occupied Orientation committees as long as they have existed. The trend up to now has been one of gradual moderation. Picture the scene on October 4, 1929 : \"With palpitating hearts and trembling knees, about four hundred freshmen gathered in Grant Hall ... to hear the pronouncement by their superiors, the lordly sophs, juniors and seniors . . . The outcome was simply this, that all general freshmen regulations go into force immediately ...\" What were these regulations? 1. Each freshman had to buy a tam, which was to be worn from the date of the meeting until the end of the freshman year. From the date of \"initiation\" until the first of January, they were to be worn twenty-four hours a day, every day except Sunday, and \"on any such days when not in the city of Kingston.\" After January 1st, the tams were to be worn from 7 am to 7 pm, except on Sundays. Medicine had a blue tassel, Science a yellow tassel, and Arts a red tassel. 2. Each frosh had to buy a faculty ribboi specified that \"these ribbons shall be worn on tbi man's apparel in a conspicuous place, so thatj easily be seen by the rest of the student body.\" f and shape of the ribbon were also quoted, and thej had to be worn until January 1st, twenty -four houM 3. Every freshman had to carry a Faculty-** umbrella with him for one week. It was to be opal full view while walking from building to buildii^ 4. Freshmen were not permitted to cut \"trespass over lawns,\" or walk on the sidewalk d first week of initiation. This rule, however, was forced on rainy days, when frosh were allowed to; sidewalks - as long as they walked in single file an interfere with the progress of upperclass studei 5. The non-fussing rule, as stated by Des Acting President of the A.M.S.: \"No freshman s| permitted to fuss, i.e. to be in company with a girl ^ or from shows, attending shows, attending dances al An unbiased examination of the freshnnen Every year sees a different lot of queerly assorted dregs of humanity in the gui,se of fresh- mon of the common beer garden variety let loose on this verable old college which apparently has no adequate defence against such ;jn invasion. Just whore all these (rosh come from is one of life's little mysteries that has puzzled • he great thinkers of all ages. SiAxxiy asks them to come, nolx)dy welcomes them, and yet here they are, as proud as punch ihat they are .so far away from home and mother's eagle eye. 'I'his state of affairs continues for ■■iix)\\i\\ a week but aftf;r the novelty of f:omplele freedom begins to get ;i little .shiny in the seat of the pants, it iH a somewhat different story. It is at thi.s period of the garne that they bfrgin to get a littUr homesick and then the ' JirnpuK is Ktuddcd with p<Hential ',uicide«. Freshmen make a very in- lerewtlng study SiipfMjse you were to single out one from the herd and examine him with an impartial eye. Somehow, he doesn't look so bad - quite har- mless in fact. His face may be a little sticky from the all-day sucker he has been working on, his clothes may look as if they came from the fifteen-dollar store and his general appearance may resemble a farm-hand on his day off but taken all in all he doesn't look like anything worth writing a letter of complaint about to the Whig-Standard. Mass all the freshmen together and that's a different story. Every last mother's son of them now looks like the outcasts of the underworld with visages which resemble nothing human, Ninety- ninf! and forty four one hundredths p<!r cent of them have criminal laces of (h(! low(!r type and it is scarc«!ly any wond(.'r that the mothers of Kingston punish erring children by threatcsning to take them out to look at thf- fresh- men. Even among morons such as the frosh most undoubtedly are, there are class distinctions. There is the negative group that are so negative that they are almost positive and on the other Kngineering frosh parade with .Science '(il banner. (Tricolor, l!t5H) hand there is the positive group that is so positive that it is almost negative. One type which is bound to delight the sophistcated eyes of the sophs is the frosh that assumes a cocky \"my feet don't smell\" attitude, and has an ex- tensive wisecracking vocabulary that ranges anywhere from \"so's your old man\" to \"oh yeah?\" This is the very same freshman that will be on the make for the waitresses at the \"Sup\" for the next two weeks. The nattily dressed frosh with the plus-fours and bow-tie purchases from Eaton's catalogue is also a good prospect for the seniors who are on the lookout for fun and games. Taking frosh down a peg cer- tainly ranks with the sports of kings. Perhaps the creme de la creme of the freshman crop, though, is the dumb frosh. \"Show me a dumb frosh and I'll show you a good time.\" Another great mystery surrounding freshman is to where they all disappear? Of course we understand that a large number are murdered in cold blood by their bored seniors, and a great many graduate at Christmas, to say nothing of the share that fade to the garbage- men, but the question is where do the majority go. Naturally many return the next year but somehow they don't seem to be the same people. They don't look so criminal and half-witted and yet how could such a change be ef- fected in one year? Truly college is a great melting-pot. As I look over this year's batch I feel more pessimistic than usual because between you and me and the Union I've never seen a more dilapidated, forlorn group of human derelicts, the sweepings of the street as it were, that have been wished on us this year. It's enough to make a self- respecting student turn over in his bed. -Journal.

Freshmen shall be permitted to escort members of the opposite sex from Church receptions, but not to the reception.\" 6. Freshmen were not allowed to hold any \"theatre parties, sleighing or driving parties, or get-together parties or dances of any kind . . . until after the Christ- mas examinations.\" 7. Freshmen were expected to attend all in- tercollegiate Rugby and Hockey games. 8. No freshman was permitted to grow a moustache during his first year. 9. Freshmen were not allowed to wear \"derby, spats, bow ties, plus-fours, or use a cane.\" In the face of such a strict set of Orientation regulations, change was inevitable, and followed soon after. In an A.M.S. ruling in April, 1935, the non-fussing rule was deleted from the Constitution. Under the headline \"Women Now The Only Danger That Faces Fussing Freshmen,\" the Journal commented: \"The tendency lately has been to remove many of the spiteful restrictions on first-year students and to retain only those clauses serving some definite purpose.\" The problem which existed then, just as it does now, was deciding which aspects of Orientation served a \"definite purpose\" and which did not. It was termed a \"somewhat radical change\" when the freshettes of 1932 were permitted to wear tams instead of \"bibs, aprons adorned with ribald remarks, or bowler hats which tend to mar the appearance of even the most beautiful.\" (Journal, October 4, 1932) The freshettes were given red, yellow, or blue tams and had to wear them until four- thirty on week days throughout the year. In previous years freshettes had \"undergone the public humility of berry-boxes, aprons, green socks and straw hats. No longer would the freshettes submit to the indignities . . . which other years suffered,\" it was concluded. Not so, however, judging by the Freshette Restric- tions of the following year's Orientation. The freshettes were required to wait on the Seniors and open doors for them. For two weeks their \"personal beauty was enhanced by large five by eight-mch cards bearing their names in two-inch block capitals and their respective weights in one-inch lettering . . . Freshies must be meek and humble in bearing or risk the descent of the wrath of the gods above upon their unwitting heads. Their tams must blossom unendingly on the Campus throughout the year. Their hour will come; then the hours thus spent in acquiring merit will stand them in good stead.\" . Even as late as 1940, the engineering orientation programme, traditionally the one with the severest hazing, retained its old character. Freshmen were forced to have a military haircut: \"shaved clean IV2 inches above top of ears and % inch to be the maximum length on top of head.\" The old non-fussing rule was still in effect. Curfew was strictly set at 10 pm. Furthermore, there were several minor regulations; for example, if a frosh met an upperclassman on a sidewalk, he was to step aside (\"not on the grass,\" it was specified) and let the upperclassman pass. Another rule decreed that if \"caught\" in a pub, freshmen must buy one quart of beer for each up- perclassman present. Among the eighteen rules of conduct for the J940 Applied Science frosh were seven which were to be ob- served for two weeks. Among them: trouser legs were to be rolled up to just under the knee and odd socks were to be worn; when turning corners, a freshman was to signal his turn by holding out his arm and honking (automobile- style) ; and before entering any Science building, all frosh had to bow from the waist to a horizontal position and yell \"Praise Queen's.\" The hazing programme went on through the war years ; but in 1945, due to the overwhelming influx of ex- servicemen and other students, all frosh regulations were suspended and first-year students were merely \"en- couraged\" to wear their tams and ribbons. Value of hazing debated By the fifties, however, the attitude was changing toward the more severe aspects of hazing. On September 27, 1955, the Journal titled its summary of Frosh Week, \"Hell of it all in Hell Week;\" the latter had become an increasingly popular term. It was noted that frosh pins and V4 inch haircuts were the rule until the November exams. One particularly indignant member of Arts '55 complained, \"The impression with which the sophomores load the freshman is that life at Queen's is a continual round of pleasure where the idea is to burst in, get a degree and burst out . . . Any idea of the dignity and privilege attached to learning is quickly squelched by such nonsense as pant-rolling and differently coloured socks. At a time when the whole structure of the civil"
