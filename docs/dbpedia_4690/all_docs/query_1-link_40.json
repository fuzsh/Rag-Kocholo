        "text": "Purpose: Initiative Grants are designed to enable small groups of Christian scholars to network in ways that will lead to collaborative scholarship on themes of interest and significance to the larger academy. Approved projects will create and disseminate scholarly work in high quality academic venues, thereby bringing Christian voices into contemporary academic conversations beyond the Christian academy. Initiative grants are intended to harness and demonstrate the power of networked, collaborative scholarship.\n\nEligible topics: Initiative Grants are intended to bring Christian voices into contemporary academic conversations and to make an important contribution beyond the Christian academy and other Christian audiences. Therefore, projects targeted to Christian audiences, such as research or the dissemination of materials that are primarily focused on CCCU institutions or churches, are not eligible for awards.\n\nAlthough all scholarship that seeks to illuminate some aspect of God’s creation may be viewed as Christian scholarship, broadly conceived, preference will be given in this program to supporting research that is significantly informed by Christian practices, perspectives, and purposes. The application should avoid superficial approaches to Christian scholarship and should demonstrate deep reflection on the ways the Christian faith addresses issues of concern to the larger academy.\n\nAny topic is appropriate, but applications must clearly articulate the ways in which both the research and the scholarly products draw on the riches of the Christian tradition and are themselves exemplary of Christian thought and life. Scholarly products, such as books, articles, art exhibitions, concerts, and the like need not use explicit Christian language to be significantly informed by Christian practices, perspectives, and purposes. Nor need they address overtly religious topics. But the grant application itself must clearly articulate the ways in which the proposed scholarly program is faithfully Christian.\n\nPossible Research Group Activities:\n\nThe Networking Grant Program does not prescribe any specific activities for research teams. Such activities should be proposed by each team solely on the basis of what will best facilitate the team’s research goals. However, preference will generally be given to proposals for which the requested funding will support a series of networking activities over the term of the grant, rather than supporting one meeting or conference. For illustration only, proposed activities may include one or more of the following:\n\nAn annual or semiannual meeting of the team in which members can discuss initial drafts of papers;\n\nA more formal topic research symposium, where the team invites other scholars to consider the current state of scholarship relative to the theme;\n\nA panel of presenters at an annual meeting of an academic proportion;\n\nA pilot study, which may lead to publication and plans for a more ambitious collaborative project;\n\nA public conference (partially funded by the grant), to which the team could invite other scholars having in interest in the theme. This may lead to an edited volume of essays or a dedicated issue of a journal;\n\nThe proposed budget should include line items for each proposed activity.\n\nPersonnel requirements: The research team should normally be composed of three to six members from various institutions. The project director for each Networking team must be a full-time faculty member at an institution that is a governing or collaborative member of the CCCU.\n\nAt least one other team member must hold a faculty position at either another CCCU member institution or a CCCU affiliate institution. Other Christian scholars comprising the team may have any academic affiliation or may be independent scholars. The team is encouraged to seek ways in which outstanding students may be included in the research activities.\n\nProject period: 3 years (36 months)\n\nEstimated award size: up to $30,000\n\nEstimated number of awards: up to two annually\n\nDue date & submission: All application documents and reference letters must be submitted online using the forms provided by 11:59 PM EST on June 7, 2024.\n\nPlanning Grants\n\nThe Missionary Database and Map Initiative: A Collaborative Digital Humanities Project\n\nProject Director:\n\nDr. Thomas Whittaker\n\nAssistant Professor of History\n\nLeTourneau University\n\nTeam Members:\n\nDr. Matthew Preston\n\nChair and Assistant Professor of Computer Science\n\nAnderson University\n\nDr. Alex Mayfield\n\nAssistant Professor of History\n\nAsbury University\n\nMr. Joseph Wang\n\nM.S. Student in Computer Science\n\nUniversity of Southern California\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Missionary Database and Map Initiative (MDMI) seeks to construct a database and interactive map visualization of Christian missions. Using Native American missions from all Christian denominations in the 50-year period from 1787 (the creation of the first post-revolutionary American missionary society) to 1838 (the Cherokee Trail of Tears) as its test case, the project will create a platform that could be expanded to encompass a much broader array of missionary data. By allowing for quantitative analysis and visualization of denominations, ethnic groups, biographical data, and missionary funding, the MDMI will offer a powerful tool that will enrich the research of historians, theologians, missiologists, and social scientists, while also offering a resource for Christians (including indigenous Christians), churches, and mission societies to understand their heritage. Through a CCCU Initiative Grant, a group of cross-disciplinary scholars in mission history and computer science from LeTourneau University, Anderson University, and Asbury University, will work collaboratively to develop the parameters of the prototype database and map, gather data from primary and secondary sources, prepare for additional funding opportunities, and form partnerships with potential sponsor organizations, at the same time engaging students on these campuses to grow spiritually and intellectually by engaging with the history of missions.\n\nDeception, Occultism and Cultism in the Body of Christ: Towards Understanding of False Doctrine of Death\n\nProject Director:\n\nDr. Laban Ayiro\n\nVice Chancellor\n\nDaystar University\n\nTeam Members:\n\nProf. Egara Kabaji\n\nProfessor of Literary Communication\n\nDaystar University\n\nDr. Caroline Ayuya\n\nSenior Lecturer, Clinical Psychology\n\nDr. Martin Munyao\n\nSenior Lecturer, Theology\n\nDaystar University\n\nDr. Niceta Ireri\n\nSenior Lecturer\n\nAfrica International University\n\nMr. Charles Mr. Charles\n\nAccountant\n\nDaystar University\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis research project aims at directing enquiry into the deception, occultism and cultism witnessed in Kenya in recent years resulting into death of hundreds of people deceived to starve to death in order to see Jesus Christ. The most horrific of these cases is now what is termed as Shakahola horror where a religious leader led his followers from all over the country to a remote part of the Kenyan coast and hypnotized them to starve to death. Hundreds of bodies of adherents have been exhumed from the eight hundred acre farm from where the evils took place. So far, the official records show that two hundred and fifty one bodies have been exhumed! This is just one of the horrific cultic and occultist events witnessed in recent years and there are many. This research will collect narratives from survivors of various cult activities, religious leaders, scholars, opinion leaders, survivors of the various cult activities and interrogate them to reveal the strategies of deception and the general occultism and occult practices. This approach to research in this issue in which real witnesses tell their stories is rare to come by. We will further direct enquiry in the practice of magic and witchcraft within thebody of Christ while focusing on manipulation of prayer and faith. In essence, we will seek to reveal characteristics of cults, types of cults, the underworld of cultism, cult practices, cult totems, cult membership, secrets of cults, tactics of deception, manipulative process of reading and misreading of scriptures in Kenya.\n\nChaplains and Spiritual Care in Community-Based Social Services\n\nProject Director:\n\nDr. Ryan Gladwin\n\nAssociate Professor of Theology and Ministry; Director of Community Transformation Center\n\nPalm Beach Atlantic University\n\nTeam Members:\n\nDr. Stephanie Boddie\n\nAssociate Professor of Church and Community Ministries\n\nBaylor University\n\nDr. Gaynor Yancey\n\nProfessor, Lake Family Endowed Chair in Congregational and Community Health; Director of the Center for Church and Community Impact\n\nBaylor University\n\nMrs. Emma Feyas\n\nAssociate Director of Community Transformation and Chaplaincy\n\nPalm Beach Atlantic University\n\nMr. Jeremy Morse\n\nAssociate Director of Recruitment and Development, Community Transformation Center\n\nPalm Beach Atlantic University\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis project brings together an interdisciplinary team in theology, chaplaincy, and social work from Palm Beach Atlantic University’s School of Ministry and the Community Transformation Center and Baylor University’s Diana R. Garland School of Social Work, the George W. Truett Theological Seminary, and the Center for Church and Community Impact. The project seeks to explore the potential benefits of providing spiritual care alongside community-based social services in partnership with Community Partners of South Florida (CPSFL). First, the project examines how social service organizations are well-positioned to address the growing mental health crisis but under-prepared to offer spiritual care and support. Second, examining research on spiritual caregiving, the project incorporates chaplain interns into the agency setting as uniquely primed to fill this service gap. Third, the project will engage in a qualitative research case study to understand (1) the need for spiritual care in a community-based social service organization Community Partners of South Florida, and (2) to demonstrate if chaplains can provide this care, improve organizational functions, and provide a benefit to service providers and the recipients of their services. Fourth, the project serves as a pilot study and justification for a more extensive project funded by the CCCU.The project will develop a qualitative case study focused on the following research question: To what extent could a chaplain or spiritual care provider be an integral part of a clinical care model for helping social service providers and service recipients? The study will use a triangulation assessment approach including participant observation, interviews with service providers and service recipients,and historical and sociological analysis of this agency and the surrounding community. The study will also offer a practical theological and social care assessment of the material in conversation with the growing field of study on chaplaincy and spiritual care.This project aims to demonstrate the need for chaplains in community-based social service settings. The project intends to make an academic contribution (e.g., a conference presentation and/or a journal article) and fill a gap in this research area. This project ultimately intends to serve as a pilot study to justify a larger CCCU grant to develop a more extensive project focused on case studies at various community-based social service settings in the tri-county region of Southeast Florida (Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties). Ultimately, this research will result in the development of a community-based chaplaincy model implemented in social service settings.\n\nInitiative Grants\n\nThe Interplay Between Christianity, News, and Sports\n\nProject Director:\n\nDr. Timothy Macafee\n\nChair, Associate Professor\n\nConcordia University Wisconsin\n\nTeam Members:\n\nDr. Mike Mirer\n\nVisiting Assistant Professor\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee\n\nDr. Steven Montreal\n\nProfessor\n\nConcordia University Wisconsin\n\nDr. Scott Chappuis\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nConcordia University Ann Arbor\n\nAbstract:\n\nIn Kennedy v. Bremerton Schools (2022), the United States Supreme Court used the case of a junior varsity football coach and his post-game prayer sessions to rewrite the rules of engagement between people of faith and public institutions. That sports figured heavily in the story is vitally important. Similarities between sports and religion have long been asserted (Bain-Selbo et al., 2015), with some claiming they are part of what Robert Bellah described as “America’s Civil Religion.” And yet, the playing field also is the site of open religious expression, be it on-field prayer, expressions of faith in media interviews or the use of sports by religious institutions to share their own views of doctrine. While Kennedy’s prayer circles acquired an openly political valence, a fall weekend full of “Hail Mary”passes and “miracle finishes” infuses faith (and usually Christian faith) into public discourse through mainstream television. Yet this is happening at a time where religious identification is declining and fewer Americans identify as Christian (Pew, 2019). This set of opposing trend lines set the context for this proposed study. This three-step research proposal seeks to explore how the expressions of the connections between faith and sport manifest in the sporting press and in other media formats and how those messages shape attitudes toward the athletes who express those ideas, the media outlets who amplify them, and perceptions of religious and religious values themselves. In step one, we will use qualitative methods to explore how mainstream sports media tell stories about athletes of faith and their use of religious language. The findings of step one will be used to inform experimental research. In step two, we will use differences in news framing to see how different frames affect how the public understands religious institutions, athletes of faith, and the media products that carry these messages. In step three, we will test different expressions of faith by athletes, using social media and other mediated formats to explore the same outcome variables as step two. The goal here will be to provide a more nuanced understanding of how a secularizing public processes the messages of faith they encounter in a sporting context.\n\nThe Nature of Spiritual Ties to Place\n\nProject Director:\n\nDr. Victor Counted\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nRegent University\n\nTeam Members:\n\nDr. Benjamin Meagher\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nHope College\n\nDr. Richard Cowden\n\nResearch Associate\n\nHarvard University\n\nDr. Jamie Aten\n\nBlanchard Chair of Humanitarian & Disaster Leadership\n\nWheaton College\n\nAbstract:\n\nDespite its presumed ethereal nature, human spirituality has long been closely tied to physical places, a concept that finds resonance in both the Old and New Testaments. The importance of places such as Mount Sinai, Jerusalem, and Galilee underscores the role of ‘place’ as an interconnected context – physical, social, cultural, ecological, personal, and spiritual – that profoundly shapes the opportunities (e.g., personal, professional & financial, social & community), resources (e.g., psychological, economic, interpersonal, physical), and experiences (e.g., thoughts, emotions, and behaviors) that contribute to holistic growth, relationships, and flourishing. Christian theology presents a nuanced understanding of place, intertwining these views with an attachment to Jesus that transcends any particular geographical location. Even so, Christians still have profound ties to particular sacred spaces (as do adherents of many other religious and spiritual traditions), as demonstrated by the emotional response from believers towards church closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. But how do spiritual ties to place actually contribute to a flourishing life? Previous work has explored the role of explicitly sacred environments (e.g., churches, temples, pilgrimage sites) on religious expression and practice, but recent theorizing suggests that people develop spiritual connections with many different types of places in their pursuit of a flourishing life. Nevertheless, there is little empirical research investigating how this unique type of emotional bond to place might be measured and shape human functioning.This collaborative project will answer three questions: 1. What varieties of spiritual ties to place exist? We will seek to identify the types of places where individuals feel an emotional bond to the sacred. 2. Is the nature of spiritual ties to place consistent across different religions and cultures? Using a diverse sample of participants, we will assess whether the dimensions of place spirituality vary across belief systems. 3. To what extent do spiritual ties to place relate to flourishing? We will explore whether spiritual ties to place might shape well-being, religious beliefs, and other important life outcomes.Using a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methodology to investigate these questions, this project will create a more substantial definition of spiritual ties to place, synthesize and broaden existing empirical literature in both environmental psychology and the scientific study of religion, and provide an empirically rigorous and robust tool for measuring this construct in future research.\n\nPlanning Grant\n\nReframing Covenant for Nursing Theory and Practice\n\nMrs. Dorolen Wolfs\n\nProject Director\n\nSessional Assistant Professor\n\nTrinity Western University, BC, Canada\n\nCo-investigators\n\nDr. Marsha Fowler\n\nSenior Fellow and Professor of Ethics and Faculty Scholarship\n\nAzusa Pacific University, CA\n\nDr. Darlaine Jantzen\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nTrinity Western University, BC, Canada\n\nDr. Lynn Musto\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nTrinity Western University, BC, Canada\n\nDr. Sheryl Reimer-Kirkham\n\nDean and Professor\n\nTrinity Western University, BC, Canada\n\nNurses shouldered remarkable social responsibility during the COVID-19 pandemic, providing faithful care with thin or missing resources, and exposing themselves to the SARS-CoV-2 virus while society sheltered at home. Support for this role typically derives from nurses’ duty to care, which some have described in the nursing literature as covenantal (Coffey, 2006; Stenberg, 1979). In the context of the nurse-patient relationship, covenant tends to be constructed as something more—an ethic of trust (Krauss, 1998; Hayes, 2020), a moral bond or commitment (Wagner, 2015), or as the foundation for ethics or ethical motives (Vogelstein, 2019). Nurse scholars from Christian and secular backgrounds have endeavored to clarify what covenant means, often by pointing to Christian theology, from where the concept was initially borrowed (Stenberg, 1979; Cooper, 1988) and by comparing it to contract (Bradshaw, 1994; Fowler, 2015; O’Brien, 2018). Currently, the social contract between society and the nursing profession is often perceived as broken. A lack of ethical commitments at all levels of healthcare has contributed to situations involving highly compromised care and individual nurses’ ethical practice being called into question. With nurses poised to leave healthcare in increasing numbers, we argue reframing covenant for nursing theory and practice is timely. Redefining covenantal caring as a bi-lateral covenantal alliance between the nursing profession and society may provide a fruitful path to articulate the shared, moral commitments of healthcare. Our purpose is to bring together nursing scholars with theologians, philosophers, and social scientists in a Think Tank, to conceptualize the parameters of the nursing profession’s covenant with society and translate covenantal caring for a broader audience. This will be the grounding for future research and development of a comprehensive covenantal ethic and pedagogical strategies for nursing students. Our unique contribution will be bridging the concept’s founding theological perspectives with nursing’s secular ethics, and how covenantal caring might be applied at social (macro) levels in addition to at the level of the individual (micro) nurse-patient encounter.\n\nInitiative Grants\n\nIs “Wisdom Literature” Dead? The Future of Israelite Wisdom Studies\n\nDr. Will Kynes\n\nProject Director\n\nAssociate Professor of Biblical Studies\n\nSamford University, AL\n\nCo-investigators\n\nDr. Mark Sneed\n\nProfessor of Bible\n\nLubbock Christian University, TX\n\nDr. Jacqueline Vayntrub\n\nAssociate Professor of Hebrew Bible\n\nYale University, CT\n\nWisdom is one of the richest gifts Israel’s Scriptures offer their readers. Indeed, Paul begins his endorsement of those Scriptures by praising their power to “make one wise” (2 Tim 3:15). However, current study of Israelite wisdom, which seeks to extract, examine, and understand that wisdom, is ensnarled in debate about fundamental features of the concept and its biblical expression. Questions about a purported “Wisdom tradition” in ancient Israel (Sneed 2011, 2015) have progressed into challenges to the “Wisdom Literature” category itself (Kynes 2019). Is this category a means of illuminating Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Job, and related texts, the concept of wisdom in the Bible, the theology of the Hebrew Bible, and the social world of ancient Israel, as the previous century of scholarship has assumed? Or is the category a nineteenth-century invention, which distorts our understanding of each topic by projecting post-Enlightenment values onto them. In other words, is “Wisdom Literature” more of a hindrance than a help? The field is currently in the midst of a “revolutionary phase” (Kuhn 1970), in which old paradigms and long-held assumptions may be questioned and new methods and theories proposed and debated. New approaches are transforming the study of texts, such as Proverbs and Sirach (e.g., Vayntrub 2019, 2021), and with them our understanding of the wisdom the Bible offers as a whole. As leading voices in this current debate, Sneed, Kynes, and Vayntrub aim in this project to capitalize on this transformative moment in the field by inviting leading wisdom scholars to weigh in on the current state of the debate and provide direction for its future. To reach both scholarly and broader audiences, they will host two panels, one at the Society of Biblical Literature Annual Meeting and the other online, and combine the proceeds with papers from a similar panel in April 2021 to produce an edited volume that will shape future study of wisdom in the Bible.\n\nReligious Faith and Meaning-Making: A Multidisciplinary Approach\n\nDr. Kirk Lougheed\n\nProject Director\n\nAssistant Professor of Philosophy and Director of the CFHF\n\nLCC International University, Lithuania\n\nCo-investigators\n\nDr. Joshua Harris\n\nAssistant Professor of Philosophy\n\nThe King’s University, AB, Canada\n\nDr. Elizabeth Jackson\n\nAssistant Professor of Philosophy\n\nToronto Metropolitan University, ON, Canada\n\nDr. Myron Penner\n\nProfessor of Philosophy\n\nTrinity Western University, BC, Canada\n\nDr. Tricia van Dyk\n\nAssistant Professor of Philosophy\n\nLCC International University, Lithuania\n\nReligious faith and its connection to meaning in life is a frequent object of study in the contemporary academy. It is studied in humanistic fields such as religious studies, history, and literature. It also occupies the attention of the social sciences, including in fields such as sociology, anthropology, cognitive science, and psychology. However, the work in humanistic disciplines on faith and meaning are not always informed by our best and most up to date scientific knowledge. The purpose of our grant is to bring together a group of Christian philosophers in order to examine the role that faith plays in meaning-making from a scientifically informed Christian perspective. Our group will then collaborate with an interfaith and non-confessional group of internationally recognized philosophers, cognitive scientists, and psychologists. There is a distinct need for Christian philosophers to stay up to date on current humanistic and scientific research in faith and its connection to meaning. For Christians typically hold that faith is an integral part of their life. It is often considered a life-changing event when a person comes to have religious faith. Alternatively, existential despair and dread are sometimes reported by the person who loses their religious faith. Not only is either type of event a significant moment in a person’s life, but how a person’s faith (or lack thereof) is lived out throughout the course of their life is also importantly connected to meaning. Contributing philosophical answers to questions about faith and meaning that incorporate a scientifically informed Christian perspective is our goal. The first phase of our project will consist of a group of Christian philosophers, but we will build up to an interfaith and non-confessional group in order to utilize the most up to date research from cognitive science and psychology. This will enable our grant to have a wide impact across the secular academy. The analytical tools characteristic of philosophy including conceptual analysis, logic, and clarity, make our team well poised to draw on insights from other humanistic fields such as Biblical studies and theology. Importantly, team members also have experience incorporating empirical research from cognitive science and psychology into their work. Our project is well-positioned to break new ground on this important topic, having the potential not only to help us better understand how faith shapes meaning in life, but to help us discover the role it ought to play in meaning-making from the Christian perspective.\n\nUnderstanding Resilience in Women Refugees\n\nDr. Jamie Sanchez\n\nProject Director\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nBiola University, CA\n\nCo-investigators\n\nDr. Laura Dryjanska\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nBiola University\n\nDr. Rachel Hagues\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nSamford University\n\nDr. Jackie Parke\n\nLicensed Psychologist\n\nPrivate Practice\n\nLimited research has been conducted specific to women refugees (Gissi, 2018), though some studies have considered the intersectionality of gender and migration (Marchand, 2008; Freedman, 2015). Resilience, or the ability to successfully overcome adversity (Masten, 2018), is one theme that has emerged in some studies about women refugees. For example, Munt (2012) asserted that female refugees have developed a vigilance that is demonstrated through the reflection of their life journeys. Additionally, Hutchinson and Dorsett (2012) asserted that refugee resilience depends on external environments as much as on internal strength. What is not known is what factors impact development of resilience in women refugees, specifically. For example, how does self-agency, religion, the refugee community, or the host community play a role in women refugees’ ability to be resilient? In this qualitative study, our aim is to understand factors that impact the development of resilience in women refugees. Through in-depth interviews and participant observation, we will gather data from adult women refugees in various sites throughout the world, utilizing connections in Poland, Romania, Italy, Germany, Lebanon, and in different parts of the he United States. Findings will broaden the understanding of the phenomenon of resilience with particular focus on how women refugees develop resilience. Additionally, research findings will be useful to educators and practitioners working with and preparing others to work with refugee populations, as it will further our understanding of how to better engage with women refugee populations. Data will be disseminated through conference and public engagement presentations, journal articles, and a research symposium hosted at Biola University.\n\nPlanning Grants\n\nPatristic Christianity and Contemporary Immigration: An Integrative Exploration of the Tradition for the Present\n\nGeorge Kalantzis\n\nProject Director\n\nProfessor of Theology\n\nWheaton College, IL\n\nMyles Werntz\n\nProject Co-Director\n\nAssociate Professor of Theology\n\nAbilene Christian University, TX\n\nThis project will investigate doctrinal and moral writings within the Christian tradition from between the 3rd-8th centuries, asking what light these texts and movements shed on contemporary questions of immigration. There has been a great deal of attention given to biblical sources for thinking about immigration, as well as attention from theological ethics, from philosophy, and from pastoral theology, but little has been done to ask what traditional Christian sources might have to add to offering a Christian response to the contemporary dynamics of immigration. Bringing together ethicists who are attuned to the patristic traditions of Christianity, with patristic scholars who are sensitive to the moral concerns of the era, this project will produce a volume, popular publications, and other forms of scholarly production which draws out the riches of the patristic world for one of the most pressing moral questions of our time.\n\nInitiative Grants\n\nWho “Belongs” at Uncle Sam’s Thanksgiving Table? Research and Dialogue on American History, Identity, and Immigration\n\nRuth Melkonian-Hoover\n\nProject Director\n\nProfessor\n\nGordon College , MA\n\nSoong-Chan Rah\n\nRobert Munger Professor of Evangelism\n\nFuller Theological Seminary, CA\n\nMatthew Rowley\n\nVisiting Fellow\n\nUniversity of Leicester, UK\n\nJudd Birdsall\n\nSenior Research Fellow\n\nGeorgetown University, DC\n\nThe 400th anniversaries of the Mayflower landing (fall 2020) and the first Thanksgiving in Plymouth, MA (fall 2021) come at a time of great insecurity and polarization about the past. Some celebrate the Pilgrims; others confront them. In the American church, likewise, polarized histories cut between and through denominations, exacerbating the intra-Christian “culture war.” Unable to articulate a clear and universally convincing narrative about where the nation came from, many Americans feel anxious or even threatened in discussions about the past or about the path forward. America’s ambiguous relationship with the Mayflower generation stems from fundamental tensions within that story: they fled the coercive arm of the English monarch but felt justified in enslaving Algonquians and Africans; many desired good for Native Americans but their individual and collective actions made coexistence difficult; persecution drove them from England, but they drove Native Americans from the land. Pilgrims represent the promise that America is a haven for the distressed and a refuge for the weary. From another perspective, they are a parable about power and imperialism. Re-examining Plymouth history and legacies of “founding” narratives is more important than ever. This project explores the complex relationship between three interrelated strands: colonial history, Christianity, and attitudes towards immigrants. The wake left by the Mayflower is still felt, particularly by indigenous communities impacted by the loss of land and by African Americans whose ancestors’ subjugation was intertwined with European liberty. The wake was also experienced by centuries of immigrants who felt unwelcomed because they did not descend from Pilgrim or Puritan stock. As a boat sends ripples on both sides, so the waves from the Mayflower roll in pro-immigrant and anti-immigrant directions. Scripture and theology have similarly been used for cross purposes, to welcome the immigrant or keep her out. The wake cuts across American history in curious, complex, and often contradictory ways. In focusing on the impact of the Pilgrims, it is not that all the wonders and woes of American history can be traced back to Plymouth. Rather, persons throughout American history have reached back to the Pilgrims and Puritans—often conflating or confusing the two—to legitimize their own plans for the nation. As this project aims to demonstrate, the ways people use the past often speaks volumes about their hopes and fears in the present.\n\nDevelopments and New Directions in Religion and Contemporary Art: A Curious Accord\n\nRachel Hostetter Smith\n\nProject Director\n\nGilkison Distinguished Professor of Art History\n\nTaylor University, IN\n\nRonald R. Bernier\n\nProfessor of Art History\n\nWentworth Institute of Technology, MA\n\nLinda Stratford\n\nProfessor, Art History & History and Director\n\nAsbury University, KY\n\nJames Romaine\n\nProfessor of Art History\n\nLander University, SC\n\nJonathan A. Anderson\n\nPostdoctoral Associate of Theology and the Visual Arts\n\nDuke Divinity School, KY\n\nIn 2004 James Elkins’ On the Strange Place of Religion in Contemporary Art was published, wherein the critic argued that a general tendency within the art world to see art that invokes religion in anything but a critical or derisive way as retrograde and reactionary. This presented a challenge to the profession to answer for its aversion to one of the most significant dimensions of human experience and diversity—faith and religious expression. Much has changed since this assessment was made. Artists, art historians, critics, and curators have vigorously challenged the assumed secularism of institutional art history, and a generation of scholarship and exhibition has developed that resists the skepticism that often still arises when religion is a topic of discussion in the academy. This initiative brings together established and emerging scholars and arts professionals who represent a diversity of disciplines and perspectives who are exploring the rich place of the sacred and the transcendent in contemporary visual culture, in order to help give shape to a field that has begun meaningfully to address arts’ (re)engagement with religion to recognize that faith and religious or spiritual experience are essential to the fabric of the social and to human being. This project aims to do two main things through 1) the development and publication of a substantial new book with about 30 contributors, 2) a significant scholarly symposium as follow up to spur additional new scholarship and cast a vision for the ongoing development of the field, and 3) the creation of a body of videotaped presentations and/or interviews to be posted online. First, it will identify and examine theoretical frameworks and interpretive strategies for exploring the reemergence of religion in the making, exhibition, and discussion of contemporary art. Second, it will examine common strategies contemporary artists employ in the interface between religion and contemporary art practice with a significant number of specific case studies. The work proposed would produce important new resources in this developing field of study and spawn new collaborations and projects for the future. Ultimately, this work provides platforms for vigorous and generous scholarly discourse and the production of serious new scholarship to prompt more “theo-aesthetic thinking” that is grounded in the richness of the Judeo-Christian faith to open up the field of art historical, critical and museological inquiry to include theological aesthetics that is revelatory, participatory, and potentially transformative.\n\nThe Sexual & Gender Identity Project+\n\nMark Yarhouse\n\nProject Director\n\nEndowed Chair and Professor of Psychology\n\nWheaton College, IL\n\nJanet Dean\n\nProfessor of Psychology\n\nAsbury University, KY\n\nStephen Stratton\n\nProfessor of Counseling and Pastoral Care\n\nAsbury Seminary, KY\n\nThe debate around the well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and other (LGBTQ+) students in religious settings has intensified this past year. News reports and monographs have attempted to paint a picture of mental health disparities between LGBTQ+ and heterosexual/cisgender students at private Christian colleges that are the result of discriminatory policies and religious tenets on sexual and gender identity and expression. Without a basis of research with comparison groups at public universities, those reports have described elevated rates of depression, anxiety, harassment, sexual assault, and disciplinary action. It is our concern that there are indicators of distress among LGBTQ+ students across faith-based and non-faith-based settings in which higher education takes place. We propose to address a research gap by comparing LGBTQ+ students at Christian colleges, LGBTQ+ students at public institutions, and comparison groups of straight/cisgender students in both settings, through a mixed-methods, cross-sectional study with an anonymous survey and optional confidential follow-up interview. With support from the planning grant we received from the CCCU this past year, we completed a pilot study with two institutions, one a private Christian college and the other a public university. Our proposed research will expand to include several more private Christian colleges and several more public universities so that we have an adequate number of LGBTQ+ and straight/cisgender participants to conduct the relevant analyses with comparison groups and to help us understand mental health disparities that may exist, as well as potential mitigating factors that may contribute to reduced risk across different educational settings. Our proposed research will reflect Christian perspectives in care for underserved and marginalized populations, as well as a Christian view of persons whose health is related to a cohesive view of self in relation to God and others. We hope to identify potential sources of mental health disparities, and to draw on the strengths of Christian colleges and universities in caring for the whole person in education and student development. We believe this research project will generate a number of deliverables that will benefit the larger academy through dialogue partnerships and improved student care across public and private institutions. We anticipate we will find broad parameters that are respectful of conventional religiosity while emphasizing models of assisting LGBTQ+ students as they integrate their religious and spiritual identities in ways that mediate potential distress and facilitate well-being of the whole person.\n\nPlanning Grants\n\nThe Christian Home in Global Protestant Mission Thought and Practice, 1800-2000\n\nAnneke Stasson\n\nProject Director\n\nAssociate Professor of Humanities and History\n\nIndiana Wesleyan University, IN\n\nLeanne Dzubinski\n\nAssociate Professor of Intercultural Education and Studies\n\nBiola University, CA\n\nSoojin Chung\n\nDirector of Intercultural Studies and Assistant Professor Intercultural Studies\n\nCalifornia Baptist University, CA\n\nA growing body of literature addresses Christian mission and domesticity. Still, few studies describe efforts by nonwestern Christians to spread an ideology of “the Christian home.” By analyzing books, conferences, and radio broadcasts prepared by Christian leaders in twentieth-century Asia, our study will begin to fill that gap in the literature. In America, “the Christian home” tends to signify an ideology of “male headship” and “female submission,” but leaders of a Christian Home movement in Asia tended to speak of marriage in terms of equality, partnership, and self-expression and to see the Christian home as a place of healing from the social disruption caused by colonial encounters and urbanization. Women missionaries established relationships with local women and subversively created spaces for communication and solidarity. In so doing, they weakened the gendered constructs of Confucian relationalism by presenting wives as partners with, rather than subject to, their husbands. By highlighting nonwestern perspectives on the Christian home, our study debunks the notion of Victorian normativity that has hitherto dominated academic discourse about Christian mission and domesticity. We argue that Christian reflection on home life constituted a significant and as yet underappreciated expression of contextual theology during the twentieth century.\n\nThe Gender Identity & Faith Project\n\nMark Yarhouse\n\nProject Director\n\nProfessor of Psychology\n\nWheaton College, IL\n\nStephen Stratton\n\nProfessor of Counseling & Pastoral Care\n\nAsbury Seminary, KY\n\nJanet Dean\n\nAssociate Professor of Psychology\n\nAsbury University, KY\n\nWe are in the midst of an important cultural moment around the issues of norms for sex and gender and also care for gender diverse persons. Discourse is heated and polarizing public policies may undermine care for people navigating gender identity questions. Our project is intended to extend the Christian academy’s voice to model and inform charitable public discourse bridging religious communities on one side and LGBTQ+ supporters on the other, with language valuing both conventional religiosity and diverse gender identities. Our proposed long-term project is to build upon a two-year pilot study to launch a larger, mixed-methods study to assess the experience of gender diverse students and to identify variables contributing to emotional and spiritual growth and well-being. We will study whether religiosity is a protective factor or risk factor for transgender and gender questioning persons, as well as the extent to which self-acceptance mediates the role of religiosity and social support on psychological health. The research team will build upon their experience in LGBTQ+ studies and their reputation beyond the Christian academy to generate and disseminate models for improving dialogue in which gender identity, religious identity, and the relationship between these two are taken seriously.\n\nInitiative Grants\n\nBetween Pandemic and Protest: Exploring the Future of the Liberal Arts in Higher Education\n\nNoah Toly\n\nProject Director\n\nProfessor of Urban Studies and Politics and International Relations Wheaton College, IL\n\nJeffrey Bilbro\n\nAssociate Professor of English\n\nGrove City College, PA\n\nKristin Kobes du Mez\n\nProfessor of History\n\nCalvin University, MI\n\nDavid Henreckson\n\nRaquet Endowed Director’s Chair, Institute for Leadership and Service (Religion)\n\nValparaiso University, IN\n\nJonathan Tran\n\nGeorge W. Baines Professor of Religion\n\nBaylor University, TX\n\nJessica Hooten Wilson\n\nLouise Cowan Scholar in Residence (Literature)\n\nUniversity of Dallas, TX\n\nCOVID-19 has been apocalyptic for higher education, and indeed for our nation as a whole. It has intensified pressures already threatening liberal arts education: concerns over the cost of college, particularly for majors without clear career outcomes; the popularity of professional degrees with large numbers of required credits; the push for badges or micro-credentials as alternatives to a four-year degree; declining birth rates; the growth of online programs and other hybrid forms of “content delivery.” Concerns over the practicality of the liberal arts intensify ongoing questions about the very idea of moral formation central to this tradition. And within our nation, the pandemic has exacerbated preexisting inequalities and racial injustice. Pandemic conditions have fueled a surprisingly robust protest movement that is powerfully, and inspiringly, raising questions too often ignored by Christian educators. These are particularly pressing issues for Christian colleges and universities, which situate career preparation, moral formation, and critical inquiry within a broader vision for spiritual vocation. This project gathers faculty from a variety of Christian institutions to lead conversations regarding the enduring relevance of the liberal arts. Participants will lead video and audio conversations with a variety of stakeholders—including students, faculty, administrators, and residence life leaders—over the course of the coming academic year. The 2020-2021 academic year will likely prove an inflection point for higher education as the coronavirus pandemic and #BlackLivesMatters protests accentuate financial difficulties and surface mission ambiguities. Might it be a tipping point in a positive direction, as institutions seek to better equip students for the complexities facing them? Our conversations will enable colleges and universities across the country to learn from one another in addressing these challenges and opportunities, and they will encourage these institutions to draw on the rich heritage of the liberal arts tradition, while acknowledging its historical limitations, in shaping their responses. We will launch a website this fall to host such discussions while these events unfold. In the summer of 2021, we will then convene a public conference to digest what we have learned. The following year we will continue hosting online conversations while also preparing a book manuscript for publication. Our audience will include those within higher education—faculty, administrators, and residence life leaders—as well as prospective students and their parents. Our goal is to think and talk in public about the enduring value of the liberal arts for the particular concerns and challenges of our time.\n\nFlourishing Congregations in Canada\n\nMichael Wilkinson\n\nProject Director\n\nProfessor of Sociology\n\nTrinity Western University, BC, Canada\n\nMark Chapman\n\nAssociate Professor of Research Methods and Director of Doctoral Ministry Program\n\nTyndale University and Seminary, ON, Canada\n\nCatherine Holtmann\n\nAssistant Professor of Sociology\n\nUniversity of New Brunswick, NB, Canada\n\nSam Reimer\n\nProfessor of Sociology\n\nCrandall University, NB, Canada\n\nKathleen Steeves\n\nAssistant Professor of Sociology\n\nTrinity Western University, BC, Canada\n\nJoel Thiessen\n\nProfessor of Sociology\n\nAmbrose University, AB, Canada\n\nHuman and institutional flourishing is an area of interest among scholars and practitioners, especially in times of upheaval and social change. This project seeks to study flourishing congregations, notably, Catholic, Mainline Protestant, and evangelical Protestant churches in Canada. Two questions shape our study on flourishing congregations: (1) What are the mechanisms, pathways and processes that contribute to congregational flourishing? (2) How does congregational flourishing intersect with individuals, neighborhoods, and organizations? By flourishing congregations we refer to the complex and nuanced interplay between the following: organizational ethos (self-identity, leadership, innovation, structure and process), internal attention (discipleship, engaged laity, hospitable community, diversity) and outward focus (neighborhood involvement, partnerships, evangelism). Case studies will allow us to analyze and assess the role of congregations for understanding the personal, organizational, and social well-being of communities. Congregations play an important role in serving communities and the people they interact with as sources of human, social, and spiritual capital. Research shows that when congregations flourish, its members and neighborhoods also flourish. This study will allow us to consider and evaluate the contribution congregations make to the flourishing of individuals in urban settings, small towns, families, and alongside other important civil society groups including social and human service agencies that partner with local congregations.\n\nDoes grace to the undeserving have social costs? Investigating the prevalence and observer perceptions of benevolent responses to offensive or toxic comments in online discourse\n\nAlison Young Reusser\n\nProject Director\n\nAssistant Professor of Psychology\n\nHoughton College, NY\n\nJonathan Case\n\nProfessor of Theology\n\nHoughton College, NY\n\nLisa Gassin\n\nProfessor of Psychology\n\nOlivet Nazarene University, IL\n\nKristian Veit\n\nProfessor of Psychology\n\nOlivet Nazarene University, IL\n\nImagine you read a comment in an online forum you find deeply offensive. A second individual jumps in and, instead of criticizing the first commenter, she writes in an empathic tone, saying she understands where the first commenter is coming from even though they disagree. How might your view of this second individual change as a result of her empathic, benevolent approach? Would you evaluate her more positively? Or would you believe she is compromising, even endorsing the first commenter’s statement? Research into one benevolent response to an offense, forgiveness, suggests that those who forgive may be seen by observers as somewhat weaker and less competent (e.g., in the case of romantic infidelity; Smith, Goode, Balzarini & Ryan, 2014) than those who take a stand (e.g., by leaving the offender). Further, if the offense impacts multiple victims, one victim who forgives may be evaluated by others as less benevolent toward them and as overclaiming their right to forgive (Raj, Wiltermuth, & Adams, 2019). Our research program is aimed at exploring the impact of an online commenter’s expressions of benevolence (e.g., empathy, forgiveness, understanding, love, etc.) in response to online conflict on observers’ evaluations of that commenter. Our plan is to use a mixed-methods approach with exploratory sequential and explanatory sequential elements with the following phases: (1) a “big data” investigation of large text corpuses from online discussion fora/comment sections (e.g., reddit, YouTube, etc.) using machine learning to understand the prevalence of benevolent responses to conflict; (2) focus group and individual interviews to evaluate the context and personal experience of benevolent responses to online conflict; (3) informed by the previous phases, development and administration of a quantitative survey to a large, diverse online sample to understand observer responses to a benevolent commenter (in terms of, e.g., evaluations, perceived competence, perceived benevolence toward observers, overclaiming the right to act benevolently), as well as (4) a quantitative experiment manipulating the benevolence/punitiveness of a response and investigating how that response impacts observers’ attitudes toward the responder. Our final step (5) will be to follow up with an explanatory qualitative study to explain any interesting or unexpected findings from previous phases. This research will involve student collaboration and will be disseminated at international, national and regional conferences. One or more manuscripts will be submitted to high-quality, peer-reviewed journals in the fields of psychology and communication.\n\nPlanning Grants\n\nUnderstanding the Impact of Displacement on Women Refugees in Europe\n\nJamie Sanchez\n\nProject Director\n\nAssistant Professor, Intercultural Studies\n\nBiola University, CA\n\nMandy Baraka\n\nAssistant Professor, Counselor Education and Supervision\n\nHuntington University, IN\n\nLaura Dryjanska\n\nAssistant Professor, Psychology\n\nBiola University, CA\n\nBy the end of 2017, more than 68.5 million people had been displaced from their homes, either as internally displaced persons or as refugees, due to violent conflict, persecution, famine, or natural disasters (Braithwaite, Salehyan, & Savun, 2018). This project seeks to understand the impact of such displacement on women refugees throughout Europe. While there is a growing amount of literature throughout several different disciplines in the academy about the topic of refugees, broadly speaking, there is little research conducted on understanding the impact that displacement has on women refugees. The proposed long-term project seeks to fill the academic gap while producing research that is helpful to practitioners who work with NGOs, government agencies, and refugee agencies. The team will conduct qualitative field research gathering data from women who have been displaced from their homes and relocated to Europe. The grant team is comprised of three Christian female scholars which provides a unique positionality for this project. As Christian scholars in the field of cultural studies, counselor education, and psychology, there will be particular focus on themes of human agency, the role of worldview in crisis, identity and human flourishing.\n\nInitiative Grants\n\nReligion and the pueblo in the aftermath of Hurricane María\n\nJulianne Bryant\n\nProject Director\n\nAssociate Professor, Spanish\n\nBiola University, CA\n\nMelanie Nyhof\n\nAssistant Professor, Psychology\n\nNorthwestern College, IA\n\nEundria Hill-Joseph\n\nAssistant Professor, Sociology\n\nBiola University, CA\n\nJennifer Abe\n\nSenior Research Associate\n\nLoyola Marymount University, CA\n\nEliezer Ronda Pagán\n\nPastor\n\nIglesia Cristiana (Discípulos de Cristo) Metropolitana, PR\n\nAbstract\n\nReligion has been shown to provide a forward focus, beyond one’s current circumstances and, thus, create an empowering and unifying function. Various studies demonstrate a correlation between religion and positive coping and resiliency following stressful or traumatic events, some even measuring posttraumatic growth. This understanding has informed the scientific study of religion in dealing with the aftermath of a natural disaster, an emerging and growing field of inquiry. Many resources have been developed to encourage the integration of religious and spiritual elements in disaster relief efforts. And current research has supported the benefits of positive religious and spiritual care in disaster survivors. However, studies examining spiritual and emotional care in practice are very limited. Even fewer are investigations within actual church communities. This study proposes to investigate how religion has influenced the spiritual and emotional care of the people of Puerto Rico following Hurricane María in three specific religious communities in San Juan and Caguas, Puerto Rico. We define spiritual and emotional care as any intervention that mitigates distress and promotes emotional health and well-being. Specifically, we seek to investigate: • How have clergy provided spiritual and emotional care for community members? • How have clergy experienced spiritual and emotional care? • How have community members experienced spiritual and emotional care? • How have other church staff/community members provided spiritual and emotional care to each other? Examining these multiple church communities, using mixed-methods (both qualitative and quantitative) approaches and involving both clergy and community members as co-researchers we will better understand how religion has influenced their spiritual and emotional care in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. With this new understanding we will be able to isolate variables and develop models for practitioners that may contribute to a more culturally sensitive practice. This knowledge will also contribute to theory building, as the development of robust theories that are able to guide practice in the field of Disaster Spiritual and Emotional Care are only beginning to appear. Our multi-disciplinary research team is a unique and valuable aspect to this proposed project. Not only do the investigators represent the fields of Hispanic Sociolinguistics, Clinical Psychology, Developmental Psychology and Sociology, but they each have engaged in multi-disciplinary training and experience within their own fields. This will allow us to bring diverse perspectives to the study and to disseminate the findings to a wider audience, thus increasing the overall impact of the study of religion within the social sciences.\n\nPlanning Grants\n\nThe Music of Social Protest: An Intersection of Politics and Faith in Latin America\n\nNestor Quiroa\n\nProject Director\n\nAssociate Professor of Spanish\n\nWheaton College, IL\n\nWilfredo Canales\n\nAssociate Professor of Spanish and Latin American Culture\n\nDepartment of Modern Languages\n\nOlivet Nazarene University, IL\n\nLindy Scott\n\nProfessor of Spanish and Latin American Studies\n\nWhitworth University, WA\n\nGretchen Abernathy\n\nTranslator and Editor\n\nFreelance Consultant\n\nAbstract\n\n“These songs are sung today, they were sung yesterday. They will be sung forever.” With this proclamation Miguel Ángel Asturias, Guatemalan Nobel Laureate in Literature, expressed his admiration for the first collection of Latin American social protest songs, compiled by the Italian Meri Franco-Lao in 1968. Asturias’ prophetic statement reveals the significance of this musical genre in the history and culture of Latin America. Nevertheless, Latin American social protest music has not received the attention from the academic world in the United States that it deserves. We believe that this neglect is due to two main reasons. The secular academic might feel awkward or ill-prepared to address the faith elements alluded to in most of these songs. The religious academician might feel that the songs’ themes of exile, justice, freedom, and shalom are too “liberationist” or revolutionary for Christian students accustomed to a more “feel-good” faith. This project responds to this academic reticence by situating Latin American social protest songs in their historical, social, and religious contexts as well as exploring the themes that emerge in light of biblical teaching.\n\nCreative Dance to Foster Resilience in K-12 At-Risk Youth\n\nEmily Wright\n\nProject Director\n\nAssociate Professor of Dance\n\nBelhaven University, MS\n\nSally Schwer Canning\n\nProfessor of Psychology\n\nWheaton College, IL\n\nMerry Lynn Morris\n\nAssistant Director of Dance Program\n\nUniversity of South Florida, FL\n\nLaura Morton\n\nAssociate Professor of Dance\n\nBelhaven University, MS\n\nBradford Smith\n\nDirector, Institute for International Care and Counsel Belhaven University, MS\n\nAbstract\n\nConsiderable evidence supports a link between adverse childhood experiences and long-term negative outcomes (Taylor, Way, and Seeman, 2011), yet, not all children and adolescents who experience chronic stressors develop problems due to what is termed resilience (McLaughlin, K. and Lambert, H., 2017). Recent research from the National Organization of Arts in Health demonstrates that creative arts therapies contribute to resilience in diverse populations (Lambert, Betts, Rollins, Sonke & Swanson, 2017). This project seeks to cultivate resilience through a creative dance intervention by: (1) developing a workshop model that investigates the resilience-building potential of creative dance for K-12 at-risk youth in the Stewpot Community Services After-school program in Jackson, Mississippi; and (2) utilizing methodological approaches that further contribute to resilience by employing a research design that situates participants as co-researchers and cultivates skills in cooperation, empowerment, agency, creativity, relationship-building, and community development through a collaborative dance-making project. The core activity of the planning stage is the gathering of the research team in Jackson for a shared experience of relationship development and learning with Stewpot Community Services staff and West Jackson community members. This workshop model could provide a framework for developing effective, low cost, and scalable approaches for other contexts.\n\nInitiative Grants\n\nReexamining Evangelical Populism and Evangelical Internationalism\n\nKevin den Dulk\n\nProject Director\n\nProfessor of Political Science\n\nCalvin College, MI\n\nRobert Joustra\n\nAssociate Professor of Politics & International Studies\n\nRedeemer University College, Ontario, Canada\n\nDennis Hoover Editor (political science)\n\nThe Review of Faith & International Affairs\n\nAbstract\n\nIn contemporary scholarship and popular discourse two starkly different narratives are common regarding the role of evangelical Protestant Christianity in American global engagement generally and U.S. foreign policy specifically: evangelical populism versus evangelical internationalism. The former narrative pictures evangelicalism, especially in its various fundamentalist and charismatic expressions, as comprising the bedrock religious constituency for right-wing populism and associated ideologies of nationalism and nativism. The latter narrative asserts a growing trend of “new internationalism” among many evangelical leaders and institutions, especially over matters of religious liberty, humanitarian aid, immigration, and global health. Despite the prominence of these conflicting narratives, however, we know relatively little about their intersections, breadth of acceptance, and current and future trend lines. There is a need for empirical research to better measure and estimate the extent to which contemporary American evangelicalism actually fits either (or both) of these narratives, as well as evangelical approaches to world affairs that fit neither of the narratives. Too often the lack of nuanced and fine-grained research enables simplistic paradigms and misleading characterizations to go unchallenged, both within academia and in policy and media discourse more broadly. Deepening and clarifying our assumptions about evangelical international engagement is particularly important in this moment of great normative debate over the political role of evangelicals—a debate that often focuses on domestic policy and politics and neglects the complexity of faith in international affairs. This project will address these needs for empirical research through a series of convenings and publications bringing together leading scholars from multiple institutions (within the CCCU and broader networks) and from multiple disciplines. The principal methodologies that will be employed in this collaborative scholarship are (1) historical analysis, (2) survey data analysis, (3) media studies, and (4) interest group and party organization studies. The consortium of scholars will build on existing research and fill gaps, with particular emphasis on research approaches that integrate studies of both leadership and laity within evangelicalism. Through a series of articles in two separate journals with wide readerships, both in the scholarly guild and among attentive practitioners, we hope to engage scholars and political professionals, Christian and non-Christian alike, over the research findings.\n\nShaping Citizenship: Christian Institutions and Youth in Africa\n\nMegan Hershey\n\nAssociate Professor\n\nDepartment of Political Science\n\nWhitworth University, WA\n\nTracy Kuperus\n\nProject Director\n\nProfessor and Director\n\nInternational Development Studies Program\n\nCalvin College, MI\n\nAmy Patterson\n\nProfessor\n\nDepartment of Politics\n\nSewanee University of the South, TN\n\nAbstract\n\nThis project explores the relationship between Christian institutions and youth citizenship in Africa. African youth, comprising over 30 percent of the continent’s population, face a precarious socioeconomic environment with high levels of poverty, yet they also constitute a growing number of African Christians and a key political group. We analyze Christian institutions such as ecumenical bodies, para-church organizations, and faith-based organizations across denominational lines. Defining citizenship as actions (e.g., voting and volunteering) and norms that promote those actions (e.g., responsibility and reciprocity), we address three significant questions: (1) How do Christian institutions shape citizenship norms and behaviors among African youth? (2) How do Christian institutions prioritize citizenship norms and behaviors, depending on gender? (3) How do these Christian efforts influence how youth themselves understand citizenship and act on that understanding?\n\nBoth the literature on African politics and religion and the scholarship on African youth have ignored these questions. Our project addresses this omission through its comparative analysis of countries that all have Christian majorities, but varying levels of democratic governance: South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia. Recognizing youth as a heterogenous group, we adopt a multimethod approach to examine the complexities of gender, nationality, and citizenship. In 2018, we will statistically analyze Afrobarometer data on religiosity and youth political engagement to generate broad findings. In 2019, each scholar will travel to a different country to interview national church officials about youth and citizenship and to conduct a case study of a faith-based organization that trains youth on citizenship. The case studies will include a pre- and post-training questionnaire, participant observation, and focus group discussions with participants, segregated by gender. To deepen the analysis, and to isolate the effects of the trainings, we will also conduct focus group discussions with youth who have not participated in these trainings.\n\nThe project reflects the belief that Christian institutions have the potential to foster good governance and promote human flourishing, and our work will inform Christian efforts in these areas. Our attention to the voices of Christian youth will innovatively enhance knowledge on the complexities of religion and politics in Africa.\n\nSupplemental Grant\n\nMulti-institutional Campus Safety and Preventing Misconduct Project\n\nNathan Tintle\n\nProject Director\n\nProfessor of Statistics\n\nDordt College, IA\n\nKristin Van De Griend\n\nAdjunct instructor of Social Work; Research Associate\n\nDordt College, IA\n\nJames R. Vanderwoerd\n\nProfessor of Social Work\n\nRedeemer University College, Ontario, Canada\n\nAbstract\n\nRecently, a study conducted in Canadian Christian colleges revealed that more than 20% of female students had experienced sexual violence in the previous 12 months, numbers in line with national surveys of secular colleges and universities which claim that as many as one in four women will survive a completed or attempted rape while in college. Intimate partner, including dating violence, and sexual violence have numerous adverse consequences on well-being, including education, employment, and long-term psychological well-being. Evidence shows that violence prevention education programs can reduce the incidence of sexual violence. To be most effective, prevention programs need to be multi-level and be created by experts in multiple disciplines. A majority of prevention programs are secular programs that may have less efficacy on Christian campuses than one created with a Christian framework. The aims of this project are to 1) better understand, through survey validation, the experiences and prevalence of sexual misconduct and harassment, dating violence, and stalking on college campuses; 2) examine the approaches used by Christian faculty and staff to uniquely and compassionately respond in these situations; and 3) develop a pilot, multi-level violence prevention program that builds on the unique Christian approaches already taken in order to better address campus safety and misconduct on our campuses, in a scalable and quantitatively effective manner that is relevant for both Christian and non-Christian campuses alike.\n\nPlanning Grants\n\nReligious Communities as a Social Support Source for Children and Families Experiencing Stressful Life Events\n\nRobert Crosby\n\nProject Director\n\nAssistant Professor of Psychology,\n\nOnline and Professional Studies\n\nCalifornia Baptist University\n\nErin Smith\n\nAssistant Professor of Psychology\n\nCalifornia Baptist University\n\nLeon Blanchette\n\nChair of Christian Ministries\n\nOlivet Nazarene University\n\nGregory Palardy\n\nAssociate Professor of Education\n\nUniversity of California\n\nAbstract\n\nSocial support is crucial to the well-being of children because it mitigates the negative effects of stressful life events. Children’s social support research generally focuses on support received at home and in school, but many children do not receive support from these conventional sources. Given the enduring presence of religion in the USA, some authors suggest that religious communities, such as churches, are a potential source of social support for children and families. However, this line of research is relatively new and still somewhat limited in scope and impact. The purpose of this study is to build on this growing body of research to (1) determine whether churches are a viable and significant source of social support to children and families and (2) to identify the characteristics of churches that are most supportive. The sample will consist of school-aged children, their parents, and the children’s church program leaders in 30 diverse churches. Using a multi-level modeling approach, we will determine the church-level variables most strongly associated children and parents’ supportive experiences. In addition to contributing to the social development literature, the findings will inform practice for those seeking to identify and foster supportive social networks for children in stressful situations.\n\nEffectiveness of Approaches to Exposing Engineering Students to Service\n\nMichael Foster\n\nAssociate Professor of Mechanical Engineering\n\nGeorge Fox University\n\nGary Spivey\n\nProfessor of Electrical Engineering\n\nGeorge Fox University\n\nJustin Vander Werff\n\nAssociate Professor of Engineering\n\nDordt College\n\nGayle Ermer\n\nProfessor of Engineering\n\nCalvin College\n\nBrian Swartz\n\nAssociate Professor of Engineering\n\nMessiah College\n\nNorman Reese\n\nAssociate Professor of Mechanical Engineering Technology\n\nLeTourneau University\n\nWilliam Jordan\n\nProfessor of Mechanical Engineering\n\nBaylor University\n\nAbstract\n\nService is a key area of praxis for the Christian faith, and the engineering programs in the CCCU have taken a variety of approaches to expose students to service through engineering. This grant will support the examination of the effectiveness of several approaches. This research will identify effective strategies for teaching engineering with a service-oriented pedagogy. Several approaches are already in use, but their impact has not been carefully studied. An intentional planning process is needed to develop sound assessment practices to compare learning gains made across several institutions that employ different educational strategies. A small scale pilot study conducted at one institution relied primarily on student survey results. Those survey will need to be generalized for use across multiple institutions and re-validated. Once the data is obtained, the grant writers will partner with undergraduate students to analyze the results and draw conclusions. The outcomes will provide each participating institution with insight into their own programs. In addition, the partnership across multiple institutions facilitates idea sharing and improved strategies for each involved.\n\nChristianity, Youth, and Democratic Citizenship in Africa\n\nTracy Kuperus\n\nProject Director\n\nProfessor\n\nCalvin College\n\nMegan Hershey\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nWhitworth University\n\nAmy Patterson\n\nCarl Biehl Professor of International Affairs\n\nUniversity of the South\n\nAbstract\n\nThis project investigates the role of Christian organizations in fostering citizenship among African youth. Despite the advance of democratization in Africa since the 1990s, the sub-Saharan region demonstrates few instances of genuine liberal democracy. Indeed, many scholars are concerned about democracy’s stagnation since the mid-2000s. This struggle for democratic consolidation at least partially reflects the underdevelopment of a robust citizenship in Africa, where citizens have been relatively unwilling to participate in politics and to hold government accountable. In Africa’s increasingly undemocratic environment, youth have the potential to engage in civil unrest or to advance the continent’s democratic project. As a distinct and recognizable group in African politics and religious organizations, youth are crucial for the development of democratic citizenship, peaceful mobilization, socioeconomic development, and African Christianity. Through research with Christian organizations that work with youth on citizenship activities in South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, and Zambia, we will investigate how religion may affect citizenship among young people. Using interviews, focus group discussions, participant observations, and survey data, we will explore how Christian organizations define citizenship, why they design citizenship projects for youth (if they do), and how these efforts shape young people’s citizenship attitudes and behaviors.\n\nInitiative Grants\n\nSouth Asian Christianity in Transition: Identity, Theological Education, and the Plight of the Marginal\n\nChandra Mallampalli\n\nProject Director\n\nProfessor of History\n\nWestmont College\n\nDr Dyron Daughrity\n\nProfessor of Religion\n\nPepperdine University\n\nAbstract\n\nIn recent decades, developments in global Christianity have attracted increased scholarly attention. An important but often overlooked dimension of this scholarship is South Asian Christianity. Religious transformations among Indian, Nepalese, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and Sri Lankan Christians present critical insights concerning religious identities, the plight of marginal peoples and responses of theological education. By bringing these topics into dialogue with literature on global Christianity, this project will enhance our understanding of this vital dimension of the global church, while engaging in fruitful comparative analysis with other regional studies.\n\nOur research project examines three distinct but related aspects of the church in South Asia: first, the heated debate over religious conversion; second, the response of theological education to changing economic and socio-political contexts; and third, the predominant role of marginal groups – specifically Dalit (outcaste) and Tribal communities in southern, central, and North East India. The goals of the study are to a) produce two scholarly monographs relating to South Asian Christianity, b) host an international workshop on religious conversion at a participating CCCU college with an aim to publish the proceedings as an edited volume, and c) establish mutually enriching ties between CCCU affiliated institutions in the United States and institutions of higher learning—both Christian and secular—in South Asia. As well-established scholars of history and religious studies (with strong records of research and publication on South Asian Christianity), the team members of this project, Chandra Mallampalli of Westmont College and Dyron Daughrity of Pepperdine University will bring interdisciplinary approaches to the project’s key areas of study.\n\nAt the heart of this initiative are Christian practices tied to the mission of the gospel in South Asia and empathy for the persecuted Christians there. We seek to cultivate supportive and encouraging bonds of Christian fellowship with South Asian Christians who are facing hostility and increased marginalization, particularly within the present climate of Hindu nationalism. By nurturing ties with theological institutions in South Asia, we intend to offer our support and expertise to those seeking to connect with scholars on the outside. Their stories, in turn, will enrich our understanding of the lived experiences of fellow believers, and inform the scholarship we will produce for the broader academy. By advancing research on the topics addressed in this proposal, we hope to stimulate new avenues for advocacy and support for Christians living in times of persecution and duress.\n\nInformed compassion: how faith shapes decisions in Christian relief\n\nMichael Veatch\n\nProject Director\n\nProfessor of Mathematics\n\nGordon College\n\nDanilo Dierdichs\n\nAssistant professor of Mathematics\n\nWheaton College\n\nPaul Isihara\n\nAssistant professor of Mathematics\n\nWheaton College\n\nJarrod Goentzel\n\nDirector, MIT Humanitarian Response Lab\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nAbstract\n\nFaith-based organizations (FBOs) play an increasing role in responding to humanitarian crises. While FBO involvement has been scrutinized, this study asks the unique question of how Christian perspectives influence the planning and implementation of disaster relief. With the increased sophistication of humanitarian relief efforts, it is timely to ask how FBOs compare with other organizations in their shared mission of delivering relief, and where FBOs can make unique contributions.\n\nResponse to a major disaster involves rapid movement of people and supplies. The logistics (procurement and transport of goods) can easily be 80% of the total expenditures. The response takes place in a challenging environment, with limited resources, life and death decisions, uncertainty about needs, and limited or damaged infrastructure. Our thesis is that the decisions made by Christian organizations about how they respond to a crisis can, and should, be affected by their unique values. We consider two levels of decision-making. At a higher level, FBOs must establish resource allocation goals involving categories, populations and locations. Then, detailed decisions turn goals into the movement of resources through the supply chain to the beneficiaries. Both of these involve tradeoffs, and the tradeoffs made reflect values.\n\nA quantitative approach will be taken to measure the preferences of FBOs for different outcomes and to model how these values lead to decisions in the process of disaster response. A comparison with other organizations will also be undertaken. First, logisticians at these organizations will be surveyed about their detailed logistics decisions and organizational values. To demonstrate how these values can shape a response, a model will be developed for a large FBO that incorporates their values to optimize a logistical response. Second, conjoint analysis will assess the preferences of FBO decision-makers, including the higher level of resource allocation. These preferences will then be used in a decision analysis to illustrate how a second NGO’s resource allocation decisions can incorporates these preferences. A framework will be developed describing the decisions and potential outcomes. Both studies will seek to demonstrate how distinctive Christian values are incorporated in their decisions and how their planning could be better aligned with their organizational values. To focus our study, we consider U.S.-based Christian FBOs responding to a disaster with significant logistics.\n\nPlanning Grants\n\nChristian Voices in Musicology\n\nTimothy H. Steele\n\nProject Director\n\nAssociate Professor of Music\n\nCalvin College\n\nJohann Buis\n\nProfessor of Music\n\nWheaton College\n\nStanley Pelkey\n\nAssistant Professor of Music\n\nWestern Michigan University\n\nAbstract\n\nThere is a significant need for Christian music scholars to address issues raised by major reorientation in the discipline of musicology since the 1980s: what music counts for study, analysis and critical reflection, and what place has the particular identity of the musicologist in her orientation to research and in the shaping of critical observations and theoretical frameworks. The members of the planning team propose to initiate a research project that will engage in path-breaking work on these core questions of the discipline. Varied approaches to this task have already been discussed among the team members, including a thematic approach that would address specific issues and motivate particular research projects. Suggested themes include the formation of musical identity, the nature of musical meaning, the relationship of music to recent critical thought about human embodiment, and human creativity in the midst of relationship and community. Questions to be asked include, “What musicological work might be prompted by Christian concern for social justice?” and “How ought musicologists to confront the problem of evil?” As scholars with deep Christian convictions, we intend to explore these themes and others as ways of interacting with and responding to the assumptions that have shaped musicology over the last twenty years, recognizing that although music has been the subject of much Christian thinking there is no clear framework or set of scholarly agendas for Christian musicologists. Our proposal for this planning grant is to create the context within which we can explore various perspectives and achieve a clear focus for the extended research project we will propose following the planning period. We anticipate meeting on two occasions for intensive discussion of the project and for refinement of the Initiative Grant proposal. These meetings will take place in the early summer and autumn of 2008. We envision the larger project for which this it the planning stage to result in a book of essays and conference presentations by members of the project team and additional contributors.\n\nTowards a Christian Conception of the State’s Role in Creation Care\n\nJohn L. Hiemstra\n\nProject Director\n\nProfessor of Political Science\n\nThe King’s University College\n\nJohn R. Wood\n\nAcademic Dean\n\nAu Sable Institute of Environmental Studies\n\nProfessor of Biology and Environmental Studies\n\nThe King’s University College\n\nJonathan P. Chaplin\n\nDirector\n\nKirby Laing Institute for Christian Ethics, Tyndale House, Cambridge\n\nAbstract\n\nContemporary environmental crises are sending churches and Christian NGOs to the Christian scholarly community for guidance on, and understanding of, the state’s role in creation care. Many Christian traditions address issues of faith and politics, but have done little sustained reflection on the nature of the state’s and government’s role in society. When addressing environmental questions, they often utilize ethical approaches that give little direction on the distinctive task of the state in creation care. Roman Catholic and Reformed traditions have produced in-depth philosophical reflection on the state’s role but little directly on the state’s role in creation care. Furthermore, many mainstream secular approaches to the state’s role on the environment no longer seem to work, for example, the environmental movements’ failure to achieve significant governmental action on global warming. Critics attribute this failure in part to the underlying Enlightenment liberal assumptions of the dominant view of government. The Christian communities with traditions of reflecting on the state’s role are in an excellent position to contribute to the renewal and deepening of faith-based and mainstream reflection on the state’s role in creation care. This is so precisely because they have the experience and approaches required to engage the deeper religious and philosophical roots of these questions as well as theories that acknowledge the complex, plural structure of society. Our research network will make an interdisciplinary contribution to the development of a Christian framework for understanding the state’s role in creation care.\n\nAmerican Pentecostalism’s Engagement with Race and Ethnicity: Historical Realities and Theological Perspectives\n\nDr. Arlene M. Sanchez Walsh\n\nProject Director\n\nAssociate Professor, Haggard School of Theology, Azusa Pacific University\n\nDr. Paul Alexander\n\nProfessor of Theology and Ethics\n\nAsuza Pacific University\n\nDr. Anthea Butler\n\nAssistant Professor of Religious Studies\n\nUniversity of Rochester\n\nAbstract\n\nAs Pentecostalism enters its 2nd American century, one of its critical issues will be how it continues to function as a multicultural entity. The purpose of this planning group is to grapple with the historical and theological issues embedded in the overarching theme. The eventual outcome of this planning group’s work will be to collaborate with interested clergy and other academics in producing work relevant to local churches as it will challenge the historiographical trend in American Pentecostal history that suggests that racial inclusion evident in the early years of the movement was evidence of a sustained effort towards racial equality.\n\nThis collaboration will lay the groundwork for producing work relevant to the local church and denominations presented by our clergy. We also hope to provide proscriptive solutions to help American Pentecostalism manage the inevitable demographic shift to help dominant white majority movement to a movement coming closer to demographic parity. We want to argue that the current problems of race/ ethnicity in Pentecostalism are traceable to the very roots of the movement. We also want to break with the black/ white dichotomy that has marked much of the debate and acknowledge that issues of race/ ethnicity in American Pentecostalism are not simply products of a white dominant culture suppressing people of color, but in fact, of people of color often suppressing each other, especially in the late 20th and early 21st century urban centers where African Americans, Latinos, and Asians often compete for scarce goods, services, and compete in a complex religious marketplace. As theologians, we want to offer a broader view of the ethical dimensions of personhood, of abuses of power and again bring the Pentecostal church to a reckoning with its multicultural realities and offer a suitable pneumatology for how the church can be truly multicultural and not just a gathering place for diverse peoples.\n\nInitiative Grants\n\nChristian Reasoning\n\nJens Zimmermann\n\nProject Director\n\nProfessor of English and CRC Chair for Interpretation, Religion and Culture\n\nTrinity Western University\n\nTony Cummins\n\nAssociate Professor of Religious Studies\n\nTrinity Western University\n\nMatthew Levering\n\nAssociate Professor of Theology\n\nAve Maria University\n\nJudith Toronchuk\n\nAssistant Professor of Psychology and Chair, Research Ethics Board\n\nTrinity Western University\n\nMerold Westphal\n\nDistinguished Professor of Philosophy\n\nFordham University\n\nHolger Zaborowski\n\nAssistant Professor of Philosophy\n\nCatholic University of America\n\nAbstract\n\nThe project Christian Reasoning examines and seeks to substantiate the intrinsic role religion plays in human existence and public life. In the current dispute whether religion is the problem or the solution to the most pressing global concerns such as terrorism, tribal wars, the social cohesion of Western societies, and the relation between religion and science, reflection on the nature of reason has emerged as the most fundamental issue. In seeking to address this foundational problematic, the proposed research initiative pursues two distinct goals.\n\nThe first goal is to examine and show to what extent religion is constitutive for the very nature of human reason as such. Despite a major shift away from scientific rationalism in academic circles, religion continues to be relegated by many to the private, even irrational sphere of human existence. Against this lingering separation of faith and reason, our first research track focuses on the extent to which human perception, knowledge, understanding, and learning- in short, human reasoning- require the central religious elements of personal relation, tradition and belief. The collaborative philosophical (phenomenological and hermeneutical), social, and empirical research seeks to answer this question in the affirmative by drawing mainly on the Christian tradition but also on different faith traditions (Judaism, Islam, Buddhism).\n\nAssuming a defining role of religion for human reasoning and public life, the second goal of this project us to articulate a specifically Christian understanding of human reasoning in response to current fears that particular religious convictions should be excluded from public life because they inevitably result in conflict and violence. Our research will address the seeming impasse between a recognition of the much publicized “return of religion” on the one hand, and a continuing public fear of religion as bigoted intolerance on the other. More specifically, this research phase will examine:\n\nThe dependency of cultural and religious relativism (i.e. “all religions are the same”) on a rationalist view of truth and the need for a different approach to comparing and assessing particular religions\n\nCompatibility of scientific and religious accounts of human rationality\n\nThe relationship between reason, identity, religion and culture\n\nThe importance of interpretation as intrinsic to any religion’s theological ability to separate church and state\n\nThe relationship between revelation and reason, including the role of sacred texts, tradition and interpretation in the mediation of divine revelation\n\nThe relationship between religious conceptions of law and reason.\n\nReligious Worldview, Ego Identity, and Attachment: Necessary Strengths for Navigating the Challenges of Emerging Adulthood\n\nKaye V.

Flanagan\n\nAssistant Professor, Psychology\n\nWheaton College\n\nKathleen C. Leonard\n\nPost-Doctoral Fellow, Institute for Applied Research in Youth Development\n\nTufts University\n\nChris J. Boyatzis\n\nConsultant\n\nAssociate Professor, Psychology\n\nBucknell University\n\nAbstract\n\nEmerging adulthood is a distinctive era of development. Arnett (2000) has highlighted three areas of unique challenge during emerging adulthood, marked by changes in one’s worldview, sense of self, and relationships with others. We will explore how strengths in these areas help individuals navigate the challenges that accompany a frequent and increasingly common transition of emerging adulthood: graduation from college. Because Christian colleges self-consciously desire to graduate students with coherent religious worldviews that affect one’s entire life, and we can measure their religiosity, we focus on the worldview of those graduating from Christian colleges. We believe that a stable worldview, a solid sense of self, and secure relationships with parents and others in the face of challenges best prepare emerging adults to manage the stresses of this uncertain time. We hope to use this information to contribute to the larger literature on emerging adulthood and to help Christian colleges to nurture and strengthen the faith of their graduates.\n\nThe research will consist of two phases. In Phase I, we will survey 60 graduating seniors and 60 two-year alumni from each of the two Christian colleges, for a total of 240 participants. We will more extensively interview 20 graduating seniors and 20 two-year alumni from each context. In Phase II, we will interview the same participants, using comparable measures, two years later. We thus use cross-sequential analyses to allow us to draw conclusions about development and coping over a four-year period. The data consists of surveys and open-ended questions designed to explore religiosity, sense of self, and relationships with others. Data will be examined by regression analyses using religiosity (intrinsic, extrinsic, quest, perceived similarity with the larger context, perceived faith support, and stability of belief), ego identity status, and attachment measures to predict to our outcome measures, as well as by ANOVA analyses of age differences in the same measures. Outcome measures include participants’ total stress, perceived stress, balance between stress and coping methods, and satisfaction with life and faith. Reponses to open-ended questions will be coded by qualitative analysis.\n\nThe project will result in several outcomes: multiple presentations, multiple research papers submitted for publication or in process, and a book proposal and accompanying request for added funding. In developing the project, particularly since this group of faculty has never worked together, we will also need to convene several team meetings.\n\nA Christian Theoretical Framing for the Concepts of Religion, Spirituality and Culture in Healthcare\n\nBarbara Pesut\n\nProject Director\n\nAssociate Professor and Chair of Nursing\n\nTrinity Western University\n\nBart Cusveller\n\nAssociate Professor of Ethics and Nursing\n\nSchool of Nursing, Christian University Ede (The Netherlands)\n\nMarsha Fowler\n\nProfessor of Ethics and Spirituality\n\nAzusa Pacific University\n\nElizabeth Johnston Taylor\n\nAssociate Professor of Nursing\n\nLoma Linda University\n\nSheryl Reimer-Kirkham\n\nAssociate Professor of Nursing\n\nTrinity Western University\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe purpose of this proposed networking project is to establish a Christian theoretical framing for the concepts and intersections of religion, spirituality and culture with a healthcare context. Issues of spirituality and culture have gained increasing attention in the healthcare literature over the past two decades. However, with this attention has emerged an increasingly politicized debate about the nature of these concepts. Religion and spirituality in particular are being re-defined. Spirituality has become a universal, inherently good, individualized concept while religion has been relegated to external rituals and beliefs, a social product of culture. What has emerged is a healthcare discourse that has produced vague, contentless spirituality, and a marginalized understanding of religion.\n\nThe reframing of these concepts has implications far beyond ideological discourse in the healthcare literature. Practical assessment and intervention frameworks to address spirituality from this perspective are being created and applied within healthcare contexts. Likewise, research instruments created within these understandings are being used to construct a knowledge base upon which healthcare is being shaped. A whole new generation of clinical nurses will be affected by programs and courses in spiritual care based on concepts and methods not necessarily in accord with the Christian worldview. Scholars have suggested that this “new” spirituality, rather than doing justice to the diversity and richness of spiritual perspectives, is having the reverse effect of erasing distinctions and producing an unintended hegemony in healthcare.\n\nIt is important for Christian scholars to respond to this evolving discourse with a Christian theoretical framing of these concepts. We propose bringing together a group of scholars from Canada, the United States, and the Netherlands with significant expertise in spirituality, religion and culture from a healthcare perspective to create this framing. We will do this through a series of meetings where we will first construct the framework and then through a small pilot study seek feedback from the broader Christian academy. This preliminary framework will then be published, but more importantly, will form the theoretical lens for a collaborative research grant proposal for an integrative theoretical work that will explore and analyze these concepts more broadly from the healthcare literature, contrasting them to the Christian theoretical framing. The work of this group will be groundbreaking in that rather than adopting the common approach of focusing on either religion/spirituality or religion/culture, the intersections of all three concepts will be explored, an area of scholarship that is not well developed in the healthcare literature.\n\nThe Forgotten Founders on Church and State\n\nMark Hall\n\nProject Director\n\nHerbert Hoover Distinguished Professor of Political Science\n\nGeorge Fox University\n\nDaniel Dreisbach\n\nProfessor, Department of Justice, Law, and Society\n\nAmerican University\n\nJeffry Morrison\n\nAssociate Professor of Political Science\n\nRegent University\n\nAbstract:\n\nOver the last decade political scientists and historians have come to recognize better the important relationship between religion and politics. With respect to the founding era, they have argued persuasively that religion was far more influential than many twentieth-century scholars understood. Books like Barry Alan Shain’s The Myth of American Individualism: Protestant Origins of American Political Thought have painted a broad picture of how religion impacted the political theory and practices of the founding generation.\n\nBy necessity, scholars like Shain paint with broad strokes. If the role of religion in the founding era is to be more fully understood, students of the era must study individual founders more carefully. To be sucessful, such an examination requires a combination of critical scrutiny and a willingness to take religion seriously. This combination has been too rare among students of the founding. Dreisback, Morrison, and I have each authored such articles and books, and in 2004 we co-edited a collection of essays on the subject entitled The Founders on God and Government.\n\nThe Founders on God and Government focused on well-known figures such as George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson. We now propose to bring together a group of scholars to study less-well-known but still significant founders. We will ask each participant to present a paper on a forgotten founder’s view of the proper relationship between religion and politics at a conference to be held at George Fox University in the spring of 2007. Papers delivered at this conference, as well as two previously published essays and a few additional papers, will be edited by the three applicants and published as a book.\n\nWe believe that this volume will meet an even greater need than The Founders on God and Government. Although students of the era will recognize the names of most of the individuals that we intend to cover, in many cases they know little else about them. As well, many of our proposed papers/chapters will be original works- often the first extended treatement of the profiled founder’s religious convictions and views of church-state relations. Altogether the conference and edited volume will help expand the scope of the discussion about what the founders thought about religion’s place in public life-a conversation that often centers on just two or three individuals.\n\nGood Book and Holy Land: Historical Perspectives on Anglo-American Christians’ Critical Engagement with the Bible and the Middle East\n\nStephen Alter\n\nProject Director\n\nAssociate Professor of History\n\nGordon College\n\nThomas Kidd\n\nAssistant Professor of History\n\nBaylor University\n\nTimothy Larsen\n\nAssociate Professor of Theology\n\nWheaton College\n\nSarah Miglio\n\nDoctoral student, Department of History\n\nNotre Dame University\n\nProject Consultants:\n\nBruce Kuklick\n\nProfessor of History\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\nDavid Livingstone\n\nProfessor of Geography\n\nQueen’s University (Belfast, Northern Ireland)\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe past two centuries have seen steadily increasing interest on the part of British and American Christians in the Middle East. this interest, in turn, has influenced Christians’ self-perception. Critical Bible scholarship, Holy Land exploration, “Near Eastern” archaeology, foreign missions, and imperial diplomacy-these activities have raised the question of Christianity’s identity as a mainly western religion having its historical roots in a far-away region. Was the Land of the Book a source of ancient light and inspiration for modern Christians, or was it the site of Islamic “other,” a major challenge to Christianity as a world religion? This group of research projects has two foci: the history of Anglo-American Bible scholarship and of American perspectives on the Middle East and Islam. The common question is: How have Amerivan and victorian British Christian’s understanding of their faith and of biblical authority interacted with their perceptions of the Holy Land, its religions, and its on-going history?\n\nKant as Moral Realist: A New Interpretive Approach\n\nBenjamin Lipscomb\n\nProject Director\n\nAssistant Professor of Philosophy\n\nHoughton College\n\nKarl Ameriks\n\nMcMahon/Hank Professor of Philosophy\n\nUniversity of Notre Dame\n\nJohn Hare\n\nNoah Porter Professor of Philosophical Theology\n\nYale University\n\nAndrew Chignell\n\nAssistant Professor of Philosophy\n\nCornell University\n\nPatrick Frierson\n\nAssistant Professor of Philosophy\n\nWhitman College\n\nLee Hardy\n\nProfessor of Philosophy\n\nCalvin College\n\nPatrick Kain\n\nAssistant Professor of Philosophy\n\nPurdue University\n\nJames Krueger\n\nAssistant Professor of Philosophy\n\nUniversity of Redlands\n\nHouston Smit\n\nAssistant Professor of Philosophy\n\nUniversity of Arizona\n\nRachel Zuckert\n\nAssistant Professor of Philosophy\n\nRice University\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Current, most popular reading of Kant features a fundamentally anti-realist, constructivist understanding of his moral philosophy (the view being that we create our moral obligations through rational deliberation). This reading poses specific challenges for Christians who find aspects of the Kantian view attrac"
