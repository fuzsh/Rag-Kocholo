It was only four months later when the Board of Trustees of the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School and Junior College District requested me to become the superintendent of the high school and junior college district, business manager of the district and principal of the high school. From that time until my retirement in 1960 I was directly responsible for the college, its progress and its contribution to the junior college needs of Antelope Valley. The school district was large in area but sparse in population in 1934 and for several years afterwards. It spread over 3,476 square miles, bigger than the state of Rhode Island. It had one of the world’s largest school transportation systems. From a very small department of the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School, the Antelope Valley College has grown into the institution it is today, well known and respected not only in California, but in the nation as a whole.\n\nIn relating the events that took place in the growth of the college, it is impossible to include everything or to give credit to all who contributed to its growth. I have drawn heavily upon my memory but I have tried to verify all facts. I have written of the events that I felt would be of interest to those in future years might want to know something of the beginnings of the college. I have not included research material that relates to the growth of the junior college movement. I felt that such material was more adequately presented in the professional college literature than could be incorporated in such a history as I have tried to write.\n\nThe trials, tribulations and successes of the Antelope Valley College in its beginning and throughout its growth parallels great movements in world history and in changes in educational needs. Such events should be considered in reading this history of the Antelope Valley College.\n\nRoy A. Knapp\n\nLancaster, California\n\n1966\n\nChapter I: 1929-1930, The First Year of the Antelope Valley Junior College\n\nThe Antelope Valley Junior College began the first semester of its first year on September 10, 1929. In the Antelope Valley Ledger-Gazette of the same date appeared a brief statement announcing the opening of the junior college. The statement was as follows:\n\nA Junior College course will be opened in connection with the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School. It will offer two years of accredited collegiate work. Claude N. Settles has been appointed Dean.\n\nThis was apparently all that was said in the press about the birth of the new educational institution. The Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District did print a bulletin, dated September 1, 1929, which contained the names of the junior college faculty members, the calendar for the first school year, and an explanation of the college courses to be offered. Evidently the opening of the new junior college attracted little attention from the public and was considered relatively unimportant by most of the high school graduates living in Antelope Valley at the time.\n\nOne report states that 20 students enrolled in the new junior college at the opening of the first school year, although 56 students had graduated from the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School in June 1929. The junior college average daily attendance during its first school year was only 13. Another report indicates that 11 of the beginning students completed the first year and that 12 additional ones spent part of the year in the new junior college. There were no graduates in June 1930.\n\nIn the first Antelope Valley Junior College Bulletin, dated September 1, 1929, a faculty of 12 is listed as follows:\n\nLois M. Bennink Principal Claude N. Settles Dean, Orientation, English, Public Speaking Fred T. Anderson Mathematics and Chemistry George Wm. Bishop Physical Education and Hygiene Ray M. Cunningham Mechanical Drawing Marion B. Durfee Psychology Mrs. Shirley Eyler Art Mary C. Measor Spanish Lucie Morris Stenography and Typing Mildred F. Pitt Physical Education and Hygiene Mrs. Agnes M. Rowell English George W. Zincke Commerce and German\n\nActually there were only 25 instructors on the entire high school and junior college faculty, including the principal, Miss Lois M. Bennink. It is evident that the junior college faculty spent only a small portion of its time teaching in junior college. For example, Mrs. Agnes M. Rowell is listed as a junior college English teacher. Actually Mrs. Rowell taught only one class of junior college English. She also taught two periods of high school algebra, one period of 12th grade English, one period of Latin II, and took charge of a high school study hall. Mrs. Rowell was also senior class adviser and sponsor of the high school Latin Club. Other junior college teachers likewise spent more of their school day teaching in the high school than they did in the junior college.\n\nThe times were favorable for the establishment of a junior college in Antelope Valley in 1929, and the California School Laws made it easy to establish such a college at that time.\n\nEven though conditions were favorable, individual leadership was necessary to take advantage of the favorable conditions. Who furnished that leadership has been difficult to pinpoint.\n\nMr. Maurice H. Rowell was principal of the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School from the spring of 1924 until his untimely death in November 1928. Mr. Paul Hubbard, editor of the Antelope Valley Ledger-Gazette, during the later years of Mr. Rowell’s administration of the high school, stated in a telephone conversation with the writer that he felt sure from his conferences with Mr. Rowell that it was he who envisioned the junior college. It may well be assumed that as early as 1928, Mr. Rowell had laid some groundwork for establishing a junior college in connection with the high school over which he was the school administrator. However, there seem to be no records either to verify or deny that assumption, other than the recollection of Mr. Paul Hubbard, who at the time of this writing still lives in Lancaster.\n\nFollowing the death of Mr. Rowell in November 1928, the Board of Trustees appointed Miss Lois M. Bennink to the principalship formerly held by Mr. Rowell. Miss Bennink had been vice principal under Mr. Rowell and was well qualified to assume the new responsibilities assigned to her. She served as principal of the high school and chief administrative officer of the school district until the end of the school year 1930-31, when she resigned to accept a position as dean of girls at the Santa Barbara State Teachers’ College in Santa Barbara, California.\n\nA letter dated October 7, 1963, to Dr. Roy A. Knapp from Mrs. Peter E. Sharpless (formerly Miss Lois M. Bennink) throws further light upon the ideas and work involved in the beginnings of the Antelope Valley Junior College. Mrs. Sharpless’s letter is duplicated below:\n\nMy dear Dr. Knapp:\n\nA letter just received from Mildred Pitt informs me that you are inquiring about the formation of Antelope Valley Junior College. I fear she gave me more credit that I deserve, for it was the Board’s idea to include a college program on the campus. As I remember, the Board was wholeheartedly behind the idea; but I believe Dr. Savage should be given most credit. You may remember he had four children nearing college age, and he was anxious that they and all other interested students in the Valley might have the opportunity to complete at least two years of college.\n\nIt was then my job to “get going” on the project. Mr. Robert Clinton, our Business Manager, and I visited several junior colleges and from then on, Board, faculty and staff worked together to get it established.\n\nWith best wishes for your success in gathering needed information, I am\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nLois B. Sharpless\n\nMembers of the Board of Trustees during the school year 1929-1930 were:\n\nGeorge G. Hill, President (Roosevelt area) Dr. S.H. Savage, M.D., Clerk (Lancaster area) William J. McAdam (Palmdale area) Grant Shockley (Rosamond area) Joe Maxwell (Lake Hughes area)\n\nThe writer talked by telephone with Grant Shockley in October 1963. Mr. Shockley is the only member of the 1929-1930 Board of Trustees who is still living. His home is in Orange, California. According to his recollection, Dr. Savage was the trustee who pushed for action in establishing a junior college. Mr. Shockley stated that the whole Board of Trustees was in agreement with Dr. Savage, chiefly because certain legislation would soon go into effect that would make it impossible for the school district to establish a junior college in the foreseeable future if it should wait later than 1929 to act.\n\nMr. Robert H. Clinton, business manager of the school district at the time the Antelope Valley Junior College was established, was formerly a member of the school Board of Trustees. At present he resides at Corona Del Mar, California. In November 1963, he called at the home of the writer, and gave his recollections of how the new college happened to be started in September 1929. Mr. Clinton said that while Mr. Rowell probably envisioned a college, the idea really was activated by Dr. Savage and approved by the entire Board of Trustees. He agreed with the letter from Mrs. Sharpless that upon the request of the Trustees, he and Mrs. Sharpless (then Miss Bennink) visited other junior colleges and set up the machinery for the opening of the college. Mr. Clinton also verified the belief that it was a case of starting the college in September 1929 or of being denied that right in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Antelope Valley Joint Union High School annual, the “Yucca”, for the school year 1929-1930 devoted less than a page to the Antelope Valley Junior College. The following is a copy of what appeared in the 1929-1930 “Yucca”:\n\nTHE JUNIOR COLLEGE\n\n(“Would you listen to their boasting”)\n\nPresident Byron Chase Secretary Edith Juday Social Chairman Pearl Nixon\n\nOne more step toward Antelope Valley’s steady progress has been the addition of a junior college with an enrollment of 20 students. Mr. Settles is dean of the college and is assisted by Mr. Zincke, Mrs. Rowell and Mr. Anderson of the teaching staff. During the year the chief events have been a snow trip in January and a party in April. For the fair program Edith Juday, Hazel Kitchen and “Weenie” Holmes presented “Rosalie.” Henry Savage represented Antelope Valley Junior College at the Modesto convention January 12, 1930. Byron Chase and Pearl Nicholson had planned the trip but were literally snowed in by weather which made even the approach to the Ridge impossible. Byron Chase and Edith Juday represented the college at a convention at Compton in April.\n\nStudents who attended the entire first year were:\n\nHazel Kitchen Charlotte Huntington Edith Juday Byron Chase Pearl Nicholson Henry Savage Dorothy Guenther John Whitmore Astrid Olsson Fred Kercher Nellie Brittain\n\nStudents who spent part of the first year in the Junior College were:\n\nPauline Brockett Jasper Kidd Joe Campbell Arthur Leiva Clarence Corse Clara Reese Malcolm Freeman Joseph Weisshaar Della Gookins Glenn Rector William Homes Mildred Olson\n\nThe same issue of the “Yucca” gives an account of the first dean of the junior college and lists his duties:\n\nCLAUDE N. SETTLES – “Who shall guide you and shall teach you”\n\nA.B., M.A. University of Colorado, Wabash College.\n\nVice Principal\n\nJunior College Dean\n\nPublic Speaking\n\nOrientation\n\nBaseball\n\nGymnasium\n\nClass Plays\n\nBoys’ Self Government\n\nDormitory\n\nIt would appear that Mr. Settles, with so many various duties, must have found it difficult to devote as much time to the junior college in its opening year as was needed, or as he must have wished. Possibly that is one reason why he remained with the school district only one year although he was requested to remain longer.\n\nChapter II: National, State and Local Conditions in 1929-1930\n\nThe Antelope Valley Junior College was conceived and born in the closing days of the “Roaring 1920s.” In his campaign for president in 1928, Herbert Hoover said in one of his speeches, “We in America today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land.” Herbert Hoover was elected President and was inaugurated March 4, 1929, six months prior to the opening date of the Antelope Valley Junior College on September 10, 1929.\n\nThe United States had enjoyed about seven years of “Good Times.” The Hoover presidential campaign and his statements and actions during his first six months as President seemed to assure confidence in continued prosperity. The 1920s were called by some “The Jazz Age.” It was a period of reaction to the idealism of World War I years. It was a period of dance marathon contests, flagpole sitting, and raccoon-coated college men.\n\nBy 1927, the Model “T” Ford had been replaced by the Model “A” Ford. The talkies were replacing the silent film. Lindberg made his famous flight from New York to France in that year. The businessman was an object of worship. The masses had visions of becoming materially successful. By 1929, construction had begun on the Empire State Building in New York City. This tallest skyscraper in the world was completed in 1931.\n\nIn 1934, Miss Lucie Morris completed a thesis entitled, “The History of the Town of Lancaster, Center of Antelope Valley”. Copies of this thesis may be obtained either from the Antelope Valley High School library or the Lancaster library. This thesis presents an excellent historic background of Lancaster and Antelope Valley. Pages 38 to 52 of this publication contain much information about the years from 1925 to 1930 and thus outline the conditions in Lancaster and Antelope Valley just prior to the time the Antelope Valley Junior College began in September 1929.\n\nA few excerpts from Miss Morris’s publication will throw light, not only upon Lancaster at that time, but also upon this publication which should be read completely by anyone interested in the history of Lancaster.\n\n“Big changes took place in Antelope Valley from 1915 to 1925. During the years of World War I, the farmers prospered by getting big prices for their produce. This flow of wealth into the valley naturally helped the town of Lancaster … The Mint Canyon Highway was completed in 1921.” (page 38). “About fifteen homes were built in 1925, the same number in 1926, a few more in 1927, and forty in 1928. In the last half of this year and the early part of 1929 took place the biggest building boom Lancaster had seen.” (page 46). “The DuBois Shoe Shop opened in the fall of 1929, the first of its kind in this town. One year later, Ward’s Five and Ten opened its doors. This was another new type of store for this town.” (pages 46-47) “Ford Motors Company built a salesroom, garage and oil station on the northwest corner of Twelfth Street and Antelope Avenue (now Newgrove and Sierra Highway) and opened it for business June 15, 1929.” (page 47)\n\nMiss Morris states further on pages 48 and 49 of her thesis that the number of people in Lancaster in 1920 was 400. In 1923, the population was 500. In 1930, the tabulated figures for Lancaster was 1,550. Between 1925 and 1930, ninety-five and one half miles of paved road were completed in the valley. Lancaster streets were paved during this period also. Beech Avenue was paved in 1927 and 1928. In 1930, Date Avenue was built. Miss Morris’s publication furnishes more information for the reader who wishes to know more about Lancaster and Antelope Valley at or about the time the Antelope Valley Junior College got its start.\n\nDuring the 1920s, education began to be recognized as more necessary for success in the United States than it had been in former times. Between 1920 and 1930 the number of high school graduates in the United States more than doubled. By the mid ‘20s the average boy or girl was beginning to regard a college education as his right. Enrollment in institutions of higher learning almost doubled in this decade. Colleges and universities were beginning to foresee a problem in housing the increasing number of students who wished to enroll.\n\nFar-sighted educational leaders such as Dean Alexis F. Lange, Director of the Department of Education, University of California, and President David Starr Jordan of Stanford University as early as 1907 were beginning to present arguments why the lower two years of college should be handled as secondary education, either as an extension of high school or as a separate two-year institution.\n\nIn an article in Sierra Educational News, November 1907, Dean Lange said, “The first step would be for the University to reduce its swollen fortune in freshmen and sophomores by actively promoting their distribution among federated colleges, normal schools, and six year high schools that are to be and will be... As for the University a number of its most vexing problems would pass out of existence.”\n\nFor a more detailed presentation of the historical development of California junior colleges, reference is made to the California Journal of Secondary, Education, November 1957 issue, pages 391 to 396. A bulletin of, The California State Department of Education, February 1958, also gives an account of junior college development in California. The Appendix of Jesse Parker Bogue’s book, The Community College, presents an excellent account of the influence of Dean Alexis F. Lange upon the development of the junior college.\n\nLeaving complete details to the above-mentioned sources, the writer will refer only to certain changes in California School Law which affected junior colleges in general and Antelope Valley Junior College in particular. In 1907, the first legislation was passed which permitted high school districts in California to offer post high school education. In 1910, a two-year postgraduate course in connection with Fresno High School was established. The name “junior college” was used in connection with this first two-year postgraduate school. No provision for state support was included in the 1907 legislation. By 1916 there were 16 high schools offering post-graduate courses or “junior college” programs in California. They averaged 79 students per school. Insufficient financial support was a factor that handicapped the development of these early junior colleges.\n\nIn 1917, legislation was enacted which helped the junior college movement. In 1921, better financial support laws were passed, but a separate junior college district received more state aid than a junior college organized as part of a high school district. Between 1910 and 1930, junior college departments were organized in connection with 50 high schools in California. Of the 50 junior college departments organized between 1910 and 1930, only 19 survived in that form and were still in operation in 1930. The Antelope Valley Junior College was one of the surviving 19. Ten of the junior colleges which ceased to continue as junior college departments of high school had changed to district junior colleges, primarily because of the more favorable law for such institutions and because of the better financial support from the state.\n\nHad the Antelope Valley Junior College not been established before 1930, it is probable that it might not have been established at all, or at least until many years later. Reactionary legislation was passed in 1929, raising the requirements for establishing junior colleges after July 1, 1930. This was true, whether the junior college was to be a district junior college or a department of the high school. One limiting factor of the new legislation was the raising of the amount of assessed wealth which a district must have before it could establish a junior college.\n\nLess than a month after the opening of the Antelope Valley Junior College, a cartoon appeared in the New York World which showed a large bear running down Wall Street with an investor holding onto his tail in a helpless manner and with his investments flying from his pockets in all directions. Seven weeks after the opening date of the Antelope Valley Junior College came the famous “Black Tuesday,” when over 16,000,000 shares were sold on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThere were those who foresaw the weaknesses in America’s prosperity, but these few so-called “Prophets of Doom” were severely criticized for raising questions about the soundness of our economy. In Antelope Valley, tax delinquencies were mounting. Doubtless, the legislature of 1929 was influenced by a feeling of insecurity when it passed the reactionary legislation affecting junior colleges. All of these factors worked together to cause the Board of Trustees of the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District to act and to establish the Antelope Valley Junior College before it was too late to do so. The college was truly started when the United States and the whole world were on the brink of entering the period now known as “The Great Depression.”\n\nChapter III: The First Five Years of Antelope Valley Junior College\n\nBecause the Antelope Valley Junior College was a department of the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School, conditions which affected the high school district also affected the junior college. The five years (1929-1930 to 1933-1934, inclusive) were years which reached the depths of the “Depression.” The Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District was in financial difficulty. State aid at that time was only $30.00 per unit of ADA (average daily attendance). With the exception of this small amount of state help, the school district was entirely dependent upon property taxes for the rest of its income. The Los Angeles County Assessor cut assessed valuations in the Los Angeles portion of the school district to give relief to the taxpayers. This cut represented a mandatory cut in school income because of the legal tax ceiling on school taxes. Even then tax delinquencies exceeded 40% during part of the five-year period. Expenses for operating the school district were exceeding income, and as a result the school district could not meet many of its bills. Teachers and other employees were paid with tax anticipation warrants which could rarely be cashed for full value. To obtain money upon which to live and meet expenses, employees were forced to find a buyer of the warrants. This necessitated selling them for a discount, which frequently was as high as 15%.\n\nIn June 1931, Miss Lois Bennink resigned as high school principal and chief administrator to accept a position as dean of girls at Santa Barbara State Teachers’ College. Dr. John R. Nichols, who had recently received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Stanford University, was selected to become the new chief administrator of the school district. He took over his duties during the summer of 1931, and remained in this position two and one-half years until he resigned in January 1934 to accept an offer to become executive dean of the Southern Branch of the University of Idaho. Dr. Nicholls term of office was a difficult one. The school district had no recourse to obtain more income. Many unpaid bills accumulated. He was defeated in his efforts to maintain teachers’ salaries. Not only was he well qualified to maintain a good school, but he was especially interested in junior college education. Any efforts which he made to improve standards of education called for more expense. The community reaction made it obligatory that expenses be cut, bills be paid, and taxes be kept within the legal limits.\n\nOf the trustees who were in office when the junior college was formed in 1929, only Grant Shockley and J.O. Maxwell remained on the Board of Trustees as organized on May 1, 1932. In the meantime, Dr. Savage had resigned from the Board, and Harry E. Good, an Eastside rancher, had been appointed to fill the vacancy. The election for trustees in 1932 made an issue of the financial conditions of the high school district. Mr. J. W. Mays and Mr. W. T. Graham were elected to replace the incumbents in a landslide vote. Mr. Mays had been a long-time resident of Antelope Valley. He was an Eastside rancher, but he was also assistant to the Los Angeles County Assessor and, as such, was in charge of assessing property in Antelope Valley. Mr. W. T. Graham was also an Eastside rancher, but he spent the biggest portion of his time as manager of the Antelope Valley Hay Growers’ Association. He was widely known among the alfalfa ranchers in Antelope Valley, and was known by other businessmen for his splendid background of successful business experience. Both Mr. Mays and Mr. Graham were elected on an economy program. The public displayed its confidence in them to make the high school district solvent again without raising taxes.\n\nThe new Board of Trustees took action immediately. They adopted a program which would cut expenses and keep taxes at a minimum consistent with paying off the accumulated unpaid bills. They eliminated the position of business manager, assigning those duties to the chief school administrator, Dr. Nichols. They cut all salaries. Teachers’ salaries were cut 20%. The dormitories, which had been a unique feature of the school district and three classroom buildings on the campus were closed. All shop instruction was eliminated. Music instruction was cut to only one half day. Piano instruction was eliminated. All classes, both high school and junior college, were confined to two buildings.\n\nThe junior college was also affected by these cuts. With the exception of one small room adjoining the gymnasium, it was left with no special place to call its own. This one small room served as the office of the junior college dean and as a classroom for the full schedule of classes which he taught. Other junior college classes had to be held in high school classrooms when not needed by the high school. The junior college had no special study hall, but could use the high school library for that purpose. The one gymnasium of the school campus had to serve both boys and girls of both the high school and junior college. When not in a scheduled class, junior college students had no place to go except out onto the campus, into the halls, or into some vacant classroom if one could be found.\n\nDuring the first five years of Antelope Valley Junior College, there was little increase in enrollment. The ADA, which was 13 the first year, increased to 22 in 1930-1931 and to 26 in 1931-1932. It then decreased to 21 and 22 respectively in 1932-1933 and 1933-1934. It is to the credit of the Board of Trustees and to Dr. Nichols that the junior college survived the cuts of 1932.\n\nThere were no junior college graduates the first year. In 1930-1931, there was only one graduate. The 1931 “Yucca” has the following to say about this first graduate:\n\nThis year we bid good-by to Byron Chase of Acton, congratulating him upon that perseverance which made him the first and only graduate of Antelope Valley Junior College. Byron has been president of his class during his entire freshman year, and during the first semester of this, his sophomore year. Throughout his college and high school days he has been an excellent student. He finished high school as a life member of the honor society with the class of 1929, when he was president of the society.\n\nThere were graduates in both 1932 and 1933 but the record is not clear as to how many or who they were. In June 1934, there were no graduates of the junior college. One year of foreign language was a requirement for junior college graduation, and French was the only foreign language offered in the college. Mrs. Gladys A. Loel, the French teacher, failed all of the students in her class, and thus no one was eligible for graduation in June 1934.\n\nMr. Claude Settles resigned as dean of the junior college at the end of the first year. To take his place, Mr. David J. Roach was chosen. Mr. Roach resigned after serving the junior college for two years. The position was then filled by Mr. John C. Snidecor, who remained for three years, until June 1935.\n\nDr. John R. Nichols, while sparing no efforts to improve standards of education in bath the high school and the junior college, must have felt that his efforts were futile. After the cuts made by the Board of Trustees in May 1932, many bills were not yet paid at the close of the school year. Regardless of teacher pressure and Dr. Nichols’ efforts, the Board of Trustees gave all teachers a second 20% cut in salaries, with the exception that no teacher could be cut to below an annual salary of $1,350.00, the state minimum. This made teachers’ salaries with a minimum of $1,350.00 and with a maximum of $1,593.00. However, the junior college was saved as an institution. In June 1933, the high school student body published a small memory book, instead of the usual annual called the “Yucca”. In his farewell message to the high school students in this book, Dr. Nichols said in part:\n\nWe hope to see many of you again as the years roll on. Some of you will decide to attend junior college here (if it still exists!).\n\nIn September of 1933, the writer (Roy A. Knapp) came to the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School as a physics and mathematics teacher. He had just completed two years of graduate study at Claremont College, Claremont, California. He had come to Claremont from Presho, South Dakota, where he had served several years as Superintendent of Schools. While at Claremont he collaborated with Dr. George W. Hunter in writing several science textbooks. Dr. Hunter and the writer of this Antelope Valley Junior College history, had a science textbook, which they had co-authored, published by the American Book Company. While teaching physics and mathematics in the Antelope Valley High School in the fall of 1933, the writer was preparing a physics textbook for the American Book Company.\n\nIn January 1934, when Dr. Nichols resigned, the Board of Trustees unanimously requested the writer to take over the administration of the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District. In addition to the high school in Lancaster and the Antelope Valley Junior College, there was another high school at Randsburg, California. The writer was asked to be principal of the high school in Lancaster, business manager of the district, as well as superintendent of the entire school district including both high schools and the junior college.\n\nThe writer was well aware of the school problems, the low morale of the teaching staff, the lack of discipline in both the high school and the junior college, the antagonism of the community toward the school, and the many accumulated bills which still remained unpaid. He decided that to meet the challenge meant more to him than to continue with his science textbook writing; thus he accepted the invitation, and assumed his new responsibilities in January 1934.\n\nUpon the same day that the writer became principal of the high school, Mr. Ed Tucker was installed as president of the high school student body. The new student body president and his Board of Control met with the new principal and pledged their support toward helping solve student morale and high school discipline problems in general. The new principal asked the new student body president to address the first teachers’ meeting of the new administration. Much credit is due student leadership for many changes which took place for the better.\n\nAs far as the junior college was concerned, the dean, Mr. Snidecor, gave his full cooperation and outlined many of the junior college problems. Throughout the last semester of the school year 1933-1934, the new administrator received a series of complaints from high school teachers about the conduct of junior college students. A quartette of boys would sing under the windows of high school classrooms while classes were in session. Junior college boys would interfere with high school girls’ physical education activity. At times, severe disciplinary action had to be taken. However, the writer felt that he had fine support from the public, from the student body, and from most of the faculty. It should be said for the junior college students that they had no place to go on the campus between their classes, and therefore, they could hardly help causing disturbances. It was evident that fundamental changes had to be made if the junior college was to survive. Many of those changes could not be made immediately; careful planning for the following year between the junior college dean and the writer ensued. Many unpaid bills still were piled upon the desk of the business manager. The new administrator stayed at his desk until late at night and sometimes into the early morning hours. In the meantime, there is more fact than fiction to be found in the 1934 “Yucca” about the junior college. The following is taken from pages 36 and 37:\n\nAmong the things we’ll always remember, we’re quite positive will be the J. C. Study Hall. (part of high school library). It was our Rendezvous -- a place where lengthy arguments were held, hilarious anecdotes were told, where dates were made and broken -- and usually a place where people left when they wanted to study. ‘Twas here that Romeo and Juliet (Hoyt Wilson and Caryl Peterson to you) came from their southern balcony long enough to announce their engagement; where Tom Chandler always strove to show his scars of battle (or basketball); where Austin Whidden, Byron Meline, and Spud Morton delighted us with ballads, popular songs, and parodies; where Richard Rowell (our president) and Marjorie Johnson could be found talking in low tones; where Linnea Genrich (our vice president) tried to keep order (at times) and peace; where Bill McAdam and Bill Savage held forth with their spectacular “yarns” of college life at Salem, Oregon...\n\nIt was here also, that Ed Guill and Lee Burley dropped in for a few minutes between sets of tennis; Francis Smith showed his ingenuity by climbing through the broken transom into the room when he was locked out; where Betty Fulton came to giggle delightedly at the teasing she received; where Laddie Walters made frantic last minute efforts to plan parties for our benefit; where Frank Thompson came only when the problems of life got heavy and he needed frivolity; where Henry Six stayed when he decided it would be best to ditch class; where Clara Green discussed the problems of Life and Love with serious minded members of our group where Letha Burley tried for weeks to read Darwin’s “Origin of the Species”’ where Mary Jones ate immense amounts of candy meanwhile remarking how terrible it was for her complexion; where Mable Keefe came to gather news for the J. C. column in the “Sandpaper”; where Frank Moreno came only when there were no High School girls available for companions; and where Mrs. Rowell and Mr. Snidecor seldom came except to verify reports from other teachers concerning weird noises that issued from the room occasionally.\n\nChapter IV: 1934-1941, A Period of Growth in Antelope Valley Junior College\n\nIn the school year 1934-1935 the ADA (Average Daily Attendance) of the Antelope Valley Junior College was only 25, but gradually it increased each year up to 1940 1941 when the ADA was 100, Over the seven year period this was a 300% increase. During this period many of the traditions were begun which eventually resulted in further recognition of the college. The ADA of the high school also increased, but only about 52% or from 450 to 684 ADA.\n\nThe school year 1934-1935 began with the first full year’s administration of Superintendent Roy A. Knapp (the writer), and John C. Snidecor, dean of the junior college. During the latter part of the previous year they had surveyed the problems and begun to plot a course which should improve the college. They were still handicapped because in 1934-1935 the assessed wealth of the school was only $9,201,610 compared to an assessed wealth of $13,641,260 when the junior college was begun in 1929-1930. This was the low point of assessed wealth of the district and a loss of approximately 33 1/3%. To make matters worse, the enrollment had increased in both the high school and junior college. This caused the assessed wealth per unit of ADA which had been $38,500 in 1929-1930 to drop to only $18,000 per unit of ADA in 1934 1935. However, the writer and Dean Snidecor were able to convince the Board of Trustees that one of the unused buildings on the campus should be renovated for the junior college. Thus, the junior college began the school year 1934-1935 with facilities much better than ever before.\n\nThe section of the 1935 high school Annual, the “Yucca”, which was devoted to the junior college had the following to say on page 31:\n\nThe Antelope Valley Junior College has just completed one of its most successful years since its inauguration in 1929.\n\nThe year opened finding the junior college located in a building separated entirely from the Antelope Valley High School. This building houses the Dean’s office, a spacious study hall and two classrooms. This move proved favorable to all concerned.\n\nA pass system was drawn up and an honor roll formed in conjunction with it. This honor roll set a “B” scholastic average as a standard for freedom from supervised study; the average being compiled three times during the year. Approximately 20% of the student body was included in this honor roll throughout the term.\n\nThis separate building and the new controls solved many of the college disciplinary problems which existed in former years. Under the capable and tactful leadership of Dean Snidecor, an improved morale was evident in the college and high school graduates began to look more favorably upon attending the college for at least one year.\n\nDuring 1934-1935, the junior college sponsored a matinee performance in the high school Auditorium of the Pasadena Junior College “Bulldog Band,” the official band of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses, and the college basketball team enjoyed a very successful season, in which they won most of their games.\n\nAlthough finances were limited, changes were taking place which led to higher enrollment in each of the next six years.\n\nDuring the spring months of 1934-1935 school year, Mr. Snidecor was offered a teaching position by Dr. John R. Nichols, executive dean of the Southern Branch of the University of Idaho. Dr. Nichols was the former Superintendent of the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District. Mr. Snidecor decided to accept the offer beginning in September 1935. He later received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Iowa and is now head of the Speech Department of the University of California at Santa Barbara.\n\nMr. David J. Roach, who had been dean of the junior college in 1930-1931 and 1931-1932, resigned in June 1932 to obtain his doctorate at the University of Minnesota. It had been three years since he left and he was just back in Los Angeles when Mr. Snidecor resigned in June 1935. Mr. Roach was requested to return as dean of the Antelope Valley Junior College, which position he held until August 1946, a period of 11 years.\n\n1935 and 1936 was the period in history when the United States Supreme Court invalidated President Roosevelt’s NRA (National Recovery Act) and not only gave his program for recovery a stunning setback but also put organized labor in a furious mood over the adverse decision. It was a time when lynchings in the South were in an upsurge. The death of Will Rogers was being universally mourned. The trial of Bruno Hauptman, kidnapper of the Lindberg baby, was holding the attention of the public. In 1935 the Academy Award for the outstanding film of the year was awarded to “”Mutiny on the Bounty.” President Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act and Huey Long, powerful demagogue of Louisiana politics, was shot to death in the State Capitol in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\nThe biggest news story of 1936 was the abdication of King Edward VIII because of his love for a divorced woman, Mrs. Wallis Warfield Simpson. “Gone With The Wind,” by Margaret Mitchell was one of the top-selling novels. The above events in history probably had no effect upon the Antelope Valley Junior College, but they do indicate a few of the news items which made headlines while the college was struggling with the first real period of growth and recognition. However, an event did happen in California which eased the financial burden off schools in general and the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District in particular. Prior to July 1, 1935, the assessed wealth of the public utilities in California was not used for school tax and other local tax purposes. The 1935 Legislature put the public utilities on the local tax rolls, thus increasing the assessed wealth of school districts materially, especially in a district with a great area like the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District, where railroads, power lines and telephone lines covered great distances.\n\nAnother event which also added to the assessed wealth of the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District grew out of an act of the federal government, soon after President Franklin D. Roosevelt was inaugurated, whereby the government increased the price of gold. Prospecting for gold became almost a fever in the Kern County portion of the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District. Although there were many discoveries of gold, the largest one was at the Golden Queen mine near Mojave. The discovery of new mines added new assessed wealth. The Golden Queen mine alone added over $1 million in assessed wealth to the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District in one year. As a result of the increased assessed wealth from the gold mines and the public utilities, the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District increased from the $9,201,610 assessed wealth of 1934-1935 to $16,744,345 in the following school year. This was an increase of over 80% in assessed wealth in one year.\n\nTo prevent schools from increasing their budgets too lavishly with this new source of tax money, the Legislature imposed a 5% limitation on the school budget over the budget of the previous school year.\n\nDuring the school year 1935-1936, Dean Roach continued the improvements started the year before. The junior college section of the 1936 “Yucca” refers to the cooperation and fine spirit among the college students. This publication says:\n\n“Many of the past restrictions concerning study hall, passes and personal freedoms have been done away with. The student’s time and pleasures have depended entirely upon his actions and appreciation of special privileges. The college students are no longer fifth year high school students, but are truly college students. Not only are these students given freedom and responsibility of college life, but are required to do work also of college calibre.”\n\nDuring 1935-1936, the college curriculum was expanded and plans were laid for additional opportunities the following year. Dean Roach, the junior college faculty and the superintendent worked cooperatively to make possible a greater interest in sports and social life. Parties, skating, “weenie” roasts, scavenger hunts and dancing were all sponsored by the junior college. It was during this school year that the first junior college football team was organized. They played only one game, but it was a start. New maroon and white uniforms were purchased for the junior college basketball team and they had one of their best seasons up to date.\n\n1936-1937 was another year of growth, expanded activities, increased curriculum and more social life. Dean Roach and Superintendent Knapp had observed, however, that the majority of high school students did not plan during their high school days to attend Antelope Valley Junior College.\n\nThe writer started a program of five-year planning when students entered the ninth grade and through counselors and teachers changed the neutral attitude toward the junior college to one where high school students planned to attend at least one year of junior college. High school teachers were informed by the superintendent of the high calibre of academic work being done in the junior college and more publicity was presented to the general public. All of these efforts on the part of the school district administration eventually resulted in an increased percentage of the high school graduates attending the Antelope Valley Junior College.\n\nProbably the most outstanding “first” of the school year 1936-1937 was the founding of the Tumbleweed. Prior to this time, the junior college would get some articles in the high school “Sandpaper”. Now, for the first time, the junior college had a publication of its own. Credit should be given to a group of college students who worked hard to produce the publication. Ethlyn Gorsline and Tom Barger were the co-editors. Elizabeth Standiford, now Mrs. Frederick G. Morton, was associate editor, and Homer Rowell was business manager. The first issue of the Tumbleweed was dated December 1936. It was a small six-inch by eight and one-half inch mimeographed publication. It was a literary publication rather than a news magazine. All literary selections were originals by college students. The first page of the first issue was entitled, “Editorially Speaking.” The following is a copy of that first page:\n\nThe staff of The Tumbleweed offers this, the first issue of the magazine, to the junior college and its friends with the feeling that although it is far from perfect it represents an idea that can grow to be a part of college tradition.\n\nTo Mr. Roach, Mr. Knapp, and Mrs. Rowell should go much credit for making this magazine possible. Without their advice and help there would have been no Tumbleweed.\n\nStudent cooperation is extremely necessary. Because there are so few students, everyone will be called upon to help. Short stories, poems, articles, and even comments on timely topics will go far toward making The Tumbleweed a magazine worth publishing.\n\nTHE EDITOR\n\nWith this issue of The Tumbleweed, a new publication is born. Previous to this date, the Antelope Valley Joint Union Junior College has considered itself too small in relationship to the high school, to have many activities of its own. The birth of The Tumbleweed is significant because it indicates the real change in spirit in the Junior College, a change from a spirit of merely putting in one or probably two years in the institution to a spirit of active interest and participation in real college life. From an Administrative standpoint, the change signified by the birth of this publication, is a change which is welcome and one which has long been needed. May The Tumbleweed have a long useful life, and may it stimulate the Junior College to use its ability more actively than has been its custom in the past.\n\nRoy A. Knapp\n\nThe second issue of the Tumbleweed was dated January 1937 and it was edited by Ethlyn Gorsline, who remained the editor until her junior college graduation in June 1938.\n\n1937 was the year of the Spanish Civil War, a time when American volunteers by the hundreds transported themselves to Spain where they joined the Anti Franco armies. May 12, 1937, saw the coronation of King George VI of England, which provided the event for the first worldwide radio broadcast heard in the United States. This was also the year that the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco was dedicated.\n\nThe school year 1937-1938 did not seem to be affected by the unrest in Europe and the war in Spain. The enrollment in the Antelope Valley College jumped approximately 50%. Additional faculty was added to instruct new courses. Many clubs were active. Fifteen basketball games were played with nine being won by the local team. Donald McDonald was one of the players. After World War II he became coach of the Antelope Valley Junior College athletic teams for several years. This was the year that Masao Ekimoto graduated with highest honors as he had done two years before when he graduated from Antelope Valley High School. The following year he went to Tokyo, Japan, for his advance college work but before completing his studies he was caught in the war and was not permitted to return to the United States. He is now married, has a family, still lives in Tokyo and is head of an outstanding public relations firm. He is an uncle of Dennis Ekimoto, who was to become another outstanding academic student in the Antelope Valley High School during the years 1953-1954 to 1957-1958. Dennis was also an outstanding athlete both in high school and in Antelope Valley Junior College.\n\nThe June 1938 issue of the Tumbleweed was the first printed issue. It was a dream “come true,” to Ethlyn Gorsline and her staff. On page 11 of this issue we find the following:\n\nIn Retrospect\n\nIn September 1936, two ex-”Sandpaper” Editors got lonesome for the hubbub and work of school publications and looked around for more work to do. They found what they were looking for when they hit upon the idea of a monthly magazine, and with both Mr. Roach and Mr. Knapp back of them they set about forming a staff and trying to plan the publication. They had hoped to have the literary efforts printed but they soon found that there would not be enough money. The old “Sandpaper” mimeograph and typewriter were pressed into use and the first Tumbleweed went to press. After that initial endeavor one of the editors left A.V. and the students voted the other into his place. Let us pass lightly over the remaining issues of that year and the next, pausing only to reminisce over such incidents as the time when they ran half of the pages upside down, the time the cover paper was cut one inch too short, and the cooperative plan that didn’t work as well as they expected. In September 1937, the staff hoped to have a printed magazine and sorrowed again when the answer came back, “no funds.” In May 1938 at last the dream those two editors envisioned two years ago is to be fulfilled. A printed magazine at last!\n\nMay 1938 saw the first junior college graduating exercise entirely separate from the high school. Prior to this time the junior college graduation was a relatively minor part of the high school commencement program.\n\nThe school year 1938-1939 witnessed another big jump in enrollment. The increase was 80% more than the previous year. Mr. Roach, Mr. Wooton and Mr. Finley were formed into a scholarship committee for the purpose of keeping academic standards high. College scholastic deficiency difficulties were discussed with the students by the committee. Suggestions were offered to the district administration for the improvement of the curriculum. The name of the committee was eventually changed by the students to the “Axe” committee. During this school year, the Tumbleweed was changed from a monthly magazine to a printed newspaper published twice monthly.\n\nThis year the camera group, the literary group, the “Wig and Beard” group and the a cappella choir were started. During this school year the junior college secured a chapter of Alpha Gamma Sigma. The maroon Marauders basketball team won the Desert League.\n\nOn September 1, 1939, German armies invaded Poland without declaration of war and on September 3, Great Britain and France declared war on Germany. Enrollment increased again at Antelope Valley Junior College but by only a small percentage. The world situation was beginning to affect the plans of college-age youth. On November 30, 1939, Russia invaded Finland. When school opened in September 1939, two improvements were completed. A new gymnasium was built to house the boys’ Physical Education Department. The old gymnasium, which had served both boys and girls in both high school and junior college, was now adapted to serve girls only, both high school and college women. The new gymnasium had a full-size basketball floor which was so designed that two practice basketball games might be played at once. This was a decided asset for the junior college.\n\nDuring the school year, another new building was constructed especially for the increased number of college students. This building, still upon the high school campus, has been nicknamed the “Bomb Shelter.” This provided the junior college with two buildings and made it possible to provide a recreation room entirely separate from a study hall. A picture of the new building may be found on page 106 of the 1940 “Yucca”. The following is a quotation from the same page in this issue:\n\nThe Junior College\n\nThe Junior College students can be found either in their new study or their recreation hall. The Junior College consists of two buildings one which was built this year and contains the library and one classroom. There are three rooms in the old J.C. Building and the offices of Dean Roach and Mr. Wooton. One of these rooms is used as a Recreation Hall for the students who come on busses and haven’t any classes in the afternoon.\n\nSome of the Junior College classes are held in some of the classrooms of the High School. They use the new gym for their athletics.\n\nOn January 1, 1940, at the Rose Bowl game, USC defeated Tennessee 14-0. The year before, USC had defeated Duke 7-3. In both of these games an alumnus of the Antelope Valley High School and later a flight training student in Antelope Valley College, Al Krueger, was a major factor in both of these wins for USC.\n\nOn December 6, 1940, a school bus was struck at 90th Street and Avenue “J.” Alverda McCaleb, a junior college student, was a passenger on this bus and was severely injured. Her brother, a high school student, was killed and two other brothers, also high school students escaped uninjured.\n\nIn 1940-1941 the war in Europe was giving signs of breaking out into a world conflict, yet it was still called a “phoney” war. Enrollment in the Antelope Valley College continued to increase, but thus ended a seven-year period of relatively rapid growth. In December 1941, the first semester of the next school year, one of the most tragic events in history took place, the bombing of Pearl Harbor.\n\nChapter V: The World War II Years, 1941-1946\n\nThe period of growth years between 1934 and 1941 came to an end with the school year 1940-1941. The possibility of the United States becoming involved in the war which was raging in Europe caused many boys to enter military service.\n\nOn Sunday, December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. The next day, the United States declared war on Japan and three days later was officially at war with Germany and Italy.\n\nEnrollment at both high school and junior college levels of the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School dropped, but the decrease in enrollment in the junior college was most critical.\n\n1940-1941 the junior college ADA had reached 100. In 1941-1942, it dropped to 53. The enrollment continued to drop for the next three years. In 1942-1943 the ADA was 34, in 1943-1944 it was 14 and in 1944-1945 it was down to 13, the same ADA as the year in which the junior college was organized in 1929-1930. There was a slight turn upward in the enrollment in the school year 1945-1946. This was the year that the Hiroshima atomic bomb was dropped on August 6, 1945, and the unconditional surrender of Japan on August 14, 1945.\n\nThe end of the War in Europe came the prior May 7 when Germany surrendered unconditionally.\n\nThe years between September 1941 and June 1946 were not very exciting years in the Antelope Valley College. Pressures were brought upon the superintendent and the Board of Trustees to discontinue the college as an unneeded educational institution in Antelope Valley and for the purpose of saving tax dollars during the war effort. It took fortitude, understanding and much explanation on the part of the Board of Trustees and the superintendent to keep the college as a functioning educational institution.\n\nThe superintendent, a World War I veteran himself, remembered the increased demand for education following that world conflict. The Board of Trustees were sympathetic to his recommendation that the college be maintained and that a greater need for it would exist following the end of World War II.\n\nTwo other factors helped to keep the junior college from being closed. First, the superintendent pointed out to the community that if the junior college were terminated, that Los Angeles County would then place a junior college tax on the district which would probably be greater than the local tax rate necessary to maintain the college. Second, if the junior college were closed and the demand for a local junior college should occur again following the war’s end, it probably would be impossible in the immediate future to re-establish the college because of legal limitations which still existed. Thus, the college’s life was maintained ready for expansion when the need again existed.\n\nDuring this period of time (5 years) while the future of the junior college was rather discouraging, other incidents happened.\n\nIn the January 8, 1942, issue of the Ledger Gazette appears the picture of Fred T. Anderson, the junior college chemistry teacher, and an account of his mysterious disappearance. From the time that war had been declared upon Japan, Germany and Italy, Mr. Anderson, a bachelor, had appeared worried. He had been a chemist in World War I and seemed to think that he should do something other than teach during the new world conflict. Little was seen of him during the two weeks of Christmas vacation. He was seen on Christmas morning when he drove out to the home of the president of the Board of Trustees, Mr. Grant Shockley. He was later seen in his yard on the afternoon of Christmas Day. Mr. Anderson did not report to school when it opened after the vacation period. Officers from the sheriff’s department opened his home. There were no signs of disturbance but he was not there. A chicken stew was on the stove but the heat had been shut off. His car was in the garage. A rather impossible will was found on the table. To the best of the writer’s knowledge, the mystery of Mr. Anderson’s disappearance has never been solved.\n\nDuring the five-year period covered in this chapter, Mr. David J. Roach continued as dean of the college. In addition to fulfilling his responsibility with the college, Mr. Roach also headed the tire rationing board during the war years. The superintendent headed the Red Cross fund drive, always obtaining the support of the entire community to such an extent that the quota given Antelope Valley was met and exceeded. He also helped to organize the Antelope Valley Civilian Defense Council and was elected president of the Lancaster Kiwanis Club for the year 1941-1942.\n\nThe Angeles Forest Highway was opened in 1941 and the superintendent gave the chief address at the ribbon cutting exercises. These duties of a community and patriotic nature gave him ample opportunity to communicate to the public the need for a junior college in Antelope Valley. Mr. Albert LoBuono came to the school district in December 1941 just before Pearl Harbor. Later he served in the Red Cross for a time but after the war returned to the school district and later became Assistant Superintendent of Schools in Charge of Business for the high school and junior college. At present Mr. LoBuono is in the same position but for the high school district only, after the separation of the two districts.\n\n1941 was also the year when Los Angeles County Superintendent of Schools A. R. Clifton died, thus creating a vacancy which was later filled by Dr. C.C. Trillingham, who at this writing is still Los Angeles County Superintendent of Schools. Dr. Trillingham was always vitally interested in Antelope Valley and was of material help in the growth and development of Antelope Valley Junior College.\n\nShortly after the declaration of war in 1941, 90% of the Antelope Valley Junior College students who remained in school were enrolled in first aid classes. Throughout the five-year period, junior college students often in cooperation with high school students worked upon war projects. The demand for men trained in physical education and mathematics became greater because of military demands. Special opportunities existed for junior college students to obtain a military commission on condition that they satisfactorily completed certain junior college courses in physics, mathematics and pre-flight aviation. At the same time, the supply of adequately trained teachers in these subjects was limited.\n\nMr. Allen K. Dallas, the high school and junior college physics teacher, resigned to enter military service. For a time it appeared that no one could be obtained to fill the vacancy. Finally the writer obtained a young man adequately trained who had been exempt from military service because he was a conscientious objector.\n\nThe schedule was arranged for both high school and junior college physics courses as well as pre-flight aviation courses in the junior college to meet the needs as they were laid out by the Federal Civil Aeronautical Authority in Washington, D.C. It took only a few weeks to learn that Mr. Harbour, the instructor, was unable to control the discipline in his classes. He refused to follow the curriculum. It became necessary to assign new duties to Mr. Harbour and for the superintendent to take over the teaching of the classes. To teach all day, handle administrative duties and carry out necessary community activities became too great a task. Mr. R. R. Maryott, a new teacher on the staff that year, was asked to take over all high school physics classes. The superintendent continued to teach the junior college classes in physics and pre-flight aviation for the rest of the year.\n\nOf the faculty members of the Antelope Valley Junior College at this writing, the only one teaching in the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District in 1942 was Paul Greenlee. Mr. Greenlee came to the district in September 1942 to be a physical education instructor. He had been an outstanding basketball player for Occidental College. After graduation from college, he tried to enter the different branches of military service but each time was rejected because of the very factor which had contributed to making him an outstanding basketball player. His height exceeded 6’ 6”, thus eliminating him from military service. As long as he could not enter military service, Mr. Greenlee felt he could best help his country during the war in the field of physical education and physical fitness. Mr. Greenlee continued as a physical education instructor for three years or until the war was over. At that time he began his career in teaching art and in addition he was for ten years the faculty adviser for the high school annual, the “Yucca”. During these years in the district he not only showed great interest in the school but especially in the junior college. It was in 1955 that he became a full-time junior college instructor. In the 1947 “Yucca”, the following is said in reference to Mr. Greenlee:\n\nMr. Greenlee has introduced many new techniques and ideas which were included in the “Yucca.” The art layout was especially good because of the experience that Mr. Greenlee has had in this field.\n\nAs Advisor to the “Sandpaper” staff, Mr. Greenlee laid out a definite style of writing and succeeded in making the layout of the “Sandpaper” uniform.\n\n1945 was an exciting year for the United States even though the Antelope Valley College was at its low point in enrollment. Americans crossed the Rhine on March 7, 1945. President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945. Hitler committed suicide less than twenty days later and Germany surrendered on May 7. In July, the first atomic bomb fused the earth at Alamogordo, New Mexico. In August, the Hiroshima bomb had been exploded and the war with Japan was over. In the book, “Days to Remember” by John Gunther and Bernard Quint on page 16, is stated the following:\n\nOn the home front, as 1945 merged into 1946, millions of GI’s sought readjustment and reincorporation into the life of their communities. Maybe that old job was waiting for them, and maybe not. Maybe that old girl was waiting for them, or maybe they had forgotten that old girl. Some veterans cracked up, filled the hospitals, and foreshadowed grave problems in public health. Some got married, lifted the birthrate to unprecedented levels, complained at prices, and otherwise had fun, if they were not too disoriented. A prevailing keynote was thirst for education. The GI Bill of Rights opened university doors on a scale never known to the annals of the nation. As an example 11,700 new students entered Harvard in 1946, three quarters of them veterans. Schools were jammed.\n\nNeedless to say the Antelope Valley College would justify its existence once more because of the influx of students. It was anticipated that David J. Roach would continue as dean and instructor at the Antelope Valley College in September 1946. By virtue of his long and valuable experience in the college, he was well equipped to bring about the adjustments in the college for the growth which was expected. However, at a late date in August he announced his intention to enter business and he resigned, thus ending 11 years of association with the junior college. Mr. Roach was probably the man best informed about Antelope Valley College to carry on. The 1946 “Yucca” refers to Mr. Roach as follows:\n\nMr. Roach is the affable, dark gentleman that you see commuting between the J.C. Library and the main office. He is the Dean of the Junior college. On his shoulders fall the duties of suggesting and arranging study programs for J.C.’s. He administers tests for intelligence and occupational interests to the J.C.’s and high school students. He oversees the J.C. teachers and besides all these many and varied duties he teaches Applied Psychology, Clinical Psychology, and Sociology.\n\nMany High School students and Junior College students owe their choice of the right occupation or profession to his wise guidance.\n\nThus ended the five most difficult years of the college.\n\nChapter VI: 1946-1950, The Four Years Between World War II and the Korean Conflict\n\nWorld War II was over. The GI Bill of Rights was in effect. Higher education was in demand more than ever before. Veterans wanted to make up for the war years which had delayed their education.\n\nThe Antelope Valley Junior College experienced the largest enrollment in its previous history in September 1946, over 400% more than September 1945. At the end of the school year 1946-1947, the ADA for the year was 115. The year before the ADA had been only 26.\n\nPrevious to September 1946, the dean of the junior college had devoted only a part of his time to his junior college administrative responsibilities. The remaining time was devoted either to teaching junior college classes or to the duties of the vice principal in the high school office. The dean of the past eleven years, Mr. David J. Roach, resigned his position in August 1946. With the large influx of veterans and with limited classroom space for college classes, it was necessary to obtain a capable replacement for Mr. Roach and to let him devote full time to junior college administrative problems.\n\nThe district superintendent had heard indirectly of a young man in Fort Scott, Kansas, who appeared to be a likely candidate. He proceeded to get in touch with him by telephone. The first conversation sounded favorable; his references were excellent, and with the approval of the Board of Trustees, the superintendent arranged for Mr. Walter Dingus to come to Antelope Valley and assume the deanship of the Antelope Valley Junior College on September 1.\n\nAt the end of 1946-1947, the junior college section of the “Yucca” said of Mr. Dingus:\n\nWalter Dingus, after only a year with A.V., has already established himself as a capable dean and teacher for the J.C. and as a good friend to the students. Mr. Dingus came to the valley with an excellent record and a good background for the deanship, having graduated from a J.C. himself and then continuing on to Ottawa and Kansas universities. During the war he was commissioned and served in the Navy, returning to the deanship of Fort Scott J.C. in Kansas. This year as dean of A.V.J.C. he has instituted student government, worked with the Veterans Administration to insure all their rights, and worked for a larger selection of courses. His interest has resulted in many improvements, thus giving the valley a better junior college than it has ever before had and making a place for himself in the lives of every junior college student.\n\nMr. Dingus proved to be a fortunate find, not only for Antelope Valley Junior College, but for Antelope Valley High School and later for the San Marino Unified School District in San Marino, California, where he is now superintendent of schools.\n\nDave Batz was elected junior college student body president for the first semester of the 1946-1947 school year. In his term in office he predicted:\n\nOur plans for a bigger and better junior college are materializing. I feel that if in the future, as in the past, the two student bodies continue to work together it will help to improve both the junior college and the high school.\n\nKeith Hayden was junior college student body president for the second semester and he also expressed the enthusiasm and spirit of the college in 1946-1947 by saying:\n\nWe now have the opportunity to change our potentialities into realities. Let’s not falter.\n\nThis was the year that Mr. Gus Eliopulos became a member of the Board of Trustees of the school district. Mr. Eliopulos replaced Mr. Joe Maxwell, who had resigned because of ill health. Mr. Eliopulos, a Westside rancher, was a former Antelope Valley junior college student. He continued to serve on the Board of Trustees for the remaining years that the junior college and high school existed as one district and then remained on the high school Board of Trustees of which he is still a member.\n\nWith the sudden increased growth of the junior college, the need became more urgent to have more college classrooms, more opportunity for vocational training, and eventually to have the college on a separate campus. As both the junior college and the high school enrollment increased, many problems developed while both institutions were on one campus. For example, the Educational Code prohibited smoking in both the high school and junior college when they were both on the same campus. While most of the returned GI’s were in the college, there were many veterans completing their high school classes. When all were on the same campus, using many of the same classrooms and mixing in the same general campus area, it presented a difficult problem to abide by the smoking regulation of the Educational Code and at the same time have the understanding, and cooperation, of veterans who had become accustomed to a more free use of their off-duty time.\n\nIt was in 1946-1947 that Mrs. Madeline Gwinner joined the teaching staff of the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District. Mrs. Gwinner (now Mrs. Madeline Chapman) was a commercial teacher in the high school and the junior college. At present, she has the second longest term of office on the junior college faculty. Mrs. Chapman has proved to be one of the outstanding leaders for the improvement of junior college instruction, good relations between faculty and students, and public relations in general.\n\nThe assessed wealth of the school district was only $22,182,710 in 1946-1947 and the maximum tax rate established by a Legislative Act was limited to $1 per $100 of assessed wealth. Though the maximum was computed on the maximum of 75¢ for high school purposes and 25¢ for junior college purposes, the entire $1 rate could be spent on either institution in any proportion that the Board of Trustees might determine.\n\nIn 1946-1947, there were almost ten high school students to be educated for each junior college student. Salaries of instructors of both high school and junior college were low. The state Legislature refused to increase the maximum tax rate that could be levied without an election.\n\nAt about this date, the Mojave and Muroc elementary districts in the Kern County portion of the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District were agitating for separation so they might establish a high school district of their own. Naturally they opposed a bond election because they wanted to keep their full bonding capacity for the time when they might be separated and could build their own high school. As a result, an election was called in the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School for July 18, 1947, to obtain permission to increase the maximum operating tax rate from $1 to $1.25 per $100 of assessed wealth and for a five-year period. The election was successfully carried.\n\nThe extra 25¢ tax rate plus an increase of approximately $3,500,000 in assessed wealth made it possible during the school year 1947-1948 to improve salaries, make needed additions to the staff, and construct additional classrooms. Four buildings originally designed for military use were obtained by the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District. The buildings had been designated as “war surplus” and were made available to provide classrooms for increased junior college enrollment. Two Quonset buildings were also purchased and erected for shop instruction. In the Quonset building designated for junior college shop was placed about $30,000 worth of surplus shop equipment. Thus, for the first time, the college was enabled to offer courses in metal and wood shop.\n\nThe Board of Trustees reorganized the administrative duties of the school district. The writer, who had served as principal of the high school as well as superintendent of the high school and junior college, was assigned the duties of the district superintendent full time. The responsibilities of the high school principal were assigned to Mr. Walter Dingus, who was also to retain his junior college deanship duties. To assist Mr. Dingus with his junior college administrative work was assigned Mr. Frank Flemming, a junior college mathematics teacher, to be assistant dean of the college.\n\nIt was during the school year 1947-1948 that Mr. Henry Wells, Mr. Warren Nunn and Miss Evelyn Foley first came to the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District. All three are still on the junior college faculty. Mr.\n\nWells and Miss Foley were both assigned a full load of junior college teaching from the beginning. Mr. Nunn devoted his full time to high school teaching, but later he was transferred to the junior college full time.\n\nOn October 3, 1947, Mays Field was dedicated. Mr. J. W. Mays served on the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District Board of Trustees from 1933 until his death in 1947. Mr. Mays had always shown a special interest in athletics. He was interested in developing a good playing field for football. The field was appropriately named “Mays Field” in memory of Mr. J. W. Mays. The completion of Mays Field, while the old Hooper Field was still in use for practice, made it possible for the junior college to field a football team. Donald McDonald, a former junior college student and a World War II pilot, was selected to coach junior college football and other junior college sports. The 1948 “Yucca” had the following to say about junior college football:\n\nThe re-establishment of an athletic program in the junior college this year not only boosted the enrollment, but stimulated the interest of the community. Besides these two resulting factors, good sportsmanship, renewed school interest, physical development, self-confidence and reliance were all the results of the athletic program.\n\nThe Maroon Marauders were not an outstanding football team, but at no time did they encounter a team that displayed better sportsmanship, before and after the game. The Marauders, in competition for the first time in over six years, faced a tough schedule. Several of the teams encountered placed on or near the top in their leagues. Defeat by a superior team is no disgrace.\n\nThe jaysees were plagued by injuries throughout the entire season. The first serious injury of the season was inflicted against Bud Winkle in the Oceanside game. Bud, who was an outstanding lineman, received a broken arm which sidelined him for the remainder of the season. Dave Batz held out until the Bakersfield game. He then became the victim of a rough block which broke his right leg. These two were probably the worst injuries, but many other Marauders were out from time to time.\n\nAt the end of the season the football squad met for the purpose of electing a captain. After a short discussion it was decided that co-captains would be selected. The two men elected proved to be Johnny Lizarraga, left half, and Sheldon Krave, full, both terrific ball players.\n\nThe last official act of the season was enacted by Coach McDonald, who made out blanket orders for letters that included the entire squad.\n\nMany thanks should go to the coaches, who, by their drive and interest, made the season a success. Bouquets should also be handed out to the teachers, who took care of the gates and to the publicity staff, who made the valley conscious of our team. Last and by no means least, the townspeople who turned out for the games, deserve a lot of thanks, for support helps a lot.\n\nNext year will be a bigger and better year and each year after that will increase the stature of A.V. athletic teams.\n\nFor the first time in the college’s history the Maroon Marauders fielded a track team. The Marauders also played eight college basketball games.\n\nMiss Evelyn Foley gave instruction in journalism and news editing, two new courses offered to junior college students.\n\nDuring the school year 1948-49, the junior college student body decided to produce an annual of their own rather than depend upon a few pages in the high school annual, the “Yucca.” A contest was held to select a name. A newspaper account on March 7, 1949, said:\n\nEl Scimitar was the name chosen for the J.C. Annual at the student body meeting on December 17. The winning name was submitted by Don Turndrup, the past JC president. The cost of the El Scimitar is to be $2.75 without student body cards and free with student body cards.\n\nA Forum Committee was established with the aid of the superintendent and Mr. Henry Wells was made faculty adviser. An outstanding array of nationally known speakers was brought to Antelope Valley for a forum series. This committee of junior college students made it possible for the citizens of Antelope Valley to hear such nationally known men as Alonzo Baker, John Baird and Lewis Browne.\n\nAs a whole, the school year 1947-1948 proved to be a turning point in the history of the Antelope Valley Junior College. It was the year which saw not only increased growth but also accelerated enthusiasm and progress.\n\nEnrollment continued to increase in the college from 1946-1947 through 1949-1950. The ADA at the end of each year was as follows:\n\n1946-1947 115 1947-1948 132 1948-1949 183 1949-1950 218\n\nThese were years when a battle was being fought in Sacramento to increase the amount of money which the state would provide for education and for a new method of distribution of that money so that poorer districts would obtain more per ADA from the state than the more wealthy districts and when school districts with necessary heavy transportation costs would be given special reimbursement to help them with those extra costs.\n\nThe superintendent of the district was one of the leaders who helped work out a method for reimbursing districts with heavy transportation costs. He also helped persuade the Legislature to increase the maximum tax rate from $1 to $1.10 per $100 assessed wealth for school districts maintaining both a high school and a junior college. As a result of his successful leadership, at the state level, he was chosen as the one superintendent in California to represent the state in the Administrative Conference at Columbia University at New York City held during the summer of 1949.\n\nOn July 1, 1950, the Mojave and Muroc elementary school districts were officially withdrawn from the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District. This action removed one of the hurdles to voting bonds for more school buildings. A $750,000 bond election was called for April 27, 1950 and it carried by a large majority. This made it possible to make longtime building plans for both the high school and junior college and to have the assurance that these plans could be carried to conclusion.\n\nIt was during this four-year period (1946-1947 to 1949-1950) that there were three deaths of existing and former school trustees. Mr. Joe Maxwell, who had served many years and who had earlier resigned because of ill health, passed away August 21, 1950. As indicated earlier, Mr. Maxwell’s vacancy was filled by Mr. Gus Eliopulos. Mr. Wallace Ward became a school board member to fill the vacancy left by the death of Mr. J. W. Mays, and Mr. Dean Lemon was appointed to fill a vacancy caused by the death of Mr. Clifford Burton. Because Mr. Lemon was from part of the area (Boron) which withdrew to form a new district, he resigned to be replaced by Mr. George McNamee of Rosamond who served until 1960.\n\nThe junior college seemed to be assured of community acceptance and a future for the first time in its history. School spirit was high, participation in sports was active, financial limitations of the past were at least changed for the better. The curriculum had been broadened to meet the needs of more students. Veterans were taking advantage of their educational opportunities provided by the junior college and the GI Bill of Rights. Hope and enthusiasm were in the air. After 20 years, the junior college was at least on its way.\n\nBut international tensions and war inversely affect college enrollment. On June 25, 1950, powerful and carefully prepared units of the communist North Korean army broke over the 38th parallel and crashed into the territory of the Republic of Korea.\n\nThis action was to affect the enrollment and progress of the Antelope Valley Junior College for the next three years.\n\nChapter VII: The Three Years of the Korean Conflict, 1950-1953\n\nUnited States’ intervention in the Korean conflict covered the time from June 25, 1950 to July 27, 1953. Many World War II veterans were called back into military service and many younger non-veterans enlisted. Although the early months of the Korean conflict indicated that the duration would be short, the war lasted over three years. In October 1950, General Douglas MacArthur predicted that enemy resistance would end by Thanksgiving Day and that the American 8th Army could be withdrawn to Japan by Christmas. However, in the meantime the Chinese communists entered the war and General MacArthur’s prediction did not materialize.\n\nFollowing a four-year period of increasing enrollment in Antelope Valley Junior College, the enrollment dropped during the three-year period of the Korean conflict. Compared to an ADA of 218 in the school year 1949-1950 the ADA dropped in the following three years as follows:\n\n1950-1951 209 1951-1952 188 1952-1953 182\n\nThe drop in enrollment was not great, but it was enough to put a damper on many of the college activities which had been gaining momentum during the years 1946 to 1950.\n\nFootball, which had only been started three years before, was hardest hit. The size of the college did not permit much depth in a football team at best. The able coaching of Donald McDonald and the fine leadership of department Head Coach Ward (Rusty) Myers had built the prospects of a strong team as the college grew in enrollment. The prospective growth in the immediate future was shattered by the Korean conflict and its demand for young men of college age. During the 1950-1951 school year, Coach Myers was ordered back into active service in the United States Naval Reserve. Coach McDonald lost many of his seasoned players. During the football season a report in the Valley Press of October 26, 1950, says:\n\nAntelope Valley Junior College lost a sizeable hunk of its masculine public this week as ten students left the Junior College in favor of the Armed Forces. All are of draft age. Hardest hit of all campus groups by the mass departure is the junior college football squad which loses six first-string players and an Assistant Coach, Ronnie Ritchie.\n\nIn spite of this loss of players, the remaining team members voted to finish the football schedule even though they knew the odds were all against them.\n\nRay McFarland, sports editor for the Antelope Valley Independent, wrote the following in the October 27, 1950 issue:\n\nIt takes a lot of guts to do what the junior college football team did this week in voting to continue what can well be termed a suicide schedule of gridiron contests.\n\nThis column wants to dedicate this edition of the Independent SPORTS to the entire Maroon Marauders team for their sportsmanship in taking this action. To date the Marauders have not won a game. In fact they have not scored a single point in any of their games, while their opposition has rolled up a total of 169 points. Starting out with a small squad, injuries and drop outs have reduced the number of players suiting up to less than two full teams with many of the players never having been in a football uniform before this season. A number of players have played 40 and 50 minutes each game without complaint and without giving up. Although hopelessly outclassed in a number of their games they continued to fight every minute of the time. I am mighty proud of our Jaysee football team. I am proud of the boys and I am proud of Coach McDonald for carrying on as he has.\n\nNeedless to say, no football schedule was approved for the school year 1951-1952. However, the spirit shown by the members of the football team was indicative of the spirit shown by the college as a whole. Activities were curtailed but not more than absolutely necessary. The curriculum offerings were maintained and even expanded in some cases.\n\n1951 was a year when fear of war reached its highest peak. Senator Joseph McCarthy was busy slambanging the State Department. Loyalty oaths were required by law of all school employees and other public officials. Superintendent of Schools Goslin of Pasadena, California, was dismissed, thus adding to the campaign of criticism against public school personnel. Julian Beck, assemblyman representing Antelope Valley, was up for election following many years in which he gave his support to better financial assistance from the state to public schools. He won the election by a small margin against an onslaught of campaign propaganda that he was communistically inclined.\n\nAt about this same time, the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation was contemplating a contract with Los Angeles County to move its testing facility to the Palmdale Airport. The successful culmination of the contract was a forerunner to the establishment of Plant 42 in Antelope Valley and the consequent movement of other aircraft companies to the valley, contributing to the population boom that followed.\n\nIt was during the school year 1950-1951 that Charles Parker became a part of the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School faculty. He served as high school teacher, activities director and assistant superintendent of schools before he requested an assignment to the junior college teaching staff. It was also during 1950-1951 that “Bob” McCutcheon joined the coaching staff of the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District. “Shouting Bob,” as he was later called, was to become an outstanding coach and a controversial figure in football when it was again reinstated in Antelope Valley Junior College.\n\nAt the end of the 1951-1952 school year, Mr. Walter Dingus resigned his position of high school principal and junior college dean to accept the principalship of the newly organized San Marino High School in San Marino, California. Later Mr. Dingus was promoted to superintendent of the San Marino Unified School District, which position he still holds.\n\nDr. Robert Dougherty was elected to fill the vacancy left by Mr. Dingus’s resignation but because of administrative reorganization Mr. Frank Fleming was given the full-time deanship of the junior college. Mr. Fleming had been assistant dean of the college under Mr. Dingus and at the time of his resignation Mr. Dingus had recommended that the responsibilities of the junior college dean really called for a full-time man to serve as director.\n\nThe 1952-1953 El Scimitar pictures both Mr. Frank Fleming and Miss Evelyn Foley. The following statement is included about Mr. Fleming:\n\nThis year the administration of the junior college was separated from that of the high school and Mr. Frank Fleming, who has been Dean of Men for three years, has been appointed to fill that position.\n\nThe same issue of El Scimitar says of Miss Foley:\n\nAs Dean of Women Evelyn Foley serves as an understanding adviser when the girls need help. She sponsors the Associated Women students. Miss Foley teaches English, Modern Literature and Introduction to Education at Antelope Valley College.\n\nIn Mr. Fleming’s first year as Director of Antelope Valley Junior College, he reinstated football, and Bob McCutcheon was made junior college football coach.\n\nThe August 14, 1952, Ledger Gazette carried a story, part of which is quoted below:\n\nUndertaking one of the toughest football schedules in the history of the school will be a job this year of the Antelope Valley Junior College Marauders. After a one year layoff from the sport, the junior college will field a virtually untried team...”\n\nNevertheless junior college Coach McCutcheon is optimistic in his outlook for junior college sports this year.\n\nMr. McCutcheon did not depend entirely upon local boys to build a football team but obtained many young men from non-junior college territory in California. Mr. Fleming and Mr. McCutcheon put on a campaign among Lancaster businessmen to provide jobs for athletes. The August 14, 1952 Ledger Gazette reports as follows:\n\nCoach Bob McCutcheon says he is expecting more than 15 athletes to report to Antelope Valley Junior College this year from communities outside of Antelope Valley who will need part-time jobs to help them attend school here.\n\nThe junior college coach predicts that if the Antelope Valley Junior College is ever going to have an outstanding football team, this year will be a stepping stone to that goal.\n\nBob McCutcheon, assisted by Warren Nunn, coached the college football team through a very successful season scoring 238 points to the opponent’s 80. Mr. McCutcheon also coached the junior college basketball team to the South Central College championship. The 1952-1953 El Scimitar was dedicated to Mr. McCutcheon in recognition of the outstanding football and basketball teams which he coached. The El Scimitar wrote:\n\nWithout the enthusiasm and interest shown by Coach McCutcheon, the teams could never have finished each season with such a successful record.\n\nIt should be noted that the sudden success of the athletic teams in the last year of the Korean conflict and in spite of low enrollment attracted much attention to the junior college and stimulated both enrollment and interest in athletics in the following years. It should also be noted that the enthusiasm aroused by Bob McCutcheon’s successful coaching ultimately led to problems in Antelope Valley Junior College.\n\nChapter VIII: Growth, Football and Accreditation\n\nThe four years following the end of the Korean conflict brought growth to the Antelope Valley Junior College. By the end of the school year 1956-1957, the ADA of the college had increased three times over that of 1952-1953.\n\nIt was during this period of time that many of the present faculty members of the junior college first became members of the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District faculty. Gladys Baird, Gail Newkirk and Gordon Clifgard were teachers in the college from the time of their first employment. Bruce Cohen, James Kelly, Selmer Westby and Warren Houghton were teachers in the high school part or all of their time prior to full-time permanent assignment to the junior college. Jack Held did not join the college staff until 1961. Between December 1956 and 1961 he taught speech and drama in the high school. James Kelly taught in both the high school in Lancaster and the Palmdale High School prior to permanent assignment in the college in 1961.\n\nThe years 1953-54 to 1956-57 witnessed an increased athletic program which attracted statewide and nationwide attention in junior college circles. The athletic program almost became the complete undoing of the Antelope Valley Junior College because of over emphasis in relation to the rest of the college program.\n\nPrior to 1956, accreditation of Antelope Valley Junior College had never been questioned. The State Department of Education was the accrediting agency until 1956 when future accreditation would be dependent upon the Commission and Standards of the Western College Association. The report of the first visiting committee of the Western College Association resulted in a loss of accreditation of the Antelope Valley Junior College as of the end of the academic year June 30, 1957.\n\nDuring this four-year period, the enrollment of the Antelope Valley Joint Union High School District and Junior College increased from a total of 1,615 in 1952-1953 to an ADA of 3,434 in 1956-1957. With the exception of about 50 students at the Randsburg High School, all of these students had to be housed upon the one campus in Lancaster. There were no adequate library facilities for the junior college. Temporary classrooms were constructed on the high school campus. The fairgrounds were used for ninth grade classes. Classrooms and gymnasium space for the college had to be shared with the high school. All of these conditions existed at the end of the school year ending June 1956.\n\nIn February of 1955, the Board of Trustees purchased ten acres of land from Mr. R. D. Robertson and sometime later twenty acres from Benjamin Carter. The location of this 30 acres is between 3rd Street East and 5th Street East and between Avenue I and Kettering Street. The 30 acres included all of the 40 acres bounded above except the northwest ten acres. The idea of the purchase was to provide a separate junior college campus at the earliest possible time. After the purchase, the State Schoolhouse Planning Commission decided that 30 acres was inadequate for a permanent junior college site, but granted permission for it to be used as a site for temporary buildings until a new and better site could be purchased and buildings constructed.\n\nThe school district passed a $4 million bond election on May 18, 1956, and received authorization to accept another $4 million in state aid. The new temporary site could not be made ready for the move of the junior college until the opening of the school year 1956-1957. During the summer of 1956, the temporary buildings on the old campus of the high school and junior college were moved from the high school site to the new temporary junior college site. Unfortunately the move to the new site had just been completed when the first committee of the Commission for Accreditation of Junior Colleges made its visit to the Antelope Valley Junior College.\n\nDuring the four years (1953-1954 to 1956-1957) inclusive, the curriculum was expanded. With John Meyer as student body president and Pat Gary as instructor, the California Young Farmers Association was active on the campus.\n\nUnder the sponsorship of Robert O. Hahn, the Future Teachers Association held regular meetings and stimulated many superior students to enter teaching. Mr. Hahn also sponsored the “Stage Coachers,” a drama club for any college student who wished to participate in dramatics. The curriculum was expanded as far as facilities would permit to meet the needs of the students. Academic standards were raised. Alpha Iota, the Antelope Valley Junior College chapter of Alpha Gamma Sigma (founded in 1939) was active and graduating students received more than the normal share of statewide honors. College graduates who attended the University of California maintained high grade point standards. The El Scimitar staff and the Tumbleweed staff produced excellent publications. The 1953-1954 El Scimitar was dedicated to Frank J. Fleming, director of the college. The dedication statement says:\n\nWe the members of the El Scimitar staff dedicate this yearbook to the one person who has done the most to further the interest and welfare of the junior college.\n\nMany other student activities were back in full stride again as the year 1953-1954 progressed. However, in spite of all of these activities and the high calibre of class work, athletics seemed to take the spotlight of attention. Director Fleming appeared before community meetings to help stimulate interest in the college. The community, as a whole, seemed to pay more attention to the college men’s athletics than the other activities, even more than to the academic standards of the college. Athletics was emphasized by Director Fleming to further stimulate interest in the junior college. In 1955-1956, the El Scimitar reflected the over emphasis upon athletics in relation to the whole junior college. About 25% of the publication was devoted to football, 36% of the book was devoted to boys’ athletics. 50% of the annual was devoted to both boys’ and girls’ athletics and physical education.\n\nWith the small enrollment of 1952-1953, th"
