        "text": "1960s Overview\n\n[From the 1969 OWL] For the University of Pittsburgh, the 1960s played out a now familiar narrative of protest and confrontation—and the unrest on campus took place in the context of unpredictable changes in administration.\n\nIn 1961, Robert Colodny, Associate Professor of History, was denounced as a communist by the Pittsburgh Press. The publicity produced investigations by the Pennsylvania State Legislature, the U.S. House Committee on Un-American Activities, and the AAUP. (Chancellor Litchfield defended Colodny and defended the basic principle of academic freedom.)\n\nThroughout the 1960s, the university was struggling to meet its expenses, expenses incurred by Litchfield’s ambitious plans to raise the profile of the institution. According to Robert C. Alberts (Pitt: The Story of the University of Pittsburgh, 1787-1987), between 1957 and 1965 Litchfield doubled the size of the faculty and doubled faculty salaries. However, in the face of serious questions concerning the university’s financial stability, in August of 1966 the administration negotiated an agreement with Harrisburg that brought financial assistance in return for Pitt’s new status as a “state-related” institution. Some assumed that this would bring in large numbers of poorly prepared students and drive away newly recruited senior faculty.\n\nIn 1965, Litchfield had a heart attack. With his health in question and the financial crisis before him, he resigned his position. (He would die in a plane crash in 1968.) Litchfield was followed by Stanton Crawford, the University’s 13th Chancellor, and David Kurtzman, the 14th, each serving for only one year. (When Crawford died of a heart attack, Kurtzman was named Acting Chancellor. He was then named Chancellor to span the gap until the arrival of Wesley Posvar.)\n\nIn June, 1967, Wesley Posvar became the University’s 15th Chancellor. In January, 1969, the Black Action society occupied his office. In February, 1969, 800 students and faculty staged a demonstration in the Commons Room demanding, among other things, free speech, the removal of ROTC from campus, a revised curriculum, new forms of assessment, freedom from surveillance, and increased attention to the rights of women and minorities. In March of 1969, 350 students and faculty again occupied the Commons Room of the Cathedral, this time for three days.\n\nThe English department occupied all sides of every debate. In retrospect, however, the most important and decisive thing to note about the English department in the 1960s was the striking growth of the graduate program. In the 1940s, the English department granted 21 PhDs; in the 1950s, 26; and in the 1960s, 89. This growth was planned and supported by new faculty lines, including Mellon Professorships, and by new Mellon fellowships for graduate students. It was part of a push to raise the research profile of the department (and the institution). Since the 1920s, the department had defined itself in terms of teaching and service. Now it had to begin to think differently.\n\nRather than write an extended overview, we thought it would be appropriate to invite memories from colleagues who were there, part of the department in the 1960s.\n\n[From the 1969 OWL]\n\nFrom Robert Gale\n\nWith Dartmouth BA and Columbia MA and PhD, I was hired by London-born Dr. George Crouch, English department chairman, after an MLA interview in New York. My family and I arrived August 1959. Welcoming me were Charles Crow (Shakespeare), Montgomery Culver (writing), Ford Curtis (drama), Arthur Fidele (Irish literature; associate of Charles Peake), Emily Irvine (literature), Putnam Jones (dean), Lawrence Lee (poetry), Abe Laufe (American drama; Peterson’s associate), Edward Litchfield (brilliant, highly sociable chancellor; his wife loved mine), Ed Peterson (composition), Richard Tobias (Victorian), Donald Tritschler (American), and Ralph Ware (American). Slight trouble started, and persisted a while: I learned through Crow that though he admired me sufficiently, Crouch hadn’t consulted anyone before hiring me (starting pay $5,700). Ware died in 1961. Crouch needed another Americanist, soon hired Tom Philbrick (1963?). The relatively small department socialized well, had cocktail parties, picnics, Christmas parties. There was probably too much drinking. In due time, my wife helped newcomers find housing. WWII veterans in the department were Evert, Fidele, Laufe, Lee, Markman, Tobias, Whitman, and my wife and I. Department divorces shook social amiability somewhat.\n\nCrouch was notorious for saving Pitt money, not helping us get substantial raises. He hired Jim Simmonds (17th century), uniquely paid him a year when he was stuck back in Australia. Later 1960s chairmen were Fred Mayer (1966-1967) and Bob Whitman (from 1967; drama). Mayer hired Jim Knapp (1966). Frank Wadsworth, dean, domineered the department; Mayer couldn’t even quote salary to Knapp. Wadsworth brought Walt Evert (Romanticist, Bible; associate dean). Whitman hired Marcia Landy (Milton, film), Cynthia Matlack (18th century), Chris Rawson (drama), Bill Searle (American); Ray Lee Siporin; Whitman was sometimes speedy, asking little committee input. During Whitman’s absence, to accompany his wife to Washington, D.C., Evert was acting chairman.\n\nA big feature of the 1960s was the requirement that each MA candidate had to write a thesis. I directed 23. It was soon thought such thesis writing cost too great a percentage of student time. I was asked to introduce new American lit courses, initiated (1960s and later) Hawthorne, Melville, James, Twain, and Naturalism seminars, and undergraduate courses in Civil War lit, Roaring Twenties lit, and Western lit. When Philbrick asked me if he could take over my Melville seminar, I agreed courteously. He knew sea fiction better than I did. Whitman made me the department’s first graduate studies director (1967-1973), with no secretary and no committee. I made decisions on applicants, sent recommendations to Evert (Wadsworth’s assistant dean); he usually agreed, sometimes over-rode rationally. The best of the 39 students whose PhD dissertations I directed, starting in the 1960s, were Ronald Emerick (Indiana PA), Edward Grejda (late of Clarion), Raj Kumar Gupta (India), James Haines (Point Park), Granville Jones (late of CMU), Fred Koloc (late of Pitt), Janet McCann (Texas A&M), Bob Papinchak (didn’t get tenure and went to Boise State), Irving Rothman (Houston), and James Watson (late of Tulsa).\n\nFrom Richard Tobias\n\nWhen we first heard about the Mellon professorships, I sat through weary sessions of faculty complaint. Probably no one in English was earning more than $7000 or $8000. One of the Americanists said to Mrs. Sheedy as he came for his monthly check, “Well, where is the latest insult?” The Mellon professors were to receive $20,000. “Why doesn’t the foundation give the money to the University so that we could all get better salaries?” When we found out that the English Department would have a Mellon chair, no one moved a muscle. Crouch wrote a letter to Lionel Trilling, but the $20,000 over his $18,000 (and an apartment) at Columbia was not sufficient to intrigue him.\n\n[From the 1969 OWL] Probably the old Pitt faculty feared new, strong appointments as well as new ideas. Lionel Knights came because Charles Crow was the only person that Knights would compete with. At Ohio State, I could read a book by one faculty member and find ideas that I knew originated in three or four others. Pitt faculty –except for Charles Crow and Alan Markman—never talked to one another or to me. They had nothing to say, I suspect. I always thought that Charles Peake had been the responsible party for selecting and persuading L. C. Knights to come. British scholars were available because their salaries were even lower than in the U.S. The British scholars talked to us, they were all more alert than the Old Pitt faculty, and they brought fresh perspectives. They made a difference. In addition to Knights we had … Kenneth Muir (Shakespearean), and the wonderful Will Matthews (a medievalist). Matthews had a wee touch of cockney still in his speech, and he could speak wonderfully about allowing or not allowing Black students to use their own language.\n\nIn my first year, I had met members of the Old Pitt philosophy department at lunch on the 17th floor. One was a heavy, profound German gentleman who resembled Immanuel Kant. He was a Lutheran, and he let it be known. Another was a skinny, wispy man who talked to me about poetry. He absolutely proclaimed that Aesthetics was not a division of philosophy. There was a serious man who always wore a shaded baseball cap because his eyes hurt. Except for the heavy Lutheran who was just short of retirement, they all disappeared, and the new crew that Charles Peake recruited at Yale came in. Mellon professorships altered the moribund department.\n\nI am sure that the Old Pitt faculty thought that they too would lose cachet as unceremoniously as the Old Philosophy people. In those days, it was still possible to locate at a more congenial place. The sweet gentlemen went to places where other sweet gentlemen could be found. Charles Peake was the Power. I don’t know what his title was, but later the position would be defined as the Provost. Charles was an English professor who had passed into administration at the University of Michigan. Alan Markman had known him at Michigan, and Alan’s position in the department (and quick promotion to associate professor with tenure) might have been a hope for the department to keep control of [its] own destiny. Alan had invitations to Chancellor Litchfield’s country estate in northern central Pennsylvania. Charles Peake would turn up at Markman parties. We also knew a young man, Bernard Schroeder Adams, who Litchfield had hired as the first Head of Admissions. University spaces were still limited after the post-war glut, and the Registrar could make a simple decision. Adams was the son of a professor at Franklin and Marshall College, and Bernie’s baby-sitter had been Richard D. Altick, my professor at Ohio State. Bernie was a Princeton graduate (and basketball star) who had worked in Princeton’s admission office. Bernie enrolled in our graduate program and earned a degree while running admissions. He sat at Litchfield’s cabinet meetings and relayed judgments, plans, proposals to Alan Markman and others in the revolutionary group. “Charles Peake will get a Mellon professor; Charles Peake will reform this antiquated curriculum.”\n\n[From the 1969 OWL] Peake was the instrument that brought the Philosophy department in to the second half of the twentieth century, but he never could succeed with English. When Frank Wadsworth came as Faculty of Arts & Sciences Dean, he may also have secured some of these men for us. The earlier Brit, Herbert Howarth, might have been a young candidate for a Mellon appointment, but Howarth had only a temporary visa. Howarth went to Canada to re-enter in two years on a permanent visa, but at the end of two years Penn wooed him away from us. He died shortly after. Knights came several times and he was a wonderful faculty member – witty, kind, knowledgeable, and so very encouraging of conversation. Several of us went to lunch with him, and Knights came to our houses to talk about I.A. Richards and F.R. Leavis at Cambridge. He had been I.A. Richards’ student at Cambridge and had written examples in Richards’ Practical Criticism. He had published early reviews of Eliot’s work! I admired his work on Ben Jonson. He was a Scrutiny stalwart. When I made a slightly disparaging comment about Leavis’ moralism, Knights turned to correct me—not about the moralism but about Leavis’ strong influence on him and other scholars at Cambridge. Knights was thin as a rail, and he had wonderful stories about being rejected for the British army during World War II and saddled with humongous teaching loads, air raid station duties, and care for the sick and wounded. He spoke at an angle to every expected judgment. He was always an heroic ideal of what a professor should be. I found him coming out of our Book Centre with a stack of newly-purchased books. “Professor Knights, books are cheaper in England!” “Yes,” he responded, “but there I don’t have the money to buy books.” We arranged for him to meet Robert Frost when Frost came to receive an honorary degree. Knights was very excited, “He is almost as good, you know, as Yeats.” Well, yes. He didn’t mind American actors performing Shakespeare, and he declared every new production and every new reading opened up new ideas for him. When I last talked to him in 1994, he was excited about a new book on Hamlet. He fixed my lunch and we talked so happily for several hours. I probably tired him too much, but the talk was so good.\n\nStudents would start projects in seminars, and then Knights would disappear back to Bristol and then later back to Cambridge where he was named King Edward VII Professor of English literature. He always announced, “A political appointment, you know; no merit in it all.” His influence probably brought Kenneth Muir for a visit since they both had been concerned with Labour Politics….\n\nL.C. Knights lived until 8 March 1995. He was always willing to host visiting Pitt faculty in England. He was always a name we could use to open doors for us while we worked in England. He had a son, Ben, who later earned a Ph.D. at Cambridge (his father had only an M.A.) and published a book on Coleridge’s idea of the clerisy as it worked out in Carlyle, Arnold, Newman, and Pater (I’m unsure about the last). Ben was still in his teens at Knights’ first visit, but he did not attend an American school for fear that it would damage his chances to enter Cambridge. Instead he read –chiefly about the American Civil War. My memory of young Ben is his jumping. He bounced like a ball. The Knights had also adopted a daughter, Frances, who was the child of Mrs. Knights’ sister. Mrs. Knights taught at the College of Education in Cambridge (Homerton), and we called her, behind her back, the Duchess. She had furious stories about how Cambridge ignored her and only thought of Lionel. Her father had survived the Battle of Gallipoli during WWI, and in the 1960s was still alive. Mrs. Knights, however, slipped into senility in the 1980s. Surely she has passed to her great reward. Ben Knights married a faculty member at Durham University, but I never managed to see him on my visits to England. I have not seen any books beyond that first one. His father explained that he worked primarily with non-traditional students at Durham. His father also said that Ben worked to undo all that he had done as a critic. Other times, other manners.\n\nOn his first visit, Knights came with such a passion against Northrop Frye that he wouldn’t allow any of the words from The Anatomy of Criticism in his classes. A few wiser students derived the terms through William Blake (where Frye had them too) and thus managed to get Frye’s critical ideas into the seminar. Knights approved of William Blake. Knights discovered later that Frye attended Knights’ lectures in Cambridge and thus the resistance to Frye melted. Knights’ last visit to Pittsburgh was the spring of 1977 when he gave a lecture on Eliot’s Four Quartets for the Northeast MLA.\n\nThe visitors stimulated us, brought us fresh ideas, questioned our old ideas, but they didn’t stay long enough to produce that quality and quantity of graduates that the Pitt Philosophy department turned out with great and astonishing regularity.\n\n[From the 1969 OWL]\n\nFrom James F. Knapp\n\nWhen I joined the department in the mid-sixties, students and faculty were passionate about the civil rights and environmental movements, and then increasingly about ending the war in Viet Nam. Organizing protests against the war still overshadowed the new feminism, which would not fully announce its presence until the founding of the Women’s Studies Program in 1972. In the early sixties, the English faculty was small-- just 24 men and one woman. The graduate program, on the other hand, was large, with 215 graduate students, though perhaps as a hint of changing times, 49% were women. Nevertheless, the department’s reading list for M.A. students preparing for the final examination was firmly traditional: “We recommend only the following as major figures.” The list that followed specified 51 names, including the undoubtedly lonely voice of just one woman, Emily Dickinson. Course readings in the department were already far more diverse, but the canon wars were still ahead of us, while the initial energies for change in the department tended to focus on a broad range of pedagogical issues.\n\nAt first, there were individual experiments. Bob Marshall (then assistant professor, later Dean of the College) and I both taught sections of Early Masterpieces to 120 students, without any TA support, which we thought was a terrible way to encourage student involvement in their own education. So we decided to take things into our own hands, dropping some lectures and dividing the class into small groups for two-hour discussions, all of which we would teach ourselves. In some weeks we would each teach 8 of these two-hour sessions. Earnest and hopeful, but impossible to sustain, our experiment was one moment in a much more general search among the faculty to find new ways of enhancing the learning of our undergraduates. A variety of initiatives began to emerge, many hard to imagine today. One group of faculty decided they could teach their students more fully if they understand better “the subtleties and complexities of group activity,” and so they convinced the Dean to give them a small grant to hire a psychoanalyst, who would meet with them regularly at someone’s house. Dr. Wodnicki was knowledgeable about film and art, as well as psychoanalysis, and he remained a friend of the department for many years.\n\n[From the 1969 OWL] Far more general in its scope, was the department’s Undergraduate Policies Committee, which met for several years to rethink all the fundamental assumptions about how undergraduates were being taught. In 1969, the committee made its formal proposal to the department, and its premises truly capture the hopes and beliefs of its decade, urging that: “Teaching and learning (like scholarship) occur most rewardingly in an atmosphere of maximum freedom, honesty, trust, and community; that education occurs when real emotional and intellectual needs are being recognized and satisfied; that pedagogical policies should be designed to encourage and inspire rather than to force and punish; that the unfettered quest for knowledge and involvement in ideas and feeling are seductive in their own right and may be counted on to arouse the enthusiasm of young men and women eager to steep themselves in life and art; that our task is to facilitate growth not to issue certification.”\n\nTaking its own premises seriously, the Undergraduate Policies Committee proposed that the catalog would not list any regular courses; that teachers and students would decide what they wanted to pursue and how the group would operate; there would be no required courses and no minimum courses expected of an undergraduate major; there would be no grades and no requirements such as exams or papers “except insofar as a whole group agrees to certain self-regulating disciplines.” The proposal concludes, “At the end of the year the same number of credits goes to the student who has been involved in three contracts or one or none. In effect, the student receives his B.A. for having declared himself a literature major—no more and no less.” Not surprisingly, the proposal failed to pass, but only after many long and heated meetings. The details may have been hopelessly utopian, but at the proposal’s heart was a striking expression of the belief that every student wants to learn, that free inquiry should be the heart of the university, that our task as teachers is to enable the education of the whole person.\n\nThe Undergraduate Policies Committee provided departmental drama at the end of the decade, but the issues it took up were being debated across the department (and in departments across the country). The creative writing program decided to leave the choice of literature courses up to its students, but they also voted to retain their separate identity as a program. Although there was as yet no formal composition program, the Freshman English Committee in the same year proposed that the requirement for Freshman English be abolished, and by the early 70’s there were no required courses in English. Some of those requirements would be reinstated in the decades to come, but the in the spring of 1969 the Freshman English Committee concluded that that “there must be a university-wide focus on the need for developing communications skills—a focus that will cause students, no matter what their major areas of study, to be making constant re-evaluation of such needs throughout their undergraduate courses.” Forty years later, writing across the curriculum was a responsibility accepted by every department in the Dietrich School. Some ideas launched in the sixties, such as that one, are now taken for granted; some remain only as cultural history. It was a memorable decade.\n\nFrom Marcia Landy\n\n[From the 1969 OWL] I was hired as an Assistant Professor in the tenure stream in 1967-68 by then Department Chair, Robert Whitman. I was to fill the position of a “Miltonist,” and I was to teach general introductory courses in poetry and the novel. I was one of several new appointments in English. My hiring was not exceptional, but for the fact that I was one of only a very few women in the tenure stream.\n\nI suspect that the decision to hire me was in part related to the development of a new professional journal, Milton Studies, to be edited by Professor James Simmonds. This journal was to become a major resource for Seventeenth Century scholars (and would continue long after Professor Simmonds retired through the able editorship of Albert Labriola at Duquesne University). It seemed to me that the department was in a growth mode. I joined other new faculty: Alexander Welsh, a Victorianist from Yale, and another, also from Yale, Philip Wion in Shakespeare Studies; Barrett Mandell, an advocate of radical forms of teaching Composition and Literature; Rae Siporin in Linguistics; and a few other hires in American and English literature.\n\nThe department continued to grow into the early 1970s. Initially, the department was conservative, adhering to established methods of scholarship and teaching, but this was to change. I should underline that the department that I entered was an impressive and solid intellectual environment with an enviable faculty. My personal predilections were for Professor Whitman, who was a George Bernard Shaw and drama scholar, Professor Thomas Philbrick, a scholar of the first order in American Literature, and a phenomenal classroom teacher, and Charles Crow, another formidable teacher.\n\nDepartment meetings became increasingly lively in the next decade as a forum for discussing changes in the curriculum, in teaching methodologies, and in criteria for promotion. In the next decades, the department was to move into a prominent position in the university and in the profession, through the efforts of faculty to sponsor departmental and interdepartmental programs, including first-class Composition and Film Studies Programs, as well as supporting programs in Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies.\n\nFrom Chris Rawson\n\nHired by Bob Whitman in 1967, I joined the department in 1968, straight from a year of bibliographic and textual work at the British Museum, anticipating a traditional career of genteel research. But remember 1968? Vietnam, Martin Luther King, Bobby Kennedy, battles over equal opportunity in housing and jobs? I was thrown into the tumult of civic politics and policy, which extended right into what, how, why and whom we were teaching. I was so bedazzled that it took me a couple of years to write the last few chapters of my dissertation.\n\nFor me, the center of these questions was a lively discussion group formed by Bob Marshall in which 10 or 12 of us younger faculty (both assistant and associate professors) debated all the dynamic aspects of teaching that had been absent from my otherwise pleasant graduate training. (This is the group that in a subsequent year met with Dr. Wodnicki about group interaction.)\n\nPitt was bulking up for the baby boom; so was the department; those were yeasty times. We younger hires lay siege to and overcame the requirement for lit majors of six period survey courses. Freed from teaching the 18th century survey every term, I invented a Satire course that had students singing Monty Python’s “Philosophers’ Song.” We explored small classes, big classes, team-teaching, any variant possible. Phil Wion and I even taught a 200-student, double-credit survey course, Beowulf to Blake, with every small-and-large-group bell and whistle we could dream up. We also took university courses out into the community, which had me teaching on-site seminars for teachers in several high schools, using just about anything they’d agree to read with the covert goal of getting them to actually talk to each other about education.\n\n[From the 1969 OWL]\n\nAmid all the excitement and the alarums of battle, there were doubtless losses. In my first year, we could have all 25 tenure-stream department members to a party, and did. A couple of years later, the department was too big – but there were too many battle scars to make such a party attractive, anyway. Some of us younger faculty lost relations with senior people we admired. Differences in principle too quickly became personal.\n\nIn retrospect, maybe we were reinventing the wheel. But anyway, we didn’t win: a department where the dominant (in numbers and energy) younger faculty was in love with innovation, teaching and service, was soon reined in and returned to the conventional research model by a powerful Dean. I was the first casualty, denied tenure by the Dean for the same record heavy in teaching and service that had been sufficient the year before.\n\nOn the other hand, some of what we advocated soon became common place. So even when you lose, time is on your side. Flash forward a few decades and the English Department has sprouted out in all directions, an inspiring mix of programs. As for me, the national AAUP said I had de facto tenure. So although I developed a parallel, 25-year career as theater critic, I never left Pitt, and now (2014) I’m just a couple of years short of a half-century teaching at this place I love in spite of itself.\n\n1960s Courses\n\nBy all accounts, life in the English department in the 1960s was exciting, dynamic, noisy, contentious, and difficult. It was a decade of transition between a department formed in the 1920s, a department that defined itself primarily in terms of teaching and service, reading and writing (small r, small w), and the department that was to emerge in the 1970s, a department with ambitions to national prominence in research and publication. The figures, energies, and administrative structures to emerge in the 1970s created a department that led the nation in rethinking the terms, methods, and reach of English Studies. But it was not an easy transition.\n\nLiterature\n\nIn the 1960s, the graduate program grew dramatically. In the 1950s, the department granted 26 PhDs; in the 1960s it granted 89. The number of MA candidates increased at almost the same rate, by a factor of 2 rather than 3. The PhD program, as it always had been, was a program of fairly conventional literary study—period, author, and genre. With the emphasis turning to the PhD program, the study of literature became the center of growth, energy and visibility in the department. And with the large numbers of graduate teaching assistants that were added to the lower division teaching pool, the study of literature became the frame of reference for general education (including the teaching of composition) in ways (and to a degree) that were markedly different from the past.\n\nThis growth in the graduate program was planned, part of a campus initiative that began in 1956 when Edward Litchfield took office as the University’s 12th Chancellor. It began to shape the department in 1959, when the A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust gave $12 million to the University to establish ten distinguished professorships and 50 pre-doctoral fellowships. English was one of the 10 departments chosen to receive these funds and, it was assumed, to develop a significant research profile and a distinguished graduate program. Philosophy, with the appointment of Adolph Grunbaum as its Mellon Chair, would lead the way. (It is worth remembering that Charles Peake, a Professor of English, was Assistant Chancellor, soon to be Vice Chancellor for the Academic Disciplines. Putnam Jones, a Professor of English, was Dean of the Graduate School. And Frank Wadsworth, a Professor of English, would be hired in 1962 to serve as the Dean of the Division of the Humanities.)\n\nThe growth in the graduate program was part of a growth across U.S. universities, prompted in part by demographic predictions of a need for college faculty, in part by the war in Vietnam and students seeking draft exemptions, but primarily (at least at the University of Pittsburgh) by the generation of men and women who entered the profession after the war and who wanted a professional status that came with research, advanced study, and engagement with a PhD program. In a 1964 report invited by the Dean’s office, the department projected annual graduate student enrollments to more than double between 1962 and 1970:\n\nFull Time MA/PhD from 47 in 1962 to an estimated 118 in 1970\n\nPart Time MA/PhD from 98 in 1962 to an estimated 159 in 1970\n\nFull Time PhD from 2 in 1962 to an estimated 56 in 1970\n\nPart Time PhD from 32 in 1962 to an estimated 96 in 1970.\n\nIn a 1971 report to the department by Robert Gale, Director of Graduate Studies, the primary PhD research areas for the decade of the 1960s were:\n\nOld English, Medieval and Renaissance Studies 20 (dissertations from a total of 89)\n\nAmerican Literature, 1900 to the present 20\n\nEighteenth Century British 10\n\nAmerican Literature, 1860-1900 8\n\nCriticism 8\n\nAmerican Literature to 1860 7\n\nAnd it appears that the PhD graduates in the 60s were successful in finding tenure track positions, many at local colleges, including the University of Pittsburgh’s regional campuses, but one third of them at major research universities across the US. In the PhD class of the 1960s, there would be 16 English department chairs, 4 college presidents, 3 Provosts or Deans, several endowed chairs, and an MLA James Russell Lowell Award winner.\n\nThe hiring to support the graduate program in English, and the very substantial number of graduate students who joined the department (and who wanted to bring literature into the composition course) gave new weight and definition to the teaching and study of Literature. There was an increase in the number and range of literature courses in the course catalogs of the 1960s, and the newer courses went beyond the usual period designations to include: “The Roaring 20s,” “The Augustans,” “Metaphysicals and Cavaliers,” “Makers of Modern Drama,” “Milton,” “Contemporary British Novelists,” and “The American Renaissance.” The reading list for the PhD Comprehensive Exam, a much contested document, assumed coverage of the broad canon in English and American literature. More than anything else, the growth of the graduate program changed the department’s sense of its mission and identity. [add pdf to PhD Comp Exam]\n\nCreative Writing\n\nFrom 1920 to 1960, the English department defined itself by highlighting the success of the undergraduates who learned to write in its classes. In the 1960s, the Writing Major remained a popular choice among undergraduates. But during the decade of the 60s, the Creative Writing program began to lose its momentum. With the retirements of Edwin Peterson and Emily Irvine creative writing would lose two of its most effective teachers and, in Peterson, a much heralded, much admired public figure. Lawrence Lee, who had the strongest national reputation as a writer, and who might have been expected to step forward, turned his back on the program and insisted on teaching courses in literature.\n\nIn 1964 Peterson wrote a letter to George Crouch, responding to a request for a report on the status of the Writing Major. Peterson wrote reluctantly and said that after almost 20 years of success,\n\na change set in, not suddenly but almost imperceptibly. An excellent young teacher, George Abbe, who has since done very well for himself, became an understandable embarrassment to the University and was relieved of his duties. Mr. Lawrence Lee was employed in his place and after a number of years Professor Lee, for many reasons resigned from our program. Later, Miss Dorothy O’Connor, one of our more talented teachers, left the University to be married. Professor Crow, who had kindly consented to help in our work, became so deeply involved in graduate teaching that he could no longer assist us. In 1962 Dr. Laufe gave up his course in article writing to assist in the freshman program. In 1963, Miss Emily Irvine, a substantial and invaluable part of our program, retired. And back in 1961, I myself had to give up two courses in advanced writing to take care of a new system of teaching Freshmen English with graduate assistant as instructors.\n\nIn the end, he said, the writing major had 1½ teachers “trying to take care of about one third of all the majors registered in the English department.” And, he concluded: “Obviously the quality of the program has deteriorated.”\n\nMontgomery (Monty) Culver, who emerged as the available senior figure in the Writing Program after Peterson’s retirement, did not have the personality to fight the battles for faculty resources or to propose an MFA, a move that would have tied the writing program to the growth in graduate studies. (The Writers Workshop at Iowa could have provided the model.) The Writing Program would struggle for recognition and for faculty resources until Ed Ochester took over as program Director in 1978.\n\nComposition\n\nThe story of Composition in the 1960s is a story of a transition in leadership, from Edwin Peterson to Virginia Elliott. From the time he joined the faculty in the 1930s, Peterson was at the center of both composition and writing in the undergraduate curriculum. In the 40s and 50s, these areas of writing became more finely differentiated. The value of “creative” writing became increasingly measured in terms of publication and awards, recognition from the outside rather than the value to the student writer. And composition was increasingly understood in relation to the demands of administering a required course to thousands of students. In the 1960s, Peterson gained national attention for creating a composition course, the “magic lantern” course delivered to hundreds of students in a lecture hall. This was far removed from his famous conference courses in the Early American nationality room. Developing this course moved Peterson away from the Writing major and back more fully into first year composition.\n\nBy the time Peterson retired in 1968, the composition course he represented was meeting substantial opposition from faculty colleagues, who would refer disparagingly to the “Pittsburgh Paragraph,” but even more so from the now very large cohort of graduate teaching assistants, students in the 60s who saw the course as old-fashioned, rigid, and formulaic, more of an “exercise to be endured” than a course for the new generation, as argued in a long report from a committee chaired by Charles Crow.\n\nRobert Whitman, the department chair, needed to prepare for the transition. He recruited Virginia Elliott from the School of Education to join the department in 1967 as a Lecturer. Her assignment would be to direct the Composition Program—to write the curriculum, to train the graduate assistants, and to coordinate the instructors who taught composition. Elliott had been teaching and supervising student teachers in the School of Education since 1965. Before that, she taught English at Mt. Lebanon High School (from 1940 to 1965). In the 40s, she had taken courses in the English department, courses in Short Story and Advanced Short Story, most likely with Peterson, and she had published two stories in Prairie Schooner. Elliott was active with the NCTE and, in 1969, with Lois Josephs Fowler (a former Pitt PhD student, now at CMU), she edited and provided a chapter for English for Academically Advanced Students (NCTE, 1969).\n\nWith no one in the English department prepared to step forward to run the program, Whitman turned to Elliott. (Abe Laufe, who had worked on the “magic lantern” course, would have been an obvious choice, but Laufe was to retire in 1971.) For the English department, Elliott taught composition, children’s literature, and a teaching seminar for graduate assistants, English 285, first called “Teaching Composition in College” and later “Rhetoric.” She rewrote the required first year course (we have from two versions of this – “A Basic Course in Freshman Composition” and “Freshman English”), and she began to explore a computer-assisted course for remedial students. [add pdfs at class names]\n\nIn 1970 Elliott was promoted to Associate Professor but, to her disappointment, her primary appointment remained in the School of Education. She felt she had earned her status as a member of the English department; she felt this had been part of the deal when she was first hired. She retired a few years later, when William E. Coles, Jr. was recruited to become the new Director of Composition. Coles would once again bring the department’s composition program to national prominence.\n\nFor more on Edwin Peterson, composition, and creative writing, see this conversation between David Bartholomae and Andrew Welsh.

Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust gave $12 million to the University to establish ten distinguished professorships and 50 pre-doctoral fellowships. The English department was named as a recipient. In the 1960s, the department used the funds to bring in Visiting Mellon Professors. All were invited to teach graduate seminars, courses for undergraduates, and to present lectures to the university community. In the 1960s, the Visiting Mellon Professors were:\n\n[L.C. Knights]\n\nL.C. Knights (1961/1962). Knights was the Winterstoke Professor of English at Bristol University, England, and later the King Edward VII Professor of English literature at Cambridge (1965-1973). He was an editor of Scrutiny and a distinguished critic and scholar. In the 1960s, he published An Approach to Hamlet (Stanford, 1961), Shakespeare: The Histories (Longmans, 1965), and Further Explorations (Stanford, 1965). In 1976, he published Explorations 3 with the University of Pittsburgh Press.\n\nKenneth Muir (1962/1963; 1963/1964). Muir was the King Alfred Professor of English Literature and Dean of the Faculty of Arts at the University of Liverpool. Like Knights, he was a distinguished scholar of the English renaissance. Muir provided an essay for the Charles Crow festschrift, Shakespeare’s Late Plays (1974).\n\nAllardyce Nicoll (1964/65; Spring 1966). Nicoll was a drama historian at Birmingham University, director of the Shakespeare Institute at Stratford, and editor of Shakespeare Survey.\n\nJames R. Sutherland (1965/66). Sutherland was the Lord Northcliffe Professor of Modern English Literature at University College, University of London. He worked on English literature of the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nL.C. Knights returned as a Visiting Mellon Professor in 1966/67. Knights provided an essay for the Charles Crow festschrift, Shakespeare’s Late Plays (1974).\n\n[William Matthews]\n\nWilliam Matthews (1967/1968). Matthews was Professor of English at UCLA, Director of the UCLA Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was the principal editor of the definitive edition of The Diary of Samuel Pepys.\n\nJohn Crow (1968/1969?) From Richard Tobias: “We also had one term, a visiting scholar from Britain, John Crow, a remarkable man who was interested in Shakespeare, boxers, and cooking. At one faculty meeting, the two Crow gentlemen [John Crow and Charles Crow] were sitting side by side so that I could shout to the medievalist, Markman, “Look, the Twa Corbies.” One seldom gets to play such a hand.”\n\nWarner G. Rice (1969/1970). Rice was Professor Emeritus at the University of Michigan. He was formerly the Director of the University Library and Chair of the Michigan English department. Rice was a distinguished Miltonist and was on campus at the time of the founding of Milton Studies.\n\nRetirements, Faculty of Long Standing\n\nFord Elmore Curtis, Professor. Curtis retired in 1960. With his wife, he had created an extensive collection of theater playbills, reviews, photographs, clippings and memorabilia documenting the history of theater in New York and Pittsburgh from the 1840s to the 1960s. The Ford E. and Harriet R. Curtis Theatre Collection is now housed at the Hillman Library.\n\nEmily Gertrude Irvine, Professor. Irvine retired in 1964. She was the first to teach children’s literature in our department. Her writing courses were legendary and many of her students won national awards for work they did under her supervision.\n\nAgnes Lynch Starrett, Professor. Starrett retired in 1964 and the alumni magazine, which she had once edited, published a long tribute to her “Four Decades with Pitt.” She joined the department in 1924, after completing her MA and studying with Percival Hunt. She was closely involved with university publications throughout her career, and she was the author of the first comprehensive history of the University, Through One Hundred and Fifty Years (1937). In 1954 she was named the Director of the University of Pittsburgh Press; in 1955 she was promoted to the rank of Professor. For most of her career, she taught courses in composition.\n\n[Avery Bernhard reporting from the front]\n\nMarjorie Avery Bernhard, Associate Professor. Bernhard retired in 1965. She was one of the few American women journalists to report from overseas during World War II. She taught journalism and magazine writing.\n\nFrederick Philip Mayer, Professor. Mayer chaired the English department in the 1940s and served an important role as a senior member of the faculty through the 50s. When George Crouch stepped down as department Chair in 1966, Mayer served for a year as Acting Chair. He retired in 1968. Robert F. Whitman assumed the role of department chair in 1967.\n\nEdwin L. Peterson, Professor. In 1960, Peterson served as a visiting professor and Director of the Short Story Program at the University of Colorado. In 1962 he won a Distinguished Service to Journalism award from the Press Club of Western Pennsylvania. He retired in 1968.\n\nThroughout his tenure in the 1960s, however, he continued to play a major role in support of composition and creative writing, and he continued to be much in the national news. Peterson was known for the success of the writers who passed through his workshops, intense and heated meetings in the Early American classroom which served as his office. In the early 1960s, however, Peterson began to teach composition through large lectures, 200 students at a time, assisted by a “magic lantern,” an overhead projector.\n\nHe developed transparencies and overlays to present writing samples and then to highlight features for discussion. The slides included student themes, which he would edit with a grease pencil. With a projected image, large numbers of students could read, discuss, and edit the same text at the same time. Peterson said, “I have to see a manuscript to tell whether it is any good. Yet for all these years, writing teachers—myself included—have been trying to tell students about writing. It is no wonder it hasn’t worked.”\n\nThis project brought new national attention to the department. In 1962, Peterson won a $23,000 grant from the U.S. Office of Education to adapt this new system for use across U.S. university campuses. In 1963, the system was published and marketed nationally by Science Research Associates, in Chicago, along with a new textbook, Contemporary Composition, co-authored with Robert Lumsden from the Evanston Township High School and Northwestern University. The “magic lantern” course was presented at a special session of the Conference on College Composition and Communication. [add pdf to Contemporary Composition]\n\nPeterson retired after 41 years of teaching. He had joined the faculty as a graduate assistant in 1927. To honor his retirement, the alumni magazine asked Peterson to “roll a blank sheet of paper in his typewriter and put down whatever random thought came to him, reflecting on almost a half century of helping young men and women express their own thoughts. This was published under the title, “Why Don’t Students See Orion?” In style and thought, the essay is very much in line with Percival Hunt’s The Gift of the Unicorn.” Peterson’s comments are presented by short, numbered, aphoristic sections, called “Notions.” Notion #1 reads:\n\nOften I am shocked to realize that many of my students never see the heavens. They live in cities or in heavily populated suburbs, and the streetlights blind them to the stars. Mention Orion to most students, and they look at you in bewilderment. They have read about the Great Dipper, some of them, but they have never lain on the top of a hill and watched the constellation move about the North Star. Strange world that wants to put a man on the moon but that cannot look at the stars!\n\nProfessors\n\nW. George Crouch, Professor. Crouch continued to serve as department chair through 1965-66, when he was appointed Secretary of the University and Secretary of the Board of Trustees.\n\nPutnam Fennell Jones, Professor. Jones served as Dean of the Graduate School. Robert Alberts, in his history of the university, quotes Jones in 1962 giving this assessment of the Litchfield era: “The trouble at Pitt has been that, until a few years ago, Pitt was just about cut off from the scholarly world where reputations are made. The big change is that Pitt has now joined the scholarly world.”\n\nCharles H. Peake, Professor. In 1961 Peake’s title changed from Assistant Chancellor for Student Affairs to Vice Chancellor for the Academic Disciplines. Peake was one of three Vice Chancellors; the others were Vice Chancellor for the Professions and Vice Chancellor for Finance. In 1968, Peake was appointed Provost, which meant that he was in charge of all academic units except the Health Professions. During his tenure as Vice Chancellor and Provost, Peake guided most of the senior appointments during the Litchfield administration and played a role in the institution’s growth in stature as a center for research. It was Peake, for example, who led the recruitment that brought Adolf Grunbaum as the Mellon Professor of Philosophy.\n\n[Robert Whitman] Robert F. Whitman (PhD, Harvard 1956). Robert Whitman joined the department as an Assistant Professor in 1960. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1966 and Professor in 1967, when he was also appointed English department Chair. Whitman’s specialty was drama. He published articles on Shelley (The Cenci), O’Neill, Webster, and Shaw. He was the author of three books: The Play-Reader’s Handbook (Bobbs-Merrill, 1966); Beyond Melancholy: John Webster and the Tragedy of Darkness (Salzburg, Inst. Fur Englische Sprache und Literatur, 1973), and Shaw and the Play of Ideas (Cornell, 1977).\n\nLawrence Lee, Professor. In 1963, Lee published “The Present Status of Tragedy” in the journal, The Classical World (May 1963). In the decade of the 1960s, Lee also published three books of verse, two with Boxwood, a small press located in Pittsburgh and edited by Ralph Buchsbaum, Professor of Zoology at the university: The American as Faust: A Dramatic Poem (Boxwood, 1965); The Voice of the Furies (Boxwood, 1969); and The Cretan Flute and Other Poems (Dolmen Press, 1968). Lee also edited a collection of poetry, some written by current and former students, Cathedral Poets I (Boxwood, 1966). In 1976, his poem The Cathedral, hand carved in slate, was mounted on the wall of the Cathedral of Learning commons room, near room 123. The poem was commissioned by Pitt’s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa and written in 1966. Here is its opening stanza:\n\nThrough night its shape\n\nWas darkness lifting from restraining dark\n\nA spire of stillness in a fixed sleepscape,\n\nStalagmite stark;\n\nAnd sleep\n\nItself was quiet with this tower to mark\n\nMeaning which matter, given form, can keep.\n\nIn 1962, Lee publically charged the Litchfield administration with conduct that threated the “academic integrity” of the university. The charges included the difficulties presented by class size, the new trimester system, and a general failure to devote resources to undergraduate education. (In the 60s, the University faced serious financial difficulties, difficulties that led Litchfield to negotiate with Harrisburg for the 1966 bail-out that resulted in Pitt’s status as a “state-related” institution.) Litchfield created a committee of seven professors to consider the charges. The committee included Adolf Grunbaum, the Mellon Professor of Philosophy, faculty members from the Schools of Business and Law, and the chairs of Political Science and Physics. Their report concluded, “Each of the issues he raised has been reduced essentially to divergent understanding, hurt feelings, reasonable human failures or goals out of harmony with institutional objectives.” Lee retired in 1973.\n\nCharles Crow, Professor. Charles Crow began teaching in the English department as a graduate student in 1931. He had a long record of successful undergraduate teaching. As the graduate program in English grew in the 1950s, and then quite dramatically in the 1960s, Crow became one of the most sought after MA and PhD dissertation advisors. One of his students, Peggy Knapp, said:\n\nI was a graduate student in the early 1960s when I took courses from Charles Crow. At this time PhD candidates were still required to prepare for the profession by studying and taking exams in all the major periods and authors. Professor Crow taught a wide range of periods, authors, and genres and was widely admired in the English Department for both the breadth and depth of his learning. His breadth suggested a phrase like “man of learning,” which was high praise at the time, but sounds amateurish now. There was nothing amateurish about Crow’s erudition, though, except perhaps his love of learning; it was crisp and rigorous. In particular, he was ahead of his time in raising with his students issues that would soon become the stuff of “literary theory.”\n\nIn 1970, Crow was honored as a “Distinguished Service Professor.” In his letter of support, Robert Whitman wrote:\n\nFor years, his undergraduate courses were the most popular of the department’s offerings. Generations of graduate students have worshipped Charles—and I use that extravagant term advisedly, for they found in him the model of a stimulating and provocative scholar-teacher. While he may not be what is known as a “publishing scholar”…, I find that Charles is nevertheless widely known and respected throughout the country and even abroad. I know that several of our most eminent Mellon Professors acknowledge his mastership in the area of Shakespearean criticism; and all of us who have heard him lecture recognize the extraordinarily broad learning and the profound mind.\n\nCrow retired in 1973. In the introduction to a festschrift offered to Crow on his retirement, Richard Tobias also noted the range of Crow’s reading and teaching. He said that while many professors concentrate on a figure or period, enacting “a concentration that the academic community admires”:\n\nCrow, on the other hand, has taught American literature, criticism, Milton, and Shakespeare. He offered seminars recently on John Dryden, Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, and Robert Browning. He taught for three years a sophomore Introduction to Poetry course so successfully that rising enrollments drove him away. His committee wrote a fifty-five page syllabus for a freshman writing course designed to make college writing a cultural experience rather than an exercise to be endured. Crow is the first to know the new Russian novel, the last French critic, or a fresh recording of an opera. From the early 1930s until now Crow is a man thinking in a time when thought seems a commodity snatched from sick hurry. His lectures were of uncommonly high caliber because he brought so much to his classes.\n\nIn 2007, the University received a gift of $1.5 million to endow the Charles Crow Chair in English. The donor was Thomas H. McIntosh, a 1948 graduate of the School of Liberal Arts. McIntosh was not an English major; he went on to earn a JD from Michigan in 1951 and then to a long and successful career with H.J. Heinz. The gift, McIntosh said, was in honor of a “memorable and valuable teacher, whose guidance to me as a freshman composition student was much appreciated then and later in my career.”\n\nIt is surely rare that a gift of this size is given in honor of a composition course and its teacher. Charles Crow earned his BA, MA and PhD from our department. Crow shaped and was shaped by a tradition of teaching that has a long and rich history in the English department at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nAbe Laufe was promoted to Professor in 1967. He retired in 1971. Laufe published short pieces in popular magazines, like Women’s Day and Ladies Home Companion. He was a popular lecturer and entertainer. He was also a scholar of American theater. In the 1960s he published two books, often cited in his field: Anatomy of a Hit: Long Run Plays on Broadway from 1900 to the Present Day (Hawthorne Books, 1966) and Broadway’s Greatest Musicals (Funk and Wagnall’s, 1969). He also completed an edited collection of letters, Army Doctor’s Wife on the Frontier: Letters from Alaska and the Far West, 1874-1878 (Pittsburgh, 1962; preliminary editing by Russell J. Ferguson). In 1978, he published The Wicked Stage: A History of Theater Censorship and Harassment in the United States (Ungar). Laufe regularly taught courses in composition and assisted Peterson on the “magic lantern” lecture course.\n\nDorothy Miller was promoted to Professor in 1969. In 1965, Miller received a $35,000 grant for a National Defense Education Act English Institute, cosponsored with School of Education. The institute was a summer program for 40 high school teachers across the nation. The other instructors were Edward Anthony (Linguistics), Abe Laufe, and Edwin Peterson.\n\n[Frank Whittemore Wadsworth] Frank Whittemore Wadsworth (PhD Princeton) was appointed as Professor in 1962, and he served as the first Dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Division of Humanities. Before his appointment, Wadsworth had taught at UCLA. He had been a Guggenhiem Fellow at the University of London’s Folger Library. His research areas included 16th and 17th century British literature. He was best known for his book, The Poacher from Stratford: A Partial Account of the Controversy Over the Authorship of Shakespeare’s Plays (California UP, 1958). Wadsworth left Pittsburgh in 1968 to become Academic Vice-President at the State University of New York’s new Purchase campus, where both a fellowship program and a student drama award now carry his name.\n\nWalter Evert (PhD Princeton). In 1964, Evert was hired as an Associate Professor and to serve as Associate Dean, Division of the Humanities. Like Wadsworth, Evert had been on the faculty at UCLA; he had previously taught at Princeton and Williams. He was promoted to Professor in 1967. Evert was the author of Aesthetic and Myth in the Poetry of Keats (Princeton, 1965) and Approaches to Teaching Keats’s Poetry (MLA, 1991).\n\nAlexander Welsh (PhD Harvard) was hired at the rank of Professor in 1967. He left in the early 1970s for UCLA, and he joined the faculty at Yale in 1991, where he was the Emily Sanford Professor of English. In 1971, he published The City of Dickens (Oxford). From 1975 to 1981, he was the editor of the journal, Nineteenth Century Fiction.\n\n[Thomas Philbrick] Thomas Philbrick (PhD Harvard) was appointed as an Associate Professor in 1962; he was promoted to the rank of Professor in 1967. He was the author of James Fenimore Cooper and the Development of American Sea Fiction (Harvard, 1961) and St. John de Crèvecoeur (Twayne, 1970). He later edited works by Cooper, Richard Henry Dana, Joshua Slocum and Michael Scott. With his son, Nathaniel Philbrick (2000 National Book Award winner for In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex), Philbrick was the editor of The Mayflower Papers: Selected Writings of Colonial New England (Penguin, 2007). Philbrick had a stack of Sunfish sailboats stored in his front yard waiting for the racing season; he raced them at the highest national level, usually winning.\n\n[Alan Markman] Alan Markman was promoted to Associate Professor in 1960 and Professor in 1966. He died in 1970 at 52. Many thought that he would be the next department chair. Markman was a medievalist who taught courses in the history of the English language. In 1966, he won an IBM grant with Nuel Belnap in the Philosophy department to develop and teach a new course, “Application of Computer Techniques to Humanities Research.” He was the coauthor, with Barnet Kottler, of A Computer Concordance to Five Middle English Poems (Pittsburgh 1966). From 1967 to 1969, he served as senior staff in an English Language Institute project in Bangkok, Thailand, under dual funding from the University of Pittsburgh and the Rockefeller Foundation. With Erwin Steinberg (at CMU), he published a textbook for courses in the history of the language, English Then and Now: Readings and Exercises (Random House, 1970), revised as Exercises in the History of English (University Press of America, 1983).\n\n[Robert L. Gale] Robert L. Gale was promoted to the rank of Associate Professor in 1961 and Professor in 1966. He retired in 1987. From the mid-60s to the mid-70s, Gale was the department’s Director of Graduate Studies. In the 1960s, he published articles on Willa Cather and Henry James and three books: Plots and Characters in the Fiction of Henry James (Archon), Thomas Crawford: American Sculptor (U of Pittsburgh P), and The Caught Image: Figurative Language in the Fiction of Henry James (U of North Carolina P). Gale is still active as a scholar at the time of this writing (2014); he has had a remarkably productive career, including articles on a wide variety of topics in American literature and over 30 books, the most recent of which are Characters and Plots In James Welch’s Novels (Word Association, 2014), Characters and Plots in the Fiction of Kate Chopin (McFarland, 2014) and a reissue of The Caught Image: Figurative Language in the Fiction of Henry James (U of North Carolina, 2012). Gale published several volumes in the McFarland series, Plots and Characters, and with the McFarland Author Encyclopedias--most recently, Characters and Plots in the Fiction of J.M. Cain (2011) and the Edwin Arlington Robinson Encyclopedia (2011). Gale published several books with the Greenwood Companions series, most recently the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Companion (2003); several with the Twayne United States Authors series, most recently Louis L’Amour (1992); and several with the Boise State University Western Authors series, most recently Matt Braun (1990). These books have won Gale a broad and varied and enthusiastic audience.\n\n[Richard Tobias] Richard Tobias was promoted to the rank of Associate Professor in 1966 and Professor in 1969. Tobias (known as Tob) died in 2006, at 81, in his 54th year of teaching, 49 of them at the University of Pittsburgh. Tobias was a legend among his students and a good friend and mentor to his colleagues. He served for over 40 years with the University Senate, including two terms as President. He was active with the Anti-Discrimination Committee when the University granted health benefits to same sex partners in 2005. He was a strong advocate for academic freedom. He had resigned from the University of Colorado when the faculty were required to sign a McCarthy-era loyalty oath. He served from 1960-1981 on the Senate Tenure and Academic Freedom committee. Tobias was Dean for the 1985 voyage of Semester at Sea, and he was invited as a Visiting Scholar at King’s College, Cambridge University, in 1989. At his death, he endowed two Richard C. and Barbara N. Tobias graduate student fellowships.\n\nAt his memorial service, the English department chair, David Bartholomae, said\n\nWe will remember him as an exuberant and passionate scholar, writer and teacher. He taught courses on the Victorians, on Shakespeare, on modern poetry and on comedy. Tob was always in mid-thought, always ready to tell you what he was reading, what he was writing, and what his students were doing — often in a single sentence and always in his strong and resonant voice. He was quick with a joke or a song, a bit of verse or a line from a favorite novel.\n\nTobias was the author of The Art of James Thurber (Ohio State UP, 1969) and T.E. Brown: The Manx Poet (Twayne, 1970); he was the editor of Shakespeare’s Late Plays: Essays in Honor of Charles Crow (U of Pittsburgh Press, 1974) and (with his wife, Barbara) Bibliographies of Studies in Victorian Literature: 1975-1984 (AMS, 1991). He was a charter member of the editorial board of Victorian Poetry and he helped to prepare the annual bibliography for Victorian Studies from 1959 to 1994, editing the process from 1975-1984. At his death, he was working on a biography of the late-Victorian novelist Rhoda Broughton.\n\nAssociate Professors\n\nRichard C. Snyder was promoted to the rank of Associate Professor in 1969. He retired in 1978 for health problems that included severely restricted eyesight. With Kathleen D. Byrne, Snyder published Chrysalis: Willa Cather in Pittsburgh, 1896-1906 (Historical Society Of Western Pennsylvania, 1980).\n\n[Gerd Fraenkel] Gerd Fraenkel (PhD Indiana) was hired as an Associate Professor in 1962 and was gone from the department lists by 1967. Fraenkel was a linguist, author of two textbooks, New Aspects of Language (Ginn & Co, 1964) and Languages of the World (Ginn & Co, 1967). He worked on issues related to Esperanto and simplified spelling. He was hired to organize a new interdisciplinary Linguistics Program, and he served as the Chair of the Interdisciplinary Committee on Linguistics. In 1964, the University announced the formation of a new Department of General Linguistics. Edward Anthony, Director of the University of Michigan’s English Language Institute, was recruited as Chair. Although Fraenkel was clearly by-passed for this position, he was given an appointment in the new department. In 1967, Fraenkel left to teach at the George Peabody College for Teachers in Nashville. The Gerd Fraenkel papers are held at Vanderbilt University.\n\n[Myron Taube] Myron Taube (PhD, NYU). Trained as a Victorianist, Taube taught fiction and was a central figure in the Writing Program in the 1970s and 80s. In 1966, Taube was recruited from Kutztown State College to serve as a Visiting Associate Professor and to teach courses in fiction writing. The department was still struggling to staff writing courses after Emily Irvine’s retirement in 1964. In 1969, Taube joined the regular faculty as a tenured Associate Professor. He was promoted to the rank of Professor in 1974. He published essays on Thackeray, Joyce, and Defoe and short stories in a wide variety of literary magazines, including “The Investigation” in the North Atlantic Review (Spring, 1971). At his retirement, he endowed a Myron Taube Fiction Prize for undergraduate writing majors. [add pdf ]\n\nMontgomery Culver was promoted to Associate rank in 1962 and Professor in 1971. Culver served as Director of the Writing program until 1978, when Ed Ochester was appointed to that position. Culver was a short story writer; in the 1960s he published “Lousy Luck” with Esquire (1962) and “The Chance of a Lifetime” with the Saturday Evening Post (1966). Culver was quiet and shy, not someone you would single out as an important presence. And yet he was—both in the department (as an advocate for the Writing Program) and for his students. Lee Gutkind and Andrew Welsh, both students in the 1960s, recall Culver’s work with student manuscripts. Gutkind said, “He was so smart—he knew how to take a pencil to a manuscript and help you on a one-to-one basis in that way.” Welsh, after reviewing some old assignments he had written, said\n\nYou can hear Monty’s voice pushing, pulling, pleading for clean writing, accurate writing, fresh writing—for prose that sees things honestly, that [Montgomery Culver] hears things truly, that moves with the rhythms of something alive, and not dead. It’s impossible to calculate how important those weekly exercises in giving shape to words were to lives trying to take shape themselves. Along with all the knowledge about the various kinds of story-structure and the effects they can create, and about how to handle a moving point of view, or a section of dialect, Monty is able to give you a sense that it’s all worth it; that a good transition from one scene to the next is an action of physical grace, like throwing a good curve ball; that getting a sentence right comes closer than most things to fulfilling your moral nature; that seeing something clearly, as it really is, is a gift to the world it’s in your power to give.\n\nEdwin W. Marrs, Jr. (PhD Syracuse). Marrs was hired as an Assistant Professor in 1967. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1969 and promoted to Professor in the 1970s. His major work was the 3 volume edition of The Letters of Charles and Mary Lamb (Cornell UP; 1975, 1976, 1978).\n\n[Harry J. Mooney, Jr.] Harry J. Mooney, Jr. (PhD Pittsburgh, 1962). Mooney began the decade teaching as an Instructor but was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1962, after completing his degree. He was promoted to Associate rank in 1968 and Professor in the 1970s. Mooney did almost all of his important scholarly work early in his career. In 1957, as a graduate student, he published The Fiction and Criticism of Katherine Anne Porter (U of Pittsburgh P, 1957). This was followed by three books: James Gould Cozzens: Novelist of Intellect (Pittsburgh, 1964); The Shapeless God: Essays in Modern Literature, editor, with Thomas F. Staley (Pittsburgh, 1968); and Leo Tolstoy: The Epic Vision (U of Tulsa, 1969).\n\n[James D. Simmonds] James D. Simmonds (PhD LSU). Simmonds was hired as Assistant Professor in 1965 and promoted to Associate in 1967. He was the founding editor of Milton Studies, a journal sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh Press. The editorial board included English department colleagues Charles Crow, Marcia Landy, and Harry Mooney. The first volume, published in 1969, was devoted to the 300th anniversary of Paradise Lost and occasioned a university sponsored series of lectures on Milton.\n\n[add pdf]\n\nIn 1969, Simmonds prepared a report on “The Personnel Crisis in the English Department,” a report which was said to have helped to create additional tenure track faculty lines in the 1970s. He based the report on a comparison with other departments at the University of Pittsburgh (French, German, Hispanic and Speech) and with the English departments at Penn State and Indiana. He notes the recent increase in faculty lines, but he argues\n\nIf the progress we have made in these matters seems substantial, that is a sign of the length of the journey, not of our having reached port. If we are more satisfied with how far we have come than concerned with how far we have to go, we will deceive ourselves in the same way as the Pittsburgher who thinks he breathes clean air. The Pittsburgh of twenty years ago is no place from which to draw one’s standard of air quality; the English department of two years ago is no place from which to draw one’s standard of an adequately staffed academic program.\n\nAssistant Professors\n\nDonald Tritschler left the department in 1962 to take a position at Skidmore College where, in 1967, he was listed as an Associate Professor of English.\n\nDaniel Marder left the department in 1962 for the University of Tulsa, where he served as Professor and department Chair. Marder published The Craft of Technical Writing (Macmillan, 1960), the edited volume, Hugh Henry Brackenridge (Twayne, 1967), Exiles at Home: A Story of Literature in 19th Century America (University Press of America, 1984) and The Arnold/Andre Transcripts: A Reconstruction (Library Research Associates, 1993).\n\n[Robert C. Laing, Jr.] Robert C. Laing, Jr. (PhD, Pittsburgh 1962) was hired as an Assistant Professor in 1962. In 1964 he left to join the faculty at the University of Pittsburgh, Bradford, where he taught until 1981. Laing was active in local theater. The University of Pittsburgh at Bradford offers a Robert C. Laing, Jr., Creative Arts Award.\n\nArthur H. Saxon (PhD Yale) completed his BA at the University of Pittsburgh in 1956. He received his MA from Columbia in English and Comparative Literature and his PhD in the History of the Theatre and Dramatic Criticism from Yale. Saxon returned to the University of Pittsburgh in 1966, where he taught for two years in Speech and Theater and one year, 1968/1969, as an Assistant Professor in the English department. Saxon has published widely on theater, circus, and popular entertainment. He was a Guggenheim fellow in 1971. He is author of Enter Foot and Horse: A History of Hippodrama in England and France (Yale UP, 1968); The Life and Art of Andrew Ducrow & The Romantic Age of the English Circus (Archon 1978); and the award-winning P. T. Barnum: The Legend and the Man (Columbia UP, 1989). He is also the editor of Barnum’s letters. Saxon’s yet unpublished memoir contains recollections of Charles Crow. You can read an excerpt. [add pdf]\n\n[W. Austin Flanders] W. Austin Flanders (PhD Wisconsin) was hired as an Assistant Professor in 1964 and promoted to Associate in 1969. He taught graduate seminars on 18th century British literature and a wide range of undergraduate literature courses. Flanders was involved in the attempts to establish a Comparative Literature Program at the University. His essay on Defoe’s Journal of the Plague Year (Centennial Review, 1972) was reprinted in Daniel Defoe: A Collection of Critical Essays (Prentice Hall, 1975). He was the author of Structures of Experience: History, Society, and Personal Life in the 18th Century British Novel (U of South Carolina P, 1984). Flanders served on the editorial board of Eighteenth Century Life.\n\n[Robert Marshall] Robert Marshall (PhD Wisconsin) was hired as an Assistant Professor in 1964 and promoted to Associate rank in 1969. Trained as a medievalist, Marshall taught graduate courses in Anglo-Saxon language and literature, Chaucer, the 14th century, and medieval drama. He taught a range of undergraduate courses including freshman composition, freshman honors, and the literature of sport. Marshall was involved with the Pittsburgh community through Project Upward Bound (1966-69), a program of support for low-income, under-achieving high school students. He was Co-director of Project Exchange (1968-69) which arranged two-week faculty exchanges between the University of Pittsburgh and two historically black colleges, Alabama State College and Jackson State College. In the 1970s, Marshall initiated and directed the English component of a federally sponsored program, TTT (Training the Trainers of Teachers), designed to bring faculty from the disciplines into productive contact with teachers and subject area programs in Schools of Education. From 1969-1971 he was the department’s “Coordinator of Innovation,” head of a committee directed to rethink the undergraduate curriculum and the training of Teaching Assistants. Marshall was active in the AAUP, serving as President for several years in the mid-70s.\n\nIn 1972, Marshall was one of three individuals presented by the department to the Dean of Faculty in Arts and Sciences, Jerome Rosenberg, as candidates to follow Robert Whitman as department chair. Whitman had resigned; Walt Evert was serving as the Acting Chair. Marshall was the only internal candidate of the three. The other two were Michael Shugrue, director of English programs (and the ADE) for the MLA, and Robert Hinman, the chair at Emory. The Dean had made it clear that he wanted an outside candidate, someone to help move the department to national prominence in research, and there were hints that with the right choice, the department would receive additional faculty lines. The appointment went to Robert Hinman, who took over as chair in 1973. Marshall had long been an advocate for teaching; he was active in promoting curriculum experimentation and curriculum reform, both in the department and in the College, and, in 1973, he was appointed Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, serving as a Dean of students and undergraduate programs, a position he held until 1978.\n\nJames D. Merritt (PhD Wisconsin) was hired as Lecturer in 1964 and promoted to Assistant in 1965. He left in 1966 for Brooklyn College, where he taught until his retirement in 1995.\n\n[Philip K. Wion] Philip K. Wion (PhD Yale) was hired as an Assistant Professor in 1967 and promoted to Associate in 1973. Wion (rhymes with “lion,” he told his students) worked in the areas of Renaissance literature and of literature and psychoanalysis. His essay on “The Absent Mother in Wuthering Heights,” American Imago (1985), was reprinted in the casebook, Wuthering Heights, edited by Linda Peterson (Bedford/St. Martins, 2003). Wion was very active in faculty governance, initially at the departmental level, where he was at the center of the group that wrote the English Department’s By-Laws, and later with the University Senate and the American Association of University Professors. He served multiple terms on Faculty Assembly and Senate Council, and on the Senate Budget Policies Committee (several as chair). He co-chaired the committee that devised the University’s Planning and Budgeting System, and served multiple terms on the University Planning and Budgeting Committee. He was president of the United Faculty (dually affiliated with the AAUP and the American Federation of Teachers) during the ‘80s and early ‘90s, at the height of the (unsuccessful) effort to win collective bargaining rights for Pitt faculty, and continued as an officer of the Pitt AAUP chapter beyond his retirement from the University in 2009.\n\n[James F. Knapp] James F. Knapp (PhD Connecticut), still an active member of the faculty, was hired as an Assistant Professor in 1966. He is currently Professor of English and Senior Associate Dean of the Deitrich School of Arts and Sciences. Knapp is the author of Ezra Pound (Twayne, 1979), the Norton Poetry Workshop, a multi-media CD-ROM published in conjunction with the Norton Anthology of Poetry, (W.W. Norton & Co, 1996), and Literary Modernism and the Transformation of Work (Northwestern UP, 1998). He has published widely in academic journals with essays on such topics as primitivism in modern art, nationalism, modern poetry, and the culture of modernity. He teaches graduate and undergraduate courses on literary and cultural history, including Anglo-Irish literature, and Modernism in literature and the visual arts. Knapp has integrated multi-media computer technology into his teaching for many years. In 2005, he turned his attention to the Web as editor of the Norton Poetry Workshop Online. He is a past chair of the Modern Language Association’s Committee on Information Technology.\n\nKnapp provided leadership in a variety of roles in the English department, during difficult (and sometimes contentious) periods of curriculum review and through an extended period as Director of Graduate Studies. Since 2000, Knapp has provided crucial leadership as Associate and then Senior Associate Dean of the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences. As a Dean, he has taken the lead in a number of crucial and controversial areas of administration, but none have been as central to the work of the English department as his consistent efforts to develop a full-time, non-tenure-track faculty with substantial benefits and a place in departmental and university governance.\n\n[Marcia Landy] Marcia Landy (PhD Rochester), who will retire in January 2015, was hired as an Assistant Professor in 1967. Landy was recruited as a Renaissance scholar to teach and write on the poetry of John Milton, but she quickly became a key figure in the reconfiguration of English studies both on our campus and nationally, efforts that led the nation. Early in her time in the department, she began to work on European literature. In the early 1970s, she taught the first courses on women at the University of Pittsburgh and was the primary author of the proposal to establish the Women’s Studies program (1971). In the 1970s, Landy served on the organizing committee of the Comparative Literature Program and later as its co-chair, with Edward Dudley of Hispanic Languages and Literatures. Courses in film were listed in the curriculum of Comp Lit—initially one developed by Landy and Daniel Russell, from French and Italian, another by Landy and Mariolina Salvatori, from English. With Bill Judson, Carnegie Museum Director of Film, and Bruce Goldstein, Psychology, Landy was appointed to a committee charged to develop an undergraduate Film Studies Program. Once approved, the new interdisciplinary Film Studies program was housed in the English Department and, in 1979, Lucy Fischer was hired to serve as Director. Since the late 1970s, the Film Studies Program has become an important part of the undergraduate and graduate mission of the College, and its students, faculty, and research have achieved international renown.\n\nLandy is currently Distinguished Professor of English/Film Studies with a secondary appointment in French and Italian. She remains an extraordinarily productive teacher and scholar. Her books include Fascism in Film: The Italian Commercial Cinema, 1931-1943 (1986); Imitations of Life: A Reader on Film and Television Melodrama (1991), British Genres: Cinema and Society, 1930-1960 (1991); Film, Politics, and Gramsci (1994); Queen Christina (1996, with Amy Villarejo); Cinematic Uses of the Past (1996); The Folklore of Consensus: Theatricality and Spectacle in Italian Cinema 1930-1943 (1998); Italian Film (2000); The Historical Film: History and Memory in Media (2000); Stars: The Film Reader (2004 co-edited with Lucy Fischer); Monty Python’s Flying Circus (2005), and Stardom, Italian Style: Screen Performance and Personality in Italian Cinema (2008). Her essays on cultural theory, cinema history, national cinema, and genres have appeared in anthologies and in such journals as Screen, Post Script, Jump Cut, Film Criticism, The Journal of Film and Video, New German Critique, French Review, American Imago, Critical Quarterly and Cinema Journal. Her articles on Gramsci have appeared in Rethinking Marxism, boundary 2, and Critical Studies. She was the recipient of the 2005 Chancellor's Senior Research Award. In 2007, Landy was appointed Distinguished Professor of English and Film Studies; in 2014 she won the Provost’s award for Excellence in Mentoring, an award which recognized her successful work with generations of graduate students. As a teacher, she has been a central figure for both graduate and undergraduates interested in history, visual media, and theory.\n\nBarrett J. Mandell (PhD Connecticut) was hired as an Assistant Professor in 1968. He left in 1970 to take a position at Douglas College, Rutgers University. Mandell was interested in alternative forms of teaching, including “self-directed” classes or “nondirective” teaching. He published essays on the teaching of reading and writing and was the author of Literature and the English Department (NCTE, 1970) and Three Language-Arts Curriculum Models: Pre-Kindergarten Through College (NCTE, 1980). He also wrote on autobiography. He left Rutgers to become an Adjunct Associate Professor in the Graduate School of Business Administration, Fordham University. In 1981, he founded SWG Consulting Resources, a company that provides communication and time-management courses to the business community.\n\nWilliam Searle (PhD UC Berkeley) hired as an Assistant Professor in 1968 and promoted to Associate Professor in 1973.

She also published essays on 18th century British literature and was a founding editor of Eighteenth Century Life. During her nearly 30 years at Pitt, Sutherland taught literature and writing courses ranging from 18th-century literature to Shakespeare, children's literature, women and literature, and myth and folktale. She was active in the development of Women’s Studies on our campus and taught courses in the program’s early years.\n\n[Rae Lee Siporin] Rae Lee Siporin (PhD UCLA) was hired as an Assistant Professor in 1968.

Siporin edited the 1972 Proceedings of the Conference, “Women and Education: A Feminist Perspective,” a collection of papers on the “state and future of women’s studies and the position of women in the academy” sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh and the MLA Commission on the Status of Women. Siporin left Pittsburgh in the mid-70s to serve as Dean at Stockton State College in New Jersey. She went from there to Franklin Pierce College in New Hampshire and from Franklin Pierce, in 1979, to UCLA where she served for 22 years as the Director of Admissions.

In 1986, Petesch was a Fulbright Lecturer in American Studies at the University of Monterrey, Mexico.\n\nChristopher Rawson (PhD Washington) joined the department in 1968 as an Instructor and was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1972, after completing his degree. Although hired as a specialist in 18th Century literature, he taught broadly in the undergraduate curriculum, including a course in satire that grew to 100 and attracted attention for its use of visual materials and its blend of Horace and Pogo, Swift and Lenny Bruce. Rawson taught critical writing, Irish drama, Shakespeare, and Pittsburgh playwright August Wilson, with whom he had developed a friendship through his role as a local theater critic. Rawson continues to teach Shakespeare and Wilson today (2014). In the 1960s, Rawson played an active role working to revise and revive the humanities curriculum, and from 1974-77 he served as the department’s Associate Chair.\n\n[Christopher Rawson] From 1983 to 2009, he was also theater critic and theater editor at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, covering theater in Pittsburgh, New York, London and Canada. In 1984, he started the Post-Gazette Performer of the Year Award, now in its 31st year. Rawson serves on the editorial board of the Best Plays Theater Annual, is a board member of the American Theatre Hall of Fame, has twice served as chair of the American Theatre Critics Association (1991-93 and 2007-11), and produces an annual satire of Pittsburgh news and newsmakers, Off the Record. In 1999, he wrote Where Stone Walls Meet the Sea, a 650-page centennial history of the summer colony and golf club in Little Compton, Rhode Island, important because of its course, the personal design of Donald Ross. With Laurence A. Glasco (University of Pittsburgh history department), he is the author of August Wilson: Pittsburgh Places in His Life and Plays (Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation, 2011). Their larger work, August Wilson's Pittsburgh, is expected in 2015 (University of Pittsburgh Press).\n\n[Virginia Elliott] Virginia Elliott joined the department in 1967 as a Lecturer through a joint appointment with the School of Education, where she had been a member of the faculty since 1965. As Edwin Peterson moved toward retirement, Elliott was brought in to direct the Composition Program, to train the graduate assistants, and to coordinate the pool of non-tenure track instructors. With Lois Josephs, a PhD student in the department, she prepared and edited an NCTE report on English for the Academically Talented Student in the Secondary School (1969). She held the position of Director of Composition until 1974, when William E. Coles, Jr., was recruited for that position. Elliott also taught courses in children’s literature and women’s studies.\n\nInstructors/Lecturers\n\nThe College catalog stopped routinely listing non-tenure track faculty in 1960; it stopped listing them altogether in 1965.\n\nThose present in the catalog in the first few years and/or recalled by former students:\n\nMarcus T. Allias\n\nRaymond J. Cristina\n\nWilliam Hickman\n\nSydney A. Kneebone\n\nDorothy O’Connor\n\nMary Cooper Robb\n\nBetty Anne Stroup\n\nBy the 1960s, the number of BA and MA students had grown so considerably, and the records are so readily available, that we couldn’t begin to list them all or to provide brief biographies.
