        "text": "Abraham meets the Lord in the form of three strangers at the Oaks of Mamre and hastens to show hospitality. He and his wife are given a great blessing in the form of a child - Isaac - and the rest of the human race is blessed through that child. But as poet Rilke says, \"Every angel is terrifying\" - hence their call, \"Be not afraid!\"\n\nArtists, like angels, are sometimes troubling... and for good reason. Often wrestling with settled ideas and rejecting predictable patterns, they serve up images and ideas that challenge and upset us, but we need their uncomfortable blessings to show us new ways to see ourselves, our communities, and our Lord.\n\nIn this talk, Bruce Herman, one of our most important living Christian artists, will reflect on his own work and the work of the artist as \"needed outsider.\""
