        "text": "Celebrating 50 Years\n\nWelcome to our Timeline\n\nThis timeline is a journey through the evolution of Washington State University’s art museum, an institution that has evolved and flourished since its inception in 1974 as the Museum of Art/WSU. Initially nestled within the Fine Arts Center, the museum quickly gained acclaim for hosting world-class exhibitions, artists, and scholars. Decades later in 2018, and through the generosity of Jordan Schnitzer and many other donors, the museum inaugurated a majestic purpose-built facility at the very heart of the WSU Pullman campus. As we contemplate our shared history, we anticipate the museum’s ongoing role as a dynamic center for the arts, nurturing a sense of community and purpose for future generations.\n\nWe extend our heartfelt gratitude to our donors and museum friends, and past museum staff, whose unwavering support and tireless work has been integral to our journey. It is a remarkable and undeniable fact that it has been the hundreds and hundreds of people over the last 50 years who have carried, and cared for, the essential tenet that the arts fundamentally express and improve our shared humanity.\n\nWe have additional events happening on September 27, 2024.\n\nLearn more about our related events for\n\nThe Art of Food: From the Collections of Jordan D. Schnitzer and His Family Foundation.\n\nTimeline\n\nWe have curated a digital timeline from a list of approximately 390 exhibitions that have been on display at WSU’s art museum. Explore our curated selection below.\n\nUse the buttons below to navigate to different decades, or keep scrolling to explore all 50 years!\n\n1970s\n\n1974\n\nThe Museum of Art is founded in the new Fine Arts Center to develop exhibitions of educational merit and to care for the University’s art holdings.\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nGreco-Roman artifacts produced by the ancient craftsmen and purchased by the J. Paul Getty Museum of Malibu, CA will be exhibited along with works of two later European masters, Francisco Goya (Spanish 1746 – 1828) and Honore Daumier (French 1808 – 1979). Museum of Art Publication: Goya: Los Disparates. The University’s Holland Library agreed to lend its collection of 18 of the 22 known Goya etchings titled the Proverb Series, as well as 20 select Daumier lithographs, which constitute his noted satire on antiquity. These prints represents a span of nearly 2,000 years. Finally, a collection of ancient Northwest Indian tools and there modern counterparts will be displayed. These tools were loaned by the Pacific Northwest Indian Center of Spokane, WA.\n\nLecture/Reception: Dr. Jiri Frel, Curator of Antiquities of The J. Paul Getty Museum, and Mr. Stephen Garret, Deputy Director of the Museum, Oct. 11, 7:30pm, FA Aud. – reception following in Museum.\n\nPoster Description:\n\nOctober will be highlighted by four exhibitions which represent the concepts and skills of past artists:\n\nRecent Acquisitions, Ancient Art\n\nThe J. Paul Getty Museum, Mailbu, California\n\nFrancisco Goya (Spanish 1746-1828): Proverb Series, 18 Etchings\n\nHonore Damier (French 1808-1879): 20 lithographs\n\nAncient Northwest Indian Tools and their Modern Counterparts\n\nThe central exhibit is to be a collection of recently purchased Greco-Roman artifacts by The J. Paul Getty Museum of Mailbu, California, and loaned to Washington State University. Dr. Jiri Frel, Curator of Antiquities, Getty Museum, and Mr. Stephen Garrett, Deputy Director of the Museum, will present lectures October 11 at 7:30 p.m. in the Fine Arts Auditorium on the ancient art collection. A reception in the Gallery honoring the two speakers will follow the lectures.\n\nThese priceless art objects produced by ancient Greek and Roman craftsmen will be accomplished by works of two later European masters, Francisco Goya (Spanish 1746 – 1828) and Honore Daumier (French 1808-1879). The University’s Holland Library has graciously agreed to lend its collection of 18 of the 22 known Goya etchings from the Proverb Series, as well as 20 select Daumier lithographs, which constitute his noted satire on antiquity. These magnificent prints will offer an elegant contrast in artistic concepts, which represent a span of over 2,000 years.\n\nThe fourth October exhibit is a collection of ancient Northwest Indian tools and their modern counterparts. These ancient tools will reflect the resourcefulness and simplicity of the early artists and imply similarities with tools of today. The ancient tools were loaned to the University by the pacific Northwest Indian Center of Spokane.\n\nDuring his presidency (1915-1945), Ernest 0. Holland purchased more than 100 valuable paintings at feasible prices. He kept an expansive correspondence with art dealers and artists as he assembled this impressive collection of 19th and early 20th century works by American and European artists. Through the lean years of the Great Depression, Holland covered the costs with the President’s Emergency Fund. When Holland died in 1950, he left his personal art collection to the university with the provision that it be displayed in a proper exhibition space on campus and protected against “loss by fire or theft or damage by water or mutilation.”\n\nThese luminous works came to the College through purchases made by President Ernest O. Holland. As the longest serving president in WSU history, Holland’s tenure stretched from 1915 to 1945. During those years, and throughout the Great Depression, he assembled a collection of art he hoped would identify the greatest painters of the day and inspire faculty, staff, and students. Financial support came from Regent Charles W. Orton who contributed funds to support Holland’s ambitious collecting efforts at a time when resources were scarce.\n\nIn 1935, President Ernest 0. Holland and the Regents granted art professor Worth D. Griffin a leave of absence with salary and all expenses paid to complete a sweeping portrait project of individuals especially valuable to the welfare of Washington State College. Created in homes, offices, hotel rooms, and school rooms, Griffin painted more than 50 portraits of publishers, educators, state officials, and other prominent individuals in eastern Washington. While completing these portraits, Griffin sought an extension of his commission to paint portraits of prominent Native American tribal leaders and members. Pursued partially on the belief the culture and customs of the Plateau tribes were endangered, Griffin sought to create “a pictorial record of certain active and influential members of various tribes for their public-spirited contributions to their communities.” Griffin completed 45 portraits between 1935 and 1936 in advance of co-founding the Nespelem Art Colony with his colleague Clyfford Still on the Colville Indian Reservation.\n\n1975\n\nMuseum of Art becomes one of five founding members of the Washington Art Consortium, a group of art museums in the state comprised to share collections of works on paper and photography (later expanded to 7 member institutions).\n\nRecognizing the importance of preserving America’s art, in 1975 a group of individuals, organized by the Seattle patron Virginia Wright, devised a novel and ambitious plan to form a survey of American art of the post-war era, from 1945 – 1975. The collection would not belong to any one museum. Instead, it would be treated as a shared resource for institutions in Washington State and the nation. The works themselves would be drawings and works on paper, easy to transport and easy to handle.\n\nThe Washington Art Consortium evolved and became the first organization of its type in the nation. The Consortium is a unique partnership of seven institutions that agreed to work together to acquire and care for a major collection of works on paper and photographs by important American artists of the twentieth century. Today the Consortium’s membership includes: the Western Gallery, Western Washington University, Bellingham; the Museum of Art, Washington State University, Pullman; the Tacoma Art Museum; the Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture, Spokane; the Whatcom Museum of History and Art, Bellingham; the Henry Gallery of the University of Washington, Seattle; and the Seattle Art Museum.\n\nToday, the Consortium holds three significant collections. The Consortium’s first two collections, Works on Paper: American Art 1945-1975 and American Photographs: 1970-1980, were acquired through the Virginia Wright Fund and a matching grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. The third collection was donated in 1988 by Mary and Richard Aiken, and focuses on prints by American artists from mid century to the present, such as Jacob Lawrence, Jennifer Bartlett and Susan Rothenberg. Combined, the collections represent many of the most notable artists of the latter half of the 20th century.\n\nThe WAC disbanded in 2017.\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nGuest Curator: Curt Sherman, Assistant Professor, Interior Design, Washington State University\n\nPoster Description:\n\nThe exhibition of chairs will attempt to trace the development of the chair from its earliest appearances to its latest manifestations. We will see its evolvement from a simply crafted object to a product of advanced technology. The chair for over 2,000 years has been a symbol of status, of wealth and position. Its early usage set its occupant apart from the rest of his fellows, first by simply raising him to a higher plane and later by the height of the back or the elaborateness of its ornamentation.\n\nIn the past this everyday object, made for convenience and pleasure, reflected both the personalities of its owner and its creator. Before the Industrial Revolution, a chair was designed in collaboration between its owner and its craftsman, each contributing something to the whole. Today most chairs are mass-produced. This has meant a standardization of forms to some extent, but it has also meant a greater variety of seating is available to a larger percentage of the population.\n\nThe chair, no less than a painting, piece of sculpture, or work of architecture, reflects the creative capacity of a civilization. Like other works of art, a chair is judged on the manner in which its creator has handled line, form, space, proportion and materials, as well as function and comfort.\n\n1976\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nPoster Description\n\nRodin: The Marhill Collection\n\nFebruary 4 – February 29, 1976\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nPoster Description\n\nOrganized by the Museum of Art, this exhibition also traveled to Henry Art Gallery, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, January 2nd – February 2nd, 1976 Olin Gallery, Whitman College, Walla Walla, WA, March 6- March 25, 1976.\n\n1977\n\nFriends of the Museum is founded as a 501c3 to support the Museum of Art.\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nPoster Description\n\nWorks on Paper: American art 1945- 1975 was an exhibition put together from the Washington art Consortium Collection. The Washington Art Consortium was organized in 1975 by four institutions: Cheney Cowles Memorial State Museum, Spokane; Museum of Art, Washington State University, Pullman; Tacoma Art Museum, Tacoma; The Western Gallery, Western Washington State College, Bellingham; The Consortium, the first organization of its type in the nation, is a unique partnership of four museums who have agreed to work together to acquire jointly a major collection of works on paper by important American artists of the twentieth century. Funds for this project were provided by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Virginia Wright Fund, Seattle.\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nPoster Description\n\nApril 11 – May 1, 1977\n\nSpring Selection: Goya: Los Disparates; Robert Smithson: Cayuga Salt Mine Project; People of the Cedar\n\nBack to Timeline\n\n1980s\n\n1980\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nThe Earthworks exhibit was the result of a project sponsored by the King County Arts Commission to reclaim 104 abandoned gravel pits in King County, WA and make them into a medium for the selected artists’ artistic expressions. The initial stage of the project was a symposium and plans, photographs, models and maquettes created for the symposium, which form the crux of the exhibit along with an explanatory catalog. Among the artists selected to participate were Robert Morris, Iain Baxter, Mary Miss, Dennis Oppenheim, Beverly Pepper, Richard Fleischner, and Lawrence Hanson. Hanson was a participant also in the Northwest Sculpture exhibit at the WSU Museum of Art in 1975.\n\nThe Darius Kinsey Collection is 63 photographs of fifty years of photo images of the Northwest character (landscape, commercial, homesteading, loggers and logging, shingle mills and lumber yards) from the late 1800’s through the early 1900’s. Darius and Takitha Kinsey were a husband and wife team; he took the pictures and she developed and made prints of them. The entire collection is owned by the Whatcom Museum of History & Art, Bellingham, WA.\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nPoster Description\n\nOctober 20 – November 19, 1980\n\nSpeakers: Rudy Autio, Garth Clark, William Daly, Sanford Shaman, Betty Woodman\n\n1981\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nBritish print exhibition of 70 prints by 45 artists working with traditional techniques such as lithography, etching, woodcut, etc., including more innovative works employing photographic techniques, offset lithography and industrial methods.

The founders of the Noritake factory were the Morimura Brothers and the head of the New York design staff was Englishman Cyril Leigh. Their homebase was Nagoya, Japan with offices in New York. Their homebase factory was bombed during WWII and most of their records and examples documenting Noritake’s production were destroyed. Dr. Howard Kottler, UW professor and Seattle based ceramic artist, assembled over 500 examples of Noritake 1921-41 “fancy ware” by frequenting antique shops, second-hand stores, and flea markets throughout the United States. The exhibit is organized by the WSU Museum of Art in cooperation with the WSU Dept. of Fine Arts and the East and South Asia Program. The exhibit is scheduled for a two-year international tour and has been developed for circulation by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service.

Holland was President of Washington State College (WSC) from 1916 to 1944. During those years he assembled a collection of art which he hoped would identify the great painters of the day. He personally donated 40 of those paintings to the college and 30 of those pieces will be on display during this exhibit. The Holland exhibit can be divided into three collections: his privately donated collection; the collection which he assembled with funds provided by Charles Orton, a former WSC regent; and paintings by WSC fine arts faculty member Worth D. Griffin.\n\nExhibit composed of pieces from Holland Library; Manuscripts, Archives and Special Collections; the WSU Museum of Art permanent collection, etc., by a number of artists in a variety of media.\n\nA painting from the WSU Museum of Art permanent collection, “Evening Landscape” by 19th century American master George Inness (painted in 1862), was among the works which toured the country as part of a major retrospective exhibition of Inness’s work. The exhibit, organized by Michael Quick of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, opened on Mon., Apr. 1, 1985 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and visited five major metropolitan areas in the country over 17 months and finished its tour at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. “Evening Landscape” was donated to WSU in 1948 by Dr. and Mrs. William E.

Support for this project came from the director of the museum, Patricia Watkinson, and the Friends of the Museum board, who were tireless fundraisers of the museum. The Friends of the Museum were a group of museum members who not only donated but also volunteered their time and effort to support the museum’s mission and vision. Their dedication to the museum came in many forms, and resulted in a tightly knit art-enthusiast community who enabled the art museum to share the wonders of art with WSU students, the region, and the nation.\n\nThe Museum of Art Friends Fund supports daily operations, exhibitions, education, marketing, and impacts our visitors, staff, and students.\n\nEstablished in 1987 by WSU alumnus Sean Elwood, the Karen E.

It was the eve of World War II, and Joan Jarvis and her two good friends saw everything from monasteries to art museums, as well as evidence of the coming war. Returning to Washington, Joan gave some 100 speeches on her travels before marrying Bob Jarvis, whom she had met as a student at Washington State College. Both earned degrees in 1937; Joan in English, and Bob in electrical engineering. “Then the war snapped us up,” said Joan.\n\nBob served with the 47th Engineers, a battalion of advanced engineers who prepared islands for occupation by American forces. When he returned home in 1945, he and Joan moved to Ephrata, then settled in Spokane. In 1949, their daughter, Constance, was born.\n\nFor most of his career, Bob was a partner in Ace Concrete, retiring before continuing to work with Central Pre-Mix. He is now truly retired and working happily for various charities. Joan was a volunteer in her community and served as a docent for the Seattle, Bellevue, and Spokane art museums. Joan’s trip to Europe sparked her love for art history, and she and Bob established the Robert and Joan Jarvis Endowment for the WSU Museum of Art. The fund advances the museum’s mission of educational outreach and will also further appreciation for the arts, sparking interest for generations to come.\n\n1996\n\nWilliam T.

Mildred Sherrod Bissinger grew up in Tekoa, Washington, and graduated from Washington State College in 1933 with a B.A. in English. For many years, Mildred maintained a deep interest and loyalty to WSU, supporting several areas of the university, including the Libraries, the Potter Fund, and the Museum of Art.\n\nIn her time, Mildred underwrote museum exhibitions, staff development and general operations, and donated many fine prints for the museum’s collection. This endowment is an expression of her sincere belief in the museum and its role in the education of WSU students, and solidified her desire to see the museum flourish in the future. It is also a testimony to her own belief in the arts as vital for life as well as a testimony to her life, lived in enjoyment of the arts.\n\n1999\n\nFrom the Archives:\n\nOrganized by Spelman College, Atlanta, and toured by ExhibitsUSA\n\nOver 60 works of art by 24 artists working in a variety of mediums.\n\nCreation Location: “Collage” Carol Scally, WSU Museum of Art Education Coordinator, an art project for kids to work on & display, area set up for the length of the exhibit.\n\nBack to Timeline\n\n2000s\n\n2000\n\nFrom the Archives:\n\nSeptember 11 – October 15, 2000\n\nFeatures previously unexhibited, rare sculptural works from the private collection of this well-known American visionary artist begun in Ireland in the late 1950s and recently completed.

In addition the Museum has developed a Permanent Collection of art which has grown over the years to include more than 2000 works, many by contemporary artists of the northwest.\n\nIn this new millennium the Museum of Art is expanding its educational outreach to schools and communities in the Palouse, and also plans to provide space to host social events for University departments and other organizations which meet on campus. We are positioning ourselves to be the cultural meeting place for all the members of the University community.\n\nOur first exhibition of the 2001-2002 season The Raw and the Cooked* consists of objects from the many museums and collections around the University. We want to widen the definition of art (and collecting) so that viewers can, in one place, share the excitement and beauty of the things that in our academic world are usually kept in separate boxes. Our reference point was the 17th century “cabinet of curiosities” (Wunderkammer) …collections of unfamiliar objects brought back by early European explorers…fossils, carvings, strange plants, stuffed mermaids, unicorn horns and unfamiliar animals…the ancestor of our contemporary museums.\n\nThere are many people to thanks for The Raw and the Cooked: the Museum staff for their willingness to indulge a new Director and to work together on very short notice on the exhibition’ the curators and directors of the museums and collections on the campus who have been willing lenders and enthusiastic supporters of this project; Roger Rowley and Amy Mooney for their insightful essays; the Friends of the Museum of Art as well as private donors; the Office of University Publications and Printing, and Delphine Keim-Campbell and William Wise for the catalog design.\n\nThe new motto of Washington State University is “World Class, Face to Face.” What better place to have that experience than at the Museum of Art where the visitor can literally stand face to face with the world class art on display.\n\nWe hope to see you here.\n\nRoss Coates\n\nInterim Director\n\n*If you are quite curious about the title, search under Claude Levi-Strauss\n\n2002\n\nFrom the Archives:\n\nThis exhibition from the exceptional Schnitzer collections highlights work by international recognized artists working with multiples from 1997 to 2001. “Multiples” covers a host of different media that by their very nature have some relationship to issues of production and popular culture. Though mostly different forms of prints, from lithographs to aquatints and silkscreens, the exhibition also includes a grocery sack, a marble bench and an inflatable sculpture. The exhibition consists of 54 works created in the last 5 years by 23 artists of international, national, and regional reputation including Louise Bourgeois, Chuck Close, Robert Colescott, Jenny Holzer, Jeff Koons, Robert Longo, Kiki Smith and Kara Walker among others. The exhibition was organized by The Art Gym, Marylhurst University and the Hallie Ford Museum of Art, Willamette University.\n\n2003\n\nFrom the Archives:\n\nArt in 2 Worlds: The Native American Fine Art Invitational 1983-1997 celebrates the creativity and innovation of Native American artists by bringing together fifty-two works by forty-eight Native American artists from the Heard Museum’s (Phoenix, AZ) seven invitational exhibitions from 1983 to 1997. Working in a variety of media, including oil and acrylic paint, watercolor, pastel, sculpture, ceramics, lithography, etching, serigraphy, and mixed media, the forty-eight artists represented in this exhibition shatter stereotypes of Indian art and afford viewers the opportunity to expand their understanding and gain insight into the Native American Fine Art Movement. The artists in Art in 2 Worlds bring to their work a wide array of backgrounds, cultures, and worldviews. Blake Debassige says about his work, “I feel that I am still carrying on a tradition of picture writing, using art as the way of making a statement. The whole thing is a way of communicating to the world.”\n\nPoster Description\n\nOrganized by the Heard Museum, Phoenix, AZ., the exhibit showcases 52 works by 48 artists, from around the U.S. and Canada. The Annual Invitational has sought to recognize artists who produce artwork that does not conform to the more traditional anthropological approach to Indian art, but rather create art that explores new technologies and media as contemporary expressions of living cultures.\n\nFrom the Archives:\n\nRichard Weisman grew up in a family dedicated to art. Living in New York in the 1970s, he collected some of the most important names in art and traveled in Andy Warhol’s circle of friends. Weisman will speak on his experiences, do a signing of his book Picasso to Pop, and meet with students. In 1979, Weisman commissioned Warhol to create his well known Athletes Series, in which the artist photographed ten famous athletes of the day, and then made a series of vibrant paintings. The paintings will be on special view at the Museum of Art for five days only, along with Warhol’s landmark Campbell’s Soup print & Self-Portrait, also from the Weisman collection.

But by mid-decade, that perspective was being challenged by artists. Art and Context examines how art relates to a society bombarded by advertising while also in the midst of a cultural revolution.\n\nPublished December 2006 – Distributed by JSMA WSU and WSU Press, Washington State University, Pullman, WA\n\n2007\n\nThe Robert A. and Winona P.

Rosa’s career was focused on understanding the relationships between technology, the environment, and the social world. As an artist, Rosa created “ecolages,” by re-purposing abandoned objects, and furthered his appreciation of the arts by connecting with the Museum of Art at Washington State University. Eugene Rosa, who passed away in 2013, frequently visited the art museum.\n\nMany people find art, especially abstract or provocative art, intimidating. This may even be more true of those who, by virtue of rural residence, have little or no exposure to the great museums clustered and distanced from them in urban areas.\n\nEugene Rosa\n\nLearn more about the Buy A Bus program and our work today.\n\nIn 2008, the Museum of Art was awarded a gift of over 100 original Polaroid photographs and 50 silver gelatin prints by Andy Warhol from the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.

Helm and his wife Tammy continued to live and work in their studios between Pullman and Moscow until he passed away in 2008.\n\n2013\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nExhibition Dates: September 20 – December 14, 2013\n\nThis exhibit pairs two of the most influential and complex artists in the Pop art genre, with a selection of prints that spans each artist’s career.\n\nSo, two Pop artists – one East Coast, the other West Coast; one “hot,” the other “cool.” Both James Rosenquist and Ed Ruscha grew up in the midwest in the 1940s, but Rosenquist went to New York (from Minnesota) and Ruscha went to Los Angeles (from Oklahoma).\n\nBoth artists worked as commercial artists early in their careers: Rosenquist was a billboard painter; Ruscha a layout artist for an advertising agency. Both artists reveled in the mind-opening poetics of ordinary everyday imagery: Rosenquist in his wild smash-ups of seemingly disjointed imagery; Ruscha in his use of words as image.\n\nYou could say that Rosenquist expressed the intense compression of imagery he encountered in New York, while Ruscha responded to the more isolated, horizontal and open spaces of Southern California.\n\nBoth artists have made prints in parallel to their paintings, throughout their long careers.\n\nAll works in the exhibition come from the vast collection of contemporary prints and multiples from Jordan D. Schnitzer and the Jordan Schnitzer Family Foundation. We are grateful for his passion for art and his generous loans so our audience can experience such a wide range of work by these two modern masters.\n\n2014\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nExhibition: September 19 — December 13, 2014\n\nReception: Thursday, September 18, 6:00 p.m., Museum of Art/WSU\n\nLecture: (Roger Shimomura) September 18, 7 p.m., Fine Arts Auditorium\n\nA survey exhibition of the work of Lawrence, Kansas-based artist, Roger Shimomura, whose paintings and prints address sociopolitical issues of Asian America. He does this through a painting style that combines his childhood interest in comic books, American Pop Art and traditions of Japanese woodblock prints, thereby evoking his Japanese ancestry while locating him firmly within modern American artistic developments.\n\nThe Publication\n\nFor four decades Roger Shimomura’s paintings, prints and theater pieces have addressed artistic forms and sociopolitical issues of Asian America. This publication was produced by Museum of Art and WSU Press. Introduction by Chris Bruce, and essay and interview by Anne Collins Goodyear.\n\n2015\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nExhibition: January 12 – April 3, MOA Gallery\n\nReception: Thursday, January 22, 6-8 pm, Featuring Dennis DeHart, MOA Gallery\n\nThe Washington State University Museum of Art is proud to present two distinct exhibitions in Through the Lens: An American Century – Corbis & Vivian Maier, which explore the personal and public uses of photography featuring some of the most famous images in history and – with a recent discovery – the most private. The exhibition opens January 12, 2015 and runs through April 3, 2015.\n\nA public reception will be held 6 pm Thursday, Jan. 22, in the Museum of Art/WSU gallery with a talk, “What makes a lasting image”, given by photography professor Dennis DeHart. An additional public reception will be held 6 pm Thursday, Feb. 12, in the Museum of Art/WSU gallery with a talk given by art historian Marianne Kinkel before the documentary screening of the film Finding Vivian Maier at 7 pm in the CUB Auditorium.\n\nThis exhibit also features emerging student photographers from across the country. Students use their cameras as a vehicle to create portraits of our nuanced communities while simultaneously posing the question, “What constitutes a lasting and meaningful image?”\n\nCorbis: From the Collection of Tony and Leslie Rojas\n\nSince its founding, Corbis has collected hundreds of thousands of photographs that represent great and small moments throughout history. Here we showcase a selection of 32 iconic photographs through times of war or peace, the first flight at Kitty Hawk and the moon landing, and the quest for civil rights. Each picture stands as a defining visual moment within a signature event or personality in the 20th century. All works come to us from the Tony and Leslie Rojas Collection of Photography.\n\nVivian Maier\n\nVivian Maier was born in 1926 and spent most of a quiet anonymous life in Chicago. She died in 2009 and left no heirs or family. Unbeknownst to anyone, she did however leave a legacy of brilliant “street photography:” a hundred thousand negatives, thousands of rolls of undeveloped film, in color and black and white, and one hundred and fifty 8-mm. and 16-mm. films. The images exhibited represent a selection of the photographs that were discovered after her death.\n\nFunding for this exhibition is provided by Tony & Leslie Rojas and Members of the Museum of Art.\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nEXHIBITION: October 2 – December 12, 2015\n\nRECEPTION/GALLERY TALK: 10/1, 6-8pm, Talk at 7pm, MOA/WSU Gallery\n\nJim Dine entered the New York art world to great acclaim with his performance art “Happenings” and mixed media assemblages in the late 1950s. Although identified among the first generation of Pop artists, Dine’s work has always been independent of labels. His signature images of hearts, tools and bathrobes suggested popular culture references, but in his hands they became opportunities for a strong romantic, expressionist sensibility. Over time he expanded the realm of imagery to embrace classic and mythic themes, along with figurative work and portraiture.\n\nDine is one of those rare artists who has been active as a creative printmaker throughout his career and for whom prints are artistically equal to, and closely interact with his other work in painting, drawing, sculpture and photography. In the spring of 2014, Jim Dine donated 201 complete works of art from his personal archives to the Museum of Art at Washington State University, in honor of art patron Jordan D. Schnitzer and as a stimulus to the campaign for a new museum building on the Pullman campus.\n\nEstablished in 2015, this endowment supports the growth, care, and access to the museum’s permanent collection. The endowment is named in honor of President Ernest O. Holland who was instrumental in establishing the museum’s first collections as well as Regent Charles W. Orton who contributed funds to support Holland’s ambitious collecting efforts at a time when resources were scarce.\n\n2017\n\nThe Mary Margaret Aiken and Richard Aiken Collection of Late Twentieth Century Works on Paper focuses primarily on American prints created between 1965 and the mid-1990s. Comprised of 24 artworks by 16 artists, the collection includes art by renowned American and international artists. The Aiken Collection serves as a reminder of the legacy left by the Washington Art Consortium (WAC), a unique cooperative of seven museums throughout Washington state. Founded in 1975 by Seattle philanthropist Virginia Wright, she and the WAC member institutions collaborated to build an impressive collection of post-war American works on paper and photography. These foundational collections of 281 works were acquired through the Virginia Wright Fund and a matching grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. Although the WAC disbanded in 2017, the artworks are dispersed amongst its member institutions and remain available to the public. Through this process, the Aiken Collection’s ownership and care were transferred to the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art WSU.\n\n2018\n\nThe new museum opens April 6, 2018, welcoming the largest crowd (3,900+ in 3 days) of any building dedication in WSU History.\n\nThere were 6 inaugural exhibitions at the opening of the new facility on April 6, 2018.\n\nHearts: Selections from the Jim Dine Print Collection\n\nPerson(a): Portraiture From the Collections of Jordan D.

Memento contains imagery that is sensitive in nature.\n\nABOUT | memento [muh-men-toh]\n\n1) An object or item that serves to remind one of a person, past event, etc.; keepsake; souvenir.\n\n2) Anything serving as a reminder or warning.\n\nMemento: Selected Works from the Elwood Collections will be the first chance since the turn of the century to more fully research and exhibit one of the prized collections at the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art at Washington State University. Spanning fifty years from 1968 to 2018, the Sean Elwood Collections total over 300 objects across three distinct groupings. Originally established through a single donation of prints, the Sean Elwood Collections has grown to include examples 20thand 21stcentury photography, drawings, video, documentation, and cultural ephemera. Highlights include works by renowned Northwest artists such as Fay Jones, Michael Spafford and Jacob Lawrence, as well as by artists known nationally and internationally, such as Robert Mangold, Joseph Beuys, Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenberg. Organized thematically, the exhibition will offer reflections on key content areas such as minimalist gestures, performative works, non-normative narratives, as well as social satire and justice.\n\nWSU alumnus Sean Elwood began donating contemporary prints in 1987 in dedication to his parents Karen and John Elwood—both of whom were members of the Washington State University faculty. The early collection features works by artists from outside the state of Washington. A second collection was later established featuring artists living in Washington State and named to honor Elwood’s daughter, Shannon Strother Elwood. The third and final collection of art includes ephemera, resource materials, and objects related to visual culture, and named in honor of Elwood’s wife, Yvonne Puffer.\n\nIn 2017, Sean Elwood retired from the Creative Capital Foundation (NYC) where he served for over 17 years as Director of Programs & Initiatives. Prior to Creative Capital, Elwood served in various roles including: curator & art collection manager for the City of Seattle; Seattle Office of Arts & Cultural Affairs; director of special projects at Ronald Feldman Fine Arts; and manager of the artist residency program at Centrum Foundation. He founded Sean Elwood Fine Arts, SEEDITIONS Art Publishing Company and was co-founder of Fuller/Elwood Gallery in Seattle. Once retired, Elwood launched Sean Elwood Creative Projects, to assist individuals, businesses and organizations with the management of creative careers, collections, estates and program design. He also formed The Artist’s Estates Foundation to help support artists in all disciplines and allow the arts community to facilitate the creation of new artworks. Throughout his career, Elwood has periodically curated exhibitions, published limited edition artworks, served on multiple art and artist residency selection committees and he has written about, spoken about, collected and donated artworks.\n\nSean Elwood holds a BA in Fine Arts (Washington State University), and an MA in Visual Arts (Hunter College, New York), and continues to occasionally make artworks under an assumed name.\n\nFrom the Archives\n\n2019 | Polly Apfelbaum: Frequently the Woods are Pink, Prints from the Collections of Jordan D. Schnitzer and His Family Foundation\n\nEXHIBITION | August 27, 2019 – March 14, 2020\n\nCreighton Gallery, Bruce/Floyd Gallery, Borth Gallery, Smith Gallery\n\nArtist Lecture | September 4, 4-5 pm, CUB Auditorium, Reception | 5-6 pm, Museum Gallery\n\nPolly Apfelbaum: Frequently the Woods are Pink, Prints from the Collections of Jordan D. Schnitzer and His Family Foundation features unique prints of extraordinary complexity from this renowned American artist. Apfelbaum creates worlds of visual wonderment. The artist’s maximalist aesthetic posits a startling idea: Beauty, exuberance, and chromatic energy are conduits to social unity. Her works convey a welcoming space where juxtaposition of seemingly incongruous colors and patterns find shared equilibrium hinting at a society in peace.\n\nMarking the artist’s first survey exhibition dedicated solely to her ambitious printmaking practice, more than 60 works on paper have been selected between the years 2004 and 2018. The exhibition will highlight a wide-range of Apfelbaum’s printmaking methods with a collection of one-of-a-kind monoprints taking center stage. Her recent Atomic series arose from a process similar to that of her installation works, such as her “fallen paintings” consisting of many dyed fabric components the artist arranges in situ on the floor. Relatedly, these kaleidoscopic print works were created with assistants at Durham Press who inked hundreds of woodblocks in assorted colors and patterns. The artist then spontaneously placed the blocks in printing jigs to explore different color combinations and compositions. Created quickly, each monoprint serves as a kind of printed sketch, revealing unexpected moments of variation and fluidity.\n\nApfelbaum has been active since the mid-1980s and is best known for her expansive polychromatic floor-based installations residing somewhere between painting and sculpture. The artist has deployed a wide variety of media—including fabric, paint, dyes, wallpaper, and ceramics—materials traditionally associated with craft and domesticity. Influenced early in her career by artists Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, and Jackson Pollock; Apfelbaum’s sensibility incorporates energy, playfulness, and wit, as well as her love of popular culture and affirmative view of femininity.\n\nApfelbaum has mounted nearly 60 solo exhibitions worldwide and has participated in hundreds of group exhibitions. Her work is in numerous permanent collections including the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, NY; Brooklyn Museum, New York; Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; Dallas Museum of Art; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago; The Museum of Modern of Art, New York; Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia, PA; Philadelphia Museum of Art; Tang Teaching Museum, Saratoga Springs, NY; and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. She was the recipient of a Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant in 1987, a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1993, an Artist’s Fellowship from the New York Foundation for the Arts in 1995, an Anonymous Was a Woman Award in 1998, a Richard Diebenkorn Fellowship in 1999, a Joan Mitchell Fellowship in 1999, an Academy Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2002, the Rome Prize in 2012, and a Creative Capitol Award in 2019. The artist resides and works in New York City.\n\nBack to Timeline\n\n2020s\n\n2020\n\nTour this Exhibition Virtually\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nEXHIBITION | May 26, 2020 – February 12, 2021\n\n“I was too much the farmer’s daughter, in a sense. You know, that marvelous dirt out there that gets turned over with a plow and getting my hands dirty was the thing that turned me on.”\n\nABOUT | Betty Feves: The Earth Itself presents loaned and promised works by significant yet under-recognized artist Betty Whiteman Feves (1918–1985). Feves belongs to a generation of groundbreaking artists who expanded the use of clay in art. Featuring a wide-range of art from across Feves’ career, the exhibition will include early figurative and architectural forms, functional wares, bonfire pots, and large-scale sculpture. An advocate for living locally throughout her lifetime, Feves was committed to relentless experimentation with regionally-sourced materials. She created her own clay bodies and glazes from her immediate environment and the geology of the Columbia Basin provided a lifelong reservoir of inspiration. Her work continues to be exhibited nationally and internationally, and set the stage for clay to become the expressive medium it is today.\n\nBorn into a La Crosse, Washington wheat-farming family, Feves studied art at Washington State College (now WSU) in the late 1930s under the tutelage of a young Clyfford Still, a soon-to-be leading Abstract Expressionist. She spent the early 1940s in New York attending the Art Students League and completing an MA in Art Education at Columbia University. Feves then chose to live, work, and raise her four children in Pendleton, Oregon where she remained the next 40 years. She mentored numerous young artists and advocated for the arts in education by serving on the Pendleton school board as well as the State Board for Higher Education. In 1977, Feves was one of the first recipients of the Governor’s Arts Award for the State of Oregon, for which she was recognized for both art and music.\n\nFunding for this exhibition is provided by Alan and Laurie Feves, the Samuel H. and Patricia W. Smith Endowment, Patrick and Elizabeth Siler, and members of the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art WSU.\n\n2021\n\nThe Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art reports to the WSU Pullman Chancellor’s Office as part of the One WSU Strategic Plan.\n\n2022\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nKeiko Hara’s exploration of her relationship to her surrounding environment has been continually formulated through the artist’s ongoing series titled, Topophilia. Meaning “a strong love of place,” the term topophilia, with its connection to humanistic geography, also represents a universal desire to hold onto ephemeral moments of beauty and sadness as related to conceptions of place—even if unattainable. This mini-survey exhibition chronicles Hara’s unwavering commitment to painting and her unique form of Japanese woodblock printmaking, over a 40-year period. Her abstract compositions are at once immensely sensitive yet executed in vibrant color with references to water, fire, skies, and verdant lands, offering rich metaphorical imagery. Hara’s longtime home in Walla Walla, Washington, situated in an expansive valley flanked by the Blue Mountains, figures centrally within her work as does a more internal investigation into the poetics of space. Tactility of things, their reference to nature, and how we perceive, feel, and understand the universe that we inhabit are all conditions of Hara’s visual enterprise.\n\nOrganized by the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art WSU and curated by Ryan Hardesty. Funding is provided by Ainslie and Keith Peoples, the Samuel H. and Patricia W. Smith Endowment, Nancy Spitzer, the Walla Walla Foundry, and members of the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art WSU.\n\nThe Publication\n\nKeiko Hara offers a detailed exploration of the artist’s unwavering commitment to painting and her unique form of Japanese woodblock printmaking. Separated from her cultural surroundings in Japan, memory and longing became overarching themes. Rich with metaphorical imagery, her visual universe encompasses and investigates the poetics of space.\n\nPublished in 2022 – Distributed by the JSMA WSU and WSU Press\n\nEstablished in 2022, the Timothy Bradbury Collection is comprised of over 80 photographs from modern and contemporary practitioners of lens-based image making. The collection includes many of the twentieth century’s most foundational photographers such as Berenice Abbott, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Frank, Helen Levitt, Alfred Stieglitz, Paul Strand, and Minor White.\n\n2023\n\nFrom the Archives\n\nExhibition: August 22, 2023 – March 9, 2024\n\nJeffrey Gibson asks us to co-envision a future and to move toward it. Ceaselessly prioritizing collective imagination as a tool toward manifestation and realization, the artist has stated, “Don’t accept the circumstances you are in; acknowledge that you are in them and then find a future.” Gibson’s form of hard-earned optimism evokes a time frame that unites and collapses past, present, and future into a flowing and responsive mindset, rooted in the belief that a critical engagement with the past can help us shape a brighter horizon.\n\nThis major exhibition is devoted to one of today’s foremost artists, whose vibrant interdisciplinary practice combines sculpture and painting, beadwork and video, words and images, incorporating rawhide, tipi poles, sterling silver, wool blankets, jingles, fringe, and sinew—materials that refer to American Indian cultures toward the adornment of quotidian objects such as punching bags, flags, banners, and illuminated signs. Gibson, who is of Mississippi Choctaw and Cherokee heritage, combines aspects of Indigenous art and culture with modernist traditions, navigating and disrupting the expectations placed upon Native artists working within the contemporary art world. At the root of his enterprise lies a core value—objects, and people alike, carry the potential for radical transformation.\n\nExclusively curated from the collections of Jordan D. Schnitzer and His Family Foundation, They Teach Love presents a sweeping survey of over 35 objects across a span of fifteen years. Beginning with examples of the artist’s earliest engagements with printmaking, our exhibition proceeds to include photography, painting, and sculpture, as well as recent forms that express his foray into performance, installation, and video, as well as contemporary adornment in fashion. The latter direction is reflective of intertribal powwows as well as the dance clubs where Gibson found safe spaces as a teenager.\n\nThe exhibition’s centerpiece is an expansive and immersive work titled To Name An Other which is comprised of 51 screen printed elk hide drums and 50 wearable garments. Originally commissioned as a performance by the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery, in 2019, To Name An Other marks a turning point in the artist’s career whereby Gibson has increasingly sought out collective-based projects and performances to activate the communities he works within. This idea is especially appropriate when considering Jeffrey Gibson’s work, as he pushes to create affinity—collaboration is at the heart of his recent social practice. Working and learning together may aid to decolonize our minds and institutions, revealing a future we wish to inhabit.\n\nOrganized by the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art. Support for this exhibition and related programs has been made possible by a grant from Jordan Schnitzer and The Harold & Arlene Schnitzer CARE Foundation. Additional funding for this exhibition has been provided by the David G. Pollart Center for Arts and Humanities, the WSU Pullman Office of the Chancellor, Nancy Spitzer, the Samuel H. and Patricia W. Smith Endowment, and friends of the museum.\n\nBack to Timeline\n\nToday and the Future\n\nAs we look back at the art that has adorned our walls and the extraordinary exhibitions that have graced our galleries, we are moved by the collective dedication that has shaped this institution over the past five decades. The esteemed staff has woven a narrative of awe, wonder, and curiosity through more than 390 curated exhibitions. Their hard work has opened our doors to thousands of visitors who have found inspiration within our galleries, embodying the spirit of creativity and passion that fuels our mission.\n\nToday, we see not just a snapshot of the past and present, but a vision of the future—one filled with boundless potential, innovation, and continued commitment to the transformative impact of art. Through our staff, volunteers, community members, donors, and our visitors, we will continue to fulfil our mission of inspiring, engaging, and educating diverse audiences through the power of art."
