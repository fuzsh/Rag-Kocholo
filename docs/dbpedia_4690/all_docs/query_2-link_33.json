A completely self taught visual and performing artist with specializations in multiple dance styles (including but not limited to: Hip Hop, Breaking, and House) seamlessly transitioned to teaching visual arts at Newark School of the Arts. His visual arts classroom style mimics his dance classroom approach: building a solid foundation in the fundamentals, and finding freedom within that foundation. The overarching theme of his course is to consolidate the vast, helpful (albeit overwhelming) content in the world, and channel it into lesson plans catered to a student's individual growth. This process directs the students on a focused path of improvement with tools he’s used first hand, in order to grow.\"\n\nBorn in New Haven Connecticut in 1952, Ray graduated from the university of Connecticut (B.F.A.) and received his Masters of Fine Arts (MFA from the University of Massachusetts.
