Bruce Herman’s work speaks for itself: artist, essayist, speaker, professor.

His multifaceted work also speaks for Gordon College: For nearly thirty years, Bruce has been instrumental in the founding and flourishing of the College's art major. Now the Lothlórien Distinguished Chair in the Fine Arts, he remains a catalyst for change at Gordon—transforming blank canvas into lush image, an old gymnasium into a first-class center for the arts, fledgling artists into mature, inspired painters.

Look for the Gordon College print ad featuring Bruce in the March 2012 issue of Christianity Today.
