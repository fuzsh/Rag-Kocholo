This memorial commemorates the 11,134 deported and murdered Jewish residents of Frankfurt am Main.

It is next to the former main synagogue of Frankfurt. This synagogue, as well as all the others in Frankfurt, was destroyed in the Reichs Kristall Nacht (Crystal Night) in 1938.

One of the names on the memorial is of Anne Frank (Annelies Frank), who was born in Frankfurt am Main on 12 June 1929.
