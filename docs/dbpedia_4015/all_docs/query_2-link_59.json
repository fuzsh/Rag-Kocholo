        "text": "You need to register your baby within 7 days after birth. You can do this at the hospital or by visiting the Registry Office (\"Standesamt\"). If you gave birth in a hospital, the hospital will inform the Registry Office for you.\n\nThe Registry Office works with hospitals to offer a special service. It works like this:\n\nAt the hospital, fill in the documents needed to register your baby.\n\nThese documents and the notice of the birth of your baby will be sent to the Registry Office.\n\nThe Registry Office will issue the birth certificate.\n\nOnce the certificate is ready, you can pick it up at the hospital or the Registry Office.\n\nIf you wish, the birth certificate and your documents will be sent to your home by registered mail for a fee.\n\nIf you have given birth at home or in a birth centre, you have to register the birth yourself at the correct Registry Office. You must do this within one week. You will need to bring the birth announcement paperwork from the midwife, nurse, or physician who delivered your baby.\n\nYou only need to come in person if it is a matter of public certification, such as acknowledgement of paternity or naming.\n\nIf you have already given birth to a child in Frankfurt am Main, we kindly ask you to register the birth by post using the questionnaire Birth registration form (pdf , 520KB)Download Link (German only).
