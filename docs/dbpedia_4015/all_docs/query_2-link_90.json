Military bases can include residences for individuals who are actively serving, training grounds and health care facilities. Military bases can be located within a home country as well as abroad.\n\nWho is the most famous person who was born on a military base? Bruce Willis tops our list. The “Die Hard” star was born on a U.S. military base in West Germany where his father was serving. At the age of two, Willis and his family relocated to New Jersey. “Jarhead” actor Peter Sarsgaard was born on an Air Force base in Illinois. Other actors who were born on military bases include Julianne Moore, Lou Diamond Phillips and Johnny Galecki.\n\nSenator John McCain was born at the Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone. McCain's place of birth became a big topic of conversation when he became the Republican Presidential nominee in 2008. Although McCain was not a “natural born” U.S. Citizen, both of his parents were citizens and they were in Panama on an official military assignment. Many people believe that an amendment should be made to the U.S. Constitution to cover future situations like John McCain's.\n\nWhat do you think of the famous people who were born on military bases?
