        "text": "Rabbi Avichai Apel came to Frankfurt from Dortmund. A father of seven, he was born in Jerusalem in 1975. He studied at the Yeshiva in Kdumim Jerusalem and Efrat. After his national service in the Israeli army, he received his semikhah and went to Russia for three years as a shaliach (envoy) of the Jewish Agency. From 2014 to 2016 he was the rabbi of the Jewish Cultural Community of Greater Dortmund.\n\nRabbi Apel is on the Executive Board of the Orthodox Rabbi Conference Germany (ORD), a member of the Standing Committee of the Council of European Rabbis, a founder and Board Member of the Union of Zionist Rabbis in Europe, and a member of the Executive Board of the Chulia Fund.\n\nFrankfurt’s orthodox rabbi, Rabbi Julian-Chaim Soussan, was born in 1968 in Schluchsee and grew up in Freiburg. He studied economics and Jewish studies at the Ruprecht Karl University in Heidelberg before devoting his attention exclusively to the latter at the Heidelberg University for Jewish Studies. As a student, he began a 10-year stint as a teacher of Jewish religion in Stuttgart. He then acquired a position teaching religious education in Düsseldorf. Encouraged by Paul Spiegel, the former president of the Central Council for Jews in Germany, he completed his studies in Jerusalem and became a rabbi. He was ordained in May 2003, following in the footsteps of his father, Rabbi Benjamin David Soussan.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2011 Soussan was the rabbi of the Jewish Community in Düsseldorf. He then moved on to Mainz, before being called to Frankfurt in August 2013. He is married and has two sons. Soussan is a rabbi in Frankfurt, a member of the Advisory Committee to the Executive Board of the Orthodox Rabbi Conference Germany (ORD) and often represents them in interreligious events in the public arena."
