        "text": "Although productions have been presented first and foremost for the Tristate, the Playhouse always has contributed to the national stage. Ever since the U.S. premiere of Henry Livings' Eh? in 1966, which subsequently played to great success off-Broadway, the American theatre has benefited greatly from the vision and craftsmanship now synonymous with the Playhouse. Among its many other premieres are: Caravaggio in 1971, directed and produced by Word Baker; Sing Hallelujah!, which enjoyed huge acclaim when it moved to off-Broadway's Village Gate in 1987; Tapestry: The Music of Carole King (1988) which ran off-Broadway five years later; and The Notebook of Trigorin (1996), a work by Tennessee Williams that garnered international attention.\n\nAmong the non-premieres that have been presented elsewhere, the Playhouse's production of Thunder Knocking on the Door, the electrifying blues musical by Keith Glover, enjoyed subsequent runs in San Diego, Rochester, Cleveland, and Stamford, Connecticut. Nixon's Nixon, Russell Lees' speculative eavesdrop on the conversation between Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon, has now played on four continents and was hailed as among the best at 1999's Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It enjoyed acclaimed runs in Ireland and Toronto, at the 2001 Hong Kong Theatre Festival, at the Comedy Theatre in London's West End and in Australia and New Zealand, as well as the East and West coasts of the United States.\n\nThe Playhouse's 2003 production of The Syringa Tree was presented in 2004 at the English Theatre in Vienna, the longest operating English language theatre in continental Europe, and in 2006 at The English Theatre Frankfurt in Germany. In November 2006, the Playhouse's production of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's landmark musical Company, directed by John Doyle, opened on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, where it ran until July 2007. The Playhouse's production of Around the World in 80 Days transferred to the off-Broadway Irish Repertory Theatre for an eight-week run. Due to popular demand, the run was extended.\n\nFor the past 20 years, the Playhouse has produced at least one world premiere production each season. Several recent Playhouse premieres also have gone on to subsequent production or publication. The 1997 production of In Walks Ed by Keith Glover was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Angus MacLachlan's The Dead Eye Boy (2000) was nominated for the American Theatre Critics' Association's New Play Award and enjoyed a critically-acclaimed run at off-Broadway's MCC Theatre in 2001 and at the Hampstead Theatre in London in 2002. The Playhouse's 1998 premiere of Coyote on a Fence by Bruce Graham enjoyed a 2004 run at the Duchess Theatre in London's West End. The 2003 Playhouse production of The Love Song of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Carson Kreitzer was honored with the citation as the runner-up for the 2004 American Theatre Critics/Steinberg New Play Award."
