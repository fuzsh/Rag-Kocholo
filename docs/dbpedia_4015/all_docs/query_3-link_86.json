        "text": "S\n\nSacchini, Antonio (1734–1786): Composer, student of Durante and Guglielmi; 1774 in Munich and Stuttgart, 1772–82 in London, then Paris. Composer of French operas (Dardanus 1784, Oedipe à Colone, 1786), oratorios, chamber music.\n\nSachs, Hans (1494–1576): Writer, by trade a shoemaker, eventually settling in Nürnberg after a period as an itinerant journeyman. Prolific writer primarily of Meisterlieder (a form of poetry set to music and sung solo by members of the guilds of Meistersinger), fables, anecdotes, verse stories, and verse plays combining homespun simplicity with keen powers of observation. Though Sachs’s work was not valued in the seventeenth century, Goethe’s poem Hans Sachsens poetische Sendung (1776) helped popularize him again. (Portrait: frontispiece to Hanns Sachsens sehr herrliche schöne und wahrhafte Gedicht, Fabeln und gute Schwenck in einem Auszug aus dem ersten Buch, ed. Johann Heinrich Hässlein [Nürnberg 1781].)\n\nSachsen-Weimar-Eisenacht, Karl Friedrich von (1783–1853): Son of Duke Karl August and Luise of Weimar. From 3 August 1804 married to Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia, daughter of Czar Paul I. (Portrait: by Johann Friedrich August Tischbein; Klassik Stiftung Weimar.)\n\nSade, Donatien-Alphonse-Françis, Comte (Marquis) de (1740–1814): French author of licentious and obscene writings that prompted the term “sadism.” Condemned to death as a criminal but pardoned ca. 1772. Wrote while in prison. Freed during the Revolution, which he then zealously supported, though Napoleon later had him confined for mental disorders after de Sade’s writings offended him.\n\nSailer, Johann Michael (17 November 1751–20 May 1832): Bavarian Roman Catholic theologian and Jesuit. From 1780 professor in Ingolstadt, 1784–94 professor of moral and pastoral theology in Dillingen. Variously criticized for engaging in excessive rationalism, false mysticism, he eventuallyt lost his position; also attacked for his connections with the Awakening Movement. Finally 1800–21 professor in Landshut, where he advocated a form of Christianity that sought to overcome Enlightenment thinking and that viewed scholasticism critically. From 1829 bishop of Regensburg. (Portrait: Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Universitätsarchiv.)\n\nSaint-Germain, Le Comte de: An otherwise unidentified, apparently wealthy adventurer who ingratiated himself at the court of Louis XV, claiming to have lived in previous centuries and to having access to occult information.\n\nSalat, Jakob (1766–1851): Catholic Bavarian theologian and philosopher. Became acquainted with Enlightenment philosophy in secondary school. After various pastorates and accusations of associations with the Illuminati (1798, 1801), became professor of moral and pastoral theology at the lyceum in Munich, continuing also to work as a pastor in Arnbach. From 1807 professor of philosophy in Landshut, where he encountered harsh criticism from followers of Schelling but was nonetheless in good standing with the Bavarian administration. Following a path consistent with Enlightenment thinking, he opposed contemporary inclinations toward supernaturalism and obscurantism, always trying to focus on a reconciliation between reason and revelation. (Portrait: anonymous; Munich, university archives; in: Laetitia Boehm and Johannes Spörl, Ludwig–Maximilians–Universität in ihren Fakultäten: Ingolstadt, Landshut, München, 1472–1972 [Munich 1972], p. 206.)\n\nSalvator Rosa (1615–1673): Italian Baroque painter, poet, printmaker. Salvator lived a colorful, even exciting life, often in trouble for the satires he also published; his rebellious, independent streak is often cited in that regard. Perhaps best known for his haunting landscapes, overgrown with vegetation, or his jagged beaches, mountains, and caves, works that are often brooding and melancholic, featuring ruins, brigands, shepherds, seamen, or soldiers. Rosa was among the first to paint “romantic” or “picturesque” landscapes in this sense.\n\nSalzmann, Johann Friedemann Gottfried (2 October 1745–1815): attorney in Jena, lived at Unterm Markt 2. Represented Fichte in the latter’s attempt to liquidate his house, and in July 1803, Schiller gave him complete power of attorney over his affairs.\n\nSamhaber, Johann Baptist Aloys (8 February 1754–1814): Jurist, from 1777 professor of law, from 1805 rector of the university in Würzburg.\n\nSand, George (Amandinwe-Aurore-Lucile Dupin, Baronne Dudevant (1804–76): French novelist, though also wrote for the theater and autobiographical pieces; also noted for her various liaisons (including with Frédéric Chopin) and unconventional views and lifestyle.\n\nSander, Johann Daniel (1759–1825): Bookseller, writer. A native of Magdeburg, Sander studied theology in Halle till 1780, thereafter working as a teacher in Berlin and 1785–89 as editor of the Berliner Zeitung, then as an advisor, representative, and ultimately partner in the Voss bookseller’s firm, in the latter capacity also carrying on a lively correspondence with Carl August Böttiger, who at the time was director of the Weimar Gymnasium. From 1794 married to Sophie, née Diederichs. Sander became independent in 1798 through the purchase of the Wever publishing company, in which capacity he published the works of August von Kotzebue; although Goethe mocked him as Kotzebue’s publisher, Sander and his wife, Sophie, maintained a cordial relationship with Goethe, Sander even doing final proofs of some of Goethe’s works. When Kotzebue left Weimar in indignation in 1802 and moved to Berlin, Sander, who had already published Kotzebue’s Das merkwürdigste Jahr meines Lebens (2 vols., 1801), also became the publisher, printer, and co-editor of the periodical Der Freimüthige. A friend and publisher of the writer August Lafontaine, Sander was also a member of the Wednesday Society in Berlin (in which Marcus Herz lectured) and published novels and stories himself and translated Charles Perrault’s fairy tales. Also active as a musician in Berlin, adapting several operas for the Berlin stage.\n\nSander, Sophie, née Diederichs (1768–1828): Berlin salon hostess. From 1794 married to the publisher Johann Daniel Sander. From 1800 to 1810 her salon was an important social and intellectual gathering place in Berlin, she allegedly being a charming and deft conversationalist herself and a tactful hostess; its visitors included the Humboldt brothers, Heinrich von Kleist, Karl August Böttiger, Friedrich Schlegel, Clemens Brentano, Wilhelm Schlegel, Goethe, and Jean Paul. Corresponded with, among others, Heinrich von Kleist, Johann Gottfried Herder, and the latter’s wife, Karoline. Sophie Sander was allegedly the fictitious recipient of Garlieb Merkel’s Briefe an ein Frauenzimmer über die neuesten Produkte der schönen Literatur in Teutschland.\n\nSappho Greek lyric poetess. Lived on the island of Lesbos ca. 600 B.C.E. Numerous fragments but only one complete text of her poems have been preserved. Her poems are almost all of a personal nature, with little reference to mythological material (and then only to illustrate personal material), and characterized by the expression of feelings, emotions, and experiences. She openly praises the beauty of the young girls to whom she was close and passionately affirms her inclinations for them.\n\nSartorius, Georg (1766–1828): Professor of history in Göttingen. From 1783 student in Göttingen, from 1786 librarian, from 1792 lecturer, from 1794 senior librarian, from 1797 associate professor, from 1802 full professor, from 1814 also of political science, attending the Congress of Vienna in the same year at the request of the grand duke of Weimar. Widely traveled (in 1791, 1803, 1812) in Germany, France, Switzerland, and Italy. A long-time acquaintance of Goethe (who was godfather to his son) and the first German scholar to popularize Adam Smith’s book Wealth of Nations in Germany. In 1806 purchased the estate in Waltershausen from the von Kalb family, under whose financial mismanagement it had fallen into disrepair. He was ennobled by King Ludwig of Bavaria in 1827. (Portrait: anonymous; private family collection.)\n\nSavigny, Friedrich Karl von (1779–1861): Professor of law, brother-in-law of Clemens and Bettina Brentano. Studied law in Marburg 1795–99 (one semester in Göttingen), where he formed lasting relationships with the Grimm brothers and the circle of Romantics around the Brentano family. Received in doctorate in 1800, after which his first book, Das Recht des Besitzes (1803) instantly established his reputation in legal circles. From 1802 professor of law in Marburg, then traveled around Europe, from 1808 professor in Landshut, from 1810 in Berlin. Married Kunigunde Brentano in 1805. A distinguished professor who eventually was appointed to the Prussian State Council and is often viewed as the founder of historical jurisprudence in Germany. (Portrait: frontispiece to Eduard Müller, Friedrich Karl von Savigny [Leipzig 1906].)\n\nScarpa, Antonio (1752–1832): From 1783 till 1804 professor of anatomy at the university in Pavia; dismissed for refusing oaths to the new king of Italy, namely, Napoleon, who, however, restored him to his former position in 1805.\n\nSchachtrup, Johann Conrad (dates unknown): Merchant in Clausthal, father of Johann David Michaelis’s first wife, Johanna Christiana Friederike Schachtrup (&dagger 1759).\n\nSchad, Johann Baptist (1758–1834): Philosopher. Born to strict Catholic parents who instilled a disinclination in him toward those who were of other faiths (he found it difficult to mention Luther’s name even after converting to Protestantism later). At the age of ten, he enrolled in a Benedictine monastery school to prepare for the priesthood, began studying under Jesuits in Bamberg at fourteen, becoming a novice at twenty and was also immediately disappointed at what he thought was rampant hypocrisy in the order. Engaged in extensive philosophical reading and was especially attracted to Kant. By 1788 he had become vocal opponent of monasticism, publishing against it and, though protected by some ecclesiastical authorities, also being subjected to personal abuse in the order. When his authorship of a particularly biting satire became known and he began fearing for his life, he escaped the monastery one night. One way of eluding his pursuers was to convert to Protestantism, which he also found more to his own convictions. Much like Karl Leonhard Reinhold, the Kantian, he became a professor of philosophy, championing the developments which Fichte had brought about in Kantianism, introducing himself to Fichte in Jena as well. After Fichte’s departure, he became a lecturer in Jena, becoming a professor in 1802 and continuing to lecture on Fichte’s system (Fichte regarded him as one of the few or even the only scholar who genuinely understood his system) and later shifting to Schelling’s philosophy. His presence at Jena after Fichte’s departure, however, made it difficult for Schelling to establish himself the way he would have liked. From 1804 professor at the Russian university in Charkow, though in 1816 he was expelled from Russia for offensive passages in his publications. Although he returned to Jena, things went badly. He had lost considerable money upon expulsion from Russia because of his wife’s debts and began drinking heavily in Jena, a habit he had picked up in Russia. (Portrait: F. W. Nettling; frontispiece to Johann Baptist Schad, Lebens- und Klostergeschichte, von ihm selbst beschrieben [Erfurt 1803].)\n\nSchadow, Johann Gottfried (1764–1850): Sculptor and graphic artist. A Berlin native, he received his early training there under the Prussian court sculptor Tassaert before leaving Berlin suddenly in 1785 with Marianne Devidels, a Jewess who had converted to Catholicism and married her in Rome after converting to Catholicism himself. After some training in Italy, he returned to Berlin, converted back to Protestantism, and in 1788 succeeded Tassaert as head of the royal sculpture workshop. He quickly acquired numerous important commissions and laid the foundations for the Berlin school of classicism in sculpture. Patronized by FriedrichWilhelm II, whose statue in Stettin he created, he also created the famous quadriga and other decorations for the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. He also did the famous double piece depicting the Prussian princesses Luise and Friederike. From 1805 rector, from 1815 director of the Berlin Academy of the Arts. From about 1800, however, he came into conflict with the emergent Romantic movement in the arts as represented not least by his own pupils, including Friedrich Tieck, which increasingly displaced the earlier classicistic, naturalist mode, especially after the death of Friedrich Wilhelm II in 1797, Schadow’s patron. Schadow eventually turned his energies more to the graphic arts, also becoming an accomplished caricaturist, though his Luther monument in Wittenberg was unveiled in 1821. Schelling tells an anecdote according to which Schadow insulted Goethe at a meeting in Weimar by immediately asking if he might take head measurements for a bust (see letter 371h). (Portrait: self-portrait.)\n\nSchäffer, Jacob Christian (1718–1790): Polymath, Protestant theologian (doctorate in Tübingen in 1763), church superintendent, botanist, mycologist, entomologist, and researcher into questions of electricity and the theory of colors and optics, conceived and produced a prototype washing machine.\n\nSchatz, Georg Gottlieb (1763–95): Writer. Of frail constitution as a boy, he turned to reading as a source of entertainment, reading French authors as well, and even as a teenager was influenced (including in his own writing style) by Lessing’s critical writings. From 1781 (Friedrich Jakobs, Personalien [Leipzig 1840], 338, dates the year as 1782) studied law (unsuccessfully) in Jena; after his father’s death in 1783, he broke off his studies to pursue literary interests, returning to his hometown of Gotha, where he was a close acquaintance of Friedrich Wilhelm Gotter and for two years worked as a lector for the high court official Ernst August von Studnitz, father of Julie Studnitz. Thereafter lived as a freelance writer in Gotha, publishing poems (a small collection, Blumen auf den Altar der Grazien [Leipzig 1787]) and Laura oder Briefe einiger Frauenzimmer aus der französischen Schweiz (1788/89), a sentimental epistolary novel. Wrote numerous reviews for the Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek, the Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung, and the Neue Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften, and was also active as a translator. His critiques and cutting wit (he published a condescending review of Friedrich Ludwig Meyer’s Spiele des Witzes und der Phantasie [Berlin 1793]) variously prompted retaliations in journals against his own works, and he himself acknowledged that his talent lay more in the realm of criticism than creative writing.\n\nSchelling, August Ludwig (17 March 1781–20 October 1859): Theologian, pastor, superintendent (Dekan) in Marbach, younger brother of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, hence after June 1803 Caroline’s brother-in-law. From 24 September 1810 married to Charlotte Christiane, née Gaupp (22 July 1792–5 August 1830). From 13 February 1831 married to Henrietta Sophia Gottliebin, née Laichinger (born 6 July 1786).\n\nSchelling, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph (von) (27 January 1775 Leonberg–20 August 1854 Bad Ragaz, Switzerland): From 26 June 1803 Caroline’s third husband. Philosopher. Born the the same parsonage as H. E. G. Paulus, both fathers being pastors in the Leonberg congregation outside Stuttgart. From 1777 his father was preacher and professor at the monastery school in Bebenhausen outside Tübingen, a kind of preparatory school for the Tübinger Stift, the seminary in Tübingen. Although Schelling was sent off to the Latin school in Nürtingen in 1785, he returned in 1787 because he had already exhausted the institution’s educational possibilities. Thenceforth he studied with the older students in Bebenhausen before entering the Tübinger Stift in 1790 with a special dispensation, since ordinarily one had to be eighteen to enter. Here he met and roomed with Hegel and Hölderlin, who were five years his senior. He earned his masters in 1792, studied philosophy at the university proper, and finished his seminary studies in 1795 (Hegel and Hölderlin had left in 1794), already having published in the field of philosophy. From 1796 private tutor to the young Barons von Riedesel, with whom he went to Leipzig, where he studied mathematics, natural science, and medicine. Beginning in 1797 he published several pieces on the philosophy of nature, gaining the attention of Fichte and prompting a university appointment (at Goethe’s initiative) in Jena in 1798. Spent part of the summer of 1798 in Dresden with the Schlegel circle (meeting Caroline for the first time) before assuming his duties as professor of philosophy in Jena. In 1799, when Fichte was forced to leave Jena and Friedrich Schlegel, Dorothea Veit, and Tieck moved there, he began his relationship with Caroline. After Caroline’s illness in early 1800 and the increasing friction within the group, he, Caroline, and Auguste traveled to Bamberg, where he lecltured and pursued medical studies. After Auguste’s death in July, Caroline went to Braunschweig with Wilhelm while Schelling returned to Jena in October. From January 1801 he worked closely with Hegel in Jena but became more alienated from Fichte, who was then in Berlin. After Caroline and Wilhelm’s divorce in May 1803, Schelling and Caroline journeyed to Murrhardt to stay with Schelling’s parents and were married there (by his father) on 26 June, he also receiving an appointment as full professor of philosophy in Würzburg, a position he left in 1806 (as did others), when as a result of the Peace of Pressburg the high bishopric Würzburg passed to Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany and a restoration was implemented. From 1806 member of the Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Munich but no activity as a regular professor again until 1820. 1806 public break with Fichte and in 1807 from Hegel, who includes a polemic against Schelling in the preface to the Phänomenologie des Geistes. From 1808 general secretary of the Academy of the Fine Arts in Munich. Profound existential crisis after Caroline’s death in 1809. In 1812 public dispute with Friedrich Jacobi. Married Pauline Gotter on 11 June 1812, their first son was born in December 1813. From 1820 honorary professor in Erlangen, from 1827 back in Munich, from 1835 also private teacher (philosophy) of the crown prince, later King Maximilian II. 1841 appointment in Berlin to counter the influence of Hegelians at the university, from 1842 member of the Prussian Academy of Science. From 1846 ceased lecturing in Berlin at the university. (Portrait: 1801, by Christian Friedrich Tieck.)\n\nSchelling, Gottliebin Maria (Marie), née Cless (21 January 1746 Stuttgart–1818 Stuttgart): Schelling’s mother — whom he is said most to resemble physically, Caroline’s third mother-in-law. From 12 November 1771 wife of Joseph Friedrich Schelling. She was the daughter of the clergyman Wilhelm Jeremias Jakob Cless (1710–57), from 1738 a vicar in Ludwigsburg, from 1741 in Stuttgart, and Regine Dorothea Rieger (1720–57). (Portrait: last owned by Frau M. Bergfeld-von Schelling; reproduced in Carmen Kahn-Wallerstein, Schellings Frauen Caroline und Pauline [Bern 1959], 208.)\n\nSchelling, Heinrich Gottlieb (2 June 1778–1800): Younger brother of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, attended the monastery school in Nürtingen (1790) as did Hölderlin and his elder brother before him. Killed in action near Genoa in 1800, prompting Schelling’s departure from Bamberg for Schorndorf — leaving Caroline and Auguste behind — to be with his parents after receiving the news.\n\nSchelling, Johanna Beate (28 December 1779–25 October 1861): Schelling’s sister, from 26 July 1804, married to Senior Finance Secretary Carl Albrecht (Adolf) Gross (born 3 August 1765) in Stuttgart. After June 1803 Caroline’s sister-in-law.\n\nSchelling, Joseph Friedrich (13 August 1737 Unterweissach/Backnang–5 October 1812 Maulbronn): Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling’s father and thus from 1803 Caroline’s father-in-law. Pastor, theologian, and scholar of ancient near eastern studies. 1752–56 early education in the monastery schools in Herbrechtingen, Denkendorf, and Maulbronn, from 1756 in the seminary in Tübingen (the Stift), where he attained his masters in 1758 and developed an interest in ancient near eastern languages. From 1765 vicar in Zaberfeld, from 1766 tutor at the seminary, later city vicar in Stuttgart and private house tutor to the court preacher Johann Christian Storr, where he also met Gottliebin Marie Cless, daughter of the Stuttgart city preacher, whom he married on 12 November 1771. In 1771–77 he was pastor in Leonberg, 1777–91 profesor at the monastery school in Bebenhausen outside Tübingen, from 1791 dean (special superintendent) in Schorndorf, from 1801 prelate in Murrhardt, from 1807 prelate and general superintendent in Maulbronn. Influenced by the historical-critical study of the bible advocated by the Swabian J. A. Bengel. As a scholar of Arabic, Syrian, and Hebrew, his pupils included several of the later leading theologians in Württemberg, and he himself was one of the first scholars in Württemberg to disseminate the philological and hermeneutical principles developed by Johann David Michaelis, Caroline’s father.\n\nSchelling, Karl Friedrich August (1815–1863): Second son of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling and Pauline Schelling, née Gotter. Studied theology and became a vicar, edited and published the first more comprehensive edition of Schelling’s works and began publication of the letters; after his death, Gustav Plitt took over editorial duties for the latter.\n\nSchelling, Karl (Carl) Eberhard (1783–1854): Physician, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling’s brother (hence from 1803 Caroline’s brother-in-law). From 1799 studied medicine in Jena, Tübingen, and Vienna, attaining his doctorate in 1803. From 1805 practicing physician in Stuttgart. Co-edited Adalbert Friedrich Marcus and Schelling’s Jahrbücher der Medicin als Wissenschaft (1805–8), also contributing articles and reviews (e.g., “Ideen und Erfahrungen über den thierischen Magnetismus,” 2 [1806], no. 1, 3–46). Ultimately, however, he concentrated on his medical practice rather than on publishing. (Portrait: 1854 lithograph by Christian Sigmund Pfann, after a photograph.)\n\nSchelver, Franz Joseph (1778–1832): physician and botanist. Studied medicine in Jena from 1796, though also philosophy under Fichte. Attained his doctorate in Göttingen in 1798, practicing then as a general physician in Osnabrück. From 1801 lecturer in Halle, from 1803 special professor in Jena (but not as the univesity’s first choice; Schelling promoted his successful candidacy for the position with Goethe earlier in 1803), from 1806 in Heidelberg after his collections were destroyed when the French came through Jena in October of that year. Advocate of Schelling’s philosophy of nature, incorporating it into his understanding of medicine. Also studied animal magnetism.\n\nSchenk, Johann Heinrich, Ritter von (1748–1813): Bavarian statesmen and administrator, early friend and secretary of Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi.\n\nSchenk zu Schweinsberg, Ferdinand von: Uncertain, and problems in chronology abound, but in the context of Caroline’s stay in Marburg, Julius Steinberger, Erinnerungen, 143, suggests it might have been the Hessian minister Ferdinand von Schenk zu Schweinsberg (1765–1842): from 1781 law student in Marburg, from 1784 assessor for the municipal administration and consistory in Marburg, from 1785 till 1786 worked at the imperial court in Wetzlar, but from 1788 was transferred to the court of appeals in Kassel. In 1789 in Kassel he entered the service of crown prince Wilhelm, accompanying him in 1792 on a journey to Switzerland, from 1792 back in his former position with the administration and consistory in Marburg. His acquaintance with Caroline seems to depend on when during his service in Kassel he might have spent enough time in Marburg to form a closer acquaintance with her. In any event, he seems to have been romantically interested in Caroline in Marburg, even to the point of marriage.\n\nScherer, Wilhelm (1841–86): Austrian literary historian, professor in Vienna, Strassbourg, and Berlin, author of a comprehensive and enormously influential history of German literature taking its orientation from intellectual and cultural history, with biographical elements receding behind larger contextual views (Geschichte der deutschen Literatur [1883]). The Scherer School of literary history was characterized by sound philological training and a thorough familiarity with cultural development. After Scherer’s death at only forty-five years of age, more than twenty-five of his former students were professors in Germany and Austria, including Erich Schmidt. (Portrait: engraving by L. Jacobi after a portrait by Julie de Boor; frontispiece in Scherer’s Geschichte der Deutschen Litteratur, 8th ed. [Berlin 1899].)\n\nScheuer (Scheurer, Scheyer), Johann Anton (born 1763–1849): From 28 October 1792 member of the Mainz Jacobin Club, police commissioner, from 19 March 1793 deputy in the Rhinish-German National Assembly representing Klein-Winterheim; fled Mainz on 30 March 1793, though was betrayed and captured by the Prussians, then imprisoned till 1795. See his succinct description in the pro-Prussian list of Clubbists Getreues Namenverzeichnis der in Mainz sich befindenden 454 Klubbisten, mit Bemerkung derselben Charakter (Frankfurt 1793), 13–14: “Scheuer, quartermaster, captured by the Prussians.” He emigrated to France, returning to Germany in 1796 as a member of the French administration on the left bank of the Rhine.\n\nSchick, Gottlieb (1779 [1776?]–1812): Painter native of Stuttgart, where he studied under scholarship for four years at the Karl Academy. Studied in Paris under Jacques-Louis David from 1798 till 1802, starting to do portraiture; journeyed to Rome that same year, where he stayed till 1811. Felt wholly unappreciated in Stuttgart, where, however, he returned to die in 1812.\n\nSchierstädt (Schierstaedt, Schierstett), August Wilhelm von (1781–13 April 1827): Prussian officer with literary aspirations who later married two Finckensteins, including, from 1814, Luise von Finckenstein. While still in Berlin, Wilhelm Schlegel mentions him in a letter to Ludwig Tieck on 13 March 1804 (Briefe an Ludwig Tieck 3:293; Lohner 152) among his students with respect to work on the second volume of his (Wilhelm’s) Spanisches Theater, which did not appear until 1809.\n\nSchikaneder, Emanuel Johann (1751–1812): Viennese theater director and libretto composer who composed the libretto of The Magic Flute, for which Mozart, an old friend from Salzburg, supplied the music. (Portrait: Philipp Stein, Deutsche Schauspieler: eine Bildnissammlung, vol. 1, Das achtzehnte Jahrhundert, Schriften der Gesellschaft für Theatergeschichte 9 [Berlin 1907], no. 105.)\n\nSchilcher, Franz Salis von (1766–1843): Bavarian civil servant, forestry administrator, finance administrator. From 1790 taught at the forestry school in Munich, from 1793 administrator, traveling throughout Germany in various matter relating to forestry. From 1799 upper level administrative official, from 1804 director of the territorial administration in Würzburg, from 1817 deputy president of the supreme financial administration.\n\nSchill, Ferdinand von (6 January 1776–31 May 1809): Prussian major in the Hussar regiment, led an insurrection against Napoleon and the French in northern Germany after the commencement of the War of 1809. Eleven of his officers were executed in Wesel after Schill himself was killed in action in Stralsund. (Portrait: Friedrich Neubauer, Preussens Fall und Erhebung 1806–1815 [Berlin 1908], 249.)\n\nSchiller, Charlotte, née von Lengefeld (1766–1826): Friedrich Schiller’s wife, sister of Caroline von Wolzogen, godchild of Charlotte von Stein. Met Schiller in Rudolstadt in 1787. Although Schiller was for a time passionately attracted to her sister, Caroline, the latter was already married at the time. In August 1789 Charlotte and Schiller became engaged, marrying in 1790 in a village near Jena. (Portrait: after Ludovike Simanowiz.)\n\nSchiller, Emilie Henriette Luise (25 July 1804–72): Born in Jena, youngest daughter of Friedrich Schiller; later married to Adelbert von Gleichen-Russwurm (1803–87).\n\nSchiller, Ernst Friedrich Wilhelm (11 July 1796–19 May 1841): Schiller’s youngest son, born a few days after Caroline and Wilhelm Schlegel arrived in Jena. Studied law in Jena and pursued a career in Trier and Cologne, marrying into a well-to-do family in Bonn. His mother, Charlotte Schiller, died in Bonn while visiting him in 1826, and when he himself died there in 1841, he was buried in the same cemetery plot, albeit on top of his mother’s casket, which allegedly collapsed under the weight.\n\nSchiller, Johann Christoph Friedrich (von) (10 November 1759–9 May 1805): Poet, philosopher, historian, and dramatist, generally viewed with Goethe as the preeminent representative of the classical period in German literary history (Weimar Classicism). Born in Marbach, in Württemberg, and initially destined for the clergy, he ended up instead at the military academy of the duke of Württemberg, where he unwillingly studied medicine until he was twenty one. During his time there he worked on his play Die Räuber (1780), whose premiere he attended without permission, being then arrested by the duke and forbidden from writing after a second journey there. From 1780 to 1782 served as regimental physician in Stuttgart, during which time Die Räuber was performed in Mannheim, where Schiller fled in September 1782, receiving asylum for a time on the estate of Henriette von Wolzogen, who became his patroness. Pursuing his career as a playwright, he became the resident poet at the Mannheim Theater in 1783, his play Kabale und Liebe enjoying great success there. In increasing financial difficulty and after an unsuccessful affair with Charlotte von Kalb, in 1785 he journeyed to Leipzig and Dresden at the invitation of Chrisitan Gottfried Körner, Ludwig Ferdinand Huber, and their fiancées, Minna and Dora Stock, which improved his finances; he continued working on plays (the historical drama Don Carlos, which appeared in 1787) and writing in other genres. From 1787 he lived in Weimar, meeting and marrying Charlotte von Lengefeld in 1790 and publishing a piece on the history of the Netherlands in 1788, a work that prompted his appointment as professor of history in Jena in 1789, and a history of the Thirty Years War (1790/92). The position in Jena did not, however, offer much financial support. After serious health problems in 1791, he received a stipend from Prince Friedrich Christian and Count Heinrich Ernst von Schimmelmann. Thereafter he began an intensive study of Kant, became a closer friend of Goethe beginning in 1794 (their initial contact had been somewhat reserved if not strained), and published several philosophical pieces dealing with ethical and aesthetic issues. From 1795 edited Die Horen and in 1796 published the Xenien with Goethe satirizing their critics. In 1797 he finally began writing plays again, producing several classics during the next few years, including the historical tragedy and trilogy Wallenstein (1797–98), performed in 1799, then Maria Stuart in 1800, Die Jungfrau von Orleans in 1801, Die Braut von Messina, which included a chorus, in 1803, and Wilhelm Tell in 1804. Died in 1805 possibly of diverticulitis. (Portrait: 1794, by Ludovike Simanowiz.)\n\nSchiller, Karl Ludwig Friedrich (14 September 1793–21 June 1857): Schiller’s eldest son. (Portrait: from Walter Weber, “Karl von Schiller. Zum 100. Todestag des vergessenen Sohnes unseres großen Dichters,” Schwäbische Heimat [1957].)\n\nSchiller, Karoline Henriette Luise Friederike, married name Junot (11 October 1799–1850): Schiller’s eldest daughter.\n\nSchilling, Friedrich Gustav (1766–1839): Writer and poet, especially of stories and novels, generally typical society novels, though several of his poems appeared in Schiller’s periodical Thalia. Known today primarily for his erotic novel Die Denkwürdigkeiten des Herrn v. H. (Rome 1787).\n\nSchinderhannes (John the Scorcher), nickname of Johann Buckler (1779–1803): Head of a gang of highwaymen in the central Rhineland (on both sides of the Rhine) ca. 1800, who subsequently also became the subject of popular legends. Executed with nineteen of his followers on 21 November 1803 in Mainz by beheading. (Portrait by Karl Matthias Ernst; Stadtarchiv Mainz.)\n\nSchirmer: Unidentified merchant in Jena, apparently a grocer, to whom not only Friedrich Schlegel and Dorothea Veit, but also Caroline and Wilhelm Schlegel owed money.\n\nSchlabrendorf, Caroline von (1761–1833): Strong-willed member of the Berlin aristocracy with a reputation of uprightness and a resolute, no-nonsense, sometimes brusque character. After her spouse died early, she seems to have kept her distance from high society in Berlin and turned more toward company she herself chose. Advocated the French Revolution, even in Prussian society, and while on a trip to France sometimes wore men’s clothing so as “not to be reminded each and every moment that she was only a woman” (so Varnhagen von Ense). She was, however, also known for her fierce loyalty to friends and family. Rahel Levin accompanied her to Paris in 1800–1801, where Schlabrendorf’s uncle, an essayist, was living.\n\nSchläger, Angelica (1749–4 May 1824): Daughter of Carl Julius and Sarah Elisabeth Schläger and thus a granddaughter of Mother Schläger. Married to Johann Gottlieb Siegfried, an officer in the ducal military in Gotha and author of several military essays.\n\nSchläger, Sara Dorothea (born 1743): Daughter of Carl Julius and Sarah Elisabeth Schläger; from 2 June 1767 married to Jacob August Rousseau (1729–1808).\n\nSchläger, Carl Julius (or Julius Carl/Karl) (25 September 1706–14 June 1786): Native of Hannover, initially a professor of philology in Helmstedt, then from 1744 director of the ducal library in Gotha, from 1747 numismatist, and from 1737 husband of Sarah Elisabeth (“Madam,” “Mother”) Schläger; the date of his death puts Luise Michaelis yet in Gotha at that time, since she mentions being there when he died. Among some acquaintances, Schläger did not otherwise enjoy a particularly good reputation either as a person or as an official. See the remarks of Reichard, Selbstbiographie, in the entry on Schläger’s wife, Sarah Elisabeth Schläger. (Portrait: courtesy of Rudolf W. L. Jacobs, Archiv der schleswig-thüringischen Familie Jacobs.)\n\nSchläger, Dorothea Luise (Louise, Louisa) (canoness/Chanoinesse) (born 1744): Sarah Elisabeth Schläger’s daughter in Gotha (not her sister-in-law as identified in Wieneke [1914], 561, with respect to letter 163). Luise Wiedemann, Erinnerungen, 13–14, refers to her as “an unmarried daughter” who had a position as chanoinesse in the convent Winhausen (Wienhausen, 15 km southeast of Celle; originally Roman Catholic, then first Protestant abbess attested in 1587) (perhaps the daughter Reichard, Selbstbiographie, 136, mentions; see the entry on Sarah Elisabeth Schläger).\n\nSchläger, Sarah Elisabeth (also “Schlaeger,” “Madam Schläger,” “Mother Schläger”), née Schauer (1722–12 August 1803): Native of Hannover. Head of a home-based boarding school for girls in Gotha, from 1737 wife of the senior ducal librarian and (from 1747) numismatist in Gotha, Carl Julius Schläger (1706–14 June 1786). Their children’s years of birth: 1740 Johann Ludwig; 1743 Sara Dorothea; 1744 Dorothea Louisa; 1749 Angelique; 1750 Sophia (†1756).\n\nCaroline lived with the family for two years while attending the school, and both Lotte and Luise Michaelis similarly attended the school (Lotte from late 1780 till April 1782, Luise from autumn 1784 till summer 1786). Concerning her personality, however, see the remarks by Reichard, Selbstbiographie, 135–36, who remarks that on receiving the title and privileges of a librarian in Gotha in 1775, he experienced\n\nthe vehement opposition of the aged senior librarian, Hofrath Carl Julius Schläger [Madam Schläger’s husband]. This scholar, doubtless one of the greatest numismatics who ever lived, was as a private individual an overbearing, grouchy, and ill-dispositioned pedant—with respect to insufferableness quite the worthy pendant to his highly repugnant spouse. She, like Schläger himself, was groveling toward distinguished persons while simultaneously abusing those subject to her. Both individuals were loathed to an unusual degree. I was present when Madam Schläger introduced her youngest daughter, whose godparent was Cardinal Quirini of Rome, an erudite correspondent of her father, to Abbé Raynal. Since this particular daughter was already along in years, the Abbé addressed her as ‘Madame,’ whereupon her mother reminded him that ‘the child’ was ‘still unmarried’; –– ‘Tant pis! [too bad]’ responded the ungalant Frenchman in a tone so sarcastic that even Madam Schläger was discouraged from tending a response.\n\nSchlegel, August Wilhelm (8 September 1767 Hannover–12 May 1845 Bonn): From 1 July 1796 Caroline’s second husband (divorced on 17 May 1803); Caroline refers to him as Wilhelm rather than August Wilhelm. Writer, critic, translator, philologist. Elder brother of Friedrich Schlegel. From 1786 studied theology and philology in Göttingen, where he became closely acquainted with Gottfried August Bürger, who acted as his literary mentor, the two also translating Shakespeare’s Midsummer Night’s Dream; after Schiller’s severe criticism of Bürger in 1791, Schlegel never had a genuinely easy relationship with Schiller. It was during this period that he first got to know Caroline, who had returned to her family in Göttingen after being widowed. From 1791 he worked as a private house tutor in Amsterdam and was already active as literary a critic and reviewer, then being invited by Schiller to contribute to the latter’s periodical Die Horen. He returned to Braunschweig in 1795, married Caroline on 1 July 1796, after which they moved to Jena, where he could be nearer Schiller. From 1798 professor in Jena, during which time he also published the periodical Athenaeum, the new Romantic school’s primary programmatic publication, with his brother Friedrich, who after spending some time in Jena in 1796 and returning to Berlin, returned to Jena in 1799 with Dorothea Veit. During this time Wilhelm also began his translation of Shakespeare (1797–1810), having already announced his work in Schiller’s Die Horen. He was also extraordinarily active as a critic and reviewer during this period. After Auguste’s death in July 1800, he and Caroline moved to Braunschweig for a time, and since various problems and polemical issues had made Jena less attractive for him, he moved from Braunschweig to Berlin in February 1801 without Caroline. There he delivered private lectures on literature and art (1801–4). After his divorce from Caroline in 1803, in 1804 he followed Madame de Staël back to her estate (Coppet) near Geneva as private tutor to her children, though his position was rather loosely defined and he had ample time for his own work as well. He remained with her until her death in 1817, traveling literally all over Europe—to Germany, Austria, Italy, Russia, and Sweden (accompanying the Swedish crown prince, Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte [from 1818 Charles XIV John of Sweden], as his secretary)—when she fled Napoleon, he even becoming a French-language anti-Napoleon propagandist for the Swedish general Bernadotte. In 1808 he delivered an important series of lectures on dramatic art and literature (Vorlesungen über dramatische Kunst und Literatur, published 1809–11). In 1818 he was in line for an appointment as professor in Berlin but chose Bonn instead so that his new wife, Sophie Paulus, daughter of H. E. G. Paulus, could be nearer her mother (Paulus was teaching in Heidelberg at the time), but in a bitter dispute between Wilhelm and the family, Sophie never joined him in Bonn—or anywhere else—as his wife, though they never divorced. In Bonn he spent the rest of his life as a respected scholar of Sanskrit and Indian studies, in which capacity he is also viewed as one of the founders of modern comparative linguistics. (Portrait: ca. 1800/1802, unknown artist, possibly Johann Friedrich Bury; original: CC-BY-NC-SA @ Freies Deutsches Hochstift / Frankfurter Goethe-Museum.)\n\nSchlegel, Charlotte Anna Christiana, née Trummer (27 March 1757–31 August 1853): Native of Harburg, daughter of Paul (1718–95) and Anna Maria (née Rumpff) Trummer, who moved to Hamburg; great niece of the Hamburg mayor Vincent Rumpff; wife of Moritz Schlegel.\n\nSchlegel, Dorothea, née Brendel (= Veronica) Mendelssohn, divorced Veit, married (von) Schlegel (1764–1839): Writer, translator, wife of Friedrich Schlegel, eldest daughter of the Berlin philosopher Moses Mendelssohn. From 1784 married to the Berlin banker Simon Veit at her father’s behest. With Rahel Levin and Henriette Herz became involved in the progressive literary and intellectual circles of Berlin. In the salon of Henriette Herz, she met Friedrich Schlegel, who had moved to Berlin in July 1797 and who subsequently praised Dorothea in letters to Wilhelm, relating how he had rediscovered his youth in her arms. He wrote the essay “Über die Philosophie” in Athenaeum (1799) and took their relationship as a model for at least part of his novel Lucinde (1799). Although there was initially no talk of marriage, Dorothea divorced Veit in 1798, moved into her own apartment in Berlin with her son Philipp, and continued her relationship with Friedrich, moving to Jena with him in September 1799 and into Wilhelm and Caroline’s house. She had already begun translating in Berlin, and now began a novel of her own, which Friedrich published anonymously, Florentin (1801). She also contributed to Athenaeum and continued translating, though her health began hindering her writing (including the continuation of her novel). Spent time in Leipzig in April and May 1801; after Friedrich went to Berlin in November, she moved in with his sister Charlotte Ernst in Dresden in January 1802, where Friedrich soon joined her. In the spring of 1802 they moved to Paris, where she continued working on translation adaptations (some of which Friedrich published) and contributed material to his periodical Europa. In April 1804 she converted to Protestantism and married Friedrich. In the spring of 1804 they moved to Cologne, where she spent much time alone while Friedrich was away on trips (e.g., to visit Wilhelm at the estate of Madame de Staël in Switzerland). Here she completed her translation of de Staël’s novel Corinne, which Friedrich published under his name as translator in 1807–8. In April 1808 they converted to Catholicism. From 1808 in Vienna, where Friedrich found employment in the imperial administration. Although she traveled to Rome to see her sons 1818–20, she returned to Vienna, where she remained until Friedrich’s death in 1829. In 1830 she moved in with her son Philipp in Frankfurt. (Portrait: Dorothea v. Schlegel geb. Mendelssohn und deren Söhne Johannes und Philipp Veit: Briefwechsel, ed. J. M. Raich, 2 vols. [Mainz 1881], frontispiece to vol. 1.)\n\nConcerning her year of birth: In older literature and on her gravestone, one finds the date 1763, but this is the birth year of her older sister Sara (23 May 1763–15 April 1764), whose untimely death was one of the reasons Moses Mendelssohn wrote his Phaedon oder über die Unsterblichkeit der Seele (Berlin 1767); see Moses Mendelssohn’s letter to Thomas Abbt on 1 May 1764, Moses Mendelssohn, Gesammelte Schriften, ed. G. B. Mendelssohn, vol. 5 [Leipzig 1844] 315): “Several domestic blows have recently so shaken me that I have not even had the desire to engage in my favorite activity, namely, writing to my friends. Death has knocked at my door and robbed me of a child who lived but eleven innocent months on earth, albeit — praise God! — cheerfully and full of promise.”\n\nSchlegel, Henriette Wilhelmine (Jette, Jettchen) (20 February 1761–3 February 1801): Younger sister of Friedrich and Wilhelm Schlegel; from 1795 married to Pastor Sigmund Ernst in Hildesheim-Moringen, the younger brother of Ludwig Emmanuel Ernst, Charlotte Ernst’s (née Schlegel) husband (Ernst Behler, Friedrich Schlegel in Selbstzeugnissen und Bilddokumenten [Reinbeck bei Hamburg 1966], 13).\n\nSchlegel, Johann Adolf (1721–16 September 1793): Consistory councilor and superintendent in Hannover, father of Wilhelm and Friedrich Schlegel; from 5 September 1752 husband of Johanna Christiane Erdmuthe, née Hübsch. Writer (contributor to the Bremer Beiträage, composer of numerous hymns), Protestant cleric, brother of the writer and theorist Johann Elias Schlegel (1719–49). (Portrait: Gustav Könnecke, Bilderatlas zur Geschichte der deutschen Nationallitteratur, 2nd ed. [Marburg 1895], 212.)\n\nSchlegel, Johanna Christiane Erdmuthe, née Hübsch (10 April 1734– 21 January 1811): Mother of Wilhelm and Friedrich Schlegel (she often signed her letters Mother Schlegel); from 5 September 1752 wife of Johann Adolf Schlegel, whom she met when he was working at Schulpforta, where from 1725 her own father, Johann Georg Gotthelf Hübsch (1690–1773), taught mathematics (his pupils including Friedrich Gottlob Klopstock); she herself was born and died in Schulpforta.\n\nSchlegel, Julie (Julchen, Jülchen) († 1836): Wife of Karl Schlegel, daughter of Göttingen professor Johann Christian Polykarp Erxleben and Sophie Juliane, née Stromeyer.\n\nSchlegel, Johann Karl Fürchtegott (1758–1831): Brother of Friedrich and Wilhelm Schlegel, husband of Julie Schlegel, née Erxleben. Attended school in Hannover, studied philosophy, history, and law in Göttingen 1779–82, from 1782 member of the consistory in Hannover, eventual consistory secretary. Active in trying to improve the legal status of Jewish residents in Hannover.\n\nSchlegel, Karl Wilhelm Friedrich (Fritz, Uncle Fritz) (10 March 1772 in Hannover–11/12 January 1829 in Dresden): Writer, critic, philosopher. Younger brother of August Wilhelm Schlegel. Initially sent to Leipzig as an apprentice to prepare for a career in banking but soon quit and was permitted to pursue university studies after studying on his own to pass his Abitur in 1789. Studied in Göttingen and Leipzig (where he became acquainted with Friedrich von Hardenberg, Novalis) in 1790–94, first law, then philosophy, history, and classical philology. In 1793, while in Leipzig, he acted as a courier for letters between Caroline in Lucka and Wilhelm in Amsterdam and was godfather to her child born there. Joined Wilhelm and Caroline in Jena in 1796, he the more philosophically inclined of the two brothers and as such the one ultimately providing much of the philosophical articulation for the nascent “Romantic school.” Even before moving to Jena, he had already published articles in J. F. Reichard’s journals Deutschland and Lyceum der schönen Künste on contemporary German literature and had esp. been engaged in an intensive study of classical antiquity, on which he published several important pieces, including esp. Über das Studium der griechischen Poesie (1797), Die Griechen und Römer (1797), and Geschichte der Poesie der Griechen und Römer (1798), anticipating with the contrast between “objective” and “interesting” Schiller’s contrast between “naive” and “sentimental” with regard to ancient and modern writers. Apparently after alienating Schiller (the reason is not really documented), Friedrich was advised to leave Jena, moving thence to Berlin, where he frequented the leading literary and cultural salons and met Dorothea Veit, his later wife. His essay on Goethe’s novel Wilhelm Meister is viewed as one of the program statements of the group, and his own novel, Lucinde (1799), created a sensation with its characters–obviously based on Friedrich and Dorothea–and erotic subject matter and candor. He returned to Jena with Dorothea in 1799 (though they were not yet married) for the brief florescence of the Romantic school, though trouble within the group was quick to surface. He acquired his doctorate in Jena with a rather chaotic public defense (documented in this edition) and then tried to establish himself as a lecturer in transcendental philosophy; was essentially overwhelmed by the power of Schelling’s popularity when the latter returned from Bamberg and resumed his own lecturing. Friedrich’s play Alarcos (1802) was a failure. After the group dissolved he and Dorothea moved to Paris in 1802, where he studied Sanskrit and published the journal Europa (1803–05), moving then to Cologne in 1804 and converting with Dorothea to Catholicism in 1808, his own thought having taken a clearly more conservative, Christian turn in the meantime. From 1808 in Vienna, where he worked as a secretary at the Viennese court, socializing in conservative circles there; also participated in the Congress of Vienna and the Frankfurt meeting of the German Confederation (1815–18) and even served in Prince Wenzel Lothar von Metternich’s entourage in Italy for a time. His later lectures on history, literature, and philosophy along with his journal Concordia were characterized by cultural conservatism and an inclination to mysticism. (Portrait: 4 March 1798, anonymous pencil drawing; reproduced in Briefe von und an Friedrich und Dorothea Schlegel, ed. Josef Körner [Berlin 1926], following p. 20.)\n\nSchlegel, Johann Elias (1719–49): Wilhelm and Friedrich Schlegel’s uncle. Had his early schooling with Friedrich Gottlob Klopstock at Schulpforta, then studied at the university in Leipzig, thereafter contributing to the periodicals of Johann Christoph Gottsched. Thereafter a Saxon minister in Copenhagen and from 1748 professor at a secondary school for sons of the nobility in Sore. Prolific playwright and critic, in the latter capacity also as the author of a study of Shakespeare and Andreas Gryphius (1741), one of the earliest positive assessments of Shakespeare.\n\nSchlegel, Karl (Carl) August (1761–9 September 1789): Elder brother of Wilhelm and Friedrich Schlegel; from 1782 an engineering officer with the Hannoverian regiment serving in Madras, India, undertaking a journey 800 miles into the interior of the country with the English general Sir John Dalling, from 1788 then also undertaking surveying work in the foothills of Carnatic (results now in the British Museum). Left behind a manuscript in English of a largely military geographical study of India, presumably still in the possession of the university library in Göttingen. Died and was also interred in Madras.\n\nSchlegel, Karl August Moritz (Moriz) (1756–1826): Eldest brother of Wilhelm and Friedrich Schlegel; from 1790 assistant pastor in Harburg, from 1796 superintendent in Göttingen, from 1816 general superintendent and senior pastor in Harburg; respected both as a preacher and a church administrator. Married to Charlotte, née Trummer (1757–1853). His son, Johann August Adolph Schlegel (1790–1840), a philologist, studied under his uncle Wilhelm Schlegel in Bonn from 1829.\n\nSchleiden, Anna: Youngest daughter of Matthias Schleiden († 1802) and his wife Anna, née Langheim, who moved to Kiel late in life from their rural estate Lütjenhorn near Tønder and Agtrup in what is today southern Denmark; from autumn 1818 wife of Johannes Horkel (1769–1846), professor of comparative physiology in Berlin, whom she met in Kiel shortly after her mother’s death. Acquaintance of Luise Wiedemann while she was still in Kiel.\n\nSchleiden, Elise, née van Nuys (9 July 1785–1874): Eldest daughter of Wilhelmine (Minna) Elisabeth (Elisa) van Nuys, sister-in-law of Anna Schleiden (Horkel), whose brother Christian, a merchant, she married on 25 January 1806, residing initially in Bremen, then Ascheberg in Holstein (just southeast of Kiel, whence her acquaintance with Luise and C. R. W. Wiedemann). She lived in Braunschweig with her mother when Caroline and Wilhelm Schlegel were there in 1800–1801 and was confirmed there on 2 April 1801. (Portrait: frontispiece to Rudolf Schleiden, Jugenderinnerungen eines Schleweig-Holsteiners, vol. 1 [Wiesbaden 1886].)\n\nSchleiermacher, Friederike Charlotte (Lotte) (31 March 1765–1831): Sister of Friedrich Schleiermacher.\n\nSchleiermacher (Schleyermacher), Friedrich Daniel Ernst (1768 Breslau–1834 Berlin): Theologian; though closely associated with the early Romantic circle in Jena, he and Caroline never met in person. His early education was considerably influenced by Pietism; chafing under Moravian instruction, he asked permission from his father to break off that schooling in 1787, enrolling thereafter to study theology in Halle, at the time a center of Enlightenment thinking. He remained in Halle till 1789, passing his final theological examination in Berlin in 1794. In the meantime he had become a private house tutor to a count in Schlobitten, where he wrote several philosophical pieces. After leaving Schlobitten in 1793 (under strained conditions), he eventually took a position in Berlin and published a piece on Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi’s writings on Spinoza. From 1794 he became a pastor in Landsberg, then from September 1796 preacher at the Berlin Charité Hospital.\n\nHe met Friedrich Schlegel while frequenting several of the literary salons in Berlin, eventually also rooming with him almost two years; it was during this period that the two began a collaborative translation of Plato, though Schlegel eventually left the work to Schleiermacher (much to the latter’s vexation). From 1802 he was pastor in Stolp, which he considered a kind of “exile,” his superiors in Berlin having become uncomfortable with his contact with the literary avant-garde (he was also intensively involved in Athenaeum) and with Jews, including Henriette Herz. His most important contribution to the Romantic school, his Reden über die Religion (1799), were initially published anonymously. In them he articulated an understanding of religion as the “perception of the universe” and as a union with the infinite which exerted enormous influence on subsequent theology. A piece on ethics followed in 1800, the Monologen, and a piece on the origin and nature of the Christian faith, Die Weihnachtsfeier (1806). In 1804 was a candidate for an appointment at the university in Würzburg, which he “declined” by having the Prussian court refuse to grant him leave; he received an appointment in Halle instead. After Prussia’s defeat in 1806, when the university in Halle was closed down, Schleiermacher moved back to Berlin, eventually accepting an appointment at the new university (1810) and becoming the first dean of theology there and remaining in Berlin the rest of his life. From 1809 married to Henriette von Willich (1788–1840). His most important later work, Der christliche Glaube nach den Grundsätzen der evangelischen Kirche was published in 1821/22. (Portrait: Hugo Bürkner, in Zweihundert deutsche Männer in Bildnissen und Lebensbeschreibungen, ed. Ludwig Bechstein [Leipzig 1854], s.v. [unpaginated].)\n\nSchleusner, Gabriel Jonathan (6 July 1767–8 [9?] October 1798): From Danzig, physician, received his doctorate in 1796, 1796–98 assistant director of the maternity institute in Jena, conferred as a university lecturer in medicine there on 18 March 1797 but died on 8 or 9 October 1798. Translated various works from the French. Died not in Jena, as several lexica maintain, but in Schorndorf in Swabia, as Caroline herself confirms.\n\nSchlichtegroll, Adolf Heinrich Friedrich von (1765–1822): Writer, archaeologist, librarian, numismatist. From 1783 studied law in Jena, then theology and philology, then transferred to Göttingen to study under Christian Gottlob Heyne. From 1792 married to Auguste, née Rousseau from Gotha (a granddaughter of Mother Schläger), with whom he had four sons and a daughter. From 1787 Gymnasium teacher and active in the ducal library in Gotha, from 1799 assistant to his father-in-law (Jacques August Rousseau) in the numismatic collection; before the outbreak of the war in 1806, he managed to take the collection to Altona, i.e., to Danish territory, returning it the following year. From 1802 head ducal librarian in Gotha. From 1807 general secretary of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities (appointed by Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi), where he also oversaw the court library and several other state collections. Published on archaeological topics, including on gem collections (e.g., with mythological themes) and artifacts. Best known for his magisterial biographical reference work, Nekrolog der Deutschen (34 vols., 1790–1806), most of whose entries he himself wrote or heavily edited. (Portrait: lithography ca. 1820, by Peter von Rausch; München, Staatliche Graphische Sammlung, Inventar-Nr. 1964:194 D.)\n\nSchlichtegroll, Auguste, née Rousseau (Luise Wiedemann refers to her in her memoirs as Dorette) (1770–13 June 1832): One of the daughters of Jacques August Rousseau in Gotha, from 1792 wife of Adolf Heinrich Friedrich von Schlichtegroll, with whom she had four sons and a daughter; her sister, Charlotte, married Karl Friedrich (von) Wiebeking in 1788.\n\nSchlichtegroll, Sarah (Sara) Maria (1796–1 September 1873): One of Friedrich and Auguste Schlichtegroll’s two daughter (the other was Antonia). Maria (her preferred name), allegedly Schlichtegroll’s favorite daughter, married Heinrich August von Vogel (25 July 1778–24 November 1867) in 1816. Vogel, a professor of chemistry who succeeded Adolph Ferdinand Gehlen in Munich after studying and working in Paris, had arrived in Munich in the summer of 1816 and immediately become a member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities. A year before his death, he and Maria celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary.\n\nSchlick, Caroline (Karoline), married name Ruppius (11 November 1786–ca. 31 December 1871): Daughter of Johann Konrad and Regina Schlick; born in Gotha, became an accomplished pianist (also played the guitar and sang) who after 1800 performed and eventually toured with her parents. Ca. 1812 had additional daily lessons from Carl Maria von Weber in Gotha. Karl Ludwig von Knebel in Weimar concurs with Caroline (Schelling) that Caroline Schlick was not particularly attractive (like Caroline Schelling, however, her face seems to have been marked by the earlier effects of smallpox). Later in service as a musician at the court in Gotha. From ca. 1816–18 married to Carl Ruppius (1786–1866), a physician to Friedrich IV of Saxony-Gotha-Altenburg. Later moved with him to Freiburg/Breisgau and ultimately to Dresden.\n\nSchlick (Schlik), Johann Konrad (1748–1818): Composer, musician (cellist). Initially a cellist in the cathedral orchestra in Münster, Schlick came to Gotha in 1777 at the behest of Duke Ernst Ludwig II, remaining there as member and secretary of the court orchestra but also touring extensively in Germany, Italy, Hungary, and Russia. Private concerts at his home were one of the premiere musical events of cultural life in Gotha at the time. Although Amalie Seidler apparently had a serious relationship with Schlick before it was surreptitiously disrupted both by her eventual (from February 1786) husband, H. A. O. Reichard, and, apparently at Reichard’s request and in a rather strong-armed fashion, by the duke himself (see the supplementary appendix Amalie Reichard), Schlick married Regina Strina-Sacchi (1761–1839) in 1785, a well-known Italian-born violinist at the time who once performed the Sonata in B Major before the emperor with Mozart, who had written it for her. Their daughter, allegedly an accomplished pianist, seems to have performed with her parents later as well. Both Caroline and Reichard mention how handsome Schlick was, and Caroline later seems to have met both Schlick and his daughter in Munich, having been introduced to them by the pianist Josepha von Fladt.\n\nSchlick, Regina, née Strina-Sacchi (28 February 1761–11 June 1839): Daughter of a professor in Mantua, celebrated violin player (also played guitar and composed) who received her musical training largely in Venice. Lived in Paris, from 4 October 1785 married to Johann Konrad Schlick, with whom she regularly performed. She and her husband settled in Gotha sometime after 1786. Their daughter, Caroline (born 1786), was an accomplished pianist in her own right and later performed with them. Their son Johann Friedrich Wilhelm (born 1801) was an accomplished cellist and chamber musician. Regina Schlick impressed Mozart with her playing, and in 1786 performed with him a sonata he had composed for her before the emperor Joseph II in Vienna, albeit only after providing the violin part to her quite late; Mozart performed the piano part from memory. Regina later sold her 1718 Stradivarius to Louis Spohr; today it is played by Miriam Fried. (Portrait: Hans Timotheus Kroeber, Die Goethezeit in Silhouetten: 74 Silhouetten in ganzer Figur vornehmlich aus Weimar und Umgebung [Weimar 1911], plate 37.)\n\nSchlosser, Johann Friedrich (Fritz) Heinrich (1780–1851): Native of Frankfurt and one of two sons of the Frankfurt administrative official Hieronymus Peter Schlosser (1735–97), the latter a friend of Goethe. Fritz Schlosser studied law in Jena, where he also attended the Schelling’s lectures on the philosophy of art during the winter semester 1802–3. After receiving his doctorate in 1803, he worked as an attorney, then from 1812 as director of the grand ducal Lycaeum in Frankfurt. He converted to Catholicism in 1814 and represented Frankfurt at the Congress of Vienna. His country estate near Heidelberg became a gathering place for artists, literary figures, and scholars, and he helped Goethe, whose Frankfurt business he took care of, with the writing of the autobiographical Dichtung und Wahrheit, providing material relating to Frankfurt history. He supported the Nazarene group of German painters in Rome and later donated his voluminous library to the Catholic seminary in Mainz.\n\nSchlosser, Ludwig Wilhelm Gottlob (1774–20 June 1859): A native of Roda in Saxony-Altenburg, son of a physician. Graduated from the Gymnasium in Schleiz before studying theology in Erlangen. Worked initially as a private family tutor in Nürnberg, then in 1798 became pastor in Drakendorf, near Jena, where he remained until 1811 before taking over the pastorate in Grosszschocher near Leipzig, where he remained until his retirement in 1855. Lived out the rest of his life in Lindendau, located a bit closer to Leipzig. In 1846 he began composing his memoirs, Erlebnisse eines sächsischen Landpredigers in den Kriegsjahren 1806–1815 (Wiesbaden 1914). Also contributed articles to popular encyclopedias and translated.\n\nSchlözer, August (1788–91): Youngest son of August Ludwig Schlözer.\n\nSchlözer, August Ludwig von (1735–1809): Historian, politician, writer, journalist, husband of Caroline Friederike Schlözer, née Röderer. From 1751 studied theology in Wittenberg, then transferred to Göttingen to study theology under Caroline’s father, Johann David Michaelis, though he also studied natural sciences, law, and medicine. To enhance his own understanding of the Bible, he studied Near Eastern languages and geography in preparation for a trip to Palestine, reflecting his inclination to address theoretical problems through practical means. From 1755, at Michaelis’s behest, accepted a position as private house tutor to the pastor of the German congregation in Stockholm. He spent 1761–70 in Russia as a private house tutor and then as a teacher of Russian history, laying the groundwork for his most famous work, an edition of the Old Russian Nestor Chronical (1802–9). Czar Alexander I rewarded his service to Russian historical studies by ennobling him. Ultimately accepted a professorial appointment in Göttingen, where he taught universal history. Known for having insisted on gathering as much information from diverse fields as possible in order to understand a country and its history. (Portrait 1798, from Leopold von Schlözer, Dorothea von Schlözer, der Philosophie Doctor. Ein deutsches Frauenleben um die Jahrhundertwende 1770–1825 [Berlin, Leipzig 1923], plate following p. 8.)\n\nSchlözer, Caroline Friederike, née Röderer (1753–1808): From November 1769 wife of August Ludwig von Schlözer. She was also the sister of J. C. Loder’s wife and daughter of Johann Georg Röderer (1726–63), professor of medicine at Göttingen and personal physician to the king of England. (Portrait from Leopold von Schlözer, Dorothea von Schlözer, der Philosophie Doctor. Ein deutsches Frauenleben um die Jahrhundertwende 1770–1825 [Berlin, Leipzig 1923].)\n\nSchlözer, Christian (1774–1831): Son of August Ludwig von Schlözer in Göttingen; became a professor of political science first in Moscow, then in Bonn.\n\nSchlözer, Dorothea (Dortchen), married name Rodde (1770–1825): Daughter of August Ludwig Schlözer and one of the Göttingen “university mamsells.” Learned to write at four and began studying geometry, French, and Latin at five, had learned ten languages by the time she was sixteen. Studied a variety of subjects in addition to languages, including mathematics, history, mineralogy (spending five weeks in the Harz Mountains studying mining), natural science, botany, chemistry, and even medicine. When she was eleven (winter semester 1781/82), she accompanied her father on a six-month journey to Italy, even meeting Pope Pius VI. In September 1787, encouraged by her father, who wanted to demonstrate that women, too, were capable of such intellectual accomplishments, she was promoted to doctor of philosophy with an oral examination at Caroline’s parents’ home, with Johann David Michaelis as dean of the philosophical faculty presiding (rather than publicly, as was normally the case), albeit with no written dissertation. In 1791, with her father’s help, she published Münz-, Geld- und Bergwerksgeschichte des Russischen Kaiserthums von 1700–1789 (1791). In 1792 she married Mattheus (Matthäus) Rodde, a merchant, senator, and later mayor of Lübeck, whom she had met on yet another journey with her father (to Hamburg, Kiel, and Lübeck), thereafter signing her name Rodde-Schlözer, the first woman in German to sign a double name. Hosted a cultural salon in Lübeck while also socializing with similar circles in nearby Eutin. After her husband went bankrupt in 1810, the family moved to Göttingen. (Leopold von Schlözer, Dorothea von Schlözer, der Philosophie Doctor: Ein deutsches Frauenleben um die Jahrhundertwende 1770–1825 [Berlin, Leipzig 1923], plate following p. 208.)\n\nSee Piter Poel, Bilder aus vergangener Zeit 245–46:\n\nAfter his [August Ludwig Schlözer’s] return from Italy, where he had journeyed in a four-seater carriage with his daughter, two students, and a tutor . . . I saw his daughter, Dorothea, later married name Rodde, in the assemblées several times, which took place every two weeks alternating between the Pütter and Böhmer houses. Although she was hardly twelve years old, she was already playing a role in Göttingen society, answering the adults’ questions quite intelligently and unaffectedly while at the same time not at all denying her age among her younger friends, with whom she was certainly wont to indulge her childish frivolity and cheerfulness. Hence she and I also occasionally jested with each other, later recalling these fleeting moments with a bit of melancholy when fate brought us together again later. Her glowing appearance and serene disposition did not at all betray the enormous effort with which she had to pursue her study of the ancient languages, the history of antiquity, philosophy, mathematics, and other disciplines according to the will of her stubborn father in preparation for attaining a doctorate, in connection with which she surrendered herself over, as it were, at sixteen or seventeen years of age as a kind of festooned sacrifice to the curious Göttingen public. The violence visited on her nerves at the time was not without its deleterious effects later. She suffered later from an element of irritability that often prompted violent physical pain from the least cause, or plunged her into depression; she also acquired a certain crudeness in her movements and expressions that as little accorded with delicate femininity as did the neglect of her external appearance despite the utmost degree of cleanliness. Just as in general earlier circumstances in the parental home can explain so much of what a person carries over into adulthood from the impressions of youth, so also did much come to have a negative effect on the health and internal peace of this feminine being who was so loyally disposed, so devoted to truth, and so richly equipped by nature for pursuing her own happiness and engaging in beneficent activity.\n\nSchlözer, Karl (Carl) von (1780–1859): Son of August Ludwig von Schlözer in Göttingen; later a businessman and Russian consul general consul in Lübeck. (Portrait [Karl at 19 years old] from Leopold von Schlözer, Dorothea von Schlözer, der Philosophie Doctor.

H. A. O. Reichard, Selbstbiographie extols her charm and admits to being smitten by her himself, also recounting how a certain Herr Dürfeld committed suicide because of his unrequited love for her. Auguste Schneider allegedly also promoted the relationship between Reichard and his later wife, Amalia Seidler. The duke had charged Reichard with taking walks with Auguste during her illness in his (the duke’s) stead but with keeping that circumstance unknown to her. Although Reichard was with her on the day of her death, Therese Forster, who had been friends with her since the spring of 1783, made him leave the house before the end, only alerting him of her death later by billet. Therese speaks extensively in her letters about her friendship with Auguste Schneider and about the latter’s death. See esp. Caroline’s letter to Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig Meyer on 16 March 1794 (letter 143) with note 2 and supplementary appendix 143.1.\n\nSchneider, Eulogius (Johann Georg) (1756–1 April 1794): Franciscan monk, professor, Jacobin. Attended a Jesuit Gymnasium in Würzburg but came into conflict with his teachers, decided against studying theology and instead registered in Würzburg as a student in philosophy and law; punished for premarital sex and as a result lost his financial support as a tutor, whereupon he returned home. Began studying theology in Bamberg, where he also joined the Franciscan order (whence his name Eulogius). Finished his studies in Salzburg, where he also used the library to deepen his acquaintance with Enlightenment writings. From 1786 court preacher at the Württemberg court of Duke Carl Eugen, though his Enlightenment ideas were less welcome. From 1789 professor of literature and fine arts in Bonn, where his students included Ludwig van Beethoven. In 1789 he also left the Franciscan order, though was then dismissed from his professorship because of his controversial writings in 1791, the same year he became a Freemason, from which he was also later excluded. From 1791 in Strasbourg, where he occupied various administrative, teaching, and preaching positions while becoming an increasingly ardent supporter of the French Revolution, for a time serving as president of the Strasbourg Jacobin club and sitting on revolutionary tribunals, in which capacity he also imposed ca. thirty death sentences. Also composed a German version of the Marseillaise. Arrested on 15 December for alleged “ostentation” after his wedding and sentenced to the stocks, thereafter being taken to Paris and guillotined on 1 April 1794, presumably as part of Robespierre’s liquidations of sansculottes.\n\nScholtz, Hieronimus Gottfried (1768–1834): Prussian diplomat, early acquaintance of Rahel Levin.\n\nSchnurrer, Christian (born 1781): Eldest son of Christian Friedrich Schnurrer in Tübingen. Received his legal doctorate in 1803, worked thereafter as a legal counselor in Tübingen.\n\nSchnurrer, Christian Friedrich (28 October 1742–10 November 1822): Professor of Near Eastern studies and theology in Tübingen. Like many theologians in Württemberg, he attended the preparatory schools in Denkendorf and Maulbronn. He then attended the theological department for tutors in Göttingen, where he also studied under Caroline’s father, Johann David Michaelis, then learned Arabic in Jena and Leipzig, even studying manuscripts in Arabic in London and Paris. From 1772 professor at the university in Tübingen, from 1777 head of the seminary, and from 1806 chancellor of the university. That is, Schnurrer was head of the seminary in Tübingen during the time Hegel, Hölderlin, and Schelling attended.\n\nSchnurrer, Friedrich (6 June 1784–9 April 1833): Son of the Tübingen theologian Christian Friedrich Schnurrer. Studied medicine in Tübingen under Karl Friedrich Kielmeyer, then from 1805 in Würzburg, Bamberg, Göttingen, and Berlin. Also spent time in Paris. From 1811 a physician in Herrenberg, from 1814 Vaihingen an der Enz, from 1830 court physician and from 1832 Gehimrath in Biberich for the Duke of Nassau. Prolific writer in his field.\n\nSchönemann, Anna Elisabeth (the “Lili” of several of Goethe’s poems) (1758–1817): From Offenbach just outside Frankfurt; engaged to Goethe in the spring of 1775, though the engagement was dissolved six months later, with both sets of parents objecting. Nonetheless Goethe never forgot her, and even when he was eighty remarked that she was not only the first woman he deeply and truly loved, but perhaps also the last. (Portrait: Gustav Könnecke, Bilderatlas zur Geschichte der deutschen Nationallitteratur, 2nd ed. [Marburg 1895], 276.)\n\nSchopenhauer, Johanna, née Trosiener (1766–1838): Mother of the philosopher Arthur and the writer Adele Schopenhauer; lived initially in Danzig, from 1793 in Hamburg, acquiring financial independence after the death of her husband in 1805. From 1806 she lived in Weimar as a prolific writer and salonnière, though in 1819 she lost much of her investments but refused assistance from her son, supporting herself instead by writing; from 1832 in Bonn, from 1838 in Jena, where she died in poverty. (Portrait: by unknown artist; reproduced in Doris Maurer, Charlotte von Stein [Frankfurt am Main 1997], 230.)\n\nSchrader, Ludwig Albrecht Gottfried (1751–1815): from 1790 law professor in Kiel, from 1805 with the title of state Rath.\n\nSchröder, Anna Clara, née Reinboldt (1717–81): Caroline’s maternal grandmother; married to Göttingen postmaster Johann Eberhard Schröder.\n\nSchröder, Charlotte Sophie, née Ramberg (dates unknown): wife of Caroline’s maternal uncle, Johann Friedrich Schröder.\n\nSchröder, Friedrich Ulrich Ludwig (1744–1816): Actor, theater director, writer, translator. Possibly the most famous German actor and director of the eighteenth century. Spent his childhood largely with the itinerant theater company of his stepfather, Konrad Ackermann, first appearing on stage as a three-year-old in St. Petersburg. From 1756 his parents left him in Königsberg for schooling, then in 1759 he rejoined them in Switzerland and trained to be an actor and dancer. Profoundly influenced by Conrad Eckhof after the latter joined the Ackermann company. From 1764 he then performed at Ackermann’s theater in Hamburg, after whose death in 1771 he took over as director of the company. Became acquainted with Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in Hamburg. From 1780 toured Germany, visited Paris, then from 1781 was an actor and playwright in Vienna, 1786 back in Hamburg, where he again directed the theater in 1786–98 and 1811/12. One of his best-known roles was as Philipp II in Schiller’s play Don Carlos. He is perhaps best known for having introduced a more realistic acting style in the theater and for having brought Shakespeare (in Christoph Martin Wieland’s translation) and the plays of the Storm and Stress movement to the German stage. Adapted or translated numerous foreign plays as well. His own most successful play was probably Der Vetter in Lissabon (1786). Member of the first German Freemason group (Hamburg), for which he also developed a ritual that is still used by some groups today, even outside Germany. His close friend Friedrich Ludwig Wilhelm Meyer wrote his biography, Friedrich Ludwig Schröder: Beitrag zur Kund des Menschen und des Künstlers, 2 vols. (Hamburg 1823). (Portrait: excerpt from painting by Friedrich Carl Gröger.)\n\nSchröder, Johann Eberhard (1704–61): Caroline’s maternal grandfather, senior postmaster in Göttingen.\n\nSchröder, Johann Friedrich (1741–92): Caroline’s maternal uncle; postmaster in Göttingen till 1791 after his mother’s death in 1781, thereafter senior postmaster in Hamburg.\n\nSchröter, Corona Elisabeth Wilhelmine (1751–1802): Singer, actress, composer. (Caroline will also spell her name Schröder.) From a musical family, she trained as a singer (soprano) in Leipzig, where she performed publicly for the first time in 1765 and where she also met Goethe. Very soon, however, she became rivals in Leipzig with Gertude Elisabeth Schmeling (married name Mara), and the Leipzig public itself split into two groups. The rivalry lasted until 1771, when Schmeling went to the court in Berlin at the behest of Friedrich II. Not only was Goethe charmed by her, when Johann Friedrich Reichardt began studies in Leipzig in 1771, he was utterly smitten with love, accompanying her daily on piano. From 1776, at the behest of Goethe, who had been in Weimar only a year himself, she came to Weimar as an actress and singer at the amateur court theater, where she became what may be called a star because of her beauty and grace, especially in roles in Goethe’s plays (title role in the premiere of Iphigenie auf Tauris in 1779, opposite Goethe as Orestes), continuing to sing and act in informal settings when that theatre was replaced by professional actors in 1783. She was, however, allegedly unapproachable, Duke Karl August himself calling her as beautiful as marble but also as cold; Goethe, however, did have a relationship with her until Charolotte von Stein stepped in more forcefully, and his relationship with Schröter is still not entirely transparent, since he apparently destroyed their correspondence (except for his farewell letter to her). Schröter composed the singspiel Die Fischerin after a text by Goethe and published other songs as well. Possibly the model for the Amazon in Goethe’s novel Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre. From 1788 withdrew increasingly from court life, finally leaving Weimar in 1798 in favor of a reclusive life in Ilmenau, where she died of tuberculosis. (Portrait: Philipp Stein, Deutsche Schauspieler: eine Bildnissammlung, vol. 1, Das achtzehnte Jahrhundert, Schriften der Gesellschaft für Theatergeschichte 9 [Berlin 1907], no. 63.)\n\nSchubart, Christian Friedrich Daniel (1739–91): Writer, composer, journalist, organist. Forced to terminate his theological studies in Erlangen because of reckless behavior, eventually became court organist in Ludwigsburg but was dismissed by Duke Karl Eugen for dubious morals and expelled from Württemberg. He therafter published an anti-Roman Catholic (esp. anti-Jesuit) newspaper in which he also satirized Karl Eugen and his mistress, Franziska von Hohenheim, whereupon he was enticed back onto Würtemmberg territory and incarcerated for ten years without a trial, thereafter, however, becoming ducal theater and musical director in Stuttgart. Advocated equal rights for Jews, the elimination of slavery, and a stop to the sale of citizens as mercenary soldiers to other countries. Wrote religious poetry, political poems, and pieces evoking the style of folk songs.\n\nSchubert (Schubart) Henriette (5 January 1769–1831): Writer, translator, sister of Sophie Mereau. Born in Altenburg, spent most of her life in Jena. Collaborated on several of Sophie Mereau’s publications and published elsewhere as well, including translations of Scottish ballads and English writings. Never married, so lived in limited circumstances because she lacked personal wealth; occasionally received financial support from Sophie Mereau, including indirectly with commissions for literary works. Published the poem “Endymion” in Bernhard Vermehren’s Musen-Almanach für das Jahr 1802 (Leipzig 1802), 169–72.\n\nSchubert, Gotthilf Heinrich (1780–1860): Philosopher of nature, widely read, one of Schelling’s most loyal followers alongside Henrik Steffens. His work was not without influence on Schelling’s turn to Christian elements during the latter’s early years in Munich. Initially studied theology, then medicine, from 1801 in Jena, where he received his Dr. med. in 1803. His memoirs provide a vivid description of his studies in Jena and esp. his encounter with Schelling. Worked 1803–5 as a physician in Altenburg, then from 1806 as a freelance writer in Dresden; from 1808/09 rector of a Real-Gymnasium in Nürnberg (mediated by Schelling; Hegel was rector of the liberal-arts Gymnasium there). From 1816 to 1819 tutor to a prince, from 1819 professor in Erlangen, from 1827 in Munich (1827–41 as Schelling’s colleague).\n\nSchulenburg- Kehnert, Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von (1742–1815): Prussian administrator and general. Fought in the Seven Years’ War. From 1771 vice-president of the general directory. From 1782 head of maritime trade under Friedrich II; ennobled 1786. Then, under Friedrich Wilhelm III, he was from 1790 the head of the senior war council, from 1791 cabinet minister, from 1798 minister of finance, from 1800 general postmaster, from 1806 governor of Berlin. Administrator of Hannover during Prussian occupation. Finally entered the service of Jérome Bonaparte, King of Westphalia, as a state counselor and division general.\n\nSchulenburg-Wolfsburg, Karl Friedrich Gebhard Graf von der (1763–1818): 1782–84 student in Göttingen.\n\nSchuler, Carl Christian von (22 August 1756–23 August 1838): Son of the Electoral Hessian colonel Johann David Gotthardt von Schuler and Margaretha von Brinken, née van der Velden; married to Sophia Caroline von Hanstein (18 September 1766–31 October 1831). This extended family seems to have been the Schulers with whom Caroline was acquainted in Marburg. Carl von Schuler, who participated in the American War of Independence, subsequently moved to Hildburghausen, where his title was Grand Ducal Mecklenburg-Strelitz Chamberlain (though as late as 1824 he was still identified as a nonnative in legal matters; both he and Sophia Caroline von Schuler died and are buried in Hildburghausen). He was the brother-in-law of Louise von Hanstein, canoness in Oberkirchen, who, along with Carl von Schuler’s mother (who, divorced, followed him to Hilburghausen), also died in Hildburghausen.— Caroline later mentions the move to Hildburghausen in her letter from Munich to Luise Wiedemann, née Michaelis, on 31 January 1807 (letter 421), in which she recounts meeting two of the Hanstein sisters in Munich and mentions Minette (Wilhelmine), yet another canoness from Oberkirchen. (Biographical information from R. A. Human, Chronik der Stadt, der Diözese und des Herzogtums Hildburghausen [Hildburghausen 1886].)\n\nSchuler, Johann David Gotthardt von (dates unknown): Presumably the head of the Schuler family with whom Caroline was acquainted in Marburg, though it is by no means certain he lived in Marburg; such may have been simply his son, Carl Christian von Schuler. Married to Margarethe von Brinken, née van der Velden, though they eventually divorced; she seems to have followed her son to Hildburghausen, where she died in 1825. Served in the Hessian army during the American War of Independence, till January 1776 as a company commander.\n\nSchulte, Kaspar Detlef von (1771–1846): Till 1792 student in Göttingen, from 1824 Hannoverian minister of finance.\n\nSchulz, Joachim Christoph Friedrich (1762–98): Writer, one of the most popular authors of his day. After a period as a theology student in Halle, where he supported himself as a translator from the French, and then with a theater company in Dresden, Schulz became a freelance writer. The success of his novels and journal, the Almanach der Belletttristen und Bellettristinnen für’s Jahr 1782, he was able to travel to Berlin, Vienna, and Weimar, in the latter of which he became friends with J. J. C. Bode and the Jena professor Karl Leonhard Reinhold. Published extensively in Christoph Martin Wieland’s Teutscher Merkur. From 1789 in Paris, publishing a history of the revolution. From 1790 in Weimar, from 1791 professor of history at the Gymnasium in Mitau (in Courland, now Latvia). (Portrait: Wien, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Bildarchiv und Grafiksammlung, Porträtsammlung, Inventar-Nr. PORT_00014647_01.)\n\nSchulze, Ernst Konrad Friedrich (1789–1817): Poet, writer. From 1806 studied first theology in Göttingen, preparing to be a country preacher, then, encouraged by Friedrich Bouterwek, classical philology, literary history, and aesthetics, earning his doctorate in 1812 and later becoming a lecturer. Schulze had a relationship with both Cäcilie and Adelheid Tychsen, daughters of Professor Thomas Christian Tychsen in Göttingen. He was deeply affected by the death in 1812 of Cäcilie, and celebrated her in several poems (included in Gedichte [Göttingen 1813]). Of two women named “Adelheid” in his life, one is an unrequited attachment he made in Plessburg in the Harz Mountains in 1809 (where he remained till July 1810), the other Cäcilie Tychsen’s younger sister, for the latter of whom he developed an unrequited love (and who apparently caused him even more heartache than Cäcilie; moreover, in 1811 he apparently also had an unfortunate relationship with a married woman of the nobility in Göttingen). After several years of despondency, new circumstances and a new love revived his poetic spirit, and he published his celebration of Adelheid, Die bezauberte Rose: Ein Romantisches Gedicht in drei Gesängen (in vol. 4 of Ernst Schulze’s sämmtliche poetische Schriften, 4 vols. [Leipzig 1818–20]), a piece that had won a competition conducted by Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus in Leipzig for the best romantic verse narrative. By the time the prize was announced, however, Schulze himself lay dying, and after his death on 29 June 1817 the publisher ended up having to compose a eulogy for the young poet rather than genuinely introducing him as a new talent. Publications include also Cäcilie. Eine Geisterstimme (Göttingen 1813), and the verse epic Cäcilie. Ein romantisches Gedicht in zwanzig Gesängen (Leipzig 1818), dedicated to his deceased beloved.\n\nSchuppach, Michel (1707–81): Swiss doctor known for being able to diagnose and treat patients’ ills by examining their urine, their smell, and their personal appearance; known as the “physician of the mountain” because of the location of his house above the village of Langenau. (Potrait: Gottfried Locher [artist]; Christian von Mechel [engraver]; Yale University; Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library, Historical Library, Engravings Collection.)\n\nSchütz, Anna Henriette, née Danovius (ca. 1751 [1758?]–1823): From 1778 wife of Christian Gottfried Schütz, daughter of Ernst Jakob Danovius, the latter from 1768 professor of theology in Jena who committed suicide in 1782 by drowning himself in the Saale River despite having polemicized against Goethe’s Leiden des jungen Werthers as an apology of suicide.\n\nSchütz, Christian Gottfried (1747–1832): Philologist, journalist, founder of the Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung. (Caroline sometimes spells his name Schüz.) From 1765 studied theology, history, philosophy, and ancient languages in Halle, earning his masters in 1768 but declining an appointment in Halle for financial reasons. After an interim period teaching mathematics at the Ritterakademie in Brandenburg (a private school for the nobility in preparation for state service), he received a tutorial position in the theological department in Halle under Johann Salomo Semler, though he also lectured and became an associate professor in 1773, becoming involved in pedagogical training for the seminary students as well. From 1777 full professor, from 1779 professor of poesy and rhetoric in Jena, where he had little success as a teacher. Only after he founded the Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung in 1785 with Friedrich Justin Bertuch and Christoph Martin Wieland (Gottlieb Hufeland joined as editor in 1788) did his standing (and finances) improve. He remained the senior editor until well into old age, the breadth (if not depth) of his knowledge proving ideally suited for such activity. As a philologist, his editions of authors such as Xenophon and Aeschylus, while grammatically solid, were later criticized as lacking critical acumen. While his activity found little resonance among students, his house did become the center of intellectual socializing in Jena, including among its guests Goethe, Schiller, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Fichte, Heinrich Eberhard Gottlob Paulus, Karl Leonhard Reinhold, and even Duke Karl August of Weimar himself; from 1797 Heinrich Karl Abraham Eichstädt joined the periodical staff. The arrival of Wilhelm Schlegel changed this situation; the younger generation was now asking for a different literary climate and Wilhelm’s own behavior was characterized by an element of haughtiness. Personal conflicts with Wilhelm began to make Jena less attractive to Schütz (concerning the establishment of the Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung, Schütz’s editorship, and the initial tension with Wilhelm Schlegel, see esp. the supplementary appendix Garlieb Merkel on the Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung), who in 1803 was glad to accept an appointment in Halle and to take the Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung along with him when he moved there in 1804 (the Jenaische Literaturzeitung emerged shortly thereafter as a rival journal). — Schütz published a well-received edition of Cicero’s rhetorical writings in 1804–8. After someone shot at the advancing French from his house in October 1806, the house was almost totally destroyed and Schütz himself arrested. After the university was closed, he had to sell a large portion of his library to survive financially. Became increasingly eccentric as a professor in his old age and was eventually relieved even of the few duties left to him. The Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung was sold to the publisher Schwetschke in 1824.\n\nSchütz, Friedrich Karl Julius (31 May 1779–1844): Professor of philosophy in Halle, journalist, son of Christian Gottfried Schütz and one of the husbands of Johanna Henriette Rosine Meyer, née Schüler. After private instruction from his father, the precocious boy attended the Gymnasium in Gotha, studying under Christian Friedrich Wilhelm Jacobs. Studied history and aesthetics in Jena, then in Erlangen and Göttingen, completing his inaugural dissertation and lecture in Jena in 1800 and also marrying that year. Worked with his father on the Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung, then followed his father to Halle in 1804, accepting a position as associate professor of philosophy and continuing his journalistic activity. After the death of his wife in 1806, he moved to Berlin, where he met Henriette Meyer, née Schüler, marrying her in 1811(10?). He accompanied her on a European tour and even performed onstage himself at her behest before separating from her in Halle amid considerable marital problems. He lectured a bit longer in Halle before moving to Hamburg, while she continued to care for his father in Halle; they finally secured a legal divorce in 1827. Schütz remarried yet again and lectured again in Halle, albeit without success and clouded by accusations of moral failings.\n\nSchütz, Gottlob Friedrich († March 1834): Physician in Maulbronn. A native of Württemberg, attained his medical degree in Tübingen in 1799 with the dissertation “Diss. sistens experimenta circa calorem foetus et sanguinem ipsius institute,” then became district physician (Oberamtsarzt) in Maulbronn, from 1806 also physician for the seminarium or boarding school there. Published several essays on the legal aspects of medicine in the Zeitschrift für Staatsarzneikunde. Also several books on the duties of coroners, on autopsies, and on peculiar medical cases, including Katechismus für die Leichenschauer, oder Belehrung über die Pflichten derselben und Anweisung wie sie sich in allen Fällen zu verhalten haben (“catechism for coroners, or instructions concerning their duties and how they are to conduct themselves in all cases”) (Stuttgart 1834); Normalinstruction für Leichenschauer (“basic instructions for coroners”) (Stuttgart 1834). Was the physician who first attended Caroline when she fell ill in early September 1809.\n\n[Hendel-]Schütz, Johanne Henriette Rosine (1772–1849): Actress. Born into a theatrical family, debuted at two years old in Breslau, received musical training from, among others, Georg Anton Benda, and dance instruction. Engaged in the Berlin ballet at nine years old in children’s roles, then at a court theater in Schwedt/Oder. Married the singer Johann Friedrich Eunick in 1788, performing thereafter in Bonn, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt. Inspired by Emma Hamilton, she also began developing a solo program. From 1796 till 1806 a member of the National Theater in Berlin under August Iffland, achieving essentially star status. Divorced in 1797, after which she married the physician Meyer (who forbade her from playing what he considered the compromising role of Creusa in Wilhelm Schlegel’s play a second time), divorcing him in 1804/05 and marrying the military physician Hendel in 1805, who died shortly thereafter. Continued her pantomime performances in Halle and elsewhere with considerable success. Married Friedrich Karl Julius Schütz in 1811 (son of Christian Gottfried Schütz, editor of the Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung in both Jena and Halle with whom Wilhelm Schlegel and Schelling had had such vehement literary quarrels). Retired publicly from the stage in 1820, giving only sporadic private performances thereafter. Divorced Schütz in 1824 and lived with one of her stepsons in Köslin.\n\nSchütz, Christian Wilhelm von (1776–1847): Writer. Native of Berlin; casual acquaintance of Ludwig Tieck in early school years. Wilhelm Schlegel was initially attracted to his formal poetic talent, and he and Ludwig Tieck published a Spanish-English influenced romanze by Schütz in their Musen-Almanach für das Jahr 1802 (Schütz’s pseudonym/ciper there was “SZ”), later also helping introduce his play Lacrimas in 1803 (an imitation of Friedrich Schlegel’s Alarcos). Schütz was, however, unable to escape the overwhelming influence of Schiller, thereafter remaining nominally close to the Romantics while yet largely imitating the forms of antiquity and following Schiller’s lead even in choice of material. Eventually converted to Catholicism. Wilhelm Schlegel harshly criticized his poetic failures in 1809 in a letter to Tieck and essentially dismissed him thereafter as a writer.\n\nSchwadke, Karl Wilhelm (born 1768): A native of Prenzlow, began acting in Stralsund in 1786, acting at the time under the name Engel. Debuted in Berlin in 1795. Marri"
