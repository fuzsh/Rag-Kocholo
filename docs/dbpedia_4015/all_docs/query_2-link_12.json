You will find more than a few celebrities in that group, too. Actor Leonardo DiCaprio, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and ketchup magnate Henry Heinz are all of German descent. And there’s many more where they came from.\n\nWhether they immigrated to America themselves or had relatives arrive in America before them, these prominent German-Americans have influenced American culture through their publications, films and other works. They’ve made their mark in many fields, including science and technology, fashion, music, philosophy, athletics and politics. They’ve also influenced areas of everyday life, such as food and drink: does the name Anheuser-Busch sound familiar?\n\nHamburgers and hotdogs taste quintessentially American, but you can trace their origins back to Germany, too."
