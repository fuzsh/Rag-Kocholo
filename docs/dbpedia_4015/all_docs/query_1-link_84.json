        "meta_description": "Abstract. Production and use of many synthetic halogenated trace gases are regulated internationally due to their contribution to stratospheric ozone depletion or climate change. In many applications they have been replaced by shorter-lived compounds, which have become measurable in the atmosphere as emissions increased. Non-target monitoring of trace gases rather than targeted measurements of well-known substances is needed to keep up with such changes in the atmospheric composition. We regularly deploy gas chromatography (GC) coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) for analysis of flask air samples and in situ measurements at the Taunus Observatory, a site in central Germany. TOF-MS acquires data over a continuous mass range that enables a retrospective analysis of the dataset, which can be considered a type of digital air archive. This archive can be used if new substances come into use and their mass spectrometric fingerprint is identified. However, quantifying new replacement halocarbons can be challenging, as mole fractions are generally low, requiring high measurement precision and low detection limits. In addition, calibration can be demanding, as calibration gases may not contain sufficiently high amounts of newly measured substances or the amounts in the calibration gas may have not been quantified. This paper presents an indirect data evaluation approach for TOF-MS data, where the calibration is linked to another compound which could be quantified in the calibration gas. We also present an approach to evaluate the quality of the indirect calibration method, select periods of stable instrument performance and determine well suited reference compounds. The method is applied to three short-lived synthetic halocarbons: HFO-1234yf, HFO-1234ze(E), and HCFO-1233zd(E). They represent replacements for longer-lived hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and exhibit increasing mole fractions in the atmosphere. The indirectly calibrated results are compared to directly calibrated measurements using data from TOF-MS canister sample analysis and TOF-MS in situ measurements, which are available for some periods of our dataset. The application of the indirect calibration method on several test cases can result in uncertainties of around 6â% to 11â%. For hydro(chloro-)fluoroolefines (denoted H(C)FOs), uncertainties up to 23â% are achieved. The indirectly calculated mole fractions of the investigated H(C)FOs at Taunus Observatory range between measured mole fractions at urban DÃ¼bendorf and Jungfraujoch stations in Switzerland.",

We show that, especially during winter, the levels of short-lived bromine gases at the extratropical tropopause are higher than at the tropical tropopause. We discuss the impact of the distributions on stratospheric bromine levels and compare our observations to two models with four different emission scenarios.\n\nEstablishing long-term measurements of halocarbons at Taunus Observatory\n\nTanja J.

Halogenated gases contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion and to radiative forcing. Time-of-flight mass spectrometry allows one to assess a large number of compounds; the measurements are expected to provide better constraints for European emission estimates. CFC-11 and CFC-12 show small unexpected differences regarding outlier occurrence and seasonality, indicating ongoing emissions of CFC-11.\n\nAge of air from ACE-FTS measurements of sulfur hexafluoride\n\nLaura N.

This is the longest continuous, global, and vertically resolved age of air time series available to date. In this paper, we show that this dataset agrees well with age of air datasets based on measurements from other instruments. We also present trends in the midlatitude lower stratosphere that indicate changes in the global circulation that are predicted by climate models.\n\nDirect high-precision radon quantification for interpreting high frequency greenhouse gas measurements\n\nDafina Kikaj, Edward Chung, Alan D.

GHGSat’s emission estimates broadly agree with the surface-based mobile survey and steps were taken to fix the leak, highlighting the importance of satellite data in identifying emissions and helping to reduce our human impact on climate change.\n\nThe interhemispheric gradient of SF6 in the upper troposphere\n\nTanja J. Schuck, Johannes Degen, Eric Hintsa, Peter Hoor, Markus Jesswein, Timo Keber, Daniel Kunkel, Fred Moore, Florian Obersteiner, Matt Rigby, Thomas WagenhÃ¤user, Luke M. Western, Andreas Zahn, and Andreas Engel\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Its emissions are stronger in the Northern Hemisphere; therefore, mixing ratios in the Southern Hemisphere lag behind. Comparing the observations to a box model, the model predicts air in the Southern Hemisphere to be older. For a better agreement, the emissions used as model input need to be increased (and their spatial pattern changed), and we need to modify north–south transport.\n\nImpact of transport model resolution and a priori assumptions on inverse modeling of Swiss F-gas emissions\n\nIoannis Katharopoulos, Dominique Rust, Martin K. Vollmer, Dominik Brunner, Stefan Reimann, Simon J. O'Doherty, Dickon Young, Kieran M. Stanley, Tanja Schuck, Jgor Arduini, Lukas Emmenegger, and Stephan Henne\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Countries report their emissions to the UN in a bottom-up manner. By combining atmospheric observations and transport models someone can independently validate emission estimates in a top-down fashion. We report Swiss emissions of synthetic GHGs based on kilometer-scale transport and inverse modeling, highlighting the role of appropriate resolution in complex terrain.\n\nA rise in HFC-23 emissions from eastern Asia since 2015\n\nHyeri Park, Jooil Kim, Haklim Choi, Sohyeon Geum, Yeaseul Kim, Rona L.

The observation-derived emissions were much larger than the bottom-up estimates expected to approach zero after 2015 due to national abatement activities. These discrepancies could be attributed to unsuccessful factory-level HFC-23 abatement and inaccurate quantification of emission reductions.\n\nWestern European emission estimates of CFC-11, CFC-12 and CCl4 derived from atmospheric measurements from 2008 to 2021\n\nAlison L.

Legislation has controlled production and use, and global emissions have decreased sharply. The global rate of decline in CFC-11 recently slowed and was partly attributed to illegal emission in eastern China. This study concludes that emissions of CFC-11 in western Europe have not contributed to the unexplained part of the global increase in CFC-11 observed in the last decade.\n\nAn intercomparison study of four different techniques for measuring the chemical composition of nanoparticles\n\nLucÃ­a Caudillo, Mihnea Surdu, Brandon Lopez, Mingyi Wang, Markus Thoma, Steffen BrÃ¤kling, Angela Buchholz, Mario Simon, Andrea C.

The intercomparison was performed based on the observed chemical composition, calculated volatility, and analysis of the thermograms. We found that the methods generally agree on the most important compounds that are found in the nanoparticles. However, they do see different parts of the organic spectrum. We suggest potential explanations for these differences.\n\nMean age from observations in the lowermost stratosphere: an improved method and interhemispheric differences\n\nThomas WagenhÃ¤user, Markus Jesswein, Timo Keber, Tanja Schuck, and Andreas Engel\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 3887–3903, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-3887-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-3887-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA common assumption to derive mean age from trace gas observations is that all air enters the stratosphere through the tropical tropopause. Using SF6 as an age tracer, this leads to negative mean age values close to the Northern Hemispheric extra-tropical tropopause. Our improved method also considers extra-tropical input into the stratosphere. More realistic values are derived using this method. Interhemispheric differences in mean age are found when comparing data from two aircraft campaigns.\n\nMass spectrometry-based Aerosolomics: a new approach to resolve sources, composition, and partitioning of secondary organic aerosol\n\nMarkus Thoma, Franziska Bachmeier, Felix Leonard Gottwald, Mario Simon, and Alexander Lucas Vogel\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 7137–7154, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-7137-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-7137-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe introduce the aerosolomics database and apply it to particulate matter samples. Nine VOCs were oxidized under various conditions in an oxidation flow reactor, and the formed SOA was measured using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. With the database, an unambiguous top-down attribution of atmospheric oxidation products to their parent VOCs is now possible. Combining the database with hierarchical clustering enables a better understanding of sources, formation, and partitioning of SOA.\n\nGlobal seasonal distribution of CH2Br2 and CHBr3 in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere\n\nMarkus Jesswein, Rafael P.

They show similar seasonality for both hemispheres, except in the respective hemispheric autumn lower stratosphere. A comparison with the TOMCAT and CAM-Chem models shows good agreement in the annual mean but larger differences in the seasonal consideration.\n\nA renewed rise in global HCFC-141b emissions between 2017â2021\n\nLuke M.

Even though production of one of the main ozone-depleting gases, called HCFC-141b, has been declining for many years, the amount that is being released to the atmosphere has been increasing since 2017. We do not know for sure why this is. A possible explanation is that HCFC-141b that was used to make insulating foams many years ago is only now escaping to the atmosphere, or a large part of its production is not being reported.\n\nQuantifying fossil fuel methane emissions using observations of atmospheric ethane and an uncertain emission ratio\n\nAlice E.

We present a method for estimating sectoral methane emissions that uses ethane as a tracer for fossil fuel methane. By incorporating variable ethane : methane emission ratios into this model, we produce emissions estimates with improved uncertainty characterisation. This method will be particularly useful for studying methane emissions in areas with complex distributions of sources.\n\nRedistribution of total reactive nitrogen in the lowermost Arctic stratosphere during the cold winter 2015/2016\n\nHelmut Ziereis, Peter Hoor, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Andreas Zahn, Greta Stratmann, Paul Stock, Michael Lichtenstern, Jens Krause, Vera Bense, Armin Afchine, Christian Rolf, Wolfgang Woiwode, Marleen Braun, JÃ¶rn Ungermann, Andreas Marsing, Christiane Voigt, Andreas Engel, BjÃ¶rn-Martin Sinnhuber, and Hermann Oelhaf\n\nAtmos.

Phys., 22, 3631–3654, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3631-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3631-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAirborne observations were conducted in the lowermost Arctic stratosphere during the winter of 2015/2016. The observed distribution of reactive nitrogen shows clear indications of nitrification in mid-winter and denitrification in late winter. This was caused by the formation of polar stratospheric cloud particles, which were observed during several flights. The sedimentation and evaporation of these particles and the descent of air masses cause a redistribution of reactive nitrogen.\n\nGlobal emissions of perfluorocyclobutane (PFC-318, c-C4F8) resulting from the use of hydrochlorofluorocarbon-22 (HCFC-22) feedstock to produce polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and related fluorochemicals\n\nJens MÃ¼hle, Lambert J.

Salameh, Roland Schmidt, Dickon Young, Ronald G. Prinn, Ray H. J. Wang, and Ray F. Weiss\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 3371–3378, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3371-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-3371-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEmissions of the strong greenhouse gas perfluorocyclobutane (c-C4F8) into the atmosphere have been increasing sharply since the early 2000s. These c-C4F8 emissions are highly correlated with the amount of hydrochlorofluorocarbon-22 produced to synthesize polytetrafluoroethylene (known for its non-stick properties) and related chemicals. From this process, c-C4F8 by-product is vented to the atmosphere. Avoiding these unnecessary c-C4F8 emissions could reduce the climate impact of this industry.\n\nComparison of inorganic chlorine in the Antarctic and Arctic lowermost stratosphere by separate late winter aircraft measurements\n\nMarkus Jesswein, Heiko Bozem, Hans-Christoph Lachnitt, Peter Hoor, Thomas WagenhÃ¤user, Timo Keber, Tanja Schuck, and Andreas Engel\n\nAtmos.

Trend-corrected correlations from the Northern Hemisphere show excellent agreement with those from the Southern Hemisphere. After observation allocation inside and outside the vortex based on N2O measurements, results of the two campaigns reveal substantial differences in Cly within the respective vortex.\n\nCloud-scale modelling of the impact of deep convection on the fate of oceanic bromoform in the troposphere: a case study over the west coast of Borneo\n\nPaul D.

We study the chemical interactions of bromoform and its derivatives within convective clouds using a cloud-scale model and observations. Our findings are that soluble bromine gases are efficiently washed out and removed within the convective clouds and that most bromine is transported vertically to the upper troposphere in the form of bromoform.\n\nAtmospheric observations consistent with reported decline in the UK's methane emissions (2013â2020)\n\nMark F.

We find emissions that are consistent in both magnitude and trend with the UK's reported emissions, with a declining trend driven by a decrease in emissions from England. The impact of various components of the modelling set-up on these findings are explored through a number of sensitivity studies.\n\nOrganic and inorganic bromine measurements around the extratropical tropopause and lowermost stratosphere: insights into the transport pathways and total bromine\n\nMeike K. Rotermund, Vera Bense, Martyn P. Chipperfield, Andreas Engel, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Peter Hoor, Tilman HÃ¼neke, Timo Keber, Flora Kluge, Benjamin Schreiner, Tanja Schuck, BÃ¤rbel Vogel, Andreas Zahn, and Klaus Pfeilsticker\n\nAtmos.

The main source is via isentropic transport by the Asian monsoon and to a lesser extent transport across the extratropical tropopause as quantified by a Lagrange model. The transport of Brtot via Central American hurricanes is also observed. Lastly, the impact of Brtot on LS O3 is assessed.\n\nEvidence of a recent decline in UKÂ emissions of hydrofluorocarbons determined by the InTEM inverse model and atmospheric measurements\n\nAlistair J.

We compare these estimates with those submitted by the UK to the United Nations. We conclude that global concentrations of these gases are still increasing. Our estimates for the UK are 73 % of those reported and that the UK emissions are now falling, demonstrating an impact of UK government policy.\n\nThe stratospheric BrewerâDobson circulation inferred from age of air in the ERA5 reanalysis\n\nFelix Ploeger, Mohamadou Diallo, Edward Charlesworth, Paul Konopka, Bernard Legras, Johannes C. Laube, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Gebhard GÃ¼nther, Andreas Engel, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Our results show a slower stratospheric circulation and higher age for ERA5. The age of air trend in ERA5 over the 1989–2018 period is negative throughout the stratosphere, related to multi-annual variability and a potential contribution from changes in the reanalysis system.\n\nTesting the altitude attribution and vertical resolution of AirCore measurements with a new spiking method\n\nThomas WagenhÃ¤user, Andreas Engel, and Robert Sitals\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 3923–3934, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3923-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3923-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAirCore samplers are increasingly deployed to weather balloons to collect continuous atmospheric samples. We introduce a technique that can be used in situ to evaluate different data processing methods that are required to derive vertical trace gas profiles from AirCore measurements after sample recovery. Results from two test flights with a specific AirCore configuration provide evidence for systematic deviations in altitude attribution for the upper levels, which can be empirically corrected.\n\nA convolution of observational and model data to estimate age of air spectra in the northern hemispheric lower stratosphere\n\nMarius Hauck, Harald BÃ¶nisch, Peter Hoor, Timo Keber, Felix Ploeger, Tanja J. Schuck, and Andreas Engel\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 8763–8785, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-8763-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-8763-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study features an extended inversion method that includes transport across the extratropical tropopause to derive age spectra in the lowermost stratosphere from in situ trace gas measurements. The refined method is validated in a model setup and applied to data gained with the HALO research aircraft. Results are congruent with the findings of previous studies so that the method provides a promising toolset for the analysis of stratospheric dynamics based on observations in the future.\n\nSensitivity of age of air trends to the derivation method for non-linear increasing inert SF6\n\nFrauke Fritsch, Hella Garny, Andreas Engel, Harald BÃ¶nisch, and Roland Eichinger\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 8709–8725, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-8709-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-8709-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe test two methods to derive age of air as a diagnostic of the Brewer–Dobson circulation from non-linear increasing trace gases such as SF6 using a chemistry-climate model and observations. Both the model and the observations show systematic variation of the age of air trend dependent on the chosen assumptions that are required when deriving age of air from measurements. This provides insight into the differences in age of air trends of observations and models.\n\nThe increasing atmospheric burden of the greenhouse gas sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)\n\nPeter G.

From a 40-year record of measurements, collected at five global monitoring sites and archived air samples, we show that its concentration in the atmosphere has steadily increased. Using modelling techniques, we estimate that global emissions have increased by about 24 % over the past decade. We find that this increase is driven by the demand for SF6-insulated switchgear in developing countries.\n\nBayesian spatio-temporal inference of trace gas emissions using an integrated nested Laplacian approximation and Gaussian Markov random fields\n\nLuke M. Western, Zhe Sha, Matthew Rigby, Anita L. Ganesan, Alistair J. Manning, Kieran M. Stanley, Simon J. O'Doherty, Dickon Young, and Jonathan Rougier\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 2095–2107, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-2095-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-2095-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAssessments of greenhouse gas emissions using atmospheric measurements and meteorological models, or top-down methods, are important to verify national inventories or produce a stand-alone estimate where no inventory exists. We present a novel top-down method to estimate emissions. This approach uses a fast method called an integrated nested Laplacian approximation to estimate how these emissions are correlated with other emissions in different locations and at different times.\n\nBromine from short-lived source gases in the extratropical northern hemispheric upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS)\n\nTimo Keber, Harald BÃ¶nisch, Carl Hartick, Marius Hauck, Fides Lefrancois, Florian Obersteiner, Akima Ringsdorf, Nils Schohl, Tanja Schuck, Ryan Hossaini, Phoebe Graf, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, and Andreas Engel\n\nAtmos.

We show that, especially during winter, the levels of short-lived bromine gases at the extratropical tropopause are higher than at the tropical tropopause. We discuss the impact of the distributions on stratospheric bromine levels and compare our observations to two models with four different emission scenarios.\n\nStability of halocarbons in air samples stored in stainless- steel canisters\n\nTanja J. Schuck, Ann-Katrin Blank, Elisa Rittmeier, Jonathan Williams, Carl A. M. Brenninkmeijer, Andreas Engel, and Andreas Zahn\n\nAtmos. Meas.

We present results on the stability of 28 halocarbons during storage of air samples collected in stainless-steel flasks inside an automated air sampling unit which is part of the CARIBIC instrument package. Selected fluorinated compounds grew during the experiments while short-lived compounds were depleted. Individual substances were additionally influenced by high mixing ratios of ozone.\n\nChlorine partitioning in the lowermost Arctic vortex during the cold winter 2015/2016\n\nAndreas Marsing, Tina Jurkat-Witschas, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Stefan Kaufmann, Romy Heller, Andreas Engel, Peter Hoor, Jens Krause, and Christiane Voigt\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We observe a change in recovery pathways of the reservoirs HCl and ClONO2 with increasing potential temperature. A comparison with the CLaMS model relates the observations to the vortex-wide evolution and confirms unresolved discrepancies in the mid-winter HCl distribution.\n\nUK greenhouse gas measurements at two new tall towers for aiding emissions verification\n\nAnn R. Stavert, Simon O'Doherty, Kieran Stanley, Dickon Young, Alistair J. Manning, Mark F. Lunt, Christopher Rennick, and Tim Arnold\n\nAtmos. Meas.

A combination of spectroscopic and chromatographic instrumentation was used to measure CO2, CH4, CO, N2O and SF6. The advantages and disadvantages of two CRDS sample drying strategies, Nafion(R) and empirical water correction, were also examined.\n\nPerfluorocyclobutane (PFC-318, c-C4F8) in the global atmosphere\n\nJens MÃ¼hle, Cathy M.

A large fraction of recent emissions stem from China, India, and Russia, probably as a by-product from the production of fluoropolymers and fluorochemicals. Most historic emissions likely stem from developed countries. Total emissions are higher than what is being reported. Clearly, more measurements and better reporting are needed to understand emissions of this and other greenhouse gases.\n\nHow robust are stratospheric age of air trends from different reanalyses?\n\nFelix Ploeger, Bernard Legras, Edward Charlesworth, Xiaolu Yan, Mohamadou Diallo, Paul Konopka, Thomas Birner, Mengchu Tao, Andreas Engel, and Martin Riese\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We find that long-term changes from 1989 to 2015 are similar for the chosen reanalyses, mainly resembling the forced response in climate model simulations to climate change. For shorter periods circulation changes are less robust, and the representation of decadal variability appears to be a major uncertainty for modelling the circulation of the middle atmosphere.\n\nDeriving stratospheric age of air spectra using an idealized set of chemically active trace gases\n\nMarius Hauck, Frauke Fritsch, Hella Garny, and Andreas Engel\n\nAtmos. Chem.

It features an imposed seasonal cycle to include transport seasonality into the spectra. An idealized set of tracers from a model is used as proof of concept and results are in good agreement with the model reference, except for the lowermost stratosphere. Applicability is studied with focus on number of tracers and error tolerance, providing a starting point for future work.\n\nQuantifying the UK's carbon dioxide flux: an atmospheric inverse modelling approach using a regional measurement network\n\nEmily D.

We estimate emissions of CO2 from the UK biosphere using atmospheric data in a top-down approach. Our findings show that bottom-up estimates from models of biospheric fluxes overestimate the amount of CO2 uptake in summer. This suggests these models wrongly estimate or omit key processes, e.g. land disturbance due to harvest.\n\nEstimates of sub-national methane emissions from inversion modelling\n\nSarah Connors, Alistair J.

This paper explains a way to estimate emitted methane over a sub-national area by combining measurements & computer dispersion modelling in a so-called inversion technique. Compared with the current national inventory, our results show lower emissions for Cambridgeshire, possibly due to waste sector emission differences.\n\nEstablishing long-term measurements of halocarbons at Taunus Observatory\n\nTanja J. Schuck, Fides Lefrancois, Franziska Gallmann, Danrong Wang, Markus Jesswein, Jesica Hoker, Harald BÃ¶nisch, and Andreas Engel\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Halogenated gases contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion and to radiative forcing. Time-of-flight mass spectrometry allows one to assess a large number of compounds; the measurements are expected to provide better constraints for European emission estimates. CFC-11 and CFC-12 show small unexpected differences regarding outlier occurrence and seasonality, indicating ongoing emissions of CFC-11.\n\nComparison of mean age of air in five reanalyses using the BASCOE transport model\n\nSimon Chabrillat, Corinne Vigouroux, Yves Christophe, Andreas Engel, Quentin Errera, Daniele Minganti, Beatriz M. Monge-Sanz, Arjo Segers, and Emmanuel Mahieu\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The spread between the resulting datasets is as large as in climate model intercomparisons; the age trends have large disagreement and depend strongly on the considered period. We highlight the need for similar studies using diabatic transport models which also use temperature and heating rates.\n\nA measurement-based verification framework for UK greenhouse gas emissions: an overview of the Greenhouse gAs Uk and Global Emissions (GAUGE) project\n\nPaul I.

GLORIA sounded the atmosphere between 5 and 14 km with vertical resolutions of 0.4–1 km. Estimated errors are in the range of 1–2 K (temperature) and 10 %–20 % (trace gases). Comparisons to in situ instruments onboard the aircraft and to Aura/MLS are shown.\n\nMixing and ageing in the polar lower stratosphere in winter 2015â2016\n\nJens Krause, Peter Hoor, Andreas Engel, Felix PlÃ¶ger, Jens-Uwe GrooÃ, Harald BÃ¶nisch, Timo Keber, BjÃ¶rn-Martin Sinnhuber, Wolfgang Woiwode, and Hermann Oelhaf\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 6057–6073, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-6057-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-6057-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present tracer measurements of CO and N2O measured during the POLSTRACC aircraft campaign in winter 2015–2016. We found enhanced CO values relative to N2O in the polar lower stratosphere in addition to the ageing of this region during winter. By using model simulations it was possible to link this enhancement to an increased mixing of the tropical tropopause. We thus conclude that the polar lower stratosphere in late winter is strongly influenced by quasi-isentropic mixing from the tropics.\n\nGreenhouse gas measurements from a UK network of tall towers: technical description and first results\n\nKieran M.

A range of tracers is important to understand changing stratospheric dynamics. We demonstrate the suitability of PFCs and HFCs as tracers and support recent work that reduces the current stratospheric lifetime of SF6. Updates to policy-relevant parameters (e.g. stratospheric lifetime) linked to this change are provided for O3-depleting substances.\n\nA refined method for calculating equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine\n\nAndreas Engel, Harald BÃ¶nisch, Jennifer OstermÃ¶ller, Martyn P. Chipperfield, Sandip Dhomse, and Patrick JÃ¶ckel\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 601–619, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-601-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-601-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a new method to derive equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC), which is based on an improved formulation of the propagation of trends of species with chemical loss from the troposphere to the stratosphere. EESC calculated with the new method shows much better agreement with model-derived ESC. Based on this new formulation, we expect the halogen impact on midlatitude stratospheric ozone to return to 1980 values about 10 years later, then using the current formulation.\n\nMIPAS IMK/IAA carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) retrieval and first comparison with other instruments\n\nEllen Eckert, Thomas von Clarmann, Alexandra Laeng, Gabriele P.

A detailed description of all characteristics is included in the paper as well as comparisons with historical measurements and comparisons with collocated measurements of instruments covering the same time span as MIPAS Envisat. A particular focus also lies on the usage of a new CCl4 spectroscopic dataset introduced recently, which leads to more realistic CCl4 volume mixing ratios.\n\nAirCore-HR: a high-resolution column sampling to enhance the vertical description of CH4 and CO2\n\nOlivier Membrive, Cyril Crevoisier, Colm Sweeney, FranÃ§ois Danis, Albert Hertzog, Andreas Engel, Harald BÃ¶nisch, and Laurence Picon\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 10, 2163–2181, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-2163-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-2163-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new high-resolution AirCore system is presented. This system flown with stratospheric balloons allows us to sample atmospheric air during the descent. The analysis of trace gases (CO2 and CH4 in this case) in the collected air sample provides information on the vertical distribution along the atmospheric column. The continuous vertical profiles retrieved may contribute to several research topics concerning the observation of greenhouse gases and, more generally, carbon cycle studies.\n\nMean age of stratospheric air derived from AirCore observations\n\nAndreas Engel, Harald BÃ¶nisch, Markus Ullrich, Robert Sitals, Olivier Membrive, Francois Danis, and Cyril Crevoisier\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 6825–6838, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-6825-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-6825-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAirCore is new technique for sampling stratospheric air. We present new observations of CO2 and CH4 using AirCore and derive stratospheric transport time, called the mean age of air. The purpose of using AirCore is to provide a cost-effective tool for deriving mean age. Mean age may serve as a proxy to investigate changes in stratospheric circulation. We show that there is no statistically significant trend in our 40-year time series of mean age, which is now extended using AirCore.\n\nGlobal distribution of CO2 in the upper troposphere and stratosphere\n\nMohamadou Diallo, Bernard Legras, Eric Ray, Andreas Engel, and Juan A. AÃ±el\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 3861–3878, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-3861-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-3861-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe construct a new monthly zonal mean CO2 distribution from the upper troposphere to the stratosphere over the 2000–2010 period. The main features of the CO2 distribution are consistent with expected variability due to the transport of long-lived trace gases by the Brewer–Dobson circulation. The method used to construct this CO2 product is unique and should be useful for model and satellite validation in the upper troposphere and stratosphere.\n\nA new time-independent formulation of fractional release\n\nJennifer OstermÃ¶ller, Harald BÃ¶nisch, Patrick JÃ¶ckel, and Andreas Engel\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 3785–3797, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-3785-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-3785-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analysed the temporal evolution of fractional release factors (FRFs) from EMAC model simulations for several halocarbons and nitrous oxide. The current formulation of FRFs yields values that depend on the tropospheric trend of the species. This is a problematic issue for the application of FRF in the calculation of steady-state quantities (e.g. ODP). Including a loss term in the calculation, we develop a new formulation of FRF and find that the time dependence can almost be compensated.\n\nA versatile, refrigerant- and cryogen-free cryofocusingâthermodesorption unit for preconcentration of traces gases in air\n\nFlorian Obersteiner, Harald BÃ¶nisch, Timo Keber, Simon O'Doherty, and Andreas Engel\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 9, 5265–5279, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-9-5265-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-9-5265-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe analysis of trace gases in ambient air requires a preconcentration technique, in many cases to make the species of interest detectable and quantifiable. In this paper, such a preconcentration set-up is presented. Target species are trapped on adsorptive material cooled by a Stirling cooler which allows for a very low adsorption temperature but only requires electrical power. A simple and lightweight mechanical design guarantees very good suitability for remote-site field operation.\n\nImpact of the Asian monsoon on the extratropical lower stratosphere: trace gas observations during TACTS over Europe 2012\n\nStefan MÃ¼ller, Peter Hoor, Heiko Bozem, Ellen Gute, BÃ¤rbel Vogel, Andreas Zahn, Harald BÃ¶nisch, Timo Keber, Martina KrÃ¤mer, Christian Rolf, Martin Riese, Hans Schlager, and Andreas Engel\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 16, 10573–10589, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-10573-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-10573-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn situ airborne measurements performed during TACTS/ESMVal 2012 were analysed to investigate the chemical compostion of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. N2O, CO and O3 data show an increase in tropospherically affected air masses within the extratropical stratosphere from August to September 2012, which originate from the Asian monsoon region. Thus, the Asian monsoon anticyclone significantly affected the chemical composition of the extratropical stratosphere during summer 2012.\n\nMIPAS IMK/IAA CFC-11 (CCl3F) and CFC-12 (CCl2F2) measurements: accuracy, precision and long-term stability\n\nE.

For comparisons we use several data products from satellite, airplane and balloon-borne instruments as well as ground-based data. MIPAS Envisat CFC-11 has a slight high bias at the lower end of the profile. CFC-12 agrees well with other data products. The temporal stability is good up to ~ 30 km, but still leaves room for improvement.\n\nA multi-model intercomparison of halogenated very short-lived substances (TransCom-VSLS): linking oceanic emissions and tropospheric transport for a reconciled estimate of the stratospheric source gas injection of bromine\n\nR.

Tropospheric trends are in good agreement with ground-based observations. A layer of enhanced HCFC-22 in the upper tropospheric tropics and northern subtropics is identified to come from Asian sources uplifted in the Asian monsoon. Stratospheric distributions provide show seasonal, semi-annual, and QBO-related variations. Hemispheric asymmetries of trends hint towards a change in the stratospheric circulation.\n\nLong-term validation of ESA operational retrieval (versionÂ 6.0) of MIPAS Envisat vertical profiles of methane, nitrous oxide, CFC11, and CFC12 using balloon-borne observations and trajectory matching\n\nAndreas Engel, Harald BÃ¶nisch, Tim Schwarzenberger, Hans-Peter Haase, Katja Grunow, Jana Abalichin, and Stephan Sala\n\nAtmos.

The geophysical validation is performed using data from a balloon-borne cryogenic whole air sampler and trajectory matching. We show that the validation results are different for the period prior to 2005 compared to the post 2005 period. N2O, CH4, and CFC-12 show partly good agreement while CFC-11 data from this retrieval cannot be used for scientific studies.\n\nAn automated gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry instrument for the quantitative analysis of halocarbons in air\n\nF.

Tech., 17, 1217–1228, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-1217-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-1217-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric mercury monitoring is an important activity in order to model the global trajectory of this toxic element and to assess if certain areas are polluted or not in accordance to global guidelines. One of the analysers tested in this work is globally used in this regard due to its practicality compared with other devices. Because it is only calibrated by the manufacturer at very high concentrations, we wanted to see how it performs at ambient mercury concentrations.\n\nA Nitrate Ion Chemical Ionization Atmospheric Pressure interface Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (NO3− ToFCIMS): calibration and sensitivity study\n\nStÃ©phanie Alage, Vincent Michoud, Sergio Harb, BÃ©nÃ©dicte Picquet-Varrault, Manuela Cirtog, Avinash Kumar, Matti Rissanen, and Christopher Cantrell\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-2024-20,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-2024-20, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for AMT\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCalibration exercises are essential for determining the accuracy of instruments. We performed calibrations on a NO3¯ ToFCIMS instrument to determine its sensitivity and linearity for detecting various organic compounds. Our findings revealed significant variability, over several orders of magnitude, in the calibration factors obtained. The results suggest that relying on a single calibration factor from H2SO4 for the quantification of all compounds detected by this technique is not appropriate.\n\nMeasurements of atmospheric C10âC15 biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) with sorbent tubes\n\nHeidi HellÃ©n, Toni TykkÃ¤, Simon Schallhart, Evdokia Stratigou, ThÃ©rÃ¨se Salameh, and Maitane Iturrate-Garcia\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 17, 315–333, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-315-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-17-315-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEven though online measurements of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are becoming more common, the use of sorbent tubes is expected to continue because they offer greater spatial coverage and no infrastructure is required for sampling. In this study the sorbent tube sampling method was optimized and evaluated for the determination of BVOCs in gas-phase samples. Tenax TA sorbent tubes were found to be suitable for the quantitative measurements of C10–C15 BVOCs.\n\nResults of a long-term international comparison of greenhouse gas and isotope measurements at the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Observatory in Alert, Nunavut, Canada\n\nDouglas E.

Crotwell, Monica Madronich, Gabrielle PÃ©tron, Ingeborg Levin, Samuel Hammer, Sylvia Michel, Michel Ramonet, Martina Schmidt, Armin Jordan, Heiko Moossen, Michael Rothe, Ralph Keeling, and Eric J. Morgan\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 5909–5935, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5909-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5909-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNetwork compatibility is important for inferring greenhouse gas fluxes at global or regional scales. This study is the first assessment of the measurement agreement among seven individual programs within the World Meteorological Organization community. It compares co-located flask air measurements at the Alert Observatory in Canada over a 17-year period. The results provide stronger confidence in the uncertainty estimation while using those datasets in various data interpretation applications.\n\nColorimetric derivatization of ambient ammonia (NH3) for detection by long-path absorption photometry\n\nShasha Tian, Kexin Zu, Huabin Dong, Limin Zeng, Keding Lu, and Qi Chen\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 5525–5535, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5525-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5525-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed an online NH3 monitoring system based on a selective colorimetric reaction and a long-path absorption photometer (SAC-LOPAP), which can run statically for a long time and be applied to the continuous online measurement of low concentrations of ambient air by optimizing the reaction conditions, adding a constant-temperature module and liquid flow controller. It is well suited for the investigation of the NH3 budget for urban to rural conditions in China.\n\nComparison of temperature-dependent calibration methods of an instrument to measure OH and HO2 radicals using laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy\n\nFrank A. F. Winiberg, William J. Warman, Charlotte A. Brumby, Graham Boustead, Iustinian G. Bejan, Thomas H. Speak, Dwayne E. Heard, Daniel Stone, and Paul W. Seakins\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 4375–4390, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-4375-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-4375-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOH and HO2 are key reactive intermediates in the Earth's atmosphere. Accurate measurements in either the field or simulation chambers provide a good test for chemical mechanisms. Fluorescence techniques have the appropriate sensitivity for detection but require calibration. This paper compares different methods of calibration and specifically how calibration factors vary across a temperature range relevant to atmospheric and chamber determinations.\n\nControlled-release testing of the static chamber methodology for direct measurements of methane emissions\n\nJames P. Williams, Khalil El Hachem, and Mary Kang\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 3421–3435, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-3421-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-3421-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMethane is powerful greenhouse gas; thus, to reduce methane emissions, it is important that the methods used to measure methane are tested and validated. The static chamber method is an enclosure-based technique that directly measures methane emissions; however, it has not been thoroughly tested for the new variety of methane sources that it is currently being used for. We find that the static chamber method can accurately measure methane emissions under a wide range of methane emission rates.\n\nDevelopment of an International System of Units (SI)-traceable transmission curve reference material to improve the quantitation and comparability of proton-transfer-reaction mass-spectrometry measurements\n\nDavid R. Worton, Sergi Moreno, Kieran O'Daly, and Rupert Holzinger\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 1061–1072, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-1061-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-1061-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nProton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry is widely used in the environmental, health, and food and beverage sectors. As a result, there is a need for accurate and comparable measurements. In this work we have developed a 20-component gravimetrically prepared traceable primary reference material (gas standard in a high-pressure cylinder) to enable quantitative and comparable measurements. The accuracy of all components was better than 3 %–10 % with stabilities of better than 1–2 years.\n\nReactive uptake coefficients for multiphase reactions determined by a dynamic chamber system\n\nGuo Li, Hang Su, Meng Li, Uwe Kuhn, Guangjie Zheng, Lei Han, Fengxia Bao, Ulrich PÃ¶schl, and Yafang Cheng\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 6433–6446, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-6433-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-6433-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA large fraction of previous work using dynamic flow chambers was to quantify gas exchange in terms of flux or deposition/emission rate. Here, we extended the usage of this technique to examine uptake kinetics on sample surfaces. The good performance of the chamber system was validated. This technique can be further used for liquid samples and real atmospheric aerosol samples without complicated coating procedures, which complements the existing techniques in atmospheric kinetic studies.\n\nInfluence of CO2 adsorption on cylinders and fractionation of CO2 and air during the preparation of a standard mixture\n\nNobuyuki Aoki, Shigeyuki Ishidoya, Shohei Murayama, and Nobuhiro Matsumoto\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 5969–5983, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-5969-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-5969-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe CO2 concentration in a cylinder is affected by carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorption to a cylinderâs internal surface and fractionation of CO2 and air in the preparation of standard mixtures. We demonstrate that the effects make the CO2 molar fractions deviate in standard mixtures prepared by diluting pure CO2 with air three times. This means that CO2 standard gases are difficult to gravimetrically prepare through multistep dilution.\n\nDetection of nitrous acid in the atmospheric simulation chamber SAPHIR using open-path incoherent broadband cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy and extractive long-path absorption photometry\n\nSophie Dixneuf, Albert A. Ruth, Rolf HÃ¤seler, Theo Brauers, Franz Rohrer, and Hans-Peter Dorn\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 945–964, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-945-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-945-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric chambers, like SAPHIR in JÃ¼lich (Germany), are used to experimentally simulate specific atmospheric scenarios to improve our understanding of the complex chemical reactions occurring in our atmospheres. These facilities hence require cutting-edge gas-sensing capabilities to detect trace gases at the lowest level and in a short time. One important trace gas is HONO, for which we custom-built an optical sensing setup, capable of detecting one HONO molecule in ~40 billion in 1 min.\n\nBehavior of KCl sorbent traps and KCl trapping solutions used for atmospheric mercury speciation: stability and specificity\n\nJan GaÄnik, Igor Å½ivkoviÄ, Sergio Ribeiro Guevara, Radojko JaÄimoviÄ, JoÅ¾e Kotnik, Gianmarco De Feo, Matthew A. Dexter, Warren T. Corns, and Milena Horvat\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 6619–6631, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-6619-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-6619-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric mercury and knowledge of its transformations and processes are of great importance for lowering its anthropogenic emissions. To ensure that, it is crucial to have a tested and validated measurement procedure. Since this is not always the case, we performed experiments that provided insight into commonly used atmospheric mercury sampling methods. The results showed that some sampling methods are unsuitable, and some are useful if we consider the results obtained from this work.\n\nIntercomparison of O2 â N2 ratio scales among AIST, NIES, TU, and SIO based on a round-robin exercise using gravimetric standard mixtures\n\nNobuyuki Aoki, Shigeyuki Ishidoya, Yasunori Tohjima, Shinji Morimoto, Ralph F. Keeling, Adam Cox, Shuichiro Takebayashi, and Shohei Murayama\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 6181–6193, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-6181-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-6181-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nObserving the minimal long-term change in atmospheric O2 molar fraction combined with CO2 observation enables us to estimate terrestrial biospheric and oceanic CO2 uptakes separately. In this study, we firstly identified the span offset between the laboratory O2 scales using our developed high-precision standard mixtures, suggesting that the result may allow us to estimate terrestrial biospheric and oceanic CO2 uptakes precisely.\n\nCharacterisation of gas reference materials for underpinning atmospheric measurements of stable isotopes of nitrous oxide\n\nRuth E. Hill-Pearce, Aimee Hillier, Eric Mussell Webber, Kanokrat Charoenpornpukdee, Simon O'Doherty, Joachim Mohn, Christoph Zellweger, David R. Worton, and Paul J. Brewer\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 5447–5458, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5447-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-5447-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThere is currently a need for gas reference materials with well-characterised delta values for monitoring N2O amount fractions. We present work towards the preparation of gas reference materials for calibration of in-field monitoring equipment, which target the WMO-GAW data quality objectives for comparability of amount fraction and demonstrate the stability of Î´15Nα, Î´15Nβ and Î´18O values with pressure and effects of cylinder passivation.\n\nRevision of the World Meteorological Organization Global Atmosphere Watch (WMO/GAW) CO2 calibration scale\n\nBradley D. Hall, Andrew M. Crotwell, Duane R. Kitzis, Thomas Mefford, Benjamin R. Miller, Michael F. Schibig, and Pieter P. Tans\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 3015–3032, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3015-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3015-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe have recently revised the carbon dioxide calibration scale used by numerous laboratories that measure atmospheric CO2. The revision follows from an improved understanding of the manometric method used to determine the absolute amount of CO2 in an atmospheric air sample. The new scale is 0.18 Î¼mol mol−1 (ppm) greater than the previous scale at 400 ppm CO2. While this difference is small in relative terms (0.045 %), it is significant in terms of atmospheric monitoring.\n\nComparability of calibration strategies for measuring mercury concentrations in gas emission sources and the atmosphere\n\nIris de Krom, Wijnand Bavius, Ruben Ziel, Elizabeth A. McGhee, Richard J. C. Brown, Igor Å½ivkoviÄ, Jan GaÄnik, Vesna Fajon, JoÅ¾e Kotnik, Milena Horvat, and Hugo Ent\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 2317–2326, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-2317-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-2317-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo demonstrate the robustness and comparability of the novel primary mercury gas standard, the results of comparisons are presented with current calibration methods maintained, using the bell jar in combination with the Dumarey equation or NIST liquid standard reference material. The results show that the primary standard and the NIST reference material are comparable, whereas a difference of −8 % exists between results traceable to the primary standard and the Dumarey equation.\n\nCharacterizing water vapour concentration dependence of commercial cavity ring-down spectrometers for continuous on-site atmospheric water vapour isotope measurements in the tropics\n\nShujiro Komiya, Fumiyoshi Kondo, Heiko Moossen, Thomas Seifert, Uwe Schultz, Heike Geilmann, David Walter, and Jost V. Lavric\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 14, 1439–1455, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-1439-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-1439-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe Amazon basin influences the atmospheric and hydrological cycles on local to global scales. To better understand how, we plan to perform continuous on-site measurements of the stable isotope composition of atmospheric water vapour. For making accurate on-site observations possible, we have investigated the performance of two commercial analysers and determined the best calibration strategy. Well calibrated, both analysers will allow us to record natural signals in the Amazon rainforest.\n\nImplementation of an incoherent broadband cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy technique in an atmospheric simulation chamber for in situ NO3 monitoring: characterization and validation for kinetic studies\n\nAxel Fouqueau, Manuela Cirtog, Mathieu Cazaunau, Edouard Pangui, Pascal Zapf, Guillaume Siour, Xavier Landsheere, Guillaume MÃ©jean, Daniele Romanini, and BÃ©nÃ©dicte Picquet-Varrault\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 6311–6323, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-6311-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-6311-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn incoherent broadband cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (IBBCEAS) technique has been developed for the in situ monitoring of NO3 radicals in the CSA simulation chamber at LISA. The optical cavity allows a high sensitivity for NO3 detection up to 6 ppt for an integration time of 10 s. The technique is now fully operational and can be used to determine rate constants for fast reactions involving complex volatile organic compounds (with rate constants up to 10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1).\n\nA portable, robust, stable, and tunable calibration source for gas-phase nitrous acid (HONO)\n\nMelodie Lao, Leigh R. Crilley, Leyla Salehpoor, Teles C. Furlani, Ilann Bourgeois, J. Andrew Neuman, Andrew W. Rollins, Patrick R. Veres, Rebecca A. Washenfelder, Caroline C. Womack, Cora J. Young, and Trevor C. VandenBoer\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 5873–5890, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-5873-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-5873-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNitrous acid (HONO) is a key intermediate in the generation of oxidants and fate of nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere. High-purity calibration sources that produce stable atmospherically relevant levels under field conditions have not been made to date, reducing measurement accuracy. In this study a simple salt-coated tube humidified with water vapor is demonstrated to produce pure stable low levels of HONO, with modifications allowing the generation of higher amounts.\n\nOptimisation of a thermal desorptionâgas chromatographyâmass spectrometry method for the analysis of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes\n\nAku Helin, Hannele Hakola, and Heidi HellÃ©n\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 3543–3560, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-3543-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-3543-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA thermal desorption–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry method following sorbent tube sampling was developed for the determination of terpenes in gas-phase samples. The main focus was on the analysis of diterpenes, which have been limited in study in gas-phase samples. The analytical figures of merit were fit for purpose (e.g. quantitation limits <10 pptv and reproducibility <10 % for terpenes). Diterpenes could be detected and identified in emissions from spruce and pine samples.\n\nSIFT-MS optimization for atmospheric trace gas measurements at varying humidity\n\nAnn-Sophie Lehnert, Thomas Behrendt, Alexander Ruecker, Georg Pohnert, and Susan E. Trumbore\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 13, 3507–3520, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-3507-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-3507-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVolatile organic compounds (VOCs) like scents can appear and disappear quickly. For example, when a bug starts on a tree, the tree releases VOCs that warn the trees around him. Thus, one needs instruments measuring their concentration in real time and identify which VOC is measured. In our study, we compared two instruments doing that, PTR-MS and SIFT-MS. Both work similarly, but we found that the PTR-MS can measure lower concentrations, but the SIFT-MS can identify VOCs better.\n\nN2O isotopocule measurements using laser spectroscopy: analyzer characterization and intercomparison\n\nStephen J. Harris, Jesper Liisberg, Longlong Xia, Jing Wei, Kerstin Zeyer, Longfei Yu, Matti Barthel, Benjamin Wolf, Bryce F. J. Kelly, Dioni I. CendÃ³n, Thomas Blunier, Johan Six, and Joachim Mohn\n\nAtmos. Meas.

However, to do so, they must be able to produce trustworthy data. Here, we test the performance of widely used laser spectrometers for ambient air applications and identify instrument-specific dependencies on gas matrix and trace gas concentrations. We then provide a calibration workflow to facilitate the operation of these instruments in order to generate reproducible and accurate data.\n\nAn intercomparison of CH3O2 measurements by fluorescence assay by gas expansion and cavity ring-down spectroscopy within HIRAC (Highly Instrumented Reactor for Atmospheric Chemistry)\n\nLavinia Onel, Alexander Brennan, Michele Gianella, James Hooper, Nicole Ng, Gus Hancock, Lisa Whalley, Paul W. Seakins, Grant A. D. Ritchie, and Dwayne E. Heard\n\nAtmos. Meas.

Miller, Eric Scheuer, Jack Dibb, Vanessa Selimovic, Robert Yokelson, Kyle J. Zarzana, Steven S. Brown, Abigail R. Koss, Carsten Warneke, and Meredith Hastings\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 6303–6317, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-6303-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-6303-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIsotopic analysis offers a potential tool to distinguish between sources and interpret transformation pathways of atmospheric species. We applied recently developed techniques in our lab to characterize the isotopic composition of reactive nitrogen species (NOx, HONO, HNO3, pNO3-) in fresh biomass burning emissions. Intercomparison with other techniques confirms the suitability of our methods, allowing for future applications of our techniques in a variety of environments.\n\nA new laser-based and ultra-portable gas sensor for indoor and outdoor formaldehyde (HCHO) monitoring\n\nJoshua D. Shutter, Norton T. Allen, Thomas F. Hanisco, Glenn M. Wolfe, Jason M. St. Clair, and Frank N. Keutsch\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 6079–6089, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-6079-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-6079-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new mid-infrared and ultra-portable formaldehyde (HCHO) sensor from Aeris Technologies is characterized and evaluated against well-established laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) instrumentation. The Aeris sensor displays linear behavior (R squared > 0.94) and shows good agreement with LIF instruments. While the compact sensor is not currently a replacement for the most sensitive research-grade instrumentation available, its sub-ppbv precision is sufficient for indoor and outdoor HCHO monitoring.\n\nNegligible influence of livestock contaminants and sampling system on ammonia measurements with cavity ring-down spectroscopy\n\nJesper NÃ¸rlem Kamp, Albarune Chowdhury, Anders Peter S. Adamsen, and Anders Feilberg\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 2837–2850, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-2837-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-2837-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe tested the performance of a cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) instrument from Picarro for measuring ammonia. Interference tests with 10 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were conducted to find potential interference of these VOCs. Calibrations show excellent linearity over a large dynamic range of NH3 concentrations. There is negligible interference from humidity and few of the tested VOCs. Overall, the CRDS system performs well with only negligible influence from other compounds.\n\nPreparation of primary standard mixtures for atmospheric oxygen measurements with less than 1 Âµmol molâ1 uncertainty for oxygen molar fractions\n\nNobuyuki Aoki, Shigeyuki Ishidoya, Nobuhiro Matsumoto, Takuro Watanabe, Takuya Shimosaka, and Shohei Murayama\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 2631–2646, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-2631-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-2631-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nObservation of atmospheric O2 requires highly precise standard gas mixtures with uncertainty of less than 1 ppm for the O2 mole fraction or 5 per meg for O2 / N2. The uncertainty had not been achieved due unknown uncertainty factors in mass determination of the filled source gases. We first developed the primary standard mixtures with 1 ppm for the O2 mole fraction or 5 per meg by identifying and reducing the unknown uncertainty factors.\n\nThe interference of tetrachloromethane in the measurement of benzene in the air by a gas chromatographyâphotoionisation detector (GC-PID)\n\nCristina Romero-Trigueros, MarÃ­a Esther GonzÃ¡lez, Marta Doval MiÃ±arro, and Enrique GonzÃ¡lez FerradÃ¡s\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 1685–1695, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-1685-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-1685-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDetermining benzene in ambient air is mandatory in the European Union. The reference measuring technique is by gas chromatography (GC), and a photometric ionisation detector is recommended. This study shows that the simultaneous presence of benzene and tetrachloromethane causes a significant decrease in GC–photoionisation detector (GC-PID) readings. Given the importance of this behaviour, a possible mechanism was proposed. This study highlights the uncertainty of measuring benzene with a GC-PID.\n\nEvaluation of cation exchange membrane performance under exposure to high Hg0 and HgBr2 concentrations\n\nMatthieu B. Miller, Sarrah M. Dunham-Cheatham, Mae Sexauer Gustin, and Grant C. Edwards\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 1207–1217, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-1207-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-1207-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study was undertaken to demonstrate that a cation exchange membrane (CEM) material used for sampling reactive mercury (RM) does not possess an inherent tendency to collect gaseous elemental mercury (GEM). Using a custom-built mercury vapor permeation system, we found that the CEM material has a very small GEM uptake of approximately 0.004 %, too small to create a significant artifact. We also found that a representative RM compound was collected by the CEM material with high efficiency.\n\nGravimetrically prepared carbon dioxide standards in support of atmospheric research\n\nBradley D. Hall, Andrew M. Crotwell, Benjamin R. Miller, Michael Schibig, and James W. Elkins\n\nAtmos. Meas.

We consider both adsorption to stainless steel surfaces used in the transfer of highly pure CO2 and adsorption of CO2 to cylinder walls. This work compliments ongoing efforts to support atmospheric monitoring of CO2.\n\nThe importance of cylinder passivation for preparation and long-term stability of multicomponent monoterpene primary reference materials\n\nNicholas D. C. Allen, David R. Worton, Paul J. Brewer, Celine Pascale, and Bernhard Niederhauser\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 6429–6438, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-6429-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-6429-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper investigates the stability of trace level static terpene primary reference materials (PRMs) and how the choice of passivation affects this process. For the first time, sampling canisters that can be used in the field are tested and demonstrated to be suitable for terpene mixtures. The PRMs were compared against a novel dynamic generator system based on dilution of pure limonene vapour emitted from a permeation tube. The effect of cylinder pressure and decanting are also investigated.\n\nDynamicâgravimetric preparation of metrologically traceable primary calibration standards for halogenated greenhouse gases\n\nMyriam Guillevic, Martin K. Vollmer, Simon A. Wyss, Daiana Leuenberger, Andreas Ackermann, CÃ©line Pascale, Bernhard Niederhauser, and Stefan Reimann\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 3351–3372, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-3351-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-3351-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present new primary calibration scales for five halogenated greenhouse gases. The preparation method, newly applied to halocarbons, is dynamic and gravimetric and allows the generation of reference gas mixtures at near-ambient levels (pmol mol−1). Each prepared molar fraction is traceable to the realisation of SI units (International System of Units) and is assigned an uncertainty estimate following international guidelines.\n\nThe water vapour self-continuum absorption in the infrared atmospheric windows: new laser measurements near 3.3 and 2.0â¯Âµm\n\nLoic Lechevallier, Semen Vasilchenko, Roberto Grilli, Didier Mondelain, Daniele Romanini, and Alain Campargue\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 2159–2171, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-2159-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-2159-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe amplitude, the temperature dependence, and the physical origin of the water vapour absorption continuum are a long standing issue in molecular spectroscopy with a direct impact in atmospheric and planetary sciences. Using highly sensitive laser spectrometers, the water self continuum has been determined with unprecedented sensitivity in infrared atmospheric transparency windows.\n\nInterlaboratory comparison of Î´13C and Î´D measurements of atmospheric CH4 for combined use of data sets from different laboratories\n\nTaku Umezawa, Carl A.

Nisbet, Andrew L. Rice, Peter Bergamaschi, Cordelia Veidt, and Ingeborg Levin\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 1207–1231, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-1207-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-1207-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIsotope measurements are useful for separating different methane sources. However, the lack of widely accepted standards and calibration methods for stable carbon and hydrogen isotopic ratios of methane in air has caused significant measurement offsets among laboratories. We conducted worldwide interlaboratory comparisons, surveyed the literature and assessed them systematically. This study may be of help in future attempts to harmonize data sets of isotopic composition of atmospheric methane.\n\nAbsolute, pressure-dependent validation of a calibration-free, airborne laser hygrometer transfer standard (SEALDH-II) from 5 to 1200 ppmv using a metrological humidity generator\n\nBernhard Buchholz and Volker Ebert\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 459–471, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-459-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-459-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper describes the absolute validation of the novel, calibration-free SEALDH-II hygrometer at a traceable humidity generator. During 23 days of permanent operation, 15 H2O mole fractions levels (5–1200 ppmv) at 6 gas pressures (65–950 hPa) were validated. With this validation, SEALDH-II is the first metrologically validated humidity transfer standard which links several scientific airborne and laboratory measurement campaigns to the international metrological water vapor scale.\n\nAn intercomparison of HO2 measurements by fluorescence assay by gas expansion and cavity ring-down spectroscopy within HIRAC (Highly Instrumented Reactor for Atmospheric Chemistry)\n\nLavinia Onel, Alexander Brennan, Michele Gianella, Grace Ronnie, Ana Lawry Aguila, Gus Hancock, Lisa Whalley, Paul W. Seakins, Grant A. D. Ritchie, and Dwayne E. Heard\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 10, 4877–4894, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-4877-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-4877-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHydroperoxy (HO2) radicals are key intermediates participating in a rapid chemical cycling at the centre of the tropospheric oxidation. Fluorescence assay by gas expansion (FAGE) technique is the most commonly used for the HO2 measurements in the atmosphere. However, FAGE is an indirect technique, requiring calibration. This work finds a good agreement between the indirect FAGE method and the direct cavity ring-down spectroscopy method and hence validates FAGE and the FAGE calibration method.\n\nAbundances of isotopologues and calibration of CO2 greenhouse gas measurements\n\nPieter P. Tans, Andrew M. Crotwell, and Kirk W. Thoning\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 10, 2669–2685, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-2669-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-2669-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe describe a new CO2 calibration system for the Central Calibration Laboratory of the World Meteorological Organization Global Atmosphere Watch program. The system uses two laser spectroscopic instruments to measure the three major CO2 isotopologues individually. We account for isotopic differences between standards in the calibration hierarchy when assigning CO2 mole fraction, eliminating bias due to variations in the isotopic composition.\n\nIntercomparison of two cavity ring-down spectroscopy analyzers for atmospheric 13CO2â¯ ââ¯12CO2 measurement\n\nJiaping Pang, Xuefa Wen, Xiaomin Sun, and Kuan Huang\n\nAtmos.

However, standard gases to harmonize global measurements are not available to this day. We designed two methods to calibrate a suite of 8 CH4 gases with a wide range in isotopic composition to the VPDB and VSMOW scales with high precision and accuracy. Synthetic air mixtures with ~2 ppm of calibrated CH4 can be provided to the community by the ISOLAB of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany.\n\nMIPAS database: new HNO3 line parameters at 7.6â¯ Âµm validated with MIPAS satellite measurements\n\nAgnÃ¨s Perrin, Jean-Marie Flaud, Marco Ridolfi, Jean VanderÂ Auwera, and Massimo Carlotti\n\nAtmos.
