        "text": "In mid-1927, Edith and Otto Frank with two-year-old Margot moved into a spacious rented apartment in Marbachstrasse, in a residential Frankfurt area. The house had a garden where the neighbourhood children met for playing. Two years later, in 1929, her younger sister Anne was born. Edith and Otto educated their daughters along progressive lines, by supporting and furthering their development. The neighbourhood children also felt at home at the Franks’.\n\nAt the same time, the financial situation of the Frank family became difficult and their neighbourhood was increasingly targeted by members of the Nazi party (NSPAD) who marched through the streets chanting anti-Semitic slogans. In 1933, they moved to a smaller, cheaper apartment in Ganghoferstrasse in what is still known as the «Dichterviertel» (poets’ quarter). Margot had to change schools.\n\nOn 30 January 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of the Reich. One month later the Nazis unleashed the state terror against opponents, left-wing proponents, liberals, intellectuals and Jews. Children were not spared either: after the 1933 Easter holidays, Jewish children were allocated separate benches at school to segregate them from the “Aryan” pupils. Otto and Edith were hugely concerned about their future as a family and in particular about their children. They decided to leave Germany. While Otto Frank tried to build a new livelihood for his family in Amsterdam, Edith, Margot and Anne moved in with Edith’s mother, Rosa Holländer, in Aachen. In late December 1933, Edith followed her husband to Amsterdam with Margot who started at her new school in January. Anne was brought to Amsterdam six weeks later.\n\nEarly summer 1942 sees the start of the systematic deportation of Jews from the Netherlands. On 5 July 1942, Margot is one of the first to receive a summons for “labour duty in Germany”. The summons is compulsory and means separation from the family and deportation to a concentration camp. Otto and Edith are aware of the summons’ meaning and act immediately: the following day, the Frank family goes into hiding in the secret annex of Otto Frank’s company building.\n\nMargot is sixteen years old when she goes into hiding. Together with Anne, her parents, the van Pels family and Fritz Pfeffer, she spends more than two years in the secret annex, supported and looked after by former employees of Otto Frank’s. Everyday life is strictly structured around the working day in the spice warehouse below the secret annex: during work hours there must not be any activities that cause noise. Margot and Anne diligently pursue their learning so that they will be able to continue with their education after liberation. In the evenings, the girls also help with office tasks. At first the girls share a bedroom, but once Fritz Pfeffer moves in to the secret annex, Margot sleeps in her parents’ room.\n\nAnne writes that Margot’s character resembles that of her mother Edith, that she rarely loses control, that she is disciplined and clever. Anne, who loves theatre and films and would like to become a writer, finds it hard to understand her sister’s more modest goals. Margot wants to be a maternity nurse in Palestine after the war.\n\n«When I see him being partial to Margot, approving Margot’s every action, praising her, hugging her, I feel a gnawing ache inside, because I’m mad about him. I model myself on Father, and there’s no one in the world I love more. He doesn’t realize that he treats Margot differently from me: Margot just happens to be the cleverest, the kindest, the prettiest and the best. But I have a right to be taken seriously too. I’ve always been the clown and mischief-maker of the family; I’ve always had to pay double for my sins: once with scoldings and then again with my own sense of despair. I’m no longer satisfied with the meaningless affection or the supposedly serious talks. I long for something from Father that he’s incapable of giving. I’m not jealous of Margot; I never have been. I’m not envious of her brains or her beauty. It’s just that I’d like to feel that Father really loves.»\n\nHowever, time and again, there are episodes in the diary where the closeness of the two sisters becomes apparent, for example when they are lying under a blanket together and reading. The relationship changes in particular during the second year in the secret annex: Anne starts to open up to Margot and finds in her an ally who is pleased about her little sister being close to and in love with Peter van Pels.\n\nBetween late October and early November, the two girls are separated from their mother and transported to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp where there is no space for the many new detainees. Margot and Anne sleep in tents which do not withstand the winter storms, and are given hardly anything to eat. During the day they rip the soles off old shoes. Both are weak and run a high fever; they lie next to each other in the sick barracks. Margot dies first, Anne dies a few days later. It is presumed that they die in late February 1945, ultimately from typhus."
