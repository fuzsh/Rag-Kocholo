        "text": "While Otto established a branch of Opekta company in Amsterdam and thus created a new existence for his family, Edith, Margot and Anne temporarily moved in with Edith’s mother, Rosa Holländer, in Aachen. In late December 1933, Edith followed her husband together with Margot. Anne stayed with her grandmother until February, when the family was reunited in the Netherlands.\n\nExtract from a letter:\n\n«We had Margot with us at Christmas, and Anne has just come. Both children are full of fun. Anne a little comedian», wrote Edith in a letter to Germany in February 1934.\n\nIn the night of 9 to 10 November 1938, the «Kristallnacht» organised by the Nazi regime took place all over the Reich. In Aachen, as in other German cities, shops owned by Jews were smashed and synagogues set alight. Anne’s uncle Walter Holländer was deported to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. After his release, he fled to his brother’s in the USA. In March 1939, Anne’s maternal grandmother, Rosa Holländer, was able to move to Amsterdam to be with her daughter Edith’s family.\n\nOn 1 September 1939, the Second World War broke out when Nazi Germany invaded Poland. In May 1940, the Netherlands were also invaded by the German Army. Under Nazi occupation, the situation became increasingly threatening for Jews in Amsterdam. Already in the first pages of her diary, which Anne was given for her 13th birthday on 12 June 1942, she described how her radius of movement had been increasingly restricted since spring 1940.\n\n«After May 1940 the good times were few and far between: first there was the war, then the capitulation and then the arrival of the Germans, which is when the trouble started for the Jews. Our freedom was severely restricted by a series of anti-Jewish decrees: Jews were required to wear a yellow star; Jews were required to turn in their bicycles; Jews were forbidden to use trams; Jews were forbidden to ride in cars, even their own; Jews were required to do their shopping between 3.00 and 5.00 p.m.; Jews were required to frequent only Jewish-owned barbershops and beauty salons; Jews were forbidden to be out on the streets between 8.00 p.m. and 6.00 a.m.; Jews were forbidden to go to theatres, cinemas or any other forms of entertainment; Jews were forbidden to use swimming pools, tennis courts, hockey fields or any other athletic fields; Jews were forbidden to go rowing; Jews were forbidden to take part in any athletic activity in public; Jews were forbidden to sit in their gardens or those of their friends after 8.00 p.m.; Jews were forbidden to visit Christians in their homes; Jews were required to attend Jewish schools, etc. You couldn’t do this and you couldn’t do that, but life went on.»\n\n«They aren’t consistent in their treatment of me. One day they say that Anne’s a sensible girl and entitled to know everything, and the next that Anne’s a silly noodle who doesn’t know a thing and yet imagines she’s learned all she needs to know from books! I’m no longer the baby and spoiled little darling whose every deed can be laughed at. I have my own ideas, plans and ideals, but am un\n\nable to articulate them yet.\n\nOh well. So much comes into my head at night when I’m alone, or during the day when I’m obliged to put up with people I can’t abide or who invariably misinterpret my intentions. That’s why I always come back to my diary – I start there and end there because Kitty’s always patient. I promise her that, despite everything, I’ll keep going, that I’ll find my own way and choke back my tears. I only wish I could see some results or, just once, receive encouragement from someone who loves me.\n\nDon’t condemn me, but think of me as a person who sometimes reaches bursting point!»\n\nDiary, 30 October 1943"
