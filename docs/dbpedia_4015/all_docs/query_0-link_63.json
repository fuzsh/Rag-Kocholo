        "text": "6\n\nLe Mouvement Régénérateur\n\nPour nous, Français israélites du XIXe siècle, notre patrie c’est la France; notre noblesse politique, c’est la sublime révolution de ’89.\n\n—Archives israélites de France, 1843\n\nTRANSFORMING THE JEWS into productive members of modern society was an idea whose development has been traced through two fairly distinct phases. Initially, the process was associated with régénération, a term introduced into the vocabulary of the Jewish question by Henri Grégoire in 1785. By régénération Grégoire meant improvement, or “civic betterment,” as Christian Dohm put it. The goal was to permit the Jews to recapture their humanity by freeing them of the various disabilities that had corrupted their physical, social, and religious behavior and mentality. Clearly, society would need to assume much of the responsibility for what was wrong with the Jews; the Jews, for their part, would need to cooperate both by abandoning those economic pursuits that violated the public trust and by removing any obstacles posed by their religion. In the final analysis, the principal objective of régénération was to form worthy citizens of the state; toward this end, Jewish leaders enthusiastically endorsed socio-economic modernization. Berr Isaac Berr, among others, regarded it as inherent in the responsibilities of citizenship, as was devotion to the patrie, the essential lesson that the Jews as citizens needed to learn. Citizenship, according to Jewish leaders, did not appear to require religious reform, an idea still virtually unknown in France.\n\nFrom approximately 1806, the entrance of the Jews into modern French society was viewed from a new perspective. Although doubts were expressed by various political leaders concerning the ability of the Jews to fulfill their civic duties, citizenship was, willy nilly, an accomplished fact, and this was reconfirmed by the Assembly of Jewish Notables and the Paris Sanhedrin. Discussion subsequently shifted away from the question of the Jews’ suitability for citizenship and toward the far less clear, but no less important, matter of what could be envisioned for the future of Jewish–gentile relations. Beginning with Napoleon, who may be regarded as a key transitional figure in redefining the Jewish question, the idea of assimilating the Jews into French society assumed a position of prominence in public discussions. Encouraging intermarriage was one avenue toward fusion, a term that came to describe, as far as gentile observers were concerned, the ultimate goal of emancipation: the incorporation of the Jews within the French nation as indistinguishable elements of a single harmonious entity. Throughout the first two decades of the nineteenth century gentile writers criticized the Jews for failing to avail themselves of the generous invitation offered to them. And in seeking to explain this failure, virtually all competitors in the 1824 Strasbourg essay contest concluded that the Jewish religion was the major obstacle to the rapprochement of the Jews with French society and civilization.\n\nFor Jewish intellectuals in Paris fusion came to describe the dream of social acceptance among the intellectual and affluent of the city. For a few like Terquem, the goal of fusion was to be pursued not by abandoning one’s Jewish identity, but by first rethinking the fundamental ideas of Judaism, and then by shaping one’s identity accordingly. Though undeniably radical in his religious views, Terquem did not advocate the disappearance of Jews qua Jews as other proposals would have it. Thus, he did not endorse intermarriage. Furthermore, he viewed the alienation of Jewish intellectuals in Paris as the symptom of a problem, not as behavior to be emulated, and therefore warned that unless changes were introduced, the situation would continue to deteriorate. Nevertheless, his views were clearly unacceptable to the vast majority of French Jews, and as we shall see, evoked considerable protest.\n\nThe middle of the 1830s witnessed a third attempt to examine the social and religious significance of emancipation. With the appearance of a new journal, La Régénération (Strasbourg, 1836–1837), new meaning was given to the term. It now came to represent the rebirth of the Jewish people; a rebirth not in the sense of a transformation into something new, but a restoration of the original essence that Judaism had lost. Wiedergeburt, the German title of the bilingual journal, encapsulated the new meaning assigned to régénération. Moreover, proponents of régénération, the régénérateurs, rejected the goal of assimilation. Their objective was the preservation of a distinct Jewish identity; civil fusion, not social fusion, would be pursued.1\n\nEfforts to redefine régénération at this time were linked to the conflation of several important political, legal, and social developments. Most important was the Revolution of July 1830, which inaugurated a period of greater openness and liberalism. A return to the values of 1789 and the reemergence of the democratic ideal were reflected in the establishment of a constitutional monarchy and the containment of the role of the Catholic Church in the political and social arena. With respect to the Jews there were unprecedented efforts to treat them as full-fledged citizens. The law of 8 February 1831 redressed the last major example of inequity by declaring that members of the Jewish clergy were civil servants and therefore eligible for state salaries. Beyond its obvious economic importance for communities that had been specially taxed in order to pay these salaries, the law of 1831 was significant for acknowledging Judaism on equal terms with Catholicism and Protestantism. Out of gratitude to the new regime, Samuel Cahen dedicated his French translation of the Bible to the new king, Louis-Philippe, and L. M. Lambert declared the law to be “the greatest act of justice in favor of the Jews since the destruction of the Second Temple.” This new-found sense of security during the July Monarchy may explain the rediscovery of ties with Jews abroad. As we shall see, concern for the plight of Jews in Poland, Syria, and Switzerland were only the earliest indications of the Jews’ group consciousness, which transcended the national borders of France.2\n\nImprovements in the political and legal climate were accompanied by a development within the Jewish community that provided the ideas of régénération with a social and intellectual context. Le mouvement régénérateur,3 as it came to be known, was composed of a generation of Jewish intellectuals who had just come of age in the 1830s. Members of this Jewish elite, in most cases one generation removed from preemancipation restrictions, were influenced largely by the ideas of Haskalah, Enlightenment, and French liberalism. Through their involvement in various institutions and activities, be they administrative, educational, or publicistic, they sought to accelerate the modernization of French Jewry. Born at the end of the eighteenth century or at the beginning of the nineteenth century in northeastern France, these men received a traditional Jewish education either in their native Alsace-Lorraine or, more often, in neighboring Germany. As opportunities opened, though slowly, for entrance into French secondary schools and universities, they obtained general secular education as well as specialized training in the liberal professions. This was accompanied by a fair measure of recognition in general society as evidenced by their professional accomplishments and membership in respected associations. As this generation came of age and took advantage of the liberal climate of the 1830s and 1840s, many of its members gained entrée into the intellectual circles of France. These ardent students of French life and culture, largely through their scholarly pursuits, began to interact regularly with non-Jews and to collaborate in joint ventures. Invariably, this interaction led to their adoption of enlightened gentile values. When these Jewish intellectuals turned their attention to Jewish issues, their approach bore unmistakable traces of a “French” perspective. Armed with the latest tools of science, they subjected the whole of Jewish life to a thorough reevaluation and concluded that Jewish education, rabbinic training, and the synagogue were most in need of reform.\n\nThe régénérateurs started from the proposition that the condition of French Jewry was without precedent: the rights of citizenship were accompanied by the demands of a new age, never before experienced by earlier generations living under inequality and persecution. Citizenship implied obligations to the patrie and to fellow citizens, and these duties touched all facets of religious and socio-economic life. If the Jews of France were to become productive members of society, it was essential that Jewish education take these civic issues into account. But the régénérateurs saw an adjustment to emancipated civic life as only half the challenge. They were concerned that emancipation also signalled a tendency among many Jews to forsake the Jewish ritual observances of their fathers. A growing indifference to the life of tradition, expressed especially in decreasing synagogue attendance, was viewed as an ominous danger to the future of the Jewish people. And the unceasing efforts directed at Jews by Christian missionary groups, enhanced by several celebrated apostasies, constituted a threat both to the continued existence of the Jewish community and to the viability of the Jewish religion. These challenges led the régénérateurs to reassert a special destiny for the Jewish people in the unfolding of the history of humankind. As the following biographical sketches of leading régénérateurs will show, a collective mentalité was born out of their common background, orientation, and responsiveness to issues of grave concern.\n\nGerson-Lévy (1784–1864), a leading spokesman for moderate religious reform and a proponent of educational modernization, was educated at the école centrale de la Moselle. During the French occupation, he served as a teacher of French language and literature in Frankfurt am Main. It was in Germany that Gerson-Lévy met some of the leading Jewish intellectuals of the day, including Heinrich Heine, Isaak Jost, Leopold Zunz, as well as fellow-Frenchman Samuel Cahen. Upon his return to France in 1814, Gerson-Lévy entered the bookselling business in Metz; there he became active in Jewish educational reform, intially by helping to establish one of the first primary schools for Jews in France and later as a school inspector. For thirty years he was attached to the école centrale rabbinique, both as professor of French language and literature, and as a member of the school’s administrative commission. Gerson-Lévy was also extremely active in the general intellectual life of Metz. He was one of the founders of the Société des amis des lettres, des sciences, et des arts, later called the Académie impériale de Metz, and in addition, he was editor of the political journal l’Indépendent from 1830 to 1855.4\n\nA close associate of Gerson-Lévy, though separated by considerable geographical distance, was Samuel Cahen (1796–1862). A Jewish educator, editor, and translator of the Bible, Cahen was born in Metz but was sent to Mayence to pursue rabbinical studies under Rabbi Hirtz Scheuer. At the same time, he studied modern languages and literatures. Upon his return to France Cahen turned his attention to education. In 1820 he wrote what would become the most widely used Jewish catechism in France, and in 1823 he became director of the Jewish consistorial school in Paris. Cahen held this position until 1840, when he became the first editor of the Archives israélites de France. As head of this important journal, which though devoted to moderate religious reform opened its pages to exponents of orthodox views, Cahen was in contact with every major figure of French Jewry. Moreover, both the journal and his own scholarly interests enabled him to remain associated with leading German Jewish scholars such as Leopold Zunz. A French translation of the Bible, together with critical notes, was his most important achievement in a life devoted to Jewish scholarship. Beyond his scholarly, educational, and communal activities within the Jewish orbit, Cahen was a respected member of French learned societies. Succeeding his father as editor of the Archives israélites was Isidore Cahen. Born in Paris in 1826, he was educated at the école normale supérieure. In 1849 Catholic pressure prevented him from assuming a newly appointed teaching position, and following this scandal, he devoted himself to journalism and to teaching at the séminaire rabbinique. He would emerge as a founder of the Alliance israélite universelle.5\n\nMichel Berr (1780–1843) and Charles Oulif (1794–1867) were both prominent in the legal profession and used this prominence to advantage in furthering the interests of the Jewish community. Berr, who continued his father’s (Berr Isaac Berr) concern for régénération, was the first Jew to practice law in France. As a boy he studied the Hebrew and German languages with Benjamin (Louis) Wolf, who was recommended to Berr’s father by Naphtali Herz Wessely. He received his formal education at the école centrale in Nancy and the University of Strasbourg, where he studied law. Berr was a deputy to the Assembly of Jewish Notables and secretary of the Sanhedrin. Later, he was employed by the French government in several official capacities, first as division chief in the Ministry of the Interior in Westphalia and then, upon his return to France in 1809, as head of the office of the prefecture of Meurtre. After returning to Paris in 1813, he devoted himself to literature, journalism, and translation. A member of many learned societies, Berr wrote often on issues of general political and social interest, contributed numerous essays in French journals on subjects of Jewish interest, and translated Hebrew poetry, including Wessely’s Shirei Tifferet, into German and French. Two elementary school textbooks written by Berr reflect his deep interest in Jewish education. Charles Oulif was educated at the lycée imperial of Metz and later at the University of Strasbourg, where he became the first Jew to receive a law degree (December 1815). He subsequently was an officer in the National Guard and later a lawyer at the royal court in Metz. As as member of the Société pour l’encouragement de l’instruction élémentaire dans le département de la Moselle, Oulif used his influence to found the Jewish primary school in his native city. He also held a position on the faculty of the école centrale rabbinique, where he taught comparative law. In 1834 he accepted an invitation to the Chair of Law at the University of Brussels. After returning to France, Oulif was active in the Société pour l’encouragement des arts et métiers, and he later became vice-president of the board of trustees of the rabbinical seminary.6\n\nSeveral of the régénérateurs were devoted almost exclusively to Jewish scholarship. Their reputations in academe and their expertise in their respective fields of Jewish studies enabled them to exert influence on Jewish affairs. One leading scholar, Adolphe Franck (1809–1893), studied Talmud under Rabbi Marchand Ennery before pursuing advanced studies in medicine and philosophy. In 1840 he became professor of philosophy at Charlemagne College in Paris, and later was professor of Greek and Latin philosophy at the Collège de France. He also held a high office in the Royal Library in the 1840s. In addition to numerous studies on topics of Jewish interest, Franck published the first critical work on Jewish mysticism, La Kabbala ou Philosophie religieuse, in 1843. Active in Jewish communal affairs, he was vice-president of the Central Consistory.7\n\nSalomon Munk (1803–1867), France’s most distinguished Jewish scholar, was a native of Glogau, Germany; he studied at the University of Berlin and at the University of Bonn, concentrating in Semitic and Oriental languages. In 1828 Munk arrived in Paris and supported himself as a tutor of Alphonse and Gustave Rothschild, among others, until he was appointed cataloguer of Hebrew and Semitic manuscripts at the Bibliothèque Nationale in 1838. Despite having lost his eyesight, Munk remained undaunted in his academic and scholarly pursuits. In 1863 he succeeded Ernest Renan in the Chair of Hebrew at the Collège de France. Among his numerous contributions to Wissenschaft des Judentums, Munk’s critical edition of the Arabic text of Maimonides’ Guide to the Perplexed, with a French translation, was his most respected and celebrated work. In addition to his scholarly work, Munk served the Jewish public as educator and communal servant. He was crucially involved in the Crémieux-Montefiore efforts to resolve the Damascus Affair and also worked as secretary of the Central Consistory.8 Munk’s successor to the Chair of Hebrew, Joseph Derenbourg (1811–1895), was also a distinguished Arabist and scholar of antiquity. He maintained a keen interest in the education of Jewish youth, and was a member of the central committee of the Alliance israélite universelle, and later served as its vice-president.9\n\nThough not of Munk’s scholarly calibre, Albert Cohn (1814–1877) represented another outstanding blend of scholarship and public service. Born in Hungary and educated in Vienna, Cohn settled in Paris in 1836. He worked as a private instructor of Hebrew and Jewish history in the home of Baron James de Rothschild. From 1839 until his death Cohn served as almoner of the Rothschild’s charities and in this capacity travelled extensively to Jewish communities in North Africa and the Near East. His numerous visits to the Holy Land accorded Jewish settlements there much-needed moral and financial support and led to the establishment of hospitals and schools. Cohn was also able to secure an improvement in the status of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire, and he assisted the Jews of Algeria in establishing a communal organization. These efforts abroad did not prevent Cohn from remaining deeply involved in Jewish philanthropy and education in France. He helped organize several charities, taught adult classes in Paris, and served without remuneration as professor of Arabic and biblical exegesis at the séminaire israélite for nearly two decades.10\n\nUnited initially by common background, education, socio-economic status, and scholarly interests, these Jewish intellectuals were brought together by their collective self-image and shared commitment to the regeneration of Jewish life. They viewed themselves both as heirs to the legacy of the Berlin Haskalah and as the authentic interpreters of the ideology of emancipation.11 This entitled them to assume a leading role in the French Jewish community. However, the most immediate impetus for the emergence of le mouvement régénérateur was the awareness of growing disaffection among urbanized Jews. The régénérateurs traced the roots of this trend to the general low esteem accorded the Jews and their religion and the impact that it left on many members of the Jewish community. Ironically, the achievement of legal equality did not, as some had envisioned, fully eradicate prejudices concerning the Jewish religion. The claim that “Judaism is not fertile ground for genuine civilization” was among the most common allegations, implying that one should cease to be a Jew if one aspires to moral dignity and perfection.12 Not infrequently, articles in the French press displayed an extremely critical, and often contemptuous, attitude toward Judaism and its adherents. In one instance a writer claimed, in La Revue des Deux Mondes, that the Jews were morally degenerate, and referred to them as a “parasitic plant with no roots in the soil.” The people of Israel, he insisted, were sworn enemies of society: they “have become a sort of rejected Cain, marked in the front as the first murderer of the world . . . and condemned like him to eternal rejection. In killing the son of the carpenter, the apostle of love and liberty, the Jews have placed humanity and God Himself on the cross.”13 Another journal, Le Courrier du Haut-Rhin, included an article calling the Jews “the scourge of Alsace”; it maintained that the Jews “are isolated from the rest of society, their flawed faith is often their only means of success, they are outside the movement of civilization, and, in general, without instruction.” One Jewish observer added that it was common for Jews to be addressed in the familiar tu form. In his estimation the form was used in a condescending manner, confirming his suspicion that the Jews were still viewed as eternally foreign to social virtues and devoid of human dignity.14\n\nAlthough such forms of derision were clearly drawn from a long legacy of anti-Jewish prejudice, they owed their continued fervor partly to the resurgence of Catholicism, dating from the time of the Restoration. Félicité de Lamennais, for example, a liberal Catholic theologian, repeated the traditional church doctrine concerning the spiritual blindness of the Jews.15 The Jews’ failure to recognize Jesus as their savior had brought upon them a fall from divine grace, as evidenced by their history of dispersion and persecution. For theologians such as Lamennais, these facts proved the alien nature of the Jews and the inadequacy of their religious teachings. Furthermore, the accusation that the Jews were guilty of deicide isolated them from the rest of humanity: to have been capable of committing such a heinous crime meant that they were, by nature, capable of any other horror. These theological-moral arguments also found expression in various art forms of the period. The legend of the Wandering Jew, for example, became popular in France at the turn of the nineteenth century and was subsequently popularized in the ballet Ahasvérus (1833) by Edgar Quinet and in the novel Juif érrant (1844–1845) by Eugène Sue.16 Other authors such as Victor Hugo, Lamartine, Alfred de Musset, Henri de Balzac, and Alfred de Vigny gave literary expression to the dominant anti-Jewish myths.17 Whatever the medium, the theological condemnation of the Jews, according to Jacob Katz, “prepared the ground for his moral defamation.”18\n\nEmanating from a variety of intellectual, religious, and popular sources, condemnation of the Jewish religion bore much of the responsibility for the slow pace of Jewish integration into French society. Only a small number of Jews distinguished themselves in French intellectual life and in service to the state before the 1840s. As is often the case for minorities, the perceived lack of progress, in turn, lent additional support to the popular, stereotypic image. The most serious effect of the conflation of these factors was that many of the Jews who succeeded in acquiring some general education reached similar conclusions about their own religious-cultural heritage. Many had come to believe that Jewish society and its institutions could neither serve as an adequate framework for the full development of their talents and moral dispositions, nor provide the resources necessary for the advancement of their professional careers. Among many educated and upwardly mobile Jews, a growing indifference toward religion became discernible; Jewishness came to be regarded as a liability. Consequently, those few who succeeded in penetrating “the sanctuary of science” did so while dissociating themselves from conspicuous Jewish behavior and characteristics. With unprecedented acceptance and recognition in general society, many of these Jews came to the realization that it was unnecessary to maintain an affiliation with the Jewish community and found that working for the benefit of their coreligionists had become a parochial, potentially embarrassing undertaking.19 For still others, anti-Jewish criticism and prejudice inspired an increasingly stubborn resistance to la voix du siècle and to any innovation whatsoever.\n\nThe erosion of religious faith and ethnic identity among Jewish intellectuals represented a problem of enormous proportions and implications, both in its own right and in terms of its impact on the Jewish community. The betrayal of Jewish loyalties communicated to those who still identified themselves as Jews the unmistakable message that Judaism lacked relevance in the modern world and that it might even pose an insurmountable obstacle to social integration and professional advancement. In this respect alone the desertion of intellectuals represented a dangerous pattern of behavior and thinking. Beyond this, according to Simon Bloch, editor of La Régénération, it threatened the viability of the entire program of regeneration by depriving the community of its most talented resources.\n\nIf the Jews have obtained the same insights as other Frenchmen and have ardently contributed to the public prosperity, this advantage has turned to the detriment of their culte; because in laying down the tribute on the altar of the patrie commune, they ceased to work for the amelioration of their coreligionists, and feeling too enclosed in the narrow circle of their nation in order to direct its energies to it, they have preferred to spread them out in a wider sphere . . . where they have obtained greater recognition and more consideration than among their coreligionists.20\n\nThose Jews who had acquired higher education, sophistication, and professional success could serve as much-needed role models for their less fortunate coreligionists. Moreover, by remaining within the fold, they could make valuable contributions to the advancement of religious regeneration.\n\nThe régénérateurs were aware of the difficulties of reinvolving disaffected Jews. The argument heard most often was that the first obligation of the citizen was to employ his intelligence in the service of the state and society at large. Bloch challenged the idea that this represented a more significant contribution to the patrie than working on behalf of one’s own community: “This is an error which reveals a sentiment of pride and egoism; . . . doesn’t the learned Jew contribute to the state when he works zealously to spread his knowledge among the 130,000 [sic] Jews who are in France, and to contribute of all his power to raise them to the level which they must occupy in society?”21 Bloch maintained that to assist in the modernization of fellow French Jews was to contribute to the same sacred work of perfecting humanity, albeit on a more limited scale.22\n\nIt is highly unlikely that Bloch and his fellow régénérateurs expected rhetoric alone to lead estranged Jews back to the community. However, it was possible, in their opinion, to arrest or at least retard the process of alienation by addressing some of the issues raised by the confrontation between Judaism and modernity. Fundamental to their thinking was the assumption that with an improved public image Judaism would become more attractive to the modern, sophisticated French Jew. Toward this end, the régénérateurs embarked upon various activities intended to modernize their religion in the following areas: the aesthetics of synagogue prayer, the harmonization of religion with the exigencies of citizenship, and the articulation of the validity of Judaism in intellectually intelligible and morally defensible terms.\n\nIn setting out their plan of action, the régénérateurs rejected Olry Terquem’s diagnosis of the problems facing the Jews as well as his proposed solutions. Terquem’s inflammatory style, his anti-consistory position, and the intemperance of his proposals for reform evoked strong denunciation and dissociation by Jewish writers. In responding to the Lettres Tsarphatiques, Terquem’s critics embarked on an important step in the crystallization of the ideology of régénération. Ironically, Terquem’s writings encouraged moderates to explore the meaning of emancipation and to define the objectives of their own movement. Responses to the early Lettres Tsarphatiques branded the documents as “scandalous,” “incendiary,” and “divisive.” Michel Berr, for one, claimed that Terquem’s purpose was to erase an “essential and radical demarcation which must exist between Judaism and Christianity.”23 Later reactions were no less vehement in their criticism. Albert Cohn stated that Terquem’s rationale for transferring the Sabbath to Sunday was dangerous. Cohn disputed the idea that Sunday was the “national day of rest.” Sunday, he insisted, was consecrated not by France but by Christianity, and therefore, the day had no national significance. Observing the Sabbath on Sunday would only bring Judaism a step closer to Christianity, not to the patrie. At the same time, it would represent an explicit denial of the historic validity of Mosaism.24 Salomon Munk argued that the abolition of the Jewish Sabbath would spell the end of the Jewish religion. Terquem’s proposal was, according to Munk, characteristic of the rational Deism that the author wished to substitute for Judaism. Such a philosophy could never suit the Jewish community as a whole nor, for that matter, any society.25 Samuel Cahen attacked Terquem for ridiculing Jews and Judaism in public instead of bringing his proposals directly to the attention of the Central Consistory or other Jewish leaders. The Lettres Tsarphatiques, he maintained, were “dangerous and useless.”26\n\nIt is significant, though not surprising, that Terquem’s three major critics (Cohn, Munk, and Cahen) became leaders of the régénérateur movement. In fact, the three had cooperated once before in an attempt to modernize religious worship.27 The appearance of the Lettres Tsarphatiques offered an opportunity for these régénérateurs to begin articulating their positions on religious reform. In the case of each of the three respondents, sharp criticism of Terquem’s radical proposals was accompanied by the acknowledgement that certain changes were absolutely essential. In other words, though they disagreed with Terquem’s style and methods, the régénérateurs did not dismiss the theoretical soundness of reform; rather, they contrasted the impracticality and dangerous implications in Terquem’s system to their own alternative ideas of moderate, well-reasoned change. They regarded the amelioration of Jewish practices as a process that would lend strength to the foundations of the religion and faith. In contradistinction to Terquem, they contended that changes could be achieved through cooperation with traditional Jewish institutions and thus envisioned significant roles for the Central Consistory and for the rabbinate.28 There can be no denying, however, that Terquem’s ideas influenced the path taken by more moderate régénérateurs. His proposals for regulation of circumcision, liturgical reform, alternatives to traditional worship, improvement of rabbinic training, and decentralization found expression, albeit in a limited manner, in the writings and activities of moderate régénérateurs.\n\nThe primary contention of proponents of reform was that the meaning and function of the Jewish religion were no longer easily discernible. Many Jews and non-Jews attributed this obfuscation to a general emptiness and inadequacy in Judaism’s religious teachings. However, in contrast with the fusionist position of Terquem, the régénérateurs sought to portray Judaism in positive terms. In their presentation of the functional relevance of Judaism in modern society, the moral virtues of universal brotherhood and charity emerged as fundamental tenets of the religion. Simon Bloch contended that religion is unacceptable to God and therefore devoid of value if it fails to impel its adherents to fulfill obligations toward society. This understanding of the meaning of religion was based on a distinction between religion and piété (piety or idealism). He insisted that a religion incapable of inspiring piété in the hearts of men or operating without piété serves no function. Piété, in turn, is the element in religion that evokes greater commitment to law, justice, and service to the state. Bloch explained that\n\nwe are born into the religion which our parents profess, but we must elevate ourselves to piété by our own efforts. Religion serves us as the guide in this world; piété opens for us the perspective of a life to come. We receive, in the bosom of our mother, our first religious impressions, but we draw piété from a celestial source: religion is the raw diamond; piété is the polished diamond. Religion teaches us to honor God; piété shows us the route which leads us to Him. Religion is an object of faith; piété is a sentiment of the heart. Religion gives us convictions; piété is replete with good works. Religion is a collection of positive truths; piété animates, invigorates these truths and gives a happy direction to the will of man. Religion is the temple; piété is the Goddess. We can change religion, but piété is inseparable from the life of the soul.29\n\nAn essential component of régénération, this conception of piété, though stressed repeatedly in classical and medieval rabbinic literature, took on a sense of urgency in nineteenth-century France. Special emphasis was placed upon the teleological role of ritual observances to lead Jews to lofty spiritual ideals by appealing to the heart and other senses. This ideological formulation, mirrored, typically, in Jewish educational thought,30 reflects the efforts of the movement to guard against mechanical, routinized performance of religious rituals.31\n\nAt the center of the ideology of régénération was the claim that during “centuries of darkness” and persecution Judaism had degenerated, acquiring foreign elements that obscured its “grand principles.” Through “an invincible attachment to minutiae,” in the words of Gerson-Lévy, “we became enslaved to ritual practices which for us no longer make any sense. Of the ancient Egyptians it is said that to them everything was god except God Himself. One can say the same of our degenerated cult where everything is religion except religion itself.”32 While conceding that the “whole body had become gangrenous,” he insisted that it was not too late to administer the remedy: “It is time to erect a dike against this dissolution, to save the demoralization with which it is threatened.” Otherwise, there was a distinct danger that political freedom could result in the abandonment of the religion that generations “had consecrated with precious blood.”33\n\nIn theory, the solution was simple. It had become necessary to reverse the historical process responsible for the degeneration of the Jewish religion. Indeed, the very term régénération signified a sensitivity to the forces of historical development and the indispensability of interpreting the past. According to the early nineteenth-century definition, régénération was action to reconstitute in its original state that which had undergone decadence and regression.34 At the same time, régénération rested on the premise that human history progresses steadily, forming a continuous movement toward a future far superior to the present or the past. The idea of progress presupposed a connection between scientific, technological, and material advances on the one hand, and social improvement on the other. Vico’s vision of progress in the form of a spiral, with each turn higher than the preceding one, was an important image in later thought, as was Condorcet’s view of the critical role played by the French Revolution in propelling man forward. Kant’s idea of moral development and Comte’s conception of intellectual progress further contributed to the belief that the possibility of human perfection was within reach and that it could be achieved through universal enlightenment and rational education. For prominent liberals such as Guizot, Cousin, and Madame de Staël, progress was the undisputed law of history.35\n\nParadoxically, proponents of régénération defined progress as a return to an idealized past. In their view, the most urgent goal of all was to restore Judaism to its original purity while adjusting religious custom to the demands of contemporary civilization. Samuel Cahen asserted that the greatest obstacle to progress was ignorance of the history of the minhagim: “One would be surprised by the number of customs we have borrowed from foreign nations. Many presume that these date from antiquity, but the majority are very recent. The most useful work that one could undertake will be to do for the entire religion that which [Leopold] Zunz has done for the liturgy.” This could be accomplished, it was argued, through the elimination of those laws and ceremonies which had been introduced in response to persecution, while bearing no relation to the true essence of the religion.36\n\nThis distinction between a religion and its ceremonies represented the common ground shared by critical scholarship and ritual reform. Invariably, members of the small cadre of critical scholars were vocal proponents of religious modernization. In contrast with Germany, few were practicing rabbis; they were employed variously as book publishers, teachers, manuscript curators, editors of journals, and later, as university professors. Most of the studies devoted to Hebrew grammar and philology in the first half of the nineteenth century were, on the other hand, undertaken by rabbis. Primarily intended to instill greater enthusiasm in the study of the Hebrew language, these works do not represent an endorsement of the objectives of Wissenschaft, although containing some hints of the new critical spirit. Few rabbis were willing to touch the potentially explosive questions raised by historical research. For lay scholars Hebrew grammar was, typically, a preoccupation early in their careers, in a way serving as a bridge between traditional and critical scholarship.\n\nThe renewed concern for Hebrew language mirrored the profusion of Hebraic studies in general French society. Eighteenth-century Christian scholars such as François Masclef, P. Houbigant, and Pierre Guarin directed their efforts at developing theories of Hebrew grammar and at the reconstruction of “corrupted” biblical texts. In 1751, with the support of Louis Orléans, a Chair in Hebrew Scripture was established at the Sorbonne. Interest in Hebrew texts and grammar continued into the nineteenth century, attracting the attention of such prominent Orientalists as Silvestre de Sacy and Auguste Pichard. Despite the chasm that still separated Jews from the mainstream of French society in the first decades of the century, Hebrew language came to be the one academic concern shared by Jewish and Christian scholars alike. The creation of the société asiatique in Paris in 1822 marked the first time Jews and Christians were able to participate in joint scholarly ventures, but this opportunity was short-lived. Owing to the Catholic reaction in the latter years of the Restoration, Jews lost much ground in their quest for social acceptance, thus making Jewish-Christian collaboration virtually impossible. Only after the 1830 Revolution was there a revivification of Jewish membership in learned societies and a resumption of scholarly collaboration.37\n\nSamuel Cahen’s ambitious project of publishing a new French translation of the Hebrew Bible was clearly an outgrowth of the new scholarly tradition in France. Begun in 1831, the project constituted an impressive achievement. Before analyzing this literature, however, we must first consider the social and political background to the project, as well as the forces that ultimately shaped its character. Despite the fact that Jewish-Christian collaboration was again possible after 1830, such opportunities certainly did not materialize immediately; moreover, we may assume that the decision to undertake the Bible translation was made during the period when Jewish scholars were still excluded from academic circles. The reversal of earlier liberal trends, coupled with the experience of exclusion may have driven Jewish intellectuals more tightly together. Also, given the strong Christian orientation in French biblical studies, it is not unlikely that Cahen’s project constituted an attempt to wrest the Bible from Christian dominance and place it squarely within the province of Jewish studies. This decision may have been strengthened by the realization that even liberals such as Alexander Vinet, Benjamin Constant, Due de Broglie, and Guizot continued to identify French civilization with Christianity, despite their commitment to the separation of Church and State.38\n\nAlthough Franco-Jewish scholarship mirrored much of the activity pioneered by the German Wissenschaft des Judentums, the principal focus of research in the two countries was decidedly different. French scholars rarely worked in the area of rabbinic literature, the field that was given the greatest attention by the Wissenschaft movement in Germany. While the French did concur with their German counterparts concerning the evolution of rabbinic law, the possibility of dialogue and cooperation between the reformers and the rabbis in France precluded unrestrained assaults on the Talmud. Energies were directed, instead, at biblical and philosophical studies. Completed over the course of two decades, the new Cahen translation represented an amalgam of classical and critical methodologies. French Jewish scholars admitted to modelling their work after the Mendelssohn Biur, the first modern German translation produced by Jews. Midrashic interpretation was all but rejected in favor of the medieval French and Spanish schools of “literalist” exegesis, special attention was paid to Hebrew grammar and comparative semitics, and preference was given to the contextual approach in explaining difficult words or phrases. Convinced, nonetheless, of the indispensability of rabbinics for biblical research, Samuel Cahen had begun work on a volume of rabbinic vocabulary, and planned to translate the Mishnah and the Talmud. Typically, relevant texts of medieval and modern commentaries were translated and published along with a particular book of the Bible. The Isaiah volume, for example, included Abarbanel’s preface to his commentary, and the Ezekiel volume contained portions of Munk’s translation of the Guide of the Perplexed, Abarbanel’s preface to his commentary, and a chapter from Zunz’s opus on sermons. The principal variants of the Septuagint and the Samaritan texts were consulted, as were other ancient and modern translations.39\n\nIn many respects the French translation project signalled a larger development at work among Jewish intellectuals of the West. Early in the nineteenth century many of them appropriated the methods and tools of modern scholarship and proceeded to subject classical Jewish literature to critical examination. Philology, anthropology, ethnography and archaeology—methods used in the burgeoning science of antiquities—yielded new avenues for a broader study of text and people. In the specific case of the Bible project, scholars relied heavily on the work of Germans such as Eichhorn, Ewald, De Wette, Gesenius, and Rosenmüller. Curiously, although this scholarly project was thoroughly consistent with the new intellectual milieu of nineteenth-century western Europe, no such enterprise was undertaken by Jewish scholars elsewhere, particularly not in Germany. With rare exception, German Jewish scholars shied away from biblical studies, while favoring research in rabbinic literature. Their purported traditionalism, however, hardly explains this scholarly trend. It is more likely that politics, not piety, discouraged German Jewish scholars from engaging in biblical research. Then dominated by Protestant scholars, the school of biblical criticism was believed to be motivated by anti-Jewish prejudice and hostility. German Jewish scholars were therefore especially apprehensive about engaging in biblical studies, possibly fearing that their work might be discredited through its association with harsh critics of Judaism. Moreover, research on the Bible would not prove as valuable as critical studies in the areas of post-biblical history and rabbinics, since the latter fields would enable scholars to lay the foundations for religious reform.40\n\nFrench Jewish scholars were not subject to the same political constraints concerning the critical study of the Bible. Operating well beyond the sphere of the heated controversy (despite opposition from Catholic and Protestant circles), they addressed the issues on which German Jews had remained silent. Salomon Munk, for example, was able to treat the various questions concerning the documentary hypothesis dispassionately, refuting most of the claims while accepting the idea, in principle, of human authorship of certain parts of the Pentateuch.41 Where the text of the Bible appeared overly supernatural, and therefore beyond belief, scholars strenuously sought ways of remaining within the loosely defined borders of Jewish tradition. Some followed German theologian David Friedrich Strauss, who viewed religion as an expression of the mind’s capacity to generate myths and treat them as revealed truths. Samuel Cahen went so far as to assert that young men destined for the rabbinate should be schooled in mythic thinking.42 Whatever device was used in promoting reverence for the text, Franco-Jewish scholars were unique in their reconciliation of faith and science. It may be no accident that the appearance of the first volume of the translation coincided with the important ordinance which finally accorded the Jewish religion full parity with Catholicism and Protestantism by recognizing Jewish clergy as employees of the state. Though originally conceived in response to social and intellectual exclusion, the substantive character of the Cahen Bible project may be viewed as a concrete expression of French Jewry’s new-found sense of political security.43\n\nExerting a powerful influence on the foundations of modern Jewish scholarship was western Europe’s noticeably heightened admiration for Sephardic culture. Spanish-Jewish cosmopolitanism and enlightenment were viewed as instructive models for modern, emancipated Jewry; medieval Ashkenazic culture, by contrast, was regarded with disdain. Among Franco-Jewish scholars the Spanish bias found expression in a renewed appreciation for Arabic language and Judaeo-Islamic culture, resulting in extensive research on Arabic manuscripts. This new scholarly preoccupation may be explained, additionally, by the contemporary French political reality. “We hope,” wrote Samuel Cahen, “for rapid progress in a branch of literature to which our possessions in Africa give even a political importance.” For these reasons, Jewish scholars appealed for the creation of a chair in Arabic and other Semitic languages at the école rabbinique de Metz, and, further, supported the transfer of the school to Paris where students would benefit by their proximity to leading centers of Oriental scholarship.44\n\nThe work of Salomon Munk and other French Jewish scholars in the field of medieval Arabic philosophy represents an inestimable contribution to modern Europe’s understanding of Islamic civilization. Munk’s French translation, careful annotation, and introduction to Maimonides’ Guide of the Perplexed is the best known and most important scholarly achievement in this area. Actually, Munk published the first segments of the Guide as an attempt to elucidate various problems of the ancient Israelite religion. His Mélanges de philosophie juive et arabe (1859) was, and still remains today, a remarkable display of classical erudition and painstaking research. Throughout this work Munk demonstrated the indispensability of studying Jewish thought within its general philosophical context, a theme which underlays all of modern Jewish studies. He also included a major discovery concerning the real identity of Avicebron, the author of Fons Vitae. Munk proved conclusively that the author was Solomon Ibn Gabirol, the Spanish Jewish poet and philosopher. This discovery was especially important, since Fons Vitae is an example of a philosophical work composed by a Jew that was a major influence on thirteenth-century Christian philosophy, although its influence on Jewish thought was insignificant. Charges of the pariah status of Jews could scarcely withstand such formidable evidence to the contrary.45\n\nIn their studies of theology and philosophy, Jewish scholars appear to have underscored the centrality of “essence” over “form” in Judaism. Generally, the utilization of historical methods in determining the various layers of development of Judaism was offensive to traditional sensibilities. Adolphe Franck’s research on ancient philosophy and on the Kabbalah led him to the conclusion that the spiritual and political elements in Judaism were mutually exclusive and antithetical. He viewed the history of Judaism as a process of progressive spiritualization and refinement that was actually accelerated by the Jewish people’s loss of political independence and sovereignty. Franck saw in this development evidence of Judaism’s universal character, a trait enabling the religion to adapt itself to varying conditions. It is not surprising that in a system where Judaism was viewed as ultimately free from the shackles of material and space, the significance of the ceremonial law would be minimized.46\n\nSalomon Munk was significantly more conservative than Franck in his view of the Jewish tradition. Nevertheless, Munk’s studies in the history of the Jews in antiquity also led him to views which diverged from the normative tradition. He was critical of Grand Rabbi Lion-Mayer Lambert’s account of the history of the Jewish people, Précis de l’histoire des Hébreux. Underlying Lambert’s presentation was a fundamental assumption which hardly needed to be articulated explicitly: an organic unity in Jewish history links ancient Hebrews and modern French Jews as members of the same nation, though separated by several millennia. This was what legitimized a retrospective glance into the past and made the study of virtuous historical Jewish figures especially instructive and relevant.47\n\nMunk was critical of the view of the historical unity of the Jewish people that prevailed among traditionalists. Jewish history, he argued, was the history of the knowledge of God, beginning with “the patriarch who first. . . proclaimed the existence of God the Creator; it is completed by the Messiah, that is, by the triumph of the monotheistic faith over the polytheism of the nations.”48 For Munk, Jewish history was an ideational continuum that constituted the essential link between past, present, and future. The ancient Hebrews were at once a political and a religious community, united by a common land and legislative system. Modern Jews, by contrast, were members of a communion that included individuals separated by their nationality, interests, mores, and cultural origins. Faith alone unified Jews in different parts of the world. Finally, Munk rejected the idea that the suffering experienced by Jews might be considered a component of national identity and consciousness: “This community of suffering relates to religious principles; it does not constitute a distinct nationality, and it will disappear in proportion to the disappearance of pagan elements from the beliefs adopted by modern nations.”49 Thus, the idea of God, which the Jews contributed to mankind, united Jews throughout history and enabled them to play a special role in the perfection of humanity. Echoing the view of Joseph Salvador, who sought to demonstrate that the institutions of Mosaic law were appropriate models for nineteenth-century French republicanism, Munk emphasized that with monotheism Jews had made a decisive contribution to civilization and this ought to be the essence of Jewish identity. Religious rituals, according to Munk, would serve both as tools in concretizing the monotheistic idea and as a means of lending unity to modern Jews.\n\nIn general, the oeuvre of Franco-Jewish scholars provided greater substantiation for the view that régénération ought to be conceived in religious as well as social terms. Taking the lead in the active promotion of religious régénération was the journal Archives Israélites de France, founded in Paris in 1840. From its inception the journal was dedicated to providing a forum for the scholarly examination of ceremonial laws and customs. Paving what was essentially a moderate path, editor Samuel Cahen urged scholars to research and describe the times and circumstances which had given birth to certain abuses; change would eventually follow as a matter of course, he believed, since “time and reason . . . are the true reformers.”50 The régénérateurs routinely cited rabbinic texts as proof that the idea of reform had been endorsed throughout history by eminent authorities and in an effort to show that the halakhic sources themselves revealed a process of development where certain specific rituals had undergone modification. Rooted in an abiding faith in evolutionary change, the régénérateurs’ concern for responsibly examining the history of laws and customs counterbalanced the drive for radical religious reform. Réforme graduée was their objective. Eventually a consensus emerged among régénérateurs regarding the specific changes that they envisioned.51\n\nTwo general factors were critically important in guiding the ideology of régénération. The first was an appreciation for medieval Sephardic Judaism that constituted a leading motif in modern Jewish scholarship. This appreciation also played a role in the thinking of educational and religious reformers. One of the earliest expressions of the glorification of Sephardic culture concerned the question of Hebrew pronunciation. Shortly after the Paris Jewish elementary school was established (1818), the Comité des écoles decided to adopt the Sephardic pronunciation, claiming that this was in accordance with the consensus of scholarly opinion. The Ashkenazic pronunciation was undoubtedly rejected because it sounded like Yiddish, itself a favorite target of enlightened criticism. The decision of the comité met with severe rabbinic opposition. Grand Rabbi Séligmann reprimanded the school director, while Grand Rabbi Deutz went so far as to withdraw his two sons from the establishment. However, the matter did not end here. The question of introducing the Sephardic pronunciation in schools and seminaries would continue to divide the régénérateurs and staunch traditionalists throughout the century. By the 1840s the consistorial grand rabbis in Paris had joined progressivists in supporting the linguistic innovation, while in Alsace adherence to the Ashkenazic pronunciation persisted.52 Most proponents of régénération also concluded that the Sephardic practice of Jewish law was more liberal than the Ashkenazic interpretation and therefore more appropriate for life under citizenship. Many laws restricting relations between Jews and gentiles (for example, yein nesekh and ḥukkat ha-goi) were presumed to be a response to the persecutions experienced by Ashkenazic Jewry. Moreover, reformers frequently pointed to Sephardic synagogues as models of decorum. Most of the régénérateurs shared the opinion of Zacharias Frankel, founder of the Positive-Historical movement in Germany, who, upon visiting France in 1852, praised the “magnificent” Bordeaux temple and the “noble melodies” of its cantor. As he put it, the Sephardic communities, and Bordeaux above all, had an “incontestable superiority over the German [Ashkenazic] kehillot of the country.”53\n\nThe first effort at establishing a reformed sanctuary reveals a different aspect of the Sephardic mystique. Outlining the principles that would guide his proposed Metz oratoire, Gerson-Lévy declared that the piyyutim were to be replaced by selections from the poetry of Solomon ibn Gabirol, Moses ibn Ezra, and Judah Halevi. The preference for the Spanish poets over the Ashkenazic authors of the piyyutim was explained as linguistically motivated: the Hebrew of the Spanish writers was clear and grammatically correct whereas the Ashkenazic piyyutim were virtually incomprehensible because of their grammatical flaws. It is likely that there was more to the issue of piyyutim than just language. Innovators viewed medieval Spanish Jewry as the quintessential expression of Jewish civilization; Ashkenazic culture, as exemplified by the piyyutim, was regarded as outdated, no longer relevant, and overly particularistic.54\n\nA second factor, the goal of unifying the Jews of France, provided the movement with a crucially important conceptual framework. Perhaps the most enduring feature of nineteenth-century French Jewish history, the quest for unity was marked by efforts to introduce uniform changes in synagogue worship, religious practice and education, and ultimately to create a Franco-Jewish identity. The inspiration for this objective derived from the uniquely French experience of emancipation, and was fostered by a devotion to the fatherland. French Jewry was undoubtedly swept up by the idea that a special destiny awaited France and her inhabitants. The goal of uniformity was no less a matter of tactical importance than of theoretical significance. Uniformity was widely regarded as essential to the success of régénération. As policymakers intent on regenerating their less fortunate coreligionists, members of the Paris “center” naturally tended to define “improvement” in their own terms and sought to dictate its specific patterns to far-off communities. Tensions over regionalism versus centralization, unity versus diversity, and tradition versus reform were thus the inevitable outgrowth of the search for a new Jewish identity in France.55\n\nThe ill-fated, but incessant, efforts of reformers to combine the Sephardic and Ashkenazic liturgies into a single rite offers an excellent example of the importance placed on uniformity as well as the persistence of the forces of diversity. In 1831 Sephardic leaders requested of the Paris Consistory an administrative fusion of the Ashkenazic synagogue and their own, and in the following year this became a reality. Though initially motivated by financial and administrative concerns, the notion of “fusion” soon assumed a new significance. Inspired by the coexistence of the two communities in Paris, Ashkenazic proponents of religious modernization introduced the idea of creating a combined liturgy that would signify the distinctive ritual of French Jewry and would thus serve as a much sought after instrument of unity. In time, the concept of fusion became an essential priority of the régénérateur movement. In fact, candidates for the position of Chief Rabbi in 1846 were expected to subscribe to the philosophical and practical aspects of the proposed liturgical innovation. Elaborate formulas were devised for the determination of which prayers and melodies should be selected from the two rites. For example the Sephardic melody for the reading of the Torah would be used throughout the year, while the Ashkenazic melody would be used on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. On the whole, the combined liturgy was to be based mainly on the Sephardic ritual. The idea eventually gained currency among several moderate rabbis, although it was vigorously opposed by Grand Rabbi Salomon Klein of Colmar.56\n\nIt is especially significant that the principal resistance to fusion came from the Sephardim themselves. The Sephardic community of Paris was unenthused about the prospects of a combined liturgy. In a pamphlet published in Paris in 1866, Sephardic leader Prosper Lunel cited the more obvious objections to fusion: significant differences in the liturgy and pronunciation of each group. Futhermore, he asserted that “the autonomy of the Portuguese synagogue has always existed, and it will [continue to] exist despite the hostile efforts of the consistory that reigns in 1866.” This last statement, as well as ongoing efforts to consolidate instruction of the Sephardic rite at the Bordeaux cantorial school,57 point to an unmistakable pride in the ethnic distinctiveness of the Sephardim. Consequently, the régénérateurs were thwarted in their efforts to establish a rite français. Inspired by the ambitious goal of unity, undoubtedly an echo of governmental efforts to impose centralization upon the Jewish communities of France, leaders of le mouvement régénérateur failed to achieve the much desired religious uniformity or the blurring of ethnic distinctions.\n\nThe persistence of regionalism, religious traditionalism, and ethnic loyalty was doubtless more powerful than the régénérateurs were aware. In the specific areas involving the transformation of time-honored behavioral patterns, régénération failed to attract much enthusiastic support, and indeed encountered stubborn resistance on frequent occasions. Nevertheless, for a growing number of intellectuals whose frame of reference remained the Jewish community, régénération was the only viable response to the formidable challenges to Jewish identity posed by nineteenth-century French culture. Régénération was understood to be an expression of the uniqueness of the emancipation of French Jewry: emancipation was believed to be unassailable precisely because it was a part of the cherished legacy of the Revolution. Moreover, this implied that the envisioned symbiosis of Judaism and French civilization was by no means merely an accommodation, but a sacred mission entrusted to the first Jewish population to have been shaped by the ideals of 1789. Despite differences over the scope, application, and implementation of reforms, the ideology of régénération continued to be viewed as the most reliable path toward the realization of that vision."
