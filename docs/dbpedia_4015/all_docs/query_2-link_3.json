        "text": "The new temporary exhibition on display at the Anne Frank House, explores the period when Germany was transformed from a democratic country into a dictatorship.\n\nThe Frank Family\n\nThe exhibition tells the story of the Frank family in Frankfurt against the backdrop of the economic, social and political problems in Germany. It begins with Anne Frank’s birth in Germany in 1929, spotlights the rise to power of Hitler and his antisemitic National Socialist German Workers’ Party (NSDAP), and ends with the Frank family’s emigration to the Netherlands in 1933.\n\nFrom democracy to dictatorship\n\nAt the core of the exhibition is the life of the Frank family in Frankfurt, around which the exhibition highlights troubling developments in the city and the country. Visitors see original Frank family photos, including a wedding chest, and are given explanations through photos, films and texts. The exhibition shows, illustrated by election posters and ballot papers, how German democracy turned into a dictatorship.\n\nLessons from the twentieth century\n\nHow can you resist the erosion of democracy and the rise of authoritarianism? Complementary to the exhibition, a short animation on this subject is on display. The animation is inspired by the book On Tyranny by Timothy Snyder. This American historian, specialised in the Holocaust, explains in a series of ‘lessons’ how resurgent authoritarian ideology can be resisted.\n\nBackground article: Germany 1933: From democracy to dictatorship"
