        "meta_description": "Abstract. This paper presents a modelling study on the fate of CHBr3 and its\nproduct gases in the troposphere within the context of tropical deep\nconvection. A cloud-scale case study was conducted along the west coast of\nBorneo, where several deep convective systems were triggered on the afternoon and\nearly evening of 19Â November 2011. These systems were sampled by the Falcon\naircraft during the field campaign of the SHIVA project and analysed using a\nsimulation with the cloud-resolving meteorological model C-CATT-BRAMS at 2Ã2âkm resolution that represents the emissions, transport by\nlarge-scale flow, convection, photochemistry, and washout of CHBr3\nand its product gases (PGs). We find that simulated CHBr3 mixing\nratios and the observed values in the boundary layer and the outflow of the\nconvective systems agree. However, the model underestimates the background\nCHBr3 mixing ratios in the upper troposphere, which suggests a\nmissing source at the regional scale. An analysis of the simulated chemical\nspeciation of bromine within and around each simulated convective system\nduring the mature convective stage reveals thatÂ >85â% of the\nbromine derived from CHBr3 and its PGs is transported vertically to\nthe point of convective detrainment in the form of CHBr3 and that\nthe remaining small fraction is in the form of organic PGs, principally\ninsoluble brominated carbonyls produced from the photo-oxidation of\nCHBr3. The model simulates that within the boundary layer and free\ntroposphere, the inorganic PGs are only present in soluble forms, i.e. HBr,\nHOBr, and BrONO2, and, consequently, within the convective clouds,\nthe inorganic PGs are almost entirely removed by wet scavenging. We find that\nHBr is the most abundant PG in background lower-tropospheric air and that this\nprevalence of HBr is a result of the relatively low background tropospheric\nozone levels at the regional scale. Contrary to a previous study in a\ndifferent environment, for the conditions in the simulation, the insoluble\nBr2 species is hardly formed within the convective systems and\ntherefore plays no significant role in the vertical transport of bromine. This\nlikely results from the relatively small quantities of simulated inorganic\nbromine involved, the presence of HBr in large excess compared to HOBr and\nBrO, and the relatively efficient removal of soluble compounds within the\nconvective column.",

        "text": "3.1âModel description\n\nWe use the Chemistry-Coupled Aerosol and Tracer Transport model to the Brazilian developments on the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (C-CATT-BRAMS) (Longo etÂ al., 2013), which is a version of the CATT-BRAMS model (Freitas etÂ al., 2009) coupled online with a chemistry model. This system is capable of resolving meteorological processes and the resultant tracer transport and chemistry. C-CATT-BRAMS has its original heritage in the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System version 6 (RAMS) (Walko etÂ al., 2000). RAMS is a fully compressible non-hydrostatic model consistent with Tripoli and Cotton (1982). RAMS can run in a nested grid configuration and includes various physical parameterisations to simulate sub-grid-scale meteorological processes for turbulence, shallow cumulus convection, deep convection, surfaceâair exchanges, cloud microphysics, and radiation. Note that for kilometre-scale simulations, convection is resolved explicitly, and thus sub-grid-scale convective parameterisations are not needed. BRAMS builds upon RAMS with the inclusion of several modifications that serve to improve the model performance within the tropics. For example, BRAMS includes an ensemble implementation of the deep and shallow cumulus convection schemes, a soil moisture initialisation using model prognostication combined with a remote sensing rainfall product, and more realistic surface characteristics for vegetation type derived from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) NDVI (normalised difference vegetation index) product (Freitas etÂ al., 2009).\n\nThe model represents microphysical processes using the single-moment bulk parameterisation (Walko etÂ al., 1995), whereby rain, cloud, pristine ice, snow, aggregates, graupel, and hail are considered. The radiation scheme used in the model calculates the effects of clouds, hydrometeors, and aerosols upon radiation (Toon etÂ al., 1989). The model considers turbulent mixing using the turbulent kinetic energy (mean kinetic energy per unit mass for eddies in turbulent flow) as a prognostic variable (Mellor and Yamada, 1982).\n\nThe chemistry scheme used in C-CATT-BRAMS simulates gas- and aqueous-phase chemistry, photochemistry, uptake described by Henry's law, and hydrolysis. MarÃ©cal etÂ al.Â (2012) and Krysztofiak etÂ al.Â (2012) provide a detailed overview of the equations describing the chemistry solved by the model. To summarise, the model calculates chemical loss and production rates, and it computes chemical species concentrations in the gas phase, in cloud particles, and in rain droplets. To this end, the chemistry scheme couples with the microphysical scheme which explicitly resolves cloud and precipitation processes (MarÃ©cal etÂ al., 2012). In practice, the model considers, within the bulk microphysical scheme, the effects on the chemical species of condensation, evaporation, water vapour deposition, and sedimentation. In addition, the reversible exchange of gases between the gas and aqueous phases (cloud and liquid hydrometeors) is estimated using Henry's law and accommodation constants. Once within the condensed phase, the model includes the transfer of chemical species from within cloud particles to the different types of hydrometeors during coalescence and riming and within the individual types of hydrometeor. In brief, it assumes Henry's law with cloud water and uses the production of precipitation to determine how much of the soluble trace gas is removed by wet deposition. We use retention coefficients to describe the proportion of a chemical compound that is retained in the condensed phase upon the transition from one type of hydrometeor to another. This approach represents liquid-to-ice processes like riming that are the dominant process for the formation of ice hydrometeors in convective clouds. We simplify the treatment of retention for the formation of ice precipitates by assuming a retention coefficient of 1 (i.e. the entirety of the compound) for all chemical species dissolved in liquid precipitate that undergo freezing. This is a frequently used assumption within washout schemes in global- and regional-scale chemical models. The uptake of bromine species onto ice hydrometeors is not represented as it was found in MarÃ©cal etÂ al.Â (2012) to not have an important effect on bromine removal.\n\nThe photolysis rates are computed online in the model using the Fast-TUV (Tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible) radiative model (Tie etÂ al., 2003). This is done in such a way as to consider the effects of clouds on photolysis rate in an interactive way.\n\nThe BrONO2 hydrolysis reaction within cloud particles and rain droplets has been added to the chemical scheme. Its mathematical implementation is described by MarÃ©cal etÂ al.Â (2012). The reaction scheme considers the reaction within cloud particles and rain droplets separately using the mean mass radius and mean mixing ratios for cloud particles and rain droplets from the bulk microphysical scheme, the thermal velocity, the gas-phase diffusivity, and the accommodation coefficient of BrONO2.\n\nNote that bromineâchlorine reactions have not been included in the chemistry scheme since MarÃ©cal etÂ al.Â (2012) showed that it has only a small impact on the production of Brx even under the most favourable conditions possible.\n\n4.1âMeteorology\n\nSimulations with limited area models with horizontal resolutions of the order of 1âkm, as in the present study, are largely used to study in detail the development of convective systems since they provide an explicit representation of their dynamical and thermodynamic processes. At this resolution, there is no need to use sub-grid-scale parameterisations for convection. But even at this fine resolution, modelling tropical deep convective systems remains a challenge when one wants to reproduce the exact time, intensity, and structure (extent of convective cloud component versus stratiform cloud component) compared to observations. This is particularly true in maritime conditions because of the uncertainties in the representation of hydrometeor properties and processes and because of their sensitivity to large-scale meteorological conditions (e.g. Varble etÂ al., 2014, and references therein). We do not attempt to make a detailed comparison of the model simulations with the particular convective systems sampled by the Falcon (Obs_Conv1 and Obs_Conv2). Instead, we now evaluate if the observed, general features of the development of the deep convective systems (described in Sect.Â 2 and Fig.Â 1) are well captured by the model.\n\nTo show the evolution of the modelled convective systems, we plot in Fig.Â 4 the model-derived brightness temperatures at 11âmm (IR108 channel wavelength) estimated from cloud top pressures from 05:00âUTC to 12:00âUTC on 19Â November 2011 using RTTOV v12.3 (Radiative Transfer for TOVS, https://nwpsaf.eu/site/software/rttov/, last access: 23Â June 2021, Saunders etÂ al., 2018). FigureÂ 4 shows that the model simulates three deep convective systems that develop during the afternoon. These systems (called hereafter Mod_Conv_4.35N, Mod_Conv_3.75N, and Mod_Conv_5.4N) can be identified and followed in time by coloured rectangles. Consistent with the observations, the analyses of the simulated meteorological fields show that all three systems are triggered inland close to the coast in the early afternoon from the large-scale low-level winds (north/north-westerlies) enhanced by local sea breeze that encounters the fairly steep topography of west Borneo (Fig.Â 2). This process is illustrated in Fig.Â 5a, which shows the simulated low-level wind direction and intensity at 06:00âUTC (14:00âLT, a time when convection is at an early stage) and the associated temperature field that exhibits a seaâland positive gradient. After 06:00âUTC the deep convective systems move offshore towards the west/north-west driven by the upper-tropospheric winds, and they develop an anvil from their outflow. Upper-tropospheric winds at 09:00âUTC (17:00âLT) are shown in Fig.Â 5b. Compared to the evolution of the observed brightness temperatures (Fig.Â 1), the vertical extension of the convective part of the systems during the mature stage tends to decrease a bit too rapidly in the model (Fig.Â 4), leading to a less extended anvil, likely due to a too rapid removal of precipitation related to uncertainties in the microphysical parameters. However, the values of brightness temperatures in the convective systems, which are a proxy of the cloud top height, are similar in the model and the observations, showing that the model provides a good estimate of the height of the convective systems that developed on the west coast of Borneo on the studied day.\n\nOther quantitative characteristics of the observed (Obs_Conv1, Obs_Conv2) and modelled (Mod_Conv_4.35N, Mod_Conv_3.75N, Mod_Conv_5.4N) convective systems are compared in TableÂ 2. For Obs_Conv1 and Obs_Conv2, we use the estimates of the observed cloud top heights derived from brightness temperatures (Hamada and Nishi, 2010; Iwasaki etÂ al., 2010) only where the uncertainty is â¼0.5âkm or lower. For the model, we use a set of cross sections from the 3D fields to estimate the model cloud tops. TableÂ 2 shows a general agreement on altitudes between the observations and the model. Regarding the timing, the two observed convective systems originating on the west coast of Borneo do not reach the upper troposphere at the same time (05:00âUTC for Obs_Conv1 and 07:00âUTC for Obs_Conv2), and the duration before they start to dissipate also varies (5âh for Obs_Conv1 and 4âh for Obs_Conv2). In the model, the three convective systems also show variations of these two parameters which are close to those observed. The time when convection first reaches the upper troposphere in the model is only off by 1âh maximum (08:00âUTC) compared to observations (07:00âUTC) and still occurs in the afternoon. Regarding the dissipation time, there is an uncertainty because two of the systems leave the model domain. However, the model simulates anvils that last at least 3âh before they start to dissipate.\n\nOverall, from collating the information from Figs.Â 1 and 4 and TableÂ 2, we find that the simulation represents the general characteristics of the observed convective systems well, in particular\n\nthe origin of their development from the interaction of the large-scale flow and the steep orography of the west coast of Borneo combined to local effects,\n\nthe location of the initial convective cell about 30âkm inland on the west coast of Borneo,\n\nthe development of an anvil (the stratiform part) from the convective outflow during the afternoon moves offshore,\n\nthe cloud top height of the outflow,\n\nthe transport of the convective systems north-westwards and westwards, and\n\nthe duration of the system of several hours and decay during early evening.\n\nThe main discrepancy is that the condensed water in the simulated convective part of the systems tends to precipitate a bit too efficiently compared to observations. Nevertheless, in its early stages, the convective part of the system, as evidenced by condensed water, reaches altitudes greater than 14.5âkm. Achieving this altitude gives a strong indication that the intensity of the main updraught transporting bromoform into the upper troposphere is predicted well by the model.\n\nIn conclusion, the model is able to simulate the general meteorology of the observed convective systems, at least within the constraints and uncertainties of kilometre-scale modelling of convection (Varble etÂ al., 2014).\n\nThe three convective systems we examine detrain into altitudes ranging between 11 and 15âkm. According to Corti etÂ al.Â (2005) and Corti etÂ al.Â (2006), the LZRH can be as low as 11âkm for air masses within ice clouds due to the effects of their radiative properties. Ice clouds are present in the anvils of all three of the simulated systems, and they could cause a shift in the radiative balance and sufficient heating to lower the altitude of the LZRH. This would imply that the simulated air masses could gain positive buoyancy sufficient to reach the stratosphere over long enough time and large enough spatial scales. Thus, the study of the chemistry and washout within these systems could have relevance for the transport of CHBr3 and its PGs to the stratosphere.\n\n4.2âComparison of the measured and modelled bromoform statistics and convective transport efficiency\n\nBefore discussing the results of the simulated chemistry in detail (Sect.Â 4.3), we evaluate if the simulation gives reasonable results for CHBr3 concentrations and for convective transport efficiency compared to the aircraft observations.\n\nWe firstly use statistical characteristics for this comparison. We choose this approach for two reasons. First, because of differences in location and timing between the observed and simulated convection events and, second, because of spatial uncertainties in the emission inventory used in the simulation. This approach allows a clearer comparison of the observations and simulation by removing effects arising from inherent temporal and spatial uncertainties.\n\nIn order to compare the convective transport efficiency between the observed and simulated systems, we follow the approach proposed by Cohan etÂ al.Â (1999) and used by Bertram etÂ al.Â (2007). To estimate the air fraction, f, originating from the boundary layer (BL) and transported by convection, we use the relationship from Cohan etÂ al.Â (1999):\n\n(1) [ X ] UTconv = f â [ X ] BL + ( 1 - f ) â [ X ] UTnoconv ,\n\nwhere the mean mixing ratios in the boundary layer, the upper troposphere within the convective systems, and the upper troposphere in the vicinity but outside the convective systems are represented by [X]BL, [X]UTconv, and [X]UTnoconv, respectively. f ranges from 0 to 1, with large values corresponding to an efficient convective transport of air masses from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere. This formulation of f is chosen because it was recently applied to the SHIVA aircraft data (Krysztofiak etÂ al., 2018). It relies on the assumption of a low variability of background concentrations with altitude, which is fulfilled for CHBr3 in our case study (not shown). Previous studies based on observations and reported in Krysztofiak etÂ al.Â (2018) provide estimates of f in the range 0.17 to 0.36.\n\nTableÂ 3 shows the modelled and observed mixing ratios of CHBr3 that are used to calculate the f fraction. The mixing ratios are divided into three subsets corresponding to the boundary layer ([X]BL), the upper troposphere within the convective systems ([X]UTconv), and in the upper troposphere in the vicinity but outside the convective systems ([X]UTnoconv). The details on how the estimates from the observations and from the model were determined are given in SupplementÂ S2.\n\nMod_Conv_4.35N and Mod_Conv_5.4N give values of the fraction of air transported by convection from the BL that are close to the estimates of f based on CHBr3 observations gathered on 19Â November 2011.\n\nA higher f fraction is calculated for Mod_Conv_3.75N, meaning that this system was more efficient for transport of CHBr3 from the BL to the UT. However, this high fraction f is consistent with the average value calculated from all SHIVA aircraft data (0.29Â±0.25) determined by Krysztofiak etÂ al.Â (2018) using carbon monoxide measurements from the SPIRIT instrument (Catoire etÂ al., 2017) and the GHOST CHBr3 measurements aboard the Falcon (Sala etÂ al., 2014). The GHOST instrument is a gas-chromatograph mass spectrometer and had an error of Â±17.7â% that was primarily driven by uncertainties in the gas standard (Sala etÂ al., 2014). TableÂ 3 shows an overall good consistency (both in terms of magnitude and simulated variability) between the model results, the findings of Krysztofiak etÂ al.Â (2018), and the SHIVA measurements concerning f. Furthermore, FuhlbrÃ¼gge etÂ al.Â (2016) used a trajectory model and found similar values of f at 10â13âkm of between 30â%â40â% for 19Â November for the west coast Borneo region. It is also worth noting that Mod_Conv_3.75N has a higher uncertainty and agrees with the fraction f of Obs_Conv1 and Obs_Conv2 within the combined uncertainties.\n\nWe now examine the magnitude of the CHBr3 mixing ratios in the BL and in the UT both inside and outside of the convection using TableÂ 3 and Fig.Â 6. The box-and-whisker plots in Fig.Â 6 giving the median (i.e. 50th percentile) and the 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th percentiles provide complementary statistical information to TableÂ 3 on the variability of the observed and simulated CHBr3 mixing ratios. Differences between the median and the mean are a measure of the skewness of the distribution of points. The 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th percentiles give additional information characterising the low and high values of the distribution of the bromoform mixing ratios.\n\nIn the BL, there is a large spread in the observations because of the very large local variability of the emissions that the model cannot capture due the resolution of the CHBr3 emission inventory we used. Nevertheless, the median BL mixing ratios of all three lie within the 25th and 75th percentile of the observed BL mixing ratios, and the 5thâ95th percentile range of simulated mixing ratios across all three simulated systems lies within the 5thâ95th percentile range of observed mixing ratios in the BL. In the BL, the Mod_Conv_4.35N mean and median mixing ratios are higher compared (see Fig.Â 6 and TableÂ 3) to the observations. Meanwhile, the mean and median mixing ratios in the BL below Mod_Conv_5.4N are a bit lower than that observed, and Mod_Conv_3.75N shows the lowest mean and median there (see TableÂ 3 and Fig.Â 6). This is likely related to two combined factors: the emissions are weaker in the southern part of Borneo's west coast where Mod_Conv_3.75N takes place (see Fig.Â 3), and Mod_Conv_4.35N initiates in closer proximity to the coast compared to the other two systems where CHBr3 emissions and BL mixing ratios are higher.\n\nThe mean and median UT mixing ratios in the simulation, which largely depend on the chemistry initial conditions from the TOMCAT simulation, are underestimated compared to observations, which leads to lower mixing ratios both within and out of the convection (differences of 0.17 to 0.22âpptv in UTnoconv, and of 0.11 to 0.17âpptv in UTconv). Hossaini etÂ al.Â (2013) previously showed a comparable 0.08âpptv average negative bias in TOMCAT relative to the SHIVA aircraft measurements of CHBr3 throughout the entire duration of the flight on the afternoon of 19Â November. TOMCAT's negative bias is slightly smaller than in our case because our sampling focuses on a smaller spatio-temporal domain (between 08:20âUTC and 09:40âUTC) in proximity to the convective system, whereas the TOMCAT negative biases were larger than the 0.08âpptv average for the full flight. The negative bias of the UT mixing ratios is probably linked to an underestimate in the emissions somewhere to the east of Borneo where these background UT air masses originate from in the TOMCAT simulation. This finding is consistent with FuhlbrÃ¼gge etÂ al.Â (2016), who showed that local sources alone cannot account for the observed CHBr3 levels in the UT. Furthermore, Keber etÂ al.Â (2020) indicate that underestimates in the background tropical UT might arise due to underestimates in extratropical CHBr3 sources.\n\nIn the background UT (UTnoconv), we see small differences in the mean and median mixing ratios in the vicinity of the three simulated convective systems, with slightly higher values and variability (see all percentiles in Fig.Â 6 and 1Ï in TableÂ 3) for Mod_Conv_3.75N and Mod_Conv_5.4N because they developed in locations previously affected by convective transport of bromoform.\n\nThe mean and median mixing ratios for all three systems are close with slightly higher values (see Fig.Â 6 and TableÂ 3) for Mod_Conv_4.35N due to higher BL concentrations and for Mod_Conv_3.75N due to its more efficient transport (highest f in TableÂ 3). Mod_Conv_4.35N shows the highest variability (see all percentiles in Fig.Â 6 and 1Ï in TableÂ 3) within convection (UTconv) and the lowest outside (UTnoconv), indicating that there is less mixing during the detrainment in the UT in this system.\n\nNote that the results presented in this section have little sensitivity to the threshold in ice concentration used to define the sampling of grid points within the convection and outside in its vicinity (see SupplementÂ S4).\n\nAs a complement to the statistical comparison, Fig.Â 7 shows a spatial comparison. We choose Mod_Conv_5.4 for this comparison because it is the closest in time and space to Obs_Conv1. For the flight observations, we only select those gathered in the upper troposphere at â¼12â13âkm altitude range, which corresponds to the sampling of Obs_Conv1. We plot the modelled bromoform mixing ratio at 12.5âkm altitude. To account for the shift in time between the model and the observations, we plot the model fields at 10:00âUTC when the anvil is well developed over the ocean as in the observations around 09:00âUTC. The observations are also slightly shifted in space in order to match the Mod_Conv_5.4 location. In Fig.Â 7a we show the model bromoform mixing ratio and in Fig.Â 7b the same field but adding 0.17âpptv, which is the model bias in both UTconv and UTnoconv for Mod_Conv_5.4 with respect to the measurements. FigureÂ 7a illustrates well the model bias linked to the initial conditions. By removing this bias in Fig.Â 7b, we find a good consistency between the model and the observations. This confirms the findings of the statistical analysis.\n\nIn summary, this evaluation shows that the simulation provides reasonable results compared to observations for the transport efficiency and for CHBr3 concentrations knowing that the UT background values are underestimated in the initial conditions.\n\n4.3âCross-section analyses of the simulated chemical processes\n\nWe now briefly explain the underlying methodology used to interpret the model results (in the following Sects.Â 4.3.1â4.3.3) and to conclude whether the convective transport leads to an enhancement or deficit in the mixing ratios for CHBr3 and its PGs within the UT. The enhancements or deficits in the CHBr3 and PG mixing ratios in the convective column and UT that we report are based on comparisons of the simulated mixing ratios in each region of the atmosphere involved in the convective system, i.e. from BL to vertical component of convective system and to outflow. We use the simulated mass mixing ratios of condensed water as a metric to define what is within and what is outside of the convective systems and outflow. Mass mixing ratios of 0.5 and 0.01âgâkgâ1 are used to define the most intense and outer limits of the convection systems, respectively.\n\n4.3.1âBromoform\n\nIn this section, we analyse the cross sections of the simulated chemical fields of CHBr3 within the convective systems. As an illustration of how CHBr3 evolves during the convection, Fig.Â 8 shows a vertical cross section of the 5âh time evolution of CHBr3 mixing ratios in the central part of the Mod_Conv_5.4N system. The cross section is taken as close to the centreline of the convective system as possible. We selected Mod_Conv_5.4N since it corresponds most closely in space to Obs_Conv1. We can see the complete evolution of the convective system from a situation with elevated CHBr3 concentrations in the boundary layer close to the location of the convection (of up to 2.1âpptv) at the very early stage of the system (07:00âUTC, Fig.Â 8a). Then the convective column ascends in a relatively vertical fashion (08:00âUTC, Fig.Â 8b) and afterwards develops an anvil on its west side (from 09:00âUTC, Fig.Â 8câe). The concentrations in the anvil are naturally at their highest at the time and location of convective detrainment and reach up to 0.9âpptv at 09:00âUTC (17:00âLT) and begin to decrease after 1âh (up to 0.75âpptv) as the anvil is advected north-westward by the high-altitude winds.\n\nThe analysis of the transport, chemical processes, and Br-atom speciation done hereafter is based on vertical cross sections chosen in the central part of each convective system at the time when the anvil is in its mature stage; the precipitation and vertical transport within the convective column are also near their maximum at this stage. This means that these cross sections are representative of the most intense convective activity, which demonstrates the combined effects of intense vertical transport, washout, and development of the anvil. All of the numbers presented in the following sections correspond to those of the cross sections presented in the figures. Also, to be able to compare the contribution of the different bromine species to the total Br-atom mixing ratios, all the figures hereafter are expressed as Br-atom mixing ratios (henceforth known as pptv Br).\n\nWe show the concentrations of CHBr3 in the three convective systems in Fig.Â 9aâc and their percentage contribution to the total Br mixing ratio in Fig.Â 10aâc. Note that Fig.Â 9c is identical to Fig.Â 8c except scaled by the number of bromine atoms, i.e. a factor of 3. Each of the three simulated convective systems exhibits different CHBr3 mixing ratios within its convective columns and within its outflow anvils. This variability is because they each entrained different boundary layer mixing ratios of CHBr3, and they also detrained into UT regions with slightly differing CHBr3 backgrounds and have different transport efficiencies (TableÂ 3).\n\nDespite these variations, we see a consistent result in the Br-atom speciation and mixing ratios of each convective system in Figs.Â 9 and 10. CHBr3 is elevated above background levels in all of the atmospheric regions dynamically linked to the boundary layer (surface to 600â800âm height) on a timescale well below the lifetime of CHBr3 (i.e. the boundary layer, convective columns, and convective outflow). We can see that the CHBr3 in these air masses have only undergone limited photochemical ageing because CHBr3 accounts for >85â% of the total Br mixing ratio (Fig.Â 10aâc) in these atmospheric regions. However, we consistently see lower CHBr3 contributions to the total Br mixing ratio in atmospheric regions above the boundary layer not affected either directly or indirectly by convection. These regions include the low (from the top of the boundary layer to â¼2âkm height), middle (from â¼2âkm height to â¼8âkm), and upper troposphere (from â¼8âkm height to â¼13â14âkm), where the model typically simulates 0.45â0.9âpptv Br of CHBr3, accounting for 60â%â70â% of the total Br mixing ratio in the absence of convection to any vertical level. We can see some evidence of elevated CHBr3 in the upper troposphere related to the transport of outflow from distant convection, for instance in Fig.Â 9c at around 116.5ââE longitude and at 11 to 12âkm. Within these air masses the model simulates intermediate mixing ratios and Br-atom contributions signifying air masses of intermediate CHBr3 ageing and mixing. Note that the sharp changes in bromine mixing ratios that we see above 14âkm in Fig.Â 9 and onwards are due to the vertical transition into the tropical tropopause layer, which is influenced by the stratosphere, where we find 0â0.45âpptv Br of CHBr3, accounting for 15â%â20â% of the total simulated Br mixing ratio there.\n\n4.3.2âInorganic and organic PGs\n\nFigureÂ 9dâf show that there are relatively low levels of inorganic bromine (Br, Br2, BrO, HOBr, HBr, BrONO2) concentrations in the boundary layer even in the areas not directly affected by convective precipitation, with values typically in the range of 0 to 0.4âpptv Br, i.e. <5â% contribution to the total Br mixing ratio (Fig.Â 10dâf). The highest simulated inorganic bromine mixing ratios (0.3â0.4âpptv Br) in the boundary layer occur to the west of the Mod_Conv_5.4N system but still only contribute <10â% to the total boundary layer pptv Br (see Fig.Â 10f). This spatial variability in the boundary layer inorganic bromine mixing ratios around each convective system arises due to differences in precipitation location and timing over the course of the simulation prior to 19Â November 2011. Precipitation events occurring in the 2 preceding days deplete the boundary layer of inorganic bromine due to washout (analysis not shown). In the boundary layer, organic PGs (CHBrO, CBr2O, CHBr2OOH, and CBr3COOH) concentrations are up to 0.2âpptv Br (up to 10â% contribution to total bromine but very locally) and are formed due to CHBr3 photochemical loss (Figs.Â 9gâi and 10gâi).\n\nAir masses in the convective column itself and convective outflow are almost entirely depleted of inorganic bromine with mixing ratios of <0.1âpptv Br and with contributions to the total Br mixing ratio well below 5â%. There, organic compounds are being driven from the low levels up to the upper troposphere in the main ascent and the outflow and show enhanced mixing ratios within the convective column compared to the free troposphere (Fig.Â 9gâi). Still, organic PGs have a contribution to the total bromine only up to â¼4â%.\n\nIn the free troposphere, inorganic and organic bromine concentrations are enhanced between 1 and 4âkm to the west of each convective system (Figs.Â 9dâi and 10dâi). There, total inorganic (respectively organic) PGs peak up to 1âpptv Br (respectively 0.2âpptv Br), which constitutes a portion up to 45â% (respectively 5â%) of the total Br mixing ratio. Among the three convective systems, Mod_Conv_5.4N exhibits the highest concentrations of the organic PGs.\n\nAbove 4âkm altitude in convection-free areas, inorganic bromine is mainly in the 0.2â0.4âpptv Br range (15â%â35â% contribution to total Br) that is higher than within convection (Figs.Â 9dâf and 10dâf). There, organic PGs have low concentrations (0.02â0.03âpptv Br) and contribute only to 1â%â3â% (Figs.Â 9gâi and 10gâi).\n\n4.3.3âThe impact of PG solubility\n\nGiven that washout is an important process within the convective systems, the relative solubilities of each component we look at are relevant for explaining the concentration levels of the inorganic and organic PGs. TableÂ 1 shows the Henry law constants for the PGs. In order of increasing solubility, we first list the inorganic bromine PGs â BrO, Br, Br2, HOBr, HBr, and BrONO2 â and then the organic PGs â CHBrO, CBr2O, CHBr2OOH, and CBr3COOH. In discussions from this point on, we will classify the inorganic PGs into two groups: soluble inorganic that includes HOBr, HBr, and BrONO2; and insoluble inorganic, comprising Br, Br2, and BrO. We also classify the bromo-carbonyls (CHBrO and CBr2O) as insoluble organic and the bromo-methyl peroxides (CHBr2OOH and CBr3COOH) as soluble organic PGs. Note that, except for Br2, CHBr3 is less soluble than its PGs. The soluble inorganic, insoluble inorganic, soluble organic, and insoluble organic bromine compounds and their relative contributions are shown in Figs.Â 11 and 12.\n\nThe gas-phase mixing ratios of soluble inorganic bromine species are depleted to near zero in the convective columns and in the immediate area of detrainment for each system (Fig.Â 11aâc). Similarly, soluble inorganic species make almost no contribution to the total gas-phase Br within each convective system (Fig.Â 12aâc). This depletion of soluble inorganic bromine species occurs even though their boundary layer mixing ratios range between 0.1 and 0.5âpptv Br and the soluble inorganic species form the bulk of the inorganic bromine at all levels in the troposphere outside of convective systems. This strongly implies that the model simulates the near-total removal of the soluble inorganic bromine species within the convective columns. The insoluble inorganic species (Figs.Â 11dâf and 12dâf) only make a negligible contribution to the total bromine budget throughout the troposphere, only reaching peak mixing ratios of 0.1âpptv Br and 4â% of the total bromine in areas of the lower troposphere not affected by convection. We also see no enhancement of the insoluble inorganic species (which include Br2) within the convection column or in the fresh convective outflow above the levels seen in the rest of the troposphere. There is also only a negligible contribution of insoluble inorganic bromine in the UT affected by previous convection as illustrated in Fig.Â 12e and f (to the east of both Mod_Conv_3.75N and Mod_Conv_5.4N).\n\nThe contribution to the total Br mixing ratio from the soluble organic bromine PGs (Figs.Â 11gâi and 12gâi) is also negligible (at a maximum of â¼1â% in the low troposphere not affected by convection). The bulk of organic PG species are instead in the form of insoluble species (Figs.Â 11 and 12jâl). The enhancements of the organic PGs we see in Fig.Â 9gâi within the convective system are due to the insoluble bromo-carbonyls, i.e. up to 0.08âpptv compared to the background free troposphere 0.02âpptv (Figs.Â 11jâl and 12jâl). These compounds contribute a maximum of between 75â%â95â% of the PG bromine total within each of the three the convective columns, which is based on figures (not shown) of the relative contribution of the insoluble bromo-carbonyls to the total PG mixing ratio. We see across all three convective systems that the relative contribution of the insoluble bromo-carbonyls is at a maximum at the point PG mixing ratios are at a minimum. This indicates that these compounds survive complete washout during vertical ascent but play a small role in the vertical transport of bromine within the convection systems.\n\nIn order to understand further the behaviour of inorganic bromine we need to examine its composition. FiguresÂ 13 and 14 show HBr and HOBr mixing ratios and their percentage contribution to the total inorganic bromine. Inorganic bromine is almost entirely composed of HBr, HOBr, and BrONO2 within the background troposphere outside of the convective systems in our simulations. HBr dominates the inorganic Br-atom contribution in the regions of the UT outside of the convective systems (Fig.Â 13aâc). HBr provides between 40â%â65â% of the total Br mixing ratio in the regions of the low and mid-troposphere (1.5â4âkm height) unaffected directly by precipitation washout (Fig.Â 14aâc), while HOBr and BrONO2 represent small fractions (0â%â35â% and 0â%â20â%, respectively) of the remainder (Figs.Â 13dâf and 14dâf, BrONO2 not shown). The lower troposphere to mid-troposphere (1.5â4âkm) is the only tropospheric region where HOBr and BrONO2 have significant mixing ratios of up to 0.3 and 0.25âpptv. Otherwise, HBr dominates the total inorganic Br mixing ratio in the BL and UT. Note that the very high HOBr and HBr relative contributions of up to 100â% within the most active part of the convective systems shown in Fig.Â 14dâf are not meaningful since the total inorganic bromine mixing ratios are negligible there.\n\n4.3.4âDiscussion\n\nWe now present a discussion of the most important processes that control the overall speciation of the PGs in the background lower troposphere unaffected by convection in our simulation. This is important because this speciation determines the starting mix of chemical compounds present in the surrounding environment prior to convection and then ultimately what is available for entrainment into the convective system. The speciation of PGs in the lower troposphere is relevant for determining their potential transport to the upper troposphere since they individually have different solubilities.\n\nA key finding is that inorganic bromine dominates the PG budget within the background lower troposphere during this case study. However, during convective transport the inorganic PGs present in the low-tropospheric background air are almost entirely removed by washout since HBr is by far its most prevalent component in the marine boundary layer, and the next two most abundant inorganic PGs (HOBr and BrONO2) are also highly soluble. The regional tropospheric composition present in our simulations is the underlying cause of this prevalence of HBr, and this in turn causes the efficient washout of inorganic PGs.\n\nTableÂ 4 shows an example built from mixing ratios at a point in the marine boundary layer at 200âm altitude in proximity to Mod_Conv_5.4N and gives an indication of the relative reaction rates for these conditions. Mixing ratios at this location are selected because the marine boundary layer air masses are those that are entrained within the convective systems and are therefore most relevant. Note that the relative rates give an indicator of the preferred reaction for a particular species, e.g. for bromine atoms between ReactionsÂ (R1), (R2), and (R3) shown below. However, the calculated rates cannot be used to quantitatively compare the production and loss of a compound, e.g. production and loss of BrO, because they only give an instantaneous approximate estimate of the rates for single reactions within the complex chemical system solved by the numerical solver.\n\nWithin the photochemical scheme of C-CATT-BRAMS, bromine atoms can react in the gas phase in one of three ways via ReactionsÂ (R1), (R2), or (R3) (shown in order of decreasing reaction rate).\n\n(R1)Br+O3âBrO+O2(R2)Br+HCHOâHBr(R3)Br+HO2âHBr\n\nBromine radicals can react with ozone via ReactionÂ (R1) to form BrO, which is normally the dominant reaction pathway for Br in the troposphere, and this is the case here too. In addition, bromine radicals can react with HCHO or HO2 to form HBr, but combined the rate of HBr formation via ReactionsÂ (R2) and (R3) is less than a third of the production rate of BrO. However, under relatively low ozone conditions (13.1âppbv in this example) and in the presence of relatively high HO2 (37.2âpptv) and only low NOx levels (e.g. 4.6âpptv of NO2 and 0.6âpptv of NO), as we find in our simulations, the reactions between BrO and (in order of decreasing importance) HO2 (ReactionÂ R4), NO2 (ReactionÂ R5), and NO (ReactionÂ R6) are enough to suppress BrO mixing ratios to only negligible levels.\n\n(R4)BrO+HO2âHOBr(R5)BrO+NO2âBrONO2(R6)BrO+NOâBr+NO2\n\nCombined ReactionsÂ (R4)â(R6) suppress boundary layer BrO mixing ratios down to very low levels (0.5âppqv) within this example air mass during the daytime. During the night BrO production will shut off, and residual NO as well as NO2 react with BrO, resulting in the latter's complete removal.\n\nReactionÂ (R4) leads directly to modest HOBr formation. ReactionÂ (R5) leads to BrONO2 formation, but its mixing ratios are also kept low by photolysis in combination with hydrolysis within cloud and rain droplets.\n\n(R7)BrONO2+hÎ½âBr+NO3(R8)BrONO2(aq)âHOBr(g)+HNO3(g)\n\nThe hydrolysis of aqueous-phase BrONO2 ReactionÂ (R8) is another pathway leading to HOBr formation, which is dependent on the presence of condensed moisture (note that for numerical reasons, in the model, the HOBr and HNO3 from ReactionÂ R8 are produced in the model in the gas phase as their partitioning into the aqueous phase is determined by Henry's law and airâliquid diffusion limited uptake). However, despite modest formation rates of HOBr via ReactionsÂ (R4) and (R8), the mixing ratios of HOBr are suppressed to relatively low levels during daytime by photolysis.\n\n(R9) HOBr + h Î½ â Br + OH\n\nMeanwhile, HBr (formed by ReactionsÂ R2 and R3, albeit relatively slowly) only has a very slow rate of photolysis, and it is thus the single inorganic bromine compound with a lifetime long enough to allow accumulation in the gas phase under these conditions. HOBr and BrONO2 are the next most abundant inorganic PGs, but their lifetimes (â¼10 and â¼20âmin, respectively) are kept low during the daytime by photolysis. If background ozone levels were higher it would allow greater formation rates of BrO and in turn HOBr and BrONO2 since BrO is the start point in the reaction pathways for both species.\n\nThe maritime continent has been noted previously for having low O3 levels throughout the depth of the troposphere during the winter monsoon resulting from westward transport of moist tropical air across the equatorial Pacific (Rex etÂ al., 2014). The relatively low ozone levels are reproduced in our simulations (daytime values of as low as 10â15âppbv at 2âkm) and arise from the same mechanism across the equatorial Pacific represented in the TOMCAT global model forcing.\n\nThe low levels of BrO have another implication. Since BrO is directly involved in the two chemical pathways leading to HOBr formation (ReactionsÂ R4 and R8), the low levels of BrO can be implicated in the lack of significant quantities of HOBr (Figs.Â 13 and 14). HBr and HOBr react with one another in the aqueous phase to produce Br2 via ReactionÂ (R10) extremely rapidly.\n\n(R10) HOBr (aq) + Br ( aq ) - + H + â Br 2 ( aq ) + H 2 O\n\nSince this reaction has an effective stoichiometry of 1:1 (Brâ and H+ are both derived from HBr) and our model simulates that HBr is in a vast excess compared to HOBr in the gas phase in the troposphere, HOBr is the limiting reactant for Br2 formation. In the example in TableÂ 4, this excess is more than a factor of 103 in the gas phase and, after accounting for the difference in solubility, a factor of 109 in the aqueous phase. This leads to a relatively low reaction rate despite the speed of the reaction implied by the rate constant. At the levels shown in TableÂ 4 this equates to a lifetime of HOBr in solution of approximately 2Ã10-2 âs. This imbalance in the stoichiometry within the aqueous phase is simulated throughout the lower troposphere.\n\nThe atmospheric implication of ReactionÂ (R10) is that two soluble gases (HBr and HOBr) could potentially react rapidly within cloud and rain droplets to form the insoluble gas Br2. ReactionÂ (R10) is known to lead to the production and release of significant quantities of Br2 in other environments combining both the aqueous and gas phases, e.g. in the polar ice regions (McConnell etÂ al., 1992) and within volcanic plumes (Oppenheimer etÂ al., 2006). In these examples the gas-phase and aqueous-phase chemistry combine to form a feedback loop, leading to what is known as the âbromine explosionâ (Wennberg, 1999). Thus, ReactionÂ (R10) could have the potential to significantly alter the Br-atom speciation within convective clouds in a short time in such a way as to reduce the PGs' overall solubility; this would therefore promote the vertical transport of Br atoms within convective systems even in the presence of abundant falling hydrometeors that would otherwise wash out soluble gases like HBr very rapidly. FigureÂ 15 shows Br2 mixing ratios in Br pptv. In our simulation, only negligible levels of Br2 form during the most active phase of each of the simulated convective systems (Fig.Â 15aâc). At most we see up to 0.04âpptv of Br2 within Mod_Conv_5.4N (Fig.Â 15c), and this is only within the lowermost sections of the system, and these levels do not propagate vertically into the UT. These peaks in Br2 formation coincide with spatially limited regions with elevated HOBr resulting from slightly higher background levels of BrO at these points.\n\nFrom this analysis, we should expect more production of Br2 in convective systems in environments with higher levels of background ozone, which would consequently have more HOBr. Indeed, there may be some observational support for this in data collected during the CONTRAST field campaign. Chen etÂ al.Â (2016) showed that the observed levels of BrO and the sum of HOBr+Br2 were both below the limit of detection (0.6â1.3 and 1.5â3.5âpptv, respectively) in background tropical tropospheric air where ozone levels were relatively low (<50âppbv). They found that BrO and HOBr+Br2 were only above the limit of detection in biomass burning plumes where ozone levels were significantly elevated (>50âppbv). Their findings are at least consistent with our expectations of a link between ozone and the bromine speciation between HBr, BrO, HOBr, and Br2.\n\nThe residence time of cloud and rain droplets in the atmosphere can impact aqueous-phase chemistry in cloud and rain droplets. For other aqueous chemistry systems occurring in cloud and rain droplets, the rate of chemical reactions could occur slower than it takes for cloud or rain droplets to fall, leading to wet scavenging of the chemical species involved. Bela etÂ al.Â (2018) report an example of aqueous-phase chemistry in convective cloud and rain where the wet scavenging removal of H2O2 was found to be much faster than its production via aqueous-phase chemistry in cloud and rain. By contrast, the rate constant for ReactionÂ (R10) is approximately 107 times faster than the rate constants involved in the formation of H2O2 described by Bela etÂ al.Â (2018), and the lifetime of HOBr in solution is approximately 2Ã10-2 âs as a result. Thus, the residence time of cloud and rain droplets is not a limiting factor for ReactionÂ (R10).\n\n4.3.5âComparison with MarÃ©cal etÂ al.Â (2012)\n\nWhile other studies exist of convective-scale modelling of ozone and aerosols (Crumeyrolle etÂ al., 2008; Tulet etÂ al., 2002), MarÃ©cal etÂ al.Â (2012) is the only other study to have simulated the transport and photochemistry of bromoform at the convective scale, and so we therefore compare our findings with this study. The C-CATT-BRAMS model configuration in MarÃ©cal etÂ al.Â (2012) differs from the setup used in this study in the following ways.\n\nThe model domain was set to be at the same latitude and longitude as Darwin (Australia).\n\nThere were no emissions of CHBr3 or any other VSLS. The only source of CHBr3 was from a 2âkm homogenous layer above the surface set as an initial mixing ratio of either 1.6 or 40âpptv in the two scenarios.\n\nMarÃ©cal etÂ al.Â (2012) used a chemical mechanism that did not include a representation of non-methane hydrocarbon chemistry. This chemistry was added in this study by including the ReLACS chemical mechanism.\n\nApart from CHBr3 set in the lowermost 2âkm, the model initial and boundary conditions for the chemical species were defined from a single vertical profile from the MOCAGE CTM from over Darwin. The mixing ratios of all PGs were initialised at 0âpptv in all model grids and layers.\n\nThe meteorology in MarÃ©cal etÂ al.Â (2012) involved an initial setup that applied a single vertical profile of meteorological conditions throughout the entire horizontal domain. The vertical profile was defined from a radiosonde profile obtained above Darwin corresponding to November just prior to the main wet season. Convection was artificially forced in the simulation by introducing a perturbation in the lower model layers of increased temperature and humidity.\n\nMarÃ©cal etÂ al.Â (2012) showed in their analysis of the artificially induced tropical deep convective system that most of the Br transported to the UT by convection is in the form of CHBr3, which is consistent with the results here. Nevertheless, in their case using an initial CHBr3 of 1.6âpptv in the BL (which is the most comparable to this study), we can see notable differences in the composition of the convective outflow. Both organic and inorganic PGs are in higher abundance within the upper reaches of each convective system in this study compared to MarÃ©cal etÂ al.Â (2012). In particular, the mixing ratios of all the inorganic PGs are greatly increased by over a factor of 10 here compared to MarÃ©cal etÂ al.Â (2012). As a result, MarÃ©cal etÂ al.Â (2012) found a higher relative contribution to the total bromine PG mixing ratio in the UT for organic with respect to inorganic PGs, i.e. 86â% compared to 46â% in this present study. The background tropospheric air contains elevated HBr levels in our simulation (Figs.Â 13 and 14) resulting from photochemical ageing of convectively lofted CHBr3 represented both within the TOMCAT CTM initial and boundary conditions. It is likely that the major differences in simulated inorganic and organic PG mixing ratios within the convective system arise as a result of the idealised CHBr3 and PG background and initialisation used within MarÃ©cal etÂ al.Â (2012) compared to the more realistic simulation of the PG background (specifically HBr) in this study.\n\nThe small difference in latitude and atmospheric conditions between Darwin and Borneo is enough to cause longer CHBr3 lifetimes in our simulation with respect to both photolysis (15.2âd compared to â¼19âd here) and OH (22.6âd compared to 52.6âd here). Overall, both processes contribute to an increase in CHBr3 lifetime from 9 to â¼14âd here (note both are fully consistent with the compiled ranges from Burkholder etÂ al., 2018). The CHBr3 lifetimes with respect to photolysis and OH are important for defining the relative partitioning of bromine between CHBr3 and its different PGs prior to the convective activity on 19Â November. The relative importance of photolysis has therefore increased in this study due to these changes, which could lead to an increase in the relative formation rates of inorganic bromine PGs compared to the organic PGs. This occurs because the photolysis of bromine cleaves off single bromine radicals that then contribute directly to the inorganic PG budget. Furthermore, the remaining organic PGs contain one fewer bromine atom as a result. Meanwhile, reaction with OH leads to the abstraction of a hydrogen atom, which creates organic PGs containing either two or three bromine atoms. Given the idealised initialisation and experimental design within MarÃ©cal etÂ al.Â (2012), it is not possible to properly assess these conjectures here, but it would be of interest to evaluate more formally differences in PG speciation arising in different photochemical environments that display differences in the CHBr3 lifetime with respect to reaction with OH and to photolysis.\n\nMarÃ©cal etÂ al.Â (2012) showed that significant amounts of Br2 were only released into the gas phase from ReactionÂ (R8) in cloud droplets when their idealised simulation was initialised with very high CHBr3 (40âpptv) in the BL. In the more realistic case where boundary layer CHBr3 was â¼1.6âpptv, the formation and release of Br2 via ReactionÂ (R8) was very limited, which is consistent with our findings here as shown in Fig.Â 15. Following the causal link we identify between low ozone and resulting low HBr and HOBr, these similar results for Br2 could be explained by the low background O3 simulated over the two regions (Borneo and Darwin) in both studies. In MarÃ©cal etÂ al.Â (2012) the background O3 was 14âppbv at 2âkm as compared to the 10â15âppbv range simulated over the inner domain at 2âkm altitude in this study."
