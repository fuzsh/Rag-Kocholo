        "text": "Largest city in Hesse, Germany\n\nThis article is about the city in Hesse, Germany. For other uses, see Frankfurt (disambiguation).\n\nNot to be confused with Frankfort or Frankfurt (Oder).\n\nCity in Hesse, Germany\n\nFrankfurt am Main ( ; German: [ˈfʁaŋkfʊʁt ʔam ˈmaɪn] ⓘ;[5][6] lit. \"Frank ford on the[a] Main\") is the most populous city in the German state of Hesse. Its 773,068 inhabitants as of 2022 make it the fifth-most populous city in Germany.[b] Located in the foreland of the Taunus on its namesake Main, it forms a continuous conurbation with Offenbach am Main; its urban area has a population of over 2.7 million. The city is the heart of the larger Rhine-Main metropolitan region, which has a population of more than 5.8 million and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr region and the fourth biggest metropolitan region by GDP in the European Union. Frankfurt is home to the European Central Bank, one of the institutional seats of the European Union, while Frankfurt's central business district lies about 90 km (56 mi) northwest of the geographic center of the EU at Gadheim in Lower Franconia. Like France and Franconia, the city is named after the Franks. Frankfurt is the largest city in the Rhenish Franconian dialect area.\n\nFrankfurt was a city state, the Free City of Frankfurt, for nearly five centuries, and was one of the most important cities of the Holy Roman Empire, as a site of Imperial coronations; it lost its sovereignty upon the collapse of the empire in 1806, regained it in 1815 and then lost it again in 1866, when it was annexed (though neutral) by the Kingdom of Prussia. It has been part of the state of Hesse since 1945. Frankfurt is culturally, ethnically and religiously diverse, with half of its population, and a majority of its young people, having a migrant background. A quarter of the population consists of foreign nationals, including many expatriates. In 2015, Frankfurt was home to 1,909 ultra high-net-worth individuals, the sixth-highest number of any city. As of 2023, Frankfurt is the 13th-wealthiest city in the world and the second-wealthiest city in Europe (after London).[7]\n\nFrankfurt is a global hub for commerce, culture, education, tourism and transportation, and is the site of many global and European corporate headquarters. Due to its central location in the former West Germany, Frankfurt Airport became the busiest in Germany, one of the busiest in the world, the airport with the most direct routes in the world, and the primary hub for Lufthansa, the national airline of Germany and Europe's largest airline. Frankfurt Central Station is Germany's second-busiest railway station after Hamburg Hbf, and Frankfurter Kreuz is the most-heavily used interchange in the EU. Frankfurt is one of the major financial centers of the European continent, with the headquarters of the European Central Bank, Deutsche Bundesbank, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, Deutsche Bank, DZ Bank, KfW, Commerzbank, DekaBank, Helaba, several cloud and fintech startups, and other institutes. Automotive, technology and research, services, consulting, media and creative industries complement the economic base. Frankfurt's DE-CIX is the world's largest internet exchange point. Messe Frankfurt is one of the world's largest trade fairs. Major fairs include the Music Fair and the Frankfurt Book Fair, the world's largest book fair. With 108 consulates, among which the largest is the US Consulate General, Frankfurt is second to New York City among non-capital cities in regards to consulate seats.\n\nFrankfurt is home to influential educational institutions, including the Goethe University with the Universitätsklinikum Frankfurt (de) (Hesse's largest hospital), the FUAS, the FUMPA, and graduate schools like the FSFM. The city is one of two seats of the German National Library (alongside Leipzig), the largest library in the German-speaking countries and one of the largest in the world. Its renowned cultural venues include the concert hall Alte Oper, continental Europe's largest English theater and many museums, 26 of which line up along the Museum Embankment, including the Städel, the Liebieghaus, the German Film Museum (de), the Senckenberg Natural Museum, the Goethe House and the Schirn art venue. Frankfurt's skyline is shaped by some of Europe's tallest skyscrapers, which has led to the term Mainhattan. The city has many notable green areas and parks, including the Wallanlagen, Volkspark Niddatal, Grüneburgpark, the City Forest, two major botanical gardens (the Palmengarten and the Botanical Garden Frankfurt) and the Frankfurt Zoo. Frankfurt is the seat of the German Football Association (Deutscher Fußball-Bund – DFB), is home to the first division association football club Eintracht Frankfurt, the Löwen Frankfurt ice hockey team, and the basketball club Frankfurt Skyliners, and is the venue of the Frankfurt Marathon and the Ironman Germany.\n\nDistinctions\n\n[edit]\n\nFrankfurt is the largest financial hub in continental Europe. It is home to the European Central Bank, Deutsche Bundesbank, Frankfurt Stock Exchange and several large commercial banks.\n\nThe Frankfurt Stock Exchange is one of the world's largest stock exchanges by market capitalization and accounts for more than 90 percent of the turnover in the German market.\n\nIn 2010, 63 national and 152 international banks had their registered offices in Frankfurt, including Germany's major banks, notably Deutsche Bank, DZ Bank, KfW, Deka Bank and Commerzbank, as well as 41 representative offices of international banks.[8]\n\nFrankfurt is considered a global city (alpha world city) as listed by the GaWC group's 2012 inventory.[9] Among global cities it was ranked tenth by the Global Power City Index 2011 and 11th by the Global City Competitiveness Index 2012[broken anchor]. Among financial hubs, the city was ranked eighth by the International Financial Centers Development Index 2013 and ninth in the 2013 Global Financial Centres Index.\n\nIts central location in Germany and Europe makes Frankfurt a major air, rail, and road transport hub. Frankfurt Airport is one of the world's busiest international airports by passenger traffic and the main hub for Germany's flag carrier Lufthansa. Frankfurt Central Station is one of the largest rail stations in Europe and the busiest junction operated by Deutsche Bahn, the German national railway company, with 342 trains a day to domestic and European destinations.[10] Frankfurter Kreuz, also known as the Autobahn interchange and located close to the airport, is the most-heavily used interchange in the EU, used by 320,000 cars daily.[11] In 2011 human-resource-consulting firm Mercer ranked Frankfurt as seventh in its annual 'Quality of Living' survey of cities around the world.[12] According to The Economist cost-of-living survey, Frankfurt is Germany's most expensive city and the world's tenth most expensive.[13]\n\nFrankfurt has many downtown high-rise buildings that form its renowned Frankfurt skyline. In fact, it is one of the few cities in the European Union (EU) to have such a skyline, which is why Germans sometimes refer to Frankfurt as Mainhattan, combining the local river Main and \"Manhattan\". The other well-known nickname is Bankfurt. Before World War II, the city was noted for its unique old town, the largest timber-framed old town in Europe. The Römer area was later rebuilt and is popular with visitors and for events such as Frankfurt Christmas Market. Other parts of the old town were reconstructed as part of the Dom-Römer Project from 2012 to 2018.\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nFrankonovurd (in Old High German) or Vadum Francorum (in Latin) were the first names mentioned in written records from 794. It transformed to Frankenfort during the Middle Ages and then to Franckfort and Franckfurth in the modern era. According to historian David Gans, the city was named c. 146 AD by its builder, a Frankish king named Zuna, who ruled over the province then known as Sicambri. He hoped thereby to perpetuate the name of his lineage.[14] This is chronologically incompatible, however, with the archaeologically demonstrated Roman occupation of the area around Nida fortress in modern Heddernheim. The name is derived from the Franconofurd of the Germanic tribe of the Franks; Furt (cf. English ford) where the river was shallow enough to be crossed on foot.\n\nBy the 19th century, the name Frankfurt had been established as the official spelling. The older English spelling of Frankfort is now rarely seen in reference to Frankfurt am Main, although more than a dozen other towns and cities, mainly in the United States, use this spelling, including Frankfort, Kentucky, Frankfort, New York, and Frankfort, Illinois. The New York Times first used the Frankfurt spelling for Frankfurt am Main on 24 October 1953 and last used the Frankfort spelling on 10 June 1954.\n\nThe suffix am Main has been used regularly since the 14th century. In English, the city's full name of Frankfurt am Main means \"Frankfurt on the Main\" (pronounced like English mine or German mein). Frankfurt is located on an ancient ford (German: Furt) on the river Main. As a part of early Franconia, the inhabitants were the early Franks, thus the city's name reveals its legacy as \"the ford of the Franks on the Main\".[15]\n\nAmong English speakers, the city is commonly known simply as Frankfurt, but Germans occasionally call it by its full name to distinguish it from the other (significantly smaller) German city of Frankfurt an der Oder in the Land of Brandenburg on the Polish border.\n\nThe city district Bonames has a name probably dating back to Roman times, thought to be derived from bona me(n)sa (good table).\n\nThe common abbreviations for the city, primarily used in railway services and on road signs, are Frankfurt (Main), Frankfurt (M), Frankfurt a. M., Frankfurt/Main or Frankfurt/M. The common abbreviation for the name of the city is \"FFM\". Also in use is \"FRA\", the IATA code for Frankfurt Airport.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Frankfurt.\n\nEarly history and Holy Roman Empire\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the western borders of Frankfurt lies the Kapellenberg as part of the Taunus with one of the first Stone Age cities in Europe.[16] The Celts had different settlements in the Taunus mountains north of Frankfurt, the biggest one the Heidetrank Oppidum. The first traces of Roman settlements established in the area of the river Nidda date to the reign of Emperor Vespasian in the years 69 to 79 AD. Nida (modern Heddernheim, Praunheim) was a Roman civitas capital (Civitas Taunensium).\n\nAlemanni and Franks lived there, and by 794, Charlemagne presided over an imperial assembly and church synod, at which Franconofurd (alternative spellings end with -furt and -vurd) was first mentioned. It was one of the two capitals of Charlemagne's grandson Louis the German, together with Regensburg. Louis founded the collegiate church, rededicated in 1239 to Bartholomew the Apostle and now Frankfurt Cathedral.[17]\n\nFrankfurt was one of the most important cities in the Holy Roman Empire. From 855, the German kings were elected and crowned in Aachen. From 1562, the kings and emperors were crowned and elected in Frankfurt, initiated for Maximilian II. This tradition ended in 1792, when Francis II was elected. His coronation was deliberately held on Bastille Day, 14 July, the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. The elections and coronations took place in St. Bartholomäus Cathedral, known as the Kaiserdom (Emperor's Cathedral), or its predecessors.\n\nThe Frankfurter Messe ('Frankfurt Trade Fair') was first mentioned in 1150. In 1240, Emperor Frederick II granted an imperial privilege to its visitors, meaning they would be protected by the empire. The fair became particularly important when similar fairs in French Beaucaire lost attraction around 1380. Book trade fairs began in 1478.\n\nIn 1372, Frankfurt became a Reichsstadt (Imperial Free City), i.e., directly subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor and not to a regional ruler or a local nobleman.\n\nIn 1585, Frankfurt traders established a system of exchange rates for the various currencies that were circulating to prevent cheating and extortion. Therein lay the early roots for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.\n\nFrankfurt managed to remain neutral during the Thirty Years' War, but suffered from the bubonic plague that refugees brought to the city. After the war, Frankfurt regained its wealth. In the late 1770s the theater principal Abel Seyler was based in Frankfurt, and established the city's theatrical life.[18]\n\nFrankfurt in 1612\n\nFrankfurt in 1872\n\nKaiserplatz, c. 1880\n\nImpact of French revolution and the Napoleonic Wars\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the French Revolution, Frankfurt was occupied or bombarded several times by French troops. It remained a Free city until the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1805/6. In 1806, it became part of the principality of Aschaffenburg under the Fürstprimas (Prince-Primate), Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg. This meant that Frankfurt was incorporated into the Confederation of the Rhine. In 1810, Dalberg adopted the title of a Grand Duke of Frankfurt. Napoleon intended to make his adopted son Eugène de Beauharnais, already Prince de Venise (\"prince of Venice\", a newly established primogeniture in Italy), Grand Duke of Frankfurt after Dalberg's death (since the latter as a Catholic bishop had no legitimate heirs). The Grand Duchy remained a short episode lasting from 1810 to 1813 when the military tide turned in favor of the Anglo-Prussian-led allies that overturned the Napoleonic order. Dalberg abdicated in favor of Eugène de Beauharnais, which of course was only a symbolic action, as the latter effectively never ruled after the ruin of the French armies and Frankfurt's takeover by the allies.\n\nFrankfurt as a fully sovereign state\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter Napoleon's final defeat and abdication, the Congress of Vienna (1814–1815) dissolved the grand-duchy and Frankfurt became a fully sovereign city-state with a republican form of government. Frankfurt entered the newly founded German Confederation (till 1866) as a free city, becoming the seat of its Bundestag, the confederal parliament where the nominally presiding Habsburg Emperor of Austria was represented by an Austrian \"presidential envoy\".\n\nAfter the ill-fated revolution of 1848, Frankfurt was the seat of the first democratically elected German parliament, the Frankfurt Parliament, which met in the Frankfurter Paulskirche (St. Paul's Church) and was opened on 18 May 1848. In the year of its existence, the assembly developed a common constitution for a unified Germany, with the Prussian king as its monarch. The institution failed in 1849 when the Prussian king, Frederick William IV, declared that he would not accept \"a crown from the gutter\".\n\nFrankfurt after the loss of sovereignty\n\n[edit]\n\nFrankfurt lost its independence after the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 when Prussia annexed several smaller states, among them the Free City of Frankfurt. The Prussian administration incorporated Frankfurt into its province of Hesse-Nassau. The Prussian occupation and annexation were perceived as a great injustice in Frankfurt, which retained its distinct western European, urban and cosmopolitan character. The formerly independent towns of Bornheim and Bockenheim were incorporated in 1890.\n\nIn 1914, the citizens founded the University of Frankfurt, later named Goethe University Frankfurt. This marked the only civic foundation of a university in Germany; today it is one of Germany's largest.\n\nFrom 6 April to 17 May 1920, following military intervention to put down the Ruhr uprising, Frankfurt was occupied by French troops.[19] The French claimed that Articles 42 to 44 of the peace treaty of Versailles concerning the demilitarization of the Rhineland had been broken.[20] In 1924, Ludwig Landmann became the first Jewish mayor of the city, and led a significant expansion during the following years. During the Nazi era, the synagogues of the city were destroyed and the vast majority of the Jewish population fled or was killed.[21]\n\nDuring World War II, Frankfurt was the location of a Nazi prison for underage girls with several forced labour camps,[22] a camp for Sinti and Romani people (see Romani Holocaust),[23] the Dulag Luft West transit camp for Allied prisoners of war,[24] and a subcamp of the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp.[25]\n\nFrankfurt was severely bombed in World War II (1939–1945). About 5,500 residents were killed during the raids, and the once-famous medieval city center, by that time one the largest in Germany, was almost completely destroyed. It became a ground battlefield on 26 March 1945, when the Allied advance into Germany was forced to take the city in contested urban combat that included a river assault. The 5th Infantry Division and the 6th Armored Division of the United States Army captured Frankfurt after several days of intense fighting, and it was declared largely secure on 29 March 1945.[26] Frankfurt consists to over 40% of buildings from before World War II, besides all destruction.[27]\n\nAfter the end of the war, Frankfurt became a part of the newly founded state of Hesse, consisting of the old Hesse-(Darmstadt) and the Prussian Hesse provinces. The city was part of the American Zone of Occupation of Germany. The Military Governor for the United States Zone (1945–1949) and the United States High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG) (1949–1952) had their headquarters in the IG Farben Building, intentionally left undamaged by the Allies' wartime bombardment.\n\nFrankfurt was the original choice for the provisional capital city of the newly founded state of West Germany in 1949. The city constructed a parliament building that was never used for its intended purpose (it housed the radio studios of Hessischer Rundfunk). In the end, Konrad Adenauer, the first postwar Chancellor, preferred the town of Bonn, for the most part because it was close to his hometown, but also because many other prominent politicians opposed the choice of Frankfurt out of concern that Frankfurt would be accepted as the permanent capital, thereby weakening the West German population's support for a reunification with East Germany and the eventual return of the capital to Berlin.\n\nPostwar reconstruction took place in a sometimes simple modern style, thus changing Frankfurt's architectural face. A few landmark buildings were reconstructed historically, albeit in a simplified manner (e.g., Römer, St. Paul's Church, and Goethe House). The collection of historically significant Cairo Genizah documents of the Municipal Library was destroyed by the bombing. According to Arabist and Genizah scholar S.D. Goitein, \"not even handlists indicating its contents have survived.\"[28]\n\nThe end of the war marked Frankfurt's comeback as Germany's leading financial hub, mainly because Berlin, now a city divided into four sectors, could no longer rival it. In 1948, the Allies founded the Bank deutscher Länder, the forerunner of Deutsche Bundesbank. Following this decision, more financial institutions were re-established, e.g. Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank. In the 1950s, Frankfurt Stock Exchange regained its position as the country's leading stock exchange.\n\nFrankfurt also reemerged as Germany's transportation hub and Frankfurt Airport became Europe's second-busiest airport behind London Heathrow Airport in 1961.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the city created one of Europe's most efficient underground transportation systems.[29] That system includes a suburban rail system (S-Bahn) linking outlying communities with the city center, and a deep underground light rail system with smaller coaches (U-Bahn) also capable of travelling above ground on rails.\n\nIn 1998, the European Central Bank was founded in Frankfurt, followed by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and European Systemic Risk Board in 2011.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nFrankfurt is the largest city in the state of Hesse in the western part of Germany.\n\nSite\n\n[edit]\n\nFrankfurt is located on both sides of the river Main, south-east of the Taunus mountain range. The southern part of the city contains the Frankfurt City Forest, Germany's largest city forest. The city area is 248.31 km2 (95.87 sq mi) and extends over 23.4 km (14.54 mi) east to west and 23.3 km (14.48 mi) north to south. Its downtown is north of the river Main in Altstadt district (the historical center) and the surrounding Innenstadt district. The geographical center is in Bockenheim district near Frankfurt West station.\n\nFrankfurt at the heart of the densely populated Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region with a population of 5.5 million. Other important cities in the region are Wiesbaden (capital of Hesse), Mainz (capital of Rhineland-Palatinate), Darmstadt, Offenbach am Main, Hanau, Aschaffenburg, Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Rüsselsheim, Wetzlar and Marburg.\n\nDistricts\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is divided into 46 city districts (Stadtteile), which are in turn divided into 121 city boroughs (Stadtbezirke) and 448 electoral districts (Wahlbezirke). The 46 city districts combine into 16 area districts (Ortsbezirke), which each have a district committee and chairperson.\n\nThe largest city district by population and area is Sachsenhausen, while the smallest is Altstadt, Frankfurt's historical center. Three larger city districts (Sachsenhausen, Westend and Nordend) are divided for administrative purposes into a northern (-Nord) and a southern (-Süd) part, respectively a western (-West) and an eastern (-Ost) part, but are generally considered as one city district (which is why often only 43 city districts are mentioned, even on the city's official website).[30]\n\nSome larger housing areas are often falsely called city districts, even by locals, like Nordweststadt (part of Niederursel, Heddernheim and Praunheim), Goldstein (part of Schwanheim), Riedberg (part of Kalbach-Riedberg) and Europaviertel (part of Gallus). The Bankenviertel (banking district), Frankfurt's financial district, is also not an administrative city district (it covers parts of the western Innenstadt district, the southern Westend district and the eastern Bahnhofsviertel district).\n\nMany city districts are incorporated suburbs (Vororte) or were previously independent cities, such as Höchst. Some like Nordend and Westend arose during the rapid growth of the city in the Gründerzeit following the Unification of Germany, while others were formed from territory which previously belonged to other city district(s), such as Dornbusch and Riederwald.\n\nHistory of incorporations\n\n[edit]\n\nUntil the year 1877 the city's territory consisted of the present-day inner-city districts of Altstadt, Innenstadt, Bahnhofsviertel, Gutleutviertel, Gallus, Westend, Nordend, Ostend and Sachsenhausen.\n\nBornheim was part of an administrative district called Landkreis Frankfurt, before becoming part of the city on 1 January 1877, followed by Bockenheim on 1 April 1895. Seckbach, Niederrad and Oberrad followed on 1 July 1900. The Landkreis Frankfurt was finally dispersed on 1 April 1910, and therefore Berkersheim, Bonames, Eckenheim, Eschersheim, Ginnheim, Hausen, Heddernheim, Niederursel, Praunheim, Preungesheim and Rödelheim joined the city. In the same year a new city district, Riederwald, was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Seckbach and Ostend.\n\nOn 1 April 1928 the City of Höchst became part of Frankfurt, as well as its city districts Sindlingen, Unterliederbach and Zeilsheim. Simultaneously the Landkreis Höchst was dispersed with its member cities either joining Frankfurt (Fechenheim, Griesheim, Nied, Schwanheim, Sossenheim) or joining the newly established Landkreis of Main-Taunus-Kreis.\n\nDornbusch became a city district in 1946. It was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Eckenheim and Ginnheim.\n\nOn 1 August 1972, Hesse's smaller suburbs of Harheim, Kalbach, Nieder-Erlenbach, and Nieder-Eschbach became districts while other neighboring suburbs chose to join the Main-Taunus-Kreis, the Landkreis Offenbach, the Kreis Groß-Gerau, the Hochtaunuskreis, the Main-Kinzig-Kreis or the Wetteraukreis.\n\nBergen-Enkheim was the last suburb to become part of Frankfurt on 1 January 1977.\n\nFlughafen became an official city district in 1979. It covers the area of Frankfurt Airport that had belonged to Sachsenhausen and the neighboring city of Mörfelden-Walldorf.\n\nFrankfurt's youngest city district is Frankfurter Berg. It was part of Bonames until 1996.\n\nKalbach was officially renamed Kalbach-Riedberg in 2006 because of the large residential housing development in the area known as Riedberg.\n\nNeighboring districts and cities\n\n[edit]\n\nTo the west Frankfurt borders the administrative district (Landkreis) of Main-Taunus-Kreis with towns such as Hattersheim am Main, Kriftel, Hofheim am Taunus, Kelkheim, Liederbach am Taunus, Sulzbach, Schwalbach am Taunus and Eschborn; to the northwest the Hochtaunuskreis with Steinbach, Oberursel (Taunus) and Bad Homburg vor der Höhe; to the north the Wetteraukreis with Karben and Bad Vilbel; to the northeast the Main-Kinzig-Kreis with Niederdorfelden and Maintal; to the southeast the city of Offenbach am Main; to the south the Kreis Offenbach with Neu-Isenburg and to the southwest the Kreis Groß-Gerau with Mörfelden-Walldorf, Rüsselsheim and Kelsterbach.\n\nTogether with these towns (and some larger nearby towns, e.g., Hanau, Rodgau, Dreieich, Langen) Frankfurt forms a contiguous built-up urban area called Stadtregion Frankfurt which is not an official administrative district. The urban area had an estimated population of 2.3 million in 2010, and is the 13th-largest urban area in the EU.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nFrankfurt has a temperate-oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb). Its climate features cool winters with frequent rain showers and overcast skies, and warm to hot summers. The average annual temperature is 11.4 °C (52.5 °F), with monthly mean temperatures ranging from 2.7 °C (36.9 °F) in January to 20.7 °C (69.3 °F) in July. The descriptions below are based on climate data between 1991 and 2020.\n\nDue to its location at the northern tip of the Upper Rhine Valley in the Southwest of Germany, Frankfurt is one of the warmest and driest major German cities along with Darmstadt, Mannheim, Karlsruhe and Freiburg im Breisgau. Summers in Frankfurt can get quite hot when compared to the rest of the country. On average, it sees 62 days with a daily high temperature above 25 °C and 18 days with a high above 30 °C per year.\n\nClimate change is elevating the number of hot days. In the year of 2018, Frankfurt recorded 108 days with a maximum over 25 °C and 43 days with a high above 30 °C. This is compared to 52 and 13 days on average per year between 1981 and 2010. The overall tendency for higher temperatures can also be seen when comparing the climate data from 1981 to 2010 with the data from 2010 to 2020. Being an urban heat island, Frankfurt sometimes experiences tropical nights, where the temperature does not fall below 20 °C between May and September. This is exacerbated and made more frequent as the density of the city stores daytime heat overnight.\n\nThe growing season is longer when compared to the rest of Germany, thus resulting in an early arrival of springtime in the region, with trees typically leafing out already toward the end of March.\n\nWinters in Frankfurt are generally mild or at least not freezing with a small possibility of snow, especially in January and February but dark and often overcast. Frankfurt is, on average, covered with snow only for around 10 to 20 days per year.[31] The temperature falls below 0 °C on about 64 days and the daily maximum stays below freezing for about 10 days on average per year. Some days with lows under −10 °C can occur more often here than at the coasts of Northern Germany, but not as frequently as in Bavaria or the eastern parts of Germany.\n\nBecause of the mild climate in the region, there are some well-known wine regions in the vicinity such as Rhenish Hesse, Rheingau, Franconia (wine region) and Bergstraße (route). There is also a microclimate on the northern bank of the river Main which allows palms, fig trees, lemon trees and southern European plants to grow in that area. The area is called the \"Nizza\" (the German word for the southern French town Nice) and is one of the biggest parks with Mediterranean vegetation north of the Alps.[32]\n\nClimate data for Frankfurt Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Mean No. of days with Maximum temperature => 30.0 °C (86.0 °F) 0 0 0 0 0.5 3.3 6.5 5.4 0.7 0 0 0 16.4 Mean No. of days with Minimum temperature <= 0.0 °C (32.0 °F) 15.8 15 8.8 2.9 0.1 0 0 0 0 1.7 6.2 13.6 64.1 Mean No. of days with Maximum temperature <= 0.0 °C (32.0 °F) 4.6 2.2 0.1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.4 3 10.3 Mean No. of days with snow depth => 1 cm (0.39 in) 4.9 3.3 1.1 0.1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.6 3.3 13.3 Mean number of days with thunder 0.2 0.4 0.7 2.1 4.5 5.3 6.2 5.5 1.6 0.6 0.3 0.1 27.5 Mean number of days with hail 0 0 0 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.1 0 0 0 0 0.8 Mean number of days with fog 3 2.5 1.1 0.4 0.5 0.5 0.3 0.5 1.1 4.4 4.2 3.9 32.2 Number of days with no sunshine 19.9 15.4 14.1 9.9 11 8.8 9.3 7.7 11.1 15 19.2 21.7 163.1 Mean daily daylight hours 9.0 10.0 12.0 14.0 15.0 16.0 16.0 14.0 13.0 11.0 9.0 8.0 12.3 Average Ultraviolet index 1 1 3 4 6 7 7 6 5 3 1 1 3.5 Source 1: NOAA[34] Source 2: Weather Atlas[36]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nPopulation\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical populationYearPop.±%13879,600— 152010,000+4.2%175032,000+220.0%187191,040+184.5%1895229,279+151.8%1905334,978+46.1%1925467,520+39.6%1933555,857+18.9%1939553,464−0.4%1945357,737−35.4%1950532,037+48.7%1961685,682+28.9%1970669,635−2.3%1980629,375−6.0%1985595,348−5.4%1990644,865+8.3%1995650,055+0.8%2001641,076−1.4%2011667,925+4.2%2022743,268+11.3%Population size may be affected by changes in administrative divisions.\n\nLargest groups of foreign residents[37] Nationality Population (30 June 2022) Turkey 25,294 Croatia 16,751 Italy 15,120 Poland 12,174 Romania 10,451 Ukraine 9,748 Serbia 9,404 Bulgaria 8,509 India 7,612 Morocco 7,364 Spain 7,133 Greece 6,581 Bosnia and Herzegovina 6,342 Afghanistan 5,114 France 4,719 China 4,632 Algeria 4,087 Portugal 3,991 Japan 3,653 Eritrea 3,374\n\nWith a population of 763,380 (2019) within its administrative boundaries[38] and of 2,300,000 in the actual urban area,[39] Frankfurt is the fifth-largest city in Germany, after Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne. Central Frankfurt has been a Großstadt (a city with at least 100,000 residents by definition) since 1875. With 414,576 residents in 1910, it was the ninth largest city in Germany and the number of inhabitants grew to 553,464 before World War II. After the war, at the end of the year 1945, the number had dropped to 358,000. In the following years, the population grew again and reached an all-time-high of 691,257 in 1963. It dropped again to 592,411 in 1986 but has increased since then. According to the demographic forecasts for central Frankfurt, the city will have a population up to 813,000 within its administrative boundaries in 2035[40] and more than 2.5 million inhabitants in its urban area.\n\nAs of 2015, Frankfurt had 1909 ultra high-net-worth individuals, the sixth-highest number of any city in the world.[41] It is also the world's 14th-richest city by total wealth, as of 2017.[42]\n\nDuring the 1970s, the state government of Hesse wanted to expand the city's administrative boundaries to include the entire urban area. This would have made Frankfurt officially the second-largest city in Germany after Berlin with up to 3 million inhabitants.[43] However, because local authorities did not agree, the administrative territory is still much smaller than its actual urban area.\n\nMoroccan community\n\n[edit]\n\nFrankfurt has the largest Moroccan community in Germany, numbering about 8,000 people, and the Rhine-Main area has about 20,000. Many Moroccans came as guest workers in the 1970s. Today Frankfurt has many Moroccan restaurants, companies, shops, mosques and hamams. Due to the popularity of Moroccan culture in Frankfurt, it also led many people from the Maghreb and other African countries to move to Frankfurt. Famous singer Namika was born in Frankfurt to Moroccan parents.\n\nPopulation of the 46 city districts on 31 December 2009 No.\n\nCity district (Stadtteil)\n\nArea in km2[44]\n\nPopulation[45]\n\nForeign nationals[45]\n\nForeign nationals in %[45]\n\nArea district (Ortsbezirk) 01 Altstadt 0.51 3.475 1.122 32.3 01 – Innenstadt I 02 Innenstadt 1.52 6.577 2.529 38.5 01 – Innenstadt I 03 Bahnhofsviertel 0.53 2.125 810 38.1 01 – Innenstadt I 04 Westend-Süd 2.47 17.288 3.445 19.9 02 – Innenstadt II 05 Westend-Nord 1.67 8.854 2.184 24.7 02 – Innenstadt II 06 Nordend-West 3.07 28.808 5.162 17.9 03 – Innenstadt III 07 Nordend-Ost 1.69 26.619 5.580 21.0 03 – Innenstadt III 08 Ostend 5.40 26.955 7.213 26.8 04 – Bornheim/Ostend 09 Bornheim 2.66 27.184 6.240 23.0 04 – Bornheim/Ostend 10 Gutleutviertel 2.20 5.843 1.953 33.4 01 – Innenstadt I 11 Gallus 4.22 26.716 11.012 41.2 01 – Innenstadt I 12 Bockenheim 8.04 34.740 9.034 26.0 02 – Innenstadt II 13 Sachsenhausen-Nord 4.24 30.374 6.507 21.4 05 – Süd 14 Sachsenhausen-Süd 34.91 26.114 4.847 18.6 05 – Süd 15 Flughafen 20.00 211 14 6.6 05 – Süd 16 Oberrad 2.74 12.828 3.113 24.3 05 – Süd 17 Niederrad 2.93 22.954 6.569 28.6 05 – Süd 18 Schwanheim 17.73 20.162 3.532 17.5 06 – West 19 Griesheim 4.90 22.648 8.029 35.5 06 – West 20 Rödelheim 5.15 17.841 4.863 27.3 07 – Mitte-West 21 Hausen 1.26 7.178 2.135 29.7 07 – Mitte-West 22/23 Praunheim 4.55 15.761 3.197 20.3 07 – Mitte-West 24 Heddernheim 2.49 16.443 3.194 19.4 08 – Nord-West 25 Niederursel 7.22 16.394 3.671 22.4 08 – Nord-West 26 Ginnheim 2.73 16.444 4.024 24.5 09 – Mitte-Nord 27 Dornbusch 2.38 18.511 3.482 18.8 09 – Mitte-Nord 28 Eschersheim 3.34 14.808 2.657 17.9 09 – Mitte-Nord 29 Eckenheim 2.23 14.277 3.674 25.7 10 – Nord-Ost 30 Preungesheim 3.74 13.568 3.442 25.4 10 – Nord-Ost 31 Bonames 1.24 6.362 1.288 20.2 10 – Nord-Ost 32 Berkersheim 3.18 3.400 592 17.4 10 – Nord-Ost 33 Riederwald 1.04 4.911 1.142 23.3 11 – Ost 34 Seckbach 8.04 10.194 1.969 19.3 11 – Ost 35 Fechenheim 7.18 16.061 5.635 35.1 11 – Ost 36 Höchst 4.73 13.888 5.279 38.0 06 – West 37 Nied 3.82 17.829 5.224 29.3 06 – West 38 Sindlingen 3.98 9.032 2.076 23.0 06 – West 39 Zeilsheim 5.47 11.984 2.555 21.3 06 – West 40 Unterliederbach 5.85 14.350 3.511 24.5 06 – West 41 Sossenheim 5.97 15.853 4.235 26.7 06 – West 42 Nieder-Erlenbach 8.34 4.629 496 10.7 13 – Nieder-Erlenbach 43 Kalbach-Riedberg 6.90 8.482 1.279 15.1 12 – Kalbach-Riedberg 44 Harheim 5.02 4.294 446 10.4 14 – Harheim 45 Nieder-Eschbach 6.35 11.499 1.978 17.2 15 – Nieder-Eschbach 46 Bergen-Enkheim 12.54 17.954 2.764 15.4 16 – Bergen-Enkheim 47 Frankfurter Berg 2.16 7.149 1.715 24.0 10 – Nord-Ost Frankfurt am Main 248.33 679.571 165.418 24.3\n\nImmigration and foreign nationals\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to data from the city register of residents, 51.2% of the population had a migration background as of 2015, which means that a person or at least one of their parents was born with foreign citizenship. For the first time, a majority of the city residents had an at least part non-German background.[46] Moreover, three of four children in the city under the age of six had full or partial immigrant backgrounds,[47] and 27.7% of residents had a foreign citizenship.[48]\n\nAccording to statistics, 46.7% of immigrants in Frankfurt come from other countries in the EU; 24.5% come from European countries that are not part of the EU; 15.7% come from Asia (including Western Asia and South Asia); 7.3% come from Africa; 3.4% come from North America (including the Caribbean and Central America); 0.2% come from Australia and New Zealand; 2.3% come from South America; and 1.1% come from Pacific island nations. Because of this the city is often considered to be a multicultural city, and has been compared to New York City and London.[citation needed]\n\nReligion\n\n[edit]\n\nFrankfurt was historically a Protestant-dominated city. However, during the 19th century, an increasing number of Catholics moved to Frankfurt. As of 2013 , the largest Christian denominations were Catholicism (22.7% of the population) and Protestantism, especially Lutheranism (19.4%).[49]\n\nThe Jewish community has a history dating back to medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Germany. Over 7,200 inhabitants are affiliated with the Jewish community, making it the second largest in Germany after Berlin.[21] Frankfurt has four active synagogues.[50]\n\nDue to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s, Frankfurt has a large Muslim community, estimated at 12% in 2006.[51] According to calculations based on census data for 21 countries of origin, the number of Muslim migrants in Frankfurt amounted to about 84,000 in 2011, making up 12.6% of the population.[52] The most prevalent countries of origin were Turkey and Morocco. The Ahmadiyya Noor Mosque, constructed in 1959, is the city's largest mosque and the third largest in Germany. In 2020, the number of Muslims in Frankfurt's total population was 18 percent[53]\n\nGovernment and politics\n\n[edit]\n\nMayor\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Mayor of Frankfurt\n\nThe current Mayor is Mike Josef of the Social Democratic Party, who took the office on 11 May 2023.\n\nThe most recent mayoral election was held on 5 March 2023, with a runoff held on 26 March, and the results were as follows:\n\nCandidate Party First round Second round Votes % Votes % Uwe Becker Christian Democratic Union 70,411 34.5 86,307 48.3 Mike Josef Social Democratic Party 49,033 24.0 92,371 51.7 Manuela Rottmann Alliance 90/The Greens 43,502 21.3 Peter Wirth Independent 10,397 5.1 Daniela Mehler-Würzbach The Left 7,356 3.6 Maja Wolff Independent 6,014 2.9 Yanki Pürsün Free Democratic Party 5,768 2.8 Andreas Lobenstein Alternative for Germany 4,628 2.3 Mathias Pfeiffer Citizens for Frankfurt 1,565 0.8 Katharina Tanczos Die PARTEI 1,176 0.6 Khurrem Akhtar Team Todenhöfer 858 0.4 Frank Großenbach dieBasis 744 0.4 Tilo Schwichtenberg Garden Party Frankfurt am Main 661 0.3 Sven Junghans Independent 574 0.3 Yamòs Camara Free Party Frankfurt 487 0.2 Niklas Pauli Independent 340 0.2 Peter Pawelski Independent 325 0.2 Feng Xu Independent 199 0.1 Karl-Maria Schulte Independent 158 0.1 Markus Eulig Independent 102 0.0 Valid votes 204,298 99.6 178,678 99.0 Invalid votes 921 0.4 1,754 1.0 Total 205,219 100.0 180,432 100.0 Electorate/voter turnout 508,510 40.4 510,336 35.4 Source: City of Frankfurt am Main Archived 27 April 2021 at the Wayback Machine\n\nCity council\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Frankfurt am Main city council (Stadtverordnetenversammlung) governs the city alongside the mayor.

In total 15 delegates represent the city in the Landtag in Wiesbaden. The last election took place in October 2018. Six members of parliament were directly elected in their respective constituencies: Uwe Serke (CDU, Frankfurt am Main I), Miriam Dahlke (Greens, Frankfurt am Main II), Ralf-Norbert Bartel (CDU, Frankfurt am Main III), Michael Boddenberg (CDU, Frankfurt am Main IV), Markus Bocklet (Greens, Frankfurt am Main V) and Boris Rhein (CDU, Frankfurt am Main VI).\n\nDelegates from Frankfurt often serve high-ranking positions in Hessian politics, e.g. Michael Boddenberg is Hessian Minister of Finance and Boris Rhein was elected President of the Landtag of Hesse in 2019.\n\nGerman federal election\n\n[edit]\n\nFor federal elections which are held every four years, Frankfurt is split up into two constituencies. In the German federal election 2017, Matthias Zimmer (CDU) and Bettina Wiesmann were elected to the Bundestag by directe mandate in Frankfurt am Main I and Frankfurt am Main II respectively. Nicola Beer (FDP), Achim Kessler (Linke), Ulli Nissen (SPD) and Omid Nouripour (Greens) were elected as well.\n\nNicola Beer resigned as a member of parliament in 2019 following her election to the European Parliament where she now serves as vice president.\n\nEconomy and business\n\n[edit]\n\nFrankfurt is one of the world's most important financial hubs and Germany's financial capital, followed by Hamburg and Stuttgart. Frankfurt was ranked eighth at the International Financial Centers Development Index (2013), eighth at the Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index (2008), ninth at the Global Financial Centres Index (September 2013),[54] tenth at the Global Power City Index (2011), 11th at the Global City Competitiveness Index[broken anchor] (2012), 12th at the Innovation Cities Index (2011),[55] 14th at the World City Survey[broken anchor] (2011) and 23rd at the Global Cities Index (2012).[56]\n\nThe city's importance as a financial hub has risen since the eurozone crisis. Indications are the establishment of two institutions of the European System of Financial Supervisors (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and European Systemic Risk Board) in 2011, and the entry into force in 2014 of European Banking Supervision, by which the European Central Bank has become the central supervisory authority for the euro area banking sector.\n\nAccording to an annual study by Cushman & Wakefield, the European Cities Monitor (2010), Frankfurt has been one of the top three cities for international companies in Europe, after London and Paris, since the survey started in 1990.[57] It is the only German city considered to be an alpha world city (category 3) as listed by the Loughborough University group's 2010 inventory,[58] which was a promotion from the group's 2008 inventory when it was ranked as an alpha minus world city (category 4).[59]\n\nWith over 922 jobs per 1,000 inhabitants, Frankfurt has the highest concentration of jobs in Germany. On work days and Saturdays, one million people commute from all over the Rhein-Main-Area. The GRP per capita was €96,670 in 2019.[60]\n\nThe city is expected to benefit from international banks relocating jobs from London to Frankfurt as a result of Brexit to retain access to the EU market.[61][62] Thus far, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc., Standard Chartered Plc and Nomura Holdings Inc. announced they would move their EU headquarters to Frankfurt.[62]\n\nCentral banks\n\n[edit]\n\nFrankfurt is home to two important central banks: the German Bundesbank and the European Central Bank (ECB).[63]\n\nEuropean Central Bank\n\n[edit]\n\nThe European Central Bank (Europäische Zentralbank) is one of the world's most important central banks with a balance sheet total of around 7 trillion.[64] The ECB sets monetary policy for the Eurozone, consisting of 19 EU member states that have adopted the Euro (€) as their common currency. From 1998 the ECB Headquarters have been located in Frankfurt, first in the Eurotower at Willy-Brandt-Platz and in two other nearby high-rises. The new Seat of the European Central Bank in the Ostend district, consisting of the former wholesale market hall (Großmarkthalle) and a newly built 185-meter skyscraper, was completed in late 2014. The new building complex was designed to accommodate up to 2,300 ECB personnel. The location is a few kilometers away from downtown and borders an industrial area as well as the Osthafen (East Harbor), It was primarily chosen because of its large premises which allows the ECB to install security arrangements without high fences.\n\nThe city honors the importance of the ECB by officially using the slogan \"The City of the Euro\" since 1998.\n\nDeutsche Bundesbank\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Deutsche Bundesbank (German Federal Bank), located in Ginnheim, was established in 1957 as the central bank for the Federal Republic of Germany. Until the euro (€) was introduced in 1999, the Deutsche Bundesbank was responsible for the monetary policy of Germany and for the German currency, the Deutsche Mark (DM). The Bundesbank was greatly respected for its control of inflation through the second half of the 20th century. Today the Bundesbank is an integral part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) which is formed by all 27 EU member states. Its bilance sheet total is around 2,7 trillion,[65] making it the 4th biggest central bank.\n\nCommercial banks\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2010, 63 national and 152 international banks had a registered office, including the headquarters of the major German banks, as well as 41 offices of international banks.[8] Frankfurt is therefore known as Bankenstadt (\"City of the banks\") and nicknamed \"Mainhattan\" (a portmanteau of the local Main river and Manhattan in New York City) or \"Bankfurt\". 73,200 people were employed at banks in 2010.\n\nDeutsche Bank — Germany's largest commercial bank. It had 15% share of private customers and total assets of €1,900 billion in 2010.

The KfW headquarters are located in the Westend district at Bockenheimer Landstraße and Senckenberganlage.\n\nCommerzbank — Germany's fourth-largest bank by total assets (2017). In 2009, Commerzbank merged with competitor Dresdner Bank, then the third-largest German bank. Due to the merger and the higher credit risks, Commerzbank was 25% nationalized during the Great Recession. It is listed in the DAX. Its headquarters are at Commerzbank Tower (259 meters), the second-tallest building in the EU, at Kaiserplatz.\n\nLandesbank Hessen-Thüringen – Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen, or short Helaba, is a commercial bank owned by the states of Hesse and Thuringia (Landesbank). As such, it is a service provider for the local Sparkassen. Helaba is one of nine Landesbanken and is the fifth-largest in Germany. It is located in the 200-meter-tall Main Tower in the financial district, the only skyscraper in Frankfurt with an observation desk open to the public.\n\nDekaBank – DekaBank is the central asset manager of the Sparkassen in Germany. The headquarters of DekaBank are located at the Trianon skyscraper at Mainzer Landstraße.\n\nING Diba Germany – Germany's largest direct bank, headquartered in Bockenheim\n\nOther major German banks include Frankfurter Volksbank, the second-largest Volksbank in Germany, Frankfurter Sparkasse and old-established private banks such as Bankhaus Metzler, Hauck & Aufhäuser and Delbrück Bethmann Maffei.\n\nMany international banks have a registered or a representative office, e.g., Credit Suisse, UBS, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of China, Banco do Brasil, Itaú Unibanco Société Générale, BNP Paribas, SEB, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays.\n\nFrankfurt Stock Exchange\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Frankfurt Stock Exchange\n\nThe Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse) began in the ninth century. By the 16th century Frankfurt had developed into an important European hub for trade fairs and financial services. Today the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is by far the largest in Germany, with a turnover of more than 90 percent of the German stock market and is the third-largest in Europe after the London Stock Exchange and the European branch of the NYSE Euronext. The most important stock market index is the DAX, the index of the 30 largest German business companies listed at the stock exchange. The stock exchange is owned and operated by Deutsche Börse, which is itself listed in the DAX. Deutsche Börse also owns the European futures exchange Eurex and clearing company Clearstream. Trading takes place exclusively via the Xetra trading system, with redundant floor brokers taking on the role of market-makers on the new platform.\n\nOn 1 February 2012 European Commission blocked the proposed merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext. \"The merger between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives worldwide. These markets are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for the whole European economy that they remain competitive. We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered fell far short of resolving the concerns.\"[67] European competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia said.\n\nIt is located downtown at the Börsenplatz. Deutsche Börse's headquarters are formally registered in Frankfurt, but it moved most of its employees to a high-rise called \"The Cube\" in Eschborn in 2010, primarily due to significantly lower local corporate taxes.\n\nFrankfurt Trade Fair\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Frankfurt Trade Fair\n\nFrankfurt Trade Fair (Messe Frankfurt) has the third-largest exhibition site in the world with a total of 578,000 m2 (6,220,000 sq ft).

This is partly attributed to the financial sector, but also to its cosmopolitan nature, with expatriates and immigrants representing one-fourth of its population. For this reason, Frankfurt's property market often operates differently than the rest of the country where the prices are generally flatter.\n\nTourism\n\n[edit]\n\nFrankfurt is one of Germany's leading tourist destinations.

The houses were acquired by the city council in 1405 from a wealthy merchant family. The middle house became the city hall and was later connected with its neighbors. The Kaisersaal (\"Emperor's Hall\") is located on the upper floor and is where the newly crowned emperors held their banquets. The Römer was partially destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. The surrounding square, the Römerberg, is named after the city hall.\n\nThe former Altstadt (old town) quarter between the Römer and the Frankfurt Cathedral was redeveloped as the Dom-Römer Quarter from 2012 to 2018, including 15 reconstructions of historical buildings that were destroyed during World War II.\n\nFrankfurt Cathedral\n\nFrankfurt Cathedral (Frankfurter Dom) is not a cathedral, but the main Catholic church, dedicated to St. Bartholomew. The Gothic building was constructed in the 14th and 15th centuries on the foundation of an earlier church from the Merovingian time. From 1356 onwards, kings of the Holy Roman Empire were elected in this church, and from 1562 to 1792, Roman-German emperors were crowned there.\n\nSince the 18th century, St. Bartholomew's has been called Dom, although it was never a bishop's seat. In 1867 it was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in its present style. It was again partially destroyed in World War II and rebuilt in the 1950s. Its height is 95 meters. The cathedral tower has a viewing platform open to the public at a height of 66 meters, accessed through a narrow spiral staircase with 386 steps.\n\nSt. Paul's Church\n\nSt. Paul's Church (Paulskirche) is a national historic monument in Germany because it was the seat of the first democratically elected parliament in 1848. It was established in 1789 as a Protestant church, but was not completed until 1833. Its importance has its roots in the Frankfurt Parliament, which met in the church during the revolutionary years of 1848/49 in order to write a constitution for a united Germany. The attempt failed because the monarchs of Prussia and Austria did not want to lose power. In 1849, Prussian troops ended the democratic experiment by force and the parliament dissolved; the building was once more used for religious services.\n\nSt. Paul's was partially destroyed in World War II with its interior significantly damaged. It was quickly and symbolically rebuilt after the war albeit with modern alterations particularly to the interior; today it is used mainly for exhibitions and events.\n\nArchäologischer Garten Frankfurt\n\nThe Archaeological Garden contains small parts of the oldest recovered buildings: an ancient Roman settlement and the Frankfurt Royal Palace (Kaiserpfalz Frankfurt) from the sixth century. The garden is located between the Römerberg and the cathedral. It was discovered after World War II when the area was heavily bombed and later partly rebuilt. The remains were preserved and are now open to the public. From 2013 until 2015 an event building, the Stadthaus (\"City house\"), has been built on top of the garden, but it remains open to the public free of charge.\n\nHaus Wertheim\n\nWertheim House is the only timbered house in the Altstadt district that survived the heavy bombings of World War II undamaged. It is located on the Römerberg next to the Historical Museum.\n\nSaalhof\n\nThe Saalhof is the oldest conserved building in the Altstadt district and dates to the 12th century. It was used as an exhibition hall by Dutch clothiers when trade fairs were held during the 14th and 15th centuries. The Saalhof was partly destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. Today it serves as a part of the Historical Museum.\n\nEiserner Steg\n\nThe Eiserner Steg (Iron Bridge) is a pedestrian-only bridge across the Main that connects Römerberg and Sachsenhausen. It was built in 1868 and was the second bridge to cross the river. After World War II, when it was blown up by the Wehrmacht, it was quickly rebuilt in 1946. Today some 10,000 people cross the bridge on a daily basis.\n\nAlte Oper\n\nThe Alte Oper is a former opera house, hence the name \"Old Opera\". The opera house was built in 1880 by architect Richard Lucae. It was one of the major opera houses in Germany until it was heavily damaged in World War II. Until the late 1970s, it was a ruin, nicknamed \"Germany's most beautiful ruin\". Former Frankfurt Lord Mayor Rudi Arndt called for blowing it up in the 1960s, which earned him the nickname \"Dynamite-Rudi\". (Later on, Arndt said he never had meant his suggestion seriously.)\n\nPublic pressure led to its refurbishment and reopening in 1981. Today, it functions as a famous concert hall, while operas are performed at the \"new\" Frankfurt Opera. The inscription on the frieze of the Alte Oper says: \"Dem Wahren, Schönen, Guten\" (\"To the true, the beautiful, the good\").\n\nEschenheimer Turm\n\nThe Eschenheim Tower (Eschenheimer Turm) was erected at the beginning of the 15th century and served as a city gate as part of late-medieval fortifications.

It is located downtown at the entrance to the Zeil, the central pedestrian shopping street.\n\nHauptwache\n\nAlthough today Hauptwache is mostly associated with the inner-city underground train station of the same name, the name originates from a baroque building on the square above the station. The Hauptwache building was constructed in 1730 and was used as a prison, therefore the name that translates as \"main guard-house\". Today the square surrounding the building is also called \"Hauptwache\" (formal: An der Hauptwache). It is situated downtown opposite to St. Catherine's Church and houses a famous café.\n\nCentral Station\n\nFrankfurt Central Station (Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof), which opened in 1888, was built as the central train station for Frankfurt to replace three smaller downtown train stations and to boost the needed capacity for travellers. It was constructed as a terminus station and was the largest train station in Europe by floor area until 1915 when Leipzig Central Station was opened. Its three main halls were constructed in a neorenaissance-style, while the later enlargement with two outer halls in 1924 was constructed in neoclassic-style.\n\nFrankfurter Hof\n\nThe Frankfurter Hof is a landmark downtown hotel at Kaiserplatz, built from 1872 to 1876.

It is the only one of nine churches in the Old Town that survived World War II almost undamaged. The parish serves the English-speaking community. The church has been under restoration from 2011 until 2019.[82]\n\nGründerzeit quarters\n\nAround the city centre there are wide spread quarters full of Gründerzeit architecture. Buildings of that typ often sport richly-decorated façades in the form of Historicism such as Gothic Revival, Renaissance Revival, German Renaissance and Baroque Revival.\n\nTimber framed old towns\n\nAround the city center of Frankfurt are several former independent villages, now part of the city, with timber framed centres and even whole old towns like Höchst, Seckbach, Niederursel and Bergen-Enkheim.

Farbenindustrie AG. It is located in the Westend district and borders Grüneburgpark in the west. Upon its completion, the complex was the largest office building in Europe and remained so until the 1950s. The building served as headquarters for research projects relating to the development of synthetic oil and rubber and the manufacturing of magnesium, lubricating oil, explosives, methanol, and Zyklon B, the lethal gas used in concentration camps.[84][85] After World War II, it served as the headquarters for the Supreme Allied Command and from 1949 to 1952 the High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG). It became the principal location for implementing the Marshall Plan, which largely financed the post-war reconstruction of Europe. The state apparatus of the Federal German Government was devised there. It served as the headquarters for the US Army's V Corps and the Northern Area Command (NACOM) until 1995 when the US Army returned control of the IG Farben Building to the German government. It was purchased on behalf of the Goethe University Frankfurt by the state of Hesse. In October 2001 it became part of the Westend Campus of Goethe University.\n\n21st-century architecture\n\n[edit]\n\nDie Welle (The Wave), built 1998–2003, a complex of three wavelike-formed office buildings next to the Opernplatz.\n\nAlte Stadtbibliothek, rebuilt 2003–2005, reconstruction of the old public library house originally built 1820–1825.\n\nPalais Thurn und Taxis, rebuilt 2004–2009, reconstruction of a palace originally built 1731–1739.\n\nMyZeil, built 2004–2009, shopping mall at the Zeil with an imposing vaulted glass-structure.\n\nThe Squaire (portmanteau of square and air), also known as Airrail Center Frankfurt, is a 660 m (2,165.35 ft) long and 45 m (147.64 ft) tall office building located at Frankfurt Airport.

Most skyscrapers and high-rise office buildings are located in the financial district (Bankenviertel) near downtown, around the trade fair premises (Europaviertel) and at Mainzer Landstraße between Opernplatz and Platz der Republik, which connects the two areas.\n\nThe 20 skyscrapers are:\n\nCommerzbank Tower, 259.0 m (849.74 ft) – The EU's second-tallest building, the tallest building in Europe 1997–2003; Commerzbank headquarters.\n\nMesseturm, 256.5 m (841.54 ft) – The EU's third-tallest building, the tallest building in Europe 1990–1997; main tenant is Goldman Sachs (Germany).\n\nFour I, 233.0 m (764.44 ft)\n\nWestend Tower, 208.0 m (682.41 ft) – DZ Bank headquarters\n\nMain Tower, 200.0 m (656.17 ft) – Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen and Standard & Poor's (Germany) headquarters\n\nTower 185, 200.0 m (656.17 ft) – PricewaterhouseCoopers (Germany) headquarters\n\nONE , 191 m (626.64 ft)\n\nOmniturm, 190.0 m (623.36 ft)\n\nTrianon, 186.0 m (610.24 ft) – DekaBank headquarters\n\nSeat of the European Central Bank, 185.0 m (606.96 ft) – European Central Bank headquarters\n\nGrand Tower, 179.9 m (590.22 ft) – Tallest residential tower\n\nFour I, 179.0 m (587.27 ft) – Residential tower\n\nOpernturm, 170.0 m (557.74 ft) – UBS (Germany) headquarters\n\nTaunusturm, 170.0 m (557.74 ft)\n\nSilberturm, 166.3 m (545.60 ft) – Germany's tallest building 1978–1990, Main tenant is Deutsche Bahn.\n\nWestend Gate, 159.3 m (522.64 ft) – Germany's tallest building 1976–1978, Main tenant is Marriott Frankfurt Hotel.\n\nDeutsche Bank I, 155.0 m (508.53 ft) – Deutsche Bank headquarters\n\nDeutsche Bank II, 155.0 m (508.53 ft)\n\nMarienturm, 155.0 m (508.53 ft)\n\nSkyper, 153.8 m (504.59 ft) – Main tenant is DekaBank.\n\nOther high-rise buildings include:\n\nEurotower, 148.0 m (485.56 ft) – Former European Central Bank headquarters\n\nOne Forty West, 145 m (475.72 ft) – Meliá Hotels International, Residential\n\nFrankfurter Büro Center, 142.4 m (467.19 ft) – Main tenant is Clifford Chance (Germany).\n\nCity-Haus, 142.1 m (466.21 ft) – Main tenant is DZ Bank.\n\nGallileo, 136.0 m (446.19 ft) – Main tenant is Commerzbank.\n\nHistory of high-rise buildings\n\n[edit]\n\nFor centuries, St. Bartholomeus's Cathedral was the tallest structure. The first building to exceed the 95-meter-high cathedral was not an office building but a grain silo, the 120 m-high (390 ft) Henninger Turm, built from 1959 to 1961.\n\nThe first high-rise building boom came in the 1970s when Westend Gate (then called Plaza Büro Center) and Silberturm were constructed and became the tallest buildings in Germany with a height of 159.3 meters and 166.3 meters, respectively. Around the same time, Frankfurter Büro Center and City-Haus (142.4 meters and 142.1 meters) were constructed at Mainzer Landstraße and Eurotower (148.0 meters) and Garden Tower (127.0 meters; then called Helaba-Hochhaus) were constructed in the financial district.\n\nNone of the buildings constructed during the 1980s surpassed Silberturm. The most famous buildings from this decade are the Deutsche Bank Twin Towers at Taunusanlage, both 155.0 meters tall.\n\nThe 1990s featured a second wave. Messeturm, built on the trade fair site, reached a height of 256.5 meters (842 ft) and became the tallest building in Europe by 1991. It was overtaken by the 259 m-high (850 ft) Commerzbank Tower in 1997. Other tall buildings from this decade are Westendstrasse 1 (208 meters (682 ft)), Main Tower (200 meters (660 ft)) and Trianon (186 meters (610 ft)).\n\nIn 21st-century Frankfurt, more high-rise buildings and skyscrapers (e.g., Skyper, Opernturm, Tower 185, Seat of the European Central Bank, Taunusturm) emerged, but none have surpassed Commerzbank Tower.\n\nOther tall structures\n\n[edit]\n\nEuropaturm — The Europe Tower is a telecommunications tower, also known as the Frankfurt TV Tower, built from 1974 to 1979. With a height of 337.5 meters it is the tallest tower and the second tallest structure in Germany after the Fernsehturm Berlin. It was open to the public until 1999, with an entertainment establishment in the revolving top. It is normally referred to by locals as the \"Ginnheimer Spargel\" (Ginnheim Asparagus), but stands a few meters within Bockenheim district.\n\nHenninger Turm — The Henninger Tower was a 120-mete-high grain silo built from 1959 to 1961 and owned by Henninger Brewery. It was the highest structure until 1974. The Henninger Tower had two rotating restaurants at the height of 101 and 106 meters and an open-air observation deck at the height of 110 meters. The tower closed to the public in October 2002 and was demolished in 2013 to be replaced by a 140 m (459 ft) tall residential tower, which is externally inspired by the old Henninger Turm. The cornerstone for this project was laid in June 2014 and construction was completed in summer 2017. The new tower offers 207 luxury flats[86] and houses the non-rotating restaurant \"Franziska\". From 1962 to 2008 a famous yearly cycling race was named after the tower, the \"Radrennen Rund um den Henninger Turm\" (Cycling race around Henninger Tower). The now-renamed race is still a yearly event.\n\nGoetheturm – The Goethe Tower was a 43 m-high (141 ft) tower on the northern edge of the Frankfurt City Forest in Sachsenhausen. It was the fifth tallest wood construction structure in Germany. It was built in 1931 and was a popular place for day-trippers until it burned down in 2017. A faithful reconstruction has been opened to the public on 12 October 2020, exactly three years after the original's destruction.[87]\n\nShopping streets\n\n[edit]\n\nZeil – Frankfurt's central shopping street. It is a pedestrian-only area and is bordered by two large public squares, Hauptwache in the west and Konstablerwache in the east. It is the second most expensive street for shops to rent in Germany after the Kaufingerstraße in Munich. 85 percent of the shops are retail chains such as H&M, Saturn, Esprit, Zara or NewYorker. In 2009 a new shopping mall named MyZeil opened there with nearly 100 stores and chains like Hollister. Three more shopping malls occupy the Zeil: UpperZeil (replacing the Zeilgalerie, which was demolished in 2016), Galeria Kaufhof and Karstadt, as well as large fashion retail clothing stores from Peek & Cloppenburg and C&A.

The Green Belt is a protected area which means that housing is not allowed. The Green Belt was formally created in 1991 with its own constitution.\n\nMainuferpark – The Mainuferpark (Main Riverbanks Park) is the common term to describe the inner-city Main riverbanks. It is an auto-free zone with large green areas that is popular with strollers and tourists, especially in the summertime, when it can become crowded. The southern riverbank, which continues further to Offenbach am Main and Hanau, offers the best skyline views. The northern riverbank ends in the west at the former Westhafen (West Harbor, a residential housing area) and is growing to the east: A former industrial-used area between the new Seat of the European Central Bank and the Osthafen (East Harbor) has become a park named Hafenpark (Harbor Park), which offers outdoor courts for basketball, soccer and a skatepark.\n\nWallanlagen – The Wallanlagen (former ramparts) relate to the former ring-shaped city wall fortifications around the Altstadt and the Innenstadt district (abolished 1804–1812), now a series of parks. Building is not allowed, with a few exceptions, the most famous being the Alte Oper (built 1880) at the Opernplatz. The part between the northern Main riverbank and the Opernplatz, referred to officially as Taunusanlage and Gallusanlage, is locally known as \"Central Park\" (a reference to the famous park in Manhattan), because of the skyscrapers which stand on both sides.\n\nNizza Park – At the juncture of the northern Main riverbank and the Wallanlagen is a famous small park called Nizza. The name of the park recalls Nice in southern France, because it is one of the warmest areas with a nearly mediterranean climate. Numerous Mediterranean flora grow there and can survive outside during the winter.\n\nGarten des Himmlischen Friedens – \"Garden of Heavenly Peace\", named after the Tiananmen Gate in Beijing, is a Chinese-styled park in the Nordend district and part of the larger Bethmannpark.

In 1989 German producers Michael Münzing and Luca Anzilotti (under the pseudonyms Benito Benites and John \"Virgo\" Garrett III) formed the Snap! project. Snap! songs combined Rap and Soul vocals adding rhythm by using computer technology and mixing electronic sounds, bass and drums. By doing so a new genre was born: Eurodance.[90] In the early 1990s, DJs including Sven Väth and DJ DAG (of Dance 2 Trance) first played a harder, deeper style of acid house that became popular worldwide over the next decade as Trance music. Some of the early and most influential Eurodance, Trance and Techno acts, e.g., La Bouche, Jam and Spoon, Magic Affair, Culture Beat, Snap!, Dance 2 Trance, Oliver Lieb and Hardfloor, and record labels such as Harthouse and Eye Q, were based in the city in the early 1990s.\n\nVenues\n\n[edit]\n\nOper Frankfurt – A leading Germany opera company and one of Europe's most important.

One of the main venues of the early Trance music sound was the Omen nightclub from 1988 to 1998. Another popular disco club of the 1980s–1990s and a hotspot for Techno/Trance music was the Dorian Gray, which was located within Terminal 1 at Frankfurt Airport from 1978 to 2000. Further popular venues were the U60311 (1998–2012) and the Coocoon Club in Fechenheim (2004–2012). Notable live music venues of the past include the Sinkkasten Arts Club (1971–2011) and the King Kamehameha Club (1999–2013).\n\nAmong the most popular active rock and pop concert venues is the Batschkapp in Seckbach, which opened in 1976 as a center for autonomous and left-wing counterculture.

The most luxurious versions have wave-shaped parts, some are made of solid cherry wood inlaid with plumwood.\n\nCulinary specialties\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Hessian cuisine\n\nApfelwein – Apple wine or hard cider is regionally known as \"Ebbelwoi\", \"Äppler\" or \"Stöffsche\". It has an alcohol content of 5.5%–7% and a tart, sour taste. It is traditionally served in a glass, typically decorated with lozenges, called \"Geripptes\", a full glass is then called \"Schoppen\". Apfelwein is also available in a stoneware jar locally known as \"Bembel\". A group normally orders a \"Bembel\" and shares the contents. Apfelwein can be ordered as \"sauergespritzer\", which is apfelwein blended with 30% mineral water or as \"süssgespritzer\", which is Apfelwein blended with lemon soda, orange soda or fresh-pressed apple juice (lemon soda being the most common). Most of the pubs which serve Apfelwein are located in Sachsenhausen, which is therefore known as \"Ebbelwoi district\". Due to its national drink Frankfurt is sometimes called \"Big Ebbel\" (pronunciation with Hessian dialect), an homage to Big Apple, the famous nickname of New York City.\n\nGrüne Soße – Green sauce is a sauce made with hard-boiled eggs, oil, vinegar, salt and a generous amount of seven fresh herbs, namely borage, sorrel, garden cress, chervil, chives, parsley and salad burnet. Variants, often due to seasonal availability include dill, lovage, lemon balm and spinach. Original green sauce Frankfurt-style is made of herbs that were gathered only on fields within the city limits.\n\nFrankfurter Würstchen – \"shor"
