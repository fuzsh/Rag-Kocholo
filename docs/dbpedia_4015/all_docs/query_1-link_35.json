        "text": "P300 is one of the most extensively investigated evoked responses (ER) in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Over the years, P300 has been hypothesised to reflect a variety of functions, such as priming, cognitive processing, memory storage, context updating, resource allocation, etc. (Polich and Kok, 1995; Polich, 2003; Verleger, 2020), and there is an ongoing effort to understand its functions further through such constructs as information, expectancy, and capacity (Verleger, 2020). Usually, P300 is assessed with the oddball paradigm (auditory or visual), where participants have a task to detect a target (or rare, or deviant) stimulus in a train of standard (or frequent, or non-target) stimuli (Luck, 2014). Additionally, it is usual to speak about the P300 complex, involving the earlier frontal component P3a and the later parietal component P3b (Linden, 2005). Being aware of this forking terminology, in the following, we refer to P300 as the ER that occurs after the target stimulus and is different compared to the ER after the standard stimulus. Adding to the complexity of P300, the exact mechanism of P300 generation remains rather unknown (Fell et al., 2004; Hanslmayr et al., 2007; Daly et al., 2009; Rawls et al., 2020). In the present study, we investigate a possibility that P300 might be to some extent generated through a baseline-shift mechanism (BSM, Nikulin et al., 2007; Mazaheri and Jensen, 2008; Iemi et al., 2019; Studenova et al., 2022).\n\nApart from P300, the oddball target stimulus concurrently causes the attenuation of the alpha rhythm amplitude (8–12 Hz). The simultaneity of P300 and alpha rhythm modulation has been observed in numerous earlier and more recent studies, and in Appendix 1 we offer a short overview of these findings. We found 38 studies that presented results for a concomitant occurrence of P300 and alpha power (or amplitude). In 17 studies using EEG, results indicated an overlap in cortical regions of P300 and alpha amplitude decrease, as well as a similar time windows of their occurrence (Peng et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2013; Dong et al., 2015; Shou and Ding, 2015; Tang et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2015; Fabi and Leuthold, 2017; López-Caneda et al., 2017; Vilà-Balló et al., 2017; Fabi and Leuthold, 2018; Michelini et al., 2018; Román-López et al., 2019; Kao et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Nikolin et al., 2021; Paolicelli et al., 2021). Similar observations were made using MEG (Ishii et al., 2009). Yordanova et al., 2001 and 14 more studies found similarities in location but not in the peak latencies (Kolev et al., 2001; Kamarajan et al., 2006; Digiacomo et al., 2008; Krämer et al., 2011; Barutchu et al., 2013; Deiber et al., 2013; Kayser et al., 2014; Zarka et al., 2014; Deiber et al., 2015; Leroy et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2019; Martel et al., 2019; Faro et al., 2019; Espenhahn et al., 2020). In a few studies, alpha modulation did not appear at all (Kamarajan et al., 2004; Delval et al., 2018) or the relationship between alpha oscillations and ER was not supported by cross-condition comparison (Cooper et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2017; Tamura et al., 2016). In general, we acknowledge that due to different ways of presenting results, sometimes it was difficult to tell whether the peak of P300 and the attenuation peak in the alpha amplitude correspond to each other. Nevertheless, the vast majority of studies confirmed the simultaneous occurrence of P300 and alpha amplitude decrease in several experimental paradigms, which in turn served as a basis for further investigation carried out in the present study.\n\nThe simultaneous presence of P300 and alpha amplitude modulation in the poststimulus window indicates that P300 can be partially generated through BSM (Nikulin et al., 2007; Mazaheri and Jensen, 2008; Iemi et al., 2019; Studenova et al., 2022). Previous research investigated whether the origin of P300 is due to an additive mechanism (Fell et al., 2004; Wan et al., 2009; Herrmann et al., 2014) or a phase-reset mechanism (Fell et al., 2004; Daly et al., 2009; Wan et al., 2009, but Popp et al., 2019), and the evidence for these mechanisms is far from converging. However, P300 has not yet been assessed with respect to BSM. In general theory, BSM links evoked activity and spontaneous oscillatory activity, stating that if oscillations are modulated by the stimulus presentation, this modulation will be mirrored in the low-frequency signal if oscillations have a non-zero mean (see Figure 1). In other words, the amplitude modulation of the oscillatory process affects the mean as well, which in turn leads to the deflection in the spectral range of modulation activity (with the frequency of modulation lying in a considerably lower range than the carrier frequency of oscillations themselves; for instance, if the oscillations’ frequency range is 8–12 Hz, the modulation’s frequency range is 0–3 Hz). In practice, when integrated over several periods, oscillations with a non-zero mean will show an average value different from zero that will scale with the amplitude of oscillations. Likewise, a non-zero mean implies that average values of the upper and lower half of the oscillatory cycle would be unequal. In Figure 1, negative-mean oscillations undergo a decrease in the amplitude in the poststimulus window and, according to BSM, the decrease in the amplitude of negative-mean oscillations creates an ER with a positive polarity. Here, oscillations are assumed to be ongoing, that is they are present before the stimulus onset. The polarity of the ER depends on the sign of the oscillatory mean and on the direction of modulation—an increase or decrease in the amplitude. The oscillatory mean of alpha oscillations has been shown to be present in biophysical model of alpha oscillations (Studenova et al., 2022) and several studies provided empirical evidence for the generation of ER through BSM in somatosensory (Nikulin et al., 2007) and visual (Mazaheri and Jensen, 2008; Iemi et al., 2019) domain. Since P300 coincides with the stimulus-triggered decrease in the alpha amplitude, it is reasonable to assess the compliance of P300 with BSM. Therefore, we hypothesised that P300 generation can at least partially be explained by the amplitude modulation of alpha oscillations, and in the following, we offer a systematic investigation of this hypothesis."
