Premiant were used to evaluate effect of viroid infection with hop latent viroid (HLVd) on the composition of hop resinos and essential oils in the first production year. Healthy plants were compared with naturally reinfected individuals under field conditions. On average, viroid infection decreased content of α- bitter acids by 40 %. The content of β-bitter acids, as well as the ratios of humulone/cohumulone and lupulone/colupulone was not influenced by viroid infection. The content of all monoterpenes was for 29, 37.4 and 41.6 % higher for myrcene, α-and β-pinene, respectively, in infected plants compared with the healthy controls. The contents of sesquiterpenes like β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, α-copaene, γ-muurolene, β-bisabolene, γ- cadinene, and δ-cadinene decreased by 13.7, 13, 14, 18.5, 29, 21.7 and 18.5 %, respectively, due to viroid infection. The possible influence of some oxidative-reduction processes ac..."
