Ritchie reappeared in the 2003 and 2004. Actor Jerry verDorn has portrayed the role since October 25, 2005.[2] John Brotherton played a young Clint in a 2008 storyline in which the characters Bo and Rex find themselves in 1968.[3]\n\nStorylines\n\nThe eldest son of Buchanan patriarch Asa Buchanan and his first wife Olympia, Clint moves to Llanview to take over as editor for The Banner. The newspaper's previous editor, Joe Riley, had been diagnosed with a brain tumor. After a failed relationship with Pat Ashley, Clint becomes close to Joe's widow Victoria Lord Riley; they eventually marry. Clint adopts Viki's two sons, Kevin and Joey.\n\nClint and Viki's marriage is strong but troubled; it is ultimately jeopardized by Viki's dissociative identity disorder, which recurs when Viki discovers that her former ward Tina Clayton is actually her sister. Tina makes an enemy in Clint as she conspires to use Viki's illness to take control of their father Victor Lord's fortune, but Clint and Viki triumph and have a child of their own, Jessica, in 1986. That same year, Clint discovers that he is the father of former flame Maria Roberts' adult son Cord, who is now married to Tina. Over the years, Clint and Viki endure much domestic drama, from indiscretions between them, Viki's battles with dissociative identity disorder and family squabbles among the Lords, Cramers and Buchanans. Married and divorced twice, the two remain great friends.\n\nIn 2001 it is revealed that Viki had in fact been drugged and raped by Mitch Laurence in 1986, and given birth to twins. Mitch is in fact the father of Jessica; Clint had fathered Jessica's twin, Natalie Balsom. Mitch had infant Natalie kidnapped and raised by another couple, and he orchestrates her return in 2001 to devastate Viki and her family.\n\nClint leaves town for London in 1998, returning for several brief periods. In 2005 he returns for an extended stay, and soon breaks it off with girlfriend Dallas Jones. The entire family is devastated by Asa's death in August 2007, and Bo and Clint form a closer bond. Clint's relationship with Viki is complicated by his subsequent romance with Dorian Lord, Viki's longtime nemesis. After Clint's messy breakup with Dorian, she seeks revenge by taking over Buchanan Enterprises. Romance begins to blossom between Clint and his brother Bo's ex-wife Nora Hanen, only to be temporarily complicated by the return of Clint's ex-girlfriend Dallas in July 2008. With Nora's help, Clint finally gets BE back from Dorian. In 2009, Bo and Nora are thrown together when their son Matthew is paralyzed in an accident; threatened by their closeness, Clint proposes. He and Nora marry, though Bo and Nora kiss the night before. Bo and Nora soon find themselves back in love; finding out, a vengeful Clint reveals the affair publicly to negatively impact Bo and Nora's careers. Though Asa had left his mansion to Nora, Clint forces her to sign it over to him or risk a costly lawsuit for damages to his reputation as a result of her affair. Clint encourages new mayor Dorian to fire Bo as Police Commissioner, and resumes an affair with his assistant, ex-stripper Kimberly Andrews. They marry on March 11, 2010.\n\nDavid Vickers comes to town and threatens Kim with a secret that she's been hiding from Clint that would ruin her life and her marriage to Clint. The only way David will not reveal her secret to Clint is that she leaves Clint and also leave town. Kim comes up with a story on how she cheated on Clint and how she cannot live with herself any longer because of it. Kim then leaves the mansion and has not been seen since.\n\nOn July 29, 2010, Clint agrees with Dorian's plan that the two of them act as lovers in order to make David jealous. Clint then informs Dorian that he is interested in naming a town park after his father. He insists that Dorian keep him posted of current naming bids. Clint has started to become very ruthless. Blaming David for the breakdown of his marriage to Kimberly, he on the day of David's wedding to Dorian has him abducted. He alerts the Moroccan authorities and his past crimes are reinstated and he winds up in a Moroccan prison. Clint then forges a break-up note for Dorian to make it appear to her and the citizens of Llanview that he is a loser who can't commit to a real relationship. Dorian is heartbroken, much to Clint's delight. When Rex discovers evidence that Clint had David jailed, Clint threatens to have Gigi's financial aid for college revoked in an effort to keep him quiet. Rex complies and keeps the secret even though he is disgusted that he has to keep it from Bo, whom he regards as a father.\n\nClint has developed an affection for Inez Sallinger, the mother of Nate, Ford and James. Trying to win her heart he helps them out of their financial debt and gets Ford his job at the university back. When Clint learns that Ford is possibly the father of Jessica's unborn baby, he has two goons rough him up. He believes that Ford had taken advantage of her in her fragile condition. He states that while he is fond of Ford's mother, \"family comes first.\"\n\nIn October 2010, Echo Disavoy returns for unknown purposes. She corners Clint at Rod's, and he makes it very clear that he wants nothing to do with her and to stay away from Vicki and Charlie. Echo contends that she merely wants to patch things up, to make amends to everyone she has hurt. Clint doesn't buy it and leaves. Later, at the hospital, on his way to see Inez and Ford, he runs into Echo again. She brings up their affair again by showing him an antique half-crescent moon necklace he supposedly gave to her. Echo tells him that it was handcrafted in New Mexico and he had it made for her as a gift. Clint says he has no idea what she's talking about. Echo says that the necklace was a full piece but she left one half of it in Llanview hospital years before, along with another \"precious belonging.\"\n\nA private investigator whom Clint had secretly hired to follow Rex Balsom returns from New Mexico with the other half of the necklace, which Rex had left on the grave of his supposed mother, Lilli, months before. This suggests that he has some connection to Rex's parents. He is later reading a book titled The Love Letters of Rick and Lilli which are the names of Rex's supposed parents. Vicki, after reading one of the various love letters to Rex's mother, finds it oddly familiar, as if she's read or heard it before. Echo meets Clint for dinner on November 5, 2010, revealing that the two of them are Rex's real biological parents. Clint confesses he's known about Rex for a long time but kept the truth from him because he sees him as a \"gold-digging piece of trash\" It is also revealed that he forged the letters between \"Rick\" and \"Lilli\" to prevent Rex from learning the truth. He warns Echo not to reveal the truth, and he threatens to have Rex put in prison for a long time if she talks.\n\nWhen a DNA test is administered later to determine Rex's parentage, Clint has his assistant Vimal change the results so it seems tghat Charlie Banks is Rex's biological father. He also has Vimal change the paternity test of his daughter so the father reads, Brody Lovett. On Thanksgiving, Clint asks Inez to sleep with Bo in an attempt to ruin his marriage to Nora. At first Inez refuses, but she is backed into a corner when he threatens her sons. Joey also returns and proposes to his girlfriend, Aubrey, very prematurely and in front of both Vicki and Clint. Clint believes that Aubrey is a gold-digger and advises his son against her.\n\nClint bails Eddie, Inez's abusive ex-husband, out of jail and instructs him to kidnap Nora and hold her hostage for a few hours, during which time Inez is to drug and seduce Bo. In the end, Inez cannot go through with the seduction, but she does falsely tell Bo that they had sex. Eddie is murdered and the murder weapon is found in Inez's apartment. Nate says he killed Eddie, although people have their doubts. Clint also begins to plant seeds of doubt in Mathew, saying that Bo and Inez have been having an affair. Clint goes to see Nora and Bo in the hospital after she is involved in a car accident while escaping from Eddie, he advises Bo to keep quiet about the one night stand. Inez later tells to Clint that they never slept together, but Clint still preasures her to remain silent or he will implicate her sons in their father's murder. When Bo tells Nora he slept with Inez she kicks him out and Clint invites him to live with him. Clint arrives at the hospital as both Natalie and Jessica give birth to newborn sons and Clint is overjoyed. At Nate's trial Inez confesses everything to Bo and Nora that Clint made her do. Bo later confronts his brother at gunpoint. Clint tells Bo that he had this coming. That Bo never gave a seconds thought on the plans that Clint had for him and Nora and that he didn't care that he humiliated his brother. Bo tells Clint that he is no longer a Buchanan and walks away disgusted.\n\nSoon after, Clint's antics in regard to hiding Rex's paternity and the switching of test results for Natalie and Jessica come to light. Everyone, in particular Viki, is left furious with Clint and refuses to believe him when he tells them that Joey's new wife, Aubrey Wentworth is a con artist. So Clint enlists the aid of Kelly in exposing Aubrey. He is later arrested for tampering with the DNA results, only after Aubrey convinces her friend, Rama to have Vimal confess to the crime to keep Clint out of jail. Clint makes it clear that if he does go down he will give a copy of the flash drive to Joey, exposing Aubrey's scheme. Clint and Vicki learn that Tess has returned and to prevent herself from being sent back to St. Anne's, Tess marries Robert Ford in Las Vegas so she can be free. A fierce custody battle ensues for Ryder and Clint does everything in his power to help. At an unknown point he contacts Alex Olanov and has David transferred there to be kept in a drug induced trance. After having a heart-to-heart with Nigel Clint begins to feel guily about his misdeeds and contacts Alex about sending David home to Llanview only to find out that Bo and Rex already found him. Bo is ready to arrest Clint for kidnapping his son but Clint tells his brother that besides David's word they have no discernible evidence. Bo and Nora start building a case against Clint for the murder of Eddie Ford. By a shear stroke of luck Rex uncovers footage of Clint leaving Eddie's hotel room the night of the murder with gun in hand. Bo arrests his brother again and offers him a deal: He confeses to the murder at his arraignment saving his family the pain and misery of a trial or he pleads not guilty and Bo will bury him. Clint maintains his innocence and warns Bo to let it go or the truth about the murder will destroy his family. Bo and Clint later find Nora lying on the floor in the courtroom. She begins to remember the night of the crash, how after she made her way back to the Minitue Man Motel and saw someone in the room with Eddie. Nora thinks its Clint. Clint is still adamant that he didn't kill Eddie tells Nora she's forgotten because she doesn't want to remember. Clint tells them that he wishes he had killed Eddie, but he got there too late. He then makes a startling confession: The killer was Matthew.\n\nAfter receiving speeches from his children, Bo, Nora, Nigel, and Viki, Clint attempts to make things right with Rex after learning that Rex's son (and his newly discovered grandson) Shane Morasco nearly killed himself after being bullied by Todd Manning's son Jack Manning and his friends at high school. However, Rex rejects Clint's sincere attempt at being a father and Rex (like everyone else) calls Clint out on his recent moral descent. Clint then suffers a heart attack. Dorian comes across the ailing Clint, and after getting him to confess that Echo knew Charlie wasn't Rex's father, she calls 911. Clint soon recovers from his heart attack but learns that he is dying. This revelation causes him to re-examine and re-evaluate his life, including his feelings for Viki. Clint is later blackmailed by his daughter Jessica's (who now has reverted back to her DID alter Tess) new husband and con artist (who is also Aubrey's boyfriend and grifting partner) Cutter Wentworth to extort a piece of the family fortune along with ownership of The Buchanan Mansion in exchange for committing his daughter to St. Anne's. Clint is also blackmailed by Rex to hand over the entire Buchanan fortune in exchange for getting the heart of Rex's dead fiance Gigi Morasco. This causes Cutter (who by then is divorced from Tess after she escapes from St. Anne's with her boyfriend Ford thanks to Rama blackmailing Cutter to sign divorce papers provided by Ford.) to lose ownership of the mansion thanks to a loophole in the deed that says that Clint could have the mansion back anytime he wanted to, and Clint then gives the mansion to Rex. After recovering from his heart transplant surgery, Clint goes to the courthouse to be sentenced for Eddie Ford's murder. Nora cannot bring herself to let Clint take the fall for Eddie's murder so she dropps the murder charges against him. Clint pleads guilty to the DNA tampering and kidnapping and false imprisonment of David Vickers. The judge sentences him to 20 in Statesville Prison. Clints lawyer appeals to the judge for home imprisonment instead, given Clint's stature in the community. Viki offers for Clint to stay at her home in Llanfair and the judge allows it. On August 23, 2011, Clint has Nigel (who now works as his butler/confidante/nurse at The Llanfair Estate) to take off his ankle monitoring device so that he can sneak out of Llanfair to go back to The Buchanan Mansion to honor his late father Asa on the fourth anniversary of his death. Clint convices Rex to let him in the mansion to honor his father, and Clint is later joined by his brother Bo to honor Asa's life. Clint also says good-bye to his son Joey before he goes back to London with Kelly so that she can be closer to her son Zane Buchanan. On August 25, 2011, Clint is reunited with his estranged ex-wife Kim when she arrives out of the blue at Llanfair. Clint then wants to know where Kim has been for the last year and a half. Kim tells Clint that she's been dong the \"same old, same old\", but Clint quickly figures out that Kim has been stripping again since she's been gone. Clint also wants to know what kind of a secret that caused Kim to be blackmailed out of Llanview and out of his life (Clint also figures out that Kim cheating on him with another man wasn't Kim's secret), but Kim doesn't divulge her secret to Clint. Clint's daughter Natalie then arrives in Llanfair to kick Kim out of the house, unhappy that she is back in town to get her hands on Clint's money again. Kim later returns to Llanfair to ask Clint to help out her sick friend in the hospital by getting a portfolio for her. Clint agrees, and he also arranges for Kim's friend to be moved to Llanview Hospital, which Kim is okay with that decision. Clint also looks up infromation on the internet about Kim's mysterious friend in the hospital in Anchorage, Kentucky, as well as the info on The Spotted Pony strip club. Clint comes up with nothing. On October 20, 2011, Rex decides to give back the Buchanan fortune to Clint after he drops his revenge plan against Jack and Victor Lord Jr., (after it was revealed that he wasn't the real Todd Manning), and Clint agrees to his request. He even lets Rex and Shane still live in the Buchanan Mansion and to pay for the housing bills himself.\n\nReferences"
