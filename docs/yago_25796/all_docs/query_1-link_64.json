        "text": "Where’s she from? Born in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Hickland currently lives in Manhattan with her husband, actor Michael E. Knight (“All My Children” cutie Tad Martin).\n\nWhat does she do? Plays super-bitch Lindsay Rappaport on “One Life to Live” and designs her own cosmetic line Cat Cosmetics.\n\nWhy the feline reference? Cat is Hickland’s nickname. Also, “I’ve always had a deep affinity for cats,” she says. “Cat is my name, my nature and my passion. I even rescued seven cats who now live with me at home.”\n\nWhy should I care about her stuff? Who knows more about makeup than a catty soap opera diva? Hickland, who does her own makeup for the show, says she started the line because she was tired of recommending different brands to her friends when they asked for advice. “So I decided to launch a fabulous line that does it all,” she said.\n\nWhat’s Hickland up to these days? After the successful debut of Catcosmetics.com early this year, Hickland’s opening her first store on the Upper East Side. The Cat Cosmetics Makeup Studio (1045 Madison Ave., bet. 79th & 80th streets, 212-535-3085) will carry her complete line, including the new Cat Kit (bronzers, eye shadows, glosses and blush, $65).\n\nWould-be glamour pusses can attend Hickland’s monthly classes at the Sante Fe-style studio, a relaxing spot where shoppers are served chai tea while soothing Indian flute music plays in the background."
