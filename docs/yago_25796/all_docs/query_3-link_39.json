        "text": "I don't think any of us three ever thought it would be this way. Growing up I was incredibly close to my brothers. We're three years apart and we had a pretty tight knit family. It wasn't always smooth sailing, and we dealt with some really tough times as we got older but it was our closeness that got us through it. Games of NBA Live. Actual games of 1 on 1 (which over time I slowly started to lose). Fake WWE matches in our rooms. Then as we got older - sharing friends, visiting each other in college - and ultimately all of us working in the same industry together. I love what I do, but it's amplified that I get to share this industry with family. I spend every day working with one brother - while the other brother does his thing on the sales side. We didn't grow up in the industry, but somehow we all found ourselves here. I couldn't be any happier. It's kinda incredible and never lost on me. Some say you shouldn't work with family. They're wrong. Family is everything. Happy Friday! #work #life #career #job #advertising #marketing\n\nLife is funny... It was quite a road for me & my wife to have a baby - so when we finally got the amazing news (2 years ago) I wanted to share it in a \"larger than life\" way. I shot \"Dude with Sign\" a cold email explaining our fertility journey and I don't have enough words to describe how much of a class act he was. This is why you \"shoot your shot.\" Fast forward to yesterday - We recently launched a pretty large #OOH campaign for Primally Pure (shoutout Day Job) and who better to create some social amplification around this amazing campaign and brand relaunch then......Dude with Sign. Incredibly small world. Have a great weekend!! #OOH #work #life #creative #branding #marketing #advertising\n\nIt's fun to root for someone else. Scott Harris is an incredible songwriter & producer. Take a peek at his wikipedia. Odds are you know a song (or 10) Scott's a camp friend (shocker) who I've known for over 20 years and watching his career evolve has been simply amazing. I'm a true music lover. Every genre. Meticulous Spotify playlists for all occasions - and every Friday I listen to \"Release Radar\" front to back. It's always mindblowing when a \"Scott song\" pops up. Today it's brand new Shawn Mendes. Take a listen - and root for your friends. Have a great weekend! https://lnkd.in/ejATYe9N #music #life #Spotify #career #work\n\nRyan Babenzien shared some thoughts recently around Saks not paying money owed to his brand (+ others) and it resonated greatly. We have a Net 30 policy on payment, but we're flexible where needed. We want to build relationships with brands, do right by them, and not focus on making what we do simply a transactional relationship. It's never going to be smooth sailing when running a business. You'll have payment plans. Stories of a company missing their mark and needing more time, and you want to do what you can to help them out. At the end of the day you need to balance patience & understanding with the fact that you're running a business and make decide when \"enough is enough.\" The last few weeks have been difficult as we've had a particularly difficult situation regarding a client and payment. It's not just being late. It's being incredibly late. It's breaking numerous payment plans promised. It's a handful of broken promises from those in various leadership positions. At some point you need you to protect your business, self respect and make sure you're not walked all over. We're flexible but we won't be made fools. Hard lessons in running a business, but you become better for it. Can't always be amazing campaigns & amazing clients (though I'll take that 90% of the time!) #work #life #career #business #entrepreneurship #advertising #marketing https://lnkd.in/ezXhPrEE\n\nMet Rion Harmon at Soho Ludlow House way back in 2019. I hadn't yet started Quan Media Group but I was introduced to him and the amazing Benjamin Witte as we chatted Recess #OOH - and a lot of other things. Fast forward to 2024 - and a handful of campaigns in between. Here we are for Primally Pure and this is a FUN one (keep your eyes open if you're in NYC, BK, LA, DAL and AUS). The Day Job team crushed this creative. Simply can't miss it. Shoutout to Dinah Chapman (one of those A+ clients) ðŸŽ¨ - Colossal Media #Beauty #OOH #DOOH #Creative #Branding #Marketing #Advertising"
