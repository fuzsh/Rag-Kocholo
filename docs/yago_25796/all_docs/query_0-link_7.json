        "text": "The love story of a lifetime…\n\nIn this week’s Throwback Thursday Soaps.com takes readers back to when Victoria Lord decided she wanted to marry Clint Buchanan only to find he had already married Lindsay Rappaport. She was at a major crossroads in her life and found herself stranded out in the middle of nowhere…\n\nIt was then that Viki first walked into the bar Crossroads and met a handsome, flattering bartender named Ben Davidson, who gave her a nickname and memento before she went back to Llanview. Over the course of a short time, they fell in love, married in 2000 and shared a love story of a lifetime. Ben was there for Viki during hard times, especially when she found out Jessica’s twin had been stolen at birth and she had another daughter named Natalie. The couple even made it through harder times when Viki found out she had breast cancer and Ben’s mob past came to light.\n\nHowever, during one of Viki’s times as Niki Smith, Allison Perkins held her hostage at the cabin, and when Ben raced in to save Viki, Allison shot him. Ben was in a coma for a very longtime. Viki kept Ben alive on life support for years. When Viki found out she was suffering from heart disease, her family pleaded with her to let Ben go and accept his heart, which was a match. Until the end, Ben lived on in Viki through her heart transplant, and she even reunited with him on one of her ‘trips to Heaven’.\n\nDo you remember what nickname and memento Ben gave Viki at Crossroads? Vote your knowledge in our poll…"
