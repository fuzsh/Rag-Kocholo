        "text": "David Hasselhoff and his ex-wife Catherine Hickland met for the first time in about 20 years Friday at the Knight Rider Festival on Fremont Street.\n\nHe arrived about 25 minutes late for the festival's kickoff ceremony.\n\n\"He was late for our wedding too, so I'm not surprised,\" said Hickland, via a Twitter tweet.\n\nThey were married from 1984 to 1989.\n\n\"There are no bad feelings, never was,\" she told me. \"I always felt bad when things went bad for him and good when things were going good for him.\"\n\nBoth arrived in K.I.T.T. cars, the iconic vehicles that appeared in the series, which ran from 1982-1986. The Hoff arrived accompanied by a film crew.\n\nEarlier, Hickland was the maid of honor for a number of couples who renewed marriage vows at the Little White Chapel in ceremonies held next to Hickland's K.I.T.T.\n\nAfter the divorce, Hickland continued her acting career, mostly in soap operas, but gave Broadway a try, playing Fantine in \"Les Misérables\" in 1995.\n\nFor more than a decade she played Lindsay Rappaport on ABC's \"One Life to Live,\" until her recent move to Las Vegas where she hopes to establish herself as a hypnotist.\n\nShe's got a venue lined up, but doesn't want the word out just yet.\n\nShe has been studying with master hypnotists for five years, most recently with Marc Savard, who runs a stage hypnosis school when he isn't performing at the V Theatre at Planet Hollywood Resort.\n\nHer 14-year marriage to soap star Michael E. Knight of \"All My Children\" ended in 2006. Before leaving New York City last fall, after two decades, she published \"The 30 Day Heartbreak Cure - A Guide to Getting Over Him and Back Out There One Month From Today.\"\n\nAfter chatting with The Hoff, Hickland said it was \"just like seeing an old friend, not an ex- husband.\"\n\nHe seemed to be in good health and good spirits. \"And that makes me happy; he is a good person,\" she said.\n\nSHOWEST WRAP\n\n\"High School Musical\" star Vanessa Hudgens is living out a dream.\n\nHudgens, who was in town to pick up the female star of tomorrow award at ShoWest, told the R-J's Carol Cling that starring in the \"Beauty and the Beast\" update \"Beastly\" was a dream come true, because, as a little girl, \"I would sing all the Belle songs\" from \"Beauty and the Beast.\"\n\n\"Never in a million years did I imagine that I would be playing the part,\" she added.\n\nLas Vegas' own Paige O'Hara, who's now in \"Menopause: The Musical\" at the Luxor, was the voice of Belle, the heroine in the 1991 Disney version of \"Beauty and the Beast.\"\n\nSIGHTINGS\n\nFormer \"Baywatch\" star Angelica Bridges, now with the \"Fantasy\" revue at Luxor, reading some of her favorite story books to students at M.J. Christensen Elementary School in Summerlin on Friday, part of Nevada Reading Week.\n\nTHE PUNCH LINE\n\n\"John Paul Stevens, the 88-year-old Supreme Court justice (he's actually 89 years old), said he's considering retiring. Either that or playing for the Minnesota Vikings.\"  Jay Leno\n\nNorm Clarke can be reached at (702) 383-0244 or norm@reviewjournal.com.
