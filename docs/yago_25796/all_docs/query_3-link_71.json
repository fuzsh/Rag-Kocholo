        "text": "Miriam Oboler Rappaport OBITUARY\n\nMiriam Oboler Rappaport, mother of Edward Rappaport (Nancy), Leah Strauss (Randy), and Deborah Robello; and grandmother of Benjamin, Ryan (Georgia), Joshua, Lindsay, David, Joseph and Lillian, died peacefully Saturday, August 19, 2023, after a sudden devastating return of cancer. She was predeceased by the love of her life, Martin Louis Rappaport, in 2016.Miriam’s legacy lives on through the countless students, geriatric social work clients, friends, cousins and family members around the world whom she cherished, mentored, and entertained with her stunning wit, charm and brilliance. Her phenomenal memory for events, literature, medical and scientific achievements, global political history, music and showbiz, family lore, and an impressive amalgam of trivia knew no bounds. Her thirst for knowledge was unquenchable, her compassion and respect for people deep and true, her love of life palpable.Born October 5, 1929, Miriam was the treasured only child of Louis and Vera Oboler, emigres from Dvinsk, Latvia, and Druya, Belarus. She grew up in West Rogers Park and Albany Park, Chicago, speaking Russian at home, acquiring an understanding of the Yiddish her parents spoke between themselves, learning precise English in public school, later becoming fluent in Spanish, and adding passable Japanese and Hebrew to her repertoire. Miriam was a child of the Depression. She and Vera (a credentialed pharmacist in her native country) were welcomed into the arms of extended family in Detroit, New York, and Springfield, MA, while Louis found work as a journeyman electrician. They settled in Chicago’s Jewish neighborhood around Lawrence Avenue. Recognized early for her exceptional intellect, Miriam advanced a grade and a half in school, graduating from Von Steuben High School at the age of 16. She attended Adelphi College, the University of Illinois, and Roosevelt College, where she met Martin. They married in 1951, and both obtained masters degrees in psychology at the University of Oregon. Miriam taught middle school math when they moved to Eureka, CA. They soon moved again to Southern California, where Edward and Leah were born. In 1963, Martin accepted the position of psychologist in Pajaro and Santa Cruz school districts, and the family settled into the Temple Beth El Jewish community. Debby was born soon after. The family lived in Japan for two years, and returned home with enduring memories and marvelous stories. Although her children’s love for travel likely began then, Miriam was content to stay put, within the embrace of the Santa Cruz community. After her children left home, Miriam and Martin enjoyed occasional cruises. They were married for 64 years.When her children were in school most of the day, Miriam restarted her career as a psychologist. She worked as a clerk of the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors, then as a county social services eligibility professional assisting elderly clients, and retired after 21 years as a social worker with Santa Cruz County Adult Protective Services. In between, she and Martin took great delight in their growing family’s achievements and adventures. All seven of their grandchildren are immeasurably devoted to their Bubbe and Papa. Miriam will be laid to rest beside Martin, her eternal partner, at Home of Peace cemetery, 422 Meder Street, Santa Cruz, on Wednesday, August 23, at 1 p.m. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made in Miriam’s memory to Hospice of Santa Cruz, Temple Beth El, Doctors Without Borders, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), or the Jewish Community Library."
