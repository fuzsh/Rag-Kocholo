        "text": "Daytime icon, Catherine Hickland who played Lindsay Rappaport on One Life to Live, opened up about where she might fit in if OLTLÂ is rebooted once again.\n\nThree Lives to Live\n\nIf One Life to Live were rebooted again, and ABC is actively looking for platforms on which to air reboots ofÂ OLTL and its sister show, All My Children, Hickland said she’d be love to be involved, she exclusively told Soap CitiesÂ partnerÂ Bryan Vaughan of the WSE Lounge Podcast in an interview.\n\n“Oh, of course!” was her response, to be precise. “One Life to Live was a magical show and a magical bunch of people.”\n\nGet the Latest: On where the efforts to reboot OLTL and AMC are!\n\nWhy, Oh Why?\n\nIn the case of One Life to Live’s cancellation in 2012, the “why” is a man well-known to soap fans by the name of Brian Frons. That was Hickland’s contention, largely recognized as accurate throughout the soap industry and fan community as well.\n\nFrons oversaw daytime programming at the Alphabet Network at the time of OLTL and AMC‘s cancellations. Hickland was not pleased when her own show was canceled, as you might imagine, dear readers.\n\n“I was very vocal, I wrote blogs, I walked in the picket lines with the fansâI went all the way to LA to do that,” the actress recalled.\n\nShe added, and as big OLTL (and AMC) fans we concur, that it was a great trauma for fans to have shows and characters they had invested years, often decades of their lives in, axed and gone in a matter of months.\n\n“It was like a shocking death in the family. People felt so disregarded,” Hickland said. She also noted that it wasn’t so much what was done, which might have been understandable in some scenarios, but the way it was done–with total disregard for the show and itsÂ viewers.\n\nRelated: This OLTL star opened up about his personal struggles and offered hope and help to others!\n\nLook Deep Into My Eyes, Port Charles\n\nWe at Soap Cities think Lindsay could give Ava Jerome a run for her money in the art gallery department, don’t you dear readers?!\n\nSo, when asked if she would ever consider going to General HospitalÂ to open an art gallery onÂ GHÂ like onÂ OLTL, our dearÂ Cat said, “no, but Iâd consider going on GH to be a hypnotist.” Â For those that may not know, Hickland is now a hypnotist in real life!\n\nRelated: This ABC bigwig dished on the continuing effort to bring AMC and OLTL back to our screens!\n\nSeveral AMC and OLTL characters or actors have made their way to Port Charles since ABC regained the rights to those iconic shows. So why not our beloved Lindsay Rappaport from good ol’ Llanview, PA?\n\nWell, we would love to see Hickland back in Port Charles in any capacity! Â Wouldn’t we dear readers?!\n\nMust-Read: This Llanview icon plead guilty in some legal troubles she’s faced of late.\n\nFamily Ties\n\nFrom the warm, ebullient way Hickland spoke of her time on OLTL, it’s clear the actors on the show were family to her.\n\nOf particular significance to this Renaissance woman were:\n\n–Phil Carey (Asa Buchanan), Clint Ritchie (Clint Buchanan), whom she described in glowing terms.\n\n–Robert S. Woods (Bo Buchanan) who once gave her a setside pep talk, noting that she had always successfully memorized and recalled the many pages of dialogue daytime actors have to, and she could again!\n\n–Melissa Archer (Natalie Buchanan), Jessica Morris (Jennifer Rapport), whom she watched grow up on the set and has a special fondness for.\n\n–Timothy D. Stickney, who was concerned that African-American women might have a problem with his on-screen pairing with Hickland. Luckily, Hickland never received anything but positive feedback on the coupling.\n\nWarms your Llanview-lovin’ heart, doesn’t it?\n\nSo, dear readers, what do you think about the prospect of Hickland bringing her hypnotic talents to GH, or reprising the fan faveÂ role of Lindsay Rappaport on a rebooted OLTL.\n\nGive us your input in the comment section below.
