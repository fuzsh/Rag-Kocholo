        "text": "The Pennsylvania Superior Court today denied the appeal of the married veterinarian who admitted killing his pregnant girlfriend.\n\nDavid Adam Rapoport argued he did not verbally give up his Post Conviction Relief Act rights on-the-record following his sentencing and, because of that, he should be able to appeal his conviction.\n\nPolice said the married Rapoport carried on a lengthy affair with Jennifer Lindsay Snyder after meeting her at the Maple Hills Veterinary Clinic in Lower Macungie Township.\n\nBut the affair cooled when Rapoport learned Snyder was pregnant. He shot her three times in March 2011 and dumped her body in a rural part of Lehigh County the day before she was to have her first ultrasound appointment.\n\nRapoport pleaded guilty in December 2011 before Lehigh County Judge Robert Steinberg to two counts of first-degree murder -- one for Snyder, 27, and the other for their unborn son, Athan. Under the plea deal, prosecutors withdrew seeking the death penalty if Rapoport gave up all of his appeal rights. Rapoport completed two written forms - admitting his guilt and waiving his appeal rights -- and was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences.\n\nRapoport filed a Post Conviction Relief Act appeal on his own in December 2012 and a hearing was held July 30, after which Steinberg denied Rapoport's request to appeal his conviction.\n\nRapoport appealed the decision to the state Superior Court, arguing he did not give a verbal, on-the-record waiver of his appeal rights.\n\nSuperior Court Judges Cheryl Lynn Allen, Vic Stabile and Senior Judge Eugene Strassburger III decided the case.\n\nIn an opinion written by Strassburger filed today, the judge states Rapoport's only claim to appeal his case was that he did not give the verbal waiver.\n\nRapoport completed the written form waiving his rights and was asked on-the-record by Steinberg if he reviewed the form, understood it and if he had any questions about it. According to the court transcript included in today's opinion, Rapoport said he reviewed the waiver, understood it and did not have any questions about it.\n\nStrassburger said the court agrees with Steinberg's opinion denying Rapoport's appeal that \"throughout the proceedings, it was evident to (the appellant) that he would be spending the rest of his life in jail without further review by any court.\"\n\n\"With appellant offering absolutely no evidence to the contrary, the PCRA court could not have reasonably reached any other conclusion,\" Strassburger wrote.\n\nDefense attorney John Waldron could not immediately be reached for comment about the decision."
