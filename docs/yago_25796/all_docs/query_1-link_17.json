        "text": "Children: Rachel Gannon (with Hank Gannon), Matthew Rappaport (with Bo Buchanan)\n\nSiblings: Susannah Hanan\n\nSignificant Romantic Relationships: Hank Gannon (1st husband/divorced), Bo Buchanan (2nd husband/divorced), Sam Rappaport, Troy MacIver\n\nNora, a sharp attorney, arrived in Llanview in 1992, following her ex-husband Hank and estranged daughter Rachel. After trying to convince Rachel to return to Chicago and attend college, Nora resigned herself to staying in Llanview in an effort to rebuild her relationship with her daughter, which strengthened over time. Nora met Bo Buchanan and the two shared an instant connection. Nora helped Bo during his depression following the death of his fianc√©e Sarah and agreed to help him find the hit and run driver that killed her. The two grew closer and slowly started to fall in love. Nora had been plagued by severe migraine headaches and occasional blackouts, and slowly she began to suspect that SHE was responsible for killing Sarah, as she had been on the same road that night and blacked out. Just as Bo was about to propose, Nora confessed that she believed she was responsible for killing Sarah. Bo refused to believe it and set about to prove Nora's innocence. He managed to do so and the two were engaged.\n\nNora defended Todd Manning when he was accused of raping Marty Saybrooke, but Nora threw the case when she learned of Todd's guilt. Todd vowed revenge. Soon after Nora learned that a brain tumor was causing her migraines and blackouts. Nora prepared to have surgery, but refused to tell Bo about it. Bo learned about it while Nora was in recovery and vowed to stand by her, declaring his love. As an aftereffect of the surgery, Nora lost her sight while staying alone at a beach house. A vengeful Todd terrorized her and nearly raped her, but Bo managed to rescue Nora. Soon after her blindness was corrected in an operation.\n\nAs Nora and Bo planned their wedding, a thorn in Nora's side arrived in the form of RJ Gannon, her former brother in law. Nora feared Bo's reaction when RJ revealed to Hank that RJ and Nora had slept together during Nora's marriage with Hank. When he learned the truth Bo only told Nora he wished she had felt comfortable enough to be honest upfront. In 1995 Bo and Nora married in a ceremony presided over by Little Richard.\n\nWhen Rachel became addicted to drugs, Nora worked tirelessly to help her daughter beat her addiction. Nora and Bo's marriage entered a rocky patch soon after, as domestic squabbles and Nora's struggles with the possibility of pre-menopause plagued their marriage. A new struggle arrived in the form of Nora's assistant, Georgie Phillips. Georgie developed a crush on Bo, and did everything she could to increase the strain on Bo and Nora's marriage. After Bo rejected her, a vengeful Georgie doctored photographs to make it appear as if she was having an affair with him. Nora found the pictures and went to confront Georgie, whom she found kissing an unidentified man. Nora assumed it was Bo, further widening the gap between them. Georgie was murdered and Bo was arrested. Nora stood by her husband, who was proven innocent. Rachel was revealed as the true culprit, and Nora went on the run with her daughter. Eventually Rachel turned herself in and was sent to prison.\n\nBo and Nora's marriage was back on track when Nora's former love Sam Rappaport came to Llanview. Sam admitted he was still in love with Nora, but Nora was committed to Bo. Nora wanted to have a child, and learned she was still capable of carrying to term. Bo agreed to undergo a test for his sperm count. Lindsay Rappaport, Sam's ex-wife who hated Nora, changed Bo's test results so it appeared he was incapable of fathering a child. Nora and Bo were devastated by the news.\n\nAfter Bo's son Drew was killed, Nora found herself faced with an assault of questions about a possible pregnancy. Worried about Bo's depression over losing a son, her own intense desire for a baby, as well as an overwhelming desire to make those she loved happy, Nora blurted that she was pregnant. Bo and everyone else was ecstatic. Stuck in a lie, a desperate Nora turned to Sam and asked him to father a child for her, one that would be raised by Bo. Sam eventually agreed and slept with Nora. Lindsay discovered and spilled the truth to Bo, who left Nora. The two began divorce proceedings.\n\nNora and Sam began seeing each other and she soon gave birth to a boy, Matthew. Nora learned from Bo's doctor that Bo was indeed capable of fathering a child. Nora told Bo, who had a DNA test performed to see whether he or Sam was the father. Lindsay, who was dating Bo at the time, panicked and paid a lab technician $500,000 to make sure the results stated Sam was the father. While the results indeed stated Sam was the father, Lindsay never discovered whether they had to be altered or not, as the technician fled the country. Nora and Bo officially divorced as Nora began to see Sam more seriously.\n\nNora soon learned that Lindsay had tampered with Bo's original sperm count tests and interrupted Bo and Lindsay's wedding to announce this. Disgusted with Lindsay, Bo dumped her and Lindsay vowed revenge on Nora. Lindsay confessed to Bo that she had altered the DNA tests, so there was a possibility he was Matthew's father. Nora anxiously awaited the new as another paternity test was done on Matthew. The results showed that Sam was the father.\n\nAfter a train wreck which left Nora severely injured, Nora was rushed to a hospital where she lay as an unidentified female. In her delirium, Nora called Lindsay's name, so attending physician Colin MacIver called Lindsay to the hospital. Vengeful and fearful that Nora's return would ruin any chance of reuniting with Bo, Lindsay paid Colin to kidnap Nora and bring her to his home and to tell no one she was alive. As Nora recovered, Lindsay realized that she needed to act fast or Nora would eventually finger her for the kidnapping. Lindsay injected Nora with a drug that erased her memory.\n\nNora was eventually rescued from Colin's, but her lack of memory didn't allow her to bring charges against anyone. Nora struggled to remember her past relationships with the men in her life, particularly Sam and Bo. Her relationship with Sam fizzled as a result of her inability to remember their past. Determined to prove that Lindsay was responsible for her kidnapping and memory loss, Nora cozied up to Colin in an effort to get information on Lindsay. Colin had developed an obsessive crush on Nora and began to display symptoms of mental instability. Colin was soon killed, and Nora believed that Lindsay killed him to protect herself. As Nora brutally cross-examined Lindsay for the murder of Colin, she realized that she herself had killed Colin (who had tried to attack her) and blocked it out! Due to the extenuating circumstances of the case, no charges were filed against Nora. Sam and Nora also reunited.\n\nTroy MacIver, Colin's twin brother, arrived in Llanview. His presence disturbed Nora, but she eventually was able to see past his resemblance to his brother and the two began a friendship, which did not make Sam happy. Wanting to atone for his brother's sins, Troy told Nora that he wanted to prove that Lindsay was responsible for her kidnapping and memory loss. Troy gave Nora a drug which fully restored her memory-except for the traumatic events surrounding her kidnapping and memory loss. Troy proposed the plan of seducing Lindsay and getting her to confess through pillow talk. Nora agreed, although she kept her alliance with Troy a secret from Sam. Nora also found herself developing feelings for Troy and the two even kissed. Eventually Troy was able to get a taped confession from Lindsay, and after she nearly killed him by holding him hostage, Lindsay was placed in a mental institution. Nora came clean with Sam about her plans with Troy and her developing feelings for him. Sam and Nora broke things off, while Nora and Troy embarked on a relationship.\n\nTroy and Nora were blissful, but Troy was keeping a secret from Nora. He feared that Nora would discover that his first wife Joanna had died after a vicious fight with Troy. To some, it might appear as if Troy had upset Joanna so much it drove her to the accident which killed her (she fell off a cliff). Lindsay (released from the mental institution) discovered this secret and threatened to tell Troy. Troy began sleeping with her to keep her quiet, but soon their relationship moved beyond blackmail into the realm of sexual addiction. Nora discovered them in bed together and, disgusted, broke off with Troy.\n\nNora and Matthew were devastated when Sam was killed with a bullet meant for Troy. Troy's mental state began to deteriorate rapidly. Nora suspected him of killing the hospital administrator, Claire. Nora teamed up with Bo's girlfriend Gabrielle to expose Troy's crime. Before his reign of terror was over, Troy took Nora captive and nearly poisoned her in a bizarre suicide pact. Bo saved Nora, while Troy was sent to a mental institution.\n\nBo and Nora were shocked when Gabrielle presented them with a letter from Sam, mailed posthumously. Sam revealed that the second DNA tests to determine Matthew's paternity underwent a clerical error, and Bo was actually Matthew's father. Nora was shocked, but ultimately thrilled that Matthew would have the benefit of knowing Bo as a father.\n\nBo and Nora have been growing closer recently, as both have shared in the joy of raising their son.\n\nBio Page"
