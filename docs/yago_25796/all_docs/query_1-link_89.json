        "text": "“Just let go.”\n\nThere are about 20 chairs lined up tightly on the Expo East Stage at the South Florida Fair, right near the makeshift Goodwill store and the Statue of Liberty sand sculpture. In each chair sits a person who, a half hour ago, might have been scarfing funnel cake or trying to win SpongeBob Squarepants balloons in a game of chance. But now they are here, under lights, in a darkened room in front of friends, family and strangers, taking a different sort of chance — a chance to explore their minds.\n\nYou would not be wrong to read that last bit in a spooky Rod Serling tone. But the voice they are listening to isn’t creepy. It’s pleasant and distinctive, like a warm bath beckoning you to unwind. To let go.\n\n“Relax,” says hypnotist Catherine Hickland, soothingly. “Let go of any tension, any stress. The deeper you go, the better you’ll feel.”\n\nOver the next hour, the striking 57-year-old will take these volunteers, a group eventually whittled to about 15, through a journey of the mind, during which they will play in an imaginary orchestra, compete in a dance audition and, in some cases, answer to the name “E-I-E-I-O,” all at Hickland’s suggestion.\n\nWhile she’s in control on stage, Hickland is a fan of letting herself go to the things that the universe suggests. Her journey took her from South Florida to Hollywood and New York stages and soap opera sets, then to the casinos of Las Vegas where she trained to be a comedy hypnotist. Improbable journey? Maybe. But it’s one she embraces.\n\n“You have to follow your gut. Not your heart. Your heart will lie to you,” she says. “You have to be willing to go there … I’m doing this to help people.”\n\nA graduate of Fort Lauderdale High School, Hickland’s appeared in Broadway musicals, including “Les Misérables;” has released a CD; started her own cosmetics line, Cat Cosmetics; and written a book called “The 30 Day Heartbreak Cure — A Guide to Getting Over Him and Back Out There One Month From Today.”\n\nBut she’s best known as a soap star on “Texas,” “Loving,” “The City” and “One Life To Live,” where she played Lindsay Rappaport, a perennial schemer locked into a decade-long rivalry with the show’s heroic lawyer Nora Hanen (played by fellow South Floridian soap star, Palm Beach’s Hillary B. Smith).\n\nSo how did she get from there to here? Young Catherine’s first exposure to her eventual livelihood was through platinum blonde Pat Collins, who billed herself as “the Hip Hypnotist” and demonstrated her craft on TV shows like “The Hollywood Squares” and “The Merv Griffin Show” in the 1960s and ’70s.\n\nThe idea of a woman navigating a field of mostly men “turned me on. As I recognized what this was about, it was like ‘Wow!’”\n\nShe began investigating hypnotism, “not for the stage, but to understand the mind like that. It was very dramatic to me. I went to the library and read about it, practiced it with my friends.”\n\nBut however strong the pull of the mind, Hickland also felt the practical call of the entertainment industry and her burgeoning acting career. She loved it, but “after 28 years, I needed to get a life,” she says, laughing. “I didn’t want to return to 80 hours a week on TV.”\n\nSo she left the lights to go to hypnosis school on Staten Island, then in Los Angeles. Having been an entertainer for most of her life, she knew she had to combine the two, so she headed to the place where hypnosis and entertainment got married, just like all the drunk and nervous casino patrons — Las Vegas. It made sense, but it didn’t seem, at first, like a fit.\n\n“It was the last city I imagined myself living,” she says. “But five years ago I left New York, and then I met my husband six months later. If I had been in New York, I would still be waiting for something to happen.”\n\nJust like you wouldn’t trust a hair dresser with bad hair, you probably shouldn’t trust someone to put you under who doesn’t enjoy being hypnotized. And Hickland is not one of those, because “I love it! I’m a typical hypno junkie. You’re in a dream state, really relaxed but in a conscious state.”\n\nHer transition has been not only employment, but personal. Hickland, who was once married to actor David Hasselhoff, wed director and industry veteran Todd Fisher, son of legends Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher, in 2012. The two had attended the same church, and then found each other again after years through Facebook.\n\nAnd last year, she drove cross country to make it to her mother’s bedside before she passed away, “with my pet chicken, Chickie, in the car because nobody would let me fly with her. She was in and out of a coma, basically, but when she would wake up the nurse would give her the phone and she’d say ‘How’s the chicken?’”\n\nHickland’s mother held on until she got there, and her daughter believes that was planned, that it was ordained, just like she believes the turns and twists in her life are.\n\n“I’m propelled to a purpose,” she said. “My ego doesn’t need this. This is what I need to do to make a difference.”\n\nThe voice-over introduction for Hickland’s show mentions her film, stage and TV credits, and there is an audible hum of recognition when her “One Life To Live” role is mentioned. She says she knows that while some audience members are just attracted to the subject of hypnosis or anything mysterious, others are intrigued that their favorite soap diva is there.\n\n“Having been Lindsay, they know who I am and trust me. That makes them feel safe,” she says. “They’re probably like ‘What the heck is going on? What’s she doing?’ Others are curious people who want to see if they can be hypnotized. It’s rare. You don’t just open the newspaper and find a hypnotist’s show.”\n\nWhen her local show ends this weekend, Hickland will head back to Vegas, where she teaches seminars on hypnosis, then get back on the road. All of this might seem surprising to Lindsay Rappaport fans. But not to her.\n\n“I expected that something would happen. I wish that everyone knew to their core that you are limitless is rebirthing yourself,” she says. “There’s something new. There’s nothing wrong with retiring. I just have too much energy to do that.”"
