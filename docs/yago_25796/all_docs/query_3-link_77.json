        "text": "Soap fans are in for a real treat on next week’s One Life to Live when the Statesville prison break takes front and center stage depositing some of the show’s greatest all-time baddies smack dab in front of, and causing havoc for, some of the major citizens of Llanview! Among them, the fantastic Catherine Hickland as Lindsay Rappaport who is back, and whose long running feud with Nora Buchanan is soap-legendary!\n\nHickland spoke with TV Guide to reveal some details on her return, and for sticking up for the fans right after and through the gut-wrenching cancellation and decision by ABC to rid the daytime line-up of two landmark shows: All My Children, and One Life to Live. Here are a few excerpts below!\n\nCatherine on how Lindsay makes a beeline to former flame Bo Buchanan after the prison break: “It’s sort of ambiguous. I’m not being coy. I really couldn’t tell from the script. But, yeah, I got to work with Bob and Hillary B. Smith [Nora] and Ty Treadway a bit. For me, it was a satisfying ending for my character. I liked the idea of playing Lindsay one more time. That character has a place in history on that show, that’s for sure. Though, at that point, Prospect Park was still planning to take the show to the Internet. I was happy to wrap it up, or leave it open. Whatever they had in mind.”\n\nCatherine on being so vocal on her blog and throughout the devastating news of the cancellations of AMC & OLTL, and taking part in the picket lines: ” I was happy to be out there! I didn’t really care if I ever acted again so, for me, it was no big deal. Everyone else at OLTL and AMC was under gag order and had the fear of God put into them. There was nothing keeping me from telling the truth. When I saw our wonderful viewers being yanked around like that I just couldn’t take it anymore. They are the bread and butter of this business, the very reason soaps have remained on the air for decades, and they deserved to know what’s really going on. I guess that was the reason behind my snap, so to speak. I just didn’t have any idea it would be so far reaching and cause such a fuss. I was just saying my thoughts, blogging like I have for ages. I spent a lot of years at OLTL being told, “Don’t say this. Don’t say that.” This is America, may I remind everybody. To not be able to speak your mind is very frustrating. If you don’t let your feelings out, that’s where sickness lies. I had already moved on. It’s not like I felt anyone owed me a career. It wasn’t about that at all. I just felt that the audience was owed simple respect, something we all owe each other — in business and in life.”\n\nAre you excited to see Catherine as Lindsay for an encore performance next week? Let us know!\n\nIt was 35 years ago on this day, August 20th, 1989, that Lyle and Erik Menendez shot and killed their parents Kitty and Jose Menendez in their home in Beverly Hills.\n\nNow on August 20th, 2024, the highly-anticipated limited series Monsters season two from Ryan Murphy, unveils the premiere date for the story centering around the brothers and the murder case along with its first trailer.\n\nGeneral Hospital fans are extremely excited and intrigued for the upcoming series, and to see Nicholas Chavez (ex-Spencer Cassadine) in one of the leading roles as Lyle Menendez.\n\nMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story drops on Netflix beginning on September 19th. Chavez took to his Instagram account and posted the trailer accompanied by his words in the post, “So excited holy heck!”\n\nSeptember will be a busy month for Chavez fans as not only can he be seen on Monsters, but also as previously revealed, Nicholas is part of the cast of another Ryan Murphy series, Grotesquerie in which he plays Father Charlie. The horror drama will air on Wednesdays starting September 25 on FX and then the next day on Hulu.\n\nChavez finished his three-year run as GH’s Spencer Cassadine back at the beginning of 2024 when on-screen the character went overboard while trying to save the love of his life Trina (Tabyana Ali) and is presumed dead.\n\nIn ‘Monsters,’ the series delves into how the Menendez Brothers, who were aged 21 and 18 when they committed the crime. claimed they acted in self-defense, after years of physical and sexual abuse. However, the prosecution argued that their motive was greed and the desire to inherit their parents’ fortune. The trials lasted for months and the brothers were charged for their actions. They are currently at the R J Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, California.\n\nAlong with Chavez, the cast includes: Javier Bardem and Chloë Sevigny as parents Jose and Kitty Menendez, and Cooper Koch as Erik Menendez. The series also stars: Nathan Lane as Dominick Dunne, Ari Graynor as Leslie Abramson, Leslie Grossman as Judalon Smyth, Dallas Roberts as Dr. Jerome Oziel, Jason Butler Harner as Les Zoeller, Enrique Murciano as Carlos Baralt, Michael Gladis as Tim Rutten, Drew Powell as Detective Tom Linehan, Charlie Hall as Craig Cignarelli, Gil Ozeri as Dr. William Vicary, Jeff Perry as Peter Hoffman, Tessa Auberjonois as Dr. Laurel Oziel, Tanner Stine as Perry Berman, Larry Clarke as Brian Andersen, Jade Pettyjohn as Jamie Pisarcik, and Marlene Forte as Marta Cano.\n\nYou can check out the official trailer/date announcement for Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story below.\n\nNow let us know, if you are excited to finally see Nicholas Chavez in his starring role via the comment section.\n\nOn Monday, during a press conference held by Los Angeles County prosecutors, two of the four suspects in the death of Johnny Wactor (ex-Brando Corbin) have now been officially charged with the murder of the beloved General Hospital actor.\n\nThe charges were announced by L.A. County District Attorney George Gascón and interim police chief Dominic Choi. The suspects charged with Wactor’s murder are Robert Barceleau and Sergio Estrada, both 18.\n\nThe most serious charge is for Barceleau, who was charged with murder, including a special circumstance allegation of killing in the commission of a robbery, which could lead to a life-without-parole prison term. He was also charged with attempted robbery and grand theft, both with allegations he was armed with a firearm.\n\nEstrada, was also charged with murder, but without the special circumstance allegation. He was also charged with attempted robbery and grand theft, both also allegedly while armed with a firearm. Estrada is also facing a life sentence.\n\nThe two other suspects were also formally charged, Leonel Gutierrez, also 18 was charged with attempted robbery and grand theft by embezzlement, both with allegations he was armed. Meanwhile, Frank Olano, 22, was charged with being an accessory after the fact to the killing, along with receiving stolen property and three counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm.
