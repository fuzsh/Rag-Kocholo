Demob Happy have been making brash, urgent and pushy waves in the Brighton music scene for the past year or so, leaving behind an uproar of mayhem, sweat and energy on their recent UK tour. Their most recent single ‘Young & Numb‘ is a trashy breath of fresh air, gnarling and scowling like The Stooges era ‘Funhouse‘ and a raucous MC5. Before ‘Young & Numb‘ has finished rattling around inside your head as if leftover from the 70s, they stumble towards the 90s slacker era Beck B-side ‘I Wanna Be A Hippy‘.

2014’s debut single was the sludgy bass-driven ‘Succubus‘, a gritty, off-kilter stoner grunge anthem. The lyrics take on modern day anxieties of consumerism whether that is physical or ideological. Front man Matt Marcantonio sings with the sarcastic energy of Kurt Cobain – “Television on/Makes my body numb taking care of me/Being watched by BBC”. Second single ‘Suffer You‘ was another ramshackle affair which takes inspiration from Dinosaur Jr and Pavement.

The DIY ethos is integral within the band – whether that be looking like an extra from your favourite 90s slacker film, (by shopping only at their local Oxfam), shooting music videos for £10, or putting together a last minute gig outside their tour van (when the venue cancels their shows). This fits in line with the craze of throw-back for everything 90s – not that the band care what year it is – and clearly just want to have a good time. This sets Demob Happy apart from the worn out tie-dyed denims and rainy day 90s rock reprise for a brisk, chaotic and vibrant take on the sound.

Demob Happy = to feel elated and carefree, fitting?
