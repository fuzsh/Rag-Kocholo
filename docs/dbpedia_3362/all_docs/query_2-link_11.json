        "text": "Alternative rock trio Demob Happy are thinkers, they like detail and hard work. But they could not have predicted the way in which they would take these qualities forward when the work on their third studio album began. It was an intense period of adapting to change and big decisions needed to be taken.\n\nPrior to 2020 they toured North America with bands and artists they admire. It was a time loaded with special moments and a time when standalone events unfolded. With live shows across America, playing alongside Jack White, contributing to improvisational sessions live, and sharing the stage with Nothing But Thieves, they were living the dream.\n\nBacked by a new label, ‘Divine Machines’ is the compelling product of a renewed focus for the band. Lockdown was there, it was real, it was inescapable, yet somehow it seems like the new record could have been made at any point, it’s not a result of lockdown or about the pandemic, but in some ways the conditions helped the Newcastle trio, they understood how to use that time to their advantage.\n\nClash caught up with vocalist, songwriter and producer Matthew Marcantonio and guitarist Adam Godfrey to understand just how they made things happen.\n\n—\n\n—\n\nIt has been nearly ten years for Demob Happy. What’s the personal bond that glues everything together for you as a band?\n\nMM: Everyone’s on the same level, everyone wants the same thing. We always had quite disparate things going on in our careers, there’s this we’re going into chaos energy, but we also have this nice route to be kind because everyone runs in the same race.\n\nThe sound on ‘Divine Machines’ is highly consistent. The work process was different to the way you normally work, what was it like?\n\nMM: We had some demos that we loved, we believe that there’s magic in writing for the first time, it’s on another level of sweetness. We had a listening session with mates, it was after the first lockdown, before the second, it was a nice to do stuff. We put it on the speakers, we had coffee and just loved it. We had also signed a deal. We thought, let’s go and have some fun, put some energy back into the songs.\n\nAG: It was the idea of blending the old with the new, in a satisfying way. It was fun, it was easy, we didn’t struggle. Details are important to us, but we’ve never had much time to focus on a record, normally it’s two-three weeks, we tend to struggle with that, we want more time. It was a good process, it’s interesting that we enjoyed all that time of work, we created an atmosphere, and each song has that.\n\n—\n\n—\n\nWhat inspired the album? What music were you listening to at the time, and did that influence the sound?\n\nMM: When you hear a song like ‘Token Appreciation Society’, flavours of the bands that influenced it are in there, and what’s more, we played around with this riff, putting this out. It has tight drums, it’s powerful, hypnotic in a wider sense. We listen to all sorts of music, I have phases where I’m into modern psych or I go back to the classics, the ‘60s and ‘70s, and then I’ll enjoy some ‘80s music.\n\nMM: We have a language between us, we all come from a similar place, but we’re different enough, and we bring different things. It’s more when we discuss that, as if we’re thinking of an atmosphere of ‘let’s make this into something like this or that’. For example, one song was very different before we went into the studio, but it actually changed the most. It didn’t quite have an identity, we knew there were some killer hooks, and we managed to transform it.\n\nIt must be the best feeling in the world, when you overcome creative challenges like that.\n\nAG: It’s a lovely feeling of spontaneity. It was cool to have a moments like that on the album. It was spontaneous, because it did feel marginal, but it just captured that shuffle, it’s got synth. And a T. Rex vibe.\n\nYou – MM – have taken on more production duties. Is it rewarding to be involved and not leave the production to somebody else.\n\nMM: I had always been working on the computer and enjoyed that element. We have always had a strong idea about how we want to record, but through immaturity, naivety or lack of confidence, we’ve always known or felt we don’t quite have the language and the technical jargon, technique to put through the effect needed. You’re trying to describe the people we’ve worked with, describe abstract musical things in language, it doesn’t always translate. We’ve had a lot of frustration where it didn’t sound how we wanted it, what we’ve known intuitively, but it’s not that we haven’t enjoyed working with other people.\n\nMM: People have their own vision. I just don’t feel we necessarily found that or had an idea of what we wanted. That’s not to say that the work was bad, and we’ve had great producers, but the creative visions haven’t always aligned. We’ve been figuring out what it is we like, and how to get it. What you need to do to get a particular sound, a particular vibe for a new record.\n\n—\n\n—\n\nThe record has interesting themes, and ‘Token Appreciation Society’ tackles one, is there a link between them all?\n\nMM: It’s about tokenistic gestures of appreciation. We live in false times, tokenistic planning is what the song’s about. I write from a place of what I’ve experienced. Each song has its own theme, there isn’t necessarily a unified one, it’s things at the top of my mind, mirroring the world through my lens. I have a process where I come up with ideas intuitively, I don’t think about lyrics until the end of the process. The melody comes first, I’ll find words that phonetically fit the melody, if themes or lyrical themes appear, great, most of the time they do by accident. Nine times out of ten times I will find an intuitive, subconscious part that I’d already written with a theme.\n\nLockdown was a gigantic deal, yet the record doesn’t seem to tackle that.\n\nMM: It was lockdown, it was unavoidable, but the pandemic wasn’t the focus. Wanting to heal, wanting to heal certain aspects of myself from a therapeutic place, hoping that it would heal other people, because what lockdown gave all of us was introspection and space. I enjoy being introspective. I spend time thinking about my philosophy, examining myself and studying my thoughts. I enjoy that space for self-therapy, the songs almost became a part of that. It’s our introspection looking at the society in the world.\n\nThe band toured the States before the pandemic, which must have been a dream. You played big shows alongside great artists. How different was your experience of playing to American crowds?\n\nAG: People in America treated us like Americans, it’s that ‘I’m going to show everyone that I love it. I’m not gonna be too cool, too cool to show it, attitude. That’s a delight when you’re playing to new audiences, it’s much easier, less hard to convince them. We’ve also got loads of amazing fans in the UK.\n\nMM: We’ve never had ridiculous marketing budgets, we’ve never had the nepotism, the more likely backdoor to go straight onto Radio 1, that’s never been the journey. For us it’s all about the long, organic route, and the people, who are our fans. We’re doing our thing over here, if you want to join in, we’ll happily let you in. People can see that we’ve never played the game, we do our own thing, it has made this journey longer, bumpier, with more hurdles, but it’s worth it.\n\nThe experience of playing alongside Jack White must have felt undeniable.\n\nAG: That’s a great moment to think back on. I’ll tell people about what felt like a badge of honour.\n\nMM: It was. We bumped into him and we said hello, it was very cordial. It was only on the last night in Edinburgh that we properly hung out. He’d invited us on stage to jam along with them, seeing what was needed to pull this off, the dueling guitars, chucking in the chords and piano playing. Piano was the first instrument for me, I can play, and Jack came up to me telling me to play piano.\n\n—\n\n—\n\nWhat do you think of Jack White’s back to basics (no mobile phones) approach?\n\nAG: It’s funny, it almost feels like a dream, it banned people from bringing their phones in, so there’s no filming. There’s literally three pictures of the whole thing, that’s all that exists.\n\nMM: We like it! People should be focusing on the music itself, and not look at their phones. I’ve not seen loads of people at our shows on their phones. Jack White does a lot of improvising on his songs. I just thought, play along, we’ll make mistakes to improvise, and that’s ok. Encouraging people to engage is good in the long run, it’s healthy, you get so much more out of the moment.\n\nMM: Being present, you’re engaging through art, engaging people’s consciousness, making them feel present. I’m sure when Jack’s in the studio recording, he’s into the detail as well as perfection. When you’re playing live, mistakes are made, especially when you improvise, and that’s expected.\n\nDemob Happy have things in common with the bands they play alongside, it’s not just people you admire, you share their values.\n\nMM: It’s that ethical approach. We have the same ideologies and philosophies, people are admiring of us, and we’re learning from them. It’s trying to be present in an age when no one is, it’s complete destruction. It’s easy to get wrapped up in ourselves, but it’s about sharing moments. How can you expect people to be present and give their attention to your music, if you weren’t ever present?! It’s a trade, an eye for an eye…\n\nAG: When we go to Wales, we go places with no phone signal on purpose, because we’re all distracted by phones all the time, it’s too much of a temptation. It’s not often that we’re all together, it builds an atmosphere around us, we know where our heads are at. We’re on the same page.\n\n—\n\n—\n\nDemob Happy’s new album ‘Divine Machines’ is out now."
