        "text": "Maputo, 16 Jun (AIM) – The Confederation of Mozambican Business Associations (CTA), the country’s main business organization, believes that the closure of the last Renamo military base in Vanduzi, in Gorongosa district, in the central province of Sofala, will attract more international investors, as well as national ones.\n\nThe base was closed on Thursday, under the DDR (Demobilization, Disarmament and Reintegration) programme between the Mozambican government and Renamo, the main opposition party. Since 2019, a total of 16 Renamo bases have been dismantled.\n\nAccording to a note sent to the media, the CTA “recognizes and welcomes the efforts, spirit of initiative, commitment, engagement, political will and humility of President Filipe Nyusi, aimed at achieving and promoting effective peace for Mozambicans, through dialogue with various living forces in our society, and particularly with the leadership of Renamo, through successive negotiations started with the late Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama and now continued and concluded in coordination with General Ossufo Momade, the current President of Renamo.”\n\nThe note also claims that, with the end of the DDR and the consequent elimination of uncertainty that the existence of armed men represented, the necessary conditions have been created to guarantee the country’s greater attractiveness as a preferential and safe destination for foreign and national investment.\n\nThe message comes at a moment when the CTA and the Mozambican government are moving towards holding the 18th Annual Conference of the Private Sector (CASP).\n\n“The CTA reiterates its commitment to advocacy for the improvement of the business environment and the promotion of economic competitiveness in Mozambique”, stresses the document.\n\nThe end of the Renamo bases does not solve all of Nyusi’s military headaches. The demobilization of Renamo does not affect the situation in the northern province of Cabo Delgado, where islamist terrorists continue to wage war against the Mozambican state and its allies from Rwanda and from SADC (Southern African Development Community).\n\n(AIM)\n\nAd/pf"
