        "text": "J. Barnett Inside the Treasury 138: Demob Happy The politics of 1978 were deeply influenced by the prospect of a General Election. R. Collins Television 13: Obviously demob-happy at the end of his period of office at Channel 4 [etc.]. Guardian 17 Jul. üåê Question time today was hot and noisy. It was the last of the summer season, and MPs were behaving like schoolboys at the end of term. Many of them will be getting out their buckets and spades in the next few days, and some looked demob happy at the prospect. J. Clune Man of the Month Club 60: The hollow feeling was subsiding, squashed out by the fug of beer and the jollity of the Friday evening demob-happy crowd. L. McIlvanney All the Colours 55: ‚ÄòAnyway, we‚Äôre not all demob happy. Some of us have our work to go to‚Äô. J. Meades Empty Wigs (t/s) 678: The pigs [...] went in search of liberty and scran, trotted down Temegate with a demob-happy swagger.\n\nJ. Maclaren-Ross ‚ÄòThe Dark Diceman‚Äô in Bitten by the Tarantula (2005) 212: A seedy young man in a frayed collar and a shiny demob suit. B.S. Johnson All Bull 2: The 1948 National Service Acts [...] did away with demob suits and gratuities. (con. 1940s) D. Nobbs Second From Last in the Sack Race 92: His demob suit hanging off him like wool on a dying sheep. (con. 1940s) P. Cumper One Bright Child 81: This is my demob suit, my only suit. A. Sillitoe Birthday 18: A young soldier in his early twenties, he queued to be measured for his demob suit. L. McIlvanney All the Colours 68: Orchardton‚Äôs dad had come over [...] in 1946 with a suitcase and a demob suit."
