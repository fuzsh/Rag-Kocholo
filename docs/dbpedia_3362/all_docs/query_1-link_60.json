        "text": "ROBERT HOLMES - the complete credits\n\nNothing whatsoever to do with Euston, but in the spirit of celebrating classic British TV I thought it might be interesting to try and draw together all the credits amassed by the screenwriter Robert Holmes, justly celebrated for his work as both writer and script editor of Doctor Who, but who also worked on many other television series, some very famous, some largely forgotten, over a period of almost 30 years (1958-1987).\n\nSome brief biographical data: Robert (Colin) Holmes was born on 2 April, 1926. In 1944 he joined the army, becoming the youngest ever commissioned officer in the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders and serving in Burma. After demob he joined the police and eventually on to court work, where he left the force to become a court reporter and journalist. Working in the Midlands as a sports journalist in the mid-1950s, he became the final editor of the famous \"John Bull\" magazine, and started to write sample scripts for popular TV series.\n\nHis first credits for television are alleged to have been four episodes of the popular twice-weekly ATV hospital drama Emergency - Ward 10 in 1958, but I can find no record of these. His regular work on this show doesn't come until 1962.\n\nIn September 1959, he began work as Story Editor on a new Granada series called Knight Errant '59, kind of a precursor to The Equalizer but probably without the violence or Stewart Copeland theme tune. Credits will run chronologically as regards the first episode of each different series he worked on.\n\nKnight Errant ‘59, becoming Knight Errant ‘60 [Series 1]/Knight Errant Ltd [Series 2] (Granada 1959-1961, 75 x 50m)\n\nCrime drama series following the private investigations of the Knight Errant agency.\n\nStory Editor (1959-60), plus writer:\n\n1.19 “The Creditor” (16.02.1960)\n\n1.29 “The Wall of Death” (26.04.1960)\n\n1.31 “Brother Cain” (10.05.1960)\n\n1.37 “The King of Kandoga” (01.07.1960)\n\nHarpers West One (ATV 1961-63, 32 x 50m)\n\nWeekly soap opera set in a large West End department store, created by John Whitney & Geoffrey Bellman. Tagline: “Shopping with the lid off!”\n\n1.02 tx 03.07.1961\n\n2.10 tx 19.11.1962\n\n2.14 tx 24.12.1962\n\nFamily Solicitor (ATV 1961, 24 x 50m)\n\nSeries starring Robert Flemyng and A J Brown as, respectively, Anthony Freeman and William Naylor, the senior partners in solictors' firm \"Naylor and Freeman\". Also starring a 34 year-old Geoffrey Palmer as junior solicitor Hugh Cowley. Produced by Jack Williams.\n\n1.05 “Man of Straw” (26.07.1961)\n\n1.07 “Strike Action” (09.08.1961)\n\n1.20 “Statement of Affairs” (09.11.1961)\n\nDeadline Midnight (ATV 1960-1961, 39 x 50m)\n\nDrama series featuring the characters and events involved in the workings of a national newspaper, the Daily Globe. Sounds good, actually.\n\n2.17 “Man in a Frame” (30.9.1961)\n\nEmergency – Ward 10 (ATV 1957-1967)\n\nA stupendous 50 episodes tx between 19 June 1962 and 20 December 1963\n\nDr Finlay’s Casebook (BBC/BBC One, 1962-1971)\n\nVery famous drama series created by A. J. Cronin, about the doctors of a country practice in the Scottish village of Tannochbrae. Starring Bill Simpson as Finlay, the junior partner in the practice, Andrew Cruickshank as Dr. Cameron, the craggy senior partner, and Barbara Mullen as unflappable housekeeper/receptionist Janet.\n\n2.33 “The Hallelujah Stakes” (10.5.1964)\n\n2.36 “The Old Indomitable” (31.5.1964)\n\n2.40 “The Doctor Cried” (28.6.1964)\n\n3.07 “Charity, Dr Finlay” (14.2.1965)\n\nNo Hiding Place (Associated-Rediffusion 1959-1967, 236 episodes)\n\nBeing the adventures of Detective Chief Superintendent Tom Lockhart of Scotland Yard, played by Raymond Francis. The character of Lockhart had already toplined no less than two earlier series, Murder Bag (1957-59) and Crime Sheet (1959). Spin-offs are fun.\n\n7.07 “Blood and Water” (15.3.1965)\n\n7.21 “A Cry for Help” (24.6.1965)\n\n8.07 “Run Johnnie, Run” (15.12.1965)\n\n9.07 “The Night Walker” (15.6.1966)\n\n9.10 “Golden Boy” (6.7.1966)\n\n10.12 “Who is this Mortimer?” (8.6.1967)\n\nUndermind (ABC 1965, 11 x 50m)\n\nRobert Banks Stewart-devised series about a group of extra-terrestrials attempting to undermine human society from within.

Shades of Invasion of the Body Snatchers and the still-to-come US series The Invaders.\n\n1.10 “Waves of Sound” (10.7.1965)\n\n1.11 “End Signal” (17.7.1965)\n\nINVASION (feature film!) (Merton Park Studios, classified \"U\" by the BBFC on 21.10.1965)\n\nWritten by Roger Marshall from an original story by Robert Holmes. Produced by Jack Greenwood and directed by Alan Bridges.\n\nThe unexpected arrival of an alien space traveller creates problems at a rural hospital. Starring The Day the Earth Caught Fire's Edward Judd with Valerie Gearon, Lyndon Brook, Barrie Ingham and Yoko Tani. Ultra-low budget and quite dull, but interesting in that several story elements were reused by Holmes for Doctor Who - \"Spearhead from Space\" four years later.\n\nIntrigue (ABC 1966, 13 x 50m)\n\nIndustrial espionage drama series starring Edward Judd (so soon?) as a freelance security expert, Gavin Grant. Created by Tony Williamson.\n\n1.08 “Fifty Million Taste Buds Can’t Be Wrong” (19.11.1966)\n\nMr Rose (Granada 1967-8, approx. 26 x 50m)\n\nWilliam Mervyn starred as retired Chief Inspector Charles Rose, a character who had featured in two earlier Granada crime series, The Odd Man (1962-3) and It’s Dark Outside (1964-5). There should be far more such jumping about from series to series for television characters nowadays.\n\n1.05 “The Jolly Swagman” (17.3.1967)\n\n1.06 “The Unquiet Ghost” (24.3.1967)\n\n2.01 “The Frozen Swede” (31.5.1968)\n\nMarket in Honey Lane (ATV 1967-68, 26 x 50m)\n\nDrama-soap series, created by Louis Marks, set in a London street market.

Adventure serial recounting tales of a fictitious British batallion in Northern India during the 1880s. Produced by Michael Chapman.\n\n1.06 “Mutiny” (04.09.1968)\n\nHoney Lane (ATV 1968-69, 52 x 25m / 13 x 40m)\n\nTwice-weekly afternoon half-hour revamp of Market in Honey Lane (see above). Weekly again from Series Two.\n\nAt least 16 episodes over a 10-month period:\n\nS1, E07 tx 22.10.1968\n\nS1, E08 tx 28.10.1968\n\nS1, E17 tx 26.11.1968\n\nS1, E18 tx 28.11.1968\n\nS1, E25 tx 24.12.1968\n\nS1, E26 tx 26.12.1968\n\nS1, E33 tx 20.01.1969\n\nS1, E34 tx 22.01.1969\n\nS1, E41 tx 17.02.1969\n\nS1, E42 tx 18.02.1969\n\nS1, E46 tx 04.03.1969\n\nS1, E49 tx 17.03.1969\n\nS1, E50 tx 18.03.1969\n\nS2, E02 tx 17.07.1969\n\nS2, E06 tx 14.08.1969\n\nS2, E09 tx 04.09.1969\n\nSeries ended on E13 – possibly others written by Holmes\n\nThe Saint (ATV 1962-9, 118 x 50m)\n\nThe most famous screen incarnation of Leslie Charteris’ modern day Robin Hood, starring Roger Moore as Simon Templar.\n\n6.11 “The Scales of Justice” (1.12.1968)\n\nDoctor Who (BBC tv/BBC1 1963-89, 695 episodes usually of 25m)\n\nThe granddaddy of this list obviously.
