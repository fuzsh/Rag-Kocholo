        "text": "Project Description\n\nThe Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) program for Ethiopia was initiated as a crucial step towards implementing the peace agreement signed between the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) on 2nd November 2022 in South Africa. This agreement ended the long-standing conflict that had arisen between the TPLF and the central government in Ethiopia, resulting in widespread violence and displacement.\n\nThe objective of the DDR program is to facilitate the disarmament of former combatants from Tigray, Amhara and Afar, their demobilization and eventual reintegration into civilian life. The program is geared towards restoring peace, promoting reconciliation and creating a conducive environment for sustainable development. Eventual areas of coverage will go beyond Northern Ethiopia and cover other regions of Ethiopia.\n\nThe Government of Ethiopia has mandated and created the “National Rehabilitation Commission (NRC)” which is responsible for design, planning, implementation, and monitoring of the DDR programme in the country. The overall DDR beneficiaries identified are 371,971. The Government has planned implementation of the programme. In Phase 1, a total of 75,000 combatants will be demobilized in 2024 and the balance will be demobilized in 2025.\n\nUNDP is supporting the NRC in close coordination with various national and international partners, including the United Nations, non-governmental organizations, and other actors. It is expected that the DDR program will provide an opportunity for the combatants in North Ethiopia to turn their focus towards peaceful and productive activities, thereby contributing to the overall stability and development of the North Ethiopia region.\n\nThe DDR program has close linkages with the National Dialogue, Transitional Justice, and Peace Support programme.
