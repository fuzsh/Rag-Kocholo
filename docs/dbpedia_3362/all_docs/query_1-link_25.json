        "text": "A chronicle of a formative era in British broadcasting following World War II. Hitherto, radio output had been genteel and sedate, in the music hall tradition. But after 1945, a new generation of producers, writers and performers emerged, making radical, sometimes anti-establishment comedies including The Goons and Hancock's Half Hour. Also at this time, the dominance of radio was challenged by the re-emergence of television and the BBC's TV monopoly ended with the arrival of ITV in 1955."
