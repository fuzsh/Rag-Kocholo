        "text": "Demob redirects here. For the television series, see TV series. For the British punk rock band see band. See also D Mob.\n\nDemobilization or demobilisation (see spelling differences) is the process of standing down a nation's armed forces from combat-ready status. This may be as a result of victory in war, or because a crisis has been peacefully resolved and military force will not be necessary. The opposite of demobilization is mobilization. Forceful demobilization of a defeated enemy is called demilitarization.\n\nIn the final days of World War II, for example, the United States Armed Forces developed a demobilization plan which would discharge soldiers on the basis of a point system that favoured length and certain types of service. The British armed forces were demobilised according to an 'age-and-service' scheme.[1]\n\nThe phrase demob happy refers to demobilization and is broadly applied to the feeling of relief at imminent release from a time-serving burden, such as a career.[2] In the Russian language it is known as dembel and has become a certain tradition in the Soviet and post-Soviet Armed Forces. A United States equivalent is \"short-timer's disease\", comparable to \"senioritis\" among United States high-school students.\n\nSee also[]\n\nMilitary discharge\n\n19th of April Movement\n\nDemobilization of United States armed forces after World War II"
