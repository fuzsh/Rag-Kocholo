However, this strict regime helped foster a group identity and brought recruits closer together.\n\nOfficers who did four years or more on a Short Service Commission were allowed to train in a speciality. Many other ranks were trained in general clerical duties, such as typing.\n\nSome received more specific training in technical subjects, such as communications and engineering. Languages could also be learnt - especially Russian in the Cold War period - at the Joint Service School of Languages at Bodmin.\n\nNew dangers\n\nFor those deployed to a war zone, the possibility of death was suddenly part of daily life.\n\nThe experience many men had of being thrown into combat situations, such as in Korea, Malaya and Suez, would never be forgotten. Men with minimal training were expected to fight guerrillas or cope with riots or civil war situations.\n\nBetween 1947 and 1963, a total of 395 National Servicemen were killed on active service."
