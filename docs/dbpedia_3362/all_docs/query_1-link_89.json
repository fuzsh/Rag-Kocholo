        "text": "1951 -2010; 2018-2024. Amazon owned from 2024.\n\n(the studios did not accept bookings between 2010 and 2017 but now have a secure future.)\n\n(Revised July 2024)\n\nBray studios will forever be associated with Hammer horror films but those were only a relatively small part of the studios’ history. Although set up as a film studio, after a while the stages were being used used to make a number of TV dramas and in latter years some multicamera sitcoms, a kids’ gameshow and a lottery gameshow for the BBC. They were also a favourite location for bands to rehearse tours. Famously, on one occasion in 2007, David Gilmour was in one big stage and Roger Waters was in the other with his band. They met, inevitably, and rather uncomfortably, outside one day and the encounter was filmed. (Watch it on YouTube). Although they had performed a couple of years before when Pink Floyd were reunited for Live 8, this filmed conversation demonstrates quite nicely that their relationship remained somewhat frosty.\n\nBut – back to the beginning. Down Place, a distinctive mansion beside the Thames between Windsor and Maidenhead, was owned by one Jacob Tonson. He, by the way, formed the ‘Kit-Kat Club’ which had nothing to do with chocolate bars. The club didn’t meet here, despite what you might have read, but in Tonson’s London residence. The house was a private dwelling until 1951 when one wing remained privately occupied, as it still does.\n\nThe house consisted of several parts – the original square shaped house built early in the 18th century – seen on the right in the photo below. Then later that century a long wing was added facing the river, containing a ballroom. That is the façade with the curved porch on the left in the photo below. Another wing extends away from the river further left – that is still occupied as private dwellings.\n\nOther outbuildings were added and joined up with the original stable block to form one large mansion. Its design included castellations along the roof line. These were ultimately its downfall. Rather than a conventional gutter, rainwater has to run along a channel behind the top of the wall, which can easily become blocked. This caused many leaks into the attic and down the internal walls over the years as the house was poorly maintained by all its owners. The roof itself also had many loose slates and one quick fix was to paint them all with a sealant, rather than re-slating it. Unfortunately, this prevented ventilation in the attic and dampness led to rot and infestation. To add insult to injury, it transpired that the render on the external walls was non-porous – thus trapping the damp inside. Thus in 2016 the house was stripped of all its internal finishes down to bare timber and brick in order to reveal the extent of the damage – which was considerable. However, we are getting ahead of ourselves…\n\nTo go back a few years before the beginning of film-making here in 1951…\n\nHammer Productions Ltd was created in 1934 by an ex-actor, William Hinds, who called himself Will Hammer. Hinds was part of a comedy double-act paired with a bloke called Smith – they lived in Hammersmith, hence ‘Hammer and Smith.’ The Hammer name stuck. He was a member of the family who became famous for their High Street jewellery shops and he later became the chairman of the Goldhawk Building Society. No, really. He also managed a few theatres and sold bicycles. I’m not making this up. The first Hammer film was The Public Life of Henry the Ninth (’35). I’m sure we all remember that one.\n\nIn 1935 Will Hammer paired up with one Enriqué Carreras. The pair of them established ‘Exclusive Films.’ Some of their movies were under the ‘Exclusive’ banner, others were ‘Hammer’ films. In 1938 Enriqué’s son James joined the company. A little later, Will’s son Anthony joined the company too.\n\nAfter the war they began making cheap quota quickies (these have featured in the history of studios throughout this website). They made a film called Dick Barton, Special Agent (’48) which was based on a BBC radio series. Realising that this might be a rich seam of possible movie titles, in 1949 they formed a new company to exploit this new direction – Hammer Film Productions. For the next few years they made low-budget films based on popular radio shows like The Man in Black (’50), A Case For PC49 (’51) and Life With the Lyons (’54).\n\nThey decided to make these low budget films in large houses rather than renting costly studios. The first one was in Dial Close, Cookham Dean, near Maidenhead but the neighbours were not impressed so they had to move on. The next property was Oakley Court, a Victorian gothic mansion beside the Thames between Maidenhead and Windsor, to which they would return in future years. The owner was still in residence but lived in a few rooms and let them have the run of the rest of the house. The Man in Black (’50) was made here. They made two or three films here and also in a house in Harlow, Essex.\n\nIn 1950 they filmed a few scenes of The Dark Light in Down Place, which was in effect next door to Oakley Court, although a few hundred yards up river. The house was almost derelict – it had been used to store duffel coats during the war (many were still there) and parts of the floor had collapsed under the weight of all that damp duffel. The owner was living quietly in one wing, separated from the rest of the house. Nevertheless, Down Place proved to be perfect for their needs so in 1951 they took out a one-year lease on the property. Cloudburst (’51) was the first Hammer film completely made here. In fact they liked the house so much that in 1952 they took over the freehold.\n\nThey named the place ‘Bray Studios’ after the nearby village (famous for its vicar, its riverside homes where several celebrities have lived over the years and its two Michelin 3-star restaurants. The restaurants came later by the way.) Everything here was very, very basic but a team spirit soon evolved that would last for years. Actors too loved working here – in interviews in later years, all seem to mention the close family atmosphere surrounding Bray.\n\nFrankly, Hammer was not doing too well making its quota quickies and radio adaptations. Just about keeping its head above water but that was about it. Then in 1955 Hammer secured the rights to make a movie version of TV sci-fi series The Quatermass Xperiment.\n\nQuatermass was phenomenally successful and was followed up in 1956 with Quatermass II. They realised that horror might be the way to go so made The Curse of Frankenstein (’57) – their first colour film. For the next few years they revelled in blood and gore with films like Dracula (’58), The Hound of the Baskervilles (’59), The Mummy (’59), Curse of the Werewolf (’61), The Damned (’63), Kiss of the Vampire (’63) – well, you get the idea. Most of these films starred Christopher Lee and/or Peter Cushing. These movies used every inch of Down Place which was dressed and redressed for each title, whilst other sets were built on the stages. The exterior set on the back lot was also used for many a graveyard, ancient village or ruined castle.\n\nDespite the popularity of many of their films, the business itself never did that well. In 1955 Bray Studios were in trouble. They cut their regular staff to 60 and started to rely on outside companies to book their facilities. They considered selling the studios but the modest success of each horror film as it came out just about rescued them from disaster. Their US distributors Columbia purchased a 49% share in the studios in order to save them from closure. This investment enabled Bray to build their third and largest stage in 1957. This was of course a terrible time for the British film industry in general. Cinema audiences were plummeting and the creation of ITV in 1955 made things even worse. Why would people pay to go to the ‘pictures’ when television provided such great entertainment at home for free?\n\nIn 1956 the first TV production was filmed at Bray. It was The Errol Flynn Theatre and was made not by Hammer but by Motley Films Ltd, although the credits state ‘An Inter-TV Production.’ 25 half hour episodes were made it appears, all in one year. They were aimed at the American market but were also shown by the new ITV companies. Errol Flynn himself played the lead in every fourth show but they also starred many leading movie actors including Christopher Lee (of course), Glynis Johns, Leslie Phillips, Herbert Lom, Mai Zetterling and many others. Interestingly, the first in the series (Evil Thoughts) was actually filmed at Walton Studios in 1953 as a pilot for a similar series that was never commissioned.\n\nIn January 1964 ABPC became co-owners along with Hammer and Columbia. This was a curious deal. Hammer remained effective owners but they had agreed that they would henceforth make all their films at ABPC Elstree, unless those studios were full. Bray thus became a sort of overspill site. The studios were mothballed for much of 1964. None of Hammer’s six films in 1964 was shot at Bray. It was used for a couple of films made by Bill Luckwell but the studios were proving a financial millstone. They reopened in March 1965 and Dracula Prince of Darkness was the first of seven films made by Hammer between ’65 and ’66 plus two produced by Harry Alan Towers (see Highbury Studios for more info on him). The first four films in 1965 were shot back to back and shared several props and sets which were redressed for each film.\n\nIn 1965 Hammer also took over the Victorian gothic mansion Oakley Court. (You will remember that they first used it as a filming location in 1950.) This was a few hundred yards along the river from Down Place. I have not been able to establish whether this was a lease or possibly a number of short term rentals whilst the property was unoccupied. (The previous owner had died a few months earlier and the house remained empty until 1979 when it was converted into a luxury hotel). Oakley Court looked even more the thing for making horror films than Down Place and several used the house such as The Reptile (’66), Plague of the Zombies (’66) and And Now The Screaming Starts (’72).\n\nHowever, other less chilling films also used this property including The Rocky Horror Picture Show and – rather surprisingly – Tommy Steele’s Half A Sixpence. Some accounts state that the original St Trinian’s films used it too but to be honest the dates don’t fit, the house doesn’t look the same and none of the official location guides mention Oakley Court. In any case, for many films that did use it, it is likely that the exterior and the extensive grounds were used more often than the interior – Down Place was still more suitable for interior shots.\n\nThe brief resurgence in Hammer’s filmmaking at Bray did not last and the last Hammer horror film made here was The Mummy’s Shroud, which wrapped in October 1966. They continued making films but used Elstree. Hammer left Bray in November. They retained ownership of the studios but for the next four years just used them for some effects photography on a few films.\n\nIn 1970 the studios were used for two significant movies – John Schlesinger’s Sunday Bloody Sunday and Ken Russell’s The Music Lovers. Bray was still owned by Hammer at this time although the company itself was nowhere to be seen. However, many of the former crew members worked on those films. They used the three main stages – the ballroom stage was occupied by FX work on When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth. The set on the back lot was long gone but the prop stores had various familiar items lying around, left over from classic Hammer horrors.\n\nIn November 1970 the studios were sold to Redspring Ltd for £65,000. That wasn’t very much even then. They originally planned to demolish the stages and build housing (sound familiar?) but fortunately changed their minds. The studios were renamed ‘Bray International Film Centre.’ The old stage 1 was demolished and replaced with a larger one opening in 1973. I have been told that this was because the old stage 1 had been ‘gutted by fire’ but I can find no other record of this. Can you help?\n\nSome significant films were shot at Bray during the 1970s and into the ’80s including Pope Joan, The Hireling, Agatha, Loophole and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\n\nThe early ’70s also saw the site being used for effects work on Dr Who and between 1973 and 1975 Bray was booked by Gerry Anderson for SFX work and miniature shots on his series Space 1999. Brian Johnson was the HoD of the team. They used the ballroom stage and stage 3 (Hammer’s old stage 2 – the square one close to the house) as shooting stages. The prop store between stage 3 and the house was the main workshop. Other sheds around the site were also used as workshops and for storage. Live action scenes were filmed at Pinewood on stages L and M.\n\n1975 was the year in which the rather curious Anglo-German sci-fi series Star Maidens was filmed. I have read that they used some props and sound effects ‘borrowed’ from from Space 1999. I assume Gerry was asked.\n\nIn 1977 the impressive model shots for the first episode of the BBC’s Blake’s 7 were shot at Bray. The sequence was so impressive that they blew the entire series budget on it. The FX shots on later episodes were shot by in-house cameramen on a shoestring and were said to be somewhat less spectacular.\n\nBray seems to have become well established around this time as a centre of excellence for special effects work. In 1978, Ridley Scott’s movie Alien took over the site under great secrecy. Stage 2 (the corrugated iron one in the middle of the site) was the model shop and stage 3 (Hammer’s old stage 2, next to the house) was the shooting stage. The impressive exterior shots of the Nostromo spacecraft were filmed here, as was the atmospheric landscape of planet LV-426 where the wreck of the strange crescent-shaped spacecraft was discovered. This very convincing model took up the entire stage. The sequence where John Hurt rather foolishly looks into the egg and we see movement inside it was also shot on this stage – or at least, the closeups of the egg were. Ridley Scott’s own hands were inside the ‘gloves’ that formed the embryo alien in the translucent egg – he knew exactly how he wanted it to twitch.\n\nBetween 1983 and 1984 Gerry Anderson’s Terrahawks was the next TV show to occupy space at Bray. This was his first puppet series since the Supermarionation days of the 1960s on the Slough Trading Estate. The puppet scenes and special effects for all 39 episodes were shot here. The SFX stage was stage 3 (yes, the square one next to the house) and the puppet stage was stage 2 (yes, the corrugated iron one in the middle.) (Don’t blame me for the confusing numbers!) The old ballroom stage was by now a viewing theatre and was used as such by the production. The SFX team was a mix of experienced and new, young craftsmen. This show was excellent training for all of them, who went on to great things working on major blockbuster movies. Stage 1 was mostly used at this time for filming commercials or for bands rehearsing for tours.\n\nIn 1984 the studios were bought by Samuelson’s who shortly afterwards built a brand new large stage (see below). Movies in the 1980s included The Sea Wolves, Dead Man’s Folly, A Month in the Country, For Queen and Country and Hope and Glory. TV drama included Paradise Postponed, The Manageress and Inspector Morse.\n\nSome of the acts for the 1985 Live Aid concert rehearsed at Bray – in fact a large number of world-class bands and solo artists used the relative privacy of stage 1 or 2 to rehearse their tours over many years. The two main stages were an ideal size to erect the set and lighting rig to be toured. Bray Studios are ideally situated only a short drive from Heathrow and London and with excellent hotels and world famous restaurants nearby.\n\nIan Hall has written to me. He worked at Bray around 2000/2001 and remembers seeing acts rehearse there such as Elton John, the Bee Gees, Lionel Richie, Kylie, Cliff Richard, Eric Clapton, Gabrielle, Anastasia, Westlife, Craig David and Robbie Williams. Robbie’s video for Rock DJ was filmed on stage 2 and the fire scene in Supreme was shot in the car park in front of stage 1.\n\nIan also recalls that the condition of the stages and other facilities around that time was pretty ropey.\n\nIn 1990 the lease for the studios was taken over by Bray Management Ltd. In July 1999 Broadcast magazine ran a story under the headline ‘Bray Studios Saved From Closure.’ In it they reported that the studios had been saved ‘for the next 15 years.’ In the article Peter Gray and his business partner Neville Hendricks are quoted as saying that they were looking to spend ‘2 or 3 million over the next five years on structural and facilities improvement to bring it into the 21st century.’\n\nTV dramas and comedies filmed and/or based here in the ’90s and noughties included Inspector Morse, Pie in the Sky, 99-1, Born and Bred, Demob, Dirty Tricks, Invasion Earth, Murder Rooms, Night and Day, Our Friends in the North, Forever Green, Gone To The Dogs, Jeeves and Wooster, Poirot, Roger Roger, Roughnecks, Ruth Rendell Mysteries, Sex Chips & Rock n’ Roll, Soldier Soldier, Stick With Me Kid, Still Life at the Penguin Café (ballet), The Detectives, The Gentleman Thief, The Safe House, The Unknown Soldier, The Wyvern Mystery, Titmuss Regained, The Turn of the Screw and Murder Most Horrid.\n\nAt least two multicamera sitcom series were recorded here. One was How Do You Want Me (’97, ’99), starring Dylan Moran and Charlotte Colman. Far more controversial was Heil Honey I’m Home (’90), a spoof ’50’s-style sitcom in questionable taste depicting Hitler and Eva Braun living next door to a Jewish couple. It was made for the ill-fated BSB channel Galaxy but only one episode was ever aired. The rest of the series was never transmitted. When Sky took over BSB they were appalled by the show and immediately scrapped it. One of the camera crew told me that they were working on the final episode but were sent home at lunchtime before it was recorded. Sky had just bought BSB and the series had been pulled. So several unseen episodes may still exist somewhere. The pilot (ep 1) was in fact made at Pinewood – that’s the only one to survive. I gather the old Tyne Tees Television OB scanner was used for facilities here at Bray. They probably shoved it in the river when the show was scrapped.\n\nThere was also a BBC1 lottery show – Red Alert. Two series were recorded in 1999. 200 episodes of the CBeebies series Fimbles were made at Bray from 2001. In 2003 Stage 1 was the home of Inside Clyde, a kids’ gameshow set within the internal organs of a human being called – er – Clyde. It was presented by Tony Hawks and directed by the highly respected David G Croft who in later years later went on to lecture at the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield.\n\nThe stages at Bray have often been used to shoot commercials. One notable example was the 1998 Guinness ad with the surfer and the waves turning into leaping white horses. The horses (from Billy Smart’s Circus) were filmed against green screen on one of the stages here. They were sprayed white, had extensions added to their manes and were trained to gallop up a slope and leap off the end, all whilst being splashed with water. Hmm. Let’s hope they appreciated all the awards the commercial won – including ‘Best Ad of All Time’ in 2002.\n\nMovies shot here since 1990 included The Witches, Edward II, Mojo, Velvet Goldmine, Captain Corelli’s Mandolin, Reign of Fire, The Dark and (ahem) Ali G Indahouse. Probably the last film made before the closure was some miniature and effects work for Terry Gilliam’s The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus in 2009.\n\nOn 16th January 1992 Stage 1 was the venue for the MTV recording of Eric Clapton’s Unplugged concert. The show was very successful and the subsequent album went on to sell more than any other in his career.\n\nSadly, in 2010 Neville Hendricks announced that the studios were no longer economically viable. He said that bookings from films and TV had diminished in recent years and competition from larger studios such as Pinewood and Shepperton meant that they could no longer attract sufficient business. He planned to renovate Down Place and live there with his extended family. The stages and other buildings would be demolished and seven luxury houses would be built. There was inevitably strong opposition to this – some people pointing out that it is the relatively small size of the site and its seclusion that has appealed over the years to so many film-makers and to bands who need to rehearse in privacy. Twickenham studios – a similar sized site – was saved from closure in 2012. However, despite a campaign to save these studios, on 3rd October 2012 planning permission was finally granted.\n\nIn a newspaper interview in 2010 Mr Hendricks explained that the stages and facilities were by then very old and needed ‘millions’ spent on them to bring them up to a reasonable standard. He did possibly have a point – much of the site had had a dilapidated and seedy look to it for a number of years although I would question whether millions needed to be spent on the stages, particularly stage 1. You could build brand new ones for millions – a few hundred thousand would have gone a long way to refurbish the existing ones. However, the support facilities certainly did need some money spent on them.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that stage 1 was comparatively not very old and stage 2 had a bit of a history but was erected here in 1973 which compares very well with many film stages. Studios like Ealing, Twickenham, Pinewood and Shepperton all have much older stages that are still in regular use. A film stage is a very basic thing – a black box with a grid and some power. It is not like a TV studio which is full of technical equipment that goes out of date. A well-built film stage (like stages 1 and 2 ) can go on for ever. In fact, many films and TV series are now being made in far less suitable facilities than this. Old factories and leaky warehouses are frequently being used now due to the lack of available film stages.\n\nHendricks also explained that the old house needed a great deal spent on it to preserve it for the future. That certainly is a point. It had been very poorly maintained by all its owners over the years. It is unlikely that he would have got his money back from renting studio space if he did spend millions doing up the old house and living in it himself.\n\nSo – bitter as it may seem – simple economics brought the studios to a close, although it is a shame he didn’t appear to be willing to put the site on the market to see if someone else might make a go of it. He did also appear to turn away work from 2010 onwards which could have kept the studios going for a few years longer whilst discussions continued over their future.\n\nThanks to attractive tax laws and the fall in the value of the pound along with the rise of Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+, the making of TV dramas and features in the UK is more popular than ever. This has meant that many have really struggled to find film stages to hire and are now having to use unsuitable buildings such as empty factories and warehouses around London due to the severe shortage of available sound stages.\n\nMy guess is that if it had been put on the open market, an enterprising company or individual could have come in and refurbished stages 1 and 2 for a relatively small amount. Some new dressing rooms/make-up facilities and production offices would have been needed for stage 2. Stage 3 and the surrounding workshops should have been demolished and replaced with new workshops or a new medium stage. (I wrote the paragraphs above some years ago. Of course, in fact this has now happened – since 2020 a new soundstage has occupied the land where stage 3 and the old workshops once stood.)\n\nThe house, however, clearly needed some significant money spent on it. In fact, following detailed structural surveys in 2008 and 2014 that discovered serious damage from rot, damp and wood-boring insects, the interior was completely stripped back to the basic structure of the building. The old admin wing was found to be beyond saving and was demolished in 2016. Work began on restoring Down Place during the spring and summer of 2021.\n\nA campaign with a Facebook group and petition was organised in 2013 attempting to save the studios, despite the planning permission decision. The occasional newspaper report mentioned it. Terry Gilliam was one notable director who lent his support but it remained unclear how the studios could be saved. I have been informed that the decision by the planning committee was challenged on the grounds that that they might have been given false information which may have affected their decision. However, this last minute attempt to save this valuable asset for the UK film industry was unsuccessful. What a waste!\n\nRather unexpectedly, it seems that at the end of 2014 Mr Hendricks quietly sold the studios to another developer – Farmglade. Knowledge of this sale was not made public until the summer of 2015 when they revealed new plans. Thus the opportunity to sell to a company looking to keep the studios open was very sadly missed. Farmglade submitted completely different housing development proposals to the local council and very disappointingly, planning permission was granted in October 2015, despite the clear demand for studio space at that time. A modification to the plans was also given planning permission in April 2017. However, a condition of the permission was that work on the development must be started by February 2019. When this date passed it looked as though the studios might be saved after all. However, a renewed planning application was submitted in October 2019 which was subsequently passed by the council.\n\nThe proposals were for Down Place to be renovated and extended and turned into 10 apartments. All stages and other buildings were to be demolished and 15 houses would be built. Farmglade also own the farm to the west of the studio site and this too was to be developed with 127 houses.\n\nDespite the planned closure of the studios, against all odds some filming did take place in 2017. There were rumours of a TV drama using the facilities. It turned out that it was the hit BBC thriller Bodyguard. Apparently, Keeley Hawes was blown up on stage 2. Later came some pick up shots for Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again. Other productions to use the studios included Angel Has Fallen and Kingsman.\n\nIn January 2018 there was some very good news. Farmglade had officially decided to postpone the redevelopment and re-open the studios in order to make some money on their investment for the time being at least. This was hardly surprising – the housing market was not as vibrant as before, whilst demand for studio space continued to rise.\n\nDuring 2018 some more buildings were demolished, including the old stage 3 and some new construction took place. These were large ‘temporary’ buildings being used as workshops and prop/costume stores. The brickwork above the Stage 2 dock door was also repaired.\n\nInterestingly, the field between the studios and the main road was given a large hardstanding area with a couple of workshop buildings on it. There was now a sign at a new entrance saying ‘Bray Studios, South Lot.’ So, not only were the studios back in use, they had expanded!\n\nThen in May 2018 it was announced that Rocketman, a musical about Elton John, was preparing to shoot at Bray. The project occupied the studios for about 9 months. Interestingly, the Leader of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead now seemed to be very enthusiastic about filming resuming here. Simon Dudley was quoted as saying ‘It’s incredibly exciting. There are a number of projects that are being filmed. They are really exciting projects and there’s a possibility that there will be some investment.’ He is reported to have said ‘The reopening of the studios makes the Borough stand out even more. It’s very exciting because there are a lot of people here who are involved in the arts, media and entertainment.’\n\nThis is all quite extraordinary since the same council previously seemed to accept what the owners told them on two previous occasions – that there was no demand for studio space in this area! Maybe they had spoken to a few people in the industry and discovered the truth. Anyway – local Conservative councillor, David Coppinger, is quoted as saying ‘The demand for filming, mainly because of companies like Netflix, is increasing and there is not enough studio capacity, so the owner of the land has reinstated the studio. We will see yet again Hollywood film stars in Bray which has to be good for our local economy.’\n\nThis last minute conversion by the Royal Borough was obviously very welcome indeed. Unfortunately of course they did renew the planning permission in November 2019 for the studios to be demolished and replaced with housing.\n\nIn August 2018 I was contacted by one of the neighbours. He informed me that a great deal of activity had been happening on site, which was then occupied by a large number of movie-related vehicles. He confirmed that some buildings had been demolished and new constructions had replaced them. Some considerable investment in the studios appeared to be happening, which was of course very encouraging. The neighbours were apparently contacted by Farmglade who confirmed that the housing market was currently poor so they were postponing the redevelopment. They said that they had had a number of offers to use the studios which they couldn’t turn down.\n\nIn May 2019 there was a press announcement that I’m sure thrilled many fans of Hammer films and lovers of Bray Studios. The BBC’s version of Dracula had begun shooting at Bray! The show wrapped on 1st August. Made by Hartswood Films, with scripts by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss – this is the dream team that created Sherlock some years earlier. The drama was in three parts and was very well received when it was transmitted on BBC1 at Christmas.\n\nIn September 2019 Bray was being used to shoot series 2 of There She Goes, with Jessica Hynes and David Tennant. Please contact me if you know of any other TV shows or films being made here.\n\nThe 2020 expansion.\n\nSome really encouraging news came in December 2019. Farmglade applied for temporary planning permission covering 2 years to considerably expand the studio site, keeping some of the existing temporary workshops and erecting several new stages and workshops. The area included the original site, the field between that site and the road, and the farm to the west. Permission was granted in June 2020. A condition of the permission was that all the temporary structures had to be removed by June 2022. (Of course many were hoping they would apply to have this limit extended.) The press reported that the studios were being used by ‘one of the biggest TV series in the world.’\n\nWhat was very encouraging was the warm and enthusiastic support from local residents for the studios to continue in use. On the planning application there was not one letter of complaint – all were saying that they were very happy for the studios to expand and continue in use. Several noted that they were unaware of any increase in traffic or noise during the filming of Rocket Man or the BBC’s Dracula. One assumes that a housing estate of 152 large houses, most with at least 2 cars, would create a lot more traffic every day than the studios – especially taking into account on-line deliveries to the houses. One can imagine a never-ending line of Ocado and Amazon vans.\n\nTwo new temporary stages were erected. So, steel framed and soundproofed but relatively easy to dismantle if and when the time comes. Stage 4 is about 165 x 130ft (22,150 sq ft) and is sited on the South Lot field not far from stage 1. Stage 5 is slightly smaller than Stage 2 – around 9,730 sq ft and is positioned between Stages 1 and 2. There are 9 temporary workshops, including 3 that were already standing. Portacabins are being used for production offices. There is also a large rehearsal room.\n\nRenovation work was carried out on Down Place during the spring and summer of 2021. Photos taken from the river when the scaffolding was removed showed it looking very smart and clean, for the first time in many years. Also, the Bray Studios website noted that series 1 of the 6-episode drama Citadel starring Richard Madden, Stanley Tucci and Lesley Manville, was filmed here in 2021, with some reshoots in 2022. It was released on Prime in April 2023. According to Wikipedia, it was the second most expensive drama series for Prime up to that point.\n\nThe future looking bright!\n\nIn June 2021 Bray Film Studios (note the new name for the business) issued a consultation document revealing that they intended to replace a number of the temporary buildings and construct several new permanent ones – including 5 new stages. In other words, the studios were going to remain in business and the plans for housing had been postponed indefinitely. Whew! In summary – the temporary stages 4 and 5 would remain along with the old stages 1 and 2 but new workshops and other supporting buildings would be constructed on the east side of Water Oakley Lane. Meanwhile, west of the lane there would be two very large constructions – one with 3 stages and adjoining workshops and the other with 2 plus workshops. These were curiously numbered as follows:\n\nStage A1 – 15,800 sq ft\n\nStage A2 – 18,300 sq ft\n\nStage A3 – 15,800 sq ft\n\nStage B1 – 22,300 sq ft\n\nStage B2 – 22,300 sq ft\n\nThe whole site was to be landscaped with many trees and sloping banks to conceal the buildings from the neighbours. The stages would also have green roofs. Sadly the small stage by the house was to be demolished. This was the first one that Hammer built in 1953 and was numbered 2, 4 and 3 over the years. It had many Hammer horror sets built within it and much later was used for FX scenes in Alien. Tucked up next to Down Place it would have to be removed as the old house was to have a new wing added, as was proposed in the 2019 application for 10 apartments to be built.\n\nInterestingly, Waterford House, the large house next door up river, is now owned by the studios and has been retained with its riverside garden, effectively replacing Down Place in the life of the new studios. Another 19th Century property known as Steading is also being retained.\n\nPlanning permission was granted on 8th November 2021.\n\nThis was all terrific news of course. For many years, the future of Bray hung by a thread but now it was possible for these studios to attract a mix of high end TV and feature films for many years to come. In fact, in November 2021 it was revealed that series 2 of The Rings of Power – the Lord of the Rings prequel – would be filmed at Bray. Principal photography began in October 2022 using stages 1, 2, 4 and 5. (Series 1 was made in New Zealand.) This was a terrific coup for these studios and confirmation of how vital Bray will be for the future of the British film industry. Bovingdon Airfield Studios were also mentioned as a base for exterior sets but in fact in 2022 six new large stages were built there (3 permanent, 3 temporary), so they complemented the ones here at Bray. The back lot at Bray also had an exterior set built on it. I have been sent photos but it is my policy not to publish images of sets for productions that have not yet been released.\n\nAlthough permission was granted late in 2021, no construction work was done throughout 2022 and 2023. My understanding is that a condition of consent was to establish whether the land to the west of the site was contaminated, and if so, to devise a suitable method of foundation construction and containment. This is because the western part of the site was many years ago used for gravel extraction. This was then filled in with landfill waste and topped off with soil. Workshops A and B and stages B1 and B2 straddle this area. Fortunately, in February 2024 the local council’s planning department accepted the proposed methods to be used to mitigate the issue so it would appear that work can now commence when funding is available.\n\nAmazon take over!\n\nIn July 2024 it was announced that the studios had been sold to Amazon MGM Studios. They already have a long-term contract for the use of 9 stages at Shepperton but these will be the first studios in the UK that they will own outright. Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, is quoted as saying:\n\n“With Bray as our creative home in the UK, we are committed to deepening our relationships with the UK creative community, which is rich with world-class storytellers and creative talent of all kinds. The acquisition of a studio with such a storied heritage not only empowers us to produce more film and television in the UK, but also unveils a wealth of opportunities in the local community with respect to jobs and skills training at all levels of the production process.”\n\nFrank Burke, chairman of the previous owner, Bray Film Studios Ltd, added:\n\n“For 70 plus years, Bray Studios has held an important place in the history of British filmmaking. During our period of ownership, I, together with my family and team have witnessed the rebirth of this iconic facility and we are extremely proud of the part we have been able to play in bringing it to renewed prominence. We are now genuinely excited to be handing the studios over to Amazon, who we believe share our commitment to quality and excellence and are perfectly suited to preserving the character of the studio while enhancing the first-class creative production spaces for generations of filmmakers to come.”\n\nThis deal was enthusiastically supported by the new Labour government, which is also very good news.\n\nAmazon of course made use of Bray for filming series 2 of Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power and also booked the studios to film the second series of spy drama Citadel from September 2024. (The first series was filmed here in 2021.)\n\nWhat is not clear from the press announcements is how this will affect the construction of the proposed new stages, workshops and offices, which received planning permission as described above. Hopefully, Amazon can make use of its considerable financial resources to carry out the scheme. If you are able to let me know more on this in confidence, please contact me.\n\nFor much more information on Bray I can heartily recommend Wayne Kinsey’s excellent book ‘Inside Bray Studios’, published in 2018 by Peveril Publishing. It is superbly researched and full of fascinating details and hundreds of photos."
