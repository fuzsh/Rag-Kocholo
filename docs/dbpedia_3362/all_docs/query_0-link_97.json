        "text": "Social Upheaval\n\nAfter the war ended, U.S. troops were demobilized and rapidly sent home. One unanticipated and unwanted effect of their return was the emergence of a new strain of influenza that medical professionals had never before encountered. Within months of the war’s end, over twenty million Americans fell ill from the flu. Eventually, 675,000 Americans died before the disease mysteriously ran its course in the spring of 1919. Worldwide, recent estimates suggest that 500 million people suffered from this flu strain, with as many as fifty million people dying. Throughout the United States, from the fall of 1918 to the spring of 1919, fear of the flu gripped the country. Americans avoided public gatherings, children wore surgical masks to school, and undertakers ran out of coffins and burial plots in cemeteries. Hysteria grew as well, and instead of welcoming soldiers home with a postwar celebration, people hunkered down and hoped to avoid contagion.\n\nAnother element that greatly influenced the challenges of immediate postwar life was economic upheaval. Wartime production had led to steady inflation; the rising cost of living meant that few Americans could comfortably afford to live off their wages. When the government’s wartime control over the economy ended, businesses slowly recalibrated from the wartime production of guns and ships to the peacetime production of toasters and cars. Public demand quickly outpaced the slow production, leading to notable shortages of domestic goods. As a result, inflation skyrocketed in 1919. By the end of the year, the cost of living in the United States was nearly double what it had been in 1916. Workers, facing a shortage in wages to buy more expensive goods, and no longer bound by the no-strike pledge they made for the National War Labor Board, initiated a series of strikes for better hours and wages. In 1919 alone, more than four million workers participated in a total of nearly three thousand strikes: both records in American history.\n\nIn addition to labor clashes, race riots shattered the peace at the home front. The sporadic race riots that had begun during the Great Migration only became more frequent in postwar America. White soldiers returned home to find Black workers in their former jobs and neighborhoods and were committed to restoring their position of White supremacy. Black soldiers returned home with a renewed sense of justice and strength, determined to assert their rights as men and as citizens. Meanwhile, southern lynchings continued to escalate, with White mobs publically assaulting Black Americans. Among these riots was the Chicago Race Riot of 1919, where a White mob stoned a young Black boy to death because he swam too close to the “White beach” on Lake Michigan. Police at the scene did not arrest the perpetrators. This crime prompted a week-long riot that left twenty-three Black people and fifteen White people dead, and caused millions of dollars in damage to the city. Riots in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1921, turned even more deadly, with estimates of Black fatalities ranging from fifty to three hundred. Americans thus entered the new decade with a profound sense of disillusionment over the prospects of peaceful race relations.\n\nReporting on the Red Summer\n\nOne of the worst incidents during the Red Summer occurred in Chicago, where a White mob attacked several Black teenagers who were swimming close to the segregated beach on Lake Michigan. The end result was several days of violent rioting, killing 23 Black and 15 White Chicagoans and leaving thousands of people homeless from their homes being set on fire. The local newspapers did little to quell the animosity on either side, with Black-owned newspapers offering gruesome and sometimes unsubstantiated descriptions of violence from Whites, and White-owned newspapers placing the blame for the rioting solely on the Black community. You can read differing excerpts from The Chicago Defender and the Chicago Daily Tribune Read these two excerpts from Chicago newspapers reporting on the riot to see the differences. NOTE: These articles contain graphic descriptions of violence. Please use discretion while reading.\n\nThe First Red Scare\n\nWhile illness, economic hardship, and racial tensions all came from within, another destabilizing factor arrived from overseas. As revolutionary rhetoric emanating from Bolshevik Russia intensified in 1918 and 1919, a Red Scare erupted in the United States over fear that Communist infiltrators sought to overthrow the American government as part of an international revolution. When investigators uncovered a collection of thirty-six letter bombs at a New York City post office, with recipients that included several federal, state, and local public officials, as well as industrial leaders such as John D. Rockefeller, fears grew significantly. And when eight additional bombs actually exploded simultaneously on June 2, 1919, including one that destroyed the entrance to U.S. attorney general A. Mitchell Palmer’s house in Washington, the country was convinced that all radicals, no matter what ilk, were to blame. Socialists, Communists, members of the Industrial Workers of the World (Wobblies), and anarchists: They were all threats to be confronted.\n\nPrivate citizens who considered themselves upstanding and loyal Americans, joined by discharged soldiers and sailors, raided radical meeting houses in many major cities, attacking any alleged radicals they found inside. By November 1919, Palmer’s new assistant in charge of the Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover, organized nationwide raids on radical headquarters in twelve cities around the country. Subsequent Palmer raids resulted in the arrests of four thousand presumed American radicals who were detained for weeks in overcrowded cells. Almost 250 of those arrested were subsequently deported on board a ship dubbed “the Soviet Ark.”\n\nWatch It\n\nThis video details the Palmer Raids and shows actual video footage just how brutal and violent they could be.\n\nYou can view the transcript for “The Palmer Raids | The Bombing of Wall Street” here (opens in new window).\n\nEmma Goldman, one of the people arrested in the Palmer Raids and deported to Russia, was a prominent figure in the anti-capitalist, radical movement of the early 20th century. She was primarily a writer, covering topics like prison welfare, atheism, freedom of speech, militarism, capitalism, marriage, free love, and homosexuality (these latter issues well before the social revolutions of the 1960s). She was arrested multiple times prior to her deportation for distributing information about birth control (which was illegal at the time), conspiracy to prevent draft registration, “incitement to riot,” and for planning the assassination of industrialist Henry Frick. Goldman was deported to Russia during the Palmer Raids and spent the remainder of her life traveling to lend her support to various anarchist and populist revolutions. She wrote extensively about patriotism and its relationship to militarism and war, giving a speech in 1908 in which she stated:\n\nIndeed, conceit, arrogance and egotism are the essentials of patriotism. Let me illustrate. Patriotism assumes that our globe is divided into little spots, each one surrounded by an iron gate. Those who have had the fortune of being born on some particular spot consider themselves nobler, better, grander, more intelligent than those living beings inhabiting any other spot. It is, therefore, the duty of everyone living on that chosen spot to fight, kill and die in the attempt to impose his superiority upon all the others.\n\nThe inhabitants of the other spots reason in like manner, of course, with the result that from early infancy the mind of the child is provided with blood-curdling stories about the Germans, the French, the Italians, Russians, etc. When the child has reached manhood he is thoroughly saturated with the belief that he is chosen by the Lord himself to defend his country against the attack or invasion of any foreigner. It is for that purpose that we are clamoring for a greater army and navy, more battleships and ammunition.\n\nConsider that this speech was given almost ten years prior to America’s entry into World War I. Can you see Goldman’s words reflected in U.S. actions like the Committee for Public Information, the Espionage & Sedition Acts, and the Palmer Raids? Do you think she was correct about patriotism and the way that it was taught to children? What examples can you think of that illustrate what Goldman was talking about?\n\nHere is an excerpt from another speech that Goldman gave to the court prior to her deportation where she speaks more about patriotism. Compare this 1908 speech, given prior to World War I, to her 1917 speech given during the war. What differences, if any, do you notice?\n\nA Return to Normalcy\n\nBy 1920, Americans had failed their great expectations to make the world safer and more democratic. The flu epidemic had demonstrated the limits of science and technology in safeguarding Americans’ health. The Red Scare revealed a growing fear of revolutionary politics and the persistence of violent capital-labor conflicts. Race riots made it clear that the nation was no closer to peaceful race relations either. After a long era of Progressive initiatives and new government agencies, followed by a costly war that did not end in a better world, most of the public sought to focus on economic progress and success in their private lives instead. As the presidential election of 1920 unfolded, the extent of just how tired Americans were of an interventionist government—whether in terms of Progressive reform or international involvement—became exceedingly clear. Republicans, anxious to return to the White House after eight years of Wilsonian idealism, capitalized on this growing American sentiment to find the candidate who would promise a return to normalcy.\n\nThe Election of 1920\n\nThe Republicans found their man in Senator Warren G. Harding from Ohio. Although not the most energetic candidate for the White House, Harding offered what party handlers desired—a candidate around whom they could mold their policies of low taxes, immigration restriction, and noninterference in world affairs. He also provided Americans with what they desired: a candidate who could look and act presidential, and yet leave them alone to live their lives as they wished.\n\nLink to Learning\n\nLearn more about President Harding’s campaign promise of a return to normalcy by listening to an audio recording or reading the text of his promise.\n\nDemocratic leaders realized they had little chance at victory. Wilson remained adamant that the election be a referendum over his League of Nations, yet after his stroke, he was in no physical condition to run for a third term. Political in-fighting among his cabinet, most notably between A. Mitchell Palmer and William McAdoo, threatened to split the party convention until a compromise candidate could be found in Ohio governor James Cox. Cox chose, for his vice-presidential running mate, the young Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nAt a time when Americans wanted prosperity and normalcy, Harding won in an overwhelming landslide, with 404 votes to 127 in the Electoral College, and 60 percent of the popular vote. With the war, the flu epidemic, the Red Scare, and other issues behind them, Americans looked forward to Harding’s inauguration in 1921, and to an era of personal freedoms and hedonism that would come to be known as the Jazz Age.\n\nTry It"
