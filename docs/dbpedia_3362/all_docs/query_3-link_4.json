Also available, cranage capacities up to 1300 Tons upon request and locally up to 600 Tons. For those heavy loading installations and demobilizations, for trans pooling, cranage, stingers installations, or overhauls.\n\nWeather conditions in the Canaries allow us to work 24/7 all year round in open yard spaces, for big-scale fabrication projects. The humidity and temperature at this latitude allow us to perform on painting scopes without delays to allow guarantee the highest quality under the guidance of our Frosio painting inspector.\n\nWelding inspector and certified welders with own procedures, from lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, added high tech precision machinery, give us the fact to fabricate or adapt any structures, frames or reinforcements.
