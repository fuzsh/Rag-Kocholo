        "text": "Wilson and others knew that women played a vital role in World War II and wanted to continue that contribution into the future. Many in the military supported the creation of a peacetime women’s corps and vocally expressed their appreciation of the women they served with during the war. In the meantime, the corps continued to demobilize even as the Armed Forces called for women to stay in the service longer or to re-enlist.\n\nWhat About the WASP?\n\nUnlike the WAC, MCWR, and WAVES, the WASP did not receive offers for reenlistment or a permanent corps. Earlier in March 1944, legislation to militarize the WASP was introduced in Congress but was defeated in June. After the failure of the WASP bill, the program was disbanded in December 1944. Opponents of the WASP argued that the program cost too much and that the women would be taking piloting jobs from male veterans. A week after the last class graduated from the program, the WASP was no more. Unlike the other corps, the women were never officially part of the military, so they were ineligible for many of the benefits the other women enjoyed, like insurance, burial and death benefits, and the opportunities provided by the GI Bill. Some of the bases helped the women return home, but others were left to find their own transportation.\n\nMany of the women wanted to continue flying after being released from the WASP and looked for civilian flying work. Former WASPs were allowed to join the WAC but were not allowed to pilot planes. Many of them stayed in contact with each other and in August 1946, while the other corps drafted legislation for reserve and regular military status, the former members of the WASP met for their first reunion under the Order of Fifinella (named after their gremlin mascot) in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania. The group continued to organize meetings until 2009.\n\nAdjusting to Civilian Life\n\nLike male veterans, members of the women’s corps had mixed reactions to demobilization. Many women enjoyed their time in the service and the new opportunities available to them. This was especially true for the WASPs, many of whom struggled to find their place in the post-war world. Some were able to continue flying after the war, but many industries like commercial airlines turned women pilots away. For other former women’s corps members, however, the end of the war brought them a sense of relief at returning to their old lives. They, like many male servicemen, believed that they sufficiently performed their wartime duty and wanted to go back to normal. Additionally, women had no guarantee that they could return to their pre-war jobs, so many wanted a head start to apply for work and housing before full demobilization created too much competition.\n\nAs the United States navigated how to help war veterans, former women’s corps members faced many of the same problems. Newspaper articles about the plight of women veterans focused on how many women struggled with finding new and meaningful jobs, maintaining relationships from before the war, and adjusting to civilian life. After serving in new and exciting jobs in exotic locations, some women found that regular civilian jobs were not satisfying enough. Additionally, women veterans felt abandoned by the general public. Many of the community services offered to male veterans often forgot about the women who served.\n\nIn their family lives, many women returned to family and friends who did not approve of their enlistment and wanted them to return to the normalcy of cooking and cleaning. Jokes and vicious rumors about the women’s corps continued to follow the women into their civilian lives. In some cases, women avoided mentioning their time in the service for fear of judgement. Many women reported that serving in the Armed Forces changed their personality and character through gaining confidence, organizational skills, and responsibility. These changes could either help or hinder their previous relationships with parents, friends, and significant others.\n\nThis recruiting poster encouraged college educated women to join the WAC, where they could gain practical experiences in their field of study. Office of War Information poster from The National Archives.\n\nIn response to the demand for assistance, several groups like the Committee on Services to Women Veterans formed to help the women navigate the post-war world and access some of the resources they needed. The special committee worked with veterans’ centers to assist women in various ways, mainly through career counseling. Other women used their benefits from the GI Bill to start or continue their college educations. In addition to earning bachelor’s degrees, many women used their GI Bill benefits for extended higher education. Betty Bandel, who served as the Director of the Army Air Force WAC, used her benefits to earn her PhD at Columbia, and Charity Adams Earley, the commander of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, went on to earn a master’s degree at the Ohio State University.\n\nPublic reactions to the women’s army corps varied greatly. Many former servicewomen reported facing discrimination for their work with the military. Some companies were unwilling to hire them, and many civilian women’s groups turned them away. At the same time however, many military officials vocally offered their support of the women’s work during the war. Several newspapers also published articles in appreciation of the women’s wartime service and favoring legislation for a peacetime women’s corps. Despite the early public criticism of establishing women’s military corps, the women’s work proved their value and earned them additional support from more media sources.\n\nBeyond 1946\n\nLike their service during the war, the early post-war experiences of women in the military represent a period of change and contradictions. While many wanted to return to civilian life, a large number of women and military officials wanted to expand the opportunities for women’s service with the Armed Forces. The transition period of 1946 marked an important milestone in women’s military participation. Post-war legislation led to the future of women’s military involvement and more non-traditional military roles for women. The proposed bill to establish a more permanent women’s corps finally made headway and was introduced in Congress in April 1947 and later passed unanimously in the Senate.\n\nFurther delays, however, delayed the bill until June 1948, when the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act was established. Many eligible former WACs, Marines, and WAVES immediately enlisted in the new version of the corps. The Act allowed for women to serve in the Regular Armed Forces, although still in non-combat roles and as separate units. Future legislation would later fully integrate women into the military and open up more roles, including combat. These changes came in part from women’s service in World War II and the 1946 efforts to keep that contribution alive.\n\nMeet the Author\n\nBrittany Huner is a current PhD student at the University of North Texas.
