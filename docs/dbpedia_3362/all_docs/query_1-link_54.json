        "text": "MEET THE OWNER -ABDUL SHAIKH AND HIS VAUXHALL VENTORA V.I.P.\n\nSome limited-edition cars were to clear the showroom of stocks before the launch of a replacement model. Others marked the end of a long and distinguished production run, while a third group enhanced the appeal of a recently introduced line-up. The Ventora V.I.P. falls into this last-named category, and there are now believed to be only two on the road.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – MICHAEL DICKENS AND HIS LADA RIVA\n\n“I found it in a scrap yard in Kempston. The old lady that owned it from new had crashed it into her house and stopped driving. Her family scrapped it, and I bought it blind for £300 to cannibalise it for parts for my 1994 Riva Estate. It was immaculate when it turned up (aside from a dented wing and smashed headlamp), and I just couldn’t break it up.”\n\nRARER THAN RARE – 1966 RENAULT 16\n\nWhen Renault GB introduced the 16 to British motorists in the autumn of 1965, it would be fair to say it did not resemble any UK family saloon. To quote the advertisement: “The Renault l6 is a new breed of car. Compare the looks of the new Renault 16 with other 1 ½ litre cars”. This 1966 De Luxe is believed to be the oldest surviving British market example.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – PHIL CAUNT AND HIS HEINZ 57 WOLSELEY HORNET CONVERTIBLE\n\n“I must first say I did NOT restore it myself—I purchased it with it needing 'minor amendments' to make it how I wanted it, including removing some extra work that the previous owner wanted, plus adding some overriders, going over the fuel system, and other 'tweaks'. It is a lovely car, but of course, unless you know it's a 'Heinz,' Joe Public thinks it is a Wolseley Hornet that has just had a chop job!”\n\nMEET THE EXPERT – SARAH CRABTREE\n\nReaders will instantly know the name of Sarah Crabtree, as the director of Evoke Classics, from the television series Bangers and Cash, and from meeting her at events in the company of Ivan, her Morris Ital. This writer has had the great privilege of witnessing Sarah pilot this fine machine around the Silverstone circuit – an experience never to be forgotten!\n\nTHE FIAT 131 AT 50 By Andrew Roberts\n\nIt is always a pleasant experience to be reacquainted with Theo Kyriacou’s Sport, which goes by the Nom-de-Fiat of Hugo.\n\nMeet The Owner – Herb and his Fiat 1500\n\n“I am 22 years old and have wanted a classic car since my early childhood - you could say I have admired them all my life. I remember my dad having a Morris Oxford Series VI Farina for a while; it was the family car until we found out the floor was made of cornflake packets!\n\nThe Mini Moke at 60 by Andrew Roberts\n\nTo celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Mini Moke, we travel to Portmeirion in North Wales, where this writer had the honour of encountering one of the most famous automotive television stars of the 20th century.\n\nWe name RAC as our exclusive breakdown partner\n\nWe are pleased to announce that we are now offering RAC roadside assistance as a new add-on policy benefit for customers with cover starting from £19.95.\n\nExciting New Feature: Podcast Lounge at the Lancaster Insurance Classic Motor Show!\n\nWe’re thrilled to announce a brand-new feature at this year’s Lancaster Insurance Classic Motor Show: The Podcast Lounge!\n\nTWENTY MOTORING MEMORIES\n\nWhile on wedding car duty (look out for another blog soon), I pondered how a 1960 Wolseley 6/99 appeared to modern traffic and my advanced age. Was I really aged only 14 and contemplating my GCE O-Level options when Lancaster Insurance was formed in 1984? And here are 20 aspects of motoring and transport that might be lost on the youth of today:\n\nMEET THE OWNER – MARK DENTON AND HIS JOWETT JAVELIN\n\nA friend in the village I grew up in had it from 1967 until he passed away 22 years ago. I never thought the car would ever come on the market! I like the lines of the Javelin – they remind me of the Vanguard – and the work of its designer, Gerald Palmer! My car is a Javelin De Luxe, first registered to Jowett’s sales manager, Arthur Joplin.\n\nRARER THAN RARE – THE SINGER HUNTER\n\nH&H Classic Auction will be selling, on the 24th of July, one of the most unusual saloons for the 1950s. Singer marketed the Hunter as the car “for the connoisseur who likes his spirited motoring in comfort” – and it was the famous Coventry firm’s last independent design.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – CHRIS JAMES AND HIS ROVER 623SLI\n\nThe 623 popped up on FB Marketplace locally in Middlesbrough when I was on holiday in France. I messaged the vendor, and she said someone was going to view it the next day. He did view, but then could not sort insurance on it. She messaged to say her husband was taking it off sale, but I gave her my number should that change. She got in touch just before we returned from holiday to say if I wanted it, I could have it for £450!!.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – CHRIS JAMES AND HIS ROVER 623SLI\n\nThe 623 popped up on FB Marketplace locally in Middlesbrough when I was on holiday in France. I messaged the vendor, and she said someone was going to view it the next day. He did view, but then could not sort insurance on it. She messaged to say her husband was taking it off sale, but I gave her my number should that change.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – MATTY CRISELL AND HIS FIAT 850 SPORT COUPE\n\nIt is in very good condition for a 55-year-old car. The Coupe was imported from California and had been off the road since 1994 with a seized engine, but the only complete panel that needed changing was a sill that I’ve managed to find an original from Italy. The Fiat is now RHD; I found a UK car and switched the necessary parts over.\n\nMeet The Owner – Malcolm Cross and His Austin A90 Westminster\n\nThe classic car world is rife with temptation. Last month, you vowed never to buy another vehicle, but you heard the siren call of classified advertising. And it is very hard to resist Malcolm Cross’s 1955 Austin A90 Westminster.\n\nMeet The Owner – Tony Croft and his Ford Prefect 100E\n\nLast year Tony acquired a car that now appears to hail from an impossibly remote time: smog, Woodbines and such telephone numbers as WATerloo 2193 (“Press Button A, caller.”). Today, many Britons associate the name “Ford Prefect” with The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but 70 years ago Tony Hancock probably dreamed of owning a new 100E parked outside 23 Railway Cuttings.\n\nYES MINISTER – THE GOVERNMENT’S WOLSELEY WEDGES\n\nFor those of us of a certain age, the prospect of a general election evokes images of Rover 3.5-litre P5 saloons arriving outside 10 Downing Street. However, during the 1970s, another official car conveyed junior ministers to Whitehall in a chauffeur-driven style. It was, of course, the Wolseley “Wedge”.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – MICHAEL CARPENTER AND HIS SINGER GAZELLE SERIES V\n\nWe have previously featured members of Michael Carpenter’s fleet, but he has now decided to take a walk on the wild side. Yes, throwing caution to the wind, this week Michael became the proud owner of a Singer Gazelle Series V.\n\nDO YOU REMEMBER – THE MORRIS J4?\n\nIf this 1964 Morris J4 seems familiar, it is probably because you have seen it on Heartbeat, The Royal, or Cradle to the Grave. Counting Stars of Leighton Buzzard is selling this rare surviving example of a van that once dominated the roads of the UK.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – KARL HOBBS AND HIS VAUXHALL VENTORA ESTATE\n\nI bought my Ventora five years ago after hearing about it from a friend in the Owners’ Club. It had been resprayed, but that was as far as the work went, so I basically acquired the shell and six boxes of spares. Also, most of the bits fitted to the car were wrong anyway!\n\nRARER THAN RARE – THE ALFA ROMEO 2000 BERLINA\n\nSome cars of the 1970s are greeted with the words “My dad/mum/teacher/pet goldfish used to have one of those,” but an Alfa Romeo 2000 Berlina never seems to fall into this category. During this writer’s (very distant) youth, it was transport for the ‘smart set’ at the local yachting marina, all suntans, dark glasses, and cocktails on the deck.\n\nRemember to have your say on the future of our classic community!\n\nLast month, the government launched a consultation giving enthusiasts the chance to have their say and help shape future policy on how to protect classic vehicles and safeguard our industry for generations to come.\n\nMeet The Owner - Alex J. Sebbinger-Sparks and his Ford Granada Ghia X Estates\n\nAs one of the leading lights of the Modern Classic Executive Car Club, Alex is naturally a connoisseur of fine 1980s machinery. Some might say owning two Caspian Blue Ford Granada 2.8 Ghia X Mk. 2 Estates is utter decadence—but then, who could resist the lure of such “space-age load carriers”?\n\nMeet The Owner – Emma Cater and Her Ford Fiesta Popular Mk. I\n\nIn the early 1980s, exotic forms of Fiesta, such as the Ghia and the XR2, were comparatively rare sights. These were the cars for sophisticates with an avocado bathroom suite and who even owned a Sony C7 video recorder.\n\nMeet The Owner – Herb and his Fiat 1500\n\nI am 22 years old and have wanted a classic car since my early childhood - you could say I have admired them all my life. I remember my dad having a Morris Oxford Series VI Farina for a while; it was the family car until we found out the floor was made of cornflake packets! It was a great car, and despite that, we went everywhere in it.\n\nTEN EXPERIENCES TO AVOID WHEN BUYING A CLASSIC CAR\n\nMany of us have reflected that dealing with certain vendors is the most challenging aspect of buying a classic car. Here are ten warning signs:\n\nEARL MOUNTBATTEN OF BURMA’S ROVER 3500S\n\nMany readers of a certain age will recall the police P6, whether it was chasing miscreants in a 1970s television crime drama or looming ominously in your rear-view mirror. This 3500S offered for sale by Classic Car Auctions not only brought law and order to the roads around Winchester, but also served as the Earl of Mountbatten’s staff car.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – RUSSELL MACFARLANE AND HIS MORRIS MARINA SUPER\n\nI believe ‘Aqua’ was only available on the Marina for the first year of production. Only six Aqua Marinas are known to exist, split between the 1.3 and the 1.8 and Saloon and Coupe. So, who knows - my 1.8 Super Deluxe Saloon could be the sole survivor in Aqua!\n\nMEET THE OWNER – JOHN LANGFORD AND HIS FORD GRANADA 2.8I GHIA MK. 2\n\n“It is family-owned from new and has only 26k on the clock. The first owner had it for 27 years, and the second was his godson, who kept it for 15 years”. We have previously featured John’s MG Magnette ‘Farina’ Mk. IV and Austin J40, but he has recently embarked on blue oval ownership with his 1982 Ford Granada Ghia 2.8i Mk.2.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – GRAHAM BULL AND HIS VAUXHALL VICTOR 2300SL FE ESTATE\n\n“You just know that this is the car for the man with fawn flared slacks and Yardley Black Label – ‘for the man who sets the pace’ – aftershave”. I wrote this description of Graham Bull’s 2300SL FE Estate in 2017, a memorable day with Practical Classics celebrating the Victor’s 60th birthday.\n\nThe Lancia Thema at 40 by Andrew Roberts\n\n“I’ve always liked Lancia because my grandfather drove a Beta that the whole family loved and I’ve long admired the Thema. It was hard to find one in the UK, so I imported mine from a dealer in the Netherlands, which was neither complicated nor expensive. Mine is a V6 with the PRV engine. I’m not sure why Lancia elected to use that, but I love it.\n\n1984 was a great year…\n\nThis year, we're celebrating something special. Not only is it Lancaster Insurance’s 40th anniversary, but it’s also the 40th anniversary of the Classic Motor Show. We’re thrilled to join forces, yet again, at the UK’s premier classic automotive event to make this year's show bigger and better than ever!\n\nBen Crosby’s Ford Racing Puma 0376\n\nAt the young age of 13 years old Ben was gifted some money and asked his parents if he could invest it in a car. The answer was, of course as long as he invested it wisely, so following on in his Dad’s footsteps he went on the hunt for a Ford Racing Puma, however unfortunately his budget didn’t allow for a concours example!\n\n2024 HERO-ERA London to Lisbon Rally – Platts and Ripley take maiden victory on all-Austin podium!\n\nThe 2024 HERO-ERA London to Lisbon Rally reached the finish on Saturday 4th May, in the historic city of Lisbon, 2800 km and 10 days after it began at Brookland’s, London. The winners of the event were Graham Platts and Neil Ripley, driving a 1956 Austin Healey 100M, the oldest car on the event.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – JON COUPLAND AND HIS TOYOTA MR2 MK.1A\n\n“It is exceptionally rare, being one of the earliest in the UK. It is a Mk.1a, which they only produced for a year (the same as the colour). I know of maybe only four in the UK in that shade”.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – JOHN WALLIS AND HIS BORGWARD P100\n\nIf the fates had been kinder, the name \"Borgward\" would have been as familiar to 2024 drivers as Audi or BMW. John Wallis, a long-term devotee of the German marque, has recently become the custodian of the P100 ‘Big Six' - Borgward's last hurrah and a car with the potential to be one of the finest big saloons of its generation.\n\nMeet The Owner – Steven Gray and his Vauxhall Chevette 2300HS\n\nSteven Gray recently fell prey to a phenomenon known to many classic car owners. There he was, minding his own business and thinking his current fleet of Bedford HAs and Vauxhall Chevettes was quite enough, when suddenly he was caught in the tractor beam of a tempting vehicle.\n\nMeet the Owner - Ian Gillson and his Renault 16TL\n\n“My father had TL back in 1977, and around 1980, the family acquired a 1974 TS. Sadly, it succumbed to the dreaded rust and ended in Renault 16 Heaven, but I never forgot them”.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – JAMES ROSS SINCLAIR AND HIS WOLSELEY 1300\n\nThese things were so popular in the 1960s and 1970s that nobody took any notice of them. There was at least one on every street. By the late 1970s/early 1980s, they were falling apart and becoming a rarer sight. If familiarity breeds contempt, then 50 years after production finally ended, I think objectively, this is a very pretty car.\n\nMeet the Owner – Laurie Taylor-Reed and his 1969 Citroën Dyane 6\n\nThe lower profile of the Dyane in the UK compared with its Citroën 2CV stablemate is one of the abiding mysteries of the classic car world. True, it had a shorter production run than the Deux Chevaux – 1967-1984 – but it offered almost all its virtues together with five doors and such creature comforts as a front ashtray.\n\nMeet The Owner – Harry Traill and His Ford Falcon Wagon\n\nIt is a real head-turner. People look at it and smile. Children will walk with their parents, stopping and pointing at it as it drives past. The car seems to put a smile on anyone’s face wherever I go in it, and the number of compliments you get just going to the shop alone is astounding.\n\nPRIDE OF OWNERSHIP WINNER 2024 – COLIN FIDLER’S AUSTIN A35\n\nColin Fidler’s splendid A35 won the Lancaster Insurance Pride of Ownership 2024 competition and epitomises the sales slogan: “Buy Austin and Be Proud of It!” As he explains: “The car belonged to my late uncle Robin.\n\n“It is a leader amongst cars of today” – The Ford Zephyr-Zodiac Mk. I\n\nSometimes, the connoisseur of 1950s popular culture, such as this writer, is faced with automotive temptation, such as this 1956 Zephyr-Zodiac offered by Craner Classics. The young Arthur Daley would have craved this car, which would have also been the object of admiration among Teddy boys at the Hammersmith Palais.\n\nMeeting An Old Friend – 1983 Austin Ambassador Vanden Plas\n\nSometimes, the world of Ebay is one of surprises – including finding the Austin Ambassador Vanden Plas I once owned. And now Bob Farrington hopes it goes to a good home.\n\nRARER THAN RARE – 1979 FIAT 131 1300CL\n\nSometimes, the most seemingly minor detail about a car remains in the memory: the Wolseley’s illuminated ‘Ghost Light’ grille badge or the Humber Hawk and Super Snipe’s fuel filler hidden behind the offside rear reflector.\n\nStars of The Lancaster Stand No. 1: Vivian the Vauxhall Viva HC\n\nDuring the 2024 Practical Classics Classic Car and Restoration Show, one car on the Lancaster Insurance Stand evoked some entertaining reactions from the showgoers. Visitors to the NEC circled Annie Redshaw-Lloyd’s Glacier Blue Viva HC and peered into the vinyl-trimmed magnificence of its interior.\n\nSTARS AND THEIR CARS - THE PETER SELLERS BENTLEY S2 CONTINENTAL DROPHEAD COUPE\n\nAny 1960 Bentley S2 Continental Drophead Coupe with Park Ward coachwork is a car to beguile and mesmerise. So, when H&H offered such an exquisite machine that was the property of one of our finest actors, the temptation to place family members on eBay to raise the necessary funds was quite acute.\n\nMeet The Owner – Mo Ali and his Fiat 128 Estate\n\nMany of you are familiar with this experience: scanning the Facebook page of a well-known car club when you suddenly see pictures of a vehicle you long believed vanished from British roads. This writer was looking at the Fiat Motor Club GB’s Facebook site only yesterday when Mo Ali’s 1978-model Fiat 128 Estate appeared to leap from the screen.\n\nTHE WORLD’S RAREST WEDGE? – A 1975 MORRIS\n\nThis is not just one of the very few surviving Morris-badged Wedges but the first made on the production line. Chassis Number 00099 left Cowley in 1975 and Leyland despatched it to Longbridge to assess the factory’s build quality. Alas, the Morris became lost in the system but was eventually registered and sold in January 1977 – hence the ‘R’ suffix.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – RACHEL INGLIS AND HER 1965 FORD MUSTANG CELEBRATING THE BRIGHT SPARKS\n\nThe scene: four classic car owners sat in deckchairs at an event: Classic Car Owner (CCO) No.1: “Young people today, eh? When I was their age, I restored a Bugatti Royale I found in an abandoned shed in Southampton Eastern Docks.\n\nMEET SVEN - THE 1964 SAAB GT850\n\nIt would be fair to say that Sven, the 1964 Saab GT850, was one of the stars of the 2024 Practical Classics Classic Car and Restoration Show at the NEC. He dominated Hall 4, his twin aluminium stripes gleaming in the artificial light.\n\nLEYLAND PRINCESS 2200HL – DEFINITELY NOT AN AVERAGE CAR\n\nOne of the most pleasing developments in the classic car world over the past twenty years is the Princess’ Wedge’ at least receiving praise due to such an innovative design. This 1977 2200HL, recently advertised on eBay, is enough to make one re-enact “Great Scenes from Terry and June”.\n\nMeet The Owner - Will Hollands-Smith and his Citroen BX 19TRS Mk.2\n\nWill Hollands-Smith is a most determined young man. Owning the only roadworthy BX Mk. 1 Estate in the country was not enough to satisfy his craving for this very fine model. So, he is also the custodian of a 1986 ex-Citroen UK Mk.2 press launch/dealer demonstrator 19TRS.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – DJ LORD ANTHONY AND HIS LOTUS ELITE\n\nLord Anthony of London, the well-known DJ, has been a devotee of the Lotus Elite “ever since I was a kid. When I was travelling in our family car’s back seat, I caught a glimpse of these exotic beasts neatly lined up in the forecourt of the official Lotus dealership in Drakes Broughton, a small village near Worcestershire”.\n\nMeet The Owner – Steve Cannon and his Austin Maxi 2\n\nThe Austin Maxi was arguably the first of several British Leyland cars to be unfairly judged for too many years. Its potential was vast; in 1969, a family saloon with five doors, a transverse OHC engine driving the front wheels, seats that could form a double bed, and a five-speed transmission was virtual science fiction.\n\nThe UK’s Most Opinionated Automotive Reviews? - Car and The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly\n\nPersonal note: Car magazine was the first motoring title that altered my younger self to how automotive writing could be witty, thought-provoking, and often idiosyncratic. To look at an edition from 1977 is to be immersed in a world of L.J.K. Setright, scoop photographs of prototypes from Hans G. Lehmann and, of course, “The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly”.\n\nMISUNDERSTOOD – THE RILEY PATHFINDER\n\nIt was one of the most attractive saloons of the 1950s, combining overtones of Lancia with the traditional Riley grille. The RMH-series Pathfinder is handsome, imposing, and luxurious and could have represented a new direction for the marque. Yet, for too many years, it was a misunderstood car.\n\nTHE VOLKSWAGEN SCIROCCO AT 50\n\nThe 1974 Geneva Motor Show was the launch venue for one of Volkswagen’s most important models. The Scirocco was their first transverse engine car and their third front-wheel-drive vehicle, after the 1970 K70 and the 1973 Passat. When production ended in 2017 in its third incarnation, it had helped to redefine the Volkswagen name.\n\nA CAR OF DREAMS – JAGUAR 420G\n\n1980 - a Sunday afternoon in a small village pub somewhere in Hampshire. For my ten-year-old self, the atmosphere can be summarised in the following words: locally branded cola, obscure forms of potato crisps, Space Invaders and stultifying, Tony Hancock-style boredom.\n\nAnnouncing our December Bright Young Spark, Courtney Ward!\n\nMy love for cars has definitely become my way of life. My grandfather was a brilliant mechanic, so naturally my dad followed suit with a passion for cars and detailing; I've grown up around it.\n\nThe Ford Capri II at Fifty by Andrew Roberts!\n\nWhen Ford unveiled the Capri II on the 25th of February 1974, they faced a vast challenge – how do you improve on the original Capri?\n\nCongratulations to Les, our Austin Healey winner!\n\nLast year we gave you the chance to WIN a beautifully restored Austin Healey. We had thousands of entries, and we can announce that the lucky winner was Les!\n\nFORGOTTEN HERO - THE LANCIA FLAVIA\n\nQuite simply, the Flavia was a crucial model in Lancia’s history - their first front-wheel-drive car. It is also hard to envisage how unusual a sight it would have been in the UK when it was new. Autocar described the Flavia as “a car for the connoisseur”, and Motor Sport regarded the Lancia not so much as a status symbol but as a:\n\nThe SEAT 600 – The Car That Changed a Nation\n\nIt is a scenario familiar to many of us. You are casually scanning the eBay listings, gazing at the cars you cannot afford, when one vehicle metaphorically leaps out of the screen.\n\nMATCHBOX TOYS AT SEVENTY\n\nThis blog is by way of a triple celebration. Lesney issued its first Matchbox die-cast model in 1953, its first buses and lorries in 1954, and for seven decades they have delighted motoring enthusiasts of all ages.\n\nThe Car That Came In From The Cold – The Borgward P100\n\nFor many years, this writer has regarded the Borgward P100 ‘Big Six’ as one of the most fascinating German cars of its generation. To find an ex-Guernsey RHD example being recently sold by Classic Car Auctions | 1961 B rgward P100 B g S x-F r Sale sorely tempted him, for the P100 belongs in a world of Cold War spies.\n\nMeet The Owner – Callum Cubbage and his Talbot-Matra Murena\n\nFor many years, I thought my father’s gold Talbot-Matra Murena 1.6 was one of the most unusual cars he had ever owned. Certainly, no one else in our village had decided to invest in an LHD three-seater mid-engine coupe. So, imagine my delight in seeing Callum’s example. He remarks: “This car is totally original apart from the replacement engine.\n\nMeet The Owner – Michael Drewry and his Austin Ambassador 2.0 HL\n\nMichael is the owner of one of the most misunderstood cars to hail from the British Leyland empire. To quell one myth immediately, the motoring press did not lambast the Austin Ambassador. Motor Sport was impressed by the trim’s quality and noted how the ride, handling, and steering had all been improved compared with its predecessor.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – CALLUM ANDERSON AND HIS VAUXHALL ASTRA EXP\n\nMarvel at the Hazelnut Metallic paintwork. Thrill to the Antique Gold side stripe and wheels, glass sunroof, front fog lamps and tinted windows. Then savour the decadence of the Chevron Tweed upholstery. In 1982, to spend £4,995 and upwards on a Vauxhall Astra EXP was to be a member of the suburban elite – i.e. the sort of person who had a Sony C7 video recorder in their living room.\n\nWolseley Running Report\n\nOr what I have learned and experienced over the past twelve months. i) Panic. Yes, that was the emotion I felt on seeing smoke billow from the radiator grille and the boot last summer when the Wolseley was taking part in a show.\n\nMEET THE OWNER - PATRICK BRADLEY AND HIS AUSTIN MAESTRO 1.3L PRESS CAR\n\nWe have previously featured Patrick’s Maestro Advantage and Montego Vanden Plas Automatic, and the latest member of his fleet is equally fascinating. In his words:\n\nTen Remarks You Do Not Want to Hear at Your Local Classic Car Show\n\nA well-run local car show is one of the joys of the year. But, as many owners will tell you, the main challenge is coping with such remarks as these -\n\nTHE WORLD’S RAREST HILMAN? THE BRITISH MOTOR MUSEUM’S HILLMAN GT\n\nVisitors to the British Motor Museum are guaranteed to be mesmerised by the sheer variety of rare machinery on display – including a very exclusive member of the Rootes Group 'Arrow' family. In 1969, the Hillman GT was the perfect car for the motorist who regarded a Jason King moustache and string-back driving gloves as high style.\n\nMeet The Owner - James Ross Sinclair and his BMW 320/6\n\nThe 3-Series was probably the first BMW to gain mass popularity in the UK. Speeding Home Counties motorists in the 1970s might have encountered a Thames Valley police 3.0S and a successful barrister might have chosen 528 but even the cheapest of the 02s were never widely seen. James Ross Sinclair is the proud owner of a 1982 320/6 A in splendid condition.\n\n“Sheer poetry in motion”– The Hindustan Contessa\n\nFor many Britons, the final of 25,085 VXs leaving the Luton factory in July 1978 marked the end of the Victor story, one that commenced in 1957. But this was not quite the end of the narrative, as Vauxhall sold the design to Hindustan Motors for £1.5 million. In the 1990s, the Contessa appeared in several films and was known as “the muscle car of India”.\n\nTen More Lost Motoring Sights\n\nYoung people, eh? With their music, their hairstyles, and their IT gadgets. They will never have experienced the joys of trudging along a dual carriageway in the rain, looking for a working public telephone box to call for a breakdown truck. Or any of these:\n\nThe BMW 2002 Turbo at Fifty\n\nAs I recently noted in my blog about the 3-Series, during the 1970s, any BMW seemed to be an exclusive sight on British roads, while the 2002 Turbo belonged in the realm of the exotic.\n\nRosemary Smith - 7th August 1937 - 5th December 2023\n\nIn the beginning, I was a dizzy blonde, the young one with the blonde hair and false eyelashes. Then, after I started winning things, there was a bit more of a grudging acceptance, and then when I got the drive with Rootes in England, they started to take note: ‘She must be quite good. Now, when I talk to some people I raced against, I get much more respect.\n\nAUSTIN A90 ATLANTIC\n\nSeventy-five years ago, the A90 Atlantic was a star of the first post-war London Motor Show. Many of the 562,954 visitors to Earls Court were agog at those gold-faced instruments, the ECKO radio set, the heater, the centrally mounted fog lamp and the \"Jewelescent\" paint finish. Plus, any car with a power-operated hood was a world apart from a realm of smog, Woodbines and queuing for the cheese ration.\n\n1970 AUSTIN-HEALEY SPRITE\n\nIn late 1969, British Leyland extensively revised the MG Midget Mk. III and its Austin-Healey Sprite Mk. IV companion model. The black grilles and Ro-Style wheels altered the line-up’s image. It was farewell to blazers, cravats and Graham Hill moustaches and hello to Jason King sideburns and large amounts of Hai Karate aftershave. And who could resist the “Racy 3-spoke steering wheel with simulated leather-bound rim”?\n\n1955 CITROEN ‘ONZE NORMALE’ TRACTION AVANT\n\nWhen Citroën unveiled the original Traction Avant to the public on the 18th of April 1934, it marked an evolutionary step in the development of the motor car. There was the elegant uni-body construction, the front wheel drive, the torsion bar suspension and the hydraulic brakes. By comparison, other saloons of that era looked as though they had recently emerged from The Ark.\n\n1967 JAGUAR E-TYPE\n\nIn December of 1961, Car & Driver rhapsodised over the E-Type: Our first impressions of taking over this car are not easy to describe. The car is beautiful to look at from any angle, and it was said by many, who saw it in the flesh for the first time when meeting our test crew, that pictures so far published had all failed to do justice to its appearance.\n\nROVER 2600 SD1\n\nWhen British Leyland commenced work on the SD1, David Bache, Rover’s Head of Design, intended to create a five-door supercar on a limited budget. He later stated: “It may be more difficult to achieve high standards with a simpler design because more intensive development is needed:\n\nFORD SIERRA SAPPHIRE RS COSWORTH\n\n\"It's not for the inexperienced, but oh, how it rewards skilful, fluent, driving\". That is how Ford promoted the new Sapphire RS Cosworth on its launch in 1988 – \"Developed on the track, there's little to touch it on the road\".\n\n2004 MG SV-R\n\nThe best things about the car, however, remain the chassis and the steering, which has a lovely feel to it. The chassis is sharp without feeling snappy, taut without riding harshly. The car feels smart and intimate: you feel on top of the job.\n\n1993 Ford Fiesta\n\n1993 – a time when Meat Loaf announced I’d Do Anything for Love (But I Won’t Do That) and when Angus Deayton still hosted Have I Got News For You. And a time when a Ford Fiesta was a familiar sight. Thirty years later, time and the impact of various scrappage schemes means that it is now an increasingly rare sight on British roads.\n\n1967 Mini T – The Mini From Italy\n\nAt first glance, this handsome Mini looks like a prime example of a Morris Mk.1 Traveller. Then you notice the left-hand-drive layout and the unfamiliar badging. It is, in fact, a 1967 Innocenti Mini T - one of the 437,234 Minis built in Milan.\n\n70 YEARS OF VOLKSWAGEN IN THE UK\n\nThe 1953 London Motor Show marked the first time a British motorist could buy a German car since the Second World War, but the Beetle had been a presence on the UK’s roads for a number of years. VW had sold them to British service personnel in Germany for £150 during the late 1940s, and on demob, they were allowed to take their Beetles home.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – ELTON MURPHY AND HIS OPEL COMMODORE GS\n\nJust take a look at the veloured magnificence of that interior, with wooden decorations reminiscent of a top-of-the-range hostess trolley. Then, marvel at the vinyl roof, the matt black grille and those elaborate wheels.\n\nA VISIT TO THE 1953 LONDON MOTOR SHOW\n\nIt is the 21st October 1953, and the Duke of Edinburgh is to open the London Motor Show - an event that heralds the beginning of the post-war buyer’s market. Of course, Vauxhall buyers might still be awaiting delivery of the Wyvern or Velox they bought in 1947 and Morris dealers may still be fulfilling orders for the Minor placed in 1948.\n\nThe Forgotten Ford Granada – Made By Hyundai\n\nSome of us (all right, me) have long been fascinated with large European saloons that enjoyed an afterlife or a parallel career in another continent. India’s Hindustan Contessa (aka the Vauxhall Victor FE) and the Standard 2000 (aka the Rover SD1) are prime examples of the former; we have the Hyundai-built Ford Granada Mk for the latter. II.\n\nTHE WORLD’S OLDEST LANDCRAB?– A 1963 PRE-PRODUCTION AUSTIN 1800\n\nIt is always a pleasure to follow the progress of a car you wrote about previously. Many years ago, I compared a pre-production Austin 1800 ‘Landcrab’ with a Slough-built Citroën ID19 for Classic Cars magazine and described it as “a scaled-up BMC 1100 and is just as enjoyable to drive”. And now 531 NOF is in search of a new custodian.\n\nTHE MORRIS MINOR TRAVELLER AT SEVENTY\n\nAutocar of 9th October 1953 profiled a new version of a vehicle, one “considered by many people as a classic design of its type, and as such is often used as a yardstick when comparing small cars”. They further praised the “very bright and light interior” and the “particularly useful luggage compartment”. It was, of course, the Morris Minor “Travellers Car”.\n\nA Car of My Dreams - The Fiat 2300 Familiare\n\nI recently wrote about how and why I craved a Fiat 2300, and, by pure chance, one is being sold by Anglia Car Auctions in November. Better still, this 1967 example is the even more exclusive Familiare estate version, in RHD form, and is possibly the only surviving version in the UK with optional automatic transmission.\n\nAnnouncing our September Bright Young Sparks Winner!\n\nMark’s Story……. ‘I’ve found my passion' Mark Wager followed his dream after being knocked back at school.\n\nCMS News\n\nThe UK’s biggest and best is only 2 months away! Prepare for an awe-inspiring journey through automotive history at the Lancaster Insurance Classic Motor Show 2023!\n\n75 years of the Morris Minor by Andrew Roberts\n\nThe 1949 Morris models are being kept secret until today. We believe an aerodynamic car with the four-cylinder side-valve engine used in the former “Eight,” known as the Morris Minor, will be on show, together with larger models, one of which will be called the Morris Oxford. Go and see for yourselves!\n\nClub of the month: Marina Owners Club\n\nAs many clubs begin to get planning for the Lancaster Insurance Classic Motor Show in November, we hear the Marina Owners Club have already pulled out all the stops to create a show stopping display for the ‘Perfect Partners’ theme.\n\nLancaster Insurance enhance specialist MX-5 scheme to offer owners reduced premiums\n\nRenowned for its MX-5 cover options, and close association with the model, Lancaster Insurance is thrilled to be reinforcing its commitment by developing its specialist scheme to offer owners reduced premiums across the MX-5 range.\n\nTHE ROVER 75 AT 25\n\nOn the 20th October, the Rover 75 will celebrate its quarter-century – a fact that seems impossible to many classic enthusiasts of a certain vintage. For many of us, including this writer, it seems to be almost yesterday that Mr. J Clarkson reported on the Rover's launch for Top Gear -\n\nMeet the Owner - Joseph Lane and his Police Wolseley 6/80\n\nOur old friend Joseph Lane has recently acquired another Wolseley to join his 6/90 and the other members of his classic police car fleet. His 1953 6/80 is the sort of vehicle that seems to dominate the output of Talking Pictures Television; a car associated with such black & white film dialogue as “You got me bang to rights Inspector!’ and “Dash it all, Superintendent – I was dining at the Blue Parrot nightclub that evening!”.\n\nMeet the Owner – Tony Ludovico and his Alfa Romeo Alfa 6\n\nMy car was registered in Italy in 1986, but it was actually manufactured in 1984. I imported it to the UK it in 2018 after it had stood in a barn in Verona for 16 years - and after a wash and wax and the original paintwork was still amazing!\n\nTHE VOLVO 145 - A CELEBRATION\n\nAs most readers already know, earlier this year, Volvo announced the demise of their estates, ending a tradition that commenced in 1962 with the station wagon version of the Amazon. Five years later, its 145 successor founded a dynasty that lasted until as recently as 1993 and is still the image conjured by so many Britons on hearing the words “Volvo Estate”.\n\nMeet The Owner – Scarlett Devey and her Austin A40 Somerset\n\nCreativity can spring from the strangest of places. Sometimes, it’s a case of making the most of what you have – for Scarlett Devey, it wasn’t a case of ‘make do and mend’, more ‘build back, and better’. Having spent her life to date around classics, custom cars and hot rods, she knew that she wanted something special for her first car; as it turned out, an Austin A40 Somerset more than fit the bill.\n\nThe real cost of restoring an MGB\n\nWhen describing the MGB, words like ‘seminal’ and ‘evergreen’ come to mind. A worldwide favourite, beloved among enthusiasts, it remains an obvious candidate for restoration, owing to the parts supply, advice and support network available. But should you take the plunge? The MG Owners’ Club (MGOC) stepped into the breach to advise.\n\nMeet The Owner – Alex Sebbinger and his Rover 825 Sterling\n\nCars go through hundreds – if not thousands – of interim changes during their production lifetimes. The purest of their kind, they’re normally the rarest of all; altered, improved, facelifted, or scrapped early on after flaws were exposed. Few survive, and even fewer are cherished. For arch Rover 800 enthusiast, Alex Sebbinger, his 1986 825 Sterling is something of a holy grail.\n\nMEET THE OWNER -ABDUL SHAIKH AND HIS VAUXHALL VENTORA V.I.P.\n\nSome limited-edition cars were to clear the showroom of stocks before the launch of a replacement model. Others marked the end of a long and distinguished production run, while a third group enhanced the appeal of a recently introduced line-up. The Ventora V.I.P. falls into this last-named category, and there are now believed to be only two on the road.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – MICHAEL DICKENS AND HIS LADA RIVA\n\n“I found it in a scrap yard in Kempston. The old lady that owned it from new had crashed it into her house and stopped driving. Her family scrapped it, and I bought it blind for £300 to cannibalise it for parts for my 1994 Riva Estate. It was immaculate when it turned up (aside from a dented wing and smashed headlamp), and I just couldn’t break it up.”\n\nRARER THAN RARE – 1966 RENAULT 16\n\nWhen Renault GB introduced the 16 to British motorists in the autumn of 1965, it would be fair to say it did not resemble any UK family saloon. To quote the advertisement: “The Renault l6 is a new breed of car. Compare the looks of the new Renault 16 with other 1 ½ litre cars”. This 1966 De Luxe is believed to be the oldest surviving British market example.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – PHIL CAUNT AND HIS HEINZ 57 WOLSELEY HORNET CONVERTIBLE\n\n“I must first say I did NOT restore it myself—I purchased it with it needing 'minor amendments' to make it how I wanted it, including removing some extra work that the previous owner wanted, plus adding some overriders, going over the fuel system, and other 'tweaks'. It is a lovely car, but of course, unless you know it's a 'Heinz,' Joe Public thinks it is a Wolseley Hornet that has just had a chop job!”\n\nMEET THE EXPERT – SARAH CRABTREE\n\nReaders will instantly know the name of Sarah Crabtree, as the director of Evoke Classics, from the television series Bangers and Cash, and from meeting her at events in the company of Ivan, her Morris Ital. This writer has had the great privilege of witnessing Sarah pilot this fine machine around the Silverstone circuit – an experience never to be forgotten!\n\nTHE FIAT 131 AT 50 By Andrew Roberts\n\nIt is always a pleasant experience to be reacquainted with Theo Kyriacou’s Sport, which goes by the Nom-de-Fiat of Hugo.\n\nMeet The Owner – Herb and his Fiat 1500\n\n“I am 22 years old and have wanted a classic car since my early childhood - you could say I have admired them all my life. I remember my dad having a Morris Oxford Series VI Farina for a while; it was the family car until we found out the floor was made of cornflake packets!\n\nThe Mini Moke at 60 by Andrew Roberts\n\nTo celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Mini Moke, we travel to Portmeirion in North Wales, where this writer had the honour of encountering one of the most famous automotive television stars of the 20th century.\n\nWe name RAC as our exclusive breakdown partner\n\nWe are pleased to announce that we are now offering RAC roadside assistance as a new add-on policy benefit for customers with cover starting from £19.95.\n\nExciting New Feature: Podcast Lounge at the Lancaster Insurance Classic Motor Show!\n\nWe’re thrilled to announce a brand-new feature at this year’s Lancaster Insurance Classic Motor Show: The Podcast Lounge!\n\nTWENTY MOTORING MEMORIES\n\nWhile on wedding car duty (look out for another blog soon), I pondered how a 1960 Wolseley 6/99 appeared to modern traffic and my advanced age. Was I really aged only 14 and contemplating my GCE O-Level options when Lancaster Insurance was formed in 1984? And here are 20 aspects of motoring and transport that might be lost on the youth of today:\n\nMEET THE OWNER – MARK DENTON AND HIS JOWETT JAVELIN\n\nA friend in the village I grew up in had it from 1967 until he passed away 22 years ago. I never thought the car would ever come on the market! I like the lines of the Javelin – they remind me of the Vanguard – and the work of its designer, Gerald Palmer! My car is a Javelin De Luxe, first registered to Jowett’s sales manager, Arthur Joplin.\n\nRARER THAN RARE – THE SINGER HUNTER\n\nH&H Classic Auction will be selling, on the 24th of July, one of the most unusual saloons for the 1950s. Singer marketed the Hunter as the car “for the connoisseur who likes his spirited motoring in comfort” – and it was the famous Coventry firm’s last independent design.\n\nMEET THE OWNER – CHRIS JAMES AND HIS ROVER 623SLI\n\nThe 623 popped up on FB Marketplace locally in Middlesbrough when I was on holiday in France. I messaged the vendor, and she said someone was going to view it the next day. He did view, but then could not sort insurance on it. She messaged to say her husband was taking it off sale, but I gave her my number should that change. She got in touch just before we returned from holiday to say if I wanted it, I could have it for £450!!."
