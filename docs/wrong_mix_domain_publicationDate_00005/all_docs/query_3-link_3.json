        "text": "Yes, the darkness novels are fantasy although you could say he is just placing WWII in a fantasy setting.\n\nSo if you like military SF and would like the same thing in a fantasy setting this series could be for you.\n\nTurtledove has written quite a lot of fantasy. You can't say the man has no talent. His knowledge of history is fabulous but his books are rather dry.\n\nMaybe you could try his most famous fantasy series : the Videssos novels (4 books I believe). It's about a Roman legion from around 50 BC that's transported into an unknown world called Videssos. Funny thing is Videssos is based on Byzantium. So you could say the Romans are transported into a fantasy version of their own future.\n\nhis Videssos books are closer to classic fantasy than any other by Turtledove - in that he uses magic, an original religious system, complex worldbuilding. He can be \"wordy\" [i was heavily bored by the second half of \"Guns for the South\"] but he is a natural storyteller, with an eye for dialogue, good characterisation and [his forte in my opinion] well developed battle scenes, either in individual duels or large scale armies. He also has a sense of humor, as seen in some short story parodies.\n\nI read a few of Turtledove's alternate WWII books, with the lizard invasion. At first I really enjoyed them. Found them extremely original and interesting, taking those semi-factual elements, and merging them with science fiction. Unfortunately, as I continued reading further books, it lost momentum, lacked direction, and just wasn't going anywhere, to the point where I've yet to finish them off. (If he ever did finish them)\n\nI'd say he's one of those middle of the road authors, where you just have to try it, and see if it works for you or not.\n\nAnother thing with Turtledove : the man writes a lot !\n\nHis bibliography is almost a small novel on itself. I believe that in the past 3 years he wrote around 10-11 new novels, none of them slim volumes.\n\nTurtledove is also busy editing anthologies and he writes a lot of short fiction, both for anthologies and magazines like Analog and Asimov's. And I believe he also writes historical fiction under the name Harry Turteltaub.\n\nOf course there are \"fast writers\" but it's likely some of his work would be better if he took some more time writing/editing his output.\n\nI'm thinking about trying his new saga set in a winter world, Beyond the Gap, or his new saga about Atlantis being the 8th continent on our world, Opening Atlantis.\n\nHas anyone read these?\n\nI read both; I liked Beyond the Gap a lot and I will definitely seek out the sequel; it is a semi-fantasy, semi Arctic quest with interesting characters.\n\nOne of the better Turtledove novels I've read; however if you do not like stories with characters fighting the snow and ice more than enemies (though that comes too) you may get bored; if you liked books about Scott, Amundsen, or Jules Verne Captain Hatteras and the like, you will probably like this one.\n\nOpening Atlantis was kind of boring, I skimmed through it; it's multigenerational (and I rarely like such), following an English family that settles a new continent in the middle of the Atlantic starting around the 1460's; then America is discovered too, many countries settle Atlantis, slaves appear, the French are the baddies with lots of slaves, the English Atlanteans and The English proper though fight the French together despise one another and you get the drift where it's most likely going in the next books; though the last character (there are 3 or 4 generations) seems more interesting so I may check the next one too.\n\nI read both; I liked Beyond the Gap a lot and I will definitely seek out the sequel; it is a semi-fantasy, semi Arctic quest with interesting characters.\n\nOne of the better Turtledove novels I've read; however if you do not like stories with characters fighting the snow and ice more than enemies (though that comes too) you may get bored; if you liked books about Scott, Amundsen, or Jules Verne Captain Hatteras and the like, you will probably like this one.\n\nI actually love those sort of books, I started a thread on such books a while ago. It's a reason for me to try this new series as well. The Atlantis story sounds different from what I was looking for ( I was thinking more about a race of real Atlanteans popping up in our world).\n\nWert\n\nI was wondering about Turtledove's insane writing speed as well. For next year alone he has 4 brand new books coming out. The man is in a different league even from very fast writers like Butcher, Erikson or Stephen King.\n\nI'm going to check his baclist to see what else might be to my interest.\n\nYou can add Iain Banks to that list. He writes his novels (which are usually 300-400 pages long but Matter is about 550 pages) in less than two months, and then takes the rest of the year off. Turtledove obviously writes as fast as Banks but simply doesn't stop, and given his books are slightly longer, that makes it all the more impressive.\n\nLike I said though, what's more impressive is that whilst Turtledove isn't exactly a finely-honed writer of prose, he is entertaining (most of the time) and readable, which is incredible given his rate of output."
