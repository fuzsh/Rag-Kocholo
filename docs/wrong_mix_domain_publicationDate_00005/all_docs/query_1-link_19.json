        "text": "DALLAS, July 24, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- The Andrew Wyly Film Company recently acquired the film rights to four books authored by Harry Turtledove:\n\nHow Few Remain\n\nThe Great War: American Front\n\nThe Great War: Walk in Hell\n\nThe Great War: Breakthroughs\n\nTurtledove has been dubbed \"The Master of Alternate History,\" and his novels have been credited with bringing alternate history into the mainstream. His style of alternate history has a strong military theme with scenes of combat happening throughout many of his works and has sold tens of millions of copies.\n\nWyly is passionate about Turtledove's series of works due to his interest and background in history—he earned his undergraduate degree in history from Denison University. \"I'm looking forward to utilizing my skills as both a filmmaker and historian to bring audiences an entertaining twist on American History while maintaining the integrity of the novels,\" Wyly stated.\n\nHow Few Remain\n\nThe Series takes place in America starting in the year 1881. The events occur in an alternate universe where the Confederate States of America didn't lose the Civil War and continued their existence. The point of divergence is September 10, 1862 during the American Civil War. In our timeline a Confederate messenger lost General Robert E. Lee's Special Orders 191, which detailed Lee's plans. The orders were soon found by Union soldiers, and using them George McClellan was able to defeat the Army of Northern Virginia at the Battle of Antietam.\n\nIn How Few Remain, the orders are instead recovered by a trailing Confederate soldier. McClellan is caught by surprise, enabling Lee to lead the Army of Northern Virginia to victory. Lee forces McClellan into battle on the banks of the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania and destroys the Army of the Potomac in the battle of Camp Hill in October. Lee goes on to capture Philadelphia, earning the Confederate States of American diplomatic recognition from both Britain and France, thus winning the war (which is known as the War of Secession in the alternate timeline) and independence from the United States.\n\nWyly is meeting with several studios and networks to find the right partner to develop and produce the 10 episode mini-series with.
