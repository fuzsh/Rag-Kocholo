Picture a tribe within the modern corporate world, where every member feels like family and the collective triumphs are celebrated as personal victories.\n\nClan Culture thrives on tight-knit relationships, mutual trust, and a deep sense of belonging. It's not just about achieving goals; it's about doing so together, fueled by a sense of solidarity that transcends hierarchies.\n\nIn this culture, mentorship isn't a formality, but a way of life. Seasoned veterans take fledglings under their wing, nurturing talent and passing down wisdom, ensuring the flame of innovation burns brightly for generations to come.\n\nHere, the office isn't just a workplace; it's a home away from home, where laughter echoes through the halls and collaboration knows no bounds. Each challenge becomes an opportunity to strengthen bonds and showcase the resilience of the clan.\n\nIn a world where competition often drives a wedge between colleagues, Clan Culture stands as a beacon of unity and shared success. After all, when you're part of a clan, you're never alone in the journey toward greatness.\n\nI will talk about an experiment (the MAD Co.) where I tried forming a \"clan\" in my next article . . .\n\nClifford m Aravind Fernando"
