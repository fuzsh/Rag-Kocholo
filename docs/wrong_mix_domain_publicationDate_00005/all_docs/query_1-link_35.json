        "text": "A History of What Comes Next, the thrilling first installment in a new series from Sylvain Neuvel, stars a mother-daughter pair of Kibsu women, highly intelligent beings whose sole goal is “to take [humanity] to the stars before Evil comes and kills them all.” Sara and her daughter Mia entice German aerospace engineer Wernher von Braun to join a secret U.S. government program to recruit Nazi scientists, and carefully disclose intelligence to get the Soviets focused on building rockets of their own. The balance of wry narration, wired action, and delicate worldbuilding make for deeply gratifying reading. Here Sylvain picks ten of his favorite alternate histories.\n\nAlternative history (noun) 1: fiction that is based on history and that explores what might have happened if certain historical events, figures, etc., had been different.\n\nThat’s how Merriam-Webster defines the genre, but books are rebellious little things and they’ll test that definition in any way they can. What counts as a historical event? What exactly does “different” mean? Just think of Outlander. There are plenty of historical events in the series, and, as far as I know, there was no time-traveling nurse present at any of them, yet I’m willing to bet many would not describe it as alternate history. It’s not entirely clear that my own book qualifies, either, since all the historical events are real. I just involved fictional characters in them. Perhaps more importantly, books are rarely monolithic. Part of Cixin Liu’s The Three-Body Problem, for example, fits the definition to a T, but the book is so many other things as well that alt-history may not be the first, second, or third thing that comes to mind when talking about it.\n\nWhether they fit Webster’s definition or not, here are ten very different books, old and new, that mess with the past in unique and interesting ways. Some show us a vastly different reality, others are set in a world barely distinguishable from our own."
