Will there be more Videssos novels?\n\nAlthough Turtledove hasn't ruled more novels out, and has, in fact, indicated that he would like to write more in the Videssos universe, there are currently no plans for any future Videssos novels.\n\nThe Worldwar series was originally a four book sequence, but in 1998, Turtledove sold a trilogy set about twenty years after the original series, followed by a single book coda which is much more science fictional in nature than the earlier volumes..\n\nThe Worldwar Tetrology\n\nWorldwar: In the Balance (1994)\n\nWorldwar: Tilting the Balance (1995)\n\nWorldwar: Upsetting the Balance (1996)\n\nWorldwar: Striking the Balance (1996)\n\nColonization Trilogy\n\nColonization: Second Contact (1999)\n\nColonization: Down to Earth (2000)\n\nColonization: Aftershocks (2001)\n\nCoda\n\nHomeward Bound (2004)\n\n5.1.4.

Will there be more Great War novels?\n\nThe series appears well and fully done.\n\n5.1.4.2. Will the Great War be continued to World War II?\n\nThe Settling Accounts series covered World War II's period.\n\n5.1.4.3. What is up with the map in The Victorious Opposition?\n\nIn the first edition of The Victorious Opposition, the map appears to place Philadelphia in New Jersey and other similar errors. The map is printed from multiple plates. One of the plates got shifted, resulting in city names and rivers not lining up with the states' borders. It should be corrected in future editions.\n\n5.1.4.4. Is there a novel titled Settling Accounts?\n\nThe originally a fourth volume of the Great War series was to have been called Settling Accounts. Before it was published, a follow-up trilogy was sold, American Empire, was sold and the title was eventually applied to the third series in the time-line.\n\n5.1.5.

Will there be more Darkness novels?\n\nTurtledove has hinted that the Darkness series may run to as many as six or seven books.\n\n5.2. Are The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump and Thessalonica related?\n\nThessalonica is set in the same universe as The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump, although approximately thirteen centuries earlier. While the universe dynamics are the same, the books are very different in nature, TCotTSD being a humorous, pun-laden mystery set in modern Los Angeles and T set in a besieged Medieval Thessalonica. Although humor does appear in T, it is nowhere near the same extent as in TCotTSD.\n\n5.2.1. Is Between the Rivers related to The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump?\n\nAlthough Between the Rivers shared some thematic links to TCotTSD (notably henotheism), evidence indicates that they are not in the same universe.\n\n5.2.1.1. What is Henotheism?\n\nHenotheism is the belief that many gods exist, their strengths based on the number of worshippers they attract.\n\n6.1. Will there ever be a sequel to The Guns of the South?\n\nAlthough Dr. Turtledove rarely rules out writing additional stories in his universes, he has commented that the changes in the world of The Guns of the South multiply so quickly that he really isn't sure where things go much beyond the end of the novel. Future books in this world, therefore, are unlikely.\n\n6.2. Will the Worldwar and the Great War series tie together?\n\nNo. Worldwar was written based (until the invasion) on our own real time line. The Great War time line diverged in the 1860s. There is no way to reconcile the different histories.\n\n6.3. Will any of the created characters from Worldwar make an appearance in the Great War series?\n\nNo. Although Turtledove could include some of the older characters from the Worldwar series, he has stated that they will not show up in the Great War time line.\n\n7.1. Where can I read fan-fiction (fanfic) set in Dr. Turtledove's worlds?\n\nAlthough Dr. Turtledove is flattered that his readers would want to write stories in his worlds, the copyright issues which occur with fan fiction lead him to ask that fans refrain from writing such stories.\n\n8.1. What is happening with Winter of Our Discontent?"
