        "text": "I phound this series https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phule's_Company_(series) through grabbing the first one off the take a book leave a book table at my local CoOp market and enjoyed so I went looking to buy the next in the series but what I found at amazon was no kindle option and the usual used book availability...\n\nA bit of googling found lots of dubious links to \"free\" pdf versions some that seemed to use add supported pdf readers... the ones i looked at in general smelled bad to me and perhaps they could be used to install add ware or virus riders software...\n\nAt a guess this is all due to the financial problems that Asprin had over the last years of his life but I would be happy to buy epub versions of his books to perhaps benefit his estate i just did not seem to find any that I had confidence in.\n\nBefore I go buy the used paperbacks at amazon I thought I would ask here.\n\nIn all honesty downloading reader software other than that provided by Apple in its operating systems or the Kindle apps from Amazon makes me nervous but a naked PDF file would be acceptable as I don't think they can carry a gotca virus load.\n\nAce put out the Phule series and I think it's out of print now. Jody Lynn Nye is Asprin's widow and may have gotten the rights back, but new versions have not been put out in ebooks that I'm aware. She has continued the M.Y.T.H. Inc. series, which Baen has most of, I think. I don't think you're going to be able to find valid ebooks for Phule.\n\nI enjoyed #1 and # 2 and never read #3 but I will read it next week\n\nThe first 3 are now at the kindle shop Phule's Company and Phule's Paradise (Phule's Company … have been available for a few months.\n\nA Phule And His Money (Phule’s Company Book 3) is the one where the new author steps in so when it goes live on 8 March 2017 I well grab it and see if the quality does indeed fall off... Humor is such a delicate thing... I think a case can be made that it is the most difficult subgenera to \"get Right\"\n\nthis is the co author's bio from Amazon and looks like his chosen solo area is mystery based on the works of mark twain\n\nPeter Heck is the author of the \"Mark Twain Mysteries,\" six novels featuring the famous author as a detective, set in the 1890s. He is also co-author (with the late Robert Asprin) of four books in the \"Phule's Company\" series of comic military SF novels..\n\nBefore setting out as a novelist, Peter worked as an editor at Ace Books and has freelanced for Baen and Del Rey, editing Spider Robinson, Robert Sawyer and Harry Turtledove (among others). Before that, he created the SF newsletter Xignals and its mystery equivalent Crime Times for the Waldenbooks chain. He is also a long-time reviewer for Asimov's Science Fiction."
