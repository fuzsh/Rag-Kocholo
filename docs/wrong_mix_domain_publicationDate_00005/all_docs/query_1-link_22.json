Hey ho, tunes?\n\nI was actually thinking of the Southern Victory series (which this sounds like the start of) as a potential reason for him having been dropped by his UK publishers - an 11 book series in which the UK sides with a Confederacy set on emulating the Nazis (complete with the Final Solution directed at the black populace) and the US and Germany are the good guys of both WWI and WWII? Not guaranteed good sales on this side of the Pond.\n\n(I'm not sure massive series with double figure book counts were ever as popular with UK publishers as US, even without the dubious premise of this one).\n\nSpoiler: The USA wins in the end."
