Now, in the first of a brand-new trilogy, he rewrites the history of the world with the existence of an eighth continent...\n\nAtlantis lies between Europe and the East Coast of Terranova. For many years, this land of opportunity lured dreamers from around the globe with its natural resources, offering a new beginning for those willing to brave the wonders of the unexplored land."
