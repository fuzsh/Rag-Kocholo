        "text": "Historians felt the pull of “counter-factualism” even before Pascal tried imagining how a different nose on Cleopatra’s face, one less pleasing to Antony, might have resulted in a different world. But they have generally resisted dealings in the hypothetical. In 1997, while vigorously defending counter-factualism’s intellectual possibilities, Niall Ferguson had to spend much of his long introduction to “Virtual History”—a compendium of what-if scenarios by well-credentialled professors—addressing the scorn that has been heaped upon the approach.\n\nA whole range of historical outlooks, from belief in divine will to scientific determinism, have no time for it. Ferguson rolled his own eyes over an earlier what-if anthology, edited by J. C. Squire in 1932, for the way it made counter-factualism a “jeu d’esprit, a vehicle for wishful thinking or reductive explanation—and, above all, high table humour.” Hoping for gravitas, Ferguson assembled his own crew with strict instructions against mission creep: the contributors to “Virtual History” were to keep things plausible by restricting their substitute outcomes to those “which contemporaries contemplated.” In other words, no what-might-have-beens that weren’t once “viable alternatives.”\n\nThe results can be enlightening, but they’re not much fun. Ferguson’s historians—wondering “What if Home Rule had been enacted in 1912?” and “What if Charles I had avoided the Civil War?”—are speculative but sober; in for a penny, not for a pound. One of them, Andrew Roberts (“What if Germany had invaded Britain in May 1940?”), went on to edit another anthology in 2004 (“What Might Have Been”). His writers, a more journalistic lot than Ferguson’s, operate with a little more narrative daring (“The coronation of Queen Elizabeth II took place on a fine, fair day in January 1606”), but often not much. Simon Heffer starts with a slam-bang premise and title (“The Brighton Bomb Kills Margaret Thatcher”), but goes wobbly when pushing himself to imagine Britain under the Prime Minister’s most likely successor, Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine: “It is reasonable to believe that he would have pursued the further selling-off of nationalised industries.” Most of Roberts’s alterers seem to remain awkwardly conscious of trespassing on precincts better suited to historical novelists.\n\nIn fact, even most writers of historical fiction still reject the larger manipulations of “alt-history” as a genre fiction’s genre fiction. The fact-by-fact decision-making involved in composing mainstream historical fiction—what to change, when to leave well enough alone—is uncodified and imprecise, conducted on a sliding scale that’s always a slippery slope. Even so, standard historical fiction, whether “Gone with the Wind” or “Austerlitz,” tends to consist of plausible stories that have been grafted onto enduring historical facts. The writer presents not so much “what might have happened instead” as “what could have happened as well.” In my own novel “Dewey Defeats Truman,” the famous headline remains wrong, but a brash young Republican triumphs in the imaginary small-town love triangle that mirrors the national election. In alt-history fiction, Truman would be sent packing to Independence, Missouri.\n\nThis past summer, I felt the need to check about thirteen hundred facts pertaining to the Watergate scandal before I relinquished proofs of a novel I’d written about it. This book, too, adheres mostly to the “as well” and not “instead of” model. But the temptations of alt-history are always present as one writes, and sometimes they go unresisted. In my book, an invented character named Tom Garahan—a genial New York widower, retired from trust-and-estates law—has a brief, tender affair with Pat Nixon during the mid-nineteen-sixties, her husband’s “wilderness years.” Garahan has no important influence on the book’s main plot, so why do I have him as an important element of the backstory? Maybe he’s there out of the redemptive impulse that drives a great deal of alt-history. I simply couldn’t resist giving Mrs. Nixon a larger share of happiness than life did.\n\nOf course, the alt-history writer has the power not only to retouch individual destinies but to save entire civilizations. “The City on the Edge of Forever,” now routinely ranked with the greatest of all “Star Trek” episodes, first aired in April, 1967. In it, Kirk and Spock travelled back in time to 1930 and saved the world from a permanent Nazi tyranny. The desired result required them to allow a young pacifist (played by Joan Collins)—a woman whose coral lipstick is as advanced as her ideas—to get hit by a truck.\n\nThe redemptive impulse also governs the recent novel “Untold Story,” by Monica Ali, a literary writer who normally wouldn’t be expected to produce a book that undoes Princess Diana’s fatal car crash. In Ali’s novel, Di, after faking her own death by drowning off the coast of Brazil, starts life over, as Lydia Snaresbrook. She manages, thanks to “the nose job in Rio,” to live undetected for a time, working in the local dog shelter and acquiring a set of Real Housewives chums—all the while keeping up with the lives of her abandoned boys via celebrity magazines.\n\nWhen it comes to alt-historical irony, Ali doesn’t give readers a poke in the ribs; she sticks in a whole series of dull shivs: the American hamlet where Di/Lydia takes up residence is called Kensington. “Untold Story” establishes its main character with a handful of her familiar proclivities (bulimia) and phrases (“Thick as a plank, that’s me”).The book’s real problem as alt-history lies in its sparse knowledge of history itself. There’s nothing here about Diana that one doesn’t already know from reading the same magazines she does. The author’s laziness becomes a kind of aesthetic. Familiar information is rubbed balder with cliché (“She did love watching the soap operas, but there never was a drama to match the drama of her life”), and much depends on the silliest of coincidences (her old paparazzo nemesis just happens to stumble into Kensington). Does some Gresham’s law of imagination and style impose itself on writers who enter the land of alt-history from less pulpy domains? If Squire’s anthology was “high table humour,” Ali’s book is a bag of chips by the chaise longue. It may be the world’s first hybrid of alt-history and chick lit, but it’s an untold story in the most basic sense—a book that misses every opportunity its premise might have afforded.\n\nSuccess in alt-history may require long-term immersion in the genre. One of its stalwarts is Harry Turtledove, the winner of two Sidewise Awards for Alternate History, which are presented each year at the World Science Fiction Convention. A sixty-two-year-old California native with a Ph.D. in Byzantine history, the prolific Turtledove has upended Nazis and the Founding Fathers and the Spanish Armada; he has even written an “Atlantis trilogy,” about an eighth continent. A Harry Turtledove Internet wiki contains more than six thousand pages about the plots and characters of his oeuvre.\n\nHis “The Guns of the South” (1992), in which the Confederacy wins the War Between the States, is both absurd and meticulous, a Civil War reënactment conducted with AK-47s instead of Springfield rifles. The modern weapon, brought to Robert E. Lee by a man named Andries Rhoodie, turns things around for the rebels in 1864. Lee takes Rhoodie and his associates for Dutchmen, unaware that they’ve come to Rivington, North Carolina, from much farther away than the Netherlands, and brought much more than the guns: “desiccated suppers” and instant coffee are soon sustaining Lee’s troops, while nitroglycerin tablets ease the General’s heart condition. Neither Lee nor Jefferson Davis can understand why the new rifles carry gunsmith marks from the “People’s Republic of China,” but as long as they keep mowing down Yankees a full explanation can wait.\n\nThe novel’s real drama lies not in the South’s victory over the North—that comes soon enough—but in how the rifles end up being a herd of Trojan horses. Rhoodie and his men are, we learn, actually South African white supremacists from the year 2014. They will clash with Lee when they discover that he is not only courteous to Negroes but also content to accept their eventual emancipation within an independent Confederacy.\n\nUnlike Ferguson’s bashful historical speculators, Turtledove develops his fantastical premise without a blush. His characters display a similar nonchalance. Both Lee and Davis react to the revelation of Rhoodie’s origins as if they’d been told about the unexpected arrival of some cousins from Schenectady. And yet “The Guns of the South” succeeds, through its own consistent belief in itself. With Diana, Ali is engaged in some larkish slumming; Turtledove creates a whole intricate biosphere with a somehow breathable atmosphere. His book is full of internally plausible touches and scenes of understated irony: a slave auctioneer in 1865 worries that bidders will see bullet scars that can identify the men being sold as having served the defeated Union Army against the now triumphant South; Abraham Lincoln spends April 14, 1865, visiting Kentucky to make a speech urging the voters of that state, still in legal limbo, to throw in with the Union instead of the Confederacy. Lincoln is now an ex-President, having lost the election of 1864 to the copperhead governor of New York, Horatio Seymour—a contest that Turtledove stages with exceptionally credible detail. (The novel even carries an appendix of state-by-state vote totals.)\n\nThere is no Dixie-whistling nostalgia in “The Guns of the South.” When the book was written, in the early nineteen-nineties, South Africa’s apartheid regime was crumbling; its demise allowed Turtledove to imagine Andries Rhoodie as a violent holdout. By contrast, the courtly and sonorous Robert E. Lee becomes a sort of Mandela, vanquishing Rhoodie once and for all. There’s a vague implication that the American racial divide might have healed more quickly under the gradualist Confederate Presidency of Robert E. Lee than through the reconstruction of a defeated South. In that respect, the novel is fuelled by the same redemptive impulse that runs through so much alt-history fiction, while also encouraging readers to see aspects of their own time in the depicted past. However bizarrely, “The Guns of the South” performs a measure of the allegorical work that has always been part of historical fiction’s business.\n\nOver the past few decades, the assassination of John F. Kennedy has become one of alt-history’s most fertile furrows. An anthology, “Alternate Kennedys,” appeared twenty years ago, and included a story called “The Winterberry” (1992), by Nicholas A. DiChario. It featured a brain-damaged, childlike John F. Kennedy, who, having survived an assassination attempt, has been locked away for decades in what seems to be Hyannis Port. This past spring, the journalist Jeff Greenfield devoted two of the three novellas in his alt-history collection, “Then Everything Changed,” to the J.F.K. and R.F.K. killings. The first is moved to December of 1960, and the second is averted altogether, so that President Robert Kennedy ends up sending the Cold Warrior Richard Nixon, the twice-defeated Presidential candidate, to China. The Bobby novella is a sort of utopian redemption fantasy, but it should be noted that, over all, Greenfield’s book hesitates nervously between the intellectual outlooks of Ferguson and Turtledove: its bound galleys were first labelled “fiction” before the categorization was overridden with a sticker saying “nonfiction.” The finished book’s flap copy refers to “dramatic narratives.”\n\nThe best-known work of literary fiction to take up the Kennedy assassination is Don DeLillo’s “Libra,” which alters events to the extent that Lee Harvey Oswald misses his last shot and the President is killed by a sniper Oswald hadn’t known would be firing as well. In an afterword, DeLillo offered the novel—which has always seemed more accomplished than satisfying—as a kind of historical therapy: “Because this book makes no claim to literal truth, because it is only itself, apart and complete, readers may find refuge here—a way of thinking about the assassination without being constrained by half-facts or overwhelmed by possibilities, by the tide of speculation that widens with the years.” But “Libra” cannot really be considered alt-history fiction, because it remains more interested in understanding what did happen than in making something else happen.\n\nStephen King first considered writing a Kennedy novel forty years ago, but he was put off by the daunting research it would require, and by the historical proximity of the event. Now, more than fifty books later, comes his “11/22/63” (Scribner; $35), an enormous experiment in time-travel alt-history. The author has too many flasks on too many burners, and some of them are leaking logic, but this is a deeply felt and often well-realized work, which extends King’s dominion over fantasy to the terrain of the historical record.\n\nEarly in “11/22/63,” Al Templeton, a dying Maine diner owner, shows Jake Epping, a much younger high-school teacher, the portal by which he can reënter the past. Al has been doing it for years, with a mostly unadventurous approach: he goes back in time to shop for his diner, buying things at decades-old prices and reselling them in the present. He’s now too ill to complete the one grand mission he flirted with—thwarting J.F.K.’s murder—so he wills the task to Jake.\n\nKing doesn’t rush his time-travelling characters: almost three hundred pages pass before Jake gets to Texas. Once there, he begins to monitor the future assassin, wiretapping the shabby Fort Worth and Dallas rentals that Oswald occupies with his Russian wife, Marina, from the summer of 1962 through the following spring. Jake intends to find out whether he must stay the hand of a single killer or contend with a conspiracy.\n\nKing himself chooses to view Oswald as a lone gunman, the right decision for both truth and art: the assassination’s vast literature of conspiracy is itself a species of alternative history, and King is smart not to paint the lilies on the grassy knoll. His book remains a one-on-one chase, a kind of anxiety dream in which Jake must overcome obstacle after obstacle—violent romantic complications, a hospital stay, loss of memory—before arriving at the Texas School Book Depository with minutes to spare.\n\nWith a book that runs eight hundred and forty-nine pages, the author is bound to get some things wrong. A few are just the small anachronistic stumbles of ordinary historical fiction (“assisted living” in 1963?). Others involve assassination minutiae: in 1960 there were no “schoolbooks” inside the warehouse at 411 Elm Street, only the canned goods of a grocery company that occupied what was still known as the Sexton Building. But King’s big picture of “The Land of Ago,” a place that he says smells worse and tastes better than the land of today, comes into clear, well-textured focus.\n\nReaders who turn to this author for axe murder or telekinesis will find him reflective, even epistemological, this time out. Jake wavers between agnosticism and a belief in a detached watchmaker God, and is convinced by his experiences as a “temporal bedouin” that the past doesn’t want to be tampered with. In fact, “resistance to change is proportional to how much the future might be altered by any given act.” The past dovetails with the present, prefiguring it through small “convergences” that drift through the novel, off-rhymed and tantalizing. Jake senses a “harmonic chime.”\n\nThe lives of the non-famous consistently divert King’s chugging imagination from the great event that is supposed to dominate the novel. Those first few hundred pages focus on Jake’s dry run at altering history, his attempt to undo an obscure domestic-violence spree in nineteen-fifties Maine. This opening stretch amounts to a novel in itself, as does Jake’s troubled courtship of the Texas school librarian Sadie Clayton. At one point, he will confess to caring less about the impending assassination than about Denholm Consolidated High’s spring 1961 production of “Of Mice and Men.” Readers may feel the same way—enough to make them wonder if economic and social historians haven’t always been right about our tendency to overestimate the importance of the regimes and Presidencies that come and go.\n\nBut time travel itself, the concept and its mechanics, also crowds the alt-history heart of King’s enterprise. The author noodles with a slew of unanswerables: Does each trip into the past “reset” all the others to their starting points? Or do parallel pasts exist, as they seem to in string theory, which would have an abundance of different 1963s standing next to one another, like DVDs on a shelf? And how operative is the “butter-fly effect,” named decades ago to describe the endless ramifications of a single insect’s flapping wings? This is a lot to worry about, and unless a writer can approach time travel in the manner of Harry Turtledove—with characters who blandly accept every anomaly—the time traveller himself will end up owning more of the book than the historical figures he has come to rearrange.\n\nKnown for generous nods to other writers (he makes a kind acknowledgment of my own short book on the Kennedy assassination), King, in the course of “11/22/63,” alerts readers to an additional case in point. He mentions Wilson Tucker’s “The Lincoln Hunters” (1958), a well-wrought fantasy in which a team of time travellers try to recover Lincoln’s famous “Lost Speech,” a cry for abolition delivered in 1856. Deft though “The Lincoln Hunters” may be, it conforms to the time-travelling pattern described above: it is almost all hunters and no Lincoln.\n\nWhen H. G. Wells wrote “The Time Machine” (1895), he steered it only toward the future. Other late-nineteenth-century writers who felt an urge to roam through time, in one direction or the other, generally kept the means of conveyance as simple as possible: Edward Bellamy pushed Julian West forward—so that he could have his look backward—via hypnosis, and Hank Morgan, Mark Twain’s Connecticut Yankee, got to King Arthur’s court via a blow to the skull. And yet, when imagining the past from the present, or even the present from the future, one should probably not fight the physical fact that you can’t get there from here. Just as it’s wise for aspiring historical novelists to read more from and less about whatever period they wish to re-create—immersion being more likely than a middleman’s perspective to foster authenticity—so might alt-hist novelists be advised to have their adjusted outcomes result from some decisive event within the past itself, rather than from the arrival of a deus ex machina from another time.\n\nRobert Harris’s “Fatherland” (1992) owed much of its alt-history success to the fact that it operates entirely inside the alternative past that it constructs. The author sets his book in the spring of 1964, two decades after a Nazi victory in the Second World War, during preparations for Hitler’s seventy-fifth birthday. Détente with the United States, now headed by that old appeaser Joseph P. Kennedy, is in its early stages, but it may come undone if documentary truth about the Holocaust surfaces, a possibility that starts to look imminent when a string of old Nazi functionaries are found murdered.\n\nHarris casts “Fatherland” as a police novel. Its investigator hero is a detective named Xavier March, a forty-two-year-old ex-U-boat sailor, seedily sexy and about as morally decent as one can be in the world he’s forced to inhabit. Harris is not much of a stylist (“He lit yet another cigarette, his millionth of the week”), he underlines clumsily (“This is madness, he thought”), and he stuffs the book with too many camera-ready touches (a Leonardo da Vinci inside a Swiss bank vault). But by adopting the conventions of one type of genre fiction he allows himself to succeed in another.\n\nBecause of Nazi censorship, Xavier March knows less about recent history and his own country than does Charlotte (Charlie) Maguire, the beautiful young American who helps him crack the case. Harris takes care to impart details of the altered past from March’s blinkered point of view, and always casually. Offhand, widely spaced reference is made to “the SS academy in Oxford,” the “ruined Tuileries,” U.S. Ambassador Lindbergh, Cecil Beaton’s official portrait of Hitler. The novel may give us a Third Reich fat with the fruits of empire, and a steroidal Berlin that has risen from Albert Speer’s drawing board, but the victorious regime feels almost as shaky as Orwell’s Oceania: it’s beset by terrorism, a small “student resistance movement,” and an endless war in the East with Russian guerrillas, who up to now have kept going with American aid.\n\nCharlie insists that “facts change everything,” that the emerging truth will halt both détente and Kennedy’s re-election; March, like King’s Jake Epping, wonders whether “history changed so easily.” In the end, the martyrdom that the novel has in store for him brings a sense that the grim world will now turn in a better direction. Harris creates this dystopia in order to redeem it, whereas Philip Roth’s “The Plot Against America” (2004), another vision of Nazi success, will derive from the rarer flip side of the redemptive impulse, a desire to make the past worse than it was, perhaps only to feel moderately better about the present.\n\nLiterary alt-history is still relatively scarce, but it has begun a noticeable expansion. Roth won a Sidewise Award for “The Plot Against America,” and Michael Chabon received one for “The Yiddish Policemen’s Union” (2007). A number of today’s younger literary writers have begun rigging up a gaudy, fun-house kind of historical fiction, less “alternative” than simply unconstrained, such as Elizabeth Gaffney’s exuberant “Metropolis” (2005) and Samantha Hunt’s “The Invention of Everything Else” (2008). Like the antic historical novels of an earlier generation—Pynchon’s “Gravity’s Rainbow,” Doctorow’s “Ragtime”—or the sort of steam-punk fiction that William Gibson and Bruce Sterling have produced, these books sometimes seem to regard anachronism and surrealist elements not as pitfalls but as stimulating mashups.\n\nFiction’s current willingness to take wild liberties with the past may well come from a sense of its own cultural demotion, its fall from a position where it was once thought to shape the future. Lincoln supposedly pronounced Harriet Beecher Stowe “the little woman who made this great war,” and some of his contemporaries laid the conflict at the feet of Sir Walter Scott. A week before Lincoln’s assassination, the Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, wrote in his diary, “This Rebellion which has convulsed the nation for four years, threatened the Union, and caused such sacrifice of blood and treasure may be traced in a great degree to the diseased imagination of certain South Carolina gentlemen, who some thirty and forty years since studied Scott’s novels, and fancied themselves cavaliers, imbued with chivalry, a superior class, not born to labor but to command.” Sure enough, in Chapter 12 of “The Guns of the South,” Robert E. Lee enters a bookshop in Augusta, Georgia, looking for something to read on the train back to Richmond. Unable to obtain a copy of “Ivanhoe,” he settles for Scott’s “Quentin Durward.” The scene might prompt a reader from Lee’s own time, though probably not our own, to wonder whether everything might have been different had some other subject caught Scott’s long-term fancy inside his study at Abbotsford; whether an altering of history might have been accomplished not with AK-47s and a time machine but with the erasure of just a shelf’s worth of historical fiction.\n\nAlt-history’s sense of its own potency may have reached a high-water mark in Philip K. Dick’s 1962 alt-history novel, “The Man in the High Castle.” Dick imagines a United States segmented into Japanese and German occupation zones, but in this squared circle of a book the real truth about its new world order may be obtainable only in an alt-history novel (“The Grasshopper Lies Heavy”) written by Dick’s own title character, Hawthorne Abendsen—with the assistance of the I Ching.\n\nTime destabilizes all genre classifications. Just as alt-history, when carried out through time travel, becomes a species of science fiction, sci-fi tends to turn into a genre of false prophecy. “1984” is no longer a cautionary tale but a fate averted, and even the future imagined in Bellamy’s “Looking Backward,” whose subtitle is “2000-1887,” must now be viewed retrospectively. These days, we scarcely think of “Barnaby Rudge” and “Vanity Fair” as historical novels, since Dickens and Thackeray are themselves so far in the historical past. They probably didn’t contemplate this eventuality, any more than Harry Turtledove, writing at the start of the nineteen-nineties, could have known that Robert E. Lee’s perplexed reference to Yugoslavia—“a country which appears in no atlas”—would soon again be correct.\n\nIn truth, all novels, including those set in the present, are alt-history fiction. If a writer puts an invented family named Berglund into the city of St. Paul in his own day and time, he has already, however marginally, changed history. Like mainstream historical novelists, writers of fiction set in the present may believe they’re only supplementing history, but their insertions, by their nature, are really supplantings. What’s more, these inserted characters and situations have never come from whole cloth but from reality—which is to say, history—cut on the bias, mixed and matched and composited. Novelists trafficking in the present would do well to abandon their lingering prejudices against historical fiction as something ready-made and second-rate—just as writers of standard historical fiction, scornful of the alternative kind, might liberate themselves by conceding that the glad rags of alt-history derive, like all other fiction, from the fabric of actuality. Our subgeneric distinctions have provided not only critical convenience but also a kind of self-satisfied security to classes of authors and readers alike. And we may require an alternative literary history before either group is fully willing to admit it. ♦"
