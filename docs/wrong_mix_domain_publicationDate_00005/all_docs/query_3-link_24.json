        "text": "Harry Turtledove is a prolific novelist and historian of America, having written some of the most successful historical novels. He is well known for writing many successful novels based on the historical fiction, science fiction, fantasy, and alternate history genres. Harry was born on June 14, 1949 in Los Angeles, California, United States. The most notable works of Harry include the Southern Victory series, Worldwar series, The Two Georges, as well as a few standalone novels. As a child, he grew up in a city near Gardena, California. Harry’s paternal grandparents were of Jewish Romanian origin and were first based in Winnipeg, Canada, before going on to settle in California. He received his primary education from local public schools. After completing his schooling he joined the college at Caltech, but got dropped out in the freshman year. Following that, he attended the UCLA and completed his undergraduate degree. Harry also received his Ph.D on the subject of Byzantine history in the year 1977. It was during the year 1979 when Harry Turtledove began his writing career by publishing his first two novels. He used the pseudonym Eric G. Iverson to write those novels because the editor of the publishing house believed that the readers will not believe his real name was Turtledove. From then onwards, he wrote all his novels under the same pseudonym until 1985. Harry began using another pen name Mark Gordian for writing his further novels. While Harry kept using a number of pseudonyms for writing novels during the initial stage of his writing career, he also wrote several books under his original name. Recently, he has started using one more pseudonym H.N. Turteltaub for writing the historical novels. Turteltaub means turtle dove in the Yiddish language. As Dan Chernenko, Harry has published three novels. This way, Harry had to use a few pseudonyms for writing his famous novels, sometimes purposely and some other times as per the requirements of the publishers.\n\nOver the course of his writing career, Harry collaborated with several fellow authors for writing some specific novels on a few occasions. During one such instance, he joined his first wife Betty for writing the novel Death in Vesunna, who used the pen name Elaine O’Byrne.

North America faces danger from Japan, Russia and England from three sides. But, in the middle of war, America seems to be a bomb about to explode. Jake Featherston is the leader of the Confederate States and appears to be the man who can cause the explosion. The Socialist leader Al Smith is regarded as the living symbol of the hopes of the people of America and sits in the White House situated in Philadelphia. While in the southern part, the Freedom Party led by Featherston, becomes successful in putting down the rebellion of the Negros with his bloodthirsty fist and captured them in concentration camps. Now, he seems determined to destroy the northern neighbor at all costs. Without any prior warning, Featherston’s planes begin to launch attacks on Philadelphia. The United States also hit back, but a second attack led by CSA blitzkrieg leaves it flat-footed. Soon, the gray Army takes over Lake Erie. However, the war seems to spin a vortex of mass destruction, fury, and betrayal, which is not in control of even Jake Featherston. Now, as the President Al Smith faces a difficult task ahead, his assistant secretary named Roosevelt rises in rank. The U.S.A faces some very dark days ahead as the war spreads around the globe.
