His most popular work combines elements of science fiction, fantasy, and alternative history. Starting from the premise of one major change in historyâ€”for example, the Spanish Armada defeating the British and imprisoning Queen Elizabeth I, or the South winning the American Civil War instead of the Northâ€”he goes on to create sweeping portraits of what would have unfolded in the decades following the change. Turtledove, who has also published his work under the pseudonyms Eric G. Iverson, Mark Gordion, and H.N. Turteltaub, has constructed alternate histories of both world wars. Other writers have used this premise, but Turtledove adds extra originality to his stories by blending in elements of magic and fantasy.\n\nThe first series of books Turtledove wrote were called \"Gerin the Fox\" and were initially published under the pseudonym Eric G. Iverson due to his editor's belief that the name sounded more authentic than \"Turtledove.\" Not until 1985 did Turtledove begin publishing under his own name, due to his agent's belief that it would be remembered easily by readers. The first two volumes of the Gerin series, which are sometimes known as the Elabon series, were Wereblood and Werenight. Gerin is an educated man and reluctant warrior in the declining kingdom of Elabon. He lives in the North lands and defends the outskirts of the kingdom from invading marauders. In Wereblood he is at war with a crazy sorcerer, and in Werenight Gerin tries to rescue his kidnapped son, fight the invasion of the Trokme warriors, and battle with monsters in the North lands. Turtledove continued the series with Prince of the North more than a decade later, in which Gerin's wife leaves him for another man, leaving him to raise their four-year-old son while dealing with the effects of war and a devastating earthquake on the sprawling Elabon empire. King of the North takes place a decade later, when Gerin's son is a teenager and Gerin now has three more children with his second wife, Selatre. Family matters stemming from the death of his ex-father-in-law complicate his preparations for war against the Adiatunnus, which are in turn pre-empted by the invasion of the Gradi, a barbarian tribe of Nordic characteristics, into the North lands. Fox and Empire, the last novel of the series, takes place more than twenty years after the first book, as Gerin enters into war against the Elabonian Empire, with his former adversary, King Aragis the Archer, as an ally.\n\nAmong Turtledove's science-fiction works in alternate history is the \"Worldwar\" series, in which opposing forces from World War II unite to combat technologically advanced, lizard-like alien invaders. Library Jour- nal reviewer Jackie Cassada, assessing Tilting the Balance, remarked that the novel \"exhibits [Turtledove's] genuine feel for crafting believable answers to historical â€˜what ifs.â€™\"\n\nIn a volume from the Colonization series, Second Contact, the conflict between Earthlings and alien invaders is renewed. Cassada, writing again in the Library Journal, described this novel as a \"tour de force of speculative historical fiction,\" and Booklist critic Roberta Johnston noted the volume's \"strong human characters.\" In a sequel, Down to Earth, the invading aliens unite with Allied forces to vanquish the Third Reich. A Publishers Weekly critic deemed the novel \"provocative,\" and Johnston wrote in Booklist that Turtledove's tale constitutes \"another ripping yarn.\" Cassada, meanwhile, wrote in the Library Journal of the novelist's \"talent for crafting drama on a global scale.\"\n\nThe cycle continues with Aftershocks, in which lizards and humans together face the results of a series of nuclear confrontations. The series comes to \"a resounding and massive conclusion\" with Homeward Bound, according to Roland Green in a Booklist review. In Homeward Bound, the large cast features a human baby raised as a lizard and a ship whose faster-than-light speeds finally put power into human hands. Green found this to be unequal to Turtledove's very best work, but added, \"it certainly ranks as something few other writers would have attempted and even fewer would have brought off so well.\" Booklist reviewer Roberta Johnson had high praise for the series, claiming that the author \"explores ethics, vengeance, and the duties of familial love versus those of friendship with his trademark wry humor.\"\n\nTurtledove turned to World War I for The American Front and Walk in Hell, two tales in which the historic conflict is fought in North America instead of Europe. In this scenario, America is a vastly different place from the one reflected in current reality, with the United States bitterly set against the Confederate States, which are allied with Britain. The story suggests that the United States seeks revenge against the Confederates no matter what the cost. According to Jackie Cassada in Booklist, the author \"displays his acute knowledge of American history as well as his keen imagination.\" A Publishers Weekly critic similarly noted Turtledove's \"thorough knowledge of the period's history.\" Booklist reviewer Green described Walk in Hell as \"a remorseless working out of the consequences of greater follies producing even worse results.\"\n\nTurtledove's other alternate histories include The Guns of the South: A Novel of the Civil War, in which the Confederates have triumphed over Union forces in the American Civil War. The author explores what the implications might have been for modern history if the South had been victorious, drawing clear parallels between his imaginary Southern nation and the Third Reich of Nazi Germany. Drive to the East is another book in the series, relating how Confederate forces have split the country in half as they seek revenge against the North. Genocide on a scale of the Holocaust is planned in order to reduce the unwanted population of freed slaves. A Publishers Weekly reviewer credited Turtledove with creating \"convincing analogues to events during WWII,\" and predicted that fans of the author's previous work will find the book \"thoroughly satisfying.\"\n\nDays of Infamy and End of the Beginning are part of a series of books exploring what might have been if the Japanese had successfully eliminated the entire American fleet at Pearl Harbor. In the author's vision, food and resources are scarce, American men and women are forced into slavery, and the black market thrives. As in many of Turtledove's books, the cast of characters is large; the author is often praised for his ability to work with so many plot threads and characters. A Publishers Weekly writer found Turtledove's vision \"starkly realistic.\" Noting that the author focuses on war tactics and technology, the reviewer further commented that Days of Infamy is an \"exciting, well-researched alternate history will please history buffs and SF fans alike.\" Roland Green, reviewing the novel in Booklist, characterized Days of Infamy as \"demanding, irresistible, and magisterialâ€”to say the very least.\" Another reviewer for Publishers Weekly characterized End of the Beginning as \"a broad canvas of the titanic struggle.\"\n\nTurtledove aimed for a young adult readership with his \"Crosstime Traffic\" series, which features twenty-first-century teenagers trapped in an alternate world where the Roman Empire never declined. People have the technology to move from one timeline to another, though this practice is shrouded in secrecy. In Gunpowder Empire, the first book in the series, Jeremy and his sister Amanda are stranded without their parents in an alternate universe, and communication between the two timelines breaks down completely. \"Turtledove is the master of alternate histories and he doesn't disappoint here,\" concluded Sherry Hoy in a Kliatt review. The fourth volume in the series, The Disunited States ofAmerica, features Justin Monroe, a high-school senior who moves to Charleston, Virginia, from another planet and discovers America to be a land of warring states. Justin witnesses a border war between Virginia and Ohio, with incited uprisings fought with latter-day technologyâ€”missiles, bioweapons, and more. He falls in love with Beckie, a gunrunner from California who is aiding the African-American rebels in Virginia. A Publishers Weekly reviewer appreciated the moral theme of the novel, in which \"Turtledove delivers lessons on racism and diplomacy for a young adult audience.\"\n\nTurtledove is a student of Byzantine history, a subject in which he earned a doctorate in 1977. His works related to that period include The Chronicle of Theophanes: An English Translation of Anni Mundi, 6095-9305 (A.D. 602-813), which he translated in 1982. His background in Byzantine history also served him in his \"Videssos Cycle\" of fantasy novels about a Roman legion that is transported to an alternative empire called Videssos. \"The major appeal of the series remains Turtledove's competent handling of historical material,\" observed Roland Green in Booklist.\n\nTurtledove's knowledge of Byzantine history is also evident in Agent of Byzantium, a collection of stories about Basil Argyros, a fourteenth-century spy who lives in an alternate Byzantine Empire that never fell to crusaders. In this alternative world, the Muslim figure Mohammed has converted to Christianity and has become a saint. A Kirkus Reviews critic found Argyros's exploits \"hard to believe in\" but conceded that \"the backdrop is intriguing.\"\n\nIn addition to his science fiction and alternate histories, Turtledove has published conventional fantasy stories such as Into the Darkness, where rival sorcerers vie for power. Booklist reviewer Roland Green summarized this book as \"another whopper from Turtledove.\" A Publishers Weekly critic was less impressed, concluding that \"this novel sometimes seems a victim of overly complicated designs.\" Another book in the series, Out of the Darkness, sees the drawn-out Derlavaian War coming to a close, though a series of epic battles featuring dragons and sea monsters is still in progress. Cassada, reviewing the book for the Library Journal, pointed out that despite the magical trappings and impressive technology described here, the story really illustrates \"the universality of war and its consequences.\" A similar viewpoint was expressed by a Publishers Weekly reviewer, who stated: \"By personalizing the frightful tragedies of war, Turtledove makes the big bang of the war's ultimate weapon far less affecting than the whimpers of its many victims.\"\n\nTurtledove is also the coauthor with Judith Tarr of Household Gods, in which a Los Angeles lawyer suddenly finds herself in Rome during the second century. Cassada wrote in the Library Journal that the novel is reminiscent of Mark Twain's classic A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, and a Publishers Weekly reviewer mentioned L. Frank Baum's masterpiece, The Wizard of Oz. In addition, the Publishers Weekly critic acknowledged Household Gods for its \"snappy dialogue\" and \"superb characterizations.\"\n\nIn Ruled Britannia, Turtledove explores the possibility of the Spanish Armada defeating the British navy in Elizabethan England, thereby installing a rigid Roman Catholic regime in the kingdom. Mary Queen of Scots now rules England, and Queen Elizabeth is holed up in the Tower of London. A rebellion is launched following the debut of William Shakespeare's new play, and Will himself, \"lovingly drawn,\" in the words of a Publishers Weekly reviewer, is cast into the fray by Elizabeth's ally Lord Burghley. The story gives Turtledove the opportunity to put his own words in the Bard's mouth and reimagine some of his most famous lines. The prospect, as Turtledove told Cristoper Hennessey-DeRose and Michael McCar in an interview for the online journal Science Fiction Weekly, was daunting: \"This was probably the scariest thing I have ever tried,\" Turtledove said, \"because one of the worst things for a writer to do is write about a writer who is better than he is. Shakespeare is better than everybody.\"\n\nEvery Inch a King takes as its inspiration Albania in 1913 and the real-life story of the circus clown Otto Witte. In Turtledove's alternate history, Witte becomes Otto of Schlepsig and Albania is reimagined as the kingdom of Shqiperi. Twentieth-century technology is replaced by magic as Otto and his sidekick Max of Witte, a sword swallower, cavort throughout Shqiperi, enjoying riches and women, in a novel that \"is a fun romp through an undeservedly obscure moment in history,\" according to a reviewer in Publishers Weekly.\n\nBeyond the Gap is the first volume in a new series. It concerns a Bronze Age society on the cusp of discovery. A team of explorers that includes Raumsdalians and Bizogot, a nomadic tribe from the northern part of the kingdom, depart from the capital of the Raumsdalian Empire and venture through a growing glacial gap to search for the mythical Golden Shrine. Romantic entanglements and culture clashes are put aside when the team encounters the mammoth-riding Rulers, a fierce tribe on the other side of the glacier. A writer for Publishers Weekly praised the story's \"vivid setting and strong characterization.\"\n\nOpening Atlantis is the first volume in a planned trilogy concerning the ancient, mythical lost continent. The story begins in the fifteenth century, when the unknown land mass is discovered by English sailors. The land, which is somewhere between Europe and where the East Coast of the United States should be (but is not), Atlantis becomes a key region in England's imperial conquests, serving as an alternate location for what would have been the French and Indian War, as British, French, and Spanish forces clash in what seems to be an inevitable confrontation, whatever the geography of the planet. Booklist reviewer Roland Green concluded that the author's fans should enjoy the story, which features \"Turtledove's inimitable ingenuity.\"\n\nWriting in Locus, Russell Letson declared Turtledove to be \"probably the best practitioner of the classic alternate-history since L. Sprague de Camp, and his virtues are just those of the master: meticulous research and thorough knowledge of his period, an understated but firm way with storytelling, and a sense of the exotic appeal of the past combined with a recognition of the ordinariness of ordinary life.\" Similarly impressed was Jackie Cassada, who referred to Turtledove in the Library Journal as \"the acknowledged master of alternate history.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nBooklist, February 15, 1987, review of The Misplaced Legion, p. 878;
