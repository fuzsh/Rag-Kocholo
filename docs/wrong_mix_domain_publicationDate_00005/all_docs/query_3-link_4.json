        "text": "It's a well-researched book, it has some good ideas, and it's ultimately a waste of time. Return to Harry Turtledove Bibliography\n\nTHE GUNS OF THE SOUTH\n\nReview copyright (c) 1995 by Doug Ingram\n\nHarry Turtledove is probably most well-known to readers of this newsgroup for his alternate history novels. Most of the people I've heard from who recommended this author to me suggested I try this book first, and if it is any indication of Turtledove's writing, I'll be on the lookout for more.\n\nMuch of the premise of The Guns of the South can be derived from the cover, which shows Robert E. Lee (commanding general of the Confederacy in 1864) holding an AK-47. A group of white supremacists from an organization they call \"America Will Break\" (AWB) have come back to 1864 from the future in order to provide the Confederacy with enough firepower to reverse the tide of the Civil War.\n\nThis story is told largely from two viewpoints. First, as the Confederacy starts to reap the benefits provided by AWB, the implications of AWB's actions start to sink in for General Lee, who tries to find out more about them. Meanwhile, another perspective is provided by a sargeant in the Confederate army named Nate Caudell, who fights his way through several battles with his new weaponry and then ultimately must find a place for himself in the post-war Confederacy. The reader is rewarded with two very different and very insightful views of the way the alternate history is played out, both before and after the Civil War.\n\nSummarizing the plot any further isn't really necessary, other than to say that the Civil War's resolution itself takes up only half the book, and what happens to the Confederacy afterwards is just as interesting as the events of the Civil War. This very fact leads me to one of the things I like about this new \"genre\" of speculative fiction (and allows me to avoid providing more spoilers).\n\nTypical SF is set in the future, and the author often times attempts to predict and analyze the effects of some current or new aspect of our society (either an invention, a social change, or a major event such as alien contact) by extrapolating from current society into an unknown future. This leaves the author with a little extra baggage, as it can take a long time to set up the framework for the story. Often, authors either get so involved with descriptions of the details of this new society that the book either drags or suffers from \"name-itis\" in which the reader is asked to commit to memory the names of dozens of people and/or places in the first few chapters.\n\n\"Historical SF\", on the other hand, presents the reader with a familiar background. Turtledove can dive right into his story without too much in the way of introduction. We already know who Robert E. Lee is, and we know what the historical setting of the time was. Everything is familiar, yet with the twist from the future, we find that life is just different enough to be extremely interesting and unpredictable.\n\nYou will probably find that the deeper your knowledge about the Civil War, the more you will appreciate this book. Implicit in this novel is Turtledove's interpretation of Lee's personality as well as the social conditions of that era. It is interesting to see the way politics worked back then (almost depressingly familiar, I might add) and also somewhat educational.\n\nI will admit that the book dragged a few times, as the attention to the details of everyday life for both main characters (Lee and Caudell) started to bog me down, in spite of the fact that I realize this was just a way to \"back door\" more information about society back then. In a few cases, I would have preferred a little less education and a little more action. But this is only a minor point. The bottom line is: I strongly recommend this book.\n\nReturn to Harry Turtledove Bibliography\n\nTHE MISPLACED LEGION\n\nReviewed by Garner Johnson\n\nThe story follows a portion of a Roman legion that is transported from Gaul (during Caesar's conquests) to a fantasy world called Videssos. The main character is the commander of the legion who is untried and has political ambitions. In this new world the legion becomes a mercenary band working for a large empire. They are beset with bureaucratic problems, a holy war between good and evil, sorcery, religious prejudice, politics and intrigue that all combine to make a richly detailed and complicated story. Videssos has a Byzantine/middle east feel to it that reflects Turtledove's historical specialty and is a nice change from the typical western European fantasy. It also has a great deal of military action and accuracy also due to the author's expertise. His attention to religion and how that affects the various characters and nations is also good and integral to the plot. The characters are varied and well done, and their actions seem to follow naturally. If there is any problem with the book it is that its pacing is a bit slow due to all the detail that is given. There is still plenty of action and things going on, but they do unfold fairly slowly. This book leads off a four book series and is well worth reading.\n\nReturn to Harry Turtledove Bibliography\n\nDEPARTURES\n\nA book review by Evelyn C. Leeper Copyright 1993 Evelyn C. Leeper\n\nWhile Turtledove is perhaps best known for his alternate history stories, and while many of the stories in this collection are alternate histories, the back blurb lies when it says, \"Here Harry Turtledove explores such 'what-ifs' in twenty alternate history stories ranging from ancient times to the far, far-different future.\" Even counting stories with werewolves or vampires as alternate histories, only eleven of the twenty stories here are alternate history. But all twenty are good.\n\nPerhaps because of the historical nature of Turtledove's writing, the stories are arranged chronologically (by when the story takes place, not by when it was written). In fact, this collection was originally to be titled Pasts, Presents and Futures. And this historical bent is evident even in the non-alternate-history stories, as you will see.\n\n\"Counting Potsherds\" takes place in the early second century B.C.E. and IS an alternate history story. What if the Persians defeated the Greeks and democracy never developed? Turtledove has done his research on the Near East (his degree is in Byzantine history and he has also used the near East as the setting in his set of alternate history stories collected in AGENT OF BYZANTIUM, about which I will say more later), and the world here is as well-developed as a reader could hope to find.\n\n\"Death in Vesunna\" is about history, and books, and the mistake of under-estimating one's opponents. Although reminiscent of Poul Anderson's \"Time Patrol\" stories, it focuses more on the residents of the period to which the time travelers go than on the time travelers themselves or their time--and this is the whole point.\n\nTurtledove's best known alternate history stories are his \"Agent of Byzantium\" stories, and \"Departures\" is a prequel to that series. 'Nuff said.\n\n\"Pillar of Cloud, Pillar of Fire\" is a regular \"Agent of Byzantium\" story which takes place between \"Strange Eruptions\" (a.k.a. \"Etos Kosmou 6816\") and \"Unholy Trinity\" (a.k.a. \"Etos Kosmou 6824\"). Turtledove has at last gotten away from having Basil Argyros invent or discover something famous, although the story does center around a very modern problem.\n\n\"Islands in the Sea,\" by its placement here, reads as an alternate alternate history from \"Departures\" and the entire \"Agent of Byzantium\" series--not only does Mohammed NOT convert to Christianity, but the Muslim Arabs successfully invade southeastern Europe much sooner than they actually did. There is something odd, however, about reading a theological argument between a Christian and a Muslim written by a Jew. Well, at least no one can claim he is biased.\n\nIf the existence of werewolves makes a story an alternate history, then \"Not All Wolves\" is an alternate history. A young boy who is actually a werewolf is fleeing from an angry mob in Twelfth Century Cologne. Cornered and desperate, he finds help from a most unexpected ally. Though the message is perhaps a bit unsubtle, the story is effective.\n\n\"Clash of Arms\" is NOT an alternate history story, but a story of a heraldic duel. I suspect one needs to know heraldry better than I do to appreciate the story, though even I found it mildly interesting.\n\n\"Report of the Special Committee on the Quality of Life\" is not, strictly speaking, alternate history. Rather, it's a parody of government feasibility studies by having Jaime Nose'nada (\"I know nothing\" in Spanish) write up all the reasons why Spain shouldn't bother to follow up on Columbus's journey. Cute, but more than a little preachy--I'm sure all the pro-space groups love it.\n\nAn alternate history story only under the most liberal of definitions, \"Batboy\" is a baseball story, but probably wouldn't appeal to the average baseball fan--it's primary focus is fantasy rather than sports. \"Designated Hitter\" is another baseball story, but it is a straight science fiction story rather than alternate history. It didn't work as well for me as \"Batboy\" did, probably because it requires more knowledge of the techniques of baseball than I have.\n\n\"The Last Reunion\" is definitely not alternate history, though it recalls The Guns of the South in its story of a Confederate captain returning to Richmond in 1932 for a reunion of the Forty-seventh North Carolina. Turtledove recognizes the conflict between the nostalgia of the old soldier and the horrors of war, and my only complaint is that he doesn't do an entirely successful job of reconciling the two.\n\nIf there's such a thing as an alternate future story, \"Gladly Wolde He Lerne\" is one. Unfortunately, it's a bit predictable (especially after the introduction Turtledove wrote) and a bit preachy. In fact, while I like Turtledove's introductions to the stories, I would recommend reading them AFTER you read the respective stories.\n\nWe're on the receiving end of time traveling in \"The Barbecue, the Movie, and Other Unfortunately Not So Relevant Material,\" an amusing story and a good change of pace from some of the more serious stories in the book.\n\n\"In the Presence of Mine Enemies\" is set in one of the more common alternate history worlds, one in which Germany won the Second World War. It's about survival under adversity and if it seems unlikely, one merely has to look at the recent revelation that large numbers of Catholics in the Southwest are descended from Jews who fled to the New World to escape the Inquisition.\n\nJust as \"In the Presence of Mine Enemies\" might have been inspired by news that post-dated it, but wasn't (of course--Turtledove is a good writer but not a fortune-teller), so might have been \"The R Strain.\" In the latter case, it is the report of the babirusa, a cud-chewing pig, that could have generated this story of a genetically altered pig that just might be kosher. There has been much discussion on Usenet lately as to why pork is the ultimate non-kosher meat, even more so in people's minds than shellfish or anything else. And Turtledove's story acknowledges this by having its Conservative rabbi more concerned about whether the animal is prohibited than whether it has been killed in the kosher manner. To the non-Jew this may not matter, yet to a Jew reading this story there will remain the nagging feeling that if the rabbi is so blase about the manner of killing the animal, his opinion on its kosher status may also be suspect.\n\nI liked \"Lure\" for its use of Cenozoic mammals, a newly found interest of mine. Everyone is interested in dinosaurs, so I have to be different, I guess. Of course, this somewhat outre interest means I picked up some errors, such as Turtledove's having Cynodesmus, Diceratherium, and Syndoceros, all early Miocene North American mammals, in late Miocene Italy (my reference is The Macmillan Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Animals). But what the heck--we have dinosaur movies with cavemen and dinosaurs co-existing, and those are considerably further apart in time, if not in space. And \"Secret Names\" is a perfect follow-up to \"Lure,\" even though it is set in a post-holocaust future and at first appears to have nothing in common with a tale of prehistoric mammals. In fact, \"The R Strain,\" \"Lure,\" and \"Secret Names\" form a nice biological triptych.\n\n\"Les Mortes d'Arthur\" is primarily a science fiction murder mystery, with some sports thrown in. I found it similar to some of Isaac Asimov's \"Wendell Urth\" stories, and wonder if it isn't an homage of sorts to Asimov.\n\nThe only story I have a real problem with in this collection is \"Last Favor.\" Its evolutionary premise is interesting--and has to some extent been proposed as a model for certain groups here on Earth--but I think there are major problems in assuming its conscious self-application, particularly as described here. Then again, I'm sure if I'm wrong, some biologist will tell me.\n\nThe final story is \"Nasty, Brutish, and ....\" It's a bar story, and also a \"So there!\" to H. G. Wells (in a manner of speaking). Unlike the five stories preceding it, this one at least has some chance of being an alternate history, or at least a secret history.\n\n(There is also an excerpt from Turtledove's The Guns of the South, but since it's more an ad than a story, I won't review it here. I do recommend the book, though.)\n\nDEPARTURES is a must-buy for alternate history fans, and highly recommended even for the general science fiction fan.\n\nReturn to Harry Turtledove Bibliography\n\nWORLDWAR: IN THE BALANCE\n\nDel Rey, ISBN 0-345-38241-2, January 1994, 488pp, US$21. A book review by Evelyn C. Leeper Copyright 1994 Evelyn C. Leeper\n\nFirst, a warning: this is the first book of a four-book series. (According to what I've heard, the other three are WORLDWAR: TILTING THE BALANCE [already in Del Rey's hands], WORLDWAR: UPSETTING THE BALANCE [just finished], and WORLDWAR: FINDING THE BALANCE [still to be written].) Nowhere on the cover (or inside) does Del Rey warn you of this, and unlike some first novels which can be read as stand-alone stories, this ends on a very open-ended note, with little if anything resolved. Shame on Del Rey for not warning the reading! (Oh, and the cover art by Bob Eggleton has been flip-flopped. One assumes this is for some arcane marketing reason, but the result is that all the swastikas are backwards.)\n\nIt is May 1942. War is raging around the world. Major Heinrich Jager is fighting for the Third Reich on the Eastern Front. George Bagnall is a flight engineer for the RAF. Ludmila Gorbunova is a pilot, but for the Soviet Air Force. Moishe Russie is a Jew in the Warsaw Ghetto. Liu Han is a Chinese peasant woman. Jens Larssen is an American physicist on the Manhattan Project. Sam Yeager us a minor league outfielder and science fiction fan from Nebraska. Atvar is the fleetlord of the invading spaceships of the Race.\n\nSay what?\n\nOh, didn't I mention it? It seems that in this alternate universe, lizardlike aliens from outer space invade Earth in 1942. Needless to say, this changes the progress of World War II considerably. Alliances shift in interesting ways as humans attempt to repel the invaders. This often involves uneasy truces and alliances, as countries unite with their erstwhile (human) enemies to fight the invaders while trying to avoid conceding any advantage to these (human) enemies that might backfire if and when the Race is defeated.\n\nOne thing that Turtledove has managed to do is take plot devices and writing techniques that often fail, and make them work. For example, the book starts with a bit of a cliche: the Race surveyed Earth eight hundred years ago and is amazed at the amount of progress made since then, since they show change or progress only over periods of millennia rather than years (for example, between steam engines and powered flight, or between dynamite and atomic bombs). But there is further explanation and elaboration of this as the story progresses and as the history, biology, and psychology of the Race is revealed. the result is that there are REASONS given for this \"slowness\" on the part of the Race. That's the flip-side of an alternate history, I suppose. An alternate history asks, \"What would have happened if Y had happened instead of X?\" Here Turtledove asked, \"What would have had to have been different for X to happen instead of Y?\" It's the difference between induction and retroduction (as described by Charles Peirce). Detectives use retroduction (also known as abduction) to figure out what could have led to a certain result; Sherlock Holmes was famous for it. It is seen in science fiction, but more common is the inductive aspect: build a world, then decide what would populate it. (There's also some rather obvious foreshadowing when the Race complain of the cold in Poland-- in the middle of the summer.)\n\nThe characters on the whole are well fleshed out, though with as many major characters as WORLDWAR: IN THE BALANCE has, it's not too surprising that a couple of them are still thinly sketched (undoubtedly some of these will be further developed in the remaining volumes). The multiple points of view do give a very good \"global\" feel to this book that many alien invasion stories lacked--how often is everything told through American eyes, with only passing reference to the rest of the world? Here the parts of the world not portrayed are those which are not on a war footing when the Race arrived, and so have less ability to resist the Race. (The end papers contain a list of all the major characters--and some minor ones--with indications as to which are real and which are fictional creations. I would have hoped the latter clarification wasn't necessary, but after someone asked Connie Willis whether the General Grant character in her LINCOLN'S DREAMS was real or fictional, one never knows. And admittedly some of Turtledove's \"real\" characters are less famous than others. At any rate, I hope Del Rey continues this for the rest of the series--in a story published over a period of years, some memory joggers are helpful.)\n\nTurtledove knows how to write a plot and characters that keep the reader interested and turning the pages. Whether he can sustain this for two thousand pages remains to be seen, but this book is at least a good start.\n\nReturn to Harry Turtledove Bibliography\n\nTHE CASE OF THE TOXIC SPELL DUMP\n\nBaen, ISBN 0-671-72196-8, 1993, US$5.99 A book review by Evelyn C. Leeper Copyright 1993 Evelyn C. Leeper\n\nThis is, I suppose, an alternate history of sorts. Magic works, all the gods and goddesses and other supernatural beings are real, and so on. Yet except for a few minor name changes (the District of Columbia is the District of Saint Columba, for example, and Los Angeles is Angel City), everything else is pretty much the same. While this is extremely unlikely in a real alternate history (is that an oxymoron?), it hardly matters here however, since this story is *not* trying to be a classic alternate history story. I mention it only for those who have come to expect Turtledove to write alternate history stories.\n\nThere are two aspects to this book: plot and puns. The plot involves David Fisher, an inspector for the EPA (Environmental Perfection Agency) and his investigation of a possible leak at a toxic spell dump. This leak appears to be causing babies to be born without souls. The puns are layered on top of the plot--often, in my opinion, obscuring it completely. It's too easy to get so wrapped up in spotting puns that you stop following the storyline. And Turtledove is shameless when it comes to puns. Not only does he refer to an overweight psychic and a Britisher who contacts spirits from the past as \"the large medium and the English channeler,\" but he doesn't shirk from talking about the \"devil with a blue dress on\" or even including as narrative almost an entire verse of \"Love Potion Number Nine.\" It may seem an odd criticism, but I think Turtledove's plot is interesting enough that the constant puns hurt, rather than help, the book. Conversely, the puns are good enough that you sometimes wish the plot didn't distract you from them. I like sushi and I like hot fudge, but they don't mix well either.\n\nOne aspect of the premise I found fascinating, if a bit paradoxical, was the idea that all religions were \"right.\" With the constant proof of them in everyday life, people in Turtledove's universe are more religious-- because they really believe that they will be punished if they're not. Aside from what ramifications this has for free will and faith versus proof, it leads me to wonder why the god(s) of one religion don't (or can't) punish the believers in a different religion. David Fisher is an observant Jew (actually another nice touch--one rarely finds the heroes of novels to be observant Jews, or even observant anything-elses), but why? He recognizes that all other religions are \"true,\" so why does he remain Jewish? Is conversion not allowed? If so, what does that do to religions that require \"informed consent\" (i.e., you can become a full member only when you are old enough to make your own choice)? Do these religions never form in this universe? Does it have only religions one is born into? (Or baptized into at birth?) Maybe this whole subject interests me because I've been reading about why people change their religion and it seems to be more a social or emotional thing than that they decide they actually believe the formal tenets of one religion over another. (Lots of stuff here in case there's a sequel, I guess.) At any rate, Turtledove gives one a lot of food for thought here, and this may be somewhat of a surprise in a book that is basically a comedy-adventure.\n\nIt may be just my personal taste for religious-based science fiction and fantasy, but I found THE CASE OF THE TOXIC SPELL DUMP enjoyable and surprisingly meaty. If you have an appreciation--or at least a high toleration--for endless puns, I strongly recommend it.\n\nReturn to Harry Turtledove Bibliography\n\nTHE CASE OF THE TOXIC SPELL DUMP\n\ndani@netcom.com (Dani Zweig)\n\nHarry Turtledove's \"The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump\" is silly, it's overflowing with bad puns, and -- unusual for books of that sort -- it's a good read even without the silliness.\n\nThe basic premise is a variation of a familiar one: The story takes place in a world just like ours, except that magic does everything that science does here. (Actually, most of the magic is theurgic, relying on divine or demonic powers.) So people drive carpets instead of cars, but LA still has traffic jams, and Japanese knitting mills are still turning carpets out more cheaply than American ones. Badly injured people wind up in the Intensive Prayer Unit and everyone's excited about the possibilities of Virtuous Reality and Djinn Splicing. Central Intelligence really does employ spooks. You get the idea.\n\nDavid Fisher's job at the Environmental Perfection Agency is fairly bureaucratic in nature. He worries about containing the spread of the Medvamp and whether importing Leprechauns will upset the local thecology. That is, it's fairly bureaucratic in nature until he gets a tip that something is wrong with the local Toxic Spell Dump. He soon finds himself way over his head, in a case that seems to involve black magics, the threat of global war, and lawyers from every firm that uses that Dump.\n\nThe book is no \"Operation Chaos\" -- the bad puns guarantee that, if nothing else -- but it was fun to read, with a solid story that doesn't *depend* on the silliness.\n\nReturn to Harry Turtledove Bibliography\n\nTHE PRINCE OF THE NORTH\n\ndani@telerama.lm.com (Dani Zweig)\n\nTurtledove's \"Prince of the North\" is competent formula fiction. In this instance, the formula is Turtledove's own: Create a milieu based on a familiar historical model, put a man with relatively modern sensibilities at the head of a military force, and give him a series of conventional or unconventional opponents. (The protagonist can be pseudo or actual Roman, Byzantine, American, whatever, but he can't be so much a product of his time and place that the reader will find him unsympathetic.)\n\n\"Prince of the North\" is set in a fantasy world based on northern Europe (probably north Gaul, less probably England) after the Roman withdrawal and the first barbarian incursions. Sorcery and theurgy both work (the fact that Gerin the Fox, the Prince of the North, has gotten on the bad side of the God of wine is significant to the plot), but aside from that the landscape is familiar. Minor barons in the abandoned lands have declared themselves princes and dukes, lesser leaders have placed themselves under the protection of the more powerful ones, peasants have taken the first steps on the road to serfdom. (As is common in such fantasies, the existence of magic makes incredibly little difference in how people live. A more subtle problem is that although swearing by a God is a near-guarantee of honesty -- the Gods taking a personal interest in such oaths -- this also seems to have relatively little effect on how people order their lives.)\n\nThe book has a number of subplots, but at its center is an incursion of beast-men. An earthquake destroys an ancient warding and the land is invaded by hordes of ravening, relatively-intelligent, monsters. (One wonders what they ate for the centuries or millenia they lived underground.) This keeps Gerin busy for most of the book -- fighting the beasts, fighting the barbarians who have allied with the beasts, allying with rivals to fight the beasts -- a book written to Baen specifications -- until, with the book about to end, the problem is resolved by a deus ex machina. So one way to look at it is that the book serves mainly to introduce the characters and the milieu: There will be a sequel.\n\nI found it an adequate read, but the sense of reading formula clouded my pleasure in the book. I enjoyed the Videssos tetralogy, but this didn't mean that I was looking for another book about a Roman-type military leader (with similar romantic fortunes) backed up by a tough soldier and a well-educated advisor. The fact that the book was so thoroughly first-in- a-series -- with remarkably little difference between the situation at the beginning of the book and at its end -- also detracted.\n\nWhether you'd enjoy the book depends on your previous experience with Turtledove. If you haven't read any of his books before, this isn't the place to start: The Videssos tetralogy (starting with \"The Misplaced Legion\") does military fantasy better, \"Agent of Byzantium\" does alternate historical fantasy better, and \"The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump\" is good semi-light fantasy. If, at the other extreme, you're reading and enjoying his Krispos novels, you'll enjoy this too.\n\nReturn to Harry Turtledove Bibliography\n\nWORLDWAR: TILTING THE BALANCE\n\nDel Rey, ISBN 0-345-38997-2, 1995, 478pp, US$22\n\nA book review by Evelyn C. Leeper\n\nCopyright 1995 Evelyn C. Leeper\n\nThis is the second of Turtledove's \"Worldwar\" tetralogy. The first, WORLDWAR: IN THE BALANCE, came out a year ago, and the next two will be out in 1996 and 1997. (This fact is mentioned peripherally in the blurbs and the jacket copy, but is not evident from the cover. I mention it because the reader should know to read the first book first. I am not going to give a thorough summary here.)\n\nWhile the first book set up the premise--an alien race invades the Earth in the middle of World War II--the second continues the many threads started therein. So we're still following stories in the Soviet, Poland, Germany, Britain, China, Japan, Illinois, Colorado, and probably a few more that I've forgotten. (Oh, yes, and Croatia, though not quite the same Croatia that he wrote about in \"Ready for the Fatherland.\" There's something about the Balkans, apparently, that makes them an ideal setting for novels about conflict.) Even Turtledove realizes that he's juggling too many balls and can't keep introducing new characters forever, so he starts eliminating some of them. (Luckily the book includes a five-page cast of characters to help the reader keep the people and the aliens straight.) Personally, I think there may be a few threads too many, and there were one or two that I found myself skimming (Russian tactical maneuvers just don't do it for me, I guess).\n\nIntermixed with the stories directly related to the invasion stories are the personal stories, which are not as effective and often seem to have been added either to make some philosophical point or to provide some not-so-subtle motivation for the characters to do what Turtledove wants or needs them to do. The result is that a character at one point completely rejects a certain path of action, while later expressing great admiration for a group that had traditionally followed that path. (It's hard to avoid spoilers, but I'm trying.) This seems just a bit inconsistent to me. In fact, what this character wants is basically that what happened somehow \"un-happen,\" so we have an interesting internal alternate history parallel.\n\nOne thing I like about Turtledove's writing in general is that he has Jewish characters--real Jewish characters, not just a lab assistant named Saul Rubinstein who shows up in a couple of scenes, but rounded, central Jewish characters who think and act Jewish. And WORLDWAR is no exception. This makes it doubly strange that so many of his other characters seem stereotypical: the Illinois nurse, the Japanese officers, the Croatians, and so on. Maybe this is part of the price of having so many characters: it's impossible to build them all from scratch. Whether this ever veers into something negative enough to complain about is not clear, but some groups do seem to be portrayed fairly negatively (and not just the Nazis, many of whom are the good guys!).\n\nThe first volume covered about a year, as does this. But Turtledove sets up some long-term events that seem to indicate that either the last two books will cover a longer timespan or there will be room for a sequel. (It is possible he can wrap up the threads in another two years, but it seems unlikely.)\n\nWell, okay, I've talked about bits and pieces of WORLDWAR: TILTING THE BALANCE, but what about the novel as a whole? I found it not as enjoyable as the first, but in part this is due to its placement in the series. The first book of a tetralogy is fresh and new, introducing the scenario and characters. The second develops them further, the third (one presumes) will do the necessary setup for the last volume, and the last (one hopes) will wrap it all up. This means that of necessity books two and three won't have the \"punch\" of the first and last books, and that is the case here. Turtledove does his best, but the sheer multiplicity of story threads, and the knowledge that there are still two years and two more volumes to go, is a bit intimidating.\n\nReturn to Harry Turtledove Bibliography\n\nTHE TWO GEORGES\n\nby Richard Dreyfuss and Harry Turtledove\n\nA book review by Evelyn C. Leeper\n\nCopyright 1996 Evelyn C. Leeper\n\nThe cover describes Dreyfuss as an Oscar winner, and Turtledove as a Hugo winner. Of the two, the latter is perhaps more germane to the book -- Dreyfuss won as an actor, not a writer. But Turtledove has said that Dreyfuss contributed heavily to the dialogue, so perhaps this is a more equal partnership than last year's team of Gingrich and Forstchen. However, this book does have the (apparently) obligatory sex scene. Mercifully, this one is shorter.\n\nThe premise of THE TWO GEORGES is that there was no American Revolution. The exact details of how this occurred (or perhaps more accurately, failed to occur) are not spelled out. This is actually a good touch, because too often the background is given as a sort of \"lump,\" something like, \"Fred mused how different the world would be if Queen Mary had died earlier and her bastard sister Elizabeth had become Queen of England.\" There's actually something refreshing about NOT getting all the details.\n\nOf course, Dreyfuss and Turtledove don't entirely avoid this sort of thing. There are a fair number of references to what Washington or King George (the two Georges of the title) did and how that affected the present. Given that we rarely find ourselves thinking how different our world would be if there were no American Revolution, at least in our daily routine, this does feel a bit artificial. And the main character at one point is reading THE UNITED COLONIES TRIUMPHANT, an alternate history book about OUR world.\n\nThe book is alternate history but the plot is strictly mystery: the famous Gainsborough painting \"The Two Georges\" has been stolen while touring the North American colonies and just before King-Emperor Charles III was due to speak in front of it. The radical separatist group, the Sons of Liberty, has stolen it and is demanding a ransom for its return, and Colonel Thomas Bushnell and Samuel Stanley of the RAMP are assigned to recover the painting, which is a major cultural icon (sort of like the original Declaration of Independence).\n\nTurtledove is good at research, so it's hard to find errors per se. One of my complaints is more a stylistic one: I find it difficult to believe that two hundred years after the break point we would have any of the same people as we have in our world, and in very similar positions. In particular, I find it difficult to explain how Martin Luther King, Jr., would have been as involved in politics in a society with far fewer racial problems that our own as he was in ours. I also question whether the Irish would be as prominent, since a change in politics preventing the American Revolution might very well have prevented the Irish Potato Famine as well. Other references that served more as stumbling blocks than stepping stones were Beethoven writing his Third Symphony to celebrate Napoleon's uprising against Louis XVI, and the use of \"To Anacreon in Heaven\" as the North American anthem. Language-wise Dreyfuss and Turtledove sick fairly closely to British English (with references to serviettes rather than napkins, for example), but do occasionally slip, calling trousers pants, or vests undershirts. (I am reminded of the recent report of the British MP who was found dead in \"pants and suspenders.\" To most Americans, this doesn't sound too shocking; however, the American translation is that he was found in \"undershorts and a garter belt.\")\n\nUnfortunately, the mystery part of this novel, which is the main plot, is not particularly well-constructed. Clues are telegraphed, and in general there is a lot of fairly standard stuff going on. There is also a fairly standard romance with Bushnell meeting a professional woman with whom he initially does not get along, and so on.\n\nI liked the background of THE TWO GEORGES, even with my reservations, and would recommend it for that reason to alternate history fans. But it is the alternate history aspect that makes this book worthwhile. If that aspect doesn't appeal to you, you can skip it as a mystery.\n\nReturn to Harry Turtledove Bibliography\n\nTHE TWO GEORGES\n\nby Richard Dreyfuss and Harry Turtledove reviewed by Alayne McGregor\n\nIt's 1996: King-Emperor Charles III is the middle of his glorious reign over a British Empire covering the globe, while the Sons of Liberty plot his overthrow. Giant airships carry passengers from Victoria, the capital of the North American Union, across the continent to New Liverpool; however, when Governor-General Sir Martin Luther King wants to cross to the California coast, he does it by train, with political speeches at every whistle-stop.\n\nYou may have gathered this world is slightly different from ours.\n\nIn this world, there never was an American Revolution. Instead, George III and George Washington reached an agreement in the 1760s to create a separate privy council for the American colonies, satisfying the colonists' concerns and keeping North America securely in the Empire. That agreement was immortalized by Gainsborough in his painting The Two Georges, which has become an icon in the NAU. Copies of the painting even adorn paper banknotes.\n\nIt's no wonder Colonel Thomas Bushnell of the Royal American Mounted Police is nervous. He has the duty of guarding The Two Georges for a two-month stay in a museum in New Liverpool. Everything looks secure at the opening reception at the governor's mansion, but the Sons of Liberty are cleverer; a guest is assassinated, and, in the confusion, the painting is spirited away.\n\nThat's the signal for Bushnell to embark on a search across the continent from the far north-western islands to the east coast, trying to discover the Sons' network. On the way, we see a very different society than today's United States or Canada: more hierarchical and linked to Britain, but also more peaceful, and with better treatment of its black, Hispanic, and Indian minorities.\n\nTogether with his stalwart black adjutant, Samuel Stanley, and Kathleen Flannery, the chief curator for the travelling exhibition (who can't quite be dropped from the list of suspects), Bushnell has to dodge Russian bullets and grenades as he fights for his country against a bunch of xenophobic extremists, who will do anything to make America \"free\".\n\nI suspect that, as a Canadian, I didn't find this alternate history nearly as shocking as an American would. On the other thing, I had some problems with the implicit assumption that a British North America would be that much more civilized or less revolutionary than the U.S.: the authors perhaps didn't know about the Corn Riots in 19th century England, or the Mackenzie- Papineau Rebellion, the Riel Rebellion, and the North-West Rebellion in 19th-century Canada?\n\nI also wondered whether so large an Empire could have really stood united for so long. Obviously the world wars in this century made the underpinnings of Empire much less stable, but even still the serious concerns of many residents in places like India and South Africa would still have destabilized continued colonization of their countries?\n\nAs well, I had serious doubts that the NAU would be governed by a politician as governor-general. If one looks at other large British colonies like Canada or Australia, they consistently moved to having the governor-general as a (mostly) figurehead representative of the Monarch, with a Prime Minister and a local Parliament wielding the real power, at least in internal affairs. Given that the Prime Ministerial/Parliamentary system was already well established in England in the 1760s, I would have expected the NAU to have either immediately adopted that model or evolved to it.\n\nLastly, I found some of the suggested place names in the NAU bizarre: Victoria was reasonable as the capital (although why anyone would choose the Washington, DC, area as a capital given the whole of North America is beyond me), but Ontario for the current location of Manitoba? I strongly doubt that Quebec would have exactly its current boundaries in the NAU: more likely the top two-thirds would be a separate Cree nation.\n\nTurtledove and Dreyfuss obviously had fun with inserting a few recent politicians as characters: Tricky Dick (known as Honest Dick to his friends), who makes millions selling used steamers (aka steam-powered cars); Sir Martin Luther King whose preacher background still sometimes shows in the speeches he makes as Governor-General; and John F. Kennedy, the fiery 70-year-old publisher of _Common Sense_, the journal that still preaches liberty for Americans. I had my doubts that an alternate history could produce characters corresponding so closely to ones in our history, but the liberty was forgivable.\n\nAs a story, this book was lots of fun. The descriptions were consistently interesting -- although I didn't really need to know every detail of each meal or every time Bushnell felt the need to hit the bottle. Bushnell and his cohorts were convincing as police officers, and were involved in some really exciting scenes, although the pace sometimes flagged a bit between those scenes. I particularly appreciated the fact I didn't guess the real villains or all the plot twists until the end.\n\nBut you'll enjoy this book best if you were raised on Haggard and Henty, Doyle and Buchan and Kipling. This book is set in a neo-Victorian world because it comes straight out of the tradition of Empire-builders, >from the Victorians and Edwardians who expanded the British empire and who were utterly convinced that they were civilizing the world.\n\nIf you're familiar with the style -- and the assumptions -- of that tradition, this will be a comfortable and thoroughly enjoyable read. Just don't expect anything more than a well-written thriller.\n\nReturn to Harry Turtledove Bibliography\n\nTHE TWO GEORGES by Richard Dreyfuss and Harry Turtledove reviewed by Bruce Byfield\n\nI just finished Harry Turtledove and Richard Dreyfuss' \"The Two Georges.\" The novel kept me reading, even though I am starting to recognize some of Turtledove's pet motifs (such as the scene in which a man refuses to sleep with a woman who's just made a pass at him). However, the background of the novel was often unconvincing. To start with, the novel is full of the Great Man view of history. George Washington makes his peace with England, so the American War of Independence never happens; Napoleon Bonaparte is a royalist, so the French Revolution never happens; a single Iroquois sees the need to modernize, so the whole Six Nation modernizes. Connected to such events, this view isn't very plausible: you might argue that Washington won the American Revolution, but there were dozens of reasons for it to happen, even without him. Secondly, the novel assumes that, without these revolutions, the world would generally be a more conservative place. Maybe so, but I doubt it. What is noteworthy in 19th century English history is the degree to which reform happened without revolution. Moreover, as many reforms happened under Conservative English governments as Liberal ones. And, far from being less technologically advanced, a world in which 19th century values still existed in 1996 might be ahead of ours--it's this century, not the last one, which questioned the myth of progress in a big way. Thirdly, the world seems dominated, not so much by Victorian values as those of the 1940s and 1950s. Turtledove has often been complimentary about the social mores of a generation ago; his view seems to be that we'd be better off if we still kept them, adding only a little tolerence. That's a matter of opinion, but the view makes for inconsistency. For example, at the same time that \"The Two Georges\" shows a world in which men watch their language in front of women and ask them before smoking, career women are starting to appear. In other words, at the same time that women are given special status, they're starting to assert their equality--all without any breakdown of the values which give them special status. Fourthly, since I live in Canada--in some ways a real life counterpart to the North American Union of the novel--I found much of the background inaccurate. For example, the NAU isn't a colony, but it's ruled by a Governor-General. In fact, it has Dominion status (a term not used in the book), so it would have a Prime Minister. Nor would this PM be as free to act as an American President; unlike the GG in the novel, he'd constantly be consulting cabinet ministers and parliament. Similarly, the police in the novel--obviously based on the RCMP--wouldn't have the old English tradition of not carrying weapons. If, like the RCMP, they started as a paramilitary organization to keep order on the frontier, they'd be perfectly familiar with firearms. For that matter, details like not carrying guns seems to have far more to do with stereotypes about England than with reality or plausibility (although I understand why such a detail might be used--it allows for more contrast with the violence of our society). Despite these faults, the book kept me reading. And I appreciate a scene set in the Queen Charlottes, even if the writers don't consider the difficulties of carrying full-length weapons through a west coast rain forest. But, with a little ore attention to details, the book could have been much better than it was.\n\nThe Great War: American Front\n\nReviewed by James Neal Webb\n\nOriginally appearing in BookPage, 6/98\n\nWith The Great War: American Front, Harry Turtledove continues to fascinate readers with his stories of alternate history.\" From his Worldwar tetralogy (aliens invade the earth during World War II) to The Guns of the South (time travelers equip Robert E. Lee with AK-47s). the \"what ifs,\" of war are played out on the printed page. In his newest series, Turtledove returns to a world where the South won the great conflict, but the result, while enthralling, is not very cheery.\n\nIn The Great War, the world was we know it hinges on a lost set of battle plans wrapped around some cigars during the Civil War. In Turtledove's world, the plans weren't lost, and the South won the War Between the States.\n\nIn How Few Remain, the first book of this series, a second. bitter war is fought in the 1880s, ending in a standoff, but the real story is how the lives and philosophies of the two countries are forever altered. In The Great War, the uneasy truce comes to a violent end with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914: the first World War begins, but this time it is fought on American soil.\n\nPicture this--from Maryland to Utah, Quebec to Oklahoma. Kentucky to Hawaii. Americans are fighting Americans, on the ground, in the air, under the sea, in trenches, in tanks, with aerial bombardments, poison gas, prison camps and firing squads.\n\nDespite a plethora of interesting characters, it's really hard to root for either side. That is also the strength and power of this book: Turtledove offers a balanced portrayal of the men and women on both sides of the conflict. Whereas in How Few Remains the main characters are Abe Lincoln, Mark Twain, George Armstrong Custer, and Teddy Roosevelt, famous Americans of history play only a peripheral role in this book.\n\nThe real heroes of The Great War are those that look with horror at the war. They are the poor and down-troddeni-African-Americans, manumiitted and second-class citizens in both nations. and the poor white working class in both the north and south. They are communists.\n\nThat's right. communists. They read works by Marx and Lenin and Lincoln(!). And, as astonishing as it might seem, the \"reds\" offer the only hope the two countries have-but at what cost? Their fate rmains to be seen, as Turtledove leaves us hanging at the end of The Great War, I'm sure his next book will be worth the wait.\n\nReturn to Harry Turtledove Bibliography"
