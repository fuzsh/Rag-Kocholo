        "text": "About the Book\n\nThis new novel of the Crosstime Traffic series follows \"Gunpowder Empire\" and is set in 21st-century San Francisco, a parallel world where the Kaiser's Germany won World War I and went on to dominate the world.\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nIn a parallel-world 21st-century San Francisco where the Kaiser's Germany won World War One and went on to dominate the world, Paul Gomes and his father Lawrence are secret agents for our timeline, posing as traders from a foreign land. They run a storefront shop called Curious Notions, selling what is in our world routine consumer technology-record players, radios, cassette decks--all of which is better than anything in this world, but only by a bit. Their real job is to obtain raw materials for our timeline. Just as importantly, they must guard the secret of Crosstime Traffic--for of the millions of parallel timelines, this is one of the few advanced enough to use that secret against us.\n\nNow, however, the German occupation police are harassing them. They want to know where they're getting their mysterious goods. Under pressure, Paul and Lawrence hint that their supplies comes from San Francisco's Chinese...setting in motion a chain of intrigues that will put the entire enterprise of Crosstime Traffic at deadly risk. Curious Notions is the second book in Harry Turtledove's Crosstime Traffic series.\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\"Readers nostalgic for the juvenile SF novels of Robert A. Heinlein and Andre Norton will find much to enjoy...Turtledove presents his teenaged heroes with a series of moral choices and dilemmas that will particularly resonate with younger fans. This is a rousing story that reminds us that 'adventure' is really someone else in deep trouble a long way off.\" --Publishers Weekly on Gunpowder Empire\n\n\"Turtledove has proved he can divert his readers to astonishing places...I know I'd follow his imagination almost anywhere.\" --San Jose Mercury News \"One of alternate history's authentic modern masters.\" --Booklist \"Harry Turtledove is probably the best practitioner of the classic alternate-history story since L. Sprague de Camp.\" --Locus\n\nAbout the Author\n\nHarry Turtledove is an American fantasy and science fiction writer who Publishers Weekly has called the \"Master of Alternate History.\" He has received numerous awards and distinctions, including the Hugo Award for Best Novella, the HOMer Award for Short story, and the John Esthen Cook Award for Southern Fiction.
