        "text": "So I’ve already talked about two Harry Turtledove series before, Darkness and WorldWar, so now it’s time to talk about Turtledove’s other famous book series. The unofficially named “Timeline-191” (and sometimes Southern Victory) comprises of eleven books detailing the history of the two American countries after the South won the American Civil War. Told from multiple viewpoints from both countries (and one or two thrown in from Canada), we experience the tragic history of these two countries as they are drawn into conflict again and again up until 1945. Now, upfront, I honestly think this may be Turtledove’s weakest major series but before I divulge why, let’s dive into the series and see what makes it so special and one of the most famous alternate history stories of our modern day and age.\n\nSo the first Timeline-191 book is called How Few Remain. In this book we understand why the South won the American Civil War and what happened to the two countries shortly after. After a brief prologue dedicated to the defeat of the Union, the book picks up twenty years later where the two American countries pick up arms again and fight each other but this time it’s for the C.S.A. acquisition of two Mexican provinces. Fearing that the C.S.A. would become too strong, the U.S.A. declares war on the C.S.A. but is abysmally defeated thanks to the C.S.A.’s reliable generals and its alliance with France and Britain.\n\nHow Few Remain is probably the most interesting book in the series as it can stand by itself very easily. The book retains all of the Second Mexican War and its immediate consequences as well and as such, many of our stories have a clear beginning and a satisfying ending. What’s more, unlike the rest of the series, all of our viewpoint characters follow historical characters like Theodore Roosevelt and Mark Twain. The book also offers very reasonable ideas of what the world may be like in 1881 such as the C.S.A’s continual involvement with France and Britain and the dominance of Democrats in the U.S.A. up until the 1880s. Now, Turtledove could have just left How Few Remain as it is but he decided to take this story he created and make a mega book series out of it. What follows is the next logical step in our timeline, and a 30 year jump with it, the Great War.\n\nThis is my favorite part of the series and it’s awesome. Because the C.S.A. allied itself with France and Britain, the U.S.A., in return, allied itself with Germany and the Austria-Hungary Empire to acquire its own strong allies. Of course, everything went to Hell in a handbasket, thanks to a certain Archduke, and now, not only do you have the mess of Europe fighting each other, but now you got the U.S.A. fighting Canada and the C.S.A! It’s a literal world war at this point.\n\nSo the first reason why the Great War trilogy is my favorite part in Timeline-191 is how it’s not immediately clear who will win this war. It could honestly go either way. In How Few Remain, right from the start, the U.S.A. is kind of done for so there’s not as much incentive to read the book. But for the Great War, it’s so close and even that any small event can help push the war one way or another.\n\nI also like how Turtledove just didn’t pull any punches with the harshness of trench warfare and the dire outlook for many of the soldier’s lives. The settings and characters are highly realistic and don’t offer that sweet storytelling guidelines many of us are familiar with. It’s very similar to the Song of Ice and Fire series, actually. I also like how diverse our viewpoint characters are ranging from regular soldiers, to spies, farmers, commanders, and politicians. We definitely get a full spectrum of viewpoints that cue us in what’s happening in this crazy world. Turtledove excels at this and has done this before in the Darkness and Worldwar series. This is a guilty pleasure but honestly one of my favorite POV characters is Gordon McSweeney who is a stupid, badass bigot. The things this guy says and does in this series is great.\n\nNow, there is a third reason but let me get back to that in a moment…\n\nSo, spoilers, the U.S.A. along with the other Central Powers, won the Great War. The series doesn’t end there though as we are treated to our next trilogy in the series, American Empire. This trilogy is kind of weak as there are jumps of time within the books. The three books cover about twenty years altogether meaning there’s a lot of plot development crammed into characters whom we already don’t spend much time with.\n\nHowever, the second, and primary reason, why the Timeline-191 series falters at this point is Turtledove’s over reliance in incorporating plot developments that mirror our real world. I’m serious. Turtledove oversaturates his story with parallel events that almost defeats the purpose of an alternate history genre. Long story short, the C.S.A. becomes Nazi Germany and fights the U.S.A. again in the 1940s. And guess what? The C.S.A. loses! Go figure!\n\nNow, the next four books in the series, called Settling Accounts, is entertaining to read but by this point, all sense of disbelief is kind of thrown to the curb and we aren’t as engaged with the story as we kind of know what will happen in the end. I even stopped reading the series by this point due to the aforementioned reasons and it was getting depressing fast. You see, throwing in a little nod here or there in reference to our timeline is fun or all but this is just overkill.\n\nThis is why I liked the Great War part of the storyline the best. True, there are historical references in this trilogy but it doesn’t control the story as much as it does later on. The trilogy is fun, original, and not bogged down by its sheer alternate history glory. I’ve actually read online that supposedly, the U.S.A. was going to lose the Great War and actually become the next fascist power in North America. But then Turtledove decided later on that that wasn’t going to happen which explains several things. One, Jake Featherston, who becomes the C.S.A.’s Hitler, was a pretty nice, if awkward, guy early on before he almost suddenly develops this hatred against African Americans; and two, Gordon McSweeney was probably going to be the U.S.A.’s version of Hitler until Turtledove pulled the plug on that idea and killed him off, rather inexplicably, at the end of the trilogy. Very interesting fan theory for sure and I’m interested to see how that story could have turned out. Regardless, because of this switch, the Great War trilogy is not as tied down compared to the rest of the series and that’s what makes it so good. My advice is to read How Few Remain and the Great War trilogy and just stop there.\n\nThere’s a lot more to talk about this series so I’ll just leave that for another time. For now, I’m curious to see if you like this series and if you agree with me or not. If not, is there another alternate history story you like better involving the American Civil War? Let me know!\n\nAliens invade Earth during World War 2.\n\nSo is the basic, and awesome, concept behind one of Harry Turtledove’s greatest novel series, the “Worldwar” series. First published in 1994, this 8-book series is one of the most famous alternate history stories written and poses one of the most delightful what-if questions ever asked. What if aliens invaded Earth during World War 2?\n\nNow, WW2 is like a magnet when it comes to alternate histories. Soooooo many authors have written about this war posing various what-if questions but they’re usually about what if Nazi Germany won the war. No other topic in history, not even what if the Confederate States of America won the American Civil War, comes even close to matching the popularity of this topic. As such, alternate historical WW2 stories oversaturate the genre and make it hard to find good stories from this small pool.\n\nWhat Harry Turtledove does to differentiate himself from other writers is focus on the point of divergence (the point in history where something happened differently than from our own timeline). It’s not Roosevelt or Hitler that gets assassinated, it’s not Nazi Germany refraining from declaring war on the U.S.S.R., it’s not Japan refraining from bombing Pearl Harbor, it’s an alien invasion. Freaking aliens.\n\nNow at this point, you might be saying to yourself, “but they’re aliens! Shouldn’t they be able to steamroll over us and conquer Earth no problem?” You might be right, BUT, these aliens are practical…sensible…and not farcical. These aliens have technology similar to ours right now but with an added bonus of say…50 years from now or so. They have interstellar but slower than light travel, they have large spaceships for holding armies, and they have cryonics to preserve the soldiers during the long flight. So their technology is not too-farfetched.\n\nMore importantly though, the aliens, known as “The Race,” were not expecting this degree of advancement from the humans. When the Race sent their first probes to Earth, they sent back pictures and videos of humans riding horses while wielding swords and bows. The probes painted an image of the human race as relatively backwards and not a threat to the more technology advanced the Race. As such, when the Race arrived to the war-torn world of Earth, they were expecting an easy conquering of a backward species.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why the Worldwar series is a great series of novels to read. We are presented with a believable science fiction setting that offers a conflict that is not one-sided and can be viewed from multiple protagonists. Oh yeah, the protagonists. In typical Turtledove fashion, we are presented many different protagonists to follow from various walks of life, both human and the Race. They offer us a glimpse into their world and paint us a picture on what events are affecting them and what events they are affecting in return. My favorite POV is probably Molotov though Atvar, the Fleet Overlord of the Race, is a good character as well.\n\nThe second reason why this series is so great is that it does not overly rely on parallel historical events to tell a story. Let me give you an example of what I mean. Some authors, like Harry Turtledove, like to use events in their storyline as analogous to the actual historical events. In Harry Turtledove’s other famous series, Timeline-191, where the C.S.A. won the American Civil War, we see A LOT of parallels between the C.S.A. and Nazi Germany during the 1930s and 1940s and in the 1940s’ war between the C.S.A. and the U.S.A. In all honestly, it’s kind of annoying. I like my alternate history stories to progress like they naturally would and not just on some parallel track that was already determined by our timeline. This is why I like Timeline-191’s storyline during the Great War more so than the rest of the series because those parallel events are played down to the point of nonexistence.\n\nNow, to be fair, the Worldwar series does have analogous events but they are portrayed as events similar to what has already happened in human history. Many of the human characters compare the Race’s colonization of Earth relative to British Imperialism in the 19th century. Topics like Social Darwinism and racism are prevalent in the Race’s attitude towards humans. The humans disgust the Race with their non-seasonal mating, long-term romantic relationships, high amount of liquid waste, and ability to handle change easily. But these events do not directly portray one or two significant events that happen during the course of history. In fact, many fans of the series more often than not compare the Race War to that of the Vietnam War. Even then, this is more of just a point of observation rather than directly comparing battles or weapons that the two wars may have.\n\nAs such, we are given two strong reasons why the Worldwar series stands out from other alternate historical novels. An original concept combined with a story that is unchained from our own history provides a delightful read that can keep the readers on edge. When I read the Timeline-191 series or other similar stories, I can get a relative idea what may happen and who might be killed at the end of the story. Worldwar pushes this to the side and keeps us guessing what may happen in each exciting new book.\n\nAnd finally, in the television world where more and more companies like Netflix or Hulu are providing us with original, unhindered shows that can give us exciting and new series, I say this. The Worldwar series would be phenomenal if it was adapted into a television show. We already have shows with multiple protagonists, such as Game of Thrones, and there hasn’t been any good, strong science fiction shows in recent memory. What’s more, the tagline that I gave you at the beginning of the article is enough to entice anyone to at least check out the first episode\n\nAliens invade Earth during World War 2.\n\nSomeone has to make it. This series is awesome.\n\nMy only request is that you make the aliens chameleon-like cause god damnet, sooooo many book covers make them just reptilian-like. Make it happen!\n\nLong before I knew about Game of Thrones, there was another fantasy series that I was heavily invested in during the course of its publications. It was known as the Darkness Series, written by Harry Turtledove (also known as “the Master of Alternate History”). The Darkness Series is, in a sense, very similar to the Song of Ice and Fire series. Mainly, many viewpoint characters that are from different nations whose individual stories weave a larger, more epic story. These characters are from a fantastical world in the grip of war and who, even if they are a viewpoint character, can still die.\n\nThere is also another similarity the two have. If A Song of Ice and Fire is inspired by the War of Roses, then the Darkness Series is not only inspired by, but directly paralleled with, the events of World War 2. Each country in the Darkness Series, which takes place in the fiction continent of Derlavai, is usually based on one (sometimes a few) country(s) in our world. For instance, Algarve represents Nazi Germany while Unkerlant represents Soviet Russia. The similarities don’t stop there as these fictional nations have the same languages, city names, customs, and so forth as our world does.\n\nThese similarities though are highly jumbled. The Algarvian people speak Italian, have red hair, and wear kilts. Unkerlantians, meanwhile, speak German, wear tunics, and have a darker complexion. For those of you who are curious, the Jews are a race of people called Kaunians who are fair skinned, tall, have blonde hair, and speak a Slavic-like language.\n\nBut here, the similarities to our world end. Great rhinos are tanks, dragons are airplanes, fierce leviathans are submarines, rifles and pistols are wands that shoot energy beams, and magical crystals serve as communicating devices similar to our radios and telephones. Also, like Game of Thrones, the world’s countries are mainly monarchial. These fantastical elements are amazing and give a great twist to a world at war.\n\nI never had such joy in reading and appreciating a series such as this before. Figuring out what historical events are happening and guessing how the characters will survive was a real treat. And though we know that dear Algarve will eventually lose the war, what we don’t know is if our characters will survive the war or not. Some of my favorite characters did eventually past away and that was a great shame.\n\nTurtledove has a greater appreciation for characters than George R.R. Martin does. Though characters may die, their deaths do not seem premature or forced. We have grown to love and respect the viewpoint character as Turtledove takes time to flesh them out. We are also not bogged down with tons of characters who may show up for a few chapters and then go away without any further notice on what exactly happened to them.\n\nSome of the best moments in the book are when viewpoint characters meet each other for a brief moment. They may fight each other in the battlefield, walk by one another in a busy town, or develop an actual relationship of some kind with the other viewpoint character. I even developed an intricate diagram years ago dedicated to how all of the characters were connected to each other and it was amazing (too bad I can’t find it now).\n\nWell before I knew about Game of Thrones, I imagined what it would be like for this series to hit the small screen. At the time, I thought it would never happen but now with Game of Thrones being quite popular nowadays, that idea isn’t too far off. However, because of their similar concepts, people might think it was just a shameless rip-off which is too bad. Regardless, seeing the Darkness Series in live action would be amazing.\n\nIn short, if you are fan of Game of Thrones, epic fantasies, or World War 2, this is a great series of novels that is fun to read. I highly recommend it if you have the time.\n\n(for those who are curious the series goes Into the Darkness, Darkness Descending, Through the Darkness, Rulers of the Darkness, Jaws of Darkness, and Out of Darkness)"
