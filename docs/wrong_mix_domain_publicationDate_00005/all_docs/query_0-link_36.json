McFedries\n\nBantam Spectra (mass market original, 312 pages, $5.99 US/$8.99 Can)\n\nPublication date: February 2001\n\nHere's a challenge for you: A.A. McFedries is a pen-name; can you guess the real name? (I'm terrible at this game, but maybe you have a better sense for this sort of thing.) \"For Detective Sergeant Alicia Aldrich, a homicide investigator for the California State Police, it begins with the body of a nondescript man, brutalized and dumped in the desert near San Bernardino.

I don't think you'll want to miss this one. It's \"an unabashedly different book. It is a celebration of the inexhaustible shape-shifting power of stories. It is fantastic. It is mundane. And we are not in Kansas anymore. Other Voices, Other Doors includes: alternate John Lennons; an amateur alien novelist who can't sell his autobiography even when it is disguised as SF; the strangest nudie bar on the planet; a hit man who specializes in retribution for bad book reviews; the story of Job, starring Randy Newman; the mystery of the greatest living writer; a tennis match between Freud and Jung; a graphic depiction of a promising author's vasectomy; a cowboy hospital romance; and much, much more!\" Star Wars: Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter\n\nMichael Reaves\n\nLucas Books, Del Rey (hardcover, 310 pages, $26 US/$37 Can)\n\nPublication date: 6 February 2001\n\nDarth Maul was one of the creepiest looking and most under-utilized villains in the whole Star Wars film epic so far. What a disappointment! And what an opportunity to explore the character further in the media tie-in novels, like this one, set just prior to Star Wars: Episode I, The Phantom Menace. \"After years of waiting in the shadows, Darth Sidious is taking the first step in his master plan to bring the Republic to its knees. He meets secretly with his Neimoidian contacts in the Trade Federation to plan the blockade of the planet Naboo.

It's pretty ambitious to write a sequel to such a highly regarded classic, but then Shelley's work does leave room for the story to continue, and indeed Salas is not the first to rise to the challenge. This novel jumps back and forth from the future to the mid-19th century, and follows the discovery of various diaries and journals in which the quest for eternal life is continued after the demise of Dr. Victor Frankenstein, creator of the famous \"monster.\"\n\nLady Kel\n\nWondrous Strange: Tales of the Uncanny\n\nRobin Spriggs\n\nCircle Myth Press (trade, 264 pages, $13 US)\n\nPublication date: 1 January 2001\n\nA collection of dark fantasy, dark humour and horror stories from the co-author of The Dracula Poems and a prolific writer of short fiction. His work has appeared in numerous anthologies and magazines, including Going Postal and Cemetery Dance. \"A tin-can golem in search of her long-lost maker... An old movie house where the cost of admission is far greater than the patrons think... A boyhood friendship changed forever by a woman of flowers adrift in a backwoods stream... Three dead sisters who come to life each evening to receive a gentleman caller in their parlor of ravaged hopes and dreams: These are but a few of the strange wonders awaiting the reader within.\"\n\nJohn Howe\n\nOceans of Magic\n\nedited by Brian M. Thomsen and Martin H. Greenberg\n\nDAW Fantasy (mass market original,310 pages, $6.99 US/$9.99 Can)\n\nPublication date: February 2001\n\nThis is a themed anthology of 13 all-new stories from Tanya Huff, Kristine Kathryn Rusch, Fiona Patton, Rosemary Edghill, Mike Resnick & Tom Gerencer, Mickey Zucker Reichert, and others. This time the theme is \"the seas, with all their mystery and danger, their lure of adventure and hidden treasure.\" The stories are grouped into 3 more or less self-explanatory sections: \"Voyages in History,\" \"Magical Maritime\" and \"Deities and the Deep Blue Sea.\" Of Men & Monsters\n\nWilliam Tenn\n\nVictor Gollancz SF Collectors' Edition (trade, 256 pages, £9.99 UK)\n\nPublication date: 18 January 2001\n\nAlthough he was once a fairly prolific writer of short fiction, William Tenn has only written this one full-length SF novel (1968). Shame, that. \"Giant, technologically superior aliens have conquered Earth, but humankind survives -- even flourishes in a way. Men and women live, like mice, in burrows in the massive walls of the huge homes of the aliens, and scurry about under their feet, stealing from them... For the aliens, men and women are just a nuisance, regarded as vermin, to be exterminated. Which, ironically, may just be humankind's strength and point the way forward...\"\n\nViktor Koen\n\nColonization: Aftershocks\n\nHarry Turtledove\n\nDel Rey (hardcover, 488 pages, $26 US/$40 Can)\n\nPublication date: 6 February 2001\n\nThird in his Colonization series, following Second Contact and Down to Earth, in which an alien race has attacked Earth in 1942. It is now the early 1960s and \"the alien invaders find themselves confronting a far more complex and difficult species than any they have encountered before. From the hatred between the Jews and the Deutsche to the irrepressible inventiveness of human technology, the reptilian invaders realize they have met creatures that cannot be tamed. Ultimately, only superior firepower may keep Earth under the Empire's control -- or may destroy the world... While uprisings and aftershocks of war shake the planet, and the Race's troops are undermined by ginger addiction, one nation plots a stunning counterattack.\""
