        "text": "In 1914 talk of marriage began to focus on Grand Duchess Olga, the daughter of Nicholas II and Alexandra of Russia.\n\nSerious discussion centered on Crown Prince Carol of Romania. Olga was opposed.\n\nSuppose the First World War did not occur.\n\nGrand Duchess Olga does marry.\n\nWho does she marry: the future Carol II or someone else?\n\nThe thing is Nicholas and Alexandra had to really marry Olga off before they could mary off the younger ones and Olga was quite firm, she would not leave Russia. Nicholas didn't really have the balls to force her, which means that it would be Alexandra who had to do it, if she was so inclined and she found Olga to be very difficult, probably because they had similar personalities.\n\nTatiana and Maria were both much easier personalities and prettier than Olga was and would have probably fared much better on the European marriage market. Lord Mountbatten was said to have kept a photograph of Maria by his bedside for his entire life, a reminder of his first love. Whether it was ever reciprocated is not known. It is quite interesting to wonder though how Lord Mountbatten would have fared if he relocated and lived his life and career in Imperial Russia.\n\nTatiana's problem was that she was effectively her mother's nurse/closest companion. Assuming Alexandra's health didn't decline as badly and quickly if the monarchy had not collapsed, it has long been said that Alexander of Serbia was desperate to marry her and an alliance with Serbia, was a huge political asset for Russia. Whether Alexandra could have ever tolerated losing Tatiana is highly questionable though.\n\nMy guess is that the best bet is that Olga effectively smells the coffee quite early and starts to plan her marriage to either a Russian Grand Duke or a minor German prince, prepared to relocate to Russia, which was quite common, her aunt and namesake, Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna had just a marriage, even if it was a disaster.\n\nShe might have even fell under some pressure from Tatiana and Maria to hurry up and marry, if her stalling was effectively slowing down their chances of securing her husband.\n\nThe thing is Nicholas and Alexandra had to really marry Olga off before they could mary off the younger ones and Olga was quite firm, she would not leave Russia.

Alix liked having her daughters around and its a sure thing at least one of them would be around her (married or not) full-time. The best bet is for Tatiana to marry before Olga since of all the daughters she seemed more likely for a big royal match and would have put duty ahead of her own feelings.\n\nPush comes to shove N&A are not going to force the daughters to marry.

The best bet is for Tatiana to marry before Olga since of all the daughters she seemed more likely for a big royal match and would have put duty ahead of her own feelings.\n\nThe general social convention of the time was that the eldest daughter married first, then the second, then the third etc. It was unusual to change the natural rhythm, although it did happen and usually signified that the daughter who didn't marry before her younger sister was not inclined to marry at all.\n\nIt would have been embarrassing for Olga to attend her younger sister's wedding as a spinster, especially in a court full of intrigue and gossip. If Tatiana married before Olga it would have sparked surprise and speculation as to what was wrong with Olga.\n\nI also struggle to believe that Tatiana could marry before Olga, in part because of this social convention and because I don't think Alexandra could have risked losing Tatiana. She was not only Alexandra's carer but was also very involved with the care of Alexei. Alexandra would have worked to delay Tatiana's marriage, therefore Olga's failure to marry, would give Alexandra an excuse, saying Tatitana couldn't possibly marry until Olga did.\n\nBased on their letters and other documents attributed to them, all of the Grand Duchesses indicated a wish to marry and have children.\n\nNot mentioned so far is that Russia is heading to a major succession crises and we have no idea what Nicholas intended to do. Alexis was a minor and his chances of having children were near zero. Michael had contracted a politically unwise marriage and had been effectively shut out.\n\nThat would mean Vladimir's line would get the throne unless Nicholas changed the statute to allow succession by either a woman or through her line (meaning either his sisters or daughters)\n\nInterestingly enough, Olga is the only one in the family he normally talked politics with. Even if her considered her only as a possible regent for Alexis, it would complicate her marriage immensely\n\nI disagree that Alexander's chances were near zero. Didn't he have a relative with a similar affliction who made it to 30 and had a couple (healthy) children? I don't disagree that the odds were against him, but 'near zero' is hyperbole.\n\nI disagree that Alexander's chances were near zero.

I don't disagree that the odds were against him, but 'near zero' is hyperbole.\n\nQueen Victoria's son, Leopold, Duke of Albany had two children before his death at age 31. The present Duke of Saxe-Coburg is his descendant. He was Alix's uncle. I'm sure both N&A thought if they were careful they could keep Alexei alive to adulthood to have children.\n\nHowever...Nicholas had toyed with changing the House Laws (made by one Tsar, Paul, and could be undone by another) to make Olga his heir prior to Alexei's birth and I've seen reports that Olga was indeed one of the Regents for Alexei in case anything happened. One of the reasons for the rumored pairing with her cousin GD Dmitri Pavlovich (the one involved with the Rasputin killing) was to provide a ready-made royal couple as heirs in case anything happened to Alexei.\n\nI think if the monarchy survives or even if the family make it out of Russia in exile, Nicholas would change the succession laws. He abdicated in favor of GD Michael (which many considered illegal since he abdicated for Alexei as well) only when he was pushed to extremity and Michael's only child, George, Count Brassov, was not elgible for the throne which would have meant the Vladimirovitch line would eventually become the heirs and there is NO WAY I see Nicholas or Alexandra or even the Dowager Empress agreeing to that ever happening.\n\nAs for Olga marrying outside of Russia. I don't see that happening. She didn't want it and her parents were never going to push it.\n\nQueen Victoria's son, Leopold, Duke of Albany had two children before his death at age 31.

I think the most likely candidate was Olga of Greece, eldest daughter of Prince Nicholas of Greece. There were huge advantages to this marriage, she was Orthodox but more importantly she was the granddaughter of Grand Duke Vladimir, her mother being Grand Duchess Elena, Vladimir's only daughter.\n\nNicholas may have dreamed of his daughter Olga succeeding him if Alexei died but even he knew that it was a wild pipe dream, the Vladimir branch would not have stood for it and neither would other key figures in the dynasty, who would not have believed that a woman could rule Russia of that time. This was after all a time when everyone, even Alexandra, kept castigating Nicholas for being too weak, for not being brutal enough and not killing enough people to show his strength.\n\nNicholas knew that the Vladimir branch were always a threat to his sickly son, therefore by marrying Alexei to one of the Vladimir branch, it gave them an investment in Alexei becoming Tsar and hopefully the father of healthy sons by Olga.\n\nOlga ended up marrying Prince Paul of Serbia and had 2 sons and a daughter. She was a very beautiful and glamarous woman and would have been a far superior Tsarina than Alexandra Feodrovna was, she was more in the style of Maria Feodrovna."
