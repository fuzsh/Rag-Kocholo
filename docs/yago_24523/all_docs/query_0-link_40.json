Born in Denmark during World War II, but she knows what emigration means: in 1948 she was forced to emigrate to Canada with her family, which included grandmother - the Grand Duchess Olga. They fled from the \"Soviet terror\" (as they say in the family) and again headlong - like in the Civil when Grand Duchess Olga and her husband Nicholas Kulikovsky with two kids miraculously escaped from the clutches of war in Kuban."
