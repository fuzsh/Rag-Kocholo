        "text": "TORONTO HISTORY\n\nIn a small two-bedroom apartment over a beauty salon in Toronto’s east end, the last Grand Duchess of Russia lived out her final days. But how she ended up there is a fascinating story of European royal history, revolution, deception, and eternal love.\n\nI have lived in Toronto for 35 years and worked in the local news media for almost that long. But for some reason, I missed this tidbit of historical trivia.\n\nA friend recently told me that he just learned that Russia’s last Grand Duchess was buried at York Cemetery. I know the cemetery well and have taken many walks there. I love wandering through a cemetery where figures from local history have been laid to rest. Sometimes a grave marker will catch my eye but I don’t read every headstone so it’s not too surprising I hadn’t stumbled across this one. But this little bit of information got me interested. And the more I researched and learned about this woman, the more fascinated I became."
