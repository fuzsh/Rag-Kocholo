        "text": "Our exhibition, Russia, Royalty & the Romanovs explores the relationships between Britain and Russia and their royal families including the marriage of Queen Victoria’s son to the daughter of the Russian Emperor.\n\nMany of the rich and varied works of art on display are unique – some commissioned as grand diplomatic gifts, others as intimate personal mementos between the royal family and the Romanovs, and they bring to life the shared patronage of artists and craftsmen from both countries.\n\nPrince Alfred and Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna’s engagement\n\nPrince Alfred, Queen Victoria’s second son, became engaged to Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna, daughter of Russian Emperor Alexander II on 11 July 1873. His mother had misgivings about the match, which she wrote about in her diary:\n\nFelt quite bewildered. Not knowing Marie & realizing that there may still be many difficulties, my thoughts & feelings are rather mixed, but I said from my heart \"God bless them\", & I hope and pray it may turn out for Affie's happiness.\n\nQueen Victoria's Journal, 11 July 1873\n\nThe Wedding\n\nA few days before the wedding, on 18 January, the Queen wrote about this painting she received of her future daughter-in-law.\n\nChevalier's finished painting illustrates the bridal couple bathed in winter light as the snow settles at the window of the Cathedral.\n\nWedding outfits\n\nChevalier recorded the elaborate costumes of the wedding party in a series of preparatory sketches for the oil painting. The Grand Duchess, who became the Duchess of Edinburgh, wore a silver and gem-set sarafan, a traditional dress worn by all Russian imperial brides for their wedding, paired with the traditional kokoshnik headdress.\n\nQueen Victoria's lady-in-waiting Lady Augusta Stanley wrote in a letter to the Queen that the Duchess's head 'must have ached with the immense weight of jewels, the necklace of diamonds….the most beautiful I ever saw'.\n\nThe Duchess's sister-in-law Tsesarevna Maria Feodorovna wore 'a gown of gold-embroidered satin and train of sky-blue velvet'."
