As a child, Christmases saw her showered with hundreds of presents that had taken armies of servants to wrap and prepare. One of her wedding gifts after her 1901 marriage was a 200-room house.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nThe Romanov the Bolsheviks forgot to kill: How Russia's last royal lived a quiet Canadian exile Back to video\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nShe met Grigori Rasputin, came under Austrian shellfire during the First World War and escaped a Bolshevik firing squad due to a clerical error. At the time of her death, she would be the last living link to what had been one of the most powerful dynasties in history.\n\nBut to her neighbours in what is now Mississauga, she was just “Olga,” an old immigrant grandmother known to wear gumboots who just happened to have an eye-popping jewellery collection.\n\nOlga was the daughter and sister of a Tsar. Her father, Tsar Alexander III, was dead by the time she was 12, causing her oldest brother “Nicky” to assume the throne.\n\nOlga would later reflect that her sensitive brother was “unfit” to suddenly take charge of the world’s largest land empire. “Even at that time I felt instinctively that sensitivity and kindness on their own were not enough for a sovereign to have,” she said in her 1965 biography.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhile Olga’s mother had long groomed her for the stifling, hoop-skirted life of a Russian blue-blood, the duchess had always craved a simple rural life (albeit one enhanced by thousands of servants and bottomless wealth).\n\nWhen Olga turned 19, a surprise marriage proposal by an older distant cousin, Duke Peter Alexandrovich, seemed to offer an escape. But the marriage was a sham. Alexandrovich — believed to be a closeted gay man pushed into the marriage by his own ambitious mother — spent their wedding night pulling an all-nighter at a gambling den.\n\nTheir union was never consummated, so Olga took up instead with a cavalry officer named Nikolai Kulikovsky. Her husband sportingly named Kulikovsky his aide-de-camp and allowed the young man a room in the massive family home.\n\nOlga came of age in a Russia increasingly wracked by assassinations and civil unrest. In 1905, she was hit with shattered glass as revolutionaries fired on the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg.\n\nWhen a charismatic Russian holy man named Rasputin inserted himself into the Tsar’s inner circle, Olga said she was completely immune to his charms, saying he was “neither as impressive nor as exciting as people think.”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhen the First World War began, the pampered Duchess followed a regiment named after her to the front lines, and was soon working 15-hour days in a hospital that was occasionally subject to Austrian fire.\n\nGrand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna, as a Red Cross nurse during the First World War\n\nPosted by Paul Gilbert on Monday, August 2, 2021\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOlga was still nursing when the 1917 revolution forced her brother from power — although, just before Nicholas II’s abdication, he granted Olga an annulment in order to marry Kulikovsky. The newlyweds soon fled to Crimea with Olga’s mother and sister, and it was while under Bolshevik house arrest that Olga gave birth to her first son.\n\nWhile Nicholas II and his family would be gunned down in the basement of a home in Yekaterinburg in 1918, Olga was saved by an early hiccup in communist bureaucracy. The Yalta and Sevastopol Soviets bickered over whose responsibility Olga was, and before they could resolve their dispute they were kicked out of Crimea by the invading Imperial German army, who in turn surrendered the port to White Russian loyalists.\n\nOlga and Nikolai tried to ride out the Russian Civil War in the Caucasus, but when Bolshevik victory became inevitable, they fled to Denmark, eventually settling at a modest farm that became a tourist destination for Russian monarchists.\n\nIt was there that Olga’s exile would have continued if not for Soviet victory in the Second World War, which left the Red Army decamped all along the Danish border — threatening to ensnare Olga’s family in the waves of figures being “disappeared” by Moscow’s post-war solidification of power in Eastern Europe. And so in 1948, at the age of 66, the Grand Duchess and her family packed aboard a troopship and joined the thousands of other “displaced persons” setting sail for Canada.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBy selling off Olga’s Romanov jewels her maid smuggled out of Russia, the couple purchased a 200-acre farm in Campbellville, Ont., and took an immediate liking to the country, with the former Grand Duchess saying, “the vast open spaces remind me of Russia and gave me a feeling of comfort.”\n\nNikolai worked the farm, their son Tikhon launched a career with the Ontario Highways Department, and Olga tended the chickens and took up painting. While they lived modestly, she was able to use her famous name to have her work exhibited at Eaton’s College Street in Toronto.\n\nWhile Olga never hurt for cash — she left her inheritors about $200,000 in stocks and bonds — she lived frugally and harboured no illusions about a dramatic return to power. Posthumous biographer Patricia Phenix told the Toronto Star that she let neighbourhood children play with her Faberge jewellery.\n\nShe also dutifully fielded up to 30 letters a day from admirers, royalty, old members of her regiment — and an endless succession of would-be scammers.\n\nThe bodies of the murdered family of Tsar Nicholas II wouldn’t be identified for decades, leaving grifters and the deluded to claim they were missing nieces and nephews. “The American continent,” Olga noted, “was particularly suited to producing (imposters).” One woman travelled from Illinois to insist she could recognize Olga based on her upper lip, a Frenchman said trauma had made him forget how to speak Russian, and a Spanish woman wrote a long letter insisting she was the real Olga. The legal action the imposter threatened never materialized.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOlga’s memoirs would call her Canadian farm days some of the happiest of her life. She took long walks where she recognized flowers from her Russian youth, and the long, cold winters were nostalgic to her. But by 1952 the farm had become too much work for the aging couple, so they settled into a suburban home in Cooksville, Ont., now part of Mississauga.\n\nAfter Nikolai’s death in 1958, and with her own health deteriorating, in 1960 Olga moved into a small apartment above a beauty salon on Toronto’s Gerrard Street to be cared for by a Russian emigrant couple she had befriended. It was where, on Nov. 24, Olga died as Russia’s last Grand Duchess, with about $50 worth of clothing in her closet. She was buried next to her husband in Toronto’s York Cemetery and, while the Soviet embassy didn’t send any official representatives, her funeral was a chance for Canada’s exiled Russian monarchists to show the flag.\n\nOnly once during her Canadian exile would Olga get a brief taste of the life that could have been. In June 1959, Queen Elizabeth II was on a royal tour to Canada and decided to call on her distant cousin for a meal. The frail Grand Duchess, who had only a few more months to live, had to be convinced by her neighbours to buy a new frock for the occasion (Olga thought she was “far too old to start buying new clothes”) and she was feted at the head table aboard the 126-metre-long royal yacht Britannia.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOlga’s memoirs sometimes reveal a self-important view of the monarchy’s place in Russian history, but she successfully predicted that communism would suffer a slow disintegration rather than a military defeat. “The Kremlin,” she said, “will not find it easy to satisfy an enlightened nation with nothing but a series of hollow slogans, spectacular nuclear successes, and grandiose demonstrations in Red Square.”\n\nOlga’s line survives today. Her great-grandson Paul Edward Kulikovsky maintains a Romanov Facebook page full of artwork and trivia, and he hopes to use royal history to restore old-fashioned moral values. Modern Russian monarchists have accused him of exaggerating his importance within the bloodline, and he sometimes drifts into historical revisionism or potshots at other fringe Romanovs.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMost of Olga’s descendants share her dismissive view of restoration. Her grandson Leonid Kulikovsky, who briefly served in the Canadian Army but eventually made his way to Australia to live a happy life as a manual labourer, was so indifferent to his famous ancestry that it took two months after his 2015 death for officials to make the connection.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nIn 1971, a Canadian rode the Soviet premier like a horse and only spent two months in jail\n\nThe Canadian who would be king: What it's like to be the great-great-great grandson of Queen Victoria\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.
