Her thick dark hair is pinned up, and she wears a rope of pearls around her neck. Spouse Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg m. 1901; ann. 1916 Nikolai Kulikovsky m. 1916; dec. 1958 Issue Tikhon Nikolaevich (1917–1993) Guri Nikolaevich (1919–1984) House House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov Father Alexander III of Russia Mother Empress Marie Feodorovna Born 13 June 1882 Peterhof Palace, Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire Died 24 November 1960 (aged 78) Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nGrand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia (Russian: О́льга Алекса́ндровна; 13 June [O.S. 1 June] 1882 – 24 November 1960) was the youngest child of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and younger sister of Tsar Nicholas II.\n\nShe was raised at the Gatchina Palace outside Saint Petersburg. Olga's relationship with her mother, Empress Marie, the daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark, was strained and distant from childhood. In contrast, she and her father were close. He died when she was 12, and her brother Nicholas became emperor.\n\nIn 1901, she married Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, who was privately believed by family and friends to be homosexual. Their marriage of 15 years remained unconsummated, and Peter at first refused Olga's request for a divorce. The couple led separate lives and their marriage was eventually annulled by the Emperor in October 1916. The following month Olga married cavalry officer Nikolai Kulikovsky, with whom she had fallen in love several years before. During the First World War, the Grand Duchess served as an army nurse at the front and was awarded a medal for personal gallantry. At the downfall of the Romanovs in the Russian Revolution of 1917, she fled to the Crimea with her husband and children, where they lived under the threat of assassination. Her brother and his family were shot by revolutionaries.\n\nOlga escaped revolutionary Russia with her second husband and their two sons in February 1920. They joined her mother, the Dowager Empress, in Denmark. In exile, Olga acted as companion and secretary to her mother, and was often sought out by Romanov impostors who claimed to be her dead relatives. She met Anna Anderson, the best-known impostor, in Berlin in 1925. After the Dowager Empress's death in 1928, Olga and her husband purchased a dairy farm in Ballerup, near Copenhagen. She led a simple life: raising her two sons, working on the farm and painting. During her lifetime, she painted over 2,000 works of art, which provided extra income for both her family and the charitable causes she supported.\n\nIn 1948, feeling threatened by Joseph Stalin's regime, Olga emigrated with her immediate family to a farm in Ontario, Canada. With advancing age, Olga and her husband moved to a bungalow near Cooksville, Ontario. Colonel Kulikovsky died there in 1958. Two years later, as her health deteriorated, Olga moved with devoted friends to a small apartment in East Toronto. She died aged 78, seven months after her older sister, Xenia. At the end of her life and afterwards, Olga was widely labeled the last Grand Duchess of Imperial Russia.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n\n2 Court life\n\n3 War and revolution\n\n4 Anna Anderson\n\n5 Danish residency and exodus\n\n6 Emigration to Canada\n\n7 Legacy\n\n7.1 Ancestry\n\n8 Notes and sources\n\n9 References\n\n10 External links\n\nEarly life Black-and-white photograph of the Romanov family. Olga is a young girl who stands at the front resting against the arms of her seated bearded and bald father, who wears a military uniform. The older children and the empress complete the group.\n\nOlga was the youngest daughter of Tsar Alexander III and his consort, Marie Feodorovna, formerly Princess Dagmar of Denmark. She was born in the purple, i.e. during her father's reign, on 13 June 1882 in the Peterhof Palace, west of Saint Petersburg. Her birth was announced by a traditional 101-gun salute from the ramparts of the Peter and Paul Fortress, and similar salutes throughout the Russian Empire.[1] Her mother, advised by her sister, Alexandra, Princess of Wales, placed Olga in the care of an English nanny, Elizabeth Franklin.[1]\n\nThe Russian imperial family was a frequent target for assassins, so for safety reasons the Grand Duchess was raised at the country palace of Gatchina, about 50 miles (80 km) west of Saint Petersburg. Olga and her siblings, however, were not accustomed to a lavish early lifestyle. Conditions in the nursery were modest, even Spartan.[2] They slept on hard camp beds, rose at dawn, washed in cold water, and ate a simple porridge for breakfast.[2]\n\nOlga left Gatchina for the first time in the early fall of 1888 when the imperial family visited the Caucasus. On 29 October, their return train approached the small town of Borki at speed. Olga's parents and their four older children were eating lunch in the dining-car when the train lurched violently and came off the rails. The carriage was torn open; the heavy iron roof caved in, and the wheels and floor of the car were sliced off. The Tsar crawled out from beneath the crushed roof, and held it up with \"a Herculean effort\" so that the others could escape.[3] There were 21 fatalities. Empress Marie helped tend the wounded, and made makeshift bandages from her own clothes.[4] An official investigation found that the crash was an accident,[5] but it was widely assumed that two bombs had been planted on the line.[4]\n\nThe Grand Duchess and her siblings were taught at home by private tutors. Subjects included history, geography, Russian, English and French, as well as drawing and dancing.[6] Physical activities such as equestrianism were taught at an early age, and they became expert riders.[7] The family was deeply religious. Although Christmas and Easter were times of celebration and extravagance, Lent was strictly observed—meat, dairy products and any form of entertainment were avoided.[8] Family holidays were taken in the summer at Peterhof and with Olga's grandparents in Denmark.[9] Oil painting of Olga as a girl\n\nEmpress Marie was reserved and formal with Olga as a child, and their relationship remained a difficult one.[10] However, Olga, her father, and the youngest of her brothers, Michael, had a close relationship. Together, the three frequently went on hikes within the Gatchina forests, where the Tsar taught Olga and Michael woodsmanship.[11] Olga said of her father:\n\nMy father was everything to me. Immersed in work as he was, he always spared that daily half-hour. ... once my father showed me a very old album full of most exciting pen and ink sketches of an imaginary city called Mopsopolis, inhabited by Mopses [pug dogs]. He showed it to me in secret, and I was thrilled to have him share his own childhood secrets with me.[12]\n\nDuring 1894 Olga's father became increasingly ill, and the annual trip to Denmark was cancelled.[13] On 13 November 1894, he died at the age of 49. The emotional impact on Olga, aged only 12, was traumatic,[14] and her eldest brother, the new Tsar Nicholas II, was propelled into a role for which in Olga's later opinion he was ill-prepared.[15] Court life\n\nOlga was due to enter society in the summer of 1899, but after the death of her brother George at the age of 27, her first official public appearance was delayed by a year until 1900.[16] She hated the experience, and later told her official biographer Ian Vorres, \"I felt as though I were an animal in a cage—exhibited to the public for the first time.\"[17] From 1901, Olga was appointed honorary Commander-in-Chief of the 12th Akhtyrsky Hussar Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army. The Akhtyrsky Hussars were famous for their victory over Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Kulm in 1813, and wore a distinctive brown dolman.[18]\n\nBy 1900 Olga, age 18, was being escorted to the theatre and opera by a distant cousin, Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, a member of the Russian branch of the House of Oldenburg.[19] He was 14 years her senior and known for his passion for literature and gambling.[20] Peter asked for Olga's hand in marriage the following year, a proposal that took the Grand Duchess completely by surprise: \"I was so taken aback that all I could say was 'thank you',\" she later explained.[21]\n\nTheir engagement, announced in May 1901, was unexpected by family and friends, as Peter had shown no prior interest in women,[17] and members of society assumed he was homosexual.[22] At the age of 19, on 9 August 1901, Olga married 33-year-old Peter. After the celebration the newlyweds left for the Oldenburg palace on the Field of Mars. Olga spent her wedding night alone in tears, while her husband left for a gambling club returning the next morning.[23] Their marriage remained unconsummated,[24] and Olga suspected that Peter was pushed into proposing by his ambitious mother.[25] Biographer Patricia Phenix thought Olga may have accepted his proposal to gain independence from her own mother, the Dowager Empress, or avoid marriage into a foreign court.[26] The couple initially lived with her in laws Alexander Petrovich and Eugénie Maximilianovna of Oldenburg. It was not an harmonious arrangement as Peter's parents, both well known for their philanthropic work, berated their only son for his laziness.[23] Eugénie, a close friend of the Dowager Empress, showered her daughter-in-law with gifts including a ruby tiara that had been a present to Joséphine de Beauharnais from Napoleon, but Olga took a dislike towards her mother-in-law.[23] A few weeks after the wedding, Olga and her husband traveled to Biarritz, France, from where they sailed to Sorrento, Italy, on a yacht loaned to them by King Edward VII of Great Britain.[27]\n\nSources\n\n\"British Newspaper Archives, Obituaries,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:Q26M-92S5 : 26 October 2019), Olga Alexandrovina in entry for Emperor Alexander III Alexandrovitch, 03 Nov 1894; citing Obituary, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England, United Kingdom, page , Records extracted by FindMyPast and images digitized by FamilySearch.
