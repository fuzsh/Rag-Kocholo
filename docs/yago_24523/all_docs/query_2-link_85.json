        "text": "When Grand Duke George Mikhailovich Romanov married Victoria Bettarini in St. Petersburg on Oct. 1, their lavish nuptials marked a rather epic return to the world stage for the Romanov family, whose 304-year rule in Russia ended more than a century ago in a hail of state-sanctioned bullets.\n\nWhich begs the reminder, no matter how scandalous the behavior of the modern royal families of Britain, Spain, Sweden, Monaco, et al., nothing really compares to the millennia of bloody intrigue that once defined the reigns of so many monarchs across Europe and beyond. King Henry VIII alone had two wives executed because divorce wasn't an option. His daughter Queen Elizabeth I ordered the beheading of her perceived rival Mary, Queen of Scots because maybe Mary was plotting against her. Catherine the Great came to power and ruled Russia for a record (for a female leader, anyway) 34 years after her husband (and second cousin) Peter III was violently overthrown in a coup and promptly died-or-was-assassinated in captivity.\n\n\"No member of the Romanov family ever thought we would come back here,\" the 40-year-old groom told The New York Times in an email before the grand religious wedding (the bride, born Rebecca Virginia Bettarini, converted to Russian Orthodoxy and took the name Victoria Romanovna), which followed their official civil ceremony on Sept. 24.\n\nAnd the power struggle continues, George the disputed heir apparent to the headship of the Imperial Family of Russia, House Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov. (Not that, even when/if he becomes head of the family, he'd have any power in the country, where Vladimir Putin has been president for the better part of two decades. \"This marriage does not belong on our agenda in any way,\" a Putin spokesman told reporters before the wedding.)\n\nThe headship, meanwhile, is disputed due to the not-uncommon confusion over which man in the Romanov family tree had the right to jumpstart the line of succession after the last tsar of Russia was deposed in 1917. But we'll get to that.\n\nPeter II was the last male Romanov leader who could be traced directly back through the family's paternal lineage. When he died, his cousin Anna, daughter of Peter the Great's half-brother and former co-ruler Ivan V, became empress. There were other candidates, including her older sister, but Anna was chosen because she was a childless widow, therefore less prone to distraction and influence. (However, her 10-year reign was known derisively as the Age of Biron, after her alleged affair with the German Duke Ernst Johann von Biron, who supposedly wielded tremendous decision-making power behind the scenes.)\n\nEmpress Anna picked grand-nephew Ivan VI (grandson of her older sister Catherine Ivanovna) as her successor; but he was only 2-months-old when she died, so his mother, Anna Leopoldovna, reigned as regent empress for one year—after which she and her emperor baby were overthrown and locked up. (Ivan VI was killed in 1764 at the age of 23 by prison guards, having spent his whole life incarcerated. A delusional army officer showed up with a plan to bust him out and make him emperor, not knowing there were orders to kill \"Prisoner Number One\" should anyone try to get to him. The officer was later beheaded.)\n\nPeter the Great's second-eldest daughter Elizabeth Petrovna took the throne in 1741 and presided over an Age of Enlightenment in Russia—the last Romanov leader who could be tracked directly through the paternal line back to Michael I. She was very popular with the people, ironically—considering she became empress thanks to a coup—because she ordered no executions during her reign. She didn't marry or have children, so she designated nephew Peter III—the only child of her elder sister Anna Petrovna—as her successor.\n\nAnd just in case you thought conspiracy theories were a 20th-century concoction, the prevailing belief at the time was that Peter III was still alive and his wife was keeping him locked away somewhere. A series of revolts by peasants and various other disgruntled Russians were fought in his name, but Catherine's army crushed them all.\n\nCatherine the Great was succeeded by her son Paul I—for all intents and purposes her only child with Peter III, though her lover Sergei Saltykov was rumored to be the boy's actual father. Paul I hung on for five years before he was assassinated at the age of 49 (an inside job, as his aides considered him too pro-German), after which his son Alexander I (who may have known a plot was afoot) became emperor.\n\nBut into that tinderbox of discontent stepped his eldest son, Nicholas II, who became the last-ever tsar of Russia in 1894.\n\nOn a happier note, that same year he married German-born Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine, one of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom's 42 grandchildren. The future Empress Consort Alexandra Feodorovna was 12 when she met 16-year-old Nicholas II, a nephew of the groom, at her big sister Ella's wedding to Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich. When \"sweet little Alix,\" as the future tsar referred to her in his diary, visited her sister in Russia six years later, the the courtship began, enthusiastically championed by Ella and Sergei.\n\n\"It is my dream to one day marry Alix H,\" Nicholas II wrote in his diary. \"I have loved her for a long time, but more deeply and strongly since 1889 when she spent six weeks in Petersburg. For a long time, I have resisted my feeling that my dearest dream will come true.\"\n\nQueen Victoria liked her granddaughter's future husband as a person but didn't approve of the match, writing in a letter after they got engaged, \"The more I think of sweet Alicky's marriage the more unhappy I am. Not as to the personality for I like him very much but on account of the country and the awful insecurity to which that poor child will be exposed.\"\n\nBooks upon books have been written about the political turmoil of that time in Russia alone, let alone the rest of Europe, and through it all Nicholas II committed the fatal move of wanting to hang onto the old ways—a.k.a. autocratic rule—and not reading the temperature of the room. Which was soon blazing as World War I began in 1914.\n\nWildly unpopular, Nicholas II abdicated in March 1917, drawing up a plan of succession to have brother Grand Duke Michael become the next emperor. But the provisional government, formed as a compromise by the Duma, who wanted to keep the status quo, and the Marxists of the Petrograd Soviets, who wanted to install a republic, refused to implement it. After spending a few days as Emperor Michael II, Misha (as he was familiarly known) signed his own abdication papers, stating that he'd only assume the position if the people decided at the ballot box that the monarchy should continue.\n\nAnd that was that for the 304-year reign of the Romanovs and the Russian crown.\n\nA funeral attended by then-Russian president Boris Yeltsin—he called it \"a historic day for Russia\"—and 30 Romanov descendants was held on July 17, 1998, the 80th anniversary of the assassination, and the remains were permanently interred at the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg.\n\n\"We have long been silent about this monstrous crime,\" Yeltsin said. \"The Ekaterinburg massacre has become one of the most shameful episodes in our history. We want to atone for the sins of our ancestors. We are all guilty.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Many glorious pages of Russian history are connected with the Romanovs. But this name is connected to one of the most bitter lessons.\"\n\nIn 2000, Nicholas II and his family were canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church as \"passion-bearers,\" saints who were not killed because of their faith, like martyrs, but who were practitioners of faith when they were murdered.\n\nThe bride and groom exchanged Fabergé rings and Victoria wore a tiara by the French jeweler Chaumet, while a nod to her storied in-laws came in the form of an Imperial eagle embroidered onto her veil.\n\nRoughly 1,500 people attended the ceremony at historic Saint Isaac's Cathedral. It's unclear how many cousins were present, but royalty including Princess Léa of Belgium, Queen Sofia of Spain, Prince Rudolph and Princess Tilsim of Liechtenstein, and former Bulgarian Tsar Simeon II made the trip.\n\n\"It is very, very close to our family,\" George told Russian news site Fontanka of Saint Petersburg—which was founded by Peter the Great. The city is \"the history of Russia,\" he added, \"the history of the House of Romanov.\"\n\nOr as a passerby told Agence France-Presse in the days before the wedding, \"For us the monarchy is something from a past life, of course, but it's interesting.\""
