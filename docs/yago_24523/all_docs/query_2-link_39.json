In this important letter written six weeks after leaving, \"little by little we are adjusting to life here - so different from our life in the Kuban….we cannot move to Hvidore because there are no fireplaces\" (the house jointly owned by her mother the Dowager Empress of Russia and her sister Queen Alexandra). \"I saw a lady who has just escaped from Petersburg by marrying an English teacher (Bolshevik marriage) to have the permission to leave\". She refers to strikes in Denmark, \"We are expecting Xenia one of these days from London. What a joy to see her after 1½ years\". Her sister Grand Duchess Xenia had arrived in England via Malta from the Crimea aboard H.M.S. Marlborough, despatched by King George V to rescue members of the Imperial Family. \"What happiness that Mother has her little house in Hvidore, where she feels like she is at home. It is all she has left, the only house she has\".\n\nThe Dowager Empress was amongst those who left Russia aboard H.M.S. Marlborough.
