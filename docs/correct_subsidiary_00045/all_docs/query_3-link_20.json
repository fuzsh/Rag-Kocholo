He has published more than 65 peer-reviewed articles and has been invited to write major review articles and to deliver presentations in numerous national and international conferences.\n\nDr. Gordon Vehar PhD, VP of Research, Raven Biotechnologies, SSF, CA, USA\n\nDr. Vehar received his PhD from the University of Cincinnati Medical School and did his postdoctoral work with Dr. Earl Davie at the University of Washington, Seattle. He joined Genentech, Inc. in 1980. During his 20 years at Genentech, Dr. Vehar served various leadership functions, including Director, Cardiovascular Research, and project team leader for the Factor VIII (Kogenate, tPA (Activase, TNKase (TNKase, and Lymphotoxin Projects, as well as Staff Scientist in the Cardiovascular Research and Protein Chemistry Departments. Dr. Vehar is co-inventor on 36 issued U.S. patents and has authored more than 35 scientific publications.\n\nHe has been awarded the Murray Thelin Award for Outstanding Research (1987) presented by the National Hemophilia Foundation, the Inventor of the Year Award from the Intellectual Property Owners, Inc. (1989) for the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator patent and the Distinguished Inventor of the Year Award from the Intellectual Property Owners, Inc (1999) for the recombinant factor VIII patent. He served on the Scientific Advisory Board for the Oklahoma Center for Molecular Medicine (1992-1996). Dr. Vehar joined Raven Biotechnologies in 2000, as Vice President, Research and Development. Raven Biotechnologies utilizes tissue specific progenitor cells and high throughput antibody production/screening to identify, validate, and develop tumor specific monoclonal antibody therapeutics.\n\nDr. Choong-Chin Liew PhD, CSO, GeneNews, Toronto, Canada\n\nDr. Choong-Chin CC Liew is co-founder and Chief Scientist of GeneNews Corporation, Toronto, Ontario and Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto, He was formerly Visiting Professor of Medicine and Founding Director of the Cardiovascular Genome Center at the Brigham and Womens Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston.\n\nDr. Liew is a pioneer in the emerging field of molecular medicine and globally recognized as a leader in disease-specific genomics research. To date, he has published over 300 original scientific papers, abstracts, and monographs. His 1997 landmark publication in Circulation, a pre-eminent U.S. peer reviewed journal, reported his work in cardiovascular genomics. This report is widely acknowledged to represent the most comprehensive analysis of genes expressed in a single human organ. Currently Dr. Liew is working to develop the Sentinel PrincipleTM, a blood-based diagnostic technology that will identify molecular signatures for major human diseases."
