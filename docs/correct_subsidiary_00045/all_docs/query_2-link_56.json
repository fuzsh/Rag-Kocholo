As a result, we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will materialize and, accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements;\n\n•\n\nforward-looking statements do not take into account the effect that transactions or non-recurring or other special items announced or occurring after the statements are made may have on our business. For example, they do not include the effect of mergers, acquisitions, other business combinations or transactions, dispositions, sales of assets, asset write-downs or other charges announced or occurring after the forward-looking statements are made. The financial impact of such transactions and non-recurring and other special items can be complex and necessarily depends on the facts particular to each of them. Accordingly, the expected impact cannot be meaningfully described in the abstract or presented in the same manner as known risks affecting our business;\n\n•\n\nThe secondary endpoint of PR (50% reduction in UPCR over baseline with no administration of rescue medication throughout the treatment period) was met for both voclosporin groups in the ITT analysis with 69.7% of patients on low dose achieving PR (p=0.007) and 65.9% in the high dose group (p=0.024). 49.4% of patients in the control arm achieved PR.\n\n•\n\nThere were 13 deaths across the trial: two in the high-dose voclosporin arm; 10 in the low-dose voclosporin arm; and one in the control arm, with the majority of overall deaths (11/13) occurring in Asia. All deaths were assessed by the study investigator as being unrelated to study treatment.\n\n3.\n\nPhase 2 Clinical Trials - These trials are conducted in the intended patient population and include a larger number of subjects than in Phase 1. The primary goal is to determine the safety of a product in a larger number of patients and ultimately in the intended patient population. These trials may also provide early information on the potential effectiveness of a product.\n\n(a)\n\nwas subject to a cease trade order, an order similar to a cease trade order or an order that denied the relevant company access to any exemption under securities legislation, that was issued while the proposed director was acting in the capacity as a director, chief executive officer or chief financial officer; or\n\n(b)\n\nwas subject to a cease trade order, an order similar to a cease trade order or an order that denied the relevant company access to any exemption under securities legislation, that was issued after the director or executive officer ceased to be a director, chief executive officer or chief financial officer and which resulted from an event that occurred while he was acting in the capacity of a director, chief executive officer or chief financial officer.\n\n(a)\n\nis, or has been within 10 years before the date of this AIF, a director, chief executive officer or chief financial officer of any company, including Aurinia, that while that person was acting in that capacity, or within a year of that person ceasing to act in that capacity, became bankrupt, made a proposal under any legislation relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, or was subject to or instituted any proceedings, arrangement or compromise with creditors, or had a receiver, receiver manager or trustee appointed to hold its assets; or\n\n(b)\n\nhas, within 10 years before the date of this AIF, become bankrupt, made a proposal under any legislation relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, or become subject to or instituted any proceedings, arrangement or compromise with creditors, or had a receiver, receiver manager or trustee appointed to hold the assets of the director, chief executive officer or chief financial officer.\n\n1.\n\nUnder the terms of an agreement dated February 14, 2014 between the Company and Dr. Robert Foster, whereby Dr. Robert Foster’s employment as CSO was terminated by the Company, it was confirmed that effective March 8, 2012, Dr. Foster was entitled to receive 2% of royalty licensing revenue for royalties received on the sale of voclosporin by licensees and/or 0.3% of net sales of voclosporin sold directly by the Company, to be paid quarterly as that revenue is received by the Company. Should the Company sell substantially all of the assets of voclosporin to a third party or transfer those assets to another party in a merger in a manner such that this payment obligation is no longer operative, then Dr. Foster will be entitled to receive 0.3% of the value attributable to voclosporin in the transaction.\n\n(1)\n\nThese fees include professional services provided by the external auditor for the statutory audits of the annual financial statements.
