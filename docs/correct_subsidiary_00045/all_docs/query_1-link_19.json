Each Warrant will be immediately exercisable and will expire five years from the date on which such Warrants become exercisable . The shares of common stock and Warrants that form part of a Class A Unit are immediately separable and will be issued separately in this offering.\n\nWe are also offering to those purchasers, if any, whose purchase of Class A Units in this offering would otherwise result in the purchaser, together with its affiliates and certain related parties, beneficially owning more than 4.99% of our outstanding common stock immediately following the consummation of this offering, the opportunity, in lieu of purchasing Class A Units, to purchase Class B Units. Each Class B Unit will consist of one share of our Series A convertible preferred stock, with a stated value of $1,000 per share and convertible into shares of our common stock at the public offering price of the Class A Units, together with the equivalent number of Warrants as would have been issued to such purchaser if they had purchased Class A Units based on the public offering price. The shares of Series A convertible preferred stock do not generally have any voting rights but are convertible into shares of common stock. The shares of Series A convertible preferred stock and Warrants are immediately separable and will be issued separately in this offering. We are also offering the shares of common stock that are issuable from time to time upon conversion of the Series A convertible preferred stock and upon the exercise of the Warrants being offered by this prospectus.\n\nFor a more detailed description of the Series A convertible preferred stock, see the section entitled “Description of Securities We Are Offering — Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.” For a more detailed description of the Warrants, see the section entitled “Description of Securities We Are Offering — Warrants to Purchase Common Stock.” For a more detailed description of our common stock, see the section entitled “Description of Capital Stock — Common Stock.”\n\nWe refer to the Series A convertible preferred stock issued hereunder, the Warrants and the shares of common stock issued hereunder and issuable upon conversion of the Series A convertible preferred stock and upon exercise of the Warrants, collectively, as the securities.\n\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “BLPH.” On November 8, 2016, the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market was $ 0.95 per share. We do not intend to list the Series A convertible preferred stock or the Warrants to be sold in this offering on The NASDAQ Global Market or any other national securities exchange or any other nationally recognized trading system .\n\nWe are an “emerging growth company” as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 and, as such, we have elected to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements for this prospectus and future filings.\n\nPer Class A\n\nUnit Per Class B\n\nUnit Total Public offering price(1) $ $ 1,000 $ Placement agent fees(2) $ $ Proceeds, before expenses, to us $ $\n\n(1)The public offering price is $ per unit .\n\n(2)In addition, we have agreed to (i) issue to the placement agent warrants to purchase up to 4.0 % of the shares of common stock sold in this offering (excluding any shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants ) and (ii) reimburse the placement agent for certain expenses.

We take no responsibility for, and can provide no assurance as to the reliability of, any other information that others may give you. This prospectus is an offer to sell only the shares offered hereby, and only under circumstances and in jurisdictions where it is lawful to do so. The information contained in this prospectus or in any applicable free writing prospectus is current only as of its date, regardless of its time of delivery or any sale of our securities.

Persons outside the United States who come into possession of this prospectus must inform themselves about, and observe any restrictions relating to, the offering of the securities and the distribution of this prospectus outside the United States.\n\nii\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, before deciding whether to purchase securities in this offering. All of these risk factors are incorporated herein in their entirety. The risks described below and incorporated by reference are material risks currently known, expected or reasonably foreseeable by us. If any of these risks actually materialize, our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations could be seriously harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock and the value of the warrants to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Related to this Offering\n\nYou will experience immediate and substantial dilution if you purchase securities in this offering.\n\nAs of September 30, 2016, our net tangible book value was approximately $ 18.0 million, or approximately $ 1.24 per share. If the price per share of our common stock being offered in this offering is higher than the net tangible book value per share of our common stock, you will suffer dilution with respect to the net tangible book value of the common stock you purchase in this offering. Based on the assumed combined public offering price of $ 0.95 per unit being sold in this offering, and our net tangible book value per share as of September 30, 2016, if you purchase shares of common stock in this offering, you will suffer immediate and substantial dilution of $( ) per share with respect to the net tangible book value of the common stock. See the section entitled “Dilution” for a more detailed discussion of the dilution you will incur if you purchase common stock in this offering.\n\nThere is no public market for the Series A convertible preferred stock or Warrants being offered in this offering.\n\nThere is no established public trading market for the Series A convertible preferred stock or the Warrants being offered in this offering, and we do not expect a market to develop. In addition, we do not intend to apply to list the Series A convertible preferred stock or Warrants on any securities exchange or nationally recognized trading system, including the NASDAQ Global Market. Without an active market, the liquidity of the Series A convertible preferred stock and the Warrants will be limited.\n\nWe will have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and may not use them effectively.\n\nOur management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from this offering, including for any of the purposes described in the section entitled “Use of Proceeds,” and you will not have the opportunity as part of your investment decision to assess whether the net proceeds are being used appropriately. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of the net proceeds from this offering, their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently intended use. Our management may not apply the net proceeds from this offering in ways that ultimately increase the value of your investment. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could harm our business. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our stockholders. If we do not invest or apply the net proceeds from this offering in ways that enhance stockholder value, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause our stock price to decline.\n\nThere may be future sales of our securities or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\nWe are generally not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of common stock or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock after this offering or the perception that such sales could occur.\n\nNeither the holders of Warrants purchased in this offering nor the purchasers of the Series A convertible preferred stock will have rights as common stockholders until such holders exercise their warrants and/or preferred stock and acquire our common stock.\n\nUntil holders of Warrants and/or purchasers of the Series A convertible preferred stock acquire shares of our common stock upon exercise of the Warrants and/or Series A convertible preferred stock, holders of Warrants and Series A convertible preferred stock will have no rights with respect to the shares of our common stock underlying such Warrants and/or Series A convertible preferred stock. Upon exercise of the Warrants and/or Series A convertible preferred stock, the holders will be entitled to exercise the rights of a common stockholder only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise date.\n\nEven if this offering is successful, we will need to raise additional capital in the future to continue operations, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.\n\nWe have had recurring losses from operations, negative operating cash flow and an accumulated deficit. We do not generate any cash from operations and must raise additional funds in order to continue operating our business. We expect to continue to fund our operations primarily through equity and debt financings in the future. If additional capital is not available to us when needed or on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue to operate our business pursuant to our business plan or we may have to discontinue our operations entirely. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $ 3.9 million. We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $ million from the sale of the securities offered by us in this offering, based on the assumed combined public offering price of $ 0.95 per unit (the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on November 8, 2016), and after deducting the estimated placement agent fees and expenses and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and excluding the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the warrants issued in this offering. We currently anticipate that our existing resources, together with the expected net proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to fund our planned operations until at least the end of . In the event of a decrease in the net proceeds to us from this offering as a result of a decrease in the assumed public offering price or the number of shares offered by us, based on the assumptions discussed in “Use of Proceeds”, we would expect that our existing resources, together with such reduced expected net proceeds from this offering, would be sufficient to fund our planned operations until approximately .\n\nDeveloping drugs and conducting clinical trials is expensive. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\n·the costs and timing of our research and development activities;\n\n·the progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n\n·the cost and timing of securing manufacturing capabilities for our clinical product candidates and commercial products, if any;\n\n·the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, acquisition or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\n·the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals;\n\n·the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent applications, claims, patents and other intellectual property rights; and\n\n·the costs of lawsuits involving us or our product candidates.\n\nWe may seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to the products candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently. We cannot be certain that we will be able to enter into any such arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all.\n\nWe may seek to raise capital through a variety of sources, including:\n\n·the public equity market;\n\n·private equity financings;\n\n·collaborative arrangements;\n\n·licensing arrangements; and/or\n\n·public or private debt.\n\nAny additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend, in part, on the success of our preclinical studies and clinical trials and other product development activities, regulatory events, our ability to identify and enter into in-licensing or other strategic arrangements, and other events or conditions that may affect our value or prospects, as well as factors related to financial, economic and market conditions, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that sufficient funds will be available to us when required or on acceptable terms, if at all. Raising additional capital through the sale of securities could cause significant dilution to our stockholders. If we are unable to secure additional funds on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we may be required to defer, reduce or eliminate significant planned expenditures, restructure, curtail or eliminate some or all of our development programs or other operations, dispose of technology or assets, pursue an acquisition of our company by a third party at a price that may result in a loss on investment for our stockholders, enter into arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our product candidates, technologies or potential markets, file for bankruptcy or cease operations altogether. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain additional funds on a timely basis, there will be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and increased risk of insolvency and loss of investment by our stockholders.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis prospectus and the documents incorporated by reference herein contain forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are contained principally in the sections entitled “Prospectus Summary,” “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business” in this prospectus or the documents incorporated herein by reference. These statements relate to future events or to our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about:\n\n·the timing of the ongoing and expected clinical trials of our product candidates, including statements regarding the timing of completion or analysis of the trials and the respective periods during which the results of the trials will become available;\n\n· our ability to obtain adequate financing to meet our future operational and capital needs;\n\n·the timing of and our ability to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates, and the ability of our product candidates to meet existing or future regulatory standards;\n\n·our ability to comply with government laws and regulations;\n\n·our commercialization, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and strategy;\n\n·our estimates regarding the potential market opportunity for our product candidates;\n\n·the timing of or our ability to enter into partnerships to market and commercialize our product candidates;\n\n·the rate and degree of market acceptance of any product candidate for which we receive marketing approval;\n\n·our intellectual property position;\n\n·our estimates regarding expenses, future revenues, capital requirements and needs for additional funding and our ability to obtain additional funding;\n\n·the success of competing treatments;\n\n·our competitive position; and\n\n·our expectations regarding the time during which we will be an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012.\n\nIn some cases, you can identify these statements by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “would” or the negative of those terms, and similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. These forward-looking statements reflect our management’s beliefs and views with respect to future events and are based on estimates and assumptions as of the date of this prospectus and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We discuss many of these risks in greater detail in the documents incorporated by reference herein, usually under the heading “Risk Factors.” Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.\n\nYou should carefully read this prospectus, the documents that we incorporate by reference into this\n\nprospectus and the documents we reference in this prospectus and have filed as exhibits to the registration statement, of which this prospectus is a part, completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of the forward-looking statements in this prospectus by these cautionary statements.\n\nExcept as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nUSE OF PROCEEDS\n\nWe estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $ million from the sale of the securities offered by us in this offering, based on the assumed combined public offering price of $ 0.95 per unit (the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market on November 8, 2016), and assuming for this purpose, a sale of only Class A units, and after deducting placement agent fees and expenses and estimated offering expenses payable by us and excluding the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the warrants issued pursuant to this offering and assuming we sell the maximum number of securities we are offering pursuant to the prospectus supplement.\n\nA $0.50 increase (decrease) in the assumed combined public offering price of $ 0.95 per unit would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately $ million, assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the estimated placement agent fees and expenses and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\n\nSimilarly, a one million share increase (decrease) in the number of units offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us by $ million, assuming the assumed combined public offering price of $ 0.95 per unit remains the same, and after deducting estimated placement agent fees and expenses and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\n\nWe currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including manufacturing expenses, clinical trial expenses, research and development expenses and general and administrative expense.\n\nOur expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot currently allocate specific percentages of the net proceeds that we may use for the purposes specified above, and we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering, or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous factors, including our ability to obtain additional financing, the progress, cost and results of our preclinical and clinical development programs, and whether we are able to enter into future licensing or collaboration arrangements. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds from this offering.\n\nPending the use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net proceeds in investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments.\n\nPRICE RANGE OF OUR COMMON STOCK\n\nOur common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Global Market since February 13, 2015 under the symbol “BLPH.” Prior to that date, there was no public market for our common stock. As a result, we have not set forth quarterly information with respect to the high and low sales prices for our common stock for the time periods prior to when our stock began to be publicly traded.\n\nOn November 8, 2016, the closing price for our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Market was $ 0.95 per share. The following table sets forth the ranges of high and low sales prices per share of our common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market.\n\nHigh Low Year Ended December 31, 2015 First Quarter (beginning February 13, 2015) $12.92 $8.01 Second Quarter $10.88 $7.32 Third Quarter $8.54 $2.75 Fourth Quarter $5.09 $2.47 Year Ending December 31, 2016 First Quarter $3.75 $1.90 Second Quarter $4.58 $1.09 Third Quarter $2.68 $1.24 Fourth Quarter (through November 8, 2016) $ 1.48 $ 0.95\n\nAs of November 8, 2016, there were 237 stockholders of record of our common stock. As of such date, the number of shares of our outstanding common stock was 14,506,997. The number of stockholders of record of our voting securities excludes stockholders whose shares were held in nominee or street name by brokers. The actual number of common stockholders is greater than the number of record holders, and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees.

Our focus is the continued development of our nitric oxide therapy for patients with pulmonary hypertension, or PH, using our proprietary delivery system, INOpulse, with pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, representing the lead indication. Our INOpulse platform is based on our proprietary pulsatile nitric oxide delivery device.\n\nIn February 2016, we announced positive data from the final analysis of our Phase 2 long-term extension clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH, which is Part 2 of our Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH. The data indicates a sustainability of benefit to PAH patients who received INOpulse therapy at the 75 mcg/kg of ideal body weight/hour dose for an average of greater than 12 hours per day and were on long-term oxygen therapy, or LTOT. After reaching agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, on our Phase 3 protocol, we are moving forward with Phase 3 development. In September 2015, the FDA issued a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, for our Phase 3 PAH program for INOpulse, which will include two confirmatory clinical trials, undertaken either sequentially or in parallel. The first of the two Phase 3 trials has been initiated with the first patient enrolled in June 2016. We plan to have our Data Monitoring Committee conduct an unblinded interim analysis on the first trial after approximately half of the subjects have completed a total of 18 weeks to assess for efficacy, futility and potential sample size reassessment.\n\nWe completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-confirmation Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PH-COPD in July 2014. We received results from this trial, and we have initiated further Phase 2 testing to demonstrate the potential benefit on exercise capacity. In September 2015, an oral presentation of late-breaking data from a clinical trial sponsored by us was presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress 2015 in Amsterdam. The data showed that INOpulse improved vasodilation in patients with PH-COPD. In July 2016, the results were published in the International Journal of COPD in an article titled \"Pulmonary vascular effects of pulsed inhaled nitric oxide in COPD patients with pulmonary hypertension\". Building upon this and other work we have done over recent quarters, we have initiated Phase 2 testing for the use of the INOpulse device for PH-COPD patients to evaluate the potential benefit of chronic use on exercise capacity, with the first patient enrolled in October 2016.\n\nWe have begun clinical testing of the INOpulse therapy to treat PH associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or PH-IPF, based on feedback from the medical community and the large unmet medical need for this condition. Our first patient was enrolled in our Phase 2 study in the second quarter of 2016. In addition, other opportunities for the application of our INOpulse platform include the following indications: chronic thromboembolic PH, or CTEPH, PH associated with sarcoidosis and PH associated with pulmonary edema from high altitude sickness.\n\nWe have devoted all of our resources to our therapeutic discovery and development efforts, including conducting clinical trials for our product candidates, protecting our intellectual property and the general and administrative support of these operations. We have devoted significant time and resources to developing and optimizing our drug delivery system, INOpulse, which operates through the administration of nitric oxide as brief, controlled pulses that are timed to occur at the beginning of a breath.\n\nTo date, we have generated no revenue from product sales. We expect that it will be several years before we commercialize a product candidate, if ever.\n\nOur Development Program\n\nThe following table summarizes key information about our primary development product, INOpulse, and indications for which we have worldwide commercialization rights.\n\nFrom the inception of our business through December 31, 2015, $228.0 million was invested in our development programs. Prior to our February 2015 initial public offering, or IPO, our sole source of funding was investments in us by our former parent company, Ikaria, Inc. (a subsidiary of Mallinckrodt plc), or Ikaria. As used herein, unless the context otherwise requires, references to “Ikaria” refer to Ikaria, Inc. and its subsidiaries and any successor entity.\n\nINOpulse\n\nOur INOpulse program is an extension of the technology used in hospitals to deliver continuous-flow inhaled nitric oxide. Use of inhaled nitric oxide is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and certain other regulatory authorities to treat persistent PH of the newborn. Ikaria has marketed continuous-flow inhaled nitric oxide as INOmax for hospital use in this indication since FDA approval in 1999. In October 2013, Ikaria transferred to us exclusive worldwide, royalty-free rights to develop and commercialize pulsed nitric oxide in PAH, PH associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or PH-COPD, and PH associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or PH-IPF. In July 2015, we expanded the scope of our license to allow us to develop our INOpulse program for the treatment of chronic thromboembolic PH, or CTEPH, PH associated with sarcoidosis and PH associated with pulmonary edema from high altitude sickness with a royalty equal to 5% of net sales of any commercial products for these three additional indications. In November 2015, we entered into an amendment to our exclusive cross-license, technology transfer and regulatory matters agreement with Ikaria that included a royalty equal to 3% of net sales of any commercial products for PAH. Our INOpulse program is built on scientific and technical expertise developed for the therapeutic delivery of inhaled nitric oxide. In 2010 and 2012, respectively, Ikaria submitted investigational new drug applications, or INDs, for INOpulse for the treatment of patients with PAH and PH-COPD. PAH is a form of PH that is closely related to persistent PH of the newborn. These INDs were included in the assets that were transferred to us by Ikaria.\n\nNitric oxide is naturally produced and released by the lining of the blood vessels and results in vascular smooth muscle relaxation, an important factor in regulating blood pressure. Relaxation of the muscles of the blood vessels allows the heart to increase blood flow to tissues and organs of the body, including the lung. When administered through inhalation, nitric oxide acts to selectively reduce pulmonary arterial pressure in the lung with minimal effects on blood pressure outside of the lungs, an important safety consideration.\n\nInhaled nitric oxide is widely used in the hospital setting for the treatment of a variety of conditions and, as reported by Ikaria, over 600,000 patients have been treated with inhaled nitric oxide worldwide since its first such use. However, chronic outpatient use of this therapy has previously been limited by a lack of a safe and compact delivery system for outpatient use. We have designed our INOpulse device, which is the means by which inhaled nitric oxide is delivered to the patient, to be portable, which enables use by ambulatory patients on a daily basis inside or outside their homes. Our INOpulse device has a proprietary mechanism that delivers brief, targeted pulses of nitric oxide timed to occur at the beginning of a breath for delivery to the well-ventilated alveoli of the lungs, which minimizes the amount of drug required for treatment. We estimate this, and the higher concentration of nitric oxide we use, reduces the volume of drug delivered to approximately 5% of the volume required for equivalent alveolar absorption using standard continuous flow delivery systems, and also reduces the amount of nitric oxide, as well as its by-product nitrogen dioxide, that is exhaled and released into the patient’s environment. INOpulse is designed to automatically adjust nitric oxide delivery based on a patient’s breathing pattern to deliver a constant and\n\nappropriate dose of the inhaled nitric oxide over time, independent of the patient’s activity level, thus ensuring more consistent dosing of the nitric oxide to the alveoli of the lungs.\n\nIn our recently completed INOpulse clinical trials, we used the first generation INOpulse device, which we refer to as the INOpulse DS device. Beginning with our Phase 3 trial of INOpulse for PAH in 2016, we have begun using our second generation device, which we refer to as the INOpulse device. The INOpulse device has approximately the same dimensions as a paperback book and weighs approximately 2.5 pounds. The INOpulse device has a simple and intuitive user interface and a battery life of approximately 16 hours when recharged, which takes approximately four hours and can be done while the patient sleeps. Based on the doses we have evaluated in our clinical trials, we expect that most patients will use two cartridges a day. The INOpulse device incorporates our proprietary triple-lumen nasal cannula, safety systems and proprietary software algorithms. The triple-lumen nasal cannula enables more accurate dosing of nitric oxide and minimizes infiltration of oxygen, which can react with nitric oxide to form nitrogen dioxide. Our triple-lumen nasal cannula consists of a thin, plastic tube that is divided into three channels from end-to-end, including at the prongs that are placed in the patient’s nostrils, with one channel delivering inhaled nitric oxide, a second for breath detection and a third available for oxygen delivery. INOpulse is configured to be highly portable and compatible with long-term oxygen therapy, or LTOT, systems via nasal cannula delivery.\n\nThe INOpulse device has been well received by patients in the usability research we have conducted. In addition to the baseline testing on the original INOpulse DS device, we have conducted two rounds of testing with COPD and PAH patients to evaluate the user interface, loading mechanism, size, carrying bag and other features. In the usability research we have conducted, all eight patients with experience with the INOpulse DS device responded positively to the INOpulse device, and several of these patients indicated that the ability to take the INOpulse device outside the home would likely reduce concerns with maintaining compliance.\n\nOur technology is based on patents we have exclusively licensed from Ikaria for the treatment of PAH, PH-COPD, PH-IPF, CTEPH, PH associated with sarcoidosis and PH associated with pulmonary edema from altitude sickness which, collectively, we refer to as the Bellerophon indications. These include patents with respect to the pulsed delivery of nitric oxide to ensure a consistent dose over time, which expire as late as 2027 in the United States and as late as 2026 in certain other countries, as well as with respect to the special triple-lumen cannula that allows for safer and more accurate dosing of pulsed nitric oxide, which expires in 2033 in the United States and abroad. We have also licensed several other patent applications from Ikaria for certain of the innovations included in the INOpulse device and certain of the resulting patents, if issued, would expire as late as 2030 in the United States.\n\nDuring January 2016, the European Patent Office issued a Notice of Intention to Grant a European Patent that provides protection for our INOpulse program. The patent, entitled “System of Administering a Pharmaceutical Gas to a Patient,” covers the ability to provide a known amount of pharmaceutical gas to a patient regardless of the patient inspiration rate or volume and distinguishes the INOpulse® delivery system from others on the market. Upon grant by the European Patent Office, the patent can be officially validated in up to 38 European countries. Also during January 2016, we received EC Certification for our proprietary new, INOpulse® drug-device delivery system. This European Conformity, or EC Certification grants CE marking on the INOpulse product, which confirms INOpulse compliance with the essential requirements of the relevant European health, safety and environment protection legislation of the European Union. This certification covers the design, development and manufacture of inhaled pulsatile nitric oxide drug delivery systems including our triple-lumen cannula and application software.\n\nINOpulse for PAH\n\nWe are developing INOpulse for the treatment of PAH to address a significant and unmet medical need in an orphan disease, which is a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. This program represents a potential first-in-class therapy for this indication. In 2011, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to our nitric oxide program for the treatment of PAH. If a product with an orphan drug designation is the first to receive FDA approval, the FDA will not approve another product for the same indication that uses the same active ingredient for seven years, except in a limited number of specific situations such as another product being shown to be clinically superior.\n\nPAH is characterized by abnormal constriction of the arteries in the lung that increases the blood pressure in the lungs which, in turn, results in abnormal strain on the heart’s right ventricle, eventually leading to heart failure. While prevalence data varies widely, we estimate that there are a total of at least 35,000 patients currently diagnosed with and being treated for PAH in the United States and European Union. Moreover, because PAH is rare and causes varied symptoms, we believe there is significant under-diagnosis of the condition at its early stages. There are several approved therapies for PAH, and we estimate, based on public product sales data, that 2014 combined global sales for these therapies were over $4.6 billion with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 7% . Most PAH patients are treated with multiple medications and many are on supportive therapy. We believe that 40 to 60% of PAH patients are on LTOT. Despite the availability of multiple therapies for this condition, PAH continues to be a life-threatening, progressive disorder. A French registry initiated in 2002 and a U.S. registry initiated in 2006 estimate that the median survival of patients with PAH is three and five years from initial diagnosis, respectively.\n\nWe completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH in October 2014, which was Part 1 of the trial. In February 2016, we announced positive data from the final analysis of Part 2 of our Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH. The data reinforces the results from October 2014 and indicates a sustainability of benefit to PAH patients who received INOpulse therapy at the 75 mcg dose for an average of greater than 12 hours per day and were also treated with LTOT. After reaching agreement with the FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, on our Phase 3 protocol, we are moving forward with Phase 3 development. In September 2015, the FDA issued a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, for our Phase 3 PAH program for INOpulse, which will include two confirmatory clinical trials, undertaken either sequentially or in parallel. The first of the two Phase 3 trials has been initiated with the first patient enrolled in June 2016. We plan to have our Data Monitoring Committee conduct an un-blinded interim analysis on the first trial after approximately half of the subjects have completed a total of 18 weeks to assess for efficacy, futility and potential sample size reassessment.\n\nINOpulse for PH-COPD\n\nWe are also developing INOpulse for the treatment of PH-COPD. COPD is a disease characterized by progressive and persistent airflow limitations. Patients with more severe COPD frequently have hypoxemia, or an abnormally low level of oxygen in the blood, and may be treated with LTOT. Despite treatment with oxygen, hypoxemia can progress and contribute to PH. In 2010, Datamonitor estimated that over 1.4 million COPD patients in the United States were being treated with LTOT. Based on academic studies, we estimate that 50% of COPD patients on LTOT have PH. PH-COPD patients have a lower median life expectancy and a higher rate of hospitalization than COPD patients with similar respiratory disease but without PH. Currently, there are no approved therapies for treating PH-COPD, and the only generally accepted treatments are LTOT, pulmonary rehabilitation and lung transplant. The overall COPD market in the United States was estimated to be approximately $32 billion in 2010 with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 4%.\n\nThe data from an initial three-month, open-label chronic-use Phase 2 trial conducted by a third party, which we in-licensed, showed that pulsed inhaled nitric oxide significantly reduced pulmonary arterial pressures in PH-COPD patients on LTOT and did so without causing hypoxemia, which is a significant concern for these patients. The FDA asked us to confirm the dose range and the safety related to hypoxemia in PH-COPD patients using the INOpulse device, prior to proceeding to large scale trials. Following this guidance, we conducted a Phase 2 acute dose ranging randomized placebo-controlled trial in 159 patients with the INOpulse DS device, with doses ranging from 3 mcg to 75 mcg. This trial, which we completed in July 2014, identified a dose range that showed similar reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure versus baseline when compared to the initial acute effects of pulsed inhaled nitric oxide in the original chronic-use trial. In addition, in our confirmatory trial, none of the INOpulse doses tested had an adverse effect on hypoxemia relative to placebo. While the reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure did not reach statistical significance versus placebo in this acute setting, which was the primary endpoint of the trial, we believe that the results have confirmed a dose range for this therapy that delivers a significant reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure versus baseline and does not cause hypoxemia in patients with PH-COPD. In September 2015, an oral presentation of late-breaking data from a clinical trial sponsored by us was presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress 2015 in Amsterdam. The data showed that INOpulse improved vasodilation in patients with PH-COPD. Building upon this and other work we have done over recent quarters, we have initiated additional Phase 2 testing for the use of the INOpulse device for PH-COPD patients to evaluate the potential benefit of chronic use on exercise capacity, with the first patient enrolled in October 2016.\n\nOur Strategy\n\nOur goal is to become a leader in developing and commercializing innovative products at the intersection of drugs and devices that address significant unmet medical needs in the treatment of cardiopulmonary diseases. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include:\n\n·Advance the clinical development of INOpulse. One of our lead indications for our product candidate is INOpulse for PAH. Our Phase 3 PAH program for INOpulse will include two confirmatory clinical trials, undertaken either sequentially or in parallel, with the first patient enrolled in June 2016. We also initiated our second Phase 2 study for INOpulse in PH-COPD looking at the effect of chronic use on exercise capacity, for which the first patient was enrolled in October 2016. We also initiated our Phase 2 studies in PH-IPF consisting of an exploratory acute hemodynamic study, for which the first patient was enrolled in second quarter of 2016, to be followed by exercise capacity.\n\n·Leverage our historical core competencies to expand our pipeline. Our employees have years of institutional experience in the use of inhaled nitric oxide in treating PH and in the development of drug-device combination product candidates. If we successfully advance INOpulse, we expect to develop INOpulse for treatment of CTEPH, PH associated with sarcoidosis and PH associated with pulmonary edema from altitude sickness and, subject to obtaining additional license rights from Ikaria, potentially other outpatient PH indications. Our longer-term vision is to identify and opportunistically in-license innovative therapies that are at the intersection of drugs and devices and to develop and commercialize these product candidates.\n\n·Build commercial infrastructure in select markets. As we near completion of the development of our product candidates, we may build a commercial infrastructure to enable us to market and sell certain of our product candidates with a specialized sales force and to retain co-promotion or similar rights, when feasible, in indications requiring a larger commercial infrastructure. While we may partner with third parties to commercialize our product candidates in certain countries, we may also choose to establish commercialization capabilities in select countries outside the United States.\n\nINOpulse\n\nINOpulse Scientific Background\n\nNitric oxide is a naturally occurring molecule produced by many cells of the body. Researchers found that nitric oxide is produced and released by the lining of the blood vessels and plays a role in controlling muscle tone in blood vessels. In particular, nitric oxide results in vascular smooth muscle relaxation in blood vessels and thus is an important factor in regulating blood pressure. As the muscles of the blood vessels relax, blood flow increases, helping the heart to deliver more blood to the body. PH patients can have a deficiency in endogenous nitric oxide production in their lungs. When administered by inhalation to patients with PH, we expect inhaled nitric oxide to act in a similar manner to naturally produced nitric oxide.\n\nThe scientific journal Science named nitric oxide Molecule of the Year in 1992. Additionally, the three researchers who discovered the role of nitric oxide as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system earned the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1998.\n\nIn 1991, Dr. Warren Zapol and his associates at the Massachusetts General Hospital discovered that inhaling nitric oxide in gas form could reduce high blood pressure in the lungs, a condition known as PH. Nitric oxide is a rapid and potent vasodilator, which means it dilates, or widens, blood vessels. When inhaled, it quickly dilates blood vessels in the lungs, which reduces blood pressure in the lungs, strain on the right ventricle and shunting of de-oxygenated blood away from the lungs. Because more blood can flow through the lungs, oxygen levels within blood improve. In addition, inhaled nitric oxide improves the efficiency of oxygen delivery, and because it is a gas, it goes only to the portions of the lung that are ventilated, or receiving air flow, and increases blood flow only in these areas. Thus, inhaled nitric oxide improves ventilation-perfusion matching, an important\n\nelement of lung function involving the air that reaches the lungs, or ventilation, and the blood that reaches the lungs, or perfusion. Inhaled nitric oxide is quickly inactivated after contact with blood, and is selective for the lungs, meaning that it has minimal effects on blood pressure outside of the lungs, which is an important safety consideration.\n\nIn 1999, the FDA approved the use of inhaled nitric oxide for the short-term treatment of persistent PH of the newborn. Based on this approval, and similar approvals from foreign regulatory authorities, continuous-flow inhaled nitric oxide, which is administered to ventilated patients by a dedicated in-hospital device, is marketed by Ikaria and its commercialization partners worldwide as INOmax (INOflo in Japan). Inhaled nitric oxide is widely used in the hospital setting for a variety of conditions and, as reported by Ikaria, over 600,000 patients have been treated with inhaled nitric oxide worldwide since its commercial launch. However, chronic outpatient use of this therapy has previously been limited by the lack of a safe and compact delivery system for outpatient use.\n\nIntroduction to Pulmonary Hypertension\n\nPH is a disease characterized by constriction of the blood vessels in the lung, which causes blood pressure in the lung to rise and, in turn, increases the work required for the right ventricle of the heart to pump blood. The World Health Organization, or WHO, has endorsed a consensus classification for PH that was updated most recently in 2013. The WHO classification has five broad PH groups based on similarities in pathological and hemodynamic characteristics and therapeutic approaches. We are initially focusing development of INOpulse in indications included in WHO Groups 1 and 3 due to our view of the likelihood of success and the size and commercial viability of these markets. Group 1 PH is comprised of patients with PAH. This Group combines conditions with a range of causes, all of which have a characteristic pattern of vascular remodeling. The constriction of the blood vessels and the resulting pressure on the heart is often the major reason for poor prognosis of PAH patients since they can be otherwise healthy. Most PAH-specific medications are vasodilators and work through one of the three key mechanistic pathways for vasoconstriction and vasodilation. We expect that, because inhaled nitric oxide is a vasodilator and PH patients can have a deficiency in endogenous nitric oxide production in their lungs, patients in Group 1 will benefit from INOpulse. Group 3 PH consists of PH associated with lung disease or hypoxemia, which is an abnormally low level of oxygen in the blood. This Group includes patients with PH-COPD and PH-IPF, among others.\n\nINOpulse for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension\n\nWe are developing INOpulse for PAH to address a significant and unmet medical need in an orphan disease. This product candidate represents the development of a potential first-in-class therapy for this indication. Although current therapy for PAH provides some therapeutic benefit, there remains no cure, and approved therapies can have significant systemic side effects, such as hypotension and liver injury. INOpulse for PAH is designed to be a selective, short-acting pulmonary vasodilator and is being tested as an add-on therapy to existing PAH medications to evaluate its efficacy and side effect profile, in particular its ability to provide clinical benefit without adding to the systemic effects of other therapies such as hypotension.\n\nDisease Background and Market Opportunity\n\nPAH is a life-threatening, progressive disorder characterized by abnormally high blood pressure, or hypertension, in the pulmonary artery, the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. PAH occurs when most of the very small arteries, or arterioles, throughout the lungs narrow in diameter, which increases the resistance to blood flow through the lungs. To overcome the increased resistance, pressure increases in the pulmonary artery and the right ventricle, which is the heart chamber that pumps blood into the pulmonary artery. In addition, PAH may cause changes to the blood vessel lining that hinder the natural production of nitric oxide. Signs and symptoms of PAH occur when this increased pressure in the right\n\nventricle cannot fully overcome the elevated resistance.\n\nThere are a number of drugs approved for the treatment of PAH that work primarily by reducing pulmonary vascular resistance, which is the primary problem for these patients. The currently approved PAH medications slow down disease progression, but do not prevent the underlying disease. Despite the availability of multiple therapies for this condition, the mortality rate for PAH remains high, with estimates of median survival ranging from three to five years. Currently, the only definitive treatment for PAH is a lung transplant, which is only available to a minority of patients due to the strict requirements and availability of viable lungs for transplant. Patients with PAH also report severe impairment of health-related quality of life, including poor\n\ngeneral and emotional health and impaired physical functioning. The most common symptoms of PAH are shortness of breath during exertion and syncope, or fainting spells. People with PAH may experience additional symptoms, particularly as the condition worsens, including dizziness, swelling of the ankles or legs, chest pain and a racing pulse. These impairments to health-related quality of life are comparable and sometimes more severe than those reported in patients with severely debilitating conditions such as spinal cord injury.\n\nSince PAH is an orphan condition with poor diagnosis rates, published prevalence estimates for PAH vary widely. Based on epidemiological studies and current treatment rates, we estimate that there are a total of at least 35,000 patients currently diagnosed and treated for PAH in the United States and European Union. The average age of PAH patients at diagnosis is approximately 50 years, and approximately 80% of PAH patients are female. PAH is often diagnosed late in the disease progression with approximately 73% of these patients already having progressed to WHO functional Class III or IV at the time of diagnosis.\n\nPAH is characterized by abnormal constriction of the arteries in the lung. PAH patients are generally treated with one or more of the four major classes of approved medications, which are prostacyclin and prostacyclin analogs, phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors, endothelin receptor antagonists and a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, all of which potentially result in vasodilatory systemic effects and, therefore, hypotension. Current guidelines recommend treatment with multiple medications in Class III and IV patients with progressive disease but suggest treatment be carefully managed by experienced physicians. Approximately 45% of PAH patients are treated with more than one class of medication at a given time. In addition, since hypoxemia can be a problem in these patients, it is often treated with LTOT in accordance with broadly supported treatment guidelines in the United States and European Union.\n\nWe are testing INOpulse for PAH as an add-on therapy for use in patients whose disease is progressing and who use additional medications. If it is approved, we expect INOpulse will provide the greatest benefit to patients who require pulmonary arterial pressure reductions beyond the reductions achieved with the medication they are already using. Because of its localized effect and short-half life, we do not expect INOpulse will add to systemic blood pressure reductions of other PAH drugs. We believe that INOpulse is also likely to be preferentially prescribed for patients already on LTOT. Data from the REVEAL registry, a registry study of PAH based in the United States, indicate that approximately 40% of patients are treated with oxygen for hypoxemia. A more recent assessment of the use of oxygen in the REVEAL registry found that 57% of PAH patients were on LTOT. Approximately 60% of the patients from Part 1 of our Phase 2 clinical trial completed in October 2014 were on LTOT. We believe that, as compared to patients who are not using a nasal cannula, patients who are accustomed to using a nasal cannula for delivery of oxygen are more likely to be prescribed and are more likely to be compliant with the use of INOpulse.\n\nA 2013 report by CVS Caremark Specialty Analytics provided examples of PAH medications with annual prices ranging from approximately $100,000 to $150,000 per patient per year in the United States. We expect that, if approved, the price of INOpulse will be in the range of other established PAH medications.\n\nScientific Rationale for Use of INOpulse for PAH\n\nSince the discovery of the significant role of nitric oxide in vasodilation, there has been an expectation in the scientific community that inhaled nitric oxide could be an effective therapy for PAH. According to the Cleveland Clinic Center for Continuing Education section on Pulmonary Hypertension, exogenous administration of nitric oxide by inhalation is probably the most effective and specific therapy for PAH, but cost and technical complexity of delivering inhaled nitric oxide have limited its use to the hospital. Although not approved for the treatment of PAH, data from an in-hospital survey conducted by Ikaria showed an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 INOmax uses in PAH patients in the United States each year, indicating that physicians already use nitric oxide in some PAH patients. The difficulty in delivering inhaled nitric oxide outside of the hospital results from the size of the device and cylinder and the need for a specialized delivery system with built-in safety systems.\n\nWe are developing nitric oxide for treatment of PAH because nitric oxide is a proven vasodilator, and PAH is primarily a disease of high pulmonary vascular resistance. PAH is associated with impaired release of nitric oxide and thus we believe chronic administration of inhaled nitric oxide may be viewed as an adjunctive or replacement therapy in patients with PAH. The use of inhaled nitric oxide in PAH has been proposed since the role of nitric\n\noxide in this disease was identified. This drug has been tested in limited investigational studies conducted at academic institutions.\n\nOne clinical trial conducted by a third party at an academic center in Spain in 11 patients, seven of whom had severe PAH and four of whom had severe chronic thromboembolic PH, or CTEPH, evaluated the use of pulsed inhaled nitric oxide in an ambulatory setting. In this open-label, single-arm trial with no placebo control, patients were given ambulatory pulsed inhaled nitric oxide therapy via a nasal cannula for up to one year, after being withdrawn from PAH-specific therapy. The nitric oxide pulse was delivered to the patient at the beginning of each inspiration at a flow rate that was individualized for such patient. The goal of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment with inhaled nitric oxide outside the hospital setting.\n\nAt the start of this trial, patients were evaluated for various measures including the distance they were able to walk in six minutes and their WHO functional class status. At baseline, most of these patients had significant impairment of six-minute walk distance, or 6MWD, with the ability to walk an average of 125 meters, and poor WHO functional class status, with nine patients in Class IV and two patients in Class III. After one month of therapy, overall, patients improved based on WHO functional class, with six patients in Class III and five in Class II, and had improvements in 6MWD of 128 meters on average. After six months of treatment, patients did not worsen clinically, however, between months six and 12, seven patients were given a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor due to clinical worsening. One patient who initially did well with the added phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor therapy developed severe right heart failure at month eight and died, and another patient received a lung transplant at month nine. The remaining nine patients all had clinical status at month 12 similar to their one month evaluation, and improvements in functional class and 6MWD for the group persisted over time.\n\nWe do not expect INOpulse to have systemic effects beyond the pulmonary vasculature because of the short half-life of nitric oxide combined with its targeted delivery to the alveoli. When nitric oxide is delivered as a pulse at the beginning of inhalation, it travels to the alveoli where it diffuses rapidly across the alveolar capillary membrane into the adjacent vascular smooth muscle of pulmonary vessels. This transport is similar to the natural transport of endogenous nitric oxide from the endothelial cells, where it is produced, to the vascular smooth muscle cells where it relaxes the muscle and causes vasodilation of the pulmonary arteries. We believe this makes INOpulse unlikely to have intolerable side effects, such as systemic hypotension or drug-drug interactions. Given the need for PAH patients to be treated with multiple therapies and the potential for increased hypotension from each of the currently approved PAH therapies, we are developing INOpulse as an add-on or adjunctive therapy for PAH, where we believe it has the highest commercial potential.\n\nClinical Development Program\n\nINOpulse for PAH is designated as a drug-device combination by the FDA and is subject to review by the Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research with consultation from the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Based upon our IND for PAH, the FDA has agreed that no further preclinical studies are required for clinical development of INOpulse for PAH.\n\nPhase 2 Clinical Trial\n\nIn October 2014, we completed Part 1 of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH in the United States and Canada. Our key inclusion criteria for patients in this trial were that they be diagnosed with PH WHO Group 1, be on at least one other PAH medication for at least 12 weeks prior to treatment with INOpulse; and demonstrate being able to walk between 100 and 450 meters within six minutes. In addition, this trial excluded patients with evidence of significant left ventricular dysfunction.\n\nThe trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial with patients randomized 1:1:1 to placebo or to one of two active doses, either 25 or 75 mcg/kg ideal body weight/hour, (iNO 25 or iNO 75), for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint in this trial was a change in pulmonary vascular resistance from baseline to 16 weeks, which was the end of Part 1. The target change in pulmonary vascular resistance was 190 dynes sec. cm-5, and the trial was powered for statistical significance at 130 dynes sec. cm-5. The main secondary endpoint was change in 6MWD over the same period. A clinically meaningful change in 6MWD is typically considered to be an increase of at least 30 to 35 meters.\n\nWe randomized 80 patients for Part 1 of the Phase 2 clinical trial. The majority of the patients were female (79%), white (89%) and had idiopathic PAH (74%). The results from Part 1 of this trial, showed a trend toward lower pulmonary vascular resistance in both the active arms compared to placebo and a trend toward increased 6MWD in the higher dose group. However, neither result was statistically significant.\n\nHowever, among LTOT users, there was a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement versus placebo in both pulmonary vascular resistance and 6MWD in patients on the iNO75 dose.\n\nThe Part 1 data analysis showed the following:\n\n·Patients on LTOT in the iNO 75 dose treatment arm who remained on INOpulse therapy for at least 12 hours a day had a mean improvement of 52.4 meters as compared to baseline (n=13).\n\n·Patients on LTOT in the iNO 75 dose treatment arm who remained on INOpulse therapy for less than 12 hours a day showed a mean decrease of 10.7 meters as compared to baseline (n=5).\n\n·Patients on LTOT in the iNO 25 dose treatment arm had a mean increase of 9.1 meters from baseline (n=15).\n\n·Patients on LTOT in the Placebo arm had a mean decrease of 10.7 meters from baseline (n=10).\n\nThe patients on LTOT in the iNO 75 dose treatment arm who remained on the INOpulse therapy for at least 12 hours a day had a placebo corrected increase of 69.6 meters (increase of 52.4 meters for iNO 75 against a decrease of 17.2 meters for the corresponding placebo arm).\n\nINOpulse was relatively well-tolerated in Part 1 of this trial. Our Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board evaluated the safety analysis from Part 1 of the trial in November 2014 and recommended proceeding with Part 2 of the trial. Possibly drug-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, occurred in no patients in the placebo group and one subject in each of the iNO25 and iNO75 groups.\n\nOne patient in the placebo arm died during Part 1 of the trial due to worsening PAH. SAEs were reported for four patients in the placebo arm, including one each of: pneumonia/worsening PAH, catheter-related infection, ascites and left hip sciatica. Each of these was assessed by the investigator for the trial as unrelated. Four patients in the iNO25 low-dose active treatment arm experienced SAEs, including bacteremia, myelodysplastic syndrome, increased shortness of breath and dyspnea, one of which was assessed as possibly related to trial therapy. The iNO75 high-dose active treatment arm had nine patients with SAEs. The most common SAEs reported in the iNO75 group were syncope and bronchitis/tracheobronchitis, one of which was assessed as possibly related to trial therapy. Discontinuation of trial therapy due to adverse events, or AEs, occurred for two patients in the iNO75 arm and one subject in each of the iNO25 and placebo arms.\n\nIn February 2016, we announced positive data from the final analysis of our Phase 2 long-term extension clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH, which is Part 2 of our Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PAH. The data reinforces the results from October 2014 and indicates a sustainability of benefit to PAH patients who received INOpulse 75mcg dose therapy for an average of greater than 12 hours per day and were also treated with LTOT.\n\nFollowing 16 weeks of blinded therapy in Part 1 of the trial, in Part 2 of the trial, 65 patients were randomized to receive INOpulse doses of either iNO25 or iNO75. The long-term extension analysis was performed after patients had completed between 16 and 32 months of INOpulse treatment, and data from the long-term extension analysis was compared to baseline measurements taken at the beginning of Part 1 of the trial. All patients in the trial were on at least one approved PAH therapy, and most were on two or three PAH therapies.\n\nThe long-term extension analysis showed the following:\n\n·Patients on LTOT in the iNO 75 dose treatment arm who remained on INOpulse therapy for at least 12 hours a day had a mean improvement of 55.2 meters as compared to baseline (n=7).\n\n·Patients on LTOT in the iNO 75 dose treatment arm who remained on INOpulse therapy for less than 12 hours a day showed a mean decrease of 18.0 meters as compared to baseline (n=6).\n\n·Patients on LTOT in the iNO 25 dose treatment arm had a mean decrease of 43.7 meters from baseline (n=12).\n\nFor patients in the long-term extension study, no significant safety issues have been found with no reports of methemoglobin elevation and no adjudicated cases of pulmonary rebound. Only two SAEs have been reported as possibly related, with these subjects continuing on iNO therapy.\n\nPivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trials\n\nAfter reaching agreement with the FDA and EMA on our Phase 3 protocol, we are moving forward with our Phase 3 development program. In September 2015, the FDA issued a SPA for our Phase 3 PAH program for INOpulse, which will include two confirmatory clinical trials, undertaken either sequentially or in parallel. The first of the two Phase 3 studies has been initiated with the first patient enrolled in June 2016.\n\nThe key elements of the planned U.S. and European Union Phase 3 development program are:\n\n·The Phase 3 program will consist of two clinical trials totaling approximately 450 patients; one trial with two treatment arms (iNO 75 and placebo) and one with three treatment arms (iNO 75, iNO 50 and placebo). Each treatment arm will consist of approximately 90 patients. Trial was designed to detect a 40 meter difference in 6MWD assuming a 75 meter standard deviation.\n\n·All patients in the trials will be on LTOT.\n\n·The primary endpoint is improvement in 6MWD compared to placebo after 16 weeks.\n\n·The secondary endpoint is Time to Clinical Worsening (TTCW), with analysis pooled across both trials. Patients will stay on therapy until the last patient visit measuring 6MWD.\n\n·Each trial will have a run-in period of two weeks to ensure compliance. Patients who do not stay on the therapy for at least 16 hours a day during this period will be replaced.\n\nWe plan to have our Data Monitoring Committee conduct an un-blinded interim analysis on the first trial after approximately half of the subjects have completed a total of 18 weeks to assess for efficacy, futility and potential sample size reassessment.\n\nINOpulse for PH-COPD\n\nWe are developing INOpulse for PH-COPD to address a significant unmet medical need that we believe is often overlooked in everyday clinical practice because of the lack of available therapy. PH is more prevalent among those COPD patients who have advanced loss of respiratory function and low peripheral blood oxygen levels requiring treatment with LTOT. The co-morbidity of PH in these patients leads to cardiovascular complications from the added strain on the right ventricle of the heart. Current drug therapies for COPD are targeted to relieve the symptoms and complications of the respiratory component of the disease. Unlike these therapies, INOpulse is directed at treating the cardiovascular complications of PH-COPD. We believe PH-COPD patients on LTOT who are at risk for cardiovascular complications could benefit from use of INOpulse in addition to any respiratory benefits that result from their existing treatments.\n\nDisease Background and Market Opportunity\n\nCOPD is a progressive disease caused by chronic inflammation and destruction of the airways and lung tissue. While COPD is primarily a respiratory disease, over time, as the disease progresses, the chronic pulmonary restrictions and resulting deprivation of adequate oxygen, or hypoxia, can contribute to vasoconstriction in the pulmonary arterial bed. In addition, COPD patients can have deficiency in endogenous nitric oxide production in their lungs, which can worsen vasoconstriction. This pulmonary vasoconstriction puts pressure on the right side of the heart, making it less able to cope with stressors and potentially leading to progressive cardiac dilation, heart\n\nfailure and death. This cardiovascular component of COPD is, we believe, often overlooked despite pulmonologists’ general awareness of the problem, in part because there are no specific therapies for the condition in these patients. While it is widely believed that the cardiovascular complications of COPD occur only in the advanced stage of the disease as a consequence of chronic hypoxemia, recent findings demonstrate an earlier involvement of the cardiovascular system in this disease.\n\nIn 2010, Datamonitor estimated that approximately 12 million patients in the United States were being treated for COPD and that over 1.4 million of these patients were being treated with LTOT. Based on academic studies, we estimate that 50% of COPD patients on LTOT in the United States have PH. Even though the degree of PH in these patients is milder than in PAH patients, data published in literature suggests that even small elevations in mean pulmonary artery pressure in patients with advanced COPD can impact hospitalization, patient-assessed functional outcomes and mortality. PH is a well-known predictor of increased morbidity and mortality in COPD patients and is associated with poor quality of life, worse clinical outcomes and shorter survival time. Based on a long-term study completed in 1992 and published in 1995, PH-COPD patients had a four-year survival rate of approximately 50%. By contrast, in this same long-term study, COPD patients with similar pulmonary functions, but without PH, had a four-year survival rate of 80%.\n\nThe overall COPD market in the United States was estimated to be approximately $32 billion in 2010 with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 4%. We expect INOpulse for PH-COPD, if approved, would be a treated as a specialty drug. Specialty drugs are typically high-cost medications, often ranging in price in the United States from approximately $15,000 to $50,000 per patient per year, used to treat rare or complex conditions, requiring close clinical management, special handling and distribution through specialty pharmacies.\n\nScientific Rationale for Use of INOpulse for PH-COPD\n\nThe mechanism of action of inhaled nitric oxide in vasodilation at the alveolar smooth muscle in PH-COPD is similar to its action in PAH. Like endogenous pulmonary nitric oxide, inhaled nitric oxide works by selectively relaxing lung vascular smooth muscles, causing dilation of pulmonary blood vessels and consequently increased pulmonary blood flow. This reduces the elevated pulmonary artery pressure in patients with PH-COPD.\n\nPH-COPD patients generally have hypoxemia as a result of deteriorating lung function, which can be treated with supplemental oxygen therapy. However, these patients are not treated with currently approved PAH-specific drugs because these drugs can worsen hypoxemia. This worsening can occur when these drugs, which are systemically bioavailable, cause indiscriminate pulmonary vasodilation, even in poorly ventilated alveoli, resulting in lower average blood oxygenation levels. We believe that pulsed nitric oxide, as a locally active selective pulmonary vasodilator, can avoid the indiscriminate vasodilation associated with drugs that are systemically bioavailable. The INOpulse technology, by targeting the delivery of the pulse to the well ventilated alveoli, has the potential to drop pulmonary arterial pressure while avoiding the lowering of blood oxygen levels.\n\nThe targeted delivery of inhaled nitric oxide to specific alveoli is important because early trials with continuous-flow inhaled nitric oxide reduced pulmonary arterial pressure in PH-COPD patients but also resulted in lowering of blood oxygen levels. It was postulated that this unwanted effect might be avoided by administering nitric oxide as a brief pulse at the beginning of each breath because well-ventilated alveoli open faster, and a brief early pulse would only reach these alveoli. As early as 1997, this concept was demonstrated by testing inhaled nitric oxide in PH-COPD patients during exercise, which allowed the dose to mimic pulse dosing. Recently, data from a computational fluid-flow modeling study we conducted, using high resolution computed tomography scans and computer simulations, supported this hypothesis that early pulsed delivery of nitric oxide could be directed specifically to the well-ventilated alveoli.\n\nClinical Development Program\n\nINOpulse for PH-COPD is designated as a drug-device combination by the FDA and is being reviewed by the Division of Cardiovascular and Renal Products in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research with consultation from the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Rheumatology Products and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. In our IND for PH-COPD, we referenced all of the information in our IND for PAH. The data referenced in our IND, as well as the years of use of the marketed product, demonstrate that nitric oxide is well tolerated. The FDA has agreed that the IND package is adequate for supporting Phase 2 clinical development of\n\nINOpulse for PH-COPD. The FDA also agreed that no additional pre-clinical studies are needed to support product approval.\n\nWe completed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-confirmation Phase 2 clinical trial of INOpulse for PH-COPD in July 2014. We have received results from this trial, and have initiated further Phase 2 testing to demonstrate the potential benefit on exercise capacity. In September 2015, an oral presentation of late-breaking data from a clinical trial sponsored by us was presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress 2015 in Amsterdam. The data showed that INOpulse improved vasodilation in patients with PH-COPD. Building upon this and other work we have done over recent quarters, we have initiated additional Phase 2 testing for the use of the INOpulse device for PH-COPD patients to evaluate the potential benefit of chronic use on exercise capacity, with the first patient enrolled in October 2016.\n\nThe initiated Phase 2 study in PH-COPD is an open-label study looking at both vasodilation and exercise capacity on 10 COPD patients with pulmonary hypertension who are also on long-term oxygen therapy. The key elements of the study are:\n\n· iNO 30 mcg/kg IBW/hr dose for 4 weeks with a follow-up visit 2 weeks after discontinuation\n\n· All patients in the trials will be on LTOT.\n\n· The primary endpoint is vasodilation in pulmonary arteries measured by high resolution CT scanning (HRCT)\n\n· Key secondary endpoint is 6MWD\n\n· HRCT will be done at baseline and end of 4 weeks with 6MWT performed at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks (2 weeks after discontinuation of therapy)\n\nINOpulse for PH-IPF\n\nWe are also developing INOpulse for the treatment of PH-IPF. IPF is a progressive disease of unknown etiology associated with growth of fibrotic tissue in the lungs causing hypoxemia, dyspnea, fatigue and cough. The median survival is only 2-3 years. Based on academic studies, we estimate the prevalence of IPF in the United States at approximately 90,000 patients, with 20-40% suffering from pulmonary hypertension. PH with IPF increases mortality. The presence of PH correlates most closely with the need for oxygen therapy. The two therapies that are currently approved for IPF, nintedanib and perfinidone cost approximately $100,000 per year.\n\niNO may improve outcomes in PH-IPF by both improving V/Q matching with increases in arterial oxygenation and by lowering pulmonary artery pressures. It has been shown (Yoshida et al) that inhalation of NO significantly reduced the mean pulmonary arterial pressure and the pulmonary vascular resistance as compared with room air alone. However the arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) did not improve. The combined inhalation of NO and oxygen produced a significant decrease of pulmonary arterial pressure (p<0.01) as well as an improvement (p<0.05) in PaO2 as compared to oxygen alone. These findings support the potential for the combined use of nitric oxide and oxygen for treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients with pulmonary hypertension.\n\nClinical Development Program\n\nA Phase 2 study in PH-IPF has been initiated looking at both vasodilation and exercise capacity on 4 IPF patients with pulmonary hypertension who are also on long-term oxygen therapy. The study is made up of a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, acute phase to visualize vasodilation with high resolution computed\n\ntomography (HRCT). This is followed by an open label chronic phase (4 weeks on iNO 75 then 2 week withdrawal period) to assess 6MWD.\n\nINOpulse for Other Pulmonary Hypertension Conditions\n\nPH disease is often classified according to the WHO classification system which groups patients with PH according to the underlying etiologies, or causes, of the PH. In this system, PAH is defined as Group 1 and PH-COPD is classified under Group 3, PH due to lung disease and/or hypoxemia. We believe the mechanism of action of inhaled nitric oxide as a pulmonary vasodilator, and thus INOpulse, can be effective in treating PH related to other conditions, including PH associated with IPF, CTEPH, PH associated with sarcoidosis and PH associated with pulmonary edema from high altitude sickness.\n\nWhile there are two recently approved treatments for IPF, there are currently no approved therapies for PH-IPF. In 2013, riociguat (Adempas) was the first drug therapy approved for treating CTEPH, although other PAH medications are sometimes used to treat this condition. Patients with sarcoidosis are often treated with steroids or other anti-inflammatory medications, however, there are no therapies approved to treat the PH associated with this disease. Pulmonary edema from high altitude sickness is typically treated with oxygen therapy, however, there are no current treatments for PH associated with this disease.\n\nOur current license from Ikaria covers the development of the Bellerophon indications as noted above.\n\nRelationship with Ikaria after the Spin-Out\n\nThe development of our programs was initiated under the leadership of our scientific and development team while at Ikaria. Ikaria’s lead product, INOmax, is an inhaled nitric oxide product used for treatment of persistent PH of the newborn. Our understanding of the medical applications of nitric oxide and associated delivery devices, as well as our innovative approach to the pulsed delivery of nitric oxide, originated at Ikaria.\n\nIn October 2013, Ikaria completed an internal reorganization of certain assets and subsidiaries, in which it transferred to us exclusive worldwide royalty-free rights to develop and commercialize pulsed nitric oxide in PAH, PH-COPD and PH-IPF. In November 2015, we entered into an amendment to our exclusive cross-license, technology transfer and regulatory matters agreement with Ikaria that included a royalty equal to 3% of net sales of any commercial products for PAH. Following the internal reorganization, in February 2014, Ikaria distributed all of our then outstanding units to its stockholders through the payment of a special dividend on a pro rata basis based on each stockholder’s ownership of Ikaria capital stock. We refer to Ikaria’s distribution of our then outstanding units to its stockholders as the Spin-Out.\n\nShortly after the Spin-Out, Ikaria was acquired by entities affiliated with Madison Dearborn Partners. On April 16, 2015, Mallinckrodt plc, or Mallinckrodt, announced that it had completed its acquisition of Ikaria.\n\nIn connection with the Spin-Out, we entered into several agreements with Ikaria providing for, among other things, the provision of transition services, the cross license of certain intellectual property, commitments not to compete, the manufacture and supply of the INOpulse drug and device and certain employee matters.\n\nTransition Services Agreement and 2015 Services Agreement\n\nIn February 2014 and July 2015, we entered into a transition services agreement and an amendment to the transition services agreement, respectively, with Ikaria, which we refer to as the TSA. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the TSA, Ikaria had agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide certain services to us until February 2016. In exchange for the services provided by Ikaria pursuant to the TSA, we paid to Ikaria a service fee in the amount of $772,000 per month and reimbursed Ikaria for any out of pocket expenses, any taxes imposed on Ikaria in connection with the provision of services under the TSA. The termination of these services was accelerated to September 30, 2015 as part of the amendment to the agreement entered in July 2015.\n\nUnder our additional services agreement with Ikaria, or the 2015 Services Agreement, which became effective on January 1, 2015, Ikaria provided to us certain information technology and device servicing services. In exchange for the services provided by Ikaria pursuant to the 2015 Services Agreement, we paid to Ikaria fees that totaled, in the aggregate, approximately $0.2 million. We also received payments of $1.7 million from Ikaria in connection with the 2015 Services Agreement for using commercially reasonable efforts to provide certain services to Ikaria, including services related to regulatory matters, drug and device safety, clinical operations, biometrics and scientific affairs. In July 2015, we entered into an amendment to the 2015 Services Agreement advancing the termination date from February 8, 2016 to September 30, 2015.\n\nExclusive Cross-License, Technology Transfer and Regulatory Matters Agreement\n\nIn February 2014, we entered into an exclusive cross-license, technology transfer and regulatory matters agreement with Ikaria. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, Ikaria granted to us a fully paid-up, non-royalty bearing, exclusive license under specified intellectual property rights controlled by Ikaria to engage in the development, manufacture and commercialization of nitric oxide, devices to deliver nitric oxide and related services for or in connection with out-patient, chronic treatment of patients with PAH, PH-COPD or PH-IPF. On July 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the license agreement to expand the scope of our license to allow us to develop our INOpulse program for the treatment of three additional indications: CTEPH, PH associated with sarcoidosis and PH associated with pulmonary edema from high altitude sickness. Subject to the terms set forth therein, the amendment to the license agreement also provides that the Company will pay Ikaria a royalty equal to 5% of net sales of any commercialized products for the three additional indications. In November 2015, we entered into an amendment to our exclusive cross-license, technology transfer and regulatory matters agreement with Ikaria that included a royalty equal to 3% of net sales of any commercial products for PAH.\n\nWe have granted to Ikaria a fully paid-up, non-royalty-bearing, exclusive license under specified intellectual property rights that we control to engage in the development, manufacture and commercialization of products and services for or used in connection with the diagnosis, prevention or treatment, whether in- or out-patient, of certain conditions and diseases other than the Bellerophon indications and for the use of nitric oxide to treat or prevent conditions that are primarily managed in the hospital, which we refer to collectively as the Ikaria nitric oxide business.\n\nWe have agreed that, during the"
