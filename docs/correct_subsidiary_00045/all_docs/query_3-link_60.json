        "text": "The Whitaker Foundation has long been a major supporter of biomedical engineering in the US. Peter Katona, president of biomedical engineering at the foundation, is hopeful that the NIH will show long-term commitment to bioengineering. While Whitaker has helped to build the educational infrastructure of biomedical engineering with some $50 million annually, it now plans to shut its doors in 2006. At the moment, the foundation has about $400 million, almost half of that already committed, says Katona. The rest will probably be committed in the next three years.\n\nAccording to Katona, Whitaker research grants are typically intended for faculty members who are early in their careers at universities. The foundation also provides funds to universities to start programmes and departments in BME, which often include equipment, facilities and start-up costs for new staff."
