        "text": "The Search box can be used to find tagged facts matching entered keywords. By default, tag name, tag labels, and tagged content are included in Search. To search tagged information, enter a keyword and select the magnifying glass icon to return matching results. Tagged facts matching the search criteria are shown with a yellow-colored (default) shading, while Tagged Sections are reduced to just those that included the entered search keywords (if expanded; see Tagged Sections for additional detail). The content included in Search can be increased to included tag definitions, dimensions, and authoritative references. See Settings for more information.\n\nSearch operators “and” (via “AND” or “&”) and “or” (via “OR” or “|”) are available to further refine a search. For example, and with Settings “Include References” on, searching for “FASB AND 225” will highlight tagged data that is related to FASB Codification topic 225.\n\nFilters can be used in conjunction with Search to further refine the scope of Search. Filters reduce the amount of tagged facts that the keyword search is performed on. For example, if “cash” is entered in conjunction with a Tags filter of “Custom Only”, the shaded search results will only be indicated on tagged facts based on a custom tag.\n\nFilters change the number of highlighted facts indicated by providing several ways to review the tagged information. Multiple filters can be used at once. When the first filter is applied, a filter toolbar indicates all active filter selections and provides the ability to remove one or all applied filters.\n\nData Filter\n\nThese filters options allow the user to refine the highlighted tagged facts by data type:\n\nAll - Displays all tagged data (default)\n\nAmounts Only - Numeric items only\n\nText Only - Textual items only\n\nCalculations Only - Numeric items participating in a calculation\n\nNegatives Only - Numeric items with the Inline “sign” option\n\nAdditional Items Only - Tagged items with potentially no corresponding HTML presentation (i.e., hidden)\n\nTags Filter\n\nThese filters allow the user to refine the highlighted facts by tag type:\n\nStandard Only - Tags from a common taxonomy (e.g., US_GAAP, DEI)\n\nCustom Only - Extension tags unique to the entity's document\n\nMore Filters\n\nAdditional filters that allow user to further refine the highlighted facts:\n\nPeriods - List of all used context reporting periods\n\nMeasures - List of all used units of measure; as applicable\n\nAxes - List of all used axes (dimensions); as applicable\n\nScale - List of all used scaled options (e.g., thousands, millions); as applicable\n\nBalance - Debit, credit; as applicable\n\nMultiple filters work in conjunction with each other. For example, selecting the \"Amounts Only\" Data filter and \"Custom Only\" Tags filter will highlight only numeric tagged facts using custom tags. Active filters are displayed in the Filter toolbar as they are selected. Active filters can be removed individually by selecting the \"X\" icon to the right of each filter, or all at once via the \"Clear All\" option.\n\nSelecting the down arrow \"V\" to the right of the facts count on the toolbar reveals the Facts Results List; a navigable listing of all currently highlighted tagged facts. By default, all tagged facts are displayed in the Facts Results List. The list content and count reflects the currently highlighted facts (i.e., both Filters and Search criteria refine the list to match the highlighted tagged facts). Navigation controls are available to move through the list as well as move the current view to the corresponding highlighted fact location automatically. When a fact in the Facts Results List is selected, it will reveal the Fact Review Window.\n\nIf the letter \"A\" appears for a fact, it indicates the fact is additional data (i.e., hidden with potentially no corresponding HTML presentation). If the letter \"C\" appears, the fact is tagged with a custom tag. If the letter \"D\" appears, the fact is tagged with dimensional information."
