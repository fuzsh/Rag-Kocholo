(Ocular Therapeutix, we or us) for use at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the Annual Meeting) to be held on Thursday, June 2, 2016, beginning at 8:30 a.m., Eastern time, at 34 Crosby Drive, Suite 105, Bedford, MA 01730, and at any adjournment or postponement thereof. On April 7, 2016, the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, there were outstanding and entitled to vote an aggregate of 24,758,786 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (common stock). Each share of common stock entitles the record holder thereof to one vote on each of the matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting.\n\nYour vote is important no matter how many shares you own. Please take the time to vote. Take a moment to read the instructions below. Choose the way to vote that is easiest and most convenient for you, and cast your vote as soon as possible.\n\nIf you are the record holder of your shares, meaning that you own your shares in your own name and not through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote in one of four ways:\n\n(1) You may vote over the Internet. You may vote your shares by following the Vote by Internet instructions on the enclosed proxy card. If you vote over the Internet, you do not need to vote by telephone or complete and mail your proxy card.\n\n(2) You may vote by telephone. You may vote your shares by following the Vote by Phone instructions on the enclosed proxy card. If you vote by telephone, you do not need to vote over the Internet or complete and mail your proxy card.\n\n(3) You may vote by mail. You may vote by completing, dating and signing the proxy card delivered with this proxy statement and promptly mailing it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. If you vote by mail, you do not need to vote over the Internet or by telephone.\n\n(4) You may vote in person. If you attend the Annual Meeting, you may vote by delivering your completed proxy card in person or you may vote by completing a ballot at the Annual Meeting. Ballots will be available at the Annual Meeting.\n\nAll proxies that are executed or are otherwise submitted over the Internet or by telephone will be voted on the matters set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders in accordance with the stockholders instructions. However, if no choice is specified on a proxy as to one or more of the proposals, the proxy will be voted in accordance with the board of directors recommendations on such proposals as set forth in this proxy statement.\n\nAfter you have submitted a proxy, you may still change your vote and revoke your proxy prior to the Annual Meeting by doing any one of the following things:\n\n submitting a new proxy by following the Vote by Internet or Vote by Phone instructions on the enclosed proxy card up until 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, the day before the Annual Meeting;\n\n signing another proxy card and either arranging for delivery of that proxy card by mail prior to the start of the Annual Meeting, or by delivering that signed proxy card in person at the Annual Meeting;\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents\n\n giving our Chief Financial Officer a written notice before or at the Annual Meeting that you want to revoke your proxy; or\n\n voting in person at the Annual Meeting.\n\nYour attendance at the Annual Meeting alone will not revoke your proxy.\n\nIf the shares you own are held in street name by a bank, broker or other nominee record holder, which we collectively refer to in this proxy statement as brokerage firms, your brokerage firm, as the record holder of your shares, is required to vote your shares according to your instructions. In order to vote your shares, you will need to follow the directions your brokerage firm provides you. Many brokerage firms also offer the option of voting over the Internet or by telephone, instructions for which, if available, would be provided by your brokerage firm on the voting instruction form that it delivers to you. Because most brokerage firms are member organizations of the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, the rules of the NYSE will likely govern how your brokerage firm would be permitted to vote your shares in the absence of instruction from you. Under the current rules of the NYSE, if you do not give instructions to your brokerage firm, it will still be able to vote your shares with respect to certain discretionary items, but will not be allowed to vote your shares with respect to certain non-discretionary items. The ratification of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 2) is considered to be a discretionary item under the NYSE rules, and your brokerage firm will be able to vote on that item even if it does not receive instructions from you, so long as it holds your shares in its name. The election of class II directors (Proposal 1) is a non-discretionary item, meaning that if you do not instruct your brokerage firm on how to vote with respect to Proposal 1, your brokerage firm will not vote with respect to that proposal and your shares will be counted as broker non-votes. Broker non-votes are shares that are held in street name by a brokerage firm that indicates on its proxy that it does not have or did not exercise discretionary authority to vote on a particular matter.\n\nIf your shares are held in street name, you must bring an account statement from your brokerage firm showing that you are the beneficial owner of the shares as of the record date (April 7, 2016) in order to be admitted to the Annual Meeting. To be able to vote your shares held in street name at the Annual Meeting, you will need to obtain a proxy card from the holder of record.\n\nVotes Required\n\nThe holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Shares of common stock represented in person or by proxy (including shares which abstain or do not vote with respect to one or more of the matters presented for stockholder approval) will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. The following votes are required for approval of the proposals being presented at the Annual Meeting:\n\nProposal 1: To Elect Two Class II Directors. The two nominees for director receiving the highest number of votes FOR election will be elected as directors. This is called a plurality.\n\nProposal 2: To Ratify the Selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Ocular Therapeutixs Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2016. The affirmative vote of the holders of shares of common stock representing a majority of the votes cast on the matter and voting affirmatively or negatively is required for the ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year.\n\nShares that abstain from voting as to a particular matter and shares held in street name by brokerage firms who indicate on their proxies that they do not have discretionary authority to vote such shares as to a particular matter will not be counted as votes in favor of such matter, and will also not be counted as shares voting on such matter. Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting on the proposals referenced above.\n\n2\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThis proxy statement, the enclosed proxy card and our 2015 annual report to stockholders were first made available to stockholders on or about April 22, 2016.\n\nImportant Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials\n\nfor the Annual Meeting of Stockholders\n\nto Be Held on June 2, 2016\n\nThis proxy statement and our 2015 annual report to\n\nstockholders are available at www.ocutx.com\n\nfor viewing, downloading and printing.\n\nA copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, except for exhibits, will be furnished without charge to any stockholder upon written or oral request to Ocular Therapeutix, Inc., 34 Crosby Drive, Suite 105, Bedford, MA 01730, Attention: Chief Financial Officer, Telephone: (781) 357-4000.\n\n3\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nMembers of Our Board of Directors\n\nSet forth below are the names and certain biographical information about each member of our board of directors, or board, as of March 31, 2016.

Audit committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and compensation committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act. Under applicable NASDAQ rules, a director will only qualify as an independent director if, in the opinion of the listed companys board of directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In order to be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors, or any other board committee, accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries. In order to be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10C-1, the board must consider, for each member of a compensation committee of a listed company, all factors specifically relevant to determining whether a director has a relationship to such company which is material to that directors ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee member, including, but not limited to: (1) the source of compensation of the director, including any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee paid by such company to the director; and (2) whether the director is affiliated with the company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.\n\nIn March 2016, our board of directors undertook its annual review of the independence of each director. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our board of directors has determined that each of our directors, with the exception of Dr. Sawhney and Mr. Chadha, is an independent director as defined under applicable NASDAQ rules, including, in the case of all the members of our audit committee, the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and in the case of all the members of our compensation committee, the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act. In making such determination, our board of directors considered the relationships that each such non-employee director has with Ocular Therapeutix, including each of the transactions described below in Board PoliciesRelated Person Transactions, and all other facts and circumstances that our board of directors deemed relevant in determining his or her independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director. Dr. Sawhney is not an independent director under these rules because he is our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Chadha is not an independent director under these rules because of a compensation committee interlock with Axtria, Inc., or Axtria. See Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation for additional information.\n\n7\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThere are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers, except between Dr. Sawhney and Mr. Chadha, who are cousins.\n\nHow Our Board Is Organized\n\nBoard Leadership Structure\n\nDr. Sawhney serves as Chairman of our board and as our President and Chief Executive Officer. Our board believes that combining the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions fosters clear accountability, effective decision-making and alignment of corporate strategy and is the appropriate leadership structure for us at this time. Additionally, our board believes this leadership structure is particularly appropriate for our company given Dr. Sawhneys long history with Ocular Therapeutix, his extensive knowledge of and experience with our business and industry and his ability to effectively identify strategic priorities for us. Our board also believes that Dr. Sawhneys combined role of Chairman and President and Chief Executive Officer promotes effective execution of strategic goals and facilitates information flow between management and our board. Since July 2014, Mr. Warden has served as our Lead Independent Director. As our Lead Independent Director, Mr. Wardens responsibilities include:\n\n chairing any meeting of the independent directors of our board in executive session;\n\n meeting with any director who is not adequately performing his or her duties as a member of our board or any committee;\n\n facilitating communications between other members of our board and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer;\n\n monitoring, with the assistance of our legal advisors, communications from stockholders and other interested parties and providing copies or summaries to the other directors as he considers appropriate;\n\n working with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in the preparation of the agenda for each board meeting and in determining the need for special meetings of the board; and\n\n otherwise consulting with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on matters relating to corporate governance and board performance.\n\nBoard Committees\n\nOur board of directors has established an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee, each of which operates under a charter that has been approved by our board. Copies of the committee charters are posted under the heading Corporate Governance on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at investors.ocutx.com.\n\nAudit Committee\n\nThe members of our audit committee are Bruce Peacock, James Garvey and Charles Warden. Mr. Peacock is the chair of the audit committee. Our audit committees responsibilities include:\n\n appointing, approving the compensation of, and assessing the independence of our registered public accounting firm;\n\n overseeing the work of our independent registered public accounting firm, including through the receipt and consideration of reports from that firm;\n\n reviewing and discussing with management and our independent registered public accounting firm our annual and quarterly financial statements and related disclosures;\n\n monitoring our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and code of business conduct and ethics;\n\n8\n\nTable of Contents\n\n overseeing our internal audit function, if any;\n\n overseeing our risk assessment and risk management policies;\n\n establishing policies regarding hiring employees from our independent registered public accounting firm and procedures for the receipt and retention of accounting related complaints and concerns;\n\n meeting independently with our internal auditing staff, if any, our independent registered public accounting firm and management;\n\n reviewing and approving or ratifying any related person transactions; and\n\n preparing the audit committee report required by SEC rules.\n\nAll audit and non-audit services, other than de minimis non-audit services, to be provided to us by our independent registered public accounting firm must be approved in advance by our audit committee.\n\nOur board of directors has determined that Mr. Peacock is an audit committee financial expert as defined in applicable SEC rules. We believe that the composition of our audit committee meets the requirements for independence under current NASDAQ and SEC rules and regulations.\n\nThe audit committee met four times during 2015.\n\nCompensation Committee\n\nThe members of our compensation committee are Charles Warden, Richard L. Lindstrom, M.D. and Bruce Peacock. Mr. Warden is the chair of the compensation committee. Our compensation committees responsibilities include:\n\n reviewing and approving, or making recommendations to our board of directors with respect to, the compensation of our chief executive officer and our other executive officers;\n\n overseeing an evaluation of our senior executives;\n\n overseeing and administering our cash and equity incentive plans;\n\n reviewing and making recommendations to our board of directors with respect to director compensation;\n\n reviewing and discussing annually with management our Compensation Discussion and Analysis disclosure if and to the extent then required by SEC rules; and\n\n preparing the compensation committee report if and to the extent then required by SEC rules.\n\nThe processes and procedures followed by our compensation committee in considering and determining executive and director compensation are described below under Board ProcessesExecutive and Director Compensation Processes. We believe that the composition of our compensation committee meets the requirements for independence under current NASDAQ and SEC rules and regulations.\n\nThe compensation committee met three times during 2015.\n\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\n\nThe members of our nominating and corporate governance committee are James Garvey and Richard L. Lindstrom, M.D. Mr. Garvey is the chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee. Our nominating and corporate governance committees responsibilities include:\n\n identifying individuals qualified to become members of our board of directors;\n\n9\n\nTable of Contents\n\n recommending to our board of directors the persons to be nominated for election as directors and to each of our boards committees;\n\n reviewing and making recommendations to our board with respect to our board leadership structure;\n\n reviewing and making recommendations to our board with respect to management succession planning;\n\n developing and recommending to our board of directors corporate governance principles; and\n\n overseeing an annual evaluation of our board of directors.\n\nThe nominating and corporate governance committee met three times during 2015. We believe that the composition of our nominating and corporate governance committee meets the requirements for independence under current NASDAQ and SEC rules and regulations.\n\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\n\nFor 2015, the members of our compensation committee were Charles Warden, Richard L. Lindstrom, M.D. and Bruce Peacock. None of the members of our compensation committee is, or has ever been, an officer or employee of Ocular Therapeutix. Dr. Sawhney, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is a member of the board of directors of Axtria. Axtria does not have a standing compensation committee or other board committee performing equivalent functions. Mr. Chadha, who serves on our board of directors, is a director, President and Chief Executive Officer of Axtria. In 2015, Mr. Chadha was not a member of our compensation committee. Except for Dr. Sawhney, none of our executive officers serves as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee, or other committee serving an equivalent function, of any other entity that has one or more of its executive officers serving as a member of our board of directors or our compensation committee.\n\nBoard Meetings and Attendance\n\nOur board of directors met eight times during 2015 and took action by written consent four times. During 2015, each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the number of board meetings and the number of meetings held by all committees of the board on which he then served except for Dr. Heier and Mr. OShea. Dr. Heier, who joined our board of directors in September 2015, attended one of the two board meetings which were held during the remainder of 2015. Mr. OShea joined our board of directors in November 2015 after our last board meeting and, as a result, did not attend any board meetings during 2015.\n\nOur directors are expected to attend our annual meetings of stockholders. In 2015, all of our then-current directors attended our annual meeting of stockholders.\n\nBoard Processes\n\nOversight of Risk\n\nOur board oversees our risk management processes directly and through its committees. Our management is responsible for risk management on a day-to-day basis. The role of our board and its committees is to oversee the risk management activities of management. They fulfill this duty by discussing with management the policies and practices utilized by management in assessing and managing risks and providing input on those policies and practices. In general, our board oversees risk management activities relating to business strategy, acquisitions, capital raising and allocation, organizational structure and certain operational risks; our audit committee oversees risk management activities related to financial controls and legal and compliance risks; our nominating and corporate governance committee oversees risk management activities relating to board composition; and our compensation committee oversees risk management activities relating to our compensation policies and practices and management succession planning. Each committee reports to the full board on a regular basis, including reports with respect to the committees risk oversight activities as appropriate. In addition, since risk issues often overlap, committees from time to time request that the full board discuss particular risks.\n\n10\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDirector Nomination Process\n\nThe process followed by our nominating and corporate governance committee to identify and evaluate director candidates may include requests to board members and others for recommendations, evaluation of the performance on our board and its committees of any existing directors being considered for nomination, consideration of biographical information and background material relating to potential candidates and, particularly in the case of potential candidates who are not then serving on our board, interviews of selected candidates by members of the committee and our board.\n\nIn considering whether to recommend any particular candidate for inclusion in our boards slate of recommended director nominees, our nominating and corporate governance committee applies the criteria set forth in our corporate governance guidelines described below under Corporate Governance Guidelines. Consistent with these criteria, our nominating and corporate governance committee expects every nominee to have the following attributes or characteristics, among others: integrity, honesty, adherence to high ethical standards, business acumen, good judgment and a commitment to understand our business and industry.\n\nAll of the director nominees are currently members of our board of directors. The nominee biographies under Board of DirectorsMembers of Our Board of Directors indicate the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills of each of our current directors that led our nominating and corporate governance committee and our board to conclude he should continue to serve as a director of Ocular Therapeutix. Our nominating and corporate governance committee and our board believe that each of the nominees has the individual attributes and characteristics required of each of our directors, and that the nominees as a group possess the skill sets and specific experience desired of our board as a whole.\n\nOur nominating and corporate governance committee considers the value of diversity when selecting nominees, and believes that our board, taken as a whole, should embody a diverse set of skills, experiences and backgrounds. The committee does not make any particular weighting of diversity or any other characteristic in evaluating nominees and directors.\n\nStockholders may recommend individuals for consideration as potential director candidates by submitting their names, together with appropriate biographical information and background materials, and information with respect to the stockholder or group of stockholders making the recommendation, including the number of shares of common stock owned by such stockholder or group of stockholders, to our Chief Financial Officer at Ocular Therapeutix, Inc., 34 Crosby Drive, Suite 105, Bedford, MA 01730, Attention: Chief Financial Officer. The specific requirements for the information that is required to be provided for such recommendations to be considered are specified in our by-laws and must be received by us no later than the date referenced below in Other MattersDeadline for Submission of Stockholder Proposals for 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Assuming that appropriate biographical and background material has been provided on a timely basis, the nominating and corporate governance committee will evaluate stockholder-recommended candidates by following substantially the same process, and applying substantially the same criteria, as it follows for candidates submitted by others.\n\nCommunications with Stockholders\n\nOur management will give appropriate attention to written communications that are submitted by stockholders, and will respond if and as appropriate. Stockholders may communicate with our management by writing to our Chief Financial Officer at Ocular Therapeutix, Inc., 34 Crosby Drive, Suite 105, Bedford, MA 01730, Attention: Chief Financial Officer, or by calling (781) 357-4000. Additional information about contacting Ocular Therapeutix is posted under the heading IR Contacts on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at investors.ocutx.com.\n\nIn addition, stockholders who wish to communicate with our entire board may do so by writing to Charles Warden, Lead Independent Director, c/o Ocular Therapeutix, Inc., 34 Crosby Drive, Suite 105, Bedford,\n\n11\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMA 01730. Communications will be forwarded to other directors if they relate to substantive matters that the Lead Independent Director considers appropriate for attention by the other directors. In general, communications relating to corporate governance and long-term corporate strategy are more likely to be forwarded than communications relating to ordinary business affairs, personal grievances or matters as to which we tend to receive repetitive or duplicative communications.\n\nExecutive and Director Compensation Processes\n\nOur executive compensation program is administered by the compensation committee of our board of directors, subject to the oversight and approval of our full board of directors. Our compensation committee reviews our executive compensation practices on an annual basis and based on this review approves, or, as appropriate, makes recommendations to our board of directors for approval of our executive compensation program.\n\nIn designing our executive compensation program, our compensation committee considers publicly available compensation data for national and regional companies in the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry to help guide its executive compensation decisions at the time of hiring and for subsequent adjustments in compensation. Since 2014, our compensation committee has retained Radford, an AON Hewitt Company, as its independent compensation consultant, to provide comparative data on executive compensation practices in our industry and to advise on our executive compensation program generally. The committee also has retained Radford for guidelines and review of non-employee director compensation. Although our compensation committee considers the advice and guidelines of Radford as to our executive compensation program, our compensation committee ultimately makes their own decisions about these matters. In the future, we expect that our compensation committee will continue to engage independent compensation consultants to provide additional guidance on our executive compensation programs and to conduct further competitive benchmarking against a peer group of publicly traded companies.\n\nIn March 2016, the compensation committee reviewed information regarding the independence and potential conflicts of interest of Radford, taking into account, among other things, the factors set forth in the NASDAQ listing standards. Based on such review, the committee concluded that the engagement of Radford did not raise any conflict of interest. Outside of services provided for the compensation committee, the compensation consultant provided nominal additional services to the company in 2014 related to benchmarking data with respect to certain non-executive positions in an effort to ensure that our compensation is competitive so that we can attract, reward, motivate and retain all employees. The total amount paid to Radford in connection with these additional engagements was less than $120,000 in 2015.\n\nOur director compensation program is administered by our board of directors with the assistance of the compensation committee. The compensation committee conducts an annual review of director compensation and makes recommendations to the board with respect thereto.\n\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\n\nOur board of directors has adopted corporate governance guidelines to assist in the exercise of its duties and responsibilities and to serve the best interests of Ocular Therapeutix and our stockholders. The guidelines provide that:\n\n our boards principal responsibility is to oversee the management of Ocular Therapeutix;\n\n a majority of the members of our board must be independent directors;\n\n the independent directors meet in executive session at least twice a year;\n\n directors have full and free access to management and, as necessary, independent advisors;\n\n12\n\nTable of Contents\n\n new directors participate in an orientation program and all directors are expected to participate in continuing director education on an ongoing basis; and\n\n our board will conduct an annual self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees are functioning effectively.\n\nA copy of the corporate governance guidelines is posted under the heading Corporate Governance on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at investors.ocutx.com.\n\nBoard Policies\n\nRelated Person Transactions\n\nOur board of directors has adopted written policies and procedures for the review of any transaction, arrangement or relationship in which Ocular Therapeutix is a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and one of our executive officers, directors, director nominees or 5% stockholders, or their immediate family members, each of whom we refer to as a related person, has a direct or indirect material interest.\n\nIf a related person proposes to enter into such a transaction, arrangement or relationship, which we refer to as a related person transaction, the related person must report the proposed related person transaction to our Chief Financial Officer. The policy calls for the proposed related person transaction to be reviewed and, if deemed appropriate, approved by our audit committee. Whenever practicable, the reporting, review and approval will occur prior to entry into the transaction. If advance review and approval is not practicable, the committee will review, and, in its discretion, may ratify the related person transaction. The policy also permits the chairman of the audit committee to review and, if deemed appropriate, approve proposed related person transactions that arise between committee meetings, subject to ratification by the committee at its next meeting. Any related person transactions that are ongoing in nature will be reviewed annually.\n\nA related person transaction reviewed under the policy will be considered approved or ratified if it is authorized by the audit committee after full disclosure of the related persons interest in the transaction. As appropriate for the circumstances, the audit committee will review and consider:\n\n the related persons interest in the related person transaction;\n\n the approximate dollar value of the amount involved in the related person transaction;\n\n the approximate dollar value of the amount of the related persons interest in the transaction without regard to the amount of any profit or loss;\n\n whether the transaction was undertaken in the ordinary course of our business;\n\n whether the terms of the transaction are no less favorable to us than terms that could have been reached with an unrelated third party;\n\n the purpose of, and the potential benefits to us of, the transaction; and\n\n any other information regarding the related person transaction or the related person in the context of the proposed transaction that would be material to investors in light of the circumstances of the particular transaction.\n\nOur audit committee may approve or ratify the transaction only if it determines that, under all of the circumstances, the transaction is in our best interests. Our audit committee may impose any conditions on the related person transaction that it deems appropriate.\n\nIn addition to the transactions that are excluded by the instructions to the SECs related person transaction disclosure rule, our board of directors has determined that the following transactions do not create a material\n\n13\n\nTable of Contents\n\ndirect or indirect interest on behalf of related persons and, therefore, are not related person transactions for purposes of this policy:\n\n interests arising solely from the related persons position as an executive officer of another entity, whether or not the person is also a director of the entity, that is a participant in the transaction where the related person and all other related persons own in the aggregate less than a 10% equity interest in such entity, the related person and his or her immediate family members are not involved in the negotiation of the terms of the transaction and do not receive any special benefits as a result of the transaction and the amount involved in the transaction is less than the greater of $200,000 or 5% of the annual gross revenues of the company receiving payment under the transaction; and\n\n a transaction that is specifically contemplated by provisions of our certificate of incorporation or by-laws.\n\nThe policy provides that transactions involving compensation of executive officers shall be reviewed and approved by our compensation committee in the manner specified in the compensation committees charter.\n\nSince January 1, 2015, we have engaged in the following transactions with our executive officers, directors and holders of more than 5% of our voting securities, and affiliates of our executive officers, directors and 5% stockholders. We believe that all of the transactions described below were made on terms no less favorable to us than could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties:\n\nIncept License Agreement\n\nSince January 2012, we have been party to an amended and restated license agreement with Incept, LLC, or Incept, an intellectual property holding company. Dr. Sawhney, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is a general partner of Incept and has a 50% ownership stake in Incept. Farhad Khosravi, who served as a member of our board of directors until June 2013, is also a general partner of Incept and has a 50% ownership stake in Incept. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we hold an exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable license under specified patents and technology owned or controlled by Incept to make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, sublicense, have sublicensed, offer for sublicense and import, products delivered to or around the human eye for diagnostic, therapeutic or prophylactic purposes relating to all human ophthalmic diseases or conditions. This license covers all of the patent rights and a significant portion of the technology for ReSure Sealant and our hydrogel platform technology product candidates. We are obligated to pay Incept a royalty equal to a low single-digit percentage of net sales made by us or our affiliates. Any sublicensee of ours also will be obligated to pay Incept a royalty equal to a low single-digit percentage of net sales made by it and will be bound by the terms of the agreement to the same extent as we are. In 2015, we paid $34,807 in royalties to Incept pursuant to the license agreement.\n\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\n\nOur board of directors has adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that applies to our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. A copy of the code of business conduct and ethics is posted under the heading Corporate Governance on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is located at investors.ocutx.com. In addition, we intend to post on our website all disclosures that are required by law or the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules concerning any amendments to, or waivers from, any provision of our code of business conduct and ethics.\n\n14\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n\nThe following table sets forth information regarding our executive officers as of March 31, 2016:\n\nName Age Position\n\nAmarpreet Sawhney, Ph.D.\n\n49 President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nW.

The shares vested on an equal monthly basis over 12 months starting on January 1, 2014.\n\n(7) Consists of (i) a stock grant to Dr. Sawhney of 25,094 shares of our common stock in February 2014 in recognition of his performance during 2013, (ii) a stock grant to Dr. Sawhney of 28,437 shares of our restricted common stock in lieu of payment of a portion of the base salary to which Dr. Sawhney will be entitled in 2015, and (iii) the incremental value of $429,574 received by Dr. Sawhney for the grant to him of 94,696 shares of our restricted common stock in excess of the $402,917 portion of his 2014 salary foregone.\n\n(8) Mr. Smith was appointed as our Chief Financial Officer in March 2014.\n\n(9) Includes an option granted to Mr. Fortune to purchase 7,339 shares of our common stock in February 2014 in recognition of his performance during 2013.\n\n16\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNarrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table\n\nBase Salary\n\nIn 2015, we paid annualized base salaries of $522,500 to Dr. Sawhney; $333,531 to Mr. Smith; and $388,348 to Mr. Fortune. In 2014, we paid annualized base salaries of $233,000, which was increased to $500,000 in June 2014, to Dr. Sawhney; $325,000 to Mr. Smith; and $375,000 to Mr. Fortune. In 2016, we increased the base salaries of these officers as follows: Dr. Sawhney: $540,788; Mr. Smith: $345,205; and Mr. Fortune: $401,940. In February 2014, we granted Dr. Sawhney 94,696 shares of restricted common stock, which grant was in lieu of a portion of his 2014 base salary. In April 2014, we granted Dr. Sawhney 28,437 shares of restricted common stock, which grant was in lieu of $250,000 of his base salary for 2015. Due to an administrative error, we did not appropriately adjust Dr. Sawhneys 2015 base salary in our payroll system to reflect this reduction. As a result, we paid him his full base salary of $522,500 in cash for 2015. Upon discovery of the error, and based on a recommendation from our compensation committee, Dr. Sawhney promptly repaid the full $250,000 to us on April 1, 2016.\n\nNone of our named executive officers is currently party to an employment agreement or other agreement or arrangement that provides for automatic or scheduled increases in base salary.\n\nAnnual Performance-Based Compensation\n\nWe do not have a formal performance-based bonus plan. From time to time, our board of directors has approved discretionary annual cash bonuses to our named executive officers with respect to their prior year performance. In the first quarter of 2016, we paid discretionary annual cash bonuses of $201,163 to Dr. Sawhney; $95,056 to Mr. Smith; and $110,679 to Mr. Fortune in recognition of their performance in 2015. In the first quarter of 2015, we paid discretionary annual cash bonuses of $288,750 to Dr. Sawhney; $76,781 to Mr. Smith; and $135,077 to Mr. Fortune in recognition of their performance in 2014.\n\nEquity Incentive Awards\n\nAlthough we do not have a formal policy with respect to the grant of equity incentive awards to our executive officers, or any formal equity ownership guidelines applicable to them, we believe that equity grants provide our executives with a strong link to our long-term performance, create an ownership culture and help to align the interests of our executives and our stockholders. In addition, we believe that equity grants with a time-based vesting feature promote executive retention because this feature incents our executive officers to remain in our employment during the vesting period. Accordingly, our board of directors periodically reviews the equity incentive compensation of our named executive officers and from time to time may grant equity incentive awards to them in the form of stock options or common stock.\n\nWe have historically granted stock options with exercise prices that are set at no less than the fair market value of shares of our common stock on the date of grant as determined by contemporaneous valuations and reviewed and approved by our compensation committee or our board of directors.\n\nIn February 2014, we granted to Mr. Fortune an option to purchase 7,339 shares of our common stock in recognition of his performance during 2013 and a stock award to Dr. Sawhney of 25,094 shares of our common stock in recognition of his performance during 2013. In March 2014, we granted Mr. Smith options to purchase in the aggregate 123,105 shares of our common stock upon his appointment as our Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Sawhney options to purchase in the aggregate 75,757 shares of our common stock and Mr. Fortune options to purchase in the aggregate 66,287 shares of our common stock. In April 2014, we granted Dr. Sawhney an option to purchase 47,348 shares of our common stock. The following table sets forth information regarding our option grants in 2014 to Dr. Sawhney, Mr. Smith and Mr. Fortune.\n\n17\n\nTable of Contents\n\nName Equity Award(#)\n\nExercise Price\n\nper share\n\nAmarpreet Sawhney\n\n75,757\n\n47,348 $\n\n$\n\n(1\n\n8.80\n\n)\n\nW.

intended to be an incentive stock option.\n\n(20) These shares represent the portion of such option grant intended to be a non-qualified stock option.\n\nEmployment Agreements with Executive Officers\n\nIn June and July 2014, we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Dr. Sawhney and employment agreements with Mr. Smith, Mr. Fortune and Mr. Ankerud. Each of these agreements provides that employment will continue until either we or the executive provides written notice of termination in accordance with the terms of the agreement. In addition, each of these agreements prohibits the executives from disclosing confidential information and competing with us during the term of their employment and for a specified time thereafter.\n\nPursuant to their respective employment agreements, each of these executives is entitled to receive a minimum annual base salary as follows: Dr. Sawhney: $500,000; Mr. Smith: $325,000; Mr. Fortune: $375,000; and Mr. Ankerud: $330,000. On February 12, 2014, we granted to Dr. Sawhney 94,696 shares of restricted common stock, which grant is in lieu of payment of a portion of Dr. Sawhneys base salary for 2014. On April 14, 2014, we granted to Dr. Sawhney 28,437 shares of restricted common stock, which grant is in lieu of payment of a portion of the base salary to which Dr. Sawhney was entitled for 2015. Due to an administrative error, we did not appropriately adjust Dr. Sawhneys 2015 base salary in our payroll system to reflect this reduction. As a result, we paid him his full base salary of $522,500 in cash for 2015. Upon discovery of the error, and based on a recommendation from our compensation committee, Dr. Sawhney promptly repaid the full $250,000 to us on April 1, 2016.\n\nIn addition, each of these executives is eligible to receive an annual cash bonus, which is based on the achievement of individual and corporate performance objectives that are determined by our Compensation Committee following the end of each year, calculated as a percentage of the executives annual base salary, and which will be determined by our board of directors, in its sole discretion. The target annual bonus, as a percentage of annual base salary, for each of these executives is as follows: Dr. Sawhney: 55%; Mr. Smith: 40%; Mr. Fortune: 40%; and Mr. Ankerud: 35%.\n\nDr. Sawhneys amended and restated employment agreement provides for the assignment of all intellectual property he solely or jointly develops to Incept, LLC.\n\nPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control Transaction\n\nUpon execution and effectiveness of a release of claims, each of our executives will be entitled to severance payments if his employment is terminated under specified circumstances.\n\nDr. Sawhney. If we terminate Dr. Sawhneys employment without cause, as defined in his employment agreement, or if Dr. Sawhney terminates his employment with us for good reason, as defined in his employment agreement, absent a change in control, or corporate change, as defined in his employment agreement, we are obligated to pay Dr. Sawhneys base salary for a period of 18 months and, to the extent allowed by applicable law and the terms of the applicable policies, to continue to provide Dr. Sawhney and certain of his dependents with group health insurance for a period of 18 months. In addition, to the extent any shares of restricted stock\n\n21\n\nTable of Contents\n\ngranted to Dr. Sawhney in lieu of his base salary, as described above, remain unvested as of his termination, such shares will continue to vest during the 18-month severance period as if Dr. Sawhney had continued to be employed through the end of such period.\n\nIf we terminate Dr. Sawhneys employment without cause or if Dr. Sawhney terminates his employment with us for good reason, in each case within 12 months following a corporate change, we are obligated to pay Dr. Sawhney in a lump sum an amount equal to his base salary for 24 months, to pay Dr. Sawhney an amount equal to two times his target annual bonus for the year of termination, to accelerate in full the vesting of all of Dr. Sawhneys outstanding equity awards and, to the extent allowed by applicable law and the terms of the applicable policies, to continue to provide Dr. Sawhney and certain of his dependents with group health insurance for a period of 24 months.\n\nOther Executive Officers. For each of Mr. Smith, Mr. Fortune and Mr. Ankerud, if we terminate such executives employment without cause, as defined in such executives employment agreement, or if the executive terminates his employment with us for good reason, as defined in such executives employment agreement, absent a change in control, or corporate change, as defined in such executives employment agreement, we are obligated to pay such executives base salary for a period of 12 months and, to the extent allowed by applicable law and the terms of the applicable policies, to continue to provide such executive and certain of his dependents with group health insurance for a period of 12 months.\n\nIf we terminate Mr. Smith, Mr. Fortune or Mr. Ankerud without cause or if such executive terminates his employment with us for good reason, in each case within 12 months following a corporate change, we are obligated to pay to such executive in a lump sum an amount equal to his base salary for 18 months, to pay to such executive an amount equal to one and one-half times his target annual bonus for the year of termination, to accelerate in full the vesting of all outstanding equity awards held by such executive and, to the extent allowed by applicable law and the terms of the applicable policies, to continue to provide such executive and certain of his dependents with group health insurance for a period of 18 months.\n\nTaxation. To the extent that any severance or other compensation payment to any of Dr. Sawhney, Mr. Smith, Mr. Fortune or Mr. Ankerud pursuant to his employment agreement or any other agreement constitutes an excess parachute payment within the meaning of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, then such executive will receive the full amount of such severance and other payments, or a reduced amount intended to avoid the application of Sections 280G and 4999, whichever provides the executive with the highest amount on an after-tax basis.\n\nEquity Incentive Plans\n\nThe three equity incentive plans described in this section are our 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, or the 2006 Plan; our 2014 Plan; and our 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2014 ESPP. Prior to our initial public offering, which closed on July 30, 2014, we granted awards to eligible participants under the 2006 Plan. Following the closing of our initial public offering, we ceased granting awards under the 2006 Plan and started granting awards to eligible participants under the 2014 Plan and the 2014 ESPP.\n\n2006 Stock Incentive Plan\n\nThe 2006 Plan provided for the grant of incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, non-statutory stock options and stock grants. Our key employees, officers, directors, and consultants, as well as key employees, officers, directors, and consultants of our affiliates and certain other strategic partners, were eligible to receive awards under our 2006 Plan. However, incentive stock options could only be granted to our key employees. The terms of awards were set forth in the applicable award agreements. Our board of directors may amend our 2006 Plan at any time, subject in certain circumstances to stockholder approval. Stockholders may terminate our 2006 Plan at any time. Subject to certain limitations with respect to\n\n22\n\nTable of Contents\n\nincentive stock options, our board of directors may accelerate the exercise date of any installment of any option under the 2006 Plan, and may amend the terms or conditions of an outstanding option or stock grant under the 2006 Plan, subject to participant consent of any amendment that is adverse to the participant.\n\nAwards under our 2006 Plan are subject to adjustment in the event of certain corporate transactions affecting our common stock such as stock splits, stock dividends or similar transactions. In the event of a recapitalization or reorganization (other than an Acquisition, as described below) pursuant to which our securities or securities of another corporation are issued with respect to outstanding shares of our common stock, a participant, upon exercising or accepting an option or stock grant under the 2006 Plan, will be entitled to receive, for the purchase price, if any, paid upon such exercise or acceptance, the securities which would have been received if such option or stock grant had been exercised or accepted prior to such recapitalization or reorganization.\n\nIn the event of an Acquisition (as defined in the 2006 Plan) of us, our board of directors (or the board of the entity assuming our obligations under the 2006 Plan) shall take one of the following actions pursuant to the 2006 Plan, as to outstanding options:\n\n make appropriate provision for the continuation of outstanding options by substituting on an equitable basis for the shares then subject to outstanding options either the consideration payable with respect to the outstanding shares of common stock in connection with the Acquisition or securities of any successor or acquiring entity;\n\n upon written notice to participants, provide that all outstanding options must be exercised (to the extent then exercisable after taking into account any applicable acceleration of vesting) and that unexercised options will terminate within a specified time period of such notice; or\n\n terminate all outstanding options in exchange for a cash payment equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares subject to such options (to the extent then exercisable after taking into account any applicable acceleration of vesting) over the exercise price thereof.\n\nIn the event of an Acquisition of us, our board of directors (or the board of the entity assuming our obligations under the 2006 Plan) shall take one of the following actions pursuant to the 2006 Plan, as to outstanding stock grants:\n\n make appropriate provisions for the continuation of outstanding stock grants by substituting on an equitable basis for the shares then subject to outstanding stock grants either the consideration payable with respect to the outstanding shares of common stock in connection with the Acquisition or securities of any successor or acquiring entity;\n\n upon written notice to participants, provide that all outstanding stock grants must be accepted (to the extent then subject to acceptance) and that unaccepted stock grants will terminate within a specified number of days of the date of such notice; or\n\n terminate all outstanding stock grants in exchange for a cash payment equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares subject to such stock grant over the purchase price thereof, if any.\n\nIn addition, in the event of an Acquisition of us, our board of directors may waive all or any repurchase rights with respect to outstanding stock grants.\n\nAs of March 31, 2016, under our 2006 Plan, there were options to purchase an aggregate of 1,378,653 shares of common stock outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $5.16 per share. We will grant no further stock options or other awards under our 2006 Plan. However, any shares of common stock subject to awards under our 2006 Plan that expire, terminate, or are otherwise surrendered, cancelled, forfeited or repurchased without having been fully exercised or resulting in any common stock being issued will become available for issuance under our 2014 Plan, up to a specified number of shares.\n\n23\n\nTable of Contents\n\n2014 Stock Incentive Plan\n\nOur 2014 Plan, which became effective on July 30, 2014, was adopted by our board of directors and approved by our stockholders in June 2014.

As of March 31, 2016, 1,575,503 shares were available for issuance under the 2014 Plan.\n\nOur employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors are eligible to receive awards under the 2014 Plan. However, incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees.\n\nSubject to any limitation in the 2014 Plan, our board of directors or any committee or officer to which our board of directors has delegated authority will select the recipients of awards and determine:\n\n the number of shares of common stock covered by options and stock appreciation rights and the dates upon which those awards become exercisable;\n\n the type of options to be granted;\n\n the exercise price of options and measurement price of stock appreciation rights, neither of which may be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date;\n\n the duration of options and stock appreciation rights, which may not be in excess of ten years;\n\n the methods of payment of the exercise price of options; and\n\n the number of shares of common stock subject to any restricted stock awards, restricted stock units or other stock-based awards and the terms and conditions of such awards, including the issue price, conditions for repurchase, repurchase price and performance conditions, if any.\n\nOur board of directors has delegated authority to our Chief Executive Officer to grant awards under the 2014 Plan to all new hires, other than executive officers, subject to any limitations under the 2014 Plan. Our board of directors has established the terms of the awards to be granted by our Chief Executive Officer, including the exercise price of such awards (which may include a formula by which the exercise price will be determined), and the maximum number of shares subject to awards that such executive officer may make.\n\nAwards under the 2014 Plan are subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, reclassification of shares, spin-off or other similar change in our capitalization or event or any dividend or distribution to holders of our common stock other than an ordinary cash dividend.\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUpon a merger or other reorganization event (as defined in the 2014 Plan), our board of directors, may, in its sole discretion, take any one or more of the following actions pursuant to the 2014 Plan, as to some or all outstanding awards, other than restricted stock:\n\n provide that all outstanding awards will be assumed, or substantially equivalent awards shall be substituted, by the acquiring or successor corporation or an affiliate thereof;\n\n upon written notice to a participant, provide that the participants unvested and/or unexercised options or awards will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction unless exercised by the participant;\n\n provide that outstanding awards will become exercisable, realizable or deliverable, or restrictions applicable to an award will lapse, in whole or in part, prior to or upon the reorganization event;\n\n in the event of a reorganization event pursuant to which holders of our common stock will receive a cash payment for each share surrendered in the reorganization event, make or provide for a cash payment to the participants with respect to each award held by the participant equal to (1) the number of shares of our common stock subject to the vested portion of the award, after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting that occurs upon or immediately prior to such reorganization event, multiplied by (2) the excess, if any, of the cash payment for each share surrendered in the reorganization event over the exercise, measurement or purchase price of such award and any applicable tax withholdings, in exchange for the termination of such awards; and\n\n provide that, in connection with a liquidation or dissolution, awards convert into the right to receive liquidation proceeds.\n\nIn the case of specified restricted stock units, no assumption or substitution is permitted, and the restricted stock units will instead be settled in accordance with the terms of the applicable restricted stock unit agreement.\n\nUpon the occurrence of a reorganization event other than a liquidation or dissolution, the repurchase and other rights under each outstanding restricted stock award will continue for the benefit of the successor company and will, unless our board of directors may otherwise determine, apply to the cash, securities or other property into which our common stock is converted pursuant to the reorganization event. Upon the occurrence of a reorganization event involving a liquidation or dissolution, all restrictions and conditions on each outstanding restricted stock award will automatically be deemed terminated or satisfied, unless otherwise provided in the agreement evidencing the restricted stock award.\n\nAt any time, our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, provide that any award under the 2014 Plan will become immediately exercisable in full or in part, free of some or all restrictions or conditions, or otherwise realizable in full or in part.\n\nAs of March 31, 2016, under our 2014 Plan, there were options to purchase an aggregate of 1,580,016 shares of common stock outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $15.70 per share.
