BUSINESS\n\nGENERAL\n\nWe are a biotechnology company that develops innovative products and\n\nservices for major unmet medical needs. We were founded in 1981 and became a\n\nMassachusetts corporation in 1991. We currently have four operating divisions.\n\nEach of our divisions has its own outstanding series of common stock that is\n\nintended to reflect its value and track its financial performance. Our four\n\ndivisions are:\n\n- Genzyme General, which develops and markets therapeutic products and\n\ndiagnostic products and services, with an emphasis on therapies for\n\ngenetic diseases. Genzyme General Division Common Stock is listed on the\n\nNasdaq National Market-TM- under the symbol \"GENZ.\"\n\n- Genzyme Molecular Oncology, which is developing cancer products, with a\n\nfocus on cancer vaccines and angiogenesis inhibitors. It is shaping these\n\nnew therapies through the integration of its genomics, gene discovery,\n\ncell therapy, gene therapy, small molecule drug discovery, and protein\n\ntherapeutic efforts. Genzyme Molecular Oncology Division Common Stock is\n\nlisted on Nasdaq under the symbol \"GZMO.\"\n\n- Genzyme Surgical Products, which develops and markets a portfolio of\n\ndevices, biomaterials and biotherapeutics for the cardiothoracic and\n\ngeneral surgery markets. Genzyme Surgical Products Division Common Stock\n\nis listed on Nasdaq under the symbol \"GZSP.\"\n\n- Genzyme Tissue Repair, which develops and markets biological products for\n\northopedic injuries, such as cartilage damage, and severe burns. Genzyme\n\nTissue Repair Division Common Stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol\n\n\"GZTR.\"\n\nWe allocate all of our products, services, programs, assets and liabilities\n\namong our divisions for purposes of financial statement presentation; however,\n\nGenzyme, the corporation, continues to own all of the assets and is responsible\n\nfor all of the liabilities allocated to each of the divisions.\n\nRECENT DEVELOPMENT\n\nIn March 2000, we announced our intention to create a new division called\n\nGenzyme Biosurgery by combining Genzyme Surgical Products and Genzyme Tissue\n\nRepair in tax-free stock exchanges to form one division, and then acquiring\n\nBiomatrix Inc. in an exchange of stock and approximately $245 million in cash.\n\nBiomatrix is a worldwide leader in the development and manufacture of\n\nviscoelastic biomaterials for use in orthopedic and other medical applications.\n\nThe new division will have its own newly created series of stock that will be\n\ntraded on Nasdaq.\n\nThe transaction will unite three leaders in the rapidly emerging market for\n\nsophisticated biomaterials and biotherapeutics products that are used in\n\nsurgical and medical procedures. Its focus will be on bio-cardiology,\n\nbio-orthopedics and neurology platforms. The new division will begin with a\n\nportfolio of 22 significant marketed products, including Biomatrix's\n\nSynvisc-Registered Trademark- treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee, and a\n\nstrong pipeline of ten products in various stages of development.\n\nWe expect the transaction to close by the end of June 2000, pending\n\nregulatory and shareholder approvals. Our board of directors and the Board of\n\nDirectors of Biomatrix each have unanimously approved the merger. The merger is\n\nsubject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. The\n\ntransaction will require the approval of Biomatrix's shareholders and all of our\n\nshareholders, including separate approvals of Genzyme Surgical Products and\n\nGenzyme Tissue Repair shareholders, and is subject to customary closing\n\nconditions.\n\n5\n\nGENZYME GENERAL--PRODUCTS AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\n\nGenzyme General primarily consists of two business units, Therapeutics and\n\nDiagnostics. The Therapeutics business unit focuses on developing and marketing\n\nproducts for genetic diseases, including a family of diseases known as lysosomal\n\nstorage diseases, and specialty therapeutics. The Diagnostics business unit\n\ndevelops, markets and distributes IN VITRO diagnostic products and genetic\n\ntesting services.\n\nTHERAPEUTICS\n\nThe Therapeutics business unit currently has three therapeutics products on\n\nthe market and several other products in varying stages of development. The\n\nfollowing chart contains information about many of these products and product\n\ncandidates.\n\nPRODUCT INDICATION STATUS COLLABORATOR OR LICENSOR\n\n- ---------------------------------------- --------------------- --------------------- ------------------------\n\nCEREDASE-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- Type I Gaucher Marketed since 1991 None\n\n(ALGLUCERASE FOR INJECTION) AND disease and 1995,\n\nCEREZYME-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- respectively;\n\n(IMIGLUCERASE FOR INJECTION) available in 55\n\ncountries\n\nRENAGEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- CAPSULES Reduction of serum Marketed since 1998; GelTex Pharmaceuticals,\n\n(SEVELAMER HYDROCHLORIDE) phosphorus in approved in the U.S. Inc.*\n\npatients with in 1998, Israel in\n\nend-stage renal 1999 and in Europe in\n\ndisease 2000\n\nTHYROGEN-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- HORMONE Use in follow-up Marketed since 1998; None\n\nscreening of patients approved in the U.S.\n\nwho have been treated in 1998 and Brazil in\n\nfor thyroid cancer 2000\n\nFABRAZYME-TM- (AFGALSIDASE BETA FOR Fabry disease Pivotal trial None\n\nINJECTION) completed; BLA\n\nsubmission planned\n\nfor first half of\n\n2000\n\nTRANSGENIC ANTITHROMBIN III Heparin resistance One Phase III trial Genzyme Transgenics\n\nsuccessfully Corporation*\n\ncompleted; a\n\nconfirmatory Phase\n\nIII trial ongoing\n\nALDURAZYME-TM- (ALRONIDASE FOR Mucopolysaccharidosis-I One Phase III trial BioMarin Pharmaceutical,\n\nINJECTION) successfully Inc.*\n\ncompleted; a\n\nconfirmatory Phase\n\nIII trial planned for\n\n2000\n\nRENAGEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- TABLETS Dialysis Phase III trial GelTex Pharmaceuticals,\n\nongoing Inc.*\n\nRENAGEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- CAPSULES Hemodialysis (Europe) Phase III trial GelTex Pharmaceuticals,\n\nongoing Inc.*\n\nAVONEX-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- Relapsing/remitting Pivotal trial planned Biogen, Inc.\n\n(INTERFERON-BETA 1A) forms of multiple for first half of\n\nsclerosis in Japan 2000\n\n6\n\nPRODUCT INDICATION STATUS COLLABORATOR OR LICENSOR\n\n- ---------------------------------------- --------------------- --------------------- ------------------------\n\nNEUROCELL-TM--PD Parkinson's disease Phase II trial Diacrin, Inc.*\n\ncompleted\n\nNEUROCELL-TM--HD Huntington's disease Phase I trial Diacrin, Inc.*\n\ncompleted\n\nTRANSGENIC ALPHA-GLUCOSIDASE Pompe disease Phase II pilot trial Pharming Group N.V.*\n\nin Europe ongoing\n\nGENE THERAPY Gaucher disease Phase I trial ongoing University of Pittsburgh\n\nDHA DERIVATIVE (GENZ 66055) Cystic fibrosis Clinical trial Beth Israel Deaconess\n\nplanned for 2000 Medical Center\n\nEPI-KAL2 Hereditary angioedema Clinical trial Dyax Corp.\n\nplanned for 2000\n\nACID SPHINGOMYELINASE Type B Niemann-Pick Clinical trial Mt.

It also produces and sells bulk hyaluronic acid\n\nfor a number of applications. Under an agreement with Alcon Laboratories, Inc.,\n\nGenzyme General supplies pharmaceutical-grade hyaluronic acid powder to Alcon\n\nfor incorporation into Provisc-Registered Trademark-, an ophthalmic surgical aid\n\nproduct. In addition, hyaluronic acid is sold to a number of customers for\n\nvarious research and development applications.\n\nWe have provided more details on our therapeutic products and our late-stage\n\ndevelopment programs below.\n\nCEREZYME-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- (IMIGLUCERASE FOR\n\nINJECTION)/CEREDASE-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- (ALGLUCERASE FOR\n\nINJECTION). Treatment with Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme or\n\nCeredase-Registered Trademark- enzyme replacement therapy currently represents\n\nthe only safe and effective treatment available for Type I Gaucher disease, a\n\nlysosomal storage disease. We entered the market in 1991 with\n\nCeredase-Registered Trademark- enzyme. Because production of\n\nCeredase-Registered Trademark- enzyme was subject to supply constraints, we\n\ndeveloped Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme, a recombinant form of human\n\nalpha glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme that is deficient in Gaucher patients.\n\nRecombinant technology uses specially engineered cells to produce enzymes, or\n\nother substances, by inserting into cells of one organism the genetic material\n\nof a different species. In the case of Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme,\n\nChinese hamster ovary cells are engineered to produce human alpha\n\nglucocerebrosidase. We stopped producing Ceredase-Registered Trademark- enzyme,\n\nexcept for small quantities, during 1998 after substantially all patients who\n\npreviously used Ceredase-Registered Trademark- enzyme were converted to\n\nCerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme.\n\n7\n\nGenzyme General is marketing these products directly to physicians,\n\nhospitals and treatment centers worldwide through a highly trained sales force.\n\nThis marketing effort is directed at identifying and initiating treatment for\n\nthe estimated 5,000 Gaucher patients Genzyme General believes exist worldwide.\n\nGenzyme General received marketing approval for Cerezyme-Registered Trademark-\n\nenzyme in five countries as well as the 15 countries forming the European Union\n\nand for Ceredase-Registered Trademark- enzyme in 13 countries. Our results of\n\noperations are highly dependent on sales of these products. Sales of\n\nCerezyme-Registered Trademark- and Ceredase-Registered Trademark- enzymes\n\ntotaled approximately $479 million in 1999, which represented approximately 70%\n\nof Genzyme's product revenue in that year. Sales of these products totaled\n\n$411 million, or 67% of Genzyme's product revenue, in 1998 and $333 million, or\n\n67% of Genzyme's product revenue, in 1997.\n\nRENAGEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- (SEVELAMER\n\nHYDROCHLORIDE). Renagel-Registered Trademark- capsules are used for the\n\nreduction of serum phosphorus in patients with end-stage renal disease. There\n\nare an estimated 280,000 end-stage renal failure patients in the United States,\n\napproximately 95% of whom receive a phosphate control product. There are also an\n\nestimated 170,000 end-stage renal failure patents in Europe. In connection with\n\nour joint venture with GelTex Pharmaceuticals, Genzyme General is marketing\n\nRenagel-Registered Trademark- capsules directly to nephrologists, renal\n\ndieticians and payors through a dedicated sales force. It plans to launch\n\nRenagel-Registered Trademark- capsules on a country-by-country basis in Europe\n\nduring 2000 following receipt of pricing and reimbursement approvals. Genzyme\n\nGeneral and GelTex Pharmaceuticals are also developing a new tablet form of the\n\nRenaGel-Registered Trademark- product designed to have a higher potency and to\n\nbe smaller and more convenient than the capsule form.\n\nTHYROGEN-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- (THYROTROPIN ALFA FOR\n\nINJECTION). Thyrogen-Registered Trademark- hormone was developed by Genzyme\n\nGeneral to allow patients to continue taking their thyroid hormone supplements\n\nwhile they are being screened for metastases. This allows patients to avoid the\n\ndebilitating effects of hypothyroidism. In the United States, physicians order\n\napproximately 135,000 thyroglobulin tests and 25,000 radioiodine imaging whole\n\nbody scans each year for thyroid cancer patients. Thyrogen-Registered Trademark-\n\nhormone is being co-marketed in the United States under an agreement with Knoll\n\nPharmaceutical Company. Brazil has the highest incidence of thyroid cancer in\n\nthe developed world, outside of the United States. Physicians order\n\napproximately 28,000 thyroglobulin tests and 12,000 radioiodine imaging whole\n\nbody scans each year in Brazil for thyroid cancer patients. Biobras S.A. will\n\nexclusively distribute and market the product in Brazil.\n\nFABRAZYME-TM- (ALGALSIDASE BETA FOR INJECTION). Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme is a\n\nrecombinant form of the human enzyme alpha-galactosidase. Genzyme General is\n\ndeveloping Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme as a treatment for Fabry disease. Fabry disease\n\nis a lysosomal storage disease that is estimated to affect 1 in 40,000 males\n\nworldwide, with an estimated 2,000 to 4,000 patients worldwide. Genzyme General\n\nhas completed a multi-center pivotal clinical trial of Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme and\n\nintends to file for regulatory approval in the United States in the first half\n\nof 2000.\n\nANTITHROMBIN III. Antithrombin III, also known as ATIII, is a protein\n\nnaturally produced by the body that, when bound to heparin, prevents blood\n\nclotting. Genzyme General and Genzyme Transgenics are developing\n\ntransgenically-produced recombinant ATIII. Transgenic proteins are produced by\n\ninserting human DNA into animal cells so that the target protein, or drug, is\n\nsecreted into the milk of female offspring during lactation. Genzyme General and\n\nGenzyme Transgenics successfully completed a Phase III clinical trial of\n\ntransgenic ATIII to restore heparin sensitivity in heparin-resistant patients\n\nundergoing elective heart surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. An on going\n\nconfirmatory Phase III clinical trial is designed to compare transgenic ATIII to\n\nplasma-derived ATIII and is scheduled to conclude in 2000. Genzyme currently\n\nowns approximately 30% of the outstanding shares of Genzyme Transgenics common\n\nstock.\n\nALDURAZYME-TM- (ALRONIDASE FOR INJECTION). Genzyme General's partner\n\nBioMarin Pharmaceutical successfully completed a Phase III clinical trial of\n\nAldurazyme-TM- enzyme, a recombinant form of the human enzyme\n\nalpha-L-iduronidase. Aldurazyme-TM- enzyme is designed to treat a lysosomal\n\nstorage\n\n8\n\ndisease known as mucopolysaccharidosis I, or MPS-I. A confirmatory Phase III\n\nclinical trial is scheduled for 2000. Approximately 2,000 to 3,000 people in the\n\ndeveloped world have been diagnosed with MPS-I.\n\nAVONEX-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- (INTERFERON-BETA 1A). In September 1998,\n\nGenzyme entered into an agreement with Biogen Inc. under which Genzyme General\n\nwill commercialize and exclusively distribute AVONEX-Registered Trademark- in\n\nJapan, following regulatory approval. AVONEX-Registered Trademark- is Biogen's\n\ntreatment for relapsing/remitting forms of multiple sclerosis. Genzyme General\n\nis managing the clinical development program for AVONEX-Registered Trademark- in\n\nJapan and is working to obtain registration and reimbursement approvals for the\n\nproduct. Genzyme General estimates that there are at least 5,000 multiple\n\nsclerosis patients in Japan.\n\nGenzyme General has several other research and development programs in\n\nprocess. It is dedicated to capitalizing on its expertise in proteins, gene and\n\ncell therapy, and small molecules to grow its pipeline. It recently formed an\n\nEmerging Technology Group to focus on using this expertise to accelerate\n\ninternal development programs, form additional strategic collaborations and\n\npursue out-licensing opportunities.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n\nDIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS\n\nGenzyme General develops, markets and distributes IN VITRO products, with an\n\nemphasis on point-of-care, clinical chemistry and rapid test products. Genzyme\n\nGeneral sold its bioreagents and ELISA immunochemistry product lines to an\n\noperating unit of Sybron Laboratory Products Corp. in July 1999 and the primary\n\nassets of its research products business to Techne Corporation in July 1998.\n\nThese sales reflect the sharpened focus of the diagnostic products business.\n\nGenzyme General sells its diagnostic products through its technical sales\n\nrepresentatives in the United States and Europe and through distributors in\n\nJapan.\n\nCARDIOVASCULAR PRODUCTS. Genzyme General sells devices and reagents for the\n\nmeasurement of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, and high-density lipoprotein, or\n\nHDL, cholesterol levels. Genzyme General's N-geneous-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- LDL\n\nand Liquid N-geneous-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- HDL tests accurately measure\n\ncholesterol levels directly without the labor intensive pretreatment steps that\n\nwere previously needed and are easily adaptable to automated chemistry\n\nanalyzers. Both tests are being distributed in the United States by Genzyme\n\nGeneral under an agreement with the manufacturer of the tests, Daiichi Pure\n\nChemicals Co., Ltd., of Tokyo. In addition to the United States. Genzyme General\n\nis also the exclusive marketing partner for the N-geneous-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-\n\nLDL and Liquid N-geneous-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- HDL tests in Europe and the rest\n\nof the world, with the exception of Asia, where Genzyme General holds\n\nco-exclusive distribution rights.\n\nGLYPRO-TM- ASSAY. Genzyme General's GlyPro-TM- test is an improved tool for\n\nmonitoring diabetes. The GlyPro-TM- test measures blood sugar levels over\n\nseveral weeks, which is a valuable resource for reducing diabetes-related\n\ncomplications.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC INTERMEDIATES. Genzyme General produces and sells intermediates\n\nsuch as diagnostic enzymes, substrates and reagents for use in diagnostic kits\n\nused for blood analysis in clinical chemistry laboratories. One area of emphasis\n\nis pancreatic function, where Genzyme General provides enzymes, substrates, bulk\n\nreagents and patented methodologies for amylase and lipase determination to\n\ndiagnostic kit manufacturers. Genzyme General is also a primary supplier of\n\ncholesterol enzymes used in testing for coronary heart disease.\n\nRAPID TESTS. Genzyme General's product portfolio includes its patented\n\nContrast-TM- rapid tests for pregnancy, Strep A and infectious mononucleosis\n\ndetermination. It also introduced the first combination rapid test for the two\n\nmost common causes of parasitic intestinal disease.\n\n9\n\nDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. In October 1999, Genzyme General and Skye\n\nPharmaTech Inc. formed a collaboration to develop and market a point-of-care\n\nstroke diagnostic product. Skye is developing the product, and Genzyme General\n\nwill exclusively manufacture and market the product worldwide following\n\napproval. Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States,\n\naffecting approximately 700,000 people annually, with a similar incidence in\n\nEurope. Approximately 150,000 Americans die as a result of stroke each year.\n\nGenzyme General is conducting research programs for point-of-care products\n\nfor diabetes and infectious diseases. Other development programs include\n\nhomocysteine and Lpa-cholesterol tests to determine cardiovascular disease risk\n\nand a liquid lipase test for pancreatitis.\n\nGENETIC DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES\n\nGenzyme General applies advanced biotechnology to develop and provide high\n\nquality, sophisticated genetic diagnostic services in the United States and\n\ninternationally through a national network of laboratories and a direct sales\n\nforce as well as through joint ventures in Germany and Japan. Genzyme General\n\noffers three types of genetic diagnostic services:\n\n- Biochemical testing services, which consist primarily of a widely used\n\nscreening test known as AFP3 to determine if further prenatal genetic\n\ntesting is appropriate;\n\n- Classical and molecular cytogenetic testing services, which involve the\n\nanalysis of fetal cells obtained through amniocentesis or a process known\n\nas chorionic villi sampling to evaluate chromosomal abnormalities; and\n\n- DNA testing, which is performed to determine the likelihood that the\n\npatient has, or is a carrier for, a specific genetic disorder, such as\n\ncystic fibrosis and Gaucher disease.\n\nGenzyme General employs over 90 board certified genetics professionals who\n\ninterpret results and provide genetic counseling and support services to medical\n\npractitioners and their patients.\n\nWe have described some of Genzyme General's genetic diagnostic tests and\n\nprograms below.\n\nAFP4-TM- TEST. Genzyme General added this advanced screening test to its\n\ncomprehensive prenatal genetic services program during the fourth quarter of\n\n1999. This test is more accurate than the AFP3 test in detecting mutations\n\nassociated with Down syndrome and is expected to replace triple marker screening\n\nover time.\n\nINSIGHT-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- TEST. Genzyme General's\n\nInSight-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- test is a molecular cytogenetic test that permits\n\nidentification of the most frequently occurring chromosomal abnormalities within\n\n48 hours, which is significantly faster than the one to three weeks required to\n\nperform classical cytogenetic testing (karyotyping). The\n\nInSight-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- analysis is provided in conjunction with a\n\ncomplete karyotype.\n\nMASDA-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- TECHNOLOGY. Genzyme General's patented\n\nmultiplex allele-specific diagnostic assay, which is known as the\n\nMASDA-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- technology, is used for simultaneous analysis of up\n\nto 500 DNA for over 100 genetic mutations in a single test. The\n\nMASDA-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- technology not only provides high-throughput\n\nanalysis of different patient samples for different genetic diseases, but also\n\nidentifies multiple mutations in a single patient's DNA sample. Genzyme General\n\nis pursuing a number of commercialization strategies for the\n\nMASDA-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- technology. In addition, the\n\nMASDA-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- technology is being used to provide genetic\n\nprofiling services for clinical trials being conducted by pharmaceutical\n\ncompanies.\n\nHEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS COLON CANCER. Genzyme General introduced a test\n\nthat screens for mutations associated with the most common form of hereditary\n\ncolon cancer, hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, which is also known as HNPCC\n\nor Lynch Syndrome. HNPCC accounts for between\n\n10\n\napproximately 3 and 6% of all colorectal cancers in the United States, or an\n\nestimated 4,000 to 8,000 cases every year. Genzyme General introduced this test\n\nin July 1999.\n\nADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS COLI. Genzyme General's APC I1307K test, also\n\nintroduced in 1999, screens for a gene mutation associated with an increased\n\nrisk of colorectal cancer in Ashkenazi Jewish families. The specific gene\n\nmutation occurs more frequently in this population and has been found in\n\napproximately 28 percent of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals who have both a\n\npersonal history and family history of colon cancer.\n\nCF86 TEST. Introduced in 1999, Genzyme General's CF86 test screens for 86\n\ngenetic mutations associated with cystic fibrosis.\n\nDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. Genzyme General is developing additional platforms\n\nfor complex mutational analysis and conducts major research and development\n\nprograms in such areas as genomics and rare cell separation and analysis\n\nmethods. Genzyme General is also developing a multiple disease carrier test\n\nusing the MASDA-Registered Trademark- technology and integrated scanning\n\nsequencing approaches for rapid detection of both previously characterized and\n\nunknown gene mutations.\n\nGENZYME MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY--DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology is developing a new generation of cancer\n\ntherapeutics based upon the growing understanding of the molecular basis of\n\ncancer. Genzyme Molecular Oncology believes that these therapeutics have the\n\npotential to treat multiple types of cancer, minimize toxicity and side effects,\n\nand complement both existing and novel therapies. It uses its functional\n\ngenomics tools and draws upon capabilities in gene therapy, cell therapy,\n\nprotein therapy and small molecule drugs to select and pursue the most\n\nappropriate of these approaches for each cancer target. Genzyme Molecular\n\nOncology complements its internal resources through collaborations with some of\n\nthe world's preeminent researchers in cancer research.\n\nDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology is developing products in the following three\n\ntherapeutic classes:\n\n- vaccines that treat cancer by stimulating the body's immune system to\n\nfight tumor cells;\n\n- angiogenesis inhibitors that treat cancer by preventing the formation and\n\ndevelopment of blood vessels that tumors require for growth; and\n\n- pathway regulators that treat cancer by regulating one or more of the\n\nmetabolic processes in cancer cells necessary for tumor cells to grow and\n\nsurvive.\n\n11\n\nThe following chart describes the development status of Genzyme Molecular\n\nOncology's development programs:\n\nPRODUCT/PROGRAM TYPES OF CANCER STATUS\n\n- --------------- --------------- ------------------------\n\nCANCER VACCINES\n\nDendritic/tumor cell fusion Breast Phase I/II trial ongoing\n\nMelanoma IND filed\n\nKidney Preclinical\n\nMelan-A/MART-1 and gp100 antigens Melanoma Phase I/II trial ongoing\n\nNY-ESO-1 antigen Multiple Preclinical\n\nANGIOGENESIS INHIBITORS\n\naaATIII Multiple Preclinical\n\nSmall molecules Multiple Research\n\nGene therapy Multiple Research\n\nCANCER PATHWAY REGULATORS\n\nSmall molecules Multiple Research\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology owns all commercial rights to each of these programs\n\nother than aaATIII, which it is co-developing with ATIII LLC, the joint venture\n\nbetween Genzyme General and Genzyme Transgenics.\n\nCANCER VACCINES\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology believes that the most successful cancer vaccines\n\nwill be those that activate a cellular immune response directed at the tumor.\n\nIts program features two types of vaccines for generating a tumor-specific\n\ncellular immune response:\n\n- where the specific tumor antigens are not known, Genzyme Molecular\n\nOncology uses a technique that fuses the patient's own tumor cells with\n\ndendritic cells, creating a cell therapy product; and\n\n- where specific tumor antigens have been identified as targets of the\n\ncellular immune response, Genzyme Molecular Oncology uses gene-based or\n\npeptide-based tumor vaccines.\n\nAntigens are molecular markers in tumor cells that enable the body's immune\n\nsystem to recognize and respond to these cells as being foreign. Dendritic cells\n\nare specialized immune system cells that capture antigens and present them to T\n\ncells that selectively recognize them. T cells are the immune system's cellular\n\nresponse to disease.\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology believes that both of the vaccine types described\n\nabove will provide clinical benefit and have commercial potential. Development\n\nof antigen-specific vaccines, however, is currently limited by the lack of known\n\ntumor-specific antigens. Therefore, cell fusion may be more broadly applicable\n\nin the near term. Over time, as Genzyme Molecular Oncology identifies more\n\ntumor-specific antigens, it anticipates having the ability to provide\n\noff-the-shelf vaccines that are customized based on the set of specific antigens\n\npresent in the patient's tumor.\n\nBREAST CANCER FUSION VACCINE. Working with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute\n\nand the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Genzyme Molecular\n\nOncology initiated a Phase I/II clinical trial for the treatment of metastatic\n\nbreast cancer in September 1999. The vaccine used in this trial is produced\n\nusing a chemical fusion process to combine the patient's own cancer cells and\n\ndendritic cells\n\n12\n\nderived from the patient. The end points for this trial are safety, immunologic\n\nresponse and clinical response.\n\nKIDNEY CANCER AND MELANOMA FUSION VACCINES. An academic group in Germany\n\nhas recently published clinical data for the treatment of kidney cancer with a\n\nvaccine produced using electrofusion to combine a patient's cancer cells with\n\ndendritic cells derived from another source. The clinical response rate reported\n\nin that study was significantly higher than has been achieved with standard\n\ntherapy in that patient population.\n\nBecause of the positive results reported in the German study, Genzyme\n\nMolecular Oncology plans to commence four additional Phase I clinical trials for\n\ncell fusion vaccines in 2000. These trials will be in kidney cancer and in\n\nmelanoma. For each type of cancer, Genzyme Molecular Oncology intends to conduct\n\ntwo trials, one using vaccine produced in the manner used in its breast cancer\n\ntrial and one using vaccine produced in the manner used in the German study.\n\nThese trials should provide Genzyme Molecular Oncology insight into the safety\n\nand efficacy of cell fusion vaccines in a variety of cancer indications, as well\n\nas a comparison of these two processes for producing cell fusion vaccines.\n\nMELAN-A/MART-1 AND GP100 ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC VACCINES. In collaboration with\n\nDr. Steven Rosenberg at the National Cancer Institute, Genzyme Molecular\n\nOncology has conducted two Phase I clinical trials. In these trials, adenoviral\n\ngene delivery vectors carrying either the Melan-A/MART-1 or gp100 gene were\n\nevaluated for safety, immunologic reactivity and potential therapeutic effect\n\nwhen administered IN VIVO alone or in conjunction with recombinant\n\ninterleukin-2. The results from these clinical studies indicated that the\n\nadenoviral vectors were safe and well tolerated, and that a small but notable\n\nnumber of both the 36 patients immunized with Melan-A/MART-1 and the 18 patients\n\ntreated with gp100 showed clinically significant tumor regression. These\n\nresponses were seen in very late stage (stage IV) metastatic disease patients,\n\nwho are a heavily pre-treated patient population not expected to mount a robust\n\nimmune response and who, as a group, have a very short life expectancy.\n\nIn April 1999, Genzyme Molecular Oncology initiated a Phase I/II trial in\n\nmelanoma patients at Massachusetts General Hospital. This trial involves\n\nextracting dendritic cells from the patient and combining these cells with a\n\nvaccine containing Melan-A/MART-1 and gp100 EX VIVO. The treated cells are then\n\ninjected into the patient. In this trial, Genzyme Molecular Oncology will assess\n\nsafety, immunologic response and clinical response. Throughout the trial Genzyme\n\nMolecular Oncology will be performing a comprehensive analysis of the patient's\n\nimmune response to the vaccine to help it to understand better why some patients\n\nrespond well to the therapy while others do not.\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology is also conducting pre-clinical studies to\n\nsupport a Phase I/II IN VIVO melanoma trial expected to begin early in the\n\nsecond half of 2000. For this study, Genzyme Molecular Oncology plans to utilize\n\nboth the Melan-A/MART-1 and gp100 tumor antigens. In this trial, Genzyme\n\nMolecular Oncology intends to monitor patient immune responses in order to\n\nfurther elucidate the immunology of cancer to enhance its antigen-specific\n\nvaccine development efforts.\n\nNY-ESO-1 ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC VACCINES. NY-ESO-1 is an antigen expressed in a\n\nsubset of a number of different tumor types, including breast cancer, melanoma\n\nand lung cancer. Genzyme Molecular Oncology is conducting pre-clinical\n\ndevelopment to support a Phase I/II clinical trial for NY-ESO-1-positive tumors\n\nto be performed in collaboration with the Ludwig Institute. In this trial,\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology plans to enroll patients with tumors that express\n\nNY-ESO-1 regardless of the location of the tumor. In this way, the trial will\n\noffer an opportunity to shift the paradigm for treating cancer from one based on\n\nthe anatomical location of the tumor to one based on the antigenic profile of\n\nthe tumor.\n\n13\n\nANGIOGENISIS INHIBITORS\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology is pursuing proteins, small molecules and gene\n\ntherapies for use as angiogenesis inhibitors. Angiogenesis is the growth of new\n\nblood vessels. A modified form of ATIII that is known as aaATIII is Genzyme\n\nMolecular Oncology's lead development candidate in its angiogenesis inhibition\n\nprogram. While ATIII does not inhibit angiogenesis, preclinical studies have\n\nshown that when it is modified to aaATIII, the modified compound acts as a\n\npotent angiogenesis inhibitor.\n\nCANCER PATHWAY REGULATOR\n\nCancer pathway regulators treat cancer by regulating one or more metabolic\n\nprocesses required for growth and survival of cancer cells. Genzyme Molecular\n\nOncology has early stage programs focusing on small molecule drugs. Genzyme\n\nMolecular Oncology's small molecule drug discovery effort relies upon its access\n\nto extensive libraries of compounds and multiple high-throughput assays. The\n\nnumber of small molecules in Genzyme's libraries of chemical compounds now\n\nexceeds two million compounds. Genzyme Molecular Oncology also has access to\n\ncompound libraries of other companies.\n\nSAGE-TM- TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology's SAGE-TM- technology is a patented\n\nhigh-throughput, high efficiency method of simultaneously detecting and\n\nmeasuring the expression level of virtually all genes expressed in a cell at a\n\ngiven time. The SAGE-TM- technology detects and quantifies expression of novel\n\nas well as known genes and, because of its high efficiency and sensitivity,\n\nSAGE-TM- technology can detect genes expressed at low levels. Some of the uses\n\nof SAGE-TM- technology are comparison of disease tissue with healthy tissue,\n\ncomparison of genes expressed at different stages of disease, elucidation of\n\ndisease pathways and measurement of response to and toxicity of drug candidates.\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology continues to enhance the power of its SAGE-TM-\n\ntechnology through software and bioinformatics development, technology\n\nimprovements, database expansion and the integration of the SAGE-TM- technology\n\nwith other genomics tools, such as microarrays.\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology has used its SAGE-TM- technology to analyze the\n\nmost prevalent types of cancer and corresponding normal tissue and also has\n\naccess to SAGE-TM- data generated in the laboratories of Drs. Bert Vogelstein\n\nand Kenneth Kinzler at The Johns Hopkins University. Genzyme Molecular Oncology\n\nhas accumulated from its proprietary analyses, its collaborators and the Cancer\n\nGenome Anatomy Project at the NCI a database of over 3.5 million SAGE-TM- gene\n\nsequence identification tags, representing over 125,000 unique genes.\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology is also using its SAGE-TM- technology extensively\n\nin its drug discovery and development efforts to identify genes that are\n\nfunctionally relevant. In cancer vaccines, Genzyme Molecular Oncology combines\n\nthe SAGE-TM- technology with other proprietary tools to identify tumor-specific\n\nantigens. In angiogenesis inhibition, Genzyme Molecular Oncology is using the\n\nSAGE-TM- technology to dissect the genetic pathways for angiogenesis and to\n\nexplore and understand the mechanism of action of drug candidates discovered in\n\nfunctional assays. In cancer pathway regulation, Genzyme Molecular Oncology is\n\nusing the SAGE-TM- technology to identify targets to use in high-throughput\n\nscreens.\n\nIn addition to using the SAGE-TM- technology in its drug discovery and\n\ndevelopment programs, Genzyme Molecular Oncology is using the SAGE-TM-technology\n\nand its proprietary SAGE-TM- database to generate revenues through licenses and\n\nservice agreements and database collaborations.\n\nANTIGEN DISCOVERY PLATFORM\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology is seeking to stimulate a cellular immune\n\nresponse against tumors by using vaccines to present tumor-specific antigens to\n\nthe immune system. Genzyme Molecular\n\n14\n\nOncology has built a proprietary, state-of-the-art antigen discovery platform\n\nthat combines identification and validation in one step. Genzyme Molecular\n\nOncology is using this platform to rapidly and efficiently identify and validate\n\ntarget antigens for incorporation into novel antigen-specific cancer vaccines.\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology plans to analyze the cancer cells extracted from the\n\npatients in its on-going cell fusion vaccine clinical trials using its antigen\n\ndiscovery technologies in order to identify the antigens associated with\n\nanti-tumor and expand the development of its antigen-specific vaccines.\n\nGENZYME SURGICAL PRODUCTS--PRODUCTS AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\n\nIn addition to providing traditional devices and closures for the\n\ncardiothoracic, general and plastic surgery markets, Genzyme Surgical Products\n\ndevelops and markets products for minimally invasive cardiovascular surgery,\n\nbiomaterials and biotherapeutics. Genzyme Surgical Products' sales force markets\n\nproducts directly to surgeons and hospital administrators throughout the United\n\nStates and Europe. It also uses a network of distributors in Europe, Asia and\n\nLatin America.\n\nGenzyme Surgical Products' biomaterials program includes products based on\n\nhyaluronic acid that are intended to reduce the incidence and extent of\n\nadhesions (scar tissue) that form after surgery. Hyaluronic acid is a substance\n\nthat is naturally created by the body to lubricate and protect tissue. These\n\nproducts are known as the Sepra family of products and are being developed on\n\nbehalf of Genzyme Development Partners, L.P. Genzyme Surgical Products has the\n\nexclusive right to sell the Sepra family of products in the United States and\n\nCanada on behalf of our joint venture with Genzyme Development Partners and the\n\nexclusive right to sell these products outside the United States and Canada for\n\nits own benefit. Genzyme Surgical Products sells the Sepra family of products in\n\nLuxembourg, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan through distributors. If you\n\nwould like more information about our relationship with Genzyme Development\n\nPartners and the joint venture, you should read Note M to our consolidated\n\nfinancial statements, which we are incorporating into this discussion by\n\nreference.\n\nCARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY\n\nTRADITIONAL INSTRUMENTS AND DEVICES. Genzyme Surgical Products'\n\ncardiothoracic surgery business consists of a comprehensive portfolio of\n\nproducts, including fluid management and chest drainage systems, sutures and\n\ncardiovascular instruments. Its line of fluid management systems consists\n\nprimarily of self-contained, disposable chest drainage devices used to drain\n\nblood from the chest cavity following open-heart surgery, other surgical\n\nprocedures and trauma. Genzyme Surgical Products also sells autotransfusion\n\ndevices that allow the collection of blood shed by the patient and its\n\nreinfusion postoperatively, which eliminates the risks associated with blood\n\ntransfusions. Genzyme Surgical Products' self-contained, disposable\n\nPleur-evac-Registered Trademark- chest drainage unit was introduced in 1967 and\n\nis the market leader in chest drainage devices. Genzyme Surgical Products also\n\nsells a line of dry suction-controlled chest drainage and autotransfusion\n\ndevices under the Sahara-TM- and Thora-Klex-Registered Trademark- brand names.\n\nIt markets sutures, including the Tevdek-Registered Trademark- and\n\nPolydek-Registered Trademark- valve sutures and Deklene-Registered Trademark-\n\nbypass sutures. Genzyme Surgical Products also sells aortic punches, which are\n\nused during coronary artery bypass surgery to make clean, round openings in the\n\naorta prior to grafting. Finally, its Diamond-Line-Registered Trademark-\n\nportfolio of hand-held, reusable instruments includes needleholders, scissors,\n\nforceps, graspers, dissectors and retractors.\n\nMINIMALLY INVASIVE CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY SYSTEMS. Genzyme Surgical\n\nProducts markets products for minimally invasive cardiovascular surgery, with a\n\nfocus on beating-heart surgery. In beating-heart surgery, procedures are\n\nperformed on the heart without stopping the heart and without the use of a\n\nheart/lung machine to circulate blood and supply oxygen. This allows surgeons to\n\navoid the complications often associated with the use of heart/lung machines.\n\nGenzyme Surgical Products' newest product in this line is known as the Genzyme\n\nOPCAB Elite-TM- beating-heart platform. The Genzyme OPCAB Elite-TM- system is\n\ndesigned to allow surgeons to conduct multi-vessel coronary artery bypass\n\n15\n\nsurgery while the heart continues to beat. It combines reusable retractors with\n\ndisposable devices such as stabilizers, sutures and punches. A central component\n\nof the system is the Cohn Cardiac Stabilizer-TM- device, which allows surgeons\n\nto isolate and stabilize a small section of the heart to have clear access to\n\nthe blood vessels.\n\nIn addition, Genzyme Surgical Products has introduced minimally invasive\n\nsaphenous vein harvest and valve replacement instruments. For example, its\n\nSaphLITE-Registered Trademark- II system is used to remove the saphenous vein\n\nfrom the leg for use as a graft in coronary artery bypass procedures.\n\nBIOMATERIALS. Genzyme Surgical Products has obtained the exclusive right to\n\ndistribute FocalSeal-Registered Trademark--L in North America for pulmonary,\n\ncardiovascular and gastrointestinal procedures following regulatory approval of\n\nthe product. FocalSeal-Registered Trademark--L is a biomaterial developed by\n\nFocal, Inc. for the prevention of air and fluid leaks following surgery.\n\nFocalSeal-Registered Trademark--L recently received approval in Canada, and\n\nGenzyme Surgical Products expects it to be approved in the United States in\n\n2000. Approximately 70,000 lung surgeries are performed in the United States\n\nannually, with almost all patients at risk for debilitating air leaks.\n\nGenzyme Surgical Products recently obtained approval in the European Union\n\nfor its CV Seprafilm-TM- cardiovascular adhesion barrier, which is designed to\n\nreduce the formation of adhesions following open-heart surgery. In addition, it\n\nhas completed the safety phase of a clinical trial for this product in the\n\nUnited States in infants undergoing multi-stage procedures for the repair of\n\ncongenital heart defects.\n\nBIOTHERAPEUTICS. Genzyme Surgical Products also has several biotherapeutic\n\nproducts in various stages of research and development. It is developing HIF-1\n\nalpha, which is a naturally occurring compound that has been shown to trigger\n\nthe expression of many proteins associated with angiogenesis. Genzyme Surgical\n\nProducts is conducting a Phase I clinical trial of HIF-1 alpha in patients with\n\nperipheral vascular disease, a condition caused by blocked arteries in the\n\nlimbs. Following review of a protocol by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee\n\nof the National Institutes of Health, Genzyme Surgical Products also plans to\n\nbegin a second Phase I clinical trial of the product in patients with coronary\n\nartery disease undergoing bypass surgery who have an area of the heart that is\n\nnot suitable for surgical revascularization.\n\nGenzyme Surgical Products is conducting research on other gene therapy\n\napproaches to congestive heart failure and restenosis. In addition, through a\n\ncollaboration with a research group at the Toronto Hospital in Canada, Genzyme\n\nSurgical Products is also conducting research on cell therapy approaches to\n\ncongestive heart failure.\n\nGENERAL SURGERY\n\nGenzyme Surgical Products has established a growing presence in the general\n\nsurgery market through its biomaterials and endoscopic instruments.\n\n16\n\nBIOMATERIALS. Genzyme Surgical Products has an extensive line of\n\nbiomaterial products on the market and in development for the general surgery\n\nmarket, including many products included in the Sepra family of products.\n\nPRODUCT INDICATION STATUS\n\n- ------- ----------------------------- -----------------------------\n\nSEPRA FILM-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- Abdominal/pelvic surgery Marketed in the U.S. since\n\nBIORESORBABLE MEMBRANE 1996; approved in the U.S.\n\nand Europe in 1996, in Canada\n\nand Israel in 1997, in Japan\n\nin 1998 and in several other\n\ncountries\n\nSEPRA FILM(-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-) Small bowel obstructions Phase IV clinical trial\n\nBIORESORBABLE MEMBRANE ongoing\n\nSEPRA FILM(-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-) II Abdominal/pelvic surgery Marketed in Europe since 1999\n\nADHESION BARRIER\n\nSEPRACOAT-TM- COATING SOLUTION Open surgery Marketed in Europe since 1996\n\nSEPRAMESH-TM- PRODUCT Hernia repair Received 510(k) clearance in\n\n2000\n\nSEPRAPAK-TM- PRODUCT Sinus packing Listed with the FDA\n\nSEPRAGEL(-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-) Open and laproscopic surgery In development\n\nBIORESORBABLE GEL\n\nGenzyme Surgical Products' lead product in the general surgery market is\n\nSepra Film-Registered Trademark- bioresorbable membrane.

Genzyme Surgical Products is also\n\ncurrently developing anti-adhesion products for other surgical applications.\n\nENDOSCOPIC INSTRUMENTS. Genzyme Surgical Products carries an extensive line\n\nof high-quality endoscopic instruments for general and gynecological surgery.\n\nIts Diamond-Line-Registered Trademark- technology extends to a full portfolio of\n\nretractors, forceps, scissors, needle-holders, graspers and clamps. The leading\n\nproducts in the portfolio are its Diamond-Flex-Registered Trademark- and\n\nDiamond-Touch-Registered Trademark- instruments.\n\nDiamond-Flex-Registered Trademark- retractors and forceps are the only reusable\n\ninstruments on the market with articulating heads that allow gentle\n\nrepositioning of organs and tissue at varying angles. The\n\nDiamond-Touch-Registered Trademark- instruments provide ergonomically designed\n\ncontoured handles for superior positioning, comfort and control. Genzyme\n\nSurgical Products' Switch-Blade-TM- tips are the second major component of its\n\nendoscopic surgery portfolio. Switch-Blade-TM- tips are disposable scissor tips\n\nthat are attached to reusable shafts.\n\nOTHER PRODUCTS\n\nGenzyme Surgical Products also manufactures products for the plastic surgery\n\nmarket. This distinct product line consists of hand-held instruments, endoscopic\n\nplastic surgery equipment, sutures and surgical compression garments.\n\n17\n\nGENZYME TISSUE REPAIR--PRODUCTS AND DEVELOPMENT PRODUCTS\n\nGenzyme Tissue Repair is a leading developer of biological products for the\n\nfields of orthopedics and burn care. Over the course of the last year, Genzyme\n\nTissue Repair has taken several steps to streamline its operations and focus its\n\nbusiness strategy, including transferring the NeuroCell-TM- program to Genzyme\n\nGeneral. Genzyme Tissue Repair is dedicated to expanding and improving its\n\nCarticel-Registered Trademark- product and accelerating its bio-orthopedic\n\ndevelopment programs.\n\nCARTICEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- AUTOLOGOUS CULTURED CHONDROCYTES. Genzyme\n\nTissue Repair's lead product, Carticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- chondrocytes, is\n\nused to treat damaged articular knee cartilage. Genzyme Tissue Repair employs a\n\nproprietary process to grow autologous--a patient's own--cartilage cells for use\n\nin repairing damaged knee cartilage.\n\nThe FDA has required Genzyme Tissue Repair to conduct two confirmatory\n\npost-marketing studies of Carticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- chondrocytes. The FDA\n\napproved new clinical designs for these trials in February 2000. The first study\n\nmeasures outcomes of patients in Genzyme Tissue Repair's registry who did not\n\nrespond to other treatment before being implanted with\n\nCarticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes. It will compare outcomes before and\n\nafter implantation. Genzyme Tissue Repair expects to complete this study in\n\n2000. The second study is designed to compare the long-term clinical effect of\n\ntreatment with Carticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- chondrocytes to other treatments.\n\nGenzyme Tissue Repair believes that for Carticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-\n\nchondrocytes to be commercially successful, it must be routinely used by a large\n\nnumber of orthopedic surgeons. It markets Carticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-\n\nchondrocytes to orthopedic surgeons in the United States and Europe directly and\n\nthrough distributors. Genzyme Tissue Repair also trains orthopedic surgeons,\n\ncollects and analyzes outcomes data through a registry, and assists physicians\n\nand patients in obtaining reimbursements from third-party payers. The commercial\n\nsuccess of Carticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- chondrocytes will also depend on its\n\nability to increase the approval rate for reimbursement of the product from\n\nthird-party payers. For this reason, approximately one-third of its 59-person\n\nU.S. sales and reimbursement staff is involved directly in claims processing and\n\neducating insurers about the appropriate uses of the\n\nCarticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- chondrocytes. Genzyme Tissue Repair expects that\n\nCarticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- sales may be lower in the summer months as fewer\n\noperative procedures are typically performed during those months.\n\nEPICEL-TM- SKIN GRAFTS. Genzyme Tissue Repair's Epicel-TM- skin grafts are\n\ncultured autologous skin cells used for permanent skin replacement for patients\n\nwith severe burns. Epicel-TM- skin grafts were first introduced in 1987. These\n\nepidermal grafts are grown from a patient's own skin cells and, therefore, are\n\nnot rejected by the patient's immune system. Most burn wounds involving less\n\nthan 60% body surface area are covered with conventional skin grafts within the\n\nthree to four weeks it currently takes to grow skin grafts produced using the\n\nEpicel-TM- service. Therefore, Genzyme Tissue Repair believes that the primary\n\ncandidates for Epicel-TM- skin grafts are the approximately 800 patients each\n\nyear in the U.S. who survive burn injuries covering more than 60% of their body\n\nsurface area. Genzyme Tissue Repair markets Epicel-TM- skin grafts to burn\n\ncenters in the U.S. and parts of Europe through its own direct sales force and\n\nin Japan through a distributor. Sales of Epicel-TM- skin grafts fluctuate from\n\nquarter to quarter depending on the number of unpredictable factors, including\n\nthe number and survival rate of severe burn patients who are treated with\n\nEpicel-TM- skin grafts.\n\nCARTICEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- II. Carticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- II is a\n\nnext-generation product based on the development of a pre-formed autologous\n\ncartilage tissue implant. The implant is intended to allow the procedure to be\n\nperformed arthroscopically. If it is successfully developed,\n\nCarticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- II could significantly decrease rehabilitation\n\ntime for patients and allow surgeons to treat larger cartilage defects. Genzyme\n\nTissue Repair plans to complete preclinical studies of\n\nCarticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-() II in 2000.\n\nQUICKTACK-TM- PERIOSTEAL FIXATION SYSTEM. QuickTack-TM- is a small device\n\ndesigned to be used instead of sutures during the Carticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-\n\nimplant procedure. It is expected to simplify the procedure and\n\n18\n\nsignificantly decrease the time needed for surgery. Genzyme Tissue Repair plans\n\nto submit a 510(k) application for the Quick Tack-TM- periosteal fixation system\n\nto the FDA in the first half of 2000.\n\nOSTEOARTHRITIS. Genzyme Tissue Repair has is conducting pre-clinical\n\nstudies of an innovative small molecule therapy for the treatment of\n\nosteoarthritis.\n\nPHOTOACTIVE TISSUE WELDING TECHNOLOGY. Genzyme Tissue Repair is conducting\n\nproof of concept studies of a photoactive tissue welding technology it licensed\n\nfrom PhotoBioMed Corp. It intends to seek a partner to develop and commercialize\n\nthis technology.\n\nOTHER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. Genzyme Tissue Repair has a number of ongoing\n\ndevelopment programs supporting Carticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- chondrocytes.\n\nGenzyme Tissue Repair is conducting basic research and development into the\n\nbiology of cartilage and the cartilage repair process. The objective of this\n\nresearch is to identify biologic materials that promote more rapid regeneration\n\nof articular cartilage, to develop new methods for the repair of arthritic\n\njoints and large surface area cartilage defects and to enable the implantation\n\nprocedure to be performed less invasively. Genzyme Tissue Repair is also\n\ncommitting resources to meet requirements specified by the FDA for validation of\n\ncertain product manufacturing parameters.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nWe are engaged in a segment of the human health care products industry that\n\nis extremely competitive. Our competitors in the United States and elsewhere are\n\nnumerous and include major pharmaceutical, surgical device and biotechnology\n\ncompanies. Some of these competitors may have more extensive research and\n\ndevelopment, regulatory, manufacturing and production capabilities. Some\n\ncompetitors may have greater financial resources. These companies may succeed in\n\ndeveloping products that are more effective than any that we have or may develop\n\nand may also prove to be more successful than we are in producing and marketing\n\nproducts and services. In addition, technological advances or different\n\napproaches developed by one or more of our competitors may render our products\n\nobsolete, less effective or uneconomical.\n\nEach of our products and services faces different competitive challenges:\n\nCEREZYME-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- ENZYME AND CEREDASE-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-\n\nENZYME. Although Genzyme General is not aware of any current effective\n\nalternative to its products for the treatment for Gaucher disease, competition\n\npotentially could come from other protein replacement therapies, small molecules\n\nor gene therapy. Genzyme General is aware of other companies attempting to\n\ndevelop alternative treatments for Gaucher disease. However, Genzyme General\n\nbelieves that its proprietary production techniques and, to a certain extent,\n\nthe orphan drug status of its products, which provides market exclusivity in the\n\nUnited States until May 2001, give it a number of advantages over potential\n\ncompetitors using protein replacement therapy for the treatment of Gaucher\n\ndisease. Gene therapy techniques are still in experimental stages. Genzyme\n\nGeneral believes that the principal factors that will affect competition for\n\nCerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme and Ceredase-Registered Trademark- enzyme\n\nwill be clinical effectiveness and absence of adverse side effects.\n\nRENAGEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- CAPSULES. Phosphate binders are currently the\n\nonly available treatment for hyperphosphatemia. There are several phosphate\n\nbinders available or under development. A prescription calcium acetate\n\npreparation is currently the only other product approved in the United States\n\nfor the control of elevated phosphorus levels in patients with chronic kidney\n\nfailure. Other products used as phosphate binders include over-the-counter\n\ncalcium- and aluminum-based antacids and dietary calcium supplements. Calcium\n\nacetate and calcium carbonate, the most commonly used agents, must be taken at\n\nsufficient doses to achieve adequate reductions in phosphate absorption, which\n\ncan lead to constipation and patient noncompliance. In addition, calcium therapy\n\nrequires frequent monitoring because its use can cause hypercalcemia. Aluminum\n\nhydroxide is more effective at lower\n\n19\n\ndoses than calcium acetate or calcium carbonate, but it is infrequently used\n\nbecause aluminum absorbed from the intestinal tract accumulates in the tissues\n\nof patients with chronic kidney failure, causing aluminum-related osteomalacia,\n\nanemia and dialysis dementia.\n\nANTITHROMBIN III. Individuals who have a deficiency of ATIII are treated\n\ncurrently with plasma-derived ATIII. Genzyme General and Genzyme Transgenics\n\nbelieve transgenic ATIII may represent a more attractive therapeutic than the\n\ncurrent plasma-derived product in light of:\n\n- the risks of viral transmission from pooled plasma products in general;\n\n- the limited volume of ATIII available from plasma; and\n\n- the impracticality of producing sufficient quantities of ATIII in cell\n\nculture systems.\n\nNEUROCELL-TM- -PD AND NEUROCELL-TM- -HD. While there currently are no\n\neffective long-term therapies for advanced Parkinson's disease and no effective\n\ntreatments for Huntington's disease, Genzyme General is aware of other companies\n\nand institutions pursuing research and development of alternative treatments for\n\nthe diseases. Experimental therapies under development for Parkinson's disease\n\ninclude surgical destruction of certain portions of the brain (pallidotomy),\n\ngene therapy, cell therapy, the use of growth factors and neuroprotectant\n\ntherapy.\n\nCYSTIC FIBROSIS. There are a number of academic and commercial\n\norganizations engaged in developing therapies to treat either the symptoms of\n\ncystic fibrosis or the cause of the disease. Several groups are developing gene\n\ntherapy approaches to the disease and also have received approval from the FDA\n\nand the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee to initiate limited human studies of\n\ncystic fibrosis gene therapy. In addition, other organizations are investigating\n\npharmacological and biological agents that would treat cystic fibrosis. One such\n\nproduct, Pulmozyme-Registered Trademark-, which was developed by\n\nGenentech, Inc., is currently on the market. These groups may succeed in\n\ndeveloping gene therapy products before Genzyme General, in obtaining patent\n\nprotection blocking Genzyme General from commercializing its cystic fibrosis\n\nproducts or in developing other drug therapies that relieve the symptoms of\n\ncystic fibrosis.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS. Genzyme General acts as a primary supplier of enzymes\n\nand substrates, and generally does not compete with its customers in the sale of\n\ncomplete diagnostic kits. The market in the diagnostic products industry is\n\nmature and competition is based on price, reliability of supply and the purity\n\nand specific activity of products.\n\nGENETIC DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES. The U.S. market for human genetic testing is\n\ndivided among approximately 500 laboratories. Of this total group, less than 20\n\nlaboratories market their services nationally. Genzyme General believes that the\n\nindustry as a whole is still quite fragmented, with the top 20 laboratories\n\naccounting for approximately 50% of market revenues, and with no individual\n\ncompany accounting for more than 18% of the total other than Genzyme, which\n\naccounts for approximately 22% of the total. Genzyme General believes, however,\n\nthat the industry will experience increasing consolidation as smaller\n\nlaboratories face the challenges of more complex and stringent regulation.\n\nCompetitive factors in the genetic diagnostics services business generally\n\ninclude reputation of the laboratory, range of services offered, pricing,\n\nconvenience of sample collection and pick-up, quality of analysis and reporting\n\nand timeliness of delivery of completed reports. Genzyme General believes that\n\nits research and development program, which has enabled it to develop and\n\nintroduce testing services based on new technology, and its active sales and\n\nmarketing force have played significant roles in the growth of its genetic\n\ndiagnostics services business.\n\nCANCER. Competition in the field of cancer therapeutics is intense. Genzyme\n\nMolecular Oncology faces, and will continue to face, significant competition\n\nfrom organizations such as large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies,\n\nuniversities, government agencies and other research institutions.\n\n20\n\nCompetition can arise from the use of the same or similar technologies as\n\nthose currently used or contemplated to be used by Genzyme Molecular Oncology,\n\nas well as from existing therapies. Any or all of these may be more effective or\n\nless expensive than those developed by Genzyme Molecular Oncology. For instance,\n\nother companies provide genomics services that are competitive with the SAGE-TM-\n\ntechnology.\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology relies on its collaborators for support in some\n\nof its cancer research and development programs and intends to rely on these\n\npartners for preclinical evaluation and clinical development of its potential\n\nproducts and services. In addition, certain of its partners are conducting\n\nmultiple product development programs in the same fields as those in which they\n\nare collaborating with Genzyme Molecular Oncology. Genzyme Molecular Oncology's\n\nproduct candidates, therefore, may be subject to competition with potential\n\nproducts under development by one or more of its partners.\n\nCHEST DRAINAGE AND FLUID MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS, INSTRUMENTS AND SUTURES. The\n\nprincipal methods by which Genzyme Surgical Products competes in the\n\ncardiothoracic and general surgery markets are:\n\n- continued innovative product development;\n\n- the performance and breadth of its product lines;\n\n- brand name recognition;\n\n- sales force training; and\n\n- educational services, including sponsorship of training programs in\n\nadvanced surgical techniques.\n\nIts chief competitors in the chest drainage and fluid management market are\n\nAtrium Medical Corporation and Sherwood-Davis & Geck, a division of Tyco\n\nInternational, Ltd. Genzyme Surgical Products primarily competes with Karl Storz\n\nEndoscopy America, Inc., Scanlan International, Inc., Pilling Weck Surgical\n\nInstruments and the Codman division of Johnson & Johnson Ltd. in the reusable\n\ninstruments market. U.S. Surgical Corporation, a division of Tyco, and the\n\nEthicon division of Johnson & Johnson are Genzyme Surgical Products' primary\n\ncompetitors in the cardiovascular sutures market.\n\nMINIMALLY INVASIVE CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY. Genzyme Surgical Products faces\n\ncompetitors in the minimally invasive cardiovascular surgery field.\n\nCardioThoracic Systems, Inc., which was recently acquired by Guidant\n\nCorporation, was founded solely to pursue minimally invasive cardiovascular\n\nsurgery and was among the first companies to draw national attention to the\n\ntechnology. CardioThoracic Systems is also the leader in both the minimally\n\ninvasive direct coronary artery bypass and off-pump coronary artery bypass\n\nmarkets. Several major surgical products companies have also entered the\n\nminimally invasive cardiovascular surgery market, including Medtronic, Inc.,\n\nU.S. Surgical and Ethicon.\n\nTHERAPIES FOR ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE. There is considerable competition in\n\nthe development of protein and gene therapies to induce angiogenesis for the\n\ntreatment of ischemic heart disease. Several companies have initiated clinical\n\ntrials of gene and protein therapies for ischemic heart disease, and other\n\ncompanies have products that are still in preclinical development.\n\nGenzyme Surgical Products is aware of ongoing research on cell-based\n\napproaches to restoring cardiac function to infarcted tissue. Academic\n\ninstitutions and private companies are also conducting research to develop\n\nmechanical devices to reduce ventricular size or to minimize ventricular\n\ndilation.\n\nTHERAPIES FOR PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE. There is considerable\n\ncompetition in the development of protein and gene therapies to induce\n\nangiogenesis for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease.\n\nADHESION BARRIERS. Genzyme Surgical Products believes that its expertise in\n\ndeveloping proprietary fermentation processes and its access to proprietary\n\nstrains of micro-organisms used in its hyaluronic\n\n21\n\nacid production process will give it a competitive advantage in the marketing of\n\nthe Sepra family of products. Its anti-adhesion products may face significant\n\ncompetition, however, from other products based on hyaluronic acid as well as\n\nfrom other products and changes in surgical techniques that may obviate the use\n\nof hyaluronic acid. Genzyme Surgical Products believes that the principal factor\n\nthat will affect competition in this area is acceptance of the product by\n\nsurgeons, which depends, in large part, upon product performance, safety and\n\nprice.\n\nSepra Film-Registered Trademark- bioresorbable membrane does not have\n\nsignificant direct competition in the colorectal surgery market. Ethicon markets\n\nInterceed-Registered Trademark-, an anti-adhesion barrier that may have\n\nproperties similar to the Sepra Film-Registered Trademark- product, but is\n\nindicated only for selected gynecological indications.\n\nInterceed-Registered Trademark- has been shown to lose its anti-adhesion\n\nproperties in the presence of blood. Lifecore Biomedical, Inc. and Ethicon's\n\nIntergel-TM- product, a gel-based anti-adhesion product, is marketed in Europe.\n\nGliatech, Inc. currently markets Adcon-L for the prevention of adhesions\n\nfollowing lumbar surgery. In addition, it has initiated clinical trials of\n\nAdcon-A and Adcon-P, which are designed to limit adhesions after abdominal and\n\npelvic surgery. Life Medical Sciences, Inc. is developing REPEL for\n\ngynecological surgery and REPEL-CV for cardiovascular surgery. These adhesion\n\nbarrier membranes are in early clinical trials.\n\nPLASTIC SURGERY AND ENDOSCOPIC SURGERY INSTRUMENTS. Genzyme Surgical\n\nProducts' main competitors for the market in plastic surgery instruments are\n\nKarl Storz, Padgett Instruments, Inc., the V. Mueller division of Allegiance\n\nCorporation and Walter Lorenz Surgical, Inc. In the endoscopic plastic surgery\n\nmarket, its competitors include Circon Corporation, OLYMPUS Winter & Ibe GmbH,\n\nStryker Corporation, and Karl Storz.\n\nCARTICEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- CHONDROCYTES. Genzyme Tissue Repair is aware\n\nof two other companies, Verigen, Inc. and Codon, which are both culturing\n\nautologous chondrocytes for cartilage repair in Europe. In addition, Genzyme\n\nTissue Repair knows of three other companies, Advanced Tissue Sciences, Inc. in\n\nconjunction with Smith & Nephew PLC, Integra LifeSciences Corp. and LifeCell\n\nCorp., which are engaged in research on cultured cartilage products. In\n\naddition, a surgical technique known as osteochondral grafting may be\n\ncompetitive to Carticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- chondrocytes. This procedure,\n\nwhich can be performed arthroscopically, involves transferring plugs of low\n\nweight bearing cartilage and bone to the area of a defect. Smith & Nephew,\n\nArthrex, Inc. and Innovasive Devices, Inc. are known to have programs relating\n\nto this procedure.\n\nEPICEL-TM- SKIN GRAFTS. Genzyme Tissue Repair is the only commercial\n\nprovider of cultured skin grafts that have been shown to provide permanent skin\n\nreplacement for burn patients in the U.S. However, Genzyme Tissue Repair may\n\nface competition from companies using other approaches to culture skin tissue.\n\nIntegra is marketing a collagen-based dermal replacement product for severely\n\nburned patients. This product will still require a skin graft from the patient\n\nor Epicel-TM- skin grafts to close a full-thickness wound, however, and\n\ntherefore will not compete directly with Epicel-TM- skin grafts. Advanced Tissue\n\nSciences, Inc. has received approval for a temporary wound covering for burns.\n\nOrganogenesis, Inc. has submitted a Pre-Market Approval application for a\n\nproduct to be used for the closure of venous stasis ulcers. LifeCell Corp.\n\ncurrently has freeze-dried enzymatically processed human cadaver dermis on the\n\nmarket.\n\n22\n\nPATENTS, LICENSE AGREEMENTS AND TRADEMARKS\n\nIn general, we pursue a policy of obtaining patent protection both in the\n\nUnited States and in selected foreign countries for subject matter we consider\n\npatentable and important to our business. In addition, a portion of our\n\nproprietary position is based upon patents that we have licensed from others\n\neither through collaboration or traditional license agreements, including\n\npatents relating to:\n\n- Renagel-Registered Trademark- capsules;\n\n- Transgenic ATIII;\n\n- Aldurazyme-TM- enzyme;\n\n- AVONEX-Registered Trademark- (Interferon-beta 1a);\n\n- NeuroCell-TM--PD and NeuroCell-TM--HD;\n\n- Alpha-glucosidase;\n\n- DHA derivative;\n\n- Acid sphingomyelinase;\n\n- EPI-KAL2;\n\n- the HNPCC and APC I1307K tests;\n\n- TGF-(2);\n\n- SAGE-TM- technology;\n\n- cell fusion technology;\n\n- viral and non-viral gene therapy technology;\n\n- drug delivery technology;\n\n- various cancer related genes such as p53;\n\n- HIF-1 alpha;\n\n- Cohn Cardiac Stabilizer-TM- device;\n\n- Epicel-TM- skin grafts; and\n\n- photoactive tissue welding technology.\n\nThese collaboration and license agreements generally require us to share\n\nprofits with our collaborative partners or pay royalties to our licensors upon\n\ncommercialization of products covered by the licensed technology. Generally,\n\npatents issued in the United States are effective for the longer of 17 years\n\nfrom date of issue or 20 years from the effective filing date of the\n\ncorresponding patent application if filed prior to June 8, 1995; and 20 years\n\nfrom the filing date for applications filed after June 8, 1995. In some cases,\n\nthe patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during\n\nFDA regulatory review. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with\n\napplicable local law.\n\nWe also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing\n\ntechnological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position in our\n\nproduct areas. We require our employees, consultants and corporate partners who\n\nhave access to our proprietary information to sign confidentiality agreements.\n\nOur patent position and proprietary technology are subject to certain risks\n\nand uncertainties. We have included information about these risks and\n\nuncertainties in Exhibit 99.2, \"Factors Affecting\n\n23\n\nFuture Operating Results,\" to this Form 10-K. We encourage you to read those\n\ndescriptions, which we are incorporating into this discussion by reference.\n\nOur products and services are sold around the world under brand-name\n\ntrademarks and service marks. Trademark protection continues in some countries\n\nas long as the mark is used; in other countries, as long as its registered.\n\nRegistrations generally are for fixed, but renewable, terms. We consider our\n\nregistered trademarks Genzyme-Registered Trademark-,\n\nCerezyme-Registered Trademark-, Ceredase-Registered Trademark-,\n\nThyrogen-Registered Trademark-, N-geneous-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- LDL,\n\nN-geneous-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- HDL, Contrast-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-(),\n\nInSight-Registered Trademark-, MASDA-Registered Trademark-, Sepra\n\nFilm-Registered Trademark-, Pleur-evac-Registered Trademark-,\n\nThora-Klex-Registered Trademark-, Tevdek-Registered Trademark-,\n\nPolydek-Registered Trademark-, Deklene-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-(), Cohn Cardiac\n\nImmobilizer-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-(), SaphLITE-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-(),\n\nSepragel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-(), Diamond-Line-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-(),\n\nDiamond-Flex-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-(), Diamond-Touch-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-(), and\n\nCarticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-(), together with our trademarks Fabrazyme-TM-,\n\nAfp4-TM-(), GlyPro-TM-, SAGE-TM-, EndoCABG-TM-, Sahara-TM-, Genzyme OPCAB\n\nElite-TM-, Cohn Cardiac Stabilizer-TM-, Switch-Blade-TM-, Seprafilm-TM-,\n\nSepracoat-TM-, Sepramesh-TM-, SepraPak-TM-, CV Seprafilm-TM-, Epicel-TM- and\n\nQuickTack-TM-, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to our business.\n\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\n\nRegulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other\n\ncountries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and\n\ncommercialization of our products and services.\n\nFDA REGULATION\n\nWe expect that all of our products and services will require approval of the\n\nFDA and corresponding agencies in other countries before they can be marketed.\n\nIn the United States, the FDA classifies products as either \"devices,\" \"drugs\"\n\nor \"biologics.\" Products that do not achieve their principal intended purpose\n\nthrough chemical action within or on the body and which are not dependent upon\n\nbeing metabolized by the patient's body in order to be effective are classified\n\nby the FDA as \"devices\" while other products are classified as \"drugs\" or\n\n\"biologics.\"\n\nThe activities required before drugs or biologics may be marketed in the\n\nUnited States include:\n\n- pre-clinical laboratory tests, IN VITRO and IN VIVO pre-clinical studies\n\nand formulation and stability studies;\n\n- the submission to the FDA and approval of an application for human\n\nclinical testing, which is known as an Investigational New Drug\n\napplication;\n\n- adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to prove the safety and\n\neffectiveness of the drug or biologic;\n\n- the submission of a New Drug Application for a drug or a Product License\n\nApplication for a biologic or a Biologic License Application for biologics\n\nidentified by the FDA as \"Specified Biologics;\" and\n\n- the approval by the FDA of the New Drug Application, Product License\n\nApplication or Biologic License Application.\n\nIn addition to product approval, the manufacturer of the product may have to\n\nobtain an establishment license (for a biologic that is not considered well\n\ncharacterized) or a pre-approval Good Manufacturing Practices inspection (for a\n\ndrug or well-characterized biologic) from the FDA. Since any license granted by\n\nthe FDA is both site and process specific, any material change by a company in\n\nthe manufacturing process, equipment or location necessitates additional FDA\n\nreview and approval.\n\nProducts that are classified as devices also require FDA approval prior to\n\nmarketing. Devices are classified as Class I, II or III, depending upon the\n\ninformation available to assure their safety and effectiveness. In general,\n\nClass I and Class II devices are devices whose safety and effectiveness can\n\nreasonably be assured through general or specific controls, respectively.\n\nClass III devices are life\n\n24\n\nsustaining, life supporting or implantable devices or new devices which have\n\nbeen found not to be substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices. The\n\nsteps required for approval of a Class III device include:\n\n- pre-clinical laboratory tests and IN VITRO and IN VIVO pre-clinical\n\nstudies;\n\n- the submission to the FDA and approval of an Investigational Device\n\nExemption application to allow initiation of clinical testing;\n\n- human clinical studies to prove safety and effectiveness of the device;\n\n- the submission of a Pre-Marketing Application; and\n\n- the approval by the FDA of the Pre-Marketing Application.\n\nTypically, clinical testing of devices involves initial testing to evaluate\n\nsafety and feasibility and expanded trials to collect sufficient data to prove\n\nsafety and effectiveness. In addition, the procedures and the facilities used to\n\nmanufacture the device are subject to review and approval by the FDA.\n\nA device (other than a Class III device) which is proven to be substantially\n\nequivalent to a device marketed prior to May 28, 1976, when government\n\nregulations for devices were first introduced, can be marketed after approval of\n\na 510(k) application rather than the filing of an Investigational Device\n\nExemption application and a Pre-Marketing Application. The 510(k) application\n\nmust contain a description of the device, its methods of manufacture and quality\n\ncontrol procedures and the results of testing to demonstrate that the device is\n\nsubstantially equivalent to the device already marketed.\n\nIn May 1996, the FDA published a new guidance document that provided for the\n\nregulation of products such as Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes that\n\nuse manipulated autologous structural cells. Under these regulations, companies\n\nthat currently are not marketing autologous cultured chondrocytes would likely\n\nbe required to provide a prospective randomized blinded control study comparing\n\nthe treatment to alternative treatments. Genzyme Tissue Repair estimates that it\n\ncould take eight years for any competitor to complete a study of this nature\n\nthat would demonstrate the clinical efficacy of its proposed treatment. In\n\nAugust 1997, the FDA granted Genzyme Tissue Repair a Biologic License\n\nApplication under these regulations for Carticel-Registered Trademark-\n\nchondrocytes. Genzyme Tissue Repair has initiated discussions with the FDA\n\nregarding an application for Epicel-TM- skin grafts, which has been on the\n\nmarket as an unregulated medical device. Genzyme Tissue Repair expects that the\n\nFDA will permit Epicel-TM- skin grafts to remain on the market until its\n\nregulatory status is resolved.\n\nThe time and expense required to perform the clinical testing necessary to\n\nobtain FDA approval can far exceed the time and expense of the research and\n\ndevelopment initially required to create the product. Even after initial FDA\n\napproval has been obtained, we could be required to conduct further studies to\n\nprovide additional data on safety or to gain approval for the use of a product\n\nas a treatment for additional clinical indications. In addition, use of these\n\nproducts during testing and after marketing approval has been obtained could\n\nreveal side effects which, if serious, could delay, impede or prevent marketing\n\napproval, limit uses, force a recall of the product or expose us to product\n\nliability claims.\n\nREGULATION OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES\n\nFor marketing outside the United States, we are subject to foreign\n\nregulatory requirements governing human clinical testing and marketing approval\n\nfor our products. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in\n\nthe United States and may require us to perform additional pre-clinical or\n\nclinical testing whether or not FDA approval has been obtained. The amount of\n\ntime required to obtain necessary approvals may be longer or shorter than that\n\nrequired for FDA approval. In many foreign countries, pricing and reimbursement\n\napprovals are also required.\n\n25\n\nOur initial focus for obtaining marketing approval outside the United States\n\nis typically Europe. European Union Regulations and Directives generally\n\nclassify healthcare products either as medicinal products or devices. For\n\nmedicinal products, marketing approval may be sought using either the\n\ncentralized procedure of the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products or the\n\ndecentralized, mutual recognition process. The centralized procedure results in\n\na recommendation in all member states, while the European Union multi-state\n\nprocess involves country by country approval. European Union regulations for\n\nproducts classified as devices have been implemented for some devices. Devices\n\nsuch as the Sepra family of products must receive market approval through a\n\ncentralized procedure, where the device receives a CE Mark allowing distribution\n\nto all member states of the European Union. For those devices where European\n\nUnion regulations have not been implemented, marketing approval must be obtained\n\non a country by country basis. The CE Mark certification requires us to receive\n\nInternational Standards Organization certification for each facility involved in\n\nthe manufacture or distribution of the device. This certification comes only\n\nafter the development of an all inclusive quality system, which is reviewed for\n\ncompliance to International Quality Standards by a licensed \"Notified Body\"\n\nworking within the European Union. After certification is received a product\n\ndossier is reviewed which attests to the product's compliance with European\n\nUnion directive 93/42/EEC for medical devices. Only after this point is a CE\n\nMark granted.\n\nAutologous products are specifically exempt from the European Device\n\nDirective and Pharmaceutical Directive promulgated by the European Union.\n\nTherefore, each European country is free to impose its own regulations on the\n\nmarketing of these products. To date, Genzyme Tissue Repair has not encountered\n\nany local registration requirement for market introduction of\n\nCarticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- chondrocytes. During September 1997, the Spanish\n\nnational health system approved Carticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- chondrocytes for\n\nuse by public hospitals, representing the first broad approval of the product by\n\na reimbursement authority in Europe. Genzyme Tissue Repair is assessing the\n\nregulatory requirements for commercialization of Carticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-\n\nchondrocytes in Japan.\n\nOTHER GOVERNMENT REGULATION\n\nGOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES. All facilities and manufacturing techniques\n\nused for the manufacture of products for clinical use or for sale must comply\n\nwith applicable \"Good Manufacturing Practices,\" the FDA regulations governing\n\nthe production of pharmaceutical products.\n\nORPHAN DRUG ACT. The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers\n\nto develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer\n\nthan 200,000 persons in the United States at the time of application for orphan\n\ndrug designation. The first developer to receive FDA marketing approval for an\n\norphan drug is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United\n\nStates for that product. However, a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically\n\nsuperior to or different from another approved orphan drug, even though for the\n\nsame indication, is not barred from sale in the United States during the\n\nseven-year exclusive marketing period. Similar legislation was adopted in the\n\nEuropean Union in the beginning of 2000, but the market exclusivity granted in\n\nEurope is for ten years.\n\nLegislation periodically has been introduced in recent years to change the\n\nU.S. Orphan Drug Act to shorten the period of automatic market exclusivity and\n\nto allow marketing rights to simultaneous developers of a drug. We cannot be\n\nsure of whether the Orphan Drug act will be amended or, if amended, what effect\n\nthe changes would have on us.\n\nREGULATION OF DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES. The Clinical Laboratories Improvement\n\nAct provides for the regulation of clinical laboratories by the U.S. Department\n\nof Health and Human Services. Regulations promulgated under the act affect our\n\ngenetics laboratories.\n\n26\n\nREGULATION OF GENE THERAPY PRODUCTS. In addition to FDA requirements, the\n\nNational Institutes of Health has established guidelines providing that\n\ntransfers of recombinant DNA into human subjects at NIH laboratories or with NIH\n\nfunds must be approved by the NIH Director. The NIH has established the\n\nRecombinant DNA Advisory Committee to review gene therapy protocols. We expect\n\nthat all of our gene therapy protocols will be subject to review by the\n\nRecombinant DNA Advisory Committee. In the U.K., our gene therapy protocols will\n\nbe subject to review by the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee.\n\nThe recent death of a patient undergoing gene therapy using an adenoviral\n\nvector to deliver the therapeutic gene has been widely publicized. As a result\n\nof the death, the U.S. Senate has commenced hearings to determine whether\n\nadditional legislation is required to protect volunteers and patients who\n\nparticipate in gene therapy clinical trials. Additionally, the Recombinant DNA\n\nAdvisory Committee has discussed extensively the use of adenoviral vectors in\n\ngene therapy clinical trials and intends to issue a report in March 2000 on the\n\nadverse events reported by investigators using adenoviral vectors. Increased\n\nscrutiny could delay or increase the costs of our gene therapy product\n\ndevelopment efforts or clinical trials.\n\nTISSUE AND ORGAN BANK LAWS. A federal criminal statute that prohibits the\n\ntransfer of any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human\n\ntransplantation, but which permits recovery of reasonable costs associated with\n\ntransplant activities. This statute has not been applied to\n\nCarticel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- chondrocytes or Epicel-TM- skin grafts. Certain\n\nstates have laws requiring the licensure of tissue and organ banks and laws\n\ngoverning the sale of human organs and the safety and efficacy of drugs, devices\n\nand biologics, including skin. These state laws could be interpreted to apply to\n\nGenzyme Tissue Repair's production and distribution of cultured tissue products.\n\nProvisions in certain states' statutes prohibit the receipt of valuable\n\nconsideration in connection with the sale of human tissue by a tissue bank, but\n\npermit licensed tissue banks, including companies, to recover their reasonable\n\ncosts associated with human tissue sales. The application of these or other\n\nregulations to Genzyme Tissue Repair could result in significant expense to\n\nGenzyme Tissue Repair, limit reimbursement for Genzyme Tissue Repair's services\n\nand otherwise materially adversely affect Genzyme Tissue Repair's results of\n\noperations.\n\nOTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS. Our operations are or may be subject to various\n\nfederal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe\n\nworking conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the purchase,\n\nstorage, movement, use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous\n\nsubstances used in connection with our research work and manufacturing\n\noperations, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents.\n\nAlthough we believe that our safety procedures comply with the standards\n\nprescribed by federal, state and local regulations, the risk of contamination,\n\ninjury or other accidental harm cannot be eliminated completely. In the event of\n\nan accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any\n\nliabilities could exceed our resources.\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAs of December 31, 1999, we had approximately 3,800 employees, including all\n\nof our consolidated subsidiaries and excluding Genzyme Transgenics. None of our\n\nemployees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our\n\nemployee relations to be excellent.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS\n\nWe have provided the information required by Item 101(c)(1)(xi) of\n\nRegulation S-K in Part II, Item 8, \"Consolidated Financial Statements and\n\nSupplementary Schedules\" and specifically in the Genzyme Corporation and\n\nSubsidiaries Consolidated Statements of Operations and in Note M.,\n\n27\n\n\"Research and Development Agreements\" to our consolidated financial statements\n\nset forth in Exhibit 13.5 to this Form 10-K. We are incorporating that\n\ninformation into this section by reference.\n\nSALES BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA, SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCTS\n\nWe have provided the information required by Items 101(c)(1)(i) and\n\n(vii) and 101(d) of Regulation S-K in the 1999 Genzyme General Annual Report\n\nunder the heading \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Genzyme Corporation\n\nand Subsidiaries' Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and in Note Q.,\n\n\"Segment Information\" to our consolidated financial statements set forth in\n\nExhibit 13.5 to this Form 10-K.
