BECAUSE THIS IS ONLY A SUMMARY, IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU SHOULD READ THE ENTIRE PROSPECTUS CAREFULLY, INCLUDING \"RISK FACTORS\" AND OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES, BEFORE DECIDING TO INVEST IN OUR COMMON STOCK. STEMCELLS, INC. We are engaged in research and development efforts focused on the identification, isolation and expansion of stem cells as the underlying technology for developing potential cell transplant therapies. Stem cells are key cells in the body that produce all of the functional mature cell types found in normal, healthy individuals. Our goal is to develop therapies that will use stem cells to repopulate or repair tissues, such as those of the brain, pancreas or liver, that have been damaged or lost as a result of disease or injury. All of our programs are currently at the discovery or pre-clinical stage. Many diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other degenerative diseases of the brain or nervous system, involve the failure of organs that cannot be transplanted. Other diseases, such as hepatitis and diabetes, involve organs such as the liver or pancreas that can be transplanted, but there is a very limited supply of those organs available for transplant. We estimate based on information available to us from the Alzheimer's Association, the Centers for Disease Control, the Family Caregiver's Alliance and the Spinal Cord Injury Information Network, that these conditions affect more than 18 million people in the United States and account for more than $150 billion annually in health care costs. We believe that our stem cell technologies, if successfully developed, may provide the basis for effective therapies for these and other conditions. Our aim is to return patients to productive lives and significantly reduce the substantial health care costs often associated with these diseases and disorders. We have made significant progress toward developing stem cell therapies for the nervous system by identifying and characterizing the human central nervous system stem cell. We have also made significant advances in our search for the stem cells of the pancreas and the liver by identifying novel markers on the surface of cells so they can be isolated and tested to determine whether they are stem cells. We have established our intellectual property position with respect to stem cell therapies for each of these three areas--the central nervous system, the pancreas and the liver--by patenting or seeking patent protection for our discoveries and by entering into exclusive licensing arrangements. Our portfolio of issued patents includes a method of culturing normal human neural stem cells in our proprietary medium, and our published studies show that our cultured and expanded cells give rise to all three major cell types of the central nervous system. In addition, the Company recently announced the results of a new study that showed that human brain stem cells can be successfully isolated with the use of markers present on the surface of freshly obtained brain cells. We believe this is the first reproducible process for isolating highly purified populations of well-characterized normal human neural stem cells, and we have applied for a composition of matter patent. We also have filed an improved process patent for the growth and expansion of these purified normal human neural cells. Historical Note: We were formerly known as CytoTherapeutics and were incorporated in Delaware in 1988. We currently have one subsidiary, StemCells California, Inc., a California corporation we acquired in September 1997. Until mid-1999, we had programs in a different technology, encapsulated cell therapy, as well as stem cell programs. In 1999, we embarked on a major restructuring of our research and development operations and sold the encapsulated cell therapy technology. We now focus exclusively on the discovery, development and commercialization of our proprietary platform of stem cell technologies. 1 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS SALE OF MODEX SHARES On April 30, 2001, we sold 103,577 shares in Modex Therapeutics, Ltd., a Swiss biotherapeutics company, for a net price of 87.30 Swiss Francs per share, which converts to approximately $50.30, for total proceeds of approximately $5,200,000, net of commissions and fees. We no longer hold any shares of Modex. See \"Business--Corporate Collaboration.\" COMMON STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT RELATING TO EQUITY LINE On May 10, 2001, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Sativum Investments Limited for the potential future issuance and sale of up to $30,000,000 of our common stock, subject to restrictions and other obligations that are described throughout this prospectus. We, at our sole discretion, may draw down on this facility, sometimes termed an equity line, from time to time, and Sativum is obligated to purchase shares of our common stock at a 6% discount to a volume weighted average market price over the 20 trading days following the drawdown notice. Our volume weighted average market price is calculated by adding the total dollars traded in every transaction in a given trading day and dividing that number by the total number of shares traded during that trading day. We are limited with respect to how often we can exercise a drawdown and the amount of each drawdown. In connection with the equity line, we issued a warrant to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock to Sativum and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 100,000 shares of common stock to placement agents, all at $2.38 per share. Our placement agents have exercised their warrants in full. We delivered a draw down notice to Sativum Investments Limited, dated as of July 11, 2001, in connection with the common stock purchase agreement dated as of May 10, 2001 evidencing an equity line facility between us and Sativum. In the draw down notice, we notified Sativum that we are exercising our right to sell up to $5,000,000 of our common stock to Sativum based on the formula in the stock purchase agreement, during the 20 trading days beginning on July 12, 2001, and ending on August 8, 2001. During the first 10 trading days, Sativum purchased a total of 425,134 shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $5.88 per share, net of Sativum's discount of six percent. Our placement agents, Pacific Crest Securities, Inc. and Granite Financial Group, Inc. received $50,000 and $25,000, respectively, as placement fees in connection with this draw down, resulting in net proceeds to us of $2,424,000 for the first 10 trading day settlement period after paying escrow fees. On July 2, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective a registration statement with respect to up to 10,350,000 shares of our common stock which we may issue pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement and related warrants. We are not required to purchase any shares under the equity line and cannot sell more than 3,922,606 shares pursuant to the agreement without stockholder approval. ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS On June 7, 2001, we announced the issuance to us of two new patents that further our proprietary position in our neural and pancreatic research programs. The first patent is a process patent that covers a novel method to separate neural stem cells for growth in culture. The second patent covers a unique model useful for identifying stem cells for the pancreas and liver. With these new patents, we now own or have exclusive license to 25 issued U.S. patents in the neural stem cell field, as well as fifteen U.S. applications, including two that have been allowed, and pending foreign counterparts. ISSUANCE OF SHARES AND WARRANTS TO MILLENNIUM PARTNERS On June 8, 2001, Millennium Partners, L.P. exercised an option to purchase $2,000,000 of our common stock that it received in connection with an earlier purchase of our common stock. At the closing on June 21, 2001, Millennium purchased 457,750 shares of our common stock at $4.3692 per share. We received $1,500,000 of the purchase price at the closing on June 21, 2001, and we will receive 2 the remaining $500,000 upon effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. Millennium also received a warrant to purchase 50,352 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $4.7664. This warrant is callable by us at any time at $7.944 per underlying share. In addition, Millennium received an adjustable warrant similar to the adjustable warrant issued to Millennium on August 3, 2000. See \"Description of Capital Stock--Warrants.\" We agreed to file a registration statement covering resales of the issued shares and the shares underlying the warrants from time to time by Millennium. See \"Selling Stockholder.\" ------------------------ Our principal executive office is located at 3155 Porter Drive, Palo Alto, California 94304 and our telephone number is (650) 475-3100.

As part of this restructuring we terminated all activities related to our former encapsulated cell technology and we relocated our headquarters from Rhode Island to California. The results shown for the year ended December 31, 1999 and 2000 includes $6,047,806 and $3,327,360, respectively, in expenses related to the restructuring. For more information on this restructuring see \"Business\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and our consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. During 2000, in connection with our investment in Modex Therapeutics, Ltd., a Swiss biotechnology company that completed an initial public offering on June 23, 2000, we realized a $1,427,686 gain and recognized an increase in value related to our remaining holdings of $16,356,334 as of December 31, 2000. During the three months ended March 31, 2001, we realized a gain of $2,550,000 in connection with further sales of Modex shares. After a subsequent sale on April 30, 2001, we no longer hold any shares of Modex. For more information on Modex, see \"Recent Developments\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and our consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. 5 RISK FACTORS THE OFFERING INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW AND THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION REGARDING STEMCELLS, INC.OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ANY OF THESE RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR. CONSEQUENTIALLY, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE, RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT. OUR TECHNOLOGY IS AT AN EARLY STAGE OF DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT, AND WE MAY FAIL TO DEVELOP ANY COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE PRODUCTS. Our stem cell technology is at the early pre-clinical stage for the brain stem cell and at the discovery phase for the liver and pancreas stem cells and has not yet led to the development of any product. We may fail to discover the stem cells we are seeking, to develop any products, to obtain regulatory approvals, to enter clinical trials, or to commercialize any products. Any product using stem cell technology may fail to: - survive and persist in the desired location; - provide the intended therapeutic benefits; - properly integrate into existing tissue in the desired manner; or - achieve therapeutic benefits equal to or better than the standard of treatment at the time of testing. In addition, our products may cause undesirable side effects. Results of early pre-clinical research may not be indicative of the results that will be obtained in later stages of pre-clinical or clinical research. If regulatory authorities do not approve our products, or if we fail to maintain regulatory compliance, we would have limited ability to commercialize our products, and our business and results of operations would be harmed. Furthermore, because stem cells are a new form of therapy, the marketplace may not accept any products we may develop. If we do succeed in developing products, we will face many potential obstacles such as the need to obtain regulatory approvals, and to develop or obtain manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities. In addition, we will face substantial additional risks such as product liability. WE HAVE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS RESULTING FROM REAL PROPERTY OWNED OR LEASED BY US IN RHODE ISLAND, WHICH DIVERTS FUNDING FROM OUR STEM CELL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. Prior to our reorganization in 1999 and the consolidation of our business in California, we carried out our encapsulated cell therapy programs in Lincoln, Rhode Island, where we also had our administrative offices. Although we have vacated the Rhode Island facilities, we remain obligated to make lease payments and operating costs of approximately $1,200,000 per year for our former science and administrative facility, which we have leased through June 30, 2013, and debt service payments and operating costs of approximately $1,000,000 per year for our former encapsulated cell therapy pilot manufacturing facility, which we own. We are currently seeking to sublease the science and administrative facility and to sell the pilot manufacturing facility, but may not be able to do so. These continuing costs significantly reduce our cash resources and adversely affect our ability to fund further development of our stem cell technology. In March 2001, our landlord approved a sublease of part of the premises. WE MAY NEED BUT FAIL TO OBTAIN PARTNERS TO SUPPORT OUR STEM CELL DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS AND TO COMMERCIALIZE OUR TECHNOLOGY. Equity and debt financings alone may not be sufficient to fund the cost of developing our stem cell technologies, and we may need to rely on our ability to reach partnering arrangements to provide financial support for our stem cell discovery and development efforts. In addition, in order to 6 successfully develop and commercialize our technology, we may need to enter into a wide variety of arrangements with corporate sponsors, pharmaceutical companies, universities, research groups and others. While we have engaged, and expect to continue to engage, in discussions regarding such arrangements, we have not reached any agreement, and we may fail to obtain any such agreement on terms acceptable to us. Even if we enter into these arrangements, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations under them or renew or replace them after their original terms expire. Furthermore, these arrangements may require us to grant certain rights to third parties, including exclusive marketing rights to one or more products, may require us to issue securities to our collaborators or may contain other terms that are burdensome to us. If any of our collaborators terminates its relationship with us or fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner, the development or commercialization of our technology and potential products may be adversely affected. WE HAVE A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES AND WE MAY FAIL TO OBTAIN REVENUES OR BECOME PROFITABLE. We have incurred $130,229,646 in operating losses through March 31, 2001 and expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future in order to conduct our research and development activities, and, if those activities are successful, to fund clinical trials and other expenses. These expenses include the cost of acquiring technology, product testing, acquiring regulatory approvals, establishing production, marketing, sales and distribution programs and administrative expenses. We have not earned any revenues from sales of any product. All of our past revenues have been derived from, and any revenues we may obtain for the foreseeable future are expected to be derived from, cooperative agreements, research grants, investments and interest on invested capital. We currently have no cooperative agreements and we have received only two research grants for our stem cell technology, and we may not obtain any such agreements or additional grants in the future or receive any revenues from them. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION WILL BE HARMED. We own or license a number of patents and pending patent applications covering human nerve stem cell cultures, central nervous system stem cell cultures, neuroblast cultures, peripheral nervous system stem cell cultures, and an animal model for liver failure. Patent protection for products such as those we propose to develop is highly uncertain and involves complex and continually evolving factual and legal questions. The governmental authorities that consider patent applications can deny or significantly reduce the patent coverage requested in an application before or after issuing the patent. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our pending applications will result in the issuance of patents, or if any existing or future patents will provide sufficient protection or significant commercial advantage or if others will circumvent these patents. We cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions because patent applications are secret until patents are issued in the United States or until the applications are published in foreign countries, and because publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries. Patents may not issue from our pending or future patent applications or, if issued, may not be of commercial benefit to us, or may not afford us adequate protection from competing products. In addition, third parties may challenge our patents or governmental authorities may declare them invalid. In the event that a third party has also filed a patent application relating to inventions claimed in our patent applications, we may have to participate in proceedings to determine priority of invention. This could result in substantial uncertainties and cost for us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, and the outcome might not be favorable to us. Even if a patent issues, a court could decide that the patent was issued invalidly. Proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how are also important to our research and development activities. We cannot be certain that others will not independently develop the same or 7 similar technologies on their own or gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we will be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how and keep them secret. We require our employees, consultants, and significant scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. These agreements may, however, fail to provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for us in the event of unauthorized use, transfer or disclosure of such information or inventions. IF OTHERS ARE FIRST TO DISCOVER AND PATENT THE STEM CELLS WE ARE SEEKING TO DISCOVER, WE COULD BE BLOCKED FROM FURTHER WORK ON THOSE STEM CELLS. Because the first person or entity to discover and obtain a valid patent to a particular stem or progenitor cell may effectively block all others, it will be important for us or our collaborators to be the first to discover any stem cell that we are seeking to discover. Failure to be the first could prevent us from commercializing all of our research and development affected by that patent. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN NECESSARY LICENSES TO THIRD PARTY PATENTS AND OTHER RIGHTS. A number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies, universities and research institutions have filed patent applications or have received patents relating to cell therapy, stem cells and other technologies potentially relevant to or necessary for our expected products. We cannot predict which, if any, of the applications will issue as patents. If third party patents or patent applications contain claims infringed by our technology and these claims are valid, we may be unable to obtain licenses to these patents at a reasonable cost, if at all, and may also be unable to develop or obtain alternative technology. If we are unable to obtain such licenses at a reasonable cost, our business could be significantly harmed. We have obtained rights from universities and research institutions to technologies, processes and compounds that we believe may be important to the development of our products. Licensors may cancel our licenses or convert them to non-exclusive licenses if we fail to use the relevant technology or otherwise breach these agreements. Loss of these licenses could expose us to the risks of third party patents and/or technology. We can give no assurance that any of these licenses will provide effective protection against our competitors. WE COMPETE WITH COMPANIES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES OVER US. The market for therapeutic products that address degenerative diseases is large and competition is intense. We expect competition to increase. We believe that our most significant competitors will be fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and more established biotechnology companies, such as Biogen, Inc. and Genzyme, an Elan Corporation. These companies already produce or are developing treatments for degenerative diseases that are not stem cell-based, and they have significantly greater capital resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than we do. Many of these potential competitors have significant products approved or in development that could be competitive with our potential products, and also operate large, well-funded research and development programs. In addition, we expect to compete with smaller companies such as NeuralStem and Layton Bioscience and with universities and other research institutions who are developing treatments for degenerative diseases that are stem cell-based. Our competitors may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than the ones we are developing, or that would render our technology obsolete or non-competitive. The relative speed with which we and our competitors can develop products, complete the clinical testing and approval processes, and supply commercial quantities of a product to market will affect our ability to gather market acceptance and market share. With respect to clinical testing, competition may 8 delay progress by limiting the number of clinical investigators and patients available to test our potential products. DEVELOPMENT OF OUR TECHNOLOGY IS SUBJECT TO AND RESTRICTED BY EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION. Our research and development efforts, as well as any future clinical trials, and the manufacturing and marketing of any products we may develop, will be subject to and restricted by extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The process of obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other necessary regulatory approvals is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. We or our collaborators may fail to obtain the necessary approvals to commence or continue clinical testing or to manufacture or market our potential products in reasonable time frames, if at all. In addition, the U.S. Congress and other legislative bodies may enact regulatory reforms or restrictions on the development of new therapies that could adversely affect the regulatory environment in which we operate or the development of any products we may develop. We base our research and development on the use of human stem and progenitor cells obtained from fetal tissue. The federal and state governments and other jurisdictions impose restrictions on the use of fetal tissue. These restrictions change from time to time and may become more onerous. Additionally, we may not be able to identify or develop reliable sources for the cells necessary for our potential products--that is, sources that follow all state and federal guidelines for cell procurement. Further, we may not be able to obtain such cells in the quantity or quality sufficient to satisfy the commercial requirements of our potential products. As a result, we may be unable to develop or produce our products in a profitable manner. We may apply for status under the Orphan Drug Act for some of our therapies to gain a seven year period of marketing exclusivity for those therapies. The U.S. Congress in the past has considered, and in the future again may consider, legislation that would restrict the extent and duration of the market exclusivity of an orphan drug. If enacted, such legislation could prevent us from obtaining some or all of the benefits of the existing statute even if we were to apply for and be granted orphan drug status with respect to a potential product. WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF KEY PERSONNEL. We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff and some of our outside consultants, including the members of our scientific advisory board, our chief executive officer, each of our vice presidents and the directors of our neural stem cell and liver stem cell programs. Although we have entered into employment agreements with some of these individuals, they may terminate their agreements at any time. We currently have outside consultants and interim personnel, rather than permanent employees, in key management and scientific positions. Loss of services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our operations because these individuals possess management experience or specialized scientific skills that we do not otherwise have and that we may not be able to replace. In addition, our operations are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified scientific and management personnel. We may not be able to attract and retain the personnel we need on acceptable terms given the competition for experienced personnel among pharmaceutical, biotechnology and health care companies, universities and research institutions. If we lose the services of these key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, we may have to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs. HEALTH CARE INSURERS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS MAY NOT PAY FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR MAY IMPOSE LIMITS ON REIMBURSEMENTS. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of potential products are likely to depend in part upon the availability and amounts of reimbursement from third party health care payor organizations, including government agencies, private health care insurers and other health care payors, such as health 9 maintenance organizations and self-insured employee plans. There is considerable pressure to reduce the cost of therapeutic products, and government and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products, and by refusing, in some cases, to provide any coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not granted marketing approval. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. We can give no assurance that reimbursement will be provided by such payors at all or without substantial delay, or, if such reimbursement is provided, that the approved reimbursement amounts will be sufficient to enable us to sell products we develop on a profitable basis. Changes in reimbursement policy could also adversely affect the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to collaborate with us on the development of our stem cell technology. In certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control. We also expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement government control over health care costs. Efforts at health care reform are likely to continue in future legislative sessions. We do not know what legislative proposals federal or state governments will adopt or what actions federal, state or private payers for health care goods and services may take in response to health care reform proposals or legislation. We cannot predict the effect government control and other health care reforms may have on our business. WE HAVE LIMITED LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AND MAY NOT OBTAIN THE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL RESOURCES WE WILL NEED TO SUSTAIN OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. We have limited liquidity and capital resources and must obtain substantial additional capital to support our research and development programs, for acquisition of technology and intellectual property rights, and, to the extent we decide to undertake these activities ourselves, for pre-clinical and clinical testing of our anticipated products, pursuit of regulatory approvals, establishment of production capabilities, establishment of marketing and sales capabilities and distribution channels, and general administrative expenses. If we do not obtain the necessary capital resources, we may have to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs or license our technology or any potential products to third parties rather than commercializing them ourselves. If we are unable to draw down on our equity line or choose not to do so, we intend to pursue our needed capital resources through equity and debt financings, corporate alliances, grants and collaborative research arrangements. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation--Liquidity and Capital Resources.\" We may fail to obtain the necessary capital resources from any such sources when needed or on terms acceptable to us. Our ability to complete any such arrangements successfully will depend upon market conditions and, more specifically, on continued progress in our research and development efforts. We are prohibited from entering into other stand-by equity based credit facilities during the term of the common stock purchase agreement that governs our equity line. IF OUR COMMON STOCK PRICE DROPS SIGNIFICANTLY, WE MAY BE DELISTED FROM THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET, WHICH COULD ELIMINATE THE TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. Our common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market. In order to continue to be included in the Nasdaq National Market, a company must meet Nasdaq's maintenance criteria. The maintenance criteria most applicable to us requires a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, $4,000,000 in net tangible assets and $5,000,000 market value of the public float. The public float excludes shares held directly or indirectly by any of our officers, directors and holders of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock. As of March 31, 2001, we had approximately $15.4 million of net tangible assets. As of May 24, 2001, the market value of our public float was approximately $71.6 million, and the lowest bid price of our common stock since March 31, 2001 was $1.47. We cannot assure you that we will continue to meet these listing criteria. The issuance by us of shares of common stock to Sativum, or the 10 subsequent resale by investors of those shares, in either case at a discount to the market price, may cause the trading price of our common stock to fall to a level below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement. Failure to meet these maintenance criteria may result in the delisting of our common stock from the Nasdaq National Market. If our common stock is delisted and in order to have our common stock relisted on the Nasdaq National Market, we would be required to meet the criteria for initial listing, which are more stringent than the maintenance criteria. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that if we were delisted we would be able to have our common stock relisted on the Nasdaq National Market. If our common stock were delisted from the Nasdaq National Market, we would not be able to draw down any additional funds on the equity line, and we also may be required to pay damages to other holders of our common stock under agreements we previously entered into with them in connection with equity financings. Finally, if our common stock were removed from listing on the Nasdaq National Market, it might become more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock. 11 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This prospectus includes forward-looking statements. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"possibly,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"project,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate\" and \"continue\" or similar words. You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our future expectations, contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial condition, or state other \"forward-looking\" information. We believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our investors. However, there will be events in the future that we have not been able to accurately predict or control and that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed. For example, contaminations at our facilities, changes in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries, competition and changes in government regulations or general economic or market conditions could all have significant effects on our results. These factors should be considered carefully and readers should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Before you invest in our common stock, you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in the \"Risk Factors,\" \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and \"Business\" sections and elsewhere in this prospectus could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. All forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements and risk factors contained throughout this prospectus. INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA In this prospectus, we rely on and refer to information and statistics regarding disease occurrences, costs of treatment, biotechnology, and the market sectors in which we may compete in the future. We obtained this information and statistics from various third party sources, discussions with our consultants and/or our own internal estimates. We believe that these sources and estimates are reliable, but we have not independently verified them. USE OF PROCEEDS We will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale of shares offered by the selling stockholder under this prospectus. 12 PRICE RANGE OF COMMON STOCK Our common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol \"STEM.\" The following table sets forth the high and low sale prices of our common stock for the periods indicated on the Nasdaq National Market.\n\nCOMMON STOCK PRICE ------------------- HIGH LOW -------- -------- First Quarter 1999...................................... $ 1.78 $1.16 Second Quarter 1999..................................... $ 1.37 $0.53 Third Quarter 1999...................................... $ 2.38 $0.69 Fourth Quarter 1999..................................... $ 1.62 $1.00 First Quarter 2000...................................... $20.00 $1.38 Second Quarter 2000..................................... $ 8.06 $2.00 Third Quarter 2000...................................... $11.67 $3.53 Fourth Quarter 2000..................................... $ 6.75 $2.25 First Quarter 2001...................................... $ 3.75 $1.72 Second Quarter 2001..................................... $ 6.15 $1.47\n\nThere were approximately 287 record holders of our common stock as of April 25, 2001.

THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS DISCUSSION REGARDING OUR EXPECTATIONS REGARDING OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AND OTHER NON-HISTORICAL STATEMENTS IN THIS DISCUSSION INVOLVE NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AS DESCRIBED IN THE \"RISK FACTORS\" SECTION OF THIS PROSPECTUS. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Since our inception in 1988, we have been primarily engaged in research and development of human therapeutic products. At the beginning of 1999, our corporate headquarters, most of our employees, and the main focus of our operations were primarily devoted to a different technology--encapsulated cell therapy, or ECT. Since that time, we terminated a clinical trial of the ECT then in progress, we wound down our other operations relating to the ECT, we terminated the employment of those who worked on the ECT, we sold the ECT and we relocated from Rhode Island to California. As a result of a restructuring in the second half of 1999, our sole focus is now on our stem cell technology. The year 2000 was a year of transition, in which we completed the consolidation and restructuring of our operations. Comparisons with results of operations prior to 2000 are correspondingly less meaningful than they may be under other circumstances. We were known as CytoTherapeutics, Inc., until May 23, 2000, when we changed our name to StemCells, Inc. We have not derived any revenues from the sale of any products, and we do not expect to receive revenues from product sales for at least several years. We have not commercialized any product and in order to do so we must, among other things, substantially increase our research and development expenditures as research and product development efforts accelerate and clinical trials are initiated. We have incurred annual operating losses since inception and expect to incur substantial operating losses in the future. As a result, we are dependent upon external financing from equity and debt offerings and revenues from collaborative research arrangements with corporate sponsors to finance our operations. There are no such collaborative research arrangements at this time and there can be no assurance that such or partnering revenues will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us. Our results of operations have varied significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and may vary significantly in the future due to the occurrence of material, nonrecurring events, including without limitation the receipt of one-time, nonrecurring licensing payments, sale of marketable securities and the initiation or termination of research collaborations, in addition to the winding-down of terminated research and development programs referred to above. THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2001 AND 2000 For the three months ended March 31, 2001, revenues from grants totaled $100,000. There was no such revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2000. On January 9, 2001, we sold 22,616 Modex shares for a net price of 182.00 Swiss francs per share, which converts to $112.76 per share, for total proceeds and a realized gain of $2,550,000. Research and development expenses totaled $1,644,257 for the three months ended March 31, 2001, compared with $906,632 for the same period in 2000. The increase of $737,625 or 81% from 2000 to 2001 was primarily attributable to the related costs of an increase in personnel from 11 full time 16 employees to 19 full time employees to facilitate the expansion of our research programs and initiate development and the cost of leasing a larger facility. General and administrative expenses were $996,862 for the three months ended March 31, 2001, compared with $657,714 for the same period in 2000. The increase of $339,148, or 52%, from 2000 to 2001 was primarily attributable to the related costs of an increase in personnel from 5 full time employees to 8 full time employees, which included the hiring of senior management personnel as part of the restructuring and consolidation of our operations in California and the cost of leasing a larger facility. Wind-down expenses related to our ECT research, our Rhode Island operations and the transfer of our headquarters to California for the three months ended March 31, 2000 were $234,386. In December 2000, we created a reserve of $1,780,578 related to the carrying costs for the Rhode Island facilities through 2001. At March 31, 2001 the reserve was $1,381,946. Interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2001 and 2000 was $79,041 and $73,332 respectively. Interest expense of $64,460 for the three months ended March 31, 2001 was booked against the wind-down reserve created in 2000 for the whole of 2001, as the expense was part of the bond payments related to the Rhode Island facilities. Interest expense for the same period in 2000 was $68,858. The decrease in 2001 was attributable to lower outstanding debt and capital lease balances in 2001 compared to 2000. Other income for the three months ended March 31, 2001 was $180,389, which was a refund from the Citizens Bank of Rhode Island for an overpayment of property taxes in prior years. Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2001 was $268,541 or $0.01 per share, as compared to net loss of $1,794,258, or $0.09 per share, for the comparable period in 2000. The decrease in net loss of $2,062,800 or 115% from the same period in 2000 was primarily attributable to a realized gain of $2,550,230 from the sale of a portion of our Modex investment, offset by an increase in expenses attributable to an increase in personnel and the costs associated with our move to a larger facility. YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, 1999 AND 1998 Revenues totaled $74,000, $5,022,000 and $8,803,000 for the years ending December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Revenues for 2000 are from Neurotech, S.A. in return for the assignment of our intellectual property assets relating to Encapsulated Cell Technology. Revenues for 1999 and 1998 were from collaborative agreements, earned primarily from a Development, Marketing and License Agreement with AstraZeneca Group plc, which was signed in March 1995. The decrease in revenues from 1998 to 1999 to 2000 resulted primarily from the June 1999 termination of the Astra agreement. Research and development expenses totaled $5,979,000 in 2000, as compared to $9,984,000 in 1999 and $17,659,000 in 1998. The decrease of $4,005,000, or 40%, from 1999 to 2000 and the decrease of $7,675,000 or 43%, from 1998 to 1999, was primarily attributable to the wind-down of research activities relating to our encapsulated cell technology, precipitated by termination of the Astra Agreement. General and administrative expenses were $3,361,000 in 2000, compared with $4,927,000 in 1999 and $4,603,000 in 1998. The decrease of $1,566,000 or 32%, from 1999 to 2000 was primarily attributable to the relocation of our headquarters to a smaller facility as well as a reduction of personnel. Wind-down expenses related to our ECT research, our Rhode Island operations and the transfer of our headquarters to California totaled $3,327,000 and $6,048,000 for 2000 and 1999, respectively. No such expenses were incurred in 1998. 1999 expenses included accruals of approximately $1.6 million for employee severance costs, $1.9 million in losses and reserves for the write-down of related patents and fixed assets, $1.2 million for our costs of settlement of a 1989 funding agreement with RIPSAT, 17 $700,000 of estimated additional carrying costs through June 30, 2000, and other related expenses totaling $760,000. During 2000, we incurred approximately $290,000 of costs in excess of the amounts accrued as of December 31, 1999 for the carrying costs, including lease payments, property taxes and utilities, through the expected June 30, 2000 disposition of the Rhode Island facilities. During the third and fourth quarters of 2000 we incurred additional $1.3 million in carrying costs for the Rhode Island facilities, because we were unable to dispose of them as we had expected. We have created a reserve of $1,780,000 related to the carrying costs for the Rhode Island facilities through 2001. In February 2001, we subleased portions of the facilities and are actively seeking to sublease, assign or sell our remaining interests in the properties. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of these facilities in a reasonable time, if at all. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 totaled $303,000, $564,000 and $1,254,000, respectively. The average cash and investment balances were $5,668,000, $10,663,000 and $21,795,000 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The decrease in interest income from 1998 to 1999 to 2000 was attributable to lower average balances. In 2000, interest expense was $273,000, compared to $335,000 in 1999 and $472,000 in 1998. The decrease from 1998 to 1999 to 2000 was attributable to lower outstanding debt and capital lease balances. During the second quarter 2000 we realized a $1,427,000 gain in connection with the sale of a portion of our investment in Modex. Modex Therapeutics, Ltd., a Swiss biotechnology company that completed an initial public offering on June 23, 2000, and is publicly traded on the Swiss Neue Market exchange. The net loss in 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $11,125,000, $15,709,000, and $12,628,000, respectively. The loss per share was $0.58, $.84 and $.69 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The decrease from 1999 to 2000 is primarily attributable to the wind-down of our encapsulated cell technology research and our Rhode Island operations and offset by the elimination of revenue from the Astra Agreement. The increase from 1998 to 1999 is primarily attributable to the elimination of revenue from the Astra Agreement, which was terminated in June 1999, as well as expenses related to the wind-down of our encapsulated cell technology research and our other Rhode Island operations, the transfer of our corporate headquarters to California and an accrual for the our estimate of the costs of settlement of a funding agreement with RIPSAT. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Since our inception, we have financed our operations through the sale of our common and preferred stock, the issuance of long-term debt and capitalized lease obligations, revenues from collaborative agreements, research grants, sales of marketable securities and interest income. We had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $4,499,000 at March 31, 2001. Cash equivalents are invested in money market funds. Our liquidity and capital resources were, in the past, significantly affected by our relationships with corporate partners, which were related to our former encapsulated cell technology, or ECT. These relationships are now terminated, and we have not yet established corporate partnerships with respect to our stem cell technology. In the third quarter of 1999, we announced restructuring plans to wind down operations relating to our ECT and to focus our resources on the research and development of our platform of proprietary stem cell technologies. We terminated approximately 68 full time employees and, in October 1999, relocated our corporate headquarters to California. As part of our restructuring of operations and relocation of corporate headquarters to California, we identified a significant amount of excess fixed 18 assets. In December 1999, we completed the disposition of those excess fixed assets, from which we received more than $746,000. On December 30, 1999 we sold our ECT and assigned our intellectual property assets in it to Neurotech S.A. for a payment of $3,000,000, royalties on future product sales, and a portion of certain Neurotech revenues from third parties. In addition, we retained certain non-exclusive rights to use ECT in combination with our proprietary stem cell technologies and in the field of vaccines for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. In July 1999, as a result of our decision to close our Rhode Island facilities, the Rhode Island Partnership for Science and Technology, or RIPSAT, alleged that we were in default under a June, 1989 Funding Agreement, and demanded payment of approximately $2.6 million. While we believe we were not in default under the Funding Agreement, we deemed it best to resolve the dispute without litigation and, on March 3, 2000, entered into a settlement agreement with RIPSAT, the Rhode Island Industrial Recreational Building Authority, or IRBA, and the Rhode Island Industrial Facilities Corporation, or RIIFC. We agreed to pay RIPSAT $1,172,000 in full satisfaction of all of our obligations to them under the Funding Agreement. At the same time, IRBA agreed to return to us the full amount of our debt service reserve, comprising approximately $610,000 of principal and interest, relating to the bonds we had with IRBA and RIIFC. The $610,000 debt service reserve was transferred directly to RIPSAT, leaving the remainder of approximately $562,000 to be paid by us. We made this payment in March of 2000. Our liquidity and capital resources could have also been affected by a claim by Genentech, Inc., arising out of the their collaborative development and licensing agreement with us relating to the development of products for the treatment of Parkinson's disease; however, the claim was resolved with no effect on our resources. On May 21, 1998, Genentech exercised its right to terminate the Parkinson's collaboration and demanded that we redeem, for approximately $3,100,000, certain shares of our redeemable Common Stock held by Genentech. Genentech's claim was based on provisions in the agreement requiring us to redeem, at the price of $10.01 per share, the shares representing the difference between the funds invested by Genentech to acquire such stock and the amount expended by us on the terminated program less an additional $1,000,000. In March 2000, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with Genentech under which Genentech released us from any obligation to redeem any shares of our Common Stock held by Genentech, without cost to us. Accordingly, the $5.2 million of redeemable common stock shown as a liability in our December 31, 1999 balance sheet was transferred to equity in March, 2000 without any impact on our liquidity and capital resources. We and Genentech also agreed that all collaborations between us were terminated, and that neither of us had any rights to the intellectual property of the other. We continue to have outstanding obligations in regard to our former facilities in Lincoln, Rhode Island, including lease payments and operating costs of approximately $1,200,000 per year associated with our former research laboratory and corporate headquarters building, and debt service payments and operating costs of approximately $1,000,000 per year with respect to our pilot manufacturing and cell processing facility. We are actively seeking to sublease, assign or sell our interests in these facilities. Failure to do so within a reasonable period of time will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources. CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK On April 13, 2000, we sold 1,500 shares of our 6% cumulative convertible preferred stock plus warrants for a total of 75,000 shares of our common stock to two members of our Board of Directors for $1,500,000, on terms more favorable to us than we were able to obtain from outside investors. The face value of the shares of preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holders into common stock at $3.77 per share. The holders of the preferred stock have liquidation rights equal to their original investments plus accrued but unpaid dividends. Any unconverted preferred stock will be 19 converted to common stock, at the applicable conversion price, on April 13, 2002. The warrants expire on April 13, 2005. MILLENNIUM PARTNERS On August 3, 2000, we completed a $4 million common stock financing transaction with Millennium Partners, LP, or the Fund, an investment fund with more than $1 billion in assets under management. The Fund purchased our common stock at $4.33 per share. The Fund is entitled, pursuant to an adjustable warrant issued on August 3, 2000 in connection with the sale of common stock to the Fund, to purchase additional shares of common stock for $0.01 per share. The adjustments to the adjustable warrant are calculated on eight dates beginning six months from the closing and every three months thereafter. The number of additional shares the Fund may be entitled to on each date will be based on the number of shares of common stock the Fund continues to hold on each date and the market price of our common stock over a period prior to each date. We have the right, under certain circumstances, to cap the number of additional shares by purchasing part of the entitlement from the Fund. On January 27, 2001, the Fund's adjustable warrant became exercisable for 463,369 shares of our common stock, and the Fund purchased all of those shares on March 30, 2001, for $4,634. On April 27, 2001, the Fund's adjustable warrant became exercisable for an additional 622,469 shares of our common stock, and the Fund purchased all of those shares on July 19, 2001 for $6,225. The Fund also received on August 3, 2000 a warrant to purchase up to 101,587 shares of common stock at $4.725 per share. This warrant is callable by us at $7.875 per underlying share. In addition, the Fund was granted an option for twelve months to purchase up to $3 million of additional common stock. On August 23, 2000 the Fund exercised $1,000,000 of its option to purchase additional common stock at $5.53 per share. The Fund paid $750,000 of the purchase price in connection with the closing on August 30, 2000, and paid the remaining $250,000 upon effectiveness of a registration statement covering the shares owned by the Fund. At the closing on August 30, 2000, we issued to the Fund an adjustable warrant similar to the one issued on August 3, 2000. This adjustable warrant was canceled by agreement between us and the Fund on November 1, 2000. The Fund also received on August 23, 2000 a warrant to purchase up to 19,900 shares of common stock at $6.03 per share. This warrant is callable by us at any time at $10.05 per underlying share. On June 8, 2001, the Fund exercised its remaining option to purchase $2 million of our common stock. At the closing on June 21, 2001, the Fund purchased 457,750 shares of our common stock at $4.3692 per share. The Fund paid $1,500,000 of the purchase price at the closing and will pay the remainder upon effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. In connection with the closing, the Fund received an adjustable warrant similar to the adjustable warrant issued on August 3, 2000. The Fund also received a warrant to purchase 50,352 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $4.7664. This warrant is callable by us at any time at $7.944 per underlying share. MODEX We have sold all of our shares of Modex Therapeutics, Ltd. Our final sale of Modex shares occurred on April 30, 2001, when we realized a gain of $5,232,168 net of commissions and other fees. All other sales occurred prior to March 31, 2001. In addition, on April 30, 2001, we sold Modex our rights to future payments under the agreement between us and Neurotech S.A. for $300,000. EQUITY LINE On May 10, 2001, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Sativum Investments Limited for the potential future issuance and sale of up to $30,000,000 of our common stock, subject to restrictions and other obligations that are described throughout this prospectus. We, at our sole discretion, may draw down on this facility, sometimes termed an equity line, from time to time, and Sativum is obligated to purchase shares of our common stock at a 6% discount to a volume weighted 20 average market price over the 20 trading days following the drawdown notice. We are limited with respect to how often we can exercise a drawdown and the amount of each drawdown. In connection with the equity line, we issued a warrant to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock to Sativum and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 100,000 shares of common stock to placement agents, all at $2.38 per share. Our placement agents, Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., and Granite Financial Group, Inc., have exercised their warrants in full. We delivered a draw down notice to Sativum Investments Limited, dated as of July 11, 2001, in connection with the common stock purchase agreement dated as of May 10, 2001 evidencing an equity line facility between us and Sativum. In the draw down notice, we notified Sativum that we are exercising our right to sell up to $5,000,000 of our common stock to Sativum based on the formula in the stock purchase agreement, during the 20 trading days beginning on July 12, 2001, and ending on August 8, 2001. During the first 10 trading days, Sativum purchased a total of 425,134 shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $5.88 per share, net of Sativum's discount of six percent. Our placement agents, Pacific Crest Securities, Inc. and Granite Financial Group, Inc. received $50,000 and $25,000, respectively, as placement fees in connection with this draw down, resulting in net proceeds to us of $2,424,000 for the first 10 trading day settlement period after paying escrow fees. We have limited liquidity and capital resources and must obtain significant additional capital resources in the future in order to sustain our product development efforts. Substantial additional funds will be required to support our research and development programs, for acquisition of technologies and intellectual property rights, for preclinical and clinical testing of our anticipated products, pursuit of regulatory approvals, acquisition of capital equipment, laboratory and office facilities, establishment of production capabilities and for general and administrative expenses. Our ability to obtain additional capital will be substantially dependent on our ability to obtain partnering support for our stem cell technology. Failure to do so will have a material effect on our liquidity and capital resources. Until our operations generate significant revenues from product sales, we must rely on cash reserves and proceeds from equity and debt offerings, proceeds from the transfer or sale of our intellectual property rights, equipment, facilities or investments, government grants and funding from collaborative arrangements, if obtainable, to fund our operations. We may, but are not required to, draw down on the equity line from time to time as necessary and possible under the terms of the facility. We also intend to pursue opportunities to obtain additional financing in the future through grants and collaborative research arrangements. We are permitted under the terms of the equity line to pursue unrelated debt and equity financing other than other stand-by equity based credit facilities. The source, timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions, interest rates and, more specifically, on our progress in our exploratory, preclinical and future clinical development programs. Lack of necessary funds may require us to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of our research and product development programs or to license our potential products or technologies to third parties. Funding may not be available when needed--at all, or on terms acceptable to us. While our cash requirements may vary, as noted above, we currently expect that our existing capital resources, including income earned on invested capital, will be sufficient to fund our operations through December 2001. Our cash requirements may vary, however, depending on numerous factors. If for some reason we are not able to drawdown on the equity line, lack of necessary funds may require us to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and product development programs and/or our capital expenditures or to license our potential products or technologies to third parties. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133, \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" (SFAS 133). The statement requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair 21 value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Because we had no derivative instruments and do not currently engage in hedging activities, the adoption of Statement No. 133 on January 1, 2001 had no impact on our results of operations or financial position. 22 BUSINESS OVERVIEW We are engaged in research aimed at the development of therapies that would use stem and progenitor cells derived from fetal or adult sources to treat, and possibly cure, human diseases and injuries such as Parkinson's disease, hepatitis, diabetes, and spinal cord injuries. The body uses certain key cells known as stem cells to produce all the functional mature cell types found in normal organs of healthy individuals. Progenitor cells are cells that have already developed from the stem cells, but can still produce one or more types of mature cells within an organ. Many diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other degenerative diseases of the brain or nervous system, involve the failure of organs that cannot be transplanted. Other diseases, such as hepatitis and diabetes, involve organs such as the liver or pancreas that can be transplanted, but there is a very limited supply of those organs available for transplant. We estimate, based on information available to us from the Alzheimer's Association, the Centers for Disease Control, the Family Caregiver's Alliance and the Spinal Cord Injury Information Network, that these conditions affect more than 18 million people in the United States and account for more than $150 billion annually in health care costs. Our proposed therapies are based on the transplanting of healthy human stem and progenitor cells to repair or replace central nervous system, pancreas or liver tissue that has been damaged or lost as a result of disease or injury, potentially returning patients to productive lives and significantly reducing health care costs. We believe that we have achieved significant progress in research regarding stem cells of the central nervous system through the advances we have made in the isolation, purification and transplantation of central nervous system stem and progenitor cells. We have also made advances in our research programs to discover the stem cells of the pancreas and of the liver. We have established an intellectual property position in all three areas of our stem cell research--the central nervous system, the pancreas and the liver--by patenting our discoveries and entering into exclusive licensing arrangements. We believe that, if successfully developed, our platform of stem cell technologies may create the basis for therapies that would address a number of conditions with significant unmet medical needs. We were formerly known as CytoTherapeutics, Inc. Until mid-1990 we had programs in a different technology, encapsulated cell therapy, as well as stem cell programs. We now focus exclusively on the discovery, development and commercialization of our proprietary platform of stem cell technologies. Effective May 2000 we changed our name to StemCells, Inc. CELL THERAPY BACKGROUND ROLE OF CELLS IN HUMAN HEALTH AND TRADITIONAL THERAPIES Cells maintain normal physiological function in healthy individuals by secreting or metabolizing substances that are essential to life. When cells are damaged or destroyed, they no longer produce, metabolize or accurately regulate these substances. Impaired cellular function is associated with the progressive decline common to many degenerative diseases of the nervous system, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recent advances in medical science have identified cell loss or impaired cellular function as leading causes of degenerative diseases. Biotechnology advances have led to the identification of some of the specific substances or proteins that are deficient. While administering these substances or proteins as medication does overcome some of the limitations of traditional pharmaceuticals, such as lack of specificity, there is no existing technology that can deliver them to the precise sites of action and in the appropriate physiological quantities or for the duration required to cure the degenerative condition. Cells, however, do this naturally. As a result, investigators have considered replacing failing cells that are no longer producing 23 the needed substances or proteins by implanting stem or progenitor cells capable of regenerating the cell that the degenerative condition has damaged or destroyed. Where there has been irreversible tissue damage or organ failure, transplantation of stem cells offers the possibility of generating new and healthy tissue, thus potentially restoring the organ function and the patient's health. THE POTENTIAL OF OUR STEM CELL-BASED THERAPY We believe that, if successfully developed, stem cell-based therapy--the use of stem or progenitor cells to treat diseases--has the potential to provide a broad therapeutic approach comparable in importance to traditional pharmaceuticals and genetically engineered biologics. Stem cells are rare and only available in limited supply, whether from the patients themselves or from donors. Cells obtained from the same person who will receive them may be abnormal if the patient is ill or the tissue is contaminated with disease-causing cells. Also, obtaining the cells often requires significant surgical procedures. The challenge, therefore, has been three-fold: - to identify the stem cells; - to create techniques and processes that we can use to expand these rare cells in sufficient quantities for effective transplants; and - to establish a bank of normal human stem or progenitor cells that we can use for transplantation into individuals whose own cells are not suitable because of disease or other reasons. We have developed and demonstrated a process, based on a proprietary IN VITRO culture system in chemically defined media, that reproducibly grows normal human central nervous system, or CNS, stem and progenitor cells. We believe this is the first reproducible process for growing normal human CNS stem cells. More recently, we have discovered markers on the cell surface that identify the human CNS stem cells. This allows us to purify them and eliminate other unwanted cell types. Together, these discoveries enable us to select normal human CNS stem cells and to expand them in culture to produce a large number of pure stem cells. Because these cells have not been genetically modified, they may be especially suitable for transplantation and may provide a safer and more effective alternative to therapies that are based on cells derived from cancer cells, cells modified by a cancer gene, an unpurified mixture of many different cell types, or animal derived cells. We believe our proprietary stem cell technologies may enable therapies to replace specific cells that have been damaged or destroyed, permitting the restoration of function through the replacement of normal cells where this has not been possible in the past. In our research, we have shown that hosts accept CNS stem cells that are transplanted into them, and that the cells continue to migrate and specialize to produce mature neurons and glial cells. More generally, because the stem cell is the pivotal cell that produces all the functional mature cell types in an organ, we believe these cells, if successfully identified and developed for transplantation, may serve as platforms for five major areas of regenerative medicine and biotechnology: - tissue repair and replacement, - correction of genetic disorders, - drug discovery and screening, - gene discovery and use, and - diagnostics. We will be pursuing alliances in these key areas. 24 OUR PLATFORM OF STEM CELL TECHNOLOGIES Stem cells have two defining characteristics: - some of the cells developed from stem cells produce all the kinds of mature cells making up the particular organ; and - they \"self renew\"--that is, other cells developed from stem cells are themselves new stem cells, thus permitting the process to continue again and again. Stem cells exist for many systems of the human body: the blood and immune system; the central and peripheral nervous systems (including the brain); and the liver, pancreas endocrine, and skin systems. These cells are responsible for organ regeneration during normal cell replacement and, to a limited extent, after injury. We believe that further research and development will allow stem cells to be cultivated and administered in ways that enhance their natural function, so as to form the basis of therapies that will replace specific subsets of cells that disease, injury or genetic defect has damaged or destroyed. We also believe that the person or entity that first identifies and isolates a stem cell and defines methods to culture any of the finite number of different types of human stem cells will be able to obtain patent protection for the methods and the composition, making the commercial development of stem cell treatment and possible cure of currently intractable diseases financially feasible. Our strategy is to be the first to identify, isolate and patent multiple types of human stem and progenitor cells with commercial importance. Our portfolio of issued patents includes a method of culturing normal human central nervous system stem and progenitor cells in our proprietary chemically defined medium. Our published studies show that these cultured and expanded cells give rise to all three major cell types of the central nervous system. Also, a separate study that we sponsored that used these cultured stem and progenitor cells showed that the cells are accepted, migrate, and successfully specialize to produce neurons and glial cells. More recently, we announced the results of a new study that showed that markers present on the surface of freshly obtained brain cells can successfully isolate human central nervous system stem cells. We believe this is the first reproducible process for isolating highly purified populations of well-characterized normal human central nervous system stem cells, and have applied for a composition of matter patent. Because the cells are highly purified and have not been genetically modified, they may be especially suitable for transplantation and may provide a safer and more effective alternative to therapies that are based on cells derived from cancer cells, cells modified by a cancer gene, an unpurified mixture of cell types, or animal-derived cells. We have also filed an improved process patent for the growth and expansion of these purified normal human central nervous system cells. Neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and the side effects of stroke, affect a significant portion of the U.S. population and there currently are no effective long-term therapies for them. We believe that therapies based on our process for identifying, isolating and culturing neural stem and progenitor cells may be useful in treating such diseases. We are continuing to research and develop human central nervous system stem and progenitor cell-based therapies for these diseases. We continue to research the islet stem cell in the human pancreas and the liver stem cell. Islet cells are the cells that produce insulin, so islet stem cells may be useful in the treatment of Type 1 diabetes and those cases of Type 2 diabetes where insulin secretion is defective. Liver stem cells may be useful in the treatment of diseases such as hepatitis, cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. 25 EXPECTED ADVANTAGES OF OUR STEM CELL TECHNOLOGY NO OTHER TREATMENT To the best of our knowledge, no one has developed an FDA-approved method for replacing lost or damaged tissues from the human nervous system. Replacement of tissues in other areas of the human body is limited to those few sites, such as bone marrow or peripheral blood cell transplants, where transplantation of the patient's own cells is now feasible. In a few additional areas, including the liver, transplantation of donor organs is now used, but is limited by the scarcity of organs available through donation. We believe that our stem cell technologies have the potential to reestablish function in at least some of the patients who have suffered loss of nervous system tissue. REPLACED CELLS PROVIDE NORMAL FUNCTION Because stem cells can duplicate themselves, or self-renew, and specialize into the multiple kinds of cells that are commonly lost in various diseases, transplanted stem cells may be able to migrate limited distances to the proper location within the body, to expand and specialize and to replace damaged or defective cells, facilitating the return to proper function. We believe that such replacement of damaged or defective cells by functional cells is unlikely to be achieved with any other treatment. RESEARCH EFFORTS AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY We have devoted substantial resources to research the isolation and development of a series of stem and progenitor cells that would serve as a basis for replacing diseased or injured cells. Our efforts to date have been directed at methods to identify, isolate and culture large varieties of stem and progenitor cells of the human nervous system, liver and pancreas and to develop therapies utilizing these stem and progenitor cells. The following table lists the potential therapeutic indications for, and current status of, our primary research and product development programs. The table is qualified in its entirety by reference to the more detailed descriptions of such programs appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. We continually evaluate our research and product development and reallocate resources in light of experimental results, commercial potential, availability of third party funding, likelihood of near-term efficacy, collaboration success or significant technology enhancement, or other relevant factors. Our research and product development programs are in early stages of development and will require substantial resources to commercialize. 26 RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\n\nPROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE STAGE/STATUS(1) - ------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------- HUMAN NEURAL STEM CELL PRECLINICAL Repair or replace damaged central nervous - Demonstrated IN VITRO the ability to system tissue (including spinal cord, initiate and expand stem cell-containing degenerated retinas and tissue affected by human neural cultures and specialization certain genetic disorders) into three types of central nervous system cells - Demonstrated the ability of neurosphere- initiating stem cells from human brain - Demonstrated in rodent studies that transplanted human brain-derived stem cells are accepted and properly specialized into the three major cell types of the central nervous system PANCREAS ISLET STEM CELL RESEARCH Repair or replace damaged pancreas islet - Identified markers on the surface of cells tissue to isolate and culture islet stem cells of the pancreas - Commenced small animal testing LIVER STEM CELL RESEARCH Repair or replace damaged liver tissue - Demonstrated the production of hepatocytes including tissue resulting from certain from purified mouse hematopoietic stem metabolic genetic diseases cells - Identified IN VITRO culture assay for growth of human bipotent liver progenitor cells that can produce both bile duct and hepatocytes - Showed that the IN VITRO culture of human bipotent liver cells can also grow human hepatitis virus\n\n- ------------------------ (1) \"Research\" refers to early stage research and product development activities IN VITRO, including the selection and characterization of product candidates for preclinical testing. \"Preclinical\" refers to further testing of a defined product candidate IN VITRO and in animals prior to clinical studies. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS Currently, our portfolio of stem cell technology results from our exclusive licensing of central nervous system, stem and progenitor cell technology, animal models for the identification and/or testing of stem and progenitor cells and our own research and development efforts. We believe that therapies using stem cells represent a fundamentally new approach to the treatment of diseases caused by lost or damaged tissue. We assembled an experienced team of scientists and scientific advisors to consult with and advise our scientists on their continuing research and development of stem and progenitor cells. This team includes, among others, Irving L. Weissman, M.D., of Stanford University, Fred H. Gage, Ph.D., of The Salk Institute and David Anderson, Ph.D., of the California Institute of Technology. BRAIN STEM AND PROGENITOR CELL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM We began our work with central nervous system stem and progenitor cell cultures in collaboration with NeuroSpheres, Ltd., in 1992. We believe NeuroSpheres first invented these cultures. Further, NeuroSpheres granted us exclusive, worldwide licenses, encompassing all uses, to numerous inventions 27 and associated patents and patent applications. These inventions and associated patents and patent applications are subsequently noted in the section entitled \"License Agreements and Sponsored Research Agreements--NeuroSpheres, Ltd.\" In 1997, our scientists invented a reproducible method for growing human central nervous system, stem and progenitor cells in cultures. In preclinical IN VITRO and early IN VIVO studies, we demonstrated that these cells specialize into all three of the cell types of the central nervous system, or CNS. Because of these results, we believe that these cells may form the basis for replacement of cells lost in certain degenerative diseases. We are continuing research into, and have initiated the development of, our human CNS stem and progenitor cell cultures. We have initiated the cultures and demonstrated that these cultures can be expanded for a number of generations IN VITRO in chemically defined media. In collaboration with us, Dr. Anders Bjorklund has shown that cells from these cultures can be successfully transplanted and accepted into the brains of rodents where they subsequently migrated and specialized into the appropriate cell types for the site of the brain into which they were placed. In 1998, we expanded our preclinical efforts in this area by initiating programs aimed at the discovery and use of specific monoclonal antibodies to facilitate identification and isolation of CNS and other stem and progenitor cells or their specialized progeny. Also in 1998, our researchers devised methods to advance the IN VITRO culture and passage of human CNS stem cells that resulted in a 100-fold increase in CNS stem and progenitor cell production after 6 passages. The US Patent and Trademark Office has since allowed a patent on those methods. We are expanding our preclinical efforts toward the goal of selecting the proper indications to pursue. In December 1998, we announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had granted patent No. 5,851,832. This patent covered our methods for the human CNS cell cultures containing central nervous system stem cells, for compositions of human CNS cells expanded by these methods, and for use of these cultures in human transplantation. These human CNS stem and progenitor cells expanded in culture may be useful for repairing or replacing damaged central nervous system tissue, including the brain and the spinal cord. In October 1999, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted patent number 5,968,829 entitled \"Human CNS Neural Stem Cells,\" covering our composition of matter patent for human CNS stem cells and also allowed a separate patent application for our media for culturing human CNS stem cells. Also in 1999, we announced the filing of a U.S. patent application covering our proprietary process for the direct isolation of normal human CNS stem cells based on the markers found to be present on the surface of freshly obtained brain cells. Since the filing of this patent application, our researchers have completed a study designed to identify, isolate and culture human CNS stem cells using this proprietary process. In November 1999, we announced the study's first results: Our researchers, by using our proprietary markers on the surface of the cell, had succeeded in identifying, isolating and purifying human CNS stem cells from brain tissue, and were able to expand the number of these cells in culture. We believe that this is the first study to show a reproducible process for isolating highly purified populations of well-characterized normal human CNS stem cells. The unmodified cells are normal human CNS stem cells and, therefore, may be especially suitable for transplantation. In addition, the cells may provide a safer and more effective alternative to therapies based on cells derived from cancer cells or from an unpurified mix of many different cell types, or from animal derived cells. In January 2000, we reported what we regard as an even more important result: In long term animal studies, our researchers took purified and expanded stem cells and transplanted them into the normal brains of immunodeficient mouse hosts, where they took hold and grew into neurons and glial cells. 28 Throughout the study, the transplanted human CNS stem cells survived for as long as one year and migrated to specific functional domains of the host brain, with no sign of tumor formation or adverse effects on the animal recipients; moreover, the cells were still dividing. These findings show that when CNS stem cells isolated and cultured with our proprietary processes are transplanted, they adopt the characteristics of the host brain and act like normal stem cells. In other words, the study suggests the possibility of a continual replenishment of normal human brain cells. As noted above, human CNS stem and progenitor cells harvested and purified and expanded using our proprietary processes may be useful for creating therapies for the treatment of degenerative brain diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer's disease. These conditions affect more than 5 million people in the United States and there are no effecti"
