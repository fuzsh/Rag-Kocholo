Business\n\nOverview\n\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and developing novel, small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of serious diseases with unmet medical needs and a commercial focus on the U.S. market. Our current strategy is to focus our development activities on MN-166 (ibudilast) for neurological disorders such as progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and substance dependence (e.g., methamphetamine dependence, opioid dependence, and alcohol dependence), and MN-001 (tipelukast) for fibrotic diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Our pipeline also includes MN-221 (bedoradrine) for the treatment of acute exacerbation of asthma and MN-029 (denibulin) for solid tumor cancers.\n\nMN-166 (ibudilast) is currently in development for several different neurological disorders. We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of MN-166 for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2008, in which positive safety and neuroprotective efficacy indicators were observed. We have successfully partnered with investigators on an ongoing Phase 2b clinical trial of MN-166 in primary progressive and secondary progressive MS which is\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents\n\nconducted by NeuroNEXT and funded by the NIHs National Institute on Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS). In August 2014, we announced plans to initiate a clinical trial of MN-166 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and this trial is currently ongoing. In February 2015, we announced that the ALS study had enrolled 30 of the 60 subjects planned for participation. In the area of addiction, investigators at UCLA completed a Phase 1b clinical trial of MN-166 in methamphetamine (MA)-dependent volunteers, funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the results were presented at the Annual Meeting of the College on Problems of Drug Dependence (CPDD) in June 2013. In September 2012 we announced approval and funding by NIDA of a Phase 2 clinical trial studying the use of MN-166 for the treatment of MA addiction. In collaboration with UCLA, this clinical trial commenced in 2013 and is currently ongoing. In 2010, investigators at Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) completed a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of MN-166 in opioid withdrawal that was funded by NIDA. Investigators at Columbia University and the NYSPI are currently conducting a NIDA-funded, Phase 2a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of MN-166 in the treatment of patients addicted to prescription opioids or heroin. Positive interim data from this study was reported in August 2014. In August 2013, we announced that researchers at UCLA were granted approval and funding by National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) of a clinical trial studying the use of MN-166 for the treatment of alcohol dependence, and the study is currently ongoing.\n\nMN-001 (tipelukast) is currently in development for fibrotic diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In 2014, we announced positive results of MN-001 in two different NASH mouse models and began preparing for clinical development of MN-001 for the treatment of NASH in the U.S. In January 2015, we announced that the IND (Investigation New Drug) application for MN-001 for the treatment of NASH is open with the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) and the FDA agreed that we may proceed with a Phase 2 study. In June 2014, we announced positive results of MN-001 in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis and have begun preparations to pursue clinical development of MN-001 in IPF. In October 2014, we announced that the FDA granted Orphan-Drug designation to MN-001 for treatment of IPF, which will provide seven years of marketing exclusivity if MN-001 is approved for IPF. In February 2015, we announced that FDA has approved the protocol for a clinical trial of MN-001 (tipelukast) for the treatment of moderate to severe IPF. Importantly, due to safety data from previous clinical studies of MN-001, FDA has agreed that MediciNova may proceed with a Phase 2 study as the first clinical trial of MN-001 in IPF.\n\nWe completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of MN-221 for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma treated in the emergency room and conducted an End-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2012. We plan to conduct further MN-221 development according to the feedback received from the FDA following the EOP2 meeting. In that meeting, the FDA identified the risk/benefit profile of MN-221 as a focal point for further development and advised that a clinical outcome, such as a reduction in hospitalizations, would need to be a pivotal trial primary endpoint. Previously completed Phase 2 studies have evaluated the potential for MN-221 to reduce hospitalizations due to acute exacerbations of asthma. We believe the appropriate clinical development for MN-221 will involve conducting dose regimen and acute exacerbations of asthma trial design optimization studies prior to commencing pivotal trials. Currently, we are working to identify a partner for financial support before further clinical development is commenced.\n\nWe have acquired licenses to MN-166, MN-001, MN-221, and MN-029 for the development of these product candidates. We have pursued development of these product candidates in various indications including progressive MS, ALS, various addictions, NASH, IPF, acute exacerbations of asthma, and solid tumor cancers. We have returned two compounds, MN-246 and MN-305, to their respective Licensors, and we are pursuing our option to return two additional compounds, MN-462 and MN-447, in order to maximize our ability to pursue development of MN-166, MN-001, MN-221, and MN-029.\n\n2\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur Strategy\n\nOur goal is to build a sustainable biopharmaceutical business through the successful development of differentiated products for the treatment of serious diseases with unmet medical needs in high-value therapeutic areas. Key elements of our strategy are as follows:\n\n Pursue the development of MN-166 for multiple potential indications primarily through non-dilutive financings.\n\nWe intend to advance our diverse MN-166 (ibudilast) program through a combination of investigator-sponsored trials and trials funded through government grants or other grants. In addition to providing drug supply and regulatory support, we are funding portions of the consortium-sponsored trials. For example, we have contributed financially to the Secondary and Primary Progressive Ibudilast NeuroNEXT Trial in Multiple Sclerosis (SPRINT-MS) Phase 2 clinical trial of MN-166 for the treatment of progressive MS, which is primarily funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and are contributing financially to the Carolinas Neuromuscular ALS-MDA Center clinical trial of MN-166 for the treatment of ALS. We intend to enter into additional strategic alliances to support further clinical development of MN-166.\n\n Pursue the development of MN-001 for fibrotic diseases such as NASH and IPF.\n\nWe intend to advance development of MN-001 through a combination of investigator-sponsored trials with or without grant funding as well as trials we may fund.\n\n Strategically partner with one or more leading pharmaceutical companies to complete late-stage product development and successfully commercialize our products.\n\nWe develop and maintain relationships with pharmaceutical companies that are therapeutic category leaders. Upon completion of proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trials, we intend to enter into strategic alliances with leading pharmaceutical companies who seek late-stage product candidates, such as MN-166, MN-221, MN-001 and MN-029, to support further clinical development and product commercialization.\n\nOur Product Candidates and Programs\n\nOur product development programs address diseases that we believe are not well served by currently available therapies and represent significant commercial opportunities. We believe that we have product candidates that offer innovative therapeutic approaches that may provide significant advantages relative to current therapies.\n\nOur product acquisitions have focused primarily on product candidates with significant preclinical and early clinical testing data that have been developed by the licensors outside of the U.S. We utilize the existing data in preparing Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) or their foreign equivalents, and in designing and implementing additional preclinical or clinical trials to advance the regulatory approval process in the U.S. or abroad.\n\nFollowing are the details of our product development programs:\n\nMN-166 (Ibudilast)\n\nIbudilast (MN-166) is a novel, first-in-class, oral, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agent. Ibudilast inhibits macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and certain phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Ibudilast also attenuates activated glia cells, which play a major role in certain neurological conditions. While it has been in use for more than 20 years in Japan and Korea for the treatment of asthma and post-stroke dizziness, we are developing ibudilast for the treatment of primary progressive and secondary progressive MS, ALS, and drug dependence. We licensed MN-166 from Kyorin Pharmaceuticals (Kyorin) in 2004.\n\n3\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe have filed patent applications for multiple uses of ibudilast for the treatment of neurological conditions, as well as patent applications on analogs that have the potential to be second generation molecules. Some of the patent estate has received allowance in the U.S. and foreign countries.\n\nPrimary and Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: MS is a complex disease with predominantly unknown etiology and affects approximately 2.3 million people worldwide, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. There are no therapies generally considered safe and efficacious in primary progressive MS (PPMS) or secondary progressive MS (SPMS) in the absence of relapses. There is a great need for a safe, effective, and conveniently administered therapy for patients with PPMS and SPMS. Ibudilast (MN-166) may meet these needs. Based on promising results from a Phase 2a trial in Central and Eastern Europe completed in 2008, investigators from NeuroNEXT, a NIH-funded Phase 2 clinical trial network, have begun to evaluate ibudilast in PPMS and SPMS patients in the U.S. SPRINT-MS is a Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of ibudilast (up to 100 mg/day) over two years in PPMS and SPMS patients. Recruitment and enrollment of a planned 250 patients at 28 medical centers in the U.S. commenced in late 2013 and the trial is expected to be completed in 2017.\n\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): ALS, also known as Lou Gehrigs disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. The nerves lose the ability to trigger specific muscles, which causes the muscles to become weak. As a result, ALS affects voluntary movement and patients in the later stages of the disease may become totally paralyzed. Life expectancy of an ALS patient is usually 2-5 years. According to the ALS Association, there are approximately 30,000 ALS patients in the U.S. and approximately 5,600 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with ALS each year. Riluzole is the only pharmaceutical treatment approved for ALS, but it has limited efficacy. We are working with Carolinas Neuromuscular/ALS-MDA Center at Carolinas HealthCare System Neurosciences Institute, which is conducting an ongoing clinical trial of ibudilast in ALS. The trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study which includes a six-month treatment period followed by a six-month open-label extension. The study will evaluate several efficacy endpoints in addition to monitoring the safety and tolerability of MN-166 60 mg/day versus placebo when administered in combination with riluzole in 60 subjects with ALS. Subject enrollment began in October 2014. In February 2015, we announced that the ALS study had enrolled 30 of the 60 subjects planned for participation.\n\nMethamphetamine addiction: Methamphetamine (MA) is a central nervous system stimulant drug that is similar in structure to amphetamine. It is a Schedule II drug, meaning that it has high abuse potential and low therapeutic potential. According to the SAMHSA 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, there are approximately 595,000 current MA abusers age 12 and older in the U.S. According to the Rand Corporation, the national estimate of the economic burden of MA use, based on the most recent year for which data are available, is approximately $23.4 billion. Currently, there is no treatment for MA dependence. Based on non-clinical results with ibudilasts effects in an animal model of MA relapse, investigators at UCLA conducted a Phase 1b trial funded by NIDA to examine the safety and preliminary efficacy of ibudilast in non-treatment-seeking, MA-dependent users in an inpatient trial that was completed in 2012. Subsequently, UCLA investigators received NIDA grant funding for an ongoing Phase 2 trial that commenced in 2013 for evaluation of ibudilast in MA-dependent users in an outpatient trial setting.\n\nWe were granted Fast Track designation from the FDA for ibudilast for the treatment of MA dependence in February 2013. Fast track designation is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended to treat serious diseases and have the potential to fill an unmet medical need. An important feature of the FDAs Fast Track program is that it emphasizes early and frequent communication between the FDA and the sponsor throughout the entire drug development and review process to improve the efficiency of product development. Accordingly, Fast Track status can potentially lead to a shortened timeline to ultimate drug approval.\n\nOpioid withdrawal and dependency: According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrations (SAMHSA) 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, there are approximately 1.9 million\n\n4\n\nTable of Contents\n\npeople age 12 and above with nonmedical pain reliever dependence or abuse and approximately 517,000 people age 12 and above with heroin dependence or abuse in the U.S. Access to prescription opioids has recently become more difficult due to more stringent policies on prescribing opioids. An unintended consequence of this policy is increased use of heroin. Heroin is attractive to prescription opioid addicts because it is cheaper and more accessible than prescription opioids. Heroin poses serious health issues, such as risk of HIV and Hepatitis C infection, overdose and death (Knopf, 2012). The economic costs of nonmedical use of prescription opioids in the U.S. in 2006 (Hansen et al., 2011) was estimated to total more than $50 billion annually; lost productivity and crime accounted for 94% of the total economic burden. There is an urgent, significant unmet medical need for a safe, effective non-addictive, non-opioid therapy for the treatment of prescription opioid and heroin addiction. In 2010, investigators at Columbia University and NYSPI completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled in-unit Phase 1b/2a clinical trial to evaluate the ability of ibudilast to reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms in humans. The trial was funded by NIDA. Subsequently, investigators at Columbia/NYSPI commenced a NINDA-funded Phase 2a clinical trial of ibudilast for the treatment of prescription opioid dependency. In August 2014, MediciNova announced positive interim results of this ongoing study.\n\nAlcohol addiction: According to SAMHSAs 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, there are approximately 17.3 million people with alcohol dependence or abuse aged 12 and older in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that alcohol abuse costs the U.S. $224 billion annually, based on information collected from several national studies reporting on the costs of alcohol overuse in 2006, the latest year for which complete data are available. Currently, medicines approved by the FDA to treat alcohol dependence include Antabuse®, Vivitrol®, and Campral®. However, the search for a safe and effective drug remains elusive due to limited success of these FDA-approved compounds (Witkiewitz et al., 2012). In a non-clinical trial (Bell et al., 2013), ibudilast was examined in rats and mice and was found to reduce alcohol drinking in alcohol-preferring P rats and high-alcohol drinking (HAD1) rats by 50%, and in mice made dependent on alcohol at doses which had no effect on non-dependent mice. Concurrently, investigators at UCLA received funding from the NIAAA to initiate a Phase 2a study to evaluate ibudilast in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subject crossover design to determine the safety, tolerability and initial human laboratory efficacy of ibudilast in a sample of 24 non-treatment seeking individuals with either alcohol abuse or dependence. Participants will be treated with ibudilast and placebo. The study was initiated in early 2014 and is ongoing.\n\nMN-221 (Bedoradrine)\n\nMN-221 is a novel, highly selective ß2-adrenergic receptor agonist being developed for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma. We licensed MN-221 from Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Kissei) in February 2004. Current inhaled beta-agonist treatments for asthma exacerbations are limited by bronchoconstriction or insufficient airflow due to inflammation and airway constriction, which reduces the amount of inhaled drug that can get into the lungs. In addition, the amount of inhaled treatments a patient can tolerate is limited due to the potential for cardiovascular side effects (e.g. increased heart rate).\n\nMN-221 is designed to treat acute exacerbations of asthma via intravenous (i.v.) infusion, bypassing constricted airways to deliver the drug directly to the lungs. Preclinical studies showed MN-221 to have a high affinity for the ß2-adrenergic receptor, found primarily in the lungs, and a much lower affinity for the ß1-adrenergic receptor found primarily in cardiac tissue. MN-221s improved delivery to the lungs and its cardiac safety profile may help fill an unmet need for patients with acute exacerbations of asthma, helping them to breathe easier and avoid a costly hospital stay.\n\nAcute Exacerbation of Asthma: According to the most recent data available from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, there were 1.75 million emergency department visits, 439,000 hospitalizations, and 3,404 deaths due to asthma in 2010. According to the U.S. National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, the direct costs associated with hospital care due to asthma were estimated at $5.5 billion in the U.S. in 2010. Nearly 10% of hospitalized patients have life-threatening asthma that requires admission to the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n5\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe completed a Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (N=175) evaluating MN-221 in patients with acute exacerbations of asthma in the emergency department setting. MN-221 did not statistically meet the primary endpoint, improvement in FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second) compared to placebo. However, MN-221 showed a significant benefit over placebo for FEV1 (liters) Area Under the Curve (AUCHr 0-1,0-2,0-3) of change from baseline (p=0.043, p=0.050, p=0.066 respectively). The trial also demonstrated a reduction in hospital admissions with MN-221 added to standard drug treatments. Moreover, there was a significant improvement in clinical symptoms with MN-221-treated patients, and the safety profile of MN-221 continues to be positive as no safety/tolerability issues of clinical significance were observed.\n\nIn October 2012 we met with the FDA to review future development of this product candidate. The FDA identified the risk/benefit profile of MN-221 as a focal point for further development and advised that a clinical outcome, such as a reduction in hospitalizations, would need to be a pivotal trial primary endpoint. We have decided that future MN-221 development will be designed based on the feedback received from the FDA and that any future MN-221 clinical trial development for asthma will be partner-dependent from a funding perspective.\n\nMN-001 (Tipelukast)\n\nMN-001 (tipelukast) is a novel, orally bioavailable small molecule compound which exerts its effects through several mechanisms to produce its anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory activity in preclinical models, including leukotriene (LT) receptor antagonism, inhibition of PDEs (mainly 3 and 4), and inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). The 5-LO/LT pathway has been postulated as a pathogenic factor in fibrosis development and MN-001s inhibitory effect on 5-LO and the 5-LO/LT pathway is considered to be a novel approach to treat fibrosis. MN-001 has been shown to down-regulate expression of genes that promote fibrosis including LOXL2, Collagen Type 1 and TIMP-1. MN-001 has also been shown to down-regulate expression of genes that promote inflammation including CCR2 and MCP-1. In addition, histopathological data shows that MN-001 reduces fibrosis in multiple animal models. We licensed MN-001 from Kyorin in 2002.\n\nPreviously, we evaluated MN-001 for its potential clinical efficacy in asthma and completed a Phase 2 study in asthma with positive results. This compound has been exposed to more than 600 subjects. MN-001 was considered generally safe and well-tolerated.\n\nWe completed a pre-clinical study evaluating MN-001s potential clinical efficacy for the treatment of NASH. MN-001 administered orally once daily (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg for three weeks) was evaluated in the STAM (NASH-HCC) mouse model of NASH, as measured by liver biochemistry and histopathology, NAFLD activity score (NAS), and percent of fibrosis and gene expression. MN-001, in a dose-dependent manner, significantly reduced fibrosis area compared with placebo (p<0.01) as demonstrated by a reduction in liver hydroxyproline content, supporting MN-001s anti-fibrotic properties. MN-001 significantly improved NAS (p<0.01). MN-001, in this animal model, improved NASH pathology by inhibiting hepatocyte damage (p<0.01) and ballooning (p<0.01). At the same time, MN-001 was also shown to reduce certain gene expression levels in the liver, thus implying that MN-001 prevents the formation of fibrosis in the NASH model. We completed a second preclinical study that examined the potential clinical efficacy of MN-001 for the treatment of advanced NASH. This study used mice in more advanced stages of NASH as compared to the first study of MN-001 in a NASH mouse model. MN-001 showed anti-NASH and anti-fibrotic effects in the advanced NASH mouse model. NAFLD activity score was significantly reduced in the MN-001 treated group compared to the non-treated group (p<0.001). The reduction was observed consistently in all NAS components including hepatocyte ballooning score (p<0.001), lobular inflammation score (p<0.01), and steatosis score (p<0.05). Percent fibrosis area was also reduced in the MN-001 treated group (p<0.01). In addition, alpha-SMA-positive staining area was significantly reduced in the MN-001 treated group (p<0.001). Collectively, these results provide compelling evidence that MN-001 warrants further evaluation for the treatment of NASH in humans. We have an open IND with the FDA and have FDA approval to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of MN-001 for the treatment of NASH in the U.S.\n\n6\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe completed a pre-clinical study evaluating MN-001s potential clinical efficacy for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. MN-001, which was administered orally once daily (30, 100 and 300 mg/kg) for 2 weeks, was evaluated in a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (PF) as measured by CT evaluation of lung density, degree of pulmonary fibrosis using the Ashcroft score based on histopathological staining, and hydroxyproline content, which is an indicator of fibrosis or storage of collagen in tissue. MN-001 significantly decreased (p<0.05) the Ashcroft score compared to Vehicle group after 2 weeks of treatment and MN-001 reduced lung density when compared to the Vehicle-treated group. Moreover, lung hydroxyproline content was significantly reduced compared to the Vehicle group (p<0.01). These results show that treatment with MN-001 has significant anti-fibrogenic effects in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. In October 2014, the FDA granted orphan-drug designation to MN-001 (tipelukast) for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Orphan-drug designation will provide MediciNova with seven years of marketing exclusivity for MN-001 (tipelukast) for the treatment of IPF if it is approved for this indication. We have an open IND with FDA and have FDA approval to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of MN-001 for the treatment of IPF in the U.S.\n\nMN-029 (Denibulin)\n\nMN-029 (denibulin) is a novel tubulin binding agent (TBA) under development for the treatment of solid tumors. It reverses inhibition of tubulin polymerization resulting in disruption of the cell cytoskeleton, thus causing the cancer cells to deform in shape and ultimately leading to extensive central necrosis of the solid tumor. We licensed MN-029 from Angiogene Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (Angiogene) in 2002.\n\nSeveral preclinical pharmacology studies have assessed the mechanism of action and anti-tumor activity of MN-029 in vivo in rodent models of breast adenocarcinoma, colon carcinoma, lung carcinoma and KHT sarcoma. In these studies, MN-029 damaged poorly formed tumor blood vessels by weakening tumor blood vessel walls and causing leakage, clotting and eventual vascular shutdown within the tumor, in addition to the direct effect over tumor cells. These studies suggest that MN-029 acts quickly and is rapidly cleared from the body, which may reduce the potential for some adverse effects commonly associated with chemotherapy. Shutdown of tumor blood flow in tumor models was confirmed through the use of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. In two Phase I clinical studies we conducted, MN-029 was well-tolerated at doses that reduced tumor blood flow.\n\nThe first Phase 1 trial determined the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) level of single doses of MN-029 given every three weeks in 34 subjects with refractory cancer. The MTD was determined to be 180 mg/m2 and appeared to be safe as a single i.v. dose administered every three weeks for as many as 25 cycles. There were no clinically significant changes in routine laboratory assessments, vital signs, or ECG monitoring. The most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) were similar to others chemotherapiesvomiting, nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue. There were a total of nine serious adverse events (SAEs) and study discontinuations due to AEs. In a preliminary evaluation of anti-tumor activity, no patient had a complete response or partial response; however stable disease was seen in 12 patients. MN-029 had a desired vascular effect in seven of 11 patients that were administered drug at dose levels of ³120 mg/m2. Nine patients continued into extended cycles of treatment.\n\nThe second Phase 1 study was conducted to determine the safety, tolerability and MTD of single doses of MN-029 given every seven days for a total of three doses (Days 1, 8 and 15), followed by 13-day recovery (Days 16-28) in subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumor cancer. Subjects who tolerated treatment with MN-029 could receive additional cycles. All 20 subjects reported at least one AE related to study drug. The most common AEs considered related to study drug were vomiting, nausea, arthralgia and headache. There were no clinically significant changes in routine laboratory assessments, vital signs or ECG monitoring. There was one SAE considered unrelated to study drug. Consistent with the previous Phase 1 trial, MN-029 up to dose levels of 180 mg/m2 appeared to be safe and well tolerated. One subject had a partial response which lasted for 74 days. Stable disease was observed in seven subjects. The results suggested an effect of MN-029 on vascular perfusion; however, a larger sample size is warranted.\n\n7\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIn January 2014, we were granted a new patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office which covers MN-029 (denibulin) di-hydrochloride. The patent, which will expire no earlier than July 2032, has claims that cover a compound, pharmaceutical composition and method of treating certain cell proliferation diseases, including solid tumors, based on denibulin di-hydrochloride. We plan to pursue further development of MN-029 for the treatment of solid tumors.\n\n8\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTable 1 Product Candidates and ProgramsIbudilast (MN-166)\n\nIndication\n\nClinical Study\n\nPrincipal Investigator /Institution\n\n/Funding Agency(s)\n\nStatus\n\nPrimary Progressive and Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis\n\nA Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Activity of Ibudilast (MN-166) in Subjects with Progressive Multiple Sclerosis\n\nRobert J.

We expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of the API and finished products for our clinical and any future commercial production requirements. We believe that there are several manufacturing sources available at commercially reasonable terms to meet our clinical requirements and any future commercial production requirements for the API of our products and the finished drug products.\n\nFor the MN-166 (ibudilast) development program, we have sourced and imported delayed-release ibudilast capsules, marketed in Japan as Pinatos®, from Taisho-Teva Pharmaceuticals (Taisho).\n\nPursuant to the terms of our license agreement with Kissei for MN-221, Kissei has the exclusive right to manufacture the commercial supply of the API for MN-221. If we enter into a supply agreement with Kissei, we will purchase from Kissei all API that we require for the commercial supply of MN-221, if such product candidate is approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.\n\nIntellectual Property and License Agreements\n\nSince our inception in September 2000, we have entered into eight license agreements with pharmaceutical companies which cover our current product candidates. We have also entered into license agreements with universities, including the University of Colorado and the University of Adelaide, which cover additional intellectual property related to our product candidates. In general, we seek to procure patent protection for our anticipated products, or obtain such protection from the relevant patents owned by our licensors. We have obtained licensed rights under three issued and active U.S. patents. We also have obtained licensed rights to 53 issued and pending foreign patents and applications corresponding to these U.S. patents and patent applications. In addition to these licensed rights, we hold 18 issued U.S. patents and have filed 32 additional U.S. patent applications. We also hold 54 issued and pending foreign patents and applications corresponding to these U.S. patents and patent applications. We are not aware of any third-party infringement of the patents owned or licensed by us and are not party to any material claims by third parties of infringement by us of such third parties intellectual property rights. The following is a description of our existing license agreements and intellectual property rights for each of our product candidates.\n\nMN-166\n\nOn October 22, 2004, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kyorin for the development and commercialization of MN-166. Kyorin is a fully integrated Japanese pharmaceutical company and is listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. We obtained an exclusive, worldwide (excluding Japan, China, South Korea and Taiwan), sub-licensable license to the patent rights and know-how related to MN-166 for the treatment of MS, except for ophthalmic solution formulations. MN-166 is not covered by a composition of matter patent. The U.S. method of use patent for MN-166 in MS underlying the license is set to expire on August 10, 2018. Corresponding method of use patents in certain foreign countries are set to expire on August 10, 2018. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted to Kyorin an exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licensable license to use the preclinical, clinical and regulatory databases to develop ophthalmic products incorporating the MN-166 compound anywhere in the world and non-ophthalmic products incorporating the MN-166 compound outside of our territory.\n\n10\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe license agreement may be terminated by either party following an uncured breach of any material provision in the agreement by the other party. We may terminate the agreement for any reason with 90 days written notice to Kyorin or, in the event that a third party claims that MN-166 infringes upon such third partys intellectual property rights, with 30 days written notice.\n\nThe term of this agreement is determined on a country-by-country basis and extends until the later of the expiration of the obligation to make payments under the agreement or the last date on which the manufacture, use or sale of the product would infringe a valid patent claim held by Kyorin but for the license granted by the agreement or the last date of the applicable market exclusivity period. In the absence of a valid patent claim and generic competition in a particular country, the agreement will expire on the earlier of five years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product by us or the end of the second consecutive calendar quarter in which generic competition exists in such country.\n\nUnder the license agreement, we have paid Kyorin $700,000 to date, and we are obligated to make payments of up to $5.0 million based on the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones. We are also obligated to pay a royalty on net sales of the licensed products.\n\nWe own, co-own or hold licenses to six issued U.S. patents and 15 pending U.S. patent applications as well as corresponding pending foreign patent applications covering MN-166 (ibudilast) and its analogs. These patents and patent applications are primarily related to our development portfolio of small molecule-based products and are currently directed to methods of treating various indications using ibudilast and its analogs.\n\nWe have been granted a U.S. patent which covers the use of MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of progressive forms of MS. The patent, which was granted in March 2012, will expire no earlier than November 2029, not including a potential extension under patent term restoration rules, and covers a method of treating PPMS or SPMS by administering ibudilast either alone or in combination with other drugs. Counterparts of this patent application have been granted in certain foreign jurisdictions. We have been granted a patent which covers the use of MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of neuropathic pain in the U.S. and it expires no earlier than December 2025. We have been granted a patent which covers the use of MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of drug addiction or drug dependence or withdrawal syndrome in the U.S. and it expires no earlier than January 2030. Counterparts of this patent application have been granted in certain foreign jurisdictions. We have been granted a patent that covers the use of MN-166 (ibudilast) to enhance opioid analgesia in acute pain settings from the European Patent Office (EPO) and it expires no earlier than January 2028.\n\nMN-221\n\nOn February 25, 2004, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kissei for the development and commercialization of MN-221. Kissei is a fully integrated Japanese pharmaceutical company and is listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. We obtained an exclusive, worldwide (excluding Japan), sub-licensable license to various patent rights and know-how related to MN-221 and other compounds disclosed or included in, or covered by, these patent rights, for all indications. This license includes an exclusive license under one U.S. patent and certain corresponding patents and patent applications in foreign countries and is sub-licensable upon receipt of the written consent of Kissei. The U.S. patent for MN-221 has composition of matter and method of use claims. The U.S. composition of matter patent underlying the license issued on October 17, 2000 and is set to expire no earlier than February 18, 2017, which does not include a potential extension under patent term restoration rules. Corresponding composition of matter patents in various other countries are set to expire no earlier than February 18, 2017.\n\nIn addition to the licensed patents, we have filed patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries regarding additional uses and formulations of MN-221. We have been granted a U.S. patent which covers the use of MN-221 for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and it expires no earlier than November 2030. This patent includes claims covering the use of MN-221 (bedoradrine) in combination with a standard of care\n\n11\n\nTable of Contents\n\ntreatment regimen and covers different routes of administration, including intravenous, oral and inhalation. Counterparts of this patent application are pending in certain foreign jurisdictions. We have been granted a U.S. patent that covers the use of MN-221 for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and it expires no earlier than April 2031.\n\nThe license agreement may be terminated by either party following an uncured breach of any material provision in the agreement by the other party, and we may terminate the agreement for scientific or commercial reasons upon 100 days prior written notice to Kissei during the development phase and 180 days prior written notice to Kissei during the commercialization phase.\n\nThe term of the agreement is determined on a country-by-country basis and extends until the expiration of the last Kissei patent (or equivalent) under license to expire or in the event that a valid claim does not exist or, if a valid claim expired more than ten years from the date of first commercial sale, ten years from the date of first commercial sale. In either case, the term of the agreement would not extend for any particular country past the date on which generic competition exists in such country.\n\nUnder the license agreement, we have paid Kissei $1.0 million to date, and we are obligated to make payments of up to $17.0 million based on the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones. We are also obligated to pay a royalty on net sales of the licensed products. Under the terms of the letter agreement we entered into with Kissei in September 2011, we agreed to renegotiate in good faith with Kissei the existing levels of the milestone payment amounts and royalty rates.\n\nMN-001\n\nOn March 14, 2002, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kyorin for the development and commercialization of MN-001. We obtained an exclusive, worldwide (excluding Japan, China, South Korea and Taiwan) sub-licensable license to the patent rights and know-how related to MN-001 and its active metabolite, MN-002, disclosed and included in, or covered by, these patents, in all indications, except for ophthalmic solution formulations. This license includes an exclusive, sub-licensable license under two U.S. patents and certain corresponding patents in foreign countries. The U.S. composition of matter patent for MN-001 underlying the license expired on February 23, 2009, and the U.S. composition of matter patent for MN-002 underlying the license expired on December 30, 2011. Foreign composition of matter patents for MN-001 and MN-002 have also expired. We have been granted nine U.S. patents covering certain compositions, uses and manufacturing processes associated with MN-001 and MN-002. Some of the uses covered by these patents include non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, ulcerative colitis, and irritable bowel syndrome. Patent applications corresponding to these U.S. patents were filed in certain foreign countries and some of the foreign patents have issued. We intend to rely upon the applicable period of post-approval regulatory exclusivity, in addition to any patents that may issue from our own patent applications.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, we granted to Kyorin an exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licensable license to use the preclinical, clinical and regulatory databases to develop ophthalmic products incorporating MN-001 anywhere in the world and non-ophthalmic products incorporating MN-001 outside of our territory. The license agreement may be terminated by either party following an uncured breach of any material provision in the agreement by the other party, and we may terminate the agreement for any reason with 90 days written notice to Kyorin or, in the event that a third party claims that the licensed patent rights or know-how infringe upon such third partys intellectual property rights, with 30 days written notice.\n\nThe term of this agreement is determined on a country-by-country basis and extends until the later of the expiration of the obligation to make payments under the agreement or the last date on which the manufacture, use or sale of the product would infringe a valid patent claim held by Kyorin but for the license granted by the agreement or the last date of the applicable market exclusivity period. In the absence of a valid patent claim and generic competition in a particular country, the agreement will expire on the earlier of five years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product by us or the end of the second consecutive calendar quarter in which generic competition exists in such country.\n\n12\n\nTable of Contents\n\nUnder the license agreement, we have paid Kyorin $4.0 million to date, and we are obligated to make payments of up to $5.0 million based on the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones. We are also obligated to pay a royalty on net sales of the licensed products.\n\nMN-029\n\nOn June 19, 2002, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Angiogene for the development and commercialization of the ANG-600 series of compounds. Angiogene is a privately held, British drug discovery company. We obtained an exclusive, worldwide, sub-licensable license to the patent rights and know-how related to the ANG-600 series of compounds disclosed in and included or covered by these patents for all indications. MN-029 is one of the ANG-600 series compounds covered by this license. This license includes an exclusive, sub-licensable license under three U.S. patents and certain corresponding patents and patent applications in foreign countries. The U.S. composition of matter patent for MN-029, which was issued on November 11, 2003, is set to expire on January 14, 2020. Patent applications corresponding to this U.S. patent were filed in certain foreign countries and one of those foreign patents has issued and remains active. In addition to the licensed patents, we have been granted a U.S. patent which covers MN-029 (denibulin) di-hydrochloride and expires no earlier than July 2032. The allowed claims cover a compound, pharmaceutical composition and method of treating certain cell proliferation diseases, including solid tumors, based on denibulin di-hydrochloride. Patent applications corresponding to this U.S. patent were filed in certain foreign countries.\n\nThe license agreement may be terminated by either party following an uncured breach of any material provision in the agreement by the other party, and we may terminate the agreement at any time by giving 30 days advance written notice to Angiogene.\n\nThe term of this agreement is determined on a country-by-country basis and extends until the earlier of the expiration of the last Angiogene patent (or equivalent) under license which has a valid claim to expire or 15 years from the date of first commercial sale.\n\nUnder the license agreement, we have paid Angiogene $1.4 million to date and are obligated to make payments of up to $16.5 million based on the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones. We are also obligated to pay a royalty on net sales of the licensed products.\n\nGeneral\n\nOur proposed commercial activities may conflict with patents which have been or may be granted to competitors, universities and/or others. Third parties could bring legal action against us, our licensors or our sub-licensees claiming patent infringement and could seek damages or enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected product or its use or the use of a process for the manufacturing of such products. If any such actions were to be successful, in addition to any potential liability for indemnification, damages and attorneys fees in certain cases, we could be required to obtain a license, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, in order to continue to manufacture, use or market the affected product. We also rely upon unpatented proprietary technology because, in some cases, our interests would be better served by reliance on trade secrets or confidentiality agreements than by patents. However, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or gain access to or disclose such proprietary technology. We may not be able to meaningfully protect our rights in such unpatented proprietary technology. We may also conduct research on other pharmaceutical compounds or technologies, the rights to which may be held by, or be subject to patent rights of, third parties. Accordingly, if products based on such research are commercialized, such commercial activities may infringe patents or other rights, which may require us to obtain a license to such patents or other rights. We are not aware of any third-party infringements of patents we hold or licenses and have not received any material claims by third parties of infringement by us of such parties intellectual property rights.\n\n13\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThere can be no assurance that patent applications filed by us or others, in which we have an interest as assignee, licensee or prospective licensee, will result in patents being issued or that, if issued, any of such patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology or products or could not be circumvented or challenged. For example, we have U.S. patents covering the method of using MN-166 to treat MS, the method of using MN-166 to treat addiction and the method of using MN-166 to treat neuropathic pain, but we do not have any composition of matter patent claims for MN-166 because that patent has expired. As a result, unrelated third parties may develop products with the same API as MN-166 so long as such parties do not infringe our method of use patents, other patents we have exclusive rights to through our licensor or any patents we may obtain for MN-166.\n\nIn addition, if we develop certain products that are not covered by any patents, we will be dependent on obtaining market exclusivity under the five-year new chemical entity exclusivity provisions of Hatch-Waxman Act for such products in the U.S. and/or 10-year data exclusivity provisions in Europe. If we are unable to obtain strong proprietary protection for our products after obtaining regulatory approval, competitors may be able to market competing generic products by taking advantage of an abbreviated procedure for obtaining regulatory clearance, including the ability to demonstrate bioequivalency to our product(s) without being required to conduct lengthy clinical trials. Certain of our license agreements provide for reduced royalties or, in some cases, foregone royalties in the event of generic competition.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe development and commercialization of new drugs is extremely competitive and characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress. Competition in our industry occurs on a variety of fronts, including developing and bringing new products to market before others, developing new products to provide the same benefits as existing products at lower cost and developing new products to provide benefits superior to those of existing products. We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and governmental agencies in the U.S. and abroad. Some of these competitors have products or are pursuing the development of drugs that target the same diseases and conditions that are the focus of our product development programs. Many of our competitors have products that have been approved or are in advanced development and may succeed in developing drugs that are more effective, safer and more affordable or more easily administered than ours or that achieve patent protection or commercialization sooner than our products. Our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any products that we are able to obtain approval for, if at all.\n\nIn many of our target disease areas, potential competitors are working to develop new compounds with different mechanisms of action and attractive efficacy and safety profiles. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, research and development resources (including personnel and technology), clinical trial experience, manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities and production facilities than we do. Smaller companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaboration arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies.\n\nMN-166 for Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (Progressive MS)\n\nOur MN-166 product candidate is in development for the treatment of progressive MS. Only one drug, mitoxantrone, is approved for treating this disease. However, mitoxantrone cannot be used on a long-term basis because of the potential for cardiac toxicity. Other programs in clinical development for progressive MS include Biogen Idecs Tysabri® (natalizumab), Novartiss BAF312 (siponimod), and AB Sciences masitinib.\n\nMN-166 for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)\n\nOur MN-166 product candidate is in development for the treatment of ALS. Only one drug, riluzole, is approved for treating ALS, and it has limited efficacy. We are aware of additional compounds in clinical development for the treatment of ALS at other companies including GlaxoSmithKline, BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. and AB Science.\n\n14\n\nTable of Contents\n\nMN-166 for Drug Addiction\n\nOur MN-166 product candidate has been in development for treatment of opioid withdrawal and methamphetamine addiction. Current treatments for opioid withdrawal symptoms include narcotics such as generic methadone and Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s Subutex® (buprenorphine) and Suboxone® (buprenorphine + the opioid antagonist naloxone). Other products approved for opioid dependence include Alkermes Vivitrol® (naltrexone monthly injection), Orexos Zubsolv® (buprenorphine and naloxone), and BioDelivery Sciencess Bunavail® (buprenorphine and naloxone). We are aware of additional compounds in development for the treatment of opioid dependence at companies including Titan Pharmaceuticals. Limited non-narcotic drug candidates for opioid withdrawal symptoms exist. Britannia Pharmaceuticals Limiteds BritLofex® (Lofexidine), licensed for development in U.S. clinical trials to US WorldMeds LLC, is an a2 adrenergic receptor agonist like clonidine which may have somewhat less orthostatic hypotension limitations. There are no pharmaceuticals currently approved for the treatment of methamphetamine addiction.\n\nMN-221 for Acute Exacerbations of Asthma\n\nOur MN-221 product candidate is being developed for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma in the emergency room setting. The current standard of care for acute exacerbations of asthma is inhaled albuterol (a ß 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist), inhaled ipratropium (an anticholinergic) and oral or injected corticosteroids. In addition, subcutaneously administered terbutaline (a ß 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist) is sometimes used to treat this condition, particularly in pediatric patients.\n\nMN-001 for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)\n\nOur MN-001 product candidate is being developed for the treatment of NASH. There are currently no therapeutic products approved for the treatment of NASH. There are ongoing studies to evaluate FDA-approved therapeutics not specifically indicated for NASH (e.g., metformin, rosiglitazone) to determine their safety and efficacy in patients with NASH. We are aware of additional compounds in clinical development for the treatment of NASH at other companies including Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Galectin Therapeutics, La Jolla Pharmaceutical and Raptor Pharmaceuticals.\n\nMN-001 for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)\n\nOur MN-001 product candidate is also being developed for the treatment of IPF. Products approved in the U.S. for treatment of IPF include Roches (formerly InterMune) Esbriet® (pirfenidone) and Boehringer Ingelheims OFEV® (nintedanib). Other companies working on clinical development programs for treatment of IPF include Gilead Sciences, MedImmune (AstraZeneca), and FibroGen.\n\nMN-029 for Solid Tumor Cancer\n\nOur MN-029 product candidate is being developed for the treatment of solid tumor cancers. Genentechs Kadcyla®, a HER2-targeted antibody and microtubule inhibitor conjugate, is approved for treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who previously were treated with trastuzumab and/or a taxane. Bayers Stivarga®, a kinase inhibitor approved for metastatic colorectal cancer, was also approved for patients with advanced, unresectable (not subject to surgical removal) or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor. We are aware of additional compounds in development for the treatment of solid tumor cancers at companies including Eli Lilly & Company, Hoffmann-La Roche and Novartis AG.\n\nGovernment Regulation\n\nGovernment authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, sampling, marketing and import and export\n\n15\n\nTable of Contents\n\nof pharmaceutical products and biologics such as those we are developing. In the U.S., the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and other federal statutes and regulations, subjects pharmaceutical products to extensive and rigorous review. Any failure to comply with applicable requirements, both before and after approval, may subject us, our third-party manufacturers, contractors, suppliers and partners to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal to approve pending applications, fines, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of manufacturing or marketing, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution.\n\nU.S. Regulatory Approval\n\nOverview. In the U.S., drugs and drug testing are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, as well as state and local government authorities. All of our product candidates in development will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. To obtain approval of a new product from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data supporting safety and efficacy, as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product and proposed labeling. Our product candidates are in the early stages of testing and none has been approved. The steps required before a drug can be approved generally involve the following:\n\n completion of nonclinical laboratory, animal studies, and formulation studies;\n\n submission of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the U.S.;\n\n completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each indication for which approval is sought;\n\n submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (NDA) accompanied by a substantial user fee;\n\n development of manufacturing processes which conform to FDA-mandated commercial good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) and satisfactory completion of FDA inspections to assess cGMP compliance and clinical investigator compliance with good clinical practices; and\n\n FDA review and approval of an NDA, which process may involve input from advisory committees to the FDA and may include post-approval commitments for further clinical studies and distribution restrictions intended to mitigate drug risks.\n\nThe testing, collection of data, preparation of necessary applications and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Additionally, statutes, rules, regulations and policies may change and new regulations may be issued that could delay approvals of our drugs. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing our applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties and costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing our product candidates.\n\nPreclinical Tests. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, its chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and other available information about the product candidate, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Preclinical tests and studies can take several years to complete and, despite completion of those tests and studies, the FDA may not permit clinical testing to begin.\n\nThe IND Process. An IND must be effective to administer an investigational drug to humans. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after its receipt by the FDA unless the FDA, before that time, places the IND on clinical hold. At any time thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold if the FDA deems it appropriate. In such case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin or continue. The IND application process may become extremely costly and substantially delay development of our product candidates. Moreover, positive results in preclinical tests or prior human studies do not necessarily predict positive results in subsequent clinical trials.\n\n16\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAnnual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any findings from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for human subjects.\n\nClinical Trials. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap:\n\n Phase 1: The potential drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, excretion and metabolism. If the investigational product is considered inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in the target population.\n\n Phase 2: The potential drug is introduced into a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications, assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.\n\n Phase 3: The potential drug is introduced into an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to further evaluate clinical efficacy and safety. The purpose of the Phase 3 trial is to conduct a risk/benefit analysis of the potential drug and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. It is common to have two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 trials for the FDA to approve an NDA.\n\nPrior to initiation of each clinical trial, an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each medical site proposing to conduct the clinical trials must review and approve the study protocol and study subjects must provide informed consent for participation in the study.\n\nWe cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase 1, 2 or 3 testing of our drug candidates within any specific time period, if at all. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDAs good clinical practices (GCP) requirements. The FDA may order the partial, temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The IRB may also require the clinical trial at that site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRBs requirements, or may impose other conditions. In addition, we may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.\n\nDuring the development of a new drug, we may request to meet with the FDA at times such as prior to submitting an IND, at the EOP2, and before an NDA is submitted, and meetings are not limited to these certain times. The purpose of the EOP2 meeting is to discuss the Phase 2 clinical trial results and present plans for a pivotal Phase 3 trial that, in our opinion, will support the approval of the new drug. Additional animal safety studies, formulation studies and pharmacology studies are concurrently conducted with the ongoing clinical trials. Also, in compliance with cGMP requirements, the process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the new drug is finalized, with the expectation that the quality, purity, and potency of the drug will meet standards. A sponsor may also request a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA), the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim.\n\nFast track designation: The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before\n\n17\n\nTable of Contents\n\nthe complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.\n\nAny product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including a Fast Track program, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an NDA designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.\n\nU.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity: Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of a drug candidate, some U.S. patents covering the product candidates may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the products approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent terms for one or more of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.\n\nMarket exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another companys NDA. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not\n\n18\n\nTable of Contents\n\nprohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a trial.\n\nRegulation outside the United States: In addition to regulations in the U.S., we and our strategic alliance partners will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.\n\nWhether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application (CTA) must be submitted to each countrys national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a countrys requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.\n\nThe requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nTo obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we or our strategic alliance partners must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.\n\nFor other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nIf we or our strategic alliance partners fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\n\nEmployees\n\nWe have assembled an experienced and cohesive management and support team, with core competencies in general management, clinical development, regulatory affairs and corporate development. We have 10 full-time employees as of the date of this report. We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have no history of work stoppages.\n\nCompany Information\n\nWe were originally incorporated in the State of Delaware in September 2000. Our principal executive offices are located at 4275 Executive Square, Suite 650, La Jolla, CA 92037. Our telephone number is 858-373-1500. Our website is www.medicinova.com, which includes links to reports we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. The information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of, and is not incorporated into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n19\n\nTable of Contents\n\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n\nWe operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and expect that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe have incurred significant net losses since our inception. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we had a net loss of $9.2 million. At December 31, 2014, from inception, our accumulated deficit was $310.6 million. We expect to incur substantial net losses for the next several years as we continue to develop certain of our existing product development candidates, and over the long-term if we expand our research and development programs and acquire or in-license products, technologies or businesses that are complementary to our own. As of December 31, 2014, we had available cash and cash equivalents of $11.7 million and working capital of $10.5 million. We expect to have approximately $9.5 million in available cash as of March 31, 2015, and we expect to spend approximately $7.1 million from April 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 to execute our strategic plan and fund operations. There can be no assurances that there will be adequate financing available to us in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may have to sell one or more of our programs or cease operations.\n\nOur future cash requirements will also depend on many factors, including:\n\n progress in, and the costs of future planned clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n\n the scope, prioritization and number of our product development programs;\n\n our obligations under our license agreements, pursuant to which we may be required to make future milestone payments upon the achievement of various milestones related to clinical, regulatory or commercial events;\n\n our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, including licensing and other arrangements;\n\n the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\n the costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for clinical or commercial production of our product candidates;\n\n the costs associated with any expansion of our management, personnel, systems and facilities;\n\n the costs associated with any litigation;\n\n the costs associated with the operations or wind-down of any business we may acquire;\n\n the costs involved in filing, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and\n\n the costs of establishing or contracting for sales and marketing capabilities and commercialization activities if we obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates.\n\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in 2015 relative to 2014 as we have increased focus on the development of MN-001 and MN-166 in 2015. Our estimate of cash requirements for future\n\n20\n\nTable of Contents\n\noperating expenses assumes that we do not incur significant clinical development expenditures unless we raise additional capital and/or enter into one or more strategic alliances. We do expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drug products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all.\n\nIf we have taxable income in the future, utilization of the net operating losses, or NOL, and tax credit carry-forwards will be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and similar state provisions due to ownership change limitations that have occurred. These ownership changes will limit the amount of NOL and tax credit carry-forwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively.\n\nIf we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to develop and commercialize our product candidates.\n\nWe have consumed substantial amounts of capital since our inception.\n\nOur business will continue to require us to incur substantial research and development expenses. We believe that without raising additional capital from accessible sources of financing, we will not otherwise have adequate funding to continue our operations and to complete the development of our existing product candidates or the commercialization of any products we successfully develop. There is no guarantee that adequate funds will be available when needed from debt or equity financings, arrangements with partners, or from other sources, on terms attractive to us. The inability to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed to fund our operations would require us to significantly delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all of our clinical or regulatory activities and reduce general and administrative expenses.\n\nWe do not have any products that are approved for commercial sale and therefore do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales in the foreseeable future, if ever.\n\nTo date, we have funded our operations primarily from sales of our securities and, to a lesser extent, debt financing. Although we received a $6 million milestone payment in January 2014, we do not expect to receive for at least the next several years, if at all, any revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates. We anticipate that, prior to our commercialization of a product candidate, out-licensing upfront and milestone payments will be our primary source of revenue if we can enter into collaborations, strategic alliances or other agreements that would provide us with such revenues. To obtain revenues from sales of our product candidates, we must succeed, either alone or with third parties, in developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing and marketing drugs with commercial potential. We may never succeed in these activities, and we may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our business operations or achieve and maintain profitability.\n\nWe are largely dependent on the success of our MN-166 product candidate and other product candidates and we cannot be certain that this product candidate will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\n\nWe currently have no products for sale, and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have any drug products approved for sale. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sales, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries. We are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the U.S. until we submit and receive approval of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for a product candidate from the FDA or its foreign equivalent from a foreign regulatory authority. Obtaining FDA approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. The success of our business currently depends primarily on the successful development and commercialization of our MN-166 product candidate, for the treatment of neurological disorders including MS, opioid withdrawal, methamphetamine addiction, chronic MOH and alcohol dependency. This product candidate has not completed the clinical development process, and therefore we have not submitted an NDA or\n\n21\n\nTable of Contents\n\nforeign equivalent or received marketing approval. We plan to focus our resources on accelerating and optimizing MN-166 development in collaboration with the investigators conducting multiple grant-funded, proof-of-concept clinical trials.\n\nThe clinical development program for MN-166 may not lead to commercial products for a number of reasons, including our clinical trials failure to demonstrate to the FDAs satisfaction that this product candidate is safe and effective, or our failure to obtain necessary approvals from the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities for any reason. We may also fail to obtain the necessary approvals if we have inadequate financial or other resources to advance our product candidates through the clinical trial process or are unable to secure a strategic collaboration or partnership with a third party. Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials or obtaining regulatory approval for MN-166 in a timely manner would have a material and adverse impact on our business and our stock price.\n\nBecause the results of early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, MN-166 or any other product candidate we advance into clinical trials in any indication may not have favorable results in later clinical trials, if any, or receive regulatory approval.\n\nOur product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in drug development. We will be required to demonstrate through well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in a diverse population for its target indications before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing, even at statistically significant levels.\n\nCompanies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. Any of our planned clinical trials for MN-166 or our other product candidates may not be successful for a variety of reasons, including the clinical trial designs, the failure to enroll a sufficient number of patients, undesirable side effects and other safety concerns and the inability to demonstrate sufficient efficacy. If a product candidate fails to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy, we would experience potentially significant delays in, or be required to abandon, development of such product candidate.\n\nIf we are unable to secure a collaboration for MN-221, we may be unable to complete its clinical development.\n\nFollowing our May 2012 announcement of the preliminary results of the Phase 2 MN-221-CL-007 clinical trial, we met with the FDA to review future development of this product candidate. The FDA identified the risk/benefit profile of MN-221 as a focal point for further development and advised that a clinical outcome, such as a reduction in hospitalizations, would need to be a pivotal trial primary endpoint. We have decided that future MN-221 development will be designed based on the feedback received from the FDA. We have also determined that future MN-221 clinical trial development will be partner-dependent from a funding perspective.\n\nOur attempts to develop MN-001 in NASH may detract from our efforts to develop other product candidates and may limit the effectiveness of our product development efforts as a whole.\n\nIn 2014, we determined to pursue development of MN-001 in NASH. These activities will divert financial and management resources from our other product development activities and may limit our ability to complete or continue those other programs.\n\nWe will rely on the joint venture company formed in China in 2011 to develop and commercialize MN-221 and other drug candidates in China and there is no assurance that the joint venture will be successful in doing so.\n\nWe entered into an agreement to form a joint venture company with Zhejiang Medicine Co., Ltd. and Beijing Medfron Technologies Co., Ltd. (formerly Beijing Make-Friend Medicine Technology Co., Ltd.)\n\n22\n\nTable of Contents\n\neffective September 27, 2011. The joint venture agreement provides for the joint venture company, Zhejiang Sunmy Bio-Medical Co., Ltd. (Zhejiang Sunmy), to develop and commercialize MN-221 in China and search for additional compounds to develop. A sublicense would be required under which Zhejiang Sunmy would license MN-221 from us. In accordance with the joint venture agreement, in March 2012 we paid $680,000 for our 30% interest in Zhejiang Sunmy. The other parties to the joint venture agreement provided funding for their combined 70% interest. In December 2013, the Board of Directors of Zhejiang Sunmy agreed to amend the joint venture agreement to allow for the departure of Zhejiang Medicine Co., Ltd. subject to the approval of the government of the Peoples Republic of China. In August 2014, the Chinese government approved the amendment to the joint venture agreement to allow for the departure of Zhejiang Medicine Co., Ltd. As of December 31, 2014, Beijing Medfron Medical Technologies Co., Ltd. and MediciNova each have a 50% interest in Zhejiang Sunmy. No additional capital was contributed by either remaining party. We have not entered into the sublicense of MN-221 with Zhejiang Sunmy as of the date of this report. There is no assurance the sublicense will be executed and there is no assurance that Zhejiang Sunmy will be able to proceed with the development of MN-221 in China.\n\nZhejiang Sunmy is a variable interest entity for which we are not the primary beneficiary as we do not have a majority of the board seats and we do not have power to direct or significantly influence the actions of the entity. We therefore account for the activities of Zhejiang Sunmy under the equity method whereby we absorb any loss or income generated by Zhejiang Sunmy according to our percentage ownership. At December 31, 2014, we reflect a long-term asset on our consolidated balance sheet which represents our investment in Zhejiang Sunmy, net of our portion of any generated loss or income.\n\nIn order to commercialize a therapeutic drug successfully, a product candidate must receive regulatory approval after the successful completion of clinical trials, which are long, complex and costly, have a high risk of failure and can be delayed or terminated at any time.\n\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive government regulations related to development, clinical trials, manufacturing and commercialization. The process of obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals is costly, time-consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. To receive regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates, we must conduct, at our own expense, adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in human patients to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product candidate. Clinical testing is expensive, takes many years and has an uncertain outcome. To date, we have obtained regulatory authorization to conduct eight clinical trials for four of our product development programs. INDs were approved by the FDA and are active for seven of our product candidates.\n\nIt may take years to complete the clinical development necessary to commercialize a drug, and delays or failure can occur at any stage, which may result in our inability to market and sell any of our product candidates that are ultimately approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and/or non-clinical testing. Interim results of clinical trials do not necessarily predict final results, and success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials even after obtaining promising results in earlier clinical trials. In addition, any delays in completing clinical trials or the rejection of data from a clinical trial by a regulatory authority will result in increased development costs and could have a material adverse effect on the development of the impacted product candidate.\n\nIn connection with the conduct of clinical trials for each of our product candidates, we face many risks, including the risks that:\n\n the product candidate may not prove to be effective in treating the targeted indication;\n\n clinical trial participants and/or patients may experience serious adverse event"
