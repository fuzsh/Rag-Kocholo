        "text": "Pharmacologic doses of systemic corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone) administered for prolonged periods can result in physiological dependence due to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) suppression. Exogenously administered corticosteroids exert a negative feedback effect on the pituitary, inhibiting the secretion of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). This results in a decrease in ACTH-mediated synthesis of endogenous corticosteroids and androgens by the adrenal cortex. The severity of secondary adrenocortical insufficiency varies among individuals and is dependent on the dose, frequency, time of administration, and duration of therapy. Systemic administration of the drug on alternate days may help to alleviate this adverse effect. Patients with HPA suppression will require increased doses of corticosteroid therapy during periods of physiologic stress. Acute adrenal insufficiency and even death can occur with abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Discontinuation of prolonged oral corticosteroid therapy should be gradual since HPA suppression can last for up to 12 months following cessation of therapy. Patients may continue to need supplemental corticosteroid treatment during periods of physiologic stress or infectious conditions, even after the drug has been discontinued. A withdrawal syndrome unrelated to adrenocortical insufficiency can occur following sudden discontinuance of corticosteroid therapy. This syndrome includes symptoms such as appetite loss, malaise, lethargy, nauseousness, head pain/ache, joint pain, muscle pain, fever, exfoliative dermatitis, loss of weight, and hypotension. These effects are believed to be due to the sudden change in corticosteroid concentration rather than to low corticosteroid levels. Increased intracranial pressure with papilledema (i.e., pseudotumor cerebri) has also been reported with glucocorticoids usually after treatment withdrawal.[60760] [60761] [64165]\n\nProlonged systemic dexamethasone therapy can adversely affect the endocrine system, resulting in hypercorticism (Cushing's syndrome including fat abnormalities such as buffalo hump and moon face), hypertrichosis or hirsutism, menstrual irregularity, or a decrease in carbohydrate or glucose tolerance.[60760] [60761] [64165]\n\nSystemic corticosteroids are a common cause of drug-induced hyperglycemia. In the hospital setting, there is evidence that more than 50% of the patients receiving high-dose systemic steroids develop hyperglycemia, with many more having at least 1 episode of hyperglycemia or a mean blood glucose of 140 mg/dL or greater. Long-term use produces metabolic and endocrine effects that include insulin resistance that may lead to new diagnoses of diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients without a history of hyperglycemia or DM prior to corticosteroid use. Glucosuria (glycosuria) and aggravation of existing DM may also occur.[68700] [60760] [60761] [64165]\n\nEndogenous glucocorticoids are responsible for protein metabolism; prolonged therapy with pharmaceutical glucocorticoids like dexamethasone can result in various musculoskeletal and joint manifestations, including myopathy (myalgia, muscle wasting, muscle weakness or myasthenia, and quadriplegia), arthralgia, tendon rupture, bone matrix atrophy (osteoporosis and osteopenia), bone fractures such as vertebral compression fractures or fractures of long bones, and avascular necrosis of femoral or humeral heads. These effects are more likely to occur in older or debilitated patients. Of note, abrupt cessation of corticosteroids can cause arthralgia and myalgia. Glucocorticoids interact with calcium metabolism at many sites, including: decreasing the synthesis by osteoblasts of the principal proteins of bone matrix, malabsorption of calcium in both the nephron and the gut, and reduction of sex hormone concentrations. Although all of these actions probably contribute to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the actions on osteoblasts are most important. Glucocorticoids do not modify vitamin D metabolism. Intra-articular injections of corticosteroids can cause Charcot-like arthropathy and post-injection flare. Atrophy at the site of injection has been reported following administration of soluble glucocorticoids.[24837] [60760] [60761] [64165] Because of retardation of bone growth, children receiving prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy, like dexamethasone, may have growth inhibition. Growth inhibition has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients.[60760] [60761] [64165]\n\nAdverse gastrointestinal (GI) effects associated with systemic corticosteroid (e.g., dexamethasone) administration include nausea and vomiting. Abdominal pain or distention, appetite stimulation, weight gain, pancreatitis, gastritis, hiccups, peptic ulcer with possible GI perforation and GI bleeding, perforation of the small and large bowel (particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease), and esophageal ulceration (ulcerative esophagitis) have also been reported.[60760] [60761] [64165] Although it was once believed that corticosteroids contributed to the development of peptic ulcer disease, in a review of 93 studies of corticosteroid use, the incidence of peptic ulcer disease was not found to be higher in steroid recipients compared to control groups. While most of these studies did not utilize endoscopy, it is unlikely that corticosteroids contribute to the development of peptic ulcer disease.[24362]\n\nCorticosteroid therapy including dexamethasone can mask the symptoms of infection and should generally be avoided during an acute viral, fungal, or bacterial infection. Leukocytosis is a common physiologic effect of systemic corticosteroid therapy and may need to be differentiated from the leukocytosis that occurs with inflammatory or infectious processes.[30943] [65096] [65097] Immunosuppression from corticosteroids is most likely to occur in patients receiving high-dose (e.g., equivalent to 1 mg/kg or more of prednisone daily), systemic corticosteroid therapy for any period of time, particularly in conjunction with corticosteroid-sparing drugs (e.g., troleandomycin) and/or concomitant immunosuppressant agents; however, patients receiving moderate dosages of systemic corticosteroids for short periods or low dosages for prolonged periods may also be at risk. Corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may result in the activation of latent viral (e.g., herpes) or bacterial (e.g., tuberculosis) infections and should not be used in patients with an active infection except when appropriate anti-infective therapy is instituted concomitantly. Patients receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids should be advised to avoid exposure to measles or varicella (chickenpox) and, if exposed to these diseases, to seek medical advice immediately. Monitoring systemic corticosteroid recipients for signs of opportunistic fungal infection is recommended, as cases of oropharyngeal candidiasis have been reported. Development of Kaposi's sarcoma has also been associated with prolonged administration of corticosteroids; discontinuation of the corticosteroid may result in clinical improvement.[60760] [60761] [64165] Bronchitis was noted in 5% of dexamethasone ophthalmic implant recipients during clinical trials and at an incidence higher than with placebo; secondary ophthalmic infection or exacerbation of infection has also been reported with other ophthalmic and intraocular dosage forms.[41921] [48640] [54348]\n\nVarious adverse dermatologic effects reported during systemic corticosteroid therapy include skin atrophy (thin fragile skin), increased sweating (hyperhidrosis), acne vulgaris, striae, acneiform rash, alopecia, xerosis, perineal pain and irritation, purpura, rash (unspecified), telangiectasia, facial erythema, petechiae, ecchymosis or easy bruising, and suppression of reactions to skin tests. An increased susceptibility to skin ulcer may occur in patients with impaired circulation. Hypersensitivity reactions may manifest as allergic dermatitis, urticaria, anaphylactoid reactions, and/or angioedema. Burning or tingling in the perineal area may occur following IV injection of corticosteroids. Parenteral corticosteroid therapy has also produced skin hypopigmentation, skin hyperpigmentation, scarring, and other types of injection site reaction (e.g., induration, delayed pain or soreness, subcutaneous and cutaneous atrophy, and sterile abscesses).[60760] [60761] [64165]\n\nIn general, systemic corticosteroids like dexamethasone can lead to impaired wound healing.[60760] [60761] [64165]\n\nProlonged administration of systemic dexamethasone can result in edema and fluid retention due to sodium retention; electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia); and hypertension.[60760] [60761] [64165] In a review of 93 studies of corticosteroid use, hypertension was found to develop 4 times as often in steroid recipients compared to control groups.[24362] In another study, an increased risk of heart failure was observed for medium-dose glucocorticoid use as compared with nonuse. At the beginning of the study, patients were at least 40 years of age and had not been hospitalized for cardiovascular disease. Medium exposure was defined as less than 7.5 mg daily of prednisolone or the equivalent given orally, rectally, or parenterally.[30697] Increased blood pressure was noted in 13% of dexamethasone ophthalmic insert recipients for one of the products during clinical trials.[41921]\n\nAdverse neurologic effects have been reported during prolonged systemic dexamethasone administration and include insomnia, vertigo or dizziness, restlessness, amnesia and memory impairment, increased motor activity, impaired cognition, paresthesias, ischemic peripheral neuropathy, seizures, neuritis, and EEG changes. Mental disturbances, including depression, anxiety, euphoria, personality changes, emotional lability, delirium, dementia, hallucinations, irritability, mania, mood swings, schizophrenic reactions, withdrawn behavior, and psychosis have also been reported; emotional lability and psychotic problems can be exacerbated by corticosteroid therapy. Headache may be a sign of elevated intracranial pressure.[60760] [60761] [64165] Arachnoiditis, meningitis, paresis, paraplegia, and sensory disturbances have occurred after intrathecal administration. Serious neurologic events, some resulting in death, have been reported with epidural injection of corticosteroids. Specific events reported include, but are not limited to, spinal cord infarction, paraplegia, quadriplegia, cortical blindness, and stroke.[60760] Headache was noted in 1% to 4% of dexamethasone ophthalmic insert/implant recipients during clinical trials, at incidences higher than with placebo.[41921] [63796]\n\nDexamethasone can cause increased intraocular pressure or ocular hypertension, the magnitude of which depends on the formulation used, indication for use, and the frequency and duration of dosing. Ocular hypertension can occur after 1 to 6 weeks of topical ophthalmic therapy, and it is usually reversible upon discontinuance of the drug. Use of the intravitreal implant has resulted in ocular hypertension (glaucoma) in 5% of patients in clinical trials and increased ocular pressure (IOP) occurred in 25% to 35% of patients receiving the intravitreal implant. In retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and uveitis trials, IOP peaked at 60 days, returning to baseline by day 180. During the initial treatment period with the intravitreal implant for RVO and uveitis, 1% of patients required laser or surgical procedures to manage elevated IOP. In a 2-year observational study with the intravitreal implant, among patients who received more than 2 injections, increased IOP was reported in 24% (n = 68) patients. Frequently check IOP during receipt of ophthalmic preparations of dexamethasone. In diseases that cause thinning of the cornea or sclera, topical ocular steroids have been known to cause perforation. Intravitreal injections have also been associated with endophthalmitis, ocular inflammation, and retinal detachment. In clinical trials, the use of the intravitreal implant has resulted in ocular hemorrhage (conjunctival hemorrhage) (22% to 23%), ocular pain (8%), conjunctival hyperemia (7%), conjunctivitis (6%), vitreous floaters (5%), conjunctival edema (5%), xerophthalmia (5%), vitreous opacities (3%), retinal aneurysm (3%), foreign body sensation (2%), corneal erosion (2%), keratitis (2%), anterior chamber inflammation (2%), retinal tear (2%), eyelid ptosis (2%), vitreous hemorrhage (ocular hemorrhage, 6%), and vitreous detachment (2% to 4%). Postmarketing, complication of device insertion resulting in ocular tissue injury including sclera, subconjunctiva, lens and retina (implant misplacement), device dislocation with or without corneal edema, and ocular hypotonia (associated with vitreous leakage due to injection) were noted. Patients with an absent or torn posterior capsule of the lens are at increased risk of migration of the intravitreal implant into the anterior chamber.[41921] The most common ocular adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with dexamethasone ophthalmic insert for ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery were: anterior chamber inflammation including iritis and iridocyclitis (10%), increased intraocular pressure (6%), reduced visual acuity (2%), ocular pain (1%), cystoid macular edema (1%), corneal edema (1%), and conjunctival hyperemia (1%). The most common ocular adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with dexamethasone ophthalmic insert for itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis were: increased intraocular pressure (3%), increased lacrimation (1%), ocular discharge (1%), and reduced visual acuity (1%).[63796] Ocular irritation including transient stinging, burning, or tearing and keratoconjunctivitis may occur during use of ophthalmic dexamethasone. Allergic reactions have also been reported; ocular pruritus can occur. Ocular discomfort (10%) and eye irritation (1%) were the most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical studies with dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension. All other adverse reactions from these studies occurred with a frequency less than 1% including keratitis, conjunctivitis, dry eye (xerophthalmia), photophobia, blurred vision, ocular pruritus, foreign body sensation, increased lacrimation, abnormal ocular sensation, eyelid margin crusting, and ocular hyperemia. Postmarketing adverse reactions with dexamethasone topical ophthalmic suspension use include corneal erosion, dizziness, ocular pain, eyelid ptosis, headache, hypersensitivity reactions, and mydriasis.[61633] In patients receiving dexamethasone intraocular suspension for injection, the most common adverse reactions occurring in 5% to 15% of patients included intraocular pressure or ocular hypertension, corneal edema and iritis. Other ocular adverse reactions occurring in 1% to 5% of patients included corneal endothelial cell loss, blepharitis, ocular pain, cystoid macular edema, xerophthalmia, ocular inflammation, posterior capsule opacification, blurred vision, reduced visual acuity, vitreous floaters, foreign body sensation, photophobia, and vitreous detachment.[48640] Prolonged use of dexamethasone therapy by any route can result in ocular nerve damage including optic neuritis and visual defects. Temporary or permanent visual impairment, including blurred vision and blindness, has been reported with glucocorticoid administration by several routes of administration including intranasal and ophthalmic administration. Other ocular adverse reactions resulting from systemic corticosteroid therapy can include corneal perforation, exophthalmos, slowing of corneal wound healing, increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, blurred vision, or retinopathy.[60760] [60761] [64165] Consider referring patients who develop ocular symptoms or use systemic corticosteroid-containing products for more than 6 weeks to an ophthalmologist for evaluation.[41921] [48640] [60760] [60761] [61633] [64165] Dexamethasone (by any route) can reduce host resistance to infection. Secondary fungal and viral infections of the eye (ocular infection) can be masked or exacerbated by corticosteroid therapy. Investigate the possibility of fungal infection if patients have persistent corneal ulceration. Prolonged use of dexamethasone therapy by any route has resulted in posterior subcapsular cataracts.[48640] [60760] [60761] [64165] The mechanism of corticosteroid-induced cataract formation is uncertain but may involve disruption of sodium-potassium pumps in the lens epithelium leading to accumulation of water in lens fibers and agglutination of lens proteins.[24813] The incidence of cataracts with initial use of the intravitreal implant in clinical trials of patients with RVO or uveitis was 5% within the first 6 months; however, the overall incidence after a second intravitreal implant injection was higher after 1 year. In diabetic macular edema (DME) trials, the incidence of cataract development in patients who had a phakic study eye was higher in the dexamethasone group (68%) compared with sham (21%). Among these patients, 61% of dexamethasone subjects vs. 8% of sham-controlled subjects underwent cataract surgery. In a 2-year observational study, among patients who received more than 2 injections, the most frequent adverse reaction was cataract 54% (n = 96 out of 178 phakic eyes at baseline).[41921]\n\nHypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, fat embolism, palpitations, sinus tachycardia, bradycardia, syncope, vasculitis, necrotizing angiitis, thrombosis, thromboembolism, and phlebitis, specifically, thrombophlebitis, have been associated with systemic corticosteroid therapy such as dexamethasone. Systemic glucocorticoid use appears to increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, left ventricular rupture (in persons who recently experienced a myocardial infarction), angina, angioplasty, coronary revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, cardiomegaly, arrhythmia exacerbation and ECG changes, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (in premature infants), congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema, cardiac arrest or cardiovascular death.[60760] [60761] [64165] As determined from observational data, the rate of cardiovascular events was 17 per 1,000 person-years among 82,202 non-users of glucocorticoids. In contrast, the rate was 23.9 per 1,000 person-years among 68,781 glucocorticoid users. Furthermore, the rate of cardiovascular events was 76.5 per 1,000 person-years for high exposure patients. After adjustment for known covariates by multivariate analysis, high-dose glucocorticoid use was associated with a 2.56-fold increased risk of cardiovascular events as compared with nonuse. At the beginning of the study, patients were at least 40 years of age and had not been hospitalized for cardiovascular disease. High glucocorticoid exposure was defined as at least 7.5 mg daily of prednisolone (or equivalent) given orally, rectally, or parenterally whereas medium exposure was defined as less than the above dosage by any of the 3 routes. Low-dose exposure was defined as inhaled, topical, or nasal usage only.[30697]\n\nCases of elevated hepatic enzymes (usually reversible upon discontinuation) and hepatomegaly have been associated with corticosteroid receipt such as dexamethasone.[60760] [60761] [64165]\n\nEpidural administration of corticosteroids should be used with great caution. Rare, but serious adverse reactions, including cortical blindness, stroke, spinal cord infarction, paralysis, seizures, nerve injury, brain edema, and death have been associated with epidural administration of injectable corticosteroids. These events have been reported with and without the use of fluoroscopy. Many cases were temporally associated with the corticosteroid injection; reactions occurred within minutes to 48 hours after injection. Some cases of neurologic events were confirmed through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan. Many patients did not recover from the reported adverse effects. Discuss the benefits and risks of epidural corticosteroid injections with the patient before treatment. If a decision is made to proceed with corticosteroid epidural administration, counsel patients to seek emergency medical attention if they experience symptoms after injection such as vision changes, tingling in the arms or legs, dizziness, severe headache, seizures, or sudden weakness or numbness of face, arm, or leg.[57052] [57053]\n\nDexamethasone is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components. Although true corticosteroid hypersensitivity is rare, it is possible, though also rare, that such patients will display cross-hypersensitivity to other corticosteroids. It is advisable that patients who have a hypersensitivity reaction to any corticosteroid undergo skin testing, which, although not a conclusive predictor, may help to determine if hypersensitivity to another corticosteroid exists. Such patients should be carefully monitored during and following the administration of any corticosteroid.[65868] [27616] [54285] [54286] [64165] [48640] [41921] [63796] [49533] [54348]\n\nProlonged administration of pharmacological doses of systemic, nasal, inhaled or topical corticosteroids (resulting in systemic absorption) may result in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) suppression and/or manifestations of Cushing's syndrome in some patients. Adrenal suppression and increased intracranial pressure have been reported with the use and/or withdrawal of various corticosteroid formulations in pediatric patients.[60760] [51792] Acute adrenal insufficiency and even death may occur following abrupt discontinuation of systemic therapy. In addition, a withdrawal syndrome unrelated to adrenocortical insufficiency may occur following sudden discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy.[60760] [60761] [64165] These effects are thought to be due to the sudden change in glucocorticoid concentration rather than to low corticosteroid concentrations. Withdraw prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy (duration of treatment of more than 2 weeks) gradually. HPA suppression can last for up to 12 months following cessation of systemic therapy. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the topical corticosteroid. HPA-suppressed patients may need supplemental corticosteroid treatment during periods of physiologic stress, such as post-surgical stress, acute blood loss, or infectious conditions, even after the corticosteroid has been discontinued. Encourage patients currently receiving chronic corticosteroid therapy or who have had corticosteroids discontinued within the last 12 months to carry identification advising the need for administration of corticosteroids in situations of increased stress.[54138] [54286] [64165] [60760] [60761]\n\nPotential adverse effects of chronic corticosteroid therapy should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the availability of other treatment alternatives. Prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy can lead to osteopenia, osteoporosis, vertebral compression fractures, aseptic necrosis of femoral and humeral heads, and pathologic fractures of long bones secondary to decreased bone formation, increased bone resorption, and protein catabolism in any patient.[60760] [60761] [64165] A high-protein diet may alleviate or prevent the adverse effects associated with protein catabolism. The elderly, post-menopausal, and pediatric patients may be more susceptible to the effects on bone. Chronic systemic dexamethasone therapy may cause growth inhibition in pediatric patients due to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression and inhibition of bone growth. Corticosteroids should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. Because bone development is critical in pediatric patients, monitoring is warranted in patients receiving high-dose or chronic corticosteroid treatment. Use of the lowest effective dose is recommended to minimize the occurrence of systemic adverse effects. Monitor growth routinely.[51792] [60760] [60761] [64165]\n\nIf surgery is required, patients should advise their physician that they received prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy, such as dexamethasone, within the last 12 months and state the disease for which they were being treated. For systemic therapy, identification cards that include disease state, type and dose of corticosteroid, and physician should always be carried with the patient. Long-acting dexamethasone injection preparations, which are no longer marketed in the U.S., are not suitable for use in acute stress situations. To avoid drug-induced adrenal insufficiency, a supportive corticosteroid dosage may be required in times of stress (such as trauma, surgery, or severe illness) both during treatment with these injections and for a year afterward.[60760] [60761] [64165]\n\nSystemic corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, may cause immunosuppression and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can: 1) Reduce resistance to new infections, 2) Exacerbate existing infections, 3) Increase the risk of disseminated infections, 4) Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections 5) Mask some signs of infection. Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages. Monitor for the development of infection and consider corticosteroid withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed. Do not administer dexamethasone injection by an intraarticular, intrabursal, or intratendinous route in the presence of acute local infection. If dexamethasone is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis (TB) or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of TB may occur. Closely monitor such patients for TB reactivation. During prolonged dexamethasone therapy, patients with latent TB or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis. Viral infection, such as varicella zoster (chickenpox or shingles) and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids; other herpes infection (herpes simplex) may also disseminate in immunosuppressed individuals. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with ocular herpes simplex. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with ocular herpes simplex. In corticosteroid-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are nonimmune, avoid exposure of these people to these viral infections. If a corticosteroid-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be indicated. If varicella develops, consider treatment with antiviral. If a corticosteroid-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. Hepatitis B exacerbation/reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B virus carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including dexamethasone. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated people who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection. Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with systemic corticosteroids. For individuals who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, consult providers with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy. Systemic dexamethasone use is contraindicated in the presence of a systemic fungal infection. Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid corticosteroid use in the presence of a fungal infection unless a corticosteroid is needed to control drug reactions. If a fungal infection develops during chronic corticosteroid therapy, corticosteroid withdrawal or dosage reduction is recommended. Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, may activate latent amebiasis. Latent or active amebiasis should be ruled out before initiating dexamethasone in people who have spent time in the tropics or have unexplained diarrhea. Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, should be used with great care in the presence of known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) helminth infection. Corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gram-negative septicemia. In selected patients from strongyloidiasis endemic areas who need systemic corticosteroids, consider administering prophylactic treatment. Also avoid corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, in people with cerebral malaria.[65868] [60760] [60761] [64165] The use of ophthalmic dexamethasone formulations is contraindicated in herpes simplex virus epithelial keratitis, the acute infectious stages of vaccinia (smallpox), varicella, and many other viral ocular infection diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva, mycobacterial infection of the eye, and fungal diseases of ocular or auricular structures.[48640] [41921] [63796] [49533] [54348]\n\nDo not use high doses of systemic corticosteroids such as dexamethasone for the treatment of traumatic brain injury. An increase in early mortality (at 2 weeks) and late mortality (at 6 months) was noted in patients with head trauma who were determined not to have other clear indications for corticosteroid treatment; in the trial, patients received methylprednisolone hemisuccinate.[60760]\n\nCorticosteroid therapy, including systemic dexamethasone therapy, has been associated with left ventricular free-wall rupture in patients with recent myocardial infarction, and should therefore be used cautiously in these patients. As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving systemic corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal disease or insufficiency.[60760] [60761] [64165]\n\nSystemic corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, may decrease glucose tolerance, produce hyperglycemia, and aggravate or precipitate diabetes mellitus. This may especially occur in patients predisposed to diabetes mellitus. When corticosteroid therapy is necessary for patients with diabetes mellitus, changes in insulin, oral antidiabetic agent dosage, and/or diet may be required.[60760] [60761] [64165]\n\nAn acute myopathy has been observed with the use of high doses of systemic corticosteroids, most often occurring in patients with neuromuscular disease disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis), or in patients receiving concomitant therapy with neuromuscular blocking drugs. This acute myopathy is generalized, may involve ocular and respiratory muscles, and may result in quadriparesis. Elevation of creatinine kinase may occur. Clinical improvement or recovery after stopping corticosteroids may require weeks to years.[60760] [60761] [64165]\n\nSystemic corticosteroid use may be associated with neuro-psychiatric effects ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychosis. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. Inform patients or caregivers of the potential for mood and behavioral changes with systemic dexamethasone treatment and encourage them to seek medical attention if psychiatric symptoms develop, especially if depressed mood (depression) or suicidal ideation is suspected.[60760] [60761] [64165]\n\nMetabolic clearance of corticosteroids is decreased in hypothyroidism and increased in hyperthyroidism. Changes in thyroid disease status of a patient may necessitate an adjustment in systemic dexamethasone dosage.[60760] [60761] [64165]\n\nSystemic corticosteroids should be used with caution in patients with active or latent peptic ulcer disease, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis, since steroids may increase the risk of a gastrointestinal (GI) perforation. Signs of peritoneal irritation following GI perforation in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent. Corticosteroids should not be used in patients where there is a possibility of impending GI perforation, abscess, or pyogenic infection. There is an enhanced effect due to decreased metabolism of systemic corticosteroids in patients with severe hepatic disease with cirrhosis.[60760] [60761] [64165]\n\nSystemic corticosteroids, like dexamethasone, may cause impaired wound healing. Ophthalmic and ocular dosage forms may cause impairment of wound healing within or near the site of application.[60760] [60761] [64165] [48640] [41921] [63796] [49533] [54348]\n\nProlonged use of systemic corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, increased intraocular pressure or glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infection due to bacteria, fungi or viruses. The use of systemic corticosteroids is not recommended in the treatment of optic neuritis and may lead to an increase in the risk of new episodes.[60760] [60761] [64165] Ophthalmic dexamethasone should be used with caution in patients with corneal abrasion. Alos, ophthalmic dexamethasone is more likely than other ophthalmic agents to increase intraocular pressure, so intraocular pressure should be measured every 2 to 4 weeks for the first 2 months of therapy, and every 1 to 2 months thereafter. Ophthalmic dexamethasone therapy should be undertaken with caution in patients with a history of open-angle glaucoma, myopia, Krukenberg's spindle, or diabetes because these patients have an increased risk of developing ocular hypertension during therapy. The use of ophthalmic corticosteroids in phakic individuals may promote the development of posterior subcapsular cataracts.[54348] [61633] [41921] [48640] [63796] The dexamethasone intravitreal implant is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma who have cup to disc ratio more than 0.8. Dexamethasone intravitreal implant is also contraindicated in patients who have a tear or a rupture of posterior ocular lens capsule; these patients with an absent or torn posterior capsule of the lens are at increased risk of migration of the intravitreal implant into the anterior chamber. Laser posterior capsulotomy in pseudophakic patients is not a contraindication for the dexamethasone intravitreal implant. Intravitreal injections have been associated with endophthalmitis, eye inflammation, increased intraocular pressure, and retinal detachments; regularly monitor the treated individual following the injection of the implant.[41921] The initial insertion and continuation of dexamethasone ophthalmic insert therapy should be made only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy, and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after 2 days, re-evaluate the patient.[63796]\n\nCorticosteroid therapy usually does not contraindicate vaccination with live-virus vaccines when such therapy is of short-term (less than 2 weeks); low to moderate dose; long-term alternate-day treatment with short-acting preparations; maintenance physiologic doses (replacement therapy); ophthalmic administration, or by intra-articular, bursal or tendon injection. The immunosuppressive effects of steroid treatment differ, but many clinicians consider a dose equivalent to either 2 mg/kg/day or 20 mg/day of prednisone as sufficiently immunosuppressive to raise a concern about the safety of immunization with live-virus vaccines. In general, patients with severe immunosuppression due to large doses of corticosteroids should not receive vaccination with live-virus vaccines. When cancer chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy is being considered (e.g., for patients with Hodgkin's disease or organ transplantation), vaccination should precede the initiation of chemotherapy or immunotherapy by 2 or more weeks. Patients vaccinated while on immunosuppressive therapy or in the 2 weeks prior to starting therapy should be considered unimmunized and should be revaccinated at least 3 months after discontinuation of therapy. In patients who have received high-dose, systemic corticosteroids for 2 or more weeks, it is recommended to wait at least 3 months after discontinuation of therapy before administering a live-virus vaccine.[60760] [60761]\n\nThere are no adequate, well-controlled studies for the use of dexamethasone in pregnant women; therefore, the manufacturers recommend that the drug be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. For COVID-19, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends use of the drug in pregnant patients, if indicated, as the potential benefit of decreased maternal mortality justifies the low risk of fetal adverse effects with the short course of therapy.[65314] Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in many species when given in systemic doses equivalent to the human dose. Animal studies in which corticosteroids have been given to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits have yielded an increased incidence of cleft palate in the offspring.[60760] [60761] [64165] In addition, dexamethasone has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and rabbits following topical ophthalmic application in multiples of the therapeutic dose.[61633] Topical ocular administration of dexamethasone to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis produced embryofetal lethality, cleft palate and multiple visceral malformations.[41921] [63796] Topical and otic corticosteroids should not be used in large amounts, on large areas, or for prolonged periods of time in pregnant women. Dexamethasone injections have been used medically later in pregnancy to induce fetal lung maturation in patients at risk for pre-term delivery; use is for select circumstances and for a limited duration of time.[33038] [33039] [33040] An infant who is born to a woman receiving large doses of systemic corticosteroids during pregnancy should be monitored for signs of adrenal insufficiency, and appropriate therapy should be initiated, if necessary.\n\nSystemic use of dexamethasone has not been studied during breast-feeding; corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Caution is warranted, and some manufacturers recommend discontinuing breast-feeding if systemic dexamethasone treatment is needed.[60760] [60761] [64165] However, experts generally consider inhaled corticosteroids and oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone and prednisolone), acceptable to use during breast-feeding.[33723] [33724] [31822] There is no information regarding dexamethasone effects on breastfed infants or milk production or its presence in human milk following placement of the intravitreal implant or intracanalicular insert to inform risk to an infant during lactation.[41921] [63796] However, the systemic concentration of dexamethasone following administration of the intracanalicular insert is low.[63796] It is not known whether topical ophthalmic administration of dexamethasone could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk.[61633] [49533] For COVID-19, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends dexamethasone be offered to lactating mothers who qualify for therapy without interruption of breast-feeding.[65314] Consider the benefits of breast-feeding, the risk of potential infant drug exposure, and the risk of an untreated or inadequately treated condition.\n\nThe routine use of high-dose (greater than 0.5 mg/kg/day) dexamethasone for either the prevention or treatment of chronic lung disease in premature neonates is not recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) due to a lack of survival benefit and concern about long-term adverse outcomes, particularly increased rates of cerebral palsy. Studies utilizing lower doses of dexamethasone (less than 0.2 mg/kg/day) have not reported increased rates of adverse neurodevelopmental effects; however, due to the small number of patients included in these studies, the AAP states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of low-dose dexamethasone and further study is warranted.[54338] In a geographical cohort study of 148 extremely premature pediatric patients (born less than 28 weeks gestation), 55 (27%) received postnatal dexamethasone (mean cumulative dose 7.7 mg/kg) during the neonatal period. Patients receiving dexamethasone had smaller total brain tissue volume (mean difference -3.6%, p value = 0.04) and smaller white matter, thalami, and basal ganglia volumes (p is less than 0.05 for all) when compared with participants who did not receive postnatal dexamethasone. There was also a trend of smaller total brain and white matter volumes with an increased dose of postnatal dexamethasone.[56910] Avoid the use of dexamethasone injectable formulations containing benzyl alcohol in premature neonates and neonates. Administration of benzyl alcohol to neonates can result in 'gasping syndrome,' which is a potentially fatal condition characterized by metabolic acidosis and CNS, respiratory, circulatory, and renal dysfunction; it is also characterized by high concentrations of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine. While the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known, 'gasping syndrome' has been associated with daily benzyl alcohol exposure above 99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth-weight neonates. Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic failure, renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse. Rare cases of death, primarily in premature neonates, have been reported. Further, an increased incidence of kernicterus, especially in small, premature neonates has been reported. Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources. Premature neonates, neonates with low birth weight, and patients who receive a high dose may be more likely to develop toxicity.[60760]\n\nUse systemic corticosteroids with caution in the geriatric individual. Geriatric and debilitated adults are especially susceptible to corticosteroid-induced decreases in bone mineral density and resultant fractures. Detrimental effects on bone metabolism, such as osteoporosis, are a risk with chronic, systemically-administered corticosteroids.[60760] [60761] [64165] According to the Beers Criteria, systemic corticosteroids are considered potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) for geriatric adults with delirium or at high risk for delirium; avoid in these patient populations due to the possibility of new-onset delirium or exacerbation of the current condition. Oral and parenteral corticosteroids may be required for conditions, such as exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but should be prescribed in the lowest effective dose and for the shortest possible duration.[63923]\n\nSome commercially available formulations of dexamethasone injection or ophthalmic solution may contain sulfites; some parenteral products also contain benzyl alcohol. Sulfites and benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reactions in some people. They should be used with caution in patients with known sulfite hypersensitivity or benzyl alcohol hypersensitivity. Patients who have asthma are more likely to experience a sulfite sensitivity reaction than non-asthmatic patients.[54348] [60760]\n\nDexamethasone ophthalmic solutions are sometimes used off-label in the ear for otic conditions. Otic dexamethasone use is contraindicated for use in patients with tympanic membrane perforation.[54348]\n\nKaposi's sarcoma has been reported to occur in individuals during systemic corticosteroid therapy, such as systemic dexamethasone, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement of Kaposi's sarcoma.[60760] [60761] [64165]"
