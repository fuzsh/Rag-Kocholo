You received this Proxy Statement/Circular because you owned Common Shares at the close of business on Wednesday, April 17, 2019 (the \"Record Date\"), and that entitles you to vote at the Meeting. This Proxy Statement/Circular contains important information about the matters to be voted on at the Meeting and about Arbutus. As many of our Shareholders may be unable to attend the Meeting in person, proxies are solicited to give each Shareholder an opportunity to vote on all matters that will properly come before the Meeting. References in this Proxy Statement/Circular to the Meeting include any adjournments or postponements of the Meeting.\n\nWhat is included in the Proxy Statement/Circular?\n\nThe proxy materials include:\n\n\n\nthe Notice of 2019 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders and Proxy Statement/Circular;\n\n\n\nour 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders, which consists of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the \"Annual Report\") that accompanies these materials; and\n\n\n\na proxy or voting instruction card that accompanies these materials.\n\nWhat information is contained in this Proxy Statement/Circular and Arbutus' Annual Report?\n\nThe information in this Proxy Statement/Circular relates to the proposals to be voted on at the Meeting, the voting process, the compensation of our directors and certain of our executive officers, corporate governance matters, and certain other required information.

We will also consider any other business that is properly brought before the Meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. See \"What happens if additional matters are presented at the Meeting?\" below.\n\nHow does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?\n\nOur Board of Directors recommends that each Common Shareholder vote their Common Shares as follows:\n\nWhat happens if additional matters are presented at the Meeting?\n\nOther than the two items of business described in this Proxy Statement/Circular, we are not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the Meeting. If you grant a proxy, the persons named as proxy holders, Mark J. Murray, Ph.D. and Elizabeth Howard, Ph.D., J.D., or either of them, will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the Meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. If, for any reason, any of the director nominees is not available as a candidate for director, the persons named as proxy holders will vote your proxy for such other candidate or candidates as may be nominated by our Board of Directors.\n\nHow many votes do I have?\n\nOnly holders of Common Shares as of the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to receive notice of and vote on matters to be presented at the Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, in the manner and subject to the procedures described in this Proxy Statement/Circular and the accompanying proxy card.\n\nAt the close of business on the Record Date, 56,850,172 Common Shares of Arbutus were issued and outstanding. Each Common Shareholder is entitled to one vote per Common Share held on all matters to come before the Meeting. The Company's preferred shares are non-voting. Common Shares are the only securities of the Company that will have voting rights at the Meeting. Cumulative voting for directors is not permitted.\n\nHow do I vote?\n\nThe voting process is different depending on whether you are a registered or beneficial Shareholder:\n\n\n\nYou are a registered Shareholder if your Common Shares are registered in your name;\n\n2\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\nYou are a beneficial Shareholder if your shares are held on your behalf by an Intermediary (as defined below). This means the shares are registered in your Intermediary's name, and you are the beneficial owner.\n\n\n\n\"Intermediaries\" refers to brokers, investment firms, clearing houses and similar entities that own securities on behalf of Beneficial Shareholders.\n\nHow can I vote if I am a registered Shareholder?\n\nIf you are a registered Shareholder, you may vote in person at the Meeting or by proxy whether or not you attend the Meeting in person.\n\n\n\nTo vote over the Internet, go to www.astvotemyproxy.com and follow the online voting instructions and refer to your holder account number and control number provided on the enclosed proxy card. Internet voting is available 24 hours a day.\n\n\n\nTo vote in person at the Meeting, please come to the Meeting with personal identification and proof of ownership and we will give you an attendance card when you arrive.\n\n\n\nTo vote by mail, you must request a paper copy of the proxy materials with an enclosed proxy card; please promptly complete, sign and return your proxy card to our transfer agent ensure that it is received prior to the closing of the polls at the Meeting: AST Trust Company (Canada): PO Box 721, Agincourt, ON M1S 0A1 (mail) or 1600-1066 West Hastings St., Vancouver, BC, V6E 3X1.\n\n\n\nTo vote by telephone, call 1-888-489-5760 (toll free in North America) and follow the instructions and refer to your holder account number and control number provided on the proxy card.\n\n\n\nTo vote by facsimile, fax your completed and signed proxy card to 1-866-781-3111 (toll free in North America) or 1-416-368-2502.\n\n\n\nTo vote by email, send your completed and signed proxy card to proxyvote@astfinancial.com.\n\nIn each case, the vote must be submitted no later than 24 hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) prior to the time of the Meeting, or adjournment thereof. The chair of the Meeting may waive the proxy cut-off without notice. If the proxy is not dated, it will be deemed to be submitted seven calendar days after the date on which it was mailed to you.\n\nHow can I vote if I am a beneficial Shareholder?\n\nThe following information is of significant importance to Shareholders who do not hold Common Shares in their own name. Beneficial Shareholders should note that in order to vote in person at the Meeting, you must request in writing that your Intermediary send you a legal proxy which would enable you to attend the Meeting and vote your Common Shares.\n\nIf your Common Shares are listed in an account statement provided to you by an Intermediary, then in almost all cases your Common Shares will not be registered in your name on the records of Arbutus. In such circumstances your Common Shares will likely be registered under the name of your Intermediary or an agent of your Intermediary. In the United States, the vast majority of such Common Shares of Arbutus are registered under the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for The Depository Trust Company (which acts as depositary for many U.S. brokerage firms and custodian banks), and in Canada, under the name of CDS & Co. (the registration name for CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc., which acts as nominee for many Canadian brokerage firms).\n\nIntermediaries are required to seek voting instructions from beneficial Shareholders in advance of Shareholders' meetings. Every Intermediary has its own mailing procedures and provides its own return instructions to clients.\n\n3\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Proxy Statement/Circular is being sent to both registered Shareholders and beneficial Shareholders. There are two kinds of beneficial Shareholdersthose who object to their names being made known to the issuers of securities which they own (called OBOs for Objecting Beneficial Owners), and those who do not object (called NOBOs for Non-Objecting Beneficial Owners).\n\nArbutus is taking advantage of National Instrument 54-101Communications with Beneficial Owners of Securities of a Reporting Issuer, which permits it to deliver proxy-related materials indirectly to its NOBOs and OBOs. As a result, if you are a NOBO or OBO you can expect to receive Meeting materials from your Intermediary via Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (\"Broadridge\"), including a voting information form (\"VIF\"). If you receive a VIF, you should follow the instructions in the VIF to ensure that your Common Shares are voted at the Meeting. The VIF or form of proxy will name the same individuals as Arbutus' proxy to represent you at the Meeting. You have the right to appoint a person (who need not be a Shareholder of Arbutus) other than the individuals designated in the VIF, to represent you at the Meeting. To exercise this right, you should insert the name of your desired representative in the blank space provided in the VIF. The completed VIF must then be returned in accordance with the instructions in the VIF. Broadridge then tabulates the results of all instructions received and completed in accordance with the instructions provided in the VIF and provides appropriate instructions respecting the voting of Common Shares to be represented at the Meeting. If you receive a VIF from Broadridge, you cannot use it to vote Common Shares directly at the Meetingthe VIF must be completed and returned in accordance with its instructions, and by the deadline prescribed in the instructions, in order to have your Common Shares voted.\n\nAlthough as a beneficial Shareholder you may not be recognized directly at the Meeting for the purposes of voting Common Shares registered in the name of your Intermediary, you, or a person designated by you, may attend at the Meeting as proxyholder for your Intermediary and vote your Common Shares in that capacity. If you wish to attend the Meeting and indirectly vote your Common Shares as proxyholder for your Intermediary, or to have a person designated by you do so, you should enter your own name, or the name of the person you wish to designate, in the blank space on the VIF provided to you and return the same in accordance with the deadlines and instructions provided in the VIF, well in advance of the Meeting.\n\nThese proxy materials are being sent to both registered and beneficial Shareholders. If you are a beneficial Shareholder, and Arbutus or its agent has sent these materials to you, your name and address and information about your holdings of Common Shares have been obtained in accordance with applicable securities regulatory requirements from the Intermediary holding on your behalf.\n\nHow can I vote if I am a corporate Shareholder?\n\nIn order to be entitled to vote or to have its shares voted at the Meeting, a Shareholder that is a corporation (a \"Corporate Shareholder\") must either (a) attach a certified copy of the directors' resolution authorizing a representative to attend the Meeting on the Corporate Shareholder's behalf, or (b) attach a certified copy of the directors' resolution authorizing the completion and delivery of the proxy.\n\nCan I change my vote or revoke my proxy?\n\nIn addition to revocation in any other manner permitted by law, if you are a registered Shareholder and you wish to revoke your proxy, you may do so by depositing a written instrument to that effect and delivering it to AST Trust Company (Canada) PO Box 721, Agincourt, ON M1S 0A1, or by hand to 1600-1066 West Hastings St., Vancouver, BC V6E 3X1 (hand delivery) or to the address of the registered office of Arbutus at Farris, Vaughan, Wills & Murphy LLP, 25th Floor, 700 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V7Y 1B3, attention R. Hector MacKay-Dunn, Q.C., at any time up to and including the last business day preceding the day of the Meeting, or any adjournment\n\n4\n\nTable of Contents\n\nthereof, or to the Chairman of the Meeting on the day of the Meeting before any vote in respect of which the proxy has been given has been taken.\n\nIf you are a registered Shareholder and you wish to revoke your proxy by providing a written instrument to such effect, such written instrument must be executed in writing by you or your legal personal representative or trustee in bankruptcy, or, if you are a corporation that is a registered Shareholder, by the corporation or a representative of the corporation appointed in accordance with the Articles of Arbutus.\n\nBeneficial Shareholders who wish to change their vote must, in sufficient time in advance of the Meeting, arrange for their Intermediaries to change the vote and, if necessary, revoke their proxy.\n\nNote that for both registered and beneficial Shareholders, attendance at the Meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy or voting instructions to be revoked unless you specifically so request or vote in person at the Meeting.\n\nIs my vote confidential?\n\nProxy instructions, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify individual Shareholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Your vote will not be disclosed either within our Company or to third parties, except: (1) as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements, (2) to allow for the tabulation of votes and certification of the vote, and (3) to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation.\n\nWhat is a \"broker non-vote\"?\n\nIf you are a beneficial Shareholder of Common Shares held by an Intermediary and you do not provide your Intermediary with voting instructions, your shares may constitute \"broker non-votes\". Broker non-votes occur on a matter when the Intermediary or other nominee is not permitted under applicable stock exchange rules to vote on that matter without instructions from the beneficial Shareholder and instructions are not given. These matters are referred to as \"non-routine\" matters.\n\nProposal No. 1 is considered a non-routine matter, while Proposal No. 2 to approve the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 is considered a \"routine\" matter. Therefore, if you are a beneficial Shareholder of Common Shares held in the name of an Intermediary and do not provide voting instructions, your shares will not be voted on Proposal No. 1 and a broker non-vote will occur on this matter. In tabulating the voting result for any particular proposal, Common Shares that constitute broker non-votes are not considered voting power present with respect to that proposal. Thus, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of any matter being voted on at the Meeting, assuming that a quorum is obtained. Because Proposal No. 2 is a \"routine\" matter, an Intermediary will be permitted to exercise its discretion on this proposal, which means there will be no broker non-votes on this matter.\n\nHow many shares must be present or represented to conduct business at the Meeting?\n\nTo transact business at the Meeting, a quorum of Common Shares must be present either in person or by proxy. Under the Company's Articles, as amended, a quorum for the transaction of business at the Meeting is at least two people who are, or who represent by proxy, one or more Shareholders who, in the aggregate, hold at least 33 1/3% of the issued Common Shares entitled to be voted at the Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum at the Meeting. If a quorum is not present, the Meeting will be adjourned until a quorum is obtained.\n\n5\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat vote is required in order to approve each proposal?\n\n\n\nProposal No. 1: Election of Directors. Votes may be cast: FOR a particular nominee or WITHOLD with respect to a particular nominee. Under Arbutus' majority voting policy each director nominee must receive more \"FOR\" votes than \"WITHHOLD\" votes in order for their appointment to be immediately approved. In an uncontested election, any nominee who receives a greater number of \"WITHHOLD\" votes from his or her election than votes \"FOR\" such election is required to tender his or her resignation to our Board of Directors promptly following the vote. The Board of Directors (excluding any director that has tendered a resignation) will consider the director's offer to resign and decide whether or not to accept it within 90 days of receiving the final voting results of the Meeting. Arbutus' majority voting policy is more fully described below under \"Statement on Corporate GovernanceDirector Election and Majority Voting Policy\". Broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal.\n\n\n\nProposal No. 2: Approval of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Votes may be cast: FOR, WITHHOLD or ABSTAIN. The approval of this Proposal No. 2 requires a majority of the votes cast at the Meeting. For purposes of determining the number of votes cast, only the Common Shares voting \"FOR\" or \"WITHHOLD\" are counted. As such, abstentions are not treated as votes cast and are not counted in the determination of the outcome of this Proposal No. 2. Abstentions will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Meeting. Broker non-votes will not occur in connection with this proposal because Intermediaries have discretionary voting authority to vote shares on the approval of independent registered public accounting firms under stock exchange rules without specific instructions from the Beneficial Shareholders.\n\nWhat is the effect if I do not cast my vote?\n\nIf a Registered Shareholder does not cast its vote by proxy or in any other permitted fashion, no votes will be cast on its behalf on any of the items of business at the Meeting. If a Beneficial Shareholder does not instruct its Intermediary on how to vote on any of the items of business at the Meeting, the Intermediary has discretionary authority to vote the Beneficial Shareholder's shares on Proposal No. 2, but the Intermediary does not have discretionary authority to vote the Beneficial Shareholder's shares on Proposal No. 1 or any unusual item, so a \"broker non-vote\" will be recorded with respect to such item. Broker non-votes will be treated as not entitled to vote on any such matter and will not be counted as having been voted in respect of any such matter. Common Shares represented by such broker \"non-votes\" will, however, be counted in determining whether there is a quorum for the Meeting. Thus, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of any matter being voted on at the Meeting, assuming that a quorum is obtained. Because Proposal No. 2 is a \"routine\" matter, an Intermediary or other nominee will be permitted to exercise its discretion on this proposal, which means there will be no broker non-votes on this matter. If you have further questions on this issue, please contact your Intermediary or Arbutus (as provided below).\n\nHow will proxies be exercised?\n\nThe Common Shares represented by proxy will be voted or withheld from voting in accordance with your instructions. With respect to any amendments or variations in any of the Proposals, or any other matters which may properly come before the Meeting, the Common Shares will be voted by a proxyholder in his or her sole discretion.\n\nWhere you submit a proxy card but do not specify a vote on a Proposal shown in the Proxy Statement/Circular, a nominee of management acting as proxyholder will vote the Common Shares as if you had specified a vote \"FOR\" the Proposal.\n\n6\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?\n\nThis means that you own Common Shares that are registered under different accounts. For example, you may own some Common Shares directly as a Registered Shareholder and other Common Shares as a Beneficial Shareholder through an Intermediary, or you may own Common Shares through more than one such organization. In these situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials. It is necessary for you to complete and return all proxy cards and VIFs in order to vote all of the Common Shares you own. Please make sure you return each proxy card or VIF in the accompanying return envelope. You may also vote by Internet, telephone, facsimile or email by following the instructions on your proxy materials.\n\nHow do I appoint a proxyholder?\n\nThe individuals named in the proxy card are directors or officers of Arbutus. If you are a Shareholder entitled to vote at the Meeting, you have the right to appoint a person or company other than the designees of management named in the proxy card, who need not be a Shareholder, to vote according to your instructions. To appoint someone other than the designees of management named, please insert your appointed proxyholder's name in the space provided in the proxy card, sign and date and return the proxy card in accordance with the instructions set out in the proxy card.\n\nThe only methods by which you may appoint a person as proxyholder are by submitting a proxy card by mail, hand delivery or fax.\n\nHow will proxies be solicited and who will pay the cost of the proxy solicitation?\n\nThe solicitation of proxies will be primarily by mail, but Arbutus' directors, officers and regular employees may also solicit proxies personally or by telephone. We will not pay our directors, officers or employees any additional compensation for these services.

Our Board of Directors has a formal mandate, the text of which is attached to this Proxy Statement/Circular as Exhibit A.\n\nOur Board of Directors is currently composed of seven directors, and Shareholders are being asked at the Meeting to re-elect each of these seven directors to an additional one-year term.\n\nIndependent directors (according to the applicable standards of the SEC, Nasdaq and the rules and regulations of the Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities) are as follows: Dr. Torti, Mr. Burgess, Mr. Henriques, Dr. Manchester, Ms. Potter, and Mr. Meyers. In connection with its assessment, our Board of Directors considered (i) each director's beneficial ownership of our Common Shares reported in the \"Stock Ownership of Directors, Officers and Principal Shareholders\" section of this Proxy Statement/Circular, (ii) the agreements and transactions reported in the \"Related Party Transactions\" section of this Proxy Statement/Circular, (iii) with respect to Drs. Torti and Manchester and Ms. Potter, their affiliation with certain beneficial owners of more than 5% of our Common Shares (please refer to the biographies of the current directors in the \"Executive Officers and Directors\" section of this Proxy Statement/Circular for details regarding the affiliation of Drs. Torti and Manchester and Ms. Potter with Roivant) and their original election and/or nomination to our Board of Directors on behalf of such Shareholders. Our Board of Directors has also determined that each member of our Audit Committee, Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee meets the independence requirements applicable to those committees as prescribed by applicable rules and regulations of Nasdaq and the SEC.\n\nMr. Murray, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is not independent as a result of being an officer of Arbutus. Further information on our directors is set out in the biography of each director under the heading \"Executive Officers and Directors\". Each biography also outlines the director's relevant experience and expertise.\n\nBoard Leadership\n\nOur entire Board of Directors is responsible for the overall governance of Arbutus. Our Chairman, Dr. Torti, is independent of management. At this time, our Board of Directors believes that separation of the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer reinforces the independence of our Board of Directors from management, creates an environment that encourages objective oversight of management's performance and enhances the effectiveness of our Board of Directors as a whole.\n\n17\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRisk Assessment\n\nOne of the key functions of our Board of Directors is informed oversight of our enterprise risk management process. The Board of Directors does not have a standing risk management committee, but directly oversees risk management, as well as through various standing committees that address risks inherent in their respective areas of oversight. In particular, our Board of Directors is responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure, and our Audit Committee has the responsibility to consider and discuss our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management has taken to monitor and control these exposures, including guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken. The Audit Committee also monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee monitors the effectiveness of our corporate governance practices. Our Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the \"Compensation Committee\") assesses and monitors whether any of our compensation policies and practices have the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking, and whether our compensation policies and practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.\n\nCEO Evaluation\n\nIn reviewing and recommending the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, our Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee reviews and approves the corporate goals and objectives of our company relevant thereto, and evaluates the Chief Executive Officer's performance in light of those corporate goals and objectives and makes a recommendation to the Board of Directors regarding the Chief Executive Officer's compensation based on, in part, such evaluation. Our Board of Directors then reviews and approves the corporate objectives that our Chief Executive Officer is responsible for meeting and such corporate objectives form a key reference point for the annual review and assessment of our Chief Executive Officer's performance, which is performed by the independent directors on our Board of Directors.\n\nDirector Orientation and Continuing Education\n\nNew Board members receive a director's orientation including reports on our strategic plans and our significant financial, accounting and risk management issues. In addition, the orientation for our directors involves meeting with our senior management and an interactive introductory discussion about Arbutus, providing the directors with an opportunity to ask questions.\n\nBoard meetings are periodically held at our facilities and combined with presentations by our senior management to give the directors additional insight into the main areas of our business.\n\nDirector Nominations\n\nOur Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has the primary responsibility for establishing criteria for Board membership and identifying, evaluating, reviewing and recommending qualified candidates to serve on our Board of Directors.\n\nAll nominations proposed by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee must receive the approval of our Board of Directors. Prior to recommending candidates to serve on our Board of Directors, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee:\n\n(a)\n\nconsiders what competencies and skills our Board of Directors, as a whole, should possess. In doing so, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee recognizes that the particular competencies and skills required for one company may not be the same as those required for another;\n\n18\n\nTable of Contents\n\n(b)\n\nassesses what competencies and skills each existing Board member possesses, considering that no one director is likely to have all the competencies and skills required by our Board of Directors, rather, each individual makes their own contribution. Attention shall also be paid to the personality and other qualities of each director, as they may ultimately determine the Board dynamic; and\n\n(c)\n\nassesses what competencies and skills each nominee will bring to our Board of Directors and whether such nominee can devote sufficient time and resources to his or her duties as a Board member.\n\nThe Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider and evaluate Shareholder-recommended candidates using the same criteria as for other candidates. If the committee decides the candidate is suitable for Board membership, the committee will recommend the candidate to our Board of Directors, which approves the slate of director nominees for election by Shareholders. During fiscal 2018, we received no director recommendations from our Shareholders other than pursuant to the Governance Agreement with Roivant.\n\nShareholders who wish to suggest a director candidate may submit a written recommendation to Attention: Corporate Secretary, 701 Veterans Circle, Warminster, Pennsylvania 18974, along with the following information:\n\n\n\nas to each person whom the Shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director: (A) the name, age, business address and residential address of the person; (B) the principal occupation or employment of the person, and the principal occupation or employment of the person for the past five years; (C) the citizenship of such person; (D) the class or series and number of shares in the capital of the Company which are controlled or which are owned beneficially or of record by the person as of the record date for the meeting of Shareholders (if such date shall then have been made publicly available and shall have occurred) and as of the date of such notice; and (E) any other information relating to the person that would be required to be disclosed in a dissident's proxy circular in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to the BCBCA and the applicable securities laws of Canada; and\n\n\n\nas to the nominating Shareholder giving the notice, full particulars regarding any proxy, contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding pursuant to which such nominating Shareholder has a right to vote or direct the voting of any shares of the Company and any other information relating to such nominating Shareholder that would be required to be made in a dissident's proxy circular in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to the BCBCA and the applicable securities laws of Canada.\n\nThe Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Company to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Company or that could be material to a reasonable Shareholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such proposed nominee. Shareholders wishing to propose a director candidate must also comply with the advance notice deadlines found in Section 13.9 of the Company's Articles, and more fully described above under \"How can I make a Shareholder proposal for the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.\"\n\nIn addition to suggesting a director candidate, a Shareholder may also nominate a director candidate for election. A Shareholder wishing to nominate an individual to be a director, other than pursuant to a requisition of a meeting made pursuant to the BCBCA, is required to comply with Section 13.9 of the Articles. Section 13.9 of the Articles provides, inter alia, that proper written notice of any such director nomination (the \"Nomination Notice\") for an annual general meeting of Shareholders must be provided to the Secretary of the Company not less than 30 nor more than 65 days prior to the date of the annual general meeting of Shareholders; provided, however, that in the\n\n19\n\nTable of Contents\n\nevent that the annual general meeting of Shareholders is to be held on a date that is less than 50 days after the date (the \"Notice Date\") on which the first public announcement of the date of the annual general meeting was made, the Nomination Notice must be provided no later than the close of business on the tenth day following the Notice Date. The foregoing is merely a summary of provisions contained in Section 13.9 of the Articles, and is not comprehensive and is qualified by the full text of such provisions. The full text of such provisions is set out in Section 13.9 of the Articles, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 3.1 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which can be found under the Company's profile at www.sedar.com or www.sec.gov.\n\nDirector Election and Majority Voting Policy\n\nThe Board of Directors believes that each of its members should carry the confidence and support of the Company's Shareholders. To this end, the Articles of Arbutus allow for a majority voting policy. The Company's Shareholders originally approved the majority voting policy in 2013 and it was subsequently amended in March 2018. In an uncontested election of directors, Shareholders may vote in favor of, or withhold their vote from, each nominee director. If, with respect to any particular nominee, the number of votes withheld for a particular nominee exceeds the number of votes in favor of the nominee, then for purposes of the Company's policy, the nominee shall be considered not to have received the support of the Shareholders, even though duly elected as a matter of corporate law.\n\nA person elected as a director who is considered under this test not to have the confidence of Shareholders is expected to immediately submit to our Board of Directors his or her resignation in accordance with the Company's Majority Voting Policy. Our Board of Directors (excluding any director that has tendered a resignation) will consider the director's offer to resign and decide whether or not to accept it. In making its decision, the Board of Directors will consider all factors deemed relevant by the members of the committee and our Board of Directors, including:\n\n\n\nthe recommendation of our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee;\n\n\n\nthe stated reasons why Shareholders withheld votes from the election of the resigning director;\n\n\n\nthe length of service and the qualifications of the resigning director;\n\n\n\nthe resigning director's contributions to the Company; and\n\n\n\nthe effect that such resignation(s) may have on our Board of Directors' ability to (i) effectively continue fulfilling its responsibility for the stewardship of the Company and the enhancement of shareholder value; and (ii) the Company's ability to comply with any applicable governance rules and policies.\n\nWithin 90 days following the applicable meeting of Shareholders, our Board of Directors will, upon recommendation of our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the other factors set forth above, decide whether to accept or not accept the resignation of that director. Following our Board of Directors' decision on the resignation, our Board of Directors will promptly disclose, via press release, its decision whether to accept the resigning director's resignation offer including the reasons for rejecting the resignation offer, if applicable. If a resignation is accepted, our Board of Directors may in accordance with the provisions of the Articles and the BCBCA appoint a new director to fill any vacancy created by the resignation, reduce the size of our Board of Directors, leave any vacancy open until the next annual general meeting of Shareholders of the Company, call a special meeting of Shareholders at which there will be presented nominees to fill any vacancies, or any combination of the above. The Company's Majority Voting Policy is available on the Company's website at www.arbutusbio.com.\n\n20\n\nTable of Contents\n\nDirector Terms\n\nDirectors are elected annually. Unless the director's office is earlier vacated in accordance with the provisions of the BCBCA and the Articles of Arbutus, each director elected will hold office until immediately before the election of new directors at the next annual general meeting of Arbutus or, if no director is then elected, until a successor is elected or appointed.\n\nDirector Term Limits\n\nOur Board of Directors has not adopted term limits for our directors. In terms of mechanisms for Board renewal, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has the mandate and responsibility to annually review, discuss and assess the performance of our Board of Directors. This assessment includes an evaluation of: our Board of Directors' contribution as a whole and effectiveness in serving the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders; specific areas in which our Board of Directors and/or management believe contributions could be improved; the appropriate size of our Board of Directors, with a view to facilitating effective decision making; and overall Board composition and makeup. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee also has the primary responsibility for evaluating, reviewing and considering the recommendation for nomination of new candidates to our Board of Directors as well as incumbent directors for re-election to our Board of Directors.\n\nDiversity\n\nThe Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has the primary responsibility for establishing criteria for Board membership and identifying, evaluating, reviewing and recommending qualified candidates to serve on our Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors' Mandate, and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's Charter, do not specifically contemplate diversity or the level of representation of women on our Board of Directors in identifying and nominating candidates for election or re-election to our Board of Directors. However, prior to recommending candidates to serve on our Board of Directors, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee shall:\n\n(a)\n\nconsider what competencies and skills our Board of Directors, as a whole, should possess. In doing so, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee recognizes that the particular competencies and skills required for one company may not be the same as those required for another;\n\n(b)\n\nassess what competencies and skills each existing Board member possesses, considering that no one director is likely to have all the competencies and skills required by our Board of Directors; rather, each individual makes their own contribution. Attention shall also be paid to the personality and other qualities of each director, as they may ultimately determine the Board dynamic; and\n\n(c)\n\nassess what competencies and skills each nominee will bring to our Board of Directors and whether such nominee can devote sufficient time and resources to his or her duties as a Board member.\n\nThe Board of Directors' Mandate does not specifically contemplate the level of representation of women in executive officer positions when making executive officer appointments. However, our Board of Directors' Mandate does stipulate that our Board of Directors is responsible for evaluating the integrity of the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers, and direct the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers to promote a culture of integrity throughout the Company.\n\n21\n\nTable of Contents\n\nArbutus has not adopted a target regarding women on its Board of Directors. As at the date hereof, Arbutus has one woman on its Board of Directors (14%). Arbutus has not adopted a target regarding women in executive officer positions.
