M., & Irwin, R. E. (2020). Flowering plant composition shapes pathogen infection intensity and reproduction in bumble bee colonies. In Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (Vol. 117, Issue 21, pp. 11559–11565). Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2000074117\n\nPathogens pose significant threats to pollinator health and food security. Pollinators can transmit diseases during foraging, but the consequences of plant species composition for infection is unknown. In agroecosystems, flowering strips or hedgerows are often used to augment pollinator habitat. We used canola as a focal crop in tents, and manipulated flowering strip composition using plant species we had previously shown to result in higher or lower bee infection in short-term trials. We also manipulated initial colony infection to assess impacts on foraging behavior. Flowering strips using high-infection plant species nearly doubled bumble bee colony infection intensity compared to low-infection plant species, with intermediate infection in canola-only tents. Both infection treatment and flowering strips reduced visits to canola, but we saw no evidence that infection treatment shifted foraging preferences. Although high-infection flowering strips increased colony infection intensity, colony reproduction was improved with any flowering strips compared to canola alone. The effects of flowering strips on colony reproduction were explained by nectar availability, but the effects of flowering strips on infection intensity were not. Thus, flowering strips benefited colony reproduction by adding floral resources, but certain plant species also come with a risk of increased pathogen infection intensity.\n\nRead more about Lynn Adler.\n\nMargaret A.

Evaluation of the Potential of Colicins to Prevent Extraluminal Contamination of Urinary Catheters by Escherichia Coli. International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, (54)5, 619-625. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924857919301840?...\n\nThe feasibility of using colicins to create an antimicrobial lubricant to prevent extraluminal catheter contamination during urinary catheter insertion was assessed. Levels of resistance of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to antibiotics and colicins were compared. The results showed that antibiotics and colicins possess similar frequencies of resistance to a single drug, whereas colicins exhibit significantly lower levels of multidrug resistance (22%) than antibiotics (42%). Colicins and antibiotics showed complementary inhibitory activity, with each targeting different subsets of pathogenic isolates. The collateral impact of these two antimicrobials on genera that are members of the fecal/vaginal/urinary microbiome was assessed, with colicins showing significantly less collateral damage than antibiotics. Using a novel colicin, SR4, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for a panel of 30 uropathogenic isolates were determined and showed that SR4 achieved the same antimicrobial efficacy as gentamicin using 20-30% less drug. An SR4-impregnated catheter lubricant was created and its ability to prevent extraluminal urinary catheter contamination in vitro was demonstrated. These data indicate that a colicin-impregnated lubricant may provide a viable prophylactic option for preventing catheter-associated urinary tract infections.\n\nRead more about Margaret A.

L., Nonnenmann, S. S., & Lovley, D. R. (2019). Decorating the Outer Surface of Microbially Produced Protein Nanowires with Peptides. ACS Synthetic Biology, 8(8), 1809–1817. https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00131\n\nThe potential applications of electrically conductive protein nanowires (e-PNs) harvested from Geobacter sulf urreducens might be greatly expanded if the outer surface of the wires could be modified to confer novel sensing capabilities or to enhance binding to other materials. We developed a simple strategy for functionalizing e-PNs with surface-exposed peptides. The G. sulf urreducens gene for the monomer that assembles into e-PNs was modified to add peptide tags at the carboxyl terminus of the monomer. Strains of G. sulf urreducens were constructed that fabricated synthetic e-PNs with a six-histidine “His-tag” or both the His-tag and a nine-peptide “HA-tag” exposed on the outer surface. Addition of the peptide tags did not diminish e-PN conductivity. The abundance of HA-tag in e-PNs was controlled by placing expression of the gene for the synthetic monomer with the HA-tag under transcriptional regulation. These studies suggest broad possibilities for tailoring e-PN properties for diverse applications.\n\nRead more about Dr. Derek R.

Templated Self-Assembly of a Covalent Polymer Network for Intracellular Protein Delivery and Traceless Release. Journal of the American Chemical Society, 139(16), 5676–5679. https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b01214\n\nProtein-based drugs have great potential for improving our ability to treat disease. In comparison to current drugs that are based on small molecules, drugs composed of proteins are more effective for addressing specific genetic deficiencies without undesirable side effects. However, there are major challenges in delivering proteins into and within a cell. These challenges are related to keeping the protein stable, avoiding unwanted immune system response, and translocating the protein across the cellular membrane.\n\nThis study presents a novel and practical strategy which simultaneously overcomes all of these challenges. In this strategy, the polymers self-assemble to form a sheath around the protein, analogous to \"shrink-wrapping\" the protein. The polymer sheath encapsulates proteins, preserves their structure and function during delivery, and releases them when the assembly enters the cell cytosol. The polymers do not provoke an unwanted immune system response, and do not leaving any residue behind. This strategy is applicable to a broad range of proteins, and the sheath can be designed to release its cargo under various conditions. In addition to the applications for protein therapeutics and devices, the technology can be used to design reagents for basic biochemical research. Dr. Thayumanavan is currently working with industry partners toward both applications, in part through his start-up company, Cyta Therapeutics.\n\nRead more about S. \"Thai\" Thayumanavan.\n\nJeanne Hardy\n\nAssociate Professor, Department of Chemistry\n\n2018 Recipient\n\nDagbay, K. B., & Hardy, J. A. (2017). Multiple proteolytic events in caspase-6 self-activation impact conformations of discrete structural regions. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 114(38), E7977–E7986. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1704640114\n\nThe challenges wrought by Alzheimer's disease are increasing with the graying of society in the developed world. In the United States, Alzheimer's disease promises to be the single largest medical expense ($1.1 trillion annually) by 2050. Today, no suitable treatments for Alzheimer's disease exist. Associate Professor in Chemistry Jeanne Hardy has been working for more than a decade to understand an important protein involved in Alzheimer's disease, called caspase-6. Recently, Dr. Hardy made important discoveries that may significantly advance our ability to treat this increasingly relevant disease.\n\nPeople with Alzheimer's disease have tangles associated with the neurons of their brains. There is evidence that the caspase-6 protein is responsible for creating those tangles. Inhibiting caspase-6 could be one of the most promising approaches for treating Alzheimer's disease. In order to do this with a positive outcome, it is important not to inhibit any of the other 11 caspases. This is a major challenge, because all of the caspase proteins perform very similar reactions.\n\nDr. Hardy has risen to this challenge. In 2011, the Hardy lab found that one part of caspase-6 can fold into a helix, which no other caspase can do. However, caspase-6 does not maintain a helix shape all of the time, but constantly fluctuates between a helix and a three-strand shape. Last year, the Hardy lab used a state-of-the-art method to take snapshots of what parts of caspase-6 change shape and fluctuate over time. Insights from this study have allowed the Hardy Lab to develop new chemicals, targeting caspase-6 without affecting other caspases. This development represents a pivotal step forward toward treating Alzheimer's disease with caspase-6 inhibitors."
