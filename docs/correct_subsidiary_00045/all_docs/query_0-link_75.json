Exact Imaging’s ExactVu™ micro-ultrasound platform operates at 29 MHz and enables a whole new level of resolution - - a 300% improvement over conventional ultrasound and resolution superior to MRI - - with the benefits of ease of use, affordability, and being an extension of the current urological workflow. Using the Exact Imaging platform, urologists are able to visualize areas of interest in the prostate and specifically target biopsies at those areas in real time, aided by the PRI-MUS™ (prostate risk identification using micro-ultrasound) evidence-based micro-ultrasound protocol. For the minority of cases where MRI might assist (i.e., prior negative biopsies), FusionVu™ is the forthcoming micro-US/MRI fusion application operating on the ExactVu micro-ultrasound platform. The ExactVu micro-ultrasound system has received regulatory approval in the European Union (CE Mark), the United States (FDA 510(k)) and Canada (Health Canada medical device license).\n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nRob Sandler\n\nSVP, Marketing\n\nExact Imaging\n\nC. +1.416.274.8166\n\nE. rsandler@exactimaging.com\n\nAarthi Thaya\n\nSales & Marketing Coordinator\n\nExact Imaging\n\nP. +1.905.415.0030\n\nC. +1.647.402.9493\n\nE. athaya@exactimaging.com\n\nAbout Clinical Laserthermia Systems (CLS)\n\nClinical Laserthermia Systems (CLS) develops, markets and sells the TRANBERG®|Thermal Therapy System and disposable single-use material that is used during treatment procedures.
