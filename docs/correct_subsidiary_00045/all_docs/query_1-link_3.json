The purpose of the Annual Meeting is the following:\n\n1. to elect three directors, Steven M. Paul, M.D., Mark Levin, and Glenn Pierce, M.D., Ph.D., to serve as Class I directors until the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified, subject to their earlier death, resignation, or removal;\n\n2. to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019; and\n\n3. to transact such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting and at any adjournments or postponements thereof.\n\nThe proposal for the election of directors relates solely to the election of Class I directors nominated by our Board of Directors.\n\nOnly the Company’s stockholders of record at the close of business on April 18, 2019, will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting and any adjournments or postponements thereof.\n\nWe are pleased to take advantage of Securities and Exchange Commission rules that allow companies to furnish their proxy materials over the Internet. We are mailing to many of our stockholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, or Notice, instead of a paper copy of our proxy materials and our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10‑K. The Notice contains instructions on how to access those documents and to cast your vote via the Internet. The Notice also contains instructions on how to request a paper copy of our proxy materials and our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10‑K. All stockholders who do not receive a Notice will receive a paper copy of the proxy materials and the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10‑K by mail. This process allows us to provide our stockholders with the information they need on a more timely basis, while reducing the environmental impact and lowering the costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials. If your shares are held in street name (held for your account by a broker or other nominee), you will receive instructions from your broker or other holder of record that you must follow for your shares to be voted.\n\nYour vote is important. Whether or not you are able to attend the Annual Meeting in person, it is important that your shares be represented. To ensure that your vote is recorded promptly, please vote as soon as possible, even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, by submitting your proxy via the Internet at the address listed on the proxy card or by signing, dating and returning the proxy card.\n\nCambridge, Massachusetts\n\nApril 23, 2019\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n\n1\n\nOVERVIEW OF PROPOSALS\n\n4\n\nPROPOSAL 1 ELECTION OF DIRECTORS\n\n4\n\nPROPOSAL 2 RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS\n\n8\n\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT\n\n9\n\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n\n13\n\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n\n14\n\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION\n\n15\n\nSECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE\n\n15\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n15\n\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n\n22\n\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\n\n30\n\nHOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS\n\n32\n\nTRANSACTION OF OTHER BUSINESS\n\n32\n\nTable of Contents\n\nVOYAGER THERAPEUTICS, INC.\n\nPROXY STATEMENT\n\nFOR THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n\nOur Board of Directors, or the Board of Directors, has made this proxy statement, or this Proxy Statement, and related materials available to you on the Internet, or at your request has delivered printed versions to you by mail, in connection with the Board of Directors’ solicitation of proxies for our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, or the Annual Meeting, and any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting. If you requested printed versions of these materials by mail, they will also include a proxy card for the Annual Meeting.\n\nThe Annual Meeting is to be held on Thursday, June 13, 2019, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, at the Company’s offices at 64 Sidney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02139.\n\nPursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, we are providing access to our proxy materials over the Internet. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, or the Notice, to our stockholders of record and beneficial owners as of the record date identified below. The mailing of the Notice to our stockholders is scheduled to begin on or about April 23, 2019.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE INTERNET AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON JUNE 13, 2019:\n\nThis Proxy Statement, the accompanying proxy card or voting instruction card and our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10‑K are available at http://www.proxyvote.com.\n\nA copy of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10‑K as filed with the SEC, except for exhibits, will be furnished without charge to any stockholder upon written or oral request to Voyager Therapeutics, Inc., 75 Sidney Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, Attention: Matthew Osborne, Telephone: (857) 259-5340. This proxy statement and our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 are also available on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.\n\nIn this Proxy Statement, the terms “Voyager,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Voyager Therapeutics, Inc. The mailing address of our principal executive offices is Voyager Therapeutics, Inc., 75 Sidney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.\n\nEXPLANATORY NOTE\n\nWe are an “emerging growth company” and a “smaller reporting company” under applicable federal securities laws and therefore we are permitted to take advantage of certain reduced public company reporting requirements. As an emerging growth company, we provide in this Proxy Statement the scaled disclosure permitted under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, including the compensation disclosures required of a “smaller reporting company,” as that term is defined in Rule 12b‑2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we might still qualify as a smaller reporting company, which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are not required to conduct votes seeking approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers or the frequency with which such votes must be conducted. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) December 31, 2020; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.\n\nStockholders Entitled to Vote; Record Date\n\nAs of the close of business on April 18, 2019, the record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, there were outstanding 36,830,556 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, all of which are entitled to vote with respect to all matters to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. Each stockholder of record\n\n1\n\nTable of Contents\n\nis entitled to one vote for each share of our common stock held by such stockholder. None of our shares of undesignated preferred stock were outstanding as of April 18, 2019.\n\nQuorum; Abstentions; Broker Non‑Votes\n\nOur By‑laws provide that a majority of the shares entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, shares that are voted “abstain” or “withheld” are counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. Broker “non-votes” are also counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting if such uninstructed shares are entitled to vote on at least one item to be decided at the Annual Meeting.\n\nUnder our By‑laws, any proposal other than an election of directors is decided by a majority of the votes properly cast for and against such proposal, except where a larger vote is required by law or by our Certificate of Incorporation or By‑laws. Abstentions and broker “non‑votes” are not included in the tabulation of the voting results on any such proposal and, therefore, do not have the effect of votes in opposition to such proposals. A broker “non‑vote” occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner, or the nominee holding shares for the beneficial owner does not exercise its discretionary voting power. Any election of directors by the stockholders is decided by a plurality of the votes properly cast in such election.\n\nIf your shares are held in “street name” by a brokerage firm, your brokerage firm is required to vote your shares according to your instructions. If you do not give instructions to your brokerage firm, the brokerage firm will still be able to vote your shares with respect to certain routine, or “discretionary,” items, but will not be allowed to vote your shares with respect to non-routine, or “non‑discretionary,” items. Proposal 1 is a “non‑discretionary” item. If you do not instruct your broker how to vote with respect to this proposal, your broker may not vote for this proposal, and such vote will be counted as a broker “non‑vote.” Proposal 2 is considered to be a discretionary item, and your brokerage firm will be able to vote on this proposal even if it does not receive instructions from you.\n\nVoting\n\nIn Person\n\nIf you are a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. We will give you a ballot when you arrive. If you hold your shares through a bank or broker and wish to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from the firm that holds your shares and an account statement showing that you are the beneficial owner of the shares as of the record date. You may obtain directions to the location of the Annual Meeting by calling our offices at (857) 259-5340.\n\nBy Proxy\n\nIf you do not wish to vote in person or will not be attending the Annual Meeting, you may vote by proxy. You can vote by proxy over the Internet by following the instructions provided in the Notice, or, if you requested or otherwise received printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you can vote by mailing your proxy card as described in the proxy materials. You may also authorize another person or persons to act for you as a proxy in writing, signed by you or your authorized representative, specifying the details of those proxies’ authority. The original writing must be given to each of the named proxies, although it may be sent to them by electronic transmission if, from that transmission, it can be determined that the transmission was authorized by you. If you complete and submit your proxy before the Annual Meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote the shares represented by your proxy in accordance with your instructions. If you submit a proxy without giving voting instructions, your shares will be voted in the manner recommended by the Board of Directors on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement, and as the persons named as proxies may determine in their discretion with respect to any other matters properly presented at the Annual Meeting.\n\nIf any other matters are properly presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting, including, among other things, consideration of a motion to adjourn the Annual Meeting to another time or place (including, without limitation, for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies), the persons named in the enclosed proxy card and acting thereunder will have discretion to vote on those matters in accordance with their best judgment. We do not currently anticipate that any other matters will be raised at the Annual Meeting.\n\n2\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRevocability of Proxy\n\nYou may revoke your proxy by (i) following the instructions on the Notice and submitting a new proxy by mail or over the Internet before the Annual Meeting, or (ii) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person (although attendance at the Annual Meeting will not in and of itself revoke a proxy). Any written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy card must be received by our Secretary prior to the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting. Such written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy card should be hand delivered to our Secretary or sent to our principal executive offices at Voyager Therapeutics, Inc., 75 Sidney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, Attention: Secretary.\n\nIf a broker, bank, or other nominee holds your shares, you must contact such broker, bank, or nominee in order to find out how to change your vote.\n\nExpenses of Solicitation\n\nVoyager is making this solicitation and will pay the entire cost of preparing and distributing the Notice and these proxy materials and soliciting votes. If you choose to access the proxy materials or vote over the Internet, you are responsible for any Internet access charges that you may incur. Our officers and employees may, without compensation other than their regular compensation, solicit proxies through further mailings, personal conversations, facsimile transmissions, e‑mails, or otherwise. We have hired Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. to assist us in the distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of votes described above. Proxy solicitation expenses that we will pay include those for preparation, mailing, returning, and tabulating the proxies. We will pay Broadridge $8,400 for their services.\n\nProcedure for Submitting Stockholder Proposals\n\nStockholder proposals intended to be presented at the next annual meeting of our stockholders must satisfy the requirements set forth in the advance notice provision under our By‑laws. To be timely for our next annual meeting of stockholders, any such proposal must be delivered in writing to our Secretary at our principal executive offices not earlier than the close of business on February 14, 2020, which is the 120th day prior to the one-year anniversary of the Annual Meeting, and not later than the close of business on March 15, 2020, which is the 90th day prior to the one-year anniversary of the Annual Meeting. If the date of the next annual meeting of the stockholders is scheduled to take place before May 14, 2020, which is 30 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the Annual Meeting, or after August 12, 2020, which is 60 days after the one-year anniversary of the Annual Meeting, notice by the stockholder must be delivered no later than the close of business on the later of (1) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or (2) the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. Any nomination must include all information relating to the nominee that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in election contests or is otherwise required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, the person’s written consent to be named in the proxy statement and to serve as a director if elected and such information as we might reasonably require to determine the eligibility of the person to serve as a director. As to other business, the notice must include a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, and any material interest of such stockholder (and the beneficial owner) in the proposal. The proposal must be a proper subject for stockholder action. In addition, to make a nomination or proposal, the stockholder must be a holder of record at the time the notice is made and must provide certain information regarding itself (and the beneficial owner), including the name and address, as they appear on our books, of the stockholder proposing such business, the number of shares of our capital stock which are, directly or indirectly, owned beneficially or of record by the stockholder proposing such business or its affiliates or associates (as defined in Rule 12b‑2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) and certain additional information.\n\nIn addition, any stockholder proposal intended to be included in the proxy statement for the next annual meeting of our stockholders must also satisfy the SEC regulations under Rule 14a‑8 of the Exchange Act, and be received not later than December 25, 2019. If the date of the annual meeting is moved by more than 30 days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year’s proxy statement, then notice must be received within a reasonable time before we begin to print and send proxy materials. If that happens, we will publicly announce the deadline for submitting a proposal in a press release or in a document filed with the SEC.\n\n3\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOVERVIEW OF PROPOSALS\n\nThis Proxy Statement contains two proposals requiring stockholder action. Proposal 1 requests the election of three Class I Directors to the Board of Directors. Proposal 2 requests the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, or Ernst & Young, as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Each of the proposals is discussed in more detail in the pages that follow.\n\nPROPOSAL 1\n\nELECTION OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe Board of Directors is divided into three classes. One class is elected each year at the annual meeting of stockholders for a term of three years. Vacancies on the Board of Directors are filled exclusively by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum is present, and not by stockholders. A director elected by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy in a class shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of that class, and until the director’s successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation, or removal.\n\nThe terms of the Class I directors are scheduled to expire on the date of the upcoming Annual Meeting. Based on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board of Directors’ nominees for election by the stockholders are the current Class I members: Steven M. Paul, M.D., Mark Levin, and Glenn Pierce, M.D., Ph.D. If elected, each nominee will serve as a director until the annual meeting of stockholders in 2022 and until his successor is duly elected and qualified, or until his earlier death, resignation, or removal.\n\nThe names of and certain information about the directors in each of the three classes are set forth below. There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers.\n\nIt is intended that the proxy in the form presented will be voted, unless otherwise indicated, for the election of the Class I director nominees to the Board of Directors. If any of the nominees should for any reason be unable or unwilling to serve at any time prior to the Annual Meeting, the proxies will be voted for the election of such substitute nominee as the Board of Directors may designate.\n\nNominees for Class I Directors\n\nThe names of the nominees for Class I directors and certain information about each as of April 18, 2019 are set forth below.\n\nDirector\n\nName\n\nPositions and Offices Held with Voyager\n\nSince\n\nAge\n\nSteven M. Paul, M.D.\n\nDirector\n\n2014\n\n68\n\nMark Levin\n\nDirector\n\n2013\n\n68\n\nGlenn Pierce, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nDirector\n\n2017\n\n63\n\nSet forth below are the biographies of each director, as well as a discussion of the particular experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills that led our Board of Directors to conclude that each person nominated to serve or currently serving on our Board of Directors should serve as a director. In addition to the information presented below, we believe that each director nominee meets the minimum qualifications established by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The process of the Board of Directors and its committees to identify and evaluate candidates for director nominees, as well as the applicable minimum qualifications for director nominees, is described below under the heading “Corporate Governance – Board and Committee Matters.”\n\nNominees for Election for a Three‑Year Term Ending at the 2022 Annual Meeting\n\nSteven M.

Although he will continue to serve as a member of the Board of Directors, Mr. Levin will step down from his role as Chairman of the Board of Directors immediately following the Annual Meeting. Mr. Levin currently serves as a partner at Third Rock Ventures, LLC, which he co‑founded in 2007. Mr. Levin also formerly served on the Boards of Directors of privately held life sciences companies NinePoint Medical, Inc., Corvia Medical, Inc., Fulcrum Therapeutics, Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Warp Drive Bio, Inc., and on the Boards of Directors of publicly traded life sciences companies Eleven Biotherapeutics, Inc. from September 2008 to November 2014 and Foundation Medicine, Inc. from April 2010 to June 2014.

Mr. Levin started his career as a process engineer and project leader at Eli Lilly and Company and Genentech, Inc. Mr. Levin received both a B.S. and an M.S. in Chemical and Biochemical Engineering from Washington University. We believe Mr. Levin’s experience working with and serving on the Boards of Directors of life sciences companies and his experience working in the venture capital industry qualifies him to serve on the Board of Directors.\n\nGlenn Pierce, M.D., Ph.D. Dr. Pierce has been a member of the Board of Directors since January 2017. Dr. Pierce has served as Chief Medical Officer of Ambys Medicines, a biotechnology company, since August 2018.

We believe Dr. Pierce’s nearly 30 years of\n\n5\n\nTable of Contents\n\nexperience in leading biotechnology research and development in small and large, public and private biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies qualifies him to serve on our Board of Directors.\n\nDirectors Not Standing for Election or Re‑Election\n\nThe names of and certain information as of April 18, 2019 about the members of the Board of Directors who are not standing for election or re‑election at this year’s Annual Meeting are set forth below.\n\nDirector\n\nName\n\nPositions and Offices Held with Voyager\n\nSince\n\nAge\n\nG.

Dr. Hyman received a B.A. from Yale College, an M.A. from the University of Cambridge, which he attended as a Mellon fellow, and an M.D. from Harvard Medical School. We believe that Dr. Hyman’s extensive knowledge of neuroscience combined with his leadership skills qualifies him to serve as a member of the Board of Directors.\n\nJames A.

Any request for such a transaction must first be presented to our Audit Committee for review, consideration and approval. In approving or rejecting any such proposal, our Audit Committee is to consider the facts and circumstances available and deemed relevant to the Audit Committee, including, but not limited to, the extent of the related party’s interest in the transaction, and whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable to us than terms we could have generally obtained from an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances.\n\nCertain of the transactions described below were entered into prior to the adoption of this written policy but each such transaction was approved by our Board of Directors. Prior to our Board of Directors’ consideration of a transaction with a related person, the material facts as to the related person’s relationship or interest in the transaction were disclosed to our Board of Directors, and the transaction was not approved by our Board of Directors unless a majority of the directors approved the transaction.\n\nAgreements with Stockholders\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, we incurred consulting and management fees to Third Rock Ventures, LLC, or TRV, in the amount of approximately $55,000 and $18,000 respectively. TRV is a management company that is party to a services agreement with Third Rock Ventures III, L.P., the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our voting securities. Mr. Levin is a member of our Board of Directors and is a managing member of TRV III GP, LLC, which is the general partner of Third Rock Ventures III GP, L.P., the general partner of Third Rock Ventures III, L.P. and a managing member of TRV. These consulting fees were paid to TRV pursuant to invoices submitted by TRV in amounts mutually agreed upon in advance by us and TRV in consideration of certain strategic and ordinary course\n\n14\n\nTable of Contents\n\nbusiness operations consulting services provided to us on an as‑needed basis, from time to time and at our request, by individuals related to TRV, including Mr. Levin. None of these consulting fees were paid directly or indirectly to Mr. Levin. The consulting fees paid to TRV did not exceed 5% of the consolidated gross revenue of TRV during its 2017 or 2018 fiscal years. As of April 18, 2019, we have not incurred any such fees in 2019.\n\nExecutive Officer and Director Compensation\n\nSee “Executive Compensation” and “Director Compensation” for information regarding compensation of directors and executive officers.\n\nEmployment Agreements\n\nWe have entered into employment agreements or offer letters with our executive officers. For more information regarding our agreements with our named executive officers for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, see “Executive Compensation.”\n\nIndemnification Agreements\n\nWe have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers, the forms of which are attached as exhibits to our Annual Report filed on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The indemnification agreements and our Certificate of Incorporation and By‑laws require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\n\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION\n\nSince April 2017, Michael Higgins, Wendy Dixon, Ph.D., and Perry Karsen have served on our Compensation Committee, with Perry Karsen serving as chairman of the committee. None of the members of our Compensation Committee has at any time during the last three years been one of our officers or employees or had any relationship requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S‑K. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past fiscal year has served, as a member of the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee, or any other committee serving an equivalent function, of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee.\n\nSECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE\n\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers, directors, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our outstanding common stock, or collectively, Reporting Persons, to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership with the SEC. Reporting Persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on our review of such reports received or written representations from certain Reporting Persons during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we believe that all Reporting Persons complied with all Section 16(a) reporting requirements.\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nBoard and Committee Matters\n\nBoard Leadership and Independence. Our Board of Directors has determined that all members of the Board of Directors, except Dr. Paul and Mr. Turenne, are independent, as determined in accordance with the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. In making such independence determination, the Board of Directors considered the relationships that each such non‑employee director has with us and all other facts and circumstances that the Board of Directors deemed relevant in determining his or her independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non‑employee director. In considering the independence of the directors listed above, our Board of Directors considered the association of our directors with the holders of more than 5% of our common stock. There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers.\n\nThe positions of our Chairman of the Board of Directors, or Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer are presently separated. Separating these positions allows our Chief Executive Officer to focus on our day‑to‑day\n\n15\n\nTable of Contents\n\nbusiness, while allowing the Chairman of the Board to lead the Board of Directors in its fundamental role of providing advice to and independent oversight of management. Our Board of Directors recognizes the time, effort and energy that the Chief Executive Officer must devote to his position in the current business environment, as well as the commitment required to serve as the Chairman of the Board, particularly as the Board of Directors’ oversight responsibilities continue to grow. Our Board of Directors also believes that this structure ensures a greater role for the non‑management directors in the oversight of our company and active participation of the independent directors in setting agendas and establishing priorities and procedures for the work of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors believes its administration of its risk oversight function has not affected its leadership structure. Although our By‑laws do not require our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer positions to be separate, our Board of Directors believes that having separate positions is the appropriate leadership structure for us at this time. Immediately following the 2019 Annual Meeting, Mr. Levin will step down as, and Mr. Higgins will assume the role of, Chairman of the Board.\n\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our employees, officers and directors, including those officers responsible for financial reporting. The current version of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on our website at http://governance.vygr.com. A copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics may also be obtained, free of charge, upon a request directed to: Voyager Therapeutics, Inc., 75 Sidney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02139 Attention: Chief Financial Officer. We intend to disclose any amendment of a provision of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer, controller, or persons performing similar functions, or any waiver of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for such persons or any other of our officers, by posting such information on our website at vygr.com and/or in our public filings with the SEC.\n\nCorporate Governance Guidelines. The Board of Directors has adopted corporate governance guidelines to assist and guide its members in the exercise of its responsibilities. These guidelines should be interpreted in accordance with any requirements imposed by applicable federal or state law or regulation, the Nasdaq Stock Market and our Certificate of Incorporation and By‑laws. Our corporate governance guidelines are available in the corporate governance section of our website at http://governance.vygr.com. Although these corporate governance guidelines have been approved by the Board of Directors, it is expected that these guidelines will evolve over time as customary practice and legal requirements change. In particular, guidelines that encompass legal, regulatory or exchange requirements as they currently exist will be deemed to be modified as and to the extent that such legal, regulatory or exchange requirements are modified. In addition, the guidelines may also be amended by the Board of Directors at any time as it deems appropriate.\n\nBoard Meetings and Committees. Our Board of Directors held eight meetings, adopted seven electronic consents, and acted via telephonic conference eight times during 2018. The directors regularly hold executive sessions at meetings of the Board of Directors. During 2018, each of the directors then in office and for the period during which he or she was in office, attended at least 75% of the aggregate of all meetings of the Board of Directors and all meetings of the committees of the Board of Directors on which such director then served. Continuing directors and nominees for election as directors in a given year are required to attend the annual meeting of stockholders, barring significant commitments or special circumstances. Each of our directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting.\n\nDuring 2018, our Board of Directors had four standing committees: Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Science and Technology Committee, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nAudit Committee. Since April 1, 2017, Perry Karsen, James A. Geraghty, and Michael Higgins currently serve on our Audit Committee, with Michael Higgins serving as chairman of the committee.

The Science and Technology Committee operates pursuant to a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, which is available on our website at http://governance.vygr.com.\n\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Since April 2017, James A. Geraghty, Michael Higgins, and Steven Hyman, M.D. have served on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, with James A. Geraghty serving as chairman of the committee. Our Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is “independent” as defined under the applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee operates pursuant to a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors and reviews its charter annually. A copy of the current Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter is available on our website at http://governance.vygr.com.\n\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers candidates for Board of Director membership suggested by its members and the Chief Executive Officer. Additionally, in selecting nominees for directors, the\n\n19\n\nTable of Contents\n\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review candidates recommended by stockholders in the same manner and using the same general criteria as candidates recruited by the committee and/or recommended by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder who wishes to recommend a candidate for consideration by the committee as a nominee for director should follow the procedures described later in this proxy statement under the heading “Stockholder Recommendations.” The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will also consider whether to nominate any person proposed by a stockholder in accordance with the provisions of our By‑laws relating to stockholder nominations as described later in this proxy statement under the heading “Stockholder Recommendations.”\n\nOur Board of Directors may establish other committees from time to time.\n\nIdentifying and Evaluating Director Nominees. The Board of Directors is responsible for identifying suitable candidates for nomination to the Board. The Board of Directors delegates the selection and nomination process to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, with the expectation that other members of the Board of Directors, and of management, will be requested to take part in the process as appropriate.\n\nGenerally, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identifies candidates for director nominees in consultation with management, through the use of search firms or other advisors, through the recommendations submitted by stockholders or through such other methods as the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee deems to be helpful to identify candidates. Once candidates have been identified, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee confirms that the candidates meet all of the minimum qualifications for director nominees established by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may gather information about the candidates through interviews, detailed questionnaires, comprehensive background checks or any other means that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee deems to be appropriate in the evaluation process. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee then meets as a group to discuss and evaluate the qualities and skills of each candidate, both on an individual basis and taking into account the overall composition and needs of the Board of Directors. Based on the results of the evaluation process, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends candidates for the Board of Directors’ approval as director nominees for election to the Board of Directors.\n\nMinimum Qualifications. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider, among other things, the following qualifications, skills and attributes when recommending candidates for the Board of Directors’ selection as nominees for the Board of Directors and as candidates for appointment to the Board of Directors’ committees. The nominee shall have experience at a strategic or policymaking level in a business, government, non-profit or academic organization of high standing, be highly accomplished in his or her respective field with superior credentials and recognition, be well regarded in the community and have a long-term reputation for high ethical and moral standards, have sufficient time and availability to devote to the affairs of the Company, and, to the extent such candidate serves or has previously served on other boards, have a demonstrated history of actively contributing at board meetings.\n\nIn evaluating proposed director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may consider, in addition to the minimum qualifications and other criteria for Board of Directors membership approved by the Board of Directors from time to time, all facts and circumstances that it deems appropriate or advisable, including, among other things, the skills of the proposed director candidate, his or her depth and breadth of professional experience or other background characteristics, his or her independence, his or her diversity, and the needs of the Board of Directors.\n\nOur Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the value of diversity when selecting nominees. Although we have no formal policy regarding board diversity, we believe that our Board of Directors, taken as a whole, should embody a diverse set of skills, experiences and backgrounds. The Committee does not make any particular weighting of diversity or any other characteristic in evaluating nominees and directors.\n\nStockholder Recommendations. Stockholders may submit recommendations for director candidates to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee by sending the individual’s name and qualifications to our Secretary at Voyager Therapeutics, Inc., 75 Sidney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02139, who will forward all recommendations to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate any candidates recommended by stockholders against the same criteria and pursuant to the same policies and procedures applicable to the evaluation of candidates proposed by directors or management. The\n\n20\n\nTable of Contents\n\nspecific requirements for the information that is required to be provided for such recommendations to be considered are specified in our By-laws and must be received by us no later than the date referenced above in “Voting—Procedure for Submitting Stockholder Proposals.”\n\nStockholder Communications. The Board of Directors provides to every stockholder the ability to communicate with the Board of Directors, as a whole, and with individual directors on the Board of Directors through an established process for stockholder communication. For a stockholder communication directed to the Board of Directors as a whole, stockholders may send such communication to the attention of the Chairman of the Board via U.S. Mail or Expedited Delivery Service to: Voyager Therapeutics, Inc., 75 Sidney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02139, Attn: Chairman of the Board.\n\nFor a stockholder communication directed to an individual director in his or her capacity as a member of the Board of Directors, stockholders may send such communication to the attention of the individual director via U.S. Mail or Expedited Delivery Service to: Voyager Therapeutics, Inc., 75 Sidney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02139.\n\nWe will forward by U.S. Mail any such stockholder communication to each director, and the Chairman of the Board in his or her capacity as a representative of the Board of Directors, to whom such stockholder communication is addressed to the address specified by each such director and the Chairman of the Board, unless there are safety or security concerns that mitigate against further transmission.\n\nRisk Oversight. Our Board of Directors oversees the management of risks inherent in the operation of our business and the implementation of our business strategies. Our Board of Directors performs this oversight role by using several different levels of review. In connection with its reviews of the operations and corporate functions of our company, our Board of Directors addresses the primary risks associated with those operations and corporate functions. In addition, our Board of Directors reviews the risks associated with our company’s business strategies periodically throughout the year as part of its consideration of undertaking any such business strategies.\n\nEach of the committees of our Board of Directors also oversees the management of our risk that falls within the committee’s areas of responsibility. In performing this function, each committee has full access to management, as well as the ability to engage advisors. Our Chief Financial Officer reports to the Audit Committee and is responsible for identifying, evaluating and implementing risk management controls and methodologies to address any identified risks. In connection with its risk management role, our Audit Committee meets privately with representatives from our independent registered public accounting firm, and privately with our Chief Financial Officer. The Audit Committee oversees the operation of our risk management program, including the identification of the primary risks associated with our business and periodic updates to such risks, and reports to our Board of Directors regarding these activities.\n\nAudit Committee Report\n\nThe information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be (1) “soliciting material,” (2) “filed” with the SEC, (3) subject to Regulations 14A or 14C of the Exchange Act, or (4) subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act. This report shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any of our other filings under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.\n\nThe Audit Committee operates under a written charter approved by the Board of Directors, which provides that its responsibilities include the oversight of the quality of our financial reports and other financial information and its compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; the appointment, compensation, and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young, including reviewing its independence; reviewing and approving the planned scope of our annual audit; reviewing and pre‑approving any non‑audit services that may be performed by Ernst & Young; the oversight of our internal audit function; reviewing with management and our independent registered public accounting firm the adequacy of internal financial controls; and reviewing our critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nThe Audit Committee oversees our financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management is responsible for our internal controls, financial reporting process, and compliance with laws and regulations and ethical business standards. Ernst & Young is responsible for performing an independent audit of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Audit Committee’s main responsibility is to monitor and oversee this process.\n\n21\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Audit Committee reviewed and discussed our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, with management. The Audit Committee has discussed with Ernst & Young applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, and the SEC. The Audit Committee has also received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the independent registered public accounting firm’s independence.\n\nThe Audit Committee considered any fees paid to Ernst & Young for the provision of non‑audit related services and does not believe that these fees compromise Ernst & Young’s independence in performing the audit.\n\nBased on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that such audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.\n\nTHE AUDIT COMMITTEE\n\nMichael Higgins\n\nPerry Karsen\n\nJames Geraghty\n\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n\nOverview\n\nVoyager’s compensation programs are designed to:\n\nOur Compensation Committee is primarily responsible for developing and implementing our compensation policies and establishing and approving the compensation for all of our executive officers; with respect to the Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee will review and make recommendations to the independent members of the Board of Directors for approval. The Compensation Committee oversees our compensation and benefit plans and policies, administers our equity incentive plans, reviews and approves annually all compensation decisions relating to our executive officers, and makes recommendations to the independent members of the Board of Directors on compensation for the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee considers recommendations from our Chief Executive Officer regarding the compensation of our executive officers other than himself. Our Compensation Committee has the authority under its charter to engage the services of a consulting firm or other outside advisor to assist it in designing our compensation programs and in making compensation decisions. Radford, an Aon/Hewitt company, is our current outside compensation consultant. In November 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed information regarding the independence and potential conflicts of interest of Radford, taking into account, among other things, the relationship between Radford, the members of our Board of Directors, and our executive officers and the factors set forth in the Nasdaq listing standards. Based on such review, the Committee concluded that the engagement of Radford did not raise any conflict of interest. The total amount paid to Radford in connection with these additional engagements was less than $120,000 in 2018.\n\n22\n\nTable of Contents\n\nExecutive Compensation Components\n\nHistorically, our Compensation Committee reviews all compensation components including base salary, bonus, benefits, equity incentives, and other perquisites, as well as severance arrangements, change-in-control benefits and other forms of executive officer compensation and provides a recommendation on the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and our other executive officers to our Board of Directors. In addition, the Compensation Committee also considers matters related to individual compensation, such as compensation for new executive hires, as well as high-level strategic issues, such as the efficacy of our compensation strategy, potential modifications to that strategy, and new trends, plans, or approaches to compensation, at various meetings throughout the year. The Compensation Committee also makes recommendations to our Board of Directors regarding the compensation of non-employee directors and has the authority to administer our equity-based plans.\n\nIn 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Radford as its compensation consultant. Radford assisted the Committee in conducting competitive compensation assessments for our executive officers for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, Radford also assisted in the determination of compensation for executive officers hired in 2018. In evaluating the total compensation of our executive officers, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of Radford, established a peer group of 24 publicly traded companies in the biopharmaceutical industry that was comprised of companies whose market capitalization, number of employees, maturity of product development pipeline or area of therapeutic focus are similar to Voyager. Our 2018 peer group includes the following companies:\n\nVoyager 2018 Compensation Peer Group\n\nAduro BioTech\n\nDimension Therapeutics\n\nOncoMed Pharmaceuticals\n\nAdverum Biotechnologies\n\nEndocyte\n\nRegenxbio\n\nApplied Genetic Technologies\n\nEpizyme\n\nSelecta Biosciences\n\nAveXis\n\nFive Prime Therapeutics\n\nStemline Therapeutics\n\nBellicum Pharmaceuticals\n\nGlobal Blood Therapeutics\n\nVersartis\n\nBlueprint Medicines\n\nIntellia Therapeutics\n\nVital Therapies\n\nCara Therapeutics\n\nLoxo Oncology\n\nXbiotech\n\nChemoCentryx\n\nMyoKardia\n\nXencor\n\nFor the full compensation analysis, Radford supplemented the peer group information with published survey data, which provided a broader market representation of companies and deeper position reporting.\n\nBase Salary\n\nBase salary is intended to provide compensation for day‑to‑day performance. The Compensation Committee believes that a competitive base salary is a necessary element of any compensation program that is designed to attract and retain talented and experienced executives. Base salaries for our named executive officers are intended to be competitive with those received by other individuals in similar positions at the companies with which we compete for talent. Base salaries are originally established at the time the executive is hired based on individual experience, skills and expected contributions, our understanding of what executives in similar positions at peer companies were paid, and also negotiations during the hiring process. The base salaries of our named executive officers are reviewed annually and may be adjusted to reflect market conditions and our executives’ performance during the prior year as well as the financial position of the company, or any change in the scope of the officer’s responsibilities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, the base salaries for our named executive officers who continued to serve as executive officers were as follows:\n\nNamed Executive Officer\n\nBase Salary\n\nG. Andre Turenne, President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n$ 520,000\n\nDinah Sah, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer\n\n$ 414,000\n\nMatthew P. Ottmer, Chief Operating Officer\n\n$ 414,000\n\n23\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPerformance‑Based Variable Cash Compensation\n\nOur Compensation Committee has the authority to award annual performance‑based variable cash compensation to our executive officers and make recommendations to the full Board of Directors for approval of performance‑based variable cash compensation for the Chief Executive Officer. For 2018, Mr. Turenne’s bonus target was set at 50% of base salary, pro-rated for service performed, while Dr. Sah and Mr. Ottmer had targets set at 40% of base salary. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee approved performance‑based variable cash compensation for 2018 performance to Mr. Turenne, Dr. Sah, and Mr. Ottmer in the amount of $143,325, $182,574, and $191,268, respectively, with the full Board of Directors approving Mr. Turenne’s payment. These payments were awarded in recognition of our named executive officers’ performance in achieving certain corporate, clinical, and operational milestones. The Board of Directors determined that the corporate goals were achieved at a rate of 105% for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nFor Mr. Turenne, Dr. Sah, and Mr. Ottmer, their bonuses included corporate and individual performance goals. Each of Mr. Turenne and Dr. Sah were awarded an effective rate of 110% of the amount he or she was eligible to receive based on the achievement of corporate and individual performance goals. Mr. Turenne’s bonus payment was pro-rated 50% to correspond to his service period performed. Mr. Ottmer was awarded an effective rate of 116% of the amount he was eligible to receive based on the achievement of corporate and individual performance goals. In 2018, the Compensation Committee made stock option grants to our named executive officers as specified in the “Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End Table—2018” below, with the full Board of Directors’ approving Mr. Turenne’s award.\n\nEquity Incentive Compensation\n\nEquity incentive grants to our named executive officers are made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee under the terms of our stock option plans. Equity incentive grants for the Chief Executive Officer are approved by the full Board of Directors. We believe that equity incentives subject to vesting over time or upon achievement of performance objectives, can be an effective vehicle for the long‑term element of compensation, as these awards align individual and team performance with the achievement of our strategic and financial goals over time, and with stockholders’ interests. Stock options, which have exercise prices equal to at least fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, reward executive officers only if the stock price increases from the date of grant. Beginning in 2019, we have introduced equity incentive awards using a mix of stock options and restricted stock units to further align individual performance with achievement of our corporate goals.\n\nEmployee Benefits\n\nIn addition to the primary elements of compensation described above, the named executive officers also participate in the same broad‑based employee benefits programs available to all of our employees, including health insurance, life and disability insurance, dental insurance and our 401(k) plan. The Company does not provide special benefits to its executive officers.\n\nSummary Compensation Table—2018 and 2017 Fiscal Years\n\nThe following table presents information regarding the total compensation awarded to, earned by, and paid during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 to our current President and Chief Executive Officer, our former President and Chief Executive Officer, and the two most highly‑compensated executive officers (other than those individuals who served as Chief Executive Officer during 2018) who were serving as executive officers at the end of the year ended December 31, 2018.

Except as noted below, these employment agreements and offer letters provide for “at will” employment.\n\nMr. G. Andre Turenne We entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Turenne in June 2018. Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Turenne is entitled to a salary of $520,000, subject to review and redetermination by the Company from time to time, and is eligible to participate in the Company’s Senior Executive Cash Incentive Bonus Plan, as approved by the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee from time to time.

Paul In May 2016 we entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Paul, which superseded the terms of his 2014 offer letter, pursuant to which Dr. Paul was entitled to a salary of $485,100, which was subject to review and redetermination by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee from time to time, and was eligible to participate in the Company’s Senior Executive Cash Incentive Bonus Plan, as approved by the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee from time to time. His employment agreement also provided for company reimbursement of up to 26 business or economy round trip tickets to and from Indiana, the location of his principle residence, annually. Dr. Paul’s employment agreement also provided for certain severance payments and benefits in the event his employment was terminated in certain circumstances as further described below under the heading “Potential Payments upon Termination.” As of January 1, 2018, Dr. Paul’s annual base salary was $506,900 and his performance-based variable compensation target was 50% of his annual base salary. In June 2018 we entered into a Retirement Agreement with Mr. Paul, pursuant to which Dr. Paul resigned as our President and Chief Executive Officer effective as of July 16, 2018, and as an employee of the Company effective as of August 1, 2018. During the period between the effective date of Dr. Paul’s resignation as President and Chief Executive Officer and August 1, 2018, Dr. Paul provided services to assist the transition of his responsibilities to Mr. Turenne, during which time he continued to receive his base salary and remained eligible to participate in the Company’s benefit plans (pursuant to the terms and conditions of such plans) and was entitled to vacation time in accordance with our vacation policy. The retirement agreement also provided for, among other things, a release of claims by Dr. Paul in favor of the Company and its affiliates, continuing confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-competition obligations applicable to Dr. Paul under his existing confidentiality, noncompetition and assignment agreement, and a non-disparagement obligation applicable to Dr. Paul. The retirement agreement replaced Dr. Paul’s May 2016 employment agreement described above. In addition, in August 2018, following the expiration of the transition period under his retirement agreement, we entered into a consulting agreement with Dr. Paul, pursuant to which Dr. Paul continues to provide consulting and advisory services, including but not limited to scientific guidance in connection with the certain of our collaborations, research and development programs, and business development efforts, for a twelve-month period, unless earlier terminated or extended in accordance with the terms of the agreement. In accordance with its terms, Dr. Paul’s consulting agreement may be extended at any time by mutual written consent of the parties or may be terminated by either party in the event the other party materially breaches the consulting agreement or Dr. Paul’s retirement agreement, or by us if Dr. Paul breaches his restrictive covenants agreement with cause. In addition, either party at any time, for any reason or no reason and subject to forty-five days prior written notice; may terminate the consulting agreement upon the mutual consent of the parties; or upon other specified conditions.\n\nDr. Dinah Sah We entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Sah in May 2016, pursuant to which Dr. Sah is entitled to a salary of $330,750, subject to review and redetermination by the company from time to time, and eligible to participate in the Company’s Senior Executive Cash Incentive Bonus Plan, as approved by the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee from time to time.
