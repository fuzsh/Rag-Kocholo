The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room SD-430, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Mike Enzi, chairman of the committee, presiding. Present: Senators Enzi, Alexander, Isakson, Ensign, Hatch, Kennedy, Dodd, Harkin, Mikulski, Murray, Reed and Clinton. Also present: Senator Hutchison. Opening Statement of Senator Enzi The Chairman. Good morning, and welcome to the confirmation hearing for Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach, to be the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and Mr. Paul DeCamp, to be the Wage and Hour Administrator of the Department of Labor. Both nominees are superbly qualified for these positions, and I look forward to their testimony and responses today. The FDA has a very broad and critical mission in protecting the public health. Dr. von Eschenbach, you'll be in charge of an Agency that regulates $1 trillion worth of products a year. The FDA ensures safety and effectiveness for all drugs and biological products, such as vaccines, medical devices, and animal drugs and feed. It also oversees the safety of a vast variety of food products, as well as medical and consumer products, including cosmetics. As Commissioner of the FDA, you'll be responsible for advancing the public health by helping to speed innovations in its mission areas and by helping the public get accurate, science-based information on medicines and foods. As a physician, I know you take this mission to heart. I'm pleased that we are now ready to hear Dr. von Eschenbach's plan to take charge, to take action, and to take responsibility for leading the FDA in the best interests of public health. We've met several times during your tenure as Acting Commissioner, and discussed a variety of issues, including drug safety, advisory committees, and citizen petitions. At those meetings, I've been impressed by your dedication to solving problems, and your focus on patient care, and your knowledge. One item we've discussed many times is the application to make the Plan B emergency contraceptive available without a prescription. You made a major announcement about that yesterday, and I'm going to ask you to go over that in some detail later this morning. The FDA has been without a confirmed Commissioner for all but 18 months out of the last 5\\1/2\\ years. I think we all can agree we need a strong leader at the FDA right now, and one who has a mandate to act. We must be forward-looking. There are many items before the FDA that require the immediate attention of an FDA Commissioner vested with full authority. But that authority flows directly from the act of Senate confirmation. Without a Senate-confirmed leader, we can't expect the FDA to be as effective as we need it to be. I urge my colleagues to consider this as we move forward. I look forward to working with you, Senator Kennedy, and with members of the committee, to protect and promote the public health and to maintain the FDA's status as one of the world's strongest regulatory agencies. We've been working in a very bipartisan way to get a bill that we think will do that. A confirmed commissioner would be very helpful in that. Also on this morning's agenda is the nomination of Paul DeCamp to be the Wage and Hour Administrator. This position within the Department of Labor is a pivotal one in administering and enforcing some of our most important workplace laws. The Wage and Hour Division is an integral part of the Department's largest administrative component, the Employment Standards Administration. The Wage and Hour Division is responsible for administering the minimum wage, overtime pay, and child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. This statute has enormous reach, covering some 110 million full-time and part-time workers. In addition to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Wage and Hour Division is responsible for the administration and enforcement of a number of other important workplace laws, including the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Migrant and Seasonal Workers Protection Act, and the three major statutes governing wage and hour standards for government contracts: the Davis-Bacon Act, the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act, and the Walsh-Healy Public Contracts Act. The Wage and Hour Administrator oversees many of the laws that protect our Nation's greatest resource: our workers. The President's nominee for this important position, Paul DeCamp, is currently serving in the Department of Labor as senior policy advisor to the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment Standards. Before assuming his current position at the Department of Labor, Mr. DeCamp had a distinguished career in a private legal practice, where he specialized in labor and employment issues, with a special emphasis on wage and hour matters. He has also written extensively on a number of Fair Labor Standards Act issues. The combination of practical front-line experience and demonstrated intellectual interest in the workings of the Wage and Hour Administration will be invaluable as he assumes his position of leading the division. Following an outstanding career at Harvard College and Columbia Law School, Mr. DeCamp was selected for a clerkship with U.S. Circuit Judge Alan E. Norris of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Norris has recommended Mr. DeCamp to this committee without reservation, praising his intellectual abilities, his practicality, balance, and impartiality in resolving difficult legal issues. He and others who have written to the committee in support of Mr. DeCamp's nomination praise his judgment, unbiased analysis of legal issues, attention to detail, and his ability to lead others. Mr. DeCamp, it'll be your responsibility to build upon your record and experience to effectively administer laws that are so critical to American workers and businesses. I have confidence in your ability to do so. I would note that the committee has received a number of letters in support of both these worthy nominees. These letters of support will be included in the record. [The information previously referred to follows:] Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA), Washington, DC, July 27, 2006. Hon. Michael B. Enzi, Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, 835 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC 20510. Hon. Edward M. Kennedy, Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, 644 Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC 20510. Dear Chairman Enzi and Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (``MDMA'') and the entrepreneurial and innovative medical technology companies we represent, I wish to convey strong support for the speedy confirmation of Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach to be the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. A rapid confirmation process is critical to ensuring the public health and safety of the Nation's citizens. As a representative of the innovative sector of the medical technology industry, MDMA has worked with Dr. von Eschenbach during his tenure at the FDA. He has always proven an able leader and has fought tirelessly to uphold the FDA's mission. MDMA believes Dr. von Eschenbach, as both a physician and a cancer survivor, is uniquely suited to lead FDA. With rapidly developing technologies and advancements in medicine it is imperative that FDA have a Commissioner who possesses not only the appropriate professional training, but also the courage, dedication and integrity necessary to lead the Agency. Dr. von Eschenbach is clearly qualified to be just such a Commissioner. We endorse Dr. von Eschenbach and encourage the Senate to act quickly to confirm him. Sincerely, Mark B. Leahey, Executive Director, Medical Device Manufacturers Association. ______ National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), Arlington, VA 22201-3042, July 31, 2006. Hon. Mike Enzi, Hon. Edward M. Kennedy, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC 20510. Dear Chairman Enzi & Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the 210,000 members and 1,200 affiliates of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), I am writing to urge support for the nomination of Andrew C. von Eschenbach, M.D. as Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As the Nation's largest organization representing individuals with severe mental illnesses and their families, NAMI is pleased to support this important appointment. In NAMI's view, Dr. von Eschenbach brings unique qualifications to the important position of FDA Commissioner. He has an enormous background as a clinician and researcher and is well qualified to lead the FDA. His resume speaks volumes to his professional accomplishments as a leader in medical research. He most recently served as the Director of the National Cancer Institute as Chief Academic Officer at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. He has gained perspective as a patient advocate, serving as President of the American Cancer Society, before joining NCI and being recognized with the National Health Care Humanitarian Award by the Patient Advocate Foundation in 2005. NAMI urges you and your colleagues on the Senate HELP Committee to act swiftly on this important nomination. It is critically important that the FDA have a strong leader in place to address challenges faced by the Agency with respect to speeding access to newer and more effective treatments for Americans living with chronic disabling illnesses. Sincerely, Michael J. Fitzpatrick, M.S.W., Executive Director. ______ Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), Washington, DC 20005-3814, July 31, 2006. Hon. Michael B. Enzi, Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, 428 Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC 20510. Hon. Edward M. Kennedy, Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, 317 Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC 20510. Dear Chairman Enzi: On behalf of the Advanced Medical Technology Industry (AdvaMed) and our member companies, I am writing in support of the nomination of Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach to be Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. Dr. von Eschenbach is an excellent choice to head the FDA. He has had an outstanding career as a physician, researcher, and administrator in both the public and private sectors. As a physician, he has treated cancer patients for almost 30 years. As a researcher, he has published more than 200 articles and books and was the founding director of M.D. Anderson's Prostate Cancer Research Program. As an administrator, he has served as Vice President for Academic Affairs at M.D. Anderson and has had a dynamic tenure as the head of the National Cancer Institute. He has also served as the president-elect of the American Cancer Society. It is critically important to our industry and to the Nation that the position of FDA Commissioner be filled. Strong leadership is essential if the FDA is to most effectively fulfill its mission of assuring that the food Americans eat is safe and healthful, that the drugs they take are safe and effective, and that the medical devices they rely on for cures and treatment are safe and effective and represent the latest and best that our industry can offer. Experience has shown that a permanent director confirmed by the Senate is necessary to assure that the Agency has the authoritative leadership it needs to respond promptly and effectively to all the challenges it faces. Prompt confirmation of Dr. von Eschenbach is especially important in view of the issues that are currently facing the FDA. Next year, both the medical device and drug user fee programs must be renewed by Congress, and the agreements between industry and the FDA that will be the starting point for the reauthorization are being negotiated right now. The critical path initiative, which offers so much potential for speeding the development and approval of safe and effective products, is just getting off the ground and needs a strong advocate. The challenge of determining how FDA can most effectively conduct post- market surveillance to assure the safety and effectiveness of approved products is an issue that needs strong leadership from the top. The continuing challenges of food safety and preparation for a pandemic or bioterrorist attack need a strong FDA voice. AdvaMed member companies produce the medical devices, diagnostic products and health information systems that are transforming health care through earlier disease detection, less invasive procedures and more effective treatments. Our members produce nearly 90 percent of the health care technology purchased annually in the United States and more than 50 percent purchased annually around the world. AdvaMed members range from the largest to the smallest medical technology innovators and companies. We respectfully urge you to support Dr. von Eschenbach's prompt confirmation. Thank you for considering this request. Sincerely, Stephen J. Ubl, President and CEO. ______ OMERIS, Columbus, OH 43212-1155, August 2, 2006. Hon. Michael B.

To: Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee From: Dr. Edwin A.

Dr. von Eschenbach's experience as a researcher and physician will provide the FDA with a better focus to confront the challenges and new opportunities facing the Agency. Dr. von Eschenbach will lead the Agency and strengthen the credibility of its decisionmaking process. Edwin A. Mirand, Ph.D., D.Sc., Secretary. ______ Cancer Cure Coalition, Palm Beach Gardens, FL, 33410, August 9, 2006. Dr. Andrew Von Eschenbach, M.D., Acting Commissioner, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, MD 20857-0001. Dear Dr. Von Eschenbach: I am President of the Cancer Cure Coalition, a nonprofit Foundation dedicated to the cure and prevention of cancer. We join with the Biotechnology Industry Organization's (BIO) call for a swift confirmation of your appointment as Commissioner of the FDA. We believe it important that a permanent director be in charge of this vitally important public health Agency and we believe that you have the special experience and ability required to deal with the complex problems confronting it. We believe that the long period where this Agency has lacked a permanent director has led to a slow down in its decisionmaking and a possible fearfulness to approve new scientific breakthroughs. We think that this is holding back important new treatments for life threatening illnesses and in particular those for cancer. One major example of this is the delay in approving Advexin, a P53 gene tumor suppressor now in Phase III of clinical trials for treating head and neck cancer. This therapy was first developed at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Texas and then was licensed to Introgen Corp. which continued its development. Although being tested for only head and neck cancer this gene therapy has already shown its ability to successfully treat many other types of cancer as well. The P53 gene is naturally present in the body and it stops cell division when DNA damage occurs. When the P53 gene is damaged or does not function normally genetic mutations can occur in dividing cells leading to the accumulation of malignant cells and potential cancer growth. What makes this gene therapy even more promising is the recent development by Genzyme Corp. of a new diagnostic test that detects specific mutations in the P53 gene. This allows the gene therapy treatment to be targeted to those patients most likely to respond to this therapy. Genzyme's test is a significant improvement over the florescent in-situ hybridization. (FISH) technology currently in use. What is especially troubling about the FDA's delay in approving this therapy is that a similar gene therapy was approved in China 3 years ago. The product Gendicine is produced by SiBiono Corp. of Beijing, China. It was tested for head and neck cancer and it was approved after only 3 years of testing. It is now being used to treat other cancers as well. Some doctors in China view it as a scientific breakthrough comparable in importance to the discovery of penicillin. Cancer patients are now visiting China to get this therapy and SiBiono has recently started licensing it to cancer centers outside of China. Dr. Peng Zhaohui who founded SiBiono was trained in the United States and I suspect he brought back to China information on this therapy that was developed in the United States. I think we have reason to be concerned about our country falling behind other nations in the development and use of new therapies. This is causing economic harm to our country as well as deficiencies in our treatment of critically ill patients. ``This is a wake-up call to America'' said Mark Kay, president of the American Society of Gene Therapy and Director of The Stanford University School of Medicine. ``We need to look at some of the regulatory hurdles, and the funding issues right now, funding for biomedical research is really hurting, and it's short sighted to think this doesn't hurt our economy in the long run.'' I know from your opening statements at your confirmation hearing that you well understand the importance of the FDA and its need for strong and permanent leadership. I am looking forward to your taking on that role and in your leading the FDA in finding ways to streamline its regulatory processes to make them more efficient and to respond to the opportunities and challenges of science and technology. We hope that the Senate will promptly approve your appointment. Sincerely, Charles A. Reinwald, President. ______ The Chairman. I thank both nominees for their willingness to serve, and for their attendance and attention today. I would now turn to Senator Kennedy for purposes of his opening statement. Opening Statement of Senator Kennedy Senator Kennedy. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for having these hearings. Just, sort of, to frame this hearing, particularly with regards to the head of the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration is perhaps the most important health Agency that we have in the United States of America, and probably in the world. Centers for Disease Control may be a close-to-second. Obviously, NIH has an extraordinary role to play. But the Food and Drug Administration, as you appropriately pointed out, has such influence and responsibility to the American families, in terms of its leadership. I really deplore the fact that we have not had a permanent chair for that Agency--only 18 months out of the last 5 years-- and an acting head cannot do the job and make the difficult judgments and decisions. And we have seen an Agency that's in trouble. That is why we have to give very, very careful consideration. We have a number of important policy issues today to examine with the nominee. But this Agency is really in trouble, and some would even say, in crisis. At a time, we are on the brink of the life- science century--life-science century, with all the possibilities that this has, in terms of new drugs, and the possibilities of using the information technology that you and I have talked about that can bring drugs onto the market faster--but we need to have an Agency that has the support of an administration, that has the support of the Congress, and is going to follow the--wherever the science is going to lead it. So, this is an important, extremely important, hearing and I welcome this. I welcome these nominees, Dr. von Eschenbach and Mr. DeCamp, and congratulate them on receiving their nominations. These are two positions worthy of the serious consideration, and we are looking forward to the course of the hearings. I've always been a strong supporter of the Cancer Institute. I admire Dr. von Eschenbach's leadership there, especially on issues on genomics and nanotechnology. As a survivor of cancer himself, and physician for patients with cancer, he has brought an important patient-centered perspective to the Institute, and he'll bring it to the Food and Drug Administration, as well. In the controversies over antidepressants and suicide behavior in children, the withdrawal of Vioxx, the Agency's refusal to approve the sale of Plan B over-the-counter, we've seen the FDA struggling with difficult scientific questions, inadequate resources and authority, and unfair pressures to ignore science. FDA needs a strong commissioner to deal with these and other issues, to refocus the Agency, enable it to make decisions based solely on science, developed after an open and unencumbered scientific debate, not on ideology or political expediency. So, the pending decision on the Plan B is a test case of the FDA's integrity. Yesterday, Dr. von Eschenbach announced that FDA would not pursue the rulemaking the administration had previously claimed was needed to respond to this application in favor of a more informal negotiation with the manufacturer. If this step leads to a swift and clear decision, I applaud it, but we must make certain that the administration does not use it as yet another delaying tactic. Serious concerns have been raised about the degree to which political pressures influence FDA's actions on Plan B, and I urge Dr. von Eschenbach to use the upcoming negotiations to begin to allay those concerns, and not to raise them anew. Sadly, Plan B is not the only example in which the Administration has pressured FDA to value political consideration over the statutes under which it operates and the science before it. Recent survey of the Union of Concerned Scientists presents serious evidence of problems at the Agency. The majority of the Agency's scientists who responded disagreed, or strongly disagreed, that FDA's leadership consistently stands behind scientific staff or managers who propose science-supported decisions, even though they may be politically controversial. FDA has long been regarded as the gold standard in regulatory work, but that will continue to be the case only if it makes independent science-based decisions in both fact and appearance. Under Dr. von Eschenbach's leadership, we expect FDA to make decisions solely on the basis of science and in the best interest of the public health. I hope he will assure us that FDA management will no longer reject the views of Agency scientists or actively discourage them from voicing their concern. Next year will be an important year for the FDA. Four reauthorizations will come before this committee. We'll need the Agency's assistance to enact them. Senator Enzi and I are preparing to introduce a drug safety bill, which will require the Agency and companies to develop a strategy to consider the post-approval safety of a drug. And I hope we'll have Dr. von Eschenbach's support for that effort and the support of all at the Agency. We also have the opportunity to consider another nomination, Paul DeCamp, to be Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor. This vital position is charged with enforcing many of our most critical worker protections, including minimum wage, overtime, child labor protections, Fair Labor Standards Act, the leave requirements, family and medical leave, the prevailing wage requirements, the Davis-Bacon Act, and Service Contract Act. The actions of the Wage and Hour Administrator affect the lives of every worker in America. It ensures that men and women who work overtime will be able to rely on overtime pay to make ends meet. He protects working teenagers from being forced to use dangerous equipment that can threaten their health or safety. He ensures that parents who need to care for sick children can meet their family needs and still return to their jobs. He defends vulnerable employees, such as migrant workers and day laborers, when they are exploited by unscrupulous employers. Unfortunately, this administration has showed a troubling lack of commitment to protecting workers' rights in these areas. They've adopted regulations that could deny overtime rights for as many as 6 million workers. They've made sweetheart deals that let repeat offenders, like Wal-Mart, off the hook for violating child labor laws year after year, and they've refused to raise the minimum wage for hardworking people living below the poverty line. And they've failed to protect the rights of hardworking men and women rebuilding the Gulf Coast. So, the nomination of Mr. DeCamp raises troubling questions. His record clearly demonstrates--question whether-- his real commitment to workers' rights, which is necessary to fulfill these important laws. His extensive record of publication shows--does not support the goals of the statute, in many of the statutes he'll be responsible for enforcing. He's advocated change in current law to drastically reduce the number of employees entitled to overtime pay, and suggested that those who work overtime, but are denied overtime pay by their employers, do not deserve the remedies these laws provide. So, his record in the private practice is equally disturbing. And we're very concerned about the alarming number of men and women in the Gulf Coast area who were not paid, and the working conditions they had there, which was a part of the responsibility that he had when he was in the Department. So, I look forward to those questions, and I thank the Chair. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy and I would join in welcoming Dr. von Eschenbach's wife, Madelyn, who's here with us today. Would you--thank you. And I would mention that Mr. DeCamp's wife gave birth to a baby last week; and so, is at home taking care of that baby. So, we congratulate you. In a moment, I'll ask Senator Hutchison to take a moment to introduce Dr. Eschenbach. And, following the introductions, we'll hear the testimony of both nominees, beginning with Dr. Eschenbach. After both of the nominees have offered their testimony, we'll begin with the first of two rounds of questions by the members who are present and wish to make inquiry of one or both of the nominees. Should any member have additional questions remaining after the two rounds, these additional questions can be submitted in writing to the nominees after the conclusion of today's hearing. I would ask that that be expeditious. The record will remain open for 10 days. Senator Hutchison. Statement of Senator Hutchison Senator Hutchison. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I'm very pleased to introduce my constituent, Dr. Andy von Eschenbach. He is a person that I have known for a long time, and I know he is the highly qualified person that we are looking for in this very important job. I listened to both the opening statements, and I agree that this is perhaps the most important of our medical agencies, because it not only protects America for the safety and security of our medicines and drugs, but it is also important that we have someone who has practiced in medicine and knows that sometimes we have not kept up with the ability to bring things into the market that could save lives. So, I think that he is the perfect person for this position. His credentials are impeccable. He served as director of the National Cancer Institute. He is a nationally recognized urologic surgeon, medical educator, and cancer advocate. As you mentioned, Senator Kennedy, he's a cancer survivor. He's a cancer survivor three times, so he really does have the patient viewpoint, which is, I think, so important in someone who is doing research and who would seek this position. Prior to his nomination and service as director of NCI, he spent 25 years at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, one of the leading cancer research and treatment centers in America--and, in fact, in the world. He was executive vice president and chief academic officer there. He led a faculty of nearly 1,000 cancer researchers and clinicians. At the time of his selection to be National Cancer Institute director, he was president-elect of the American Cancer Society. He has made significant contributions to the scientific literature through more than 2,000 articles, books, and book chapters. Dr. von Eschenbach received the National Healthcare Humanitarian Award from the Patient Advocate Foundation in 2005. In 2004, Friends of Cancer Research presented him its Cancer Leadership Award. And George Washington University presented him its Distinguished Cancer Public Service Award. Dr. von Eschenbach is a native of Philadelphia. He earned a bachelor of science degree from St. Joseph's University, and his medical degree from Georgetown University School of Medicine in 1967. He completed residencies in general surgery and urology at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. He also served in the U.S. Navy as a lieutenant commander in the Medical Corps. Mr. Chairman and members, I know this man, and I know that if you're looking at qualifications, his are impeccable. If you're looking at experience and how he has served in every job he has held, he is without blemish. I think it is important that we have Senate confirmation of the person holding this very important job in our country, and I hope you will give him the vote for confirmation in the Senate. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you very much. We appreciate your being here and the words that you've shared with us. I would mention that Mr. Paul DeCamp, the nominee for the position of Wage and Hour Administrator at the Department of Labor, is currently serving at the Department of Labor in the position of senior policy advisor to the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment Standards. Mr. DeCamp is a graduate of Harvard College and Columbia University Law School, and he was both a Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar and editor of the Columbia Law Review. Following his graduation from law school, he served as clerk to Judge Alan E. Norris of the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit. Following this clerkship and prior to entering his current position at the Department of Labor, Mr. DeCamp was engaged in private legal practice, which concentrated on labor and employment matters with emphasis on wage and hour issues. On behalf of the committee, I welcome both of you. We'll begin with Dr. von Eschenbach's testimony. STATEMENT OF ANDREW VON ESCHENBACH, NOMINEE TO BE COMMISSIONER OF FOOD AND DRUGS, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Dr. von Eschenbach. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Senator Kennedy and members of the committee. I am honored to be here this morning to seek your support for my nomination to be the Commissioner for Food and Drugs, and to lead the Food and Drug Administration. In the 11 months since President Bush appointed me as Acting Commissioner, I've become acutely aware of the Agency's need for strong and permanent leadership with a commissioner that is not only the choice of the President, but also confirmed by the U.S. Senate. I appreciate this opportunity to earn your trust and support by sharing my vision for the future of this vitally important public health Agency, by helping you to get to know me better as a person, and by highlighting the experience and dedication that I bring to this important role. To know me, it is important for me to first introduce a few special people who are here with me today. First and foremost is my first date in the sixth grade, Madelyn, who, 39 years ago, I finally got to agree to become my wife and then the mother of our four children. And she is now Nonna to our five grandchildren and the one who's on the way. You should know that I am blessed by her support, and the support of our family, as I embark on this very important challenge. I also want to introduce a few key members of FDA's senior leadership who are behind me: Mr. Patrick Ronan, Chief of Staff; Dr. Janet Woodcock, the Deputy Commissioner for Operations; Dr. Scott Gottlieb, Deputy Commissioner for Medical and Scientific Affairs; and Mr. David Boyer, Assistant Commissioner for Legislation. They are representing the center directors and the office directors who lead the FDA, as well as the Agency's over-12,000 incredibly talented and highly trained professionals and staff who epitomize the true meaning of the word ``public servant.'' It is important to know that if I am confirmed, their support and guidance will be my greatest asset in leading the FDA. My fellow Texan and my friend Senator Hutchison graciously outlined my career as a physician. And as I come before you today reflecting on that career, I am struck by the fact that so much has changed from my early years in training as a urologic surgeon, to a career at the University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center as an oncologist, researcher, and educator, to, 4\\1/2\\ years ago, becoming the director of the National Cancer Institute, and now as the President's nominee to lead the FDA. I am struck by how much has changed in my life, but, in fact, struck by the fact that one critical element of my life has not changed. When I began my career in medicine, 40 years ago, my singular aspiration was to accept the trust that others placed in me and to use my skills to save their lives and improve their health. Today, as I seek the Senate's confirmation to lead the FDA, I remain as committed as ever to that very simple, but profoundly important, ideal and purpose. It is emphatically apparent to me that, as Commissioner of FDA, my role, and the FDA's role, has always been, and will always be, no matter how much we change over time, to cherish the trust of patients and the public, and that our every single action, decision, or activity must be directed to preserving their lives and protecting their health. This year, the FDA celebrates its 100th birthday, and a proud tradition of service, and protecting and promoting public health. As the FDA regulates almost 25 percent of all the products that Americans consume, its talented and dedicated employees continue to set the gold standard that is emulated around the world, but has not been equaled. As a Nation, we are blessed that, because of our Food and Drug Administration, we go to bed each night not worrying about the safety of the food we eat or the effectiveness of the medicines we gave our grandchildren. This standard of achievement must not change. But the world around us is changing, and the FDA of today is faced with new challenges, and the FDA of tomorrow will encounter incredible opportunities. During my career as a researcher, I have witnessed exponential progress in science and technology that is revolutionizing our very concepts of health and of disease. But, as a physician, I am also painfully aware that, as we sit here today, we struggle--struggle to make available safe and effective new treatments for life-threatening conditions like cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, HIV/AIDS, to prepare against the risk of pandemic flu, and to deal with emerging threats to our food safety. Today, we are faced with unprecedented challenges and unprecedented opportunities across the continuum of discovery, development, and delivery of interventions and products that represent the fruits of a revolution in science and technology, but, more importantly, the solution to many problems that threaten our health and well-being. And central to addressing these challenges and seizing these opportunities is the FDA. While the Agency's first century was truly remarkable, the FDA of the 21st century must incorporate modern management tools and processes to meet the challenge of today while creating scientific tools and technologies to address the ever- evolving, increasingly complex regulatory issues of the future. To accomplish this goal, the Agency needs strong permanent leadership and efficient strategic management. I am here asking for your support of my nomination, because I believe I can provide both. Let me briefly outline for you the strategic focus for leading this Agency into the 21st century. FDA is positioned as the critically important bridge between scientific discovery and development of products, and the delivery of those solutions to patients and the public. We can, and must, find ways to integrate new information technologies to streamline our regulatory processes, to make them more efficient, rigorous, and transparent, in order to assure the public we serve of the safety and efficacy of those products. The FDA of the 21st century must be prepared to respond to new opportunities and challenges presented by science and technology. And, through initiatives like the Critical Path to Personalized Medicine, we are working to approve the tools that we use to more effectively evaluate new products and processes. For example, the use of biomarkers, we will be able to predict, earlier and more accurately, both the safety and the efficacy of drugs, biologics, and devices. This is the pathway that will take us into an era of personalized medicine, where healthcare is tailored to each individual patient, where the safety of medical products is enhanced by our improved understanding of how they interact with different patients and under different conditions. By enhancing both our internal and external collaborations, we can create synergies and enhanced efficiencies to allow us to better communicate and carry out FDA's critical public health mission. Moving forward, it will not be enough just to do the right thing; we must be committed to doing it in the right way. Above all, I am committed to maintaining the longstanding traditions and values of an Agency whose processes and decisions are guided by sound science and vigorous analysis of evidence, and are based on the best interests of the patients and the public we serve. Much work remains to fully equip FDA to face the challenges and seize the opportunities ahead, but I am confident that we are on the right path. And, if confirmed, I believe I can provide the leadership and the management that will guide this important public health agency proudly and effectively into its second century of service. As a physician, one other thing in my life has not changed. I continue to speak with patients and offer advice and consultation. A few weeks ago, I spoke with a young mother who happened to be celebrating her daughter's birthday when I returned her call. She shared with me that she had had a tumor for which she had already been treated with surgery and with chemotherapy, but the tumor was growing and threatening her life and her hope of being there for her daughter's next birthday. The question she wanted to ask of me was, ``Is there anything else?'' Senators and members of the committee, millions of people are asking, ``Is there anything else?'' Anything else for cancer, Alzheimer's, AIDS, diabetes, avian flu, anything else to protect our food supply, improve nutrition, alleviate obesity, keep our animals healthy and our cosmetics safe? The fact is, there cannot be anything else without the FDA--a modern, efficient, and effective FDA. I know the FDA is capable of fulfilling its mission to assure hope that one day there will, indeed, be something else. FDA is the Agency that can assure Americans hope. Through strong management and leadership, we have the ability to translate innovations into safe and effective new interventions that protect and promote human health. In this task, the Agency cannot, and will not, fail. It would be the fulfillment of my aspiration to have your trust, and the trust of the American people, to have the privilege to lead the FDA, to save lives, and to assure the health of our Nation and the world. If confirmed, I look forward to working closely with this committee on the many important issues that we'll address together. I thank you for the opportunity of coming before you today, and I'm happy to answer any questions the committee may have. [The prepared statement of Dr. von Eschenbach follows:] Prepared Statement of Andrew von Eschenbach, M.D. Mr. Chairman, Senator Kennedy, and members of the committee, I am Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach, and I am honored to be here this morning to seek your support for my confirmation to be Commissioner for Food and Drugs, to lead the Food and Drug Administration.

If confirmed, I look forward to working closely with this committee on the many important issues that we'll address together. Again, thank you for the opportunity to come before you today. I'm happy to answer any questions the committee may have. The Chairman. Thank you, Doctor. The committee will now hear the testimony of Mr. DeCamp. STATEMENT OF PAUL DeCAMP, NOMINEE TO BE THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Mr. DeCamp. Mr. Chairman, Senator Kennedy, distinguished members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss my nomination to be the Administrator of the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division. I am humbled and honored to have been nominated by the President for this position. The Wage and Hour Division enforces some of our Nation's most important and broadly applicable laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, the Davis-Bacon Act, and the Service Contract Act, as well as dozens of other statutes. At its core, every law that the Wage and Hour Division enforces is about protecting workers. These laws apply to approximately 130 million employees, and they benefit the countless millions more who are the family members. I believe that my background has given me an inherent empathy for all working Americans. I grew up in a small town in southeastern Massachusetts. People in my town tended to work in trades, textiles, jewelry fabrication, and other predominantly blue-collar occupations. I attended public schools from kindergarten through high school. My father, who was not a college graduate, spent most of his working life as a night watchman, relying on every cent of his shift premium and his overtime pay just to make ends meet. My mother lost her job, due to company downsizing, after 15 years of service. I have personally worked in a number of jobs. I have had the experience of punching time clocks, working for minimum wage and overtime, and pulling double shifts. I have washed dishes, bussed tables, mopped floors, stocked shelves, de-iced freezers, flipped burgers, gotten splashed by fryolator grease, run a cash register, and more. I spent years working side by side with people who needed these jobs to support their families. Most recently, my wife is currently on leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Our second child, William Charles DeCamp, was born a week ago today. I respect working men and women, as well as their families. I respect the right of youth to work in a safe environment. I understand and empathize with people who are economically vulnerable. I appreciate how what may seem like small amounts of money by Washington, DC., standards--$20 here or $100 there--can, for a great many families, make all the difference between paying the rent, or not; making the car payment, or not; being able to afford food and clothing, or not. I would consider it a genuine honor and privilege to serve as Administrator so that I can protect workers like my parents, the people I grew up with, and the many millions of Americans like them throughout the Nation who depend on the Federal wage and hour laws to ensure that they get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. In my career as an attorney, I have gained useful insights into how wage and hour issues play out in the workplace, including how employers formulate workplace policies, how violations occur, and how disputes develop. I believe that most employers intend to comply with the law, and that many wage and hour violations result from an employer's good-faith misunderstanding or lack of knowledge of what the law requires. At the same time, I appreciate the importance of obeying the law and securing any appropriate remedies for workers whose rights have been violated, even inadvertently. In my view, the primary goal for the Wage and Hour Division is to achieve maximum compliance with the law. If I am confirmed, I would pursue that goal in a number of ways. First, the Wage and Hour Division must promptly process and investigate complaints it receives alleging violations of law. That activity accounts for most of the Agency's enforcement work, and I would continue to emphasize that aspect of its operations. Second, I would continue, and increase, directed enforcement efforts that focus on protecting the rights of the Nation's most vulnerable workers, such as children, employees in low-wage industries, migrant workers, and undocumented individuals. I would work closely with field personnel to identify specific areas, whether types of claims, specific industries, geographic regions, or particular employers, where the Agency believes that violations are going unreported or under-reported. In such instances, it may be appropriate to supplement the Agency's complaint-based enforcement activities with directed investigations, and that work may differ from region to region. Third, I would make it a priority to review and to update the child labor regulations. Those regulations have not been substantially revised in approximately three decades. I believe those regulations should reflect current information regarding the risks posed to minors in employment. These measures would be in addition to the actions necessary to respond to broader challenges that may arise, such as protecting workers in the Gulf Coast region in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, addressing the needs of day laborers, and safeguarding reforestation workers. I believe in our wage and hour laws and the essential purposes they serve. I know how important these laws are to the individuals and families whom the laws protect. If I am confirmed, I will do my best to enforce those laws justly, fairly, and vigorously. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared remarks. I will be happy to answer any questions you or the members of the committee may have.

If I am confirmed, I will do my best to enforce those laws justly, fairly, and vigorously. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared remarks. I will be happy to answer any questions you or the members of the committee may have. The Chairman. Thank you very much. I appreciate the testimony of both of you. I'll begin with a question for Dr. von Eschenbach. The most important part of your job will be making decisions. And I appreciate, in your testimony, where you briefly explained how you go about making a decision, and what it would be based on. Now, in light of your testimony, I'd like to explore how you made the decision that you just made on Plan B. Yesterday, you announced that remaining issues could likely be worked out within a few weeks. Your predecessor said the Plan B application raised complex legal and regulatory questions, and he directed the FDA to issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking. He received tens of thousands of comments in response to the notice. Yesterday, in your letter to the sponsor, you indicated that the comments suggested there was no need for rulemaking. If the FDA's authority was, indeed, unclear, as the Agency suggested in its notice, is it clear now? How did the comments inform your decision? And what new information did they add to the discussion? And, finally, why did you make the announcement yesterday, the day before the confirmation hearing? Dr. von Eschenbach. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will attempt to answer each of those points. And perhaps, with your permission, it might be helpful to do so if I just frame the issue as I encountered it, and some of the background that's associated with it. When I arrived at the FDA, approximately 11 months ago, this was, of course, a process that had already been underway. It began in April 2003, when the manufacturer of this particular product applied for a switch from it being available by prescription to being available without prescription. This particular drug is a contraceptive, an oral contraceptive, that is used for emergency purposes, not for routine purposes, and it acts by preventing conception. It had been used by prescription, across all age groups of women. Now it was being requested to be applied to all age groups of women without the need for a prescription. And, under those circumstances, the issue that the FDA was addressing was whether it could be used safely, and whether it could be used appropriately, without the need for medical supervision. The decision that was ultimately arrived at by the Center director in reviewing and coming to a decision was that there was a subset of women, young girls in their teenage years, in whom it was not clear that this could, in fact, be used without the need for medical supervision. And, on that basis, the application was denied. And the company submitted an amended application in which they bifurcated the ability to dispense this drug by providing it for over-the-counter, or without prescription, if you will, for women who were older than 16, and by prescription for those who were 16 and younger. This created, for the Agency, a new question with regard to the regulatory framework, a question independent of the review of the application, per se, but having to do with the issue of being able to appropriately provide access to a drug that would be both by prescription and nonprescription, when the drug was in the exact same formulation, in the exact same dose, in the exact same packaging, and how that could be managed appropriately and still protect and preserve public health. On that basis, my predecessor believed that we needed to move to a process of an advance notice for a proposed rulemaking in which that process would allow that question to be open to a wide range of opinions that would inform the Agency with regard to whether it would or would not need to go forward with separate rulemaking to address that issue of something being nonprescription and prescription at the same time. That is the process as it existed at the time that I came to the FDA. My commitment, at that point, in carrying through on that process, was to, first and foremost, address the issue of the process, the mechanism that had been put in place for the advanced notice for proposed rulemaking. The public commentary came to a close in November. There were approximately 47,000 comments to the record. They were able to be, then, processed and categorized in a way that addressed the various questions that were posed to the Agency. Those responses, and that input, was analyzed with an internal process. I engaged in the analysis of that, and the examination of the evidence. And it was the conclusion of career staff, and I concurred in that conclusion, that the overwhelming evidence that came out of that process indicated we did not need to move forward with a special process of rulemaking, that we could accommodate the bifurcation of this application within our current regulatory framework. Based on that decision, and the fact that I could remove the need for rulemaking, I turned my attention back to the application itself, and, as you indicated, I informed the company, yesterday, that we were prepared to engage with them in a discussion of going forward with consideration of their application if we could arrive at an agreement in which we could move forward and allow the drug to be available by nonprescription for women who are 18 years of age and older, and with prescription for those who are less than 18 years of age, and with a risk-management plan that would assure, and be certain, that young girls who are in need of medical supervision if they are going to use this particular emergency intervention safely and appropriately, I was willing to move forward with a final decision on their application. And so, I made a decision to not go forward with rulemaking, and I made a decision to engage with the company to work through an adequate risk-management plan that would then lead to a final decision on their application. And the reason it was done yesterday is that this has been a process that has been unfolding and has been underway, and, by virtue of the legal prescriptions and requirements, I could not disclose or make public any of these discussions until I first notified the company of my decision, and that occurred yesterday morning. The Chairman. My time has expired. Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy. The unfolding underway is, I think, the understatement. Let me just go through--because I think we're going to have questions in this area, and I think you've given us an overview on it. Just very quickly, as you remember, Doctor, you had--December 16, 2003, FDA Science Advisory voted 24 to 3 to support approval of Plan B for over-the-counter use. And, on February 22, 2004, FDA was required by law to issue a decision, failed to meet the deadline. July 21, 2004, response FDA, belated rejection of its initial application. The manufacturer modified the application to address the FDA's concerns. Then, in January 2005, FDA failed to meet the statutory deadline for acting on the revised application. Then, July 2005, Secretary Leavitt committed to taking action on the application by September 1, but the only action the FDA took was to say it needed more time to study the application. Then, on November 15, 2005, GAO issued a report stating, ``In the decade from 1994 to 2004, only one application for a drug to go OTC, over-the-counter, that was rejected after the Advisory Committee voted for approval, and that case was Plan B.'' So then, yesterday, the administration issued not a decision, but a framework. Now, you have that background, plus the background that says that the changing of the date of the individual women, the Agency reviews the data and says that it can be approved if the company files an amendment for women 16 and up. Then the company does so, and the Agency says, ``Actually, we need to make the application for 17 and up.'' And then, a year later, it says, ``No, it has to be 18 and up.'' So, there's a number of issues and questions. First, the question to you is, When can the American people, at least, expect the FDA to decide what the science says about Plan B? Will it be next week or next month or next year? We'll have to wait until the future on that issue. And then, second, nearly 3\\1/2\\ years--this is the broader issue--and that is, 3\\1/2\\ years after the application, FDA hasn't made a decision, one way or another, and moved the goal posts. And what's your reaction to those that say that this kind of a process really makes it basically unacceptable, in terms of approving, you know, new drugs? What message does that say? Granted, these are all prior to the time--you know, that you're familiar with this issue, so we--put it in that context. What's it say about the process? And then, when do we--are we going to get the actions? Dr. von Eschenbach. Senator, if I can just address that, and I'll attempt to do it succinctly, but I need to compartmentalize this very complex issue into some parts. With regard to the initial application and the difference of opinion that occurred with regard to the scientific review and the Advisory Committee recommendation, I completely concur with the decision that was made at that time by the director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. In looking at that data, although in--overall, across all age groups, the data indicated that this drug could be used properly and safely in a nonprescription form, that data did not apply equally to all of the subsets of women within that study. And, in fact, the amount of data and information that was available for young girls, who were 12, 13, 14, 15 years of age, was really inadequate in which to draw a decision. And, because of the concern about not being able to understand how to use this emergency contraceptive properly, and because of the concern that without medical supervision in abuse that would, in fact, create safety issues or concerns, as compared to older, adult women who are more mature and able to make decisions, he did not move forward with the approval of that application. And I concur with that decision. That resulted, then, in the reapplication by the company with regard to this bifurcation of prescription versus nonprescription. And that opened up a different set of questions. Senator Kennedy. I don't want to interrupt, but I will, just on this point, quickly, because my time is up. The GAO report says that there are no age-related marketing restrictions for safety reasons for any of the prescriptions of OTC that FDA has approved. I don't know whether you're familiar with that finding that they had in there. It was just related to your comment. Dr. von Eschenbach. I---- Senator Kennedy. I'm---- Dr. von Eschenbach. I apologize. I'll---- Senator Kennedy. No, that's okay. Dr. von Eschenbach [continuing]. Be more succinct. Senator Kennedy. Do you want to just continue---- Dr. von Eschenbach. Well, I--to that point, what I hope to rapidly communicate is the fact that there are issues related to age within this group, and what the advance notice for proposed rulemaking commentary provided was additional information that made it possible to make a decision now that couldn't be made when that first came before the FDA, when the company amended their application. Senator Kennedy. Thank you. My time's up, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Senator Isakson. Senator Isakson. Dr. von Eschenbach, I don't often have the occasion to make a decision on someone having had experience in working with them, but, in your case, I do. And I thought I would open my questions, really, with a statement for you to respond to. About, I guess it was 9 months ago, or very shortly after you became Acting Commissioner, an incident came up--three incidents came up with regard to Tysabri. And the decision was made to pull that drug off the market. For the edification of the people here, Tysabri is a breakthrough drug for multiple sclerosis that had had remarkable success, and was actually bettering the lives of many people who felt like their life was about gone. Because of a doctor in Atlanta, and because of friends of mine who suffer from MS, I had a working knowledge of the benefits, and had seen, firsthand, those benefits. And when the FDA pulled the drug off, because of three particular incidents of death, it concerned me greatly, and it concerned them greatly, because, for them, the only way to stay alive was Tysabri. I brought this to your attention. And if my recollection is clear, in less than 4 months, maybe 5 months, you and the Agency worked through all the research you had to do, and Tysabri is now back on the market, with particular protocols for the physicians and the patients. My understanding is that that was a record time for the FDA to respond in such an incident. So, I want to, first of all, say thank you, on behalf of thousands of MS patients in the United States, for your quick response. And, second, have you addressed that particular process? Dr. von Eschenbach. Thank you very much, Senator. And I think your question points out the principle that guided that decision, as well as the one we have just been discussing, and that is to find that correct balance between protecting and promoting public health. In the case of Tysabri, the deaths that occurred were totally unexpected, and had not been anticipated as to be associated with that particular drug. And in order to protect the public health, the drug was voluntarily withdrawn until we could get additional information and until we could put in place processes that would then allow us to reintroduce that drug to provide that lifesaving intervention for those unfortunate patients with multiple sclerosis, while, at the same time, having safeguards in place that could then assure their protection, as well. Once we arrived at that point, and working judiciously because of the severe problem that MS presents, we were able to arrive at a place where we believe now, it's back on the market with restraints and constraints that protect health, while also providing lifesaving intervention. And that principle and that process will guide all of the decisions that we make at FDA. Senator Isakson. Well, again, I want to thank you on behalf of those people that suffer with MS that are benefiting from the prescription of the Tysabri, and thank you for your swift action as Acting Commissioner. Just so Mr. DeCamp doesn't go to sleep when everybody's talking about Plan B and asking you questions, I probably ought to ask Mr. DeCamp a question. Are you an attorney, sir? Mr. DeCamp. Yes, I am, Senator. Senator Isakson. I did not get to read everything. What was your most recent private-sector responsibility as attorney? What type of an attorney were you? Mr. DeCamp. I worked as ``of counsel'' with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, focusing on labor and employment law and appellate matters, with an emphasis on wage and hour work. Senator Isakson. Very good. Are you familiar with the Senate version of the immigration reform bill that passed the Senate? Mr. DeCamp. I have not reviewed the legislation yet. I've read what's in the papers about it. Senator Isakson. OK. Well, at some point in time--I'm not going to put you on the spot, then, but I would like, if I can, Mr. Chairman, to ask you to--I'll send you a formal request, but I think the issues over the application of Davis-Bacon and the Senate immigration bill that passed raises significant questions in terms of a reach of its application beyond its original intent, and I'd like to know--from your standpoint as a labor lawyer, and from your professional opinion--what you think of that. So, I'll submit that to you in writing, rather than catch you having not read it and then try and get you to make a decision. But I would like to have your input on that. Mr. DeCamp. Yes, Senator. [Editors Note: The information previously referred to was not available at time of print.] Senator Isakson. That's all I have, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you. As you can tell, I'm following the past practice of hearing from those that are here at the sound of the gavel, then by arrival following that. So, Senator Mikulski, you'd be next. Senator Mikulski. Mr. Chairman, did you say in how we arrived, or by seniority? The Chairman. It's by how you arrived at the sound of the gavel and then after. Senator Mikulski. I think my colleagues at the other---- The Chairman. I---- Senator Mikulski. First of all, I'd love to have my time now, but-- [Laughter.] The Chairman [continuing]. I thought---- Senator Mikulski [continuing]. But I don't want to---- The Chairman [continuing]. I thought the four of you---- Senator Mikulski [continuing]. Go in front of my colleagues. The Chairman [continuing]. Were here at the sound of the gavel. Senator Murray. We always cede to our Senator Mikulski. [Laughter.] Senator Mikulski. Well, then, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And my question goes to the fact that I sit here as the very proud and enthusiastic Senator representing FDA. FDA is in my State. And there is over 10,000 very, very earnest and dedicated employees, and, over the years, who have fought for working on a bipartisan basis, the right facilities for these employees, working with Senator Hatch to make sure that employees that were working in 39 different spots, some converted hotel/motel rooms, could be in--consolidated at a realigned military base--and we've done that on a bipartisan basis--worked to create, on a bipartisan basis, the Office of Woman's Health with Senator Snowe, and also to be able to support the employees. But, Dr. Eschenbach, as I spoke to you yesterday and before, FDA's in crisis. There is a crisis of morale, there is now a crisis of confidence in the reliability of FDA decisions, there is a crisis about are there the scientists operating under a gag rule, putting politics above science, and there is a crisis ensuring the reliability and the safety of our drugs. My questions today to you are, while your--you have a compelling personal narrative and a compelling background of professionalism and competence, but we need plans, and we need commitments. If one looks at where we are now--let's just take the issue of morale. There are--the Union of Concerned Scientists have surveyed FDA and said the scientists are hemorrhaging, they're leaving your agency, because they don't know if they have a future where they can put their talents together, there are over 100 whistleblower cases pending from your agency, 100 scientific whistleblower cases. What do you intend to do about the morale? And, No. 2, do I have your commitment that you will not politicize the scientific decisions at FDA? And what would be your plans for doing so? Dr. von Eschenbach. Thank you very much, Senator. And I would like to address this issue of morale by first thanking you and Senator Hatch, as well as other Members of the Congress, for the tremendous support of the White Oak consolidation for FDA, because, although that--views possess important---- Senator Mikulski. I only have a very few minutes, let's get to the answers. You can thank me later. [Laughter.] Dr. von Eschenbach. Well, the issue there is, it's a morale improvement to bring the Agency together for greater integration and sharing, which is one of my strategies. Second, within that integration and sharing, to create the climate for vigorous scientific debate in which, when there is a difference of opinion, we have in place guidances and processes for refutation, including an ombudsman process, so that we can surface that difference of opinion and not have that become an issue in which people fear that they will be penalized for voicing that opinion appropriately within the context of that vigorous scientific debate. Attention to our workforce is my No. 1 priority. It is the most precious asset that FDA has. And improving and enhancing retention and recruitment opportunities, career-development opportunities, will also address morale. Senator Mikulski. Let's come back to the concern about being stifled and under a gag rule for presenting views. Would you consider establishing, kind of, a back-channel, dissent channel, where employees who have concern that perhaps mid- level people, or even political employees at FDA, would be unduly exercising improper influence, and that you would have a dissent channel that would come directly to you, or so that you would be aware of what they say and what their concerns would be, so that they could be properly addressed? Dr. von Eschenbach. Yes, Senator, I would. And that is parallel with the experience that I had, as Senator Hutchison alluded to, in being the chief academic officer at a very large, complex academic institution where that kind of scientific debate and difference of opinion is part and parcel of what we do. And to allow a mechanism for adjudication of differences, to allow, where there are grievances and concerns about the process, to have a pathway forward to the senior leadership and to, in fact, I---- Senator Mikulski. So, what I'm suggesting---- Dr. von Eschenbach [continuing]. Would be there. Senator Mikulski [continuing]. Is not in lieu of the normal personnel adjudication, but it's often too slow and too frustrating. Let me, then, get to drug safety. Your predecessor did not see the need for an independent drug-safety board, yet Senator Grassley, myself, Senator Dodd, others, feel that they should. You're familiar with the cases, the antidepressants around children, there was--Andrew Mosholder raised flashing yellow lights, they were ignored--the Vioxx issue, the Ketek issue, the defibrillator issue. So, my question to you is, What do you--and when I talked to Dr. Crawford, he said he was going to have a board, but it wasn't going to report directly to him, because it dealt with personnel and budget, and he didn't think that was his job. I was a little surprised at that. How do you intend to ensure--what would you see, the way of ensuring drug safety, and also the safety of medical devices that are so important and are part of our innovation economy? What mechanisms would you see? And do you see the need for new legislation? Or do you believe you can do this with the administrative authority that you have? Dr. von Eschenbach. I believe I can accomplish this with the administrative authority I currently have, to put in place a system that would include the incorporation of principles in critical path that have tools, scientific tools, to be able to determine safety of these new products and interventions before they are ever introduced into patients, to have processes internally within our review mechanisms, based on the modern information technology where we can---- Senator Mikulski. Well, what do you see? Do you see a drug safety board within FDA, or do you see one outside of FDA? Dr. von Eschenbach. I see using the current mechanisms that are already present within FDA, including the fact that we have a drug safety board, that includes other members outside of the FDA, within the Federal Government, who can engage in these confidential discussions and really provide some additional oversight. And then, once the drug is approved, we need to continue that safety---- Senator Mikulski. Well, that's the post-marketing issue, but there's been a GAO report on postmarketing that talks about the Office of New Drugs and the Office of Drug Safety. And the GAO found it woefully lacking. You see, our concern is that what is now at FDA hasn't been working. Now, this is not a hearing to fingerpoint, it is the hearing to pinpoint that. And I really don't know if FDA is capable of having a board within itself. I really don't know. All I'm interested in is that we be the gold standard for not only our own country; it's what you and I talked about on the phone. Dr. von Eschenbach. Yes. Senator Mikulski. All over the world, there are people that are going to take drugs that were invented in America, and they've got to know that it's okay. Dr. von Eschenbach. Well, what I'd like to assure you of, Senator, is, this is my highest priority, and it will not be one thing, but it will be a number of things that I am committed to do to bring the Agency on a modern basis of management and infrastructure that'll enable us to address the issue of safety in multiple ways and in multiple parts and components. The integration, I talked to earlier. And so, this will be a systemic--or a systematic approach to safety that's going to be comprehensive, and I'm absolutely committed to it, as you are. Senator Mikulski. Is my time up? The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Hatch. Senator Hatch. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. DeCamp, you're--I'm not going to ask you any questions--you're certainly highly qualified, and--I've looked at your resume and your background, and you certainly have all that it takes to do this job, and more, in my opinion. Dr. von Eschenbach, you're one of my favorite people. There's no question that you have the qualifications to be FDA head. It was well over a decade ago when we passed the FDA Revitalization Act to create the White Oak campus, and I am so grateful to Senator Mikulski and others on this committee and throughout the Congress for working with us to get that finally up and running. But let me just ask you this. When is the completion of the campus expected? And how much money is it going to cost? Dr. von Eschenbach. I cannot give you at this moment, Senator, the final cost. And I'm anticipating that opening-- completion will be occurring around 2011-2012. Senator Hatch. See, if we had done that right off the bat, it would have been completed by now. And, of course, we wouldn't have these 39 different locations, with supervisors traveling in between and losing all that time and efficiency. Dr. von Eschenbach. I would comment, Senator, that GSA has been extraordinarily cooperative and is working extremely hard in--to keep that on a very accelerated---- Senator Hatch. I don't blame---- Dr. von Eschenbach [continuing]. Timeline. Senator Hatch [continuing]. GSA. I blame us, up here. I think we didn't put the funds up, when we should have done that. I agree with Senator Kennedy, this is one of the most important agencies in any government anywhere. The health of our people depends a great deal on what you do. Ten years ago, the Dietary Supplemental, Health, and Education Act authorized the FDA to develop GMPs, or good manufacturing practice standards, specific to dietary supplements. And I recognize that the law did not require you to do so, but it did allow this process to begin. And we were greatly heartened that FDA began to develop dietary supplement GMPs. Now, that's the good news. The bad news is that somewhere over 10 years ago, DSHEA authorized the FDA to develop GMPs for dietary supplements, and we have not yet seen them published. Now, it's my understanding that the HHS-approved GMP regs were forwarded to OMB for final clearance during the Clinton administration. And shortly after President Bush was elected, my office received a call from a senior HHS official stating that HHS is going to make certain that GMP regulations were exempted from the general freeze on pending regulations so that the new administration could review them and allow them to proceed forward. Over the past 4 years, we've had numerous reports that the regulations were going forward, but they still have not been published. Accordingly, I'd like to know the following about the status of these regulations. Have they been cleared in final form by the FDA? Have they been cleared in final form by HHS? What specific issues remain outstanding so that these regulations may be finalized, if they haven't? And when will the regulations be published? What date certain can be--can we be assured that the regulations will have been finalized? Can you tell me a little bit about that? Dr. von Eschenbach. The regulation has cleared the FDA, Senator, and is at OMB for their analysis and review. FDA is committed to working very closely with OMB about any issues or questions they raise so that we can facilitate this coming to its final conclusion and closure, because, like you, we are very committed to the important role that dietary supplements can play in promoting health and well-being of Americans, and want to assure their safety and the quality of their manufacturing and their labeling so that Americans can use them safely and appropriately. Senator Hatch. Well, the responsible people in that industry want to have this done, and they want to be able to have the benefits that come from having GMPs guiding them. And I think it's critical that we do that, because we've had an explosion in dietary supplement development and manufacture since the DSHEA was enacted, and it's just really critical that we do that. Let me just ask one other question, and that is--I wouldn't mind hearing you talk about your goals as FDA Commissioner. And I'd like to know about what you've been thinking your priorities will be as FDA Commissioner. I think that would be helpful to us all. Dr. von Eschenbach. Well, thank you, Senator. I think I can most easily describe them as falling into two parts. One, and most important issue at present, is to put the FDA on a modern management infrastructure where I would make certain that we were carrying out our processes and activities in the most efficient and effective way, that we were utilizing our resources with great stewardship, and maximizing their impact. And, at the same time, the other issue is to continue to advance initiatives like the Critical Path for Personalized Medicine, to bring new modern scientific tools and technologies into the regulatory process so that we can address many of the complex issues that are emerging out of these new opportunities. Senator Hatch. Well, thank you. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate this time. I appreciate you and Senator Kennedy holding this hearing, and I hope that we can push this nominee through. We need an absolute head at the FDA, and it would mean a lot to, I think, the country, to everybody concerned. And I would appreciate any efforts that all of us here on this committee can make. The Chairman. Thank you. And as a former chairman, I always appreciate the careful work that you do in the hearings, as well as prior and after. Thank you. Senator Murray. Senator Murray. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. DeCamp, I do have questions and concerns. I hope that I can get to them. I'm not going to ignore you entirely. But, Dr. von Eschenbach, let me start by just saying that I echo the concerns of several of my colleagues that have talked about the deep crisis that's in the FDA because of the lack of decisionmaking. We've worked very hard, on this committee, to put in place predictability for consumers, so they know, when they purchase a drug, that it is, based on science, safe and effective; that the scientists themselves who work at FDA know that, when their work is done in a scientific manner, that it will be accepted that way; certainly, for the manufacturers, who spend millions of dollars getting to the point where they've brought a drug to you, know that predictability is going to be based on science. So, Plan B is, sort of--you're hearing a l"
