BUSINESS\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWe are a biotechnology and human healthcare company that develops innovative\n\nproducts and provides services for major unmet medical needs. We were founded as\n\na Delaware corporation in June 1981 and became a Massachusetts corporation in\n\n1991. We currently have three operating divisions. Each of our divisions has a\n\nrelated series of common stock that is intended to reflect its value and track\n\nits financial performance. Our three divisions are:\n\n- Genzyme General, which develops and markets therapeutic products and\n\ndiagnostic products and services with an emphasis on genetic disorders and\n\nother chronic debilitating diseases with well-defined patient populations.\n\nGenzyme General Stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the\n\nsymbol \"GENZ.\"\n\n- Genzyme Biosurgery, which develops and markets instruments, devices,\n\nbiomaterials and biotherapeutic products to improve or replace surgery,\n\nwith an emphasis on the orthopaedics and cardiothoracic markets.\n\nBiosurgery Stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol\n\n\"GZBX.\"\n\n- Genzyme Molecular Oncology, which is utilizing its functional genomics and\n\nantigen discovery technology platforms to develop novel cancer products\n\nfocused on cancer vaccines and angiogenesis inhibitors, and to generate\n\npartnering revenue. Molecular Oncology Stock is listed on the Nasdaq\n\nNational Market under the symbol \"GZMO.\"\n\nWe allocate all of our products, services, programs, assets and liabilities\n\namong our divisions for purposes of financial statement presentation; however,\n\nGenzyme, the corporation, continues to own all of the assets and is responsible\n\nfor all of the liabilities allocated to each of the divisions.\n\nGENZYME GENERAL--PRODUCTS AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\n\nGenzyme General primarily consists of our Therapeutics and Diagnostics\n\nbusiness units and our wholly-owned subsidiary GelTex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,\n\nwhich we acquired in December 2000. The Therapeutics business unit focuses on\n\ndeveloping and marketing products for genetic diseases and other chronic\n\ndebilitating diseases, including a family of diseases known as lysosomal storage\n\ndiseases, and specialty therapeutics. The Diagnostics business unit develops,\n\nmarkets and distributes IN VITRO diagnostic products and genetic testing\n\nservices. GelTex develops non-absorbed polymer drugs that bind and eliminate\n\ntargeted substances in the gastrointestinal track and small-molecule\n\npharmaceuticals consisting of novel polyamine analogues and metal chelators.\n\nTHERAPEUTICS\n\nGenzyme General's Therapeutics business unit currently has three therapeutic\n\nproducts on the market and several other therapeutic products in varying stages\n\nof development. Genzyme General also sells synthetic phospholipids, synthetic\n\npeptides and amino acid derivatives, which are used in research as raw materials\n\nfor pharmaceutical manufacturers. It also produces and sells bulk hyaluronan for\n\na number of applications. Under an agreement with Alcon Laboratories, Inc.,\n\nGenzyme General supplies pharmaceutical grade hyaluronan powder to Alcon for\n\nincorporation into Provisc-Registered Trademark-, an ophthalmic\n\n5\n\nsurgical aid product. In addition, hyaluronan is sold to a number of customers\n\nfor various research and development applications.\n\nPRODUCT INDICATION STATUS LICENSOR\n\n- ---------------------------------------- ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------\n\nCEREZYME-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- Type I Gaucher disease Ceredase-Registered Trademark- None\n\n(IMIGLUCERASE FOR INJECTION) AND marketed since 1991;\n\nCEREDASE-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- Cerezyme-Registered Trademark-\n\n(ALGLUCERASE FOR INJECTION) marketed since 1994;\n\navailable in over 55\n\ncountries\n\nRENAGEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- (SEVELAMER Reduction of serum Marketed since 1998; None*\n\nHYDROCHLORIDE) phosphorus in patients approved in the U.S. in\n\nwith end-stage renal 1998, Israel in 1999\n\ndisease on hemodialysis and in Europe in 2000\n\nTHYROGEN-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- Adjunctive diagnostic Marketed since 1998; None\n\n(THYROTROPIN ALFA FOR INJECTION) agent in the follow-up approved in the U.S. in\n\nof patients with well- 1998, in Puerto Rico in\n\ndifferentiated thyroid 1999 and in Europe,\n\ncancer Israel and Brazil in\n\n2000\n\nFABRAZYME-TM- (AFGALSIDASE BETA FOR Fabry disease BLA submitted to the Mt.

Treatment with Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- or\n\nCeredase-Registered Trademark- enzyme replacement therapy currently represents\n\nthe only safe and effective treatment available for Type I Gaucher disease, a\n\nlysosomal storage disease. We entered the market in 1991 with\n\nCeredase-Registered Trademark- enzyme. Because production of\n\nCeredase-Registered Trademark- enzyme was subject to supply constraints, we\n\ndeveloped Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme, a recombinant form of human\n\nbeta glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme that is deficient in Gaucher patients.\n\nRecombinant technology uses specially engineered cells to produce enzymes, or\n\nother substances, by inserting into cells of one organism the genetic material\n\nof a different species. In the case of Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme,\n\nChinese hamster ovary cells are engineered to produce human beta\n\nglucocerebrosidase. We stopped producing Ceredase-Registered Trademark- enzyme,\n\nexcept for small quantities, in 1998 after substantially all patients who\n\npreviously used Ceredase-Registered Trademark- enzyme were converted to\n\nCerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme.\n\nGenzyme General is marketing these products directly to physicians,\n\nhospitals and treatment centers worldwide through a highly trained sales force.\n\nThis marketing effort is directed at identifying and initiating treatment for\n\nthe estimated 5,000 to 10,000 Gaucher patients Genzyme General believes exist\n\nworldwide. Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- enzyme is currently distributed in\n\nover 55 countries worldwide. Our results of operations are highly dependent on\n\nsales of these products. Sales of Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- and\n\nCeredase-Registered Trademark- enzymes totaled approximately $536.9 million in\n\n2000, which represented approximately 66% of our consolidated revenue in that\n\nyear. Sales of these products totaled approximately $478.4 million, or 70% of\n\nour consolidated revenue, in 1999 and approximately $411.0 million, or 67% of\n\nour consolidated revenue, in 1998.\n\nRENAGEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- (SEVELAMER\n\nHYDROCHLORIDE). Renagel-Registered Trademark- capsules and tablets are used for\n\nthe reduction of serum phosphorus in patients with end-stage renal disease on\n\nhemodialysis. There are an estimated 280,000 end-stage renal disease patients in\n\nthe United States, approximately 95% of whom receive a phosphate control\n\nproduct. There are also an estimated 170,000 end-stage renal disease patients in\n\nEurope. Genzyme General is marketing Renagel-Registered Trademark- capsules and\n\ntablets directly to nephrologists, renal dieticians and payors through a\n\ndedicated sales force. The launch of the tablet formulation in September 2000\n\nwas intended to help nephrologists manage patients into the normal serum\n\nphosphorus range. Sales of Renagel-Registered Trademark- capsules and tablets\n\ntotaled approximately $56.0 million in 2000 and approximately $19.5 million in\n\n1999.\n\n7\n\nGenzyme General believes that the worldwide opportunity for\n\nRenagel-Registered Trademark- capsules and tablets is greater than originally\n\nanticipated. It expects that at least four fundamental factors will contribute\n\nto the growth of this product opportunity:\n\n- the establishment of the Renagel-Registered Trademark- products as a\n\npreferred first-line treatment for dialysis patients;\n\n- appropriate adjustment of daily doses of the Renagel-Registered Trademark-\n\nproducts by physicians to lower patient phosphorus levels into the normal\n\nrange and improve patient compliance;\n\n- substantial growth in the dialysis patient population, which Genzyme\n\nGeneral estimates is currently approximately 1 million people worldwide\n\nand expects to reach approximately 1.7 million by 2009; and\n\n- the potential for the Renagel-Registered Trademark- products to lower the\n\noverall cost of caring for dialysis patients.\n\nGenzyme General is taking several steps to support its belief about the market\n\npotential for these products. Genzyme General is currently conducting a\n\nthree-year study comparing Renagel-Registered Trademark- capsules to the\n\nstandard calcium binders. It also initiated a 2,000-patient study designed to\n\ndemonstrate the ability of the products to improve patient morbidity and\n\nmortality in 2001.\n\nTHYROGEN-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- (THYROTROPIN ALFA FOR\n\nINJECTION). Thyrogen-Registered Trademark- hormone was developed by Genzyme\n\nGeneral to allow patients to continue taking their thyroid hormone supplements\n\nwhile they are being screened for residual of recurring thyroid cancer. This\n\nallows patients to avoid the debilitating effects of hypothyroidism. In the\n\nUnited States, physicians order approximately 135,000 thyroglobulin tests and\n\n25,000 radioiodine imaging whole body scans each year for thyroid cancer\n\npatients. Genzyme General is marketing Thyrogen-Registered Trademark- hormone in\n\nthe United States through a direct sales force. Brazil has the highest incidence\n\nof thyroid cancer in the developed world, outside of the United States.\n\nPhysicians order approximately 28,000 thyroglobulin tests and 12,000 radioiodine\n\nimaging whole body scans each year in Brazil for thyroid cancer patients.\n\nBiobras S.A. exclusively distributes and markets the product in Brazil.\n\nFABRAZYME-TM- (ALGALSIDASE BETA FOR INJECTION). Genzyme General is\n\ndeveloping Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme, a recombinant form of the human enzyme\n\nalpha-galactosidase, as a treatment for Fabry disease. Fabry disease is a\n\nlysosomal storage disease that is estimated to affect 1 in 40,000 males\n\nworldwide, with an estimated 2,000 to 4,000 patients worldwide. We filed for\n\nmarketing approval for Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme in the United States and in Europe\n\nin 2000. We also began treating patients in France with Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme\n\nunder an Authorisation Temporaire d'Utilisation from the French Medicines\n\nAgency, which allows patients in France to receive treatment before marketing\n\nauthorization for the therapy is granted in the European Union.\n\nIn March 2001, the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, commonly\n\nreferred to as the CPMP, issued a positive opinion of our Marketing\n\nAuthorization Application for Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme for Fabry disease. The\n\nproposed labeling recommended by the CPMP includes the following indication:\n\n\"Fabrazyme-TM- is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients\n\nwith a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease (galactosidase A deficiency).\" The\n\nCPMP is the scientific body composed of representatives from the 15 member\n\nstates of the European Union that provides advice to the European Medicines\n\nEvaluation Agency, commonly referred to as the EMEA, on the approval of\n\nmedicinal products.\n\nWe are currently preparing a response to the FDA's request for additional\n\ndata and clarification related to our Biologics License Application for\n\nFabrazyme-TM- enzyme. We expect action on the U.S. regulatory submissions this\n\nyear. In addition, Genzyme General initiated a phase 4 trial of Fabrazyme-TM-\n\nenzyme in January 2001, which is required under the FDA's accelerated approval\n\nmechanism.\n\nALDURAZYME-TM- (LARONIDASE FOR INJECTION). Genzyme General and BioMarin\n\nhave formed a joint venture to develop Aldurazyme-TM- enzyme, a recombinant form\n\nof the human enzyme\n\n8\n\nalpha-L-iduronidase, to treat a lysosomal storage disease known as\n\nmucopolysaccharidosis I, or MPS-I. Approximately 2,000 to 3,000 people in the\n\ndeveloped world have been diagnosed with MPS-I. BioMarin has completed a phase\n\n1-2 trial of Aldurazyme-TM- enzyme, and the joint venture initiated a\n\nconfirmatory phase 3 trial in December 2000, which is expected to conclude in\n\nthe third quarter of 2001.\n\nAVONEX-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- (INTERFERON-BETA 1A). In September 1998, we\n\nentered into an agreement with Biogen Inc. under which Genzyme General will\n\ncommercialize and, following regulatory approval, exclusively distribute\n\nAVONEX-Registered Trademark- in Japan. AVONEX-Registered Trademark- is Biogen's\n\ntreatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Genzyme General is managing\n\nthe clinical development program for AVONEX-Registered Trademark- in Japan and\n\nis working to obtain registration and reimbursement approvals for the product.\n\nGenzyme General estimates that there are at least 5,000 multiple sclerosis\n\npatients in Japan.\n\nALPHA-GLUCOSIDASE. Genzyme General and Pharming Group N.V. are developing a\n\nrecombinant form of the human enzyme alpha-glucosidase produced in Chinese\n\nhamster ovary cells for the treatment of Pompe disease. Pompe disease is a\n\nlysosomal storage disease that is estimated to affect between 5,000 to 10,000\n\npeople worldwide. We licensed this product from Synpac (North Carolina), Inc. in\n\nMarch 2000. Genzyme General and Pharming expect to initiate a phase 2 trial of\n\nthis product in infants in 2001.\n\nNEUROCELL-TM--PD. Genzyme General and Diacrin, Inc. are developing\n\nNeuroCell-TM--PD for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. NeuroCell-TM--PD is a\n\ncellular approach that involves the transplantation of porcine fetal neural\n\ncells to attempt to replace cells lost to disease. We have completed a\n\npreliminary analysis of results from the phase 2 trial of NeuroCell-TM--PD.\n\nPatients were evaluated at baseline and at three-month intervals for at least\n\n18 months following surgery using a broad range of clinical measurements. The\n\ntrial's primary endpoint was the difference between the treated group and the\n\ncontrol group in the change in total score on the Unified Parkinson's Disease\n\nRating Scale in the off state (more than 12 hours since last medication)\n\nobtained pre-operatively and 18 months after surgery. Both the treatment group\n\nand the control group, on average, showed improvement from baseline. There was\n\nno difference, however, between the treatment and the control group. Genzyme\n\nGeneral and Diacrin expect to complete additional analysis of the phase 2 data\n\nas quickly as possible and to reach a decision within a few months whether to\n\nproceed with additional clinical studies of NeuroCell-TM--PD. Based on the\n\npreliminary analysis of the trial results and the need for additional analysis,\n\na phase 3 trial of NeuroCell-TM--PD will not be initiated before June 30, 2001.\n\nUnder the terms of the transfer agreement between Genzyme General and Genzyme\n\nBiosurgery, Genzyme General, at its election, may require Genzyme Biosurgery to\n\nreturn to Genzyme General a $20.0 million prepayment. This refund, together with\n\naccrued interest, will be due within 90 days of receipt of Genzyme General's\n\nnotice of its election. This payment may be made in cash, Biosurgery designated\n\nshares, or a combination of both, at Genzyme Biosurgery's option. Biosurgery\n\ndesignated shares are authorized but unissued shares of Biosurgery Stock that\n\ncan be sold or distributed for the benefit of Genzyme General without allocating\n\nany of the proceeds to Genzyme Biosurgery.\n\nANTI-THROMBIN III. Genzyme General and Genzyme Transgenics Corporation\n\nformed a joint venture in 1998 for the development and commercialization of\n\nrecombinant human antithrombin III, also known as rhATIII, a protein naturally\n\nproduced by the body that, when bound to heparin, prevents blood clotting.\n\nGenzyme General and Genzyme Transgenics were developing transgenically-produced\n\nrhATIII through the joint venture to restore heparin sensitivity in\n\nheparin-resistant patients undergoing elective heart surgery requiring pulmonary\n\nbypass. Transgenic proteins are produced by inserting human DNA into animal\n\ncells so that the target protein, or drug, is secreted into the milk of female\n\noffspring during lactation. Representatives of the joint venture held a meeting\n\nwith the FDA in February 2001 to discuss the status of the clinical development\n\nprogram for rhATIII. As a result of this meeting, Genzyme Transgenics announced\n\nthat the joint venture no longer expected to actively pursue additional\n\ndevelopment of rhATIII for this indication due to the level of expense and time\n\ninvolved in developing\n\n9\n\nthe additional data required by the FDA, which was not justified by the\n\npotential market size of the heparin resistance indication.\n\nDIAGNOSTICS\n\nDIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS\n\nGenzyme General develops, markets and distributes IN VITRO diagnostic\n\nproducts, with an emphasis on point-of-care, clinical chemistry and rapid test\n\nproducts. Genzyme General sells its diagnostic products through its technical\n\nsales representatives in the United States and Europe and through distributors\n\nin Japan.\n\nCARDIOVASCULAR PRODUCTS. Genzyme General sells devices and reagents for the\n\nmeasurement of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, and high-density lipoprotein, or\n\nHDL, cholesterol levels. Genzyme General's N-geneous-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- LDL\n\nand Liquid N-geneous-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- HDL tests measure cholesterol levels\n\ndirectly without the labor intensive pretreatment steps that were previously\n\nneeded and are easily adaptable to automated chemistry analyzers.\n\nN-geneous-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- LDL was the first homogenous LDL test available\n\nfor sale in the United States. Both tests are being distributed in the United\n\nStates by Genzyme General under an agreement with the manufacturer of the tests,\n\nDaiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Ltd., of Tokyo. In addition to the United States,\n\nGenzyme General is also the exclusive marketing partner for the\n\nN-geneous-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- LDL and Liquid N-geneous-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-\n\nHDL tests in Europe and the rest of the world, with the exception of Asia, where\n\nwe hold co-exclusive distribution rights.\n\nGLYPRO-TM- TEST. Genzyme General's GlyPro-TM- test is a tool for monitoring\n\ndiabetes. The GlyPro-TM- test measures blood sugar levels over two to three\n\nweeks, which is a valuable resource for reducing diabetes-related complications.\n\nTest results supplement the \"snap shot\" view provided by daily glucose\n\nmonitoring, enabling physicians to more accurately understand and guide the\n\ndiabetic patient behavior.\n\nRAPID TESTS. Genzyme General's product portfolio includes patented\n\nContrast-Registered Trademark- rapid tests for pregnancy, Strep A, infectious\n\nmononucleosis and GIARDIA/CRYTOSPORIDIUM determination. It also introduced the\n\nfirst combination rapid test for the two most common causes of parasitic\n\nintestinal disease.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC INTERMEDIATES. Genzyme General produces and sells intermediates\n\nsuch as diagnostic enzymes, substrates and reagents for use in diagnostic kits\n\nused for sample analysis in clinical chemistry laboratories. One area of\n\nemphasis is pancreatic function, where Genzyme General provides enzymes,\n\nsubstrates, bulk reagents, finished devices and patented methodologies for\n\namylase and lipase determination to diagnostic kit manufacturers. Genzyme\n\nGeneral is also a primary supplier of cholesterol enzymes used in testing for\n\ncoronary heart disease.\n\nDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. Genzyme General and SYN-X Pharma Inc. are\n\ncollaborating on a point of care product called NeuroTrack-TM--SmartStroke-TM-\n\nto aid in the diagnosis and differentiate stroke patients. SYN-X and Genzyme are\n\ndeveloping the product, and Genzyme General will exclusively manufacture and\n\nmarket the product worldwide following approval. Stroke is the third leading\n\ncause of death in the United States, affecting approximately 700,000 people\n\nannually, with a similar incidence in Europe. Approximately 150,000 Americans\n\ndie as a result of stroke each year.\n\nGenzyme General is also developing point-of-care products for infectious\n\ndiseases. Other development programs include a homocysteine test to determine\n\ncardiovascular disease risk and a liquid lipase test for pancreatitis.\n\nGENETIC DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES\n\nGenzyme General applies advanced biotechnology to develop and provide high\n\nquality, sophisticated genetic diagnostic services in the United States and\n\ninternationally through a national\n\n10\n\nnetwork of laboratories and a direct sales force as well as through joint\n\nventures in Germany and Japan. Genzyme General offers three types of genetic\n\ndiagnostic services:\n\n- biochemical testing services, which consist primarily of a widely used\n\nscreening test known as AFP3-Registered Trademark- to determine if further\n\nprenatal genetic testing is appropriate;\n\n- classical and molecular cytogenetic testing services, which involve the\n\nanalysis of fetal cells obtained through amniocentesis or a process known\n\nas chorionic villi sampling to evaluate chromosomal abnormalities; and\n\n- DNA testing, which is performed to determine the likelihood that the\n\npatient has, or is a carrier of, a specific genetic disorder, such as\n\ncystic fibrosis and/or Gaucher disease.\n\nGenzyme General employs over 70 board certified genetics professionals who\n\ninterpret results and provide genetic counseling and support services to medical\n\npractitioners and their patients.\n\nIn July 2000, we entered into an agreement with Healtheon/WebMD that allows\n\nGenzyme General's customer network of approximately 5,000 clinicians to use an\n\napplication located on WebMD's internet site to order laboratory tests and\n\nacquire test results. Our customer network includes obstetricians,\n\nperinatologists, geneticists, pediatricians, hematologists and oncologists. The\n\narrangement with Healtheon/WebMD offers convenience and secure access to medical\n\nprofessionals who use Genzyme General's genetic testing services.\n\nWe have described some of Genzyme General's genetic diagnostic tests and\n\ndevelopment programs below.\n\nAFP4-SM- TEST. Genzyme General added this advanced screening test to its\n\ncomprehensive prenatal genetic services program during the fourth quarter of\n\n1999. This test is more accurate than the AFP3-Registered Trademark- test in\n\ndetecting mutations associated with fetal risk of Down Syndrome, and other\n\ngenetic defects.\n\nINSIGHT-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- TEST. Genzyme General's\n\nInSight-Registered Trademark- test is a cytogenetic test to be used as an\n\nadjunct to traditional chromosome analysis that permits identification of the\n\nmost frequently occurring chromosomal abnormalities within 48 hours, which is\n\nsignificantly faster than the one to three weeks required to perform classical\n\ncytogenetic testing (karyotyping). The InSight-Registered Trademark- analysis is\n\nprovided in conjunction with a complete karyotype.\n\nMASDA-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- SERVICE. Genzyme General's patented multiplex\n\nallele-specific diagnostic assay, which is known as the\n\nMASDA-Registered Trademark- Service, can analyze in a single test up to 500 DNA\n\nsamples simultaneously for over 100 known gene mutations. The\n\nMASDA-Registered Trademark- Service not only analyzes different patient samples\n\nfor different disease indications in a single test, it also identifies multiple\n\nmutations in one or more genes in a single patient's DNA sample. Genzyme General\n\nis pursuing a number of commercialization strategies for the\n\nMASDA-Registered Trademark- Service. In addition, the\n\nMASDA-Registered Trademark- Service is also being used to provide genetic\n\nprofiling services for clinical trials being conducted by pharmaceutical\n\ncompanies.\n\nHEREDITARY NONPOLYPOSIS COLON CANCER. Genzyme General introduced a test\n\nthat screens for mutations associated with the most common form of hereditary\n\ncolon cancer, hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, which is also known as Lynch\n\nSyndrome. Lynch Syndrome accounts for between approximately three and six\n\npercent of all colorectal cancers in the United States, or an estimated 4,000 to\n\n8,000 cases every year.\n\nADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS COLI. Genzyme General's APC I1307K test screens for a\n\ngene mutation associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer in\n\nAshkenazi Jewish families. The specific gene mutation occurs more frequently in\n\nthis population and has been found in approximately 28% of Ashkenazi Jewish\n\nindividuals who have both a personal history and family history of colon cancer.\n\nCF86 TEST. Genzyme General's CF86 test screens for 86 genetic mutations\n\nassociated with cystic fibrosis.\n\n11\n\nDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. Genzyme General is developing additional platforms\n\nfor complex mutational analysis and conducts research and development programs\n\nin such areas as genomics and rare cell separation and analysis methods. It is\n\ndeveloping an HER-2 gene amplification assay, new predispositional colon cancer\n\ntests and an inherited thrombophilia panel. Genzyme General is also developing a\n\nmultiple disease carrier test using the MASDA-Registered Trademark- technology\n\nand integrated scanning sequencing approaches for rapid detection of both\n\npreviously characterized and unknown gene mutations.\n\nGELTEX PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\n\nTECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS\n\nPOLYMER BASED NON-ABSORBED PRODUCTS. During the digestive process, the\n\nintestinal tract delivers nutrients and water to the bloodstream and eliminates\n\nwaste products and indigestible materials through the bowel. Absorption of\n\nnutrients, electrolytes, water and certain digestive substances such as bile\n\nacids is controlled by the intestinal wall, which acts as a gateway from the\n\nintestines to the bloodstream, allowing small molecules to pass from the\n\nintestinal tract into the bloodstream and preventing larger molecules from\n\nentering circulation. Orally administered drugs are either absorbed through the\n\nintestinal wall into the bloodstream, or are non-absorbed and achieve their\n\nintended therapeutic effect by acting in the intestinal tract. Non-absorbed\n\ndrugs are less likely to cause the toxicities associated with many absorbed\n\ndrugs.\n\nGelTex's product development approach represents an advance in the use of\n\npolymers as pharmaceuticals. Its technology enables GelTex to combine\n\ncommercially available or novel monomers that have distinct structural qualities\n\nto create proprietary, non-absorbed polymers that selectively bind target\n\nmolecules. GelTex designs its polymers to carry a high density of binding sites\n\nfor the targeted molecules, making them potent at low dosage levels. Its\n\nproducts are designed to be orally administered in capsule or tablet form. The\n\ncompounds are not broken down during the digestive process and are too large to\n\nbe absorbed through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream. As the\n\npolymers pass through the stomach and into the intestines, they bind targeted\n\nmolecules and pass easily through the intestinal tract and, with the attached\n\ntarget molecules, are excreted from the body.\n\nGelTex believes that its enabling technology offers the following benefits:\n\n- GelTex believes its enabling technology is applicable to a broad range of\n\ndiseases and conditions treatable through the intestinal tract, such as\n\nelevated LDL cholesterol, obesity and certain infectious diseases;\n\n- since GelTex's products are designed to act only in the intestinal tract\n\nand are not absorbed into the bloodstream, they are less likely to cause\n\nthe toxicities associated with many absorbed drugs; and\n\n- GelTex's polymer-based products are designed to be potent enough to permit\n\noral administration in a convenient capsule or tablet form.\n\nPOLYAMINES AND METAL CHELATORS. Polyamines are naturally occurring\n\ncompounds found in human cells that remain as metabolically distinct entities\n\nwithin the cells. Research indicates that these polyamines bind to nucleic acids\n\nand promote the integrity and fidelity of many of the functions of nucleic acids\n\nthat are necessary for cellular proliferation to occur. GelTex's polyamine\n\nanalogue compounds are structurally similar to the cell's naturally occurring\n\npolyamines and, as a result, these analogues are recognized as natural\n\npolyamines by the cell's polyamine uptake system and gain entry to the cell.\n\nOnce inside the cell, GelTex's polyamine analogues cause the cell to shut down\n\nthe enzymes that would normally make natural polyamines and to increase\n\nproduction of the enzyme that is responsible for the breakdown and export of\n\nnatural polyamines from the cell. The combined effect on the enzymes controlling\n\nthe proper level of polyamines in the cell results in a reduction in the amount\n\nof natural polyamines in the cell and a corresponding increase in the amount of\n\nanalogues in the cell.\n\n12\n\nMetal chelators are drugs that bind tightly to certain metals, such as iron,\n\nin the bloodstream and inside cells. They eliminate quantities of metals in\n\nexcess of the body's needs, thereby helping to avoid damage to vital organs such\n\nas the liver, heart and pancreas. Chelators are administered to enhance the\n\nbody's ability to get rid of excess metal concentrations.\n\nPRODUCT AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\n\nPRODUCT INDICATION STATUS COLLABORATOR OR LICENSOR\n\n- --------------------- --------------------- --------------------- ------------------------\n\nWELCHOL-TM- Reduction of elevated Marketed since 2000; Sankyo Pharma Inc.\n\n(COLESEVELAM LDL cholesterol in approved in the U.S.\n\nHYDROCHLORIDE) patients with primary in 2000\n\nhypercholesterolemia\n\nGT160-246 CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE Pilot trial ongoing; None\n\ncolitis larger phase 2 trial\n\nto be initiated in\n\n2001\n\nPOLYAMINE ANALOGUE Psoriasis Phase 1-2 trial University of Florida\n\nongoing\n\nPOLYMER Oral mucositis IND filing planned None\n\nfor 2001\n\nORAL IRON CHELATOR Iron overload IND filing planned None\n\ndisorders for second half of\n\n2001\n\nFAT ABSORPTION Anti-obesity Research None\n\nINHIBITOR\n\nWe have described GelTex's product and most advanced development program\n\nbelow.\n\nWELCHOL-TM- (COLESEVELAM HYDROCHLORIDE). GelTex received marketing approval\n\nfor WelChol-TM- from the FDA in May 2000. WelChol-TM- is approved for\n\nadministration alone or in combination with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, also\n\nknown as a \"statin,\" as adjunctive therapy to diet and exercise for the\n\nreduction of elevated LDL cholesterol in patients with primary\n\nhypercholesterolemia. While the risks of hypercholesterolemia are well\n\nrecognized, the condition remains significantly under-treated worldwide. An\n\nestimated 25 million Americans require drug therapy to achieve adequate\n\nreductions in cholesterol levels. However, only approximately 8 million\n\nAmericans are receiving cholesterol-reducing drugs, and it is estimated that\n\nmore than 60% of this population is not at their appropriate National\n\nCholesterol Education Program LDL cholesterol goal. Worldwide, approximately\n\none-third of the individuals who should be receiving cholesterol-reducing drugs\n\nare receiving therapy. WelChol-TM- is being marketed in the United States by\n\nSankyo Pharma. Sankyo Pharma launched WelChol-TM- in September 2000.\n\nGT 160-246 FOR C. DIFFICILE COLITIS. GelTex's leading product currently in\n\ndevelopment is a toxin binder for CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE, also known as C.\n\nDIFFICILE. C. DIFFICILE is a major cause of antibiotic associated colitis, a\n\ncondition common in hospitals and nursing homes. C. DIFFICILE is estimated to\n\naffect over 500,000 patients each year in the United States, resulting in\n\nprolonged hospital stays and increased costs, and is the cause of an estimated\n\n5,000 deaths annually. GelTex is conducting a pilot phase 2 trial of GT160-246\n\nand plans to initiate a large phase 2 trial by the end of 2001.\n\nGENZYME BIOSURGERY--PRODUCTS AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\n\nWe created Genzyme Biosurgery in December 2000 by combining two of our\n\nformer divisions, Genzyme Surgical Products and Genzyme Tissue Repair, and\n\nsimultaneously acquiring Biomatrix, Inc. Genzyme Biosurgery is organized into\n\nthree business units: Orthopaedics, Cardiothoracic and\n\n13\n\nBiosurgical Specialties. Its product and development program portfolio consists\n\nof biomaterials, biotherapeutics, traditional devices and surgical closures, as\n\nwell as advanced devices for minimally invasive cardiovascular surgery. Genzyme\n\nBiosurgery's sales force markets products directly to surgeons and hospital\n\nadministrators throughout the United States and Europe. It also uses a network\n\nof distributors to sell products in Europe, Asia and Latin America.\n\nIn February 2001, we announced our intention to divest the\n\nSnowden-Pencer-Registered Trademark- surgical instruments product lines. These\n\nproduct lines include hand-held reusable instruments and endoscopic instruments\n\nfor general, plastic and gynecological surgery. We also announced our intention\n\nto terminate the production of Synvisc-Registered Trademark- in Canada and sell\n\nour manufacturing facility in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada. We expect these\n\ntransactions to be completed during the second half of 2001.\n\nORTHOPAEDICS\n\nSYNVISC-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- (HYLAN G-F20). Synvisc-Registered Trademark-\n\nis an hyaluronan-based biomaterial used to treat osteoarthritis of the knee to\n\nreduce pain and improve joint mobility. When injected into the knee joint,\n\nSynvisc-Registered Trademark- supplements the synovial fluid to restore\n\nlubrication and cushioning. Synvisc-Registered Trademark- is approved in over 50\n\ncountries and is sold in more than 35 countries through marketing and\n\ndistribution agreements with major pharmaceutical companies, including\n\nWyeth-Ayerst Laboratories in the U.S., Germany, Portugal and Turkey. In 2000, we\n\ncompleted a pilot clinical trial in which Synvisc-Registered Trademark- was\n\nevaluated for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip. A pivotal trial for\n\nthis indication is planned for 2001. Genzyme Biosurgery plans to conduct\n\nadditional clinical studies evaluating Synvisc-Registered Trademark- in other\n\njoints in the future.\n\nCARTICEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- (AUTOLOGOUS CULTURED\n\nCHONDROCYTES). Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes are used to treat\n\ndamaged articular knee cartilage. Genzyme Biosurgery employs a proprietary\n\nprocess to grow autologous--a patient's own--cartilage cells for use in\n\nrepairing damaged knee cartilage in patients who have had an inadequate response\n\nto a prior surgical procedure. Genzyme Biosurgery also sells biopsy kits and a\n\nvariety of reusable disposable instruments and sutures that are typically used\n\nin the Carticel-Registered Trademark- procedure.\n\nThe FDA has required Genzyme Biosurgery to conduct two confirmatory\n\npost-marketing studies of Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes. The first\n\nstudy, which was successfully completed in 2000 ahead of schedule, measured\n\noutcomes of patients in Genzyme Biosurgery's registry who did not respond to\n\nother treatment before being implanted with Carticel-Registered Trademark-\n\nchondrocytes. Outcomes before and after implantation were compared. The second\n\nstudy is designed to compare the long-term clinical effect of treatment with\n\nCarticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes to other treatments. Genzyme\n\nBiosurgery received protocol approval for this study in the first quarter of\n\n2000. Investigators will evaluate approximately 100 patients in the study and\n\nwill follow these patients for four years.\n\nGenzyme Biosurgery markets Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes to\n\northopedic surgeons in the United States and Europe directly and through\n\ndistributors. Genzyme Biosurgery also trains orthopedic surgeons, collects and\n\nanalyzes outcomes data through a registry, and assists physicians and patients\n\nin obtaining reimbursements from third-party payors. Approximately one-fourth of\n\nits 85-person U.S. sales and reimbursement staff is involved directly in claims\n\nprocessing and educating insurers about the appropriate uses of the product.\n\nGenzyme Biosurgery expects that Carticel-Registered Trademark- sales may be\n\nlower in the summer months as fewer operative procedures are typically performed\n\nduring those months.\n\nCARTICEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- II. Carticel-Registered Trademark- II, which\n\nis currently in development, is a next-generation product based on the\n\ndevelopment of a pre-formed autologous cartilage tissue implant. The implant is\n\nintended to allow the procedure to be performed arthroscopically. If it is\n\nsuccessfully developed, Carticel-Registered Trademark- II could significantly\n\ndecrease rehabilitation time for patients and allow surgeons to treat larger\n\ncartilage defects. In connection with the development of\n\nCarticel-Registered Trademark- II, Genzyme Biosurgery obtained an exclusive\n\nworldwide license in 2000 from Sentron Medical, Inc., for technology and related\n\nintellectual property\n\n14\n\nrights that include autologous chondrocyte graft technology to produce cartilage\n\ntissue on a supporting membrane IN VITRO.\n\nOTHER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. Genzyme Biosurgery is conducting preclinical\n\nstudies of a small molecule therapy for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Genzyme\n\nBiosurgery is conducting basic research and development into the biology of\n\ncartilage and the cartilage repair process. The objective of this research is to\n\nidentify biologic materials that promote more rapid regeneration of articular\n\ncartilage, to develop new methods for the repair of arthritic joints and large\n\nsurface area cartilage defects and to enable the implantation procedure to be\n\nperformed less invasively. Genzyme Biosurgery is also committing resources to\n\nmeet requirements specified by the FDA for validation of certain product\n\nmanufacturing parameters.\n\nCARDIOTHORACIC\n\nDEVICES AND SUTURES. Genzyme Biosurgery's products for traditional\n\ncardiothoracic surgery include a comprehensive portfolio of products, including\n\nfluid management (chest drainage) systems and sutures. Its line of fluid\n\nmanagement systems consists primarily of self-contained, disposable chest\n\ndrainage devices used to drain blood from the chest cavity following open-heart\n\nand lung surgery. Genzyme Biosurgery also sells autotransfusion devices that\n\nallow the collection of blood lost by the patient and its reinfusion\n\npostoperatively, which eliminates the risks associated with blood transfusions.\n\nGenzyme Biosurgery's self-contained, disposable Pleur-evac-Registered Trademark-\n\nchest drainage unit was introduced in 1967 and is the market leader in chest\n\ndrainage devices. Genzyme Biosurgery also sells a line of dry suction-\n\ncontrolled chest drainage and autotransfusion devices under the Sahara-TM- and\n\nThora-Klex-Registered Trademark- brand names. In 2000, Genzyme Biosurgery\n\nentered into selling agreements for its chest drainage devices with Novations,\n\nLLC, Amerinet, Inc. and Health Services Corporation of America, which are large\n\nhospital group purchasing organizations representing approximately 45% of the\n\nhospitals in the United States. Genzyme Biosurgery also markets sutures,\n\nincluding the Tevdek-Registered Trademark- and Polydek-Registered Trademark-\n\nvalve sutures and Deklene-Registered Trademark- bypass sutures. Genzyme\n\nBiosurgery received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market the NextStitch-TM-\n\ncardiovascular valve suture for use in heart-valve replacement surgery in\n\nNovember 2000. NextStitch-TM- cardiovascular valve suture incorporates two\n\nsuture strands into each needle, which allows surgeons to significantly reduce\n\nthe time and increase the efficiency of valve suturing. Additionally, Genzyme\n\nBiosurgery sells aortic punches, which are used during coronary artery bypass\n\ngraft surgery to make clean, round openings in the aorta prior to grafting.\n\nMINIMALLY INVASIVE CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY SYSTEMS. Genzyme Biosurgery\n\nmarkets products for minimally invasive cardiovascular surgery, with a focus on\n\nbeating-heart surgery and vein harvesting. In beating-heart surgery, procedures\n\nare performed on the heart without stopping the heart and without the use of a\n\nheart/lung machine to circulate blood and supply oxygen. This allows surgeons to\n\navoid the complications often associated with the use of heart/lung machines.\n\nGenzyme Biosurgery launched its Immobilizer-TM- System, its third-generation\n\nplatform for beating-heart surgery, in August 2000. The Immobilizer-TM- System\n\ncombines reusable retractors with disposable devices such as stabilizers,\n\nsutures and punches. Genzyme Biosurgery also introduced the next generation of\n\nits SaphLITE-Registered Trademark- system in August 2000. Genzyme Biosurgery's\n\nnew SaphLITE-Registered Trademark- system is used to remove the saphenous vein\n\nfrom a patient's leg in a minimally-invasive procedure for use as a graft during\n\na coronary artery bypass graft operation.\n\nBIOMATERIALS. Genzyme Biosurgery launched FocalSeal-Registered Trademark--L\n\nin North America in 2000 for use in pulmonary procedures.\n\nFocalSeal-Registered Trademark--L is a biomaterial developed by Focal, Inc. for\n\nthe prevention of air leaks following lung surgery. Genzyme Biosurgery has the\n\nexclusive rights to market FocalSeal-Registered Trademark--L in North America\n\nfor cardiovascular and gastrointestinal procedures. Approximately 70,000 lung\n\nsurgeries are performed in the United States annually, with almost all patients\n\nat risk for debilitating air leaks.\n\n15\n\nGenzyme Biosurgery's cardiothoracic sales force is initially targeting the top\n\n150 thoracic hospitals in the United States. This force is augmented by Focal\n\nsales specialists.\n\nGenzyme Biosurgery obtained CE Mark approval in the European Union for its\n\nCV Seprafilm-TM- II adhesion barrier, which is designed to reduce the formation\n\nof adhesions (scar tissue) following open-heart surgery. CV Seprafilm-TM- II\n\nadhesion barrier is part of a portfolio of products based on hyaluronan known as\n\nthe \"Sepra-TM- products\" that are being developed and marketed by Genzyme\n\nBiosurgery. Hyaluronan is a substance that is naturally created in the body to\n\nlubricate and protect tissue. We are developing the Sepra-TM- products on behalf\n\nof Genzyme Development Partners, L.P., and market the products in the United\n\nStates and Canada on behalf of Genzyme Ventures II, our joint venture with\n\nGenzyme Development Partners. In January 2001, we purchased all of the Class A\n\nlimited partnership interests in Genzyme Development Partners for an upfront\n\ncash payment of $35,000 per interest (or $17,500 for each half-interest) and\n\nroyalties on sales of the Sepra-TM- products for ten years. The purchase of the\n\nClass A interests was allocated to Genzyme Biosurgery. If you would like more\n\ninformation about our relationship with Genzyme Development Partners and the\n\njoint venture, you should read Note M., \"Research and Development Agreements,\"\n\nto our Consolidated Financial Statements, which we are incorporating into this\n\ndiscussion by reference.\n\nBIOTHERAPEUTICS. In 2000, Genzyme Biosurgery initiated a phase 1 trial of a\n\nproprietary gene therapy designed to promote the growth of new blood vessels\n\naround blocked coronary arteries. The novel gene therapy is based on an\n\nengineered form of the gene known as HIF-1 alpha, which has been shown in\n\npreclinical studies to turn on the expression of many proteins associated with\n\nblood vessel formation. The HIF-1 alpha product is being administered in\n\npatients with coronary artery disease undergoing bypass surgery who have an area\n\nof the heart that is not suitable for surgical revascularization. Genzyme\n\nBiosurgery is also conducting a phase 1 trial to evaluate the use of the HIF-l\n\nalpha to treat patients with severe peripheral vascular disease. In addition,\n\nGenzyme Biosurgery is conducting research on other gene therapy approaches to\n\ncongestive heart failure and restenosis.\n\nBIOSURGERY SPECIALTIES\n\nBIOMATERIALS. Genzyme Biosurgery has an extensive line of biomaterial\n\nproducts on the market and in development for the general surgery market,\n\nincluding many of the Sepra-TM- products. Genzyme Biosurgery sells the Sepra-TM-\n\nproducts in the United States and Europe primarily through its own sales force\n\nand in Japan through a distributor.\n\nPRODUCT INDICATION STATUS\n\n- ----------------------------- ----------------------------- -----------------------------\n\nSEPRAFILM-TM- BIORESORBABLE Prevention of adhesions after Approved and marketed in the\n\nMEMBRANE abdominal/pelvic surgery U.S. and Europe since 1996;\n\napproved in Canada and Israel\n\nsince 1997 and in Japan since\n\n1998; approved and marketed\n\nin several other countries\n\nSEPRAFILM-TM- BIORESORBABLE Prevention of small bowel Phase 4 clinical trial\n\nMEMBRANE obstructions ongoing\n\nSEPRAFILM-TM- II ADHESION Prevention of adhesions after Marketed in Europe since 1999\n\nBARRIER abdominal/pelvic surgery\n\nSEPRAMESH-TM- BIOSURGICAL Hernia repair Approved and marketed since\n\nCOMPOSITE 2000 in the U.S., Europe and\n\nCanada\n\n16\n\nPRODUCT INDICATION STATUS\n\n- ----------------------------- ----------------------------- -----------------------------\n\nHYLAFORM-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- Facial wrinkle and deep scar CE Mark approval received in\n\nrepairs 1995; approved in Canada,\n\nIsrael and Chile in 1997, in\n\nArgentina in 1998 and in\n\nAustralia and China in 1999\n\nSEPRAPACK-TM- PRODUCT Sinus packing Available for sale in the\n\nU.S. in 2000\n\nHYLASHIELD-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-, Ease pain caused by dry-eye Marketed in Canada and Europe\n\nHYLASHIELD NITE-TM- AND and facilitate ophthalmic\n\nHSS-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- surgical procedures\n\nSEPRAGEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- Sinus packing Received 510(k) approval in\n\nSINUS (FORMERLY HYLASINE-TM-) the U.S. in 2000\n\nSEPRAGEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- Prevention of adhesions after In development\n\nBIORESORBABLE GEL open and laproscopic surgery\n\nSEPRAGEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- Spinal surgery In development\n\nSPINE\n\nSeprafilm-TM- bioresorbable membrane is a solid form of modified hyaluronan\n\nthat is used to separate and protect tissues and organs that have been damaged\n\nduring abdominal and pelvic surgery. It is the only product approved by the FDA\n\nthat is clinically proven to reduce the incidence, extent and severity of\n\npostsurgical adhesions in the abdomen and pelvis. To build further clinical\n\nevidence of the safety and effectiveness of Seprafilm-TM- bioresorbable\n\nmembrane, Genzyme Biosurgery has initiated a 25-center, 1,700-patient phase 4\n\ntrial to test the ability of the Seprafilm-TM- product to reduce the incidence\n\nof bowel obstructions. The study will track patient outcomes for two years after\n\nsurgery.\n\nSeprafilm-TM- II adhesion barrier is a modified form of Seprafilm-TM-\n\nbioresorbable membrane designed to have increased plasticity and, thus, improved\n\nhandling and overall ease of use. Seprafilm-TM- II adhesion barrier currently is\n\nmarketed in Europe for use in open and laproscopic surgery to reduce the\n\nincidence of postoperative abdominal and pelvic adhesions.\n\nIn 2000, Genzyme Biosurgery received 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA\n\nfor Sepramesh-TM- biosurgical composite, a mesh product that is coated with\n\nmodified hyaluronan for use in hernia repairs and other soft tissue repairs such\n\nas bladder neck suspensions.\n\nHylaform-Registered Trademark- is a hyaluronan-based biomaterial that is\n\nused to correct facial wrinkles and deep scars by injection directly into the\n\ndermal tissue. It is part of the portfolio of products based on hyaluronan we\n\nacquired through our acquisition of Biomatrix. It is distributed by Inamed\n\nCorporation, formerly called Collagen Aesthetics, Inc., in Europe, Canada,\n\nJapan, Australia, Israel and other select countries worldwide. Inamed also has\n\nthe exclusive distribution rights to Hylaform-Registered Trademark- in the\n\nUnited States, subject to an additional payment and FDA approval.\n\nEPICEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- (CULTURAL EPIDERMAL AUTOGRAFTS). Genzyme\n\nBiosurgery's Epicel-Registered Trademark- skin grafts are cultured autologous\n\nskin cells used for permanent skin replacement for patients with severe burns.\n\nEpicel-Registered Trademark- skin grafts were first introduced in 1987. These\n\nepidermal grafts are grown from a patient's own skin cells and, therefore, are\n\nnot rejected by the patient's immune system. Most burn wounds involving less\n\nthan 60% body surface area are covered with conventional skin grafts within the\n\nthree to four weeks it currently takes to grow skin grafts produced using the\n\nEpicel-Registered Trademark- process. The primary candidates for\n\nEpicel-Registered Trademark- skin grafts are the approximately 800 patients each\n\nyear in the U.S. who survive burn injuries covering more than 60% of their body\n\nsurface area. Genzyme Biosurgery markets Epicel-Registered Trademark- skin\n\ngrafts to burn centers in the United States and parts of Europe through its own\n\ndirect sales force and in Japan\n\n17\n\nthrough a distributor. Sales of Epicel-Registered Trademark- skin grafts\n\nfluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on a number of unpredictable\n\nfactors, including the number and survival rate of severe burn patients prior to\n\ntreatment with Epicel-Registered Trademark- skin grafts.\n\nPLASTIC SURGERY PRODUCTS. Genzyme Biosurgery also manufactures products for\n\nthe plastic surgery market. This distinct product line consists of hand-held\n\ninstruments, endoscopic plastic surgery equipment, sutures and surgical\n\ncompression garments.\n\nGENZYME MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY--TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology is developing a new generation of cancer\n\ntherapeutics based upon the growing understanding of the molecular basis of\n\ncancer. It believes that these therapeutics have potential to treat multiple\n\ntypes of cancer, minimize toxicity and side effects, and complement both\n\nexisting and novel therapies. Genzyme Molecular Oncology supplements its\n\ninternal resources through collaborations with some of the world's preeminent\n\nscientists and clinicians in the field of cancer.\n\nTECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS\n\nANTIGEN DISCOVERY. Genzyme Molecular Oncology is seeking to stimulate a\n\ncellular immune response against tumors by using vaccines to present\n\ntumor-specific antigens to the immune system. Antigens are molecular markers in\n\ntumor cells that enable the body's immune system to recognize and respond to\n\nthese cells as being foreign. Genzyme Molecular Oncology has built a\n\nproprietary, state-of-the-art antigen discovery platform that combines\n\nidentification and validation in one step. It is using this platform to rapidly\n\nand efficiently identify and validate target antigens for incorporation into\n\nnovel antigen-specific peptide and gene cancer vaccines. For example, Genzyme\n\nMolecular Oncology plans to analyze the tumor tissue extracted from responding\n\npatients in its ongoing clinical trials using its antigen discovery technologies\n\nin order to identify the antigens associated with the tumor and expand the\n\ndevelopment of its antigen-specific vaccines. It plans to file an\n\nInvestigational New Drug application for its first proprietary cancer antigen\n\nfragments in 2001. Genzyme Molecular Oncology also established an antigen\n\ndiscovery and licensing collaboration with Purdue Pharma L.P. in October 2000\n\nrelated to the discovery and validation of up to 20 cancer antigens.\n\nBuilding on the success of this platform, Genzyme Molecular Oncology is\n\nbeginning to expand its antigen discovery technologies in the field of\n\ninfectious disease. In January 2001, it entered into an HIV antigen discovery\n\nand research collaboration with Dr. Bruce Walker of Massachusetts General\n\nHospital. Dr. Walker and Genzyme Molecular Oncology will perform studies to\n\nidentify novel peptides that may be used as HIV vaccines. Genzyme Molecular\n\nOncology's ability to develop and commercialize novel peptides identified during\n\nthis collaboration is subject to the execution of a further agreement with\n\nMassachusetts General Hospital, which is currently being negotiated.\n\nSAGE-TM-. Genzyme Molecular Oncology's SAGE-TM- (Serial Analysis of Gene\n\nExpression) technology is a patented high-throughput, high efficiency method of\n\nsimultaneously detecting and measuring the expression level of virtually all\n\ngenes expressed in a cell at a given time. The SAGE-TM- technology detects and\n\nquantifies expression of novel as well as known genes and, because of its high\n\nefficiency and sensitivity, SAGE-TM- technology can detect genes expressed at\n\nlow levels. Some of the uses of the SAGE-TM- technology are comparison of\n\ndisease tissue with healthy tissue, comparison of genes expressed at different\n\nstages of disease, elucidation of disease pathways and measurement of response\n\nto and toxicity of drug candidates. Genzyme Molecular Oncology enhances the\n\npower of its SAGE-TM- technology through software and bioinformatics\n\ndevelopment, technology improvements, database expansion and the integration of\n\nthe SAGE-TM- technology with other genomics tools, such as microarrays.\n\n18\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology has used its SAGE-TM- technology to analyze the\n\nmost prevalent types of cancer and corresponding normal tissue and also has\n\naccess to SAGE-TM- data generated in the laboratories of Drs. Bert Vogelstein\n\nand Kenneth Kinzler at The Johns Hopkins University. Genzyme Molecular Oncology\n\nhas accumulated from its proprietary analyses, its collaborators and the Cancer\n\nGenome Anatomy Project at the National Cancer Institute a database of over\n\n3.5 million SAGE-TM- gene sequence identification tags, representing over\n\n125,000 unique transcripts. In August 2000, The Johns Hopkins University\n\npublished data from a study in which its researchers had used the SAGE-TM-\n\ntechnology to identify 79 genes, including 14 novel genes differentially\n\nexpressed in tumors versus normal vasculature. Of the 79 genes, 46 were\n\nspecifically involved in tumor angiogenesis. Genzyme Molecular Oncology has\n\nrights to the intellectual property related to the genes found in this study\n\nunder a sponsored research agreement with the laboratory of Dr. Kinzler.\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology also employs its SAGE-TM- technology extensively\n\nin its own drug discovery and development efforts to identify genes that are\n\nfunctionally relevant. In cancer vaccines, Genzyme Molecular Oncology combines\n\nthe SAGE-TM- technology with other proprietary tools to identify tumor-specific\n\nantigens. In angiogenesis inhibition, Genzyme Molecular Oncology is using the\n\nSAGE-TM- technology to dissect the genetic pathways for angiogenesis and to\n\nexplore and understand the mechanism of action of drug candidates discovered in\n\nfunctional assays.\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology is using the SAGE-TM- technology and its\n\nproprietary SAGE-TM- database to generate revenues through licenses and database\n\ncollaborations. For example, in 2000, Genzyme Molecular Oncology licensed its\n\nSAGE-TM- technology to Pfizer, Syngenta, Medical Molecular Research Collogne,\n\nNeuralStem Biopharmaceuticals and Invitrogen. Genzyme Molecular Oncology also\n\ngranted Celera Genomics co-exclusive worldwide rights to market the SAGE-TM-\n\ndatabase to Celera customers on a revenue-sharing basis. The arrangement allows\n\ncustomers to combine SAGE-TM- expression data with Celera's Genome Reference\n\nDatabase, providing them with powerful means to more rapidly and efficiently\n\nmove drug discovery forward by associating genes with tissues and disease\n\nstates.\n\nDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology is developing products primarily focused on\n\nvaccines that treat cancer by stimulating the body's immune system to fight\n\ntumor cells and angiogenesis inhibitors that treat cancer by preventing the\n\nformation and development of blood vessels that tumors require for growth. The\n\nfollowing chart describes the status of Genzyme Molecular Oncology's development\n\nprograms.\n\nPROGRAM TYPE(S) OF CANCER STATUS\n\n- ----------------------------- ----------------------------- -----------------------------\n\nCANCER VACCINES\n\nDENDRITIC/TUMOR CELL FUSION Breast Phase 1-2 trial ongoing\n\nVACCINES (CHEMICAL Melanoma Phase 1-2 trial ongoing\n\nPROCESS) Kidney Phase 1-2 trial ongoing\n\nDENDRITIC/TUMOR CELL FUSION Melanoma Preclinical\n\nVACCINES (ELECTROFUSION Kidney Preclinical\n\nPROCESS)\n\nMELAN-A/MART-1 AND GP100 Melanoma (EX VIVO) Phase 1-2 trial ongoing\n\nANTIGEN-SPECIFIC CANCER Melanoma (IN VIVO) Phase 1-2 trial ongoing\n\nVACCINES\n\nSPHERE-TM- PEPTIDES Multiple Preclinical\n\nNY-ESO-1 ANTIGEN Multiple Preclinical\n\n19\n\nPROGRAM TYPE(S) OF CANCER STATUS\n\n- ----------------------------- ----------------------------- -----------------------------\n\nANGIOGENESIS INHIBITORS\n\nAAATIII* Multiple Preclinical\n\nSMALL MOLECULES Multiple Research\n\nGENE THERAPY Multiple Research\n\n- ------------------------\n\n* Genzyme Molecular Oncology is co-developing aaATIII with ATIII LLC, a joint\n\nventure between Genzyme General and Genzyme Transgenics Corporation. If you\n\nwould like additional information concerning this joint venture, please read\n\nNote I., \"Investments,\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which we\n\nare incorporating into this discussion by reference.\n\nCANCER VACCINES\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology believes that the most successful cancer vaccines\n\nwill be those that activate a cellular immune response directed at the tumor.\n\nIts program features two types of vaccines for generating a tumor-specific\n\ncellular immune response:\n\n- where the specific tumor antigens are not known, a cell therapy product is\n\ncreated by using a technique that fuses the patient's own tumor cells with\n\ndendritic cells, the specialized immune system cells that capture antigens\n\nand present them to T cells--the immune system's cellular response to\n\ndisease--which are then able to selectively recognize and destroy the\n\ntumor cells; and\n\n- where specific tumor antigens have been identified as targets of the\n\ncellular immune response, Genzyme Molecular Oncology uses gene-based or\n\npeptide-based tumor vaccines.\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology believes that both of these vaccine types will\n\nprovide clinical benefit and have commercial potential. Development of\n\nantigen-specific vaccines, however, is currently limited by the lack of known\n\ntumor-specific antigens. Therefore, cell fusion may have broader applicability\n\nin the near term. Over time, as Genzyme Molecular Oncology identifies more\n\ntumor-specific antigens, it anticipates having the ability to provide\n\noff-the-shelf vaccines that are customized based on the set of specific antigens\n\npresent in the patient's tumor.\n\nFUSION-BASED CANCER VACCINES.\n\nBREAST CANCER FUSION VACCINE. Working with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute\n\nand the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Genzyme Molecular\n\nOncology initiated a phase 1-2 trial for the treatment of metastatic breast\n\ncancer in September 1999. A chemical process is being used in this trial to fuse\n\nthe patient's tumor cells with dendritic cells. The end points for this trial\n\nare safety, immunologic response and clinical response.\n\nMELANOMA AND KIDNEY CANCER FUSION VACCINES. Genzyme Molecular Oncology\n\naccelerated its fusion vaccine program following the publication by an academic\n\ngroup in Germany of promising clinical data for the treatment of advanced kidney\n\ncancer with a vaccine produced using electrofusion to combine a patient's cancer\n\ncells with dendritic cells derived from another source. Two additional phase 1-2\n\ntrials for cell fusion vaccines were initiated in 2000, one in advanced kidney\n\ncancer and one in metastatic melanoma. Both of these trials employ the chemical\n\nfusion process. Genzyme Molecular Oncology plans to initiate two more\n\nfusion-based vaccine trials in 2001 using the electrofusion process employed by\n\nthe German group.\n\n20\n\nANTIGEN-SPECIFIC CANCER VACCINES.\n\nMELAN-A/MART-1 AND GP100 ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC VACCINES. In collaboration with\n\nDr. Steven Rosenberg at the National Cancer Institute, Genzyme Molecular\n\nOncology has conducted two phase 1 trials. In these trials, adenoviral gene\n\ndelivery vectors carrying either the Melan-A/MART-1 or gp100 gene were evaluated\n\nfor safety, immunologic reactivity and potential therapeutic effect when\n\nadministered IN VIVO alone or in conjunction with recombinant interleukin-2. The\n\nresults from these clinical studies indicated that the adenoviral vectors were\n\nsafe and well tolerated, and that a small but notable number of both the 36\n\npatients immunized with Melan-A/MART-1 and the 18 patients treated with gp100\n\nshowed clinically significant tumor regression. These responses were seen in\n\nvery late stage (stage 4) metastatic disease patients, who are a heavily\n\npre-treated patient population not expected to mount a robust immune response\n\nand who, as a group, have a very short life expectancy.\n\nIn April 1999, Genzyme Molecular Oncology initiated a phase 1-2 trial in\n\nmelanoma patients at Massachusetts General Hospital. This trial involves\n\nextracting dendritic cells from the patient and combining these cells with a\n\nvaccine containing Melan-A/MART-1 and gp100 EX VIVO. The treated cells are then\n\ninjected into the patient. In this trial, Genzyme Molecular Oncology will assess\n\nsafety, immunologic response and clinical response. Throughout the trial,\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology will be performing a comprehensive analysis of the\n\npatient's immune response to the vaccine to help it to understand better why\n\nsome patients respond well to the therapy while others do not.\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology also initiated a phase 1-2 IN VIVO melanoma trial\n\nin September 2000. This study utilizes both the Melan-A/MART-1 and gp100 tumor\n\nantigens delivered intradermally. In this trial, Genzyme Molecular Oncology\n\nintends to monitor patient immune responses in order to further elucidate the\n\nimmunology of cancer to enhance its antigen-specific vaccine development\n\nefforts.\n\nSPHERE-TM- PEPTIDE VACCINES. Genzyme Molecular Oncology has identified\n\nnumerous proprietary peptides, or antigen fragments, through its antigen\n\ndiscovery program. It is currently evaluating peptides for multiple cancer\n\nindications in preclinical studies, and plans to file an Investigational New\n\nDrug application for a phase 1 trial in melanoma using its SPHERE-TM- peptides\n\nlater in 2001.\n\nNY-ESO-1 ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC VACCINES. NY-ESO-1 is an antigen expressed in a\n\nsubset of a number of different tumor types, including breast cancer, melanoma\n\nand lung cancer. Genzyme Molecular Oncology is conducting pre-clinical\n\ndevelopment to support a phase 1-2 trial for NY-ESO-1-positive tumors to be\n\nperformed in collaboration with the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research.\n\nANGIOGENESIS INHIBITORS\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology is pursuing multiple approaches to\n\nanti-angiogenesis - the treatment of cancer by cutting off the blood supply that\n\ntumors need to survive. In 2000, Genzyme Molecular Oncology's collaborators at\n\nThe Johns Hopkins University used the SAGE-TM- technology to identify 46 genes\n\nimplicated in the growth of tumor blood vessels. These genes may yield targets\n\nfor the development of cancer therapeutics. In addition, Genzyme Molecular\n\nOncology is continuing its collaboration with Dr. Judah Folkman's laboratory at\n\nBoston's Children's Hospital around aaATIII, a modified form of antithrombin III\n\nthat has been shown in preclinical studies to act as a potent angiogenesis\n\ninhibitor.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nWe are engaged in segments of the human healthcare products industry that\n\nare extremely competitive. Our competitors in the United States and elsewhere\n\nare numerous and include major pharmaceutical, surgical device and biotechnology\n\ncompanies. Some of these competitors may have more extensive research and\n\ndevelopment, regulatory, manufacturing and production capabilities. Some\n\ncompetitors may have greater financial resources. These companies may succeed in\n\ndeveloping products\n\n21\n\nthat are more effective than any that we have or may develop and may also prove\n\nto be more successful than we are in producing and marketing products and\n\nservices. In addition, technological advances or different approaches developed\n\nby one or more of our competitors may render our products obsolete, less\n\neffective or uneconomical.\n\nEach of our products and services faces different competitive challenges,\n\nand we have described many of them below.\n\nCEREZYME-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- AND CEREDASE-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-\n\nENZYMES. Although Genzyme General is not aware of any current effective\n\nalternative to its products for the treatment for Gaucher disease, competition\n\npotentially could come from other protein replacement therapies, small molecules\n\nor gene therapy. Genzyme General believes that its proprietary production\n\ntechniques and, to a certain extent, the orphan drug status of its products,\n\nwhich provides market exclusivity in the United States until May 2001, give it a\n\nnumber of advantages over potential competitors using protein replacement\n\ntherapy for the treatment of Gaucher disease. Gene therapy techniques are still\n\nin experimental stages. Genzyme General believes that the principal factors that\n\nwill affect competition for Cerezyme-Registered Trademark- and\n\nCeredase-Registered Trademark- enzymes will be clinical effectiveness and\n\nabsence of adverse side effects.\n\nRENAGEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- CAPSULES AND TABLETS. Phosphate binders are\n\ncurrently the only available treatment for hyperphosphatemia. There are several\n\nphosphate binders available or under development. A prescription calcium acetate\n\npreparation is currently the only other product approved in the United States\n\nfor the control of elevated phosphorus levels in patients with chronic kidney\n\nfailure. Other products used as phosphate binders include over-the-counter\n\ncalcium- and aluminum-based antacids and dietary calcium supplements. Calcium\n\nacetate and calcium carbonate, the most commonly used agents, must be taken at\n\nsufficient doses to achieve adequate reductions in phosphate absorption, which\n\ncan lead to constipation and patient noncompliance. In addition, calcium therapy\n\nrequires frequent monitoring because its use can cause hypercalcemia. Aluminum\n\nhydroxide is more effective at lower doses than calcium acetate or calcium\n\ncarbonate, but it is infrequently used because aluminum absorbed from the\n\nintestinal tract accumulates in the tissues of patients with chronic kidney\n\nfailure, causing aluminum-related osteomalacia, anemia and dialysis dementia.\n\nGenzyme General is aware of one other company, Shire Pharmaceuticals, Inc., that\n\nis developing a phosphate binder for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in\n\npatients with chronic renal failure. Shire licensed this product, Foznal-TM-,\n\nfrom AnorMed, Inc. and has filed for marketing approval in Europe and is\n\nexpected to file for approval in the United States in early 2002.\n\nWELCHOL-TM-. In the cholesterol-reduction field, products are currently\n\navailable that address many of the needs of the market. These products include\n\nother bile acid sequestrants, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, fibric acid\n\nderivatives and niacin-based products. In 2000, sales of HMG-CoA reductase\n\ninhibitors represented more than 95% of the market for cholesterol-reducing\n\ndrugs sold in the United States. Combined worldwide sales of HMG-CoA reductase\n\ninhibitors were an estimated $16.0 billion in 2000. The most widely prescribed\n\nbile acid sequestrant in the United States is cholestyramine, a polymer resin.\n\nFABRAZYME-TM- ENZYME. Genzyme General is aware of other companies\n\ndeveloping products for the treatment of Fabry disease. Transkaryotic\n\nTherapies Inc., for example, submitted its application for marketing approval\n\nfor its Replagal-TM- product for Fabry disease to the FDA approximately one week\n\nbefore we submitted our application for Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme. If Transkaryotic\n\nTherapies or any other company receives FDA approval for a Fabry disease therapy\n\nwith orphan drug designation before we receive FDA approval for Fabrazyme-TM-\n\nenzyme, the Orphan Drug Act may preclude us from selling Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme in\n\nthe United States for up to seven years. Similarly, we submitted our application\n\nfor marketing approval of Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme with the EMEA within a short time\n\nof Transkaryotic Therapies' filing. In March 2001, the CPMP issued positive\n\nopinions of the Marketing Authorization Applications for both our Fabrazyme-TM-\n\nenzyme and Transkaryotic Therapies' Replagal-TM- product on the\n\n22\n\nsame day. If Transkaryotic Therapies or any other company receives EMEA approval\n\nfor a Fabry disease therapy with orphan drug designation before we receive EMEA\n\napproval for Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme, the European equivalent of the Orphan Drug\n\nAct may preclude us from selling Fabrazyme-TM- enzyme in the European Union for\n\nup to ten years. We are currently involved in litigation with Transkaryotic\n\nTherapies related to its product. For more information about this litigation,\n\nyou should read the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled \"Item 3.\n\nLegal Proceedings.\"\n\nOTHER LYSOSOMAL STORAGE DISEASES. Genzyme General is aware of other\n\ncompanies and institutions that are researching and developing enzyme\n\nreplacement therapies, small molecules and gene therapies for lysosomal storage\n\ndiseases. These include products for Fabry, Pompe, MPS-I and other lysosomal\n\nstorage diseases Genzyme General and its collaborative partners are currently\n\npursuing.\n\nNEUROCELL-TM--PD. While there currently are no effective long-term\n\ntherapies for advanced Parkinson's disease, Genzyme General is aware of other\n\ncompanies and institutions pursuing research and development of alternative\n\ntreatments for the diseases. Experimental therapies under development for\n\nParkinson's disease include surgical destruction of certain portions of the\n\nbrain (pallidotomy), gene therapy, cell therapy, the use of growth factors and\n\nneuroprotectant therapy.\n\nDIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS. Genzyme General acts as a primary supplier of enzymes\n\nand substrates, and generally does not compete with its customers in the sale of\n\ncomplete diagnostic kits. The market in the diagnostic products industry is\n\nmature and competition is based on price, reliability of supply and the purity\n\nand specific activity of products.\n\nGENETIC DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES. The U.S. market for prenatal cytogenetic and\n\nbiochemical testing is divided among approximately 500 laboratories, many of\n\nwhich offer both types of testing. Of this total group, less than 20\n\nlaboratories market their services nationally. Genzyme General believes that the\n\nindustry as a whole is still quite fragmented, with the top 20 laboratories\n\naccounting for approximately 50% of market revenues, and with no individual\n\ncompany accounting for more than 18% of the total other than Genzyme, which\n\naccounts for approximately 22% of the total. Genzyme General believes, however,\n\nthat the industry will experience increasing consolidation as smaller\n\nlaboratories face the challenges of more complex and stringent regulation. The\n\nSecretary of Health and Human Services Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing\n\nrecently published recommendations for increased oversight by the Centers for\n\nDisease Control and the FDA for all genetic testing. This oversight will be\n\nsimilar to that of the current non-genetic diagnostic products. It requires\n\nsystems and expertise not normally found in small clinical laboratories.\n\nCompetitive factors in the genetic diagnostics services business generally\n\ninclude reputation of the laboratory, range of services offered, pricing,\n\nconvenience of sample collection and pick-up, quality of analysis and reporting\n\nand timeliness of delivery of completed reports. Genzyme General believes that\n\nits research and development program, which has enabled it to develop and\n\nintroduce testing services based on new technology, and its active sales and\n\nmarketing force have played significant roles in the growth of its genetic\n\ndiagnostics services business.\n\nFLUID MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND SUTURES. The principal methods by which\n\nGenzyme Biosurgery competes in the fluid management and sutures markets are:\n\n- continued innovative product development;\n\n- the performance and breadth of its product lines;\n\n- brand name recognition;\n\n- sales force training; and\n\n- educational services, including sponsorship of training programs in\n\nadvanced surgical techniques.\n\n23\n\nIts chief competitors in the fluid management market are Atrium Medical\n\nCorporation and Sherwood-Davis & Geck, a division of Tyco International, Ltd. We\n\nhave initiated a lawsuit against Atrium related to its chest drainage systems.\n\nFor more information about this litigation, you should read the section of this\n\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K entitled \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\" U.S. Surgical\n\nCorporation, a division of Tyco, and the Ethicon division of Johnson & Johnson\n\nare Genzyme Biosurgery's primary competitors in the cardiovascular sutures\n\nmarket.\n\nSURGICAL INSTRUMENTS. Genzyme Biosurgery competes against a wide range of\n\ncompanies in the traditional general, cardiovascular and plastic surgery\n\ninstrument markets. In the general surgical instrument area, U.S. Surgical and\n\nEthicon Endosurgery are Genzyme Biosurgery's primary competitors. In the\n\ntraditional cardiovascular instrument market, Genzyme Biosurgery competes\n\nprimarily with V. Meuller, the Pilling-Weck Surgical Instruments division of\n\nTeleflex, Inc. and the Codman division of Johnson and Johnson Ltd. The plastic\n\nsurgery instrument market is more highly fragmented with primary competition\n\narising from Karl Storz Surgical Instruments, Walter Lorenz Surgical and Padgett\n\nInstruments.\n\nMINIMALLY INVASIVE CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY. Genzyme Biosurgery faces\n\ncompetitors in the minimally invasive cardiovascular surgery field.\n\nCardioThoracic Systems, Inc., which was recently acquired by Guidant\n\nCorporation, was founded solely to pursue minimally invasive cardiovascular\n\nsurgery and was among the first companies to draw national attention to the\n\ntechnology. Several other major surgical products companies have also entered\n\nthe minimally invasive cardiovascular surgery market, including\n\nMedtronic, Inc., U.S. Surgical and Ethicon.\n\nCELL THERAPIES FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. Genzyme Biosurgery is aware of a\n\nnumber of companies and institutions that are developing or considering the\n\ndevelopment of tissue engineering products for the treatment of cardiovascular\n\ndisease. These activities include programs for heart muscle regeneration\n\nutilizing autologous skeletal muscle cells, autologous bone marrow derived\n\nstromal cells and embryonic stem cells. Among a number of organizations, Genzyme\n\nBiosurgery is aware of product development work in these areas at Diacrin, Inc.,\n\nBiohart, Inc., Cardion, AG and research programs at Duke University and Indiana\n\nUniversity. These organizations may develop products or technology that could\n\ndirectly compete with products and technology currently under development within\n\nGenzyme Biosurgery.\n\nTHERAPIES FOR ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE. There is considerable competition in\n\nthe development of protein and gene therapies to induce angiogenesis for the\n\ntreatment of ischemic heart disease. Several companies have initiated clinical\n\ntrials of gene and protein therapies for ischemic heart disease, and other\n\ncompanies have products that are still in pre-clinical development. Genzyme\n\nBiosurgery is aware of ongoing research in cell-based approaches to restoring\n\ncardiac function to infarcted tissue. Academic institutions and private\n\ncompanies are also conducting research to develop mechanical devices to reduce\n\nventricular size, to minimize ventricular dilation and to perform coronary\n\nfunctions.\n\nTHERAPIES FOR PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE. There is considerable\n\ncompetition in the development of protein and gene therapies to induce\n\nangiogenesis for the treatment of periopheral vascular disease.\n\nTHERAPIES FOR CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE. Many pharmaceutical and\n\nbiotechnology companies have programs to identify new therapies to manage\n\ncongestive heart failure. Many of these programs are targeted toward optimizing\n\ndrugs already used for disease management. Since the formation of scar tissue, a\n\nconsequence of myocardial infarction, is one of the causes of congestive heart\n\nfailure, scar tissue repair may provide significant benefit to the congestive\n\nheart failure patient. As discussed above, Genzyme Biosurgery is aware of\n\nseveral research programs involving cell-based approaches to restoring cardiac\n\nfunction and a research program involving a gene therapy approach to converting\n\nmyofibroblasts into cardiac muscle.\n\n24\n\nSEPRA-TM- PRODUCTS. Genzyme Biosurgery believes that its technology,\n\nexpertise, and proprietary manufacturing processes in developing and producing\n\nhyaluronan-based materials will give it a competitive advantage in the marketing\n\nof the Sepra-TM- products. Its anti-adhesion products may face significant\n\ncompetition, however, from other products based on hyaluronan as well as from\n\nother products and changes in surgical techniques that may obviate the use of\n\nhyaluronan. Genzyme Biosurgery believes that the principal factor that will\n\naffect competition in this area is acceptance of the product by surgeons, which\n\ndepends, in large part, upon product performance, safety and price.\n\nSeprafilm-TM- bioresorbable membrane does not have significant direct\n\ncompetition in the colorectal surgery market. Ethicon markets\n\nInterceed-Registered Trademark-, an anti-adhesion barrier that may have\n\nproperties similar to the Seprafilm-TM- product, but is indicated only for\n\nselected gynecological indications. Interceed-Registered Trademark- has been\n\nshown to lose its anti-adhesion properties in the presence of blood. Lifecore\n\nBiomedical, Inc. and Ethicon's Intergel-TM- product, a gel-based anti-adhesion\n\nproduct, is marketed in Europe. Gliatech, Inc. has completed pivotal clinical\n\ntrials of Adcon-A and Adcon-P, which are designed to limit adhesions after\n\nabdominal and pelvic surgery. Life Medical Sciences, Inc. is developing REPEL\n\nfor gynecological surgery and REPEL-CV for cardiovascular surgery. These\n\nadhesion barrier membranes are in early clinical trials.\n\nSYNVISC-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-. Competition for\n\nSynvisc-Registered Trademark- consists primarily of products based on earlier\n\ntechnology, including Hylagan-Registered Trademark-, produced by Fidia S.p.A.\n\nand marketed in the United States by Sanofi-Synthelabo,\n\nOrthovisc-Registered Trademark-, produced by Anika Therapeutics, Inc. and\n\nArtz-TM-, a Japanese product marketed in Japan and Europe which was recently\n\napproved in the United States and will be sold under the name Supartz-TM- by\n\nSmith & Nephew Orthopedics. To the best of Genzyme Biosurgery's knowledge, there\n\nare no other viscosupplementation products on the market, or in development,\n\nwhich like Synvisc-Registered Trademark-, have the physical properties of\n\nviscosity, elasticity or molecular weight that are comparable to the physical\n\nproperties of healthy synovial fluid.\n\nCARTICEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- CHONDROCYTES. Genzyme Biosurgery is aware of\n\ntwo other companies, Verigen, Inc., and Co.don Berlin, which are culturing\n\nautologous chondrocytes for cartilage repair in Europe. In addition to Verigen,\n\nGenzyme Biosurgery knows of three other companies, Advanced Tissue\n\nSciences, Inc., in conjunction with Smith & Nephew PLC, Integra LifeSciences\n\nCorp. and LifeCell Corp., which are engaged in research on cultured cartilage\n\nproducts. In addition, a surgical technique known as osteochondral grafting may\n\nbe competitive to Carticel-Registered Trademark- chondrocytes. This procedure,\n\nwhich can be performed arthroscopically, involves transferring plugs of low\n\nweight bearing cartilage and bone to the area of a defect. Smith & Nephew,\n\nArthrex, Inc. and Innovasive Devices, Inc. are known to have programs relating\n\nto this procedure.\n\nEPICEL-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- SKIN GRAFTS. Genzyme Biosurgery is the only\n\ncommercial provider of cultured skin grafts that have been shown to provide\n\npermanent skin replacement for burn patients in the United States. However,\n\nGenzyme Biosurgery may face competition from companies using other approaches to\n\nculture skin tissue. Integra is marketing a collagen-based dermal replacement\n\nproduct for severely burned patients. This product will still require a skin\n\ngraft from the patient or Epicel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- skin grafts to close a\n\nfull-thickness wound, however, and therefore will not compete directly with\n\nEpicel-REGISTERED TRADEMARK- skin grafts. Advanced Tissue Sciences, Inc. has\n\nreceived approval for a temporary wound covering for burns. Organogenesis, Inc.\n\nhas submitted a Pre-Marketing Application for a product to be used for the\n\nclosure of venous stasis ulcers. LifeCell Corp. currently has freeze-dried\n\nenzymatically processed human cadaver dermis on the market.\n\nCANCER. Competition in the field of cancer therapeutics is intense. Genzyme\n\nMolecular Oncology faces, and will continue to face, significant competition\n\nfrom organizations such as large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies,\n\nuniversities, government agencies and other research institutions.\n\n25\n\nCompetition can arise from the use of the same or similar technologies as\n\nthose currently used or contemplated to be used by Genzyme Molecular Oncology,\n\nas well as from existing therapies. Any or all of these may be more effective or\n\nless expensive than those developed by Genzyme Molecular Oncology.\n\nGenzyme Molecular Oncology relies on its collaborators for support in some\n\nof its cancer research and development programs and intends to rely on these\n\npartners for preclinical evaluation, clinical development and marketing of its\n\npotential products and services. Its partners may develop technologies or\n\nproducts that are competitive with those that Genzyme Molecular Oncology is\n\ndeveloping. Genzyme Molecular Oncology's product candidates, therefore, may be\n\nsubject to competition with a potential product under development by one of its\n\npartners.\n\nPATENTS, LICENSE AGREEMENTS AND TRADEMARKS\n\nIn general, we pursue a policy of obtaining patent protection both in the\n\nUnited States and in selected foreign countries for subject matter we consider\n\npatentable and important to our business.
