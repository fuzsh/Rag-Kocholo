        "text": "This patient's MRI scan shows a few periventricular T2 lesions that, to my eye, look fairly suspicious for MS, but in addition to that, it shows a T2 lesion in the cervical spinal cord, which is also very suspicious for an episode of partial myelitis. Nothing looks as if it enhances with gadolinium contrast. On this scan, what we see are multiple T2 lesions that may potentially be consistent with MS. The culprit lesion that explains the symptoms he initially presented with is probably the cervical spine lesion.\n\nMs Namey: The lesions in his brain did not cause symptoms?\n\nDr Bermel: That is correct, the brain lesions are probably asymptomatic, and that is what we commonly see early in MS. Patients who are at higher risk to eventually develop MS tend to have prior asymptomatic lesions in the brain. We will talk about that a bit more later.\n\nThere are classic presentations.[2] This man's presentation reflected the myelitis; transverse myelitis is a very classic presentation. Optic neuritis is also a very classic presentation. Optic neuritis could manifest as a change in visual acuity with or without pain in the eye. We also see a brainstem syndrome that can be so disturbing, and people do not understand as well; dizziness or vertigo, with no apparent precipitating factors, and perhaps with some eye movements.\n\nDr Bermel: Double vision, balance problems, this is scary, right?\n\nDr Coyle: What factors determine whether we treat with DMTs at the stage of a first attack?\n\nMs Namey: When we talk about CIS, it is actually early MS most of the time, is that what you would think?\n\nDr Bermel: We used to think of CIS as a first attack, as a separate entity, and RRMS really required multiple episodes occurring over time. As time has gone on, the diagnostic criteria for MS have evolved,[1] whereby now we think of CIS as the earliest stage of RRMS. We can move on and talk about the diagnostic criteria and how they have evolved over time, but at this stage, ruling out other potential causes for the patient's symptoms is very important. In a case like this, where this person's symptoms and MRI scan are fairly typical, we tend to send screening blood tests looking for other potential causes for CIS and the patient's symptoms. If there are atypical features we tend to be slightly more broad in the tests we might include. Being confident in the diagnosis is very important at this stage, to ensure we have excluded other causes.\n\nMs Namey: We have come a long way in defining CIS and RRMS. Years ago, when we did not have this MRI tool that can help us so much, patients were often in limbo, as were clinicians. Let us look at the criteria that helps to classify MS.[1]\n\nDr Bermel: You will remember that we used to require multiple events happening over time, whether they were clinical events that happened more than once consistent with MS, or MRI events separated in time. In 2005, you needed to have multiple MRI scans separated by at least 3 months in time, showing new activity, to be able to classify someone as having RRMS.[3]\n\nIn 2010 and actually published in 2011, the new international panel criteria for MS allowed diagnosis of MS at the time of a first attack, at the time of a CIS with a single MRI scan.[1] That was possible because you can see the combination of new enhancing brain lesions and older lesions on the MRI at the same time; the different lesion types on the scan actually show that dissemination in time. The MRI is catching multiple lesions at different stages of the lifecycle -- that is the way I like to think about it. It is really that first attack part, the part that I have highlighted in this Table, this is a part of the diagnostic criteria that has changed the most in the updated 2010 international panel criteria.\n\nMs Namey: You do not have to wait until the person has another bad episode or attack to make a diagnosis of MS?\n\nDr Bermel: Right. We used to be in a limbo stage during which you were suspicious of RRMS, but you would say, we should check a follow-up MRI scan a few months from now to confirm it. In certain circumstances, when we see a combination of non-enhancing and enhancing lesions, we can demonstrate dissemination in space and dissemination in time.\n\nMs Namey: When we take care of people who have MS, we must individualize their treatment plans. No 2 people with MS are alike, no 2 people present with the same symptoms or have the same MRI activity, whether it be active or something we find incidentally. We have to think hard and personalize our patient care, including not only the disease-modifying therapy (DMT), but also paying attention to symptoms, because symptoms are what affect the patient's quality of life. People talk about their symptoms when they come to see us, they share their frustrations with MS symptoms.\n\nWe also have to pay attention to wellness. People often want to know what they can do to help themselves now that they have had this episode, whether CIS or RRMS. The patient's focus on wellness is important, and we as healthcare providers also need to focus on that with the patient. Patients want to take ownership of this, so diet, exercise, and psychological support can all be quite helpful for our patients.\n\nDr Bermel: It is helpful to think of management in these 3 categories: DMT, symptom management, and the wellness aspect of treating MS. I believe that addressing all 3 categories individually is important, and it is also important to know that you should not substitute 1 category for a different category.\n\nPeople will ask whether they can take dietary supplements and whether they should exercise, and yes, they should do that. We encourage vitamin D supplementation in patients with MS, we encourage exercise, we encourage healthy living and a healthy diet with low sodium and low saturated fat, but should those substitute for the DMTs? Certainly not.\n\nIt does not mean that just because you have addressed those 2 things, you should not also address the symptomatic therapy. That is really why it is important to cover all 3. Although much of the focus in patients with CIS is getting the diagnosis correct and deciding whether to treat with the DMT, I believe it is as important to address those other factors.\n\nMs Namey: We have talked about this many times when we see patients in the clinic. A patient can be taking a DMT and still have persistent symptoms. Sometimes then the patient will think, wow, this treatment is not working for me, I still have symptoms. Even though we placed great importance and focus on MRI and DMT, if the person's bladder is not working right for them, or if they have residual weakness from an attack, then that patient needs a bladder evaluation or physical therapy, or something along the lines of taking care of those symptoms too.\n\nDr Coyle: When and how do you use steroids in a first attack?\n\nDr Bermel: One of the first questions I usually get from a patient with a CIS is, \"I have read about this optic neuritis, or I have read about transverse myelitis, and it says the treatment is steroids.\" Patients ask me if they should be treated with steroids. You have heard me give my take on this many times, but the criterion I have in my head, and I utilize for whether to treat with steroids is, first, has the patient recovered yet? This patient we have presented has recovered about 80%, therefore, he has not completely recovered.\n\nThe other criterion is how disabling the attack is. If the patient is currently unable to work or unable to perform some sort of key activity because of his current disability from this attack, it would make me more likely to treat that patient with steroids. In optic neuritis, we know from the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial[4] that treating with steroids had some benefit in improving the speed of recovery if the patient has visual acuity of 20/40 or worse. Patients with a visual acuity of 20/40 or better were likely to improve on their own actually, even without steroids.\n\nThose are some of the criteria I use when deciding whether we should treat a patient with steroids, because steroids are associated with adverse effects, as you know.\n\nMs Namey: Dr Bermel, the patient we have discussed had MRI lesions, but he did not have a gadolinium-enhancing lesion that caused him to have symptoms. What are his chances of developing RRMS if we are saying that clinically he has CIS?\n\nDr Bermel: After \"Should I be treated with steroids?\" this is usually the other very common question we tackle in patients with CIS: \"What is my risk of developing MS?\" Fortunately, we actually have much data, as you know, that we can refer to about this risk. Some of my favorite data come from the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial,[4] where patients with optic neuritis, a CIS, were followed for 15 years to determine their risk of developing MS. The strongest predictor of whether they would go on to develop MS was the baseline brain MRI scan. Patients with more lesions on their baseline brain MRI scan were much more likely to go on to develop MS than patients who had a normal brain MRI scan, and the patients who had a small number of lesions, 1 to 3 lesions on their brain MRI scan, had a moderate risk of developing MS. This really put the emphasis on the baseline MRI scan.\n\nThere are also data from the Queen's Square group,[5] which has followed a huge cohort of patients with CIS for up to 20 years. We have great data for that 20-year follow-up, looking at the baseline MRI scan related to the risk of MS. As it turns out, the risk of MS in someone with a normal brain MRI scan is fairly low; 80% of those people remained almost at the CIS stage of disease without ever developing a second attack. On the other end, 81% of patients who had ≥10 lesions developed MS by 20 years, so it is almost like a flip. If you have a normal scan, you are 80% likely to remain at that first attack stage and if you have ≥10 lesions, you are 80% likely to develop MS over 20 years. These are numbers we can use with patients, as you know.\n\nMs Namey: The type of symptoms people have is not as strong a predictor as the MRI activity of whether or not they will develop RRMS.\n\nDr Bermel: Correct. It is really the baseline brain MRI that we use that has the highest predictive value of whether a patient will go on to develop MS. It also has prognostic value. The other piece that came out of that Queens Square study group was that the patients who had very few lesions at baseline were much less likely to develop higher disability levels. The patients who had more lesions at baseline were somewhat more at risk for developing higher levels of disability over 20 years, so we also use it for this kind of prognostic information.\n\nMs Namey: For our gentleman who had this altered sensation, this numbness and tingling, should he be treated with a DMT?\n\nDr Bermel: That is a great question, There are multiple factors to consider when thinking about this. For me, the first factor is the certainty of the diagnosis. How sure are we that this is a first attack of MS? Often, we will have patients who have symptoms or MRI scans that are not quite as specific as this patient's. In those cases, we may potentially even take a monitoring, off-treatment type approach, if we are not sure that this is a first demyelinating event. If we are sure that it is a first demyelinating event, then we move on and begin to seriously think about DMT, even at that first attack stage. The MRI scan, as I mentioned, is 1 of the most important factors to consider.[5] I tend to be a bit more worried about the patients with more lesions that are typical for MS and I tend to think about treating them with DMT at the earliest stage.\n\nThe other factor to consider is how well they recovered from their first attack. A very nice piece of work was done by Ellen Mowry[6] that shows that the degree to which people recover from their first attack with MS tends to predict how they will recover from subsequent attacks. If they really only made a partial recovery from their first attack, that means they are at a higher risk of developing neurologic problems if they have a second attack. Therefore, we tend to be more likely to start DMT in patients who do not recover well.\n\nMs Namey: I know in your mind and the minds of most clinicians who take care of people with MS, it is clear and important that we educate patients that what we try to accomplish with early treatment is to prevent further disability down the line, prevent further relapses, and also prevent more MRI activity, which could ultimately cause more symptoms and disability over time. That is such an important piece of information to clearly communicate to our patients because it is not intuitive for most people to start a medicine when they are not quite sure what is going to happen down the line.\n\nDr Bermel: That is correct. Once we have decided that we are going to start DMT, the next question that comes up is, which therapy should I start? Nowadays, we actually have 10 or 11 options to start with, and thus it becomes even more complicated than it used to be. I have a few guiding principles. I would say that all of the medications that we talk about for MS, the DMTs, are approved for relapsing forms of MS and technically that includes the first attack stage. My personal view on this is that all of the available DMTs are potentially an option, each is an option in a patient, even at the first attack stage.\n\nI tend to categorize the options into groups: the injectable medications, like interferons and glatiramer acetate; the oral medications such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate; and the monoclonal antibody (mAb) infusions like natalizumab. I tend to think of them in those 3 categories. I believe that any of the categories is potentially useful and we may use them in the first attack stage.\n\nThe most data we have in that very early, CIS population, are from the injectables, and for that reason many clinicians still rely on the injectable medications at that first attack stage. We have much safety data and history with these agents in patients with MS, and also they have been tried in that CIS population.[7,8] But that does not mean that we do not use oral DMTs in these cases.\n\nIn fact, many practitioners I have talked to are using oral DMTs at the first attack stage if a patient is opposed to injections; or, in some cases, if the clinician is worried about a slightly more dangerous prognosis in a given person, the clinician may want to use a therapy with a slightly higher efficacy, such as one of the oral medications or a monoclonal antibody. As you know, the monoclonal antibodies and the infusion medication have been tested head to head against the injectables and have been shown to be somewhat more effective if we test them in groups of populations.[9]\n\nIt does not mean that we can guarantee that one is going to be more effective than the other in an individual, but based on limited data we think the likelihood of beginning an effective therapy as early as possible is slightly higher if we use 1 of the orals or the monoclonal antibody in those people we are more worried about. We do take prognostic factors into account, some of which I talked about when we discussed MRIs.\n\nMs Namey: You have explained nicely all that goes into your thinking in terms of starting a patient on a DMT and which might be best. Part of this decision making includes the patient; there is so much in terms of risk and benefit, so much education to be shared with the patient in terms of the safety of each medication, and your particular experience as a healthcare provider certainly plays into this quite a bit. From the patient's perspective, factors include what the patient will tolerate and what will be easiest to take. It may not be intuitive for a patient to take an injectable, it may not fit into the patient's lifestyle, if that person is a busy mother or a traveler. There are all these different considerations in terms of what happens in life. Most of our patients who have MS are younger women and we have to consider pregnancy issues. As clinicians, we need to consider how much monitoring is involved with each of these individual medications. What is that mechanism of action? How does that play into other things that may be going on in the patient's life and other comorbidities?\n\nSome of these symptoms are not going to go away and may not get better over time, and that is truly not an indication that the medicine is not working, it just might be that the irritation or the damage related to MS has caused that symptom to persist. We also cannot forget the family. The family members have to be involved as well to provide the patients with a good support system. This is just a huge event; one person is diagnosed with CIS or RRMS and there is a big change, big decisions they have to make in their lives, and we are a big part of that.\n\nI cannot say enough about education; it is very important. Soon after diagnosis, whether it be CIS or RRMS, the patient needs to have a certain amount of time to spend with the healthcare provider, either 1 on 1, or at a shared medical appointment where the patient can talk with other individuals who have MS also, and start to develop that network of people.\n\nDr Bermel: As we talk to patients about whether or not they should start DMT, one of the important issues is the evidence in support of early treatment, at the CIS stage. We now have an overabundance of evidence that we should begin treatment at the earliest possible stage, when we are confident that the patient has active RRMS, even if it is at that first attack stage, with an MRI scan that shows activity consistent with the disease.[11-16]\n\nSome of the evidence I like to tell patients about is that we should not think about treating as early as days or even weeks but as months, which could potentially make a difference; certainly a year or 2, in terms of starting early, can make a difference. Data from the early interferon studies[11,15,16] with 4 years of follow-up showed us that when patients were on the interferon medication 1 year earlier, there was a difference, with fewer symptoms and less disability when compared with patients who were not on interferon; the untreated patient population never caught up in terms of how well they did. Years can make a difference in this kind of scenario, so we stress the idea of beginning therapy early.\n\nMs Namey: I have seen that particularly over the years, having been in MS care before the DMTs were approved. The waiting room has an entirely different appearance now. If we can start our patients early on treatment, hopefully we can delay disability and delay the use or eventuality of even using a cane or a walker and needing a wheelchair.\n\nDr Bermel: In my practice, I like to think of MRI lesions and brain atrophy, all sequelae of MS, as brain damage, and I will explain it to patients that way. If I really feel that they need to begin therapy, but the patient does not quite understand why, I will try to explain that we are trying to prevent that kind of brain damage and prevent relapses (which sometimes people do not recover from completely and lead to lost time). We are trying to prevent all these things.\n\nMs Namey: If a patient is entirely new to MS, we really have to stress that idea. If a person has had a relative or has seen other individuals with MS, they have that bit of a worry. They do not want to be like that, they do not want to have that disability, and so it might be a shorter conversation when talking to patients about treating early.\n\nThere are so many choices, as you mentioned, and we have to think about all the factors that influence our choice of therapy.[17] Some of these factors include the clinical subtype, the types of symptoms a person has experienced, how well the person has recovered from those symptoms, and also how long they have had the disease. If a person has newly diagnosed CIS, we certainly want to start individuals on treatment sooner than later, but it is almost never too late these days to begin a treatment for MS.\n\nWe also must pay attention to comorbidities people with MS have, because that could also influence the course of MS progression or the treatments that we decide to prescribe. Again, getting to know your patient as best as you can will help with this decision making process.\n\nMs Namey: We talked a bit about it a moment ago. The medications have been designed to be taken at regular intervals, and if patients do not take the medication at regular intervals the medication may not work as we would hope. This patient admitted to partial nonadherence with the interferon regimen. I am not sure exactly why this was the case. Maybe he was needle phobic, maybe he did not communicate that this was a concern for him when we started treatment. He was not taking his medication regularly, and he had a subsequent attack. In all honesty, he could have had a subsequent attack even if he had taken the medication.\n\nDr Bermel: That is correct.\n\nMs Namey: When we talk about individuals who were initially diagnosed with CIS and then evolve into RRMS, what do we think of now in terms of treatment options?\n\nDr Bermel: As I mentioned, I do not believe the treatment options necessarily change. The menu, if you will, of treatment options is essentially the same for patients who are at the first attack stage vs the RRMS stage. When someone has been taking a DMT and has not done well on it, whether because of nonadherence or true breakthrough disease activity on that therapy, however, that definitely changes the options.\n\nOur preference tends to be to change that person's treatment, certainly to one with a different mechanism of action. In this patient, it would be important to figure out why he was not adherent. Did we effectively communicate the importance of adherence? Did he find it difficult to administer an injectable medication? Is it because of some specific adverse effect of that specific medication? It is really important to drill down and find the reason for his nonadherence, so that when we pick a new medication and regimen, what we choose will be easier for this man to adhere to. I will probably try a medication with a different mechanism of action and potentially a different mode of administration, because we usually need to make a change when a patient has an attack like this.\n\nMs Namey: I think sometimes we assume that our patients understand the importance of adherence to therapy, but then, when they go out into their homes and their communities, circumstances obviously may change for them. When someone has symptoms and the symptoms resolve, that person may think, \"I am better now. I do not necessarily need this medicine.\" Again, it is that constant education, constant communication with our patients about how they are doing with treatment. Are they consistent with taking their medication as prescribed?\n\nCan we formulate an algorithm for individuals who are initially diagnosed with CIS and then have another episode and progress to RRMS?\n\nAt the Cleveland Clinic, we have 14 neurologists and 9 advanced practice clinicians across our different practices, and we have a similar philosophy with how we treat patients with RRMS. Recently we have codified that philosophy and concluded that there is no single choice we can make for every patient, there are no rules we can set up about which DMT you should use and when, but we do have a framework.\n\nThat framework involves making the diagnosis correctly and deciding initially whether it is important to treat. Regardless, continue to monitor the patient. Then if the patient begins a DMT, they typically go into a monitoring plan where we monitor them for tolerability of the medications at 3 months and then follow up as early as 6 months to determine whether the DMT is effective, whether it is working. As you know, we monitor the patients clinically -- we see them, examine them, ask them about what has happened during the past months -- and we check disease activity with an MRI scan at 6 months.\n\nThe question that comes up is whether to change DMT if you see activity on that MRI scan, when the patient feels fine and has no new clinical symptoms. If we see breakthrough disease activity on the MRI that concerns us, we begin by asking patients if they are able to be adherent to the medication regimen, and if they are not, why? What factors are interfering with adherence? If they have been adherent, maybe that medication is not as optimally effective as we would like. This tends to be our routine, and even if the patient is stable and the MRI is stable at that 6-month visit, we check another MRI 6 months later and sometimes yearly thereafter, sometimes every couple of years after the first 4 or 5 years of the disease.\n\nThat first attack stage, CIS, is increasingly being thought of as the earliest form of RRMS. When we are confident that inflammatory demyelination is the cause of the patient's symptoms and the patient appears at high risk for MS, we are starting treatment fairly early these days.\n\nMRI plays a key role in making those decisions, both in terms of making the diagnosis and in formulating a prognosis and the patient's risk of developing further attacks. Unfortunately, there is no easy answer, there is no universal treatment algorithm that would work for everyone. We have no \"go to\" medication that works perfectly in everyone. We do not even have a genetic blood test or other test we can prospectively use to decide which medication would work best in which individual person.\n\nIn the absence of that, I believe we all have certain guiding principles in our minds. We monitor patients closely for adherence and for efficacy of the therapy to make sure that the strategy we have chosen is an effective one for that patient.\n\nDr Coyle: Thank you Dr Bermel and Ms Namey for this informative discussion and thank you for participating in this activity. Remember, coming up next in part 3 of this series, we will discuss how to treat and manage the later, more debilitating phase of progressive MS. What you learn in part 3 can help your patients maintain the best possible quality of life during the period when MS can be most challenging for you and your patients.\n\nNow click on the earn CME CE credit link to revisit the questions presented at the beginning of the activity and see what you have learned. The CME CE posttest and evaluation will follow."
