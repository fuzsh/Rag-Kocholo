        "text": "Date Of Birth\n\nSeptember 24, 1979\n\nBiography\n\nAmerican actor Justin Bruening was born on September 24, 1979 in St. Helena, Nebraska. After graduating in high school, he moved to San Diego, California, where he was discovered by a talent scout. This led to his early modeling career, posing for Abercrombie and Fitch. He then studied acting, after which he was discovered by a casting director for the daytime soap All My Children. Originally intending to audition for the character of J.R. Chandler (which was later snagged by Jason Young), he was instead cast as Jamie Martin in the long-running soap.\n\nHis character was the result of an ill-fated relationship between Tad Martin (Michael E. Knight) and Brooke English (Julia Barr). After an uneventful childhood spent moving between his parents’ homes, he grew up and at one point fathered a child with Babe Chandler, (Alexa Havins) the wife of his stepbrother. He was also known for being violent at times, having committed several crimes throughout his four-year run in the show. He left the show in 2007, after 160 episodes and an eight-episode run on One Life to Live in a crossover storyline; his character followed an uncle to Africa.\n\nDuring the time, Bruening also made a guest appearance on Hope & Faith and 3 lbs. He made his film debut in 2006, playing a supporting role in the offbeat comedy Fat Girls. After his run on All My Children—where he was voted as the hottest daytime star by multiple teen magazines—he played guest roles on Cold Case and CSI: Miami. He has recently appeared on the television movie Knight Rider, a new take on the 1980s television series. He played the role of Mike Traceur, the estranged son of the original Knight Rider (David Hasselhoff). He is set to reprise the role in the television series of the same name.\n\nPlace of Birth\n\nSt. Helena, Nebraska USA\n\nBirth Name\n\nJustin Bruening\n\nGender\n\nMale\n\nFun Facts\n\n– Is married to his “All My Children” costar, Alexa Havens\n\n– Former model\n\n– Character on “All My Children” is the son of the character played by Michael E.
