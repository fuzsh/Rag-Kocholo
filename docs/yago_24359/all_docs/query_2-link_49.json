        "text": "“It was a cold and rainy day in February. I was walking from one side of campus to the other to try and make it to my class on time. When I arrive, no one was there… class has been canceled! As I turned to walk away, Chase was walking towards the classroom. I saw him and said, “Are you in this class?” He responded “Yes!” And I quickly said back “it’s canceled!” And away I went doing my usual fast walk. Chase followed me outside and towards the SUB. He noticed my backpack had my sorority pins all over it and he asked me a question. “Are you in Alpha Chi?” I turned around shocked that he was wanting to talk to me. I responded and said “yep!” He then says “I’m in Fiji!” We then started to talk about Greek life and as we approached the SUB I told him that I had time before going to work so I was going to eat something. He looked down at his feet then looked back up at me and said “is it okay if I join you?”\n\nWe ate together, talked about our upbringings, and I quickly fell for him.\n\nThank you Boise State for bringing us together It’s been 5 years and I’m thankful every day I ran into Chase on campus!”\n\n“Aaron and I met in our second years at Boise State. He was a (non-traditional) sophomore earning his BS in Chemistry, I was a second-year Ph.D. student in BioMolecular sciences. He had just joined my lab as an undergrad. At first, I gave him no thought, as I was in a relationship at the time and he was a tie-dye wearing metal head (clearly not my type). He joined my project and I was tasked with training him in lab techniques. We developed a friendship and a bond over his love for the outdoors, and my desire to participate in outdoor activities. Well, the pandemic hit, I ended my relationship, and we took social distancing very seriously by hiking Idaho’s twelvers, which at the time meant hiking wherein you might see one other group in the course of a weekend. 8 of 9 twelvers, lots of outdoor adventures, and nearly two years (and two states) later, we are going strong! Photo is of us on top of Lost River peak in the Lost River Range in Idaho with our two roommates of the time, (also Boise State alumni)!”\n\n“Kevin and I met in the Towers Dorm in 1984. I had just relocated to Boise from St. Louis and didn’t know a single person in Idaho outside my family. The first night after I had moved into the dorm I came home around midnight. Kevin was just getting off duty as the residential advisor of Towers and we entered the elevator at the same time. He said “Hi Stephanie”, which took me by surprise since I didn’t know him, but he knew my name. He then asked me if I had been on a hot date and I replied, “No, I was with my brother at the Fair”. He then got a big smile on his face, got off the elevator, turned around and said, “Well, I guess I will be seeing you later” and winked at me. Well, he was right about that! Three days later, Kevin and I bumped into each other in the Towers lobby. It was at this time he asked me out. I responded that I didn’t know anything about him, so I wasn’t sure if I felt comfortable going on a date with him. He proceeded to tell me he was an RA in the Towers dorm, he was on the BSU Golf team, a BSU Cheerleader and a gymnast. So I told him if he could do a backflip right here, I would go on a date with him. And just like that, he did a standing backflip and we were off to Ice Cream Alley in downtown Boise. The date was a huge success! We stayed up all night talking, laughing and telling each other jokes. We were both so young when we met, so we took our time and dated for 9 years before marrying in August 1993. We have been married for 27 years and have 2 beautiful children, Alexa and Brian. We have had such wonderful times together and are still huge Boise State fans – Go Broncos.”\n\n“I met a lot of new people when I was an orientation leader. One of those people introduced me to my now-husband. It was orientation season and all of us orientation leaders were incredibly exhausted. We happened to have a weekend free and it happened to be one of our birthdays. She decided it would be a great time to have all of us over to celebrate. Her boyfriend agreed and brought all of his friends. After talking to her and her boyfriend for a while they both agreed I needed to meet their friend. He and I hit it off right away, but we were both too shy to get each other’s number. Luckily, my friend was not! Sadly, my now-husband hit delete instead of save! Shortly after we left my friend’s house, I heard someone calling my name down the street. It was my now husband running after me because he knew he had to see me again. We spent our last two years at Boise state attending every football and basketball game and still enjoy going to games as much as possible and remembering all the incredible times we had together on campus. Boise State will forever be the place that changed my life in so many ways.”\n\n“It was the fall of 1976. Our mutual friend, Tom Dougherty, tried to set us up with each other. He thought we’d make an adorable couple! Debi (studying boys more than business) thought he was too skinny, and Terry (studying girls more than a teaching degree) thought she was too snooty! But we ran around together as a group of friends, and got to know each other, as friends. Debi left college and went to work at a bank. A year later we ran into each other at Karcher Mall in Nampa. Terry was looking to buy a pair of pants for a date with someone else. So Debi, being the very nice, not snooty person that she is, was helping him. We couldn’t find what he wanted at Karcher Mall, so Debi knew of another shop not far from there. As Terry was getting into Debi’s car so she could take him there, she felt like she’d been struck by lightning! Immediately Debi knew that she was sitting next to her future husband! Tom was right after all! Terry hadn’t even asked her for a date yet! Terry did not feel that strike of lightning right away, but he did ask her for a date before the day was over. Five weeks later on February 7, 1978, we were engaged. We were married on August 12, 1978 in Caldwell, Idaho, followed by many amazing outdoor adventures with 3 kids and 3 grandkids. This year we will celebrate 46 wonderful and very happy years together.\n\nDebi returned to Boise State in 1991 to pursue an Elementary Ed degree, graduating in 1994, followed by careers with the Vallivue Schools as well as Idaho Fish & Game. Terry didn’t finish a degree but had a wonderful 37-year career at Hewlett Packard. We’re now both retired and loving life. If we hadn’t gone to Boise State, how different our lives would be! We still love cheering for our Broncos!!”\n\n“Michael and I were both studying Psychology at Boise State when we met in Dr. Landrum’s Research Methods class. We sat next to each other all semester so we were able to bounce our research ideas off each other. We were pretty good friends by the end of the course, but one day one of my friends in Blue Thunder Marching Band reached out to me to tell me that she’d met Michael while he was at work and he mentioned that he would like to see me again. We started dating and took several of the rest of our classes together, ultimately graduating together in the winter of 2016. Six years after we met, we’ve now been married for almost two years and recently bought our own home! We’re so grateful to have been brought together at Boise State!”\n\n“Tad and I met during the summer of 2005. Tad was a (redshirt) junior playing Boise State football and majoring in Criminal Justice. I was a sophomore transfer from Univ. of Idaho, majoring in Communication with an emphasis in Public Relations. I knew zero about football and Tad patiently taught me all the rules and most importantly, why the offensive line was so vital ;)\n\nThanks to Boise State University, we both received a great education, traveled to beautiful parts of the country, met wonderful life-long friends, and witnessed/played in the greatest football game ever, the 2007 Fiesta Bowl.\n\nWe were married in 2008 and have three amazing daughters. All three are die-hard Bronco fans, rocking dad’s old game jerseys to the games. Tad is currently a K-9 officer with the local police department and I work at a local communication agency. Go Broncos!”\n\n“In 2007 Andrew and I first saw each other at a fraternity and sorority social, where his fraternity cooked my sorority Thanksgiving dinner. We never got an opportunity to speak because Andrew was in the kitchen most of the night cooking. We ended up having a Political Science class together the following semester and after a few classes, I finally convinced him to stop sitting with his fraternity brothers and join me near the front of the class. We hit it off and started spending all of our time together.\n\nFrom the start of our relationship, we were both very involved at Boise State. Both of us would end up serving as Presidents of our fraternity and sorority, Andrew would go on to serve as the Executive Director of ASBSU Student Government, I would become heavily involved in the Future Alumni Network.\n\nWhen Andrew proposed he arranged for us to go into the Stueckle Sky Center one night to overlook campus. He got down on one knee and said, ‘this campus is where we met, where we had our first kiss, where I fell in love with you, and I wanted us to have one more memory here, will you marry me?’\n\nAt our wedding in 2011, we had nearly as many Boise State alumni, students, and faculty attending our wedding as we did family. I even surprised Andrew with a Boise State groom’s cake during the reception.\n\nAfter our wedding, Andrew and I both continued our education at Boise State earning our Master’s degrees in 2014 and 2018. We also stayed involved on campus by serving as alumni advisors to our fraternity and sorority.\n\nNow years later we are still avid Boise State supporters. I have spent the past 6 years working at Boise State in the Student Involvement and Leadership Center and during the fall you will always find us in the stands cheering on the Broncos at football games.\n\nThis June Andrew and I are expecting our first child, a baby girl, and it just so happens our first purchase was Boise State baby socks. We can’t wait to welcome our first child and future Boise State Bronco to the world!”\n\n“Tom and I first met during the summer of 2007 while working for Boise State Housing. We didn’t become close friends that year, but spent some time together during group activities and developed many mutual friends. The following summer, Tom graduated and moved away to Seattle. Shortly after he moved, we started talking more on our own and became good friends. Tom came back to visit Boise during December 2008 for his graduation ceremony, and we decided during that trip to start dating. He moved back to Boise about a year later, and the rest is history!\n\nWe were married in 2015 and moved to Portland. In 2018, we came back to Boise to be closer to family, and we brought with us one new resident – our sweet little baby boy, William. We’ve loved being back in the area so much and can’t wait to continue participating in Boise State events as a family for many years to come.”\n\n“Marty and I met at the Recreation Center in 1984 where we both worked while attending BSU. We were also members of Boise State’s bowling club, and our teams would often travel together to out-of-town tournaments. We became good friends. At one point in 1987, I was sharing an apartment with another Boise State student and we needed a third person to help meet monthly expenses. Marty was looking to move out of his parent’s basement, so he moved in. After several months we began to date, and have been together since. We married on June 30, 1989, and will celebrate our 32nd wedding anniversary this year. We have two sons, Brad and Brett. We are proud to say that we are lifetime alumni, and all four of us graduated from Boise State. Go Broncos!!”\n\n“I was an RA in the dorms (Suites) in spring of 2009 when Ryan moved in. I went to his room to introduce myself and let him know I was there if he needed anything. He wasn’t home so I asked his roommate to have him come by my room when he got home. There was a knock on my door later that night and I was shocked to see that not only did he actually come by, but he was so handsome! That semester we would say hi to each other in passing but that was it. At the end of the semester, we realized that we would both be living on campus over the summer. Ryan mentioned that we should hang out but I thought he was just being nice because I was the RA. A few weeks later he called me and we started to hang out. We became best friends that summer! We would cook food in the Keiser kitchen, take walks around the green belt, and watch movies in the Chaffee lounge. December of 2009 Ryan graduated and moved to Portland. We stayed friends and when Ryan returned to Boise in the spring of 2012, we started dating. Fall of 2013 we got married and here we are seven years and three beautiful girls later! We still live in the Treasure Valley and have a very special place in our hearts for Boise State!\n\n“We met during both of our freshman year at Boise State! We had Math 108 in the first semester of freshman year and we were placed in the same group together in class. We would see each other throughout COBE over the years. During our junior year, we were both on the Dance Marathon team at Boise State! We volunteered long hours together to plan the Dance Marathon event to benefit St. Luke’s Children’s Hospital! In our senior year of college, we were both elected to leadership positions in the Dance Marathon organization where we spent a lot more time together. Our friendship grew strong over our four years at Boise State University and we did not start dating until after we both graduated in May 2019. We both found jobs in Boise after graduation and started living our adult lives! Fast forward to October 2020, we got ENGAGED! Our wedding is set for June 2021 in Washington. We are so excited!”\n\n“My husband, Dan Jefferson, and I met our sophomore year of college in the fall of 2011. We were in the same step aerobics class that was nearly all female except for two males. You may be thinking the only reason those guys took that class was to meet girls, and you wouldn’t be wrong. I noticed Dan immediately, not because he was one of the two guys, but because of his awesome knee brace tan lines! Seriously, ask my best friend Lauren how many times I pointed out his tan lines to her. Anyways, it took me a couple of weeks to work up the courage to speak to him. Was I starstruck? Maybe. One day I was running late, as per my usual. That day, our workout ended up being on the greenbelt instead of the kinesiology building. I didn’t have a bag or anything to put my stuff in, and I had my hands full. When I caught up to the class, Dan was standing in the back of the group with a nice looking backpack that definitely had the potential to house my things for the class period. Without thinking twice, and knowing this was my moment to finally talk to him, I walked right up and asked if I could put my stuff on his backpack instead of in the dirt/rocks under the Park Center bridge. I’ll never forget that first smile he gave me and that little chuckle as he looked at all the stuff in my hands. We talked and joked for the remainder of class and walked back to the kines gym together after the work out. After class we went our separate ways, but I wanted to keep talking to him. I didn’t catch his last name, and of course, his first name is pretty popular, making it hard to find him on Facebook. I tracked him down eventually, maybe I used our class email roster, maybe I didn’t… okay I did but I’d say it worked out nicely for us considering our wedding was this past summer! Now, Dan’s version is a little different. He swears up and down that he picked me out on the first day of class (yeah right), but either way, we have loved and laughed together ever since that fateful day, ten years ago.”\n\n“Phil and I met during the spring semester of 2020 in a communications class. We sat next to each other the first day and hit it off as friends! Then, March 2020 rolled around, forcing us to go our separate ways, me back to Nampa, and him back to San Diego. I didn’t think too much of it as we were just friends at the time, but he reached back out to me later that year inviting me to his discord server he created for all his friends to stay connected during lockdown. I joined, and we were both on just about every day playing video games together. We eventually both shared our feelings for each other and started off long distance, until the fall semester of 2021, when we finally got to be together in person. In celebrating his contributions to the Blue Thunder Marching Band, I became a huge fan and known to the marching band as ‘that girl with the sign’. We’ve been together coming up on 3 years now and I couldn’t be more thankful for that communications class.”\n\n“Jacob and I met at Boise State in 2001!\n\nWe were both earning degrees in Bilingual Education, so we had almost every undergraduate class together from 2001 until our graduation in 2002 when we went on to teach with different school districts.\n\nWe rekindled our friendship, then started dating in early 2003 and together returned to Boise State in Fall of 2003 to work on a Master of Arts in Education, finishing in 2005.\n\nWe married in November of 2006, during the first semester of our Master of Education program in Educational Leadership, at, where else—Boise State! After graduation in 2008 (and having two daughters in the two years of school), we enjoyed life with children at a slower pace, attending many BSU games and functions.\n\nJacob returned to Boise State for one final time a few years later, earning a Doctor of Education degree from Boise State in 2015, affectionally known to his four daughters as “Doctor Daddy.”\n\nAfter spending a combined 17 years in classes, 2 undergraduate degrees and 5 graduate degrees, it’s safe to say Boise State will forever hold a special place in our hearts.\n\nWe now live out of state, raising one son and four daughters, Jacob, a professor of Educational Leadership and Policy Studies at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and I as a Project Facilitator for our school district. We venture to Boise a few times per year and make the drive over to the University to see the changes, take pictures and reminisce with our children. Thanks for the memories!”\n\n“Bryan and I met when his fraternity and my sorority were celebrating his birthday in 2012 on Halloween night. Throughout the years we grew from acquaintances within our groups of friends, to coworkers working in the Student Involvement and Leadership Center, Bryan as ASBSU President, to great friends creating memories at Boise State including a Fiesta Bowl trip, Dance Marathon and Relay for Life.\n\nAfter college, we continued to stay in touch after Bryan moved for work. We planned visits between Seattle and Boise, and even an international trip to Europe. Three days before we left for Europe, I moved to Seattle, making long-distance a thing of the past.\n\nFour years later in January of 2022 on a ‘girls trip’ to Boise. Bryan surprised me and brought our family and friends to Boise State and proposed in front of the ‘B’, where it all started just over nine years ago.”\n\n“In 2018, at the Alumni and Friends Center, Garrett and I both had work study together. We worked at separate desks, on the same floor, as we worked alongside other work-study students and alumni employees. Garrett and I would casually talk and work together during Bronco bashes and then one day in November sometime after his birthday we started talking more and made plans to hang out outside of work-study. Garrett picked me up from the townhomes on campus and we went ice skating together. Since this was our ” first date” we split the cost of ice skating and ice skates. The night continued with spending more time laughing and getting to know each other over a couple of drinks at some local bars on Broadway. After that, we continued to build our friendship and during Christmas break, we kept in contact. After 2 weeks or so on Christmas Break, we both came back unplanned a few days before the new Semester began Garrett picked me up from the airport and we spent the rest of the day and evening together, watching movies until early the next morning. We continued building our bond by hanging out together, texting, and seeing each other at work study. We began sitting next to each other at the Alumni and Friends Center, which brought us closer. Eventually made plans one weekend to hang out with his friends and go to Downtown Boise and bar hop and dance. Toward the end of the night, we both were dancing together and kissed. We held hands downtown the rest of the night. About 2.5 months after Christmas, we became official on Feb. 16, 2019.”"
