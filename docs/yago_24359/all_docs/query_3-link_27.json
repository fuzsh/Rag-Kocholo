        "text": "Are you looking for just the right words to express how you feel? Perhaps a simple “I love you” doesn’t carry enough weight and you need to dress it up a little. Fear not! Help is on the way! Browse lists of romantic words to describe someone you love, along with a few phrases that just might spark the proverbial fires.\n\nDo you see any spelling bees in your students' future? How about THE spelling bee, Scripps National Spelling Bee? It’s the nation’s oldest and most iconic competition. In 2004, world-class spellers were given a treat. Scripps released a consolidated word list encompassing almost every word from prior spelling bees. That’s an excess of 23,000 words!\n\nOne of the best ways to prepare your spellers is to start small with weekly classroom spelling bees. Then, in time, they can advance onto regional and even national spelling bees. This type of skill will foster a strong sense of self-confidence in students and will spark a lifelong love for reading and writing."
