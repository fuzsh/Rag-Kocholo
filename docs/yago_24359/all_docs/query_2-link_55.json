Commercial enterprises are not eligible for fee waivers, but school groups using a commercial vehicle for transportation only may apply for a fee waiver. Entrance fee waivers are available for groups of children under 16 years of age with a reasonable number of chaperones, drivers, and teachers, as well as for hospital in-patients involved in medical treatment or therapy.\n\nPlease fill out the application online, save it as a PDF, and email it in to the Fee Waiver Coordinator.\n\nFee Waiver Application\n\nAcademic Fee/Entrance Fee Waiver Application Guidelines\n\nAcademic Fee Waivers (formally Educational Fee Waivers) and Entrance Fee Waivers are not granted automatically. Applicant groups must submit an application and meet specific criteria for approval of their request.\n\nEligibility: Proof of school or academic institution standing–submit one of the following types of documentation:\n\nA statement confirming educational or scientific tax exemption from the IRS or the applicant’s national, state, or local tax authority; or\n\nA statement, from a bona fide academic institution meeting one of these eligibility standards, confirming that the group is visiting for the purpose of providing transferable academic credit based on a curriculum; or\n\nA statement of accreditation or recognition as an educational institution from a legitimate international, national, regional, state, or local authority for the applicant’s location.\n\nEducational Purpose of the Visit:\n\nApplicants must provide a written statement (documentation) verifying that the visit supports a specific curriculum for which academic credit is offered. Documentation such as the course syllabus or a copy of the school’s course catalog or handbook will satisfy this requirement.\n\nRelevance of Park Resources or Facilities:\n\nTo simply state the trip objectives are for “educational purposes” is insufficient. There must be a direct relationship between the purpose of the visit and the use of the park. Applicants must provide a written statement identifying the park resources and/or facilities that will be used to support the educational purpose of the visit, and how they are relevant to that purpose. A course outline, lesson plan, or copy of the course curriculum meets this requirement.\n\nEligibility:\n\nGroups of children under 16 years of age with a reasonable number of chaperones, drivers, and teachers will be admitted free.\n\nHospital in-patients involved in medical treatment or therapy will be admitted free.\n\nSubmission of Applications:\n\nAll applications for fee waivers must be received by the Fee Management, Special Park Uses Office at least three weeks in advance of the anticipated visit.\n\nApplicants that are incomplete (no documents provided) or do not meet required criteria may be denied.\n\nPlease email applications and all required documentation to: Email: e-mail us\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nEntrance station personnel are not authorized to grant fee waivers at time of arrival. Documented non-profit groups without an approved fee waiver will be charged as non-commercial groups rate based upon the National Park Service Non-Commercial Group Fee Schedule.\n\nService, civic, and fraternal organizations e.g. Scouting, Rotary, Elks, etc. do NOT qualify for an Academic/Entrance Fee Waiver, unless they meet the qualification standards listed above.\n\nPursuant to the FLREA, academic fee waivers are granted only for entrance fees and do not apply to Expanded Amenity or camping fees. Group camping reservations may be made for St. Mary and Apgar Campgrounds at www.recreation.gov, all other campgrounds that provide group camping operate on a first come first served basis.\n\nVehicles, and vehicle combinations, longer than 21 feet (including bumpers) or wider than 8 feet (including mirrors), are prohibited between Avalanche Campground on the west side of the park and the Sun Point parking area on the east side. Vehicles over 10 feet in height may have difficulty driving west from Logan Pass, due to rock over-hangs.\n\nOther Fees\n\nCamping fees vary with the seasons and the campground. There are special rates for Hiker/Biker campsites.\n\nRanger-guided activities are FREE of charge, with the exception of ranger-guided hikes that include a boat trip and some of the Native America Speaks programs.\n\nExplore the Guided Trips section to find rates associated with activities offered by park concessions.\n\nGlacier has a free Going-to-the-Sun Road shuttle, but there are other fee-based ways to travel the park.
