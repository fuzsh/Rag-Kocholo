        "text": "Erica Kane\n\nThe smart money is on Susan Lucci’s iconic All My Children character being Martin’s third ex — especially given the fact that the former supermodel’s Enchantment Enterprises would be a natural corporate rival for Deception. But would anyone really describe La Kane as sadistic? Mercurial maybe, but sadistic?\n\nOpal Cortlandt\n\nImagine the hilarity that would ensue if it turned out that Marty’s sugar mama was the actual mother of Michael E. Knight’s All My Children character, Tad Martin. Palmer’s widow could have become embittered after being dumped by her boy toy and sought to keep him from ever remarrying.\n\nLiza Colby\n\nAs much fun as it would be to see Knight reunited with his All My Children sparring partner Marcy Walker, she’s given up acting. (Read what the much-missed Daytime Emmy winner been up to here.) Besides, by the time Jamie Luner was given the role, Liza had changed to the point that we hardly recognized her.\n\nCara Castillo\n\nWe remember Lindsay Hartley’s All My Children doctor as being far lovelier than the she-devil that Marty so fears. But we also remember that she had great chemistry with Knight — and we’d love to have Kelly Monaco’s substitute Sam on General Hospital in a role to call her own.\n\nDorian Lord\n\nIf General Hospital is open to doing crossovers — and Walt Willey’s appearance as Jackson Montgomery suggests that it is — why limit them to All My Children? Marty could just as easily as have been hitched to Llanview’s onetime queen of mean as a Pine Valley villainess.\n\nGreenlee Smythe\n\nThis one’s a stretch, we’ll grant you. But Jack’s daughter does have money and a cosmetics company — remember Fusion? And General Hospital could handle the fact that Rebecca Budig also plays Hayden the way it has the fact that Cameron Mathison (Drew) used to be Ryan: by ignoring it!\n\nEllen Burgess\n\nAll My Children legend Debbi Morgan’s Port Charles M.D. was no harpy. But being married to a natural born conniver like Marty could probably turn the nicest of people nasty. And her medical background could be exactly what gave her the insight to create the Deceptor that’s become the hottest topic in town.\n\nArlene Vaughan\n\nThere was no low to which Hayley’s All My Children momster wouldn’t stoop. And if she was able to cash in on her short-lived marriage to Adam Chandler, she’d have the moolah to keep Marty in the style to which he’s become accustomed. But, as greedy as she was, would she really spare him a dime?\n\nKrystle Carey\n\nThe former wife of All My Children millionaire Adam, as well as Tad, Bobbie Eakes’ character probably has a bank account that’s fat enough to make payments to Marty. And we could certainly see her with him. But being as vicious as he says she is? That, we can’t quite picture.\n\nA Familiar Face\n\nNo way, no how could sweet-as-pie All My Children heroine Dixie Martin ever be the viper that Marty has so colorfully described. Nonetheless, it would be a delight and a half if the louse’s former spouse turned out to be someone played by Knight’s longtime leading lady, Cady McClain."
