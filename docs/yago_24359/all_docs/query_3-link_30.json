        "text": "Wednesday, January 6, 2010 3:40 PM ET | By Angela Rosa\n\n(SoapOperaNetwork.com) — “All My Children” brings Julia Barr, or as she’s known in Pine Valley: Brooke English, back in 2010 – for more than a day!\n\nSoap Opera Digest and SOAPnet are reporting that the extraordinary Julia Barr will return to “All My Children” for what is promised to be “a great story arc” beginning on Tuesday, February 23. Hallelujah! The missed actress just appeared on “AMC’s” 40th Anniversary episode on January 5th.\n\nBarr played the very popular character of Brooke English on “AMC” from 1976 to 2006. In 2006, several “AMC” actors, including Barr, were told they were being dropped to recurring status. The eight-time Emmy nominee, and two-time winner, did not appreciate the status change and opted to give the show notice that she was departing. The soap opted to not give Brooke a proper exit, the character simply disappeared one day. Brooke’s rivalry with Erica Kane (Susan Lucci) is one of soapdom’s most legendary. The character, a magazine editor, has also enjoyed popular romances with Adam Chandler (David Canary) and the now deceased Edmund Grey (John Callahan), and less memorable romances with Tad Martin (Michael E. Knight) and Jackson Montgomery (Walt Willey). Brooke shares a son with Tad, Jamie. Barr has been part of many memorable stories on “AMC,” but none more memorable than the death of Ms. English’s daughter, Laura Cudahy, due to a drunk driver.\n\n“AMC” currently does not have an official Head Writer. Following the pre-holiday firing of the very unpopular Charles Pratt, Jr., former “AMC” head scribe, and multiple-time Emmy-winner, Lorraine Broderick was rumored to be filling the seat – but ABC has since announced that Broderick is currently just one of the shows Associate Head Writer’s. Pratt’s work will air through January, with February-on promising to be at least a fraction more encouraging. Coinciding with the firing of Pratt, the ABC soap has obviously been trying to regain goodwill with a frustrated audience. The soap went out of their way to give one of the soaps most tortured and popular pairings, Zach and Kendall (Thorsten Kaye and Alicia Minshew), a happy ending upon the actors exit (Minshew is on an extended leave; Kaye opted out of his contract); the soap has also recently put the popular Jill Larson, who plays quirky Opal Cortlandt, back on contract; popular Erica husband Jackson Montgomery, played by Walt Willey, is expected to be appearing a lot more in 2010; and now of course the announcement of Julia Barr’s return stint.\n\nRumors are abundant that David Canary, who plays Adam Chandler, is planning to exit the soap in the spring of 2010 due to “AMC’s” production move from New York to Los Angeles. These rumors leave us suspecting that Brooke’s return may lead her to the Chandler Mansion where the love of her life (and we believe the feeling is mutual) resides with Pine Valley’s pariah, Annie (Melissa Claire Egan), as his current wife.\n\nUpdate (1/8/10): Barr’s return stint will last for approximately three months, according to the latest reports from SOD.\n\n“All My Children” airs Weekdays on ABC. Weeknights on SOAPnet. Check local listings. “AMC” now also airs online at ABC.com and SOAPnet.com which can be accessed 24/7."
