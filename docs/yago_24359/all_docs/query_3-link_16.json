        "text": "Lets’ finish up the 70’s…\n\n<strong>1977</strong>\n\nNothing seemed to go right for Phoebe Tyler. Her husband Charles still wanted a divorce. Her grandson Chuck and his wife Tara were already divorced. And Phoebe couldn’t bear to think of her great-grandson being taken from Chuck. But at least she had both Chuck and Little Phillip staying at home with her, while Tara honeymooned with her new husband Phil Brent. After consoling herself with too many sips of sherry one afternoon, she went driving with Little Phillip and instantly swerved into an accident.\n\nPhoebe wasn’t hurt, but Little Phillip’s brief hospital stay caused Phil and Tara to cut their honeymoon short. Chuck wondered if he could ever trust his grandmother with his son again and was glad when the police revoked her license.\n\nRefusing to attend Linc and Kitty’s inevitable wedding, Phoebe nursed her misery with a bottle of vodka. After the wedding, a drunken Phoebe finally revealed her scheme to use Myrtle to break up Linc and Kitty. Drunkenly revealing the scheme to both Kitty and Linc, Phoebe conveniently forgot to mention who’d created it. But Mona later told them about Phoebe’s part in it and that Myrtle truly loved Kitty like a daughter and had only faked her death to end the charade. Linc angrily confronted Phoebe, who swore she’d never meddle again. But Linc couldn’t forgive her.\n\nKitty began having dizzy spells and bouts of temporary blindness. Psychosomatic, the doctors said, finding nothing wrong.\n\nWith one father too many in his life, Little Phillip Tyler was anything but happy. He told his mother Tara that he wanted to live with his father Chuck, instead of with her and his new stepfather Phil Brent. When he didn’t get his way, Little Phillip blamed Phil. And things got worse when Phil found him playing with the revolver he carried as a cop and tried to spank him.\n\n“You can’t spank me!” the boy screamed, “Only my father can do that! You’re not my father!” Phil bit his lip to keep himself from telling him that he was.\n\nWhen Tara became pregnant, she asked Phil to quit his dangerous job, but he refused. Then, one afternoon, the call that Tara was dreading came. Phil had been shot.\n\nTara rushed to the hospital. In critical condition, Phil told Tara how much he loved her and their family. When Chuck paid him a visit, Phil asked him to remarry Tara in case he didn’t make it. Fortunately, Phil survived and Chuck was no longer interested in Tara anyway. Donna Beck filled his thoughts.\n\nErica redirected her amorous attention to an old conquest – husband #1, Dr. Jeff Martin – but he wasn’t interested. Upon meeting Mark Dalton, a new music teacher at Pine Valley University, Erica forgot all about Jeff. Mark and Erica were instantly drawn to each other, and neither could explain why! But Jeff was drawn to a colleague, Dr. Christina Karras, who was receiving mysterious, hateful, threatening notes. Jeff wanted to help Christina, but her knight-in-shining-armor was Dr. David Thornton. David discovered that Christina was tormenting herself! She wrote the death threats while in a trance! Learning that her psychosis began with her belief that she’d killed her own father, David cured her by finding proof of her innocence.\n\nHer conscience and mind at ease, Christina and David would have instantly married. But David’s ex-wife Edna came to town with the explosive news that they were, in fact, still legally married and that they had a 7-year-old daughter, Dottie!\n\nAnn and Paul Martin were horrified when their daughter, Beth, died in her sleep from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Paul tried to comfort Ann, who suffered a total breakdown. All Paul could do was sign the papers committing her to Oak Haven.\n\nDr. Joe Martin had finally diagnosed Kitty’s attacks of blindness and dizziness as an inoperable brain tumor. Kitty died in Linc’s arms.\n\nShortly after Kitty’s death, Linc said good-bye to Myrtle. A distinguished beau, Nigel Fargate, had asked her to marry him and move back to Minneapolis. Before she left, Myrtle sold The Boutique, which Ann had given to Kitty, to someone she felt both Ann and Kitty would have liked – Ellen Shepherd.\n\nRecently divorced, Ellen had moved to Pine Valley with her daughter Devon. She arranged for Devon to take piano lessons from Mark Dalton, who taught at the University which Devon was about to enter.\n\nMark was very interested in Erica Kane and had no idea she’d also been seeing her boss at The Chateau, Nick Davis. Nick was jealous of Mark, which pleased Erica. She liked Mark, but not enough to go to bed with him. Not yet anyway, she told her mother Mona who became frantic to break them up - because she knew the horrible truth that Erica and Mark were half-brother and sister. On the rebound, Mark fell in love with Ellen. But Ellen was worried. What would people think? Mark was ten years younger than she was.\n\nBrooke lost interest in Dan Kennicott, and took a fancy to former football hero Tom Cudahy. But so did Erica Kane. Erica wheedled her way into the hostess job at The Goalpost, the new restaurant that Tom had just opened. Still, Erica had a “thing” for Nick. She decided that she wanted to marry Nick and she lured him back to her bed. When her mother Mona walked in on them, she almost had a heart attack! Realizing Erica’s deceptions, Nick left Erica - once and for all. Erica set her sights on Tom.\n\nAlthough Donna Beck enjoyed spoiling Chuck’ son, her insecurities drove her to leave Pine Valley. Back on Locust Street, Donna refused to turn tricks for pimp Billy Clyde Tuggle. He plied her with mind-altering drugs to change her mind. But Donna’s friend, Estelle let Chuck know where Donna was, and he saved her – then married her.\n\nChuck and Donna moved into a small apartment. Hearing that Little Phillip was with them caused Tara to have a setback. Phil held his wife’s hand lovingly, but dropped it when she opened her eyes and, in her delirium, called him, “Chuck.” Angry, Phil wanted Chuck out of his wife’s thoughts and Chuck’s little hooker out of his son’s life. Little Phillip moved back with Tara and Phil.\n\nDonna felt bad that Chuck had lost his son. But Chuck reassured her, and it wasn’t long before Donna became pregnant. Or so she thought. Though she had all the symptoms, Dr. Clader told Chuck that Donna was experiencing a “hysterical pregnancy.”\n\nPhoebe, having alienated most of her family, began drinking and driving again! Later, she tumbled down the stairs at the Tyler mansion. The fall left her paralyzed, or so she said. Since institutionalizing his wife, Ann, Paul had buried himself in work. He handled Frank Grant’s divorce from Nancy. Still in love with Frank, she moved back to Pine Valley, and although they shared a night of passion, Frank went ahead with the divorce. Nancy learned she was pregnant with Frank’s child the day he married Caroline and unhappily considered marrying Carl Blair.\n\nRuth and Joe moved to finalize their adoption of Tad Gardner. The good news was that Tad’s father, Ray Gardner, had finally been located. Joe flew out to Texarkana where Ray told him that he wanted $10,000. Joe refused to give in to extortion from this clearly dangerous individual. Ray booked the next bus and headed for Pine Valley.\n\n<strong> 1978</strong>\n\nTad Martin panicked when his father, Ray Gardner, showed up at his door. To young Tad, this man seemed more like a demon than his father. Ray enjoyed his little terror trip, then left town, but not before Ruth furiously confronted him, and read him the riot act.\n\nWhen Ruth refused to give in to his extortion attempts, Ray saw that she meant business. So did he, Ray began watching and waiting, and one evening, when Ruth crossed a deserted parking lot and unlocked her car, Ray sprung out at her. He had robbed, assaulted, raped her and knocked her out by the time her husband Joe got there. Joe stopped him from killing her. But Ray escaped.\n\nRuth lay in a coma for days before she awoke to the memory of the horror of the rape. One of Billy Clyde’s hookers, Estelle La Tour, recognized Ray and called a cop, Phil Brent. When Phil showed up, Ray knocked him out and tried to escape. But Billy Clyde pulled a knife on Ray, and in stabbing him, captured him. Estelle was surprised to see the man who prostituted and beat her could be such a hero. Caught between her love for Benny Sago and Billy Clyde, Estelle married the wrong man - Billy Clyde.\n\nPhoebe continued to fake her paralysis, which not only kept her out of jail on her drunk driving conviction, but brought her some long overdue attention and consideration from her husband Charles. Phoebe wondered why she hadn’t taken to a wheelchair years ago.\n\nWheeling about her estate, Phoebe rolled into the pool house to find her niece Brooke English and Dan Kennicott alone and naked. And doing what Phoebe knew nice girls never did. She ordered Brooke to go home to her parents. But before Phoebe could ship Brooke out, Brooke saw her padding around the mansion on her own two feet.\n\nAnd Brooke blackmailed dear Aunt Phoebe into an open-ended invitation to stay. Brooke had taken up with Dan Kennicott again upon realizing that Tom Cudahy was more interested in Erica Kane. Also, Dan had been dating that insipid Devon Shepherd, and Brooke couldn’t bear losing him to her. Ellen decided that she’d be better off with a man her own age - Paul Martin. But with his wife Ann still institutionalized, Paul wasn’t free to be anything more to Ellen than a friend.\n\nWhen Ray Gardner was convicted of rape, Ruth and Joe at long last could legally adopt Tad, who was excited when his name became Tad Martin! Ruth and Joe’s grandson, Little Phillip Tyler, also changed his name. He asked his teachers and friends to stop calling him “Phillip” and start calling him “Charlie” after his father, Chuck Tyler.\n\nDr. Chuck Tyler had marital troubles. He had to tell his happily expectant wife Donna that her pregnancy was only a figment of her imagination. And as she went into therapy, she remembered when her former pimp Tyrone had her tubes tied and realized what it meant! Her old feelings of worthlessness reappeared, and she left Chuck for his own good. Chuck, convinced that Donna would never return, talked more and more with Tara about their son. They became close again.\n\nTara’s brother, Dr. Jeff Martin, felt no guilt pursuing Dr. Christina Karras despite her engagement to Dr. David Thornton. David, married to the clinging Edna, realized that Christina was responding to Jeff. He had to do something. He decided to kill Edna. In increasingly bigger doses, he slipped digitalis he’d stolen from the hospital in Edna’s food til she, in a debilitated state, went to Dr. Jeff Martin. Jeff diagnosed heart trouble just as Christina returned her engagement ring to David.\n\nDavid Thornton plotted to poison his wife, Edna, with a drug that would make it appear that she suffered a fatal heart attack. Spiking her glass with a lethal dose of the drug, David went to escort Edna to her demise. Before they returned, their daughter Dottie innocently switched the two glasses on the table – and David dropped dead. The widowed Edna began a hot pursuit of Benny Sago, who was still pining for Estelle, Mrs. Billy Clyde Tuggle. Jeff married Dr. Christina Karras, but their marriage was troubled from the start. The following year, they moved to San Francisco.\n\nErica Kane was already going after a third husband, Nick Davis. While working for Tom Cudahy at The Goalpost, Erica plotted to make Nick realize how much he loved her. In New York City, Erica contracted viral pneumonia and was given a 50-50 chance of survival. Mona told Nick that only he could give Erica the will to live. He had to ask her to marry him. Against his better judgement, Nick proposed.\n\nUpon her recovery, Nick reconsidered his proposal to Erica. When he walked out on her that last time, she vowed revenge! But she wanted love…and a man she could count on. Tom Cudahy was that man. She quickly decided to do or say whatever she had to, to make him fall for her. First, she reclaimed her job as hostess at his restaurant, ousting Brooke English with relish.\n\nDevon Shepherd seduced the equally virginal Wally McFadden and became pregnant. A loving Wally asked her to marry him. But she didn’t love him. Mark Dalton finally persuaded Ellen to accept his engagement ring. But with Devon pregnant, Ellen found herself pulling away from Mark and confiding more and more in Paul Martin.\n\nMona Kane sat silently as Erica married Tom. After a joyous reception at the Pine Valley Country Club, the bride and groom flew off to a St. Croix honeymoon. And Mona looked at Charles Tyler for love and support. She hoped that her daughter would be happy, but in her heart, she knew that Erica still loved Nick. But Nick Davis was gone. He sold The Chateau and moved to Chicago.\n\nKitty’s twin sister, Kelly Cole, an up-and-coming nightclub singer came to Pine Valley. Linc was dumbfounded by her resemblance to Kitty. As Myrtle moved back to Pine Valley, Kelly’s manager and lover Eddie Dorrance booked her into a singing engagement at The Chateau. Phoebe offered Eddie Dorrance $50,000 to marry Kelly and take her away from Pine Valley. “Easy money,” thought Eddie. He’d already made Kelly dependent on him by supplying her with all the uppers and downers she needed to keep up with the hectic pace of her career. Kelly was a junkie. Eddie controlled Kelly. And when he proposed, Kelly said, “Yes.”\n\nPhil and Tara’s marriage turned sour when Phil began having more and more friction with Charlie. Finally, Phil moved out of his and Tara’s home. Tara turned to her ex-husband Chuck to discuss Charlie’s problems. And then, suddenly they weren’t discussing Charlie at all. They were making love! They were in love…and feeling very guilty.\n\nChuck’s insecure wife Donna discovered proof of Chuck’s infidelity. She was confiding her problems to her friend Estelle when the car they were in stalled on the railroad tracks! The train couldn’t stop in time! The car was totaled! The impact left Donna with partial amnesia, hurling her backward in time three years to her hooking days.\n\nPhil tried to win Tara back, but he suspected that she and Chuck were having an affair. Chuck learned that Donna, who’d forgotten she was his wife, was pregnant, the operation to reverse her sterility had worked! Donna’s pregnancy prompted Tara to call a halt to her relationship with Chuck. But her amnesia sparked a meeting between Chuck’s grandmother Phoebe Tyler, and Billy Clyde Tuggle. Billy Clyde offered to lure Donna back to her life as a hooker if Phoebe would pay for his trouble. But Billy Clyde’s wife Estelle discovered their plot and left him, taking Donna with her to Chuck, who had no choice but to take them in.\n\nErica again blabbed a shocking secret when she told Phoebe that Charlie wasn’t her great-grandson because he was really Phil Brent’s son and not Chuck’s! As Phoebe nursed her latest hangover, Ruth and Joe Martin felt a mounting fear. The evil Ray Gardner, the man who had raped Ruth, had escaped from prison!\n\n<strong> 1979</strong>\n\nReturning to Pine Valley for revenge, escaped convict Ray Gardner wanted to make Ruth and Joe Martin pay for sending him to prison. Ray took Chuck, Donna and Edna hostage, and the trauma brought Donna’s memory back. Phil captured Ray and sent him back to prison. In the hostage crisis, Chuck was shot and developed a fever that left him disoriented. By his bedside, Donna was shattered when Chuck spoke to her.\n\n“Tara,” he said. How could Chuck think she was his first wife. “Tara, I love you. My marriage to Donna was a mistake!”\n\nDonna stifled all her pain and, forcing herself to believe that Chuck would never leave her or the baby they were expecting, she decided to persevere. And Tara made it easy for her.\n\nWhen her husband Phil risked his life to save Chuck, Tara realized that she truly loved Phil after all, and not Chuck. She went to Phil, and the two of them renewed their marriage vows in a touching ceremony with their son Charlie by their side. Phil got a new job with the Federal Narcotics Bureau, and he, Tara, and their son Charlie moved to Washington, D.C.\n\nRuth Martin became pregnant and her family tried to calm her fears about having a healthy baby at her advanced age.\n\nDonna happily awaited the birth of her own child, the symbol of Chuck’s love for her and their future together. But the baby was born dead. Chuck and Donna held each other in pain as the reality of the stillbirth clouded their future.\n\nWhile Chuck and Donna grieved over their loss, Erica and Tom Cudahy were trying very hard to conceive a baby. Or so Erica let Tom believe. She didn’t tell him she was taking birth control pills.\n\nEllen’s own insecurities about her age difference with Mark increased when her daughter Devon gave birth to Wally’s baby. Mark would be marrying a grandmother! While Devon agonized about whether or not to marry Wally or give up her new daughter Bonnie, Ellen turned more and more to Paul Martin for advice and friendship. And by the time Devon reluctantly married Wally and settled into an unhappy marriage, Ellen and Paul had begun to care for each other. And Phoebe Tyler didn’t care for that at all. She brightened when Ann started to make vague progress at Oak Haven, and her doctors advised Paul to postpone divorcing her.\n\nIf Phoebe was unhappy about Paul’s interest in Ellen, Ellen’s ex-fiancee Mark was miserable. Getting drunk one night, he ran into Phoebe’s niece Brooke English, who liked Mark and easily seduced him. Brooke forged a relationship with Mark, who made it clear that all they had together was sex. Mark still wanted to marry Ellen. Knowing this, Brooke still moved in with him. Brooke’s boyfriend Dan Kennicott got the message. Heart broken, he left town. Brooke, realizing that Mark loved Ellen, began a reckless affair with Eddie Dorrance who became obsessed with her.\n\nBrooke’s other old boyfriend Benny Sago, hopelessly in love with Estelle, kept trying to woo her away from her husband Billy Clyde Tuggle. And though she truly loved Benny, Billy Clyde always seemed to win her back! Edna Thornton had the hots for Benny, but his constant pursuit of Estelle left her alone at The Chateau’s bar too often. Eddie Dorrance manipulated himself into Claudette Montgomery’s position as manager of the restaurant and introduced Edna to Professor Langley Wallingford. But when Langley began pursuing Phoebe, Edna married Benny Sago. Phoebe was so flattered by Professor Wallingford’s attention, she finally gave her husband Charles his long-sought divorce.\n\nPhoebe’s plan to pay Eddie to marry Kelly Cole, the singer whose career he managed, fell apart when Kelly found out about it on the morning of the wedding. Kelly called off the wedding and Phoebe’s heart sank as she watched Kelly and her son Linc fall in love. But Kelly never wanted Linc to know about her drug addiction. Soon after, Eddie Dorrance was killed, and Kelly was charged with his murder.\n\nMyrtle had the oddest sensation that she knew Professor Wallingford. But she couldn’t think where. Langley recognized her, too, and hoped she’d never recall that he’d once snatched her purse at a carnival in Topeka, Kansas where she knew him as roustabout Lenny Wlasuk.p> Phoebe was oblivious to Langley’s scam as she busied herself with plans to welcome her new neighbors, the wealthy and aristocratic Palmer Cortlandt and his innocent daughter Nina, to Pine Valley society. On the night of Phoebe’s dinner party, Nina had an attack of appendicitis and was rushed to the hospital where young Dr. Cliff Warner operated and saved her life. From the minute Nina and Cliff looked into each other’s eyes, it was love at first sight.\n\nPalmer saw what was happening between Cliff and Nina, and so did nurse Sybil Thorne. Neither liked what they saw. Palmer wanted his daughter for himself. And Sybil wanted Cliff. They entered into an unholy alliance to break the young lovers up. Sybil told Palmer about Cliff’s old girlfriend Janice Rawlins.\n\nPalmer bribed Janice to lie to Nina, saying that Cliff had walked out on her when she was pregnant. Hearing this, Nina turned cold as ice to Cliff, who was angry and confused. A depressed Nina, who was diabetic, neglected her health which alarmed Palmer’s mysterious housekeeper, Mrs. Myra Murdoch. Realizing that Palmer had orchestrated the situation, she ordered him to fix it…fast.\n\nPalmer caved in to her demand, shuddering at the thought of Nina again enthralled by the insipid sound of Cliff Warner’s voice reading poetry to her. He began plotting how he could temporarily fix the damage he’d done.\n\nA more compassionate father, Joe Martin, welcomed his daughter home when Tara brought her son Charlie back to Pine Valley while she waited to hear from her husband, Phil. He had disappeared while on an undercover assignment out of the country. Tara’s return made an already insecure Donna very jealous. And though Donna’s husband Chuck hadn’t thought about Tara for months, Donna was driving him crazy with her jealousy.\n\nErica was driving her husband Tom crazy with her endless quest for fame. Erica popped birth control pills and, without telling Tom, opened a disco which she proudly named “Erica’s.” Tom was flabbergasted that she could actually open a disco behind his back! Tom hired Brooke to take Erica’s place at the Goalpost. Upon learning that she was carrying the late Eddie Dorrance’s baby, Brooke made a tough decision. She chose to have an abortion secretly.\n\nErica’s biggest secret blew up in her face when Tom came across her birth control pills and, waving them in her face, blasted her once and for all! Tom wanted what Joe and Ruth Martin welcomed into their lives that peaceful Christmas morning – a healthy baby boy. Joey.\n\nHope ya’ll enjoyed a trip down the memory lanes of the seventies…be on the look out for the 80’s…bless each and everyone of you…blessings & prayers, Pj"
