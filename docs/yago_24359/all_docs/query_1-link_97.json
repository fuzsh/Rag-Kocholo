        "text": "THE LANGFORD BROOKE FAMILY OF MERE\n\nThis family and its estate were studied as part of an adult education class run by the Department of Continuing Education at Keele University called Fine Arts and Society in the Late Georgian Country House. The family muniments are deposited at the John Rylands Library in Manchester.\n\nThe Brooke, later Langford Brooke family lived at Mere from the middle of the 17th century until the early 1990s. The last male heir, Colonel Ronald Langford-Brooke, died in 1980 and his wife in 1993. There was a sale of the Old Hall and contents in May 1994. Peter de Figueiredo and Julian Treuhertz in Cheshire Country Houses, describe Mere Old Hall as a late 17th century house remodelled in 1809-1815 and subsequently truncated in 1836. When Mere New Hall was built the old house was let to Manchester merchants and manufacturers during the 19th century. The New Hall was built about 1834 to the design of Thomas Johnson of Lichfield in a red brick Elizabethan style. The main block was destroyed in a fire in 1975 and the building is now the Mere Golf and Country Club (Grid Ref. SJ 727816)\n\nBy comparison with the research on the Leicesters at Tabley House and the Egertons at Tatton, relatively little has been undertaken on the Brooke family and there are very few published articles. The two most recent accounts do not reveal their sources of information. They are an item in Country Life, (Vol. CLXXXIV, No. 20, 17 May 1990 on p. 204) and the sale catalogue produced by Christie’s in 1994. A short article in the series Cheshire Families and their Seats (Advertiser Notes and Queries, 1 1882, p. 168-9) is based on Burke's History of the Commoners. There is an article on the family in Burke's Landed Gentry of 1879. Ormerod (The History of the County Palatine and City of Chester, three volumes, London, 1819) quotes family trees drawn up by Sir Francis Leicester (1674-1742). The following three paragraphs, with small additions, are taken from the Sale Catalogue of 1994, the author of which is denoted as R.C.R.\n\nThe ancient seat of the Royalist de Mere family, Mere Hall estate, was acquired for Peter Brooke, younger son of the Parliamentarian Thomas Brooke of Norton, in 1652. He was MP for Cheshire in 1657 and knighted in 1660, anad one of the last to be so honoured under the Commonwealth regime. Sir Peter was appointed High Sheriff of Cheshire in 1668 and of Lancashire in 1674 . Sir Peter proceeded to rebuild the old Hall in the Carolean style with a balustraded low pitch root and stone quoins. Dissatisfied, however, he turned his attentions to his other estate at Astley, Lancashire, leaving his heir, Thomas, to reside at Mere where the Brooke family continued to flourish. They were model landlords, and each of four succeeding generations of the family in the 18th Century married well culminating with the marriage in 1756 of Peter Brooke, to Elizabeth Langford, daughter and heiress of Jonas Langford of Theobalds, Hertfordshire, the owner of substantial estates in Antigua in the West Indies.\n\nFollowing his eldest son Jonas’s tragically early death in Milan in 1784 (whilst on the Grand Tour), Peter Brooke was succeeded by his youngest son Thomas, who added his mother's maiden name of Langford to his surname, thus starting the family name of Langford-Brooke. Thomas Langford-Brooke immediately commissioned Samuel Wyatt to rebuild the house. The plans and elevations survive but they were never executed and it was not until circa 1813 that Mere was again remodelled, almost certainly to designs of Samuel’s reworked by his nephew Lewis Wyatt. It was conceived as a classical villa and the long facade was dominated by a Pantheonic domed entrance front. Like many of their neighbours, most obviously the Egertons of Tatton, the Brooke family combined the patronage of the Wyatt family of architects with that ot the Gillows family of London and Lancaster for their furniture.\n\nThe Wyatt villa was short-lived however, the majority being destroyed by a disastrous fire shortly after the succession of Peter Langford-Brooke. He turned to the Lichfield architect Thomas Johnson to build a New Hall on another part of the estate in the romantic Old English or Elizabethan style at a cost of £15,000, into which he moved in 1837. (Peter Langford Brooke was drowned when he fell through a hole in the ice while skating on the mere on 9 January 1840 and his widow moved back to the old hall. Mere Old Hall, after repairs and modifications, was let until 1914, when William Prinsep Langford-Brooke, finding the New Hall unmanageable, returned and he proceeded to remodel the principal suite of rooms in the Adam revival style. He lived there until his death in 1927, when he was succeeded by his son Ronald.\n\nThe family tree shown below is drawn from several sources. I am grateful to Mrs. Griffiths, the daughter of the late Colonel Ronald Langford-Brooke for allowing me to consult The Genealogy of the Brooke Family of Norton Priory, Mere Hall and Astley Hall, by James Finlayson, of which only 25 copies were privately published for the family in 1869. The information has been compared with that in the second edition of Ormerod's work and Burke's Landed Gentry, 1879. The tree below shows seven generations from Sir Peter Brooke who purchased Mere, to the last heir, Thomas William Langford Brooke, who died in 1872. In addition, some dates have been added or confirmed from the Parish Registers of Rostherne, which have been examined in detail from the middle of the 17th century. These records revealed details of children who died in infancy and who had been omitted from published genealogies. The information on the branch of the family at Astley Hall near Chorley in Lancashire has been taken from the booklet, Astley Hall Museum and Art Gallery, available at the hall.\n\nThe numbers refer to the generation and children are listed in order of birth where this is known. The name was not hyphenated until the end of the 19th century. In Burke, the sons are usually listed in order first, followed by the daughters. The article in Landed Gentry 1879 has the following preamble:\n\n\"The late Thomas William Langford Brooke Esq. of Mere Hall in Cheshire, born 8 May 1843, succeeded his father in 1865 and died unmarried in 1872. The Mere Estates are now enjoyed by his mother, Catherine Mary, Mrs. Langford-Brooke and will eventually descend to her nephew Capt. Henry White Langford-Brooke, son of the late Henry William White Esq. of Monar in Ross-shire, by Alexandra Eliza his wife, the daughter of Col. Alexander MacLeod. He assumed the additional surname of Langford-Brooke by royal licence in 1874.\"\n\nFrom the family tree we see that Catherine Mary Langford Brooke and Alexandra Eliza White were sisters. Thus in 1879 it was envisaged that the estates would pass via Mrs. Langford-Brooke to her sister’s son and therefore out of the Brooke family. It is assumed, but not proven by my research, that no male heirs remained from younger sons of earlier generations.\n\nThe Langford Brookes as Slave Owners\n\nThe recent release of the data on the compensation received by slave owners when slavery was abolished in the British Colonies in 1834, has allowed the following information to be found. The Langford Brooke's owned land in Antigua, inherited by the marriage of Peter Brooke in generation 5 below to Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of Jonas Langford. The list below relates to Peter Langford Brooke of Mere Old Hall Cheshire who is found in generation 7 below. He died in 1840\n\nAccording to the Office of National Statistics, price inflation price since 1834 is by a factor of 130. However, there are problems with valuing standard commodities through the decades as methods of production changed with mechanisation. Another way to look at the issue is to look at incomes. An agricultural labourer in 1834 would earn about £28 a year based on information from more than 700 parishes. The minimum wage in the UK in 2020 is £8.72 an hour, amounting, before any deductions, to £348.80 for a 40 hour week and £18,137 a year. This is 648 times higher than £28 a year. By either method of measurement of inflation, £10,000 in 1834 was a huge sum, when the salary of a curate might be only £50 a year.\n\nThe Langford Brookes were not the only landed gentry slave owners in Cheshire and among the biggest were the Hibbert family. Robert Hibbert of Chalfont Park and Birtles Hall near Henbury in Cheshire was a deceased claimant and had 934 slaves in Jamaica. Thomas Hibbert of Birtles Hall was the beneficiary of these slaves and in addition had a further 91 in Jamaica. In total he received £17,418. William Hibbert of Hare Hill, near over Alderley in Cheshire, whose grounds now belong to the National Trust, owned 520 slaves in Jamaica and was awarded £9,387. He was an unsuccessful claimant for a further 218 slaves as a mortgagee.\n\nJohn Tollemache of Peckforton Castle in Cheshire had six estates on Antigua with a total of 822 slaves and received compensation of £12,667. Wilbraham Egerton of Tatton Park received £10,058 for 185 slaves.\n\nNo compensation was paid to the slaves for their work or loss of liberty.\n\n1. Sir Peter Brooke was the second son of Thomas Brooke of Norton Priory, Esq. by Eleanor Gerard his third wife. Sir Peter purchased the Mere estate from John Mere Esq. in 1652. He was knighted in 1660, MP County of Chester 8 Car. II, & high sheriff of Cheshire in 1669; living on 10 July 1684. He 2nd wife was Frances, daughter of Nicholas Trot of Quickshot, Hertfordshire, the widow of William Merbury Esq. of Merbury; his 3rd wife was Mabell, daughter of William Farrington of Werden, widow of Richard Clayton, Esq., of Crooke. No issue. By his first wife he had two sons, Thomas and Richard. A picture of Sir Peter Brooke is on display at Astley Hall near Chorley in Lancashire, which his second son acquired through marriage to the Charnock heiress.
