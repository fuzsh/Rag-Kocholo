        "text": "Rumors about an elusive poker game hosted by a Manhattan tech tycoon had been swirling around for months. I’d first heard about it from a book publisher of my acquaintance, then from a German princess I met at a cocktail party, then from a Swedish banker, from the CEO of a global nonprofit, from a television personality. A women-only game, held twice a year, with money going to charity and friendships effortlessly forged. In certain circles, it was an evening marked on calendars months in advance; some even jetted to New York to attend.\n\nSo when the actual e-vite arrived in my inbox—“You are cordially invited to a night of poker . . . cheat sheets and instructions will be provided”—I responded “Will Attend” without hesitation. Two weeks later, on what happens to be International Women’s Day, I ride an elevator to the 26th floor of a Tribeca tower and step into a living room full of women I recognize, but have never met. By a table brightly laden with sushi, activist Saleemah Abdul-Ghafur is telling a book author about the daunting challenges of her job: advising 49 African heads of state on how to fight malaria and bring health services to their countries. I say hello to a powerful real-estate investor and overhear an Argentinian–Puerto Rican entrepreneur who has spoken at the World Economic Forum ask a venture capitalist fluent in four languages where the e-cigars are (clearly, she’s been here before). By the potted fig trees, arrayed beneath more windows than I can count, a couple of former broadcast journalists, a pair of lawyers, and an actress discuss how they are reimagining fashion, technology, education, media, science, retail.\n\nThe thread that ties this crowd together is the host, Heidi Messer, 45, an entrepreneur, investor, and fixture on the TechCrunch-Economist-Wired conference circuit, dressed tonight in tapered black pants and a blousy leather top. Since selling LinkShare, the company she helped start, a decade ago, she’s founded another venture, Collective[i], which analyzes big data for a network of Fortune 500 businesses. Her competition: SAP and IBM. “In my world, the room is ten percent women on a good day,” she says, pressing a glass of Sancerre into my hand.\n\nAt the center of the loft, Messer’s dining table is draped in green felt. The dealer at these games is always male, and tonight Messer’s husband and partner in Collective[i], Tad Martin, has volunteered for duty. He attempts to direct the group to the decks as Messer reminds us to refill our wine glasses, and trade dollars for chips. All winnings will be donated to the charity directed by Abdul-Ghafur, the African Leaders Malaria Alliance, and the Taproot Foundation, an organization run by attendee and the best player at the table, Liz Hamburg, that connects top business talent with non-profits for pro bono work. Half of the attendees are new to Texas hold 'em; the rest learned at Messer’s last game, in which newcomer Liz Bacelar, 37, who had just sold her conference series, Decoded Fashion, to a Hearst-backed media group, walked away with third place winnings (which she then donated to the night’s benefactor, the nonprofit Girl Up). Looping her arm into mine and escorting me to the cards is Olga Vidisheva, 29, a former model from Kyrgyzstan who launched Shoptiques.com after graduating from Harvard Business School in 2011. While we connect the dots to my sister, who also has a fashion-tech start-up, Modalyst.co, Vidisheva tells me she’s determined to come out on top. (“I had someone in my office teach me to play,” she confides.) The group is spirited and slow to take their seats. Finally, twenty-dollar bills fly around the table; cards are dealt and bets are placed.\n\nMesser began hosting Poker Nights a few years ago. “I looked at how, for men, a lot of business happened in a social setting, like on the golf course,” she tells me. “I thought I’d invite people at the top of their fields with the intent to help one another. It would be fun.” She chose poker—which neither she nor most of the women she knew had ever played before—because it would be the ultimate equalizer. She started with a few spontaneous games with $100 buy-ins, then Messer formalized the night in 2012 with a charity tie-in. Some 20 women attended that game, including Campbell Brown, 46, the former TV anchor who is now championing charter schools, and real estate baroness Barbara Corcoran, 66, who, one attendee told me, brazenly hid chips in her dress.\n\nRight away meaningful connections were made. Thanks to the last poker night, tech investor Gillian Sandler landed a spot on the Johns Hopkins University Physics and Astronomy Advisory Board and is currently offering the chance to name an advanced microwave telescope, for $5 million, that will be launched 17,000 feet above the Atacama Desert. At the same game, producer MaryBeth O’Connor (credits include The Other Man on screen and Rocky on stage) met a member of **Richard Branson’**s environmental organization the Carbon War Room; they are now collaborating in a project to bring media jobs to Newark. The managing directors of the poverty advocacy conference Africa Rising sat next to a cochair of the UN’s First Ladies Conference; through her, they recruited the former president of Malawi, Joyce Banda, to be the official spokesperson of their African fashion fund.\n\nIntellectual salons are nothing new. They’ve been around since the Renaissance, when royal ladies would convene in boudoirs to discuss the issues of the day. Women-only networking events have been commonplace at least since 1997, when Goldman Sachs’s first female sales manager, Janet Hanson, brought together women at the top of their game for a gathering called 85 Broads. (The group is now called Ellevate and has drawn thousands of women to workshops around the country.) But Messer’s Poker Night is neither salon nor network. Intimate, intensely competitive, unencumbered by agenda, the night is simply “a way to get the right people together at the right time,” Messer says.\n\nTonight it is O’Connor who is betting with abandon. \"Someone once told me I invest like a man,” she says to me, sotto voce, indicating that she felt equally insulted and amused. To my left sits Diane Brady, the former head of content at Bloomberg, about to start “my own thing,” as she calls it. By the end of the first round, the conversation has shifted from workout regimens to geopolitics. (Children are rarely mentioned, though I estimate 20 offspring among the women at my table.) Tonight, author Pamela Ryckman learns that she’s been friends with tech-investor Sandler’s fraternal twin sister for a decade; I overhear another player saying she wants “big numbers from Chuck, we better have at least $150 million.” Contacts are exchanged. Photos are taken. Laughter often drowns out tangential chatter. Two women bond over their matching bracelets, both from the African women’s trade initiative, Same Sky.\n\nA bell on Martin’s phone rings to increase minimum bids to $125 and speed the game along. Vidisheva can barely be seen behind her looming tower of chips. “Beginner’s luck,” she jokes as she wins a round with a pair of 10s. Next hand O’Connor goes all in, prompting most of the table to fold. The real estate investor quietly wins the next with a pair of sevens. “I’m the new Olga,” she says as she moves a pile of chips to her corner of the table. I’d watched her bluff her way through hand after hand (“classic business tactic,” Messer whispers), while everyone else was engaged in conversation about the telescope that will trace the origins of the universe.\n\nMesser’s list of interested players for the next game—June 22—has grown to 1,000. She’ll choose 50 (her biggest crowd yet) and host at Minton’s in Harlem. She’s booked three dealers for the night: former NBA all star Shaquille O’Neal; Dick Parsons, the former CEO of Time Warner; and The Bourne Identity director Doug Liman, who has manned a table at Poker Night before. “Who doesn’t want to be the center of attention?” he reports by email.\n\nBy 11:15 p.m. on this Sunday night, Messer announces that the next will be the last hand dealt, then she’s going to shut it down. “Everyone’s got work tomorrow,” she says, filling her wine glass one final time.\n\nEventually we leave, but not without a nudge. I share a cab with Georgie Benardete, serial investor and head of strategy of Shopbeam, and as we whisk up the West Side Highway, we compare notes. “There is such generosity in the air at Heidi’s,” Benardete remarks. “I don’t like the word networking. It has a stale, transactional connotation, and this isn’t about that, or about gender. It’s a new mindset.” She asks me to text her so we can stay in touch, kisses me on each cheek, then exits into darkness."
