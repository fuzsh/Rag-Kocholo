        "text": "I am a lifelong resident of Lake Charles, Louisiana. My wife, Brigette Walker Martin, and I have four children (three girls and one son). I am an active member of Good Shepherd Episcopal Church and past Vestry member holding the offices of Junior Warden, Senior Warden and Finance Committee Member of the church. Currently I am serving as a board member of the Chennault International Airport Authority. Big game hunting is my biggest passion; I sincerely love and respect the great outdoors. I am a 1980 graduate of Louisiana State University Baton Rouge with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Management. I joined Merrill Lynch Wealth Management in 2012.

This drives my interest in spending time volunteering with organizations in our community.\n\nInvesting involves risk. There is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities.
