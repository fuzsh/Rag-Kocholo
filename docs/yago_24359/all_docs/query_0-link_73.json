        "text": "Whether you're left, right, or somewhere in between, you've probably heard comments about Trump and Vance being called \"weird.\"\n\nTwitter: @notcapnamerica\n\nAnd if you haven't...well, let me explain!\n\nIt arguably started when Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (who people have speculated might be a VP pick for Harris) went on MSNBC last week and said, \"These are weird people on the other side.\"\n\nMSNBC / Via Twitter: @Tim_Walz\n\nHe continued, \"They want to take books away; they want to be in your exam room. That's what it comes down to. Don't sugarcoat this; these are weird ideas. Listen to them speak.\"\n\nNote: He's been calling conservatives weird since February.\n\nTwitter: @GovTimWalz\n\nThe phrase stuck and kinda started a moment. The Harris campaign co-opted the sentiment in a press release that asked, \"Is Donald Trump ok?\" and \"Trump is old and quite weird?\"\n\nTwitter: @marinafang\n\nAnd then the campaign released another one, which declared \"JD Vance is weird\" in its first sentence, with \"JD Vance Is A Creep (Who Wants To Ban Abortion Nationwide)\" as the headline.\n\nTwitter: @Victorshi2020\n\nNoticing that calling conservatives \"weird\" was taking off, this week, CNN's Jake Tapper asked Tim Walz, \"Why do you think weird is a more effective attack line against Trump than what Democrats have done previously, which is argue that he's an existential threat to democracy?\"\n\nAs Tapper and others have pointed out, the shift in messaging has changed dramatically since Biden dropped out and Harris became the presumed Democratic nominee.\n\nTwitter: @sahilkapur\n\nSome say the new messaging has been \"much more effective\" than the previous \"when they go low we go high\" messaging.\n\nTwitter: @sbstryker\n\nThis person said it's a better strategy because \"moralizing at\" conservatives doesn't work.\n\nTwitter: @holy_schnitt\n\nBasically, \"meeting them at their level\" is working.\n\nTwitter: @DavidADC\n\nIn response to Tapper's question, Walz said removing some of the scariness from communication (like Trump putting women's rights at risk and constitutional liberties at stake) and just naming it what it is — weird behavior — takes away some of Trump's credit and power. He said, \"Listen to the guy. He's talking about Hannibal Lecter and shocking sharks and just whatever crazy thing pops into his mind, and I [think] we just give him way too much credit. I think one of the things is [to] just ratchet down some of the scariness and just name it what it is.\"\n\nTwitter: @KamalaHQ\n\nHe continued, \"I've got to tell you. My observation on this is: Have you ever seen the guy laugh? That seems very weird to me that an adult can go through six and a half years of being in the public eye, if he has laughed, it's at someone, not with someone. That is weird behavior. And I don't think you call it anything else. It is simply what we're observing.\"\n\nIn further response to the new communication tactic, Harris supporters are standing behind the strategy. This sociology professor said that making fun of fascists has worked in history because they \"cannot deal with being laughed at.\"\n\nTwitter: @jeffreynparker\n\nThis has proved somewhat true for the conservative media — they are NOT having it with the \"weird\" remarks.\n\nFor instance, Fox News has been dissecting and rebuking the remark incessantly:\n\n...and J.D. Vance visibly cringed before answering a Fox News reporter who asked, \"There's a new insult that her [Harris] and her husband have been using, calling you weird. Does that hurt your feelings?\"\n\nOn Twitter, Vivek Ramaswamy called the \"they're weird\" argument \"dumb\" and \"juvenile\" and compared it to a \"high school prom queen contest\":\n\nTwitter: @VivekGRamaswamy\n\nIn response, users pointed out that Trump is playing the same game:\n\nTwitter: @franklinisbored\n\nTwitter: @davidhogg111\n\nAOC chimed in, writing, \"Being obsessed with repressing women is goofy. Trying to watch what LGBTQ+ people do all the time is abnormal. Punishing people who don't have biological offspring is creepy. It's an incel platform, dude. It's SUPER weird. And people need to know.\"\n\nTwitter: @AOC\n\nAnd as others have pointed out, some conservatives who are rebuking the \"weird\" claims are doubling down by being even weirder. Like this lady who said calling people weird is a \"feminine behavior\":\n\nTwitter: @Zeddary\n\nOr when Ben Shapiro argued that Harris hanging with the cast of RuPaul's Drag Race was \"substantially weirder than anything Vance has ever done\":\n\nTwitter: @ronnui_\n\nNote: Vance has been called weird for saying that adults without children do not deserve an equal say at the polls, saying America is run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives,\" suggesting people in “violent” marriages shouldn't get divorced, and by making an awkward joke about diet Mountain Dew being racist, amongst other things.\n\nAs this person said, \"it's genuinely amazing that in response to being called weird, conservatives keep saying the oddest shit.\"\n\nTwitter: @bigblackjacobin\n\nConservatives have also attempted to fire back by calling the left weird, but Democrats have argued it's not the same thing:\n\nTwitter: @batwingdings\n\nTwitter: @judysquirrels\n\nTwitter: @Leahgreenb\n\n@ellaemhoff / Via instagram.com\n\nTwitter: @kmelkhat\n\nWelp, whatever it takes!"
