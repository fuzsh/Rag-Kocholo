        "text": "Some soap fans thought that Tad the Cad was coming to Port Charles, but when Michael E. Knight showed up on General Hospital in September 2019, it turned out that he was playing a brand new character, attorney Martin Grey. The actor is best known to soap fans as All My Children’s Tad Martin and also enjoyed a stint as Dr. Simon Neville on The Young & The Restless. He continued to play the recurring role on GH until February 2024, though he could be back again.\n\nMartin was first introduced when the lawyer met with his client, Nelle Benson, at Pentonville where she was incarcerated. They discussed her case and he admitted it didn’t look good for her. She insisted that she had changed her ways and felt remorse for the crimes she’d committed, and Martin agreed to represent her at her parole hearing.\n\nThen, Martin found himself hired by Kim Nero to represent Franco Baldwin in court to argue that he was really Drew since he was implanted with his memories. The attorney was intrigued, and took the case, successfully arguing that Drew’s identity shouldn’t be determined by his physical appearance.\n\nAfter Nelle was finally released on parole, Martin continued to work with her as she schemed her way into the Quartermaine family, but he was really working more closely with Valentin Cassadine, helping him locate the codicil to maintain his hold on the Cassadine fortune. When that was finished, Martin continued working for Nelle, helping her argue her custody case to take Wiley away from Michael Corinthos.\n\nWhen Lulu fell into a coma following an explosion, Martin suggested Valentin take advantage of the opportunity to secure custody of their daughter and a disgusted Valentin fired him. It was later revealed that the lawyer shares a connection to Port Charles bad guy Cyrus Renault — they are brothers! Although Martin swore he never wanted anything to do with his sibling’s criminal empire.\n\nThings got even more shocking when Laura Collins learned that Martin and Cyrus were her half-brothers and Cyrus was responsible for the death of their father, Gordon Grey! Martin worried when Carly Corinthos had his mother, Florence Grey, abducted to use as leverage against Cyrus, and he worked together with Jackie Templeton to find out where she was being kept. Ultimately, he was able to see his mother and agreed to keep her away from Cyrus. Martin was touched when Laura tried to get to know him better and threw him a small birthday celebration, but their relationship soured when Cyrus revealed that the attorney had helped Julian flee town after he caused the bombing at the Floating Rib!\n\nMartin was relieved when Carly reunited him and his mother, and he also helped Molly Davis take down a racist judge. Unfortunately, even though Cyrus was finally brought to justice, he continued to threaten his family from behind bars, forcing Martin and Laura to go into hiding for their own protection. After months in a safe house, Martin and Laura had plenty of time to bond, but then an assassin struck! Laura saved her brother, and after the assassin was arrested, they returned to Port Charles, believing the danger had passed.\n\nMartin filled in for Kevin Collins at the hospital playing Santa for the sick kids and when Lucy Coe sat on his lap to flirt with Kevin, she was surprised to see who it really was. But it all worked out fine as Martin and Lucy spent the night together and decided to see where this might lead! Unfortunately, Valentin forced Martin to choose between dating Lucy and having him as a client, so the couple had to sneak around.\n\nPeter August tried to hire Martin, but after a talk with Laura, the attorney recused himself. After a passionate reunion, he and Lucy decided to go public with their relationship. And Valentin had to just deal with it because he needed Martin’s help to stop the ELQ and Aurora Media merger. When Anna Devane dug up dirt about the attorney’s finances to force him to spy on Valentin, the lawyer left town until her investigation was over. When Martin returned to Port Charles, he was then heartbroken when it appeared that Lucy had been murdered by Anna. However, learning that Victor Cassadine had abducted her and framed Anna, Martin helped Anna and Valentin avoid the cops while on the run. He then took on Esme Prince as a client, as the pregnant young woman was suffering from amnesia as she found herself accused of being The Hook killer.\n\nOn behalf of Nina Reeves, Martin reported Carly Spencer and Drew Cain to the SEC for insider trading. When she later had second thoughts, the attorney assured her that the tip couldn’t be traced back to her. Convinced Martin was hiding something from her, Lucy enlisted Felicia Scorpio’s help and the women infiltrated the law office of Jackson Montgomery and discovered Martin was receiving hefty alimony checks from his ex-wife that would stop if he remarried. Lucy was furious and confronted Martin about the reason he didn’t want to marry her. Things got even more complicated when Lucy was in danger of losing Deception due to a lawsuit and she accused Martin of stealing the idea for the Deceptor. Martin was stunned when his ex, Blair Cramer, showed up in Port Charles to meet with Tracy Quartermaine, and she blamed him for stealing her product idea.\n\nMartin supported Lucy as she settled with Tracy and reluctantly agreed to her demands. But then Michael Corinthos confronted the lawyer about calling the SEC. Warning that Sonny wouldn’t ask as nicely, Michael recorded Martin’s confession that he’d acted on Nina’s behalf! The attorney tried to convince Michael not to use the recording or face Nina’s wrath, but to no avail.\n\nDr. Hamilton Finn hired Martin to represent him in a malpractice suit, and they were able to discover that the patient who had died, set Finn up so his family could live off the settlement. Although the doctor didn’t want to hurt the guy’s wife and kids, Martin was willing to do it to get his client off. But in the end, the wife dropped the case after Tracy donated to her late husband’s GoFundMe.\n\nIn February 2024, Martin grew very suspicious when Lucy was spending quite a bit of time with Scott Baldwin, and wouldn’t tell him why. Although he admitted he loved her more than any other woman ever in his life, Martin declared that their relationship was over. Although Nina attempted to get Martin to help her poach her Crimson staff after Drew fired her from the magazine, he couldn’t be bothered and had a plane to catch. Before leaving town, Martin stopped by Laura’s to give her legal papers he’d had drawn up so she and Kevin could legally adopt Ace. Lucy raced to the airport but Martin had already boarded the flight to North Carolina.\n\nStay tuned to see if he ever comes back!"
