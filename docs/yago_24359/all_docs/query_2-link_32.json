        "text": "By\n\nDaytime favorite Michael E. Knight has left his role of Martin Grey on ABC’s General Hospital. However, it appears this move is a temporary one.\n\nKnight, who has played the recurring role of Laura Collins’ (Genie Francis) brother and a love interest for Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring), began in the role on the ABC daytime drama series since 2019.\n\nGH wrote off the legal eagle when on the February 12th episode, Martin left Port Charles to visit his mother who has been in failing health. On that episode, Lucy tries to let Martin know how she truly feels for him, but Martin isn’t willing to listen to any of it, since he can’t deal with her ongoing relationship with her ex Scott Baldwin (Kin Shriner) and he breaks things off with her.\n\nAccording to Soap Opera Digest, Knight will be off the canvas temporarily. No dates were cited as to when he would return. With the series undergoing a writing regime shift with Patrick Mulcahey and Elizabeth Korte taking over the head scribe duties from Chris Van Etten and Dan O’Connor, it will be interesting to see if they bring the character back sooner than later.\n\nViewers know Knight best for his Daytime Emmy-winning role as Tad Martin on All My Children; a role he played on and off from 1982-2011. Knight returned to the Prospect Park version of the series when AMC finally was rebooted online in 2013. Later In 2015, he joined The Young and the Restless as Dr. Simon Neville in a role that he played until 2016.\n\nSo, how do you feel about Michael E. Knight exiting General Hospital? Will the series bring him back? Were you rooting for Martin and Lucy to find happiness with one another?
