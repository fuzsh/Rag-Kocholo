        "text": "Welcome! I'm Brooke, and I love photography! I've lived in the same small Maryland town my entire life, and my husband, son, and I live in a home that I designed and my father built. I love dogs and cats and have a very big heart - for people and animals. My husband and I were so fortunate to welcome our first child in early 2020 and it has been the greatest joy seeing him learn and discover new things. I am very close with my family and love celebrating all life events - even the small silly ones (I've hosted three separate dog DNA parties for my rescue pups!). I love summer weather, I find four leaf clovers all the time, and my absolute favorite color is pink. I've been a vegetarian since I was 17, I love to make people laugh, and I am a total perfectionist. All of my pets have people names, I am obsessed with learning new things and really enjoy art projects, I love turning old furniture into a new treasure, and I am so fortunate to celebrate so many beautiful weddings with couples I call friends! Fun fact: I am also a college professor and I teach at the same college I attended years ago.\n\nI was a hobby photographer and blogger for many years before I became a wedding and portrait photographer in 2012 - over a decade ago! I love taking pictures; getting to know my couples, framing a perfect shot, and editing a beautiful image inspires me so much. I am incredibly passionate about what I do, and that passion shows not only in my work, but in my enthusiasm about each wedding and photo session. I love photography so much - and it shows!\n\nI have a huge heart, and it is really important to me to make others feel loved, special, and valued - which is part of why I get so much joy from being a wedding photographer. Having a photo of yourself that makes you feel proud, or happy, or just plain old good about yourself is SO valuable! I absolutely love being able to give that to people.\n\nOutside of photography, I love my family, especially my son, Bradley, and my pets. I have a Master's degree in English and completed an additional nine college credits in photography after graduation. In addition to photography, I teach at a local college.\n\nBeing a photographer for over ten years has been so much fun, and I am really thankful for all of the friends I have met over the years.\n\nWe're a sister team, and it truly couldn't be better. When I began Brooke Tyson Photography in 2012, I never imagined it would lead to spending more time with my best friend and younger sister, Kelsey. Kelsey and I swap gear throughout the day, can read each other's minds like no one else (seriously!), and love our BTP couples so much.\n\nKelsey completed undergrad with a solid 4.0 and went on to finish top in her class in pharmacy school. She is so dedicated, driven, and talented, and I love that we compliment each other in so many ways.\n\nKelsey adores cats (especially her boy, Kobe!), loves running (and making me go jogging, too), and is obsessed with rock climbing. She can't start the day without a cup of coffee, she loves reading (especially listening to audio books), and she always has new craft project ideas. Kelsey and her husband welcomed twin babies in 2024!\n\nIn 2014, my husband, Justin, began Last Avalon Films and started filming weddings both with the Brooke Tyson Photography team and on his own. Justin is an outstanding second shooter as well because he has such a unique eye and comes to weddings from a film perspective. The best, though, is when the three of us work together; the trifecta, the three musketeers, or the dynamic trio - whatever we call ourselves, we love working together, and I could not be more grateful that the BTP team is family.\n\nJustin loves animals, is a huge fan of 90's music, and is a little obsessed with football (especially his hometown's Philadelphia Eagles!) and pretty much every other Philadelphia sports team. He loves cooking and trying new recipes and loves to travel. He also loves Disney World just as much as Brooke and Bradley do!\n\nWhenever I see a sunset, I just have to stop and take a picture. The same for a flock of birds in flight or a gorgeous shadow from a tree. I was originally drawn to photography in 2007 because I wanted to remember these moments, and I wanted to be able to share them with others. I think it is so important to to really notice and appreciate the beauty that is in our everyday life."
