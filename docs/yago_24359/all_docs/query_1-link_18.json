        "text": "The spotlight will be on Brooke Shields this week following the broadcast premiere of her Hulu documentary Pretty Baby.\n\nThe doc is airing on ABC on Monday night (January 8) as a three-hour special, nine months after it debuted on the streaming service.\n\nViewers will likely be interested in learning more about Brooke‘s current life, so let’s fill you in on her relationship status.\n\nKeep reading to find out more…\n\nBrooke has been married to screenwriter and producer Chris Henchy since 2001.\n\nThe couple met in 1999 and have been together ever since. They share two daughters – Rowan, 20, and Grier, 17.\n\n“To this day I believe that I fell in love with Chris the day we met, in 1999, but I would never tell him that!” Brooke wrote in her memoir in 2005. “I had just gotten an American bulldog, Darla, and I brought her to meet friends of mine in the gym on the Warner Bros. lot."
