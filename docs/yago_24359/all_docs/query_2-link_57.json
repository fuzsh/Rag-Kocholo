        "text": "Former Marine and war veteran Danny McCoy starts under Ed's wing and comes into his own running the Montecito.\n\nDuhamel came into his own too after hitting the jackpot with Las Vegas, juggling his series with roles in Win a Date With Tad Hamilton and Transformers. After the series' end in 2008, it was onto two Transformers sequels; rom-coms including When in Rome and New Year's Eve, and a return to All My Children as Leo du Pres for a few 2011 episodes.\n\nDuhamel also starred in the detective series Battle Creek, played real-life detective Greg Kading in Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G. and was a doting dad in the coming-of-age dramedy Love, Simon. Most recently, he starred in NBC's true crime series The Thing About Pam and romanced Jennifer Lopez in Shotgun Wedding.\n\nDuhamel met ex-wife Fergie on the set of Las Vegas when the Black Eyed Peas had a cameo. They married in 2004 and had son Axl before finalizing their divorce in 2019.\n\nHe married Audra Mari in September 2022 and they announced right after their first anniversary that they've got a baby on the way.\n\nAlready a legend thanks to his role as Sonny Corleone in The Godfather, the veteran movie star eased right into the role of \"Big Ed\" Deline, security boss-turned-head of operations at the Montecito, as well as father figure to Danny—and the father of Delinda, Danny's eventual meant-to-be love interest.\n\nThe star of Brian's Song, The Gambler, Misery, Honeymoon in Vegas and For the Boys left Las Vegas after four seasons, saying he wanted to have more time to make movies. He went on to star with his son Scott Caan in the 2009 drama Mercy, which Scott also wrote; guest-star on Hawaii 5-0; play a mob kingpin in the Starz series Magic City and lend his voice to Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, among myriad other projects. His last screen appearance was in Fast Charlie.\n\nCaan was married four times and had five kids. He died at the age of 82 in July 2022.\n\nThe genius daughter of Ed and Jillian, Delinda Deline, is the Montecito's food and beverage director, having found college on the boring side. She and Danny, who she's known since she was a kid, are totally made for each other, but after not being able to commit in season one, it takes them a few more years to figure it out and get engaged.\n\nA model and TV host as well, Sims appeared in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition five times, including twice while she was on Las Vegas, and these days she's a lifestyle entrepreneur, dishing out food, fitness, fashion, home decor and parenting inspo on her website.\n\nShe's been married to producer and Netflix executive Scott Stuber since 2011 and they have three kids.\n\nThe former Charlie's Angels star played Ed's patient wife Jillian—but apparently her patience ran out after James Caan left the show, because later it's revealed that Jillian left Ed.\n\nLadd acts regularly, appearing on CSI: Miami, NCIS, Chuck, Ray Donovan, The People v. O.J. Simpson (playing Robert Shapiro's wife, Linell) and Ballers, and was in the Lifetime holiday movies The Christmas Contract and Grounded for Christmas. She most recently appeared in the 2022 film A Cowgirl's Song.\n\nShe kept her first husband David Ladd's name but has been married to Brian Russell since 1981. She's mom to daughter Jordan Ladd and stepmom to Russell's daughter Lindsey.\n\nOf course the best casino boss in the world works alongside the best pit boss in Vegas, \"Ice Queen\" Nessa Holt.\n\nAfter her own conman-turned-CIA recruit father faked his own death, Nessa was practically raised as one of Ed and Jillian's own kids, and ended up like a sister to Delinda—but she ends up leaving the Montecito (and Mike) after two seasons to join her dad and long-lost sister in their new lives.\n\nThomason, who's from Manchester, England, went on to play Naomi on Lost and FBI agent Donna Berrigan on White Collar. She's also had guest arcs on NCIS: Los Angeles, The Good Doctor and Better Things, and appeared on SEAL Team and MacGyver, as well as played a political adviser in the Sky One drama Cobra.\n\nShe's been married to Craig Sykes since 2009 and they have a daughter, Tallulah.\n\nMontecito's special events director Mary Connell had an abusive father and Danny has always been her night in shining armor—and they almost get married, but she takes off after possibly killing her terrible dad because he's too connected to let the law take its course. But she sends a photo that lets Danny know that she's alright.\n\nAfter exiting the show after four seasons, Cox did some voice work and TV movies, but mainly put acting on the back burner to focus on family. She too met her future spouse, Jay Mohr, on the Las Vegas set when he had a guest appearance, and they married in 2006. He famously added her name to his, becoming Jon (his actual first name) Ferguson Cox Mohr, but they divorced in 2018. They have a son together, Meredith.\n\nPresenting Sam Marquez, Montecito resident and the best casino host in the world. She ends up owning the Montecito for a week after her ex-husband and hotel owner Casey Manning is poisoned and leaves her the hotel in his will, then almost loses it for failure to pay back taxes. Eventually she decides she'll marry Vic, Casey's brother, because he reminds her of her dead ex.\n\nMarcil got her start on General Hospital and most notably has worked on Beverly Hills, 90210 (where she met Brian Austin Green, the father of her son) and Lipstick Jungle, and has starred in a number of Hallmark Channel and Lifetime movies, including 2019's My Stepfather's Secret.\n\nShe was married to Corey Feldman from 1989 to 1993. Her son Kassius was born in 2002 and she split with Green the following year (though he still appeared on a 2004 episode of Las Vegas with Paris Hilton playing his fiancée.) Marcil married CSI: NY star Carmine Giovinazzo in 2010 but filed for divorce in 2012.\n\nNaturally, when James Caan left the show's producers wanted to replace one titan with another: enter Magnum P.I. as business and real estate mogul A.J. Cooper, who bails the Montecito out of financial trouble and takes over as owner in season five.\n\nBefore and after joining the cast of Las Vegas, Selleck starred as troubled L.A. homicide detective-turned-troubled New England police chief Jesse Stone in nine made-for-TV movies based on the Robert B. Parker novels, and he's been playing New York City Police Commissioner Frank Reagan on CBS' Blue Bloods since 2010.\n\nThe once-divorced Selleck has been married to his wife, Jillie, since 1987 and they're parents to daughter Hannah.\n\nShades of Anna Nicole Smith, Boyle's insufferable casino mogul Monica Mancuso started off as a 25-year-old waitress and stripper who married an 85-year-old billionaire—hence her very comfortable lifestyle years later. In season three Monica dies in a freak accident, falling off the roof of the hotel and crashing into a shoe store.\n\nBoyle, best known for Twin Peaks, Threesome and The Practice (as well as for dating Jack Nicholson in the 1990s), did an episode of Law & Order in 2008 and has appeared in a handful of small films since, but otherwise has been leading a private life—and noticeably was not in Twin Peaks' years-in-the-making third season on Showtime in 2017. Her character, Donna, had previously been replaced by Moira Kelly in the prequel film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me.\n\nShe's been married to her second husband, real estate investor Donald Ray Thomas II, since 2006.\n\nThe onetime Superman had a recurring role as Sam's ex, Casey Manning, who used to own the Montecito and then inherits it again after Monica's death. It turned out he was poisoned before getting killed in a boating accident in season four, but he had drawn up a will leaving the financially strapped hotel to Sam before he went.\n\nCain has made a prolific amount of made-for-TV and independent movies over the years, most recently appearing in the 2022 film Miracle at Manchester, as well as had recurring roles on Lady Dynamite, Supergirl and Hit the Floor.\n\nHe has a son, Christopher, with ex-girlfriend Samantha Torres.\n\nWhen the Montecito was in need of a forensic pathologist (or an NBC crossover event), in came Dr. Jordan Cavanaugh of Crossing Jordan fame, often with Detective Woody in tow.\n\nAfter Crossing Jordan ended in 2007, Hennessy, previously best known for playing ADA Claire Kincaid on Law & Order, released an album, Ghost in My Head, and devoted more time to making music, performing at Lillith Fair in 2010. She played a veterinarian in the short-lived HBO drama Luck, had an arc on Madam Secretary, released a second album called I Do and appeared on Bull in 2018.\n\nShe starred on the Showtime crime drama City on a Hill with Kevin Bacon and Aldis Hodge, and in 2020 she was in the Netflix movie Standing Up, Falling Down with Billy Crystal and Ben Schwartz.\n\nHennessy has been married to Paolo Mastropietro since 2000 and they have two sons, Marco and Gianni, together."
