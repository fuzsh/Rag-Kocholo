        "text": "Former CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin has filed for divorce from British producer James Fletcher, new court records show.\n\n“After nearly five years of marriage, with love and respect, James and I have decided to go our separate ways,” Baldwin said in a statement to The Post.\n\n“Our time together has been some of the most precious, defining, and awakening years of my life. I wish him nothing but the best as he begins this new chapter.”\n\nBaldwin, 43, filed the divorce papers in Manhattan Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nThe pair tied the knot in May 2018 in a ceremony at Liberty Farms in Ghent, NY, after getting engaged in 2017 and dating for two years prior, according to a report by the Sun.\n\nBaldwin left CNN in April 2021 after 13 years with the network with no other job lined up at the time.\n\nIn a podcast interview from 2021, Baldwin criticized the outlet as being male-dominated and said she had to “fight for women’s stories.”\n\n“The most influential anchors on our network, the highest-paid, are men. My bosses, my executives, are men. The person who oversees CNN Dayside is a man, and my executive producer for 10 years is a man. So I’ve been surrounded by a lot of men,” she said at the time.\n\nBaldwin announced her exit in February 2021 — a few months after she was replaced by political anchor Jake Tapper for the month leading up to the 2020 election.\n\nBaldwin had a weeks-long public battle with coronavirus in April 2020. Fletcher stopped distancing himself from her as her health continued to decline and it “became impossible” for him to stay away, she said in an essay for CNN.\n\n“He began to hold me in those darker moments and let me cry, whispering: ‘Everything’s going to be all right,'” she wrote.\n\nFletcher did not immediately return a request for comment sent through social media."
