With all of it happening in the public eye, I've had to learn how to best navigate those changes as they come, which has been difficult to say the least.\"\n\nBrooke explained, \"For my own journey to healing and happiness, I have chosen to create some distance between myself and my family, and am focusing on people and things that heal my heart and align with my own personal beliefs, goals, and values.\"\n\nShe did add at the end: \"I wish him well\" with a heart emoji."
