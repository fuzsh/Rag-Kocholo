        "text": "A version of this story appears in the Sunday Life section of The Oklahoman.\n\nFrom fan to filmmaker: deadCenter ICON Award winner Ryan Bellgardt reflects on his movie career\n\nRyan Bellgardt has attended the deadCenter Film Festival in many roles over the years: film fan, press member, moviemaker and, this year, icon.\n\n\"It's made me be very retrospective about how this all happened, starting out as a fan - a passholder that's waiting in line to get in to see a Lloyd Kaufman movie - to I think we've had three films in deadCenter. 'Jurassic Games' won a Special Jury Award, and winning this award now, it's surreal,\" Bellgardt said.\n\n\"There's reasons that you make movies, and it's not to win awards. ... But filmmaking is not a glamorous thing. There are moments like this where ... you think, 'Yeah, all the work that I did, these moments make it worth it.\"\n\nThe Edmond native accepted the Oklahoma Film & TV ICON Award June 13 during this year's virtual deadCenter Film Festival, which continues through Sunday online at www.deadcenterfilm.org. The state's largest film festival gives its ICON Award annually to people from Oklahoma who have not only achieved personal success but have elevated the perception of Oklahomans in film around the world.\n\nIt's a heady honor for a filmmaker whose first deadCenter memory is attending a midnight screening of Kaufman's 2006 horror-comedy musical \"Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead.\"\n\n\"It was a really raucous crowd for a movie that was just - the best way I can describe that movie was insane. I remember just thinking, 'That was a different movie experience than just going to your theater and watching a big blockbuster or something.' It was a movie experience where the director was there, the filmmakers were there, and these people were rabid fans of this - and they were all going crazy. I think right then and there I fell in love with the festival experience,\" Bellgardt recalled. \"Lucas Ross and I were doing the (local TV segment) 'Two Movie Guys' and we were press at deadCenter one year and interviewed a bunch of people.\n\n\"I've just been a part of it for quite a while, but sometime back there I was at somebody's movie - I think it was called 'Ecstasy of Gold'; it was a Western - and I remember the director went up and talked to the audience and was answering questions. And I just thought, 'I just want to do that. I want to be that guy.' So, I just started making movies and eventually got one finished and got into the festival and it was awesome.\"\n\nStudio success\n\nBefore he started making movies, Bellgardt made music and worked in radio with late local legend Danny Williams at KOMA. About a decade ago, he started experimenting with computer animation software.\n\n\"I worked a lot in music and did a lot of recording and wrote my own music ... and played in rock bands. I started getting into videos ... and I realized that all that stuff to me just exercised the same muscles in my brain, that creative urge,\" he said.\n\n\"When you open up the 3-D software, it's just blank. There's nothing in it. It's just a blank, gray nothing, and I started to realize what can be done in it. ... This is the same piece of software they made Gollum in the 'Lord of the Rings.' I'm like, 'Anything I can dream up or imagine, if I have the knowledge, I can build it in here.' So, about 10 years ago, I started learning that.\"\n\nThe Edmond Memorial High School alumnus is the founding partner and creative director of Boiling Point Media advertising agency. Bellgardt won an Emmy for directing and producing the \"Two Movie Guys Intergalactic Holiday Showdown,\" then launched a film production company within Boiling Point that now employs a full-time CGI animation team.\n\n\"Boiling Point Media has become what we believe is the most successful film studio in the state of Oklahoma,\" said deadCenter Film Executive Director Lance McDaniel.\n\nBut Bellgardt said the movie studio started small.\n\n\"I remember a time being at an apartment, and I had my computer set up in a closet and I was trying to learn that software. I was terrible at it and I was not confident at all that I was gonna ever be able to get close to good at it. And then fast-forward 15 years later, I've got a group of 20 people all working on this software, some of them coming to me saying, 'You hired me to do my dream job, man, thank you so much.' That's a really awesome feeling - and that's not something that I anticipated that would happen,\" he said.\n\n\"I do recognize the significance of creating something in Oklahoma with Oklahomans that's grassroots to be able to be playing in the same arena (as Hollywood). We might not be the champions, but we're in the same league, or trying to be. I think that my goal is to be able to inch our way up there to where we can have right here in Oklahoma big-time productions coming and say, 'We're going to hire this team here in Oklahoma to help us with \"Spider-Man.\"' ... That's in our future; we just gotta keep moving toward that.\"\n\nInternational reach\n\nIn less than 10 years, Bellgardt has directed five feature films: the 2013 sci-fi Civil War adventure \"Army of Frankensteins,\" the 2017 creature feature \"Gremlin,\" the 2018 the prehistoric mashup \"Jurassic Games,\" last year's family-friendly jaunt \"The Adventures of Jurassic Pet\" and this year's teen fantasy \"The Adventures of Rufus the Fantastic Pet.\" He made all of them in his home state, and all of them have earned international distribution.\n\n\"We got a little bit luck with 'Army of Frankensteins' and had the ability to connect up with a sales agent. From that point, I got really interested in the business of all this; it's really a whole other world. But it was really pretty common sense: If you could make a movie that appeals to buyers - and I'm not talking about necessarily a casual viewer; I'm talking about someone who buys your movie to distribute it - and that they think they can go and sell, then you have a much better chance of getting your movie out there,\" he said.\n\n\"That has been such a successful formula for us because we're branching off now to different companies, meeting different people that are hiring us.\"\n\nPushing boundaries\n\nHis Boiling Point team is creating the visual effects for two family-friendly movies filming in Oklahoma, creating magical kangaroos for \"Joey and Ella\" and animating a talking chimpanzee for \"C.I.APE.\"\n\n\"It's a lot of fun. ... As we do it more and more and more, we sort of push the boundaries of what we're capable of doing,\" he said. \"So, the next step for us is to continue nurturing those relationships with those clients but also developing our own intellectual property.\"\n\nFor the first time in many years, Bellgardt isn't sure what he will be directing next.\n\n\"I think that with the experience that I've had now, I'm excited to be able to look forward to being able to be a little bit - just a little bit - pickier about the things that I would want to dive into. ... It doesn't mean that it's not a cute family movie about a little dinosaur,\" he said.\n\nShortly after releasing his 2019 film \"The Adventures of Jurassic Pet,\" he received a message from the mother of a toddler who was struggling with a serious illness and was on a breathing machine.\n\n\"She was like, 'Look, he's had \"Jurassic Pet\" on loop since it came out, and he has watched it so much that it's actually given me and my husband the chance to go downstairs and put on a movie and have a date night. So, thank you so much for making that movie.' ... That moment happens, and you're like, 'Well, that makes every single one-star review on IMDB worth it - because you get those, too,\" Bellgardt said.\n\n\"The journey of that guy who just went to deadCenter as a fan and wanted to start making movies to being awarded with something like this and thinking back on how it happened, it's pretty powerful and just really awesome to be honored.\"\n\n-BAM"
