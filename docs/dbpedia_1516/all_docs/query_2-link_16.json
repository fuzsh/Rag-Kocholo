        "text": "After 50+ years in the New York inde­pendent movie scene, with dozens of fea­tures to his name, Troma co-founder Lloyd Kaufman is releasing what could be his final film, #ShakespearesShitstorm, “be­fore flying off to that great director’s chair in the sky,” he said.\n\nIt’s an irreverent musical adaptation of Shakespeare’s The Tempest that touches on contemporary themes like the opioid crisis and social media intolerance. The NYC premiere is showing at Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria on April 8th at 7pm, and features a Q&A with Lloyd Kaufman himself (!), followed by a week of 11pm showings (April 8-14) at Cinema Village in Union Square, with a Q&A with Kaufman on April 9.\n\nThe Queens Gazette took this opportu­nity to interview Lloyd Kaufman regard­ing his new film.\n\nEstablished in 1974 by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz, Troma Entertainment, the company that Lloyd Kaufman is di­rectly involved with, is according to their press material, “arguably the longest run­ning independent movie studio in North America.” Some of the films that Troma has produced and distributed include Kaufman’s The Toxic Avenger, Trey Parker’s Cannibal! The Musical, Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead, Class of Nuke ‘Em High, Charles Kaufman’s Mother’s Day and Tromeo & Juliet.\n\nKaufman has worked with Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Costner, and Samuel L. Jackson to name just a few.\n\nKaufman has also worked on films that he did not distribute, produce, or direct, in­cluding Rocky, and Saturday Night Fever, two major films from that era. But as Kaufman stated, his relationship with mainstream Hollywood would not and could not last long. He always felt that there would be problems and “I always wanted to do things my own way and my employers insisted I do things the correct way.” And anyway, his impressive creden­tials as well as the risks he took ultimately have paid off as he has been involved in many successful films.\n\nClearly from his bio and numerous ar­ticles about Lloyd Kaufman, it is obvious that he is by definition very much an inde­pendent film person, as he has consistently gone out of the box and away from what was seemingly popular mainstream media, and instead focused on what he felt was the creative and dynamic genre of Troma Entertainment. (We are running out to get his hit book, All I Need to Know About Filmmaking I Learned From The Toxic Avenger, published by Penguin Putnam.)\n\nKaufman is an advocate of true free speech and points out how the political cli­mate has made it so that we only have free speech if we don’t say anything, to quote one of his political friends, Al Franken. Wanting free speech and the right to do what he wanted was a motivating factor.\n\nWe asked Mr. Kaufman what motivates him after so many years in this business to keep going forward. Kaufman answered, “It’s very simple. I get obsessed with something. And I don’t let go.”\n\nHe explained that he saw The Tempest with his mother live on stage when he was eight years old and it’s been his favorite play, and literally he became obsessed with it. He has continued to work his magic and make magic monsters as a result of the things he has seen in his life, the books that he’s read, the shows that he’s watched, the movies that he’s helped create, and been involved with – of the above have led to a cauldron where all of these ideas and con­cepts have been mixed together and the re­sulting drink or smorgasbord, if you prefer, is Kaufman’s legacy of creations.\n\nIn the interview he indicated, “This very well may be my last movie. It’s all set up based on one of the greatest plays in history, and every­one who’s ever studied The Tem­pest or watched it will enjoy this film.”\n\nWe asked Mr. Kaufman a question we always like to ask, “Who are some of your favorite directors?” and of course he mentioned John Ford, Fritz Lang, Howard Hawks, and many others in the pantheon of film. But the most emotional aspect of the interview was his genuine respect, admiration, and thankfulness to the fans who have supported his films for the past 50 years. He said, “Thanks to the fans we were able to do the work that we did.”\n\nUnfortunately an interview with a di­rector/ producer of this magnitude and knowledge cannot be adequately captured in mere words from a quick question and answer interview, even in the Queens Gazette interviewing a Queens director right here in Long Island City-Astoria. But suffice it to say that his films do speak for themselves and clearly are the voice of what Lloyd Kaufman is all about and they capture his insight, intense sense of humor, knowledge, and general char­acter. Thank you Mr. Kaufman.\n\nLloyd Kaufman was involved with the Stallone scene in Rocky on the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and was the lo­cation scout for 2001 Odyssey disco in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn for John Travolta’s fa­mous dance scenes in Saturday Night Fever."
