But there’s more in store as we roll into the Autumn months…\n\nShivers Film Society is partnering with Scalarama in the UK (sponsored by the BFI) to bring a little John Waters love to the big screen. This September, the BFI and Scalarama are launching a huge John Waters 50th filmmaking anniversary retrospective. Yes, the mad genius has been making films for fifty years now! As part of this celebration, the Shivers Film Society will be presenting a Scalarama screening of John Water’s Cecil B. Demented double-billed with Troma’s Terror Firmer (directed by Lloyd Kaufman) in a night celebrating anarchy in filmmaking! Sunday, September 13th, 7:00 pm at the Norm Theatre (UBC).\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1668979923335997/\n\nALL ADMISSIONS BY DONATION!"
