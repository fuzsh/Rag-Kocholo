        "text": "Thanks to Christopher Schobert for the great article! Originally posted at https://www.buffalospree.com/arts_entertainment/film/nickel-city-tinseltown/article_be02d686-fa7a-11ed-9b64-af21a9d0b214.html\n\nNICKEL CITY TINSELTOWN\n\nRochester filmmakers turn the camera on Buffalo\n\nby Christopher Schobert, Jun 1, 2023\n\nThe history of filmmaking in Buffalo is as diverse, original, and ambitious as the filmmakers themselves. And with recent large-scale Hollywood productions and new soundstages, the timing could not be better for a documentary exploring that history. Enter Adrian Esposito and Curt Markham, two filmmakers from Rochester who are putting the finishing touches on Nickel City Tinseltown: The History of Buffalo Filmmaking.\n\nTinseltown is the eleventh film for Esposito, who says filmmaking has been at the core of his life since childhood. He was born with Asperger’s Syndrome, which affected his ability to learn. “However, my love for films and dream of becoming a filmmaker encouraged me to learn how to read and write,” he explains. “Eventually, with computer innovations, I was able to write scripts and make films myself.” (Learn more about Esposito’s work at espocinema.com.) Meanwhile, Markham’s experience includes working on the TV crew for a local PBS station, a job at Xerox videotaping usability tests of products in development, and a role developing online learning materials. Through it all, he continues to develop movie projects like Nickel City Tinseltown, which the duo hopes to finish by year’s end.\n\nHere, Esposito and Markham reflect on their documentary and offer some teasers for what audiences can expect when they see Nickel City.\n\nChoosing Buffalo as a focus\n\nEsposito: Buffalo has a very active artist and independent filmmaking community. While making my other films, some of which were documentaries, I met and interviewed many Buffalo-based filmmakers. I was impressed by their talent and artistic tenacity. I also became friends with some, so I felt comfortable asking them to talk about their filmmaking careers and the Buffalo filmmaking scene in general. I started with people I knew but also did research and contacted filmmakers I did not know.\n\nMarkham: I heard about the Buffalo Movie & Video Makers club in the mid to late 2000s and began traveling to their meetings because I wanted to expand my creative circle beyond Rochester. That introduced me to the Buffalo filmmaking scene at a time when more and more people were starting to make their own movies in the area. Adrian and I have been going to film events in Buffalo for years now—Buffalo Movie & Video Makers meetings, the annual Buffalo Dreams Fantastic Film Festival, and local premieres of Buffalo-made independent films. So, a lot of the interview subjects in this documentary were people we knew socially.\n\nUnexpected discoveries and insights\n\nEsposito: I did not know much about the interesting history of the early years of filmmaking in Buffalo, which was described to us by filmmaker Gregory Lamberson [director of films like Widow’s Point and Guns of Eden]. Greg is one of the most prolific independent filmmakers in Buffalo, and we interviewed many of the actors in his films. I found out from filmmaker Rhonda Parker that Jack Champion, who was in her film Message in a Bottle, is now in the Avatar sequels. Adam Steigert also has a successful career as a filmmaker in the Buffalo area; Sam Qualiana is a rising star filmmaker and has been in Greg Lamberson’s past films and has also worked behind the scenes in many local films. I also enjoyed interviewing Tim Clark from the Buffalo Niagara Film Commission. He is an outstanding film commissioner who wants to help all filmmakers, including the independents and even students.\n\nMarkham: I didn’t know much about the history of Buffalo filmmaking prior to the 2000s. It was interesting to hear about older Hollywood films that were at least partly filmed in this area. We also talked to out-of-town filmmakers and actors who have made films in Buffalo—Lloyd Kaufman of Troma fame; actress Debbie Rochon, who also directed Model Hunger; and veteran horror actress Lynn Lowry.\n\nPicking personal Buffalo-shot favorites\n\nEsposito: I would say my favorite is Troma’s Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead, because that is what started the Buffalo renaissance in filmmaking. Also, Greg Lamberson’s Killer Rack and 2022’s Guns of Eden, as well as Adam Steigert’s S.T.A.R.\n\nMarkham: I’m also a fan of S.T.A.R., which is an unusual sci-fi action comedy about an alien—played by a puppet—who arrives on present-day Earth and is being pursued by space villains. Steigert also made a film called A Grim Becoming, which I liked a lot. I also liked Lloyd Kaufman’s Poultrygeist and Sam Qualiana’s Post-Apocalyptic Commando Shark, and not just because I have small non-speaking roles in both.\n\nComparing Rochester’s filmmaking history with Buffalo’s\n\nMarkham: The independent features made in Rochester have been artfully shot dramas or comedy-dramas of the kind that you expect to succeed at Sundance. Historically, it seems like there has been more pursuit of prestige. Buffalo filmmakers seem to have more fully embraced the possibilities of genre cinema and don’t let lack of budget prevent them from telling their stories. As a result, the Buffalo film scene has been more prolific, and more of its filmmakers have found an audience.\n\nThoughts on the future of filmmaking in Buffalo\n\nEsposito: Local actor Richard Satterwhite said to us that Buffalo is becoming the “Hollywood of the east!” Tim Clark is very active and has gone to great lengths to support independent filmmaking in Buffalo. The city now has two major sound stages that are ready for Hollywood-type film productions, but they are also available to independent filmmakers.\n\nMarkham: As long as there are people who have a passion for filmmaking, and the drive to organize actors and locations, we’ll continue to see more local work.\n\nROCHESTER, NY, JANUARY 6, 2023 — Rochester filmmaker Adrian Esposito, who himself has autism, has launched a fundraising campaign for SPECIAL NEEDS REVOLT, an action comedy film to feature characters with developmental disabilities fighting for their rights in a dystopian society. This is Esposito’s third narrative feature, all of which have included actors and characters with disabilities. Esposito, under his production banner Espocinema, has also directed and edited numerous documentaries in social topics and independent filmmaking. His films such as CLOWNS IN THE WOODS, BURY MY HEART WITH TONAWANDA, GREETINGS FROM TROMAVILLE, and DIFFABILITY HOLLYWOOD have played in festivals around the world and have been distributed on disc and to streaming services like Prime Video and iTunes.\n\nSPECIAL NEEDS REVOLT is an action comedy set in a future dystopia, where a tyrannical regime has put people with disabilities into institutions. The main character is Billy Bates, a young man with Down syndrome, who joins a rebellion against America’s cruel dictator. The film addresses issues that are very much on the minds of many developmentally disabled adults — the desire to be portrayed as functional adults, with the full range of adult emotions and desires. It is also a very incisive, funny political comedy, full of exciting and visceral action.\n\nSPECIAL NEEDS REVOLT is assembling a cast of talented actors. In the film’s lead is Nolan Tierce, one of the stars of Espocinema’s previous film, CLOWNS IN THE WOODS. Arlowe Price, last seen as a demented clown in CLOWNS IN THE WOODS, will be playing Manatee Lover, a rebel with a fascination for aquatic mammals. Cult film favorite Bill Weeden (SGT. KABUKIMAN, N.Y.P.D.) will be playing President Kruger, the narcissist dictator who has put those with disabilities into institutions and is determined to “make America straight again.” The production also has letters of intent from Lynn Lowry (THE CRAZIES, SHIVERS, CAT PEOPLE), Mark Torgl (THE TOXIC AVENGER), and Lloyd Kaufman of Troma Entertainment to appear in supporting roles.\n\nThe writers are Adrian Esposito (Clowns in the Woods, Bury My Heart with Tonawanda), Bill Weeden (the award-winning musical Move It and It’s Yours) and Curt Markham (Clowns in the Woods, Saberfrog, Ragdoll Assassin). Also behind the camera is Eric Fox (SyFy channel’s Face-Off) who will be involved in special make-up effects. Filmmaker Greg Lamberson (Slime City, Killer Rack, Johnny Gruesome, Widow’s Point, Guns of Eden) will serve as a film consultant.\n\nEsposito is a spokesperson for self-advocates, helping the world accept people with disabilities as capable and thus seeing their disabilities as “diffabilities.” The topic of disability representation is close to Esposito’s heart, since he has autism. His life experiences bring a unique perspective to his films that resonate with many people facing similar challenges in life. Esposito feels that his autism works well with his filmmaking. “People with this disorder tend to hyper focus on an area of interest, my interest area has always been movies,” he says.\n\nContributors to the crowdfunding campaign are eligible to receive roles as featured extras in the film, videos, posters and even producer credits.
