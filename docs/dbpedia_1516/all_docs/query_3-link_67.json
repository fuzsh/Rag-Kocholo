        "text": "Maniac Nurses Find Ecstasy! Pterodactyl Woman From Beverly Hills! Killer Condoms! Tabloid headlines from Hollywood? No. Dispatches from the film catalogue of Troma Entertainment.\n\nThis is the studio that melds the mundane with the diabolic (Redneck Zombies), embraces cultural difference (Sgt. Kabukiman, NYPD), makes urgent political statements (Surf Nazis Must Die!) and leaves no area unexplored (erm, Buttcrack).\n\n‘Movies of the Future’ boasts Troma’s motto and, on this evidence, mankind’s destiny looks good. If a little demented.\n\nFormed in 1974 by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz, Troma has become synonymous with camp violence, ludicrous gore and big breasts.\n\nWriting, producing and directing many of their own features, Herz and Kaufman are like a radioactive, gestalt Russ Meyer, sharing the same desire to satirise the appetites of small-town America.\n\nIf Meyer’s films are full of nymphomaniac excess, Troma’s bristle with orgiastic hypermania, no act too outré to warrant glorious screen-time.\n\nThe attitude of Troma Entertainment can also be compared to that of Roger Corman, the independent maverick who blended a painterly sensibility with lurid decadence in his edgy adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe, and proved that stylish atmospherics could be achieved with cheap cobwebs and cut-price castles.\n\nTroma followed Corman’s model of complete autonomy, realising that any alignment with the large studios would compromise their schlock integrity.\n\nBoth outfits have also provided an alternative route of distribution for non-mainstream films (only around ten percent of Troma films bear the in-house stamp of Kaufman and co.), and are notoriously economical with budgets, re-using sets and props until that frugality becomes a trademark. As surely as Corman dungeons provoke déja-vu time and again, the Troma Penis Monster is regularly re-aroused for an eye-watering cameo.\n\nEqually important is a commitment to nurturing new talent, Corman having launched the careers of such luminaries as Martin Scorsese and Jack Nicholson, and Troma releasing the early films of South Park’s Trey Parker (Cannibal: The Musical) and Billy Bob Thornton (Chopper Chicks In Zombietown).\n\nThe studio first started producing a slew of steamy sex comedies in the mid-70s that prefigured such mainstream affairs as Porky’s and National Lampoon’s Animal House.\n\nWhat united these films other than breasts, blondes and bimbos was an emphatic use of punctuation: Stuck On You!, Waitress!, The First Turn-On! In your face and full of rousing promise, Troma set their ethos early on.\n\nAfter their preliminary combination of slap ‘n’ tickle slapstick, Troma began to add a bit of sadism and satire to the mix with 1984’s The Toxic Avenger, which would become their biggest success.\n\nIt is a cautionary tale about a nerdy health club mop boy called Melvin who is thrown into a vat of nuclear waste by a bunch of snorting bullies. He transforms into the eponymous superhero, ready to wreak revenge on the huge corporations laying waste to the planet.\n\nKaufman, the public face of Troma, said that he got the idea for the nativity of ‘Toxie’ after camping with his wife and seeing the amount of litter surrounding them, mostly cartons displaying a McDonald’s logo.\n\nIronically, as the countryside was being defiled, America was entering its phase of protein shakes, organic diets and body-building gym routines. It is Troma’s barbed attack on this hypocrisy that gives the film such lasting resonance. (That and the head being squished on a bench press.)\n\nSpawning three sequels, an animated television series, comic books, a novel and even a recent stage musical, Troma has become ‘The House That Toxie Built.’ And if their Tromasterpiece has not quite led the studio to global domination, it has, in the words of Kaufman, brought them closer to “world auto-erotic asphyxiation.”\n\nTo further their ‘pleasurable stranglehold’ on the world of independent cinema, Troma ramped up their acquisitions library in the late-80s now using alliteration as their rhetorical device of choice, Ferocious Female Freedom Fighters providing a particularly tongue-twisting taste.\n\nCombined with a creative period that saw them produce the Class Of Nuke ‘Em High trilogy and Troma’s War (Reaganism in the satirical crosshair this time), the future looked truly Tromatic, and Herz retired from the director’s chair to concentrate on the business side of things.\n\nAtrocious punning became the theme at the naming ceremonies for the freak offspring that Troma delivered in the 90s. Tromeo and Juliet was birthed in 1996, featuring the novelty of Motörhead’s Lemmy reciting pentametric verse in a stewed Stoke accent.\n\nKaufman followed that with 1999’s Terror Firmer, a slasher film that takes place on the set of a Troma gorefest inspired by his own movie-making handbook. Having explored classical drama, Troma were now grooving with the post-modernists.\n\nKaufman’s latest is a merciless lampoon of the fast-food industry Poultrygeist: Night Of The Chicken Dead, a feather-brained splatter-comedy that might well be Troma’s defining statement of – ahem – fowl mayhem.\n\nSadly, the film has only received a limited release in the US and is struggling to get shown elsewhere. Kaufman blames “economic blacklisting” from Hollywood as the root cause.\n\nAs the major studios control the distribution networks, he states that the current playing field is “greased like a stripper’s pole” with the independents on a continual slide.\n\nUntil that field is levelled out, he confesses that the future is “dismal” for his studio.\n\nOf course Tinseltown is always happy to appropriate Troma’s formula (the Wayans Brothers owe a colossal debt with the Scary Movie series) and steal its thunder- Kaufman brought the first Japanese animation to the States, Hayao Miyazaki’s My Neighbour Totoro, which was a roaring success.\n\nThe Disney flag is now firmly stuck in Studio Ghibli with Pixar’s John Lasseter hailed as the conquering hero.\n\nBut Kaufman is still committed to providing a defiant alternative to the mainstream.\n\nThis January saw the tenth anniversary of Tromadance, the completely free festival of low-budget cinema.\n\nRunning concurrently with Sundance, the branded celebration of American ‘indie’ film that regularly premieres work from such struggling artists as Steven Spielberg and Sean Penn, Tromadance aims to reclaim the word ‘independent’ from the big studio magnates.\n\nThe event, like the studio itself, continues its mission with the support of a loyal militia of fans. Troma is both for the people and of the people.\n\nWith vociferous encouragement, one can only hope that Troma boldly persists to make ‘movies of the future’.\n\nFilms that reek of a unique formula of toxic glop, bodily goo and pneumatic girls that, in the words of Kaufman, waft “a genuine emotion unlike the 200 million dollar baby food movies” over our cultural landscape.\n\nThe unmistakeable aroma du Troma."
