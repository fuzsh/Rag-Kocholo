        "text": "Troma has a plan to give the biggest film festival in the world a huge middle finger and you can be a part of it. We're proud to exclusively announce that the independent film studio, which has been in business for 40 years, is going to make a brand new documentary called Occupy Cannes. Filming will take place at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival centering on the studio's latest production, Return to Nuke 'Em High.\n\nTroma CEO Lloyd Kaufman and the team will take the Nuke 'Em High sequel there, premiere it and along the way film the real side of Cannes, an international film festival they believe has gotten away from the true spirit of the movies. Occupy Cannes aims to be a 21st century David vs. Goliath story with Troma taking on the media conglomerates that control not only the film industry, but everything else, very much in the vein of their 2002 documentary, All the Love You Cannes.\n\nThat's where you come in. With Troma being such an independent film studio, this project needs help from fans across the world. They've just started an IndieGoGo Page where you can contribute and help Troma go to Cannes and give them a swift kick in the balls.\n\nAfter the jump, check out the Occupy Cannes pitch video, read more about the project, and find out what prizes are available to those who contribute.\n\nHere's the Occupy Cannes pitch video from the IndieGoGo Page that just launched this morning.\n\nAnd here's A LOT more information on the project, which simply sounds like a whole lot of fun and totally worth of your support. How can you go wrong with Troma vs. Cannes?\n\nWill Troma make international sales on Return to Nuke 'Em High? Will Lloyd Kaufman and the Troma Team be able to compete with the mega-conglomerates and their vassals? Can idealistic, independent thought survive in a world dominated by Burger King action figures? The only way to find out is to donate today in order to show the big movie world and the mainstream movie industry that the true independent spirit is still alive!\n\n$1- A big thank you and a curtsy for supporting the world of independent art and commerce!
