        "text": "Q: What jobs are available at Troma and how do I get one?\n\nA: We post job openings on our Work in Tromaville Page. Should you find a position you feel is suitable for your talents, you should send a cover letter and your resume to:\n\nTROMA ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\n\n36-40 11th Street\n\nLIC, NY 11106\n\nor FAX to: (718) 391-0255\n\nUnpaid Enterprise Observer/Volunteer positions are almost always available at Troma. Contact our Enterprise Observer/Volunteer department and view our Enterprise Observer/Volunteer page to answer more of your questions if you are interested in being an observer/volunteer.\n\nQ: How old do I have to be in order to work for Troma?\n\nA: Unfortunately, due to the repressive Puritanical society in which we live, you must be 18 years old to work for us. Please keep us in mind and contact us when you are old enough to be drafted into an immoral war, vote the bastards who oppress us out of office, and legally enjoy Troma.\n\nQ: “How can I be in a Troma movie?”\n\nA: Troma constantly shoots introductions and other materials for our DVD’s. If you are an actor or actresses in the New York City area, you can always send your cover letter, resume, head and body shots to:\n\nTROMA ENTERTAINMENT, INC..\n\nAttn: Casting Department\n\n36-40 11th Street\n\nLIC, NY 11106\n\nQ: “Does Troma hire Enterprise Observer/Volunteers?”\n\nA: Yes, we do. We frequently hire Enterprise Observer/Volunteers who work in an unpaid position. Many schools will give credit for such positions. You must first check with your school to see if such an arrangnment is available to you. If so please send your resume to the address above.\n\nQ: “I have a band and we would like to know if Troma could use our music for a movie?”\n\nA: If you have original music that you would like to submit to Troma send a CD to:\n\nTROMA ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\n\nAttn: Soundtrack Music\n\n36-40 11th Street\n\nLIC, NY 11106\n\nBack to top\n\nQ: “How do I get my local movie theater to show a Troma movie?\n\nA: Getting our movies on to the screens across the nation will have to be a joint effort. What we suggest you do is this; you and your friends start calling art house cinemas and ask if they could show a Troma movie. Mention the website if they need more information about the movies. If they get enough calls they are going to realize that Troma movies are something people are willing to pay money to see. Most importantly, do not tell them you are calling on behalf of Troma, because in reality, you’re not. You are calling as fans who are genuinely interested in seeing this picture. After all, that is the truth. Drop the hint. Plant the seed. After you guys bombard them with a few calls, send us an e-mail and let us know how it went. This method has worked before and when one thinks of it, the truest form of independent film is all about, people who love to make movies for people who love to watch movies with out having to bother with the big global conglomerates just to get it in a projector\n\nsomeplace.\n\nBack to top\n\nQ: How do I get Lloyd Kaufman to visit my town so I can shake the hand of the man who put the fun in dysfunctional?\n\nA: One would think being President and Founder of a movie studio means long days sitting behind a desk, wheeling and dealing on the phone, keeping the pillows on the casting couch fluffed all the while being served by a gaggle of yes men. Well, in truth, it is that, yet somehow Troma President Lloyd Kaufman finds time to hit the road in order to promote his book “All I Need to Know About Filmmaking I Learned From the Toxic Avenger”, “Direct Your Own Damn Movie”, “Produce Your Own Damn Movie”. One should check Where’s Lloydo to see if and when he will be making a stop near you. If there is a theater, book store, video store, college or women’s penitentiary that you think would welcome a visit from Lloyd, Toxie, Sgt Kabukiman, and the rest of the Wonderful World of Troma characters, you should do the same thing as when trying to get a theater to show a Troma movie. Contact the venue, convince them that Lloyd is one of pop cultures must beloved icons (he is, you know) and his presence will certainly attract a decent number of fans who are desperately searching for ways to spend money.\n\nBack to top\n\nQ: How do I get my local video store to carry Troma movies?\n\nA: Getting you local video rental outfit to carry Troma movies is very much like getting your local theater to show our films. Contact the store, tell them about our website if they more information. Tell them what fine quality Troma movies are and how they are popular the world over. If the stores proprietor are wise, they will create a Troma section.\n\nRelease Dates for Our DVD\n\nQ: When will (enter movie title here) be released on video/DVD?\n\nA: All new releases for DVD are featured in the New Release section of the Troma Studio Store and the Movies section of Troma.com. In some cases advance notice by as much as month or more will be given to some titles. In many cases one could order a movie before it is released to ensure that they will be the first on the block to be the proud owner of the latest Troma presentation.\n\nBack to top\n\nFor a more comprehensive index of inquiries, please see the Official TromaDirect FAQ’s.\n\nQ: “How do I place an order at TromaDirect?”\n\nPlacing an order at TromaDirect is very easy.

However, from time to time, mistakes can be made. If for whatever reason there is a problem with an order you placed, e-mail our Customer Service Department. Include in your letter the question along with your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address as you entered them on your order. We also must know the exact date of your original order. Saying you placed the order “sometime in the end of May” will not help because we get thousands of e-mail’s, including orders, every week.\n\nQ: I read on another website there was a sale on TromaDirect, but when I went to order the movies they were priced more than what I was told.\n\nA: Many websites that promote sales on the web announce our sales. They post once but do not always take down the announcement. It is always a good idea to double check the prices before you order.\n\nQ: How soon after placing an order can I cancel it?\n\nA: The majority of our orders ship the next business day after we receive payment. If for whatever reason you wish to cancel your order, you must do so immediately. We do not accept returned packages and/or merchandise.\n\nQ: I ordered some movies from TromaDirect and now I got a letter from our customs office that there is no invoice in the package and I need one in order to get my package.\n\nA: This is a common problem for our customers who live overseas, especially in Europe. What we suggest doing is when you fill out the order form, print it out. This can serve as your invoice.\n\nQ: I don’t own a credit card. Can I order with check or money order?\n\nA: TromaDirect accepts PayPal only. We DO NOT accept credit cards directly, checks or money orders.\n\nBack to top"
