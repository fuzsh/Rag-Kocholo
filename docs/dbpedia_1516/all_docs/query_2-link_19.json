        "text": "A couple of weekends ago, I was in Orlando, Fla., covering MegaCon, a massive yearly comic convention. The coverage was for a comic book Web site, and part of my live blogging duties included the each day's convention after-party.\n\nAfter skipping a couple of parties, I finally ventured out for a party thrown by the folks from Troma Entertainment. Troma and its Yale-graduate founder, Lloyd Kaufman, have been responsible for producing and/or distributing the following flicks: The Toxic Avenger, Bloodsucking Freaks, Class of Nuke 'Em High and Surf Nazis Must Die!, among other examples of fine cinema.\n\nThe Troma debauchery was to take place at a bar off the beaten path, out in suburbia, called Duke's. I figured a Troma party would require a dive bar, especially since they were showing clips from their latest shock opus: Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead.\n\nI'd heard Duke's was a dive bar; in actuality, it was far from it. Of course, that's from my perspective. So as I sat at the Duke's bar, liberally pulling from a bucket of Miller Lites, wondering what makes a good dive bar.\n\nHere in Wilmington, we've got some good ones. I feel right at home at a dive: unassuming, unpretentious, unrefined - all the uns, just like me. I dropped by some of our more well-known dives to see if the staff could explain what makes a dive a real pit.\n\nKristy Germany has been tending bar at the 42nd Street Tavern (formerly Reggie's; 1415 42nd St., 799-6465) for roughly three years. She knows her clientele quite well because they're regulars; on a recent karaoke Thursday (that's a dive staple), she knew them all. This bar is dive heaven: buckling ceiling tiles, bingo hall-quality chairs, wood paneling, bare concrete flooring, half-illuminated neon brand signs.\n\n\"Is it a dive bar? Absolutely,\" Germany said. \"Why? The setup. It's a hole in the wall with a wide variety of people. Neighborhood people.\"\n\nShe also mentioned the following dive characteristics: not very clean, smoky and dirty rock shows.\n\n\"People are comfortable here,\" Germany added after applying temporary tattoos to some customer foreheads and arms. \"You don't have to be all dressed up in here.\"\n\nAnd there's a hot dog stand right out the front door.\n\nOur best-known local dive has to be the Barbary Coast (116 S. Front St., 762-8996), where the neon sign out front reads only \"AST.\" A prototypical dive: it's plainly a beer bar; it's dark, dank and musty; a surly reputation; exposed, floppy A/C ducts.\n\nA regular patron who asked to remain anonymous may have put it best: \"It's the same every night. I don't have to feel anxious like I would in other bars about talking to hot chicks. There are no hot chicks here.\" Rather than slight lovely ladies who may frequent the \"AST,\" the point here is that you don't go to a good dive to be seen, you go to drink and retain a low profile. After the line, this patron challenged another with some old-fashioned arm wrestling.\n\nMelissa Scully, a Barbary Coast bartender on-and-off for six years (dives know how to retain staff!), sees her dive's attractiveness simply: \"The people and the cheap prices. That's all I can think of. Doctors, lawyers, bikers: they'll all get along in here.\"\n\nWhile Scully says that Saturdays at Barbary Coast can \"get a little hairy\" in terms of rowdiness, for the most part it's a relaxed, inconspicuous environment. You can go there, drink a beer, watch sports on a Vizio plasma widescreen (surely a dive bar anomaly) and go completely unnoticed by anybody other than the folks you'd see there week in, week out.\n\nWhat separates a dive bar from the rest? The regulars, the environment and the attitude. When asked if his joint could be classified as a dive, Jeff Reardon bartender at Blue Post (15 S. Water St., 343-1141), emphatically denied that label: \"It's a neighborhood bar. We've got regulars, but also a lot of random people in here.\"\n\nSo it goes: dive bar, then neighborhood bar - then what?\n\n\"Dance party USA,\" Reardon said, pointing a finger toward North Front Street.\n\nCurrents: 343-2343\n\nBehindBars.Currents@gmail.com"
