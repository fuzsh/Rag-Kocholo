        "text": "Foundation\n\n1974\n\nLocation\n\nNew York, U.S.\n\nKey People\n\nLloyd Kaufman\n\nMichael Herz\n\nType\n\nPrivate\n\nCompany Slogan\n\n30 Years of Reel Independence\n\nTroma Entertainment is an American independent film production and distribution company founded by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz in 1974.[1]\n\nThe company produces low-budget independent movies that play on 1950s horror with elements of farce. Many Troma films contain social commentary. In 2012, the company officially released some of their films on YouTube. [2]\n\nCompany information[]\n\nTroma films are B-movies known for their surrealistic or automatistic nature, along with their use of shocking imagery; some would categorize them as \"shock exploitation films\". They typically contain overt sexuality, nudity, and intentionally sadistic, gory, and blatant graphic violence, so much that the term \"Troma film\" has become synonymous with these characteristics. Troma's slogan is \"Movies of the Future\". Troma reuses the same props, actors, and scenes repeatedly, sometimes to save money. At a certain point, however, this became another hallmark of Troma. Examples include a severed leg, a penis monster, and the flipping and exploding car filmed for the movie Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D., which is used in place of any other car that needs to crash and explode.\n\nTroma produced or acquired early films featuring several rising talents, such as Carmen Electra (The Chosen One), Billy Bob Thorton (Chopper Chicks in Zombietown), Vanna White (Graduation Day), Kevin Costner (Sizzle Beach, U.S.A.), [Wikipedia:[J. J. Abrams|J. J. Abrams]] (Nightbeast), Samuel L. Jackson (Def by Temptation), Marisa Tomei (The Toxic Avenger), Vincent D'Onofrio (The First Turn-On!), David Boreanaz (Macabre Pair of Shorts), Paul Sorvino (Cry Uncle!), James Gunn (Tromeo and Juliet), Trey Parker and Matt Stone (Cannibal! The Musical), before they were discovered. Another Academy Award winning director, Oliver Stone, made his debut as an actor in The Battle of Love's Return.\n\nTheir latest production, Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead, was released in late 2006.[3]\n\nHistory of Troma Studios[]\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Kaufman and Herz began producing, directing, and distributing raunchy sex comedies such as The First Turn-On! and Squeeze Play!. Troma provided production support for Louis Malle's My Dinner With Andre, for which Kaufman served as a production manager.[4][5][6]\n\nIn 1985, Troma had a hit with the violent dark comedy superhero film The Toxic Avenger. The film went on to become Troma's most popular, spawning sequels and an animated television program. However, following the financial demise of the company Troma itself, the sequels to the film were box office bombs, and the cartoon adaptation quickly ended. The The Toxic Avenger character is now Troma's official mascot.\n\nKaufman's follow-up film to The Toxic Avenger was Class of Nuke 'Em High, co-directed with Richard W. Haines. The film was a hit nearly as successful, though it inspired two unsuccessful sequels, both following the financial demise of Troma. At one time, it was the highest-selling VHS release for Troma.\n\nThe Toxic Avenger was turned into a musical which debuted at the George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick, New Jersey and opened in New York in the fall of 2008. The Toxic Avenger Musical book by Joe DiPietro, the author of the long-running I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change and All Shook Up, was released the same year. The music is by David Bryan, keyboardist of the rock band Bon Jovi.[7]\n\nSoon after Class of Nuke 'em High was completed and distributed, Kaufman directed Troma's War. Intended as a criticism of what it saw as Ronald Reagan's attempt to glamorize war, the story concerns a group of everyday people who crash land on a remote island, only to find it populated by an isolationist militia that intends to overthrow the US government. Troma's War was a box office bomb. In the aftermath of the film's poor financial performance, Troma experienced financial hardship, jettisoning the company from the Hollywood mainstream. In the years that followed the financial failure of their films, Troma tried to reestablish itself as a smaller, independent film company, mostly out of financial necessity. Despite unsuccessful attempts to assert itself in the mainstream Hollywood community, notably with two direct sequels to The Toxic Avenger, and another stab at the superhero genre Sgt. Kabukiman, NYPD, Troma was unable to reenter the mainstream film market.\n\nToday, the majority of Troma films are viewed for the first time on VHS or DVD, with some theatrical releases for their films in smaller art houses, college campuses, and independent cinemas.\n\nIn August 2012, Troma released \"over 100\" of its back catalog films on YouTube, many for free, some for 48-hour paid viewing.[8]\n\nWork since 1995[]\n\nFrom 1995 to 2000, Kaufman directed three independent films distributed in limited theatrical releases: Tromeo and Juliet, a loose parody of Shakespeare's play; Terror Firmer, a slasher film loosely based on Kaufman's book All I Need to Know about Filmmaking I Learned from the Toxic Avenger, and an independent film sequel to The Toxic Avenger trilogy titled Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV.\n\nTroma's financial hardship worsened after the botched funding of a low-budget video feature titled Tales from the Crapper, which cost $250,000 despite most of the footage being completely unusable.Script error: No such module \"Unsubst\". India Allen, one of the producers, backed out of the film halfway through, and sued Troma, citing breach of contract, slander, sexual harassment, trade slander, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Kaufman supervised a reshoot in an attempt to salvage the film, dividing the footage into two parts and recasting the film as a double feature. Tales from the Crapper was released on DVD in September 2004.\n\nCurrently, Troma produces and acquires independent films, despite financial hardships and limitations. Troma Films has distributed many films from third parties including Trey Parker's Cannibal! The Musical. Lloyd encourages independent filmmaking, making cameo appearances in many low-budget horror films, occasionally without fee. Among his more recent appearances is in former collaborator James Gunn's directing debut, Slither.\n\nKaufman's film, Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead was released in 2006 in theaters and 2008 on DVD.[3]\n\nDuring the winter of 2010/2011, Troma produced a feature length film Father's Day, which Kaufman calls \"a response film to Mother's Day\".[9] The film was written and directed by the Canadian filmmaking team Astron-6, debuting October 21, 2011, at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival where it took home the top prize of BEST FILM, as well as five other awards.[10] In 2012 Father's Day was featured on the cover of Rue Morgue magazine[11] and won BEST FEATURE FILM, BEST DIRECTOR, BEST MALE PERFORMANCE, and BEST SPECIAL EFFECTS at The Fantastic Planet/A Night of Horror International film festival.[12] This is a rare and impressive feat for a film that cost only ten thousand dollars to make.[13] On October 31, 2012, Father's Day was refused classification in Australia,[14] which makes it effectively illegal to sell or exhibit the film.[15]\n\nTroma gets a Hollywood makeover[]\n\nOn April 7, 2010, Kaufman confirmed that a PG-13 remake of The Toxic Avenger was happening and will be produced by Akiva Goldsman. It actually is not the first attempt at a general audience-friendly version of the franchise, as Make Your Own Damn Movie! noted a prior deal with New Line in the early 90s for a live-action take on the Toxic Crusaders. Another 1980s Troma classic, Mother's Day will also receive a remake and will be directed by Darren Lynn Bousman and produced by Brett Ratner. Kaufman also said that he is also negotiating a deal for remakes of Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead and Class of Nuke 'Em High.[16]\n\nOther work[]\n\nTroma holds the annual Tromadance Festival in Park City, Utah at the same time as the Sundance Festival to accentuate their true independence from the mainstream. The festival screens submitted movies from independent filmmakers from around the world, the best of which are usually released on DVD by Troma or compiled in the Best of Tromadance series. In parallel, Troma acts as adviser to aspiring filmmakers with Kaufman teaching classes, contributing cameos and often releasing the finished films on DVD. 2009 marked the last time Tromadance was held in Utah; the festival was subsequently relocated to Asbury Park, New Jersey. Additionally, Tromadance adjusted its annual schedule to take place in April rather than in January as in previous years.\n\nKaufman has also had some success with several non-fiction books and a novelization of The Toxic Avenger. Released in 1998, All I Need to Know about Filmmaking I Learned from the Toxic Avenger is an autobiography of sorts co-written with James Gunn. This book was significant to those interested in Troma and Kaufman because it signified the first time a book had chronicled the history of the company, its films and its iconic figurehead. Kaufman continued to draw on his experiences as Troma chief in the \"how-to\" filmmaking books Make Your Own Damn Movie!, Direct Your Own Damn Movie!, Produce Your Own Damn Movie! and Sell Your Own Damn Movie!. A DVD box set has been released to coincide with release of each of the three books. In the video series, Kaufman interviews famous and infamous filmmakers about various filmmaking subjects.\n\nIn 2006 a novelization of The Toxic Avenger was released. It was co-written by Kaufman and long time Troma employee Adam Jahnke.\n\nFilms distributed by Troma[]\n\nAlso see List of Troma Team Video Titles for a complete list of films distributed by Troma Entertainment.
