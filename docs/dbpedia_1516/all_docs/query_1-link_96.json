        "text": "Brunswick native Jason Yachanin will be forever known to fans of Troma's ultra-cheap cult films as Arbie, slayer of chicken zombies.\n\nYachanin, who grew up in Brunswick, and Troma Entertainment ringmaster Lloyd Kaufman, will introduce \"Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead\" next week at Cleveland Institute of Art Cinematheque.\n\nKaufman will introduce the film Friday, Oct. 3, and Saturday, Oct. 4; Yachanin will be here Saturday only.\n\nThe Cinematheque, usually home for highbrow fare, is stepping on the wild side with this offering.\n\n\"It's a very campy horror comedy, also a musical,\" Yachanin said by phone from New York recently.\n\nYachanin, 27, plays loser-geek Arbie, whose girlfriend Wendy (Kate Graham) goes to college and comes out as a lesbian. Wendy and her girlfriend join a group of ultra-PC activists picketing against a fast-food joint that's built on top of a sacred grave. Arbie, out for revenge against Wendy, gets a job at the restaurant. When angry spirits turn customers into chicken zombies, Arbie and his co-workers have to defend the restaurant and destroy the zombies.\n\nEntertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman calls it \"a soft-core scatological zombie kitsch musical.\" The movie marks Troma's return to the big screen after sending many movies straight to video.\n\nYachanin had never heard of Troma Entertainment -- known for raunchy fare like \"The Toxic Avenger\" series, \"Terror Firmer\" and \"Redneck Zombies\" -- before he saw the audition listing in a New York newspaper. It said Troma was looking for a nerdy-geeky guy.\n\n\"I kinda fit that type,\" he admitted.\n\nThe movie was shot over two months in 2005 in Buffalo, and premiered in May in New York.\n\nThe shoot was like a demented summer camp. One house for the cast and crew. One shower. One rule: Actors got the shower first. Yachanin remembers standing under a freezing shower to wash off fake blood and vomit.\n\n\"That day I was the dirtiest I've ever been,\" he said. \"You're primed for anything after that.\"\n\nTroma founder Lloyd Kaufman directed, co-wrote and acted in \"Poultrygeist.\" Kaufman was nice to the actors but screamed at the crew, Yachanin said. Many were die-hard Troma fans who traveled from Europe and Australia for a chance to be on the receiving end of a Kaufman tirade.\n\nYachanin said he plans to join Kaufman at Cinema Wasteland Movie and Memorabilia Expo, Friday-Sunday, Oct. 3-5 at the Holiday Inn Select, 15471 Royalton Road, Strongsville (www.cinemawasteland.com). Kaufman will be there three days; Yachanin will appear Oct. 4 only.\n\nYachanin graduated from Brunswick High School in 1999. He moved to New York after his 2003 graduation from Baldwin-Wallace College.\n\n\"Poultrygeist\" was Yachanin's first film. Since then, he's done theater and commercials, and appeared on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nThe Troma name may not open doors, but it's definitely an attention-getter on his acting resume.\n\n\"People do know Troma,\" he said."
