        "text": "Ryan Bellgardt has attended the deadCenter Film Festival in many roles over the years: film fan, press member, moviemaker and, this year, icon.\n\n\"It's made me be very retrospective about how this all happened, starting out as a fan — a passholder that's waiting in line to get in to see a Lloyd Kaufman movie — to I think we've had three films in deadCenter. 'Jurassic Games' won a Special Jury Award, and winning this award now, it's surreal,\" Bellgardt said.\n\n\"There's reasons that you make movies, and it's not to win awards. ... But filmmaking is not a glamorous thing. There are moments like this where ... you think, 'Yeah, all the work that I did, these moments make it worth it.\"\n\nThe Edmond native accepted the Oklahoma Film & TV ICON Award June 13 during this year's virtual deadCenter Film Festival, which continues through Sunday at www.deadcenterfilm.org. The state's largest film festival gives its ICON Award annually to people from Oklahoma who have not only achieved personal success but have elevated the perception of Oklahomans in film around the world.\n\nIt's a heady honor for a filmmaker whose first deadCenter memory is attending a midnight screening of Kaufman's 2006 horror-comedy musical \"Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead.\"\n\n\"It was a really raucous crowd for a movie that was just, the best way I can describe that movie was insane. ... I think right then and there I fell in love with the festival experience,\" Bellgardt recalled.\n\n\"Lucas Ross and I were doing the (local TV segment) 'Two Movie Guys' and we were press at deadCenter one year and interviewed a bunch of people. ... Sometime back there I was at somebody's movie — I think it was called 'Ecstasy of Gold'; it was a Western — and I remember the director went up and talked to the audience and was answering questions. And I just thought, 'I just want to do that. I want to be that guy.' So, I just started making movies and eventually got one finished and got into the festival and it was awesome.\"\n\nStudio success\n\nBefore he started making movies, Bellgardt made music and worked in radio with late local legend Danny Williams at KOMA. About a decade ago, he started experimenting with computer animation software.\n\n\"When you open up the 3-D software, it's just blank,\" he said. \"It's just a blank, gray nothing, and I started to realize what can be done in it. ... This is the same piece of software they made Gollum in the 'Lord of the Rings.' I'm like, 'Anything I can dream up or imagine, if I have the knowledge, I can build it.'\"\n\nThe Edmond Memorial High School alumnus is the founding partner and creative director of Boiling Point Media advertising agency. Bellgardt won an Emmy for directing and producing the \"Two Movie Guys Intergalactic Holiday Showdown,\" then launched a film production company within Boiling Point that now employs a full-time CGI animation team.\n\n\"Boiling Point Media has become what we believe is the most successful film studio in the state of Oklahoma,\" said deadCenter Film Executive Director Lance McDaniel.\n\nInternational reach\n\nIn less than 10 years, Bellgardt has directed five feature films: the 2013 sci-fi Civil War adventure \"Army of Frankensteins,\" the 2017 creature feature \"Gremlin,\" the 2018 the prehistoric mashup \"Jurassic Games,\" last year's family-friendly jaunt \"The Adventures of Jurassic Pet\" and this year's teen fantasy \"The Adventures of Rufus the Fantastic Pet.\" He made all of them in his home state, and all of them have earned international distribution.\n\n\"We got a little bit luck with 'Army of Frankensteins' and had the ability to connect up with a sales agent. From that point, I got really interested in the business of all this; it's really a whole other world. But it was really pretty common sense: If you could make a movie that appeals to buyers — and I'm not talking about necessarily a casual viewer; I'm talking about someone who buys your movie to distribute it — and that they think they can go and sell, then you have a much better chance of getting your movie out there,\" he said.\n\n\"That has been such a successful formula for us because we're branching off now to ... meeting different people that are hiring us.\"\n\nBoiling Point is creating the visual effects for two family-friendly movies filming in Oklahoma, creating kangaroos for \"Joey and Ella\" and animating a talking chimpanzee for \"C.I.APE.\"\n\n\"It's a lot of fun. ... As we do it more and more and more, we sort of push the boundaries of what we're capable of doing,\" he said.\n\nFor the first time in many years, Bellgardt isn't sure what he will be directing next.\n\n\"I think that with the experience that I've had now, I'm excited to be able to look forward to being able to be a little bit ... pickier about the things that I would want to dive into. ... It doesn't mean that it's not a cute family movie about a little dinosaur,\" he said.\n\nShortly after releasing his 2019 film, he received a message from the mother of a toddler struggling with a serious illness.\n\n\"She was like, 'Look, he's had \"Jurassic Pet\" on loop since it came out, and he has watched it so much that it's actually given me and my husband the chance to go downstairs and put on a movie and have a date night. So, thank you so much for making that movie.' ... That moment happens, and you're like, 'Well, that makes every single one-star review on IMDB worth it — because you get those, too,\" Bellgardt said.\n\n\"The journey of that guy who just went to deadCenter as a fan and wanted to start making movies to being awarded with something like this and thinking back on how it happened, it's pretty powerful and just really awesome to be honored.\"\n\ndeadCenter 2020 Film ICONs honored\n\nThe deadCenter Film Festival honored June 13 four outstanding Oklahomans with its 2020 Oklahoma Film & TV ICON Award.\n\nThis year's honorees are Edmond filmmaker Ryan Bellgardt, the founding partner and creative director of Boiling Point Media; Oklahoma City native and studio executive Elaine Paul, the chief financial officer and vice president of finance for Amazon Studios; Norman High School and Stanford University graduate Megyn Price, actress in \"Grounded for Life\"; and Lindsay native and journalist Brandy McDonnell, The Oklahoman's longtime arts and entertainment writer.\n\n\"We've tried to include a wide variety of people, and this year, the first person we thought about was Brandy McDonnell,\" said deadCenter Film Executive Director Lance McDaniel. \"Brandy has basically played such a huge role in the growth of not only our festival but of the film industry.\"\n\nKnown by her initials BAM, McDonnell is one of Oklahoma’s most popular entertainment bloggers, most prolific entertainment writers and most awarded film reviewers, winning the regional Great Plains Journalism Award for reviews in both 2017 and 2020, as well as numerous state awards. She also received the 2015 Oklahoma Governor’s Arts Award for Media in the Arts.\n\n\"I am very honored and very grateful and extremely surprised. I never anticipated getting a film award. I'm not a filmmaker, so it's really nice to be sort of welcomed into their tribe and given a place of honor,\" McDonnell said."
