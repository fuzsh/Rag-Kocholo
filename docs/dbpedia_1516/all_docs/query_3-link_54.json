        "text": "LomoAmigo Lloyd Kaufman and Troma Entertainment!\n\n8\n\nLloyd Kaufman, the director of many of Troma’s feature films took around a LC-A+ and a Lomokino with him wherever he went for Occupy Cannes! Come on an adventure with Kaufman and the rest of the Troma Team as they get up close and personal with Toxic Avenger, Sgt. Kabukiman NPYD, mutants, zombies, and so much more!\n\nTell us a little about yourself and the legendary Troma Entertainment.\n\nThe Troma Universe was born in 1974. I have directed many of Troma’s feature films, including the The Toxic Avenger, Class of Nuke ‘Em High, Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD, Tromeo and Juliet, Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead., etc. Over the course of nearly 40 years, Troma’s visionary body of work has had a huge impact on pop culture and mainstream filmmaking. Among today’s luminaries whose early work can be found in Troma’s 800+ film library are Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Jenna Fischer, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Costner, Fergie, Vincent D’Onofrio, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gunn and Eli Roth. I also teach Master Classes at colleges and institutions around the world based on my successful “Make Your Own Damn Movie” book series . Please visit Lloyd Kaufman or Troma for more information.\n\nSo you got to use one of our favorite cameras, the LC-A+. How was your experience shooting? What can you tell us about these images?\n\nThe LC-A+ is now one of my favorite cameras! First of all, the automatic shutter speed is a great feature and the ability to easily shoot multiple exposures make this camera a great one. Having shot all but two of my films on 35mm, there’s something about the aesthetic of film which simply can not be captured with digital cameras or replicated in Photoshop. One look at the photos of the Troma Team at Cannes taken with the Lomo LC-A+ proves that. This camera is also incredibly durable, which was helpful when getting up close and personal with the Toxic Avenger, Sgt. Kabukiman NPYD, mutants, zombies, and people spewing green slime – I am just surprised the subject matter did not cause the lens to break!\n\nI think it’s worth noting that we also shot some Tromatastic short films using the Lomokino while at the Cannes Film Festival and I hope that your readers will check those out.\n\nWe’ve got a tough one for you…What is your favorite horror flick?\n\nI love William Castle’s films… my wedding video is pretty scary too!\n\nDo you approach taking photographs differently then you approach creating moving images?\n\nNo. I have always followed the auteur theory and put my personal creative vision before all technical rules of photography and/or filmmaking. It’s been Troma’s method of creating one of a kind, non-formula films, and my approach to photography is no different.\n\nYou were recently across the pond and attending Cannes. Tell us a little bit about that experience and Occupy Cannes.\n\nTroma was at the Cannes Film Festival for two reasons: first, to premiere the latest Troma Team production “Return to Nuke ’Em High: Volume One” and, second, to Occupy Cannes and fight for the rights of independent artists. I have been attending the Cannes Film Festival since 1971. I had one print of my film “Sugar Cookies” and slept on the beach. You could put leaflets under the windshield wipers of all the cars on the street and walk into any of the hotels without wearing a thousand dollar badge. Today, technology has democratized cinema so that there are now many, many talented young filmmakers who have made wonderful movies.\n\nThe problem is that festivals like Cannes and the distribution machinery have not caught up with the times and are still living in an age of elitism and cartelism. A movie like the Great Gatsby, with millions of dollars in its advertising budget, doesn’t need the exposure from the Cannes Film Festival. Occupy Cannes was organized to bring this to the attention of the world media. Through a series of screenings, informative street theater, and events we were able to communicate our message and the press and people of Cannes responded very well to the message.\n\nFor exclusive photos (including those taken with the Lomo LC-A+) and a list of the media coverage Troma/Occupy Cannes received at the festival, click here!\n\nWhat Lomography camera do you think you’ll want to try next?\n\nI had a Diana back in 1966 when I was in Chad, Africa with the Peace Corps. I have been itching – figuratively, not from sleeping with that goat while in Chad – to use the camera ever since. Thanks to Lomography’s innovative revival of the Diana, I plan to pick one up soon!\n\nAny advice for all those gruesome Lomographers out there?\n\nIf you follow the Shakespearean mantra “to thine own self be true,” you will always, always end up with something interesting, for better or for worse.\n\nSo what is next for Troma Entertainment? Any cool projects in the works?\n\nWell there are a lot of interesting things happening in Tromaville! Our latest film Return to Nuke ‘Em High, which was produced in association with Starz, is slated for release for 2014 and our 40th anniversary is coming up. We are also preparing The Toxic Avenger V: Toxic Twins!\n\nThanks to Llyod Kaufman and the Troma Team for sharing their adventures at Occupy Cannes!"
