        "text": "While it’s not really a sequel, it’s important to start at the beginning and explain the first episode of Addison Binek’s trip into the film business. In this case, you need to at least understand the first episode in order to appreciate the second one.\n\nBinek, inspired by his favorite TV show off all time, “Mystery Science Theater 3000,” created “Tromasterpiece Theatre” and completed a first episode, “The Battle of Love’s Return (1971),” in 2017. As part of the gimmick, Binek works at a movie theater and watches Troma movies with puppet friends Reelie, a talking film reel, and Corny, a box of popcorn.\n\nEnter stage right: Troma Entertainment, a 40-year-old independent New York-based film company that produces low-budget independent films, primarily of the horror genre. Troma has produced, acquired and distributed over 1,000 independent films.\n\nBinek set out to not only get Troma Entertainment’s blessing, but the company’s backing as well.\n\n“I met the president of the company, Lloyd Kaufman, at a horror convention in 2016 and pitched him the idea,” says Binek, 30, who was born and raised in Royal Oak, and now lives in Troy. “He told me they would only release it if they thought it was funny enough. I finished ‘Tromasterpiece Theatre’ and sent it to Troma, and they ended up loving it.”\n\nTroma uploaded the film to its YouTube page, Troma Movies, and their streaming service, Troma Now.” ?Fast forward to present day and Binek finds himself a little reflective but also looking forward – like any good filmmaker does. “The reaction to the first episode has been great,” he says. “I’ve sold almost 300 DVDs in two years.”\n\nBinek says the first episode was a great “learning experience,” and because of that, it made creating the second episode much smoother.\n\n“Episode two was somewhat easier in that I could anticipate how long a certain chunk might take to shoot and edit and maybe try to streamline the process a little bit,” he says. “All together the project took from May 2018 when we started watching ‘Poultrygeist’ repeatedly and writing jokes, to January 2020 when I finally finished it.”\n\nThe biggest challenge of all when it comes to making an independent film is raising money. Binek took a different approach to bankrolling his second episode. He turned to his fans.\n\nBinek admits he was struggling to secure funds for a “Tromasterpiece” sequel and needed money to rent a theater location and purchase additional microphones. He went to Kickstarter and asked for $500.\n\nIt turned out he has a lot more fans and supporters than he imagined. The campaign on Kickstarter lasted 45 days and 199 backers donated over $7,000 for his project. He will use the extra money to help pay for shipping costs and DVD production expenses, among other things.\n\n“I went with Kickstarter because it seemed like the most popular or well-known crowdfunding website,” Binek says. “You create a campaign for your project, whether it be a movie, music album, comic book, etc. and you set an asking price for your project. If the money exceeds your asking price, you create reward tiers for potential backers to receive for their donations.”\n\nIn the case of “Tromasterpiece Theatre” episode 2, $10 got backers a DVD of the finished product, $30 got them a DVD and T-shirt, and $100 got them an executive producer credit in the film and on the Internet Movie Database, IMDb.com.\n\n“Yeah, I was very surprised with how much I made,” Binek says. “I only asked for $500 but I made that in the first two hours of the campaign.”\n\nOne reason it took Binek so long to produce Episode Two was “very tragic to me.”\n\n“The original voice actor of the puppet character Corny, Johnathan Gogoleski, passed away in the fall of 2018,” he says. “He was a great friend of mine for almost 20 years and built the Corny and Reelie puppets from scratch by himself. I was devastated that I lost my good friend and unsure if I could replace him as the character.”\n\nA few weeks after Gogoleski’s passing, Binek flew to New York and had lunch with Kaufman.\n\n“He told me to take the proper time to grieve but to continue working on ‘Tromasterpiece Theatre,'” Binek says. “It was really special to me. So I soldiered on, and created the Kickstarter a few months later to raise funds for production. I ended up asking another longtime friend of mine, Brad LaJoye, to take the reigns as Corny and he did a wonderful job.”\n\nBinek would love to do another film but, “it’s up to Lloyd Kaufman,” he says. “He picks our movies for us. Maybe once he sees what we did with ‘Poultrygeist’ he’ll decide if a third episode is in the cards.”\n\nBinek is keeping busy though. He is working on a feature film with two other friends, a horror slasher comedy called “Psycho Ape!” about a killer gorilla that escapes from the Detroit Zoo. “We’re finishing up the editing right now with possibly a spring/summer release,” he says."
