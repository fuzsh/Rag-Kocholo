On February 23, 2010, Troma Home Entertainment will release Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead on Blu-ray.

When a fast food chicken restaurant is built on the site of an ancient Native American burial ground, the displaced spirits unite with the ghosts of exterminated chickens and transform into Indian chicken zombies seeking revenge! Now, it's up to a dim-witted counter boy, his lesbian ex-girlfriend, and a burqa-wearing fry cook to put an end to the foul-feathered menace once and for all. It will contain bonus materials and extra features, and the Blu-ray will be available for the MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price) of $29.95.

The Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead Blu-ray will feature the following bonus materials:

-- Commentary by director Lloyd Kaufman and writer/editor Gabe Friedman

-- Commentary by stars Jason Yachanin and Kate Graham

-- Introduction by Troma co-founder Michael Herz

-- Interview with Troma star Joe Fleishaker

-- Sexy rooftop re-shoot

-- Explosion effect featurette

-- Ron Jeremy's "alternate happy ending"

-- Troma's first egg-a-morphic widescreen presentation
