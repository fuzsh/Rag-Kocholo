        "text": "Abstract\n\nThis evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme disease was developed by a multidisciplinary panel representing the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). The scope of this guideline includes prevention of Lyme disease, and the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease presenting as erythema migrans, Lyme disease complicated by neurologic, cardiac, and rheumatologic manifestations, Eurasian manifestations of Lyme disease, and Lyme disease complicated by coinfection with other tick-borne pathogens. This guideline does not include comprehensive recommendations for babesiosis and tick-borne rickettsial infections, which are published in separate guidelines. The target audience for this guideline includes primary care physicians and specialists caring for this condition such as infectious diseases specialists, emergency physicians, internists, pediatricians, family physicians, neurologists, rheumatologists, cardiologists and dermatologists in North America.\n\nSummarized below are the 2020 recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme disease. The panel followed a systematic process used in the development of other IDSA, AAN, and ACR clinical practice guidelines, which included a standardized methodology for rating the certainty of the evidence and strength of recommendation using the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) (see Figure 1). A detailed description of background, methods, evidence summary and rationale that support each recommendation, and knowledge gaps can be found online in the full text.\n\nKey words: Lyme, Lyme disease, tick, tick-borne, tick-borne infection, neurology, rheumatology, cargiology, dermatology\n\nRecommendations (Abridged)\n\nI. Which measures should be used to prevent tick bites and tick-borne infections?\n\n(A) Personal Protective Measures\n\nIndividuals at risk of exposure should implement personal protective measures to reduce the risk of tick exposure and infection with tick-borne pathogens (good practice statement).\n\n(B) Repellents to Prevent Tick Bites\n\nFor the prevention of tick bites, we recommend N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), picaridin, ethyl-3-(N-n-butyl-N-acetyl) aminopropionate (IR3535), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), p-methane-3,8-diol (PMD), 2-undecanone, or permethrin (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).\n\n(C) Removal of Attached Ticks\n\nWe recommend promptly removing attached ticks by mechanical means using a clean fine-tipped tweezer (or a comparable device) inserted between the tick body and the skin (good practice statement).\n\nWe recommend against burning an attached tick (with a match or other heat device) or applying noxious chemicals or petroleum products to coax its detachment (good practice statement).\n\nII. Which diagnostic tests should be used following a tick bite?\n\n(A) Diagnostic Tick Testing\n\nWe recommend submitting the removed tick for species identification (good practice statement).\n\nWe recommend against testing a removed Ixodes tick for B. burgdorferi (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Comment: The presence or absence of B. burgdorferi in an Ixodes tick removed from a person does not reliably predict the likelihood of clinical infection.\n\n(B)Diagnostic Testing of Asymptomatic Patients Following Tick Bites\n\nWe recommend against testing asymptomatic patients for exposure to B. burgdorferi following an Ixodes spp. tick bite (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).\n\nIII. Who should receive antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent Lyme disease following presentation with a tick bite?\n\nWe recommend that prophylactic antibiotic therapy be given only to adults and children within 72 hours of removal of an identified high-risk tick bite, but not for bites that are equivocal risk or low risk (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Comment: If a tick bite cannot be classified with a high level of certainty as a high-risk bite, a wait-and-watch approach is recommended. A tick bite is considered to be high-risk only if it meets the following three criteria: the tick bite was from (a) an identified Ixodes spp. vector species, (b) it occurred in a highly endemic area, and (c) the tick was attached for ≥36 hours.\n\nIV. What is the preferred antibiotic regimen for the chemoprophylaxis of Lyme disease following a high-risk tick bite?\n\nFor high-risk Ixodes spp. bites in all age groups, we recommend the administration of a single dose of oral doxycycline within 72 hours of tick removal over observation (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Comment: Doxycycline is given as a single oral dose, 200 mg for adults and 4.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 200 mg) for children.\n\nV. What is the preferred diagnostic testing strategy for erythema migrans?\n\nIn patients with potential tick exposure in a Lyme disease endemic area who have 1 or more skin lesions compatible with erythema migrans, we recommend clinical diagnosis rather than laboratory testing (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).\n\nIn patients with 1 or more skin lesions suggestive of, but atypical for erythema migrans, we suggest antibody testing performed on an acute-phase serum sample (followed by a convalescent-phase serum sample if the initial result is negative) rather than currently available direct detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture performed on blood or skin samples (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Comment: If needed, the convalescent-phase serum sample should be collected at least 2–3 weeks after collection of the acute-phase serum sample.\n\nVI. What are the preferred antibiotic regimens for the treatment of erythema migrans?\n\nFor patients with erythema migrans, we recommend using oral antibiotic therapy with doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil (strong recommendation; moderate quality of evidence). Comment: For patients unable to take both doxycycline and beta-lactam antibiotics, the preferred second-line agent is azithromycin.\n\nVII. How long should a patient with erythema migrans be treated?\n\nWe recommend that patients with erythema migrans be treated with either a 10-day course of doxycycline or a 14-day course of amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil rather than longer treatment courses (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Comment: If azithromycin is used, the indicated duration is 5–10 days, with a 7-day course preferred in the United States, as this duration of therapy was used in the largest clinical trial performed in the United States [3].\n\nVIII. Should patients with the southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) be treated with antibiotics?\n\nIn patients who develop an erythema migrans-like skin lesion following the bite of the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum), an illness referred to as STARI, we make no recommendation for or against the use of antibiotics (no recommendation; knowledge gap). Comment: In certain geographic regions both STARI and Lyme disease are endemic [4]. Distinguishing single erythema migrans due to Lyme disease from STARI may not be possible clinically unless the responsible tick has been identified [5]. When STARI cannot be distinguished from Lyme disease-associated erythema migrans in areas endemic for both conditions, antibiotic therapy directed toward Lyme disease is indicated.\n\nIX. What is the preferred diagnostic testing strategy for Lyme neuroborreliosis?\n\nWhen assessing patients for possible Lyme neuroborreliosis involving either the PNS or central nervous system (CNS), we recommend serum antibody testing rather than PCR or culture of either cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum (strong recommendation, moderate-quality of evidence).\n\nIf CSF testing is performed in patients with suspected Lyme neuroborreliosis involving the CNS, we (a) recommend obtaining simultaneous samples of CSF and serum for determination of the CSF:serum antibody index, carried out by a laboratory using validated methodology, (b) recommend against CSF serology without measurement of the CSF:serum antibody index, and (c) recommend against routine PCR or culture of CSF or serum (strong recommendation, moderate-quality of evidence).\n\nX. For which neurological presentations should patients be tested for Lyme disease?\n\nIn patients presenting with 1 or more of the following acute disorders: meningitis, painful radiculoneuritis, mononeuropathy multiplex including confluent mononeuropathy multiplex, acute cranial neuropathies (particularly VII, VIII, less commonly III, V, VI and others), or in patients with evidence of spinal cord (or rarely brain) inflammation, the former particularly in association with painful radiculitis involving related spinal cord segments, and with epidemiologically plausible exposure to ticks infected with B. burgdorferi, we recommend testing for Lyme disease (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).\n\nIn patients with typical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, dementia or cognitive decline, or new-onset seizures, we recommend against routine testing for Lyme disease (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).\n\nIn patients with neurological syndromes other than those listed in (1) or (2), in the absence of a history of other clinical or epidemiologic support for the diagnosis of Lyme disease, we recommend against screening for Lyme disease (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).\n\nIn patients presenting with nonspecific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) white matter abnormalities confined to the brain in the absence of a history of other clinical or epidemiologic support for the diagnosis of Lyme disease, we suggest against testing for Lyme disease (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).\n\nXI. Should adult patients with psychiatric illnesses be tested for Lyme disease?\n\nIn patients with psychiatric illness, we recommend against routine testing for Lyme disease (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).\n\nXII. Should children with deveopmental, behavioral or psychiatric disorders be tested for Lyme disease?\n\nIn children presenting with developmental, behavioral or psychiatric disorders, we suggest against routinely testing for Lyme disease (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).\n\nXIII. What are the preferred antibiotic regimens for the treatment of acute neurological manifestations of Lyme disease without parenchymal involvement of the brain or spinal cord?\n\nIn patients with Lyme disease-associated meningitis, cranial neuropathy, radiculoneuropathy or with other peripheral nervous system (PNS) manifestations, we recommend using intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, penicillin G, or oral doxycycline over other antimicrobials (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Comment: Decisions about the choice of antibiotic among these, including the route of administration, should primarily be made based on individual factors such as side effect profile, ease of administration, ability to tolerate oral medication, concerns about compliance unrelated to effectiveness. Treatment route may be changed from IV to oral during treatment. The preferred antibiotic duration is 14–21 days.\n\nXIV. Should patients with Lyme disease-related parenchymal involvement of the brain or spinal cord be treated with oral or intravenous antibiotics?\n\nIn patients with Lyme disease-associated parenchymal involvement of the brain or spinal cord, we recommend using IV over oral antibiotics (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).\n\nXV. Should patients with Lyme disease and facial nerve palsy receive corticosteroids in addition to antimicrobial therapy?\n\nIn patients with Lyme disease-associated facial nerve palsy, we make no recommendation on the use of corticosteroids in addition to antibiotics (no recommendation; knowledge gap). Comment: In patients age 16 or older presenting with acute facial nerve palsy but without other objective clinical or serologic evidence of Lyme disease, corticosteroid treatment should be administered within 72 hours in accordance with current facial nerve palsy guideline recommendations [6].\n\nXVI. Should all patients with early Lyme disease receive an electrocardiogram (ECG) to screen for Lyme carditis?\n\nWe suggest performing an ECG only in patients with signs or symptoms consistent with Lyme carditis (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Comment: Symptoms and signs of cardiac involvement in Lyme disease include dyspnea, edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, chest pain, and syncope.\n\nXVII. Which patients with Lyme carditis require hospitalization?\n\nIn patients with or at risk for severe cardiac complications of Lyme disease including those with significant PR prolongation (PR > 300 milliseconds), other arrhythmias, or clinical manifestations of myopericarditis, we recommend hospital admission with continuous ECG monitoring (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Comment: Clinical manifestations of Lyme carditis include exercise intolerance, palpitations, presyncope, syncope, pericarditic pain, evidence of pericardial effusion, elevated biomarkers (such as troponin), edema, and shortness of breath.\n\nXVIII. What pacing modality should be used if needed for the management of Lyme carditis?\n\nFor patients with symptomatic bradycardia due to Lyme carditis that cannot be managed medically, we recommend temporary pacing modalities rather than implanting a permanent pacemaker (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).\n\nXIX. What are the preferred antibiotic regimens for the treatment of Lyme carditis?\n\nIn outpatients with Lyme carditis, we suggest oral antibiotics over IV antibiotics (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence).\n\nIn the hospitalized patient with Lyme carditis, we suggest initially using IV ceftriaxone over oral antibiotics until there is evidence of clinical improvement, then switching to oral antibiotics to complete treatment (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence).\n\nFor the treatment of Lyme carditis, we suggest 14–21 days of total antibiotic therapy over longer durations of treatment (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Comment: Oral antibiotic choices for Lyme carditis are doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and azithromycin.\n\nXX. Should patients being evaluated for acute myocarditis/pericarditis or chronic cardiomyopathy of unknown cause be tested for Lyme disease?\n\nIn patients with acute myocarditis/pericarditis of unknown cause in an appropriate epidemiologic setting, we recommend testing for Lyme disease (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).\n\nIn patients with chronic cardiomyopathy of unknown cause, we suggest against routine testing for Lyme disease (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).\n\nXXI. What is the preferred diagnostic testing strategy for Lyme arthritis?\n\nWhen assessing possible Lyme arthritis, we recommend serum antibody testing over PCR or culture of blood or synovial fluid/tissue (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).\n\nIn seropositive patients for whom the diagnosis of Lyme arthritis is being considered but treatment decisions require more definitive information, we recommend PCR applied to synovial fluid or tissue rather than Borrelia culture of those samples (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).\n\nXXII. What are the preferred antibiotic regimens for the initial treatment of Lyme arthritis?\n\nFor patients with Lyme arthritis, we recommend using oral antibiotic therapy for 28 days (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).\n\nXXIII. What are the approaches to patients in whom Lyme arthritis has not completely recovered?\n\nIn patients with Lyme arthritis with partial response (mild residual joint swelling) after a first course of oral antibiotic, we make no recommendation for a second course of antibiotic versus observation (no recommendation, knowledge gap). Comment: Consideration should be given to exclusion of other causes of joint swelling than Lyme arthritis, medication adherence, duration of arthritis prior to initial treatment, degree of synovial proliferation versus joint swelling, patient preferences, and cost. A second course of oral antibiotics for up to 1 month may be a reasonable alternative for patients in whom synovial proliferation is modest compared to joint swelling and for those who prefer repeating a course of oral antibiotics before considering IV therapy.\n\nIn patients with Lyme arthritis with no or minimal response (moderate to severe joint swelling with minimal reduction of the joint effusion) to an initial course of oral antibiotic, we suggest a 2- to 4-week course of IV ceftriaxone over a second course of oral antibiotics (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).\n\nXXIV. How should post-antibiotic (previously termed \"antibiotic-refractory\") Lyme arthritis be treated?\n\nIn patients who have failed one course of oral antibiotics and one course of IV antibiotics, we suggest a referral to a rheumatologist or other trained specialist for consideration of the use of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biologic agents, intraarticular steroids, or arthroscopic synovectomy (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Comment: Antibiotic therapy for longer than 8 weeks is not expected to provide additional benefit to patients with persistent arthritis if that treatment has included 1 course of IV therapy.\n\nXXV. Should patients with persistent symptoms following standard treatment of Lyme disease receive additional antibiotics?\n\nFor patients who have persistent or recurring nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, pain, or cognitive impairment following recommended treatment for Lyme disease, but who lack objective evidence of reinfection or treatment failure, we recommend against additional antibiotic therapy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Comment: Evidence of persistent infection or treatment failure would include objective signs of disease activity, such as arthritis, meningitis, or neuropathy.\n\nXXVI. What is the preferred antibioti regimen for the treatment of borrelial lymphocytoma?\n\nIn patients with borrelial lymphocytoma, we suggest oral antibiotic therapy for 14 days (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).\n\nXXVII. What is the preferred antibiotic regimen for the treatment of acrodermatitis chronia atrophicans?\n\nIn patients with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, we suggest oral antibiotic therapy for 21–28 days over shorter durations (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).\n\nXXVIII. Under what circumstances should a patient with Lyme disease be evaluated for co-infection with A. phagocytophilum or B. microti?\n\nIn patients with Lyme disease who have a high-grade fever or characteristic laboratory abnormalities, clinicians should assess for possible coinfection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum and/or B. microti infection in geographic regions where these infections are endemic (good practice statement). Comment: Coinfection should be investigated in patients who have a persistent fever for >1 day while on antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. If fever persists despite treatment with doxycycline, B. microti infection is an important consideration. Characteristic laboratory abnormalities found in both anaplasmosis and babesiosis include thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and/or anemia. Evidence of hemolysis, such as elevated indirect bilirubin level, anemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase are particularly suggestive of babesiosis.\n\nIntroduction\n\nLyme disease is a tick-borne infection caused by spirochetes in the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex and transmitted to humans by the bite of certain species of Ixodes ticks [7, 8]. It is the most common vector-borne infectious disease of humans in the temperate northern hemisphere, affecting hundreds of thousands of people annually in North America and Eurasia. In North America, Lyme disease is found predominantly in 3 regions: the northeastern states from Virginia to eastern Canada (including Ontario, Quebec, and the eastern maritime provinces); the upper Midwest, particularly Wisconsin and Minnesota; and in northern California.\n\nLyme disease is a complex infection, and clinical disease can manifest as early as days and as late as many months following an infectious tick bite. Presentations include a skin lesion at the site of the tick bite and disseminated disease resulting in skin lesions distant from the tick-bite site, neuropathy, meningitis, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and/or arthritis. Interpretation of diagnostic tests for Lyme disease presents certain challenges due to the dynamics of the serologic response following infection. Finally, treatment options, including the drug, route, and duration of treatment may differ for different disease manifestations.\n\nScope\n\nThis guideline encompasses the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme disease, as well as Lyme disease complicated by simultaneous coinfection with other tick-borne pathogens in North America. In contrast to the 2006 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline, this guideline only addresses anaplasmosis and babesiosis in the context of a coinfection. Anaplasmosis is now addressed in the rickettsial disease guidelines developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [9], and babesiosis recommendations can be found in a separate IDSA guideline (in press).\n\nThis guideline is primarily intended for medical practitioners in North America, although many recommendations will be applicable to patients in Europe and Asia. As Eurasian strains of B. burgdorferi sensu lato can cause clinical signs not associated with North American strains, this guideline also includes recommendations for evaluation and treatment of patients who present with borrelia lymphocytoma and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans after travel to endemic areas.\n\nMethodology\n\nClinical Practice Guidelines\n\nClinical Practice Guidelines are statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care by assisting practitioners and patients in making shared decisions about appropriate healthcare for specific clinical circumstances. They are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options [10]. The “IDSA Handbook on Clinical Practice Guideline Development” provides more detailed information on the processes followed throughout the development of this guideline [11].\n\nGuideline Authorship\n\nThis guideline is preceded by guidelines by the IDSA [12] and American Academy of Neurology (AAN) [13]. This guideline is a collaborative effort by IDSA, AAN, as well as the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Recognizing that Lyme disease is evaluated and treated by physicians from different subspecialties in varied clinical settings, this guideline has official representation from numerous organizations including scientific, primary care, and medical specialties.\n\nGuideline Panel Composition\n\nEach of the 3 sponsoring organizations elected a cochair to lead the guideline panel (P.M.L. representing IDSA, J.A.R. representing AAN, and L.K.B. representing ACR) with a fourth cochair selected for his expertise in guideline methodology (Y.F.Y. representing the US GRADE Network). A total of 36 panelists comprised the full panel. The panel included infectious diseases specialists representing IDSA, neurologists representing AAN, rheumatologists representing ACR, as well as representatives from the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), American Academy of Pediatrics—Committee on Infectious Diseases (AAP-COID), American Academy of Pediatrics—Section on Emergency Medicine (AAP-SOEM), American College of Physicians (ACP), Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease (AMMI) Canada, Child Neurology Society (CNS), Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS), Entomological Society of America (ESA), and European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID). Members representing the disciplines of cardiology, microbiology, pathology, and a methodologist with expertise in GRADE were also included. Finally, the panel included 3 patient representatives and 1 healthcare consumer representative. At the request of the patient representatives, we have not disclosed their names to maintain their confidentiality. Both academic and community practitioners were included. Guideline methodologists (Y.F.Y. and V.L.) oversaw all methodological aspects of the guideline development. A technical review team from Tufts Medical Center (R.R.B., M.C.O., and E.E.V) performed the systematic reviews of the literature, identified and summarized the scientific evidence using questions in the “PICO” format (Patient/Population[P]; Intervention/Indicator[I]; Comparator/Control[C]; Outcome[O]).\n\nDisclosure and Management of Potential Conflicts of Interest (COI)\n\nThe Lyme conflict of interest (COI) review group consisting of 2 representatives from IDSA, AAN, and ACR were responsible for reviewing, evaluating, and approving all disclosures. All members of the expert panel complied with the consensus IDSA/AAN/ACR process for reviewing and managing conflicts of interest, which required disclosure of any financial, intellectual, or other interest that might be construed as constituting an actual, potential, or apparent conflict, regardless of relevancy to the guideline topic. Thus, to provide transparency, IDSA/AAN/ACR required full disclosure of all relationships. The assessment of disclosed relationships for possible COI by the IDSA/AAN/ACR review group was based on the relative weight of the financial relationship (ie, monetary amount) and the relevance of the relationship (ie, the degree to which an association might reasonably be interpreted by an independent observer as related to the topic or recommendation of consideration). For more information on allowable and prohibited relationships, please review Table 1 and Table 2. In addition, the IDSA/AAN/ACR adhered to Section 7 of the Council for Medical Specialty Societies’ “Code for Interactions with Companies” [14]. The COI review group ensured that the majority of the panel and each cochair was without potential relevant (related to the topic) conflicts (see the Notes section). Each of the cochairs and all members of the technical team were determined to be unconflicted. See the notes section for disclosures reported to IDSA/AAN/ACR.\n\nClinical Questions and Evidence Review\n\nAn initial list of relevant clinical questions for these guidelines was created by the whole panel for review and discussion. The final set of clinical questions was approved by the entire committee. All outcomes of interest were identified a priori and explicitly rated for their relative importance for decision making. Each clinical question was assigned to a pair of panelists.\n\nThe technical team, consisting of three experts in systematic reviews from Tufts Medical Center (R.R.B., M.C.O., and E.E.V) who did not have any conflicts of interest, designed the literature searches to address every clinical question. Searches were limited to studies published in English. There was no restriction on the year of publication. The following electronic databases were searched: Ovid Medline, Cochrane database, Google Scholar, Scopus, and EMBASE. The initial literature searches were performed in March 2016, then updated in August 2017 and in April 2019. All new relevant studies pertinent to this guideline were incorporated into the final guideline. To supplement the electronic searches, the panelists had the option of manually searching journals, conference proceedings’ reference lists, and regulatory agency websites for relevant articles. The Tufts technical team screened titles and abstracts of all identified citations, and all potentially relevant citations were subjected to a full-text review, using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria that were tailored to meet the specific population, intervention, and comparator of each clinical question. Trial data or other evidence of effectiveness from non-peer-reviewed data sources, such as abstracts and conference proceedings, letters to the editor, editorials, review articles, and unpublished data were excluded a priori for lack of sufficient peer review to avoid serious risk of bias associated with a lack of editorial oversight. The results of the literature search were thoroughly reviewed by the technical team for the final selection of the relevant articles. Panel members reviewed these articles for accuracy of selection criteria. Because studies may be initially included that are not pertinent, additional review was necessary to ensure proper final selection of studies. Once the articles were selected, the technical team in conjunction with panelists and methodologists decided if a qualitative and/or a quantitative analysis was appropriate.\n\nEvidence summaries for each question were prepared by the technical team from Tufts Medical Center. The risk of bias was assessed by the technical review team using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized controlled trials [15], the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) for nonrandomized studies [16] and QUADAS-2 tool for diagnostic test accuracy studies [17]. The certainty in the evidence was initially determined for each critical and important outcome, and then for each recommendation using the GRADE approach for rating the confidence in the evidence [1, 2] (see Figure 1). Evidence profile tables and quality of evidence were reviewed by the guideline methodologists (Y.F.Y. and V.L.). The summaries of evidence were discussed and reviewed by all committee members and edited as appropriate. The final evidence summaries were presented to the whole panel for deliberation and drafting of recommendations. Literature search strategies, PRISMA flow diagrams detailing the search results, data extraction and evidence profiles tables, and additional data, such as meta-analysis results when appropriate, can be found in the supplementary materials (.docx).\n\nRanking of the outcomes by importance for decision-making was determined by consensus for each PICO question. In situations where a PICO question compared the use of an antibiotic regimen to no antibiotics, if the beneficial effects of the antibiotic regimen were uncertain, undesirable outcomes would usually be ranked higher in importance than if benefits were certain. That is, undesirable outcomes would be ranked as “critical” for decision making rather than “important.” Moreover, in situations where a PICO question compared the use of a specific antibiotic regimen to another antibiotic regimen (either regarding specific molecules, classes of antibiotics, route of administration, or duration of therapy) and the beneficial effects of the 2 regimens were similar, then the undesirable outcomes could be ranked as critical for decision making, but several other considerations might have also been taken into account such as stewardship issues, availability, patient preferences, and costs.\n\nDevelopment of Clinical Recommendations\n\nAll recommendations were labeled as either “strong” or “weak” according to the GRADE approach [2] (see Figure 1). The words “we recommend” indicate strong recommendations and “we suggest” indicate weak recommendations. Figure 1 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policymakers. For recommendations where the comparators are not formally stated, the comparison of interest is implicitly referred to as “not using the intervention” (either not using a specific treatment or diagnostic test). High-quality evidence was lacking for several recommendations. According to GRADE guidance, strong recommendations in the setting of lower-quality evidence were only assigned when the panelists believed they conformed to one or several paradigmatic conditions. As per GRADE guidance on discordant recommendations [18], 2 paradigmatic situations presented in the development of this guideline: (1) low-quality evidence suggested benefit in a life-threatening situation (with evidence regarding harms being low or high), and (2) when low-quality evidence suggested benefit and high-quality evidence suggested harm. For recommendations pertaining to good practice statements, appropriate identification and wording choices were followed according to the GRADE working group [19]. A good practice statement represents a message perceived by the guideline panel as necessary to healthcare practice, that is supported by a large body of indirect evidence difficult to summarize, and indicates that implementing this recommendation would clearly result in large net positive consequences. “Knowledge gaps” were noted where there remained particularly important research needs of relevance to clinical recommendations.\n\nThe entire panel met for a 2-day face-to-face meeting in Arlington, Virginia, in January 2017 for the presentation of evidence summaries and the development of the recommendations. All members of the panel participated in the preparation of the guideline and approved the recommendations.\n\nRevision Process\n\nPublic comment allows for key stakeholders to review and identify gaps in a guideline before its finalization and publication. In 2015, the guideline panel held a 60-day public comment period requesting input on its project plan that laid the groundwork for the new Lyme disease guidelines. In June 2019, the panel opened a second 75-day public comment period requesting feedback on the full guideline. The panel reviewed the feedback from the public comment phase and updated the guideline as needed.\n\nFeedback was also obtained from external peer reviews. The guideline was reviewed and approved by the IDSA Standards and Practice Guidelines Committee (SPGC), AAN’s Guidelines Development, Dissemination, Implementation Sub-Committee and Practice Committee, ACR’s Clinical Practice Guidelines Subcommittee and Quality of Care Committee, as well as the 3 organizations’ respective Board of Directors. AAFP, AAMI-Canada, CNS, PIDS, ESA, and ESCMID have reviewed provided endorsement of the guideline.\n\nRevision for Currency Schedule\n\nApproximately every 2 years and more frequently, if needed, IDSA, AAN, and ACR will determine the need for revisions to the guideline by an examination of the current literature and the likelihood that any new data will have an impact on the recommendations. If necessary, the entire expert panel will be reconvened to discuss potential changes. Any revision to the guideline will be submitted for review and approval to the appropriate Committees and Boards of IDSA, AAN, and ACR.\n\nGeneral Principles\n\nDiagnostic Testing for Lyme Disease\n\nBased on performance characteristics and practical considerations, antibody tests are first-line for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease. Serum antibody (serology) testing is highly sensitive in patients with common extracutaneous manifestations that develop weeks to months after initial infection [20, 21]. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) seronegativity in an untreated patient with months to years of symptoms essentially rules out the diagnosis of Lyme disease, barring laboratory error or a rare humoral immunodeficiency state. Serologic testing is also highly specific when performed and interpreted according to current guidelines [21, 22]. Serum antibody tests should be performed using clinically validated assays in a conventional 2-tiered testing protocol, in which an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA) is followed by immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG immunoblots, or in a modified 2-tiered testing protocol, in which 2 different EIAs are performed sequentially or concurrently without the use of immunoblots [23–27]. Serologic tests are intended for use in 2-tiered testing protocols, rather than as stand-alone assays, as this improves specificity [25]. Predictive value is increased when results are correlated with clinical features, patient history and risk factors.\n\nAs an indirect detection method, antibody testing for Lyme disease has some important limitations. Results can be falsely negative in the first days to weeks following initial exposure because a detectable antibody response takes time to develop [21, 28, 29]. This is often the case in patients with erythema migrans, an early manifestation of Lyme disease, who are tested <2 weeks after the development of the skin lesion [21, 28, 29].\n\nIn a seropositive patient, it can be difficult to determine whether antibody reactivity is due to past infection versus active/current infection. In part, this is because both IgM and IgG B. burgdorferi-specific antibody responses can persist for years or even decades after the infection has been eradicated [8, 30, 31]. Furthermore, patients can be infected multiple times [32], especially if the initial infection is promptly treated at an early stage, and an expanded humoral immune response does not develop. If there is a known or suspected past history of Lyme disease in a seropositive patient with new symptoms, the diagnosis may be primarily reliant on clinical features and exclusion of alternative diagnoses. Some individuals with no prior exposure to B. burgdorferi may have positive serologic tests, sometimes due to cross-reactive antibodies to other microbes or due to autoimmune disease. Because of this potential for false positive results, clinicians should be selective when ordering tests in patients with a low probability of Lyme disease.\n\nTo address these limitations, numerous nonserologic methods have been proposed or developed, including nucleic acid amplification tests, culture methods, and antigen detection assays, among others. At present, few nonserologic testing methods are useful or practical for clinical diagnosis, and those that are—primarily nucleic acid amplification tests—are mostly beneficial as adjunctive tests in select clinical scenarios when 2-tiered serologic testing is positive. This document provides guidance about when to consider ordering a nonserologic test, such as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, but providers may be faced with many options when choosing, for example, a PCR test. As a rule, an assay should only be used for diagnostic purposes if its analytical and clinical validity has been demonstrated reproducibly in comparison to an appropriate reference standard. Assessing the validity of a particular nonserologic test for Lyme disease is especially challenging because none has yet been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Before requesting a non-FDA-cleared test for diagnostic purposes, providers are strongly encouraged to (1) verify that the diagnostic laboratory offering the test is certified under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) for high-complexity diagnostic testing, and (2) ensure that validation studies, whether published or unpublished, confirm analytical and clinical performance that is substantially equivalent in comparison to an appropriate reference standard. In making this assessment, consultation with an independent clinical laboratory director with experience in Lyme disease diagnostics is advised. In some cases, the CDC may serve as a resource for this assessment [33]. Some commercially available laboratory testing methods, including nonstandard serology interpretation, urine antigen, DNA testing, the use of a lymphocyte transformation test [34], or quantitative CD57 lymphocyte assay [35] should be avoided for clinical use due to lack of systematic, independent, reproducible validation studies [36].\n\nTreatment of Lyme Disease\n\nLyme disease is treated with antimicrobials with activity against B. burgdorferi (see Tables 3 and 4). The goals of treatment are the eventual resolution of signs and symptoms of infection, with prevention of relapsed active infection or new complications of infection. Patients with erythema migrans are treated with 7–14 days of an appropriate antibiotic depending on which drug is prescribed; other clinical manifestations are typically treated with 14–28 days of an appropriate antibiotic with duration of treatment based on which clinical manifestation is being treated.\n\nB. burgdorferi is susceptible to antimicrobials from several classes. The antibiotics most commonly used to treat B. burgdorferi infection in North America include doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. Under most circumstances, oral therapy is effective and preferred over intravenous (IV) therapy due to equivalent efficacies, better tolerability, and lower cost. However, indications for IV therapy, such as treatment of a hospitalized patient, are discussed in this guideline.\n\nThe choice of antibiotic depends on a number of factors that include age, the presence of extracutaneous manifestations of Lyme disease, such as neurologic Lyme disease; drug allergy, side effect profile, or tolerability; frequency of administration; sun exposure (sun exposure will increase the risk of photosensitivity skin reactions associated with doxycycline); likelihood of coinfection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum or Ehrlichia muris eauclairensis (formerly known as Ehrlichia muris-like agent), which, if suspected, would necessitate the use of doxycycline [9]; whether there is consideration of cellulitis versus erythema migrans in the differential diagnosis; and cost. Macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin and azithromycin, may have lower efficacy than other antibiotic classes and are generally considered second-line treatment options for Lyme disease in North America.\n\nDoxycycline has traditionally been avoided in children <8 years of age, in pregnancy, and in breastfeeding women because of concern for staining of permanent teeth. This is primarily based on experience with older tetracyclines, not with doxycycline. Subsequent research, albeit mostly observational and of limited sample size, casts doubt on an association between doxycycline and tooth staining. A growing consensus accepts the safety of doxycycline use in young children for at least up to 14-days duration, but more data on safety would be desirable [37–41]. For some Lyme disease treatment decisions, most notably the treatment of Lyme meningitis, doxycycline is the only oral option that has been well studied. This drug was found to be effective in clinical trials, and the alternative of IV therapy has additional risks. For patients with a potentially severe beta-lactam allergy, the remaining uncertainties about doxycycline may be preferable to the dangers of rechallenge with a beta-lactam antibiotic or antibiotic desensitization. The safety of doxycycline in pregnancy and breastfeeding requires more study [42, 43], and thus the decision to use doxycycline in these patients should be individualized to the likely risks and benefits of alternative antibiotics.\n\nSeveral antibiotics and antibiotic classes are not indicated to treat Lyme disease due to a variety of considerations, including lack of in vitro activity, the absence of supportive clinical data, potential toxicity, and an unnecessarily broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Drugs and drug classes that are not indicated for the treatment of Lyme disease include first-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, pyrazinamide, vancomycin, tigecycline, metronidazole, tinidazole, rifampin, hydroxychloroquine, or fluconazole. Additionally, drugs with antibabesial activity such as clindamycin, quinine, and atovaquone should only be used in recommended combinations for the specific treatment of babesiosis, if present. There is no clinical evidence to support regimens intended to treat morphologic variants of B. burgdorferi [44] (aka “cyst” forms), to specifically target intracellular bacteria, or to eradicate fastidious “persister” cells [45].\n\nA minority of patients treated for early Lyme disease have a transient intensification of symptoms, with or without fever, during the first 24 hours of antibiotic therapy. This phenomenon, which may be similar to the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction during initial treatment of syphilis, is likely an inflammatory response to a bacterial antigen load released after the initial dose of antibiotics. In patients treated for Lyme disease, this reaction is usually mild, self-limited, and does not recur later in therapy. Symptoms that arise later in the course of treatment should not be classified as Jarisch-Herxheimer-like reactions and do not signify microbial burden or have prognostic value.\n\nLyme disease has been successfully treated using standard treatment regimens in many different patient populations, including pregnant women, children, individuals with comorbidities, and immunocompromised patients. To date, Lyme disease in pregnancy has not been found to result in congenital infection or a syndrome of congenital abnormalities, and no additional treatment or monitoring of the mother or infant is recommended beyond the standard of care. Patients with compromised immune systems have been successfully treated for Lyme disease using regimens studied in healthy hosts [46–52]. Apart from antibiotic choice, which may need to be individualized based on allergy, intolerance, or contraindications, treatment recommendations are generally applicable to different patient populations.\n\nTick Bites Prevention and Prophylaxis of Lyme Disease\n\nA human Lyme disease vaccine was briefly available in the United States 2 decades ago. Citing falling sales, the manufacturer discontinued the vaccine 3 years after the FDA approved it in 1998 [53]. In the intervening years, much more has been learned about the interactions among the Lyme disease bacterium, host immunity, and tick immunity. Such knowledge is providing opportunities to explore additional immunization strategies to prevent transmission, including anti-tick vaccines, which may result in the prevention of multiple tick-borne diseases [54]. In the absence of vaccines, the risk of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases can be reduced by preventing tick exposure. Therefore, knowing which tick species and life stages are vectors, and when and where they are most likely to be active, can help people avoid ticks in the first place or take proper precautions to prevent bites when in risky habitats. Additionally, prevention of tick-borne diseases involves an understanding of personal protective measures and repellents (Table 5), tick removal, the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis following a tick bite (Table 6), as well as anticipatory guidance about the signs and symptoms of a tick-borne infection. Healthcare professionals can play a very important role by increasing awareness and educating patients about ticks, tick-borne pathogens, and measures to reduce exposure, thereby increasing their confidence and likelihood to practice precautionary behaviors [55].\n\nIn North America, there are several human-biting tick species, but the blacklegged (deer) tick (Ixodes scapularis) and western blacklegged tick (I. pacificus) are the vectors for the agents of Lyme disease, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (hereafter referred to as B. burgdorferi), and less commonly, B. mayonii [56], to humans [57] (Figure 2). I. scapularis is responsible for the overwhelming majority of B. burgdorferi transmission in North America [57], and therefore much of the description of factors affecting Lyme disease risk summarized below is derived from research on I. scapularis. Many of the findings apply to I. pacificus, which vectors Lyme disease in the Pacific Northwest, particularly in Northern California and Oregon, but clinicians in the western United States should refer to state health agency websites for more specific information and guidance.\n\nFor both I. scapularis and I. pacificus there are 3 postegg host-seeking (also known as questing) life stages: the larva, nymph, and adult. Importantly for Lyme disease risk assessment, not all life stages can transmit infection to people. Larvae hatch free of B. burgdorferi infection and therefore are not considered vectors of that pathogen [58], but if they acquire B. burgdorferi while feeding on infected reservoir hosts, such as white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in the eastern United States, they can then transmit it as nymphs and adults. Although both nymphs and adults can vector B. burgdorferi, nymphs are the main Lyme disease vectors due to their smaller size and cryptic coloration (ie, lower detection probability), greater abundance, and their seasonality that coincides with higher levels of human outdoor activity [57]. Adults are less important as vectors for 2 main reasons. First, adult male Ixodes spp. ticks do not attach or feed long enough to infect people [59]. Second, adult females, which are reddish and larger than nymphs, are more quickly detected and removed before they transmit the infection. Thus, the nymphal questing period poses the greatest risk. Nymphs can be active from spring through fall, but their activity peaks in late spring and summer, when most cases of Lyme disease occur [56, 57] (Figure 3). Adult ticks are primarily active in fall and spring but also in winter, when temperatures exceed 4° C [60]. Risk at these times of the year is much lower but appears to be more significant for children and older adults, who may not as readily detect and remove ticks in time to prevent transmission [61, 62].\n\nAs I. scapularis vectors >95% of cases of Lyme disease in North America [57], most cases occur within its geographical range, which encompasses much of the eastern United States. The distribution of Lyme disease risk, however, is not uniform and corresponds closely to the distribution of B. burgdorferi-infected, questing I. scapularis nymphs [64]. Fourteen states in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central United States, where infected questing nymphs are abundant, consistently account for more than 95% of all cases of Lyme disease reported to the CDC [56] (see Figure 4 and https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/maps-recent.html for the most recent data). In more southern states, however, where I. scapularis is widely established [65], the risk of exposure to B. burgdorferi-infected ticks is much lower [64]. This difference in risk is due in part to negligible or extremely low prevalence of infection in both nymphs and adult I. scapularis [64, 66], as well as the rare tendency of southern nymphal blacklegged ticks to quest above the leaf litter and feed on reservoir hosts, in contrast to their northern counterparts [67–69]. Reports of nymphal tick bites in this region are very rare, again in contrast to reports in northern regions [70].\n\nOver the last 3 decades, the geographic risk of exposure has expanded as northern I. scapularis populations have spread into new areas [65] followed by concomitant increases in tick-borne disease both in the northern [71, 72] and southern [73, 74] United States and Canada [75]. Multiple factors most likely are responsible for the ongoing emergence of I. scapularis and Lyme disease. Examples include changes in landscape and land use, wildlife host populations, and climate that increase the habitat and survival of tick populations, as well as increasing overlap between human and tick activity. Thus, physicians and the public should consult state health departments and the CDC to obtain the most current information on the areas of existing and emerging Lyme disease risk (https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/maps-recent.html). I. scapularis can be found in urban, suburban, and rural landscapes in a variety of habitats, although they are most abundant in or near [76] wooded areas, where wildlife hosts are ample and a sufficient layer of leaf litter reduces desiccation risk and promotes their survival [77]. The public can take several measures to minimize the environmental risk of Lyme disease, that is, the abundance of infected ticks in their yard. Options and further references can be found on the CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/prev/index.html).\n\nFull Recommendations for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Lyme Disease\n\nI. Which measures should be used to prevent tick bites and tick-borne infections?\n\n(A) Personal Protective Measures\n\nRecommendation\n\nIndividuals at risk of exposure should implement personal protective measures to reduce the risk of tick exposure and infection with tick-borne pathogens (good practice statement).\n\nSummary of the Evidence\n\nSeveral personal protective measures can reduce the risk of tick exposure and infection with tick-borne pathogens (Table 5). Recommended measures include wearing light-colored clothing with long sleeves and long pants, tucking pants into socks, and conducting thorough tick checks following outdoor activities [57, 78–80]. Wearing light-colored clothing with long sleeves and long pants can make it easier to see ticks crawling on clothing before they can attach to skin. Because nymphal I. scapularis quest near the ground, tucking pants into socks can reduce the chances of ticks attaching to skin. Tucking pants into sock similarly may reduce tick exposure. Because I. scapularis may crawl on human hosts for up to several hours before attaching, a thorough tick check after being outdoors helps to find ticks before they attach. Bathing or showering within 2 hours of outdoor activity can significantly reduce the risk of Lyme disease [81]. Nymphal ticks most frequently are found attached to the legs, arms, and back [62, 76], and bathing provides a good opportunity for a thorough tick check especially in areas where visual detection of ticks may be obscured such as the axilla, nape of neck, in and around ears, umbilicus, groin, and popliteal fossa. Bathing may also wash off unattached ticks. After outdoor activities, placing clothes directly in a dryer on high heat for at least 10 minutes is highly effective for killing I. scapularis, though up to 60 minutes may be required for other tick species [82, 83]. Washing clothes in hot, but not cold or warm water, will also kill I. scapularis [82]. Because companion animals (eg, dogs and cats) that spend time outdoors may bring unattached ticks into the home, they [76] should also be checked regularly for ticks, even if they are treated with tick control products, to prevent subsequent tick attachment to humans [84]. Importantly, although there is a positive association between companion animal ownership and tick exposure, there is no direct evidence that companion animal ownership increases the risk of falling ill with a tick-borne disease.\n\nRationale for Recommendation\n\nAlthough there is little systematic evidence supporting some of these measures for the prevention of Lyme disease, they may offer potential benefits with little effort, risk, or cost.\n\nKnowledge Gaps\n\nProperly designed studies performed with human subjects under realistic conditions are required to test the efficacy of personal protection measures. Similarly, research is needed to inform how to motivate the adoption and continued use of best practice personal protection measures.\n\n(B) Repellents to Prevent Tick Bites\n\nRecommendation\n\nFor the prevention of tick bites, we recommend N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), picaridin, ethyl-3-(N-n-butyl-N-acetyl) aminopropionate (IR3535), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), p-methane-3,8-diol (PMD), 2-undecanone, or permethrin (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).\n\nSummary of the Evidence\n\nIn laboratory and field experiments involving human subjects, the use of DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), p-methane-3,8-diol (PMD, the synthetic active ingredient in oil of lemon eucalyptus), 2-undecanone, and permethrin reduced the number of ticks detected crawling on or attached to subjects compared with controls [85–90] (Table 5). Other commercially available products, including botanical agents and essential oils (eg, essential oils of rosemary, cinnamon leaf, lemongrass, geraniol [91], nootkatone, and carvacrol [92]) cannot be recommended due to insufficient evidence.\n\nDEET, picaridin, IR3535, OLE, PMD, and 2-undecanone can be applied directly to skin and clothing. Different concentrations and preparations affect their efficacy and duration of activity. In general, products with higher concentrations provide greater and/or longer periods of efficacy compared with lower concentrations [85–90], although products containing >50% DEET [93] do not offer a meaningful increase in protection time over lower concentrations. Permethrin (0.5%) kills ticks on contact but must be applied to clothing. Field studies indicate that clothes sprayed with permethrin or made with pretreated, permethrin-impregnated material provide highly effective protection against tick bites [88, 94–96] and are more effective compared with clothes treated with DEET [88, 94].\n\nTo improve efficacy and safety, repellents should always be applied to targeted areas of the body and/or clothes according to the manufacturer’s instructions and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) label. Repellents should only be applied to exposed skin or clothing and should not be sprayed under clothing. Adults should supervise the application of repellents on children. The EPA has approved DEET for use on children with no age restriction. Because of a lack of safety data, however, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the CDC only recommend DEET for infants at least 2 months of age. The AAP, CDC, and EPA do not recommend OLE and PMD for children <3 years of age. To maintain efficacy, repellents may need to be reapplied after swimming, washing, or heavy perspiration. The use of products that combine sunscreen and DEET is discouraged because frequent application of the sunscreen may exceed the recommended exposure to the repellent. Furthermore, sunscreen may increase the absorption of DEET through the skin [97]. Consequently, the FDA recommends that sunscreen be applied before DEET.\n\nDespite public concern over the use of DEET, decades of use show there is a very low risk of adverse effects when used as labeled [98–106]. Some reported cases of encephalopathy following DEET application were likely due to improper application, an excessive dose, or unintentional ingestion [98, 99, 102]. Despite hundreds of millions of annual applications of DEET, reports of encephalopathy are rare and may not differ from the background rate in the general population [99, 100].\n\nUnlike the previous products, permethrin (0.5%) kills ticks on contact and must be applied to clothing and gear (eg, boots) in advance and allowed to dry prior to use. Field studies indicate that clothes sprayed with permethrin or made with pretreated, permethrin-impregnated material provide highly effective protection against tick bites [88, 94–96] and are more effective compared with clothes treated with DEET [88, 94].\n\nFor people with frequent occupational or recreational exposure to tick habitats, a feasible option would be to wear permethrin-treated clothing and to apply a repellent to exposed skin, if additional protection were desired. For those who prefer an alternative to conventional synthetic repellents, IR3535, OLE, PMD, 2-undecanone are all considered by the EPA as biopesticides (derived from natural materials). For more information and to decide which repellent to recommend, there are resources at the websites of the EPA, CDC, and many state agencies.\n\nRationale for Recommendation\n\nBecause ticks often attach and complete blood meals without being noticed, repellents with proven efficacy may prevent tick-borne diseases.\n\nKnowledge Gaps\n\nProperly designed studies performed with human subjects under natural conditions are required to test the efficacy (ideally, the prevention of disease) and safety of additional options for repellents. For example, a small field study [92] indicated that clothes sprayed with natural-product based repellents (nootkatone, carvacrol, geraniol) can effectively repel ticks, but before these products can be recommended, more extensive studies are needed to confirm these results. Further studies to address the adverse effects of repellents are needed. Nonrepellent- and noninsecticide-based arthropod bite-resistant textiles are currently commercially available; these and other textiles developed in the future should be tested for effectiveness against ticks as a nonchemical-based option for prevention of tick bites.\n\n(C) Removal of Attached Ticks\n\nRecommendations\n\nWe recommend promptly removing attached ticks by mechanical means using a clean fine-tipped tweezer (or a comparable device) inserted between the tick body and the skin (good practice statement).\n\nWe recommend against burning an attached tick (with a match or other heat device) or applying noxious chemicals or petroleum products to coax its detachment (good practice statement).\n\nSummary of the Evidence\n\nDuration of tick attachment is among the most important predictors of subsequent Lyme disease. Experimental studies in animals have established that there is a time delay between the onset of tick feeding and transmission of B. burgdorferi that occurs after 36–48 hours of attachment. Thus, performing tick checks after exposure and promptly removing any attached Ixodes spp. ticks is a potentially effective means to prevent Lyme disease. There are many devices available to help extract ticks, and proper removal requires grasping and pulling the mouthparts at the closest point of attachment to the skin (see Figure 5) [107–110]. The probability of transmission, however, will be reduced even if the tick inadvertently is crushed or squeezed during removal [109]. If a tick is partially removed, but detached mouthparts remain and cannot easily be removed from the skin, they should be left alone and permitted to fall out. Nonmechanical means of tick removal, such as applying chemicals, petroleum products, or heat may cause the tick to regurgitate and potentially increase the risk of pathogen transmission.\n\nIn animal laboratory experiments, the probability of B. burgdorferi transmission increases the longer the tick has been attached and feeding. In 4 studies in which laboratory animals each were exposed to a single infected I. scapularis nymph, no transmission occurred within 24 hours, and the majority of animals became infected ≥48 hours of attachment [109, 112–115]. A mathematical model [114] applied to the combined data from two experiments [113, 114] further estimated that infection did not occur before 36–40 hours of attachment, and that 50% of infected nymphs transmitted B. burgdorferi by 68 hours of attachment. The transmission of B. mayonii to laboratory animals using single infected nymphs occurred after 48 hours of attachment [112, 116].\n\nEarly studies had documented rare transmission of B. burgdorferi <24 hours and within 24–37 hours of tick attachment [115, 117, 118]. In these studies, however, multiple infected I. scapularis nymphs were simultaneously placed on laboratory animals, a scenario that is relevant for enzootic transmission to animals but less so for transmission to humans [112]. Even in these studies, however, infection within the first 24 hours of tick attachment is not guaranteed [112]. Transmission to mice exposed to multiple infected I. pacificus nymphs did not occur <24 hours of feeding but was detected by 48 hours of feeding [119]. Similarly, when multiple infected adult female I. scapularis were fed simultaneously on animals, no transmission was detected at 24 or 36 hours of attachment but only at 48 hours [120].\n\nFor prevention of tick-borne diseases, it is important to remember that other pathogens vectored by Ixodes spp. ticks may require less attachment time to infect a host. For animals exposed to a single infected tick, Powassan virus may be transmitted within 15 minutes of attachment [121] and Anaplasma phagocytophilum [113] and B. miyamotoi [122] within 24 hours. For Babesia microti, the only study that used single infected ticks did not measure transmission at time points prior to 54 hours, by which time 72% of animals were infected [123]. Although a study where animals were exposed to multiple infected ticks detected transmission of B. microti by 36 hours, transmission primarily occurred after 48 hours of attachment [124].\n\nObservations from 2 European epidemiological studies in which tick engorgement levels were measured suggest that transmission of B. burgdorferi sensu lato may occur within 24 hours of attachment of I. ricinis ticks [125, 126]. It is unclear whether differences in the tick or Borrelia species may be responsible for the faster transmission rate. Travel history therefore may further inform anticipatory guidance.\n\nRationale for Recommendations\n\nPrompt detection and removal of an attached tick can reduce the likelihood of pathogen transmission and therefore disease. Proper removal of the intact tick is best achieved by mechanical means.\n\nII. Which diagnostic tests should be used following a tick bite?\n\n(A) Diagnostic Tick Testing\n\nRecommendations\n\nWe recommend submitting the removed tick for species identification (good practice statement).\n\nWe recommend against testing a removed Ixodes tick for B. burgdorferi (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Comment: The presence or absence of B. burgdorferi in an Ixodes tick removed from a person does not reliably predict the likelihood of clinical infection.\n\nSummary of the Evidence\n\nKnowing tick characteristics (ie, species, life stage, and an assessment of the degree of blood engorgement) is helpful for anticipatory guidance and in determining if antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent Lyme disease is appropriate [127]. Tick identification is available in most commercial laboratories and at some local health departments. Studies from the United States and Europe have shown that detecting B. burgdorferi sensu lato in Ixodes spp. ticks, however, poorly predicts either subsequent disease (0–12.4%) [126, 128–133] or asymptomatic seroconversion (0–4.7%) [126, 129, 130, 132, 134]. This is likely due to a variety of factors that influence the likelihood of transmission and the observation that most Ixodes spp. ticks discovered by patients have been attached for <48 hours [61, 62, 135].\n\nRationale for Recommendations\n\nBecause different tick species transmit different pathogens, tick identification by a qualified expert or laboratory would inform patient counseling about early signs of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. Patients should be given anticipatory guidance so that a prompt diagnosis of Lyme disease (as well as other relevant tick-borne infections) can be made should symptoms develop. In contrast, testing ticks for B. burgdorferi may lead to unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions in patients who would not go on to develop Lyme disease. Even in areas that are highly endemic for Lyme disease, where >20% of nymphal ticks and >50% of adult ticks are infected with B. burgdorferi, mathematical models estimate that individuals presenting with an Ixodes spp. tick bite have a low probability of developing Lyme disease (2.5–4.6% [113, 114];), even if the tick tests positive.\n\nKnowledge Gaps\n\nEducation about tick identification and estimates of engorgement levels would help treatment decisions and anticipatory guidance, especially as different tick species transmit different pathogens. Development of technical aides (eg, smartphone applications) to provide image-based identification services may further facilitate timely and accurate tick identification and even estimates of feeding duration. Such information may also help physicians learn about the local tick species. Studies are needed to evaluate whether accurate tick identification improves patient outcomes.\n\n(B) Diagnostic Testing of Asymptomatic Patients Following Tick Bites\n\nRecommendation\n\nWe recommend against testing asymptomatic patients for exposure to B. burgdorferi following an Ixodes spp. tick bite (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).\n\nSummary of the Evidence\n\nFollowing the removal of an Ixodes spp. tick, asymptomatic patients would have negative serologic tests for B. burgdorferi unless the patient had a prior infection. Notably, the background seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi in a highly endemic Lyme disease area was 5% in the mid-1990s [136] and is now even higher, even doubled, in some Lyme disease endemic regions [137, 138]. Although follow-up testing 4–6 weeks after the tick bite could detect an asymptomatic seroconversion, we recommend against testing as there is insufficient evidence that patients with asymptomatic seropositivity should receive antibiotic therapy.\n\nRationale for Recommendation\n\nSerologic testing of asymptomatic patients following a tick bite does not help with treatment decisions. There is currently insufficient evidence that asymptomatic patients with positive serologic tests should receive antibiotic therapy. Available data suggest that patients with asymptomatic seropositivity are much less likely to develop disseminated Lyme disease than are untreated patients with erythema migrans [139–141]. Moreover, a positive serologic test for Lyme disease near the time of a tick bite most likely represents past exposure or a false positive, as a newly acquired infection would not yet have prompted antibody generation.\n\nKnowledge Gaps\n\nLongitudinal studies are needed to better understand the long-term outcomes of tick bites in seropositive patients who are asymptomatic.\n\nIII. Who should receive antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent Lyme disease following presentation with a tick bite?\n\nRecommendation\n\nWe recommend that prophylactic antibiotic therapy be given only to adults and children within 72 hours of removal of an identified high-risk tick bite, but not for bites that are equivocal risk or low risk (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Comment: If a tick bite cannot be classified with a high level of certainty as a high-risk bite, a wait-and-watch approach is recommended. A tick bite is considered to be high-risk only if it meets the following three criteria: the tick bite was from (a) an identified Ixodes spp. vector species, (b) it occurred in a highly endemic area, and (c) the tick was attached for ≥36 hours.\n\nSummary of the Evidence\n\nThe likelihood of Lyme disease following a tick bite is associated with several factors, including the infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi among questing nymphal Ixodes spp. ticks in the region of exposure [142]. In highly endemic areas of the northeastern, the middle Atlantic, and the north-central United States, nymphal I. scapularis infection prevalence exceeds 20% [64, 66, 143]. Using reported Lyme disease incidence data, the CDC classifies states as i) high incidence, ii) neighboring high incidence states (and thus with presumed elevated risk), and iii) low incidence [56] (for the most recent maps and data, see: https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/maps-recent.html). As a caveat, within a low-incidence state, some areas can be highly endemic for B. burgdorferi [64, 143] and Lyme disease [72, 74]; conversely, within a high incidence state, there are areas with lower levels of infection prevalence [143]. Similarly, because the infection prevalence among I. pacificus ticks often is <20% [66, 144], their bites generally are not considered high-risk, but some areas with >20% nymphal infection prevalence exist [144, 145]. To determine whether an Ixodes spp. tick bite comes from a highly endemic area, clinicians should consult state health agency Lyme disease risk maps depicting tick infection prevalence, if available.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the duration of tick attachment (see Figure 6) is among the most important predictors of subsequent Lyme disease. Unfed (ie, flat) and recently attached ticks do not pose a significant risk for B. burgdorferi transmission. The likelihood of transmission increases with duration of attachment in both laboratory mice and patients as the majority of transmission occurs after 36–48 hours of attachment [109, 113–115, 117]. Clinical studies [133, 146] have described a positive association between duration of tick attachment (over vs under 72 hours) and clinical signs of Lyme disease or seroconversion. In this high-risk scenario, the likelihood of subsequent Lyme disease has varied across studies, but the risk may exceed 20% when a tick has been attached for ≥72 hours [133]. A meta-analysis of 4 studies [147] pooling both high- and low-risk tick bites reported that administration of prophylactic antibiotics within 72 hours of removal of an attached tick reduced the risk of subsequent Lyme disease from 2.2% to 0.2%. After a lower risk exposure, such as a brief duration of tick attachment (ie, <36 hours) or exposure in regions with low Lyme disease incidence, the absolute risk of Lyme disease will be decreased, and therefore the benefit of prophylactic antibiotics will be decreased as well.\n\nRationale for Recommendation\n\nFor high-risk tick bites, we have weighed the likelihood of disease and the effectiveness of prophylactic doxycycline therapy to be higher than the potential risks of the antibiotic. For ticks that have not been identified as an Ixodes spp. vector species or are Ixodes spp. but do not meet high-risk criteria, the risk of adverse reactions from antibiotic exposure may not be matched by a likely benefit. Because of uncertainty about the safety of doxycycline in pregnancy, we advise pregnant women to have an informed discussion with their physicians about the risks, benefits, and uncertainties of antibiotic treatment versus observation.\n\nRegardless of whether antibiotic prophylaxis is given, clinicians should counsel patients about the symptoms and signs of local Ixodes spp.-borne infections. First, prophylaxis with doxycycline does not guarantee infection avoidance. For instance, data from a laboratory animal study [149] suggest that mitigation of transmission by oral doxycycline is most successful when taken soon after tick removal. Thus, patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they develop an expanding erythematous lesion at the site of the tick bite or other skin sites, fever, or any other unexplained illnesses, particularly within 30 days of the tick bite. Second, I. scapularis ticks may transmit pathogens causing other diseases, including anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and ehrlichiosis, for which systematic data supporting postexposure antibiotic prophylaxis currently do not exist.\n\nKnowledge Gaps\n\nA limitation of this recommendation is the reliable and timely determination of a tick bite as a high-risk tick bite. Accurate identification of a tick species may be challenging, especially as the tick feeds. The determination of the timing of the bite by history is often unreliable [62, 133]. An examination of the scutal index (a measure of engorgement used to estimate the duration of attachment) of Ixodes spp. ticks attached to patients in a highly endemic region over 17 years found that >40% did not meet the high-risk criteria [127]. Prescription of an antibiotic would not be indicated for these bites. Thus, research is needed to develop methods to deliver reliable and timely information about the tick bite to the clinician, including the feasibility of training laboratory personnel in the measurement of the scutal index and the development and testing of point-of-care technical aides for tick identification and measurement of engorgement levels. The ability to accurately identify tick species and engorgement level will likely become even more significant in the future as blacklegged tick populations expand, and as the geographic distributions of blacklegged and other tick species increasingly overlap.\n\nInfection prevalence, as well as strain diversity, of B. burgdorferi among I. scapularis ticks can be locally and regionally variable [64, 66, 143, 150, 151]. This contributes to considerable variability in the risk of Lyme disease following a tick bite, with the expected benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis to be greatest in areas with high disease risk and to diminish with decreasing risk. Longitudinal disease and tick surveillance therefore are needed to monitor how disease risk is changing over time, especially as infected tick populations continue to spread into areas without known previous disease risk [56, 64, 65]. Through their Tick Surveillance Program, the CDC provides guidance and support to public health agencies for conducting active surveillance for Ixodes spp. tick and associated pathogens to provide accurate and current data for healthcare providers on the local risk of Lyme and other diseases [152]. Resources are needed, however, for such surveillance to be conducted on a regular and spatially relevant basis. Clinical studies to evaluate the utility of chemoprophylaxis to prevent other I. scapularis-borne pathogens are needed.\n\nIV. What is the preferred antibiotic regimen for the chemoprophylaxis of Lyme disease following a high-risk tick bite?\n\nRecommendation\n\nFor high-risk Ixodes spp. bites in all age groups, we recommend the administration of a single dose of oral doxycycline within 72 hours of tick removal over observation (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Comment: Doxycycline is given as a single oral dose, 200 mg for adults and 4.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 200 mg) for children.\n\nSummary of the Evidence\n\nFour placebo-controlled clinical trials, all conducted in areas endemic for Lyme disease, are included for review (see Evidence Profile Tables IV) [147]. Most of the included trials recruited both adults and children; 1 trial recruited only children [153]. Two potential dosing alternatives have been studied in this setting: a single dose of doxycycline (200 mg × 1 dose) [146] and 10-day course of other antibiotics (tetracycline [1000 mg/day] [153], penicillin [1000 mg/day] [129], and amoxicillin [750 mg/day]) [132]. There has been no direct comparison between β-lactams and tetracyclines; each has been compared to a placebo. Among 1082 randomized subjects, the risk of developing Lyme disease in the placebo group was 3.0%. Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the risk of developing Lyme disease compared with placebo (relative risk [RR]: 0.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] (.10, .75); absolute risk: 22 fewer per 1000, 95% CI (7 to 27 fewer per 1000)). Although there were no serious adverse effects from the antibiotics in any of the studies, drug rashes and gastrointestinal side effects were observed.\n\nRationale for Recommendation\n\nThe doxycycline single-dose regimen is preferred due to its efficacy, ease of use, and a relatively low risk of side effects (see Introduction to Treatment for a more detailed discussion). Single doses of other antibiotics have not been studied, and longer courses may result in additional toxicity. In addition, none of the other antibiotics were shown to be more effective than placebo, but this may have been due to insufficient enrollment of subjects in these studies. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend topical antibiotics to prevent Lyme disease [154, 155]. Despite the paucity of pediatric data, it is prudent to extrapolate the use of single-dose prophylaxis to children because the risk of adverse effects likely would be the same as in persons older than 12 years of age. The caveat that there is no study of the efficacy of doxycycline under age 12 years should be provided to the parent, so they understand that monitoring for symptoms and signs is still important.\n\nKnowledge Gaps\n\nAdditional research is needed to evaluate whether brief courses of amoxicillin and other antibiotics are comparable to doxycycline for the prophylactic treatment of tick bites. Further research is also necessary to assess whether topical antibiotics can prevent Lyme disease.\n\nEarly Lyme Disease (Erythema Migrans)\n\nThe most common clinical manifestation of Lyme disease is an expanding, erythematous, often annular skin lesion referred to as erythema migrans [12, 156–158] (see Figure 7). Erythema migrans occurs at the site of inoculation of B. burgdorferi into the skin by the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. Patients with erythema migrans may have concomitant constitutional symptoms (~65% in the US and ~37% in Europe), such as fatigue, arthralgias, myalgias, and headache [12, 156–158]. After deposition into the skin, the spirochetal bacteria may disseminate in untreated patients to other anatomic sites leading to regional lymphadenopathy, additional erythema migrans skin lesions, certain neurologic and cardiac manifestations, and/or arthritis [156, 158].\n\nV. What is the preferred diagnostic testing strategy for erythema migrans?\n\nRecommendations\n\nIn patients with potential tick exposure in a Lyme disease endemic area who have 1 or more skin lesions compatible with erythema migrans, we recommend clinical diagnosis rather than laboratory testing (strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence).\n\nIn patients with 1 or more skin lesions suggestive of, but atypical for erythema migrans, we suggest antibody testing performed on an acute-phase serum sample (followed by a convalescent-phase serum sample if the initial result is negative) rather than currently available direct detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture performed on blood or skin samples (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Comment: If needed, the convalescent-phase serum sample should be collected at least 2–3 weeks after collection of the acute-phase serum sample.\n\nSummary of the Evidence\n\nMost patients with a single erythema migrans skin lesion are seronegative at the time of initial presentation. Among untreated patients with microbiologically confirmed, solitary erythema migrans lesions, as few as 20% are seropositive using conventional 2-tiered antibody testing (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] or indirect fluorescent antibody testing, followed by immunoblotting) performed on an acute-phase serum sample collected within 1 week of noticing the lesion [29, 159, 160]. Acute-phase sensitivity is comparatively higher if the lesion has been present for a longer time period without treatment [29, 159, 161], reaching 86% in the 4th week of illness [159] or in patients presenting with multiple erythema migrans skin lesions [21, 159, 162].\n\nIn a study directly comparing antibody testing with various direct detection methods in patients with a clinical diagnosis of solitary or multiple erythema migrans skin lesions (mean duration of illness >1 week), the most sensitive method in the acute-phase of illness, prior to antibiotic administration, was real-time PCR performed on skin biopsy samples of the lesion (80.9%) [163]. The least sensitive method was conventional 2-tiered antibody testing performed on acute-phase serum samples (40.4%). Intermediate sensitivity was demonstrated using culture of 2 mm skin biopsy samples (51.1%) and high-volume (≥9 mL) plasma culture with growth detection by microscopy (44.7%). Subsequent investigations demonstrated that the sensitivity of high-volume plasma culture might exceed 70% if growth detection is performed using real-time PCR [164, 165].\n\nStudies involving skin biopsy culture of untreated erythema migrans lesions have typically reported a diagnostic sensitivity of approximately 40–60% [163, 165–174] with some reporting lower yield [175–178] and a few reporting sensitivity exceeding 70% [179–182]. When skin biopsy culture has been directly compared with PCR performed on skin biopsy samples, the latter has generally been more sensitive, although this depends on the exact methods used and the reverse has also been reported [163, 165, 167, 169, 171–177]. The yield of plasma or whole-blood PCR is comparable to the yield of high volume plasma culture using growth detection by microscopy, with reported sensitivities mostly in the 30–50% range in the United States [165, 175, 183–185], although substantially lower yields have been reported [186, 187]. PCR sensitivity varies according to the specific technique, and the application of multiple PCR assays to the same sample can improve sensitivity [165].\n\nRationale for Recommendations\n\nIn untreated patients with erythema migrans of short duration (2 weeks or less), none of the currently available serologic or direct detection tests for Lyme disease is sufficiently sensitive for accurate diagnostic use, necessitating clinical diagnosis. However, in patients with skin lesions that are atypical for erythema migrans, laboratory testing may aid in the diagnostic assessment [188]. In such cases, if the patient will not be treated empirically with antimicrobial therapy, the most practical approach is to perform serologic testing on an acute-phase serum sample or (if initial results are negative) on paired samples collected at least 2–3 weeks apart. An alternative (or supplement) to paired serologic testing is to attempt direct detection of B. burgdorferi in the skin lesion or blood. These methods offer the possibility of more timely diagnosis; direct detection methods are generally more sensitive at the time of initial clinical presentation with erythema migrans, compared with acute-phase (single sample) serologic testing. However, practical matters (described below) limit their use and availability; recognition of these limitations has informed our testing recommendations.\n\nThe most potentially useful direct detection method is real-time PCR for B. burgdorferi performed on a skin punch biopsy of at least 2-mm diameter, taken from the margin of the skin lesion. This method offers higher sensitivity compared with other direct detection or serologic testing methods, and turnaround time can be relatively short. However, the need for a skin biopsy is a limiting factor because many primary or urgent care settings may not offer this procedure, requiring referral to a dermatologist. Furthermore, real-time PCR for B. burgdorferi is not standardized and is typically available only at large reference laboratories, in part because currently there are no FDA-cleared molecular assays. Shipping samples to a reference laboratory increases turnaround time, often by several days.\n\nCulture of skin biopsy samples or high-volume plasma samples may approach the sensitivity of skin PCR, but B. burgdorferi culture is rarely available, even at large referral centers. In addition, cultures require long incubation periods, sometimes exceeding 8 weeks. The use of B. burgdorferi PCR directly on blood samples is substantially less sensitive compared with PCR performed on skin lesion samples.\n\nVI. What are the preferred antibiotic regimens for the treatment of erythema migrans?\n\nRecommendation\n\nFor patients with erythema migrans, we recommend using oral antibiotic therapy with doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil (strong recommendation; moderate quality of evidence). Comment: For patients unable to take both doxycycline and beta-lactam antibiotics, the preferred second-line agent is azithromycin.\n\nSummary of the Evidence\n\nEvidence for this recommendation is based on both US and European studies, because the Borrelia species involved in both locations are similarly susceptible to antimicrobials in in vitro studies [189, 190]. Although erythema migrans will resolve without antibiotic treatment, evidence indicates that the currently used antibiotic regimens will lead to faster resolution of the skin lesion and associated symptoms and will effectively prevent the development of disseminated manifestations of Lyme disease (eg, Lyme arthritis) [140, 191, 192]. Based on clinical trial data and on in vitro susceptibility testing data, the 3 widely used oral antibiotics in North America, doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil, appear to have similar efficacy for the treatment of patients with erythema migrans (see Evidence Profile Tables VI) [193–202]. Clinical experience and clinical trial data in Europe exclusively suggest comparable clinical efficacy of penicillin VK compared with amoxicillin or doxycycline, although more clarity on the optimal dosage would be desirable [193].\n\nAzithromycin has been found to be effective clinically and of comparable efficacy to comparators for patients with erythema migrans in all clinical trials conducted to date except for 1 (see Evidence Profile Tables VI) [3, 194, 203–209]. The explanation for the worse outcomes reported in 1 trial comparing azithromycin with amoxicillin conducted in the United States is unclear [3]. This trial was a randomized, double-blind study, and no similar study on the efficacy of azithromycin for erythema migrans has been conducted subsequently in the United States. Methodologic issues may explain the differences in results, particularly because 14% of the enrolled subjects may have had the southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) rather than Lyme disease [210]. Although the authors stated that exclusion of these particular subjects did not affect the overall response rates for each treatment group, they did not provide results of these sensitivity analyses [3]. Because of results from that study, however, azithromycin is often considered to be a second-line agent in North America to be used for patients who cannot safely take beta-lactam or tetracycline antibiotics [156, 158].\n\nFor patients with suspicion of early Lyme disease presenting as an acute febrile illness without an erythema migrans skin lesion, the same antibiotic regimens as used for patients with erythema migrans should be effective, but there is a lack of systematic studies to support this opinion.\n\nRationale for Recommendation\n\nGiven the comparable efficacy of doxycycline, amoxicillin, and cefuroxime axetil, factors [200] other than efficacy should be considered in the selection of which oral antibiotic to prescribe for the treatment of patients in North America with erythema migrans (see Table 5). Although the AAP recommends doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil for the treatment of erythema migrans in children of any age, some clinicians would reserve doxycycline for young children who are unable to tolerate beta-lactam antibiotics given the limited evidence basis for its safety [211, 212]. The decision to use doxycycline to treat erythema migrans in young children, pregnant women [42, 43] and breastfeeding women who wish to continue breastfeeding and have no contraindication to beta-lactam antibiotics should be individualized and made with careful deliberation (also see also the Treatment of Lyme Disease discussion in the General Principle section above).\n\nKnowledge Gaps\n\nAdditional studies conducted in the United States on the efficacy of penicillin VK, azithromycin, and clarithromycin [213, 214] for treating patients with erythema migrans, and studies comparing twice daily with 3 times daily dosing of amoxicillin are warranted. Additional studies should be performed to better define the optimal dose of penicillin VK. Studies on how to properly diagnose and treat patients with early Lyme disease presenting as an acute febrile illness without erythema migrans should be performed. Further study is needed to establish the safety profile of doxycycline in children and in pregnant and lactating women.\n\nVII. How long should a patient with erythema migrans be treated?\n\nRecommendation\n\nWe recommend that patients with erythema migrans be treated with either a 10-day course of doxycycline or a 14-day course of amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil rather than longer treatment courses (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Comment: If azithromycin is used, the indicated duration is 5–10 days, with a 7-day course preferred in the United States, as this duration of therapy was used in the largest clinical trial performed in the United States [3].\n\nSummary of the Evidence\n\nDifferent durations of antibiotic therapy with doxycycline or beta-lactam antibiotics have been evaluated in the treatment of patients with erythema migrans ranging from a 5-day course of therapy to 21 days (See Evidence Profile Tables VII) [3, 46, 47, 156, 157, 191, 193–199, 202–209, 214–229]. Duration of treatment with azithromycin in clinical studies has varied from 5 to 10 days [3, 203–209]. Typically, the 5-day regimens have included 6 doses, with 2 doses taken on day 1. No difference in outcomes has been associated with the duration of therapy, as demonstrated by several studies comparing the same antibiotic used for different durations. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of patients with erythema migrans showed equivalent efficacy of 10 days compared with 20 days of doxycycline therapy [222]. Another prospective study showed similar efficacy of 10 days compared with 15 days of doxycycline for patients with erythema migrans [221]. The shorter course of azithromycin therapy is indicated because the drug has a prolonged tissue half-life.\n\nRationale for Recommendation\n\nShorter durations of antibiotic exposure may reduce adverse effects and cost.\n\nVIII. Should patients with the southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) be treated with antibiotics?\n\nRecommendation\n\nIn patients who develop an erythema migrans-like skin lesion following the bite of the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum), an illness referred to as STARI, we make no recommendation for or against the use of antibiotics (no recommendation; knowledge gap). Comment: In certain geographic regions both STARI and Lyme disease are endemic [4]. Distinguishing single erythema migrans due to Lyme disease from STARI may not be possible clinically unless the responsible tick has been identified [5]. When STARI cannot be distinguished from Lyme disease-associated erythema migrans in areas endemic for both conditions, antibiotic therapy directed toward Lyme disease is indicated.\n\nSummary of the Evidence\n\nSTARI has been reported predominantly in the southeastern and south-central United States, where the lone star tick is the most abundant human-biting tick. Lone star ticks are not able to transmit B. burgdorferi [230–234]. To date, no infectious agent has been identified in STARI patients [210, 235–239], except in 1 instance, where B. lonestari was detected by PCR in a sample of the skin lesion and also detected in the lone star tick that had bitten the patient [240]. Recent data suggest that STARI and Lyme disease-associated erythema migrans produce different host metabolic biosignatures [241]. There are no known extracutaneous sequelae associated with STARI, though few untreated patient case histories have been reported [242]. It remains unknown whether antibiotic treatment of STARI patients affords clinical benefit and, if so ,which antibiotics would be useful.\n\nIn geographic areas where Lyme disease is rare or nonendemic and there are abundant lone star ticks, physicians and patients may choose observation rather than antibiotic treatment for erythema migrans [4, 242]. This decision should be guided by both patient and physician preferences. The decision to observe should be accompanied by patient counseling about the manifestations of Lyme disease, and the importance of prompt evaluation should any of these manifestations arise.\n\nRationale for Recommendation\n\nThere are insufficient data to provide a recommendation for or against antibiotic treatment for a proven case of STARI, an illness of unknown etiology.\n\nKnowledge Gaps\n\nAdditional studies are needed to determine the etiology of STARI and to establish whether or not antibiotic therapy improves the rate of resolution of the skin lesion and associated symptoms.\n\nNeurologic Lyme Disease\n\nIt is helpful to consider nervous system Lyme disease (Lyme neuroborreliosis) in 2 dimensions—anatomic and temporal. Anatomically, disorders may affect the peripheral (PNS) or central (CNS) nervous systems. PNS involvement includes cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis, plexopathies, mononeuropathy, and mononeuropathy multiplex. CNS disorders can be divided into those affecting the subarachnoid space (meningitis, raised intracranial pressure) and the parenchyma of the brain or spinal cord (encephalitis, myelitis). It is important to note that patients with Lyme disease but without parenchymal CNS infection with B. burgdorferi may, as in many other systemic inflammatory disorders, have associated alterations of concentration, memory, and cognitive function, a state referred to as Lyme encephalopathy. In the absence of focal CNS abnormalities clinically or on imaging studies, this is generally not indicative of encephalitis.\n\nTemporally, Lyme neuroborreliosis can be divided into early and late manifestations. Early Lyme neuroborreliosis includes meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis, and more rarely encephalomyelitis, typically has an onset over hours to days, and occurs in the first few months of infection. Later in infection, Lyme neuroborreliosis may similarly involve the PNS or CNS but have a more indolent evolution. Pathophysiologically, there is probably little difference between early and late Lyme neuroborreliosis.\n\nIX. What is the preferred diagnostic testing strategy for Lyme neuroborreliosis?\n\nRecommendations\n\nWhen assessing patients for possible Lyme neuroborreliosis involving either the PNS or central nervous system (CNS), we recommend serum antibody testing rather than PCR or culture of either cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum (strong recommendation, moderate-quality of evidence).\n\nIf CSF testing is performed in patients with suspected Lyme neuroborreliosis involving the CNS, we (a) recommend obtaining simultaneous samples of CSF and serum for determination of the CSF:serum antibody index, carried out by a laboratory using validated methodology, (b) recommend against CSF serology without measurement of the CSF:serum antibody index, and (c) recommend against routine PCR or culture of CSF or serum (strong recommendation, moderate-quality of evidence).\n\nSummary of the Evidence\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that most patients with early Lyme neuroborreliosis are seropositive by conventional 2-tiered testing at the time of initial clinical presentation [21, 162, 243–245]. Neurological manifestations typically develop several weeks after initial infection, which is usually sufficient time for the development of a detectable serum antibody response. Occasionally, patients with early Lyme neuroborreliosis are seronegative at the time of initial clinical presentation [245]. In some—but not all—of these cases, antibody reactivity is detectable using a first-tier test (EIA or IFA), but the antibody response has not yet expanded enough to meet Western blot interpretive criteria for a positive second-tier result. Such patients are often seropositive using modified 2-tiered testing protocols (see Diagnostic Testing discussion in the General Principles section) [246–249]. Infected patients who are initially seronegative are typically strongly seropositive on repeat testing several weeks later.\n\nDemonstration of intrathecal antibody production directed against B. burgdorferi, with an elevated CSF:serum antibody index, is a highly specific finding for Lyme neuroborreliosis with CNS involvement. The index, however, may remain elevated for years following successful treatment [6, 250, 251]. Notably, active CNS (but not necessarily PNS) Lyme neuroborreliosis is usually accompanied by a CSF lymphocytic/monocytic pleocytosis, supporting a diagnosis of active CNS infection.
