        "text": "ABSTRACT\n\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major health burden in patients with cancer, causing morbidity, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and death. Treatment is challenging, as it is necessary to balance the risk of recurrent thrombosis and bleeding associated with anticoagulants. Treatment paradigms are shifting from low-molecular-weight heparin monotherapy. Multiple recent randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants in this setting. Current studies are evaluating factor XI inhibitors as potential treatments for cancer-associated VTE.\n\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) events, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and visceral vein thrombosis, are common in patients with cancer and can have significant consequences. In a study of 4,466 patients with cancer, thromboembolism (including VTE and arterial events) was reported to be the second major cause of death (tied with infection), after cancer itself.1 A recent large registry study showed higher rates of mortality, recurrent VTE, and bleeding in patients with active cancer when compared with patients with a history of cancer or no cancer.2 Sharman Moser et al3 compared patients with cancer with and without VTE and found those with VTE were more likely to be hospitalized (81.4% vs 35.2%), had longer hospital stays (20.1 days vs 13.1 days), and were more likely to visit the emergency room (41.5% vs 19.3%). Studies have shown a 39.5% increase in total healthcare costs in ambulatory patients with lung cancer and VTE,4 as well as increased healthcare utilization, a 3-fold increase in the rate of hospitalization, and an annual increase in per-patient cost of approximately $29,000 for recurrent VTE.5\n\nThe pathogenesis of the thrombophilic state in patients with cancer is distinct from that in populations without cancer and is multifactorial.6,7 Tumor cells can interact with host cells including endothelial cells, neutrophils, platelets, and monocytes. They promote the release of procoagulant factors and inflammatory cytokines that mediate endothelial dysfunction, including tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-8.6 Certain factors also activate the coagulation cascade and remodel fibrin clot formation.7â€“9 Certain types of cancer can lead to leukocytosis and increased generation of neutrophil extracellular traps that capture and activate platelets, increase tissue factor activity, and secrete proteinases that promote metastasis. Another mechanism is cancer-associated thrombocytosis.6,7,10\n\nDISCLOSURES\n\nDr. Khorana has disclosed consulting for Anthos, BMS, Bayer, Genzyme/ Sanofi, and Pfizer, Inc; and consulting research for Anthos as principal or coinvestigator of funded research. The other author reports no relevant financial relationships which, in the context of her contributions, could be perceived as a potential conflict of interest."
