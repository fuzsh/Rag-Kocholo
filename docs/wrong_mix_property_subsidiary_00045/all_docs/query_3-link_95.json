Sensitive methods to quantify podocyte GL3 content may determine whether a given strategy can benefit podocytes in Fabry disease. We developed an unbiased electron microscopic stereological method to estimate the average volume of podocytes and their GL3 inclusions in 6 paired pre- and post-enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) biopsies from 5 men with Fabry disease. Podocyte GL3 content was regularly reduced (average 73%) after 11–12 months of ERT. This was not detectable using a semi-quantitative approach. Parallel to GL3 reduction, podocytes became remarkably smaller (average 63%). These reductions in podocyte GL3 content or size were not significantly correlated with changes in foot process width (FPW). However, FPW after ERT was significantly correlated with the magnitude of the decrease in podocyte GL3 content from baseline to 11–12 months of ERT. Also podocytes exocytosed GL3 inclusions, a phenomenon correlated with their reduction in their GL3 content. Demonstrable after11–12 months, reduction in podocyte GL3 content allows for early assessment of treatment efficacy and shorter clinical trials in Fabry disease.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nDeficiency of α-galactosidase A (αGal-A) in Fabry disease leads to the accumulation of its substrates, mainly globotriaosylceramide (GL3) in various cell types and organs [1], often eventuating in severe complications including strokes, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, neuropathy, renal failure and premature death [2].\n\nWhile enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) eliminates visible GL3 accumulation in kidney endothelial and mesangial cells and fibroblasts within 5 months [3], podocytes, distal tubular cells and arteriolar smooth muscle cells are more resistant to ERT[3,4]. Although a long-term randomized placebo controlled ERT trial demonstrated reduced serious clinical events [5], there are substantial residual risks despite ERT [6]. Histological treatment responses have been important endpoints for clinical trials [3,7]. Studies of benefits of new treatments for patients already on ERT will need to focus on more resistant cells because endothelial GL3 clearance, the original criterion for ERT efficacy, will not be an available endpoint since GL3 clearance from these cells by ERT is essentially complete. Trials with hard endpoints would be of such long duration and size as to be impractical. Thus, the availability of structural endpoints that are sensitive early indicators of Fabry disease treatment efficacy and predictors of residual risk would be of substantial clinical significance.\n\nThe podocyte is an important candidate in this regard. There is a dose-dependent benefit of 5 years of ERT on podocyte damage [8]. Critical for preventing urinary protein loss [9], podocyte depletion is implicated in glomerular scarring [10]. In young ERT-naïve Fabry disease patients the fraction of the volume of podocyte cytoplasm occupied by GL3 inclusions [Vv(Inc/PC)] increases with age, but not so in endothelial or mesangial cells [11]. Since the risk of Fabry disease complications is highly age-dependent [6,12], cells with no age-dependent progressive damage are less likely to contribute to progressive organ dysfunction. This has important implications for the selection of tissue treatment endpoints in clinical studies. Proteinuria is a strong Fabry nephropathy risk predictor. [6] Vv(Inc/PC) correlated with podocyte foot process width (FPW) [11], an indicator of podocyte injury [13], and both FPW and Vv(Inc/PC) correlated with urinary protein excretion in these young patients [11]. Although subjective light microscopic scoring systems detected reductions in podocyte GL3 after several years of ERT[4,8], earlier benefits are difficult to demonstrate using such methods. [3] To facilitate Fabry disease clinical trials of practical length and to allow earlier assessments of treatment efficacy, it is important to develop more sensitive assessments of changes in podocyte GL3. A scoring system for podocyte GL3 inclusions was developed by the International Study Group for Fabry Nephropathy (ISGFN). [14] Using a similar scoring system experienced observers could not detect increasing podocyte GL3 with increasing age [15,16] while morphometric measures of Vv(Inc/PC) using many of these same and a few additional biopsies elucidated robust correlations with age. [11] We posited that the failure to detect ERT benefits on podocyte GL3 could be methodological. If the total amount of GL3 per podocyte were diminished and, there was a parallel decrease in average podocyte volume, observers’ scores would not likely change as this method is insensitive to cell volume changes. This is termed ‘the reference trap’[16,17] whereby changes in the reference volume, e.g., mean podocyte volume could confound the estimate of per podocyte GL3 burden (Fig 1). Applying novel morphometric methods to test this hypothesis we determined that 11–12 months of ERT regularly decreased GL3 inclusion volume/podocyte [V(Inc/PC)], based entirely on decreased podocyte volume, since GL3 inclusions as a fraction of podocyte cytoplasmic volume [Vv(Inc/PC)] was unchanged.\n\nWhile the podocyte on the left loses 50% of its GL3 content, because of a proportional (50%) shrinkage in podocyte cytoplasmic volume, the fraction of the volume of the podocyte cytoplasm filled with GL3 [Vv(Inc/PC)] remains the same (the cell on the right).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0152812.g001\n\nDiscussion\n\nAgalsidase beta [Fabrazyme® (Genzyme, a Sanofi Company)], at 1 mg/kg/every other week (EOH) for 11–12 months in previously ERT-naïve Fabry disease patients uniformly decreased the total per podocyte GL3 burden. This benefit, detected using systematic unbiased electron microscopic sampling and validated morphometric methods, was not regularly seen using semi-quantitative methods in studies that included these same [3] or longer term [4] follow-up in adults with Fabry disease. Thus, after 11 months of ERT 1mg/kg/EOH, using a 0 to 4+ light microscopic semiquantitative GL3 scoring system in plastic embedded sections, there was a reduction in podocyte scoring in only 18% of 17 patients. [3] Five of the 6 patients in the current report were, in fact, derived from this agalsidase beta study. Perhaps this discrepancy should not be surprising since the fraction of the podocyte cytoplasm occupied by GL3 [Vv(Inc/PC)] was unchanged in the follow-up biopsies in the present study, this primarily what is estimated by semi-quantitative subjective scoring. [14] The decreased per podocyte GL3 burden reported here was associated with a uniform parallel decrease in mean podocyte cytoplasmic volume, i.e., change in a parameter difficult to discern by scoring methods. Our finding that an experienced nephropathologist was unable to detect a significant change in podocyte GL3 using a published scoring system [14] supports this hypothesis. In fact, it was because this ‘reference-trap’ effect was anticipated, that a novel morphometric method to detect changes in podocyte size was developed and applied here. Importantly, increased podocyte volume was described in other pathologic conditions and was related to podocyte stress, apoptosis and loss. [21,22,23]\n\nWe also described podocyte extrusion (exocytosis) of GL3 inclusions into the urinary space and direct correlations between this and podocyte GL3 content and clearance with ERT. Although observed in our limited number of cases, this suggests that GL3 inclusion exocytosis represents a previously unrecognized but important mechanism of podocyte GL3 loss. In fact, podocytes are terminally differentiated cells with little capability to replenish their loss by cell division. [10] Thus, the ability of these cells to clear accumulated GL3 by mechanisms independent of cell division is potentially very important and worthy of further study as means of enhancing this process may provide new treatment options. We previously demonstrated a relationship between GL3 inclusion density and podocyte injury [11]. Thus GL3 inclusion exocytosis may be vital for podocyte protection. Although lysosomes are considered terminal degradative organelles, physiologic excretion of lysosomal contents occurs in multiple cells, including hepatocytes, platelets, and macrophages [24,25,26]. Regulated lysosomal exocytosis has also been described in fibroblasts and epithelial cells [27,28], and in cell membrane repair [29], neuronal regeneration [30,31], and extraction of transition metals from cells [32,33]. Regulated lysosomal exocytosis appears to be Ca2+ dependent [34]. Impairment of endolysosomal trafficking, and thereby, degradation of lysosomal contents through autophagy has been described in other lysosomal storage diseases, including juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, Pompe and Niemann Pick type C disease, multiple sulfatase deficiency and mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA [35,36,37,38,39]. As suggested by the current study, once lysosomal degradation is impaired in lysosomal storage diseases, lysosome exocytosis may become more prominent. Therefore, better understanding of this phenomenon may lead to novel treatments for such diseases. Activation of lysosomal exocytosis by the transcription factor EB (TFEB) promoted cellular clearance in cultured cells from various lysosomal storage disease animal and human models, but Fabry disease was not tested [40]. It is important to explore similar approaches in-vitro and in-vivo in Fabry disease. Podocyte albumin exocytosis probably occurs in nephrotic rats [41], but to our knowledge, direct extrusion of particulate constructs from podocytes into the urinary space has not been previously appreciated. Since podocyte GL3 inclusions increase over time, exocytosis per se, is probably insufficient to prevent progressive podocyte damage. Nevertheless, the relationship between podocyte GL3 inclusion reduction following ERT and exocytosis suggests ERT-induced enhancement of exocytosis as an alternative mechanism of ERT action.\n\nAnother novel finding in relation to podocyte GL3 inclusion extrusion was the unfolding of the multilamellar structure of the inclusions, this reminiscent of unfolding of multilamellar surfactant inclusions upon leaving type II alveolar cells [42]. It will be interesting to explore if mechanisms involved in the physiological exocytosis of surfactant from alveolar cells relate to podocyte GL3 exocytosis. [43].\n\nAlso noteworthy was the regular finding of podocytes with no GL3 inclusions in the post-ERT biopsies,while these were very rare at baseline. Whether this was related to the reduced podocyte GL3 content and random sectioning through cytoplasmic regions without inclusions requires confirmation using 3-dimensional approaches. However, the absence of a relationship between Vv(Inc/PC) and %podocytes without GL3 inclusions at follow-up does not support this possibility. Alternatively, this could reflect regeneration of podocytes that, during ERT, did not accumulate GL3 inclusions, a possibility that could be difficult to prove. It will be important to examine if, with longer-term ERT, podocyte GL3 content keeps reducing and the number of podocytes without GL3 inclusions increases.\n\nIncrease in FPW is an indicator of podocyte stress. Although FPW did not correlate with proteinuria in some conditions,[44,45] marked increases in FPW well beyond what we have observed in Fabry disease have been associated with idiopathic focal segmental sclerosis (FSGS) vs. patients with minimal change nephrotic syndrome [45]. However, we have previously described direct correlations between FPW and urinary protein excretion in diabetic nephropathy [46] and in young persons with Fabry disease [47]. In the present study, It is unclear as to why FPW was not significantly decreased post- ERT by either unbiased morphometry or scoring. One possibility is that subtle decreases in FPW would require larger numbers of patients or longer treatment duration to detect due to sampling variabilities that could make small differences in paired biopsies difficult to detect. Nonetheless. This would be especially true if changes in FPW were more segmental, i.e., less evenly distributed throughout the glomerulus than, for example, in diabetic nephropathy. Nonetheless, FPW at follow-up estimated by morphometry but not by semiquantitative scoring, was strongly inversely correlated with the decrease in podocyte GL3 content from baseline to follow up. These findings, consistent with early reduction in podocyte stress by ERT, require confirmation by additional studies. Although there are no studies of scoring of podocyte effacement after ~1 year of ERT, a longer term study found no change in effacement score in 5 of 7 patients that also had no changes in podocyte GL3 as estimated by scoring. [8] As noted above, we previously demonstrated strong correlations between FPW and age, Vv(Inc/PC) and urine protein/creatinine ratio in young Fabry patients [11], this consistent with the progressive nature of Fabry nephropathy. In contrast, such relationships were undetectable by scoring of podocyte effacement [16]. Thus, as for podocyte GL3 content, systematic unbiased sampling and morphometric measurements are more sensitive than subjective scoring as indicators of change in another important Fabry disease podocyte parameter, FPW. It is possible that refinements in the scoring of FPW would better approximate morphometrically measured FPW and this is worth pursuing.\n\nThere are several reasons for focus on the podocyte as a treatment target in Fabry disease. First, as mentioned, Fabry nephropathy risk increases with age as does Vv(Inc/PC) while endothelial and mesangial cell GL3 fractional volumes do not. [11] Also Vv(Inc/PC) correlates with urinary protein levels [11] and proteinuria is a strong risk predictor for GFR loss in Fabry nephropathy. [6] Finally, endothelial and mesangial cell GL3 inclusions clear completely after brief periods of ERT whereas podocyte GL3 inclusions are much more persistent. [3] Despite endothelial and mesangial cell clearance there are residual risks for Fabry patients on ERT. Since these risks are related to the severity of the proteinuria when ERT is initiated [6], the relatively poor clearance of GL3 from podocytes may be of substantial clinical significance. Thus, effects on podocyte GL3 content may be better than effects on other glomerular cell types as a marker of Fabry disease treatment adequacy and residual risk.\n\nTherapies designed as additions to ongoing ERT will not have endothelial and mesangial cells as treatment readouts as they will be cleared of GL3 inclusions at baseline. [3] In contrast, the incomplete effects of ERT on podocyte GL3 provides opportunities for testing the value of new treatments to supplement ERT. Moreover, using the morphometric methods developed here, such trials could be shorter and require fewer participants than if based on subjective scoring or clinical progression. Finally, the methods outlined here would also be applicable to other important cell types that are relatively resistant to ERT, especially arterial smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes.[3,48,49]\n\nThere may be concern that these morphometric methods are more time consuming and expensive than scoring systems, require special training to perform and are thus not available as routine procedures. While true, these facts should be considered in light of the very high health risks faced by Fabry disease patients, the costs of lifelong ERT approaching $200,000/year, the need for more effective therapies for many patients, and the relatively small Fabry disease patient population. In our view, it is reasonable to consider establishing a few reference laboratories using uniform validated methods for evaluating renal biopsy and other vital tissues affected by Fabry disease. Another approach would be to use quantitative morphometric methods as the ‘gold standard’ in order to refine scoring methods that could be more broadly implemented.\n\nThese studies have some limitations. Greater numbers of paired biopsies in ERT treated Fabry disease patients could allow elucidation of predictors of response such as baseline disease severity, mutation, age, and treatment dose and duration. Also we did not study females. The finding of GL3 negative podocytes in treated males and mosaciasm with GL3 negative podocytes in pre-ERT females [50] would require estimation of numbers of GL3 negative podocytes at baseline and follow-up as well as the separate measurement of podocyte volume and Vv(Inc/PC) in affected cells in such patients. Moreover, such approaches would be required in studies in males of therapies added to ongoing ERT.\n\nIn summary, morphometric studies regularly detected reductions in the absolute volume of GL3 inclusions per podocyte after 11–12 months of ERT at 1 mg/kg/EOH in males with Fabry disease. This was in association with reductions in podocyte size rather than the proportion of GL3 filled podocyte cytoplasm. Some podocytes after ERT had no observable GL3. FPW reduction after ERT correlated with the reduction in podocyte GL3. Extrusion of GL3 inclusions was noted and correlated with the decline in podocyte GL3. This study, which depended on novel methods to estimate changes in mean podocyte volume, requires extension to larger numbers of Fabry disease patients in order to better understand the variables associated with Fabry disease renal injury and treatment response and to design trials based on the podocyte as a key treatment outcome."
