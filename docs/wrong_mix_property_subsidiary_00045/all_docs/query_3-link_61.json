        "text": "Materials. The bisphosphonates used in this study were provided by Gador S.A. (Buenos Aires, Argentina). Bovine calf serum was purchased from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, Utah, USA). FBS was purchased from Summit (Collins, Colorado, USA). Recombinant murine TNF-α was obtained from Genzyme Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA). Phenol red-free αMEM and trypsin-EDTA were purchased from GIBCO BRL (Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA). Etoposide, geneticin (G418), and calf skin collagen type I were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Missouri, USA). Collagenase type 2 was purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corp. (Freehold, New Jersey, USA). PD98059 was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, Massachusetts, USA). U0126 was kindly provided by J.M. Trzaskos (DuPont Merck Research Laboratories, Wilmington, Delaware, USA). The caspase-3 inhibitor Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (DEVD-CHO) was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, USA). DEVD conjugated with 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (DEVD-AFC) was from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (Hercules, California, USA). The mouse mAb anti–phospho-extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), the rabbit polyclonal antibody antiphosphorylated and unphosphorylated ERK1/2, and secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, California, USA). Salmon calcitonin (sCT) was purchased from Bachem California (Torrance, California, USA). 125I was obtained from Amersham Life Sciences Inc. (Arlington Heights, Illinois, USA).\n\nCell culture. The murine long bone–derived osteocytic cell line MLO-Y4 was provided by L. Bonewald (University of Texas Health Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA). Cells were cultured in phenol red-free αMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, 5% bovine calf serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Cells were plated at 1 × 104 to 2 × 104 cells/cm2 on collagen type I–coated plates, as described previously (26). Murine calvaria cells were obtained from neonatal (3- to 6-day-old) C57BL/6J mice by controlled digestion with collagenase, as described previously (27). After isolation, cells were cultured in 10% FBS at 1 × 104 to 2 × 104 cells/cm2 until 90–95% confluence. Subsequently, cells were harvested and frozen for later use. UMR-106-06 cells were cultured in phenol red-free MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% nonessential amino acids, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (28).\n\nEstablishment of MLO-Y4 cells stably transduced with green fluorescent protein. The retroviral vector containing the nuclear green fluorescent protein (GFP) was provided by C. O’Brien (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA). The SV40 large T antigen nuclear localization sequence (29) was attached to the COOH-terminus of the cDNA construct encoding GFP and subcloned into the pLXSN retroviral vector (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, California, USA). The plasmid harboring the retroviral construct was transiently transfected into the packaging cell line Phoenix Eco (30) using SuperFect (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, California, USA). Supernatants containing retroviral particles were collected 24–48 hours after transfection and were used immediately to infect cell cultures. Subconfluent MLO-Y4 osteocytic cells were exposed to viral supernatants in the presence of 8 μg/mL polybrene for 8 hours and then incubated in fresh culture medium for 16 hours. Subsequently, cells were exposed to the supernatants containing the viral particles once more before being trypsinized and plated at low density. Transduced cells were selected by culturing them in the presence of 400 μg/mL of G418 for 3 weeks.\n\nQuantification of apoptotic cells. MLO-Y4 osteocytic cells and calvaria osteoblastic cells were treated for 1 hour in the absence or presence of different BPs or sCT. Subsequently, dexamethasone, etoposide, or TNF-α was added to obtain final concentrations of 10–6 M, 50 μM, or 1 nM, respectively, and cells were incubated for additional 6 hours. The effect of PD98059 (50 μM) or UO126 (1 μM) was evaluated by pretreating the cells with the inhibitors for 30 minutes before adding the BPs or sCT. In the experiment using the membrane permeable caspase inhibitor DEVD, cells were cultured for 1 hour with 50 nM DEVD-CHO, and subsequently the proapoptotic agents were added to reach the final concentrations already indicated here. MLO-Y4 cells stably transduced with nuclear GFP were fixed in neutral buffer formalin for 8 minutes, and apoptosis was assessed by enumerating cells exhibiting chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation under a fluorescent microscope. At least 500 cells from fields selected by systematic random sampling were examined for each experimental condition. For the detection of apoptotic cells using the transferase-mediated biotin-dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) reaction with Klenow terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA), MLO-Y4 cells were cultured with either vehicle or 10–7 M alendronate for 1 hour, and subsequently dexamethasone was added to reach 10–6 M. After 6 hours, cells were fixed in neutral buffer formalin for 10 minutes followed by 80% ethanol for 1 hour. The TUNEL reaction was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using 0.15% CuSO4 for color enhancement. Negative controls were made by omitting the transferase from the reaction. Cells presenting brown nuclear staining were considered positive. More than 500 cells per condition were analyzed. Apoptosis of parental MLO-Y4 or calvaria cells was quantified by trypan blue staining (31). Nonadherent cells were combined with adherent cells released from the culture dish using trypsin-EDTA, resuspended in medium containing serum, and collected by centrifugation. Subsequently, 0.04% trypan blue was added and the percentage of cells exhibiting both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining was determined using a hemocytometer. At least 100 cells per condition were counted.\n\nCaspase-3 activity. Caspase-3 activity was measured by determining the degradation of the fluorometric substrate DEVD, which contains the amino acid sequence of the caspase-3 cleavage site in poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (32), conjugated with DEVD-AFC. Cells were lysed in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 5 μg/mL leupeptin, 0.14 U/mL aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 1% Triton X-100. Protein concentration was measured using a Bio-Rad detergent–compatible kit (Bio-Rad). Lysates (100 μg protein) were incubated with 50 μM DEVD-AFC in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol, in the absence or presence of the irreversible inhibitor DEVD-CHO for 60 minutes. The released fluorescent AFC was measured in a microplate fluorescence reader FL500 (Bio Tek Instruments, Winooski, Vermont, USA) with excitation/emission wavelengths of 340/542 nm.\n\nWestern blot analysis. Semiconfluent (75–80%) MLO-Y4 cells were incubated in medium without serum (in the absence or presence of 50 μM PD98059 or 1 μM UO126) for 25 minutes and treated with 10–7 M alendronate, IG9402, or etidronate for the last 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, or 15 minutes, or with 5 ng/mL sCT for the last 2, 5, 10, or 15 minutes. Monolayers were washed with cold 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and lysed in the lysis buffer already described here. Insoluble material was pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 16,000 g for 10 minutes. The phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 was analyzed by immunoblotting, as described previously (27). Proteins (10 μg) were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was performed using a mouse mAb recognizing tyrosine phosphorylated ERK1/2, or a rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing total ERK1/2, followed by incubation with either an anti-mouse or an anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Blots were developed using chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Quantitation of the intensity of the bands in the autoradiograms was performed using a scanner (Microtek Laboratory, Redondo Beach, California, USA).\n\nCalcitonin binding assay. sCT was labeled with 125I in the presence of chloramine T using a standard protocol. Binding of [125I]sCT to MLO-Y4 or UMR-106-06 cells was performed using a whole-cell assay. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with PBS, resuspended in culture medium without serum, and incubated in triplicates (1.25 × 105/tube) with 10–8 M [125I]sCT in the absence or presence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled sCT, for 1 hour at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were washed 3 times with iced PBS containing 0.2% BSA, and pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 minutes were counted using a γ-counter.\n\nCyclic AMP production. The concentration of cAMP in lysates of MLO-Y4 cells upon treatment with sCT was determined using a kit based on the competition for a fixed amount of anti-cAMP antibody between unlabeled cAMP present in the sample and peroxidase-labeled cAMP (Amersham Life Sciences Inc., Arlington Heights, Illinois, USA).\n\nGlucocorticoid administration to mice. Male Swiss Webster mice (Charles River Laboratories, Stone Ridge, New York, USA) were given daily subcutaneous injections of 0.75 mg/kg per day of alendronate dissolved in saline (4-amino-1-hydroxybutylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate; obtained from C.W.G.M. Löwik, University Hospital, Leiden, the Netherlands) beginning 3 days before subcutaneous implantation of 2.1 mg/kg per day pellets of slow-release prednisolone (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, Florida, USA). To adjust for the difference in the metabolic rate in mice compared with that in humans, the daily glucocorticoid dose was divided by the metabolic weight, i.e., the weight in kg to the 3/4 power (33, 34). Expressed in this manner, 2.1 mg/kg per day of prednisolone is 0.0735 mg/d given to a 0.035 kg mouse or 0.909 mg/kg3/4, a value quite similar to 0.926 mg/kg3/4, which results when a dose of 20 mg/d of prednisolone is given to a 60-kg human. One control group received saline injections with placebo pellet implantation, whereas another group received saline injections plus prednisolone pellets. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to determine spinal bone mineral density (spinal BMD) at the end of the 56-day experiment, as described previously (21).\n\nMeasurement of apoptosis in undecalcified bone sections. Sections of vertebral bone (L1–L5) were mounted on silane-coated glass slides (Scientific Device Laboratory, Inc., Des Plains, Illinois, USA), deplasticized, and incubated in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 7.6) in a microwave oven at 98°C for 5 minutes (31). Slides were then incubated with 0.5% pepsin for 30 minutes at 37°C. Apoptotic cells were detected by the TUNEL reaction in sections counterstained with 1% methyl green. Cells whose nuclei were clearly brown from the streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase conjugate instead of blue-green from the methyl green were interpreted as positive. Plastic-embedded sections of weaned rat mammary tissue were used as a positive control. Negative controls were made by omitting the transferase from the TUNEL reaction. Morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis were carefully examined to minimize ambiguity regarding the interpretation of results. With these precautions, TUNEL has been unequivocally associated with apoptosis and used with DNA fragmentation and immunohistochemical studies to demonstrate apoptosis of osteoblastic cells and osteoblasts both in vitro and in vivo (21, 31). Osteocytes were identified inside lacunae in mineralized bone. Osteoblasts were identified as cuboidal cells lining the osteoid-covered trabecular perimeter."
