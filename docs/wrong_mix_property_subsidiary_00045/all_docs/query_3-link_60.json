Metformin is not approved for prevention of cognitive decline.\n\nThis is an oral study drug. If selected, participants are randomly assigned to receive the investigational study drug or placebo (non-active agent used for comparison). Participants will undergo neuropsychological battery, clinical interviews, physical examinations and blood tests. The time commitment of this study is approximately 22 months with 4 study visits -Screening/Baseline and three visits every 6 months, and possibly 2 extra visits for brain MRI which is optional.\n\nWho can participate\n\nParticipants must have subjective memory concern reported by participant, study partner, or clinician.\n\nGeneral cognition and functional performance sufficiently preserved such that a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease cannot be made by the site physician at the time of the screening visit.\n\nAbnormal memory function\n\nMale or female participants aged 55 to 90 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form.\n\nParticipants without a known history of diabetes.

ALZ-NET will follow and record information about people’s health, safety, brain scans, and long-term health outcomes during their regular memory care. ALZ-NET aims to be a resource for evidence gathering, information sharing, and education across clinical and research communities to support and improve care of individuals living with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nPatients will be monitored if they are evaluated for treatment, throughout treatment duration, and following treatment completion for as long as they are willing. Patients may stop using any novel FDA-approved therapy for Alzheimer’s D[SS5] isease, or any other commercially available non-investigational Alzheimer’s D[SS6] isease therapy, during their ALZ-NET participation period. Patients who discontinue the FDA-approved therapy for Alzheimer’s Disease will continue to be followed for the duration of ALZ-NET with all clinical evaluations.\n\nWho can participate:\n\nPatient or patient’s legally authorized representative (LAR) or proxy (e.g., spouse or legal guardian) has the ability to understand the purpose and risks of ALZ-NET and provide signed and dated informed consent and authorization.\n\nPatient is at least 18 years of age at the time of informed consent.\n\nPatient has memory concerns and/or may have diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and has been identified by an approved site investigator (as defined by protocol) to be appropriate for treatment with novel FDA-approved AD therapies\n\nPatient’s treating clinician has made the decision to treat the patient with novel FDA-approved therapy for AD independent of the purpose of ALZ-NET and has already or will be initiating treatment.\n\nIf you are interested, please contact: Stephanie Tran; trans@stanford.edu; 650-521-7287[SS7]"
