        "text": "Paper presented at the conference Museums and Communities, held at the International Center of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., March 21-23, 1990, and sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Smithsonian.\n\nThe Chinatown History Museum has been developing the theory and practice for a new type of history museum. Originally founded in 1980 as the New York Chinatown History Project, the Chinatown History Museum has experimented with a wide range of community-based approaches to historical research and public programming in our effort to document, reconstruct, and reclaim the 160-year history of what is the oldest Chinese settlement in the . In 1990 we began the process of planning what we call a dialogue-driven museum, which will explore the previously unexamined roles of Chinese New Yorkers, non-Chinese New Yorkers, and tourists in the creation of New York's Chinatown. . . .\n\nThis essay is intended to help facilitate the discussion on how the museum community and cultural activists can re-envision museums and the communities they serve.
