By extending its corporate social responsibility program and practices, the Foundation helps in national development through its strategic and high-impact projects designed to specifically address the structural causes of poverty and underdevelopment. By focusing on the significant tasks of rural electrification, education, livelihood and health, the Foundation’s programs aim to infuse learning, ignite growth and inspire change in the lives of the people. Recognizing the need to balance economic growth and sustainable development, the Foundation advocates programs that give environmental stewardship equal importance. More than just responding to the needs of the community, the Foundation seeks to build the lives that essentially build the nation.\n\nVisit TeaM Energy Corporation’s website at www.teamenergy.ph."
