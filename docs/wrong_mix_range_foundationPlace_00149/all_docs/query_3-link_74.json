Using an open annotation tool, Hypothes.is, provided opportunities for literacy specialist candidates to share marginal notes and written dialogue asynchronously during the process of reading online professional articles. Asynchronous engagement in the digital margins of online texts added another layer of social interaction to the synchronous virtual study groups. Findings indicate that this process supported content-knowledge building and also sparked and supported inquiry-based learning. Successes and missteps are included as well as project improvements."
