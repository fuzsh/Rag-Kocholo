The author explores the possibility that ethical objections to embryo adoption are based on a flawed conflation of two problems: (1) the immorality, injustice, and harm of the procedure that supplants the marriage act; and (2) the rights of the child conceived outside the welcoming nature of the marriage act—the primary rights of every conceived person to completing, wholesome, and relational nurture. The author argues for the humanitarian right to embryo adoption, within marriage, from the point of view of the rights of the person conceived.\n\n...Etheredge, Francis ...

In this essay, the author holds that the full complexity of the human person implies such a profound unity-in-diversity of human being that we must, in the end, let the dialogue between reason and revelation lead us to conclude that the first instant of embryonic life is the first instant that the person comes to exist: that the first sign of embryonic life is a “natural sacrament” of the internal act of God which brings the person to exist, one in soul and body.

Original justice and original sin also can be examined through the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. By considering these concepts through the original moment of Mary’s conception, we gain a better understanding of the moment that each person is conceived. Thus a proper understanding of the Immaculate Conception will help us develop a better definition of human conception.\n\n...Etheredge, Francis ... Francis Etheredge Abstract.

Ethics & Medics: Volume > 41 > Issue: 7\n\nFrancis Etheredge On Regulating IVF\n\nabstract | view | rights & permissions\n\nThe in vitro fertilization industry is generally unregulated in the United States, although individual states have enacted laws trying to rein in some of the more flagrant abuses of the practice. The weakness in the American system is the failure to protect the rights of experimental subjects, first expressed in the 1949 Nuremberg Code and again in the 1979 Belmont Report, which emphasized the need to protect those with diminished responsibility. Who is more vulnerable to mistreatment than the unborn? A different approach exists in Great Britain, where the national government regulates the production and use of human embryos. There are advantages to the British practice: it encourages scientists to publicize what they propose to do; it can focus the public on the objective good or harm of a particular proposal; and it makes it easier to identify the currents of thought which contribute to the political advocacy of IVF.\n\n...Etheredge, Francis ...

Reilly Rescuing the Good Samaritan in Embryo Adoption and Beyond\n\nabstract | view | rights & permissions\n\nEmbryo adoption, when oriented to the rescue of a dignified human person, is a merciful and morally licit response to an evil consequence of in vitro fertilization and the freezing of embryos. Those who object to embryo adoption not only misconstrue the relevant moral reasoning but exhibit confusion among the object, intention, and circumstances and between two very different potential objects. Because the mercy and charity effected through embryo adoption are at the very heart of moral action, juridical arguments that undermine people’s confidence in these priorities have far-reaching, harmful implications.\n\n..., n. 26. 25.

He then draws out the implications of the differences between his view and Rex’s on the relation between maternity and pregnancy. The essay concludes by pointing out that, if they are to change their minds, opponents of embryo adoption need to be convinced that it is morally licit to impregnate, or “introduce an order to birth,” in a woman by means other than the marriage act.\n\n... same general approach are Francis Etheredge, “Frozen and ...\n\n9.

Many scholars who support embryo transfer and adoption limit their discussion to heterologous embryo transfer, the transfer of a genetically unrelated embryo into the uterus of a married woman. In this paper, the author focuses on homologous embryo transfer, the transfer of a genetically related embryo, as a viable option for married couples. It is the responsibility of the genetic mother to implant her embryos regardless of how they were created. When this option is not feasible, heterologous embryo transfer is possible in limited circumstances.\n\n.... Francis Etheredge, “Frozen and Untouchable: A Double Injustice to the Embryo ...\n\n11.
