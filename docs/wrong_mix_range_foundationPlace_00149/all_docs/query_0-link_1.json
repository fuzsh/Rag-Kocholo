        "text": "Research Interests\n\nMy research is about the role of heritage and memory institutions, practices, and discourses in mediating public representations of people’s histories, cultures and identities.\n\nI am interested in how institutions of public culture work, what drives their behaviours, and how can we understand this in terms of questions of power, agency and control.\n\nMy work is primarily about publicly-funded museums, art galleries, and heritage organisations but I am also interested in how these are part of what I call a public ecology of remembering which could also include memorials, archives, rituals, commemorations, and public spaces such as parks.\n\nI am particularly interested in dimensions of public culture and heritage which deal with national identity and diversity.\n\nAlthough my work is rooted in ideas of cultural theory, I aim to draw out the implications for curatorship and wider museum practice. My work seeks to connect theoretical debates with practical concerns; my teaching and research projects frequently involve collaborating with heritage sector professionals.\n\nResearch projects:\n\n2016-2019: European Union.
