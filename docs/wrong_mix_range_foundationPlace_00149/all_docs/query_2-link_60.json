        "text": "To build a strong foundation in Language Arts, students participate in daily phonemic awareness, dialogic reading, and handwriting activities. As they learn to identify the subtle differences between each letter sound, they are also challenged to develop an appreciation for literature and “big ideas” through our Happily Ever After reading readiness program.\n\nTeacher-led small and large group discussions and activities develop language, vocabulary, and analytical skills like making predictions and inferences. In addition to poetry and bible verse recitations, which strengthen the core mental skill of working memory, students develop important writing skills.\n\nIn addition to daily indoor and outdoor play, students meet once per week for 30 minutes for physical education. In Pre-K, students learn simple games designed to develop their gross motor skills, coachability, and sportsmanship. Our Pre-Kindergarten Center also includes a new outdoor play set designed with spinners to support the development of balance, both large and small slides as well as climbing areas to encourage an age-appropriate amount of challenge throughout the school year, and an abundance of green space for outdoor learning and exploration.\n\nNature Study involves the careful observation of found and noticed objects, which is a foundational skill of scientific inquiry. The encouragement of nature study is supported with curriculum-rooted field trips and through the exploration of our outdoor classroom which includes a pollinator garden, rock formations, and flowering trees and bushes which attract butterflies and native insects!"
