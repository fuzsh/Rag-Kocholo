        "text": "An Airman from the 741st Missile Security Forces Squadron received a Purple Heart and Air Force Combat Action Medal Dec. 10 for his efforts in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom November 2006 to November 2007.\n\nSenior Airman John Soules volunteered for a 365-day deployment to Iraq and was assigned to the 732nd Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron, Detachment 3, as a member of the security forces team in downtown Baghdad.\n\n\"Our mission was to train the Iraqi police and make sure they were doing their job to the fullest extent of their abilities,\" Airman Soules said. \"Our daily mission was to get our armor up, roll outside the wire and go to the Iraqi police stations.\"\n\nOnce at the police station, Airman Soules was responsible for the armory and his job was to make sure all the weapons and ammunition were accounted for at the station. However on June 28, while performing duty as a turret gunner on his convoy, his vehicle was struck by a roadside improvised explosive device where he suffered multiple shrapnel lacerations to his forehead and received a concussion.\n\n\"The day the IED went off started off weird,\" the Purple Heart recipient said. \"We were supposed to have the day off actually, but we were told the night before that we had to get station numbers and haul the captain to the [forward operating base].\"\n\nThe convoy was headed toward an off ramp and Airman Soules said he saw a vehicle \"creeping\" toward their convoy.\n\n\"My attention was on that car because it was now a viable threat because it was still rolling,\" he said. \"I don't remember the blast and the next thing I remember is sitting down.\"\n\nHe said he noticed the interpreter was unconscious and began rendering self-aid buddy care to her, but soon realized that things weren't alright with him as he first thought.\n\n\"I felt something run down my face,\" he said. \"I had initially called in that my status was good, so I touched my head and my glove was red and I realized I was hit. Then I went back to the interpreter.\"\n\nHis actions on this day earned him the Purple Heart and Air Force Combat Action Medal. Maj. Gen. Roger Burg, 20th Air Force commander, was on-hand to present the medals to Airman Soules in front of his family and friends.\n\n\"I want to make sure you understand the significance that the Purple Heart was the only award during the Revolutionary War under General Washington's hand,\" General Burg said. \"It was Washington's way of praising bravery. Today you have to stand in the line of fire and nowadays, you don't know when or where that is going to happen. Airman Soules showed a willingness to accept sacrifice and he played a significant role.\"\n\nService before self and to country has a long lineage within the Soule family. Born on Veterans Day and the youngest of three in his family, Airman Soules said he volunteered for duty in Iraq because his father was a Vietnam veteran, his two grandfathers were World War II veterans, and his great-grandfather received the Army's Distinguished Service Cross for his actions in France during World War I.\n\nThe Purple Heart is awarded for wounds or death as result of an act of any opposing Armed Force, as a result of an international terrorist attack or as a result of military operations while serving as part of a peacekeeping force."
