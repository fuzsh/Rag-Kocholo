        "text": "John Napier Turner (born June 7, 1929, Richmond, Surrey, England—died September 18, 2020, Toronto, Canada) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who in June 1984 succeeded Pierre Elliott Trudeau as head of the Liberal Party and prime minister of Canada. In general elections of September of the same year, his party was routed by the Progressive Conservatives under Brian Mulroney.\n\nTurner’s family immigrated to Canada in 1932, and Turner gained his early education in Ottawa. After graduating in political science from the University of British Columbia (A.B., 1949), he studied for a year in Paris and attended the University of Oxford as a Rhodes scholar, receiving a degree in law in 1952 and a master’s degree in 1957.\n\nTurner returned to Canada and worked for various corporations, winning his first election to the House of Commons as a Liberal Party member in June 1962. In 1965 he was appointed to his first cabinet post but lost a bid for leadership of the Liberals in 1968 to Trudeau. Under Trudeau, Turner first served as justice minister and in 1972 was appointed minister of finance, a post he abruptly resigned in September 1975, followed by his resignation from Parliament in February 1976. He returned to corporate law and for the next eight years also served as director of several companies while retaining close connections with political associates."
