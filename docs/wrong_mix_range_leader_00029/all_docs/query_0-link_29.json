Chairman Waxman. The committee and subcommittee will please come to order. Today, the committee is holding a hearing on the State Department's single largest construction project in the world, the $600 million U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. This is the first oversight hearing Congress has held on this immense project. We will hear today from the State Department witnesses that the Embassy will be built on time and under budget. I hope they are right. Billions of taxpayer dollars have been squandered on contracts in Iraq. There should be at least one major project that is done right. But there are red flags involving the Embassy complex that should not be ignored. On July 5, the Washington Post ran a front page article that described ``a cascade of building and safety blunders'' in the facility being built to house the Embassy security guards. This facility was built by the same company, First Kuwaiti, that is building the main Embassy. It was delivered to the Embassy with the assurance that it ``meets and exceeds'' contract requirements. It passed the inspections required by the State Department and it seemed like a success. But when the kitchen equipment was turned on for the first time in May, the appliances didn't work. The electrical wiring melted, creating a serious fire hazard. Embassy officials cabled Washington: ``Poor quality construction . . . [l]ife safety issues . . . inherent construction deficiencies . . . left the post with no recourse but to shut the camp down in spite of the blistering heat in Baghdad.'' Over 2 months later, the base for the guards remains shuttered. As we will learn today, there are other red flags. The oversight and management of the Embassy project appears to be in disarray. The State Department agency responsible for the day to day oversight of the project is the Office of Overseas Buildings Operations [OBO], but the OBO appears to be in a raging battle with the State Department officials in Baghdad who will ultimately live and work in the new Embassy. The conflicts are so severe that the senior OBO official who is supposed to be on the ground in Iraq, monitoring the construction of the new Embassy has been banished from the country. It does not help matters that there are only three career State Department officials onsite to oversee this massive project. Everyone else is a private contractor. The project has also been beset by allegations that the prime contractor, First Kuwaiti, has used forced labor to build the Embassy, violating the laws against human trafficking and sending exactly the wrong message to Iraqis and the rest of the world about U.S. respect for human rights. This committee called this hearing to investigate these allegations. As the principal oversight committee in the House, that is our job. Unfortunately, the State Department has taken exactly the wrong approach to our inquiry. The Department has gone into full bunker mentality, stonewalling the committee's document requests and obstructing our efforts to conduct legitimate oversight of the Embassy project. The committee sent a letter on July 10th requesting documents in preparation for today's hearing. We asked for a list of eight discrete, clearly identified memos, reports and cables. We also asked for a set of broader documents including communications, briefings and meeting minutes. We informed the Department that we wanted the eight documents we specifically identified before today's hearing. The rest could be produced afterwards. In response, the committee was told almost daily that these documents were on the way. We were told: They are being gathered. They are being reviewed. They are in the approval process. They will be there tomorrow. But aside from two incomplete cables, none of the documents were provided. Finally, 2 weeks after we requested these eight documents, we issued a subpoena for the documents. The due date was yesterday at 4 p.m. The Department produced none of the documents by the deadline. Just this morning, the State Department faxed over a handful of documents that were required under the subpoena. Some of these documents raise even new questions. In one e-mail exchange, the Senior Coordinator of the State Department Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons writes that he has ``strong concerns about allegations of human trafficking among state contractors in Iraq.'' The State Department official in charge of overseeing the Embassy project instructs his staff, ``Do not respond to these folks as you can see no matter what you say you cannot win.'' The fact that the Department is resisting congressional oversight doesn't mean that the project is failing, but it inspires no confidence in the Department's assertions that everything is on track. We have also received limited cooperation from the State Department's prime contractor on this project, First Kuwaiti. We sent an invitation to company officials to testify here today, but they refused. We asked to interview knowledgeable First Kuwaiti officials, but they refused. We asked for a telephone call to ask questions, but again they refused. First Kuwaiti did make a substantial document production to the committee and did provide a written statement, but from the standpoint of the U.S. taxpayer, its refusal to testify is, to me, another red flag. The State Department awarded First Kuwaiti a contract to build the largest U.S. Embassy in the world. The company is being paid a half a billion dollars in taxpayer funds, yet it is acting as if it is unaccountable to Congress and the taxpayer. There is one party in this process that did cooperate with the committee, and that is KBR. KBR has provided the documents we asked for, gave a briefing to committee staff and agreed to testify here today, and they took these steps even though they knew that I have been outspoken about my concerns about other KBR projects in Iraq. Despite the obstacles we faced, today's hearing will raise important questions about the Embassy project. Witnesses will describe evidence of substandard labor conditions and shoddy construction work. Internal cables will reveal a Department at war with itself. My goal is to use this hearing to begin to sort through the claims and counterclaims that envelope the Embassy project. We won't answer every question that has emerged about this secretive project, but if we can shed more light on some, we will be doing our job. I hope the Embassy project opens on time and under budget, but real questions about the project are being asked and these need to be addressed. This is an unusual hearing in that it is being held as a joint hearing of the full committee and its National Security Subcommittee. The hearing is being held jointly in recognition of the extensive work that the subcommittee has been doing for the past several months to examine the allegations of human trafficking by First Kuwaiti. For this reason, after Ranking Member Davis is recognized for his statement, Subcommittee Chairman Tierney and Subcommittee Ranking Member Shays will be recognized for their opening statements, and then we will go directly to the witnesses. [The prepared statement of Chairman Henry A. Waxman follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.001 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.002 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.003 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.004 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.005 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.006 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.007 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.008 Chairman Waxman. Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In my opinion, this could have been a good hearing. It could have been a thoughtful examination of how the State Department's Overseas Building Operations Office constructs diplomatic facilities under difficult conditions in some of the most inhospitable parts of the world. It could be a responsible assessment of incidental and systematic problems encountered by an ambitious program to build more secure embassies, particularly the effort to complete the State's largest single project ever in Baghdad, Iraq, in the middle of a war zone. It could, but I am afraid it won't. Why? Because, as I think the chairman would acknowledge, this hearing is a little bit premature. Based on media reports alone, the committee scheduled today's testimony before completing a thorough investigation of thinly sourced, sensationalized charges of shoddy construction and labor abuses. In what has become an unfortunate modus operandi, politically charged allegations are marching miles ahead of the proven facts. Whenever a news story jumps to a convenient conclusion to back suspected administration malfeasance or misconduct, the committee rushes to see how they can elevate mere questions, concerns and speculation before the real fact- finding. As I have said before, it is oversight by firing squad. Ready. Fire. Aim. The most significant waste, fraud and abuses we are likely to uncover today may be our own. So what are we really aiming at today? The allegations of waste, fraud and abuse at the new U.S. Embassy in Iraq cited in today's hearing title are based primarily on an exchange of State Department cables detailing a dispute over an entirely separate construction project, the security camp adjacent to the Embassy, a completely separate contract. Both projects were built by the same contractor, First Kuwaiti General Trading and Contracting, but the camp was designed as a temporary collection of prefabricated trailers and support structures while the 592 million Embassy compound involved full-scale construction of permanent buildings. In the short time we have had to pursue claims of substandard materials and practices, we found nothing to suggest the intramural spat over who is responsible for expanding and changing design elements at the temporary camp has any implications whatsoever on the quality of work at the permanent Embassy. But here is a fact that does have an impact on the risk of waste, fraud and abuse. Both projects were built under firm fixed-price contracts, the kind the majority generally prefers. First Kuwaiti got the work only after no U.S. contractor offered to meet the ambitious 24 month schedule while facing substantial financial and logistical risks, building in a war zone on those terms. They wanted a cost reimbursement arrangement. Under the fixed price vehicle, disputes over electrical wiring loads and dripping pipes can have little impact on ultimate costs. In effect, we are here litigating a punch list, the usual inventory of fixes and finishing touches generated by any project this size. Allegations about labor abuses and human trafficking violations are far more serious, and it appears the State Department took them seriously. We can be proud of U.S. labor protection but shouldn't be naive about the applications elsewhere in the world. Nevertheless, complaints about working and living conditions were referred to the State Department Inspector General who, in conjunction with the IG for the Multi-National Forces in Iraq, conducted onsite inspection and interviews with foreign workers and U.S. personnel. The State IG team found ``nothing that caused us to believe that trafficking in persons violations had occurred at the site.'' The military IG did find illegal and deceptive hiring practices by recruiting agencies, but it found no evidence of the alleged abduction, abuse, overcrowding or unsanitary facilities. In fact, the MNF-I IG concluded of the 58 living areas inspected, the State Department facility ``rated in the top third with above average quality of life conditions.'' Against those findings, we have claims by disgruntled ex- employees who may have pending or potential financial interests against the Government. Their accusations should be evaluated very carefully, something we have not had the opportunity to do. They may sound atrocious. Someone saw passports in a safe or boarding passes marked Dubai on a flight to Iraq. But today we will get one side of the story. Only further inquiry will tell us if the passports were stored voluntarily or whether anyone boarding a charter flight in Kuwait was confused about its destination. Another reason not to take these allegations at face value is that they have been thrown at an extraordinarily effective Federal agency. Under the leadership of General Charles Williams, the State's Bureau of Overseas Building Operations has completed 47--47--new, secured diplomatic facilities in 6 years on schedule and all within budget. He brings unimpeachable credentials to a difficult job, coming out of retirement at the request of his friend, Colin Powell. After logging 2,000 flight hours in helicopters in Vietnam, General Williams finished a 29 year Army military career successfully, completing major construction projects with the Corps of Engineers. He knows how to build. He has proven his dedication, his skill and his integrity. I question whether we will prove anything else here today. Nevertheless, I thank the witnesses for their time and perspectives. [The prepared statement of Hon. Tom Davis follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.009 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.010 Chairman Waxman. Thank you, Mr. Davis. Mr. Tierney, the chairman of the subcommittee. Mr. Tierney. Good morning and thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you and Ranking Member Davis for allowing the National Security and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee to jointly hold this hearing. There are many questions raised by the construction of this enormous 65 acre, 24 building walled fortress of an Embassy in Iraq. What will it mean to Iraqis? Will most Iraqis react like one quoted recently in the Los Angeles Times article, who said they are not leaving Iraq for a long time, and he called the Embassy a symbol of oppression and injustice? What purpose does an Embassy serve if nearly 1,000 of the State Department officials are only rarely permitted to interact with Iraqis outside the Green Zone, an essential part of their job, as questioned by the American Foreign Service Association, the professional body representing State Department employees? What does it mean that our military is planning on co- locating at the Embassy site and how will this be interpreted? Is this reminiscent of the even larger Somalia compound that was dismantled by looters after the overthrow of the dictator, Mohamed Siad Barre, and does it foretell the planned Lebanon Embassy now said to be located in the heart of Hezbollah-controlled territory? Is it bigger than it should be if you really expect Iraq to stabilize and not as big as it needs to be for the nerve center of an ongoing war effort, as the L.A. Times quotes a State Department advisor and Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow as saying? But the purpose of our hearing today is to look at the construction of the Embassy itself. Our new Iraq Embassy is not only our most expensive Embassy to date. It is also supposed to become a beacon of freedom and democracy in Iraq and throughout the Middle East. Still, as Chairman Waxman has noted, very troubling allegations have come to the subcommittee's attention that this proposed beacon of freedom was built quite literally on the backs of workers from Nepal, the Philippines, Pakistan, India and Ghana, just to name a few nations. We have heard allegations that some third country nationals working for the prime contractor, First Kuwaiti, had to pay recruitment fees amounting to more than a full year of salary, fees as high as $3,000 with salaries as low as $7 a day. We have heard of workers, essentially waylaid to Iraq, being told they were going to work in Dubai and given boarding passes to Dubai but being transported instead to Iraq. We have heard of verbal abuse, physical assaults and physical intimidation, the First Kuwaiti managers brandishing weapons. We have heard of workers living a dozen or two dozen or even more in a single trailer measuring 40 feet by 10 feet. That would essentially be the breadth of this two rows of seats and about the width as well. We have heard of inadequate medical care, of a lack of safety training and equipment and about deaths not adequately explained. We have heard of workers unable to return home whether because their passports were withheld or because of threats or because they faced a year's salary penalty if they resigned. I might note that the withholding of passports by employers is an act forbidden by the U.S. Government. Our first panel today consists of former workers from the Embassy site who will tell us what they themselves have heard and seen. We take these allegations very seriously. Unfortunately, however, it appears that not everyone may have done so. We have learned during the course of our investigation that a number of officials in our own State Department may have looked the other way when confronted with these disturbing or inconvenient allegations. Our State Department is supposed to be the face of U.S. diplomacy to the world. Unfortunately, when it appears that when it came to the workers used to construct our flagship Embassy in Iraq, some State Department officials may not have kept their eyes wide open. For example, it has become clearer and clearer that little to no forethought on labor issues had been done during the contract award and in the vetting of First Kuwaiti. It appears that State Department officials have largely taken a hands-off approach with respect to First Kuwaiti's relations with its third country workers, and we have heard about the State Department's own Office to Combat Human Trafficking pressing for action from General Williams and from other top officials in the Bureau of Overseas Building Operations and from the State Department Inspector General and receiving what can only be described as the cold shoulder. We have a State Department Inspector General who reportedly allowed First Kuwaiti itself to select the workers to be interviewed, an Inspector General who apparently didn't even interview those alleging abuses and an Inspector General who didn't use interpreters despite the fact that only 10 percent of the worker population was fluent in English. I sincerely hope that what we hear today from our State Department witnesses dispels and explains those troubling stories our investigation has uncovered. I hope we hear that a strict adherence to on time and on budget does not mean the trampling of workers' rights and dignity. It is important that all of us in the U.S. Government recognize that our words and our actions matter. Our words and our actions matter both because others in the world are watching us and listening to us but even more importantly because they reflect on who we are and who we should constantly be striving to become. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Hon. John F. Tierney follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.011 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.012 Chairman Waxman. Thank you, Mr. Tierney. Mr. Shays. Mr. Shays. Mr. Chairman, when it comes to U.S. citizens and foreign nationals working in our embassies abroad, there is absolutely no question that their safety and security must be our top priority, and we also have the significant responsibility to examine alleged waste, abuse and fraud in Government. We need to look at the State Department and its contractors in the construction of the new $600 million U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. I support today's oversight efforts. Unfortunately, what we have today is potentially a one-sided discussion about allegations found in some recent articles and Internet blog entries. In terms of preparation and research, the minority staff have been rushed through more than a half dozen interviews this week, many of which were given with just 5 minutes notice of, and just last night the committee still had not received key documents from the Department of State. So although the facts are still muddled, this is what we do know. A recent construction guard camp near to but separate from the Baghdad Embassy is running on schedule. It appears there were some electrical problems, but it is still not clear whether it was these problems that resulted in a temporary delay in the occupation of the camp or other construction and installation deficiencies. On the one hand, we hear from the Department of State the project is currently on schedule and within budget. On the other hand, we hear from contractors and whistleblowers that the construction is suffering massive problems with the fuel tank, sprinklers, air conditioning, heating and electrical system among other things. In reality, this is a complex, high-risk project in a war zone, so certainly there will be some issues with the building system. But we are still lacking hard evidence to make any assessments. The other side of today's hearing is allegations of potential human trafficking and labor abuses. We cannot take lightly these allegations of human trafficking and labor abuses. Human trafficking is modern day slavery and something that affects every nation on every continent around the globe, including the United States, and we must put an end to it wherever we find it. In 2000, my fellow members and I drew a line when we passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act making human trafficking a Federal crime. Between 2001 and 2006, the Department of Justice has prosecuted over 360 defendants, secured 238 convictions and guilty pleas, and had opened 639 new human trafficking investigations. That is how seriously the United States takes this issue. So it makes sense when individuals, some of whom are here today with us, raise concerns about possible labor abuses or inhumane conditions, the Trafficking in Persons Office in the Department of State and the Inspector Generals from the Multi- National Force-Iraq quickly took action, observing the employees, interviewing workers and inspecting facilities on the site in Baghdad. In fact, the State and MNF-Iraq Inspector Generals in their three reviews did not find anything to indicate human trafficking violations had occurred. However, serious questions about possible illegal and deceptive hiring practices by recruiting agencies are still being pursued, and it is reported the Department of Justice has recently opened their own human trafficking investigation to pursue these allegations. I commend each of these agencies for taking this matter seriously and continuing with their investigation. I look forward to today's hearing but wish we had more information and had spent more time preparing this investigation before commencing this hearing. Nevertheless, I do appreciate the opportunity to participate in today's hearing and thank each of the witnesses for providing their testimony for the record. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Hon. Christopher Shays follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.013 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.014 Chairman Waxman. Thank you very much, Mr. Shays. I want to now call forward our first witnesses, Mr. Karl Demming. He is the engineering and construction manager of KBR. Mr. Demming, we are pleased to have you with us today to testify and to give us your analysis of what has been happening. It is the policy of this committee that all witnesses that testify take an oath, so I would like to ask you, if you would, to please stand and raise your right hand. [Witness sworn.] Chairman Waxman. The record will indicate that you did answer in the affirmative. Mr. Demming, your prepared statement is going to be in the record in its entirety. What I would like to ask you to do is to give your testimony. We do try to keep the oral testimony to around 5 minutes. I am going to have a clock. It will be green, but then it will turn orange when it indicates you have 1 minute left and then red when the time is up. If you feel you need to go over to summarize it, fine, but we do want all witnesses to try to keep within the timeframe, so we can hear from everybody. We are happy to have you here. There is a button on the base of the mic. Be sure it is pushed in, so it is activated. When you have done that, I want to recognize you to proceed. STATEMENT OF KARL DEMMING, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION MANAGER, KBR Mr. Demming. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Karl Demming. I am currently employed as a technical professional leader, Specialties for KBR in Baghdad in support of USMI, the U.S. Mission in Iraq. Under the LOGCAP contract, I oversee KBR's engineering and construction work in Iraq. I arrived in-country soon after the invasion in 2003. I have been on the ground there ever since. I am a participating electrician, practicing, and have been a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers for more than 30 years. You asked KBR to assist the committee in its inquiry regarding the Baghdad Embassy security force guard camp, and I am here to do so. The guard camp and the new Embassy are being constructed by another contractor. KBR did not design or construct either one. Once the guard camp is complete, KBR will provide support services to the personnel who will be housed there. I am a native Californian. I grew up in Burbank, went to Burbank High and later the Los Angeles Trade Technical School. I joined the U.S. Army in 1971 and returned to Burbank after my tour of duty. I began work in the electrical field in 1975 and in the course of my career have had the opportunity to work in many aspects of this field, for example, power generation for the Federal Aviation Administration and the Marine Corps and electrical systems and construction positions for International Controls, Carnation, Lockheed, and Anheuser Busch. I have held State of California electrical and HVAC, heating-ventilation-air conditioning, contractors licenses and an L.A. city supervisor's license. I also owned and operated my own electrical firm. I worked on a wide variety of projects where the IBEW supplied the work teams. I was a member of the National Guard from 1975 through 1997, and I volunteered for the Gulf war and served in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait as a staff sergeant with the Guard. I moved to Denver soon after leaving active duty and worked on multiple construction projects at Denver International Airport. At night, I also taught the IBEW's electrical apprenticeship program. I began working for KBR in May 2003. After an initial assignment in Basra, I began working in Baghdad on several power generation projects related to the U.S. Embassy Annex. In November 2006, I was promoted to my current position. Under the LOGCAP contract, KBR provides a variety of support functions to the United States and Coalition personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. As part of that work, every day KBR provides meals, laundry and other support services throughout theater. Specific to today's discussion, KBR was asked to prepare to provide similar services at the Baghdad Embassy security force camp. As I mentioned before, KBR did not design or construct either the guard camp or the new Embassy compound, but as the company prepared to support personnel at the guard camp, KBR participated in several site visits and was asked to conduct a technical inspection of the facilities. This is not unlike having an inspection done before buying a house. My team and I carried out these inspections, and earlier this week, at the committee's request, I briefed the committee's bipartisan staff on our findings. I am here today to answer any questions you may have. [The prepared statement of Mr. Demming follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.015 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.016 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.017 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.018 Chairman Waxman. Thank you very much for your testimony. I have questions, and I know other Members will as well. We are going to proceed recognize Members 5 minutes at a time. The Iraq Embassy is the largest construction project at the State Department. It has a price tag of $600 million, and its successful completion is an essential part of the administration's strategy for Iraq. The first part of this mammoth project to be completed was a base for the security guards. It was delivered to the Embassy this spring by the prime contractor, First Kuwaiti, with the assurance that it meets and exceeds contract requirements. My understanding is that KBR was hired by the State Department to run the guard base and prepare meals for the guards. As a result, KBR entered the facility after it was turned over to the Embassy to see how the equipment was operating. Mr. Demming, I want to ask you about the problems KBR found in the construction of the guard base when you tested the facility. I understand you were part of a KBR team that was involved with the process of starting up the dining facility in the guard camp after First Kuwaiti finished assembling it, is that right? Mr. Demming. That is correct, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Waxman. On May 25th, the Embassy sent a cable back to Washington to the Overseas Business Operations Office or OBO that described some of the problems you encountered with the process. I would like to make this cable part of the record today and without objection that will be the order. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.019 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.020 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.021 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.022 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.023 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.024 Chairman Waxman. Paragraph three of the Embassy cable says that on May 14th, KBR was in the process of initiating the dining facility when the wires began to melt, is that right? Mr. Demming. That is correct, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Waxman. Paragraph four of the cable states that some of the appliances were not working properly and there was a burning smell. It also says that the staff received electrical shocks. In your opinion, was this a serious safety issue and why? Mr. Demming. Yes, Mr. Chairman, it was a serious safety issue. I will explain why as layman as I possibly can. The grounding issues and the personnel injury as far as coming in contact with any of the metal equipment such as commercial type cooking equipment and such in the facility as well as the type of facility it is. They are trailers or modular units, and they are steel or metal of construction. Chairman Waxman. At that point, the cable says you had shut off all the equipment and could not serve any meals. Paragraph seven of the Embassy cable states the initial assessment by the KBR electricians was that the gauge of the electrical wiring is too small for the electrical load required and that most if not all of the wiring will need to be replaced. It then says a followup inspection by KBR identified additional electrical issues that required corrective action. Can you tell us more about the problems you found? Mr. Demming. Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman. In regards to the electrical cable, the equipment that this cable was feeding, we call them circuits and they are protected by over-current devices. The system does not work properly if it is not designed properly. We did not have the design drawings or plans at that time. So we were merely there to assist in starting this facility up, so we can serve the first meal on May 15th. During that time, these issues arose and we did have personnel that were getting shocked or electrocuted mildly at the facility. We did shut the power off to investigate and assist the contractor, Overseas Building Office, to find these issues and try to remedy them. Chairman Waxman. Well, the cable mentions problems with the grounding, electrical feeds, split wiring, wiring not contained in junction boxes. Paragraph 11 of the Embassy cable states that on May 24th, 10 days after the meltdown, OBO said the wiring had been corrected. You came back on May 25th, the next day, but you still found continuing concerns with the wiring, according to the cable. How can it be that OBO thought it had fixed the problems when it really hadn't? Mr. Demming. Mr. Chairman, we don't monitor what those, that entity does out there on that camp. We are directed by our client--at that time it would be the U.S. Army--to perform these tasks and only upon direction do we actually act. Chairman Waxman. Well, the wiring failed once. First Kuwaiti fixed it, and OBO checked it, but there were still problems if what you are telling us is right, something appears to be seriously wrong with the management and oversight of this project. This doesn't mean that the rest of the Embassy project will be plagued by similar problems, but it obviously raises a major red flag. The State Department said the guard base was fine, that it met and exceeded requirements. It turned out to be a fiasco. The $600 million question is whether we are going to discover the same kinds of problems when the Embassy is turned over to the State Department this fall. I want to recognize Mr. Shays for 5 minutes as well. Mr. Shays. Mr. Demming, first, you deserve a tremendous thanks for serving your country by serving overseas in Iraq for so long in your capacity with KBR, and I thank you for that. Mr. Demming. Thank you, Congressman. Mr. Shays. What I want to do is just be clear. We are not talking about the $600 million Embassy. We are talking about a temporary camp designed to house workers who would work on the $600 million Embassy, is that correct? Mr. Demming. To my understanding, Mr. Congressman, that BESF was the Baghdad security force camp. Mr. Shays. Is the answer yes? Mr. Demming. This would be for the security force. Mr. Shays. What you are talking about now is a facility that is temporary, designed to hold the security forces or the workers or whatever, correct? Mr. Demming. Correct. Mr. Shays. OK. We are not talking about a permanent Embassy problem, correct? Mr. Demming. This does attach to the big Embassy campus itself. Mr. Shays. I am not trying to suggest that we should have problems in a temporary facility, but I want us to make sure we are not mixing the two right yet. Now it is my understanding that the OBO, the Overseas Building Operations, is a State Department agency that had basically written out the specs for this temporary facility and that when KBR got there, they felt that the facility was not adequate, is that not true? Mr. Demming. That would take some explanation, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Shays. Well, first off, isn't it true that this was a facility that was built according to the specs of the State Department and when KBR got there, they said this isn't going to be able to handle all that we need? Isn't that true? Mr. Demming. Can I explain to that? Mr. Shays. Well, first off, tell me if it is true or not and then explain. Mr. Demming. That is true. Mr. Shays. OK, now explain. Mr. Demming. OK. What the issues were when KBR was asked to perform operation and maintenance logistic services at the guard camp itself, we have certain equipment and support mechanics that require trucks, fire trucks, fuel trucks and etc. At that time, we did not have a lot of information. Mr. Shays. I need a shorter version. The bottom line is are you trying to say they should have known that it was not going to be adequate? Mr. Demming. No, sir. We could not get our equipment in there to perform that O&M. That was our pushback. Mr. Shays. Are you a witness today to have evidence about the Embassy itself and that the Embassy itself has major construction problems? Mr. Demming. No, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Shays. Your thrust today is just to say there may be indication of some problems with the full Embassy because there are problems with this temporary site or are you just here because you were requested to be? What is your motivation for being here? Mr. Demming. I was requested to be here or asked to be here, Mr. Congressman, to explain the difficulties and issues at the security force camp. Mr. Shays. Temporary site, OK. In your work in the United States, is this sometimes what is built sometimes doesn't meet the need of the person, of the client? Is this unusual? Is this event unusual, what you are encountering, what you encountered in Iraq? Mr. Demming. Comparing to Iraq, it is a very volatile environment. Unusual, I would say no, sir. Mr. Shays. Thank you very much, sir. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Do you have a second? Mr. Shays. Yes, I would be happy to yield to my colleague. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Is the problem here with the specs or is the problem with the construction? Mr. Demming. Mr. Congressman, KBR was never privy to the specifications that this entity was built by. We were going by the Unites States national electrical codes and some of the national building codes, the UBC and the UMC. Mr. Davis of Virginia. So you don't have any information that the construction didn't meet the specs and there might have been a problem with the specs. Mr. Demming. That is correct. Mr. Davis of Virginia. You don't have any information that there is anything wrong in the construction at the Embassy at all, do you? Mr. Demming. That is correct. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Thank you. Chairman Waxman. Mr. Cummings. Mr. Cummings. Thank you very much. I want to thank you, Mr. Demming, for being with us today. Did I understand you correctly when you said that you are an electrician? Mr. Demming. That is correct, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Cummings. How long have you been that? Mr. Demming. Over 30 years, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Cummings. Now, Mr. Demming, I understand that after the wires melted at the guard camp, is that true? They melted? Mr. Demming. Yes, sir, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Cummings. Let me see if we can connect some dots here. After they melted, the Embassy asked KBR to conduct a technical inspection of the entire guard camp electrical system, is that correct? Mr. Demming. Yes, sir. Mr. Cummings. Were you a part of that in any way? Mr. Demming. Yes, I was, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Cummings. Mr. Chairman, I have a copy of KBR's report dated May 25, 2007, which I ask to be made a part of the hearing record. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.025 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.026 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.027 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.028 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.029 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.030 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.031 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.032 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.033 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.034 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.035 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.036 Mr. Cummings. Mr. Demming, this report says that it is from Paul Chretien. Do you know him? Mr. Demming. Say that again. Mr. Cummings. I probably pronounced his name wrong. Paul C- H-R-E-T-I-E-N. Mr. Demming. Chretien. Mr. Cummings. Yes. Who is he? Mr. Demming. He is my electrical engineer. He works on my staff. Mr. Cummings. All right, so he works, he is under you? Mr. Demming. That is correct, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Cummings. All right. On page 1 of this report, it lists ``areas of concern'' and it says this: ``One of the greatest areas of concern is the use of counterfeit wire,'' which refers to a wire found which has a particular wire size printed on the insulation but actually has smaller, lower capacity conductors, is that right? Mr. Demming. That is correct, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Cummings. Did you actually obtain samples of the counterfeit wire? Mr. Demming. Yes, that is correct, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Cummings. Now that word, counterfeit, that is a pretty strong word, isn't it? Mr. Demming. Yes, it is. Mr. Cummings. In other words, it implies that somebody did something wrong, is that right? In other words, that is not proper, is that right? Mr. Demming. That is correct. Mr. Cummings. How did you determine what the size of the wire in the insulation was? Mr. Demming. When the team was inspecting on that technical inspection through the panels to further meet the needs of the direction that we received, they identified that first by looking at the cable that was installed. Further investigation, we found that the cable was marked, and on that cable marking it was marked for the required cable size. As further investigation went, the copper diameter size of the conductors inside the multi-conductor cable was thought to be smaller than what the stamped rating was on the jacket. Mr. Cummings. So, in other words, even if the specifications had asked for a certain thing, when you went to look at the wire, even if the specifications asked for it, the proper wire was not there, is that correct? Mr. Demming. That is correct. Mr. Cummings. I believe we have a picture of the counterfeit wires you found. Can we please display that on the screen? Where did you find this wire in the camp? Mr. Demming. This cable was at, this particular cable was going to the fryers from a panel inside the DFAC, the dining facility. Mr. Cummings. What problems might result from the use of such a counterfeit wire? Mr. Demming. Well, they might melt. Mr. Cummings. As they did. Mr. Demming. Correct. Mr. Cummings. After you did your report to the Embassy, the Embassy wrote this cable to OBO, and here is what they said: ``Several additional issues have arisen including discovery of counterfeit wire.'' So they reported what you found to Washington. Now I want to show you what Washington said in response. This was written on June 7th, and I ask that it be entered into the record. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.037 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.038 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.039 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.040 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] 43507.041 Mr. Cummings. The cable said this: ``We have also asked KBR and Post to identify any counterfeit wire and its location and they have not been able to do so.'' Mr. Demming, first of all, did you understand what I just said? Mr. Demming. Yes, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Cummings. I am asking you, Mr. Demming. Did anyone at OBO ever ask you about the counterfeit wire you found? Mr. Demming. No, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Cummings. Did anyone at OBO ask anyone on your team about it to your knowledge? Mr. Demming. Mr. Congressman, to my knowledge, no. Mr. Cummings. Do you know why OBO would claim in this cable that they asked you for this when they didn't? Do you know? Mr. Demming. No, I do not know that. Mr. Cummings. One of the documents that the committee subpoenaed is a fire safety inspection report of the Embassy complex itself. We understand that this inspection report documents a number of serious safety risks similar to those that KBR found at the guard base, but the State Department won't turn this document over to the committee. That is not a good sign. Covering up serious safety problems at the Embassy does not make them go away. Again, this word, counterfeit, is very significant, is it not? Mr. Demming. That is correct, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Cummings. Thank you very much. Chairman Waxman. Thank you, Mr. Cummings. Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis of Virginia. You showed the cable, this counterfeit cable, whatever, to the Embassy Post, is that right? Mr. Demming. That is correct, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Davis of Virginia. There is an inherent conflict sometimes between the Embassy Post and OBO in terms of what the specs should be. Everybody, they always are asking to try to get greater capacity, better walls, better flooring. In my experience, that has been true. They always want a little more and the State Department, to put these things on time and under budget, has certain specs. Do you have any evidence that this wire did not meet the specs? Mr. Demming. No, Mr. Congressman. I never saw the specs. Mr. Davis of Virginia. I think that is the nub of the matter. I think what we have here is that if you looked at American standards in a permanent facility, you would have looked for a different kind of wiring that would have supported what you were trying to put in. This was a temporary facility. The specs that were written were one thing, and maybe they should have been something else. I am not an expert in this area, but what I am looking for is evidence that the construction here was, in fact, counterfeit which would mean they represented it would be one thing and it was something else versus what the specifications called for since this was a temporary facility. I don't know what the specs called for and we can ask this in our next panel. You don't know what the specs called for, do you? Mr. Demming. No, Mr. Congressman, I do not. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Thank you. I mean I think that is the point we are trying to get at is they have made a leap over here without looking at the underlying specifications in the contract. This was a temporary facility. They had a budget. Do you have any evidence that this would not have met, well, let me just ask this. What capacity did the customer require for its dining facility? Do you know how many people they were trying to feed there? Mr. Demming. There was 1,200 personnel that were to live on that guard camp, and they served three meals a day. Mr. Davis of Virginia. What organization is KBR's customer for the O&M contract to operate the guard camp? Mr. Demming. Can you repeat that, Mr. Congressman? Mr. Davis of Virginia. What organization is your customer on the O&M contract to operate the guard camp? Who are you working for? Mr. Demming. The U.S. Army. Mr. Davis of Virginia. So your contract was with the U.S. Army, and this was a State Department facility. Mr. Demming. That is correct, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Now what capacity does that customer require for its dining facility? Mr. Demming. Capacity as in personnel? Mr. Davis of Virginia. Yes. Mr. Demming. There is 1,200 personnel. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Is that capacity different from the capacity the dining facility was built to support? Mr. Demming. I do not believe so, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Some have said that the reason for the problems with the wiring in the dining facility was caused by KBR installing more equipment than the facility was designed to accept. Now what is your view on that? Mr. Demming. That is not true. Mr. Davis of Virginia. But you haven't seen the specs. Mr. Demming. I have not seen the specifications, Mr. Congressman, but most of the kitchen equipment, commercial type kitchen equipment, was already installed not by KBR. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Right. Now OBO says they repaired the damage soon after and that the wiring issue was resolved, is that correct? Mr. Demming. Those were the readily identified issues on May 14th that they resolved. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Did they resolve those issues? Mr. Demming. Yes, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Pretty quickly? Mr. Demming. Yes, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Is the dining facility that you inspected capable of handling the capacity required by your customer? Mr. Demming. Yes, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Davis of Virginia. What improvements need to be made to the dining facility in order to meet your customer's capacity requirements or are they already done? Mr. Demming. In our contract and according to preventive MED issues and some of the Army regulations, we are required certain things to happen as far as how hot the water must be, how much water we must have to properly sanitize and wash the dishes. The food storage, we are required in some instances to maintain several days of storage because of the environment that we are in. Situations like that, Mr. Congressman, are required that we brought to the attention that facility did not meet. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Did you have concerns about your contractual liability for the dining facilities during the contract for the camp? Mr. Demming. Just when we were asked to do the O&M services is when we brought up those concerns. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Do you know if KBR submitted an offer to build the Embassy compound? Mr. Demming. No, I do not know that, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Davis of Virginia. But once again just to clarify, you have no knowledge or no relationship between what was done at the Embassy itself versus this separate contract for the dining facility, is that correct, temporary facility? Mr. Demming. That is correct, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Davis of Virginia. OK. Thank you very much. Mr. Tierney [presiding]. Thank you. Ms. Watson, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Watson. Thank you so much and thank you, Mr. Demming, for being here. In the OBO's cable responding to the Embassy's concerns, they essentially blame you at KBR for all of these problems, and I would like to have you respond to some of the statements. The basic argument seems to be that after the camp was turned over, KBR came in and added a lot of extra equipment that was never intended to be there. So let me read you what the OBO's cable actually says, and it is in paragraph three. It says this was a problem created solely by Post and KBR by putting additional equipment in the facility and not checking the electrical loads. The cable also says all such equipment appeared to be larger, higher power requirement than the manufacturer had intended based on our original specifications. This is the real reason for the facility overheating. So what is your response to that claim? Mr. Demming. Ms. Congresswoman, we did not provide any extra equipment to the kitchen facility other than the 20 foot by 8 foot container for a chiller or cooler unit which was placed outside the dining facility and wired to a separate circuit system as well as 20 by 8 foot container utilized as a freezer container. Those two items were brought over from the previous camp where the guards are living now, Camp Jackson, in order to store food there in preparation to move the guards over to the new camp and provide DFAC services by May 15th. Ms. Watson. Can you stipulate to that, the equipment that you brought in and the reason? Mr. Demming. Yes, ma'am. The equipment that we brought in was specifically for the additional food that was required and to start the DFAC services on May 15th. Ms. Watson. Is there a work order that would state that in writing? Was there a work order? Mr. Demming. There was some. There would had to have been a work order for us to do that, Ms. Congresswoman, and on the e- mail traffic, I have just been handed, from First Kuwaiti, on one of their preparations for a billing statement, they do include adding an existing chiller to be moved from the triple canopy camp and add existing freezer to be moved from the triple canopy camp. They were aware that these two items needed to be brought over and in working condition in order to meet the May 15th inaugural meal. Ms. Watson. Did you also check the electrical loads? Mr. Demming. We were asked to do the technical inspection after we received the administrative contracting letter to do the O&M on the camp, and upon that inspection is when we started to find some of the issues on the loads. However, it was not until the actual startup of the facility is when the events appeared. Ms. Watson. Did you document that inspection? Can we find it somewhere in writing what you found? Mr. Demming. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Ms. Watson. Now here is another statement that was in the cable. I am just repeating what the cable said. ``KBR confirmed and agreed specifically that they could manage and operate the facility based on the design.'' Is that true? Mr. Demming. I am sorry, Ms. Congresswoman. Can you say that again? Ms. Watson. I will repeat it, yes. ``KBR''--you--``confirmed and agreed specifically that they could manage and operate the facility based on the design.'' Did you know what the design was? Mr. Demming. No, Ms. Congresswoman. I really can't answer that. That might have been something from upper management, but to my knowledge we did not accept that based on design. Ms. Watson. So there was no confirmation. Mr. Demming. That is correct. Ms. Watson. From you, OK. Mr. Demming. From me. Ms. Watson. Now here is another statement. ``KBR created the problems and are now trying to put this matter on the construction of the camp.'' This says that KBR created the problems. What is your response to that? Mr. Demming. That is not true, Ms. Congresswoman. Ms. Watson. And you stipulate to that? You are under oath. Mr. Demming. Yes, ma'am. Ms. Watson. The cable not only blames KBR for the problems but also suggests a motive, and this is what was said in the cable. Mr. Tierney. Just finish up if you would, please. Thank you. Ms. Watson. OK, I will go real quickly. ``These items do not represent any health or safety risk as outlined in the 25 May cable and will not stop Post from occupying the camp if they desire. For whatever reason, it appears Post and KBR simply do not want to operate the camp for other reasons which have nothing to do with the construction or equipment installed as part of the original scope.'' Do you have any idea what is being said and does KBR have other reasons for not wanting to operate this camp? Mr. Demming. No, Ms. Congresswoman. I do not understand the justification of that statement. However, if I may, I would like to respond to your question about the safety of the camp. On May 15th, I received an e-mail from my electrical superintendent working out there, describing how our guys have gotten shocked touching up against the frame of the trailer. None of our wiring was powered up at the time of the modifications that we were doing over there for the May 15th meal. So they shut down the breakers one by one to find the cause. One of the feeds for the oven had actually melted. This was a feeder wire to the ovens, equipment KBR did not supply, that actually melted and came into contact with the trailer, causing personnel in there to get shocked or electrocuted. It did not trip the circuit breaker, the over-current protection, because it was improperly grounded. That is another safety issue that we discovered during the May 14th startup. This goes on, ma'am. Mr. Tierney. Thank you. We can cover that maybe another time. Thank you, Ms. Watson. Ms. Watson. I will continue to probe this if we have a second round. Mr. Tierney. Thank you very much. Mr. Westmoreland, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Westmoreland. Thank you and thank you for coming to testify. Are you aware of any labor abuse that was involved? Mr. Demming. No, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Westmoreland. Let me ask you another question referring to some of these pictures that were submitted. Are you familiar with the pictures that have been submitted? Mr. Demming. Yes, I am, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Westmoreland. The last picture shows and I know the exact term for it but shows the measurement of the wires. Mr. Demming. That is correct. Mr. Westmoreland. Could you tell me what those numbers actually say on that picture? Mr. Demming. That is correct. On the top picture, the micrometer reading is the cable that we buy, that we have had in stock from our purchases. The 3.9 is the diameter dimension of the copper wire inside that cable. It is a multi-conductor cable. If you take the diameter divided by 2 squared and do some mathematics, you get the area in millimeters of that cable which comes to a little over 10 millimeters. That is referred to as a 10 millimeter square conductor or multi-conductor cable. The bottom picture shows the suspect counterfeit cable marked clearly 10 millimeter square. With the micrometer gauge on that, it is reading 2.8. Again, if you do the mathematics, Mr. Congressman, the area square of that conductor will come out to 6 millimeters. That 6 millimeter difference is a significant amperage load difference on that cable of what it is capable of carrying. Mr. Westmoreland. Thank you. I notice you have a calculator there next to it. So I am assuming that you just can't do this in your mind. It takes some type of calculation to come up with these millimeters. Is that correct? Mr. Demming. That is correct, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Westmoreland. How many electricians have you ever seen on the job that carried around one of these whatever those things were with a calculator? Mr. Demming. Micrometer. Mr. Westmoreland. Have you ever seen any electricians have those in their nail pouch or their screwdriver belt or anything? Mr. Demming. No, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Westmoreland. OK. In some of the other pictures, I noticed, and I am in the building business. I have never seen red, blue and yellow wires. There seems to be some type of color coding for these wires. What are the different colors? Why are some of the wires blue, some yellow and some red? Mr. Demming. Mr. Congressman, that type of cabling and color coding is indigenous to that region. Mr. Westmoreland. I am sorry. Mr. Demming. That type of color coding and cabling is indigenous to that region. Mr. Westmoreland. OK. So when I look at the panel box and I see red, yellow and blue, that would be some kind of indication that somebody might have a language barrier or something, but he would know to plug the red wire in the red and the yellow into the yellow and the blue into the blue. Mr. Demming. Typically, just like the United States, Mr. Congressman, we have black, red, blue as an indication of phasing, and this is the same configuration. Just they use different colors over there, and that would be considered what we say RYB which would be the same as black, red, blue. Mr. Westmoreland. I have been in the construction business a long time and seen a lot of panel boxes, and I have never seen any that had the color codes for the cables to go into, but I understand that. Not only is there maybe something lost, I guess, in interpretation or in wiring diagrams or differences in building codes or whatever, but also the thickness of this wire would be something if you were using metric or American or whatever to try to get in place that this was only a 6 millimeter. Do you know if by just cutting that wire with your hand that you would have noticed any difference? Mr. Demming. Mr. Congressman, I might be a little rusty on that after being in the administrative portion of this industry for a while, but the gentlemen that are in the field and do this every day, it is very typical for them to distinguish the differences on sight. Mr. Westmoreland. OK, and let me ask you another question. You mentioned the ground wiring to the boxes, and I looked and I couldn't tell where the ground wire would go. I didn't see the bus bar, I guess, or whatever on the box itself. But how much would it cost to run a ground wire and hook it to these panels? What is an estimate? Are we talking about $10 million, $1 million, $100,000, $1,000? What would be the cost to correct this grounding situation and really replace? Mr. Tierney. Mr. Westmoreland, we are going to let him ask that first question, if we might, because your time is expired and I do want to hear the answer. Then we will move on. Thank you. Mr. Demming. Mr. Congressman, I could not give you a price on the cost of that because of the intricacy of the construction involved. The cable has already been run. In some spots and areas of the camp, they have poured concrete roadways over, and this would have to be tallied up as square footage. Mr. Tierney. Thank you very much. Mr. Westmoreland. Just to followup on that, just one question, just one quick thing. Mr. Tierney. If you can keep it very, very, very brief. Mr. Westmoreland. Why would you have to run a ground wire under a road? I am confused about that. Mr. Demming. That is the way they ran the feeders, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Tierney. Thank you. Mr. Lynch, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Lynch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for holding this hearing. Thank you, Mr. Demming, for helping the committee with its work. I am going to let this electrical thing go at some point, but it would seem to me. I spent 20 years working, strapping on the work boots and working on a constructionsite before coming to Congress, and I know my way around a constructionsite. This is a pretty basic mistake here. This is basic. Either the people doing the work at the very basic level should have recognized what they were doing. If they knew what they were doing, they would have known this was wrong. That is the workers themselves, the workers themselves wiring this job for the intended purpose. It should have been painfully obvious that they were making huge mistakes here. Then if you go to the next level, the foremen or forewomen that are supervising the actual work, they should have known. Then, of course, whoever is above them, the supervisors on the site, they should have known. Then the quality control people who are supposed to be checking this work, they should have known. This is like putting your pants on backward. This is something that should have been obvious to anybody who was familiar with electrical work, regardless of what country, regardless of what standard. This was just totally unacceptable. When you turn the appliances on and the wires start to melt, you know you have yourself a problem. So I think this is something that is inherent in the whole system here. It is not a technical misreading. I have been over to Iraq seven times now, and a lot of that time has been spent reviewing Iraq reconstruction projects, working with Stuart Bowen. Every time I go to a job site, and it is the same everywhere, whether I visit Al Qaim. KBR has a project up there at the border entry on the Syrian border. I go through there, and I try to talk to the workers and had an Iraqi interpreter which was to no purpose because they were all from India, all these workers from India. Then we visit a water sewage treatment facility up near Irbil, and they are all Pakistanis. So I couldn't talk to them. We went to a couple of projects in and around Baghdad. They were Chinese and Korean. It just makes me wonder. Here we are. We are trying to sell democracy to these folks, the Iraqis. We are pumping in $12 billion a month there, and yet every job I go to the Iraqis aren't working. It is like we have our policy wrong. If we are going to convince them democracy is the way to go, you don't do that through the Defense Department. The way you show them that democracy works is to provide them with jobs. If they were employed, maybe instead of employing, and God bless the Indians and the Pakistanis and the Chinese and the Koreans, but they have major problems in Iraq right now. We are providing the money. We are providing the construction projects. We are supposed to be providing the oversight and the supervision. It seems to me that you don't export democracy through the Defense Department. You do it through the Commerce Department, the State Department and letting these folks go to work and actually seeing what a normal life is like. Take these people out of employment. The unemployment rate in Iraq among males between ages 18 and 35 years old is probably up over 50 percent. Put some of these folks to work. I know you are probably not the guy responsible for that decision, but somewhere someone along the line ought to figure out that if we put some of these Iraqis to work instead of bringing in the lowest wage workers from around the world and exploiting them, it might help the situation there. Is that the practice? I mean everywhere I go, it seems to be that the workers are from somewhere else. Even though there is a ton of unemployed Iraqis all over Iraq, doing God knows what, we seem to be employing through our tax dollars, through government contracting, we are employing everybody but the Iraqis. I just want to know if that is the policy and is that something that you have seen. Mr. Demming. Mr. Congressman, I employ over 300 Iraqis in the engineering and construction side of KBR's support for USMI. Mr. Lynch. Out of how many people? Mr. Demming. That is out of 400 and some odd people. Mr. Lynch. So 75 percent of your entire department. How about KBR on the ground in Iraq, how about the total number there? Mr. Demming. I am not understanding your question. I am on the ground in Iraq. Mr. Lynch. No, no. I am talking about Kellogg Brown and Root, all your operations. Mr. Demming. Oh, the whole operations, I don't have that information. Mr. Lynch. All right. I will let it go at that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Tierney. Thank you, Mr. Lynch. Mr. Issa, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Issa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Demming, it is kind of interesting. This is a hearing in search of an enemy, and I keep wondering how many and when they are going to turn on you because obviously this has been the Democrat agenda from day one. Halliburton, once managed by the Vice President. KBR, owned by him. Obviously, you are bad guys as a result. It is sort of interesting that you are here today as a neutral observer, somebody to give us information. It is sort of amazing when it is convenient, KBR is what it is, an incredibly knowledgeable global builder who understand the right way, the wrong way, the expeditious way to do things. Do you see any irony there in your role? Mr. Demming. I will defer that comment. Mr. Issa. You are a wise man. I see the irony, fortunately, for both of us. I am not an engineer, but I did once operate an engineer company for the Army and did a little other work. What this rat's nest looks like to me is like most of the 20 by 20's we in the Corps of Engineers built. It looks like every piece of temporary expeditious building that ever went on when you didn't go for permits and you used romex or whatever you had to go from point to point to get a job done. Is that what it looks like to you? Mr. Demming. Yes, it does, Mr. Congressman. I would just like to iterate that in the National Electrical Code, Article 590, temporary refers to 90 days or less. Mr. Issa. Would it surprise you to know that 75 percent of Fort Ward when I was there was temporary buildings? They were built in World War II. I know I look old, but I wasn't there in World War II or in 90 days after. Mr. Demming. No. No, Mr. Congressman. I was stationed there prior to going overseas with the U.S. Army in 1971. Mr. Issa. Now the State Department estimate--I know you don't have an estimate--is that to do the basic compliance wiring for the items that are shown here, it is $4,000 to $6,000 to correct that. I am assuming that they are going to drive in a ground on the building side and pick up a new ground there. Is that something that if you were having to retrofit this, you would figure you could do, and with the labor force cost there, you could do for $4,000 to $6,000, just a rough guess, to correct it, simply to make it safe? Mr. Demming. Mr. Congressman, I can't comment on that price. We run a different system to make things safe because of the ground and the environment over there. It is called a solid grounding system. Mr. Issa. OK. I understand. It is probably more than we can get into for how we would establish a ground, but basically let us switch to another question. You have operated out of construction trailers for a long time, haven't you? Mr. Demming. Yes, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Issa. You consider them temporary. Mr. Demming. No, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Issa. You don't consider a construction trailer temporary? Please, you don't have to say Mister and Congressman. Mr. Demming. A construction trailer, yes, I do. The environment that we are in there at this particular point in time, it is running over 90 days. Mr. Issa. No, no. I understand that, but I just want to make sure I understand that construction trailers aren't permanent. The connection, the actual drop, the electrical drop to a construction trailer is a separate consideration. It is done normally with a black multi-conductor that comes down. You do different connections on a constructionsite. Mr. Demming. That is correct. Mr. Issa. OK. Often on a constructionsite, and I am not making any apologies for this kind of wiring, but these wires and how they are run, these things, they are often done expeditiously, quick order. Is that true on a constructionsite? Mr. Demming. The typical wiring is on the startup of a project or the ending of a project or during a project is done hastily. Mr. Issa. Was anyone killed as a result of these mistakes? Mr. Demming. When I first landed on the ground in 2003, we did have several soldiers get electrocuted to death, sir. Mr. Issa. As a result of these trailers? Mr. Demming. As a result of bad wiring. Mr. Issa. These trailers? Mr. Demming. Not these trailers. I am not sure of the actual. Mr. Issa. OK. I just wanted to find out because that is a separate concern and each accident investigation should be done. Last question because my time is expiring and it is an important one, and I think it is one that we all need to have an answer to. In this combat zone, if you do not source materials at a fairly expensive amount directly from a known source, if you simply buy on the local market or through intermediaries in Iraq, is it likely to get counterfeits and is that one of the reasons that KBR and other prime contractors pay extra to have known sources they are buying from in the region rather than picking up on the domestic market? I am particularly referring to the micrometer measurings and the counterfeits that obviously got into this project. Mr. Demming. That would be a concern, but it is not common or atypical. We have acquired the proper material in-country through local purchasing. Mr. Tierney. Thank you, Mr. Issa. Ms. Norton, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate this hearing. The State Department, we have been hearing for months now as well as other civilian employees have eschewed going to Iraq even in the safe zones. We are trying to get our soldiers out. We hope we would leave Embassy employees there. This hearing is important to establish whether it is safe for people to be there and whether the United States of America is making it safe. I understand that you have brought some pictures with you, and I am going to ask a series of questions to try to get to responsibility here. We can look and say, well, you could always fix that. I would like to know who is responsible. We are now looking at this picture before you. Could you describe for us what the problem is as you see it in your expertise? Mr. Demming. Ms. Congresswoman, this particular picture here is showing the cabling branch circuits from all the other areas of that particular section of modular unit of the DFAC. This is underneath the DFAC. Ms. Norton. This is what, sorry? Mr. Demming. Underneath the DFAC, underneath the floor. Ms. Norton. What is the specific problem that you see? Mr. Demming. OK. If you look at the cabling there, the wire nuts which show the connections where the wires may have been spliced together, we call them wire nuts, the little red things. Typically are installed in a box with a cover. Ms. Norton. And it is not with a cover, what is the problem? What is the problem? What is the danger? What is the problem? Mr. Demming. These splices are not done correctly according to any standard or code. There is no supporting on the wire as well as some of the construction. The holes going through the 2 by 4 typically require about an inch and a quarter from the edge. You can see the holes are drilled right at the edge which would allow for a nail to puncture the cable. Ms. Norton. Did KBR do this? Was it done prior to KBR? Did First Kuwaiti do it? Who did this? Mr. Demming. This is the BESF camp. KBR did not perform the construction on this camp. Ms. Norton. Can we go to the next picture? Would you describe, looking at this picture, if there is a problem, what is the specific problem? Mr. Demming. I believe what the photographer was trying to depict here is there is no ground bar in this panel. This would be the submain panel that is fed directly from the main panel from the generators. Ms. Norton. When you say ground bar, make layman dummies like me understand what you mean. Mr. Demming. I am sorry. Excuse me, Ms. Congresswoman. Ms. Norton. And what the specific problem is from the point of view of not having the ground bar. Mr. Demming. There is always the availability of being shocked, and there is no protection for the over-current device, the breakers there, to operate properly. Ms. Norton. Thank you. Let us go to the next picture. Would you describe the problem there, the specific problem in layman's terms? What are we looking at? What is the problem in layman's terms? What is the danger? Mr. Demming. As you can see, the feet and this receptacle is on the floor, improperly installed. Ms. Norton. So the feet, that is where you plug? Mr. Demming. Correct. That is a receptacle. Ms. Norton. What is the problem with that? Mr. Demming. It is on the floor, installed improperly. It would be subject to water and moisture every time they clean the DFAC. Ms. Norton. Who did this? Did KBR do it? Was it done prior to KBR arriving on the scene? Mr. Demming. This was done during the construction of the BESF camp, not by KBR. Ms. Norton. Let us go to the next picture. Next picture, please. Describe what this picture is. If there is a problem, what is the problem? Mr. Demming. OK. These are 100 amp panels installed inside the dining facility. Again, you have to look really close at these pictures. The grounding where the green wires are, the main ground going back to the main panel, is not correctly or non-existent. Ms. Norton. So what is the problem from the point of view of somebody in the building, for example? Mr. Demming. This again, there is a prelude to electric shock and a safety hazard, and the over-current devices won't work properly. Ms. Norton. Next picture, please. Would you describe any problem, if you see a problem? First, tell us what this is a picture of and if you see a problem, would you tell us what the problem is? Mr. Demming. During one of the technical inspections we had after the event where people opened up some of the commercial cooking equipment installed by others in this DFAC, on the right side where the brown, blue and yellow cables are connected to that terminal strip, are incorrectly terminated there and the phasing is incorrect. Ms. Norton. With what result, perhaps? Mr. Demming. That would cause. We have a hot wire on the neutral as well as on the line, so that would cause a short or 400 volts instead of 230 volts for operation. That may cause a fire. Ms. Norton. Did KBR install these cables or were they installed before KBR arrived on the scene? Mr. Demming. This was again, Ms. Congresswoman, installed by others. Mr. Tierney. Thank you very much, Ms. Norton. Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Tierney. Ms. McCollum, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. McCollum. Thank you, Mr. Chair. When I am in a kitchen, whether it is here or if I am visiting someone, and I do travel. I am in a lot of developing countries. I have confidence that when I plug something in, I am not going to receive an electrical shock because there is, as you described, an international code, correct? Mr. Demming. I am sorry, Congresswoman. Can you speak a little louder? Ms. McCollum. When I travel somewhere and I travel internationally, and I am in developing countries quite often. I am in U.S. embassies. I am in USAID hospital facilities or a small type, the equivalent of a Motel 6, not even a four star hotel but just staying some place. I have confidence that when I go to plug something in, when I go to flip a switch, that I won't be electrocuted because there is an international standard, correct? Mr. Demming. Not necessarily, Congresswoman. Ms. McCollum. Well, I am certainly seeing that, based on what you are showing me here, I should have very little confidence of anything that has been paid for by U.S. taxpayers' money, that there has been any kind of international standard followed based on these pictures that you showed me. You would have no confidence without inspecting something yourself before you plug something in, in this compound, based on what you have shared with us today, correct? Mr. Demming. Let me see if I understand your question, Congresswoman. The countries you have been in, developing countries, the environment is atypical. Ms. McCollum. I am saying U.S. buildings that I have been in where U.S. employees are staying or where the USAID has built a hospital or a clinic or embassies, that I should feel fairly confident that if I flip the light switch, I am not going to be electrocuted. Mr. Demming. Correct. Ms. McCollum. But from what I am seeing here and from you have shown me, especially in a kitchen area where there is water and grease and a lot of electrical appliances being plugged in, that I would be a fool to have any confidence that if I plug something in or flipped a switch if I was a worker there, that I might not be severely shocked or even electrocuted. Mr. Demming. Hopefully, the entity that would release the building or facility prior to it opening to the public would have made these inspections and corrected all those faults, and that is kind of the position that we are playing here right now, Congresswoman. Ms. McCollum. So that when you have your employees go in there and they plug something in or turn on a switch, that you don't have a worker that is severely injured or possibly even killed by this poor workmanship. Mr. Demming. That is correct. Ms. McCollum. I found it interesting, one of the questions. You had spoken about counterfeit wiring earlier, and someone said well, if you follow the specifications, there isn't a problem. Specifications don't ever call for counterfeit wiring, do they? Mr. Demming. No, Congresswoman. Ms. McCollum. No, I wouldn't think so. Specifications wouldn't call for, as you described in here, an outlet on the floor of a dining area where there is going to be water because people mop it up. To have a non-waterproof, flush-mounted plug-in as one of the pictures showed, that wouldn't be a specification that a U.S. contractor would expect going into a dining facility, would they? Mr. Demming. There are codes that regulate that type of installation, Congresswoman. Ms. McCollum. In your opinion, before KBR comes into take over running the facility and using it to prepare the meals, would you have assumed, because U.S. taxpayers' dollars were being used to construct this, even if it is temporary, this dining facility, there would have been some oversight, some inspection to make sure that when you walked in that day, you could have plugged in the equipment, flipped a switch and started operating as you had planned? Mr. Demming. We do perform those inspections prior to operating or taking over a facility, Congresswoman. Ms. McCollum. What was your reaction when you sent the cable saying that there were problems, when you went up the chain of command, saying that there are problems with this? What was the Government's reaction, who had contracted out and paid for this service? Shocked? Surprised? Had they inspected it? Mr. Demming. They showed concern, Congresswoman. Mr. Tierney. Thank you, Ms. McCollum. Ms. McCollum. Thank you. Mr. Tierney. Mr. Sarbanes, do you have any questions? Mr. Sarbanes. Just a couple, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Tierney. You are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Sarbanes. Thank you. Mr. Demming, KBR's connection to all this, I am trying to understand. This is a basic factual question. In terms of First Kuwaiti, was the prime contractor for this base camp or guard camp that was put together, and KBR was coming in behind for what purpose? Can you just tell me that again? Mr. Demming. We were asked to care for the facilities under an operations and maintenance agreement with the Department of State Facilities Management and our client, the U.S. Army. When we performed the technical inspection prior to accepting the operations and maintenance agreement is when we started noticing. Mr. Sarbanes. So First Kuwaiti was not a subcontractor to KBR in this instance. Mr. Demming. No, Congressman. Mr. Sarbanes. But has First Kuwaiti been a subcontractor for KBR in other situations? Mr. Demming. Yes, sir, Mr. Congressman. We have used First Kuwaiti for other services as a subcontractor. Mr. Sarbanes. In connection with this Embassy project or with other things separate from the project? Mr. Demming. With other smaller projects. Mr. Sarbanes. The problems that you discovered or found when you got there, for the moment, all your knowledge is that related to this guard camp. You don't have any knowledge yet that there are similar problems in the other parts of the project, the larger Embassy project. Is that what you said? Mr. Demming. That is correct, Congressman. Mr. Sarbanes. Are the teams of people that were deployed on this guard camp, whether electrical teams or others, are they completely separate from teams that might be deployed to other parts of the project, as far as you know, even though they are all First Kuwaiti employees? Do you understand what I am asking you? Mr. Demming. No, Mr. Congressman. Could you repeat that? Mr. Sarbanes. The First Kuwaiti employees who would have worked on the guard camp, would any of those employees either have worked on the other parts of the Embassy project or is there a possibility they will work on the Embassy project going forward? Mr. Demming. I can't answer that, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Sarbanes. But that is certainly possible, wouldn't you say? Mr. Demming. I would imagine so. It is not a very big place. The extent of some of the other contracts we use First Kuwaiti for is mainly concrete, providing concrete, not any, no projects to this extent. Mr. Sarbanes. I was looking through the submitted testimony of First Kuwaiti, and they said here with respect to the guard camp that although constructed by First Kuwaiti, it is a project separate from that of the Embassy with separate budgets, different First Kuwaiti management teams and different State Department supervisors. I guess the implication of that being that whatever problems there may be associated with the guard camp are things that could be kind of confined to that because there are these separate management teams and separate budgets. But you have indicated it is certainly possible that the actual employees that would be deployed to work on an electrical component of the larger project could be some of the same employees that worked on this guard camp, right? I mean that is very possible. Mr. Demming. To my recollection, Congressman, I don't know anything about that. Our involvement over there is very limited as far as the correlation between. Mr. Sarbanes. Would you agree, though, that would certainly be something we would want to know, that you would want to know? You would want to know whether the folks that were responsible for this shoddy workmanship, where they are going next, what is their next project, what is the next footprint they are going to make on the larger Embassy project. I mean you would agree that would be something reasonable to know. Mr. Demming. I would like to defer that question, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Sarbanes. Thank you. I have no further questions. Mr. Tierney. Thank you, Mr. Sarbanes. Mr. Cannon, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Cannon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your holding the hearing and would like to yield to the ranking member, Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Thank you. Let me just give a perspective. This is a punch list item we are talking about. You plugged it in. The wiring didn't work. This is a firm fixed-price contract. First Kuwaiti hasn't been paid a penny yet, to my knowledge. Do you have any knowledge that they have been paid anything, Mr. Demming? Mr. Demming. No, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Davis of Virginia. The way this works is they haven't been paid a penny. They have to fix it. They have to deliver it. We pay for it. We don't pay for it until it is perfect. It is not uncommon in construction whether they are complex construction projects or a temporary project like this, that things in the punch list go wrong. Sometimes there is painting speckled, something gets damaged and the like. Isn't that your experience, that there are usually numerous punch list items on inspections? Mr. Demming. Yes, there is, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Thank you. So let us put this in perspective. My understanding is the cost that it would take for these repairs, wiring and so on, if they need to be done--again we don't know what the specs were but we know what the expectation was--is $4,000 to $6,000. It costs more to hold this hearing than it would to fix this, and this is under a firm fixed-price contract. Let me just ask this. KBR does do business with First Kuwaiti, right? Mr. Demming. Yes, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Davis of Virginia. You have not found them an irresponsible contractor? Mr. Demming. Mr. Congressman, I don't deal with the contracts, only with the projects. Mr. Davis of Virginia. But you deal with them on the projects. Have they been a bad contractor? Mr. Demming. They usually work for us in the capacity of providing something. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Do they do a good job or a bad job? Mr. Demming. They do OK. Mr. Davis of Virginia. All of your knowledge that you have testified on today is about the temporary trailer area, not the Embassy, is that correct? Mr. Demming. That is correct. Mr. Davis of Virginia. You have really no knowledge about the Embassy contract, per se, which was hyped in the headline for this hearing today. Mr. Demming. That is correct. Mr. Davis of Virginia. I just wanted to clarify that. I think that is all I have. I would yield. Mr. Cannon. I would be happy to yield to Mr. Issa. Mr. Issa. Thank you. You are familiar in Iraq with the other temporary structures that are military, aren't you? You have seen the thousands of tents that our troops are in? Mr. Demming. Yes, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Issa. Have you looked at the electrical on any of those? Mr. Demming. We have in the past, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Issa. Just quickly, they have been there more than 90 days, right? Mr. Demming. Yes, sir, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Issa. In some cases, we have had to replace canvas because it sort of eroded over the time of this war, isn't that your understanding? Mr. Demming. Yes, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Issa. In fact, what we have is laid on top of the ground, black double-insulated, multi-conductor running to those tents from my experience. Is that roughly your experience? Mr. Demming. Typically, on the unit that I run with the USMI, Mr. Congressman, all our cabling if it is going to ground, even a tent, is buried. It is put under ground a minimum of 2 feet of 750 millimeters. This is for safety purposes. In case there is an event or an IDF attack, we have to run. Mr. Issa. I understand they have been going back and retrofitting. Perhaps I should have said on my first of many trips to Iraq this is how they did it and they have been going back and retrofitting. Have you been involved with other combat engineer type operations, though, over the years in support or past experience? Have you seen how they typically go? Mr. Demming. No, Congressman. Mr. Issa. Well, let me just run you through my limited experience. Typically, you come in. You roll a trailer in. You roll out some black multi-conductor of the correct amperage. You hook it up. You put the other end on a generator. You crank it up. You got a light bulb going and a couple of plugs. Then as you have resources, you come back and do updates and modifications as you need to be. By the way, no excuse for any safety violations, no excuse for bare wires or absence of grounds. But isn't that sort of the normal way you do it in a combat environment when you bring in temporary structures is you get the things up and operational and get people out of the elements and then you do continuous refinements and improvements? Has that been your experience? Mr. Demming. Mr. Congressman, I believe the standards for that would 281-1. Mr. Issa. But isn't it true that the Corps of Engineers in a combat environment operates under what is necessary to accomplish the mission? Isn't that your understanding in a combat environment? Mr. Demming. I was not a combat engineer, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Issa. OK, maybe that was a luxury you didn't have. Isn't it true that these trailers were made in another country and brought in and that many of these flaws which needed to be corrected--the State Department says $6,000 worth--would normally happen if you had a one time subcontractor and you are trying to get things done in a combat environment on a temporary basis in order to accomplish a mission? Isn't that reasonable that you take the trailer and make the retrofit because you can't afford to wait another 4 months to get structures? Mr. Demming. Yes, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Issa. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Tierney. Thank you. I just have one question before I let you go, Mr. Demming, and I thank you for your patience. Given your experience and given your observations out there, knowing that the same company has done the camp area as well as the Embassy, would you advise that we ought to have any concern about the electrical wiring in other parts of the Embassy? Mr. Demming. I am sorry, Congressman. Can you repeat the last part of that. Mr. Tierney. Given your experience, given your observations and understanding that the same company that is the contractor for the work that you have been talking about is the same contractor for the Embassy, ought there be some concern about the wiring in other parts of the Embassy? Mr. Demming. I would really rather not make that determination here. Mr. Tierney. I am asking for an opinion, so you don't need to make a determination. I am asking for an opinion based on your background and your observations. Mr. Demming. I would like to defer that opinion, Mr. Congressman. Mr. Tierney. I know you would, sir, but I am asking for your opinion. Mr. Demming. My opinion, there may be concern here. Mr. Tierney. Thank you, Mr. Demming. I want to thank you very much for your testimony today and thank the members of the panel as well. You may be happy to leave that table if you would, and the other witnesses will come on. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, point of order, I thought we were doing a second round. Mr. Tierney. No, sir, we are not. Mr. Davis of Virginia. Oh, OK. Mr. Tierney. Thank you, Mr. Demming. Mr. Demming. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Tierney. We will take about a 1-minute break here while the second panel gets up here. [Recess.] Mr. Tierney. The committee and the subcommittee will now receive testimony from our second panel. I would like to introduce the members of our panel, the witnesses that are here to offer information about First Kuwaiti labor practices from their perspective. Mr. John Owens is the former First Kuwaiti construction foreman on the Embassy project and Mr. Rory Mayberry is the former First Kuwaiti subcontractor medic on the Embassy project. Thank you both for being here today and for sharing your testimony and experiences. I know it took courage to come here and to participate. As for your full statements, they are going to be entered onto the record and transcript. You may give a brief account of that if you like. You have 5 minutes to talk. You might want to summarize your testimony so you try to get it in the 5-minutes. I will try not to cut you off but may remind you if you are going over. It is the policy of the committee and of the subcommittee to swear you in before you testify, so I ask you to raise your right hands and stand if you would. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Tierney. The record will please reflect that both witnesses have answered in the affirmative. Again, I ask you to proceed and remember the 5-minute rule if you could. Mr. Owens, I ask you to go first. STATEMENTS OF JOHN OWENS, FORMER EMPLOYEE, FIRST KUWAITI TRADING AND CONTRACTING CO.; AND RORY MAYBERRY, FORMER EMPLOYEE, FIRST KUWAITI TRADING AND CONTRACTING CO. STATEMENT OF JOHN OWENS Mr. Owens. Thank you to Chairman Waxman and Chairman Tierney and the members of the full committee for inviting me to testify here today. My statement will address labor abuse, human trafficking and other concerning issues that I personally witnessed on the constructionsite at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. My name is John Owens. I have worked on construction projects for many years, and since 2002 I have worked on U.S. Embassy projects. My specialty is architectural finishing. After I finished working with the U.S. Government on the construction of the Embassy in Cambodia, I went looking for a new project and I signed on with First Kuwait"
