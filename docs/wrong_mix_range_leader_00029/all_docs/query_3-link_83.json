        "text": "Tarleton State University offers student financial aid in the form of loans, grants, work opportunities and scholarships to help assist with your educational expenses while attending Tarleton State University. To determine a student's eligibility for financial aid, the student and parent (if the student is dependent) must first complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or Texas Application for State Financial Aid (TASFA).\n\nTo apply for financial aid, a student must submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year (opens October 1 each year). The 2024-2025 FAFSA had changes that delayed its opening until December 2023. To access the online FAFSA you must go to www.studentaid.gov. A student and parent must first apply for their FSA ID. The FSA ID is a unique federal identifier that allows you to complete the FAFSA, make FAFSA corrections, and access your federal financial aid history. The FSA ID is also accessed through the www.studentaid.gov website. In some cases, you may be able to only file the Texas Application for State Financial Aid (TASFA). The TASFA is accessed on our Financial Aid website or by visiting www.collegeforalltexans.com. The Office of Financial Aid will determine the types of college financial aid you’re eligible for based on your FAFSA/TASFA.\n\nPriority Dates\n\nPriority for campus-based funding is given to students who meet certain income eligibility requirements and have submitted their FAFSA to the Central Processor on or before March 15, 2024 for priority consideration. The FAFSA becomes available to begin filing October 1 of each year. The 2024-2024 FAFSA was delayed in opening until December 2023.\n\nDeadline\n\nIn order to ensure that your financial aid will be available by the week before fall semester classes, you must have submitted all required documents no later than June 1.\n\nApplicants are responsible for the timeliness and promptness of their applications.\n\nGrants\n\nGrants are awarded based on financial need by the Federal Government or State of Texas. This form of financial aid does not require repayment. To be considered for a grant, complete the Free Application for Federal Students Aid (FAFSA) or the Texas Application for State Financial Aid (TASFA). If you are unsure which to use, learn when to use each application. TASFA students are not eligible for federal grants.\n\nFederal Pell Grants\n\nPell Grants are available to eligible undergraduates who have not already earned a bachelor's degree and demonstrate financial aid on their FAFSA. Pell Grant funds are disbursed based on number of hours enrolled as of the Pell Census date (or the 12th class day). All other sources of aid will be given in addition to the Pell Grant.\n\nFederal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG)\n\nThese grants, ranging from $100 to $4,000 per year, are available to help needy undergraduates meet education expenses.\n\nThe Texas Public Education Grant (TPEG)\n\nThis grant was established by the Texas State Legislature to help needy undergraduate students. Under this program, students may receive grants ranging from $100 and up.\n\nToward Excellence, Access and Success (TEXAS) Grant Program\n\nThe TEXAS Grant Program was established in 1999 by the Texas Legislature to provide need-based financial assistance to resident Texas students who completed the Recommended or Distinguished high school program. Eligible students may receive an amount up to the cost of required tuition and fees each academic year of eligibility. Some restrictions apply.\n\nTo be eligible for the TEXAS grant, a student must be a Texas resident and graduate from a public or accredited private high school and must demonstrate exceptional financial need as determined by the FAFSA or TASFA. For 2024-2025, March 15, 2024 is the state priority deadline for identifying eligible students to be given priority in receiving awards through this state financial aid program.\n\nDetailed information is available on the Student Financial Aid Office website.\n\nTarleton Tuition Grant\n\nThese grants are available to undergraduate students who are Texas residents and demonstrate need based upon data provided on the Free Application of Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Priority is given to those students who file the FAFSA by the priority deadline.\n\nTeacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant\n\nThe Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program provides up to $4,000 per year in grants for graduate and undergraduate students who intend to teach full-time in high-need subject areas for at least four years at low income secondary or elementary school(s). To be considered for a TEACH grant, you must be formally admitted to one of the following TEACH Grant eligible programs of study at Tarleton State University:\n\nUndergraduate: Bachelor of Science in Elementary Teacher Education or Bachelor of Science in Secondary Teacher Education\n\nGraduate: Master of Science in Curriculum and Instruction\n\nEligibility requirements and the TEACH Grant Application are located on the Financial Aid Office website.\n\nTarleton Promise Grant\n\nThe Tarleton Promise Program will cover the remaining bill after a qualifying student's scholarships and grants are applied to their account. The promise will pay for tuition, required fees (including parking), room and board (for on campus housing) and provides a semester allowance for text books. Tarleton Promise Grant requirements are located on the Tarleton Financial Aid website.\n\nChildren of Fallen Heroes Grant\n\nChildren of Fallen Heroes funding is available to Pell eligible students whose parent or guardian was a public safety officer and died in the line of duty. Specific eligibility requirements are located on the Financial Aid Office website.\n\nIraq and Afghanistan Service Grant (IASG)\n\nAdditional aid eligibility under the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant (IASG) is available to students whose parent or guardian died as a result of U.​S.​ military service in Iraq or Afghanistan after September 11, 2001. Specific eligibility requirements are located on the Financial Aid Office website.\n\nStudent Employment Opportunities\n\nWork-Study\n\nFederal Work-Study (FWS) and Texas College Work-Study are supported by the Federal and Texas Governments, and provide students with an opportunity to help cover educational expenses through part-time employment. Work-Study positions are available on-campus at numerous departments as well as off-campus at selected non-profit employers. Off-campus positions are community service-based employment positions that are part of the Community Service Work-Study Program. Students must show financial need (must complete the FAFSA or TASFA) to be eligible for work-study. Funds are awarded on a first-come, first-serve basis with priority awarding given to students currently/previously employed under the College Work Study. All wages are on an hourly basis, and work schedules are arranged around class schedules.\n\nIntern 2 Learn Program\n\nIntern 2 Learn is an innovative, on-campus student employment program for undergraduates. The program is designed to provide relevant work experience and qualify as a R.E.A.L. (Real World Experience Applied to Learning) internship for participating students. The best part is that the program benefits both students and employing departments! Interns work in positions related to their academic curriculum and are eligible to promote to higher levels of responsibility and pay as their experience and knowledge levels grow. Employing departments enjoy the opportunity to mentor and coach student interns so that they function as additional staff.\n\nIntern 2 Learn Program Provides:\n\nOpportunities to work on-campus where supervisors understand academic schedules and demands\n\nR.E.A.L. participation; adding to your learning experience at Tarleton State University\n\nResume building experience to give you a head start on your chosen career\n\nGraduate Assistantship\n\nAssistantships for graduate students are available in most academic departments that offer a master's program as well as other university support areas. Most assistantships require teaching, laboratory instruction or research. As assistantships are awarded by each department, applications should be directed to the head of the department in which the applicant studies.\n\nHow You're Paid\n\nStudents employed on Work-Study and Intern 2 Learn are paid via biweekly paychecks. Graduate assistants are paid monthly.\n\nLoans\n\nFederal Direct Loan Program\n\nFederal Direct Loans are student loans that must be repaid and are available to both undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nAnnual Undergraduate loan limits may not exceed $5,500 (of which no more than $3,500 may be subsidized) for freshmen; $6,500 (of which no more than $4,500 may be subsidized) for sophomores; and $7,500 (of which no more than $5,500 may be subsidized) for juniors and seniors. Annual Graduate student loan limits are limited to $20,500 in unsubsidized loans. In addition, students must be enrolled in at least 6 semester hours to qualify.\n\nA subsidized loan is awarded on the basis of financial need. If eligible for a subsidized loan, the government will pay (subsidize) the interest on the loan while the student is in school and for the first six months after leaving school (grace period). However, for subsidized loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2012, and before July 1, 2014, the student is responsible for the interest that accrues while the loan is in the grace period.\n\nFirst time student loan borrowers must complete the Entrance Loan Counseling and the Electronic Promissory Note before TSU can release the first disbursement of their Federal Direct Student loan.\n\nFor an unsubsidized loan, the student is responsible for the interest from the time the unsubsidized loan is disbursed until it is paid in full.\n\nStudents begin repaying Federal Direct Student loans six months after they drop below half-time enrollment or graduate from college.\n\nParent Loan for Undergraduate Students (Parent PLUS)\n\nParent Loans are made by the Department of Education to eligible parents to assist in meeting education costs. Parents must be US Citizens or eligible non-citizens and receive credit approval. Parents, on behalf of their dependents, may borrow the annual loan limit of the cost of education, less other financial aid. Fees charged to the PLUS borrower are deducted form the loan proceeds when the money is sent to the student’s school. Parents may apply at www.studentaid.gov.\n\nGraduate PLUS Loan\n\nThe Direct Graduate PLUS Loan (Grad PLUS) is available to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Graduate students may borrow up to the full cost of attendance less other financial aid you are receiving. The Direct Graduate PLUS Loan is credit-based and requires credit approval. Direct Graduate PLUS loans are not based on need, however require filing of FAFSA. Graduate students may apply at www.studentaid.gov.\n\nPrivate Loans\n\nPrivate Loans are provided by lending institutions and are not in any way related to the loan programs offered by the Federal Department of Education. Private loans offer a funding alternative for students and parents. While using a private lender is an option, it is in the students' best interest to apply for Federal, State, and Institutional Aid before considering this option. The benefits of applying for Federal Direct Student Loans over a Private/Alternative loan include lower interest rates and greater repayment options.\n\nShort-Term Loans\n\nShort-Term loan funds at Tarleton State University were established to provide assistance to students who are experiencing temporary financial difficulty in connection with educationally related expenses. These loans must be repaid with interest and/or service charge within the prescribed repayment period. It is not the intent of this program to supplement or to replace long-term aid or assistance offered by the Student Financial Aid Office. Short Term loans are available while school is in session and applicants must meet the requirements to be considered. Loan applications are online through myGateway.\n\nBook Loans\n\nBook loan funds at Tarleton State University were established to provide assistance to students who are experiencing temporary financial difficulty in purchasing their books. These loans must be repaid with interest and/or service charge within the prescribed repayment period. For more information on the Book Loans, please contact the Office of Student Financial Services.\n\nLate Payments on Loans\n\nWhen a student does not make payment on any outstanding loan by the due date, his/her records will be blocked immediately.\n\nFAFSA Verification\n\nIf you have submitted your FAFSA and received a notification that you were selected for verification, you are not alone! About 1/3 of all FAFSA applications are selected for this process. Tarleton's Office of Financial Aid is here to guide you! If you have been selected for verification, you must complete verification before you can receive any aid. Your financial aid eligibility could change because of corrections made during verification. If your eligibility changes, your financial aid awards will be adjusted, and you will receive a revised award letter or notification via email. More information is located on the Tarleton Financial Aid website.\n\nWhat if I Don't Finish my Verification?\n\nYour financial aid will not apply to your billing account until verification is complete, so please respond immediately to any requests from our department. Should you fail to submit all required documentation, financial aid will not be awarded and/or disbursed.\n\nAcademic Eligibility Requirements for Financial Aid\n\nSatisfactory Academic Progress Policy\n\nFederal and state regulations require all students to make satisfactory academic progress (SAP) toward completion of degree, certificate or licensure requirements to receive student financial aid. All terms of attempted enrollment, including transfer hours, are considered in determining satisfactory academic progress regardless of whether aid was awarded for the term. Failure to meet satisfactory progress standards results in ineligibility for all types of federal, state, and university aid administered by the Student Financial Aid Office at Tarleton State University (TSU).\n\nEvaluation Period\n\nMonitoring satisfactory academic progress begins with the first credit attempted and is done at the end of fall and spring semesters.\n\nQualitative Standard: Grade Point Average (GPA)\n\nAttempted credits include all courses on student records after the 12th class day, including withdrawals, incompletes, repeats, noncredit and remedial courses. TSU’s satisfactory progress policy requires that students achieve the following cumulative grade point averages:\n\nUndergraduate Students: 2.0 Graduate Students: 3.0\n\nQuantitative Standard (Pace): Completion Percentage (Deficit Hours)\n\nFinancial aid standards require students to satisfactorily complete a minimum of 67% of their total cumulative attempted credits. This percentage includes all institutional and transfer credit hours, regardless of whether or not financial aid was received. Hours successfully completed include those with grades of A, B, C, D, P and S. Grades of F, I, K, Q, W, WF, U, NG and grad exclusions are not considered to be adequate grades for completion. The calculation used to determine the completion rate:\n\nTotal Hours Successfully Completed\n\nTotal Hours Attempted = Completion Rate\n\nQuantitative Standard: Maximum Hours Attempted (Excessive Hours)\n\nStudents are expected to complete their degree pursuits within a maximum timeframe, including transfer hours earned as well as institutional attempted credits. Credits attempted to complete a degree and receive financial aid cannot exceed 150% of the credits required to complete the degree program. Credit hours are cumulative; thus, students obtaining more than the maximum hours (e.g., change in major) may reach this maximum timeframe before completing their course of study and may need to appeal the timeframe eligibility. Students may not receive financial assistance beyond the following:\n\nUndergraduate Students: 180 Hours\n\nGraduate Students: 54 Hours\n\nDoctoral: 108 Hours\n\nFailure to Meet Standards\n\nIf at the end of each semester, a student fails to meet any of the above Satisfactory Academic Standard(s), he/she will be placed on financial aid suspension for each standard not being met.\n\nAppeals\n\nFinancial aid suspension status may be appealed to Student Financial Aid. Appeals are made on the basis of extraordinary or mitigating circumstances (including but not limited to major illness, death in the family, serious accident, etc.) or the successful completion of additional coursework. The appeal must state why the student failed to make satisfactory academic progress and what has changed in the student’s situation that would allow the student to demonstrate satisfactory academic progress by the end of the following semester. Each case is reviewed individually. The Student Financial Aid Office informs the student in writing within seven business days of its decision, provided adequate documentation was submitted by the student.\n\nIf the appeal is approved, financial aid eligibility will be reinstated for a probationary semester. Written notification (financial aid contract) will include the standards the student is expected to meet in order to retain financial aid eligibility at the end of the semester.\n\nIf at the end of a probationary semester, the student meets TSU’s probationary term requirements but has not met TSU’s cumulative standards, TSU will permit the student to retain financial aid eligibility under a “continued probation” status. Probation status continues to be monitored each semester until the student meets TSU’s cumulative standards for completion percentage and grade point average (GPA), at which time the student will be returned to “good standing”.\n\nIf a student on “continued probation” status fails to meet TSU’s cumulative standard(s) or the standards required for the probationary semester, TSU will suspend the student from financial aid eligibility.\n\nIf an appeal is denied, written notification will state the reason(s) for the denial and the process of appealing the denial.\n\nA student not satisfied with an denied decision may submit a subsequent appeal to the university’s appeal committee.\n\nPrograms that require longer than the maximum hours attempted limits must have individual approval from the Student Financial Aid Office through the appeal process. Students must submit for review an academic plan approved and signed by their advisor indicating the semester(s) remaining for degree completion, a course plan for each remaining semester, and projected graduation date. Appeals for hours in excess of 150% solely to improve GPA are not approved, unless the course is part of an approved academic plan. Submission of an appeal does not indicate automatic approval of the academic plan. Each appeal is reviewed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nNotification\n\nStudents who fail to meet the minimum standards will be notified by email (go.tarleton email) when they are placed on probation or suspension. It is possible for students to be placed on financial aid suspension for failure to meet more than one type of Satisfactory Academic Progress Standard. Students who have not received financial aid in the past are immediately subject to standards when they apply for financial aid.\n\nRe-Establishing Eligibility After Financial Aid Suspension\n\nStudents whose financial aid eligibility has been suspended may regain eligibility only through TSU’s appeal process or when they meet the institution’s satisfactory academic progress quantitative and qualitative standards. If Incomplete (I) hours are a factor in failure to maintain satisfactory progress, subsequent successful completion of these hours may be used to re-establish eligibility for aid. Paying for classes out of pocket or sitting out a period of time in and of itself is not sufficient to re-establish a student’s financial aid eligibility.\n\nRepeated Courses\n\nStudents who repeat a course may receive financial assistance more than once for enrollment in the same course. When a course is repeated, each enrollment is included in calculating the percentage of successfully completed hours and the total number of attempted hours is used to determine length of eligibility. For example, a student enrolls in a three hour course, fails it and the following semester re-enrolls in the same course and earns a C. That student would have enrolled in in six hours, but successfully completed only three hours. Repeating a course more than once results in removal of only one previous grade from the GPA calculation.\n\nFederal regulations also stipulate the way enrollment status is determined for students who are repeating coursework in which they previously received a letter grade of D- or higher. An institution may pay a student one time for retaking previously-passed coursework. To determine a student’s enrollment status (full-time vs. part-time), the school may not include more than one repetition of a previously passed course.\n\nExample: Two years ago, Sam enrolled in a 3-hour Applied Mathematics course and received a grade of D-. Sam took the same course again last year and received a grade of C-. His major requires that he pass the class with a C or better, so Sam decides to take the course again this semester. Sam is enrolled in 9 hours of other coursework plus the Applied Math class, for a total of 12 hours. The 3 hours of that class are not included in determining Sam’s enrollment status for the current semester because it is the second time he is repeating a class in which he previously received a “passing” grade. Sam would be paid financial aid as a part-time student because he is enrolled in 12 hours minus the 3 hours of the course he’s repeating for the second time, which do not count. For financial aid purposes, Sam is enrolled in 9 eligible hours.\n\nWithdrawing or Dropping Classes\n\nIf you withdraw from all classes, either officially or unofficially, on or before completing the term and you have received Title IV federal funds in the form of a Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG), Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant, Iraq Afghanistan Service Grant, Federal Direct loans, or a Federal PLUS loan, the federal government requires that we review your eligibility for those funds. We are required to apply a federally mandated formula to determine how much of the federal funding was “earned” up to the time of withdrawal. This review and recalculation is called a “Return of Title IV Aid”.\n\nThe Title IV funds that were disbursed in excess of the earned amount must be returned to the federal government by the university and/or you.\n\nThe amount to be returned to the federal government will be calculated from the date you officially withdrew from classes or, in the case of an unofficial withdrawal (see section above), the last date you were involved in an academically related activity.\n\nFinancial Aid Disbursement\n\nFinancial aid is applied (disbursed) to student bills approximately 10 days before the first day of classes each term.\n\nScholarships\n\nThe Tarleton State University Office of Scholarships is committed to providing assistance to students in pursuit of their education. Scholarships are awarded for academic ability and achievement, demonstrated leadership, ability to perform (music, band, etc.), extracurricular activities, financial need, and other criteria as defined by specific scholarship programs. Scholarship consideration for current Tarleton students has full-time status as a criterion unless otherwise defined by specific scholarship programs. More than 600 endowed, local, and departmental scholarships are available to students attending Tarleton State University. Some scholarships are awarded in specific academic areas, such as science, humanities, agriculture, and business.\n\nScholarship information and application forms may be obtained from the Office of Scholarships, Box T-0760, Stephenville, TX 76402 or at www.tarleton.edu/scholarships/. The Office can also be contacted by telephoning (254) 968-9922.\n\nAny student receiving institutional scholarships valued at $10,000 or more is generally not eligible for other institutional scholarships.\n\nThe Presidential Honors Program offers exceptional opportunities for outstanding students. Presidential Honors Scholars are given priority in such areas as pre-registration and housing assignments. They also enroll in two interdisciplinary Honors Seminars, participate in the Honors Degree Program, have the opportunity to travel to a professional meeting in their major field of study, and receive annual scholarships of $7,000 or $8,000. For more information, contact Dr. Eileen Faulkenberry, Dean of the Honors College, Box T-0545, Stephenville, TX 76402; (254) 968-1926.\n\nVeteran Services\n\nVeterans’ Assistance\n\nThe Military Veterans Services Center serves students eligible for educational benefits from the Veteran’s Administration. Records are maintained and reports made to the Veteran’s Administration on behalf of veterans, dependents, and active-duty service members enrolled at the University. The institution does not prohibit attendance or impose penalties while waiting on VA Payments, per 38 U.S.C. § 3679(e)(1)A&B.\n\nHazlewood Act\n\nVeterans should contact the Military Veterans Services Center to obtain forms to apply for Hazlewood Exemptions. Complete information must be submitted to the Military Veterans Services Center on or before the census date of each term.\n\nTexas Workforce Commission\n\nVocational Rehabilitation\n\nThe Texas Rehabilitation Commission offers assistance for tuition and required fees to students who are physically or otherwise challenged, provided the vocational objective selected by the unusually challenged person has been approved by an appropriate representative of the Commission. Through this state agency, other rehabilitation services are available to assist these students in becoming employable. Application for this type of assistance should be made to the nearest Rehabilitation Office. Address inquiries to: Commissioner, Texas Rehabilitation Commission, Jefferson Bldg., 1600 W. 38th Street, Austin, Texas 78731.\n\nTuition and Student Fee Exemptions\n\nA student may qualify for legislative exemption from the payment of tuition and certain fees and charges according to the following conditions. Contact the Student Financial Aid Office for procedures for determining eligibility prior to the registration process.\n\nClaims for exemption from any charges and/or fees must be supported by evidence sufficient to enable the Student Financial Aid Office to verify the student’s exempt status and determine the duration of the exemption and the fees and charges to which it is applicable. Supporting document(s) must be in the Student Financial Aid Office before a student registers.\n\nListed below are exemption programs available to Texas residents. You may visit College for all Texans (https://www.collegeforalltexans.com) to view specific Exemption information.\n\nPlease note: When visiting College for all Texans you may see additional exemptions that may not be available at this time at Tarleton State University.
