        "text": "Moore School Experts: Amazon’s Succession Planning Ensures New CEO is Prepared\n\nTwo management professors have done intensive research on CEO succession planning and both see the online retailer's announcement as a meticulously planned choice that was likely years in the making.\n\nFour Moore School Faculty Among Top 1% of Worldwide Researchers\n\nOut of 475 institutions identified in a database, only 65 institutions have four or more top scientists on the faculty, and the Moore School's elite researchers discuss why their studies matter from a big-picture perspective.\n\nCompanies’ COVID-19 Responses Sway Public Perceptions\n\nCompensation actions — such as added “hero” pay or enhanced paid leave — were associated with a persistent rise in positive stakeholder sentiment.\n\nInsights into How New Employees are Integrated into Workplace Cultures\n\nincumbent team members sometimes have agendas in terms of getting newcomers to identify with their needs that are not necessarily in the best interest of the overall team.\n\nOur Occupations Form Our Identities: Career Success and Personality Traits\n\nA process model examined how certain personality types are drawn to jobs and who is likely to be successful based on their similarity to dominant personalities, which emphasizes the importance in understanding your personality early in your career.\n\nFulbright Award will Help Research Human Capital Resources in Ireland\n\nAs compensation systems can lead to better employee attraction and retention, a research team will travel to gain access to decision-making activities of senior executives and details regarding employee pay and performance.\n\nResearching Identity Threat While Accounting for Multiple Identities\n\nAs individuals are inherently multidimensional, researchers must start accounting for the complexity of multiple identities. A dissertation examines identity threat involving current and future identities, as well as identity threat involving personal and professional identities.\n\nRediscovering the \"Human\" in Strategic Human Capital\n\nDo firms that provide greater fulfillment of meaning and purpose attract and retain human capital at a lower economic cost, and can this opportunity become a source of competitive advantage?\n\nCEO Succession Tips to Ensure Longevity\n\nInterviews with nearly two dozen board of directors members at some of the U.S.'s largest companies centered around describing the most successful and least successful CEO successions they had seen, and the data provided many recurring themes.\n\nTwo Moore School Faculty Named as Among Top 1% of Researchers\n\nInternational business professor Tatiana Kostova and management and human resources professor Robert Ployhart were recognized for their volume and quality of influential studies in the economics and business category."
