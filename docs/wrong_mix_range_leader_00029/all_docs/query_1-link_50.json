        "text": "By John Turner\n\nWhat is your initial reaction when you hear the word Iraq? For most Americans, it probably carries a host of negative connotations. For me, as an Iraq War veteran, it’s a reminder of the 16 months I spent there trying to implement a policy the leaders of my country had established.\n\nAs children, we learn about other countries from maps, news stories, overheard conversations. I remember 1986. Libyan terrorists bombed a German discotheque, killing two American soldiers. President Reagan came on the television and ordered air strikes against Libya. The next morning in school, we discussed the attacks in almost every class. I remember the questions as if I was still in sixth grade. Why had it happened? Did it mean war? The world seemed large, and we learned where Libya was.\n\nThe next year, I learned of a nation called Iraq for the first time. Iraq was at war with Iran. My teacher, Mr. Robinson, talked about the Strait of Hormuz. He felt war in that region was imminent. Then in 1991 Iraq invaded Kuwait. Saddam Hussein became a household name, and war threatened again.\n\nI took a class called current events, and we discussed Desert Shield and then Desert Storm. America and her allies showed force the world had never seen, and Saddam moved his depleted army back across the border. Our final assignment was a paper on what would be next.\n\nIn October 2002, The U.S. Senate voted 77-23 to authorize President Bush to invade Iraq. I watched this vote with great self-interest because by then I was a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army. It wasn’t just a high school paper. It was real. I went back to school: Field Artillery Officers Basic Course. Iraq was about to become the defining moment in my life.\n\nAt OBC, General Reimer spoke to our class about duty and honor. “You have one duty,” he said, “to win our nation’s wars. If you fail, so does the nation.”\n\nIn August 2005, I flew to Mosul, Iraq — to a war Mr. Robinson had predicted in 1987. I would be responsible for the lives of 18-year-olds and had a duty to win this war for my nation. I resolved that failure would not happen on my watch.\n\nIt didn’t. When I took off my uniform in 2007, we had succeeded in defeating the enemy and standing up a new, elected Iraqi government. We captured Saddam Hussein and turned him over to the Iraqi judicial system, which found him guilty of genocide and executed him.\n\nI had personally talked to a number of Iraqis, asked them to stand up to evil and help build the new nation. I told them they could trust the United States to stand behind them. I thought I was telling the truth, that the United States would keep enough troops in Iraq long enough to guarantee the country’s security and continue training them on how to run a democracy. After all, we’d hung around in places like Germany and Korea for decades.\n\nIt didn’t happen that way. Iraq became a four-letter word. Obama pulled out, the fledgling government weakened, and the vacuum was filled by the bad guys. Today ISIS terrorists have captured Mosul, and, I am virtually certain, murdered the men I unwittingly lied to when I convinced them to stand on our side.\n\nTwenty-two times a day in America, a veteran commits suicide. When the country you served turns its back on you, and squanders not just the territory you won, but the hearts and minds, too — is it any wonder?\n\n—Captain John Turner was awarded a Bronze Star for his service in Iraq. He is currently the Executive Director of the Veterans Leadership Council of North Carolina – CARES, which works to rehabilitate and reintegrate homeless and at-risk veterans."
