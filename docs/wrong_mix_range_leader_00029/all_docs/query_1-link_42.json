Turner earned an MFA from the University of Oregon before serving for seven years in the US Army. He was an infantry team leader in Iraq with the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division. Prior to that, he was deployed to Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1999-2000 with the 10th Mountain Division.\n\nHe directs the MFA program at Sierra Nevada College and serves as a contributing editor at The Normal School.
