        "text": "Dr. M Jackson is a geographer, glaciologist, TED Fellow, and National Geographic Society Explorer. M earned a doctorate from the University of Oregon where she examined how climate change transformed people and glacier communities in Iceland. M is the recipient of many grants and awards, including three U.S. Fulbright grants and a U.S. Fulbright Ambassadorship. M currently serves as an Arctic Expert for the National Geographic Society, holds a Masters of Science degree from the University of Montana, and served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Zambia. She’s worked for over a decade in the Arctic chronicling climate change and communities, guiding backcountry trips and exploring glacial systems. Her 2015 memoir While Glaciers Slept: Being Human in a Time of Climate Change weaves together the parallel stories of what happens when the climates of a family and a planet change. Her 2019 book, The Secret Lives of Glaciers, explores the profound impacts of glacier change on the human and physical geography of Iceland. She is currently at work on her first novel. M travels extensively giving public talks and lectures on climate change and women in science.\n\nJames Dao has been the Op-Ed editor of The New York Times since February 2016. The department today includes nearly two dozen editors operating out of Hong Kong, London, Istanbul, San Francisco, and New York, producing daily op-eds, the Sunday Review, the international Op-Ed section, and online opinion features such as The Stone and Fixes. In 2017, the Sunday Review ran a 20-part series about Syrian refugees, \"Welcome to the New World,\" that won a Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning, the first time The New York Times has won in that category.\n\nDuring his 27 years with The New York Times, Mr. Dao has been the Albany bureau chief, a national and Washington correspondent, the military and veterans affairs reporter, and deputy national editor. While he was deputy metropolitan editor in 2008, the section published a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation that led to the resignation of Gov. Eliot Spitzer. He has reported from a dozen countries and across the U.S., covering the impeachment of President Clinton, the 2000 presidential campaign, the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and Hurricane Katrina. In 2010 and 2011, he was the reporter on an eight-part multi-media series about the yearlong deployment of an Army battalion to Afghanistan, titled A Year at War, which received an Emmy and an Alfred I. DuPont-Columbia University award.\n\nPrior to working at The New York Times, he worked as a reporter for The Record of Hackensack, NJ, and the Daily News in New York, and was a writer and researcher for the New York Chinatown History Project. He is a graduate of Yale College.\n\nPresident Trump was elected promising to put \"America first.\" In his first year in office, how much change has there been in U.S. foreign policy? And is another war more likely—perhaps with North Korea and/or Iran? These questions and related issues were the focus of the 2018 Kim T. Adamson Lecture given by Kael Weston.\n\nA Utah native and former U.S. State Department official, Weston spent 7 years in Iraq and Afghanistan (2003–2010) working closely with the U.S. military and Iraqi and Afghan leaders. He is the author of The Mirror Test: America at War in Iraq and Afghanistan and was awarded the Secretary of State's Medal for Heroism for his work with U.S. Marines in Fallujah. Weston is currently Westminster University's Writer-in-Residence in the Honors College.\n\nGeorgetown University Professor of Philosophy Nancy Sherman laid out the central arguments of her important book, The Untold War: Inside the Hearts, Minds, and Souls of our Soldiers, a study dedicated to \"the men and women who have served in the military and have carried the weight of war and its moral uncertainties.\"\n\nA specialist in ancient ethics and the history of moral philosophy, Sherman has authored 4 books and edited a fifth on Aristotle's ethics. She has taught at Yale, Johns Hopkins, and the University of Maryland, and served as the first Distinguished Chair in Ethics at the U.S. Naval Academy, designing the brigade-wide required military ethics course and laying the groundwork for the new Stockdale Ethics Center."
