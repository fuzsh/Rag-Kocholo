It was during his time at Cornell that he met the love of his life, Rachel. Alex was born into a loving family in Washington, DC and graduated Valedictorian of his high school class. We remember Alex as a loving and brilliant individual with limitless potential. Alex was a man of strong convictions, integrity, and family values. We miss his easy laugh, and his steadfast commitment to family and friends will always be treasured. Alex is survived by his wife, Rachel, and 21-month old son, Jackson, as well as his mother and father, Cheryl and Richard, and two brothers, Rich and Justin. The outpouring of support the family has seen since his passing is a testament to how many lives he touched.
