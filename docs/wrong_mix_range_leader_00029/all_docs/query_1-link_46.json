The work groups were comprised of subject matter experts, POST Master Instructors, POST Advanced Instructors and individuals with previous QAP experience. The purpose of the workshops was to ensure enough qualified evaluators are available as a result of the expansion of the QAP contract budget. The focus for this budget cycle will be the assessment of California Code of Regulations Section 1070 training, and training associated with the use of force, officer involved shootings, mental health and de-escalation. These elements will be assessed in all POST certified training courses, ranging from basic academies through executive law enforcement courses.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this workshop, please contact Senior Law Enforcement Consultant Mike Radford at (916) 227-3925 or Special Consultant Tamara Baarts, Training Program Services Bureau, at (916) 227-7357.\n\nVentura Police Academy Pilots POST De-Escalation Course\n\nOn June 24-25, 2019, Training Program Services (TPS) attended the pilot of the new basic training POST de-escalation course at the Ventura Police Academy.

The de-escalation curriculum was inserted into Learning Domain 20 “Use of Force.” Topics in the new course include: defining de-escalation, recognizing common misconceptions, core concepts of de-escalation, utilizing a critical decision making model, and strategic communication.\n\nAfter the presentation, recruits were provided with an opportunity to offer feedback on the course.
