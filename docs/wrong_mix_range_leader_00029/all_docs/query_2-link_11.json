The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2 p.m., in room 2247, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Christopher Shays (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Present: Representatives Shays, Turner, Platts, Kucinich, and Maloney. Staff present: Lawrence Halloran, staff director and counsel; R. Nicholas Palarino, senior policy advisor; Robert Briggs, clerk; Richard Lundberg, detailee; Andrew Su, minority professional staff member; and Christopher Davis, minority investigator. Mr. Shays. A quorum being present, the Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats and International Relations hearing entitled, ``Iraq: Winning Hearts and Minds'' is called to order. Almost 1 year after the capture of Saddam Hussein, the hard lessons of liberation are coming into sharper relief. For many Iraqis, euphoria over the fall of the tyrant has decayed into disappointment over the pace of reconstruction. Eagerness to embrace long suffering suppressed freedoms has become impatience over half-measures and interim organizations that look and act more Western than Iraqi. Welcomed liberators are now viewed in some quarters as resented occupiers. Why? In the course of five visits to post-Saddam Iraq, my staff and I asked the same questions. Four of those visits were sponsored by nongovernment organizations [NGO's], allowing us to travel outside the military umbrella that can sometimes shield Members of Congress from useful information not included in the official briefing slides. Across Iraq, we saw families and communities celebrating weddings, building schools, and trying to weave the fabric of civil society from disparate, often conflicting, ethnic, religious, and political threats. We also saw a rigid, centralized Coalition Provisional Authority [CPA] at times succumbing to hubris and condescension in dealing with the sovereign people it was created to serve. Many Iraqis noticed. In that hostile terrain, our accomplishments whither quickly while our errors are grotesquely magnified. Conveying American good intentions through the cacophony of competing tribal, religious, and factional voices requires patience and a cultural sensitivity that were apparently not part of the original war plan. So today we ask: What have we learned about how a newly sovereign Iraq will perceive U.S. words and actions? How do we reach the Iraqi people? Our previous oversight of post-war humanitarian assistance and public diplomacy in Iraq pointed to the need for clarity, persistence, and humility in that unforgiving, volatile part of the world. The perceived dissonance between American rhetoric and actions breeds mistrust at home and in Iraq about why we are there and how long we will stay. The same lack of strategic clarity causes others to doubt our will to see the mission through. And when we forget why we are there, when we forget it is their revolution not ours, we allow ourselves to be portrayed as arrogant agents of empire rather than as trustees of noble ideals. Today we welcome three panels of most distinguished witnesses who bring first-hand experience and invaluable expertise to our continuing oversight of U.S. efforts to reach the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people. We asked for their insights and analyses of U.S. efforts to secure, stabilize, rebuild, and foster civil discourse and democracy in post- Saddam Iraq. We very much appreciate the participation of Ms. Rend Al- Rahim, the Iraqi Representative to the United States. Thank you for being here. She brings a unique perspective to these important issues. We look forward to her testimony and that of all of our witnesses. I will just say before recognizing the ranking member, it is our custom to swear in all witnesses. But we do make rare exceptions. In one instance I chickened out, for example, and could not bring myself to ask Senator Byrd to take the oath. But in other instances and in deference to protocol, we also do not administer the oath to international diplomats and international civil servants who agree to provide information to this subcommittee. So we will not be swearing in our first witness. But I cannot tell you how grateful we are that you are here. At this time, the Chair would recognize Mr. Kucinich, the ranking member of this subcommittee. Thank you, Mr. Kucinich. [The prepared statement of Hon. Christopher Shays follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.001 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.002 Mr. Kucinich. Thank you very much, Chairman Shays, for holding this hearing. We are familiar with the fact that the Vice President predicted back in March 2003 that U.S. forces would be greeted by Iraqi citizens as their liberators. Instead, recent polls of the Iraqi people show that 80 percent have negative views of the United States, and that a majority of Iraqi people want U.S. military forces to leave immediately. That this data was gathered prior to the prison abuse scandal and the escalation of violence against Coalition forces in recent weeks is instructive. I believe our military presence in Iraq was, is, and will continue to be counterproductive, and it endangers the security of Americans both here and abroad by uniting those and strengthening those who oppose us. Since the end of major combat operations was declared on May 1, 2003, the lives of nearly 700 additional U.S. soldiers have been lost in Iraq, many of them victims of homemade bombs, which are strategically placed by the Iraqi roadside to inflict harm on our troops. And at this moment, I believe we have over 830 who have lost their lives in this conflict, thousands have been injured, and over 10,000 innocent Iraqis have lost their lives. It is clear that the United States has underestimated the level of resistance of the Iraqis. The U.S. Government has erred in the fixed idea that only Baathists, Al Qaeda, and criminal groups oppose the U.S. occupation. Mr. Chairman, without objection, I would like to insert in the record an article from the June 6, 2004 edition of the Washington Post. It is entitled, ``The Military: Losing Hearts and Minds?'' Mr. Shays. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Kucinich. It is actually written by an Army Reserve Captain Oscar Estrada, who is serving as a civil affairs team leader in Iraq. Captain Estrada writes that the good efforts of American troops are having the opposite effects. He finds that paying townspeople a dollar to collect a bag of trash is demeaning to Iraqis, that providing medical care leads to disappointment and resentment when there is no medicine to heal the sick, and that buildings and cars are needlessly damaged as soldiers in Humvees speed through Iraqi cities shooting in all directions. I want to say that while I take strong exception to our presence in Iraq, the men and women who serve this country and who love this country need to be appreciated. But at the same time, it is essential that we point out any of the shortcomings that I believe is the direct result of failed policies. The bombing of the wedding in Western Iraq near the Syrian border killed over 40 people, including women and children. The U.S.' subsequent denial of the incident only inflamed tensions. The indiscriminate use of force that the United States used in Fallujah to target the insurgents killed over 800 innocent civilians, creating a further uproar from people. This is the real face of the U.S. occupation seen everyday by the Iraqi people. When combined with the egregious abuses our military leaders apparently condoned at the prison, it is no wonder that Iraqi frustration and resistance is mounting. The question for us now is what, if anything, we can do to earn the trust of Iraqis and regain moral standing in the world. Take, for instance, the question of how the United States should handle the prison torture scandal. What level of accountability of high ranking officials is required to demonstrate U.S. contrition? And I am not only talking about military officials here, Mr. Chairman. Is it enough, as one of our colleagues has said, that a few low ranking ``bad apples'' are dishonorably discharged? Or will that be seen in Iraq as scapegoating the responsibility of higher up officials who authored the policy that resulted in the prison scandal? Does that responsibility go to the White House, where the White House counsel penned a memo providing a legal rationale for freeing the President from the international obligation of honoring the rights of prisoners? I think that this hearing is important because it gives this Congress an opportunity to discuss some of the things that the chairman raised in his opening statement. We need to see where this whole effort is going, and we need to determine at some point, Mr. Chairman, whether it is the purview of this committee or not, at what time we are going to get out of Iraq and create international cooperation which will enable the U.S. troops to be brought home. [The prepared statement of Hon. Dennis J. Kucinich follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.003 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.004 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.005 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.006 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.007 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.008 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.009 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.010 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.011 Mr. Shays. I thank the gentleman. At this time I recognize the vice chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Turner. Welcome. Mr. Turner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Of course, we are all so appreciative of our chairman's leadership in the issue of this committee and national security and the issue of the global war on terror. Specifically in the area of Iraq, though, our chairman has travelled to Iraq many times and in ways not like most Members of Congress have gone; in ways where he has direct contact with the Iraqi people and places himself in a great deal of risk compared to many of the just fact-finding missions that even I attended. We know that from our chairman's efforts to make certain that he is in Iraq and on the ground and having contact with the Iraqi people in ways that most of us do not have the opportunity or have not been willing to take the risk, he brings with him a great deal of information and insight that we very much appreciate to this topic and to the committee. It is interesting, in listening to the issues of mistakes the United States has made or may have made, it is easy to criticize a policy by listing a number of mistakes. It is easy to criticize a policy by listing mistakes without taking the responsibility for what it would mean if there is inaction. Whenever I hear the United States criticized for what we have done and the mistakes that have been made, I always think back to when Tony Blair came before Congress to receive the Congressional Medal and he talked about the issue of the war on terror. He said that ``History would condemn us if we failed to take action on the war on terror. Along the way we may make mistakes, but they will forgive us for these mistakes as we rise to the occasion to make certain that this threat that we have for the civilized world is addressed.'' One of the things that I think no one questions is that the U.S.' role and goal in Iraq is for a transition to democracy. It is important for us to have hearings like this and that the chairman's leadership in knowing how we should address this issue, in that we need to know: How is the issue of democracy being perceived in Iraq? How are we being perceived? How is the overall goal viewed? What support do we have of the Iraqi people? And how do we communicate. What are the ways that we are seeing our actions communicating a message that we do not want to have conveyed that might undermine our efforts? Our efforts in this hearing should not be to just list a litany of mistakes, but to embrace the goal and look at how we can, through greater information, make certain that we achieve it, both for us and the Iraqi people. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shays. I thank the gentleman very much. I would just want to say, since I have some real concerns about how we have done the rebuilding of Iraq, and the extent that we have been culturally sensitive, and so on, I strongly support our reasons for being there and am very grateful that we have brave men and women who have taken on this task. We just want to make sure that it ends in success. Representative Al-Rahim, thank you so much for being here. You, by your testimony, may have tremendous impact on the success of this mission and the ultimate transformation of power that happens in a few days. This is not an American revolution, it is an Iraqi revolution, and on June 30th that will be very clear. I am certain that Iraq will do certain things that we may not like. But guess what? It is your country. So with that, welcome. You have a statement that I would like you to feel you can give in its entirety. I would like you not to feel rushed, so that we have the benefit of what you would like to say. So I am going to encourage you to give your statement and not say that it will all be in the record and just summarize. My only concern is that as you look at me, I think we should move that water in front of you, get that microphone in front of you. Let's help out there, somebody. Thank you, Bob. Welcome. STATEMENT OF REND AL-RAHIM, IRAQI REPRESENTATIVE TO THE UNITED STATES Ms. Al-Rahim. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for inviting me to testify on this important subject. Having testified before, I have learned to make a summary of my statement. In any case, my full statement is rather long; it is eight pages of single space, and it would be really rather long to read it all. I have summarized it, but I would welcome any questions to clarify so that I can get into some issues in greater detail. So lets work on the summary. Thank you for inviting me to testify on this important issue, Mr. Chairman, Congressman. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the United States and the Coalition forces for bringing to Iraqis freedom from dictatorship and tyranny. Ending the murderous regime of Saddam Hussein was, indeed, a moral victory against evil and we should celebrate that victory. We should never have any doubts about the rightness of the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime, even by force. I also wish to express our deep appreciation for the sacrifices made by Americans, Coalition members, and hundreds of Iraqis over the past 14 months. We should honor their sacrifices and the memory of those who have fallen. Mr. Chairman, it is important to recognize that the picture is not all gloomy and dark in Iraq. And I want to make that statement first and foremost. Iraqis did, indeed, welcome the Coalition forces as liberators. There have been many successes, although many challenges also remain. To measure the magnitude of the achievements and the challenges, it is essential to bear in mind that the old regime destroyed Iraqi institutions, society, and the Iraqi economy for 35 long years. We have to rebuild the country from the ashes left to us by Saddam Hussein's regime. Let me list some of the achievements. First, the economy has made significant progress and there is thriving trade and entrepreneurship. Somebody called Baghdad a Boom Town a while ago. And from my own personal experience, I would concur with that. Salaries and the standard of living of Iraqis have risen dramatically. A free press is flourishing. Civil society institutions are being formed, and professional associations are, for the first time, free from the control of government. Political parties are taking their first steps and political debate in Iraq is open and lively. Ministries have resumed their services and are active in the reconstruction process of their own ministries. The Iraqi Governing Council in March adopted a Transitional Administrative Law, a sort of proto-interim constitution, with a Bill of Rights that is the most progressive in the Middle East. And I would want to add here that it is not just the outcome of this law that is significant, but the process that it entailed, which was a process of debate, of deliberation, of negotiation of true political horse trading, and of compromises. I was witness to some of those meetings resulted in the TAL, as we call it, and it was truly impressive the way that Iraqi politicians were able to debate. Since early June, there have been two noteworthy successes. First of all, a new, well-qualified Iraqi government has been formed, with the help of the United Nations, which will assume full sovereignty and authority on June 30th. And second, a Iraqi delegation went to New York for the very first time and took part actively in shaping a U.N. resolution on Iraq, and this resolution has been passed unanimously by the U.N. Security Council. These are all significant achievements in the space of 14 months. At the same time we have faced, and continue to face, problems. Some of these problems arise from miscalculations in U.S. policy and failures in implementation. And I strongly feel that as representative of a country that looks forward to a long and lasting friendship with the United States, it is important for all of us to take stock and measure the successes as well as the failures. We ought to be able to talk to each other about these things in order to move forward. I would like to draw attention here to some reports written by Iraqis prior to March 2003; that is, prior to military action in Iraq. The first one is a report that was written by a group of Iraqis in November 2002, under the auspices of the State Department's project called Future of Iraq Project. The report is entitled, ``Transition to Democracy,'' in which Iraqis wrote about how they conceived that transition and their recommendations for policies during the transition period. I would also like to refer to my own testimony in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on August 2002. And finally, I would like to refer to a report I wrote when I was still executive director of the Iraq Foundation. I wrote it in September 2003, after 5 months in Baghdad, and the report is entitled, ``Iraq Democracy Report No. 1,'' with the hope that I would do a No. 2 and 3. But this job intervened. One of the important issues that we noticed in Iraq is that there appeared to be multiple conflicting policies within the CPA, causing confusion and frequent reversals. This confusion within the CPA became infectious and affected the confidence of the Iraqi population. It was visible through the U-turns, the reversals, and Iraqis felt destabilized. The first and, so to speak, the ``Mother'' of all policy errors is the declared policy of occupation. Many Iraqis had urged that the Coalition should be a liberator and a partner of Iraqis, not an occupying power. It is humiliating to Iraqis. It goes against their sense of dignity and patriotism. There are no nice words by which to talk about occupation. Moreover, occupation has proven to be practically unworkable. With the collapse of the old regime, the political and security infrastructure of the country were dismantled and the logic of occupation allowed the ensuing political and security vacuum to persist. This was a mistake that still haunts us. With occupation came the suppression of Iraqi sovereignty. Another policy decision that Iraqis warned against before military action. Sovereignty, like occupation, is an emotional issue that touches on people's dignity and nationhood. But there is also a very practical issue to the suppression of sovereignty. The Coalition did not have the resources, the understanding, or the ability to run the Iraqi state. Iraqis, as we urged, should have run the Iraqi state and its institutions. An Iraqi government, with authorities seen by the people as embodying the power of the state, should have been a pillar of post-liberation transition. I should add here that it was indeed with difficulty that the CPA was persuaded to create a Governing Council of Iraqis rather than the Advisory Council of Iraqis that they wished to create. Many Iraqis protested strongly, saying it is the Iraqis who should form the government and the United States should provide the advice, not the other way around. The security situation immediately exposed some of the contradictions of the occupation. Law and order broke down and there was little effort by Coalition forces to put a stop to it; indeed, probably Coalition Forces were unable, did not have the resources to put a stop in the degeneration of law and order. Looting, kidnapping, blackmail, and assassinations were ignored by the Coalition. People had no one to turn to. The military forces did not have the personnel, the language skills, the intelligence capacities, or the social understanding to be an effective police and security force. Yet, really little attempt was made to mobilize local Iraqi resources in security and law enforcement. To my knowledge, not one individual has been captured, indicted, and tried for a crime of looting, kidnapping, or assassination in Iraq, or indeed any crime committed against an Iraqi, in the past 14 months. The message that went to troublemakers in Iraq is that the coast is clear. The message to ordinary law-abiding citizens was that the Coalition did not care about their safety, only about force protection. Now this may not have been the reality, but I am talking about perceptions and perceptions are important in attitudes. Iraqis had high expectations after liberation. Repressed and deprived of basic necessities for decades, Iraqis were expecting some dividends from liberation in the form of more electricity, water, sanitation, personal safety, redress of grievance, participation in a democratic process. Perhaps these expectations were unrealistic. Certainly, delivery was short. Moreover, some sectors of society were disenfranchised as a result of policy decisions. The incidents in Abu Ghraib unfortunately compounded the sense of alienation felt by Iraqis. Within all this context, public diplomacy and communication between the Coalition and the people was virtually non- existent. The local Iraqi television station, as we all know, was a dismal failure. The Coalition did not exploit the opportunity or the resources of the press or any other vehicles to communicate with the people, to tell them what to expect and what they could not expect, to tell them why electricity was not available, why water was not available, to tell them that this was because of terrorist activities and so on. Iraqis lived in the dark and fed on rumors and urban myths. In short, the dividends of liberation did not trickle down to the majority of Iraqi society. Unfortunately, Iraqis did not have the opportunity to be an active part of their own liberation, to be part of liberation and part of the transition process. A feeling of alienation has set in because of a feeling of a disempowerment and disenfranchisement. Today there are disturbing voices in the United States calling for the United States to lower our sights in Iraq. The voices claim that the U.S. objective should not be democratization and reform, but only stability. It is a call that comes out of a sense of panic. But stability can hardly be a vindication for the sacrifices made by the United States, by its Coalition partners, and by Iraqis. Stability, of course, is important. But we have a right through our sacrifices to aim for a higher goal. We must stay firmly committed to a vision of democracy in Iraq. This is important for Iraqis and important for the credibility of the United States in the region. As we move forward, the paradigm of occupation has to be abandoned in favor of a paradigm of a true partnership. As we build our country, Iraqis need the support of the United States and we need the multinational forces in Iraq to help us until we can handle security issues on our own. Mr. Chairman, we cannot do without multinational forces now, and we need international support in reconstruction and economic recovery. Failure in Iraq is absolutely not an option. It will plunge Iraq and the region into anarchy and give victory to terrorists, extremists, and fanatics. We must succeed, and we must do it in partnership with the United States and the international community. Iraqis look forward to a lasting and firm friendship with the United States based on mutual respect, shared interests, institutional cooperation, and friendship amongst our two nations. Thank you very much. I would be happy to answer questions. [The prepared statement of Ms. Al-Rahim follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.012 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.013 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.014 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.015 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.016 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.017 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.018 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.019 Mr. Shays. Thank you very much. I am going to turn to Mr. Turner in a second to start off. But first I want to say, you have studied in Great Britain, you have studied in France, and you are well aware of American frankness. I would love to have a nice dialog that is very candid. So we are going to ask you questions that may appear to be aggressive, but from that we learn, as I think you know. I just want to say whenever I hear someone say we have lost over 800 Americans, as of June 13, we have lost 833 Americans. Each one of those lives is precious. We have 4,704 wounded, and each one of those lives is precious and many of them have come back without arms, limbs, their faces have been blown apart. Obviously, each one of those incidences tears our heart apart. I think your testimony can help us be more successful, and ultimately, have less deaths, less wounded, and can move this transition along. So I cannot wait to have the opportunity to talk with you. But it is Mr. Turner, then we are going to go to Mrs. Maloney, and then Mr. Platts, and then I will have my opportunity. I believe in the 10-minute rule, so that is what we are going to do. We have better dialog that. You are on, Mr. Turner. Mr. Turner. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Al-Rahim, for your honest discussion and for the issues that you brought before us. Your passion and commitment to the end result of a democracy for Iraq really shows your interest in a partnership. And your experience and intellect that you bring in giving a critical analysis of where we have gone wrong in areas of communication and approach and ways that we can improve it is very helpful. There is no question that whenever you are an invading military force, that transition from an invading force to one of partnership is difficult to balance. And in this instance, there is no question that there was an invasion that occurred. Second, the issue that we all know of the instability in Iraq is, in part, contributed by individuals that have entered Iraq that are not even representative of the Iraqi people that cause difficulty for both of us as we try to manage both the safety of our troops and, of course, the safety of the Iraqis. But the issues that you raise are ones where decisions could be made for outcomes to be different. I am assuming by your passionate commitment to success and your description of these that you do not believe that learning these lessons is too late and that we still have an opportunity for a partnership that could result in not only just success for a transition of democracy, but a positive relationship between the Iraqi people and the United States. Ms. Al-Rahim. Congressman, thank you very much. First of all, I want to affirm that all Iraqis want a partnership with the United States and they want a friendship with the Untied States. It is a question of how to remodel the relationship so that it is not a relationship of occupier and occupied, but of two equal partners who can work in synergy and in cooperation to forge a friendship. We need the United States and we do not feel that we can go it alone by any means. But we also want this friendship to be a long-term friendship, not just a friendship while we rebuild the country. We do not see this as a temporary thing. We want it to be long-lasting and we want it to be stable. This is why I think it is important to look at areas of error in order to rectify them. Mr. Turner. On the issue of democracy, when we talk about that as being a mutually shared goal and a goal of the Iraqi people, when we talk about a democracy here, obviously, we are talking about not just our form of government but really historically, what goes to the fabric of American society and the birth of our Nation. When we talk about democracy in Iraq and that being a goal, in looking at both the period of oppression for Iraq and also the educational system and the anti-West communication that had to occur throughout the system, what do you think the view is of democracy? And is it a shared concept? Is part of our issue one of communicating what democracy is, how it works, and really what it brings? Ms. Al-Rahim. Democracy happens to be the word most used by Iraqis in their political discussions. Now this does not mean that all Iraqis mean one thing by democracy, nor does it mean that they mean the same thing as the United States would mean by democracy. But I think that there are constant human values attached to democracy that all nations share that are beyond a certain country or a certain group of people, and that Iraqis are as capable of sharing those democratic values as any nation on Earth and is capable of practicing democracy as any nation. However, you did point to some serious issues. We had a period of repression that lasted 35 years. We have an education system that was corrupted by a dictatorship. And we have a number of other problems in Iraq that lead me to believe that democracy is going to have to be built block by block. In any case, I do not believe democracy is a kit that you take off of a shelf and assemble in this country or that. It has to be a process that moves forward and has to grow organically within a country. It is a series of policies, of principles, of operational mechanisms and practices that are implemented, the sum of all of which eventually amount to something recognizable as democracy. What frightens me is that if the United States and the rest of the world forget about democracy in Iraq and say, well, Iraq is not going to be democratic, it is inherently an undemocratic society, that Iraqis will also give up on the notion of democracy. And yes, stability is important, and stability is important for a democracy to flourish. But we really have made a good start in this democratic process. We have a free press. We have a civil society that is very vibrant. We have NGO's that have started, independent professional associations, entrepreneurs; all kinds of seeds of democracy. We do not want those to die. And it is very important for the United States and for the international community to reinforce and nurture those seeds rather than say, well, it is hopeless anyway. Mr. Turner. I think that you certainly have the U.S. commitment to democracy, and certainly there will always be a chorus of naysayers. But the basic bedrock of democracy is a belief in freedom of individual liberty, and that certainly includes everyone. I do have one concern about the issue of how a democratic Iraq is structured. One of the things that struck me while I was there is that as we went to schools, and we were there as the school was letting out and the parents came and were picking up their kids, we were able to have a free flow discussion about the issues of the school, their community, and the city of Baghdad. What we do not have here that is an issue that will have to be addressed in Iraq is that you do have, even though there will be freedoms in the economy of entrepreneurialship, you do have a concentrated commodity economy with oil. You have almost a singular commodity economy, but I am going to say concentrated in the hopefulness that the entrepreneurialship that will occur will rise and play a big role in the economy. That concentrated commodity economy is going to require some entity to have both control and disposition of those funds. That is a role that currently you do not see in like our country or other structured democracies, is that you see predominantly the government having authority over tax collection and the disposition of those funds but not over the issue of a jointly owned commodity. How do you see that as being an issue of concern and what thoughts do you have as to how that is addressed? Ms. Al-Rahim. In fact, Congressman, you do touch on a very important issue. All the countries, apart from the countries in Europe, that rely so heavily on oil income have been called the ``renter states.'' In other words, states that do not need to do anything except collect the revenue from oil. Therefore, instead of no taxation without representation, it is no representation without taxation. So, you do not tax them, they do not have to be represented, and therefore the government is not accountable. And that is really the problem I think that you are addressing. There are some studies that have said that countries that rely over-heavily on oil, where oil is the monopoly of the state, have great difficulty in democratizing. Certainly, there is that risk. I do not think, however, that at this stage we can anything other than keep oil revenues in the hands of the government. I think anything else would truly destabilize the country, partly because of the massive reconstruction effort that needs to be orchestrated and managed by the government. However, I would like to point to some historical facts about Iraq. First of all, Iraq is rich in other respects, not just oil. We have very good agricultural potential, we have plenty of water, we have other mineral resources, and we have an extremely entrepreneurial and highly educated population that is eager to do things. In the 1950's there was a movement toward private sector industrialization in Iraq which was very successful. It was somewhat dropped in the 1960's, revived in the early 1970's again very successfully. We must place a lot of emphasis on this private sector because this is how we form civil society and a middle class that can actually ask for accountability from its government. This is something that we need to concentrate on because right now we cannot say privatize oil. Mr. Turner. I thank you very much. I will just note than in the many trips by helicopter for hours to different communities, I was struck by the endless amount of wheat fields and the irrigation. And I hope you do not take this the wrong way, but I said, ``My God, this is a real country. It has more than oil. It has tremendous potential in other ways.'' At this time the Chair would recognize Mrs. Maloney. Mrs. Maloney. I thank you for your testimony and really for your many years of working to promote democracy and respect for human rights. I am very pleased that you are now in a position and with the authority to help work toward these changes in Iraq. You mentioned in your testimony that critical to the future success of Iraq is the support of the international community. I would say, on both sides of the aisle, we could not agree more. We have had efforts to involve the United Nations more, the G-7 needs to be involved more, NATO, I would say the Arab League, and definitely the countries surrounding Iraq that have a great stake in the stability and future strength of Iraq, and I would say muslim leaders of other countries, given the fact that 97 percent of the country is muslim. So my question to you, are there any other international organizations we should be reaching out to to help support Iraq? And do you have any direction on how we could be more successful for the Iraqi people in securing international support? Now the burden is 97 percent on the United States of America. We would welcome more resources in any form to help the Iraqi people. Ms. Al-Rahim. Thank you very much. I believe you have mentioned all the organizations I can possibly think of-the United Nations, G-8, NATO, muslim countries, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, and so on and so forth. The U.N. resolution which was recently passed I believe on June 8th really opens the door for many more nations to support Iraqi reconstruction and the political, physical, and economic rebuilding of Iraq. Additionally, I believe that the transfer of all sovereignty and authority to an Iraqi government on June 8th will further make it easier for other countries to help out. However, I may be mistaken, but I believe you were thinking in terms of military support. Mrs. Maloney. No. All support. Certainly humanitarian, military, NGO's, financial--support in any form. Ms. Al-Rahim. Yes. I think with the U.N. resolution and with the transfer of sovereignty we will be able to solicit assistance from a much wider range of countries than we have been up until this moment, and particularly support in reconstruction, financial support through extinction of debts to Iraq, of advancing more grants and loans to Iraq. We should not forget the enormous support that we need in training. This is a very big and important field and training support should come for our own military forces, for our security forces, but also training in technologies, in professions, and so on. There is a whole array that I think will be forthcoming. Mrs. Maloney. I hope that you are correct because it would be very helpful. One of the biggest challenges confronting Iraq now is security. The American military has worked incredibly hard to empower and work with the Iraqi police, the border patrol, the new civilian defense force. But it seems any country needs security in their borders in order to move forward with education and all the other things that a country needs to do to help their people. But security appears to be the biggest obstacle. Security for the Iraqi people, for anyone in Iraq, it is very challenging. And your comments on that, I was deeply disturbed to read reports of Iraqi police stations being overwhelmed and really taken by rogue militant groups. This cannot happen in a country. There is no order. And your comments on what we could do to improve the security, but it is extremely problematic for your new government if your streets are not secure. That appears to be the biggest challenge you have. Ms. Al-Rahim. It is, in fact, the biggest challenge. The Iraqi Governing Council has long advocated creating a core security force of Iraqis who are committed to the new order. I think one of the problems we have had in creating the current police force is that we have sacrificed quantity for quality, both in terms of selecting the people for the police force and in terms of training. We need to improve the selection process and the training, and we need to put the police force under Iraqi leadership so that they feel that they are part of the process of transition and not outside it. This is going to contribute to improved security, which we need if we are going to have elections in January. Mrs. Maloney. It was my understanding that the Iraqi police force is under Iraqi leadership. That there is a police chief, whose life has been threatened several times. That it is under Iraqi leadership. It appears to be that the problem is they are not holding the line. It is under Iraqi leadership. But if someone overwhelmed you, taking over your police station and taking over the streets, they are not being successful. So from what I read in the papers, it appears that the structure is under Iraqi leadership. Sometimes the American military has had to come in and restore order because the police force has not been capable of restoring the order. Now, is that because there is a lack of will in the heart of the people? Why can they not restore order? Ms. Al-Rahim. In terms of Iraqi leadership, the Iraqi Ministry of Interior did not have full authority. The ministries that continue to function still function under CPA authority and not under Iraqi authority. The Minister of Interior has no power to make decisions unilaterally. And I think this is a structural problem. Hopefully, it will be fixed by June 30th. Mrs. Maloney. On June 30th, when the Ministry of the Interior takes over, has complete authority and then they control completely the police, the border patrol, the civilian patrol, what happens if rogue militant groups are then able to overwhelm the police force of Iraq? Then you would have chaos I would think. So it is a tremendous challenge. And, in my opinion, it is more than a structural problem of who is in charge. All I know is in New York we have the best and the finest, that is what we call the police force, and when they go out on the streets they are not calling the Department of the Interior or the police chief, they are out there on their own restoring order, making sure people are protected, and getting the job done, very much like the American military does. If you are on the front line, you get the job done; you cannot call central headquarters. And what is happening, from what I am reading in the papers, is they are not getting the job done. They are being overwhelmed, they are scattering, they are not getting the job done. And when you take over complete power, if they are not able to get the job done, as an Iraqi citizen I would be extremely concerned because the safety of my children and my neighbors would be very much at stake. Maybe that is something we have to look at. But one thing that you mentioned in your statement, you said that many of the Iraqi people, if I quote you correctly, lived in the dark, that they were fed rumors, they did not understand the good intentions of how we were trying to restore the infrastructure, the schools, the electricity. So my question to you is, how can we, the United States, countries that come in to help, and the new Iraqi government, use the tools of public diplomacy in a better way in Iraq and prevent the people from relying on information that may be from a very biased source that does not in their goal support the independence and success of the new Iraqi government? How can we do a better job in getting that out? Ms. Al-Rahim. First of all, there has to be a much better media in Iraq, television particularly, that features Iraqis. The Iraqi television station or stations have to be content- rich. They have to focus on the issues and they have to be utilized to inform people about what is happening, to address people's concerns, and to be a forum for people to send their grievances. We have not used any of that, neither through newspapers, nor television, nor radio. This is going to be a major responsibility for the new Iraqi government but I think the United States can help with this. Unfortunately, it is no longer up to the United States to run--and I do not say unfortunately--but it really will not be up to the United States from now on to run Iraqi television and the Iraqi media. It has to be the new government. But these resources must be utilized because so far they have done a poor job. I would like to go back, by the way, to the issue of security. I mentioned the quantity versus quality. There is an important issue, and that is it is not just a question of confronting these militants or terrorists, it is also of disbanding their cells. That is an intelligence operation and that has not been done very well by the Coalition. Iraqis will have to take over that job, and to the extent they succeed in intelligence, they will succeed in deterring terrorism and security threats. Mrs. Maloney. I want to thank you for your testimony. My time is up. But very briefly, a number of men and women are serving in Iraq from the district that I represent and they would like very much to come home. And they would like very much not to have to go into streets and restore order. They do not want to do that. They feel they have to do it to restore the order in the streets to give the new government a chance. So anything you can do through your government to strengthen the forces and give them the support is absolutely critical. Without security, without order, you do not have a country. And our military, as one Captain told me, he said, ``Carolyn, we do not want to go into any towns. We want to just be here in support of the Iraqi people. But if chaos breaks out and militant hoodlums are taking over the streets, they do not have any other choice.'' So I just want to plead with you to make that a high priority of your new government. We all wish you all the best. Ms. Al-Rahim. I will certainly relay that. Thank you. Mr. Shays. Your statement is rich with information and most of it is very easy for me to accept. Some of it, when I think about it, I weep internally because I think: If only. When I was there in April a year ago, I met a gentleman named Mohammed Abdul Hassan. He had been in an Iranian prison for nearly 15 years, he did not make the swap, and he came back at age 55 to marry and start a family. I marveled at his tough life, and he gave me the feeling that his life was not too much different than a lot of Iraqis. And I got the sense that Iraqis are very tough people who have known a tremendous amount of suffering. But he was very eager to get on with his life and he had no resentments, which was to me very interesting. I asked him things that we did that troubled him. He told me, and they were simple things, but they meant a lot to him. Just even throwing candy on the ground and seeing children pick it up as if, as he said, they were dogs or chickens. Just even that was an image that he did not like to see. An individual soldier extending his hand and a woman going like this, saying thank you but--what she was saying was we do not shake hands with strangers, but thank you for honoring me. Things like that. I learned from some that if an American soldier humiliates a man in front of his wife, he might as well have put a dagger in his belly and twisted it. And I learned, most of all, that you want this to be an Iraqi revolution, not an American revolution. Now I understand that, and I understand it because we did not want it to be a French revolution when we depended on the French to block the Brits from coming in and prevent them from leaving the ports during our revolutionary war. But I will start with the thing that I find most puzzling about your statement. You say that declaring an occupation dealt a blow to Iraqi dignity and national pride. You know, I do not know if we declared that as much as the rest of the world declared it and we had to acknowledge it. What I would like you to do is tell me what was the alternative of an occupation in the first few days and weeks and months. Maybe you could start by giving me a sense of what you mean. Ms. Al-Rahim. Mr. Chairman, my understanding is that indeed the United States did want the legal label of occupation. If I am mistaken about that, then---- Mr. Shays. Well let us assume it is true. But what I do not understand quite is it the label that troubled you, or it was the reality that troubled you? Because I do not know even without the label if we could have prevented the reality. I mean, we overthrew a government. We could have just gotten up and left but that would have been horrendous. Were we to automatically establish a government right like that? Tell me. Ms. Al-Rahim. Mr. Chairman, yes. It is my belief, and many Iraqis share this, that by July when the Iraqi Governing Council was formed---- Mr. Shays. Last year. Ms. Al-Rahim. Last July, July 2003, by then it was high time an Iraqi government, not just an Iraqi Governing Council, but that an Iraqi government be formed, given authority to run the country, to run the ministries, and for the Coalition to remain in Iraq but to take a backseat certainly on political decisionmaking, on policies, and so on. We certainly needed the military forces to remain, and we still need them to remain, but it is the image of a disempowered Iraqi Governing Council that could not take a single decision and where the head of the CPA could say I am the ultimate authority in Iraq, I can veto anything, nobody else has any right to take any decision, we are the only ones in power. Mr. Shays. Bottom line, you would have liked to have seen last July, and you believe it could have been pulled off then, you would have liked to have seen the transfer of power in a sense that we are ultimately doing this June 30th. Ms. Al-Rahim. Yes, indeed, sir. Mr. Shays. OK. Ms. Al-Rahim. May I finish? Mr. Shays. Sure. Ms. Al-Rahim. I also believe that more people should have been brought into the political process through an Iraqi conference or through engaging more political parties and more political or social sectors from Iraqi society in some kind of political process, through a national assembly, or through consultative councils. One of the problems is that many Iraqi groups, even the limited political bodies that were created, were not fully representative of the whole richness of Iraqi society. Mr. Shays. Behind me is Dr. Nick Palarino, and he helped organize my five trips in the last year. What we learned very quickly were things like Iraqis saying to us, ``My father, my uncle, my cousin is in the army, he is not a bad man. There are bad people, get them out, but why punish my father?'' Or ``I have a family member in the government. Why do they have no future? Why would you do this?'' I had many Iraqis say, ``We understand why you have to do certain things, but why cannot we guard the hospitals?'' This was early on. And I remember when the hotel was first bombed there were 30 Iraqis injured and 6 killed. They did not run away. They tried to prevent the terrorist and succeeded in preventing the terrorists from basically imploding the hotel. Were those the things that we should have been listening to? Ms. Al-Rahim. Yes. Absolutely, sir. This must have been in the early period because, in fact, the determination of Iraqis to deter terrorists in those early periods were really powerful. All Iraqis wanted to contribute. I referred in my written statement to the issue of disbanding the Iraqi army and I called it a hatchet job where laser surgery was required. What we should have done, indeed I am certainly not in favor of the Baath Party and I think many people in the Iraqi army had blood on their hands, however, to simply dismiss both of them, give them no compensation, no pension, no salary, and no prospect of getting any job whatsoever, both lost us a lot of talent and capability and angered a very large number of Iraqis. Mr. Shays. Let me just interrupt you there. I was listening to Ehud Barach, the former Foreign Minister of Israel, in his analysis of the failures, he said, ``The Baathist Party was not the Nazi Party. There were bad people. But,'' he said, ``how did you get your child an education? How did you support your family? That was one way to succeed in Iraq.'' And so I am just extending the point that even a Jewish leader was saying to us what an unfortunate mistake. Ms. Al-Rahim. I think the thing about the de-Baathification is it is much more important to take out the culture of the Baath than just ordinary individual Baathists. And that is what we should have concentrated on. Mr. Shays. I want to know if these observations are observations you agree with. First off, the statistic I have is that two-thirds of the Iraqi people want us to leave, and two- thirds of them want us to stay, and they are sticking to it. [Laughter.] Ms. Al-Rahim. Yes. Iraqis are schizophrenic about this particular issue. Mr. Shays. I understand. So, as my staff says, in that respect they are ready for democracy. [Laughter.] Many Iraqis told me--they did not even say it, I felt it, they were suspicious of us as the government because they never had a government they could trust. It is almost by definition that if you are part of government, you cannot be trusted, and certainly not a foreign power. Does that seem consistent with what you would feel is out there? Ms. Al-Rahim. The problem was that there was no government. Of course, Iraqis distrust government. All nations distrust government, but perhaps Iraqis distrust government more than others. The problem, Mr. Chairman, was that there was no government. The Coalition simply could not substitute an Iraqi government. Mr. Shays. Fair enough. I think you have made your point, and I think it is an excellent point. Another observation that I had was that they blamed us for the sanctions, not Saddam. And I had so many Iraqis tell me of loved ones or neighbors that had been killed in their effort to rebel against Saddam and blamed us because we had told them to rebel and yet left the Republican Guard in place. Are those things that seem consistent with your view, one, that they blame us for the sanctions, and two, that they blame us for saying rebel against Saddam? Ms. Al-Rahim. Yes. I would qualify that, I do not think this is universal. The important thing is that the Iraqis were willing to give the United States the benefit of the doubt after liberation, and that is really important. Mr. Shays. OK. And then we squandered it. Let me proceed a little bit longer and then I can go back to you if you have some questions. Do you have some questions? OK. Let us go to Mr. Platts. Mr. Platts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Al-Rahim, thank you for your testimony and your clear devotion and dedication to your fellow Iraqis and the liberation of your nation. I want to followup on the chairman's question, his initial question was actually what I was contemplating, is the issue of how quickly sovereignty should have been turned over to the Iraqis. By your statement, you believe it should have been and could have been by July of last year. I think part of the chairman's efforts here today is to learn from what has happened and how things maybe could have been done in a different way and perhaps better way. How would we have gone about, in those 2\\1/ 2\\, maybe 3 months between the initial liberation and the establishment of a government, how would you suggest we would have identified who the government would be, who would be in charge of the ministries? How would the Coalition authority select those individuals? Ms. Al-Rahim. Congressman, it was possible to identify a Governing Council by early July. I am not arguing about the people. I am saying they were not given any authority. Mr. Platts. Would you acknowledge that identifying a group that will be given a position of advisory input, to have some working relationship, is different than saying you have full sovereignty and full decisionmaking power over all of Iraq and all of the citizens? Ms. Al-Rahim. In the end, the Governing Council was in limbo. It was neither an advisory body nor was it a rulemaking authoritative body. In any case, any government that could have been appointed in July would have had to be an Interim Government awaiting elections. I do not really see where the problem is. The CPA identified a Governing Council, it identified ministers. It is just that they had no authority to do anything. Mr. Platts. The process was a little different in the sense of identifying that Iraqi Governing Council versus the Interim Government that is now going to assume sovereignty and the ability to bring in the U.N. and have a broader input to who the ones given the actual sovereignty will be. It just seems that ability would have been a little challenged to do it in 2\\1/2\\ months. Ms. Al-Rahim. Congressman, the U.N. was already involved. Sergio DeMello, the representative of Khoffi Anan, was in Baghdad and was involved in the formation of the Governing Council. It may be doubtful whether it would have been formed without his assistance, actually. Mr. Platts. And I certainly appreciate your position, as appropriately it should be, that the sooner the Iraqis have their own sovereignty, the better. It just seems that given the challenges that we saw especially regarding security in those initial months and continue to see, the ability to so quickly say you have complete authority and responsibility and we are selecting you versus we are going to try to have input. When I visited Iraq in October and met with a number of the ministers, they certainly in my personal conversations with them did not convey that they had no input. In fact, they seemed to have a very positive working relationship with their Coalition Provisional Authority counterparts and conveyed to me and to I think other members of our delegation that they were appreciative of the input they had in their respective ministries. And your impression is that they really did not? Ms. Al-Rahim. They did not have very much influence. They did not control their budgets. They did not set policies for their ministries. Now, over time, they did sort of arrest authority from the CPA. So that by early this year many of the ministers did have a certain level of autonomy, but certainly not in October. I also want to go back to the July timeframe and say that I lived in Iraq from very early May until November, and in July the security situation was far, far better than it was in the fall and later on. Yes, we were having some sabotage activities and so on, but it was a manageable situation at that time. So it becomes a question of a chicken and egg story. Mr. Platts. The final area I wanted to touch on was in your assessment of what could have been done better in the area of, as you talked about in your testimony, expectations and delivery and the disbelief after the liberation occurred, whether it be electricity, water, other infrastructure related services that were so behind the times, of how quickly they were being provided. My understanding from my visit and other testimony that we have had over the past year is that was due in part to the lack of investment in the infrastructure by Saddam and the diversion of his resources to military capabilities and things. What would be your assessment of the individuals who were selected as part of the Iraqi Governing Council in their public efforts to try to convey realistic expectations of how long it would take to rebuild? I visited a power plant, what appears to be technology probably 40 years old, and it is not something that overnight you can replace. And although perhaps it was the impression the United States, Great Britain, the other nations are here and they are just going to fix everything, it would not be a realistic expectation. So what would be your assessment of the Iraqi leaders, Governing Council members and others such as yourself, in trying to get the message out to the average Iraqi that they are committing their time and American taxpayers money to rebuild our infrastructure. It will not happen overnight, to try to lessen those expectations so they are more realistic and not unrealistic? Ms. Al-Rahim. First of all, I agree with you that expectations were unrealistic given the situation. But there was always ``The man in the moon'' analogy, what journalists have called it: If the United States can get a man on the moon, can't it fix the electricity. I also want to acknowledge that neither Iraqis in the Governing Council nor the Coalition made enough of an effort through the media and through public outreach to explain to Iraqis why these expectations were unrealistic, when such expectations could be met, over what period of time, and when things went wrong nobody explained to the average Iraqi why they had gone wrong. We had a power outage for 24 hours in Baghdad and nobody came on television afterwards to explain why. This, by the way, was simultaneous with the brown out in New York and Northeast United States. Of course, the Iraqis immediately said, ``See, the whole of New York and Northeast United States browns out, they fix it right away. We have 24 hours of a blackout, nobody even tells us.'' Mr. Platts. Sort of like being on Amtrak and the train stops and you do not know what is happening and no one tells you times 100. Ms. Al-Rahim. Times 100. And the failure was both CPA and Iraqi, and I do acknowledge that. Mr. Platts. And we heard I think an admission by the CPA when I was there in October that they were not adequately getting the message out and communicating to the average Iraqi citizen. One of the kind of heart-wrenching stories I came back with from our visit was that of the [Arabic name] hospital in Baghdad and visiting the maternity ward, the ICU, the NIC unit I call it, and the gratitude of the Iraqi doctor who was administering the hospital for the technology that the Coalition had brought in and of our efforts to immunize--I think now we are up to about 85 percent of Iraqi children are immunized--and how dramatically different that is than under the Saddam Hussein regime where, from what he told us, the formula was purposely poisoned for the Iraqi babies to purposely escalate the infant mortality rate, I think it was 107 per 1,000. He knew what was done before and how the Iraqi government was, in essence, killing its own children, how the Coalition Authority came in and was helping to save the Iraqi children, and he personally knew that. But, clearly, that message was not being well conveyed and understood and embraced by the average Iraqi, by your comments, and that lack of communication in a broad sense was hurting the effort. Ms. Al-Rahim. Lack of communication played a big role I think in Iraqi perceptions and attitudes. And it is very sad. Mr. Platts. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. And again, Ms. Al-Rahim, I thank you for your leadership and I certainly wish you and your nation and its citizens great success as you move forward and assume full sovereignty and embrace the liberties that you now enjoy. Ms. Al-Rahim. Thank you. Mr. Platts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Shays. Thank you very much. I am going to close up here. I know we need to get to the second panel. My only reference to Amtrak and being on a train is I think most Americans who have been in that experience know how irritating even that little simple inconvenience can be. You want to get somewhere, the train is an hour and a half late, you want to know why it is late, no one tells you why, no one tells you when you are going to get there. I just can imagine what it must be for Iraqis. But let me just tell you expectations on the side. And it is our own fault because our intelligence was so bad. We thought all we had to do was protect the infrastructure so that we could get it operating again, little did we know that it was 30 years old and it was kept together by gum and rubber bands. It was a shock certainly to Members of Congress to realize that in order to get things running again we had to provide everything new. And some of it was a challenge because it was French-and German-made and we were not getting much interaction from those two countries. So, lots of expectations I think on both sides. So, welcome to the world of humanity. I want to read one statement you said because I think it is the most frustrating for me because this is where Americans shine. But it also is important because it seems so obvious. You write, ``In all spheres of life, Iraqis lived on rumors and urban myths. It is by now no secret that the television station established by the Coalition was a failure. Whereas it should have been extensively used by the Coalition and Iraqi officials to communicate with people, provide information, address concerns, and build confidence, the station was instead virtually content-free.'' I can just tell you, to the extent Members could get there, and quite often we were discouraged from going, that is something we kept asking because we had Iraqis asking us, particularly even the Queen of Jordan, she said, ``America, the country that communicates better than anyone else, with all your expertise and you could not do anything to counter Al-Jazira and you could not communicate with the Iraqi people.'' So it is one of the grand mysteries of our failure. And we have witnesses later that can testify. I do think, though, we have a local station that has gained some credibility. Is it Al-Iraqiya? Ms. Al-Rahim. Al-Iraqiya is the failed one. There is a new one called Al-Hurra which appears to be gathering momentum. Mr. Shays. Let me just tell you, Al-Iraqiya, I am told, is listened to by more Iraqis than even Al-Jazira is. Ms. Al-Rahim. Because most Iraqis do not have satellite. You do not need satellite for Al-Iraqiya, you need satellite for Al-Jazira. Anyone who has satellite does not watch Al- Iraqiya. But most people do not have satellite. In the rural areas and in the provinces they do not. Mr. Shays. My biggest criticism, and I would like you to react to it, and if you are not comfortable, then that is fine, but the administration had a chance to allow the military to get Saddam's old regime members to fight the terrorists and deal with security and make sure our prisons were obviously run well and properly, and he had the chance to have the State Department, which is far more culturally sensitive, run the rebuilding. The administration decided that the chain of command, and I mean no disrespect to the military, but the chain of the command would go through the military. I know for a fact, because I remember having dialog with State Department last year, they were saying we need Arabic speakers, we need Iraqi-Americans, and they told us the reactions that would happen if we did certain things, which we ended up doing. They predicted so much of this. What I feel good about is that on June 30th the military will be in charge of what they do best--and by the way, they build schools well, they do all those other things well, but we were asking them to build schools in the daytime and fight the bad folks at night. We were asking them to work 18 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year. And what I am happy about now is that we will have an ambassador who will answer to the State Department. And he has said, and he has made it very clear to me, he is an ambassador, he is not Mr. Bremer, he is a representative of our government to interact with the sovereign government of Iraq. I will say one other thing that makes me feel good because I feel the administration gets it. In a conversation with Condaleeza Rice a week and a half ago with nine Members, for about an hour and a half she was very fluent, as she is, but very willing to go wherever the dialog went. In other words, there was a lot of good interaction. And she said something at the end that sent shivers up my back. She said, and I thought I knew where she was going, she said, ``We had years before the Declaration of Independence to understand democracy and the idea of minority rights.'' The Declaration of Independence, 1776, Articles of Confederation, the Constitution. Now I thought she was saying finally, after 13 years, we got it right with the Constitution. She waited a second, looked every one of us in the eye, and said, ``And in that Constitution I was only three-fifths a person.'' Which has to make Americans be a little more compassionate, a little more understanding that there may have to be compromises in this new government that we will not like and that maybe you will not like. And so let me end with this. What happens if this new government decides that they do not want a woman representative? What happens if they decide they do not want women in the ministry? What happens if this government decides that girls in school are not going to get the same education as boys in school? I want to ask you what happens there, and I know it is a hypothetical, but I am not sure it is going to be just the way I hope it will be and maybe not the way you hope it will be. So tell me what you think about that and how we should react if, in the end, we see a government that simply has lost many opportunities. Will you say, well, we screwed it up a year, so you are allowed to do the same thing? Or what will you say? Ms. Al-Rahim. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I do not think that this will happen. Iraqis are very sensitive to women's rights now. And by the way, women have had a big role in the Iraqi society, professionally not politically, for many decades. It is unlikely. What I would want, if they decide they do not want women ministers, I would want the right to advocate for women's rights. Even if a government says, no, we do not want women in this position, I want the right to lobby and speak freely. And I hope that the United States will support me in maintaining my right to speak, not in imposing anything on the government. I want to commend the civil affairs people in the U.S. military, and I mentioned them, by the way, in my written statement, who did a stellar job with local citizens groups and local councils. I also want to say that, indeed, everybody in the Coalition worked 18 hours a day, at least, and Ambassador Bremer worked 36 hours a day. Mr. Shays. I know that. Ms. Al-Rahim. It was phenomenal and we were full of admiration and awe for their energy and for their good will. It is just that good will was not conveyed in the best way possible. This is the problem we had. So I really do have a great admiration and appreciation for the work they did. I also admire the fact that you went over to Iraq five times, four of them with an NGO. That is quite a statement. Mr. Shays. That is the Peace Corps in me. Ms. Al-Rahim. Well, as the head of an NGO for a long time, I really appreciate that. Mr. Shays. Thank you. I will just say to you, you have been a wonderful witness. I have tremendous love and respect for the Iraqi people. I pray that your new government will succeed. I also want to say to you that I consider you extraordinarily brave and courageous people because I know you put your lives at risk, you put your families at risk, and we just have nothing but admiration for you and a great deal of love and affection. Thank you very much. Ms. Al-Rahim. Thank you, and same here. Mr. Shays. With that, we will move to the second panel. I now call on our second panel. Ambassador Ronald Schlicher, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs/Iraq, Department of State; Mr. Peter Rodman, Assistant Secretary of Defense, International Security Affairs, Office of Secretary of Defense; Lieutenant General Walter L. Sharp, Director for Strategic Plans and Policy, Joint Chiefs of Staff; Mr. Gordon West, Senior Deputy Assistant Administrator, Bureau for Asia and the Near East, U.S. Agency for International Development. Gentlemen, if you would stand, I will swear you in. Let me ask you if there is anyone else you think you may need to draw upon, you may ask them to respond to a question, even if we do not end up doing it, if you would suggest that they stand up and raise their right hand, that will save us from having to swear someone in later. You may not be called on but I think it helps. So if you would raise your right hands, I will swear you in. [Witnesses sworn.] Mr. Shays. Note for the record that all of our witnesses have responded in the affirmative. If we ask anyone else to come up, we will make sure that the transcriber has their full name and title. I want to thank each and every one of you. You honor this subcommittee with your presence. You have honored America for years with your service. And we are very grateful to each and every one of you. We will go in the order I called you. I believe you are, in fact, sitting in the order I called you. So, Ambassador, you have the floor. I would like you to stick to the 5-minutes as much as you can. I will roll over the clock, but I would like you to be as close to the 5-minutes as you can. And I would like you to feel free to speak about anything that happened in the first panel either now or in response to questions. STATEMENTS OF AMBASSADOR RONALD L. SCHLICHER, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY, BUREAU OF NEAR EASTERN AFFAIRS/IRAQ, DEPARTMENT OF STATE; PETER RODMAN, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS, OFFICE OF SECRETARY OF DEFENSE; LIEUTENANT GENERAL WALTER L. SHARP, DIRECTOR FOR STRATEGIC PLANS AND POLICY, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF; GORDON WEST, SENIOR DEPUTY ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR, BUREAU FOR ASIA AND THE NEAR EAST, U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT Ambassador Schlicher. Very well. Thank you, sir. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, it is my honor today to report to you on where we stand in the State Department in terms of being prepared for the upcoming transition to Iraqi sovereignty on June 30, and in preparing to stand up our new Mission in Baghdad in a way that helps both us and the Iraqis meet the challenges that lie ahead. We hope in this discussion that we will lay out for you kind of the institutional manner in which we will approach business in the coming period and give you an idea of where we think the Iraqi Interim Government starts from as a base in political terms during this crucial period. Let me thank you in advance for the interest and support you and the Congress as a whole have afforded to our personnel, both military and civilian, on the ground in Iraq. Mr. Chairman, you mentioned Ambassador Negroponte, which leads me to my first topic of how we are organizing ourselves in State to better be able to meet the challenge of transitioning to lead agency on June 30th in managing and representing our country's interest to a sovereign Iraqi government. Our first Ambassador to the new Iraq, John Negroponte, is, of course, eminently well prepared for the challenges at had. He is one of our most capable and distinguished diplomats. He is assisted on the ground in Baghdad by his Deputy Chief of Mission, that is Ambassador Jim Jeffrey, who was serving as our Ambassador in Albania before he answered the call to serve in Iraq. Ambassador Jeffrey, by the way, is already on the ground in Baghdad, leading an advance team to smooth the transition. Ambassador Negroponte and Ambassador Jeffrey have put together a superb, very senior new team that collectively features a very impressive mix of regional experience, which of course includes language skills as well, management skills, and technical expertise, because all of those things are very much going to be needed as we pursue our interests and help the Iraqis in the period ahead. This management team will supervise a very large Mission that will initially total approximately 900 American staff, and 500 locally employed staff. Our security upgrades for our temporary chancery are proceeding on schedule and will be ready by July 1. We have also chosen a site for a permanent chancery and would like to come to agreement with the Iraqi government on the way forward on this project as soon as possible. In preparing for the transition, there has been a remarkable effort undertaken by DOD and State, by Ambassador Frank Ricciardone and General Mick Kicklighter, who led a combined team to work out how State and DOD will work together to make the transition and work together in the new post-June 30 context. Thanks to their work, the two agencies have finalized agreements between each other on respective roles, missions, resources, responsibilities and authorities so that we complement and support each other as we move ahead. Inside State, we are also in the process of reorganizing ourselves to better handle the challenges posed. Inside the near East Bureau, we are creating an operation called NEA-I, I, of course, for Iraq, which will entail my office as coordinator, a deputy political office, an economic office, a public diplomacy office, a political-military office, and an office of a coordinator for assistance in Iraqi reconstruction, which is headed by Ambassador Robin Raphel. This team in Washington will be responsible for close coordination on a constant basis with Ambassador Negroponte's team in Baghdad and with the interagency here. This new U.S. team will work in partnership with the new sovereign Iraqi Interim Government to achieve our shared goals on security and stability, and improving the delivery of services, and improving economic opportunity, and, of course, in ushering in Iraq's first democratic elections no later than January 2005. The U.N. will also remain an important partner in the effort to organize those elections. As the Iraqis begin to exercise their sovereignty, we will find ourselves in a more standard situation as far as the manner of conducting bilateral business goes. Instead of governing and ruling a country as we have been, we will doing business with a sovereign Iraqi government which will be looking to make its own decisions. On the diplomatic side of the house we will be doing business as a country team. I mention that not as a point of bureaucratic minutia, but actually because we believe the country team approach is an approach which achieves a comprehensive view of a given issue because it has all of the players in our operation around the table who can offer their perspectives on whether it is an economic perspective, a cultural sensitivity perspective, a security perspective, and in that way we come up with a common approach by which we are able to get the maximum in terms of pursuing our interest on any given issue. During the coming period, as you have pointed out, we will work with the Interim Government and the U.N. to assure free and fair elections. It is going to be very, very important during that period that we keep a clear focus on what average Iraqis and the political class are doing, saying, and thinking about the momentous events through which they and their country are passing. In this regard, the new country team will be able to build on the contacts and outreach established by CPA and Ambassador Bremer's team over the last 14 months. As someone who was personally involved in that effort, I can assure you that it was very difficult after over a decade's absence from the country, but CPA has made great strides in this regard in its time in Baghdad and the country team has a solid basis to build on. I would note also as well that our efforts to keep in touch with average Iraqis will be greatly aided by the presence outside of regional centers in Mosul, Kirkuk, Basra, and Hillah, and we are also going to embed State Department officers with military commanders in the field at the division level. We believe that this range of assets will help Ambassador Negroponte and our military commanders keep well abreast of the local context in which they are operating. Thus, with the establishment of a strong new Mission, with clear ideas about how we will coordinate the achievement of our policy and security goals, and with the establishment of the security partnership with the IIG, which my military colleagues will no doubt talk about, we are well placed in institutional terms to meet the challenges before us. Now let me switch to the Iraqi side and talk about the political basis on which the new Interim Government begins its great effort as well. We are hopeful that the preparations that the Coalition has made over the course of a year will help assure that the Iraqis are ready to resume sovereignty and move forward toward democratic elections. Our efforts have been from the ground up and from the top down. First, we provided training, advice, equipment, and facilities to help establish and strengthen local councils, regional councils, and national governing institutions. As of our last count, we had 16 Governorate councils, 90 district councils, 194 city councils, and 445 neighborhood councils. At the national level, we have already turned over I believe it is 16, I think that is the number today, ministries to direct Iraqi control and the rest of course will be transferred over the course of the next 2 weeks. We will continue to offer to the Iraqis liaison officers to provide technical expertise that the Iraqis judge is necessary to run their ministries according to the required standards. Of course, in March we also supported the Iraqis as they drafted and adopted clearly defined principles and targets in the TAL, the Transitional Administrative Law, which will be in effect as of July 1 and will stay in effect until a constitutionally based government takes office. On June 1, the former Iraqi Governing Council adopted with Ambassador Bremer's full support the Annex to the TAL that reflected the results of extensive conversations by U.N. Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi with Iraqis from all over the country. That brings us to the new Iraqi government and the base on which it starts its efforts over the next several months. And I am happy to report to you that government is in place. It is led by President Ghazi al-Yawer and a strong Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Allawi. We believe that this government is particularly notable for its competence, its experience, its diversity in all terms, politically, professionally, geographically, and gender terms. Nearly two-thirds of the ministers have doctorates, and a preponderance of the ministers are new faces who have not served previously. It is our impression that, in spite of the terrorist attacks on Iraqi civil servants, the overall reception of the Iraqi public to the new government has been very positive. We hear it in Baghdad, we hear it back here, also regional support has been very good, all of the neighbors seem to be responding well, international organizations as well. So with these things institutionally and on the ground, we feel that we are well poised to move into the coming period. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ambassador Schlicher follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.021 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.022 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.023 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.024 Mr. Shays. Thank you. It would seem that we are well poised and I just hope that we make sure we do not lose this opportunity. You did go 10 minutes but it was important we hear from you. Thank you, Ambassador. I understand you have a meeting at the White House at 4:45. Ambassador Schlicher. Yes, sir. Mr. Shays. OK. We will make sure you are not going to be late. Mr. Peter Rodman, thank you so much for being here. Mr. Rodman. Mr. Chairman, I want to commend you for the contribution and the leadership that you have shown on this issue for a long period of time, and I want to congratulate you and the committee for this timely hearing. We would be remiss not to acknowledge the serious problems that remain in Iraq, particularly in the security field. But I welcome this opportunity to discuss what our strategy is and how we see it unfolding. There is no doubt in our minds, as the Ambassador in fact confirmed before, that the overwhelming majority of people of Iraq still welcome the removal of that regime and consider it a liberation. They have concerns now about how life is now, and we share those concerns. But those concerns focus on the future, not the past. As the Ambassador mentioned, the collapse of the old regime left a vacuum, and the essence of our strategy has in fact been to prepare Iraqis and to help Iraqis fill that vacuum themselves, to build their own institutions-- political, economic, and security institutions. And the next milestone, of course, in that process is the turnover of authority on June 30. In your invitation to me, Mr. Chairman, you listed six questions. In my prepared statement I have addressed those specifically, but I want to address one in the brief time I have right now. The thrust of the question is, what accounts for the change of attitude among the Iraqis that seems to be producing this insurgency against the Coalition. With all due respect, I would say that is maybe not the whole story. It is not only that a change of attitude may be fueling the violence against the Coalition; it may equally be that these extremists are targeting the morale of the population. They are attacking the economy, they are attacking the political process, they are attacking Iraqi police. They are doing everything they can to derail the progress that is being made--to demoralize the population, to discredit the Coalition. As political leaders, you understand the phenomenon of ``What have you done for me lately?'' Fourteen months ago, they considered themselves liberated. So we have two syndromes. We have the ``man in the moon'' syndrome; we also have the ``what have you done for me lately?'' syndrome. It is obvious that 14 months after liberation hardships still exist, uncertainties still exist, and it is only natural to be resentful of the people in authority, especially if those in authority are foreign powers exercising the authority of an occupier. So it is no surprise to me, therefore, when I read opinion polls showing a lot of people saying ``we want this occupation to end.'' The fact is, we share that desire and that is why we are launched on this timetable to hand over sovereign authority right away. Now just to elaborate a little bit. I do not accept the premise that the extremists represent the majority of the people or represent the aspirations of the people. I think they are applying a kind of Leninist doctrine of ``the worse the better.'' The more damage they can do, the more they can undercut us, no matter what hardship they are imposing on the people of Iraq--that is what I think is going on. Most of all, this war is a war against the democratic political process. It is not just a war against the Coalition; it is an attempt to derail this democratic political evolution. We have some evidence of that in the famous letter of Zarqawi, the terrorist leader who is affiliated with Al-Qaeda, a message of his that we intercepted a few months ago. He is very candid. He says, ``I am racing against time,'' because on June 30 when the Americans have ``stepped back'' and the Iraqis, when their own cousins and brothers are in charge, ``what excuse'' do I have anymore? And ``how do you motivate Iraqis to kill their own brothers and cousins?'' So he knows what our strategy is and I think his most important goal is to derail it. So one can ask, what is the measure of success? One measure of our problem, of course, is the casualties, the terrible violence that continues. But another metric of success is, is he succeeding in derailing this political process? And I submit that the answer is no. And that is what gives me encouragement, that we have a strategy that is on track. Legitimacy--and we will have that certainly when an elective government takes office we hope and expect at the beginning of next year-- legitimacy will be our strongest weapon against the extremists. So our strategy is not just military. It is partly a political strategy. In fact, the essence of it I would say is political. There is a lot of legitimate criticism that I have heard, including from the Ambassador, about, is our message getting through? The bottom line, I would say, in measuring the effectiveness of our message is that we believe the Iraqi people still have the same objective we have, and I think the polls indicate that. This democratic evolution is their objective and it is our objective. The fact that they want to see the occupation end soon is absolutely natural and absolutely correct on their part. And we know, as again we have heard the Ambassador say, that all of the moderate leaders of Iraq are unanimous in telling us they want the Coalition to stay. The U.N. resolution shows international support for our present course, which is the course of the Iraqi people as they advance toward a sovereign government and a democratic government. In other words, we think that June 30th is going to be the setback for Zarqawi that he is afraid of; even more so, an elected government at the end of the year. The Iraqi people know this, I am confident of that, and that again is what gives me confidence that we are on the right track. We, in turn, should never forget that we have accomplished something of historic importance in liberating Iraq. The success of a democratic Iraq will have wider ramifications throughout the Middle East, as the President has so often declared. And so we are embarked on an enterprise of great moral as well as strategic significance. It is a vital national commitment that we as a nation need to fulfill. Congress and the President, I am confident, are united in this task and I am confident that we will succeed. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Rodman follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.025 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.026 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.027 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.028 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.029 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.030 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.031 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.032 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.033 Mr. Shays. Thank you very much. I appreciate it, Mr. Secretary. General Sharp, welcome. General Sharp. Mr. Chairman, members of the subcommittee, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to address you on this important subject today. Today, Iraqi security personnel, the United States, and 31 Coalition partners are working together to secure, protect, and establish peace and justice for all Iraqi citizens so that they may enjoy a future of their own choosing. Establishment of a safe and secure environment is the single most important element for improved Iraqi quality of life because it enables relief efforts, a free political process, economic prosperity, and social opportunity. And Iraqi people are stepping forward. More than 220,000 Iraqi citizens have taken positions in the various components of the Iraqi security forces. Multinational personnel have made significant progress in recruiting, training, and equipping Iraqi security forces. This includes about 90,000 in the Iraqi police service, 18,000 in the department of border enforcement, 35,000 in the Iraqi civil defense corps, 6,000 in the Iraqi armed forces, and 74,000 in the facilities protection. Based upon the current training and equipping schedules, we anticipate that the department of border enforcement, the Iraqi civil defense corps, and the facilities protection service will be fully trained and equipped by September of this year, the Iraqi armed forces by December 2004, and the Iraqi police by June 2005. By the end of this month, over $3 billion will have been committed to the Iraqi security forces equipping, infrastructure, and training. By June 30, the United States and its Coalition partners will transition control to a fully sovereign Iraqi Interim Government. Our responsibilities will not end with the June 30 transition. Multinational forces will remain in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi people and with the authorization of the United Nations after the Iraqi Interim Government assumes full responsibilities. These forces, and increasingly Iraqi forces, will continue to conduct offensive operations to defeat any remaining anti-Iraqi forces and neutralize destabilizing influences in Iraq in order to create a secure environment in which the Iraqi people can build their own future. They will also continue to organize, train, equip, mentor, and certify credible and capable Iraqi security forces in order to continue the transition of responsibility for security from multinational forces to Iraqi forces. Concurrently, Iraqi and multinational forces will continue to conduct stability operations to support the evolving Iraqi government, the restoration of essential services, and economic development. All multinational forces will work in close coordination and consultation with the Iraqi government at all levels. Sir, if I may divert from my written statement for 1 second. The discussion that we had earlier about the willingness to become full partners in this effort after June 30, I would like just to read very briefly from the letter that Secretary Powell sent to the U.N. Security Council which lays out exactly how we will be partners in doing that. He stated in that letter, and we fully support this, ``Development of an effective and cooperative security partnership between the multinational force and the sovereign government of Iraq is critical to the stability of Iraq. The commander of the multinational force will work in partnership with the sovereign government of Iraq to help improve security while recognizing and respecting its sovereignty.'' And then it goes on to talk to the mechanisms by which we will do that coordination and cooperation. I am confident that through this partnership we--the Iraqis, the Coalition, and the United States Armed Forces--will succeed in establishing a safe and secure environment in Iraq. Sir, I am happy to take your questions. [The prepared statement of General Sharp follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.034 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.035 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6993.036 Mr. Shays. Thank you. I am going to do this, if you do not mind, Mr. West, because I do not want to rush your statement, and Ambassador Schlicher, I hope we are not letting you go to the White House so you can go to the White House picnic. I hope there is more substance. Ambassador Schlicher. It is real work. Mr. Shays. OK. I will be there later so I will check you out. Ambassador, let me ask you three questions, because we are going to go vote and you will not be here when we get back. I want to know what was the worst decision we made. I want to know the best decision. And I want to know what is the most important thing we must do in the year to come. So I want to know the worst decision, the best decision, and what is the most important thing you think we have to remember in terms of succeeding, and, obviously, succeeding is also winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people. Can you give me an answer to "
