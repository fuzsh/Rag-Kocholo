Gor is a series of science fiction/fantasy novels by American novelist John Norman. The series includes heavy doses of philosophy and erotica as well. Gor is located in a parallel universe and ruled by a species of insectoids known as the Priest-Kings. The Priest-Kings have transplanted various Earth cultures (including Romans, Vikings, etc) onto Gor, along with the various indigenous species. The main character of the series is Tarl Cabot, a British professor and expert swordsman who interacts with all of the various beings. The series has even inspired its own subculture based on the novels that is both practiced online and in real life.

John Norman began his Gor series in 1966 with his own debut novel, Tarnsman of Gor. The series includes over 30 novels and is currently ongoing. The series is also known as the Gorean Saga, the Chronicles of Gor, the Tarl Cabot Saga and the Chronicles of Counter-Earth.
