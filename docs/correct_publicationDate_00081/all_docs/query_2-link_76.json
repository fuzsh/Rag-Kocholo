He has no inkling that his destiny is far greater than the small planet he has inhabited for the first twenty-odd years of his life. One frosty winter night in the New England woods, he finds himself transported to the planet of Gor, also known as Counter Earth, where everything is dramatically different from anything he has ever experienced. It emerges that Tarl is to be trained as a Tarnsman, one of the most honored positions in the rigid, caste-bound Gorean society. He is disciplined by the best teachers and warriors that Gor has to offer . . . but to what end?\n\nRediscover this brilliantly imagined world where men are masters and women live to serve their every desire.\n\nTarnsman of Gor is the 1st book in the Gorean Saga, but you may enjoy reading the series in any order.

Starting in December 1966 with Tarnsman of Gor the series was put on hold after its twenty-fifth installment Magicians of Gor in 1988 when DAW refused to publish its successor Witness of Gor. After several unsuccessful attempts to find a trade publishing outlet the series was brought back into print in 2001. Norman has also produced a separate science fiction series the Telnarian Histories plus two other fiction works (Ghost Dance and Time Slave) a nonfiction paperback (Imaginative Sex) and a collection of thirty short stories entitled Norman Invasions. The Totems of Abydos was published in spring 2012. All of Normans work is available both in print and as ebooks. The Internet has proven to be a fertile ground for the imagination of Normans ever-growing fan base and at Gor Chronicles (www.gorchronicles.com) a website specially created for his tremendous fan following one may read everything there is to know about this unique fictional culture. Norman is married and has three children."
