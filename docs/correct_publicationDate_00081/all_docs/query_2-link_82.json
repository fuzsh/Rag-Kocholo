The Chronicles of Gor starts out as a Planetary Romance before moving on to a sex-slave culture where most of the female main characters are legally property. The planet Gor is a Counter-Earth, a hypothetical planet in Earth's orbit on the other side of the sun, always blocked from view [1]. On Gor, some Sufficiently Advanced Aliens decided to take humans from various eras in human history and dump them together and see what happens, after removing any type of firearm and burning anyone who tries to violate said ban.\n\nFor a complete list of the books, see that other Wiki.\n\nA complete subculture has been spawned by these books, taking the philosophy of these books and applying them to their daily lives. This philosophy, known as the Gorean lifestyle, does not revolve around the master/slave relationship, although it certainly can incorporate it. There is some debate between practitioners of traditional BDSM and Gorean S&M about the validity and safety of the other's practices, most of it revolving around the fact that safewords are not mandatory.\n\nTwo films based on the Gor series were adapted into sword & sorcery films in the late Eighties, Gor (1987) and Outlaw of Gor (1989). Loosely adapted from the first two books, the films depict professor Tarl Cabots’ adventures after being magically transported to Gor. For better or worse, the films Bowdlerized the sex-slavery aspect. This is by no means the only instance of a movie bearing no resemblance (save a few names) to the book that supposedly inspired it, but it is a particularly egregious example from the word \"sorcery\" onwards.\n\nFor the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode Outlaw featuring the film Outlaw of Gor, please go to the episode recap page.\n\nThis work includes examples of:[]"
