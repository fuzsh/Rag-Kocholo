        "text": "The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty\n\nBy A. N. Roquelaure,\n\nFrom my list on kinky stories published before the internet was a thing.\n\nBy Candace Blevins Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am fifty-five years old, and I’ve been active in the BDSM lifestyle since my early twenties. My Safeword series was written because, at the time, most of the BDSM hitting the ebook market was clearly written by people who’d never felt the sting of a whip. I was certain I could do better, and eventually, after six attempts, I wrote something I thought a publisher might be interested in. Fifteen years later, I write mostly paranormal romance, but a fair amount of kink and power exchange still sneaks in. Vampires and werewolves aren’t known for submitting to others, after all.\n\nCandace's book list on kinky stories published before the internet was a thing\n\nWhy did Candace love this book?\n\nThe Beauty Series is actually three books, written as one long story: The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, Beauty's Punishment, Beauty's Release.\n\nWhen I read the books, sometime around 1989, I didn’t know Anne Rice had written them. I only knew this was proof that yet another person felt the same as me about sex.\n\nThese books aren’t written as consensual sex, but they’re pure fantasy, so it worked okay for me then and still does today.\n\nBy A. N. Roquelaure,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBefore E.L. James' Fifty Shades of Grey and Sylvia Day's Bared to You, there was Anne Rice's New York Times best seller The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty\n\nIn the traditional folktale of \"Sleeping Beauty,\" the spell cast upon the lovely young princess and everyone in her castle can only be broken by the kiss of a Prince. It is an ancient story, one that originally emerged from and still deeply disturbs the mind's unconscious. In the first book of the series, Anne Rice (author of Beauty's Kingdom), writing as A.N. Roquelaure, retells the Beauty story and probes the unspoken implications…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Story of O\n\nBy Pauline Reage,\n\nFrom my list on fiction novels that will make you believe they’re real.\n\nBy Kai Storm Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m Kai Storm, author of reality-based urban fiction and erotica, erotica blogger, YouTuber, and Podcaster. I love reading books that feel real, that make you feel, and that teach you something as they entertain you.\n\nKai's book list on fiction novels that will make you believe they’re real\n\nWhy did Kai love this book?\n\nThis book was given to me as a gift, and the lessons it taught me as I read those ancient pages.\n\nIt had me clutching my pearls, and it disgusted me at other parts, but at the same time, I wanted/needed to read that book in order to write a book in that style.\n\nBy Pauline Reage,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked The Story of O as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe classic French erotic bestseller that preceded Fifty Shades of Grey\n\nA beautiful young French woman, known only as 'O', is taken by her lover Rene to a splendid mansion near Paris.

My Safeword series was written because, at the time, most of the BDSM hitting the ebook market was clearly written by people who’d never felt the sting of a whip.

Fifteen years later, I write mostly paranormal romance, but a fair amount of kink and power exchange still sneaks in.

This was also my first introduction to M/m books, and I was hooked.\n\nBy John Preston,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Mr. Benson as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nMr. Benson is the compelling story of a young man’s quest for the perfect master. In a West Village leather bar, he finds wealthy, sophisticated, exacting Aristotle Benson, who leads him down the path of erotic enlightenment, teaching him to accept cruelty as love, anguish as affection, and ultimately, Mr. Benson as his master.\n\nIf John Preston, the masterly, handsome author of more than 30 books, was himself a gay icon, his character Mr. Benson defined the culture of gay sex for an entire generation. When Mr. Benson appeared in the pre-AIDS early 1980s, its unabashed celebration of male sexuality…\n\nPreview\n\nCarrie'S Story\n\nBy Molly Weatherfield,\n\nFrom my list on kinky stories published before the internet was a thing.\n\nBy Candace Blevins Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am fifty-five years old, and I’ve been active in the BDSM lifestyle since my early twenties.

Vampires and werewolves aren’t known for submitting to others, after all.\n\nCandace's book list on kinky stories published before the internet was a thing\n\nWhy did Candace love this book?\n\nI’m actually recommending two books here: Carrie's Story and Safe Word – a duet telling the full story.\n\nWhether these came before the internet was a “thing” is arguable, but they were certainly published before ebooks had a chance to change the publishing industry.\n\nThey are well written, and once again come clearly from someone who understands the lifestyle. These books are highly recommended, and come towards the end of my list mainly because I’m doing this (up to this point) chronologically.\n\nBy Molly Weatherfield,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Carrie'S Story as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nCarrie's Story is regarded as one of the finest erotic novels ever written- smart, devastatingly sexy and, at times, shocking, Molly Weatherfield has penned a book that is standing the test of time alongside The Story of O and Justine in this new era of \"BDSM romance,\" a la 50 Shades of Grey the whips and cuffs are out of the closet and \"chateau porn\" has given way to mommy porn. Carrie's Story remains at the head of the class, literally. Imagine The Story of O starring a Berkeley PhD candidate in comparative literature, who moonlights as a bike messenger,…\n\nPreview\n\nTo Command and Collar\n\nBy Cherise Sinclair,\n\nFrom my list on romance to set your body on flames.\n\nBy Karen Nappa Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nGrowing up as a single child in an abusive household my fantasy friends kept me sane. Today, my imaginary friends are hot alpha males and sassy heroines, and their stories are a bit (okay a lot!) spicier but still as engaging and always end happily ever after. Active in the BDSM Lifestyle, it pains me what kind of books are marketed as BDSM Romance. The key to a (loving) relationship based on power exchange is open communication and the will to help the other person grow and flourish. The books I write and the books I recommend are examples of what I consider goodreal BDSM Romance.\n\nKaren's book list on romance to set your body on flames\n\nWhy did Karen love this book?\n\nCherise Sinclair is my number one BDSM Romance author. The reason I love her books is their great storylines, relatable characters, and realistic but steamy sex, and BDSM scenes. To Command and Collar is book five in Master of the Shadowlands. Although I would advise to start reading the series from book one (Club Shadowlands), I chose book five because it is my favorite. I love Raoul and Kim and their hard-won journey to happiness.\n\nBy Cherise Sinclair,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked To Command and Collar as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n“Ms. Sinclair’s characters come alive on the page with passion and energy in a story that is absolutely riveting. “ ~ You Gotta Read Reviews\n\nWorking with the FBI to capture human traffickers, Master Raoul scores an invitation to a slave auction. To his surprise, one slave is the kidnapped friend of a Shadowlands submissive. Although Kim’s body is scarred, her spirit is unbroken, and he can't leave her behind. Ruining the FBI's plans, he buys her.\n\nKimberly's freedom has come at a devastating price: the other women are still imprisoned. Desperate to help the Feds locate the traffickers, she…\n\nPreview\n\nPlanet of Adventure\n\nBy Jack Vance,\n\nFrom my list on people with guts.\n\nBy Clemens P. Suter Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nClemens P. Suter is an author of adventure novels. His books deal with people that overcome impossible, life-changing situations. These are entertaining adventure books, with dystopian, post-apocalyptic, and Scifi elements.\n\nClemens' book list on people with guts\n\nWhy did Clemens love this book?\n\nVance is one of the best Sci-Fi authors of the twentieth century, although for a long time he wasn’t a household name in the genre. Over 70 years he has written an abundance of books, all of which focused on distant worlds and human societies that have differentiated into freedom-loving, anarchic and weird cultures. “Planet of Adventure” is a set of four books, and deals with Adam Reith, a single astronaut stranded on a planet ruled by four races of extraterrestrials. Humans are little more than slaves on this planet, and Adam needs all his wits to survive… and to find a way off the planet and back home. The book resembles a wild, expressionist painting; the extraterrestrials and their strange cultures and the humans that serve them provide the color and texture to a truly amazing adventure.\n\nBy Jack Vance,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Planet of Adventure as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nStranded on the distant planet Tschai, young Adam Reith is the sole survivor of a space mission who discovers the world is inhabited--not only by warring alien cultures, but human slaves as well, taken early in Earth's history. Reith must find a way off planet to warn the Earth of Tschai's deadly existence.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of baroque cities and haunted wastelands, sumptuous palaces and riotous inns, Reith will encounter deadly wastrels and murderous aliens, dastardly villains and conniving scoundrels.\n\nAnd always the random beauty in need of rescue...\n\nPreview\n\nMasters at Arms & Nobody's Angel\n\nBy Kallypso Masters,\n\nFrom my list on first books of great romance series.\n\nBy Marysol James Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m the best-selling romance author of 29 books which span six series. I love creating whole worlds for readers to enter and spend time with smoking-hot bodyguards, motorcycle club members, ex-military bad boys, sexy cowboys, and MMA fighters. Although I love pretty much everything about writing for a living, I do get special joy from having characters from one series wander into a different series and interact with a totally different group of people – keeping track of all the relationships definitely keeps me on my toes! I have three new books coming out this year, so I’m really looking forward to sharing some new stories with my wonderful readers.\n\nMarysol's book list on first books of great romance series\n\nWhy did Marysol love this book?\n\nWhile BDSM is not everybody’s cup of tea, curious readers might consider the Rescue Me saga an introduction to both the lifestyle and genre. The series highlights the key aspects of domination and submission, especially informed consent by all participants. It also grapples with the controversial question of whether a lifestyle that stresses clear rules, self-discipline, and absolute trust between Master and submissive can help heal survivors of trauma and abuse. Masters at Arms is a collection of short stories that introduces the male characters (they’re all ex-military and run a club/dungeon together) and Nobody’s Angel expands on Marc’s story. I read Masters’ saga when researching for my own books, and found it eye-opening and surprising in terms of the complexities of BDSM relationships.\n\nBy Kallypso Masters,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Masters at Arms & Nobody's Angel as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThree men.Three paths to recovery.One unbreakable bond.And one very hot club. …So begins the Rescue Me Saga in the Masters at Arms introduction.In Nobody’s Angel, private BDSM club co-owner Marc d’Alessio loves being in business with the men he served beside in the hell that was Iraq. Working at their club has its perks, but Marc keeps women at bay. He’s seen his fair share of danger, but women have proven to be hazardous to his heart.But when he saves Angelina Giardano from a disastrous first encounter at his club, he can’t shake the attraction and desire he feels for…\n\nPreview\n\nRed Night\n\nBy Kitty King,\n\nFrom my list on erotic romance to give you all the feels.\n\nBy Stella Grae Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve loved, I’ve lost, and everything in between! Just like my protagonist, Jenna, in Just Call Me Confidence, life imitated art and I took a page from her “book,” having to begin anew. I’ve been the friend who has entertained all sorts of stories—sex, love, and rock n’ roll (wink, wink)—all without judgment. That role in my life continues, and what I’ve discovered in my “research” is this: Sex is wonderful, but there’s no greater joy than loving someone, even if it’s only for a little while. Read more about my take on sex, love, and rock n’ roll on my blog “Bone Up.”\n\nStella's book list on erotic romance to give you all the feels\n\nWhy did Stella love this book?\n\nKitty King does not play when it comes to writing erotica. It’s dark AF, featuring domination/submission and BDSM.\n\nRed Night: Xavier’s Delight had more twists and turns than a mountain road, plus plenty of kinky sex. While I didn’t really like Xavier or his lover Marissa, their disturbing love dance left me wondering whether either one was a redeemable character.\n\nWhat intrigued me the most was their codependent/narcissistic love affair—degrading, terrifying, and loving. I wasn’t sure whether to root for Marissa’s honesty to self and her eventual realization of Xavier’s motivation, or Xavier’s hot-and-cold nature. His impressively-described tool helped keep this reader attached to the story (just sayin’…).\n\nThe brilliance of this dark erotic piece: a sexy dichotomy between wanting what is safe and wanting what might destroy you.\n\nBy Kitty King,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Red Night as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nPreview\n\nY is for Yes\n\nBy J.R. Vincente,\n\nWhy did J love this book?\n\nThis is an erotica book. It dives right in with the heat. There's a mystery element snaked between all the hot and heavy steam. Yvonne is inexperienced at first, but there are a plethora of kinks by the end. Recommended for readers looking to learn more about the BDSM lifestyle, as well as to those with kinky experiences. Consent matters in this book, and all the hot scenes have only consensual adults.\n\nLike any good romance, there's a happily-ever-after. The mystery creates a high-action scene. Y is for Yes, like a rollercoaster, is fast-paced with excellent twists and lots of fun. J.R. Vincente has a distinct, enjoyable voice.\n\nBy J.R. Vincente,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Y is for Yes as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA chance encounter after hours at her new office job ropes Yvonne into a world of BDSM and exploration she never imagined. Join Yvonne on her adventure to ditch the business suits for lingerie in Y is for Yes by J. R. Vincente.\n\nPreview"
