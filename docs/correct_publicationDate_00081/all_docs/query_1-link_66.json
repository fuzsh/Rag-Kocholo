        "text": "Happy Birthday, John Norman, born 3 June 1931.\n\nQuotes\n\nThe series is constructed in a rather Ptolemaic manner, namely, in terms of a great cycle associated with its epicycles. In short, each book, though complete within itself, should advance the series as a whole.\n\nI do not know what will happen in the series. The books have not yet told me.\n\nWomen are wonderful, different, and unique. I think rather than a single ideal there would be a thousand ideals, and, perhaps, one for each woman.\n\nThere are, incidentally, various reasons for using the ‘John Norman’ name. Most obviously, it separates fiction from nonfiction, from, say, scholarly books, articles, and such. As considerable differences between these sorts of writing are involved, that seems a good idea. Pretty clearly science-fiction writing, or adventure-fantasy writing, is one thing, and academic writing is another. The worlds are quite different, at least allegedly. A minor reason is that it seems very few people can pronounce ‘Lange’, but almost everyone I have met is really good at pronouncing ‘Norman’.\n\nThe books pretty much write themselves. They do what they want. Who am I to object? Sometimes I am surprised, and, as mentioned, grateful.\n\nJohn Norman is the pen name of John Frederick Lange Jr. He is the American author of the Gor series of fantasy novels, which began with Tarnsman of Gor. Thee Gorean Saga is the longest-running series of adventure novels in science fiction history. He is also a professor of philosophy.\n\nSource for quotes\n\nby Amanda Patterson\n\nPlease click here for our Literary Birthday Calendar\n\nPosted on: 2nd June 2020\n\n(3,540 views)"
