        "text": "I read the first book in the 70's - I was addicted. From that point on I bought every book of this series I could find. I only hope that the entire series of books will be made into audio books. I would highly recommend at least purchasing the first in the series. The series does reference back to previous adventures and brings characters created in earlier novels back for their own story. You feel a sense of an ongoing adventure throughout Tarl's life You will be suprised how dynamic the world created by John Norman can be.\n\nThe Tarnsman of Gor is so close to being a good book. Itâs got a lot of lore bits of a great fantasy adventure pocketed along the book with great world building. Then the author drops all of that to focus on a terribly toxic relationship about a dunce warrior and some unlikeable tart.\n\nThis woman literally has tried to kill the main character at least four times. The nitwit of the main character doesnât take the hint and, to my dismay, proclaims his love to this villainess. Her obvious hints of No are lost before succumbing to a Poochy like Stockholm syndrome in this half-perverted bondage/slavery chapter that pulls you out of the story entirely.\n\nThe author also loves inserting bondage to a frighteningly degree, where the story oscillates of having the dimwit main character fighting monsters to being captured in the dumbest way possible. It happens FOUR TIMES IN THIS BOOK. This is a writing crutch that John Norman canât seem to rid himself of.\n\nTwo out of Five stars. I was promised by a friend that this story was on par of the stories of Conan the Barbarian, but I was given Fifty shades of Tarlena."
