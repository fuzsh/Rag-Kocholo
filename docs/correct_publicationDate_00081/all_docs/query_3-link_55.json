        "text": "Gor is a series of science fiction/fantasy novels by American novelist John Norman. The series includes heavy doses of philosophy and erotica as well. Gor is located in a parallel universe and ruled by a species of insectoids known as the Priest-Kings. The Priest-Kings have transplanted various Earth cultures (including Romans, Vikings, etc) onto Gor, along with the various indigenous species. The main character of the series is Tarl Cabot, a British professor and expert swordsman who interacts with all of the various beings. The series has even inspired its own subculture based on the novels that is both practiced online and in real life.\n\nJohn Norman began his Gor series in 1966 with his own debut novel, Tarnsman of Gor. The series includes over 30 novels and is currently ongoing. The series is also known as the Gorean Saga, the Chronicles of Gor, the Tarl Cabot Saga and the Chronicles of Counter-Earth. Below is a list of John Norman’s Gor books in order of when they were originally released (which is the same as their chronological order):\n\nPublication Order of Gor Books\n\nIf You Like Gorean Saga Books, You’ll Love…\n\nConan The Barbarian\n\nJohn Carter of Mars\n\nXanth\n\nGor Synopsis: In Tarnsman of Gor by John Norman, Tarl Cabot has always thought of himself as a citizen of Earth with his destiny lies on a planet far away from Earth.
