        "text": "I've added a couple of things to this page. One being the Snore Meter Rating. I thought of giving a rating of 1-10 on the books, based on the level of sleep-inducement each book provides. However, upon debating this, that scale was far too broad, and so I developed a scale of 1-5 instead. The Snore Meter Rating is as follows:\n\n1 — Super Sleeper; Put Away Those Sleeping Pills and Just Read\n\n2 — Mild Sedative; Better Than Counting Sheep\n\n3 — Ehhhhh\n\n4 — Mildly Entertaining\n\n5 — Has Great Moments\n\nSecondly, after the narrative of each book, taken from the books themselves, I offer my own commentary about each book. Opinions are strictly my own personal views, therefore, if you don't like what you are reading — then don't.\n\nThirdly, because of the differences in publishing the books, depending upon whether published in the U.S. or Europe, page numbers will often vary. All of my quotes are from U.S. publications. I have indicated the publication dates of the books I own and have utilized in my pages in this green color.\n\nSpecial Note\n\nBecause of the differences in publishing the books, depending upon whether published in the U.S. or Europe, depending upon whether a first publishing or a Masquerade Books release, page numbers will often vary. All of my quotes are from original, first-printing U.S. publications (see The Books page for a listing of publishers and dates) with the exception of the following books:\n\nTarnsman of Gor (2nd Printing, Balantine)\n\nOutlaw of Gor (11th Printing, Balantine)\n\nPriest-Kings of Gor (2nd Printing, Balantine)\n\nAssassin of Gor (10th Printing, Balantine)\n\nRaiders of Gor (15th Printing, Balantine)\n\nCaptive of Gor (3rd Printing, Balantine)\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThese pages are not written for any specific home, but rather as informational pages for those not able to get ahold of the books and read them yourself. Opinions and commentaries are strictly my own personal views, therefore, if you don't like what you are reading — then don't. The information in these pages is realistic to what is found within the books. Many sites have added information, assuming the existences of certain products and practices, such as willowbark and agrimony for healing, and travel to earth and back for the collection of goods. I've explored the books, the flora, the fauna, and the beasts, and have compiled from those mentioned, the probabilities of certain practices, and what vegetation mentioned in the books is suitable for healing purposes, as well as given practicalities to other sorts of roleplaying assumptions."
