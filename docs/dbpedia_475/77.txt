Caption: âWhen the vermin are dead, the German oak will flourish once more.â (December 1927)

Explanation: A Nazi is pumping poison gas into the base of a tree, with dead rats representing Jews around the tree. The rats are labelled âstock exchanges,â âthe press,â and âtrusts.â The branches of the tree, labeled âGermany,â are industry, agriculture, commerce, the arts, business, the sciences, social welfare, civil service, and workers. This is the earliest Nazi image I know of that suggests poison gas as a way of killing Jews, although Hitler makes a reference to that possibility in Mein Kampf.

Title: âGerman Christmasâ

Caption: The German Christmas angel has her hands tied by the swindling world bank Jews. Meanwhile, the department store Jew, behind the mask of Christmas cheer, is doing a booming business. (December 1928)

Explanation: The angel is bound by bands named taxes, credit stops, Dawes tribute and Lugano. The Jew is selling beauty creams and pornographic books.

Title: âThe day of revenge is comingâ

Explanation: A father holds his bleeding son, run over by a car full of careless Jews. This plays on both the charge that Jews were rich and Germans poor, and that Jews cared not at all for the harm they were doing to Germany. (#29/1929)

Caption: âOne can do anything to those Goyim. Our people crucified their Christ on the cross, and we do a great business on his birthday....â

Explanation: A Christmas cartoon urging Germans to avoid Jewish shops was standard. (#51/1929)

Title: âThe wormâ

Caption: âWhere something is rotten, the Jew is the cause.â

Explanation: The names in the background are those of Jews involved in major financial scandals. The apple is named âthe German economy.â The worm is named âJewish scandals.â (November 1931)
