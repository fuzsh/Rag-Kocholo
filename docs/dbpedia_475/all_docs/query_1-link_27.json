        "text": "So you’re in love or really like a German-speaking person. That’s wonderful! When you’re in a romantic relationship or want to start one with German speakers, they’ll be impressed if you learned love words and phrases in German.\n\nWe’re going to guide you through sweet words and romantic phrases and give you some German quotes to sound just like native speakers.\n\nFirstly starting with a relationship with pick-up lines in German. Then we’ll move on to love words and romantic German phrases and teach you German language pet names to use when you’re in a serious relationship.\n\nAfter that, we’ll move on to how to propose in German and give you some love quotes that you can use well into your relationship’s future.\n\nReady for love? Let’s go!\n\nPick-Up Lines In German\n\nAlright, so picking up someone is never easy and takes courage. You’ll feel far more confident if you know how to introduce yourself and make your person of interest smile.\n\nHere are some popular pick-up lines to help you when meeting someone special and possibly arranging a date. You can also use these terms on social media or dating apps when you DM someone.\n\nHere are some phrases to use after your date! It’s always nice to end positively and hopefully get a second date.\n\nHow Do You Express Your Love In German?\n\nWhen things get more serious between you, these are some romantic phrases in German to express your feelings.\n\nYou can also use these German love words in greeting cards on special occasions for your loved one, and some of these are great for German family members too! They are great for birthdays, Mother’s Day, or Father’s Day.\n\nI Love You\n\nIch liebe dich\n\nThis classic saying is most appropriate for serious, long-term relationships or family members.\n\nI Love You Too\n\nIch liebe dich auch\n\nWhen someone else says, “I love you,” this is the perfect way to respond. Of course, only use this phrase if you feel the same way!\n\nI’m In Love With You\n\nIch bin in dich verliebt\n\nThis is an excellent way to tell someone you’re in love with them without dropping the “I love you” bomb. It can give your partner a big clue about how you feel about them without any obligations to respond.\n\nLove Ya\n\nIch hab’ dich lieb\n\nYou can use this phrase for friends and family. It’s a light-hearted saying to use with anyone you care about at the end of a phone call or text message.\n\nI Am Head Over Heels In Love (With You)\n\nIch bin Hals über Kopf (in dich) verliebt\n\nYou could use this saying to tell your friends how you’re feeling about a special someone, and you can add, ‘with you (in dich)’ if you wish to say this to your loved one.\n\nYou’re My Everything\n\nDu bist mein Ein und Alles\n\nIn the English equivalent, this saying can mean both “You’re my everything” and “You mean the world to me.” It’s quite a romantic phrase and could be used when you are deep and heavy in love.\n\nI Like You\n\nIch steh’ auf dich\n\nMaybe you’re not ready to say the big L word, or you’re unsure how the other person feels, so you can say that you like them. It also means, “I’m into you.”\n\nMy Heart Is All Yours\n\nDir gehört mein ganzes Herz\n\nAgain, a powerful romantic connotation. You should reserve this phrase for when things are very serious. This deeply romantic phrase would go great on a Valentine’s Day card too!\n\nYou Are The Love Of My Life\n\nDu bist die Liebe meines Lebens\n\nThis saying is a special one. You shouldn’t say it unless you mean it. It leads one to think that you’re close to proposing or that a marriage is on your mind!\n\nIf you’re feeling this way but are slightly nervous about expressing it, try the German love phrase below, which is a little less weighty.\n\nI Adore You\n\nIch bete dich an\n\nYou could even use this phrase with close friends!\n\nYou Suit Me/ We Go Well Together\n\nDu passt zu mir. / Wir passen gut zusammen\n\nYou can use this phrase after a first or second date if you feel a connection. It’s an excellent way to imply that you’d like your relationship to grow into something more.\n\nI Care For You\n\nIch habe dich gerne\n\nAs with the phrase above, you’d use this saying after a date or two to let the person know you’re really interested in them.\n\nWill You Go Out With Me?\n\nWillst du mit mir ausgehen?\n\nOf course, you can’t get a date if you don’t ask! This is the best question to get that first date.\n\nLove Words And Phrases In German: Pet Names For Both Sexes\n\nOnce you’ve begun dating someone, you may naturally have pet names for each other. These are the most common pet names that you can use with men and women.\n\nGerman Pet Names For Boyfriends\n\nA pet name like the ones below are typically reserved for men.\n\nGerman Pet Names For Girlfriends\n\nYou’d usually use a pet name like these for female lovers.\n\nHow To Propose In German\n\nSo you’ve been in a romantic relationship for a while now, or maybe you know they are the right person for you right away! You’ve got a ring, and you’re ready to propose.\n\nIt is a big step, and there are quite a few ways to ask someone for their hand in marriage in German.\n\nHave a look and see which ‘love language’ will be the best for you. Remember that in Germany, people appreciate directness, especially in cases such as proposals! Be straight to the point.\n\nWill you marry me?\n\nWillst du mich heiraten?\n\nWillst du meine Frau werden?\n\nWill you be my wife?\n\nWillst du mein Mann werden?\n\nWill you be my husband?\n\nIch will, dass du mein/e Mann / Frau wirst.\n\nI want you to be my husband / wife.\n\nIch möchte den Rest meines Lebens mit dir verbringen.\n\nI want to spend the rest of my life with you.\n\nIch möchte mit dir Enkelkinder haben.\n\nI want to have grandchildren with you.\n\nIch will für immer mit dir zusammen sein.\n\nI want to be with you forever.\n\nGerman Love Quotes\n\nOver time, these can be sweet messages you leave on notes, text messages, or unique cards for your loved one.\n\nLove conquers all.\n\nLiebe überwindet alles.\n\nLove is blind.\n\nLiebe ist blind.\n\nWhen you sow love, joy will grow.\n\nWo man Liebe sät, da wächst Freude.\n\nOpposites attract.\n\nGegensätze ziehen sich an.\n\nI will love you forever and always.\n\nIch werde dich für immer und ewig lieben.\n\nKeep Learning German By Using The Ling App\n\nLearning love words and phrases in German is just the first step.
