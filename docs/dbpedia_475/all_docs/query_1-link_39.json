        "text": "While action may define the outcome of war, there is no doubt that rousing speeches and witty lines can sometimes be the right tool for the job. Words have the ability to inspire a single person or resonate through the world. We’ve compiled a list of some of the quotes that we believe capture the spirit of the Second World War.\n\nWinston Churchill\n\nOne of Winston Churchill’s most famous speeches, which he delivered to the House of Commons on June 4, 1940. An interesting fact about the speech was that from the beginning “We shall fight on the beaches...” and ending “… we shall never surrender”, consists of words derived from Old English (Anglo-Saxon). The only exception is the word “surrender”, which is derived from Old French.\n\nField Marshall Erwin Rommel\n\nGöring\n\nField Marshall Erwin Rommel\n\nAllegedly attributed to Rommel regarding the Second Battle of El Alamein, he briefed Hitler on his attack at Alam el Halfa and why it failed. Rommel stressed the superiority of the British Air Force, which is why Göring brought up the question.\n\nBenito Mussolini—to his son-in-law, June 10, 1941\n\nFrom 1941, Mussolini and Italian Forces had begun suffering defeats, such as being overwhelmed at the Battle of Keren, with a final defeat happening at the Battle of Gondar. Mussolini and Hitler’s political relationship may have been deteriorating in the lead up to Operation Barbarossa, where the latter asked the former not to involve himself.\n\n“\n\nAdolf Hitler—August, 1944\n\nAround mid-August, the ceasefire in Paris had collapsed and fighting had resumed. French Forces of the Interior were busy erecting barricades in the streets of the city to hold back German reinforcements. Choltitz, the last commander of Nazi-occupied Paris, was given the demand by Hitler in Berlin, but ultimately ignored it.\n\nEmperor Hirohito of Japan, April 29, 1942\n\nJapan scored a series of naval victories, including the Battle of Singapore in the South-East Asia Theatre, leading to the surrender of about 130,000 Indian, British, Australian and Dutch personnel. In March 1942, Japanese forces were attacked in Northern Burma by the Chinese Expeditionary Force, encircling 7,000 British soldiers.\n\nAnonymous\n\nThis was, supposedly, a common complaint of British people, as American troops were shipped to Britain to prepare for the invasion of German-occupied Europe. The first GIs landed in Britain in 1942, bringing Coca-Cola, cigarettes and nylon. Despite the quote, around 70,000 women became GI brides.\n\nTomb of the Unknown Soldier (Moscow)\n\nThe Tomb of the Unknown Solider is dedicated to Soviet soldiers lost during World War II. It is located at the Kremlin Wall in the Alexander Garden in Moscow. In front of the monument there is a five-pointed star in a square field of labradorite, with an Eternal Flame at its center. This flame illuminates a bronze inscription with the quote above.\n\nWartime propaganda slogan\n\nThis phrase, created by the War Advertising Council, originated on wartime propaganda posters during World War II. It was used on posters by the United States Office of War Information. The most famous poster featuring the phrase was created for the Seagram Distillers Corporation, by the designer Seymour R. Goff.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, March 4, 1933—Inaugural address\n\nSaid during the first inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt as the 32nd President of the United States. Roosevelt swore in on his family Bible, open to Corinthians 13, which, published in 1686, was the oldest Bible ever used in an inaugural ceremony. His speech lasted 20 minutes and was 1,883 words.\n\nField Marshal Lord Montgomery on Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\nA senior officer of the British Army, Montgomery may have referred to Eisenhower this way because, at the time, the war effort was in need of hardened generals. The man himself first saw action in World War I. He commanded the British Eighth Army from August 1942 in the Western Desert until the final Allied victory in Tunisia.\n\nGeneral George Patton\n\nWhile Patton has a…choice number of quotes to his name, this is short, sweet and to the point. The man was best known for his leadership of the Third United States Army in France and Germany following the Allied invasion of Normandy. Though often vulgar in his speeches, his charisma and ability to lead from the front inspired all those under him, and he was regarded highly by those in German High Command."
