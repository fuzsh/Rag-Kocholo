        "text": "English Romantics: John Constable\n\nJoseph Turner\n\nFrench Realists: Gustave Courbet\n\nHonore Daumier\n\nThe Pre-Impressionists helped kick-start the Impressionistic Revolution. Paris and France were the centre for Art – the Academie – in the first half of the 19th Century. They had a recipe for what was successful as good art (as did London’s Royal Academy). It had to have a moral or religious theme, and a high degree of technical skill, with a finish to the surface so that no brushstrokes showed.\n\nThe Council of the Royal Academy (London) Selecting Pictures for the Exhibition\n\nby Charles West Cope\n\nPaintings were filled with idealised figures of perfect men and women, usually representing Gods. The artists used tonal under-painting in Sepia, then added glazes of colour over the top. The result was of subtle tones and muted hues. The paintings had to be huge in size, and were mostly hung in galleries, museums, or the homes of the rich. Also they were mostly narrative in content.\n\nUnderpainting; Portrait of Clara Serena Rubens – Peter Paul Rubens\n\nWith the coming of the Industrial Revolution attitudes began changing. In England John Constable and Joseph Turner began to concentrate on landscape painting. Using the new portable oils, Constable made quick oil sketches on location, capturing the light and atmosphere by using flecks of pure white paint and touches of red. He took these sketches back to his studio where he then produced the finished painting, which, while being more subdued and smoother in texture than the sketch, still retained the atmospheric light of the latter. He created the physical sensation of nature, and used pure colour throughout the painting – this appealed to the Impressionists, who adopted it.\n\nThe Hay Wain – 1821 – Constable\n\nJoseph Turner was taken by the different moods of light, and atmosphere – cold, warm, or misty – he was interested in the emotional side of light, rather than the scientific side. Although he often obscured the subject matter of his works with mist – e.g. Venice paintings – they were correct, and never dull. There was no sombreness in his paintings, and his clever emotional approach to atmospherics was picked up by the revolutionists.\n\nThe Dogano, San Giorgio, Citella from the Steps – Turner\n\nIn France, Gustave Courbet and Honore Daumier were Realists. They were concerned with the subject matter, and made socially realistic comments about the changes in society. There was now not so vast a difference between the rich and poor classes, with a growing middle class, and with the advent of a leisure day on Sunday. They accepted the code of the Acadamie but deviated in subject matter – they saw working class people rather than Gods and Goddesses, and depicted these at work and during their times of leisure.\n\nThe Stonebreakers – Courbet\n\nGustave Courbet depicted Realism minus the religious ideals, painting ugly people, with bulging hips and work-worn hands – peasants as they really looked, people warts and all. This was considered revolutionary. His palette was subdued and his technique traditional. He made no statement himself – just asked people to look at the painting and relate it to the realities of life. This was adopted by the revolutionists.\n\nMeeting of thirty-five heads of expression – Daumier\n\nHonore Daumier used an intelligent approach to art, presenting the facts as he saw them, with no ideals or sentimentality. He showed the underlying character of the subject – types of people such as farmers, peasants, factory workers. He was labelled a characaturist, was a superb draftsman, and used exaggeration to punctuate the statement. The revolutionists took his honesty.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ARTIST – EDOUARD MANET.\n\nHe was the last great realist and the first Impressionist, although he never aligned himself with them. His works of 1850 – 1870 linked the standards of the old with the new. They were so academic and perfect in their presentation, yet at the same time were totally impressionistic in style. He wanted to be accepted by the Salon but his own style took him away. He often took the subject matter from the establish art, but made them his own. The best example of this is the painting LUNCHEON ON THE GRASS which he based on THE JUDGEMENT OF PARIS, but clothed the men in contemporary attire, while their naked female companion was a known lady of the street.\n\nLuncheon on the Grass – Manet\n\nHe said, “You’ve got to belong to your own period and paint what you see.”\n\nHe had to be a modern artist, and was always an individual. He was influenced by the old masters – Rembrandt, Raphael, etc. He learnt from his contemporaries, but never considered himself one of them. Although he re-did classical themes in a modern style, he was not accepted by the Salon.\n\nLe Printemps 1881 – Manet\n\nHe used bold colourful hues, economy of detail – simplistic – created the idea of a pattern rather than the volume of the figure in space. He flattened out with broad areas of colour, allowing brushstrokes to show. He used light against dark contrast – as did Goya – he used black as a colour, rather than as aid to creating tone. His works showed an understanding and appreciation of Impressionism, and he could be said to be the father of Impressionism – although he would not have agreed. He was unique.\n\nNB: If you choose to use this blog as a direct source, please quote and cite the website’s URL as reference.\n\n(C) Jud House 7/09/2016\n\n. . . . .\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAs a result of the Impressionistic revolution before them, both Cezanne and Van Gogh were freed from constraints to follow the characteristics of Impressionism that appealed to them – the use and development of colour and the structural planes for Cezanne, and the use of colour and brushstrokes for Van Gogh.\n\nWheat Field with Crows – 1890 – Vincent Van Gogh\n\nPaul Cezanne, considered the father of modern art, wanted to see the world objectively, and endeavoured to present a 3 dimensional reality on a 2 dimensional plane. He “was more interested in the structural or formal aspects of painting than in its ability to convey emotions.” (Artforms, Preble, p. 363) He achieved this by reducing nature to 3D shapes – the cone, cylinder, and cube – then reducing those to slabs of colour to suggest a slice of volume, with the warm colours advancing and the cool colours receding. He also used multiple points of view on the same picture plane, to lead the viewer’s eye around the composition to perceive the volume. He created a compressed space, with the sense of the underlying structure and solidity of the subject – which was primarily still lifes, and landscapes.\n\nGinger Pot with Pomegranate and Pears – 11890-93 – Oil on canvas.\n\nIn the above painting, GINGER POT WITH POMEGRANATE AND PEARS, Cezanne, after painstakingly placing the fruit to resemble a spontaneously pleasing effect, painted them using warm and cool, primary and contrasting colours in juxtaposition. Thus he created a vibrant image of advancing and receding areas in a compressed space – a cool green pear, placed in front of a warm red apple, stops the latter’s advancement, while the contrasting nature of their colours (complimentary – opposites on the colour wheel) vibrates against each other. He used orange and blue throughout the composition in the same way, and has used different viewpoints for the table and the ginger pot.\n\nGreen Futera – Braque; La Reve – Picasso 1932\n\n“Cezanne’s open brush strokes and his concept of a geometric sub-structure in nature and art” (ibid. p. 363) led to the development, by Braque and Picasso, of Cubism. For this they rejected emotions even more than Cezanne had done, and developed the compression of space until they had created flat, ambiguous space; they manipulated viewpoints further to create a Simultaneity by viewing the subject from all points simultaneously; and they developed Cezanne’s cubic volumes into planes that formed an interwoven pattern that merged the subject with the background.\n\nFrom this developed Formal Abstraction in the forms of De Stijl (The Style) with Piet Mondrian, Suprematism with Kazimir Malevich, and Constructivism with Gabo. These were the further development of colour, line and shape, devoid of aesthetic content – very precise, hard edged, impersonal, geometric, non-figurative and depending on the control of the elements of form.\n\nSquare 111 – Mondrian; White on White – Malevich; Constructed Torso – Gabo\n\nIn De Stijl, Mondrian created works using the primary colours, and vertical and horizontal lines to create balanced patterns representing purity. In the above painting, he included warm and cool whites, adding an advancing and receding element to his pattern. Malevich pushed Cezanne’s theory of advancing and receding colours to extremes painting cool white on warm white as an example of Suprematism. He also manipulated scale and position on the canvas to create space, and diagonal lines to create movement. Gabo took the ideas of the Suprematists and used them to create ‘constructed’ works of Sculpture and Collage. In his use of planes, geometric shapes, line and occasionally colour, his works show a direct link back to Cezanne’s original ideas of cubic volume, compressed space, and colour theories. Hi works were known as Constructivism.\n\nVincent Van Gogh was also fascinated by the use of the brilliant pure colour, straight from tubes onto white canvas on location, and allowing the brush strokes to show, that the Impressionists were encouraging. he developed these characteristics during his short life, until his works resembled swirling masses of bright paint. he worked quickly, spontaneously, emotionally, expressively – his “textural brushwork …[giving] an overall rhythmic movement to some of his paintings.” (ibid, p. 365)\n\nEntrance to the Public Gardens in Arles – 1888 – Van Gogh\n\nHe began to use colour arbitrarily, using the contrasting orange and blue together frequently, as he did in ENTRANCE TO THE PUBLIC GARDENS IN ARLES painted in 1888, two years before his death. The paint was applied thickly in pure colour, to give an intensity and light to his work, with the relatively flat area of the path showing purple and mauve layed on amongst the yellow to give shadows, and the thickness of the paint textured by his brushwork. He depicted everyday scenes, as had Daumier, preferring to paint his own direct neighbourhood; and the fields around Arles if he went into the countryside. In the above painting he used scale manipulation to give depth, but this was still compressed space due to the intensity of the background colours. His heavy brush strokes in the foliage give a feeling of movement to the work. His figures were outlined with strong contour lines, coloured in, creating flat patterns in the style of the Japanese prints that impressed him.\n\nWoman in Purple Coat – Matisse; The Bridge – Derain; The Blue House – Vlaminck\n\nFauvism, with its freedom of expression and use of vibrant, often clashing colour for its own sake, developed from Van Gogh’s style. Henri Matisse, Andre Derain and Maurice De Vlaminck used colour arbitrarily, expressively rather than descriptively, using strong brush strokes and contour lines to create patterns and designs. Also as precursors of German Expressionism, were Munch and Ensor, established artists in the late 19th century, already Munch using swirling lines, Ensor using Brush strokes and texture, and both using clashing colour. From this developed Expressionism.\n\nAutumn II – Kandinsky; Red Balloon 1922 – Klee; The Blue Horse – Marc\n\nThe Blue Rider group of German Expressionists followed: Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, and Franz Marc. These artists created non-figurative non-representational abstract works, with the emphasis on colour and its psychological affect on people, and its link to music. Kandinsky created Abstract Expressionism using colour and line furiously. The Bridge group of German Expressionists endeavoured to bring their German origins out in their work, but really bridged the gap between all the art occurring in Europe at the time. They used broad flat areas of colour, and colour for symbolic content.\n\nThus from Cezanne developed Cubism, De Stijl, Suprematism, and Constructivism – Formal Abstraction; while from Van Gogh developed Fauvism, German Expressionism (Precursors, the Blue Rider, and The Bridge), and Abstract Expressionism.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY:\n\nARTFORMS.

There are underlying triangular shapes throughout, between the road and the tree on the left; the road and the viaduct; and the mountain shape. The visible shapes are also geometric, with organic the fields broken into geometric planes. There is repetition of line: in the parallel lines in the fields echoing the road; and the branches that follow the contour of the mountain – and of shape: in the cubic house shapes sprinkled throughout the composition.\n\nThe colours are basically analogous (yellow and green), slightly descriptive, bold and intense, forming a pattern of warm and cool colours across the landscape, creating a fragmented image. The eye is led along the road to stop at the dominant building on the left, then jumps across the patchwork to the viaduct, before moving up to the mountain itself. It has implied texture in some areas, a high view point, compressed space (the line along the edge of the mountain is as strong as the lines in the foreground), with multiple areas of dominance,despite the initial focussing of the eye the the more flatly painted centre of the canvas.\n\nThe artistic revolutionary characteristics of this work are the use of bold pure colour, painted onto a white canvas, with the brushstrokes showing clearly, and contour lines evident. It was painted out of doors, spontaneously, with the scene of no religious or moral significance a happy landscape painted for its own beauty. A visually stimulating painting, using broken colour technique in some areas, and painted with square brushes.\n\nThe characteristics which make it a recognizable Cezanne are mainly the way the image has been broken into geometric planes, and shapes, and the way in which the artist used warm and cool colours in juxtaposition to create a sensation of movement or undulation by their advancing and receding nature. He used warm intense orange, cooling it as he moved progressively higher on the picture plane. The mountain not only has cool blues and mauves, but also touches of this cooler orange – less intense – giving the visual perception of distance by its cool quality.\n\nAlso the subject matter is one of Cezanne’s favourites – Mont Sainte-Victoire near his brother-in-law’s home south-west of Aix. Paul Cezanne is reported as saying about this location:\n\n“The blue smell of the pines must be married to the green smell of the plains which are refreshed every morning with the smell of stones and the perfume of distant marble from Sainte-Victoire.”\n\nBy his use of textural brushstrokes around the outer edge of the painting, Cezanne created a focal area of the untidy jumble of fields, and sheds, which he painted with a flatter technique that still showed planes or slabs of colour laid next to each other. His later works show an even greater reduction of the image into a pattern of planes, than this work portrays.\n\n1902 -04 Mont Sainte-Victoire 1904-06\n\nNB: The thing that is interesting about this analytical evaluation of these 19th & 20th century artists and their works, is the realisation of how much today’s artists owe them for breaking down the barriers that controlled all art prior to their artistic revolution. It does, of course, also make us look at other artworks differently, with more awareness of the underlying structures and techniques used, enhancing our appreciation of them\n\nJud House 5/09/2016\n\n. . . . .\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis is a way of communicating through a visual image, as is drawing. The latter includes pastel, charcoal, water-colour, and pencils, and can be calligraphic, a quick or detailed sketch, or a drawing in the sand with a stick.\n\nCave paintings – Lascaux\n\nPainting can be merely an example of visualising theories and techniques, as Seurat did with the theories of Optical Colour Mixing, or can be very personal and emotional. It can also be a form of recording history – from the earliest efforts of the cavemen, who painted pictures on the walls of their caves of the animals of the region, for either ritualistic, magical or religious reasons, to paintings of the horrors of the Vietnam War.\n\nAncient Mayan Fresco\n\nPaintings were created to depict the events and the social conditions of the Mesapotamians, the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Incan and Mayan people – often as wall murals or carved edifices. Then paintings became portable with the creation of icons during the Dark ages, for religious purposes of course. In the Middle Ages paintings were still portable, e.g. psalters, as well as being painted on walls as frescos. They were also on wooden or canvas panels – or on paper as prints became available – which could be hung in the homes, instead of only in palaces or buildings of importance.\n\nPaintings reflected the tribe mentality in Ancient times with the kings communicating and being interchangeable with the Gods. In the Dark Ages the nature worship developed into Christian ideas, with saints and martyrs, and people living close to death all their lives. This permeated their art which was oppressive.\n\nRaphael – School of Athens\n\nThe Renaissance recalled the idealism of the Greeks and Romans, and saw the development of scientific discoveries and mathematical formulas which were used in art as linear perspective. They were also able to create a sense of real depth through the use of atmospheric perspective – their paintings created as a ‘window on the world’, depicting implied textures and volume, and humanism to the figures. The 15th and 16th centuries were of ‘man the thinking man’ – humanism. the 17th century shows the age of plenty, materialism, with still life paintings.\n\nSalisbury Cathedral from the Meadows – Constable\n\nThe 18th Century showed idealism and romanticism, with the use of rococo style of over-embellishment, portraying only important people and places. The 19th century was the industrial revolution and depicted the squalor of this time, with human life held cheap. Social Realist paintings showed this.\n\nPicasso – Brick Factory as Tortosa; & Seated Woman (Simultaneity)\n\nThe 20th century saw the development of Cubism and Surrealism – breaking the ‘window on the world’, and expressing a different reality – that of art as technological changes affected it. The ambiguity of our life is reflected through our art, and the way we use such diversity of media to portray it. Picasso pushed Cubism further to create Simultaneity – showing all sides of the image at the same time. The Surrealists based their work on psychi – art has become very literary, and verbal.\n\nMondrian; Pollock\n\nThe 21st century has seen continual development, and stretching of already flexible boundaries within and between each Postmodern and Contemporary artistic genre, portraying the Astronomical reality, scientific advancements, and the turmoil between global cultures that exemplify our current world. There are no limits on the multi-use of Media in the creation of our art.\n\nIan McKellan; Alan Cummings – by Christian Hook\n\nPAINTING MEDIUMS:\n\nPIGMENT is the colouring agent, originally in powdered form from nature – stone chalk, earth, plants, bark – late 19th century psynthetic pigments were chemically produced in tubes, giving practical and portable usage. Impressionists were able to take them into the fields (au Plein Air) to paint.\n\nBINDER in the tubes of paint is already combined – for oils it is linseed oil; for acrylics it is acrylic polymer; for tempura it is egg yolk; for encaustic it is beeswax; and for fresco work it is lime in the plaster. A Mural is ON the wall; a Fresco is PART OF the wall.\n\nDispensing Agent: thins and waters the medium to make it malleable. For acrylic and tempura it is water, and for oil it is turps, or citrus fluid.\n\nSizing: is used to make the surface non-porous – often a glue-form, e.g. Bondcrete. GESSO is glue mixed with chalk and plaster. AQUAHERE dries clear and can be built up to create an Impasto affect. There are now many products available if your canvases are not pre-Sized.\n\nPAINTING DEFINITIONS:\n\nWASH is a thin transparent coating of pigment – using water or turps depending on whether acrylic, watercolour or oil.\n\nGLAZE is the same, but has the oil thinned with linseed oil, or the acrylic mixed with medium.\n\nIMPASTO is thickly applied paint, often applied with a palette knife – acrylics are mixed with an impasto medium, while oils are used neat.\n\nMATT is a dull finish to the painting, naturally occurring in tempura, and if too much turps is used in oils.\n\nGOUACHE is an opaque water colour paint, also poster paint.\n\nCARTOON is a fullsize detailed drawing of the finished work, using volume, which is transferred to the canvas – it was used to solve any value problems.\n\nUNDERPAINTING was done in sepia monochrome, putting in all the details and values – it was then painted over with pure pigments. It went out with the Impressionists who were able to paint in the field.\n\nLINEAR refers to a painting that is composed of defined lines, either painted on as contours or where edges clearly abut, and composed of defined shapes.\n\nPAINTERLY is work with paint alone, no drawing, with colour suggesting volume and details, the use of texture of the paint, blending and giving no clear definitions as edges weren’t important.\n\nFORMAL painting follows the rules and techniques, producing correct images rather than giving content. theoretical.\n\nEXPRESSIVE painting is straight from the heart, drawing a response from the viewer, showing emotion, and full of content.\n\nJud House 4/09/2016\n\n. . . . .\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSculpture is considered fine art as well as craft. Good sculpture shows texture and invites you to touch it. Its form includes line, shape, texture, colour plus material, technique and function. Subject and material (content) defines its context.\n\nFlowing: use of open grain.\n\nMystery: use of hard dark stone.\n\nCompare the different content and context of the two sculptures called THE KISS – by Rodin, and by Brancusi.\n\nTHE KISS by Rodin.\n\nTHE KISS Series – by Brancusi\n\nSculpture materials have different personalities, e.g. different grains in timbers, veins in marble, textures in stones. The artist is selective, choosing horizontal grain for relaxed mood. Also the treatment of the material by the artist affects the content of the completed work. Sculpture may be decorative, functional, or architectural. Greek temples were sculptural – all views were beautiful, while Roman buildings were in relief – only seen from the front.\n\nHand-held Goddesses (fertility) were the first sculptures in many countries, until they were replaced by the menhirs (phallic) when it became obvious that women were made pregnant by men. Steles (columns) were used to depict religious events and people (both mythical and actual).\n\nFOUR RIVERS FOUNTAIN – Berlini; Bronze statues – Michaelangelo\n\nThe Greeks gave us Godlike, flawless statues of men, while the Romans’ statues were realistic – warts and all. Michaelangelo used forms spiritually, usually figures and often with animals as supports. Bernini’s fountains were also works of art. They were cast in metal, carved in wood or stone, and modelled in clay.\n\nModern sculpture uses the same techniques, but goes much further – we nail, glue, sew, screw, and saw, either figuratively or in abstract form. We also use motorization, and water. Sculpture is in relief (high and low), and free-standing (open or closed).\n\nPiatt – wire & bronze; Mid-Century II – Alicia Dunn; Wishful Thinking – Wood\n\nRELIEF: is carved out from its surround – the relationship of the figure carved and the ground dictates whether it is high or low relief. It is 2D art – the figure is viewed only from the front – not the sides and back, but includes depth because material is removed in its creation.\n\nThe Third Dimension of Depth is included:\n\nIntaglio: line incised into stone.\n\nBas Relief: low relief, e.g. a coin, in which the design barely protrudes from its background.\n\nHigh Relief: this casts a shadow – the sculpture protrudes to a great degree, and may be undercut.\n\nBas Relief; Intaglio; High Relief\n\nFREE-STANDING: Sculpture in the round, which can be seen from all sides. It is the sum of all its viewing angles. It need not stand, e.g. a tiki hanging around a neck is a free-standing sculpture. It can be as small as an amulet, or as large as a mountain; open or closed in form. If the viewer feels it’s complete, then it may be considered closed. If it’s compact, then it’s closed. If the interest is all contained within the work, then it’s closed. If the sculpture interacts with the space around it, e.g. arms and legs akimbo, ready to throw, then it’s considered open – Hellenic Greeks showed weight shift in their creations poses. Mobiles, lines leading out, and interest beyond the work would be open. But a void in a sculpture is no necessarily open – the void might be part of the mass, which would make it closed. Symmetry is usually closed – asymmetry is usually open.\n\nIvory – John-Richard; Samsara – Gill Brown; Recumbent Figure – Henry Moore\n\nAdditional: includes modelling, adding lumps of clay together, putting things togther by any means, e.g. Picasso’s Bull made from a bike seat and handle bars.\n\nSubtractional: by carving away superfluous material to expose the sculpture withing, in wood, stone, marble, or wax.\n\nSubstitutional: the perishable material of original sculpture is replaced by more durable material, e.g. balloon by paper in papier mache, and casting of bronze. To cast Bronze, a wax model is packed in clay or plaster, remove-by-melting the wax, pour in molten bronze till set.\n\nA Votive Statue (also candles) replace s the person in a place of prayer – it has the person’s name on it.\n\nJud House 2/09/2016\n\n. . . . .\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nPlastic Art is a work of art that is created manually in 3D, though some are actually produced in 2D, e.g. textiles. Plastic paintings give the illusion of having 3D volume, while actual 3D works have tactile interest.\n\nCrafts were originally only produced for their functional purposes, e.g.clay pots to store or cook in, and the weaving of cloth for clothing etc. Gradually crafts began to be decorated, so they had aesthetic value as well as functional. Cloth went beyond protection to fashion.\n\nCrafts have become functionally redundant now, e.g. cloth is now produced industrially instead of manually, and weapons are now used as decorations for walls rather than for hunting. Crafts are now thought of as artistic rather than functional.\n\nCool Yard Yonder\n\nOriginally, raw materials for the craftwork came from nature – stone, wood, glass, fibre, clay, ore, wax, feathers, fur, hide, and mud. Today craftwork includes industrially produced materials – plastic, polyester, metals, polyethylene, etc. it is still called craftsmanship.\n\nIllustration, fine arts, and crafts are in separate areas, but are all equal – not one is more important than the another.\n\nCraft: Skill, artistic ability, trade occupation.\n\nFine Art: Artistic skill, creative and aesthetic.\n\nArtisan: is one trained to manual dexterity and skill.\n\nPipaluk Lake Glass\n\nGLASS: Molten, blown into shapes then cooled to solidity.

It may be hammered, rolled, moulded, cast, welded, rivetted, and in plate-form. Damascus steel from the dark ages was stronger than the steel of today, but the formula can’t be reproduced. Developed from 500AD to 900AD and used for coinage, weapons, agriculture, ornaments, jewellery, and in architecture both structurally and decoratively.\n\nTextile Art – Practical, 3D, Decorative, Figurative.\n\nTEXTILES: Created by using fibres – cotton, linen, flax, silk, skin, hide, hair, wool, fur and treebark. It may be woven, pressed, tanned, dried, stretched, knitted, crocheted, knotted as in macrame, and beaten down as in tappa (bark) to make cloth. it was used as trade goods, e.g. Persian carpets and silk bolts of cloth were used as money, and for treaty settlements and dowries.\n\nCERAMICS: This is the oldest for known to man, the making of objects from clay. The Lascaux caves contain clay bisque in relief on the walls. Clay was used to make adobe bricks, pots for drinking and eating, sarcophagi for burials (in terracotta), tablets for writing messages, and beads for trade. A potter (or ceramicist) works with clay, creating funtional and decorative items, either hand-built or wheel-thrown.\n\nHand-built – rolling coils to spiral, then coil into pots, slab pots, pinch pots.\n\nWheel thrown – shaping clay on a wheel – this was the first tool trade.\n\nthe clay is dried in the sun or kiln dried. The heat changes the chemical composition of the clay. The pieces are decorated with glazes baked on, painted before or after firing, and coloured oxides are used. Different types of firing methods are reduction and oxidization. They are classed according to the type of clay and firing temperature used:\n\nJennifer McCurdy; Clay and Glass – Art-O-Matic\n\nEarthenware: coarse clay, low temperature.\n\nStoneware: finer clay, mid temperature.\n\nChina: finer clay still, higher temperature.\n\nPorcelain: fine white clay (Kaolin), fired extremely high temperature to give a translucent affect.\n\nCindy Weaver – Porcelain; Lindsay Feuer Ceramics\n\nFor 3D ART:\n\nForm: includes material used, visual, how made, function, reason it’s made that way.\n\nShape: not only outer contours but interior planes, and inner voids.\n\nMass: is the actual physical solidity of it, but can be unshapen pliable material, e.g. mass of clay.\n\nJud House 2/09/2016\n\n. . . . .\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nDeer in the Forest 1. 1913 – Franz Marc\n\nMODERN.\n\nFRANZ MARC – DEER IN THE FOREST 1. – 1913 – oil on canvas.\n\nFranz Marc abstracted his subject of deer in the forest, playing with colour, shapes and symbols to create an image which represented the ‘harmonious co-existence of all living creatures.’ Despite the abstract nature of the composition the subject is still recognisable by the viewer, both with or without the title.\n\nHe used line cleverly – the contour lines around the heads and bodies of the deer, and the head and wings of the bird – flowing curvilinear lines for the branches of the trees, which also act as directional lines leading the eyes of the viewer around the composition, down to the deer, across to the bird, back to the central tree, which is the Tree of Life. The edges formed by the trees against the background form another type of line.\n\nHe used organic shapes to define the subject, creating them with line, colour and texture on the trees on the far left and right. The deer on the lower left have an underlying triangular shape, while the larger triangular shapes are formed from the central lower deer, to the right mid-level deer, then down to the lower right corner; and from the lower left deer, to the leaf, then to the mid-level right deer. The background is comprised of geometric shapes, created mainly by colour, and the lines where they abut.\n\nWhile he used colour descriptively – the fawn of the deer, the grey/white of the trees, the red of the sunset, the deep blue of the sky, top right, to depict the onset of night, the warm grey and blue of the bird – he also used the colours for the forest in the background expressively, working with analogous greens, blues and yellows subtly, yet occasionally touching this area with the contrasting red. He had, of course, used red boldly as a focal point in the colour-play of the composition.\n\nI feel that this composition is partly closed, by the use of the design stops in the trees on the left and right – yet partly open, as these trees go beyond the lower and upper edges of the canvas, and the ground along the base of the composition is not a visual barrier. I believe the composition has several focal points – the colour red, already mentioned; the group of deer lower left; the dark green leaf on the central tree; and to a lesser extent the white area behind the same tree; and the deer on the right.\n\nThe composition is balanced asymetrically, and almost approximately, with the axis line just to the left of the central tree. It is balanced both colourwise, and in areas of interest – the busy area of the deer balancing the busy area of the curly branches. The intensity of the red, dark blue and yellow areas is balanced by the areas of less intensity of the deer and ground. The values of the dark and the soft/light in these same areas is also balanced.\n\nA feeling of movement is created by the diagonal line of the bird, while the trees appear static. The deer are both. The right deer appears to be turning back towards the other group – its body and head are on the diagonal. The upper two deer in the main group also seem to have movement by their angularity, but the lower deer appear calm by their curved shapes and near horizontal lines.\n\nThe composition is loaded with symbolism – the Tree of Life in the centre, with love-knots in its branches to encompass the other forest trees, providing shelter for the birds and the beasts. The descending night, the red-yellow glow, symbolically adds further protection for the deer, which he sees as symbolising virginity and innocence. The single green leaf on the Tree of Life symbolises new growth and hope, anticipation of life to come. The bird appears to be an owl, symbolising wisdom flying in to settle in the Tree of Life. I can also see what I believe is the symbol for Man – the circle at the top of the green cylinder, lower right, seems to have an arrow leading out and up towards the deer on the right. This, to me, represents Man as being a part of nature with the capabilities of co-existing in harmony with his environment. This message is still valid today.\n\nHe has created a feeling of shallow space by overlapping the various components – bird over left tree, left and right trees over deer, deer over central tree, and that tree in front of diagonal lines in the red area which are suggestive of foliage. Also, by the use of the dominant red area he has created a sense of that warmth coming forward, compressing the space in front of it. The viewer is shown an image which appears to end just beyond the Tree of Life.\n\nThis is a delightful painting. As the title suggests, Marc created further forest paintings, abstracting the images more intensely and vividly as you will see if you Google his Franz Marc/Paintings.\n\nDeer in the Forest II ; Roe Deer in the Forest;\n\nDeer in the Flower Garden\n\nPS: I added the smaller pics between the text to make it easier for you to find the artistic elements I describe without contstantly scrolling back.\n\nIf you choose to quote from this blog please cite the URL in your Bibliography.

Energy travels its length and is intensified at each end. Most important is directional force.\n\nHorizontal: supporting lines – stable.\n\nVertical: gravitational pull – implied.\n\nDiagonal: dynamic, implying action.\n\nLines can be straight, curved, thick, thin, direct, indirect, unbroken, broken, and implied.\n\nThere is no absolute QUALITY of any visual unit. Every element is influenced by its environment and any inter-relations which are operating – e.g.straight line illusions.\n\nEXPRESSIVE QUALITY OF LINE:\n\n1 A Cheer 2. A Screech\n\n3 A Death 4 Deviousness\n\n5 Gentleness 6 Breathlessness\n\n7 Out of Line 8 Line of Least Resistance\n\n9 Breadline\n\nLINE IN SPACE: Changing one parameter at a time.\n\nSTRAIGHT LINE ILLUSION:\n\nSHAPE: awareness of the space within and the space outside of outlines.\n\nAlso of positive/negative relationships, figure/field reversal, and shape/space support. Shapes can be either static or dynamic.\n\nVALUE: the relative lightness or darkness of surfaces.\n\nAlso called tone, tonal scales,tints and shades, tonal values. It is the means by which we show volume on a 2D surface. No values are absolute.\n\nKEY: is a balance between High, Intermediate and Low Values, i.e. lights and darks, within the whole work.\n\nHigh is light, Intermediate is medium, and Low is dark. Can be used to create moods within a work, e.g. happy, sombre.\n\nTEXTURE: is the tactile quality of a surface, or the representation of the quality.\n\nTexture can be actual or implied.\n\nPRINCIPLES OF DESIGN: involve the character or quality of relationships within the work and between the work and its surroundings.\n\nWe will deal with proportion; repetition and rhythm; unity with variety; contrast; and emphasis and subordination.\n\nPROPORTION: a ‘rapport’ between two dimensions – can have meaning without any sense of measurement.\n\nSize relationship of parts to each other and parts to the whole.\n\nGolden Mean/ Golden Proportion/ Golden Section: naturally occurring proportion – is the rate of all growth in the world. 1:1.618 or close to 5/8ths.\n\nFibonacci Series: 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21; 34; 55; 89; etc. Take any rwo numbers and draw a rectangle e.g. 5 x 8 cms or 8 x 13 cms. It also has its basis in nature.\n\n5:8 = 10 x 16 or 2.5 x 4\n\nUNITY WITH VARIETY: is the appearance of oneness – with some diversity, which can be value, shape, texture, colour, or scale change.\n\nCONTRAST: is the interaction of contradictory elements, e.g. contrast of shape with unity of colour, or vica versa.\n\nEMPHASIS & SUBORDINATION: Emphasis establishes a centre of interest, while subordination supports a centre of interest.\n\nJud House 1/09/2016\n\n. . . . .\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
