        "text": "How German painting and performance changed in the aftermath of World War I\n\nOnstage at Lantern Theater Company September 5 through October 13, 2019, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui is a Bertolt Brecht masterpiece that sets a story of fascism and violence among 1930s Chicago gangsters. Brecht often used this collage-like effect with his plays: setting a modern story in another time and place, and aiming to get at truth through art by unmasking the illusion behind it. Using collage, jarring effects and styles, and purposefully overt theatricality, Brecht was using tools that many artists were exploring in the years immediately following World War I — as Brecht was coming up in Berlin’s theater scene.\n\nThe arts were a major site of change in the years following World War I. Until the late 19th century, German art was dominated by Neoclassical forms. Romanticism’s passionate depictions of nature were also fixtures of the German art scene, but a contained and composed classical style was the most prevalent form. Music and dance were classical and formal as well. This began to change at the turn of the century, as German artists began breaking off into experimental groups and developed German expressionism. German art as a whole would never be the same; artists in every discipline began straining against the constraints of classical teaching and began using art to push back against tradition and social order.\n\nVisual art in Germany particularly flourished between 1900 and 1933. German expressionism emphasized the artists’ emotions and rejected realism in favor of semi-abstraction, sharp angles, and intense colors, as well as the use of traditional media in new ways. This turn was inspired by a desire to bridge the past and present in a new art form. In their manifesto, the Bridge, one of the earliest German expressionist collectives, declared that with their art “We call all young people together, and as young people, who carry the future in us, we want to wrest freedom for our actions and our lives from the older, comfortably established forces.”\n\nAfter World War I, the tenor of these images changed. The abstraction and angularity remained, but a twisted sort of realism emerged. German artists were haunted by the unimaginable and unprecedented horrors of the war— a conflict so mechanized that vast numbers of soldiers could be killed in seconds without ever seeing the faces of their opponents. Modernist German artists like Otto Dix and Ludwig Kirchner utilized both realistic shapes and grotesque ones to depict the horrors they saw on the frontlines as soldiers.\n\nThe visual arts’ movement toward less pretty, more angular and arresting work carried over into the performing arts as well. German film was deeply influenced by expressionism in the years following the war, and movies like 1920's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari utilized exaggerated, twisting, sharply angled sets and heightened performance styles to express inner turmoil. The effects of this cinematic aesthetic were deeply influential for the film noir and horror genres.\n\nDance of the period was also inspired by this rise of expressionism and experimentation. One major figure was Mary Wigman, a German dancer and choreographer and a pioneer of expressionist dance. Formally trained in ballet, she rejected the fluidity and mechanization of that classical form in favor of a freer dance that would express human emotion and passion. Her work used tension and release, vibration, falling, and other types of movement not previously categorized as dance. Wigman felt, though, that any movement could be dance, as long as it was a physical expression of a feeling.\n\nMusic and theater were also affected by this movement away from rigidity and toward expression. Most important for The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui is Brecht’s own experience with these changing forms, as he built the foundation for his theatrical career in post-war Berlin amid the cabaret scene, immersing himself in experimental and expressionist theater. With his frequent partner Kurt Weill, Brecht created a number of pieces using music as a tool to make his political points. Weill wrote jangly, sometimes discordant music inspired by cabaret, jazz, and ragtime rather than classical musical forms, and in their most famous collaboration, The Threepenny Opera, this collage of style comes together to make political and social points, just as the larger art world around them was working to do.\n\nAll of this blossoming experimentation and boundary-pushing was not to last in Germany, however. As allegorically depicted in The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, Hitler rose to prominence in the late 1920s and early 1930s. His regime branded most of this art “degenerate,” outlawing and burning much of it and threatening or exiling the artists responsible. The art forms most suited to criticize fascism were silenced by its rise.\n\nThe Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui is onstage at the Lantern September 5 through October 13, 2019.
