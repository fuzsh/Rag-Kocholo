THE STARS\n\nMats Hummels â Position: Defender, Team: Bayern Munich\n\nToni Kroos â Position: Midfielder, Team: Real Madrid\n\nSami Khedira â Position: Midfielder, Team: Juventus Turin\n\nJoshua Kimmich â Position: defense, Team: Bayern Munich\n\nJÃ©rÃ´me Boateng â Position: defense, Team: Bayern Munich\n\nManuel Neuer â Position: Goalkeeper, Team: Bayern Munich\n\n2. âJOGIâ, THE COACH WITH THE INCREDIBLE HAIR\n\nJoachim LÃ¶w (aka âJogiâ) has been the coach of the German national team since 2006. He is famous for his classy outfits and incredible hair. Just google the man.\n\n3. FOOTBALL VOCAB âAUF DEUTSCHâ\n\nThere are some German football expressions you should absolutely know â especially if youâre watching the games with Germans:\n\nTor â Goal\n\nAbseits â Offside\n\nMittelfeld â Midfield\n\nStÃ¼rmer â Striker\n\nAbwehr â Defense\n\nKapitÃ¤n â Captain\n\nSchiedsrichter â Referee\n\nElfmeterschieÃen â Penalty shoot-out (quite a mouthful, huh?)\n\nVerlÃ¤ngerung â Extra time\n\nFreistoÃ â Free kick\n\nEcke â Corner\n\n4. PUBLIC VIEWINGS ARE A BIG DEAL\n\nDuring big football events and important finals, every cafÃ©, restaurant, and Biergarten in Germany puts up screens to show the game. Everyone, from kids to grandmas, comes together to watch and cheer. In Berlin and Munich, youâll also find so-called fan miles at the Brandenburger Tor and on LeopoldstraÃe: There, up to a million people gather to watch the games together â all dressed in black, red and gold (the German colors)!\n\n5. ITâS ALL ABOUT THE CHANTS\n\nâOle, Ole, Ole, Super Deutschland, Oleâ â This is the German version of the international chant âOle, Ole, Ole, We Are The Champions, Ole.â\n\nâDschland, Dschlandâ â Means: âGermany, Germanyâ and as Deutschland is such a long word, we shorten it and just say âDschland.â\n\nâSo sehen Sieger aus, shalalalalaâ¦â â This chant is used when the team is winning. It means: âThatâs what champions look like, shalalalalaâ¦â\n\nâEiner geht noch, einer geht noch rein!â â Used when the team is on a roll. It means: âOne more goal is still possible!â\n\n6. GERMANS LOVE THEIR FOOTBALL SONGS\n\nSportfreunde Stiller: â54, â74, â90, 2010â\n\nHerbert GrÃ¶nemeyer_:_ Zeit, dass sich was dreht\n\nXavier Naidoo: Dieser Weg (Fun fact: The German players were listening to this song during the World Cup 2006Â before leaving the changing room, and thatâs how and why it became a football song.)\n\nSasha: This is my time\n\nAndreas Bourani: Auf uns (This was the official song of the German TV station ARD during the World Cup 2014.)\n\n7. AND THEY CELEBRATE WITH BEER SHOWERS\n\nIn Germany, football victories are not celebrated with champagne: Instead, the players (and fans) shower everyone with beer, preferably from a huge mug."
