        "text": "Franz Marc By Natalia Hernandez\n\nWhat he did • Franz Marc was an expressionist and he did paintings that he could express himself with. • He was in the military service at the beginning of World War 2. • He started painting forms of expressionism to follow in his father’s footsteps because he was an artist.\n\nAbout him • He was born in Germany, Feb 8,1880. • He almost got married but then ran away to Paris the day before his wedding. • He was impressed by some paintings with animals and started doing his own, like them.\n\nMore paintings • Yellow Cow • Tiger • The Lamb\n\nQuotes • In Paris, Marc said, “Like a roe deer in an enchanted forest, for which it has always yearned”, talking about a painting. • Marc was in depression for a while but he said his own “wavering, anxiety ridden spirit found peace at least in these marvelous paintings”. • Marc was killed by getting struck in the head with a shell splinter. (1916)"
