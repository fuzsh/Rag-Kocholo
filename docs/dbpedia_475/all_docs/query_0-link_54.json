Agricultural landscapes, where animal breeding is a major activity, constitute a mosaic of habitat types of various quality for tick survival and are used at different frequencies by wild and domestic hosts across seasons. This habitat heterogeneity, in time and space, conditions the dynamics of these host-vector-pathogen systems and thus drives acarological risk (defined as the density of infected ticks). The principal objective of the OSCAR project (2011-2016) was to examine the links between this heterogeneity and acarological risk for humans and their domestic animals. Here, we present the data associated with this project.\n\nNew information\n\nThis paper reports a database on the distribution and densities of I. ricinus ticks - the most common tick species in French agricultural landscapes - and the prevalence of three tick-borne pathogens (Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia spp. and Babesia spp.) in two sites in north-western (“Zone Atelier Armorique”: ZA site) and south-western (“Vallées et Coteaux de Gascogne”: VG site) France. The distribution and density of ticks along a gradient of wooded habitats, as well as biotic variables, such as the presence and abundance of their principal domestic (livestock) and wild hosts (small mammals), were measured from forest cores and edges to more or less isolated hedges, all bordering meadows. Ticks, small mammals and information on local environmental conditions were collected along 90 transects in each of the two sites in spring and autumn 2012 and 2013 and in spring 2014, corresponding to the main periods of tick activity. Local environmental conditions were recorded along each tick and small mammal transect: habitat type, vegetation type and characteristics, slope and traces of livestock presence. Samples consisted of questing ticks collected on the vegetation (mainly I. ricinus nymphs), biopsies of captured small mammals and ticks fixed on small mammals. In the VG site, livestock occurrence and abundance were recorded each week along each tick transect.\n\nA total of 29004 questing ticks and 1230 small mammals were captured during the study across the two sites and over the five field campaigns. All questing nymphs (N = 12287) and questing adults (N = 646) were identified to species. Ticks from small mammals (N = 1359) were also identified to life stage. Questing nymphs (N = 4518 I. ricinus) and trapped small mammals (N = 908) were analysed for three pathogenic agents: A. phagocytophilum, Borrelia spp. and Babesia spp.\n\nIn the VG site, the average prevalence in I. ricinus nymphs for A. phagocytophilum, Borrelia spp. and Babesia spp. were, respectively 1.9% [95% CI: 1.2-2.5], 2.5% [95% CI: 1.8-3.2] and 2.7% [95% CI: 2.0-3.4]. In small mammals, no A. phagocytophilum was detected, but the prevalence for Borrelia spp. was 4.2% [95% CI: 0.9-7.5]. On this site, there was no screening of small mammals for Babesia spp. In ZA site, the average prevalence in nymphs for A. phagocytophilum, Borrelia spp. and Babesia were, respectively 2.2% [95% CI: 1.6-2.7], 3.0% [95% CI: 2.3-3.6] and 3.1% [95% CI: 2.5-3.8]. In small mammals, the prevalence of A. phagocytophilum and Borrelia spp. were, respectively 6.9% [95% CI: 4.9-8.9] and 4.1% [95% CI: 2.7-5.9]. A single animal was found positive for Babesia microti at this site amongst the 597 tested.\n\nKeywords: Ticks, Ixodes ricinus, small mammals, Apodemus sylvaticus, Myodes glareolus, prevalence, Anaplasma , Borrelia , Babesia , France, forest, agricultural landscapes, livestock, zoonotic disease\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn agricultural landscapes, where livestock production occupies a large proportion of the surface area, pastures often adjoin different semi-natural ecosystems (forests, woods, hedges). This type of landscape mosaic implies that areas exploited by livestock are also frequently used by a diverse range of wild fauna. Many parasites and pathogens are shared amongst these animal species, even in the absence of direct contact and some may be transmitted between agricultural and semi-natural systems via common arthropod vectors. In France, ticks are major vectors for both human (e.g. Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., the agent of Lyme disease) and livestock pathogens (e.g. Anaplasma phagocytophilum, inducing granulocytic anaplasmosis or Babesia divergens, causing bovine babesiosis), with Ixodes ricinus being the most commonly-involved vector.\n\nI. ricinus is a three-stage tick that feeds on a wide variety of vertebrate hosts (Sonenshine and Roe 2014, Bonnet et al. 2016). While larvae and nymphs may feed on a range of different-sized hosts, adult ticks require a bloodmeal from a larger host, like roe deer Capreolus capreolus or domestic animals (Ruiz-Fons et al. 2012). Host species are differently exploited by ticks and display variable susceptibilities to infection by different tick-borne infectious agents, exhibiting different levels of reservoir competence (Ostfeld et al. 2014). The abundance and diversity of different hosts thus influence the density of infected ticks (i.e. the “acarological risk”) and hence the probability of contact with humans and livestock (LoGiudice et al. 2003, Boyard et al. 2007, Takumi et al. 2019).\n\nAgricultural landscapes constitute a mosaic of habitat types that vary in quality for tick survival and host use. The habitat composition of a given plot and its connection with other habitats will determine its use by wild vertebrates and will thus shape local tick-host interactions (Estrada-Peña 2002, Li et al. 2012, Werden et al. 2014, Heylen et al. 2019). Breeding practices and particularly, the management of animal grazing in different types of pastures, will also influence exposure risk of livestock to ticks and the pathogens they carry (Richter and Matuschka 2006, Boyard et al. 2007, Gassner et al. 2008, Agoulon et al. 2012, Ruiz-Fons et al. 2012). However, agricultural mosaics are not temporally fixed and can vary both seasonally and yearly. We are also currently witnessing rapid landscape modifications due to the influence of global changes and particularly those associated with land-use (i.e. relative proportions of breeding/crop surfaces, forest or hedge fragmentation) and climate change (i.e. tick population dynamics are tightly linked to temperature and humidity regimes) (Medlock et al. 2013, Agoulon et al. 2016).\n\nThe main goal of the OSCAR project (Outil de Simulation Cartographique à l’échelle du paysage Agricole du Risque acarologique / Simulation Tool for Mapping Acarological Risk in Agricultural Landscapes) was to explore the relationships between landscape structure and acarological risk. The study was carried out in two agricultural sites that are part of the International Long-Term Ecological Research (ILTER) network (Zones Ateliers network in France http://www.za-inee.org/en/node/804) and encompass the intrinsic diversity of agricultural landscape features: one LTER site - the “Zone Atelier Armorique” (“ZA site” hereafter) - in north-western France and the second in south-western France in the region of “Vallées et Coteaux de Gascogne” (“VG site” hereafter, belonging to the recently labelled “Zone Atelier PyGar\"). Before conducting analyses, the initial task of the OSCAR project consisted of mapping the distribution of ticks, pathogens and the principal domestic (cattle) and wild (small mammals and roe deer) hosts, along a gradient of landscape fragmentation, from forest cores and edges to more or less isolated hedges, all bordering meadows. This paper describes the collected datasets (Fig. ) (1) on questing tick and small mammal densities, (2) on local environmental conditions (habitat, vegetation and livestock densities) of sampled transects and (3) on pathogen prevalence in ticks and small mammals. Due to time and manpower constraints, we restricted our assessment of tick host species to small mammals, livestock and roe deer, the principal reservoir hosts implicated in disease for production animals. Additional datasets used in some analyses, such as roe deer presence, were not collected in the framework of this study (Fig. ), but are available elsewhere as outlined in the text.\n\nProject description\n\nPersonnel\n\nLaboratories involved: § BIOEPAR, # CEFS, ¶ MIVEGEC, ‡ EPIA, | ECOBIO, 1 UMR CBGP Montpellier\n\nCoordinator of the project: Plantard O. §\n\nTask managers of the project: Vourc’h G. ‡ (Sampling, biological analyses and database constitution), McCoy K.D. ¶ (Empirical estimation of factors influencing acarological risk from field data), Hoch T. § (Simulating acarological risk maps according to environmental changes)\n\nSite managers and contacts for samplings: Verheyden H. # for the VG (‘‘Vallées et Coteaux de Gascogne’’) LTER site and Butet A. | for the ZA (“Zone Atelier Armorique”) LTER site.\n\nData management and Geographic Information System (GIS): Agoulon A. §, Bastian S. §, Dorr N. ‡, Lebert I. ‡, Lourtet B. #, Mahé H. §, Rantier Y. |\n\nSample collection\n\nVG site: Angibault J. #, Bailly X. ‡, Bard E. ‡, Bastian S. §, Cargnelutti B. #, Cebe N. #, Chastagner A. ‡, Delrue B. §, Lebert I. ‡, Léger E. ¶, Lourtet B. #, Mahé H. §, Masseglia S. ‡, McCoy K.D. ¶, Merlet J. #, Noël V. ¶, Perez G. §,|, Picot D. #, Pion A. ‡, Poux V. ‡, Quillery E. §, Toty C. ¶, Vaumourin E. ‡, Verheyden H. #, Vincent S. ‡, Vourc'h G. ‡\n\nZA site: Agoulon A. §, Al Hassan D. |, Armand F. §, Audiart J.-Y. §, Bastian S. §, Billon D. §, Bouju-Albert A. §, Boullot F. §,|, Bruneau A. §, Butet A. |, Daniel J. §, de la Cotte N. §, Delrue B. §, Faille F. §, Gonnet M. ‡, Hermouet A. §, Hoch T. §, Jambon O. |, Jouglin M. §, Lemine-Brahim M. §, Mahé H. §, Moreau E. §, Navarro N. §, Pavel I. §, Perez G. §,|, Plantard O. §, Quillery E. §, Rantier Y. |, Renaud J. §, Roy P. §\n\nIdentification of small mammals\n\nVG site: Bastian S. §, Butet A. |, Cèbe N. #, Chastagner A. ‡, Cosson J. 1, Léger E. ¶, Masseglia S. ‡, McCoy K.D. ¶, Noël V. ¶, Perez G. §,|, Vaumourin E. ‡, Vourc'h G. ‡\n\nZA site: Butet A. |, Perez G. §,|, Agoulon A. §, Bastian S. §, Bouju-Albert A. §, Gonnet M. ‡, Hermouet A. §, Moreau E. §, Pavel I. §, Plantard O. §\n\nTick identification\n\nVG site: Pion A. ‡, Poux V. ‡\n\nZA site: Agoulon A. §, Bouju-Albert A. §, Hermouet A. §, Plantard O. §\n\nLaboratory analysis\n\nVG site: Chastagner A. ‡, Masseglia S. ‡, McCoy K.D. ¶, Noël V. ¶, Léger E. ¶\n\nZA site: Bouju-Albert A. §, Daniel J. §, Faille F. §, Hermouet A. §, Jouglin M. §, Léger E. ¶, McCoy K.D. ¶, Noël V. ¶, Perez G. §,|, Quillery E. §\n\nLivestock survey: (VG site only): Angibault J. #, Cargnelutti B. #, Lourtet B. #, Sevila J. #, Verheyden H. #\n\nStudy area description\n\nLTER site “Vallées et Coteaux de Gascogne” (VG site)\n\nThe VG site is a Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site (referenced as zone atelier Pyrénées Garonne - PYGAR since 2016, https://pygar.omp.eu/), located 75 km from Toulouse in south-western France (43°16'2.64\"N, 0°51'51.00\"E) (Fig. ). The area is hilly (altitude 200–400 m above sea level) and dissected by north-south valleys with a mild oceanic climate and summer droughts. Woodland covers 24% of the area with two main forest patches of about 500 and 700 ha, many woods smaller than 50 ha and hedges dominated by Quercus spp. Areas dedicated to cultivated crops cover 32% of the main study site. Meadows cover another 40%, amongst which half are grazed by domestic animals (mostly cattle, horses, sheep, but sometimes goats and pigs), either individually or in mixed groups. The roe deer density has been estimated at around 6 roe deer/km2 in open areas and more than 30 roe deer/km2 in one of the forest areas (Hewison et al. 2007).\n\nLTER site “Zone atelier Armorique” (ZA site)\n\nThe ZA site (https://osur.univ-rennes1.fr/za-armorique) (Fig. ) is a labelled LTER area of the CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique), where ecological studies have been conducted for over 25 years. It is an agricultural landscape situated in the vicinity of Rennes, which is south of the Mont-Saint-Michel’s Bay (north-east Brittany, Western France) (48°29'22.40\"N, 1°33'41.48\"W). The area includes a wide array of agricultural landscape features, a forest of about 1000 ha and many woods smaller than 50 ha. The southern part of the site is a fine-grain heterogeneous landscape with a complex network of hedgerows (160 m/ha) enclosing small fields. At the northern part of the site, agricultural intensification has led to a more homogeneous coarse-grain landscape with fewer hedgerows per hectare (70 m/ha) enclosing larger fields. The proportion of grassland is greater in the southern part, whereas fields of maize and cereal dominate the northern part. Small woods are disseminated within both northern and southern areas of the site (Hassan et al. 2012).\n\nSampling methods\n\nStudy extent\n\nThe study was performed in the two LTER sites (ZA and VG) from 2012 to 2014. Questing ticks and small mammals were sampled during five field campaigns: spring and autumn 2012, spring and autumn 2013 and spring 2014. The sampling design is presented in Fig. .\n\nThe sampling zones (n = 60) were located in 4 landscape types: Agricultural landscapes with a Low Hedgerow network density (LH); Agricultural landscapes with a High Hedgerow network density (HH); Forest Edge (FE); and Forest Core (FC) (Fig. ). Small mammals were sampled in 24 zones (amongst the 60 sampling zones), trap-lines being systematically paired with one or two questing tick transect-lines (Fig. ). Small mammal trap-lines were distributed amongst the four landscape types as follows: six in LH, six in HH, six in FE and six in FC. For each trap-line, 34 traps were spaced 3 m apart along the 100 m line.\n\nQuesting ticks were sampled in all 60 zones (including the 24 zones for small mammal sampling). In each zone, one or two transect-lines were defined: 1) a single transect-line was sampled when found along hedgerows and in FC; 2) two transect-lines were run when situated at wood and forest edges (i.e. on either side of the ecotone: one in the meadow and one in the forest) (Fig. ). This resulted in a total of 90 questing tick transect-lines which were distributed as follows: 30 in LH, 30 in HH, 20 in FE and 10 in FC. For each transect-line, ticks were collected along lines of 300 m, divided into 10 sub-transects of 10 m2 each (10 m length x 1 m width), with a space of 20 m between sub-transects (Fig. ).\n\nThe design was fully applied (60 sampling zones) in four campaigns (spring and autumn 2012, spring 2013 and 2014), but only 36 transect lines from the 24 zones used to quantify small mammal presence were sampled during autumn 2013, corresponding to an optimisation of the sampling effort during a less favourable period of tick activity.\n\nSampling description\n\nRecording local environmental conditions\n\nGeoreferencing of sampling locations of ticks (Table ) and small mammals (Table ) was obtained in the field using a Trimble GNSS GeoExplorer XT 6000 receiver. A differential correction in post-processing made it possible to obtain decimetric precision. The points obtained were exported in a shape (shp) format and inserted into Geographic Information System (ArcGIS) software. Drawings of the sampling lines were performed on maps by the operators during sampling and were corrected with the GIS database with the help of orthophotos (BD ORTHO®, resolution 50 cm x 50 cm, IGN). During sampling, local environmental conditions were recorded for the questing tick transect-lines, the tick sub-transects and the small mammal trap-lines. The following variables were recorded in the field during tick sampling (Fig. ) and small mammal sampling (Fig. ): date and time of the day, habitat type, vegetation type and characteristics, slope, traces of use by livestock. In the VG site, livestock occurrence and abundance were also recorded each week along each tick transect. The livestock survey was only performed in the VG site in association with other research projects and these data were not collected in the ZA site. The data were entered into specific tables of the database (Tables , , , ).\n\nTable 1.\n\nField Description Type ECHT_IDIdentifier for tick sub-transect line: campaign - site - landscape type - transect line number -

In each sub-transect, a 1x1 m white flannel cloth (or ‘flag’) was slowly dragged (0.5 m/s) along 9 m (explored surface of 10 m2) across the lower vegetation and leaf-litter (Agoulon et al. 2012). Ticks were counted, collected from the flag and stored in 70% ethanol for later identification (life stage and species) and detection of infectious agents using molecular analyses (Fig. , Table ). Tick identifications were performed using a binocular microscope, according to Pérez-Eid (2007).\n\nTable 7.\n\nField Description Type ECHLT_IDIdentifier of the transect: season-site-landscape-transect number - Identifier for campaign (1 = spring 2012, 3 = spring 2013)Text (20 c.)ECHLT_DATESampling date for a transectDate/TimeECHT_IDIdentifier for the tick transect -subtransect: campaign - site - landscape - transect number - sub-transect numberText (30 c.)TIQ_IDIdentifier for a tickText (30 c.)ANA_RESULT1Result method 1: detection of Anaplasma from tick DNA (yes = 1, no = 0)BooleanANA_RESULT2Result method 2: detection of Anaplasma from tick DNA (yes = 1, no = 0)BooleanANA_CO_SEQSequencing analysis: obtained sequence for Anaplasma (yes = 1, no = 0)BooleanBOR_RESULTResult: detection of Borrelia from tick DNA (yes = 1, no = 0)BooleanBOR_CO_SEQSequencing analysis: obtained sequence for Borrelia (yes = 1, no = 0)BooleanBOR_REMRemark: assignment to a speciesMemoBAB_RESULTResult: detection of Babesia by PCR from tick DNA (yes = 1, no = 0)BooleanBAB_CO_SEQSequencing analysis: obtained sequence for Babesia (yes = 1, no = 0)IntegerBAB_CO_REMRemark: assignment to a speciesMemo\n\nSampling of small mammals\n\nThe 100 m trap-line contained 34 INRAE live-traps, fitted with dormitory boxes and baited with a mixture of seeds and fresh apple. After placement, the traps were checked in the morning 24- and 48-hours after setup (Figs , ). Captured small mammals were identified to species, sexed and weighed to 0.5 g in a field laboratory (Table ). They were euthanised by authorised experimenters in accordance with French law and dissected. A blood sample and ear and spleen biopsies were performed for the detection and characterisation of infectious agents during the first four field campaigns. Blood sampling was performed on trapped animals using the retro-orbital method (Hoff 2000). Blood pellets were separated from serum by centrifugation. Serum samples were stored at −20°C and are available for supplementary analysis upon request. Ticks from small mammals were counted immediately after being euthanised in VG, but in ZA, due to the high number of captured mammals, dead animals were frozen and ticks were collected later during dissections. All collected ticks were stored in 70% ethanol for later identification and use for molecular analyses. The animals captured in spring 2014 were not euthanised, but were released at least 500 m away from the capture site to avoid recapture and ticks were quickly collected on these individuals.\n\nMolecular analyses\n\nIn tick (Fig. ) (Table ): Amongst the 12287 nymphs collected during the five campaigns, 4518 I. ricinus nymphs were selected at random from the two major periods of tick activity, i.e. spring campaigns of 2012 and 2013. For each tick, DNA was extracted using the ammonia-based protocol described in Schouls et al. (1999). Borrelia detection was performed using the quantitative PCR (SYBRGreen) protocol outlined in Jacquot et al. (2016). To identify the infecting Borrelia species, positive samples were re-amplified using nested PCR protocols for the FlaB and OspC genes (Gómez-Díaz et al. 2011) and amplicons were directly sequenced using Sanger technology (Eurofins, France). Detection of A. phagocytophilum DNA was ascertained by real-time PCR by targeting msp2/p44 genes and genotypes were characterised by 454 sequencing of groEL, msp4 and ankA genes (GATC, Germany) (Chastagner et al. 2017). The detection of Babesia spp. was achieved by nested PCR of the 18S rRNA gene (Jouglin et al. 2017). Positive amplicons were purified using ExoSAP-IT (Ozyme, France) and sent for Sanger sequencing (GATC, Germany). Additional investigations were also conducted on the population genetics of some ticks (nymphs), using either microsatellite (d'Ambrioso 2016) or SNP loci (Quillery et al. 2014).\n\nIn small mammals (Fig. ) (Tables , ): Small mammals trapped in spring and autumn sessions of 2012 and 2013 were analysed for the three pathogenic agents (N = 300 small mammals in VG site and N = 608 in ZA site). However, a couple of individuals could not be tested for all pathogens because of insufficient DNA quantity. Spleens were stored at −20°C for detection of A. phagocytophilum (Chastagner et al. 2016) and Babesia (Jouglin et al. 2017). Ear biopsies were stored in 70% ethanol for detection of Borrelia spp. (Jacquot et al. 2016). DNA from spleen and ear samples were extracted using the NucleoSpinTissue kit (Macherey Nagel, Düren, Germany) (Chastagner et al. 2016, Perez et al. 2017). DNA of A. phagocytophilum was detected by real-time PCR targeting the msp2 gene, according to the protocol of Courtney et al. (2004). Detection of Babesia spp. was achieved by nested PCR of the 18S rRNA gene; different primers were used to amplify Babesia spp. from small mammals and from ticks because of high rates of false positive amplifications with small mammal DNA (Jouglin et al. 2017). Positive amplicons were purified using ExoSAP-IT (Ozyme, France) and sent for Sanger conventional sequencing (GATC, Germany). DNA of B. burgdorferi s.l. in ear samples was detected and typed as outlined for ticks.\n\nTable 8.\n\nField Description Type ECHLM_IDIdentifier of the trap-line: campaign - site - landscape type - trap-line numberText (30 c.)ECHLM_DATESampling date for the placement of trapsDate/TimeMAM_IDIdentifier of the trapped small mammals: campaign - site - landscape type - trap-line number - small mammal numberText (30 c.)LMAM_NOM_LATSpecies nameText (50 c.)BOOR_RESULT_PCRResult: detection of Borrelia from small mammal ear DNA: 1 = yes, 0 = noBooleanBOOR_SEQSequencing analysis of Borrelia: 1 = yes, 0 = noBooleanBOOR_SPSpecies name of BorreliaMemoANR_RESULT_QPCRResult: detection of Anaplasma from spleen DNA: 1 = yes, 0 = noBooleanANR_RA_SEQSequencing analysis: obtained sequence for Anaplasma (1 = yes, 0 = no)Integer\n\nLivestock survey in VG site\n\nLivestock abundance was measured in the VG site on the pasture adjoining each tick transect-line in 2012 and 2013 (Table ). The number of cattle, sheep, goats and horses grazing in each pasture was monitored on a weekly basis from autumn 2011 to spring 2013, excluding the winter (November to March). The number of individuals grazing in each pasture was then summed per season (spring: week 17 to 26, summer: week 27 to 35, autumn: week 36 to 44) to obtain a livestock abundance estimate, given as the number of head.day per season. When averaged per count day and summed across the whole VG site, the livestock mean density was 20.3 animals/km2 in the open landscapes (HH and LH).\n\nTable 9.\n\nField Description Type LTIQ_IDIdentifier for the transect line: site - landscape type - transect line numberText (20 c.)BET_IDIdentifier for livestockText (30 c.)BET_SAISONSeason: spring (week 17 to 26), summer (week 27 to 35), autumn (week 36 to 44)Text (10 c.)BET_ANNEEYearIntegerBET_CUMULSum of livestock heads.day at pasture over the considered season (spring 70 days, summer 63 days, autumn 63 days)IntegerLBET_ESPECESpecies name: bovine, caprine, equine, ovineText (20 c.)\n\nDataBase\n\nAll the data of Tables , , , , , , , , were united in a single Access database.

They are available on http://eurodeer.org/ or upon request to the CEFS.\n\nWeather data were obtained from Météo-France weather stations close to ZA (Broualan, Rennes-St Jacques, Pontorson) and VG (Boussan, Fabas, Palaminy) sites. Additional weather data were measured near the VG site at the meteorological weather station (INRAE in SAMAN), located at the UMR DYNAFOR (INRAE-INPT) in Saint-André (F-31420) or near the ZA site at the COSTEL meteorological weather station (CNRS in COSTEL), located in the LEGT RENNES. According to the location, the weather stations were equipped with sensors to measure air and ground temperatures, air humidity, pluviometry, wind speed and direction, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and light intensity. The data (2011-2014) are available upon request to the corresponding author.\n\nAdditional variables were calculated to measure landscape heterogeneity around the sampling locations. These data and their production (ecotone length between wooded habitat and meadows, proportion of woodland cover, grassland cover and crops, mean distance between wooded patches, perimeter-area ratio of wooded patches, connectivity of wooded habitat patch) are presented in Perez et al.

A total of 29004 questing ticks and 1230 small mammals were collected during the study at the two sites and over the five campaigns. All questing nymphal (N = 12311) and adult ticks (646) were identified to species. Ticks from small mammals (N = 1359) were also identified to the stage.\n\nSampled ticks\n\nDuring the five campaigns (from spring 2012 to spring 2014), 16047 larvae, 12287 I. ricinus nymphs, 646 I. ricinus adults and 24 Ixodes frontalis nymphs were collected on the vegetation (Table ).\n\nTable 11.\n\nCampaign Site No sampled transect-lines No larvae No IR nymphs No IR adults No IF nymphs 1VG902415885911ZA895214262210972VG907581431102ZA8936492772273VG90699328503ZA901508319616404VG362716804ZA368673302045VG90258486905ZA9039062335995 Total 16047 12287 646 24\n\nFig. presents the density of I. ricinus nymphs, according to landscape type and field campaign.

However, large heterogeneities were found amongst the five campaigns in both sites.\n\nSampled small mammals\n\nOver the study, 335 small mammals were trapped in the VG site (Table ) and 895 in the ZA site (Table ). Seven different species were found in VG against five in ZA. In both sites, wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) were the dominant species, accounting for 75% of the captured individuals. Bank vole (Myodes glareolus) was the second most frequently-encountered species in both sites (VG: 11% and ZA: 24%).\n\nTable 12.\n\nSpecies name Number of captured individuals Apodemus sylvaticus 250 Myodes glareolus 37 Crocidura russula 18 Microtus arvalis 14 Sorex coronatus 11 Microtus agrestis 4 Microtus pyrenaicus 1 Total 335\n\nTable 13.\n\nSpecies name Number of captured individuals Apodemus sylvaticus 668 Myodes glareolus 216 Microtus agrestis 4 Sorex coronatus 4 Microtus subterraneus 3 Total 895\n\nLocal environmental conditions\n\nIn the VG site, the forest type was mainly deciduous (N = 41) with one mixed forest (including coniferous trees). In the ZA site, collections were performed in 33 deciduous forest type and eight mixed forests.

Median heads.day values at pasture was 112 for the 3 seasons (min = 0, max = 1848). Caprine were present along two transect-lines, equines along three transect-lines and ovine along three transect-lines. One meadow along a transect-line (VG-BD-L002) was occupied by the four livestock species.\n\nTable 15.\n\nLivestock Transect name Spring Summer Autumn Total bovineVG-BD-L0020322413 735 VG-BD-L0040056 56 VG-BD-L006420378378 1176 VG-BD-L01500168 168 VG-BD-L02000112 112 VG-BD-L032420378378 1176 VG-BD-L0330546364 910 VG-BD-L0340567637 1204 VG-BD-L03511216877 357 VG-BD-L03601260 126 VG-BD-L0445622456 336 VG-BD-L046021224 245 VG-BD-L0481407756 273 VG-BD-L0500322560 882 VG-BD-L06914714756 350 VG-BO-L105012656 182 VG-BO-L10900182 182 VG-BO-L11300161 161 VG-BO-L13600182 182 VG-BO-L1400560 56 VG-BO-L142011256 168 VG-BO-L1450056 56 VG-LF-L201147012601400 4130 VG-LF-L20218485670 2415 VG-LF-L2060021 21 VG-LF-L20712747421323 3339 VG-LF-L210210119126 455 VG-LF-L21513218821358 3561 total 7418 7140 8456 23014 caprineVG-BD-L002842184 189 VG-BO-L1450021 21 total 84 21 105 210 equineVG-BD-L00204263 105 VG-BD-L03304263 105 VG-BO-L1095600 56 total 56 84 126 266 ovineVG-BD-L0021050105 210 VG-BO-L1450021 21 VG-LF-L2075600 56 total 161 0 126 287\n\nPathogen results\n\nA selected subset of questing nymphs (N = 4518 I. ricinus) and 908 trapped small mammals (N = 300 in VG site and N = 608 in ZA site) were analysed for the three pathogenic agents: A. phagocytophilum, Borrelia spp. and Babesia spp. (Table ).\n\nTable 16.\n\nQuesting nymphs Small mammals Site Pathogens A. phagocytophilum Borrelia spp. Babesia spp. A. phagocytophilum Borrelia spp. VGn/N35/189147/189151/18910/3006/143Prev\n\n95%CI1.9\n\n[1.2-2.5]2.5\n\n[1.8-3.2]2.7\n\n[2.0-3.4]0.04.2\n\n[0.9-7.5]ZAn/N57/262778/262782/262742/60826/606Prev\n\n95%CI2.2\n\n[1.6-2.7]3.0\n\n[2.3-3.6]3.1\n\n[2.5-3.8]6.9\n\n[4.9-8.9]4.1\n\n[2.7-5.9]\n\nPathogen results in I. ricinus nymphs. A. phagocytophilum was detected, respectively in 1.9% and 2.2% of questing I. ricinus nymphs from VG and ZA. Six species of Borrelia (B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, B. valaisiana, B. spielmani, B. turdi or B. lusitaniae) were identified in nymphs in the two sites (Table ). Amongst the 51 positive I. ricinus nymphs for Babesia spp. in the VG site, 23 were identified as Babesia venatorum and 11 had non-specific sequences. Amongst the 82 positive I. ricinus nymphs in the ZA site, 13 were identified as B. venatorum, two as Babesia capreoli and eight had non-specific sequences.\n\nTable 17.\n\nSpecies VG ZA Borrelia afzelii 816Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto1513 Borrelia garinii 620 Borrelia valaisiana 1014 Borrelia spielmani 01Borrelia turdi or B. lusitaniae01Co-infection46Non exploitable sequence47 Total 47 78\n\nPathogen results in small mammals (Table ). A. phagocytophilum was not found in VG, but showed a prevalence of 6.9% in small mammals of ZA (Chastagner et al. 2016). Small mammals were infected only by B. afzelii with respective prevalences of 4.2% and 4.1% in VG and ZA. Amongst the six small mammals infected by Borrelia in the VG site, five were A. sylvaticus and one was M. glareolus. In the ZA site, amongst the 26 infected small mammals, 14 were A. sylvaticus, 11 were M. glareolus and one Microtus subterraneus (Perez et al. 2017). In the VG site, small mammals were not screened for Babesia spp. In the ZA site, one small mammal (M. glareolus, 2-ZA-CF-LM092-M3) amongst 597 tested was positive for Babesia (Jouglin et al. 2017).\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank the French National Research Agency, which funded the OSCAR project (ANR-11-AGRO-001-04).
