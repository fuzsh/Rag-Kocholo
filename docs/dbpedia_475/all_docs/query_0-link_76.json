        "text": "The front desk assistant here currently shares space with a giant snake. The sculpture, “Earth Eater” (2021), is a rainbow of stuffed textiles that starts on the floor with a mushy mouth, loops up over ceiling vents, then comes down and coils along a wall with the exhibition’s title: “Tura Oliveira: What a Glory to Be So Euphoric and Weak.”\n\nIf you don’t know Oliveira’s art, the snake is a good introduction: soft, vibrant, playful but with serious connotations. Her work is lush — and not just because she uses fabrics of all kinds, including quilts, velvet and tablecloths; her paintings have the same quality. Oliveira often depicts nude female figures consumed with pleasure or pain. They embrace, float, or fight in landscapes and scenes that are rendered in highly saturated hues and read as part mythical, part mystical.\n\nThe artist’s two previous solo shows in New York City were so concentrated with color, they felt almost psychedelic. The aesthetic at La MaMa is more relaxed, as Oliveira — who draws inspiration from science fiction, folklore and queer culture — leans into cyanotypes and loose, dyed imagery in muted tones. But the vibe is still abundant and cosmic, as an ox — the subject of an opening-night performance by the artist — cares for humans, and lovers meet in the stars. In Oliveira’s world, physicality offers a path to transcendence rather than bogging us down, and stories from the past can be a gateway to a radical future. JILLIAN STEINHAUER\n\nFor the last few years, Emily Furr has launched the sleek material of war and industry into the cosmos. She continues her enigmatic space program here: A lunar body teeters on the edge of an outsize scissor blade; crystals are penetrated with nails but never shatter, accepting the rigid hardware into their glassine cores. The eroticism is a bit on the nose but no less fun for it: A-bombs, rockets and pipes are vivisected to reveal their soft tissue, puckered like late-season tomatoes or incensed orifices. There’s a tug between masculine and feminine, mechanical and human, coolly phallic missiles and their fleshy yonic centers, which suggests balance, or at least parity in destruction; presumably, bombs that channel their feminine energies still explode upon impact.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
