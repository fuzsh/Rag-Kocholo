He studied painting at the Munich Academy of Art. In the early 1900s he traveled to Paris twice where he was influenced by Impressionism and the works of Van Gogh. He helped found the Blue Rider art movement in Germany and their journal. Marc developed a distinctive style using bold colors and simple depictions of animals. However, his career was cut short when he died in World War I at the age of 36.",
