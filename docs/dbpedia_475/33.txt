Quotes • In Paris, Marc said, “Like a roe deer in an enchanted forest, for which it has always yearned”, talking about a painting. • Marc was in depression for a while but he said his own “wavering, anxiety ridden spirit found peace at least in these marvelous paintings”. • Marc was killed by getting struck in the head with a shell splinter.
