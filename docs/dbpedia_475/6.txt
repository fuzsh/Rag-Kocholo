Original caption: "Germany. C. 1944-04. A German 'scarecrow' flare beginning to explode over Magdeburg. These flares are not apparently lethal but are designed to look like an aircraft falling in flames and distract aircrews of the attacking force."

Post Second World War, despite the testimony of Allied aircrew, it was confirmed that no such German scarecrow flare existed. The explosions were actually Allied aircraft (likely Lancaster or Halifax bombers) being shot down by Schrage Musik cannons mounted on German night fighters. In many cases, the belief in the scarecrow flare was genuine, and seems to have been perpetuated to reassure aircrews rather than acknowledge the number of aircraft being lost by this effective weapon.
