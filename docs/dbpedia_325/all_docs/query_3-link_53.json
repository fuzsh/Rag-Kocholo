In 2013, on the centenary of the first publication of Mineral Deposits, I had the opportunity to participate in a small field excursion to visit Lindgren's birthplace at Vassmolösa and some of the skarns that he had visited in southern Sweden ( Fig. 3.1). In retrospect, I was introduced to skarns before I even knew what rocks were. I encountered them in my introductory mineralogy class at Carleton College and I remember that some of the specimens of coarse bladed wollastonite and dodecahdral garnet were big and beautiful. So big that even I, as a complete novice, could identify them. ...\n\nContext 2\n\n... these are the rocks that will later be overprinted by large scale metasomatism and hydrothermal fluids, it is important to understand in some detail these early, largely metamorphic processes.

This in turn shifts the boundary between garnet-dominant and pyroxene-dominant parts of the skarn system. Thus, a reduced system that has both a reduced intrusion and reduced wall rocks will consist mostly of pyroxene, whereas an oxidised system will consist dominantly of garnet ( Fig. 3.7).

Tectonically, they tend to form in back arc basins with clastic-rich protoliths that are carbonaceous and hence reduced . The clastic-rich nature of the protolith leads to abundant hornfels in the metamorphic aureole, biotite hornfels in particular ( Fig. 3.8a,b). This is then overprinted by skarn as the alteration system expands (Fig. 8c).

Gold is in close physical association with Bi minerals such as bismuthinite and native bismuth, as is observed in all Au skarn deposits ( Fig. 3.9; Meinert, 1998). For any given deposit, the Au-rich zones tend to be in the distal, i.e. cooler parts of the system (Meinert, 1997).

These tools enable measurement of not just the composition of major daughter minerals in fluid inclusions, but also the metal content of the fluid phase itself (Fig. 3.11).

Numerical concentration in each picture is bulk element concentration in fluid inclusion (from Baker and Lang, 2003;Baker et al., 2004 with permission from the Geological Society of America). Skarn zonation models ( Fig. 3.12) and geochemical gradients can be used in exploring skarn systems that are buried or only partly exposed. For example, the Big Gossan Cu-Au skarn in the giant Ertsberg district, Irian Jaya (5.2 Gt at 1.13 % Cu, 0.92 g/t Au, 4.38 g/t Ag) is the highest grade skarn (2.7 % Cu, 1.0 g/t Au, 16.4 g/t Ag) in the district ( Leys et al., ...\n\nContext 45\n\n... Cu-Au skarn in the giant Ertsberg district, Irian Jaya (5.2 Gt at 1.13 % Cu, 0.92 g/t Au, 4.38 g/t Ag) is the highest grade skarn (2.7 % Cu, 1.0 g/t Au, 16.4 g/t Ag) in the district ( Leys et al., 2012). However, it was unclear at the time of discovery, which of several intrusions it was related to ( ). The skarn itself was classically zoned (Fig. 3.13) but the zonation did not point towards the adjacent Ertsberg Diorite, the presumed source of the hydrothermal fluids. The skarn minerals had high temperature and high salinity fluid inclusions ( Fig. 3.14) that suggested the source was not far away, so how could one analyse the skarn minerals to determine the direction and distance ...\n\nContext 46\n\n...

What causes the wide range of garnet colours, and the almost universal zonation from proximal red-brown garnet to distal pale garnet and dark green pyroxene? These and more are questions for the next generation of skarn researchers to tackle as I drive off to my retirement ( Fig. ...\n\nContext 49\n\n... National Research Council (2008) of the United States Academy of Sciences issued a comprehensive report on critical minerals with a simple graphic that allowed people to see easily the relationship between the risk and impact of supply disruption ( Fig. 6.2). This was followed by many other studies of critical minerals that extended the concepts (Fig. 6.3) and graphics, with axes for environmental and other considerations (Fig. 6.4). Illustration of the contributions of supply risk and impact of supply disruption to mineral criticality (National Research Council, 2008). In this qualitative diagram, mineral A has both a higher impact and higher risk of a supply disruption than mineral B. ...\n\nContext 50\n\n... would heat the ground inside a capture tent (Fig. 7.8), with cold traps that would condense the sublimated water vapour into containers (Sowers, 2018). The water would then be delivered to a central collection point for storage or shipment to a cislunar supply station, with only 17 % of the gravity of Earth to be overcome for the latter (e.g., Fig. 7.3). Similar solar heating of ice or phyllosilicate minerals on asteroids could also be used to liberate water from regolith and underlying rock. The almost nil gravity of small asteroids would require a slightly different approach to contain the water vapour.
