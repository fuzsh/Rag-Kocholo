        "text": "I am an Australian who grew up on the north coast of NSW, moving to Sydney at the age of 14. Following a doctorate in theoretical physics at the University of Sydney, I have had a 40-year career as an epidemiologist specializing in population health and global health statistics. I moved to Switzerland in 2000 and was responsible for the health statistics of the World Health Organization (WHO) for nearly 20 years. I have published over 140 peer-reviewed papers, as well as books and book chapters, and have been listed from 2014 to present in the Web of Science ‘highly cited researcher’ index, which recognizes the world’s most influential researchers over the past decade. If you want to know more about my professional work, google can help, or you can take look at https://colinmathers.com/.\n\nI have been a keen bushwalker, caver, canyoner and kayaker since university days, and have dabbled in rock climbing. When I came to Switzerland, I took up downhill skiing and alpine climbing also. I practiced traditional Japanese martial arts for almost 30 years, reaching the rank of 6th dan black belt in Japanese jujutsu. I competed as part of the Australian team at the 1995 World Jujutsu Championships and won a silver medal. Since 2015, I have been training and competing at national level in powerlifting and currently hold thirteen Swiss powerlifting records.\n\nFollowing my retirement from WHO in 2018, I continue to live in Geneva and have been doing some consulting on global health statistics as well as research on other topics of interest. I have practiced various forms of meditation for over thirty years now, including a period where I trained more intensively in Zen practice with Western and Japanese masters. Since retirement, I have been actively exploring states of consciousness through meditation, psychedelics, and other mind-body disciplines. Ultimately, my practices, analyses and scribbling are all a quixotic attempt to make sense of things, to understand the big picture and the nature of reality.\n\nI started this blog in 2014 mainly as a place where I could post about things of interest to me and use my writing to structure or order my thoughts on these subjects. The act of making a blog post public requires a rigor that keeping personal notes does not. Writing for a notional audience of interested strangers keeps me honest, forces me to research properly, to document data and sources and to justify my conclusions, not just leap to them and assume that they are justified, as is too easy to do. Whether or not the result is actually of interest to others is not the point. Unlike blogs focussed on a specific subject, I don’t expect many people to have the same range of rather odd interests I do. But the availability of a digital public archive of my thoughts and conclusions turns habits that would otherwise be time-wasters into something valuable. At minimum, they are a record that I can return to, and recently they have also been a source of inputs for various articles published elsewhere.\n\nI don’t really expect many others to read me, I am mainly writing as a discipline to assemble and summarize my thoughts — to explain myself to myself. And while I never set out to blog in the hopes of achieving a following or a brand, the act of publishing my own interests has helped people with similar interests to mine to find me — and vice versa. Some of these contacts have been very fruitful, and they are welcome.\n\nI have made several post series here on specific topics. These may be best read in order and links for the more interesting of these series can be found here.\n\nA list of selected books and articles published elsewhere is available <in preparation>.\n\n© Colin Douglas Mathers, 2023.
