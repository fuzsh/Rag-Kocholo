I have hopes for the pictures I have on my memory cards but I wanted to capture the moment in words and I am afraid I might lose it if I am disappointed by the pictures.\n\t\n\tAt the weekend I helped my friend Jonas move his little brothers new bed into  his apartment and I was rewarded with a new photography location. I had never been to the village of Arby before, the road winds through utterly flat fields before passing through a few farms then opens out to a beautiful view of an old stone bridge with a white church waiting beyond. \n\t\n\tThe stream that flows under the bridge meanders through  the landscape flanked on both sides by green fields and groves of trees full of small white flowers in full bloom, I chose to go there today at sunset when I hoped the light would be filtering through the trees. \n\t\n\tIt was that kind of atmosphere that makes you not care if you captured it on your sensor, warm golden light glowing across the green grass and white riot of flowers. You don't care if you didn't capture it simply because you were happy  that you saw it. A pristine flawless moment of wonder.  Kneeling down in the trees surrounded by delicate blooms that stretch away from you in all directions and all of it bathed in that almost hazy glow.  Your heart fills with a sense of happiness that isn't dependant on anything other than where you are and what you are seeing, and it lasts, you take a piece of it away with you. \n\t\n\tYou slip away quietly so as not to disturb the light that is weaving its spell on the landscape, you don't want to leave it but you don't want to see it fade into dusk. You want to hold on to that single pristine moment of wonder fix it in your mind and keep it safe in your head to produce a smile when you feel you need it the most. \n\t\n\tYours faithfully, a carpenter with the heart of a poet and the vocabulary and grammar of a 10 year old  :)\n\t\n\tIt was a beautiful place a beautiful time and there are many more photographs to be had there, I loved it",
