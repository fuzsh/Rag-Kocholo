        "text": "Frank Zappa, a composer, guitarist, band leader and producer who was rock's most committed iconoclast, died Saturday evening at his home in Los Angeles. He was 52 years old.\n\nThe cause was prostate cancer, The Associated Press reported.\n\nMr. Zappa was a quintessential 20th-century American composer, a maverick within popular music and an outsider among classical composers. His huge body of work -- more than 60 albums since 1966 -- embraces doo-wop, big-band suites, heavy metal, jazz-rock, blues-rock, orchestral music and every pop fad he decided to mock. The stage shows of his band, the Mothers of Invention (renamed Zappa after 1978), were renowned for precise musicianship and uninhibited, sometimes scatological humor.\n\nHis classical chamber and orchestral compositions have been conducted by Zubin Mehta and Pierre Boulez, and the Lyons Opera Ballet of France commissioned choreographers to create dances to his music. But as his instrumental music gained recognition, he gave up classical composition, he wrote in his 1989 autobiography, \"The Real Frank Zappa Book\" (Poseidon Press), because \"the incentive to continue was removed by having to deal with symphony orchestras.\" A Study in Contradictions\n\nMr. Zappa's work was uneven. He was praised for his sweeping eclecticism and his idiosyncratic balance between absolute control and a Dada esque celebration of the repressed. At the same time, his pieces were widely criticized for juvenile humor and for a cold, mechanical quality. From the beginning, he was an accomplished user of recording technology, creating sonic montages in the studio, and taping and filming many of his performances.\n\nMr. Zappa was an angry satirist, and some of his songs were topical and perishable. But even as his targets changed, his work through the years shows a consistent anger at complacency, inhibitions, slipshod thinking and self-delusion, inside and outside popular music, whether he was attacking hippie optimism on \"We're Only in It for the Money\" in 1967 or the censorious Parents' Music Resource Center on \"Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention\" in 1985.\n\nHis bands, the Mothers of Invention and Zappa, were schools for musicians. Mr. Zappa demanded hyperfast execution, as well as the ability to improvise and to shift idioms in a split-second. Former sidemen include the guitarist Lowell George and the bassist Roy Estrada, who founded Little Feat; Adrian Belew, who went on to play guitar with David Bowie, Talking Heads and King Crimson; Terry Bozzio, the drummer who founded Missing Persons, and the guitarist Steve Vai. In 1982, the single \"Valley Girl\" introduced Mr. Zappa's daughter Moon Unit, who made California slang nationally known.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
