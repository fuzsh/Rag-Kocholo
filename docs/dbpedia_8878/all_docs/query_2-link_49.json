        "text": "Frank Vincent Zappa (21 December 1940 – 4 December 1993) was an American musician, composer and satirist.\n\nOn a personal level, Freaking Out is a process whereby an individual casts off outmoded and restricting standards of thinking, dress, and social etiquette in order to express creatively his relationship to his immediate environment and the social structure as a whole.\n\nLiner notes for the album Freak Out! (27 June 1966).\n\nIf your children ever find out how lame you really are, they’ll murder you in your sleep.\n\nTo tourists at the Whisky-a-Go-Go, Los Angeles CA, December 1965\n\nLiner notes for the album Freak Out! (27 June 1966).\n\nDrop out of school before your mind rots from exposure to our mediocre educational system. Forget about the Senior Prom and go to the library and educate yourself if you've got any guts. Some of you like Pep rallies and plastic robots who tell you what to read. Forget I mentioned it. This song has no message. Rise for the flag salute.\n\nLiner notes for the album Freak Out! (27 June 1966).\n\nThe things that were happening in 1955 were cosmic … in terms of music history.\n\nInterview (5 March 1969), broadcast on Pop Chronicles, Show 14 - Big Rock Candy Mountain: Phil Spector & Frank Zappa review the '50s\n\nScientology, how about that? You hold on to the tin cans and then this guy asks you a bunch of questions, and if you pay enough money you get to join the master race. How's that for a religion?\n\nConcert address to audience at the Rockpile, Toronto (May 1969).\n\nI consider that the building materials are exactly the same as what anybody else makes the thing out of. It's just the way they look at those materials is perhaps a narrower perspective. Time and those waves are at the disposal of anyone who wants to use them.\n\nAs quoted in No Commercial Potential : The Saga of Frank Zappa (1972) by David Walley, p. 3.\n\nClassical musicians go to the conservatories, rock´n roll musicians go to the garages.\n\nInterview at Swedish Radio, programme Nightflite (circus 1980)\n\nI think it's really tragic when people get serious about stuff. It's such an absurdity to take anything really seriously … I make an honest attempt not to take anything seriously: I worked that attitude out about the time I was eighteen, I mean, what does it all mean when you get right down to it, what's the story here? Being alive is so weird.\n\nAs quoted in No Commercial Potential : The Saga of Frank Zappa (1972) by David Walley, p. 4.\n\nI think that if a person doesn't feel cynical then they're out of phase with the 20th century. Being cynical is the only way to deal with modern civilization — you can't just swallow it whole.\n\nThe Dub Room Special (1982).\n\nBeing interviewed is one of the most abnormal things that you can do to somebody else. It's two steps removed from the Inquisition.\n\nInterview on Channel 4 (June 1, 1983) - YouTube video\n\nI don't give a fuck if they remember me at all.\n\nInterview on Nationwide (7 January 1983) - YouTube video\n\nEvery socialistic type of government… produces bad art, produces social inertia, produces really unhappy people, and it's more repressive than any other kind of government.\n\nInterview, \"My Afternoon with Frank Zappa\", Larry Rogak, (New York writer and attorney) Zappa.com (May 8, 1980) [1]\n\nI'm probably more famous for sitting on the toilet than for anything else that I do.\n\nInterview on Nationwide (January 7, 1983).\n\nI'll tell you what classical music is, for those of you who don't know. Classical music is this music that was written by a bunch of dead people a long time ago. And it's formula music, the same as top forty music is formula music. In order to have a piece be classical, it has to conform to academic standards that were the current norms of that day and age … I think that people are entitled to be amused, and entertained. If they see deviations from this classical norm, it's probably good for their mental health.\n\nCocaine Decisions (1983)\n\nTheir stupidity does not amaze me, its when they're smart that amazes me. It's baffling whenever you find someone who's smart — incredible. Soon you'll have zoos for such things.\n\nWhen asked what amazes him about people, in an interview with Grace Slick on Rockplace (11 February 1984) - YouTube video\n\nA wise man once said, \"never discuss philosophy or politics in a disco environment.\"\n\nInterview with Grace Slick on Rockplace (11 February 1984).\n\nWhen God created Republicans, he gave up on everything else.\n\nAppearance on Thicke of the Night (28 April 1984).\n\nI like to watch the news, because I don't like people very much and when you watch the news... if you ever had an idea that people were really terrible, you could watch the news and know that you're right.\n\nAppearance on Thicke of the Night (28 April 1984).\n\nThe rock and roll business is pretty absurd, but the world of serious music is much worse.\n\nInterview on London Plus (24 September 1984) - YouTube video\n\nI have four children, and I want them to grow up in a country that has a working First Amendment.\n\nAppearance on CBS Morning News (18 September 1985) - YouTube video\n\nThe most important thing to do in your life is to not interfere with somebody else's life.\n\nIn response to Joe Walsh on The Howard Stern Show (1987).\n\nThe first thing you have to do if you want to raise nice kids, is you have to talk to them like they are people instead of talking to them like they're property.\n\nAppearance on The Howard Stern Show (1987).\n\nLet's not be too rough on our own ignorance; it's what makes America great!\n\nA appearance on The Tonight Show (29 June 1988)\n\nThe essence of Christianity is told to us in the Garden of Eden history. The fruit that was forbidden was on the Tree of Knowledge. The subtext is, All the suffering you have is because you wanted to find out what was going on. You could be in the Garden of Eden if you had just kept your fucking mouth shut and hadn't asked any questions.\n\nInterview in Playboy (2 May 1993).\n\nThe more boring a child is, the more the parents, when showing off the child, receive adulation for being good parents — because they have a tame child-creature in their house.\n\n\"Ben Watson interviews Frank Zappa\", in MOJO magazine (October 1993).\n\nRock journalism is people who can't write, interviewing people who can't talk, in order to provide articles for people who can't read.\n\n\"Ben Watson interviews Frank Zappa\", in MOJO magazine (October 1993).\n\nTake the Kama Sutra. How many people died from the Kama Sutra, as opposed to the Bible? Who wins?\n\nLate Night Special BBC (1993); the American version this documentary was presented on A&E Biography.\n\nTobacco is my favorite vegetable.\n\nInterview on the Today Show NBC (1993).\n\nMy solos are speech-influenced rhythmically; and harmonically, they're either pentatonic, or poly-scale oriented. And there's the mixolydian mode that I also use a lot...But I'm more interested in melodic things I think the biggest challenge when you go to play a solo is trying to invent a melody on the spot.\n\nAs quoted in The Guitar Handbook (2002) by Ralph Denyer, p. 102\n\nTo me, absurdity is the only reality.\n\nAs quoted a review of This door is too small (for a bear) (2010)\n\nWell I think that progress is not possible without deviation. And I think that it's important that people be aware of some of the creative ways in which some of their fellow men are deviating from the norm, because in some instances they might find these deviations inspiring and might suggest further deviations which might cause progress, you never know.\n\nAs quoted in Frank Zappa, a VPRO documentary, directed by Roelof Kiers, Aired February 11, 1971; transcript, video\n\nIt's time for a revolution, but probably not in the terms that people imagine it. The word seems to conjure up images of— sort of a modern day version of peasants going into the street with their pitch forks to go after the bad guy who lives in a big house someplace on a hill and we're gonna get that son-of-a-bitch and we'll take all the stuff away from him and we'll give it to the workers, you know. And that's not the kind of revolution I had in mind. ... Well, I thought that it might be nice if it was handled a little bit more modern and efficient way, without people getting slaughtered in the street. It's a matter of infiltration.\n\nAs quoted in Frank Zappa, a VPRO documentary, directed by Roelof Kiers, Aired February 11, 1971; transcript, video\n\nRecorded March 9–12, 1966, released 27 June 1966\n\nSo I'm watchin' and I'm waitin'\n\nHopin' for the best\n\nEven think I'll go to prayin'\n\nEvery time I hear 'em sayin'\n\nThat there's no way to delay\n\nThat trouble comin' every day\n\nNo way to delay\n\nThat trouble comin' every day\n\n\"Trouble Every Day\".\n\nHey, you know something people?\n\nI'm not black,\n\nBut there's a whole lots a times\n\nI wish I could say I'm not white.\n\n\"Trouble Every Day\".\n\nAnd it's the same across the nation\n\nBlack and white discrimination\n\nYellin' \"You can't understand me!\"\n\n'N all that other jazz they hand me\n\nIn the papers and TV and\n\nAll that mass stupidity\n\nThat seems to grow more every day\n\nEach time you hear some nitwit say\n\nHe wants to go and do you in\n\nBecause the color of your skin\n\nJust don't appeal to him\n\n(No matter if it's black or white)\n\nBecause he's out for blood tonight.\n\n\"Trouble Every Day\"\n\nRecorded 1969 - 1973, Released 7 September 1973\n\nI may be vile and pernicious\n\nBut you can't look away\n\nI make you think I'm delicious\n\nWith the stuff that I say\n\nI'm the best you can get\n\nHave you guessed me yet?\n\nI'm the slime oozin' out\n\nFrom your TV set.\n\n\"I'm the Slime\"\n\nRecorded 1969 - 1974, Released 22 March 1974\n\nWatch out where the huskies go,\n\nand don't you eat that yellow snow.\n\n\"Don't Eat The Yellow Snow\".\n\nLook here brother, who you jivin' with that cosmik debris?\n\n\"Cosmik Debris\"\n\nRecorded 8 - 10 December 1973, 8 & 11 May 1974; Released 10 September 1974\n\nJazz is not dead, it just smells funny.\n\n'Be-Bop Tango (Of the Old Jazzmen's Church)\n\nFrank Zappa: I would say the illusion [of freedom] will continue as long as it's profitable to continue the illusion. At the point where the illusion becomes too expensive to maintain they will just take down the scenery, they will pull back the curtains, they will move all the tables and chairs out of the way, and you will see the brick wall at the back of the theatre.\n\nZappa, Frank. Interview with Jim Ladd. \"Zappa On Air.\" April 1977.\n\nYou're an asshole! You're an asshole!\n\nThat's right!\n\nYou're an asshole! You're an asshole!\n\nYes yes!\n\n\"Broken Hearts are for Assholes\"\n\nInformation is not knowledge. Knowledge is not wisdom. Wisdom is not truth. Truth is not beauty. Beauty is not love. Love is not music. Music is the best…\n\n\"Packard Goose\"\n\n\"A Conversation With Frank Zappa\" by Dave Rothman, in Oui (April 1979)\n\nYou know, people are basically shitty. It’s when they prove it over and over again that it gets obnoxious.\n\nWe live in a very special time right now. At no other time in history has there been such mass disillusionment in terms of reliance on governing functions. Most people don’t want to come to terms with that. It’s been proven over and over again that the emperor isn’t wearing any clothes, but most people don’t like to look at naked emperors. In the process of turning around to avert their eyes, they saw the discotheques and a few other things and latched onto them.\n\nThere’s no reason to assume that my idea of what‘s better would really be better. I resent it when other people try to inflict their ideas of betterness on me. I don’t think they know. And I can’t see any authority on the horizon that’s got any answers that seem worthwhile. Most of the things that are suggested are probably detrimental to your mental health.\n\nOrganized religions by their very natures are misleading. The bottom line is always money. What that’s got to do with your spiritual well-being still eludes me. It’s always the bucks, no matter how they disguise it. If you need that sort of assistance to keep yourself together, you may be paying a higher rate to a fake religion than you would to a psychotherapist. Which is not to say that a psychotherapist is going to give you any better value per dollar either. lf you’re going to deal with reality, you’re going to have to make one big discovery: Reality is something that belongs to you as an individual. If you wanna grow up, which most people don’t, the thing to do is take responsibility for your own reality and deal with it on your own terms. Don’t expect that because you pay some money to somebody else or take a pledge or join a club or run down the street or wear a special bunch of clothes or play a certain sport or even drink Perrier water, it’s going to take care of everything for you. Because it all comes from inside. As a matter of fact, that’s where it stays.\n\nCertification from one source or another seems to be the most important thing to people all over the world. A piece of paper from a school that says you’re smart, a pat on the head from your parents that says you’re good or some reinforcement from your peers that makes you think what you’re doing is worthwhile. People are just waiting around to get certified.\n\nThe lifestyle that I have is probably neither desirable nor useful to most people. Most people are probably better off getting the certification they desire and spindling their lives away the way they’re doing. I don’t think they’d enjoy living any other way. There are millions of people who acquire all sorts of wonderful feelings from watching a football game and drinking a bottle of beer. It makes them really happy. Doesn’t do shit for me. But for them it’s life itself. As long as they can believe in the beer and the football, then they’ve really got something. And it’s probably more useful to them than religion. So why take it away? Why tell them what’s really going on? Let ’em be happy.\n\nIf a person wants to write music and lyrics, he has a perfect right to express his views on a certain subject. I would feel wrong if I were to express anything that I didn’t believe in. I write what I like to write. Those who like to listen to it, listen to it. And the ones who don’t, watch football and drink beer, jog, go to discos and so forth. I never claimed to be a man for all seasons.\n\nJust because somebody hears something you say, or reads something that you write, doesn’t mean you’ve reached them. With reading comprehension being what it is in the U. S., you can safely toss that one out the window. If you want to judge by the listening habits of people who buy records, the first thing they do is put it on and talk over it.\n\nSo much gets lost in the translation. Even if you sat there listening to it with a microscope, there’s no way you’re gonna find out what it means.\n\nPeople have preposterous ideas about what those songs are about and what the music means. They start spouting all this shit that’s so far off the mark, it’s revolting. But if that’s how they derive pleasure, who am I to deprive them of it? Let ’em enjoy it. It’s there for their edification. But total comprehension is out of the question.\n\nI can’t talk to you about music because you don’t know anything about music. I can talk to you about politics or sociology and all that peripheral stuff, but I can’t talk to you about music. There’s not enough information in common that I could say to you so you’d be able to understand. Besides, the people who read OUI don’t give a fuck about music anyway.\n\nThe cool-person syndrome is peculiarly American. Part of that has to do with the way the educational business is run in the U.S. It’s not based on how much you can teach your child: it’s based on how much money the suppliers of basic materials can make off your child. Somewhere along the line most people pick up the desire to be a cool person, which is just another way to make them buy things. Once you’ve decided that you need to be a cool person, it makes you a possible victim of anyone whose products are the equivalent of bottled smoke. Somebody tells you to buy this particularly useless item and you’ll be a cool person. No matter how stupid it seems, you have to buy it. Pet Rocks. Pringle’s potato chips. whatever it is — the newest, the latest. Since the cool-person thing is something you learn in school, and since the school business is pretty suspicious and definitely tied up with the government, it makes you wonder whether or not the desire to be cool is part of a government plot to make you buy stupid things.\n\nThe U.S. is a mere pup tent of a civilization. We’ve got two hundred years of stupidity behind us and we think we’re right up there with everyone else who’s been doing it for thousands of years.\n\nThe richest people in the world aren’t particularly smart or happy. And the happiest people in the world aren’t particularly smart or rich.… That leaves me making music. But we can’t talk about that.\n\nEverything on this planet has something to do with music. Music functions in the realm of sculptured air. Polluted as our atmosphere might be, air is the thing that makes music work. Since all other things that occur in the sound domain are transmitted to the ear through that swirling mass, depending on how wide you want to make your definition, you could perceive quite a bit of human experience in terms of music.\n\nI think the music of the Fifties is really good. I suspect it’s much better musically than much of what’s available now. Not in terms of production, but in terms of content. One good believable song about some guy’s girlfriend and how they broke up — a sincere one — is better than twenty albums of English rock that’s ever been produced.\n\nMost people don’t think I’m rational. They’re too busy featuring their hurt. They find it irrational not to feature your hurt. That’s how fucked up they are.\n\nThere isn’t anything weird about my music. Weird is a skeleton in the closet, wearing a rubber mask with warts all over its nose, and all that kind of shit. That’s not what I do. The thing that makes my music unusual is that people only hear one kind of music all the time over the radio. It’s wallpaper to their lives. Audile wallpaper. There’s one acceptable beat and there are three acceptable chord progressions. There are five acceptable words: baby, love, tears, yat yat. Just because I don’t deal in those terms doesn’t mean I’m weird. So tell these people: I ain’t weird; I’m rational. I’m a person who can choose to write stuff like that, or choose to write stuff that includes all the notes on the piano played at once, followed by a cement truck driving over the piano, followed by a small atomic explosion. Nothing weird about that as long as you do it in a meaningful way.\n\n\"Frank Zappa, self-styled mocker of mankind\" by Clint Roswell, in New York Daily News (September 30, 1979)\n\nMusic is the only religion that delivers the goods. All music is good. It fulfills a social function. It's like wallpaper to your lifestyle. It defines what you are.\n\nI love the guitar, always have. I can relate to it a lot better than a saxophone.\n\nI don't do drugs, nor have I ever believed in them. Am I a creative person? Then why do people think in order to be creative one must do drugs? Actually, I think people take them as an excuse to screw up in public, y'know, spill things or get silly. Drugs have slowed down civilization because we have to wait for people to get off their high before we can resume. They are the millstone around society's neck.\n\nI have an important message to deliver to all the cute people all over the world. If you're out there and you're cute, maybe you're beautiful. I just want to tell you somethin' — there's more of us UGLY MOTHERFUCKERS than you are, hey-y, so watch out.\n\n\"Dance Contest\"\n\nRecorded July - September, 1980, released 23 September 1981\n\nBeauty is a pair of shoes that makes you wanna die.\n\nBeauty Knows No Pain.\n\nWhoever we are, wherever we're from We shoulda noticed by now, our behavior is dumb.And if our chances expect to improve. It's gonna take a lot more, than trying to remove the other race.Or the other whatever, from the face of the planet altogether.\n\nDumb All Over\n\nYou can't run a country by a book of religion. Not by a heap or a lump or a smidgen. Of foolish rules of ancient date. Designed to make you all feel great. While you fold, spindle and mutilate.Those unbelievers from a neighboring state.\n\nDumb All Over\n\nTO ARMS! TO ARMS! Hooray! That's great! Two legs ain't bad unless there's a crate. They ship the parts to mama for souvenirs: two ears -- Get Down!\n\nDumb All Over\n\nThe Good Book says: \"It's gotta be that way!\" But their book says: \"REVENGE THE CRUSADES!!!!... After all, he wrote this book here, and in the book it says he made us all to be just like him! So if we're dumb, then God is dumb — and maybe even a little ugly on the side.\n\nDumb All Over\n\nRemember there's a big difference between kneeling down and bending over.\n\n\"Heavenly Bank Account\".\n\nThere are three things that smell of fish. One of them is fish. The other two are growing on you!\n\n\"Jumbo Go Away\".\n\nYou say your life's a bum deal 'n yer up against the wall. Well, people, you ain't even got no deal at all. 'Cause what they do in Washington. They just takes care of Number One. An' Number One ain't you. You ain't even Number Two!\n\n\"The Meek Shall Inherit Nothing\"\n\nShes a valley girl\n\nIn a clothing store\n\nOkay, fine...\n\nFer sure, fer sure.\n\n\"Valley Girl\" (co-written with Moon Zappa).\n\nOn Ventura, there she goes\n\nShe just bought some bitch'n clothes\n\nTosses her head n flips her hair\n\nShe got a whole bunch of nothin in there\n\n\"Valley Girl\"\n\nAppearance on Crossfire, CNN (1986) - YouTube video\n\nI think that if you use the so-called \"strong words\" you'll get your point across faster and you can save a lot of beating around the bush. Why are people afraid of words?

It's moving America toward a fascist theocracy, and everything that's happened during the Reagan administration is steering us right down that pipe … I really think that. … When you have a government that prefers a certain moral code derived from a certain religion and that moral code turns into legislation to suit one certain religious point of view, and if that code happens to be very, very right wing, almost toward Attila the Hun...\n\n1988 interview by Kurt Loder for Rolling Stone Magazine, republished in Loder's book \"Bat Chain Puller\" Loder, Kurt (2002).

And the reason I did was because, since I do smoke, people would say, \"Here, smoke this, you'll get high.\" So I smoked it, and it gave me a sore throat and made me sleepy. And I must either presume that that's what high means, or something was wrong. But I've never had a positive result from smoking marijuana. It just wasn't my cup of tea. And I never used LSD, never used cocaine, never used heroin or any of that other stuff.\n\nCo-written with Peter Occhiogrosso\n\nFor the record, folks; I never took a shit on stage and the closest I ever came to eating shit anywhere was at a Holiday Inn buffet in Fayetteville, North Carolina, in 1973.\n\np. 14.\n\nThe bassoon is one of my favorite instruments.

Civics was a class that used to be required before you could graduate from high school. You were taught what was in the U.S. Constitution. And after all the student rebellions in the '60s, civics was banished from the student curriculum and was replaced by something called social studies. Here we live in a country that has a fabulous constitution and all these guarantees, a contract between the citizens and the government - nobody knows what's in it. It's one of the best kept secrets. And so, if you don't know what your rights are, how can you stand up for them? And furthermore, if you don't know what is in that document, how can you care if someone is shredding it? transcript\n\nQuotes of Zappa in W. C. Privy's Original Bathroom Companion (2003) by Jack Mingo and Erin Barrett, p. 134\n\n[Note: the below quotations do not appear in the W.C. Privy book. Zen Master: The Wisdom of Frank Zappa does not appear to exist.]\n\nArt is making something out of nothing and selling it.[not in citation given]\n\nThere are more love songs than anything else. If songs could make you do something, we'd all love one another.[not in citation given]\n\nThe United States is a nation of laws: badly written and randomly enforced.[not in citation given]\n\nCommunism doesn't work because people like to own stuff.[not in citation given]\n\nFact of the matter is, there is no hip world, there is no straight world. There's a world, you see which has people in it who believe a variety of different things. Everybody believes in something and everybody, by virtue of the fact that they believe in something, use that something to support their own existence.[not in citation given]\n\nRecorded 9–12 March 1966, released 5 December 2006\n\nThe '60s was really stupid … It was a type of merchandising, Americans had this hideous weakness, they had this desire to be OK, fun guys and gals, and they haven't come to terms with the reality of the situation: we were not created equal. Some people can do carpentry, some people can do mathematics, some people are brain surgeons and some people are winos and that's the way it is, and we're not all the same. This concept of one world-ism, everything blended and smoothed out to this mediocre norm that everybody downgrades themselves to be is stupid. The '60s was merchandised to the public at large... My pet theory about the '60s is that there is a sinister plot behind it... The lessons learnt in the '60s about merchandising stupidity to the American public on a large scale have been used over and over again since that time.\n\n\"My Pet Theory\" on the second disc of the twin CD version\n\nPeople close to Zappa told me there was a good chance he could be diagnosed as manic-depressive if \"they\" ever got a chance to look at him. There was no way I could know if he'd have the patience to give me one minute or one hour. Expect anything, they said. Radical mood swing is the core of Zappa’s personality — and no doubt the core of his creativity as well.\n\nWhen I knocked on Frank’s door, he opened it with the slightest possible shred of acknowledgment. No handshake. I knew immediately where his mood swing was at the moment – several fathoms below sea level. That long black cloud was down and was there to stay for the duration of our first interview. His disdain for the ‘interrogation,’ as he called it, remained obvious. On our next encounter, the cloud disappeared and Zappa lightened up, rapping casually with fans who wandered in, and generally enjoying himself. Surprisingly, the results of both sessions were somehow consistent: Laced in with Zappa’s unrelenting cynicism, the hilarity was always there — regardless of what mood he was in. The only difference seemed to be whether or not he was laughing.\n\nDave Rothman, in \"A Conversation With Frank Zappa\", in Oui (April 1979)\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:"
