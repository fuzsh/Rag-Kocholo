In the background. Stevie Nicks? On there. Patti LaBelle? Yep.\n\n“Yeah. It’s quite possible,” Martin, 73, said. “It’s funny. There’s a guy that I started working for about 15 years ago up in Canada, and it happened so many times that he started saying anything you ask about in music, chances are Robert knows that person or played with them or recorded with them.\n\n“Being versatile made it really easy for me to work as a touring musician. When I made the shift from Philly to LA, in Philly, I was primarily doing studio work and recording, I was primarily known as a French Horn player. And I kept trying to convince them, ‘Hey, look, man, I can sing, I can play keyboards. I can do all these other things.’ They said, ‘Shut up, play your French.’\n\n“Then I came out here and the inroads that I began to make right off the bat were more in terms of live performance, which led to touring. And I kind of broke into that circle more so than the LA session work circle, which is again what I was doing back in Philly. So being versatile and playing a bunch of things, people could hire me for a tour and not have to hire, like, three other guys.”\n\nThat versatility led the legendary Frank Zappa to ask Martin to join his touring band in 1981. He fit right in with a leader who can best be described as eclectic.\n\n“That’s me, too,” said Martin, who will be visiting the Ardmore Music Hall on June 22 with other members of Frank Zappa’s band for a show dedicated to the Rock & Roll Hall of Famer’s musical library.\n\n“Really, it’s true of pretty much everybody that’s ever been in the band. As far as I know, you had to be able to play everything. Not just sort of fake it through, you know, some kind of country feel or jazz feel or even polka or whatever classical. You had to do it authentically and change on a dime because that would happen often, spontaneously, and just be able to cover all those things in a natural and comfortable and authentic way. So, it’s kind of was par for the course.”\n\nOther members of The Zappa Band playing in Ardmore are Mike Keneally (25 when he joined Frank Zappa’s band in 1987), guitarist/vocalist Ray White, bass guitarist Scott Thunes, drummer Joe Traver and guitarist Jamie Kime.\n\nThe band had such a successful string as the opening act for King Crimson, they decided to go out on their own solo tour.\n\n“So, yeah, it’s, it’s just a gas to be able to continue to play this music with these guys,” Martin said. “And, there’s still a market. I mean, fans still love it. And what’s really interesting is doing these kind of things, playing these concerts now, all these years later, I’ve had the pretty remarkable experience of encountering fans that used to come to shows in the 80s, bringing their kids. So, cool. And introducing the next generation to this amazing music.”\n\nMartin grew up in a music family. His parents were opera singers and he attended the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.\n\n“Check this out, this is how (his parents) met,” said Martin. “They had the opposite lead roles in the 1939 Philadelphia Cosmopolitan Opera Company production of Gilbert and Sullivan’s ‘The Mikado.’ My mom was Yum-Yum. And my dad was Nanki-Poo. They were the two male and female lead roles. And they they met doing that show. And in the show their characters married and they got married in real life. So, it’s one of those classic kind of, you know, showbiz stories.\n\n“So I grew up with some really, really major advantages in terms of becoming a musician.\n\n“First of all, I didn’t get pushback from them. They didn’t push me into it. They didn’t push me away from it. They encouraged me to do what I loved to do, which was music from a very early age. And and in addition to that, the influences that I got from, from their tastes and then listening to music, the first piece of music I ever identified in life and used to ask my mom to put on the old RCA Victrola, the big old thing with the crank that played 70 or 78 RPM records.\n\n“The first piece I ever identified was Stravinsky’s ‘Firebird.’ I loved that piece. It was so, to me it was just visual, like crazy. I mean, you would hear that and you could just imagine what what was going on just by hearing those sounds. And that was that.”\n\nMartin has seen the changes in the music industry over the years.\n\n“We got the best of both worlds now because digital recording direct a disc,” Martin said. “For one thing, you can play it a thousand, 10,000, 100,000 times and there’s no deterioration. It’s all zeros and ones. It’s not tape scraping past a metal playback head or record head, thus deteriorating the tape every single pass a little bit. That doesn’t happen anymore. So that disadvantage of analog is gone. And we’ve learned again to emulate the sound of what’s going on in such an accurate way that we do have really the best of both worlds.”\n\nAll those worlds have come together for Martin, who was also a member of the band The Orleans in the 1970s. The new tour begins June 11.\n\n“When when I was touring in the ’80s, I didn’t just tour with Frank,” Martin said. “Getting that gig with Frank opened doors for me like crazy because from that point on, I would get invited to join a tour and join a band because you have a reputation as if you could pass a Zappa audition. People knew you were bad ass.\n\n“So that was that enabled me to do a lot of other tours with a lot of other top stars, which I thoroughly enjoyed as well. I mean, you know, they, the Zappa touring was, I would say, by far the most challenging in many aspects. But again, as we were talking about before, just all these different styles were lots of fun to do.”\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nThe Zappa Band will be performing at the Ardmore Music Hall, 23 E.
