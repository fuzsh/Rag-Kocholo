        "text": "Often celebrated as one of the most innovative and iconoclastic musicians to ever hit the airwaves, Frank Zappa was a creator unlike any other. His art and legacy continue to endure long after his untimely death more than two decades ago, honored posthumously with a Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction and Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Influencing a number of artists and garnering a dedicated fanbase along the way, Zappa certainly left his mark—and, as his 1989 memoir proved, he had no shortage of stories to tell.\n\nNow, in what may be one of the most meaningful testaments to his memory thus far, Frank Zappa’s autobiography, The Real Frank Zappa Book, has arrived in audio for the first time ever with Zappa’s son, Ahmet, narrating his father’s story. We spoke with Zappa to ask about the recording process, his father’s legacy, and his own favorite listens.\n\nAudible: Your father, legendary musician Frank Zappa, is remembered as much for his nonconformity, cynicism, and satirical edge as his inventive, complex compositions. What was it about his approach that you think appealed to so many?\n\nAhmet Zappa: He never backed down from speaking his truth, and oftentimes his answers were hilarious—they were biting. I think people responded to his level of musicality, creativity, and honesty.\n\nDid you learn anything new about yourself or your father’s life and legacy through recording this audiobook? What do you hope listeners glean from hearing his story?\n\nYes. It was incredibly cathartic and healing in many ways for me to perform the book, especially the parts about parenting—lots of what to do’s, and what not to do’s, in that department. I hope when people listen to the book, they can appreciate that Frank was completely one of a kind, a true Italian American composer, a rock and roll Nostradamus, and just an extraordinary mind.\n\nWas there a particular story or moment recalled in this book that resonated with you as you read it aloud?\n\nAll of it. I think the book is incredibly relevant for today’s readers. His points of view on politics, the music industry, and life in general are as true today as they were when this book was published more than 30 years ago.\n\nIn addition to your work as a musician and author of fiction for young listeners, you host your own music podcast, Rocktails. Did you find narrating your father’s memoir was at all comparable to recording that show, or was it entirely new ground?\n\nRocktails is a totally different animal. I don’t feel any pressure whatsoever doing that show, whereas it was an intensely pressure-filled, emotionally challenging process reading The Real Frank Zappa Book. I feel like I’ve done my father proud, and I hope listeners enjoy it.\n\nMemoirs written by musicians make for a fascinating listening experience, as they explore both an artist’s personal life and creative process. Do you have any favorites that you recommend for listeners of The Real Frank Zappa Book?\n\nI love music autobiographies, and I consume them on a regular basis. Here are my top picks because they’re narrated by the authors themselves: Last Chance Texaco: Chronicles of an American Troubadour by Rickie Lee Jones; Lonely Boy by Steve Jones; The Gospel According to Luke by Steve Lukather; What Does This Button Do? by Bruce Dickinson; and Me by Elton John.\n\nAnother honorable mention is Runnin’ with the Devil by Noel Monk, narrated by Fred Berman, and a particular favorite is 18 and Life on Skid Row by Sebastian Bach. That is one of the more interesting ones because of his added “bonus modes.” Trust me, it’s worth the listen."
