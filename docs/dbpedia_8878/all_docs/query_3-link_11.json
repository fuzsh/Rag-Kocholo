        "text": "Frank Zappa, at his best, was in a league of his own. He took contemporary classical music - he was a fan of Varese - jazz, doowop, wah-wah driven guitar rock and even burlesque, and synthesized it into something far beyond the creative or musical reaches of the vast majority of people in the world of rock. He also had a biting satirical wit, which is present in many of his lyrics, from his album \"Freak Out\" onwards.\n\nHe did produce some shite, too, but he was so prolific, and his good stuff far, far outweighs the bad.\n\nAs a guitarist, he was much more than a virtuoso technician: he had a distinctive musical sensibility too, which is why he would always cut Steve Vai when they played together on stage.\n\nAs for the question of whether Mike or Stone could play Zappa's riffs, well, I'm sure Mike could have a good go at Willie the Pimp or The Gumbo Variations!\n\n0\n\njosevolution wrote:\n\nwhat he was a musical genius at the least or a music GOD ......\n\nA genius with a killer wit.\n\nWhen I was young (too young), I was married to a musician. He loved Frank Zappa and I couldn't not stomach it, especially \"St. Alphonso's Pancake Breakfast.\" It grated me. Then one day we got stuck in a huge traffic jam and he put Apostrophe in and said \"just listen, just really listen.\" There was nothing better to do, so I opened my mind to it and OMG. Zappa is a GENIUS. St. Alphonso's is musically brilliant and a biting satire.\n\nBefore you write Zappa off, give these albums a chance:\n\nApostrophe\n\nJoe's Garage (free speech!)\n\nThe Mother Fillmore East June 1971\n\nSheik Yerbouti\n\nTruly excellent music can be difficult to get into at first. This is why pop music is so catchy and accessible and yet we get sick of it so fast. Twenty years after my introduction to Zappa I'm still hearing something new when I listen to it. It's that rich.\n\nThere was no ox that the man wouldn't gleefully gore. You think EV has a sense of humor? Give Zappa a chance.\n\nETA: I wouldn't compare him to Pearl Jam, the music is entirely different. PJ is thoughtful and earnest with a lot of emotion. Zappa was diabolical.\n\nThe kids of today should defend themselves against the Seventies Nineties.\n\n0\n\nsnipes824 wrote:\n\nI He told me before that Pearl Jam could not play any Frank Zappa songs. He said they couldn't even read his music. Obviously I left the room because it was so ludicrus for someone to say that.\n\nMy question to you is this: Is Frank Zappa really that good? I admittedly don't know how good he really is. But Mike or Stone can't play his riffs? I hardly think thats accurate.\n\nI've got to respond to this. I'm sure Mike and Stone could hold their own on most of Zappa's music, if they wanted to. I'm sure Eddie's a better singer, for that matter. It's cool that your roommate appreciates Zappa but there's no need for him to get all snobby about it.\n\nThe kids of today should defend themselves against the Seventies Nineties.\n\n0\n\nJOEJOEJOE wrote:\n\nyou left the room, instead of asking for further explanation?\n\nZappa was a genuis, but a misunderstood genius. He was a true artist, but he wasn't for everyone.\n\nThe only person who comes close to him these days is PRINCE, in terms of composing and arranging music.\n\nhaha i didnt really leave the room at first. he was just going off and practically yelling about how superior Frank Zappa is to everyone. He told me Zappa plays Zappa is touring again and i was like \"oh goody cant wait\" as a joke. I was like thats like me going to see Ten play. They are a cover band of Zappas music (even though it has a lot of his old bandmates). It would be like me seeing PJ without ed. And he flipped out and said how Pearl Jam can't touch Zappa and so forth and that Mike or Stone couldn't read, let alone play, his music. So i came here for some insight because i really dont know anything about zappa.\n\n0\n\nThe Mothers' third album, We're Only In It For the Money, is one of my favorites of all time.\n\n\"Hi boys and girls I'm Jimmy Carl Black and I'm the Indian of the group\"\n\nJWBusher wrote:\n\nPearl Jam couldn't read or pull off Frank's music.\n\nnobody could\n\n2000: Camden 1, 2003: Philly, State College, Camden 1, MSG 2, Hershey, 2004: Reading, 2005: Philly, 2006: Camden 1, 2, East Rutherford 1, 2007: Lollapalooza, 2008: Camden 1, Washington D.C., MSG 1, 2, 2009: Philly 1, 2, 3, 4, 2010: Bristol, MSG 2, 2011: PJ20 1, 2, 2012: Made In America, 2013: Brooklyn 2, Philly 2, 2014: Denver, 2015: Global Citizen Festival, 2016: Philly 2, Fenway 1, 2018: Fenway 1, 2, 2021: Sea.

The music didn't sound like anything I haven't heard before. I guess I was wrong so get off your high horse.\n\nSorry. In all fairness, I'm sure there are quite a few Zappa songs that Pearl Jam could play. Your friend was just being a prick. Frank Zappa released about 100 albums that range from simple rock to doo-wop to jazz to classical music to music played on a computer to improvisation to fucked up bizarre music that has no definition and is very difficult to play. There aren't many bands that could re-create much of it. Frank's music is so varied, there are charts on the internet to help guide people who are interested in certain aspects of his music.\n\n0\n\nI have about 17 zappa albums (all burned for me by an obsessive friend) and my thoughts are as follows: I have a lot of respect for zappa as a musician and composer. he was a fantastic guitarist and even better at creating and directing music. I personally dont find his style of humour to be to my taste but I love the mothers of invention's social satire. I'm more of a fan of Captain Beefheart to be honest.\n\n\"I remember one night at Muzdalifa with nothing but the sky overhead, I lay awake amid sleeping Muslim brothers and I learned that pilgrims from every land — every colour, and class, and rank; high officials and the beggar alike — all snored in the same language\"\n\n0\n\nHe was a musical genius.\n\nBut way too caught up in trying to show how smart he was when he composed things and seemed to completely forget about accessible. Too cute for his own good, and too much ego to surround himself with a musical foil who had a more common touch.\n\n“One good thing about music,\n\nwhen it hits you, you feel to pain.\n\nSo brutalize me with music.”\n\n~ Bob Marley\n\n0\n\nWHoo haaa.. You are talking about one of my favourite people in the whole world. RIP Frank!\n\nFrank is/was in a league of his own. Music is just not the same as any other.\n\nI love PJ but you just can't compare Frank and the Mothers.\n\nTry to get a copy of the FZ flick Baby Snakes. Ya wanna see twisted sense of humour.\n\nDinah-Moe-Hum!!!\n\n\"I wrote a song about dental floss but did anyone's teeth get cleaner?\" Senate Hearing on Porn Rock (1985) in response to Tipper Gore's allegations that music incites people towards deviant behavior, or influences their behavior in general\n\nF Zappa (December 21, 1940 – December 4, 1993)\n\n0"
