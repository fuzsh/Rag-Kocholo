        "text": "Frank Zappa deserves admission to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a great guitarist, songwriter, creator of concept albums, comedian, talent scout, doo wop expert, social critic and avid misanthrope. The Hall has already honored several of each, but Frank Zappa stands unique as the first inductee who also had a substantial career as a composer and performer of “serious” modem music.\n\nHis greatest importance to rock history was in bringing all these talents to bear at once. Not content to create a rock band with the chops and discipline to play 12-tone rows, he also created modernist works that incorporated “Louie Louie.”\n\nEarly in his career, Zappa co-wrote the Penguins’ “Memories of el Monte,” a classic West Coast doo-wop record and an evocation of an entire period in pop history."
