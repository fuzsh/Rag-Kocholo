        "text": "Here's an interesting take on the roots of jazz (and other modern popular forms), which puts emphasis on the often neglected influence of the \"tribal\" traditions of Northern and Eastern Europe:\n\nI admit that there are rock elements in that solo as well. The rhythm and the fact that he is not playing over anything that can be considered a strong typical jazz harmonic base does not help. However, the jazz elements that I stated are there...just play the solo and you will see what I mean. The solo and most of his solos are mostly based on development of themes from different modes....along the lines of what is going on in Kind of Blue.\n\nSo you folks think it does not sound like jazz at all and that is your opinion. However, I wonder what you would think if the solo was played on the saxophone. I am betting you would say thats jazz. I may be wrong."
