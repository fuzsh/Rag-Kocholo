        "text": "Frank Zappa Biography\n\nThe Mothers of Invention were a California-based American rock group. Their work, which dates back to 1964, is distinguished by the use of audio experimentation, avant-garde record art, and extravagant live performances.\n\nThe Soul Giants were an R&B group that first featured Ray Collins, David Coronado, Ray Hunt, Roy Estrada, and Jimmy Carl Black. After Collins and the band‘s original saxophonist/leader, Coronado, got into a fight, Frank Zappa was requested to step in as the guitarist. They changed their name to the Mothers on Mother’s Day in 1965 after Zappa insisted they sing his original music. The Mothers of Invention were born “out of necessity,” as Frank Zappa later remarked, after record executives insisted on changing the name.\n\nThe Mothers experienced significant popular and commercial success after initial setbacks. In the late 1960s, the band originally found success performing in California’s underground music scene. It was signed to jazz label Verve Records under Zappa’s direction as a part of the label’s efforts for diversification. The Mothers of Invention’s debut double album Freak Out! was published by Verve in 1966 and featured Zappa, Ray Collins, Jimmy Carl Black, Roy Estrada, and Elliot Ingber among others. Soon after, Don Preston joined the group.\n\nBefore being disbanded by Zappa in 1969, the band produced a number of critically acclaimed albums under his direction, including Absolutely Free, We’re Only in It for the Money, and Uncle Meat. He reformed the Mothers in 1970 with singers Mark Volman and Howard Kaylan, along with Ian Underwood, Jeff Simmons, George Duke, and Aynsley Dunbar (formerly of the Turtles, but who for contractual reasons were credited in this band as the Phlorescent Leech &amp; Eddie). This lineup continued into 1971, when Zappa was hurt by an audience member during a performance, when bassist Jim Pons, another ex-Turtle, was later added.\n\nZappa formed the Mothers’ last lineup in 1973 with drummer Ralph Humphrey, trumpeter Sal Marquez, keyboardist/vocalist George Duke, trombonist Bruce Fowler, bassist Tom Fowler, percussionist Ruth Underwood, and keyboardist/saxophonist Ian Underwood while he was still recuperating from his injuries. Denny Walley and Terry Bozzio, who continued to perform with Zappa on non-Mothers records, were included on the Mothers’ final album, Bongo Fury (1975).\n\nThrough the first half of the 1970s, Zappa maintained a strong rate of output, including the solo album Apostrophe (‘) (1974), which was aided by the hit song “Don’t Eat The Yellow Snow” to achieve a career-high No. 10 on the Billboard pop album charts. Other albums from the era include Over-Nite Sensation (1973), which featured songs like “Dinah-Moe Humm” and “Montana” that would go on to become crowd favorites at concerts, as well as Roxy &amp; Elsewhere (1974) and One Size Fits All (1975), which feature varying lineups of a band still known as the Mothers and are notable for their tight performances of extremely challenging jazz fusion songs like “Inca Roads,” “E You Can’t Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 2 (1988), a live album from 1974, displays “the whole energy and excellence of the 1973–75 ensemble.”\n\nIn 1975, Zappa released Bongo Fury, which included live performances from a tour the same year that had briefly brought him and Captain Beefheart back together. Later, they split up for a while, but they remained in touch near the end of Frank Zappa’s life. The Mothers’ final brand-new record, Bongo Fury, bears their name. Ahead of Their Time, an album of a live performance by the original Mothers of Invention lineup from 1968, was published by Zappa in 1993.\n\nFrank Zappa & The Mothers Of Invention Discography\n\nTop Videos\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Genre Is Frank Zappa & The Mothers Of Invention?\n\nFrank Zappa & The Mothers Of Invention are a rock band.
