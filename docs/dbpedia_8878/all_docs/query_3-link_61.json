        "text": "The City of West Hollywood has declared June 10, 2024, as “Frank Zappa Day” to honor the legendary musician, activist, and counterculture icon’s invaluable contributions to music and culture in West Hollywood and beyond.\n\nWest Hollywood Mayor John M. Erickson will present the proclamation to Ahmet and Diva Zappa, the children of Frank and Gail Zappa, during a ceremony at the iconic Whisky a Go Go on the Sunset Strip. The event is scheduled for Monday, June 10, at 4 p.m. PDT.\n\nFrank Zappa, renowned for his pioneering work in music and his outspoken views on social and political issues, left an indelible mark on the cultural landscape. His band, The Mothers of Invention, played a memorable three-hour concert at Whisky a Go Go on July 23, 1968. Although plans for an album release from that night were never fully realized, the performance will finally see the light of day with the upcoming release of “Whisky a Go Go, 1968” on June 21. The collection, produced by Ahmet Zappa and Zappa Vaultmeister Joe Travers, includes every note from Zappa’s three distinct sets that evening.\n\nThe proclamation ceremony at Whisky a Go Go not only commemorates Frank Zappa’s contributions but also celebrates the release of this historic recording, bringing full circle a moment in music history that has remained unreleased for over five decades.\n\n“Frank Zappa Day” is a tribute to a man whose innovative spirit and relentless creativity continue to inspire generations of musicians and fans worldwide.\n\nThe Whisky has been called the first real American discothèque and it’s one of the most famous rock ‘n’ roll landmarks in the United States. It first opened January 11, 1964, in an old bank building that had been remodeled into a short-lived club called the Party by a former Chicago policeman, Elmer Valentine. The Whisky a Go Go opened with a live band led by Johnny Rivers and a short-skirted female DJ spinning records between sets from a suspended cage at the right of the stage. When the girl DJ danced during Rivers’ set, the audience thought it was part of the act and the concept of go-go dancers in cages was born. Rivers rode the Whisky-born “go-go” craze to national fame with records recorded partly “live at the Whisky.” The Miracles recorded the song “Going to a Go-Go” in 1966 (which was covered in 1982 by The Rolling Stones), and Whisky a Go Go franchises sprang up all over the country."
