Profession: Guitarist, Singer, and Composer

Biography: Frank Zappa had a varied and multi-faceted career as an experimental musician, guitarist, singer-songwriter, composer, bandleader, and filmmaker.

He released his first album as part of the band Mothers of Invention in 1965. Titled "Freak Out it was, unusually for a first album, a double-album release. The band recorded four albums for the label Verve before Zappa set up his own record label Bizarre Records with Herb Cohen in 1968. Alice Cooper would be the only successful act to be released by the label.

Zappa went on to record a large number of albums - over 60 across his career, while also touring extensively, mainly in the US and Europe. His musical style was diverse, incorporating a wide range of styles such as Doowop, Jazz, R&B and classical modernism. His lyrics often took a satirical and humorous view of society and he was a strong advocate for the freedom of speech. In 1985 he testified before a Senate Committee against the Parents Music Resource Center, that advocated the banning of lyrics with sexual or satanic content.

Zappa died at just 52 of prostate cancer in 1993. He was inducted into the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 and awarded Grammy for Lifetime Achievement in 1997.
