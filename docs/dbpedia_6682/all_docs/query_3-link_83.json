        "text": "At a Buffalo dinner party, Paul Kurtz became a hotter topic of debate than the main course.\n\n\"One woman exclaimed that Paul Kurtz was 'the devil incarnate,' 'the most evil man in Buffalo,' 'the pope of the unbelievers.' She said she could not (keep) from hissing every time she drove by his house,\" recalls Vern L. Bullough, Buffalo State College distinguished professor emeritus.\n\nThe devil?\n\nThere's nothing to suggest the devil exists, Kurtz might have told that dinner guest.\n\nThe pope of the unbelievers?\n\nWell, the world-renowned philosopher is an unbeliever.\n\n\"Third-generation freethinker,\" boasts Kurtz, who has debunked everyone from the Abominable Snowman to Jimmy Swaggart. From his offices in Buffalo and Amherst, Kurtz has created an internationally known philosophy industry as the dominant voice of secular humanism. He's always on call to investigate claims of paranormal phenomena. He runs a major book publishing house.\n\nAnd after 30 years of preaching skepticism, he's finding that more people are willing to listen to his message.\n\nAttacks from right-wing fundamentalists have gone the way of Jim and Tammy Bakker's ministry. One reason, perhaps, is that Kurtz and other humanist leaders met with representatives of the Vatican hierarchy several years ago in an effort to find common ground.\n\n\"We got along with the Vatican,\" he reports. \"We had an interesting dialogue with the Mormons last September out in Salt Lake City. And we have a very interesting dialogue emerging between the Baptists and the humanists.\n\n\"Humanism is growing worldwide. It's one of the most powerful streams of modern culture.\"\n\nPowerful enough to spur construction in Amherst of the $4 million Center for Inquiry, to be completed by early '95.\n\nThe more than 14,000-square-foot center is a joint project of two non-profit organizations: the Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism, which Kurtz chairs; and the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, publisher of Skeptical Inquirer magazine, which he founded and which is now read in 72 countries.\n\nThe committee acts as a clearinghouse for examinations of fringe science and paranormal claims.\n\nMany scientists, philosophers and writers are associated with the two groups, including Nobel Prize winners, novelist Kurt Vonnegut, astronomer Carl Sagan, entertainer Steve Allen and, before his death, science fiction master Isaac Asimov. As a result, the Wall Street Journal has dubbed Amherst the skeptics' capital of the world.\n\n\"We are literally besieged by the media every day from all over the world -- explain this or explain that,\" Kurtz says. You might catch him on the tube chatting with Phil Donahue or Larry King.\n\nThough the word \"skeptic\" is linked to \"pessimist\" in the thesaurus, Kurtz explains that \"skepticism focuses on inquiry, to understand nature and life. It seeks evidence and reasons for belief.\"\n\nBut in the realm of the supernatural, he says, there is much reason for disbelief.\n\n'Hee-ea-ul!'\n\nThey gathered in Akron, Ohio, before the altar podium of Ernest Angley, the TV faith healer with the preternatural brown hair. Among the infirm, blind and sickly, Angley administered his ceremonial thump with his customary cry, \"Hee-ea-ul!\" And each of the \"treated\" fell back, faint with his touch to the forehead.\n\nThat is, until Mr. Angley approached Paul Kurtz. Tape recorder in hand, Kurtz refused to join the theatrics.\n\n\"I stood my ground and did not fall back,\" notes Kurtz in his 1986 study \"Does Faith Healing Work?\"\n\n\"He put his arm behind me and forcibly tried to push me down, but I steadfastly refused to fall. We were eyeball to eyeball, and I thought to myself, 'Look, you son-of-a-gun, don't try anything on me.' . . . Angley tarried a bit and then left me, moving on to the next victim. . . .\n\n\"One got the impression that he could have commanded them to do almost anything and that they would have obeyed. I was reminded of Jim Jones' hypnotic power over his flock in Guyana.\"\n\nThe Akron investigation exemplifies Kurtz's commitment to examine paranormal claims by reaching outside the scholarly world -- willing to venture everywhere from faith healing services to allegedly haunted houses.\n\nFormer Kurtz student Timothy J. Madigan writes of the necessity \"to apply the humanist and skeptical philosophies outside of the classroom,\" in his new compilation \"Toward a New Enlightenment: The Philosophy of Paul Kurtz\" (Transaction Publishers), co-edited with Vern Bullough.\n\n\"People are taken in by charlatans and hoaxers, people who read the future or give you a magical cure, and any other sensational claims,\" Kurtz says. \"I think it's unfortunate.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nSelf-proclaimed psychic Uri Geller lost a multimillion-dollar libel suit against the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal. A federal court in Washington, D.C., last year ordered Geller to pay the organization tens of thousands of dollars in sanctions. Geller, Kurtz reports, still hasn't paid up.\n\nMadigan remembers a faith-healing service his professor invited him to in Rochester:\n\n\"It was the first time I had ever attended such an event, and I found it literally overwhelming,\" Madigan notes in his book.\n\n\"The pounding organ music, the non-stop clapping and singing, and the incessant haranguing by (W.V.) Grant to fill up his coffers with money were more than I had expected. The whole affair had an air of farce to it, except for one thing: Many of the people there were seriously ill, and desperate for any hope of a cure. I was appalled when Grant told everyone to toss their medication at the stage, because they didn't need it anymore. . . . But even more saddening was the look on the faces of several individuals at the end of the service, when they realized that they had not been cured. No doubt they attributed this to their own insufficient faith. . . .\n\n\"As Paul explained to me afterward, one could only truly criticize such chicanery by going into the field and witnessing it firsthand. . . . He has time and again broken down the distinction between town and gown, enlightening and infuriating many in both camps who'd prefer that never the twain should meet. And in doing so, he has enjoyed himself immensely.\"\n\nSo what does humanism have to do with debunking astrologers and tales of UFOs? Skeptical inquiry and humanism are both \"based, in the modern world, upon reason and science,\" explains Kurtz, a UB philosophy professor emeritus.\n\n\"Humanism is an effort to interpret science and technology, and to develop values that will enhance life. It's forward-looking, futuristic.\"\n\nVern Bullough, in an interview, calls Kurtz \"an intense, dedicated man.\" In \"Toward a New Enlightenment,\" the sociologist gives his response to the dinner guest who attacked the philosopher:\n\n\"I indicated that I had known Kurtz before I moved to Buffalo and he was really a good father to his children, a loving husband and a dedicated scholar, all of which she refused to believe.\"\n\nThe humanist, he adds, \"is regarded by many people in the United States as the enemy.\"\n\nBullough says that atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair may have received more publicity than Kurtz, in part because she seeks it out. However, Bullough continues, \"Kurtz is far more respected and far more feared, because his approach is fundamentally different from O'Hair's. He investigates, criticizes and debunks, but on the basis of the data, not from some emotional biases.\"\n\nEven Christian Century magazine called Kurtz \"one of the rare intellectuals of our time, the most energetic and best-informed of the humanists.\"\n\nUFO landing pad\n\nWith Socrates as his hero, Kurtz says he became a philosopher because \"I wanted to go to the roots of things, why people believe the way they do, what they believe. I want to ask the difficult questions.\"\n\nBorn the year evolution theory went to trial, 1925, Paul Kurtz grew up in a family where science, politics and the arts were discussed at the dinner table, as well as sports. A native of Newark, N.J., young Kurtz was oriented toward Marxism in his undergraduate years at New York University. Madigan writes: \"He argued long and hard with his philosophy instructor Sidney Hook over the virtues of that position. Infuriated by Hook's combative anti-communism, Kurtz initially dismissed him as a voice from the past, out of touch with the glorious revolution to come.\"\n\nWhen the Vietnam War years came, Madigan adds, Kurtz \"found himself on the barricades, arguing against students and radical professors who sought to protest the Vietnam War by closing down the college campuses\" -- including his own. The philosopher, who received his Ph.D. from Columbia University, feared that these actions \"led to a disrespect for the fabric of education.\"\n\nToday, Kurtz calls himself a moderate liberal.\n\n\"Anyone who's not radical when he's young, and a conservative when he's older, has not lived a full life,\" he quips with characteristic good humor.\n\nThis \"ghostbuster\" is no dour academic killjoy trying to wring the fun out of life. In the completed portion of the Center for Inquiry, he cheerfully brings out a model of the finished project that includes a \"UFO landing pad.\"\n\n\"Magic is fun,\" he concedes. \"If you know it's a magician performing feats, it's entertaining -- but things don't go bump in the night.\" Kurtz was an early advocate, Bullough notes, of seeking the help of magicians, such as James \"The Amazing\" Randi, to help detect frauds.\n\n\"Life is very adventurous -- space voyages out in the cosmos, sending back photographs of Jupiter and Saturn; the effort to cure disease and probe the biosphere. The real world is exciting in its own terms without inventing fictions,\" Kurtz says.\n\n\"I'm fascinated with mystery and the unknown. I think we ought to use the best tools that we have, of logic, science and reason.\"\n\nBut science has its limits, some people argue. James Likoudis, president of the conservative organization Catholics United for the Faith, contends that \"it's a mistake to look to science\" when dealing with the supernatural, \"because science is descriptive of material matter.\"\n\nThe new Center for Inquiry will house the world's largest skeptics' and humanists' library, up to 50,000 volumes. It also will have audio and video production facilities.\n\nIt's separate from Kurtz's other major enterprise, Prometheus Books, which celebrated its 25th anniversary during the American Booksellers Association convention recently in Los Angeles. With more than 800 titles, Prometheus has published such authors as Dr. Jack Kevorkian, and its books have won praise from newspapers including the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times. Named after the Titan who defied the gods, Prometheus offers readers an alternative, often dissenting point of view. With offices in Buffalo and Amherst, it's the largest publisher of its kind.\n\n\"We're part of the knowledge industry,\" Kurtz says. \"Our products are conceptual and intellectual.\n\n\"We're rapidly developing. We have ambitious plans to develop media productions,\" he says. \"We do produce radio and television programs. Our radio series is carried on over 200 stations.\"\n\nA colleague says that one secret of Kurtz's indefatigable energy is his daily two-to-three-mile run.\n\n\"Apparently,\" says Madigan, \"he simply doesn't have time to be exhausted.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
