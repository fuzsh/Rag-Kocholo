        "text": "Friends, colleagues and admirers assembled at New York University yesterday to commemorate Sidney Hook, the philosopher, author and social critic who died on July 12 at the age of 86.\n\nIf a single theme emerged from the score or so of brief speeches, it was that Professor Hook, who taught in the N.Y.U. philosophy department for 40 years, never wavered in the many battles he waged.\n\nJeane J. Kirkpatrick, the former chief delegate to the United Nations, quoted from a sentence of Professor Hook's that, she said, summed up his philosophy of engagement in practical issues: ''If there is any ethical injunction valid for all periods, it is awareness in action.''\n\n''Sidney felt we had an obligation to think clearly and to act,'' she said. An Unspeakable Thing\n\nHe also believed, she said, that when totalitarianism occurred, it was very likely because good men lacked the courage and conviction to stand up against it. He viewed totalitarianism of either the left or the right as the ultimate unspeakable thing.\n\nThe service, attended by several hundred people, was evidence of Professor Hook's friendships with people from across the political spectrum who often regarded each other as intellectual adversaries. There were labor leaders like Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.; civil rights workers like Norman Hill, president of the A. Phillip Randolph Institute, and leading conservative writers like Norman Podhoretz.\n\nProfessor Hook, who was born in 1902 in Brooklyn, was a student of John Dewey, the founder of the school of pragmatism in American philosophy. He went on, as a teacher and a polemicist, to involve himself in virtually all the intellectual quarrels that engulfed the nation. He was among the first New York Marxists to break with Communism; he fought against isolationism and disarmament, and was generally seen as a conservative in foreign affairs, although he considered himself a socialist in domestic affairs.
