He has also been perhaps the most action-oriented philosopher of that period, for he combines interests that are both theoretical and practical. Not only has he written on a wide range of philosophical issues in methodology, epistemology, the philosophy of science, ethical and social philosophy, and naturalistic metaphysics, he has attempted to build new institutions exemplifying his principles. Thus both the contemporary secular humanist and skeptical movements of the 20th and 21st centuries have been inspired by his indefatigable energy. He has consistently defended reason, science and free inquiry in all areas of human interest. The main focal point of his work is defined by the word eupraxsophy, introduced by Kurtz, which means “the practice of good wisdom” (scientific and philosophical) in the conduct of life. If philosophy is the “love of wisdom,” eupraxsophy is “the application of philosophy to praxis.” The chapters in this book grew out of a conference that I coorganized, with David Goicoechea, at Brock University in Ontario, Canada on February 13-15, 1992. It was part of a ten-year series of conferences on the Philosophy of Love (all held appropriately enough around Valentine’s Day), masterminded by Professor Goicoechea, from 1991 to 2000. This was itself a Promethean, if not to say Herculean, effort. Philosophers whose works were focused\n\nx\n\nMadigan: Preface\n\nupon at the other such conferences include such stalwarts as Irving Singer, Martha Nussbaum, Tui Wei-Ming, and Raimundo Panikkar. The authors who appear in this volume for the most part attended the Kurtz Conference and submitted their formal papers after the fact. Given the continuing importance of the topic of the philosophy of love, I thought it would be good to publish these pieces, along with Kurtz’s extensive critique. Because of the time lapse between the conference and publication, I thought it best to preserve the papers “in amber”, as it were, since further revisions would have added to the delay. Also, sadly, some of the contributors have passed away in the interval. I hope that readers will be charitable and understand that all the contributors, had they but world enough and time, would have no doubt added more recent references to the literature on love if they had been so able. This volume does not cover the full score of Kurtz’s entire corpus of writings. It concentrates only on those primarily that deal with normative ethical issues, and especially with the figure of Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods and bequeathed it (along with the arts and sciences) to humankind. Prometheus is a symbol for all who have challenged the gods on high. Part One deals with the role of the Prometheus myth historically—from ancient Greece to the modern world. Part Two concentrates on Humanism and Naturalism, both of which are central to Kurtz’s work. Kurtz has been instrumental in founding the modern-day scientific skeptical movement with its critiques of paranormal claims; and he also has been a sharp critic of religion,\n\nPromethean Love\n\nxi\n\nespecially theistical religions. Thus Part Three concentrates on spirituality and Christianity. Part Four deals with love, sexuality, and marriage. The humanist view of sexuality diverges significantly from the theistical view. Kurtz defends the audacity of Prometheus in his challenges to religious piety and his concern for the good of mankind—expressing a type of moral caring. Thus Part Five contrasts self-interest and altruism, two differing approaches to morality. Part Six deals with the concept of eupraxsophy. The concluding section contains Paul Kurtz’s response to the critics of his work. Beginning with an autobiographical section, Kurtz addresses each of his critics in turn and further delineates his understanding of what a naturalistic view of love is all about. It is my pleasure to finally be able to bring out this important contribution to the topic of the philosophy of love. Paul Kurtz has made a major contribution to my own life, as a teacher, employer and colleague, and I hope that the reader will find the discussion herein both lively and informative. I would like to thank Ranjit Sandhu for his yeoman’s work in typesetting the manuscript, and David Goicoechea for allowing me to participate in his 10 Years of Love celebration. Since it came to an end in 2000 my Februarys have not been nearly so exciting. Most of all I want to thank Paul Kurtz for inspiring me with his boundless energy, endless enthusiasm, and sheer audacity. He is truly a modern Prometheus. This volume is dedicated to the late Bonnie Bullough, Tad S. Clement, and Richard Taylor. They were all humanists in every\n\nxii Madigan: Preface\n\nsense of that word, and in Aristotelian terms they were all my good friends. —Timothy J. Madigan\n\nPart One PROMETHEUS REVISITED\n\nPromethean Love: Unbound Paul Kurtz\n\nI The Promethean myth is Hellenistic in origin. It has inspired countless generations of protesters, secularists, and humanists—who herald Prometheus’s heroic virtues. Pitted against this myth are the Mosaic, Christian, and Mohammedan revelatory myths, Hebraic in origin and inspiration. One difference is that the Greeks, at least by the time of the pre-Socratic philosophers, knew that the Homeric legends were only mythological, though they served a poetic and moral function; though, as Plato pointed out in the Euthyphro, they had a confused ethical message. Judæo-Christian theologians and many philosophers, still today, have not accepted the fact that their Gospels are likewise only confused mythical fictions spun out of the human imagination. Prometheus serves as a symbol for those who reject the reigning theistic orthodoxies and who criticize the temptation of mortal men and women, to deify and worship the dark unknown in an effort to assuage their fears of death. Our knowledge of the Promethean myth is due primarily to Aeschylus, who authored three poems, Prometheus the Firegiver, Prometheus Bound, and Prometheus Unbound. The only one that has survived intact from the long period of theistic domination is Prometheus Bound. The poem opens with Hephaestos, along with Strength and Force, escorting Prometheus in chains, where he is bound to a rock on Mount Caucasos. The Prometheus tale is rich in imagery. Prometheus, a demigod, was, according to Aeschylus, the son of Themis (the Earth) and Gaea, though according to Hesiod, son of the Titan Iapetos and Clymene. In a war between the Olympian gods and the Titans, Prometheus sided with the Olympians. The\n\n4\n\nKurtz: Promethean Love: Unbound\n\nTitans were defeated and their dynasty was overthrown. What is unique for Prometheus is that he grieved at the sorry state of humankind. Humans, we are told by Aeschylus, lived wretched lives, like ants, huddled in caves (reminiscent of the Stone Age). Out of love for men, Prometheus became their benefactor, stealing fire from Hephaestos (the god of fire and metalwork and son of Zeus), and bestowed it on man. Ancient man worshipped fire and the sun; to receive the gift of fire was the beginning of man’s emancipation from bondage. Fire was difficult to ignite, but it kept us warm, was used to cook our food, and was basic to technology. Prometheus taught man the arts and sciences, the beginnings of civilization. He taught men how to build houses made of brick, and carpentry. He taught them the significance of the seasons, astronomy, mathematics, the alphabet, language, the domestication of animals, the building of chariots and ships, the art of medicine and healing, the skills of intuition and prophecy. We read in Prometheus Bound—and this is central for humanism—that “Men were aroused to reason and taught to think” by Prometheus, who made it possible for men “to cease from contemplating death.” “Blind hopes I gave,” said Prometheus, “to live and dwell with them.” Prometheus is thus challenging the Olympian gods and especially Zeus, who was the symbol of savage power and autocracy. The state of men was such that “through fear of death” they lived “all of their lifetime subject to bondage” and they were susceptible to the slavish awe of Zeus. With the stimulation of reason, the birth of the technological arts, and sciences, Prometheus gave men new interests in life. Humans, formerly impotent before the unknown forces of nature, discovered that they had new powers, and they were responsible, at least in part, for their own destinies. For teaching man these skills, Zeus in anger had Prometheus chained to a rock, and, as further punishment, had a vulture (or eagle) pick out his liver incessantly, renewed by night, and devoured by day. In Prometheus Bound, Prometheus declares his defiance:\n\nPromethean Love 5 “To be the bond slave of the rock, is better than to be Zeus’s trusting herald.” “All the gods I hate.” “I will not become womanized in mind, or entreat him [Zeus], whom I greatly loathe, with upturned hand.” “Let [Zeus] do what he wills, I will not give in . . . . ”\n\nZeus eventually frees Prometheus, because Prometheus has the gift of prophecy (for the skeptic a questionable ability) and he had foreknowledge of Zeus’s doom: If he has a son by Thetis, Prometheus states, Thetis will “bear a son greater than the father,” and the child will overthrow him, as Zeus did his father. Zeus is gratified for this knowledge. He has Prometheus released from his chains, the vulture is killed by Heracles, and Prometheus is restored to dignity. Indeed, Zeus, according to legend, establishes a festival in his honor, and so Prometheus emerges victorious, not as a tragic figure in the final tale. The Promethean figure has inspired poets and prophets ever since. The central theme is the struggle between Zeus—who represents violent power and demands obedient servility—and Prometheus—who represents reason and the arts and wishes humanity to prosper. It is a clash between authority and rebellion, tyranny and freedom, obedience and autonomy. Prometheus did not deny that the gods exist, as did later Prometheans, only that humanity has a right to flourish and share in power in spite of them. The Enlightenment expressed the high point of modernity’s confidence in the potentialities of human beings to use reason, technology, and science in order to create a better future. Goethe, poet of the Enlightenment, reveals his distaste for religious superstition and the tyranny of Zeus in his poem, “Prometheus”: I know of nothing poorer Under the sun that you gods. Wretchedly\n\n6\n\nKurtz: Promethean Love: Unbound You feed your majesty On imposed sacrifices And the Breath of prayers. You would waste away If children and beggars Were not hopeful fools.\n\nGoethe expressed the joyful, exuberant temper in his own life. He heralds Prometheus as a master of the earth and the inspiration for human independence and power. Prometheus is not only the benefactor, but the creator of Man: Here I sit, shaping Man After my image, A race that is like me To suffer, to weep, To rejoice and be glad, And like myself To have no regard for you!\n\nFor Lord Byron, Prometheus called humanity to resistance against its “funereal destiny.” The human spirit, he hoped, would be “triumphant” and where it dared, defy the Gods. In his “Prometheus” poem, we read his defense of rationalism: Thy Godlike crime was to be kind, To render with thy precepts less The sum of human wretchedness And the strength of man with his own mind.\n\nKarl Marx was no doubt the most influential Promethean of the nineteenth century. In his doctoral dissertation, The Difference Between the Material Philosophy of Democritus and Epicurus, Marx extols Prometheus as “the noblest of saints and martyrs in the calendar of philosophy.” He applauds Prometheus’s rebellion against the Gods and his desire to liberate man from oppression. Although Marx was a humanist, he did not consider humanism to be simply atheistic; this was a negative and abstract form of humanism. He\n\nPromethean Love 7\n\nthought humanism was best realized by communism, which was supposed to emancipate humankind from all kinds of servility, not simply from religion, but from unjust economic and social systems. Marx said, “Follow your own course and let people talk!” We all know what has happened to Marxism in recent years. Marx had been apotheosized by some of his disciples. He now lies chained in the Caucasus, his liver devoured by vultures. Unlike Prometheus, he has been proclaimed dead. Whether he will rebound in some form is hard to predict. Nietzsche is likewise a symbol of Promethean defiance. Proclaiming the death of God, he wished to replace the Christian slave morality with that of the Overman. “Whither is God? . . . I shall tell you. We have killed him . . . you and I. All of us are his murderers.” The issue for secular humanists today is not simply atheism versus theism, or Prometheus versus Christ, but the Human Prospect itself. With the collapse of the monstrous tyrannies of the twentieth century—Stalinist communism and fascism—the challenge of Prometheus is especially pressing. For there has likewise been a collapse of self-confidence and of the ability of humans to cope with the complex problems of the contemporary world. Humans do not live by bread alone; they need circuses to entertain them and myths to sustain. Does the Promethean myth have any meaning for “the postmodern age”? Is technology so dehumanizing and reason so bankrupt that we must abandon Prometheus and return to belief in the ancient myth of an omnipotent creator of the universe, and/or retreat into a new failure of nerve, and lapse into nihilistic subjectivity and despair? Paul Johnson, a conservative British religious critic, rails against the Promethean spirit, which he finds dominant in the modern world among intellectuals, and which he describes as follows: But there . . . a Promethean spirit in man, proud of man’s progress and seemingly limitless capacities, unwilling to submit\n\n8\n\nKurtz: Promethean Love: Unbound to the total subordination which the notion of God demands, driven first to resistance, then to the denial that God exists at all. This Promethean spirit has been growing with dramatic speed over the last 250 years. It is presented as the spirit of modernity, the creed of rationalism, the march of science. It preaches the absurdity of belief in God, the fatuity of religious doctrine and the positive evil of much of the teachings and practices of the organized faiths. In the Western world today, perhaps a majority of the people who classify themselves as educated—that is, they have attended university, they read books regularly and regard themselves as people who think seriously about the problems of the day and the nature of life—perhaps a majority, would range themselves in the Promethean camp, with varying degrees of consciousness and enthusiasm. Skepticism or denial of God is the hallmark of the modern Homo sapiens—Thinking Man.1\n\nJohnson attacks Bertrand Russell, A. J. Ayer, Jean-Paul Sartre, Martin Heidegger, and other atheistic and secular humanists. He indicts free sexual love, abortion, euthanasia, the movement for homosexual freedom, and twentieth-century totalitarian movements, all of which he attributes to the Promethean Spirit. He concludes that “There is no substitute for God: this our own dreadful century has abundantly proved.”2 II I submit that Prometheus is still relevant today. How and why? First, because Prometheus symbolizes human independence and confidence in our ability to persist and to succeed. In defying the Gods, whether Zeus or Yahweh, or the all-knowing Secular Utopian State, we advance the cause of human freedom. Authoritarian myths were invented by some human beings to keep other human beings in a state of servility. They mask a deep-seated self-hatred and feelings of human impotence. Prometheus on the contrary exemplifies the 1. Paul Johnson, “Idols of Destruction: Is There a Substitute for God?,” Crisis, June 1991, p. 24. 2. Ibid., p. 30.\n\nPromethean Love 9\n\nvirtues of courage and autonomy. He dramatizes the need to take destiny into our own hands as far as we can without fear or timidity. Though we may fail, there are no viable alternatives to expanding our own powers in order to control nature and resolve human problems. Implicit in this, Prometheus has come to symbolize the virtue of rationality. In religion, this means atheism, i.e., skepticism toward beliefs in a divine power, but also humanism, i.e., the resolve to cultivate our own skills and values, to use instrumental intelligence, and to develop the arts and sciences. Civilization marks the advance of humanity beyond the fear of death and the torment of the unknown. By using reason and taking responsibility for our own destiny, and in recognizing that “No deity will save us,” and that “we must save ourselves” (Humanist Manifesto II), we advance the Human Prospect. As applied to the individual, Promethean men and women have audacity, the stubbornness and determination to create and realize their own ideals. They are self-generating libertarian free spirits, thinkers and doers. Prometheus thus emphasizes the heroic virtues. He is typified by creative geniuses, rebels, innovators, discoverers, explorers, entrepreneurs, anyone who breaks new ground by challenging the official doctrines of social institutions, whether of church or state or economy and the customary mores. Who are the Promethean men and women? Those on the frontiers of great adventures and moved by the achievement motive: Alexander, Hannibal, Cæsar, Queen Elizabeth, Catherine the Great, and Napoléon as political leaders; and Lucretius, Shakespeare, Goethe, and George Sand as poets; Hypatia, Hume, Marx, Nietzsche, Russell, Sartre, Dewey, and Hook as philosophers; Einstein, Freud, Madame Curie, and Darwin as scientists; Thomas Edison and Gustave Eiffel as inventors; Beethoven and Béla Bartok as composers; Susan B. Anthony, Margaret Sanger, and Albert Schweitzer as humanitarians. All are innovators; all attempt to develop new forms of creative expression. Moses, Christ, and Mohammed as the founders of great\n\n10 Kurtz: Promethean Love: Unbound\n\nreligions, were also Prometheans. It may be a surprise to hear them described as Promethean figures, but they were. Believing that they talked to God, and were his prophets or messengers, are symptoms of an inflated ego or a form of madness—and they had a touch of both. Moses, Christ, and Mohammed insisted that their disciples obey them. They proclaimed commandments for others, not themselves. They were the masters, not the slaves for whom they preached an obedience-morality. Those who followed their dictates, on the contrary, are anti-Prometheans to the core. Is the Promethean by definition a superperson? Is the Prometheus option available only for a limited number of leaders (or Overmen), appropriate only to an elite class? No, says the Promethean democrat. All human beings have the capacity for some creative selfaffirmation; each person has the responsibility and the power to create and mold his own life. But many fear to do so; they lack the courage; they all too readily are resigned to defeat. Are there not demonic dangers intrinsic to the Promethean spirit? How distinguish beneficent from malevolent geniuses? Cesare Borgia, Hitler, Lenin, and Stalin were rebels and innovators, but they soaked the earth with blood. Were they Prometheans? If audacious defiance is a characteristic of the Promethean attitude, it surely is not sufficient; for intrinsic to Prometheans are the centrality of intellect and reason, necessary to moderate the will and to harmonize the world. There is also the essential role of love. For without love the full test of Promethehood is never attained. What is Promethean love? In a primary sense, Prometheus was moved to undertake his heroic deeds because, as Aeschylus said, “he loved man too much.” There is here an altruistic motive. As the benefactor of humankind, Prometheus was interested in ameliorating the conditions of human life, liberating men and women from darkness and fear, and persuading them to develop the arts of intelligence. Thus the demonic destroyer is a non-Promethean; for he is not concerned with the common good nor does he love humankind.\n\nPromethean Love 11\n\nIII What is the pertinence of Prometheus’s message to the present world? How would he respond to the postmodern nay-sayers, who have lost confidence in the Human? Implicit in Prometheanism is a cosmic metaphysic; for the human species is a source of power in the universe, which it shares with the blind forces of nature. The term that I have introduced in my book Eupraxsophy (1990) to describe a naturalistic and humanistic philosophy of life is eupraxsophy (eu = good, praxis = practice or conduct, sophia = wisdom), which means literally “good practice and wisdom,” as distinct from philosophy, meaning “the love of wisdom.” Praxis is a key central concept, as it was for Prometheus, who seized destiny and undertook action, and for Marx, Dewey, and the pragmatists. It is not enough to understand or contemplate the world but to enter into it and change or modify it. Human action tends to re-create the conditions under which it exists. Men and women thus are builders of civilization. The decision to leave the caves of primitive existence, the ability to create techné and arété, the technological arts and sciences, and to discover the means for leading a better life, is that which distinguishes humankind as a sociocultural shaper of events from other species. The emergence of culture is what differentiates the human species; for culture is the repository of the collective memory and wisdom of the race, and it provides the tools and instruments for a civilized life. Sophia is also important, particularly for the philosophy of humanism. In overthrowing the theistic domination of the universe, the world became a scene of natural causes and events. The belief in supernatural causes transcends the categories of human understanding and the forms of human experience, and this may be seen as mere postulation. A secular humanist does not deny the existence of a transcendental realm, but almost by definition we can say nothing about it; hence why glorify or worship it?\n\n12 Kurtz: Promethean Love: Unbound\n\nSkepticism is essential for wisdom. It need not be negative or nihilistic, nor does it deny the possibility of reliable knowledge. It merely affirms the methodological rule that any claims to truth must be tested by objective standards of evidence and reason. It does not deal in absolute certainties, but is willing to live with probabilities and uncertainties. The universe we encounter is in constant flux, processes of both evolution and devolution are present, species appear and disappear. The categories by which we understand nature presuppose some regularities and some degree of order, but nature also manifests contingency, chance, and chaos. Are we entitled to read into this rich pluralistic universe a divine creator? I must confess that I do not know the ultimate origin of the universe. What preceded the Big Bang (a 15-billion-year-old universe), or the plasmic theory of cosmology (a 100-billion-year-old universe), or any other theory of origins, are questions not presently cognitively meaningful, for they cannot be expressed in nonfalsifiable concepts and they have no identifiable experimental content. That is why I am a skeptic or agnostic about any attempt to transcend any possible experience or to postulate a personal deity. All of this reduces to an anthropomorphic leap of faith. Belief in God is fed by the transcendental temptation, and this is nourished by the fear of facing one’s own finitude and the tendency to deny death. Sophia, as I interpret it, is based on a summation of the best scientific theories of nature and man, at any one time in history. It cannot be simply a philosophical summation, but must draw upon the empirical sciences, which are constantly changing. What kind of eupraxia do I think best fits human needs? And in particular, what role does love play in ethics? I have in my book Exuberance (1978) developed a philosophy of the good life appropriate to an individual who is bursting at the seams and has resolved to live with intensity. In Forbidden Fruit: The Ethics of Humanism (1988) I have taken ethical inquiry beyond the individual, to the community, and have focused on the common moral decencies, human rights, and our obligations and responsibilities to\n\nPromethean Love 13\n\nothers. My ethical theory is not a meta theory but a normative rendering of the Promethean form of the good life. No doubt this involves some persuasive definitions. There are four E words to describe this humanist eupraxia, though in the time allotted I can only provide a brief sketch of it. I begin with (1) the ego-centered individual. Happiness is always that of a sentient person. I have only one life to live, therefore I should strive to live it with gusto and excitement. (2) The ultimate good for the individual is exuberance. This is not a passive state of eudæmonia or well-being, but an active expression of our talents, interests, and endeavors. Creative joy involves both pleasure and self-fulfillment, a union of hedonism and self-realization. (3) this theory does not reduce to utter subjectivity, for there are normative standards of excellence, criteria of valuation on a comparative scale. Among the highest values for the Promethean are self-love, selfcontrol, self-restraint, temperance and moderation, creativity, courage, the affirmative and positive outlook, and the meaningful life. (4) However, no individual can live fully unless he or she is capable of empathy and has a compassionate concern for the needs of others, their well-being and happiness. I have designated my theory as “objective relativism.” This means that ethical choices are always related to concrete situations, individuals, and societies, so there is a degree of relativism. But there are objective, rational standards of criticism that we can bring to bear in evaluating our values and principles, and they are tested by their consequences. Therefore, we need not degenerate into ethical subjectivity or nihilism. I also describe this normative eupraxia with four A words: It focuses on (1) autonomy, i.e., maximizing freedom of choice so that the individual can lead an authentic self-governing existence. (2) This involves the actualization of one’s talents and the achievement of one’s ends and goals. 3) There is also an element of creative audacity, where we do not simply realize our needs, but seek to exceed our capacities by outreach and invention, and this involves impudence and creativity. If we encounter an abyss, the Promethean\n\n14 Kurtz: Promethean Love: Unbound\n\ntask is to leap over it by daring choices, not to cower in fear or fall in. (4) Essential to the full life, I reiterate, is the capacity to express altruistic feelings and to engage in constructive supportive behavior; that is, to manifest a genuine interest in loving and helping other human beings. Love, including altruistic love, is thus a necessary component of the exuberant life, and it is fundamental to what I have called the “common moral decencies.” By these I mean the general moral principles and ethical rules which are necessary if we are to live and interact harmoniously. These involve everything from truth telling, promise keeping, dependability, sincerity, and honesty, to nonmalfeasance, beneficence, justice, negotiation, compromise, and tolerance. Can we define love? It refers to an attitude of attachment and affection that we feel toward a person or object. There are many forms that it assumes. We have already talked about self-love, involving some respect for one’s own self. But I wish to focus on the love we have for other persons. Obviously, there is a profound biological basis for love rooted in sexuality. Individuals thus seek to satisfy their sexual desires, to achieve orgasmic pleasure and hedonic gratification. Romantic love is intermingled with sexual desire. I am convinced that unless an individual is able to satisfy his or her sexual libido without excessive repression, the materials of tragedy will fester. Sexual love is thus essential to human happiness. In this postFreudian age, we are now aware that the many varieties of sexual expression should not be cavalierly condemned as deviant, sinful, or evil. Sexual desires are expressed in diverse ways. John Money has used the term love maps to describe the wide range of human tastes and fantasies that are found in human behavior. Perhaps the term pansexual best describes the capacities of humans to respond to a variety of sexual stimuli, which in one sense are all “good”; so long, that is, as they are nondestructive and do not injure other sentient beings. We now see that the sexual orientation of a person has a\n\nPromethean Love 15\n\ngenetic and pre-natal basis, though how it is expressed depends upon psycho-sexual development and environmental conditions. There are stages of love over and beyond orgasmic release. These can best develop where there are stable, nonpromiscuous relationships between persons—as between a man and woman in marriage, or between two lovers. These relationships may be deeply gratifying and rewarding. They involve sincerity and trust and the sharing of the values of commitment and companionship. There are other enriching forms of nonsexual love; and in a wider sense these shared values become central in meaningful human relationships. I am here referring to the devotion of parents to their children, of children toward their parents, the affectionate bonds between sisters and brothers, and other kinship relationships. These afford among the highest sources of human love. Still at another stage is the love of friends, colleagues, or companions, for each other. Here love is not autistic, selfish, or egocentric, but truly other-regarding. A true friend is one who wishes his friend to flourish, and he exults when his friend succeeds. This is not infantile or possessive love, yet it offers a deeply ennobling form of satisfaction. In cherishing the other person as a person and wanting that person to prosper and to realize his or her own forms of actualization, both persons can grow and can discover new sources of beauty and value. The most extended sense of love as altruistic love goes beyond our immediate circle of wives or husbands, lovers, relatives, or friends, to the community of humankind. The moral point of view is in full array when we have an altruistic commitment not only to aliens and strangers within our midst, as the Old Testament admonishes us to do, but to those without. Here there is an ethical decision to have some regard for all human beings, those who suffer and need our help, without our admonition or approval. Egocentric, self-centered love is never complete. The person never fully flowers as a human being unless he can give love. It is not enough to receive it and to be loved, but one needs to develop the capacity to bestow\n\n16 Kurtz: Promethean Love: Unbound\n\nlove on other persons. I am continually surprised by the extreme egocentric libertarian position, which considers human beings to be irremediably selfish in motivation, and which relates all moral concerns to the gratification of one’s own self-interest, whether short-range or long-range. I think this is a distorted view of human personality; for there is considerable evidence that deep within the human species are the potentialities for sharing life’s joys and sorrows, of relating our most intimate secrets to others, and of making sacrifices for them, without any hope of reward or gain. The full test of moral growth is whether an individual is able to realize his capacities for moral behavior. I recognize that altruistic love is sometimes absent in some individuals. Some individuals are deranged psychopaths and sociopaths, as in the tragic case of Jeffrey Dahmer, who had no respect for other human beings as persons. The moral development of some individuals may be thwarted due to severe environmental deprivation or some fixation in the psychosexual growth process or genetic impairment. I submit, however, that with normal genetic endowment, a stable social environment, some form of loving parenting care, and some sexual gratification, that morally altruistic behavior can emerge. In any case, recognizing the key role of altruism as part of the essence of what it means to be human modifies self-interest theories. This is a pluralistic theory of motivation. We are both self-interested and altruistic. Unless altruism is able to express itself, the individual is morally handicapped, deprived of full moral growth. IV Promethean ethics, however, is different from the Judaic, Christian, or Muslim morality, and in the following senses: It is not an ethic of obedience, but of independence and affirmation. It is not willing to sacrifice the autonomous ego on the altar of social custom or to God. Instead of acquiescence and passivity, there is a determination and resolve. There is no exacerbated sense of sin, hedonic-phobia, or erotic-phobia, but a lusty appreciation for life’s pleasures, and also\n\nPromethean Love 17\n\nthe conviction that to live life fully one needs to share its laughter and tears with others. The Promethean ethic is not focused on the escape from death— though obviously we wish to be healthy and to do what we can to prolong life. But there is no illusion that there is salvation beyond the grave. Rather, it emphasizes human powers and to our ability to achieve a good life as best we can, individually and in cooperation with others. There is no meaning to life per se, in abstracto, either for us or for the universe at large. For the universe is blind, impersonal, and indifferent about the preservation or realization of our fondest dreams and hopes. Meanings are what we create. They grow out of our plans and projects. Nature and society present us with options, and we create our own; but the choices of how to proceed are our own, and whether we fail or succeed has no ontological significance, independent of ourselves or of other human beings. There is no denying of death, but there is an affirming of life. The Promethean ethic is not excessively focused on the limitations of human powers; for it seeks constantly to expand them by the discovery and application of knowledge. Primitive man was in awe of and terror-stricken by the savage furies that felled people apparently without rhyme or reason, by premature death or unexpected tragedy. For the Promethean, death is a natural event; there is a season for everything, including a season to die. Accordingly, there is no overriding pessimistic sense of foreboding, failure, or defeat. Life is taken as a challenge. It provides us with opportunities to achieve great things, but if we fail, as we often do, perhaps there is some remorse, but there is no gnashing of teeth, but a kind of Stoic resignation and a resolve to do our best next time in overcoming new challenges. A Promethean will refuse to accept his fate as fixed, nor will he plead for forgiveness to an unknown deity; but he will seek to marshal ingenuity cooperatively with others to create a better world and to live fully within it. A Promethean is concerned not simply with his own self-preservation and prosperity, but with those whom\n\n18 Kurtz: Promethean Love: Unbound\n\nhe cherishes, and today he has an altruistic concern for all of humanity, beyond ethnicity, beyond race, and beyond nationality, the building of a world community. Prometheus is concerned with the common good, which he thinks can be ameliorated. This is surely the dominant theme of modern Man, especially since the scientific revolution, industrialization, and the Enlightenment. Modernity takes as its project the expansion of technology, reason, and science, for it believes that problems can best be solved by using methods wisely. Today modernity is under attack, and postmodernists have admonished us to abandon any idea that there are standards of objectivity or knowledge; and they have little faith in science and technology. I respond, we cannot escape from the project of living. We are left with a quandary: What viable options do we have, if not marshalling our best talents, human courage, reason, altruism? Is the Promethean model of the good life too difficult for the ordinary man and woman? If only a minority can follow the Socratic injunction to lead the life of reason, can only a minority live consistently the heroic Promethean way, where we need not only reason but courage? It is the courage not simply to be, but to become that is the Promethean injunction. How generalizable is the Promethean ethic? The Promethean democrat shares the gift of reason and fire with all humans, and thus implies some confidence in the capacities of all men and women to utilize their potentialities, however diverse they are. Prometheus stands as a beacon that great things are still possible. But there was only one God, indeed a son of a Titan and a demigod, who dared to challenge the Gods. Perhaps that is why it is so difficult for everyone else. Perhaps some cognitive dissonance and falsehoods may be necessary for sanity. Do human beings need myths of consolation and salvation, in order to survive? The psychiatrist John Schumaker, in his book Wings of Illusion, argues that some degree of insanity is necessary if we are to remain sane. For most people the bitter truth that there is no ultimate purpose to human existence, that our lives\n\nPromethean Love 19\n\nare fragile and contingent, and that all our plans and projects in the long run will be for naught, may be too difficult to accept. For the stark truth is that in the end we’ll all be overwhelmed by the sands of time, our children’s children’s children, and our very civilization itself. How can a person remain robust and exuberant in the face of these undeniable realities? “Are Prometheans never overcome by depression or despair?,” asks philosopher Marvin Kohl. Do they have a defect of character because they lack a sense of the tragic? Perhaps the Promethean spirit is a gift of the Gods, genetic or glandular in origin. Perhaps some are born with a capacity to enjoy and to live fully and others to bemoan and bewail their melancholy existence, like Miniver Cheevy. But then again, the human adventure on this planet would not have progressed at all if Promethean types were not around encouraging everyone to go on. While so many are frightened and wish to turn back, the Prometheans stand in front, cajoling their comrades to advance, to have a little more confidence, to exert a little more effort. No doubt we need conservative doubters who will seek to restrain at times the inflated sense of arrogance and power of unrestricted Prometheans. Yet, Prometheus is the creative and indomitable will so essential for human achievement. It is the task of Prometheans in our midst to beckon us, not to retreat, not to cower with fear and trembling, not to be overcome by fatigue, or to give up, but to exceed ourselves by resolve, strength, and fortitude. (That sounds like the Buffalo Bills after defeat at the hands of the Washington Redskins.) Nevertheless, the Promethean spirit is vital to the human enterprise, for we need indomitable exemplars of achievement, as new frontiers are chartered and new horizons discovered. Granted that Promethean types may tire everybody out, and that there are those who would much rather recline tranquil in a quiet garden, under a cypress tree, gazing at fragrant lilacs. Heidegger was perched on a mountain top, withdrawn from the world; he deplored the excesses of technology and human pride. No doubt we need both kinds of human beings. Perhaps both\n\n20 Kurtz: Promethean Love: Unbound\n\nSchopenhauer-pessimists and exuberant-optimists need to balance our appraisal of the Human Prospect. Still, is it not the nature of what it means to be human to leave the life of quietude and to seek out adventure and exploration? And is it not the Promethean myth that is the symbol of such great undertaking? It is Prometheus unbound, not the martyr bound, that is our inspiration. Alas, it is only a myth, because it involves a belief in one’s own powers to conquer the universe, though in the last analysis the universe is too vast to be vanquished by the puny efforts of man. And we delude ourselves into believing that it can be conquered. But not to believe that we can climb mountains, advance knowledge, build empires, explore outer space, achieve a more peaceful, democratic, and prosperous world, is to slip back into mere biological existence, and to live as other animals, chewing our cuds in lazy fields, fearful of venturing beyond them. Man by definition is a Promethean animal and human history begins when man set out on his own without Zeus to create a better, more interesting, morally meaningful, and exciting life.

The Greek word “philanthropy” means exactly the feeling of love for men at large, for fellow members of society. In surviving Greek literature, the word first occurs in the opening lines of the tragedy Prometheus Bound. It is used of Prometheus by his torturers as they pinion him to a mountain crag. “Your philanthropic nature” has brought you to this, they say; now you will learn to give up “your philanthropic nature.” Prometheus’s punishment has been imposed by Zeus, the high god; his crime was that he loved mankind, and gave them fire. Afterwards the word “philanthropy” becomes very common, both in theoretical discussion and in the workaday vocabulary of public life. But the ideal, this love for humankind, was first expressed in myth, in the traditional story of Prometheus. The story has never lost its power. Goethe and Shelley made Prometheus the champion of the modern age. He loves and suffers and endures, and at last he triumphs over entrenched authority and power. For Goethe, Prometheus is himself, the young poet and creator, and Zeus is his father, so that youth and imagination are opposed to age and convention. For Shelley, Prometheus is the searching human mind, and Zeus only an illusion, a figment of the mind before it found its way. Goethe and Shelley, we should note, are more forthrightly optimistic than the Greek original. Mary Shelley’s version is less buoyant. “The modern Prometheus” is the name she gives in her title to that creation of modern science which 23\n\n24 Robertson: Prometheus the Foreknowing\n\nwe now call by his creator’s name, Frankenstein. When his love and trust are spurned by everyone, disaster follows. The ending of the story in Greek tragedy was neither so happy nor so forlorn as these extremes. Instead, we might call it realistic. Prometheus and Zeus were finally reconciled, so that the world we live in partakes of both. Furthermore, the nature of both is ambiguous; it was not a simple conflict between right and wrong. The Prometheus trilogy This much we see from the Prometheus Bound. But we cannot be sure how the conflict broke out, or how the reconciliation was managed, because this tragedy is only one of three, a trilogy presenting the connected story. The Athenian audience saw the three plays performed together in a single day. Two of the plays are now lost. The lost ones were probably the first and the third. The title of one was Prometheus the Fire-bringer; it must have shown Prometheus opposing Zeus, so as to elicit the punishment that is depicted in Prometheus Bound. The title of the third play was Prometheus Unbound, the same title Shelley chose. But the ending was not the same. Zeus remained in power, stronger than ever. It seems that we do not even know the author’s name. The play is ascribed to Aeschylus, but differs markedly in language and construction from his undoubted plays. So it is coming to be the majority view that the Prometheus trilogy was composed by someone else and produced at Athens in the fifth century, but some considerable time after the death of Aeschylus. The Prometheus plays are parodied in Athenian comedy of the late fifth century. This is the usual tribute paid by the comic Muse to her elder sister; but hardly any tragedy is parodied so much as these of the Prometheus trilogy. They were appreciated in their time. Prometheus’s gift to man, which is also a theft from the gods, is traditionally fire. But Prometheus Bound offers a more thoughtful and suggestive account of how Prometheus intervened and man’s condition changed. Prometheus says of himself, “I found men foolish\n\nPromethean Love 25\n\nand muddled and ineffectual, and I made them intelligent and purposeful.” Fire is only a metaphor; what Prometheus has done is to set men on the path of civilization. They are now capable of immense progress and achievement. “All arts that man has are from Prometheus.” Thus does Prometheus sum it up. Prometheus then is not only a kind and generous lover of men, but also a most energetic discoverer and teacher. He personifies these human roles and qualities. All this suggests unbounded optimism; it suggests inevitable victory for Prometheus and mankind. But Prometheus Bound is only one play of three, the play in which Prometheus himself pleads his cause as he is stretched on the rock. The play before it showed Zeus intent upon another course and imposing punishment on Prometheus. The play after it showed Zeus relenting, so that he ordered Prometheus’s release. Though the third play is lost, we know the manner in which Prometheus was released; it is part of the traditional story. The worst of his punishment, as he lay on the rock, was to be attacked by an eagle that tore out his liver. Heracles, the greatest of heroes and warriors, came to the mountain, shot the eagle with his bow, and loosed the bonds that held Prometheus. This rescuer is both a son of Zeus and a mortal man, one of those whom Prometheus loves. Now as everyone knows, Heracles is a model of strength and daring, and yet his story, especially as it was told in Athenian tragedy, by both Sophocles and Euripides, is not a reassuring one. The life of Heracles was full of madness and violence and cruelty, and it ended in crushing failure and an agonizing death. In this third play Prometheus on meeting Heracles predicted to him, as Prometheus was able to do, the future course of his life. Prometheus Unbound had a happy ending for Prometheus on the rock. But at the same time it either stated or implied a less happy view of human nature and achievement.\n\n26 Robertson: Prometheus the Foreknowing\n\nThe Athenian milieu The poet of the Prometheus trilogy is highly original, but also a product of his times. When he wrote, the group of intellectuals called the sophists were teaching and arguing at Athens. Though Plato and others later gave the sophists a bad name, they are the true pioneers of Western thought, the founders not only of philosophy as the broadest field of inquiry, but of closely focussed research into language and social organization and much else. When Prometheus in Prometheus Bound describes how mankind is advancing, how they are developing arts and sciences, the details are clearly taken from the sophists. Protagoras and Prodicus and others had provided imaginative reconstructions of the origin and progress of human society. Other tragedies too, by Sophocles and Euripides, are indebted to the sophists in various ways. Our nameless poet was at work a little before 430 B.C. Among the repeated allusions in comedy, the earliest that can be dated belongs to January, 429 B.C. At the dramatic festival of this month, the comic poet Cratinus brought on a chorus who approached a Prometheus-like figure with the joyful news that the tyrant Zeus was overthrown. This is somewhat similar to the opening of the last play in the Prometheus trilogy, although there the news was only that Zeus had relented. In the comedy “Zeus” means Pericles, the thundering orator who dominated democratic Athens for many years. In 429 Athens had just gone to war with Sparta, and Pericles, formerly unassailable, was now dismissed from office. So the Prometheus trilogy was composed and produced in a wonderful milieu: Athens before the war, in the heyday of the sophists. Strange to say, Athens was the aggressor in that war, which lasted nearly thirty years. Athens lost, and her walls were pulled down. Sparta and the other victors did not take the further step of razing the whole city and killing or enslaving the inhabitants, as Athens had done with some places that opposed her. But Athens’ preeminence was at an end. The sophists were scattered, and no more tragic trilogies were written.\n\nPromethean Love 27\n\nThe question of origin Let us now turn away from this particular treatment of Prometheus to the story as it was handed down. After all, the story is not a literary fiction, but a myth, the common property of many story-tellers, both poets and others who have left no record. It was already age-old when our tragic poet took it for his subject. He gave the story new significance. He did so partly by adding new details, as a poet, as any story-teller, has a right to do. In Prometheus Bound several other figures come to the mountain to denounce or console Prometheus. They are no part of the traditional story, but provide the means of drawing out Prometheus’s point of view, and of foreshadowing the action of the next play. Yet apart from all variations of detail, the myth of Prometheus may itself suggest different meanings. This is generally true of Greek myths, much less so of traditional stories in the repertories of other lands. It is one reason why Greek myths have had such lasting influence on literature and art and also on theorizing of all kinds. Myths like the Prometheus story are as large and general as human experience, and at the same time concrete and vivid and peculiar. This combination of general and concrete raises the question of how such myths originate. The question has never been satisfactorily answered. Interpreters naturally resort to depth psychology, and lately to structuralism. Myths, we are told, are a necessary by-product of the mind, a virtual language for expressing tensions and ambiguities which we perceive but cannot in any way resolve. This approach is often helpful, but at the last it still does not explain why a given story is so concrete and vivid and peculiar. Let me remind you of how the Prometheus story unfolds in its fuller context, which is the creation and ordering of the world: the Greek creation story.\n\n28 Robertson: Prometheus the Foreknowing\n\nThe creation story Prometheus himself is not a late-born rebel but the survivor of a fallen regime, the Titan gods who ruled before Zeus. The name “Prometheus” has a transparent meaning: “Foreknowing.” Prometheus knew that his own kindred, the Titans, could not resist Zeus when he rose against them. Therefore Prometheus sided with the usurper. He also knows that Zeus in turn will be threatened. Only he, Prometheus, can reveal the danger. The Titans and Zeus represent successive stages in the creation story. Mankind is caught between. Under the Titans, men lived at ease, without any want or hardship. But Zeus is sterner. Men’s life becomes much bleaker, and they are close to perishing. Prometheus, the last Titan, now displays his love of mankind, his “philanthropic nature.” Zeus as the god of sky and weather controls the element of fire. Prometheus steals fire and gives it to men as an unfailing resource. Fire enables them to survive and even to flourish by means of various crafts. Zeus punishes Prometheus for defying him. He is affixed to a mountain rock, and lashed with wind and rain and lightning, and tormented by the eagle that tears out his liver. The punishment continues for long ages, and Prometheus’s suffering is terrible. But at last Heracles comes to the mountain and shoots the eagle. Mankind is punished too. Zeus orders the first woman to be cunningly fashioned and adorned with every beautiful and endearing feature. This is done by several divine craftsmen, including Hephaestus the smith and Athena the patron of crafts. The woman’s dress and crown and veil are marvels of craftsmanship. It is as if woman were the most exquisite artifact and comfort that technical skill can produce. Since man’s offense was to acquire fire and its technology, the punishment is condign. Here we seem to go beyond the original story of Prometheus. The first woman is a theme of story-telling everywhere. Although it comes into the Prometheus story very neatly, it is not integral to it.\n\nPromethean Love 29\n\nThere is another episode that is probably secondary. It is said that even before Prometheus stole fire, he played Zeus a trick. Gods and men were gathered together to dine on the meat of an ox, a sacrificial victim. Prometheus divided the meat into two parcels, for gods and men respectively, and asked Zeus to choose on behalf of the gods. But he had put most of the meat in the parcel that appeared less alluring, so that Zeus was deceived. He chose the parcel wrapped in glistening fat; Zeus was a robust eater. The deception explains why the meat of sacrificial victims is mostly consumed by the worshippers, and only a little is burnt up on the altar, with the help of the flammable fat. Stories like this are told everywhere, and any trickster will suffice. Prometheus was brought into it when he was already known for opposing Zeus in other matters. Epimetheus The episodes of the first woman and the first sacrifice are only halfserious. There are even burlesque variations. The first woman with her fine clothes and beguiling ways is given as a bride to Prometheus’s dim-witted brother, who receives her joyfully. His name is Epi-metheus, “Knowing afterwards”—“Hindsight” instead of “Foresight.” No sooner is the first woman inside the house than she removes the lid from a huge jar, evidently the storage jar that was sunk in the earth floor of a Greek peasant household. The effect is to release a multitude of ills into the world. The story illustrates woman’s nature, which from a peasant point of view is inquisitive and improvident. This is another popular tale that has become attached to the original Prometheus myth. Other peoples besides the Greeks tell how life’s ills were once released from some container by some heedless person, typically a woman. Epimetheus also has a role in the creation of man. Long ago, when living creatures were first formed from earth and other substances, he and Prometheus had the task of equipping them with attributes sufficient for survival. Epimetheus went ahead and happily lavished the various attributes on various animals: strength and\n\n30 Robertson: Prometheus the Foreknowing\n\nspeed, warm coats and sharp teeth and so on. When he came at last to man, no attributes were left, so that puny naked man had little prospect of survival. This is why Prometheus stole fire as the only remedy. Comic variations The Prometheus story was also a subject for comedy, quite apart from the allusions I spoke of. In fact, comedy took up the story much earlier than tragedy and made it popular. Aeschylus—the authentic Aeschylus, not the author of Prometheus Bound—was renowned for his satyr plays, in which a chorus of satyrs cavort through some mythical landscape. Satyric performers are naked and unadorned except for certain exaggerated features at their middle. Aeschylus produced a satyr play entitled Prometheus the Fire-Lighter. It showed satyrs scorching their fingers with the fire they have just discovered; they attempt to use it to attract some nymphs. The play was a favorite, to judge from several Athenian vases that are decorated with one of its scenes. Prometheus looks rather mystified as he stands among capering satyrs. Besides Athens, Syracuse in Sicily had an early form of comic drama and a renowned playwright named Epicharmus. In one of Epicharmus’s plays Prometheus is praised for the gift of fire, but chiefly because it was inconvenient before to cook with sunlight and take cold baths. Hesiod These are variations for comic purposes. But even Prometheus himself is not a serious figure in the earliest telling of the story. He is a mischievous rascal, grinning and impudent, who dares match wits with Zeus. Zeus has the last laugh. This version comes from Hesiod, a poet almost as early as Homer. He is the first to tell the creation story, leading up to the victory of Zeus and the present order of the world, including human society and the human condition. If there are\n\nPromethean Love 31\n\nflaws in the present order, the reason for Hesiod is that Zeus was preceded and opposed by other gods, including Prometheus. Some enemies of Zeus were violent, and were put down with violence. Prometheus was not violent but cunning; yet even so he could not prevail against the mind of Zeus. When Prometheus plays his trick with the meat, Zeus is not really deceived; it is rather that he has already resolved to punish Prometheus and mankind. Afterwards, Zeus sends the first woman as the ultimate trick, and laughs in triumph. There is very little in all this that resembles or anticipates the tragic presentation of Prometheus. The common ground is simply that a certain Prometheus, “Foreknowing,” opposes Zeus by stealing fire and is spectacularly punished and finally released by Heracles. What was it that first suggested this figure and his fate? Prometheus the fire-god? The usual answer is that Prometheus was, so to speak, a god in real life who was taken up into the creation story. He is supposed to be a minor fire-god worshipped with a certain ritual that inspired the tale of his stealing fire from Zeus. This minor fire-god is hypothetical. It is true that Prometheus was given a certain role in Athenian festivities. Outside the city of Athens, in the groves of the Academy, there was an altar of Prometheus. Nearby was a relief sculpture showing Prometheus and Hephaestus together, as the elder and younger deities of fire. The altar was the starting point for a favorite event in the program of several public festivals, a relay race in which the runners carried burning torches. Yet these picturesque furnishings, the altar and the relief sculpture, are much more likely to be, not the source of the Prometheus story, but a consequence of the story. Very probably, the Athenians borrowed the mythical Prometheus to adorn their torchrace custom. When they did this is impossible to say; it may have been as late as the fifth century, when Prometheus was a subject for comedy and tragedy. If we look outside Athens, at all the other\n\n32 Robertson: Prometheus the Foreknowing\n\nGreek cities in which the Prometheus story was told, there is virtually no trace of the fire-god. At a couple of places, Prometheus was fabled to be a local hero; one place even boasted a tomb. Bogus tombs and relics were commonplace. The drastic punishment So we must give up the hypothetical fire-god. He would not do very well in any case to explain the peculiar details of the story, above all the punishment. >From first to last, in every version, the punishment is the most constant feature. In Hesiod’s creation story the punishment is mentioned first. In Prometheus Bound the whole action turns on the punishment. And the punishment is the only part of the story that is depicted in early Greek art. It is in fact a common scene. We see Prometheus sitting with his hands tied behind him and his back to a pillar or post to which he is tied; or else he is actually impaled on this fixture. Ropes or chains are always prominent. Meanwhile, either the eagle pecks at him, or Heracles shoots the eagle. Hesiod has the same notion. He says that Zeus bound Prometheus with heavy chains and drove a pillar through his middle. When Prometheus Bound was performed in the theater at Athens, the central figure on the stage was Prometheus on the rock. In the first twenty minutes or so, the minions of Zeus are at work hammering nails into this figure, cleaving his chest with a wedge, shackling and securing his limbs. The text describes their work with grim relish. The mountain setting is also described. It is a steep rock face above a deep gully. The point of this is that Prometheus is exposed to the elements and also the eagle. The minions say that he will be grilled by the sun and lashed by storms. In fact the play ends in a tremendous storm in which Prometheus disappears, as does the chorus too. They are daughters of Ocean who pity Prometheus. Winds rush, clouds whirl, thunder bellows, lightning flashes. The mountain shakes, and the gully is filled with a raging torrent that rises to engulf Prometheus.\n\nPromethean Love 33\n\nHow this was managed in the open-air theater below the Acropolis we can hardly guess. When Prometheus Bound is revived on the modern stage, it taxes the ingenuity and the stamina of all concerned. The weather-god Now this extravagant spectacle—the mountain-top, the tremendous storm, also the darting eagle—is perfectly appropriate for Zeus as the mighty god of sky and weather. The creation story is very largely the story of how the weather god prevails over every foe with thunder and lightning as his weapons. The Titans and assorted giants and serpents rise up from land and sea to fight the weather god, who then draws upon his armory in the sky. As a rule, the monstrous challengers can be recognized as other violent phenomena of nature, mostly weather phenomena more extreme or irregular than the change of seasons under Zeus. Even though the monsters are now overcome and confined in deep or remote places, they are still refractory and cause eruptions and tornadoes and the like. The eagle sent by Zeus and killed by Heracles is only another image for the storm. A very common image, in fact. Not a literary or theological symbol, but the means by which people all round the world imagine storms in the sky. The storm-bird is found everywhere, among native peoples as well as in ancient Greece and the Near East. To shoot the storm-bird, to kill or injure it or drive it away, is to make an end of stormy weather. Many a hero besides Heracles has the task of dealing with the storm-bird or with stormbirds, plural. When the Argonauts are sailing after the Golden Fleece, they twice encounter flocks of angry birds who bring dangerous storms. The proper recourse is to shoot at them. Shooting at the storm is not only an exploit for mythical heroes. It is well attested as a magic practice. Folklorists have many examples of shooting arrows at a stormy or lowering sky they also add a few more recent ones of firing cannons at the sky. Prometheus then properly belongs to a very old story pattern, the creation story in which the weather god establishes the order of the\n\n34 Robertson: Prometheus the Foreknowing\n\nworld. The story was told, with some remarkable similarities, all across the ancient world in which the weather and the seasons were much the same: in Greece, the Levant, Syria, Mesopotamia. This is the area in which Old-World archaeologists have long been toiling to produce a rich harvest of documents in newly deciphered languages. A class of documents common to the whole area is the creation story. Zeus had his counterpart on every side, under many names. This obsession with the weather god reminds us that every ancient community, whether city-state or kingdom, depended on a narrow, fragile subsistence economy for which the only parallel today would be the most backward rural villages in India or southeast Asia. They depended on a few staple crops, especially grain, cultivated everywhere at the same seasons with the same implements, and so they depended on the weather god who controls the bright sky and the fertilizing rain. The ritual background The weather god is not an abstract concept. He is summoned with urgent magic rites at the great festivals that mark the change of seasons. During the autumn, while the grain is being laboriously sown, the weather must be fairly dry. But at the end of the sowing, rain is needed straightway. In late spring, while the grain is at the last stage of ripening, bright still weather is essential. Behind Prometheus and his punishment, we can discern the ritual of autumn. The magic instrument that is used everywhere for producing rain is the fleece of a freshly slaughtered sheep. In the Old Testament, where the Lord is repeatedly shown to be a more effective weather god than any local Baal, Gideon lays a fleece on the ground and asks for two signs which are refinements of ordinary magic. First the fleece is to be soaking wet while the ground beside it is dry; then the fleece is to be dry while the ground is wet. The Hittites of Asia Minor hung the fleece upon a pole and left it under the open sky; the following year the soiled fleece was removed and replaced with a fresh one.\n\nPromethean Love 35\n\nIn Greece, at the autumn festival of Zeus, the fleece was carried up to a site high on a mountain. The officiants waited, sometimes for days, until a sign came, whether lightning or rain or just a cloud. The fleece was credited with magic power to attract the weather god, and was called either “fleece of Zeus” or simply “Zeus,” as if it were the weather god. From this background, fleeces were adopted for private magic too. When someone wanted a dream or other visitation, he slept on a fleece, or sat on it, or stood on it, or wrapped it round him. After Zeus had sent some sign, the fleece was left at the site to exert its magic power throughout the winter. It was either hung on a tree or laid on a rock. Both arrangements are seen in vase-paintings which illustrate the story of the Golden Fleece. This is another myth inspired by the autumn festival. A wicked stepmother has enchanted the grain so that it will not sprout. The remedy prescribed by an oracle is to sacrifice the children, but in the event a golden ram appears. After he is sacrificed, the fleece is hung on an oak tree or fastened to a rock. Since the fleece is to remain beneath the open sky, it needs to be securely fastened. Hence the punishment of Prometheus, nailed to the rock, or tied to a pole, or even impaled, and always lashed by storms. It may seem odd that the Greeks should personify an object, even an important one like the fleece, as a mythical figure. Yet to personify both the actions and objects of ritual is a common practice in ancient myth. An example that is easily recognized is Adonis, a beautiful youth cut off in his prime. The name is the cry adonai, “O lord,” a ritual lament that was raised at the reaping of the grain. In Greek myth, sacrificial victims are frequently personified under riddling names like “Swell-foot,” “Black-face,” “Broadface,” meaning respectively pig, black ram, and cow (the Greek names are Oedipus, Pelops, Europa). In the story of the Golden Fleece, the boy who is led to the altar with his sister is Phrixus meaning “Shaggy”— another name for the sheep and its fleece. The fleece is also called Prometheus, “Foreknowing.” It is used at the autumn festival to evoke a sign, lightning or the like. The hope\n\n36 Robertson: Prometheus the Foreknowing\n\nis that rain will fall thereafter throughout the winter. In Greece, this is not a certainty, only an anxious hope. To personify the fleece, to call it ‘Foreknowing,’ is itself a kind of magic, a way to make things happen. Myth, ritual, and literature Thus the story of Prometheus was first inspired by ancient ritual. Most myths of Greece and the Near East come from this source. Life was bound up with ritual. When the magic purpose of a rite was forgotten, and it always was, observers told stories. The ritual, they said, reenacts a strange event of long ago. “What we do with the fleece,” they said, “Zeus did with Prometheus.” This equation between myth and ritual is often made explicit in Greek literature. In the Hellenistic period, when all the old myths had been treated in literature many times over, it became the fashion for poets to seek out quite obscure myths from odd corners of Greece. In doing so, they were always careful to report the corresponding rite. To trace the myths back to this source is not to make them trivial and uninteresting. Rather, it is to understand that the power of myths is rooted in the most ancient and fundamental human experience. The narrow subsistence economy that lies behind the creation story was shared by the Greeks, but they were able to transform it into an association of free men and active citizens, the city-state. They still kept many old ways, above all the old festivals. In fifth-century Athens, the fleece of Zeus was still carried forth in autumn, and both the author and the audience of Prometheus Bound undoubtedly had it in mind—verbal echoes of the rite can be detected. The story of “Foreknowing” in its tragic presentation is a measure of the long road man has traveled.\n\nPrometheus (1773) Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Cover your heaven, Zeus, With cloudy haze And practice, like a boy Decapitating thistles, Your skills on oaks and peaks! Yet you must leave My earth untouched My hut, which you did not build, And my hearth, Must envy me Its warming glow. I know nothing more empty Under the sun than you gods! You feed your majesty On sacrificial dues And gasping prayers And would starve of want Were there not children, beggars, Hopefilled dupes. When I was still a child, And knew not where to turn, I lifted my searching eyes Unto the sun, as if beyond There were an ear to hear my plaint, A heart like mine, To offer mercy to the grieved. Who aided me Against the Titans’ insolence? Who rescued me from death, From slavery? Did not you, holy, radiant heart, Achieve it all yourself? And youthful still and good, redeemed, Send ardent thanks, deceived, Unto the dormant god above? I honor you? What for? Did you once soothe the grief 37\n\n38 Schutz: Goethe and Daimonic Love Of one so burdened? Or still the tears Of one distressed? Was I not forged a man By an almighty time And by eternal fate, Your lords and mine? Did you think perhaps, I should hate life, Escape into the wastes, Because not all My budding boyish dreams came into bloom? Here sit I, shaping humans Conforming to my image, A race to seem like me, To weep, endure, Enjoy and to rejoice, And not to pay respect to you, As I! (Translated by H. Schutz)\n\nGoethe and Daimonic Love Herbert Schutz\n\nFor Goethe the theme of Love never ceased to be the central theme of his literary work. During his long life (1749–1832) he found in it the recurrent inspiration for his poetry, novels, and plays. In its earliest stages love was expressed in his poetry in the light, airy, playful, and gallant style of the Rococo, then in the intense explosiveness of his Storm and Stress, only to be transformed into an emotionally controlled and directed expression of growing maturity\n\nPromethean Love 39\n\nduring his middle, pre-classical period. During each phase a woman was at the center of his consciousness. In each phase it was a woman who was the catalyst of his writings. But in each phase he was also responding to the need to express the dominating drives that determined his personality. The overall transformation of his literary persona ranges from a young and impetuous love that first centers on the self, which, in the form of an inverted triangle, derives from a base line outside of himself and rushes into himself, to a mature love which extends to all mankind, which in the same inverted triangle originates within the self and projects outward to embrace all of nature. Throughout, his work is an organic whole of themes and forms, characterized by an alternating inward contraction and outward expansion that inhales the world as a divinely created macrocosm and exhales it again as an artistic microcosm in a dynamic, pulsating, poetically recreated form. Goethe is not the exponent of an established and accepted world view, but one who experiences and formulates the world view. At all times he imposes the projections of his most inward being onto the world in order to bring it back into himself as experience. The experience ranges from an enthusiastic, ecstatic, and exuberant perception of himself as an integrated, rejoicing, even hubristic part of the universe, to the anxiety of being a worthless, desolate, rejected, and isolated individuation, dejected unto death. His work is thus a reflection of his own inner way, with its encounters, experiences, and occasions. The encounters are often women, the experiences are a life to be communicated to others as their experiences and the occasions are the motivations of his work as a result of Anschauung, intuitive contemplation. The way presents itself as a graded transformation from turbulence and spontaneous involvement, to mature acceptance, before becoming aloof distance, disappointed resignation and stoic renunciation. In his late phase he was to speak of this process as Selige Sehnsucht, a Blissful Longing, of which the essence was continuous Dying and Becoming. For Goethe the search was for\n\n40 Schutz: Goethe and Daimonic Love\n\nreintegration in the primal oneness of all things, and that was to be found in love. In dealing with this topic I am going to concentrate on Goethe’s poetry. It has the advantage of compressing his emotions into a most condensed lyrical form. It has the disadvantage that the unique quality of Goethe’s poetic language orders connections into the tightest linguistic structures and is therefore very difficult to translate and only with unavoidable loss. In his autobiography Goethe states that what has become known of his work are fragments of a great confession. On the one hand, the focus on the lyrical first person allows the reader to become the lyrical participant in whom the emotional highs and lows can be reexperienced. Goethe did see that to be his function when in his Tasso and again on a later occasion he stated Und wenn der Mensch in seiner Qual verstummt, Gab mir ein Gott zu sagen wie ich leide.\n\nOr, in my translation, And when mankind succumbs in silence to its pain, A god gave me the words to tell my sorrow.\n\nOn the other hand, in this postmodern period of deconstructionist criticism such lyrics are perhaps not fashionable, though they do speak to the personal condition and I have no fear that they will survive. By temperament Goethe was an unrestrained lover. Yet in almost all of his work the reality of his passions must be deduced from the rhythm of his words or from between the lines, for he banished them from his literary imagination. However, in his love lyrics they always function as the secret source of his motivation and it is curious that he would wish to excise that which brought the works into being in the first place. The answer may lie in his attempt to turn life into art, experience into poetry. Goethe was completely committed to life, and as a challenge to fate, even to its suicidal extent. At the same\n\nPromethean Love 41\n\ntime he was wholly dedicated to love and unable to yield even when life demanded renunciation from him. As a Werther-type he can conceive only of death as a way out. Very competent and assertive in life, in love he does not have the decisiveness to renounce or to compromise and to accept less. In the total love for and of a woman he believes to have found the union which will appease his inner turmoil and reintegrate him with the peaceful totality and harmonious one-ness of all things. It is apparent why renunciation is out of the question, because, as Faust says, What have I, If I have not all? As long as renunciation is unacceptable, like his Werther, he tries to find a way between the “either-or,” as the only compromise open to him. Repeatedly in his love he is capable of passion-motivated action to support and enhance this love, but is unfree to decide actively to destroy it in himself and in the other. Years later Goethe would say that he who wants to live must renounce, but that he who renounces must behave destructively towards what he loves. That insight came after much pain to himself, to others, and with great pangs of guilt. He resolved the dilemma repeatedly by taking flight. Goethe’s earliest preserved poems date to his childhood, when he was 7 and 8 years old. These are poems for certain occasions—to the New Year, to the parents and grandparents. There is also a curious commissioned poem, 5 pages long, entitled Poetic Thoughts on Jesus Christ’s Descent into Hell, written in 1764 or 65, just prior to his departure to Leipzig, to attend university there between 1765 and 68. He was to become a lawyer. At the time Leipzig was something like the German cultural capital, a slightly decadent city of intellectuals, a center of literature, music, and the theater. They called it Klein Paris, where the gallant style of the Rococo dominated taste and where young Goethe could taste life to the fullest. He could not complete his studies. Totally exhausted and ill he had to return home to Frankfurt. The recovery took nearly two years. From his Leipzig period two plays, as well as three sets of poems and songs are extant. He burned the rest. Among the poetry there was a set of 19 poems with the title An Annette. The young lady was one\n\n42 Schutz: Goethe and Daimonic Love\n\nAnna Katharina Schönkopf—pretty, cheerful, pleasant, and loving, who “for a while merited being set up in the shrine of the heart as a little saint in order to dedicate that veneration to her which often is more pleasure to give than to receive.” From these poems we can deduce little of the true emotional and physical attractions between them, let alone any of the torments of love, for the poems are composed in the frivolous, playful, anacreontic style of the dallying, gallant Rococo and following the formal conventions of the day. He had actually ruined the relationship by playing insincere and moody games until she couldn’t stand it any more. Sensual desire, actual closeness, or even love are hidden behind formula names and stock situations. Such poetry has the advantage that it can be used on more than one occasion with more than one lady. The aim of the poem is seldom the exposure of the heart, but a clever witticism at the end. For instance (and freely translated), I just pursued a pretty maid And easily I held her tight. She said, “Let go of me, Or I will scream with fright.” “I’ll kill,” I cried with spite, “whoever dares disturb us.” “Be still” she whispered, “dearest, still, Someone nearby might hear us.”\n\nAlthough he is not yet ready to experiment with the expression of his feelings, already in these early poems Goethe betrays the future master of thought and efficient use of language, as even this little poem proceeds briskly to the erotically humorous point which rests in the discrepancy of the girl’s two statements. At the end of March 1770 Goethe arrived in Strasbourg to conclude his study of law. That October he met Friederike Brion, the charming and lovely daughter of the vicar of Sesenheim, who awakened Goethe’s ability to love deeply, something which was to create for him many deep crises for the rest of his life. It was mutual\n\nPromethean Love 43\n\nlove at first sight when he compared her entrance into the room to the rising of a brilliant star. In Friederike he found the emotional partner with whom he could share the drives, feelings, and inner tensions of his Storm and Stress and with whom he could form a deep emotional bond. The spontaneous expression of feelings found youthful liberation in poetry of then unknown artistic vitality and enthusiastic rhythms. Sentiments, words, and forms became one in exuberant, euphoric poems that needed no revisions. Two poems stand out, both written in the Spring of 1771: the emotionally spontaneous outbursts Maifest and the more narrative Willkommen und Abschied. Both poems are poetic accounts of real events—the first follows a day when he had danced with Friederike from 2 till midnight; the second describes a spontaneous ride to see her. The May Song is an exclamatory breathless celebration of life and love in which the poet feels overwhelmed as he finds himself to be one with and within the active totality of all creatures and things in the world. Love is the catalytic principle which fills him with rapture, as by means of detailed observation he registers the same elation in all things. Here the inner principles are also the outer ones that thrust and burst all around, reducing all participants to a state of ecstatic stammer, as though seized by a divine madness, and exuberant and sobbing utterance, where being and feeling are one, as all-embracing perceptions of earth, sun, elation, and joy come to be focused on the loved girl and then break out in a lyrical sigh to love, which like the rays of the rising sun beautify nature by gilding the morning clouds, the tips of the mountains, casting a blessing on the fields bathed in dew, enveloping the whole world in the fragrance of blossoms. All of this compressed into one single exalting explanation, creating words where previously there were none. His vast encompassing sweep focuses on the girl he loves with another set of exclamations that are at the same time questions— Oh dearest, dearest, How I love you!\n\n44 Schutz: Goethe and Daimonic Love How sparkling your eyes, How you must love me too!\n\nAnd he explains the fundamental nature of his love as the basic force of life for the lark, for instance, which seems to be disembodied being and nothing but audible song in invisible air, or as vitalizing as the morning dew—seen here as a heavenly fragrance—is to the morning flowers. And he sees her to be his inspiration who gives him youth, joy, and courage to create new songs and new dances. Throughout his declaration of love the poet has returned to the first person, the “I” in the duality. The poem ends with a wish for her happiness in her love for him, a case of ironic foreshadowing. As described earlier, the poem begins in the breadth of nature and gradually reaches the focal point within the speaker. It is quite clear that the poet projects his own state of elation onto the world from where it is reflected to resonate within himself. Goethe once said that the purpose of all of his writing was the re-creation of the world round about him through his inner world. The second stanza begins with a little word which was to take Sigmund Freud a long way: es = id. This “es” in German is a word filled with mystery, for it identifies that unknown inner principle, that element within which resides the mysterious causality in living things. Here it introduces that intriguing force in nature which drives blossoms to appear on twigs, and the thousands of voices of nature to our ears and feelings of joy and bliss out of our breast. In a later poem (1817) entitled Urworte—Orphisch (Primal Words—Orphic) he places this drive under cosmic law, subject to which the individual cannot do but what is his personal prescription—an echo of Leibnitz’s Monadology. The point here though is that Goethe calls it Daimon; hence the title of this paper. In that same poem Goethe also deals with Eros and its duality as frivolous Cupid and as pain-laden elation. According to Plato Eros is a Daimon that has the power to take over the whole person. It is the urge to affirm, perpetuate, and increase the self. That is the case in the poem Willkommen und Abschied (Welcome and Farewell). The poem rushes forward with a\n\nPromethean Love 45\n\nsudden outbreak of impetuosity that is instantly translated into the rhythm of the galloping horse’s hoofs as the need expressed in the heartbeat is registered as a need for action—quickly to horse. It was done almost before the thought had been completed. It is important to note that for Goethe the horse is a symbol of the demonic, which in this poetic moment carries the rider into the mysteriously threatening darkness in which things and sounds are felt to encroach upon the solitary traveler. However, Daimon-Eros counteract from within the ominous surroundings with a “nevertheless.” The fire in his veins and the glow in his heart drive back any anxious, purposenegating inclinations. Here the Daimonic is the expression of the innermost generative processes within the individual which focuses his powers and sensitivities into a triumphant self-assertion. When he meets her the poem undergoes a complete change of mood. The galloping iambic tetrameter is interrupted by a dactyl, a little waltz, to be followed by stabilizing trochees as the effect of her nearness allows him to experience a gentle joy, loving glances, tenderness, but also the mutual sorrows of departure. Nevertheless, what a joy it is to be loved and what a joy it is to love. The poem concentrates on the essentials, those most strongly felt—Daimonic drive generated by the exuberant feeling of love and the temporary satisfaction of that love in the specific case at the same time opening the individual up to love in general. The sequential logic of the last two lines would suggest that the fortune of being loved is superseded by the ability to love. Goethe’s love in these instances comes from the heart, is sincere fulfillment, one of deep feelings that solicit spontaneous, impulsive exclamations and, by our conventional standards, irrational actionre-action responses. Love is no longer play. Friederike lit the world up for him in living colors as if with a wand and it had an effect on his poetry. Rather than writing fictitious monologues for an abstract audience, he needed a loving being, equal and complementary to himself as a woman, so that his experiences could become “sayable.” She was his real audience, a being with whom a co-responsive understanding of hearts was possible. The\n\n46 Schutz: Goethe and Daimonic Love\n\npoems written for her were parts of letters to her, hence of the most personal sort. From the summer of 1771 comes one of his best known poems, Heidenröslein, often put to music either as “Lied” or as “folksong,” a triptych describing an archetypal drama, the boy-girl encounter, in which both sustain pain. In this poem Goethe has transformed his and Friederike’s situation from the personal to the objectively universal. The “es” of earlier versions is suppressed here at the opening of the first line, however, its presence is apparent throughout the poem. A curious boy sees a freshly opened and beautiful wild rose and is drawn to it immediately to look at it more closely. Quite evidently the rose is a feminine symbol. Not satisfied merely to look he wants to possess and that urge introduces the rose’s tragedy. Goethe reduces the language to an economic minimum as we become wit nesses to a violation, a defloration in fact, all because Daimonic Eros decides to be the mischiefmaker. His “I’ll break you” is answered by her “I’ll prick you so that you will remember me always and I will not endure it.” The impetuous youth does not heed the warning and breaks the rose which makes true its promise to resist. Here the German becomes ambiguous, for the “ihm” can refer to “him” as well as to “it” but is usually taken to refer to the plaint of the rose, making the outcome very uneven. However, an earlier version is more callous and lets the boy forget the moment of sharp pain in the enjoyment of his pleasure. This version makes it clear that the “ihm” is “him,” revealing the more mature Goethe looking upon this situation, and on his own behind it, as one in which there is pain for both. The experience had become an idea and the idea a symbolic image. Goethe left Friederike that summer. Both were marked by the experience. For Goethe it provided the basis for the recurring theme of fateful guilt, so important in his work. Goethe wrote a counterpiece to this poem, called Das Veilchen (The Violet), where the violet is male and in love with a young shepherdess who strides across the meadow. But rather than being picked by her and pressed\n\nPromethean Love 47\n\nagainst her breast for even just a moment, the girl doesn’t even notice the violet and tramples it. It rejoices as it dies, for it was allowed to find death through her and at her feet. Though this little poem suggests self-critical and ironic distance, it also suggests a degree of expiation of his guilt. There follows a number of Sturm und Drang poems reflecting Goethe’s working out of his poetic role and position. These poems may be educative, in that in cathartic fashion they draw out his inner reality and thus enable him to discover with greater clarity the reality of the outer world as well. German allows an association between “wirken” (to effect) and “Wirklichkeit” (reality), thereby linking the perception of the world with an active, effecting involvement in it. In Goethe’s context the recognition of the task and the symbols involved paints to the solution, as by means of a process of elimination he works out an accepting of acceptance which then promotes his integration through the cathartic relationship with symbols and myths. In Wanderers Sturmlied (Wanderer’s Storm Song) of 1772, the wanderer through a mytho-poetic world is driven by feelings of strength and the force of genius and rises to elation only to descend into dejection as he counters chilling adversities with the radiating glow from within in a sifting process that resembles a stream of consciousness approach toward a sense of poetic identity. Goethe tried to deal with the problem of the towering personality in a number of plays about Caesar, Egmont, Faust, Mohammed, and Prometheus. Faust, Egmont, and some others came into being but the Mohammed and Prometheus plays remained fragments. The Mohammed play was intended as a rejection of Voltaire’s play in which Mohammed was depicted as a fraud. In Goethe’s play the present poem Mahomets Gesang, translated as “A Song to Mahomet,” was originally to be a sequence of alternating statements spoken by Ali and Fatema. The poem was to be the first of Goethe’s water poems. It uses the metaphor of the river to describe the emergence of the great individual, who begins in the clouds, in the company of benevolent spirits, as rain to form a rivulet among the\n\n48 Schutz: Goethe and Daimonic Love\n\ncrags in the mountains from where he steps into the plain with the confidence of the leader and incorporates other brotherly streams into his course, bestowing life’s bounties onto the valleys. Immune to temptations and overcoming hindrances the river strives into the plain. Other rivers cheer him and join and recognize the leader in the brother and beg to be taken along to merge also with the paternal ocean that awaits them with open arms for otherwise they will not reach their goal. And the lordly stream calls to them “Kommt ihr alle!,” in German a clear allusion to Matthew 11.28, Christ’s invitational words “Kommet her alle . . . ” (Come unto me, all ye that labor . . . ) and the swelling stream creates life, commerce, and prosperity for cities and whole landscapes along its way until it is reunited with its eternal source, in the bosom of the paternal ocean. The obvious feature of the poem is the cyclical nature of water. More important is that this poem also points to the developing theme of the individual’s emanation out of the divine as a “Verselbstung.” This is a concentration of the self within the self which is a characteristic of the Daimonic, self-directed, determined, and charismatic leader who actively follows his sense of predetermination and especially of the unproblematic greatness of a teacher-prophet, before it becomes a reintegration with the divine through “Entselbstigung.” This is a deconcentration away from the self by a brotherly integration of and augmentation through other selves, until the interaction with the world facilitates the loss of the self in a merging embrace, in the reintegration in the divine absolute. Repeatedly Goethe returns to water symbolism and metaphors as allegories for human nature and the human soul. While the poem Wanderers Sturmlied deals with the process of self-cognition and with a subjective view of genius, Mahomets Gesang provides an objective view of genius. Both deal with the unfolding of the ego through interaction: the first through the Daimonic preoccupation with the self, the second with the preoccupation with an identity whose purpose extends far beyond the self. However, just as the microcosm is an analogy of the\n\nPromethean Love 49\n\nmacrocosm, so the finite houses the infinite, while the infinite resides within the finite, directing it toward the great totality. In that sense self-cognition leads to the cognition of the divine. The finite, which can appear as nature or love, then takes on the character of a symbol. Three additional poems can be used to attempt to clarify this process: An Schwager Kronos (1774), Prometheus (1773) and Ganymed (1774). By means of free syntax, free rhythms and free verse sounds, feelings, expressions of exuberance and ecstasy contribute to the overall effect of rebelliousness, linking the first two poems to Wanderers Sturmlied, the Ganymed to the reconciling Mahomets Gesang. When taken together the five poems reflect the stormy, pulsating life of the emerging Sturm und Drang personality on its path from rebellious search to reconciled antagonisms and reintegrating syntheses. In An Schwager Kronos (To the Coachman Kronos) Goethe returns to the theme of the wanderer, this time as the passive passenger in a horse-drawn coach being driven at breakneck speed through life into the Underworld. In 1774 Goethe had just become Germany’s most celebrated author with the success of his play Goetz von Berlichingen and the epistolary novel Die Leiden des Jungen Werther and the self-esteem over these triumphs (the great Klopstock had just visited him and Goethe had accompanied him on his return journey) stimulates the poetic transcription of a journey into a Daimonic account of a bumpy, speedy, at times dizzying trip over rocks and roots in a reckless downhill rush into life—“Rasch ins Leben hinein.” Though the next ascent is laborious, it is motivated by striving and hope and is rewarded by a sweeping view into life, where across the mountain tops the traveler gains intuitive knowledge of the Eternal Spirit’s eternal existence. Off to the side there is a refreshing but transitory diversion—a frothing drink offered by a girl—“For me too, girl, this foaming drink and your friendly health-restoring glance.” But then, restored, the passenger rushes downhill again driven on by his Daimon, past the ages of man, facing the last rays of the setting sun, blinded, intoxicated, and\n\n50 Schutz: Goethe and Daimonic Love\n\nstaggering. The coach charges into the dark gates of Hell. “Sound your horn, postillion, that the Underworld may take notice of the arrival of a prince and that the mighty down there may rise from their seats.” It probably doesn’t need stressing that for the young, dynamic, and impertinent personality the interlude with love is just a brief diversion which must not delay or halt the bursting surge through life, till he too takes his place among the immortals. The pride of this Daimonic individuality is inordinate. It is an arrogant affront to the gods and carries within it a predisposition to its own destruction. Here too there is the demonic presence of the horses and their dynamic and compelling influence on the coercive forces of life which rise from the depth of his being and care little for whatever the resident immortals may have accomplished. He sets a new tone. In his dynamic enthusiasm he may find himself isolated among his fellows and alone, were it not that in his world he can’t really be alone but rather “all one” with his world. In the poem Prometheus Goethe resorts to a very popular figure in the development of the idea of genius in the eighteenth century. Shaftesbury, for instance, speaks of the poet “as a second creator, a true Prometheus.” In the context of this paper the poem represents the height of “Verselbstung,” the mythical exaggeration of the subjective view of genius. Goethe had originally conceived of the subject as a play which was intended to represent the creative principle heightened into the mythical figure of Prometheus. The poem came about parallel to the play as Prometheus’s monologue. Goethe thought it was to open an intended Act III. In this monologue Goethe presents the peak of Prometheus’s rebellious antagonism to"
