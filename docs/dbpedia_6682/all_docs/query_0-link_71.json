        "text": "WHY WE ALL NEED TO STRIVE TO BE CHILDREN AT HEART,\n\nAND THINK IN A DAZZLING ARRAY OF COLORS — A CASE AGAINST CANCELLATION\n\nNot only have I posted videos to our Socrates Cafe channel on Youtube from my memorable exchanges during my sojourns hither and yon to hold dialogues around themes, but some are related to my new book Soul of Goodness. So many participants have suffered and in so many moving instances made their way through grievous loss, setback, reversal over these last years, personally and professionally, and it was a blessing to have their share their insights for channeling them in redemptive ways.\n\nThese also include some of my give-and-takes with unswerving supporter and dear friend Dr. Cornel West — as well as with global anti-poverty warrior Dr. Jeffrey Sachs — and you can also check out on our Socrates Cafe Youtube channel so many other deeply meaingful give-and-takes I’ve had, with Brother West (and with his wife Annahita Mahdavis West and my wife and life partner Ceci), and but with ever so others the world over, known and not known (but so many uncommonly perceptive and wise), including my wife and kids, over the years).\n\nIt has been quite something that while my book, which came out simulateously in Spanish by the prominent Planeta publishing house via its Paidos imprint — my wife Ceci, who is Mexican, is a longtime indigenous rights activist (Ceci lived and taught in an indigenous community in Chiapas, Mexico, where we continue with our outreach, and we have translated several of our philosophical works for children into Mayan languages) — has received some of the most extraordinary reviews by prominent reviewers and publications of anything I’ve written over the last 20 years (my books, all told, have been published in about 15 languages, most recently in Arabic, and five of them translated into and published in Spanish),\n\nand likewise I’ve received the most touching responses from readers about how my book has helped them make their way through their own grievous losses, setbacks and reversals, it nonetheless has been just about thoroughly ignored by mainstream media/reviewers and such in the U.S. to date (one exception being a lovely feature/interview on a public radio program in Florida).\n\nAs someone who is dedicated to making ours a world without fences, bridging chasms between human souls, I’ve been astonished by some of the remarks made to me, and about me, regarding my association with Dr. West, as well as about Dr. West himself. The gross mischaracterizations of both of us sometimes take my breath away. One particularly harsh and strident (and woefully misplaced) attack on Dr. West came from a 3-time Emmy-winning interviewer for his longtime PBS program who’d regularly feted guests, and still does on his program’s latest iteration, who share his putative goals of sculpting a more loving and understanding world (his program, though still the same, is not on PBS now but independently produced now).\n\nHere’s what he wrote to me regarding an upcoming hybrid book presentation (that proved to be most memorable and meaningful) with Dr. West for my Soul of Goodness (I’d thought he was writing me to firm up the date for our scheduled interview!): “FYI, good luck with the Cornel West thing but I personally hate him with a passion. I’m still willing to do the book but I will edit anything out that mentions his name and if it wasn’t you, who I adore, I would never even do this.”\n\nHis message dripped with condescension, and the ‘will to cancel;’ and it showed that in truth he didn’t hold me in high regard at all, but the converse. The interview was cancelled — meaning I was canceled, my book was cancelled, Dr. West was cancelled. Chilling, in a society that should celebrate pluralism, but instead more and more has a propensity to cancel anyone whose views are even slightly different from one’s own (and worst of all, without really taking the time and effort to thoroughly understand another’s views, which typically are far more nuanced and complex than initially meets the eye — and hence a central mission of our nonprofit is to really drill down into one another’s views, using a tried and true method and ethos, and to celebrate thinking in colors).\n\nAmong other things, Brother West and I do have this in common: we believe that the cultivation life of the mind and heart should not be separate pursuits. Dr. West and I both spring from the unique American philosophical traditions of naturalism and pragmatism. John Dewey, William James, Richard Rorty, Josiah Royce, Charles Sanders Peirce, Abraham Edel, Sidney Hook, Paul Kurtz, Justus Buchler, John Herman Randall Jr.,Matthew Lipman (under whom I studied directly — indeed I took the final course he offered (on social inquiry), and several independent study courses)), were prominent influences. And that (entwined with our abiding love for Ralph Waldo Emerson — whom I extol in my new book, and is the only writer who mentions both Plato’s “healthy soul” and Shakespeare’s “soul of goodness,” and in the same aphorism!) is one of the sources of our binding connection, one that has sprouted both deeply and broadly over the last decade\n\nMoreover, my reading of some of Dr. West’s earlier scholarly books, especially The American Evasion of Philosophy, and its eloquent tracing of the trajectory of the uniquely American philosophical strain known as pragmatism, was something of an existential wake-up call for me, and played a key role in my decision to return to the hallowed halls stillone more time, to earn my PhD, doing so at age 50.\n\nUpon becoming ‘Dr. Phillips,’ and garnering a teaching fellowship at Penn, I invited Dr. West to engage with my students, telling him that we were using his Democracy Matters and Race matters as texts in my course on The Socratic Method and Democracy. While my modest hope had been that Dr. West would have a give and take with us by video, he came in person, and spent a full day, on his own nickel, breaking bread with my students and the greater community at Penn.\n\nAnd so it came to pass — I write about this encounter and the growing friendship between me and Dr. West in my new book — that we two kindred spirits — one of us internationally known, towering public intellectual, the other (me) a far far (far) lesser-known street philosopher who travels the world to explore timely, timeless questions with people from all walks of life, in pursuit of beauty, truth and wisdom, and who from time to time writes some books about his experiences, as he reflects/meditates on them philosophically — became fast friends.\n\nWhen Dr. West offered on his own, after a podcast exchange we had at his office at Harvard Divinity School in 2018, to write the foreword to my next book, it was a true honor for me. Little did I realize at the time, though, that in this area of cancel culture. If you take the time to review at least one or two of these clips of my recent exchange with Dr. West that are on our Youtube channel, you’ll glimpse some inordinately special and thoughtful moments. And if you harbor any preconceived notions of Dr. West (or of me for that matter), maybe, just maybe you’ll change your mind and heart. Maybe even take a gander at my newest book, by far my most intimate and that simultaneously resonates universally, and some of my earlier ones (my GoodReads author page is: https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/64550.Christopher_Phillips\n\nHere’s the Socrates Cafe Youtube page with all our exchanges, and so much more, people visible and too often who are not but whom I’m bound and determined to make more and more so:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCELrTLQNV-1L9a6YECZ5rVw\n\nAnd here’s one that specifically has to do with cancel culture:\n\nMost of all, what these videos ideally illustrate is how we all are ,essentially children at heart, explorers, curious, seeking, wondering, ‘Why-ing.’"
