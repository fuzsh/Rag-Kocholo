        "text": "Sidney Hook (1902-1989) was an American philosopher and anti-communist activist. He was born in New York City, graduated from City College (B.S., 1923), gained a Ph.D. Columbia Univ., 1927. He taught at New York Univ. (1927–72) and was head of its philosophy department two decades for over two decades.(1948–69). Originally a Marxist, Hook later became disenchanted with Marxism and became active in anti-Communist causes. On his retirement he become senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace at Stanford University (1973-89).\n\nOn Academic Freedom\n\nThe University Centers for Rational Alternatives (UCRA) was set up in 1968 by Sidney Hook, Miro Todorovich and others in response to the rise of student radicalism in the late 1960s.[1] UCRA argued that the student radicalism of the late 1960s represented a new 'Mcarthyism of the left'.[2] The group continued to exist into the 1990s even after Hook died in 1989, receiving funds between at least 1988 and 1994 from two of the most important conservative foundations (John M. Olin Foundation and The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation.[3])\n\nHook himself wrote widely on the issue of academic freedom including his Academic Freedom and Academic Anarchy, published in 1969.[4] He returned to the topic regularly as well as writing extensively on threats to 'democratic practice' and the 'free society'.[5][6]\n\nHook defended the notion of academic freedom in its specific context. For him the 'mission' of the university was defined 'in terms of the pursuit of intellectual ends - discovery, clarification, criticism, aimed at reaching the various modes of truth.'[7] The search for truth is, writes Hook, the 'traditional objective of scholarship'.[7] 'In my view of academic freedom', wrote Hook 'any qualified teacher has the freedom to say or write or advocate' a contrary view about the University, 'but if he were to act on it and subordinate his teaching and research not to the controls of scholarship and evidence, he would be in violation of the duties and responsibilities of academic freedom'.[8] In such circumstances the offender 'should be held to account by their faculty peers'.[8]\n\nThis view was most forcefully expressed in the title of his 1953 book for the American Committee for Cultural Freedom: Heresy, Yes. Conspiracy, No. It can be argued that, although Hook was a critic of some aspects of McCarthyism, that this is a recipe for a McCarthyite witch-hunt of dissent. Ellen Schrecker, for example writes that 'cold war liberals like Sidney Hook, Irving Kristol, and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., who deplored the excesses of the crusade but supported its underlying goals.'[9] This groups writing, claims Schrecker, 'constituted the McCarthy era's most authoritative intellectual justification for invoking sanctions against Communists and their allies'.[9]\n\nAlong with rights went responsibilities he noted. 'The faculty which extends its protection to its members who exercise their right to academic freedom must also be prepared to discipline those who violate the duties and responsibilities of academic freedom'.[10]\n\nHook argued that students must be made 'aware of the existence of conflicting claims; they must hear the other side; they must hear the criticism of the nonsense about the Nazification of American culture by the apologists for Gorbachev, Castro and Ortega, and their similars'.[11] This approach which valorises the empirical testing of claims is unexceptional, though it is perhaps not clear that Hook's description of the opposition is accurate. Nor is it easy to take seriously the implied claim that his own description of the two sides of the debate is somehow 'balanced'.\n\nHook's views on academic freedom were, of course, strongly contested by other academics. Thus for example, back in 1970, the chair of the philosophy department at Colorado, Berel Lang, noted that:\n\nIn his summer visits to the University, where he warms the ghost of the Cold War at an Institute which seems to have no other purpose, Hook has aligned himself with a group of men and a current of opinion which would willingly bring the University to the end of the Lehr- and Lernfreiheit which he piously extolls. So far as Colorado is concerned, he (and they) are much more immediately a danger than the SDS in its wildest dreams hoped to be.[12]\n\nAnti-communist activism\n\nIn 1939 Hook set up the Committee for Cultural Freedom\n\nto protest 'totalitarian' - meaning communist as well as fascist - 'acts of cultural dictatorship'.[13]\n\nThe Committee was supported by non-communist left periodicals such as the Partisan Review and Sol Levitas's New Leader.[14]\n\nIn 1951, Hook would go on to become chairman of the similarly named American Committee for Cultural Freedom, a national section of the CIA-backed Congress for Cultural Freedom.\n\nAffiliations\n\nCommittee for Cultural Freedom | Congress for Cultural Freedom | Social Democrats USA | Friends of the Democratic Center in Central America | University Centers for Rational Alternatives - late 1960s[15] | Hoover Institution[16] |\n\nPublications and resources\n\nPublications\n\nBooks\n\n1927, The Metaphysics of Pragmatism, Chicago: Open Court Pub.
