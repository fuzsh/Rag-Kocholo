He argues (p. 155) that the same can be said of the existence of God. God, the sovereign of the world of minds, is perceived at the same time as we become aware of ourselves and our fellows as members of the intelligible world. This world is not objectively known; it is a regulative idea, and it is by it that we are aware of God, ourselves and others. God, then, is revealed (p. 160) as the absolute present to our thought. His existence cannot be that of an object, but neither is it to be confused with that of the subject, which is aware of itself as a contingent and fallible being. We must assert, however, that God is the principle of our existence, and of that of the objects of our knowledge. Professor Moreau's argument is very condensed, and leaves one with many questions . One could indeed wish that he had written a longer book, and also had paid some attention to the extensive discussions of problems about other minds and about God which have been written in English; as it is, when he mentions philosophers of this century it is primarily Heidegger to whom he refers. He has little to say about Leibniz that is new, but his discussion of Kant is admirably lucid, and the book as a whole may be recommended to all who have an interest in Kant and in modern continental philosophy. G. H. R. PARKINSON University o[ Reading, England Moral Problems in Contemporary Society: Essays in Humanistic Ethics. Ed. by Paul Kurtz. (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1969. Pp. ix+301. $6.95) Essays by Paul Kurtz, Kai Nielsen, Kurt Baier, Herbert Feigl, A. H. Maslow, Carl R. Rogers, B. F. Skinner, John P. Anton, Ernest Nagel, Sidney Hook, Charles Frankel, Rollo Handy, Abraham Edel, H. J. Blackham, Marvin Farber, John Somerville, Corliss Lamont, Maurice Natanson. The aim of this collection of essays is to formulate the chief concerns of contemporary \"naturalistic\" humanism, that is, of a humanism enlightened by the behavioral sciences and aware of its social responsibilities. Since it is impossible to review all of these essays, I shall follow the general policy of this Journal and select for review those essays that are here published for the first time. Fortunately, these eight essays (out of the total nineteen) convey fairly well the general range and critical perspective not only of these contributors but of the other American leaders of the movement. \"Naturalism\" is here not a technical term and denotes little more than a repudiation of super-naturalism. Kurtz reflects this rhetoric when he substitutes \"man's deepest longings\" for \"commands from on high\" (p. 6). Here \"high\" and \"deep\" are neither defined nor contrasted, but both are used to distinguish between transcendental and empirical methods in the theory of \"normative values and prescriptive ideals\" (p. 6). The difference between \"normative\" and \"prescriptive,\" if there is a difference, is not important, for both are taken to express consciously and freely assumed human responsibilities, aims, and efforts; and neither is intended to suggest an attitude of preaching (Feigl especially stresses the need for analysis rather than exhortation). BOOK REVIEWS 133 Farber, too, though he \"has no use for anything transcending nature\" (p. 255), has room for everything that is \"natural, historical, and cultural\" (p. 266) or \"physical, biological, and cultural\" (p. 262) in \"human existence in action\" (p. 264). More than the majority of the contributors, he attempts to systematize humanistic concerns in terms of \"interests,\" and to relate interests \"in themselves\" (p. 263) in terms of \"undifferentiated units of interest\" (p. 264), so that the varied types of values can be expressed in factual terms and possibly even \"arranged in a deductive pattern\" (p. 261). However, such an attempt at systematization is made less for purposes of correlating interests than for describing basic conflicts. Similarly, Kurtz emphasizes the \"organizality\" of human interests and relations less for purposes of social systematization, more for showing the diversity of vested interests and the need for a concept of \"proportional participation\" (p. 208) in democracy in view of the qualitative differences..."
