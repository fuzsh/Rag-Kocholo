        "text": "This paper examines a remarkable document that has escaped critical attention within the vast literature on John Rawls, religion, and liberalism: Rawls's undergraduate thesis, \"A Brief Inquiry into the Meaning of Sin and Faith: An Interpretation Based on the Concept of Community\" (1942). The thesis shows the extent to which a once regnant version of Protestant theology has retreated into seminaries and divinity schools where it now also meets resistance. Ironically, the young Rawls rejected social contract liberalism for reasons that anticipate many of the claims later made against him by secular and religious critics. The thesis and Rawls's late unpublished remarks on religion and World War II offer a new dimension to his intellectual biography. They show the significance of his humanist response to the moral impossibility of political theology. Moreover, they also reveal a kind of Rawlsian piety marginalized by contemporary debates over religion and liberalism.\n\nOver recent years religious conservatives in the United States have fervently contested the idea of a liberal, secular public sphere. This article urges scholars to consider that contest in light of the history of the New Christian Right (NCR) of the late 1970s and 1980s. NCR activists, intellectuals, lawyers, and government officials advanced a critique of Rawlsian political liberalism, one charging that public institutions were not the bastions of neutrality supposed by American liberals. Contrary to the U.S. Constitution’s ban on an establishment of religion, this critique alleged, cultural elites and judges had lifted the “religion” of secular humanism up to a preferred status while attempting to purge the public sphere of Christianity. Focusing on a pair of federal court cases from the 1980s, this article considers one of the NCR‘s most fascinating strategies––defining as a “religion” the very secularism meant to contain religion to private life.\n\nABSTRACT Focusing upon the continuity between ancient Rome and modern Western democ- racy, this article will set out to show that the religiosity at work in liberal democracy has always been present, notwithstanding the Church/State divide and the secularization of modern Western cultures. Thus the ‘return’ to religion that has marked the twenty-first century is not a return at all, but rather a sign that the universalizing Protestantism understood here as a hidden motor of capitalistic globalization is being contested by traditions that place the good over the right, community over individual reason. To the extent that the ‘return’ we are witnessing is against the secular State, and its universalizing economic model, it represents at the same time a questioning of the values that found the politico-religious messianism of Western liberal democracy. In this article, after showing how a certain messianic faith is con- stitutive of liberal democracy, the relevance of this messianism will be demonstrated with a study of its central role in the political philosophies of John Rawls and Jacques Derrida. Though these thinkers are rarely studied together, and are understood as presenting opposing sides of the pol- itical spectrum, this article sets out to show that they share more than is commonly assumed, and indeed, that there is an ‘overlapping consensus’ regarding their need to defer democracy to a messianic future.\n\nFuelled by the power of the evangelical right, &#39;Religion and the public square&#39; debates form a veritable industry in US political theory. Yet successive volumes frequently seem to retread old ground, making few advances. In the much less heated Australian religious atmosphere, such soul-searching can seem quaint or obsessive; yet recent political developments here, notably the success of &#39;family values&#39; social conservatism, suggest that the relationship between political and religious views might merit further analysis here, too. I will take up recent US debates about the place of religion in public debate (eg Carter 1994, Audi 2000) and argue that, although coming from widely divergent philosophical directions, they share a peculiar, and highly limiting, conception of the relationship between religious and political conviction. I will spell out where I think US debates grind themselves into an impossible corner and then point out how a more textured account of the p..."
