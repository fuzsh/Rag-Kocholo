A new set of textures for the future updates of Vendetta mod once again. Here are additional uniforms in (one of) the mod's future updates and certainly for the future MaM project. All of the textures were made by PanzerMan while new models were provided and arranged by Gicombat:

1) Yefreytor of the Internal Troops of the NKVD (10th Rifle Division VV NKVD)

2) Sergeant of State Security (GUGB NKVD)

Notes (PanzerMan):

- NKVD employees, according to the commander of the 62nd Army, General Chuikov, became the first defenders of Stalingrad, taking the German attack in the Tsaritsa River area. The 10th Rifle Division VV NKVD received the honorary title "Stalingrad Division" after the end of the battle.

- GUBG = The Main Directorate of State Security.

- In the pre-war 30s, the GUGB NKVD was responsible for carrying out mass repressions in the USSR (the so-called “Great Purge”), becoming in fact a symbol of Stalin’s unlimited power and political tyranny. But during the Great Patriotic War, many security officers showed true courage and earned high government awards (like Colonel Alexander Saraev, commander of the 10th NKVD division).

- GUGB personnel were often forced into urban combat while commanding irregular militia units. Although, of course, their main task in wartime was counterintelligence and the search and return of deserters.
