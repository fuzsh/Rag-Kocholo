Medium tanks T-28 were transferred from 10 tank destroyers.\n\nAugust. The formation of the 4th mechanized corps, located in an important operational direction, was given special importance by the command of the Red Army. Increased attention was paid to staffing the corps with new military equipment and combat training of personnel.\n\nIn August, the first command post exercise of the corps commanders took place on the topic: \"Entering the mechanized corps into the breakthrough,\" under the leadership of the commander of the Kiev Special Military District, Army General G.

At 21.00 on June 22, the advanced detachment of the division, consisting of 3 TB 20 TP and 2 TB 10 MRP, collided with the enemy's forward units, and then with his main forces. Fulfilling the task of capturing and holding Radziechów, the detachment took an unequal battle with forces about four times superior to its forces, acting with great activity and inflicting great damage on the enemy. On June 25, 26 and 28, attacks were launched on heavily fortified anti-tank areas in the following directions: Cape Holoyuv, Radzekhuv, Lopatin.\n\nOn the remaining days at this stage, the division defended the line Toporuv (Toporov), Cape Kholoyuv, often going over to counterattacks (especially in the area of ​​Cape Kholoyuv), and did not allow the enemy to break through in the direction of Busk, Krasnoe, Zolochev, and thus did not give the enemy the opportunity to encircle the Lvov grouping of the 6th Army KOVO.\n\nOn June 29, the division commander received the task of the division to enter the SWF reserve in the area of ​​Cape Byaly Kamen.\n\nOn June 30, Soviet troops left Lvov.\n\nFrom June 30 to July 3, the division fought rearguard battles with the enemy pursuing the retreating units of the 15th mechanized corps and the 6th army. The situation did not allow entering the front reserve in the area of ​​Cape Byaly Kamen, but forced the division command to take over the cover of the retreating units from the pursuing enemy units by the method of mobile defense, eliminating the threat of encirclement of the retreating units and seizing their rear services. The division consistently fought defensive battles in the areas: Byaly Kamen ', Pochapi metro stations; Zofyuvka, Kalinka; Mortars (12 km east of Tarnonol) and west of Podvolochisk. Only in the area of ​​Cape Volochisk did the division reach the rear of the forward units of the Southwestern Front and was sent to the reserve for replenishment.\n\nFrom 8 to 15 July, the division fought for the city of Berdichev with the forces of the Division's Consolidated Detachment, formed from the remaining personnel of the combat subunits of the division's units. The offensive and defensive battles of the detachment during this period took place with a clear advantage in the enemy's forces, and only stubbornness in defense in the Khazhin and Zhezhelev area made it possible to restrain the enemy, and during the transition to the offensive, the Consolidated Detachment could capture the southern outskirts of Berdichev.\n\nFrom July 15 to August 1, the division is in the front-line reserve, awaiting replenishment from the Piryatin area.\n\nIn September 1941, the formation of the 131st and 133rd tank brigades was directed.[1]\n\nLater 133rd Tank Brigade → 11th Guards Tank Korsun-Berlin Red Banner Orders of Suvorov, Kutuzov and Bogdan Khmelnitsky Brigade\n\nFull name[]\n\n10th Panzer Division\n\nSubmission[]\n\n06/3/1940 - 02/20/1941: 4th mechanized corps, 6th army, Kiev Special Military District\n\n02/20/1941 - 06/22/1941: 15th Mechanized Corps, 6th Army, Kiev Special Military District\n\n22.06-… 1941: 15th Mechanized Corps, 6th Army, Southwestern Front\n\nCommand[]\n\nThe division commander, Major General Sergei Yakovlevich Ogurtsov, (June 4, 1940 – 1941) was captured in August 1941\n\nDeputy division commander for political affairs, regimental commissar Nikolai Feofilovich Greznev.\n\nDeputy Division Commander for Combat Unit Major, Lieutenant Colonel Fedor Vasilyevich Sukhoruchkin\n\nChief of Staff of the Division Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Sergeevich Porodenko\n\nOther commanders[]\n\nChief of the operational department of the headquarters Major Mikhail Andreevich Semenyuk\n\nHead of the communications department of the headquarters, Major Nikolai Semyonovich Bondarenko\n\nChief of the front line of the headquarters captain Lev Lukyanovich Yuzefovich\n\nHead of the logistics department of the headquarters captain Alexey Sergeevich Mukhin\n\nChief of artillery division Colonel Losev\n\nChief of Staff of Artillery Major Pyotr Vasilyevich Stetsenko\n\nHead of the Division's Engineering Service, Captain Alexander Ivanovich Savelyev\n\nChief of the chemical service of the division, Major Anatoly Vladimirovich Malkov\n\nChief of supply of the division, Major Vasily Ivanovich Balakin\n\nDeputy head of the division's political propaganda department, regimental commissar Israel Aronovich Pogrebizhsky.\n\nThe commander of the 19 TP, Lieutenant Colonel Vasily Alekseevich Proleev.\n\nChief of Staff of the 19 TP Major, Lieutenant Colonel Viktor Vasilyevich Korotkov (from 07.19.40, at 12.40 already NO-1 of the 8th Tank Division), Major Anatoly Savvich Sterpul.\n\n* Korotkov Viktor Vasilievich.
