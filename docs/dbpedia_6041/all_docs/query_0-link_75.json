Book five being split into three books. This book represents the fifth of eight I plan to write. The series will contain: Volume I-Germany; Volume II-The British Commonwealth; Volume III-The United States; Volume IV-Japan; Volume V, Book A-Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; Volume V, Book B-Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; Volume VI-Germany’s Allies (Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia) and the Neutral Nations (Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland); and Volume VII-Other Nations at War (Albania, Belgium, Brazil, China, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Yugoslavia).\n\nAfter getting out of the service in January 1970, I developed an interest in World War II. I wanted to know everything I could about the war. As I read, I started to collect names of different military unit leaders. While other people were collecting stamps or baseball cards, I collected names. The careers of Marshals of the Soviet Union Georgiy Konstantinovich Zhukov, Alexandr Mikhailovich Vasilevsky, Semyon Konstantinovich Timoshenko and Ivan Stepanovich Konev, could easily be traced. But, I wanted to know about the generals who commanded the Army Groups and Armies of 1944 and 1945. Who were these men like General Andrei Ivanovich Yeremenko, General Ivan Danilovich Chernyakovskiy, and Marshal of the Soviet Union Konstantin Konstantinovich Rokossovskiy? What about Chief Marshal of Artillery Nikolai Nikolayevich Voronovand General Ivan Ivanovich Maslennikov? What were their careers like? So as I read, I wrote down names and the commands of units.\n\nThis series of books is a composite of more than thirty-eight years of collecting names. Military leaders of General or Admiral ranks are listed. In a few cases there are leaders listed below the rank of a general officer, such as staff positions within an Army or the Commander of a naval ship. The majority are military commanders from division level on up.\n\nThis book is broken down into two parts. Part one contains the organization of Military Structure and Commands of the different branches of service, army, air force, navy, and marine corps. The second part is an Order of Battle of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic Armed Forces, covering 1941 to 1945. The major difference between this Order of Battle from others that have been written is, one can trace the career of individual commanders as they advanced through the ranks and the commands they held. This will be described in the next few pages.\n\nOver the years, this book has been rewritten numerous times. As new information became available, the book has been updated. I do not claim this to be the book’s final form and 100% accurate. This author would be grateful to anyone who has any information pertaining to any of the United States leaders listed; such as their given name, date of birth, date of death, dates leader commanded unit, etc. If anyone can assist me with any additions or corrections, please write me in care of the publisher.\n\nCharles D. Pettibone\n\nRochester, New York\n\nJune 19, 2009\n\nHOW TO USE THIS BOOK\n\nThis book and the others in the series are an excellent resource tool. Each book in the series actually started out as an addendum to another book that I was going to write, A Directory of Military Leaders. But, each addendum when finally written ended up being between three and five (300-500) hundred pages in length, making each of them no addendum, but a book in their own right. So I decided to put my original idea aside and just concentrate on then five (5), now seven (7) books in this series. I plan on writing and publishing a book a year for the next three (3) years.\n\nThere are numerous Order of Battle books on the market. So what makes this series so special? Why should one decide on this particular book?\n\nFirst, the first part of each book contains the overall command structure of the country’s armed forces. Then it gives command structure for the army, navy, and air force, in the case of Germany, the command structure of the Schutzstaffel (SS) is included. For the British Commonwealth, the armed force’s command structure of Great Britain, including India, Australia, Canada, NewZealand and South Africa are included. For the United States, the Marine Corps, although part of the Navy, is listed separately. For Japan, only the Army and Navy are listed, with the Air Forces divided between them. And for the Soviet Union, the Soviet Army makes up the majority of the Armed Forces, with the Soviet Navy and Soviet Air Force just beginning to become separate entities from the Army.\n\nSecond, a complete Order of Battle is given. Most Order of Battle usually deal with only the armies of the country/countries involved, and then only at the division and sometimes at the corps level. Higher echelons of commands are usually not covered. In this series of books, all of the commanders known are spelled out, and not just for the army, but all the branches of the armed forces; giving a breakdown of all the major echelons of command, from theater level down to division. Under each major component, in the book (Army Group, Armies, Corps, and Divisions), the equivalent commands of the other military branches (navy, air force, marine, etc.) of the country’s armed forces are included.\n\nFor the Volumes on the British Commonwealth and the United States, there is a third part in the book that contains the overall command structure of each Anglo-American Theater of Operation.\n\nThird, most Order of Battles list the commanders and their dates of tenure. This one includes those, but also lists of their next duty assignment, where the officer went after leaving this post. One can literally trace a general or flag officer’s career through the upper echelons of command with these books. Making this series of books completely different from all the others on the market.\n\nFourth, military unit and/or ship insignia, crest, emblem, or patch is pictured next to the unit/ship, whenever it was found.\n\nFifth, the Appendix is broken down into several parts. There is an appendix that has the usual table of Equivalent Ranks. An appendix that lists senior officers, Field Marshal, Admiral of the Fleet, Colonel General, full Generals and Admirals. Another appendix lists some Military Units used in different campaigns.\n\nSixth, there is a unique appendix that lists the Major Naval Warships and their commanders. I know of no other book on the market that offers this. This appendix shows: 1) the silhouette of the major warship wheneverfound. A major ship is classified as aa aircraft carrier (to include fleet, light, and escort), battleship, battlecruiser, heavy and light cruiser. Two, an Order of Battle for the ship’s commanders; and third, in some cases, the ship’s crest and emblem when found is also given.\n\nSo how does one use this book? Let’s look at the entry for the Soviet 1st Rifle Division.\n\n1st Rifle Division (03/13/42, at Ulyanovak, Volga Military District; 06/42, assigned to Fifth Reserve Army, STAVKA Strategic Reserve; 07/10/42, assigned to Sixty-Third Army, Stalingrad Front; 11/42, assigned to VI Guards Rifle Corps, First Guards Army; 12/31/42 , redesignated 58th Guards Rifle Division; 11/14/43, reformed from 31st Rifle Brigade and the 100th Rifle Brigade, in Sixth Guards Army, Second Baltic Front; 01/44, transferred to XCVI Rifle Corps, Tenth Guards Army; 02/44, assigned to STAVKA Strategic Reserve; assigned to Seventieth Army, Second Belorussian Front; 04/44, First Belorussian Front;11/44, back in Second Belorussian Front; 04/45, assigned to CXIV Rifle Corps, Seventieth Army; awarded honorific place-name title Brest (08/44)): 1st Rifle Division (#1) 03/13/42 MG Aleksei Ivanovich Semenov (Commanding General, 58th Guards Rifle Division)12/31/42 redesignated 58th Guards Rifle Division [see entry]; reformed 1st Rifle Division (#2) 11/13/43 MG Andrei Yosifovich Karpeliuk.\n\nFollowing the unit’s name, it states that the 1st Rifle Division was formed on March 13, 1942, at Ulyanovak, Volga Military District; and in June 1942, it was assigned to the Fifth Reserve Army, in the STAVKA Strategic Reserve. On July 10,1942, it was assigned to the Sixty-Third Army, in the Stalingrad Front. In November 1942, it was part of the VI Guards Rifle Corps, in First Guards Army. Since no front is listed after the First Guards Army, it remained at the Stalingrad Front. On December 31, 1942, the 1st Rifle Division was redesignated the 58th Guards Rifle Division. The division was reformed on November 14, 1943 from the 31st Rifle Brigade and the 100th Rifle Brigade in the Sixth Guards Army, Second Baltic Front. And so on.\n\nUpon forming on March 13, 1942, MG Aleksei Ivanovich Semenov took command of the division. After his name appears (Commanding General, 58th Guards Rifle Division)12/31/42. This stands for: on December 31, 1942, MG Semenov gave up command of the 1st Rifle Division and his next duty assignment was Commanding General of the 58th Guards Rifle Division. Also on that date, December 31, 1942, the 1st Rifle Division was redesignated the 58th Guards Rifle Division [see entry]. The [see entry] means look up entry for 58th Guards Rifle Division.\n\nThe next part, reformed 1st Rifle Division (#2) 11/13/43 MG Andrei Yosifovich Karpeliuk, stands for: On November 11, 1943, a second 1st Rifle Division was formed and MG Andrei Yosifovich Karpeliuk was it’s commanding general.\n\nThere will be four different endings following a General officer’s name:\n\n1. Officer’s name followed by a date.\n\n2. Officer’s name followed by (new assignment) then a date.\n\n3. Officer’s name followed by [concurrent assignment] then a date.\n\n4. Officer’s name followed by [concurrent assignment] (new assignment) then a date. Ending one (1) will occur if a General officer took a leave of absence but returned to take command of that unit again (see example A below) or if the officer involved has the rank of Colonel (Captain in the Navy) or lower. In the majority of these cases, these officers next assignments have not been tracked (see example B below).\n\nExample A: from 132nd Rifle Division:\n\n... Col. Sergei Semenovich Biryuzov /41 MG Andrei Avksentevich Mishchenko (Commanding General, 248th Rifle Division) /42 MG Sergei Semenovich Biryuzov ...\n\nExplanation of Example A:\n\nCol. Sergei Semenovich Biryuzov, for whatever reason, medical, leave, rest, etc, left being the Commanding Officer of the 132nd Rifle Division in 1941 and returned to command that unit in 1942.\n\nExample B: from 49th Rifle Division (#2):\n\n... 01/08/42 Col. Mikhail Yakovlevich Dodonov /42 MG Aleksandr ... Explanation of Example B:\n\nColonel Mikhail Yakovlevich Dodonov assignment ended in 1942. Since his rank was Colonel (Captain in the Navy) or lower, and his name does not appear on any list as a Major General/Rear Admiral or higher, his next assignment or duty is not tracked.\n\nEnding two (2) will occur in the majority of the General/Flag officers listed. This will be their new duty assignment followed by the date their present assignment ended (see Example C).\n\nExample C: from 2nd Rifle Division:\n\n... / 40 Col. Mikhail Danilovich Grishin (Commanding General, 42nd Rifle Division) /41 Col. Dmitriy Akimovich Lukyanov ...\n\nExplanation of Example C:\n\nCol. Mikhail Danilovich Grishin held command of the 2nd Rifle Division from 1940 through 1941. In 1941, he was given his new assignment, Commanding General of the 42nd Rifle Division.\n\nEnding two (2), may have three (3) different conclusions. The first one, as stated above, the new duty assignment, and shown in Example C. Second, it may contain a question mark (see Example D); or, third, it may state a date, assignment, (see Example E).\n\nExample D: from 305th Rifle Division (#2):\n\n305th Rifle Division (#2) 10/26/42 MG Ivan Antonovich Danilovich ( ? ) /43 MG Aleksandr Fyodorovich Vasilev.\n\nExplanation of Example D:\n\nMG Ivan Antonovich Danilovich left command of the 305th Rifle Division in 1943, but his next duty and/or future duty assignment are unknown.\n\nExample E: from 5th Rifle Division:\n\n... 10/41 Col. Petr Serfeyevich Telkov (/43, Commanding General, 51st Rifle Division) /42 MG Dmitriy ...\n\nExplanation of Example E:\n\nCol. Petr Serfeyevich Telkov gave up command of the 5th Rifle Division in 1942. What duty he assumed next is unknown, but in 1943, he became the Commanding General, 51st Rifle Division. Since there was a difference of one year between assignments, the date of the next assignment and the future duty will be listed. Anytime a future duty assignment can be listed; it will be used instead of the question mark in example D.\n\nAnother ending that does not show a person’s new assignment may be: Example F: also from VII Guards Cavalry Corps.\n\n... /43 MG Richard Ivanovich Golovanovskiy (attached to Third Guards Army; /43, Commandant, Ryazan Artillery School) /43 MG ...\n\nExplanation of Example F:\n\nMG Richard Ivanovich Golovanovskiy gave up the command of the VII Guards Cavalry Corps in 1943. At that time he was attached to the Third Guards Army with no particular assignment. But, later in 1943, he was assigned as Commandant of Ryazan Artillery School.\n\nEnding three (3) will occur if a General officer is holding a concurrent command. At the date next to the bracket occurs, that officer gave up this command and went back to his other concurrent command (see Example G).\n\nExample G: from MOSCOW MILITARY DEFENSE ZONE:\n\nMOSCOW MILITARY DEFENSE ZONE (12/41): LG Pavel Artemeyevich Artemyev [NKVD] [+ Commander-in-Chief, Moscow Military District] /43 MG Aleksei Ivanovich Subbotin ...\n\nExplanation of Example G:\n\nLG Pavel Artemeyevich Artemyev [NKVD] who was Commanding General for Moscow Military Defense Zone, was concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the Moscow Military District. In 1843 when the Moscow Military Defense Zone was turned over to MG Aleksei Ivanovich Subbotin, LG Aetemyev did not get a new assignment but continued as Commander-in-Chief of the Moscow Military District. Since the subscript [NKVD] is also present, this tells us that LG Pavel Artemeyevich Artemyev [NKVD] was a member of the Internal Affairs, or State Security. Abbreviations used in the book are located in the Index.\n\nEnding four (4), the General/Flag officer gave up both this command and his concurrent command and was given a new duty assignment; with the old assignment ending on that date (see Example G).\n\nExample H: from 385th Rifle Division.\n\n385th Rifle Division (08/41, at Frunze, Kirghizstan, Central Asia Military District; ... ; also known as 380th Kirghiz Rifle Division): ... 42 MG Aleksandr Fyodorovich Naumov [+ Commanding General, 31st Guards Rifle Division] (Commanding General, LXII Rifle Corps) /43 ...\n\nExplanation of Example H:\n\nMG Aleksandr Fyodorovich Naumov was made Commanding General of the 385th Rifle Division, while concurrently serving as Commanding General, 31st Guards Rifle Division. In 1942, he became Commanding General of the LXII Rifle Corps, giving up both assignments.\n\nDates before and/or after an officers name and assignment.\n\nA date may appear in several forms. They are: Date Explanation\n\n09/01/39 This is the true date the assignment began and/or ended. 09/01/39? When it appears before the name, the officer had his present assignment on this actual date, but it might be earlier. When it appears after the assignment, the officer in question had a new assignment on this actual date, but the assignment might be earlier 09/39 This is the true month and year the assignment began and/or ended. The\n\nactual date is unknown. 09/39? When it appears before the name, the officer had his present\n\nassignment n this month and year, but it might be earlier. When it appears after the assignment, the officer in question had a new assignment in this month and year, but the assignment might be earlier\n\n/39 This is the year the assignment began and/or ended. The actual month and\n\ndate are unknown.\n\n/39? When it appears before the name, the officer had his present assignment\n\nn this year, but it might be earlier. When it appears after the assignment, the officer in question had a new assignment in this year, but the assignment might be earlier\n\n/4? No date was found to suggest when assignment was made. In this case,\n\n/4?, the assignment started/ended in the 40’s. Sometimes only a (/) may be found.\n\nOther assistance that will help you with this book are:\n\nThere may be a time when two officers appear to hold the same post. When this happens, the officers will be listed one under the other with the date of their assignment before their name and what their next duty assignment is and the date they left their assignment. See example I.\n\nExample I: from Rear Security, Northern Front and Leningrad Front.\n\nRear Security, Northern Front (06/23/41): MG Grigoriy Alekseyevich Stepanov [NKVD] (Commander, Rear Security, Leningrad Front) 08/41 redesignated Rear Security, Leningrad Front 08/41\n\n/41 MG Grigoriy Alekseyevich Stepanov [NKVD] (Commander, NKVD Border Troops, Leningrad) /44\n\n/41 MG Feofan Nikolayevich Lagunov (Commander, Rear Service, Second Belorussian Front) /45\n\nExplanation of Example I: It appears that in 1941, two commanders, MG Grigoriy Alekseyevich Stepanov [NKVD] and MG Feofan Nikolayevich Lagunov, were both found to be the Commanding General of Rear Security, Northern Front. Prior to the redesignation of Rear Security, Leningrad Front, the other commander could be figured out. Since I could figure out Stepanov should preceded Lagunov, since he held the position in the Northern Front. But, the problem lies that both have been listed with a starting date of 1941, so they are listed under one another by order in they left for their next duty assignment. It is possible that Stepanov had this command and the ending date is wrong, or that Lagunov starting date is wrong. In some circumstances, it is possible that there could be more than one officer in a position at the same time. But, this is not the case with other fronts.\n\nSometimes you will come across another strange entry as in Example J. Example J: from Chief of Staff, Thirty-Seventh Army.\n\n... /43 MG [Retired 38] Mikhail Sergeyevich Filipovskiy (Chief of Staff, Ninth Army) /43 ...\n\nExplanation of Example J: In 1943, MG [Retired 38׳] Mikhail Sergeyevich Filipovskiy was brought out of retirement, placed on active duty, and assigned as Chief of Staff, Thirty-Seventh Army. He was retired in 1938, since the subscript [Retired 38] appears after his rank. In a lot of cases, a General or Admiral would retire and then be recalled back to active duty, sometimes the same year they retired, to fill a position permanently or until some other officer could be appointed, and then they would be retired again. Whenever I found a General/Flag Officer who retired and was recalled to active duty, the subscript [Retired and either the month and year of retirement, if known, will be listed; or, the year of retirement] as in this case, [Retired 38]. If I could not find a year only Retired\n\nappears, [Retired].\n\nSpelling of the last name : Skii, sky or skiy. Most American books use-sky while British used-skii. In this book the Soviet skiy will be used.\n\nMilitia Units\n\nCorps, Rifle & Cavalry Divisions, Brigades\n\nMoscow Militia Units\n\n1st Moscow Militia Division (07/02/41, in Leninsk Region of Moscow, Moscow Military District; 07/18/41, assigned to Thirty-Third Army; 09/26/41, redesignated 60th Rifle Division (#2)): MG Nikolay Nilovich Pronin ( ? ) 09/26/41 redesignated 60th Rifle Division (#2)-see 60th Rifle Division.
