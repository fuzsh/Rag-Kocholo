        "text": "Russian Guard - Rosguard - Organization\n\nThe Russian Guard exceeds the number of ground soldiers of the army. More than 340,000 people initially served in the Russian Guard.Russian Guard has set a kind of record. By 2021 there were over 430,000 people in the ranks of the structure. This is more than the number of employees in the Russian ground regular troops. The Russian Guard is engaged in countering terrorism and all forms of crime. Provides public order and security.\n\nDespite the fact that the rating among the population of the Russian president exceeds 80%, the Kremlin fears a revolution. Experts believe that it was for this reason that the guard was founded in 2016, which the press dubbed the personal army of Vladimir Putin. By presidential decree, a guard was formed on the basis of special forces, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, SOBR and OMON, as well as the Okhrana enterprises under the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.\n\nOf course, no one officially reports how many serve in the ranks of the National Guard. According to available information, there are more than 400 thousand people in its composition. Note that in the land army of the Russian Federation there are only 290,000 employees.\n\nThe guard includes the \"Protection\" unit, numbering about 170,000 people. Security policy experts believe that the size of this structure is much higher. These employees are not armed and do not take part in the establishment of street order. They are a source of income for the Guard, and a lot of money is spinning in this area.\n\nThe structure of the department, created on the basis of internal troops and special forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), was finally approved by a decree of the President of the Russian Federation of September 3, 2016. This day was timed to coincide with the date of the signing of the decree of Emperor Alexander I (April 8, 1811 in the new style) on the formation of military battalions of the internal guard, responsible for \"maintaining peace and quiet in the state.\"\n\nAccording to the press service of the department, 306 law enforcement officers were awarded the Golden Star of the Hero of the Soviet Union, 172 servicemen and employees became Heroes of the Russian Federation. In 2019, military personnel and employees of the Russian Guard took part in ensuring the safety of guests and participants of 47 sports and other official international events.\n\nThe structure included Rosgvardii internal forces, special rapid reaction units, mobile units of the special purpose unit licensing and permitting work and private security, previously held as part of the Interior Ministry.\n\nOn 29 April 2016 Director of the Federal Service of the Russian Federation troops National Guard - commander in chief of the troops of the National Guard of the Russian Federation General of the Army Viktor Zolotov approved a plan of actions for the formation of the Federal Service. Among the priorities he has identified the development and publication of a joint order of the Federal Service of Internal Affairs of the National Guard and troops of the Ministry on the establishment of an interdepartmental working group on delimitation of powers, the reception-transfer departments and agencies have joined the National Guard.\n\nThis would be done at two levels - national and regional. The first level would involve the Federal Service of the Russian Federation troops of the National Guard, the Russian Interior Ministry, other interested federal executive bodies; on the second - the regional command of troops and territorial bodies of the Russian Interior Ministry in the Federal District (Russian Federation). The work would be determination of the composition of forces and weapons in the federal districts, which would continue to develop proposals for their organizational structure, dislocation, building management systems and joint use.\n\nAfter the approval of the President of the Russian Federation the structure, composition and deployment of National Guard troops would be deployed work on clarifying the main planning documents: the concept of the construction and development plan of service and combat use of troops and control system development concept troops National Guard of the Russian Federation.\n\nIn principle, the new document, to be developed, would be the State program \"The National Guard of the Russian Federation.\" In addition, it was necessary to prepare proposals for amendments in Presidential Decree governing the management, cooperation, implementation of joint tasks as part of the United group of forces (forces) to conduct counter-terrorist operations in the North Caucasus region of Russia.\n\nBy decision of the General of the Army Viktor Zolotov, sharing plans for the troops of the National Guard with other law enforcement agencies would be clarified in due course with the introduction of the necessary changes before the end of this year.\n\nThe rules and legal basis of the National Guard's operations, according to the presidential press service, would be laid out in detail in a future federal law. Following the decree on its creation, the president submitted draft legislation to the lower house of parliament, the State Duma for deliberation and approval.\n\nThe lower house of parliament was due in May 2016 to consider whether President Vladimir Putins new National Guard should be allowed to shoot Russian citizens without warning. According to a draft law that Putin submitted to the State Duma, the National Guard would be prohibited from using firearms at largely crowded places, if their use may casually hurt people. In addition, National Guard personnel would be prohibited from firing at women with visible signs of pregnancy, people with apparent signs of disability, and underage persons.\n\nHowever, members of the force would be allowed to shoot, without warning, anybody determined to be threatening the life and health of citizens. Taking this one step further, the Duma's committee on defense has proposed that National Guard members be granted immunity from any legal liability for actions they take that result in casualties. Russia's RBC News quoted the committee as saying we believe that in these cases, the risk of harming random individuals would be justified, and that members of the force \"should not be held liable if they need to open fire.\n\nAccording to other provisions of the draft law, the National Guard would be authorized to quarantine an area to control riots, and to commandeer private citizens vehicles to get to a crime scene or chase criminals. The proposed legislation would also give the National Guard the right to take full control of any communication networks, if deemed necessary. Service members would be allowed to search homes, vehicles and individuals if there are sufficient grounds to suspect them of committing a crime or an administrative offense.\"\n\nThe bill also said the National Guard would be staffed by conscripts as well as contract personnel. The National Guard would also have a mandate to take part in peacekeeping missions abroad, as well as an intelligence-gathering function in order to fight terrorism, extremism and organized crime.\n\nTo create Rosgvardii defined in three stages. The first was completed in December 2016. The structure had been transferred Rosgvardii relevant MIA units transferred to the material and technical means, the objects of movable and immovable property, formed territorial agencies Rosgvardii in all regions of the country. The second phase was to complete the creation of the territorial authorities, it would be finally developed structure throughout the country and beefed up staffing level.\n\nThe third stage - will be the final in creating Rosgvardii - from September 2017 till January 2018. This would finally complete the construction of operational services will be developed all the major governing business regulations, including cooperation with other law enforcement agencies. In the third phase of the military service would be transferred to riot police and SWAT, that is, they become soldiers.\n\nAmong the many different activities, Rosguard military personnel are trained in diving, mountain and parachute training, undergo courses for air guides, artillery fire spotters, and control of unmanned aerial vehicles. The best combat swimmers and paratroopers of the Russian Guard are military men under the contract of the Vityaz special-purpose center, and war veterans. More than half of them have the right to wear a maroon beret.\n\nThe Rosguard also has cynological units, in which about 3 thousand service dogs. The training of pets and their use in the troops are carried out in three categories: patrol, mine, and guard duty. By the way, a special pride of the cynological center located in Balashikha was the maternity complex. It annually grows more than 20 puppies, which they begin to train in a playful way from the first months of life.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20211201204434/https://rosguard.gov.ru/Page/Index/okruga-vojsk-nacionalnoj-gvardii\">Districts of the National Guard Troops\n\nCentral Orsha-Khingan Order of Zhukov Red Banner Regional CommandMoscow Northwestern Order of the Red Star Regional CommandSaint Petersburg North Caucasian Regional Command Pyatigorsk Southern Regional CommandRostov-on-Don Volga Regional CommandNizhny-Novgorod Ural Regional CommandYekaterinburg Siberian Regional CommandNovossibirsk Eastern Regional CommandKhabarovsk\n\nAn operational-territorial association of troops of the national guard of the Russian Federation (hereinafter referred to as an operational-territorial association or district) is a military-administrative unit of the troops of the national guard of the Russian Federation (hereinafter referred to as the troops of the national guard) and is created to perform the tasks assigned to them.\n\nEach National Guard District is further subdivided into Brigades.
