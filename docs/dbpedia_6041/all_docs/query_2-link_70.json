Black Prince was transferred to the Grand Fleet, in December 1914\n\nKilled In Action on the 31st of May 1916, aged 24, during the Battle of Jutland, in the North Sea near to Jutland, Denmark.\n\nThe circumstances under which she sank were mysterious for some years after. As the British had lost contact and did not see the ship destroyed, they were unsure as to whether a submarine or surface ship was responsible for sinking. During the battle, the First Cruiser Squadron was deployed as part of a screening force several miles ahead of the main force of the Grand Fleet, but H.M.S. Black Prince lost contact with the rest of the Squadron as it came into contact with German forces, at about 5.42pm, on the 31st of May 1916.\n\nThere were no positive sightings of H.M.S. Black Prince by the British fleet after that, although a wireless signal from her was received at 8.45pm, reporting a submarine sighting.\n\nGerman accounts of the sinking of H.M.S. Black Prince, show that she briefly engaged the German battleship Rheinland at about 11.35pm, scoring two hits with 6-inch shells. Separated from the rest of the British fleet, H.M.S. Black Prince approached the German lines at approximately midnight. She turned away from the German battleships, but it was too late. The German battleship Thüringen fixed H.M.S. Black Prince in her searchlights and opened fire. Up to five other German ships, including battleships Nassau, Ostfriesland, and Friedrich der Grosse, joined in the bombardment, with return fire from H.M.S. Black Prince being ineffective.\n\nMost of the German ships were between 750 and 1500 yards of the H.M.S. Black Prince, point blank range for naval gunnery, and she was hit by at least twelve heavy shells and several smaller ones, sinking within 15 minutes, with the loss of all 857 hands.\n\nRemembered on the Portsmouth Naval Memorial.\n\nPanel Reference: 13.\n\nRemembered on the Camberley War Memorial.
