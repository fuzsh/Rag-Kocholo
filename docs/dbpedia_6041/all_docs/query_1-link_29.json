Many other unit types were also present.\n\n* Excludes additional forces mobilised after 22nd June 1941, and forces immediately transferred from the Internal Military Districts and Non-active Fronts (eg 18th Army HQ to Southern Front) between 22nd and 30th June 1941.\n\nback to top\n\nReturn to the Belligerent’s Forces Menu\n\nInternal Military Districts and Non-active Fronts: 22nd June 1941\n\nNote, the following represent the actual personnel and equipment that was present and is not simply a summation of the associated combat unit’s TOEs. If the latter were used the values shown in almost all categories (below) would be considerably higher.\n\nThese military districts include,\n\nThe Moscow Military District.\n\nThe Orel Military District.\n\nThe Kharkov Military District.\n\nThe Volga Military District.\n\nThe North Caucasus Military District.\n\nThe Transcaucasus Military District.\n\nThe Archangel’sk Military District.\n\nThe Urals Military District.\n\nThe Central Asia Military District.\n\nThe Siberia Military District.\n\nTransbaikal Military District.\n\nThe term ‘non-active fronts’ is used here because although some of the above military districts can be considered ‘purely internal’ to the USSR, others contained borders with potentially hostile neighbours, or neighbours that the USSR may have wished to strongly influence (possibly invade or threaten with invasion). As such the military districts concerned could be rapidly mobilised within a few days and turned into active fronts. The two ‘internal’ military districts most inclined to this state were the Transcaucasus Military District and the Transbaikal Military District. Together these two districts contained close to a half a million personnel with significant air and ground forces, including mechanised forces.\n\nTotal forces in the Internal Military Districts and Non-active Fronts included:\n\n18th Army HQ (in the Kharkov Military District ) and 17th Army (in the Transbaikal Military District)\n\n53 divisions and 1 637 526 personnel in total.\n\n9 rifle corps HQs, 25 rifle divisions, 11 mountain rifle divisions, 3 mechanised corps HQs,\n\n8 tank divisions, 4 mechanised divisions, 1 cavalry corps HQ, 1 cavalry division, and 4 mountain cavalry divisions.\n\n3 931 tanks, 4 124 combat aircraft, 13 665 (45-305mm) artillery pieces (excluding coastal and rail guns), 2 258 (25-85mm) AA guns, 15 800 (50-120mm) mortars, and 50 946 motor vehicles of all types (but excluding artillery tractors).\n\nAdditional forces (not listed for each military district above, but included in all personnel and equipment figures) included: 3 fortified sectors, 18 corps artillery regiments, 4 RVGK cannon regiments, 8 RVGK howitzer regiments, 9 RVGK super heavy howitzer regiments, 9 RVGK high power artillery battalions, 1 airborne corps HQ, 3 airborne brigades, 7 NKVD border guard units, and 6 NKVD security/rail divisions. Many other unit types were also present.\n\nNote, in general the divisions and other combat units in the Internal Military Districts were in a considerably lower state of readiness than the forces in the Western Military District and Stavka reserves.\n\nback to top\n\nReturn to the Belligerent’s Forces Menu\n\nFar Eastern Front: 22nd June 1941\n\nThe Far Eastern Front in 1941 was similar in many respects to the Transbaikal and Transcaucasus Military Districts, because it was on a border with a dangerous potential enemy or with a country over which the USSR wished to exert a strong influence. The difference was that the Far Eastern Front was at a much higher state of readiness; to a point where it was close to being on a war footing (with Japan). Hence the term ‘front’ was used to denote the Far Eastern ‘military district’ in 1941.\n\n1st Red Banner Army, 2nd Red Banner Army, 15th Army, and 25th Army, with 23 divisions and approximately 500 000 personnel in total.\n\n5 rifle corps HQs, 16 rifle divisions, 1 mountain rifle division, 1 mechanised corps HQ, 3 tank divisions, 2 mechanised divisions, and 1 cavalry division.\n\n3 201 tanks, 4 100 combat aircraft (including 660 VVS-VMF naval aircraft, and 472 Long Range Bomber Aviation (DBA) aircraft), 3 448 (45-305mm) artillery pieces (excluding coastal and rail guns), 509 (25-85mm) AA guns, 4 000 (50-120mm) mortars, and 46 918 motor vehicles of all types (but excluding artillery tractors).\n\nCommander: General-Lieutenant A.I.

Many other unit types were also present.\n\n* Includes equipment unallocated to any specific military district. Includes unallocated equipment in one of the following states: in depots, in transit, returns for major factory rebuilds, in Stavka special training units, prototype or research weapons. For tanks this includes those in repair in factories and major shops, and high command depots.\n\nback to top\n\nReturn to the Belligerent’s Forces Menu\n\nSoviet Mobilisation from 23rd June to 31st December 1941\n\nWhen discussing Soviet mobilisation, there are two clear distinctions. Mobilised and Deployed, (MD): the unit was mobilised with a TOE after the first day of the campaign, in this case 22nd June 1941, and was allocated (or assigned) to an active front or army HQ. For the Soviets an ‘active front or army HQ’ is any front or army HQ in the west USSR: ‘west’ being defined as west of a theoretical line running north/south 100km west of the Urals. This therefore includes all front or army HQs in the USSR except those in the Urals, Siberia, Central Asia and Transbaikal Military Districts, and the Far Eastern Front.\n\nMobilised and Not Deployed, (MND): the unit was mobilised with a TOE after the first day of the campaign, in this case 22nd June 1941, and was not allocated (or assigned) to an active front or army HQ. An active front or army HQ is as defined for the MD state. In addition, a unit which was created by a simple name change from an old unit without the addition of any new subunits from reserves (i.e. not even a single newly mobilised regiment or battalion), is considered a Mobilised and Not Deployed (MND) unit.*\n\n* This is because the unit in question was already deployed on the battlefield and simply changed its name. In so doing the ‘old’ unit effectively ceased to exist. In effect the new unit became deployed, but the old unit it was replacing simultaneously became ‘un-deployed’. If there was no additional personnel and equipment added from reserves then the net effect was that the deployment of new reserves was zero. If even one new regiment from reserves was added, then the unit is considered Mobilised and Deployed (MD), but at the correct reduced strength in the FILARM (Fully Integrated Land and Air Resource Model) model used for the Operation Barbarossa Simulation.\n\n***\n\nThe Soviets ‘Mobilised and Deployed (MD)’ the following (principal) combat units from 23rd June to 31st December 1941:\n\n182 rifle divisions, 43 militia rifle divisions, 8 tank divisions, 3 mechanised divisions, 62 tank brigades, 55 rifle brigades, 50 cavalry divisions, 1 mountain cavalry division, 1 mountain rifle division, 31 airborne brigades, 11 naval infantry brigades, 21 naval rifle brigades, 3 NKVD rifle divisions, 3 NKVD motorised rifle divisions, 20 NKVD border regiments, 2 NKVD security (rifle) brigades, approximately 600 militia fighter battalions, 73 anti-tank regiments, 38 RVGK artillery regiments, 34 RVGK rocket artillery regiments and battalions, 38 engineer and construction battalions, 57 anti-aircraft battalions.\n\n41 new Army HQs and 11 new Front HQs.\n\n***\n\nThe Soviets ‘Mobilised and Not Deployed (MND)’ the following (principal) combat units from 23rd June to 31st December 1941:\n\n96 rifle divisions, 3 militia rifle divisions, 3 tank divisions, 26 tank brigades, 79 rifle brigades, 35 cavalry divisions, 1 mountain cavalry division, 5 naval infantry brigades, 7 naval rifle brigades, 1 NKVD motorised rifle division, 17 NKVD border regiments, and 1 NKVD security (rifle) brigade.\n\n7 Army HQs and 5 Front HQs.\n\nback to top\n\nReturn to the Belligerent’s Forces Menu\n\nSelected Soviet Combat Unit TOEs\n\n(Tables of Organisation and Equipment)\n\n(Note, links are table PDF files, Adobe ver 3 or higher required)\n\nTOE Soviet Rifle Division, April 1941\n\nTOE Soviet Rifle Division, July 1941\n\nTOE Soviet Rifle Division, December 1941\n\nTOE Soviet Rifle Brigade, October 1941\n\nTOE Soviet Tank Division, July 1940 to June 1941"
