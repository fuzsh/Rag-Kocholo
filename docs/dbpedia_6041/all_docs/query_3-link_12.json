This series, the Stalingrad series, features four different offerings with six dice in total, each linked to a unit that fought in the pivotal battle (three German, three Soviet). All the dice in the series are 1/2″ (16mm) ball-cornered custom precision dice.\n\nThis product is a 2-dice offering (the other Soviet item in the set is a single-die offering). Both dice are white with black pips. On the 1-facing of one of the dice is a red(foil) and black depiction of a flag and star and Cyrillic for 13th Division or 13th Guards or some such. On the 1-facing of the other die is a red (foil) and black depiction of a hammer, sickle, and sword and Cyrillic wording for 10th NKVD Division (one presumes).\n\nOverall, the dice are attractive.\n\nThe combined set of three is odd in that there are two white dice and only one colored die, which is less useful than one white and two (different) colored dice."
