        "text": ": After February 1943, the shadow of Stalingrad ever lengthened ahead of Adolf Hitler. The battle for that city had ended in disastrous defeat, shattering the myth of his military &quot;Midas touch,&quot; ending his chances of defeating the Red Army, permanently damaging relations with Italy, Rumania, Hungary, and other allied nations, and, of course, inflicting heavy losses on his eastern armies. More than 150,000 Axis soldiers, most of them German, had been killed or wounded in the city&#39;s approaches or ruins; 108,000 others stumbled into Soviet captivity, 91,000 in the battle&#39;s last three days alone. (Although Hitler never learned of their fate, only six thousand ever returned to Germany.) The battle has attracted considerable scholarly and journalistic attention. Literally scores of books and articles on Stalingrad have appeared during the 50 years since Stalin&#39;s armies bulldozed into Berlin, bringing the war in Europe to a close. Most have been published in Germany a...\n\nIn this chapter we examine the Putin-era discussion on the name of Stalingrad. We argue that the renaming process encapsulates the key trajectories of Russiaʼs post-Soviet identity politics. We aim to demonstrate that this process represents a twofold, and somewhat paradoxical, dynamic between the stateʼs bid for hegemony, on the one hand, and the inexorable pluralization of commemorations of the national past in todayʼs Russia, on the other. In other words, the hybrid nature of the state’s memory politics, neither purely authoritarian nor purely democratic, has resulted in a tension that is illustrated by the Stalingrad case. On the one hand, the debate on Stalingrad represents a state-driven attempt to consolidate a non-ideological state-centrism as the backbone of the official national history. On the other hand, however, owing to societyʼs irreversible and ongoing fragmentation, the stateʼs ability to carry this process in hegemonic terms is severely limited, and this results in open conflict and a lack of consensus between various interest groups. In order to identify these groups and their different positions concerning the stateʼs role and commemorative pluralization on the theme of Stalingrad, we plot them here along the “axes” of triumph and trauma. We start by sketching out the backdrop of Russiaʼs attitudinal climate"
