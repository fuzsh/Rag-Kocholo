        "text": "Records Research\n\nTo learn how to make public records copy requests, view the Public Records Copy Requests tab.\n\nTitle Searches - Recording Information\n\nClerk’s Office personnel are available to assist patrons in utilizing all resources in the Record Room.\n\nRecording information relating to land transactions is not provided via telephone or email. Customers in need of this information should review the online index and/or contact the Clerk's Office to obtain copies.\n\nClerk’s Office personnel are prohibited by law from giving legal advice and are unable to perform title searches. Should you require a title search or legal advice, you are encouraged to contact an attorney or title insurance company, or both.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nReal Estate Assessments\n\nGIS Parcel Viewer\n\nChesterfield County Public Library - Genealogy Research\n\nThe Library of Virginia\n\nChesterfield Historical Society\n\nDeed Book Recording Requirements\n\nGeneral Requirements for Paper Recordings\n\nDocuments must be authorized by law to be recorded in the Deed Book and must meet applicable statutory provisions in the Code of Virginia. Additionally, document must:\n\nbe originals that have been signed and properly notarized\n\ninclude a Land Records Cover Sheet\n\ninclude a self-addressed, stamped envelope (SASE) to ensure the safe and timely return of the original document\n\nFor deeds, the amount of consideration must be stated on the first page of the document (i.e., not only on the Land Records Cover Sheet).\n\nTax ID Numbers on Documents Presented for Recording in the Deed Book\n\nPursuant to Code of Virginia § 17.1-252, any deed or other instrument conveying or relating to an interest in real property must include, on the first page of the deed or other instrument, the tax ID number(s) of the affected parcel(s). Place the tax ID number in the upper left corner of the first page after allowing a one-inch margin pursuant to Library of Virginia standards.\n\nChesterfield's standard tax ID number is 15 digits and can be obtained from the Real Estate Assessor.\n\nSocial Security Numbers on Documents Presented for Recording in the Deed Book\n\nPursuant to Code of Virginia § 17.1-227, the Clerk's Office will not knowingly accept any instrument submitted for recordation in the Deed Book that includes the social security number.\n\nReturn of Recorded Documents\n\nDocuments submitted by eRecording are returned to the filer immediately after recordation. Filers who include a self-addressed, stamped envelope (SASE) can receive paper documents returned by mail. Documents that are not accompanied by a SASE will be maintained in the Record Room for pickup.\n\nRecording Fees\n\nFees and taxes vary according to the type of document being recorded. The deed calculation tool, provided by the Supreme Court of Virginia, assists users with determining recording costs. To determine applicable fees, select the Chesterfield Circuit Court and enter the requested information for the document(s) to be recorded.\n\nFor further inquiries relating to recording fees or requirements, please call 804-748-1285 to speak with a staff member in the Deed Recording Division.\n\nJudgments\n\nDomestic Judgments\n\nThe fee for docketing a judgment obtained in a Virginia court is $10. Judgments that do not meet the requirements of Code of Virginia § 8.01-446 cannot be docketed and will be returned to the presenting party.\n\nForeign Judgments\n\nForeign judgments filed in accordance with the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act or the Uniform Foreign Country Money-Judgments Recognition Act are docketed for a fee of $25.\n\nJudgment Releases\n\nBy law, it is the duty of the judgment creditor (or their agent or attorney) to ensure that judgments are released upon satisfaction. There is no fee to release a judgment. Creditors may access forms for releasing a judgment at the Supreme Court of Virginia.\n\nLiens on Property\n\nThe Clerk's Office maintains permanent land and court records dating from 1749, the year of the county's inception, to present. The Record Room is located on the ground floor of the main Courts Building.\n\nDeeds, liens, and other land records must speak for themselves and the staff of the Circuit Court Clerk's Office cannot interpret or restate information included in such records.\n\nIndexes are organized by name, not property address or by legal description. Due to the complexity of land records, researchers may need to consult an attorney or title company to determine the legal impact of liens or other documents recorded.\n\nOnline Index:\n\nLand Records (Deeds 1967 to current; Wills 1994 to current)\n\nPlats/Surveys\n\nIf a plat/survey was recorded, it can be obtained from the Circuit Court Clerk's Office. Individual surveys which show the lot with improvements (such as a house) are occasionally attached to deeds; however, since they are not required to be recorded, most often, they are not.\n\nOften surveys showing property lines are drafted at the time of sale and the homeowner receives a copy with other closing papers. If the survey was not recorded and the homeowner cannot find one with their closing papers, a surveying company will need to be contacted.\n\nCopies of subdivision plats (showing property lines only, not improvements) are available on this website. The online copy made available by the Real Estate Assessor is not considered the official recorded subdivision plat; however, it may be useful for informational purposes.\n\nThe Circuit Court Clerk's Office is the official repository for subdivision plats that have been recorded. Land records are available for public inspection in the Record Room which is open to the public from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday (excluding holidays). The Record Room is located on the ground floor of the main Courts Building.\n\nBlueprints\n\nThe Circuit Court Clerk's Office does not maintain blueprints. Contact Chesterfield Building Inspection or the builder to determine if they can assist.\n\nForeclosure Lists\n\nNo master list of pending private auctions/foreclosures is available through Chesterfield County. Private auction/foreclosure information is often printed in the Richmond Times-Dispatch and other publications that print legal notices.\n\nFor information regarding the process by which the Chesterfield Treasurer's Office handles properties with significant back taxes due, visit the Treasurer's Office page.\n\nUpdating Deeds/Ownership\n\nAs there are no forms by which to prepare a new deed that the Circuit Court Clerk's Office can make available, it is recommended that property owners contact an attorney who handles real estate matters for assistance. There is no requirement to have an attorney prepare the document; however, to ensure it meets statutory requirements and the owner's, legal needs, it may be best to consult an attorney.\n\nClerk's Office staff are unable to provide legal advice. Once the deed is executed, it would need to be recorded in the Clerk's Deed Book. If planning to present it for recordation personally, once the deed is prepared, contact the Clerk's Deed Recording Division at 804-748-1285. Once recorded, the Real Estate Assessor would be notified of the recordation and that office would update its records accordingly."
