        "text": "Recording property-related documents\n\nThe Office of the City Register records and maintains New York City real property and certain personal property transfer records, such as mortgage documents for property in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. (Please contact the Richmond County Clerk for properties in Staten Island.)\n\nProperty records are public. People may use these records for background information on purchases, mortgages, asset searches, and other legal and financial transactions. Reviewing these documents is not necessarily the same as a title search.\n\nOnline document recording\n\nProperty documents are recorded and maintained on the Automated City Register Information System (ACRIS). ACRIS provides online access to property documents and data dating back to 1966. For documents before 1966, please visit the Land Records Research Library, located at the Queens City Register Office at 144-06 94th Avenue, Jamaica, NY 11435. Records can be accessed Monday through Friday, 8:30am to 4:30pm.\n\nDeed fraud alert"
