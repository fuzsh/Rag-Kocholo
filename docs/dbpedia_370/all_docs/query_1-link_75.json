It was stolen from and returned to the Iraq Museum in 2003.\n\nPhoto by @Mehiyar\n\nKnown as the Lady of Warka, this life-sized model of a head often interpreted to be that of a woman, is suspected by some to be part of the figure of a goddess.\n\nEither way, it is an incredibly early depiction of a human face from the late 4th millennium BCE. Photo by @Mehiyar\n\nIn the Middle Babylonian, or Kassite, period in ancient Mesopotamia, boundary stones were used to record land grants.\n\nThey often featured mythological figures and iconography, like the crescent of the moon god SÃ®n (top left) and a lightning fork (bottom left). Photo by @Mehiyar\n\nStumbled upon this beautiful guide to the Iraq Museum that opens with a foreword by Dr. Amira Edan.\n\nIn her words, âMesopotamia is the cradle of civilisation, and its museum is a vast colourful window displaying the authentic and priceless objects created by an immortal people.â\n\nMissing some Tweet in this thread?

Typing âkalbuâ (dog) will generate an error, but typing âkal-buâ will generate cuneiform cuneifyplus.arch.cam.ac.uk\n\nIf your computer or keyboard make downloading a font impossible, and your cuneiform is too rusty for Cuneify, you can copy and paste signs from free online sources.\n\nFor example, here is a basic and searchable list of Neo-Assyrian cuneiform signs sumerisches-glossar.de/download/SignLâ¦\n\nRead 4 tweets\n\nBefore even the Epic of Gilgamesh, a story written in the Akkadian language, is the Sumerian myth known today as âBilgames and Huwawaâ.\n\nGilgamesh is called by his name in Sumerian, Bilgames, and in the story, he proposes a journey to the fabled mountains where cedars grow\n\nIn the Sumerian story of Bilgames/Gilgamesh and Huwawa, the heroâanxious about mortalityâwants to journey to the Cedar Mountain to establish his fame.\n\nâPeople are lost, that fills me with dismay...corpses in the water make the river almost overflow...This will happen to me tooâ\n\nHe and Enkidu follow the constellations to the mountains where cedars grow in search of the perfect tree to fell.\n\nBut Huwawa, the guardian of the cedar forest, awakens and unleashes his terrors on the two, who fall unconscious\n\nRead 7 tweets\n\nTeaching a class on wisdom literature in ancient Mesopotamia this term, which has meant perusing proverbs for students to translate.\n\nProverbs were also copied down and translated by Babylonian students as part of scribal education. They may reflect popular sayings (or not).\n\nAnyway, here is a selection of Sumerian proverbs about dogs that are lovely and, perhaps, a little bit relatable.\n\nâThe dog understands: âTake it!â It does not understand: âPut it down!ââ\n\nur sa6-ga ur-tur-Å¡Ã¨ in-ku4\n\nThis Sumerian proverb reads, âA dog which is played with turns into a puppy.â\n\nAnother possible (more literal) translation of this proverb is, âA sweet dog has become a puppy again.â\n\nRead 7 tweets\n\nRelated threads\n\n#thread on the perils of workplace knowledge-hiding:\n\n\"firms with a high-trust environment, where employees can collaboratively and transparently share knowledge, gain stock returns two to three times higher than the industry average and have 50% lower turnover rates\"\n\n\"When we deliberately withhold or conceal information from each other, we are doing something called 'knowledge hiding,' an action that can take several different forms.\"\n\n\"We may pretend to be uninformed, provide inaccurate information to those who ask us, promise to share information but never intend to, or find excuses to tell people that we canât share when we actually can.\"\n\nRead 18 tweets\n\n#Thread\n\nI have just boarded the flight to #Srinagar. The only way I could find to reach my parents. I haven't been able to contact them since past 4 days. This is the story of every #Kashmiri living away from the valley --a valley writhing under the weight of brute force #Kashmir\n\nOnce I reach there, I'll be incommunicado. No phones, no internet, not even landlines. This air journey feels like one down an abyss. I'll give an update when it's possible to. I don't have the faintest idea when that will be possible. I am surrounded by numb Kashmiris #Kashmir\n\nThere is so little I know about my people there. Yet I know so much. My mother's eyes would be red by now -- from hours of crying and lack of sleep. My father would be weaker than before. They'll hug me and cry, I know, even when I don't know how I'll reach home. #Kashmir\n\nRead 8 tweets\n\nTHREAD: all the times Justin Bieber betrayed Selena Gomez\n\nSo youâve probably seen all these viral Portuguese and Spanish tweets regarding the matter, so Iâm here to translate this into English\n\nMost of this information sources from The Story Rares.

MEET Estela and Nicolas. Today they got married. For anyone else this would be just a picture of a normal wedding day, but for these two, there is much more than meets the eye. For them, this is a story of the triumph of love and hope.\n\n2. 3 weeks ago I was approached by someone at my parish.\n\n-âFather, there is a couple who wants to get married.â\n\n-âI am glad to hear that. Tell them to call me & we will set up a meeting.â\n\n-âWellâ she said, âthis is the thing. They are in the hospital. Could you come please?â\n\n3. I went to visit them, only to find out that Estela, a beautiful 26 year old woman, had cancer that spread all over her body. Doctors give her a limited time of life. I saw her husband to be, by her side, with a sad smile in his eyes, asking me for hope and a miracle.\n\nRead 13 tweets\n\nTrending hashtags\n\nEmbed code for your website:"
