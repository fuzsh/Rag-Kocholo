Too expensive and too long for typical Ghanians\n\nProject TeamESRI Business Partners • Opportunity International • Serving as a trusted broker • First of a kind dimension to microfinance • International Land Systems (ILS) • SAMBUS (ESRI in-country Distributor) • Trimble Navigation • CIDG – Corporate Initiatives Development Group\n\nProject ObjectivesDevelop a bottom-up approach to land registration • Practical Implementation • Build a process for cost and time effective land registration/titling for the poor • Microfinance focus – entrepreneurial poor • Client-centric focus – demand driven • Work with Government to avoid duplication . . . Leverage new technology as the foundation for prosperity\n\nOur New MethodologyStreamlined approach to land registration • Use consolidated onsite interview, • survey and document review process • Go to the clients • Leverage Technology • GIS • GPS • Titling software • Imagery • Video, Audio, etc. • Use data to derive a para-legal title certificate • “Provisional Title” is part of law • Paralegal title conforms to provisional title parameters • Pre-approved approach • Registrar to issue provisional titles based on paralegal certificate\n\nTechnologyESRI ArcGIS Server based system • ArcGIS Server-based ILS MultiCadastre Software manages all data and documents • Property documents • Photographs • Video • Very low cost per user\n\nLand Claim Survey in Timor LesteAn example from USAID… • Newest country in Asia • 1 million people • 100,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) • 15,000 km square • 70% infrastructure destroyed (1999) Source: Nick Thomas & Kim Glenn, ARD\n\nLand Claim Survey in Timor Leste An example from USAID… • Using GIS and Mobile Technology to identify and record land property claims • Ongoing maintenance of records to support a future land title registration system • ArcGIS is underlying land information management system Source: Nick Thomas & Kim Glenn, ARD\n\nGIS for Cadastre, Valuation & Address ManagementLithuania’s State Enterprise Centre of Registers (SECR) • Responsible for Real Property Cadastre and Register, Address Register, and Register of Legal Entities. • Performs real estate valuation for taxation purposes • SECR uses ESRI’s GIS technology for Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) and to update, manage and distribute cadastral and real estate information for: • 2 million land parcels • 700,000 buildings • 500,000 engineering constructions and utilities.\n\nIntegrated Land Registry and Cadastral Information SystemTurkey – General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre (GDLRC) • Responsible for all cadastre and land registration in Turkey • ESRI GIS enables full integration of cadastral and land registry systems • Automated workflow management tools model cadastral laws and business processes • Business benefits: • Operational efficiencies • Increased customer satisfaction • Improved data quality and consistency\n\nUnified Information System for Cadastre and Property RegisterBulgarian Agency of Geodesy, Cartography and Cadastre and the Registers Agency • Unifying operations across agencies • ESRI GIS is the integrating information system • Business benefit – all users have access to the same property information\n\nThe Business Case for Using GISHargeisa, Somaliland Investment of US$48,500 for property survey– revenue of US$440,000 in first year • Development of a property classification schema using the Property Database • More equitable tax rates based on property characteristics • Significant returns on investment • Sustainable business model Previous: 15,850 properties = $145,000 per annum Now: 59,000 properties = $440,000 per annum New tax revenue: $710,000 per annum Source: Jan Turkstra, UN HABITAT\n\nSite Analysis of the EnvironmentCaracas, Venezuela • Analysis of the social and environmental factors that affect urban poverty • Identify and understand the complexities of Barrio Petare Source: Rosario Gusti de Perez and Ramon Perez\n\nCommunity Participation to Identify Alternatives Caracas, Venezuela • Scenario 2 – Proposed succession of inroad penetrations • Scenario 1 – Proposal for a North-South axis Source: Rosario Gusti de Perez and Ramon Perez\n\nGIS Adds Value GIS leverages data for many uses. . . Reconstruction Iraq • Urban Planning • Slum upgrading • Sanitation • Transportation • Safety • Flood zones • Hazardous areas • Illegal occupation • Health & Human Services • Access to facilities • Illness tracking/Mapping • Managed care • Spatial Data Infrastructures • Many, Many more. . . .
