        "text": "One of our primary functions is the recording and processing of land records. We accept the document for recording, stamp it with the date and time, calculate the recording fees and collect a State conveyance tax and a Town conveyance tax according to the sales price. In this regard, one of our functions is acting as the Tax Collector for the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services. For this we receive no compensation.\n\nA Connecticut Real Estate Conveyance Tax Return must accompany the deed when it is recorded. The return must be complete and accurate. We assess the charge for the tax and attach the check which is made out to Commissioner of Revenue Services to the form. This must be forwarded to the Department of Revenue Services in a timely manner. If there is no price stated in the deed, a Town Conveyance Tax form must accompany the deed, stating the price paid.\n\nRecord Stamping\n\nNext, we assign a volume and page to the document, stamp it with the conveyance tax collected and with a \"received for record stamp\" showing date and time of receipt. We darken all seals so they will show up in microfilming. The document is then indexed into our computer system and a list is run off. It is edited and corrected, then run off and put into a daybook, which is a chronological index of documents. At the end of the month, this index is alphabetized and entered into our Grantor/Grantee Indices. These are the master indices for all documents recorded in our office. Accuracy and consistency is of the utmost importance.\n\nDocument Scanning & Printing\n\nNext we scan each document. After scanning, we are able to print the document and put it into a hard-cover book in the vault for immediate use. The customer is also able to view the document on the computer screen and to make copies of it also. At the end of each month, the data is sent electronically to Cott Systems, our computer vendor who handles data for Town Clerks around the country. At Cott Systems, they process the data and put in onto microfilm which is then stored in an underground facility called Iron Mountain in New York State for safekeeping. Documents are now processed so quickly that the originals can be returned to the attorney, the bank or buyer very quickly, sometimes the next day."
