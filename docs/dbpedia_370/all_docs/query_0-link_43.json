Riggs; Treas, Wllllam Dana Seibert; Sec, Herbert D.Seibert. Addresses of all. Office of Co. The Financial Situation. Advances in discount rates and other important changes have •again set the markets, investors and speculators agog. On Monday afternoon, after the close of the market, the Boston Federal Reserve Bank increased its rediscount rate from 3/ 1 2% to 4%. Meeting early on Thursday, the directors of the Bank of England did not raise the British rate, nor did the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at their meeting the same afternoon. The Boston move, however, has served a very salutary purpose. The New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday in a violent decline broke practically all records, demonstrating the existence of a weak technical situation in speculative accounts, and also a widespread conviction on the part of the public -that restraint in speculation, which had been required for the good of the community, had not been applied, either through necessity or through the moral resistance of the persons concerned. However, the market since then has again been bounding upward with the same rapidity as before At the period of greatest depression, the railroad stocks were brought forward, as so many times before, and held strong in order to steady the general market, but this time the advance in them has been carried to greater extremes, and yesterday these railroad stocks, particularly in the afternoon, shot upward in much the same way as the specialties have previously been doing. There is, of course, more room for a rise in them since their antecedent advances have in most cases been so much more moderate, but even in the railroad list it is possible to overdo the movement, and it behooves everyone to proceed with caution in making purchases.. NO.3151, What is happening throughout the world is a very -general assertion of the law that \"to him who hath shall be given, and from him who hath not shall be taken away, even that which he hath.\" This is not the only cause operating in the financial markets, but it is not without very important influence. The situation in the United States has gathered strength and is continuing to do so, because the fundamental conditions of business have been sound, and are thought likely to remain so. There is, therefore, in the United States, not only a rapid growth of business, but business here is attracting unto itself liquid funds from all over the world where conditions are not as favorable. The world's capital in inclining to the United States is not Only seeking protection, but opportunity for investment and profit. There is an abundance of liquid capital in Great Britain at the present time, but lack of opportunity for profitable investment. British funds in seeking the markets of the world find the greatest allurement in the United States. On the Continent and elsewhere the individual situations differ, but almost everywhere liquid capital is looking toward the United States either for greater protection or greater opportunity. The British desire to keep money rates as low as possible in order to stimulate a dull business situation. On the other hand, high rates are desirable in order to maintain the pound at parity and prevent too great a flow of capital toward New York. The Federal Reserve banks by their operations in augmenting the supply of credit and currency, and thus keeping the money market unduly easy, are serving directly to promote the speculative frenzy which everyone is now deploring as an evil. Certainly for business purposes in America capital is plentiful and funds are abundant. Even with increased rediscount rates money is not high, and it cannot be considered so. If stock market prices are high in respect to 3/ 1 2and 4% rediscount rates, then they are too high, as these rates are no more than normal, but in this respect it should be observed that at the bottom of all bear markets some stocks are too high, and at the top of all bull markets swe stocks have not attained their full value. Adjustments as between changing values are always necessary. Here in the United States we have one of the largest and most richly endowed habitable areas in the world. In this a large population has set up for itself conditions of political and religious freedom, universal education and transportation, and policies in respect to property, capital, labor and all economic questions, which are more and mOre appealing to the world as sound, and which appear to be developing along proper lines. In this generally 2316 THE CHRONICLE wholesome situation the elements of growth and progress are now in dominance under a more than ordinarily favorable political administration, and this growth is at present being accelerated through that fundamental law already referred to. It is, of course, true that forward movements are not continuous, and the present chapter of prosperity can hardly be expected to continue without modifications and setbacks. Special favoring influences the present week have been the declaration of an extra cash dividend of $5 a share on General Motors common stock, which may be taken as an indication of the favorable situation of the motor industry, and the resumption of dividends on American Sugar Refining common stock in face of the depression of the sugar trade. Generally speaking, business is in exceptionally' sound condition. The foundation of prosperity has not been destroyed. The one bad feature of the situation is the unrestrained gambling in stocks. This, of course, if continued will destroy its own ends by bringing about a bad business situation, especially as there is also considerable real estate speculation at the moment in all parts of the country. It is to be hoped that these two speculations may be brought under restraint and control before they produce havoc. Conditions in the cotton belt during the last two weeks of October, according to the semi-monthly report on the current cotton crop in the United States, issued by the Department of Agriculture at Washington on Monday of this week, further improved, and accordingly, 160,000 bales more has been added to the estimate of probable yield this year, making the latest figures of production 15,386,000 bales: This relates to the condition of the crop on Nov. 1. Two additional reports are to follow before the final estimate of yield, one under date of Nov. 16 and the last one Dec. 1. Last year the final estimate of yield was 13,627,936 bales, and not since 1914 , when the production was 16,134,930 bales, has the growth of cotton in any year exceeded the present estimate of the Agricultural Department. The latest Government report states that for the 1924 crop the Nov. 1 1924 estimate was 6% below the final ginning returns. Apparently full precaution has been taken against any such underestimate the present season. A year ago picking in some sections of the cotton belt continued until Christmas. Such may be the case this year. Even though the 1925 acreage is enormous, being 44,231,000 acres, or nearly 7% in excess of the area harvested for 1924, the latter in turn having exceeded that of any preceding year, the constant and heavy increase in the estimate of yield per acre that has characterized the Government reports during the past two months, would appear to make ample allowance for all favorable developments, present and prospective. On the other hand, however, it should not be forgotton that in addition to the actual products of lint cotton, there will be about 1,000,000 bales of linters. Between the periods covered by. the reports of Oct. 18 and Nov. 1 this year, the latter being the latest to date, some noteworthy changes in the estimated yield per acre, as to a number of important sections, have occurred. For such important States as Mississippi and Louisiana the increase covering the above mentioned dates of two weeks have been, respectively, nine and eight pounds per acre each, [VOL 121. the average yield per acre for the first mentioned State now being 266 pounds and for the latter 227 pounds; in 1924 the corresponding figures for these two States were, respectively, 176 pounds and 145 pounds. The latest increase this year for Georgia has been five pounds per acre, and for Alabama three pounds. Missouri, where the crop is not large, shows a gain of fifteen pounds per acre in the latest report. In Texas the increase is from 117 pounds per acre Oct. 18 to 118 on Nov. 1. The final estimate for that State in the 1924 report, however, was 138 pounds per acre. Oklahoma and North Carolina both show a decrease during the two weeks and are the only States that do, the former of six pounds and the latter of nine pounds per acre, but for North Carolina the average yield per acre in the latest report for this year is 242 pounds, in contrast with 196 pounds per acre, the final estimate for that State in 1924, and the North Carolina crop in this last mentioned year having been poor. For the entire cotton belt the Nov. 1 report this year places the yield per acre at 166.4 pounds,in contrast with 164.7 pounds Oct. 18, and 157.4 pounds, the final census ginnings for 1924. In practically all of the cotton States, excepting.Texas, the latest estimate of production exceeds that of 1924, and as to some of these States the increase is very large. As to practically all of them, excepting North Carolina and Oklahoma, a larger production is indicated this year in the Nov. 1 figures than appeared in the report for Oct. 18. Texas is now put down for 4,100,000 bales, against 4,050,000 bales two weeks earlier, but comparing with final ginnings of 4,951,000 bales in 1924. Ginnings to Nov. 1 this year for the entire cotton belt are 11,198,660 bales, by far the largest ever reported to that date. The increase in two weeks has been 1,678,876 bales. On Nov. 1 1924 the ginnings amounted to 9,715,643 bales, an increase covering the period of two weeks in that year of 2,099,662 bales. The difference shown in these figures reflects the earlier movement of the crop this year. To Nov. 1 1924 the percentage of the total crop of that year ginned to that date was 71%; the ratio to that date this year is 73%,taking the Government estimate issued this week as the basis of the calculation. On the same basis the ratio for Texas this year to Nov. 1 is slightly under 70% ginned—a year ago it was slightly below 77%. Another corn crop in excess of three billion bushels is now the estimate of the Department of Agriculture at Washington, in its complete official report on the cereal crops issued on Tuesday of this week. The actual production is now placed at 3,013,390,000 bushels, which is 95,554,000 bushels more than was indicated by the Department a month ago, and contrasts with only 2,436,513,000 bushels, last year's short yield, and 3,046,387,000 bushels raised in 1923. There have been six three-billion-bushel corn crops raised in the United States, including the crop of this year. The largest ever raised was in 1920, which was 3,208,584,000 bushels. Last year's corn crop was a poor one, both in quantity and quality, the yield per acre being considerably reduced, a loss of one-fifth appearing in the total production, in contrast with 1923, as the above figures testify, while the quality was low and fully 20 points under the five-year average. This year's yield compares closely with 1923. Of the half dozen leading States in the corn belt, only one, Nebraska, shows a loss in pro- Nov. 14 1925.] THE CHRONICLE duction this year in contrast with the large harvest of 1923. Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and Ohio (which with Nebraska constitute the six largest growers of corn) all record large gains this year. These five States (omitting Nebiaska) will raise nearly 49% of the total corn crop the present year; in 1923 their proportion was 43%. The increase in the production of corn for these five States over 1923 is 11.8%. Nebraska reports a loss of 50,000,000 bushels this year as compared with 1923, and Nebraska in both years was the third State as to the quantity of corn harvested. The Southwest also reports a heavy loss in production this year. The 1925 yield for Texas will be only 31,648,000 bushels, as against 96,440,000 bushels in 1923, and a five-year average, 1918-22, of 125,928,000 bushels. Production in Oklahoma is 21,600,000 bushels this year in contrast with 37,536,000 bushels in 1923 and a five-year average of 59,880,000 bushels. The average yield per acre for 1925 for the entire corn belt is 28.3 bushels; in 1923 it was 29.2, while for Texas the yield per acre this year was only 8.0 bushels, in contrast with 18.5 in 1923. The quality of this year's corn crop is placed at 83.6%, against 79.4% in 1923, but the quality of the crop raised in Texas this year is placed at only 56%, against 78% in 1923. The stock of old corn on farms Nov. 1 1925 is estimated at 60,952,000 bushels, or 2.5% of the 1924 crop, which, as noted above, was considerably reduced in quantity and of low grade; on Nov. 1 1924 the carryover from the 1923 crop was 101,934,000 bushels, or 3.3% of the crop of 1923. The Government report issued on Tuesday also tells of a slight betterment as to the yield of white potatoes, the 1925 crop of which is now estimated at 346,503,000 bushels. This is much below the production of recent years. Since 1911 there have been only three years in which a smaller quantity was raised. Last year the crop was a bumper crop at 454,784,000 bushels. The yield per acre this year is given as 100.3 bushels, whereas in 1924 it was 124.2 bushels. The 1925 production of tobacco is estimated at 1,264,226,000 pounds, which is considerably in excess of earlier estimates and contrasts with 1,240,513,000 pounds in 1924. For practically all of the other cereal crops the earlier estimates stand. The total wheat crop is 697,272,000 bushels, an average yield per acre of 12.9 bushels, whereas last year it was 16.1 bushels, the latter being somewhat above the average. The quality of the wheat crop is 89.0%, against 93.1% in 1924. Oats and barley show practically the same quality in both years, at 91.7% for the former and 88.2% for the latter. Rye, which shows a loss of over 20% in production this year, is also of poorer quality, the figures being 86.5% for 1925 and 93.0% for 1924. When the French Cabinet, headed by Paul Painleve, resigned in a body recently in order to get rid of Joseph Caillaux as Finance Minister, according to Paris cable advices at the time, Premier Painleve also assumed the duties of Finance Minister in his reconstructed Cabinet. Apparently he took this step, not because he felt that he, better than anyone else, could solve the troublesome financial problems, but because he did not know where to find a competent man who would be accepted by Parliament. He must have known before he took over the Finance portfolio that he Would be beset by formidable obstacles on all sides. If he did not realize this fact 2317 at the outset, only a short time was necessary for him to do so. Cabling on Nov. 6, the Paris representative of the New York \"Times\" gave a vivid word picture of the many-sided predicament in which the Premier was placed. In part he said: \"With the franc facing a new crisis, the attention of the French capital has been turned almost exclusively to the domestic financial situation. Unfortunately, the political situation is such as to oppose a formidable barrier to any rapid betterment of the situation through action by the Government and Parliament. The Government is weak, miserably weak. Its weakness grows largely out of the financial situation. It is unstable because on the Left it must contend with the demand of the Socialists for a capital levy, and on the Right with the stern opposition of the conservative Senate to this measure. The financial plans of M. Painleve are wung this way and that by these two currents. He knows full well that the business leaders of the country much prefer other tax burdens to a levy on acquired wealth. Also he knows that without some form of this Socialist panacea his tenure of office will be short. This situation explains why, when the Premier, who is also Finance Minister, went before the Chamber Finance Commission this afternoon with the financial measures to be introduced to-morrow he left the politicians puzzled. They saw the Premier's projects were sure to meet criticism from both sides.\" He outlined his plan to the Commission on Nov. 6, but it did not become available until the next day. The Paris representative of the New York \"Times\" summarizing the plan and commenting upon it, said: \"If the finance bill introduced by the French Government to-day becomes law there will no longer be any foundation for the charge that Frenchmen do not pay taxes. It is the most complete effort at taxation ever made in this country, or probably in any other. It taxes everything. It taxes land with houses. It taxes land without houses. It taxes the millionaire's revenue from gilt-edged investments and it taxes the clerk's salary. It taxes stocks, it taxes bonds, it taxes ancient furniture, it taxes kitchen utensils, it taxes diamonds, and it taxes pearls, and pictures, and tapestries, and books. It taxes everything people have. If it passes it will make the name of Painleve as famous in French contemporary history as the name of Volsted is across the Atlantic. As Premier Painleve says in his introduction to the bill, a special sacrifice is demanded of the country. His bill shows how he would collect a sacrifice of 80,000,000,000 francs over fourteen years. He expects it to yield 5,955,000,000 a year, and this sum, plus a sum of 2,630,000,000 from the budget, is to feed a sinking fund for the retirement of the French domestic debt. He calculates that in fourteen years his plan will reduce the French public debt of 300,000,000,000 francs down to a stable debt by the elimination of the floating debt and short-term securities. But for the moment, the way M.Painleve plans to get the money has more interest than what will be done with it. What effect it will have on all securities is awaited with great anxiety.\" The Premier that evening issued a statement in explanation of his plan. He said: \"The State will live up to all its obligations and its faithfulness to its given word is an essential guarantee of its credit and currency. Holders of national defense bonds 2318 THE CHRONICLE need not be afraid of there being any conversion. It is by taxation alone that complete balancing of the budget will be accomplished. All expenditures will be included in it and severely controlled. Moreover, we intend to begin progressive redemption of the public debt, chiefly lightening and regulating the floating debt, which endangers our money. It will be done by organizing an autonomous sinking fund absolutely independent of the State and master of its resources. The exceptional national levy will be imposed without brutality or vexations to any one, according to the wealth of each citizen, who may pay immediately, in three payments or in fourteen years, as he prefers. Thus we will close the era of makeshifts,loan and inflation, and a period of equilibrium permitting the stabilization of money will begin. We must first, however, clear up the difficulties of the past. Assuredly important results have been obtained in 1925, as the State has not only consolidated 6,000,000,000 francs' worth of national defense bonds, but the Treasury has also retired 5,000,000,000 short-term bonds. These efforts, nevertheless, leave the Treasury at the end of the year facing a 2,500,000,000 franc deficit, which it will ask from the Bank of France as a provisional loan until the tax payments are received—delayed by tardy adoption of the budget. This in general lines is the plan for financial improvement we are undertaking with courage and which we ask all citizens to help in. The situation would not become serious unless the country or men in power lacked will. As long as we remain in the Government our will, I assure you, will not fail.\" The New York \"Times\" representative added that \"while M. Painleve was making this statement, a giant meeting, with an overflow audience in another hall, was being held by the Landlords' Association of France. Violent protests were made against the proposed laws on property, renting, real estate, etc. After voting numerous resolutions the meetings broke up and the landlords paraded with the intention of protesting in front of the Finance Ministry. Heavy police forces succeeded in dispersing the crowd before it reached its destination.\" The measures were approved by the Cabinet on Nov. 7. Still the outlook for approval by the Chamber of Deputies was by no means encouraging. On the evening of Nov.8 the Paris representative of the New York \"Times\" cabled that \"the cloud of a new Government crisis spread across the French horizon to-day before the shadows of the last one had disappeared, which is to say that Premier Painleve will probably fall in the coming week on the new tax project which he introduced yesterday.\" He added that \"this afternoon the Premier told newspaper men he had decided to raise the question of confidence in an immediate vote on the new revenue bill, which was equivalent to saying that if it was not voted quickly he would quit office. An hour and a half later the Finance Commission,of the Chamber, by a vote of 17 to 14, withheld approval of the new bill, declared itself opposed to all inflation involved in the Painleve project, and invited the Government to shape its financial policy on the program which had been approved by the leaders of the Left majority; namely, a levy on capital.\" Continuing, he said: \"Immediately after learning of this vote M. Painleve let it be known that he nevertheless would bring his bill before the Chamber to-morrow and demand that [vim 121. that body put itself on record. Friends of the Government pointed out that only thirty-one Deputies voted in the Finance Commission, whereas there are sixty members. The fact is many of the Right members were absent. - But what a weak reed for a Premier of the Left to lean upon!\" Further outlining the general political situation and the special predicament of Premier Painleve, he said: \"Aside from the unfavorable vote of the Finance Commission, which plainly indicates that all the Left members did not vote for the Painleve project, inquiries in political circles of varyirg colors and perusal of the newspapers of all parties show an exceptional lack of approbation. The main difficulty from the political point of view lies in the circumstance that if M. Painleve changes his project to meet the demand of the Left bloc leaders he has not the slightest chance of getting it through the Senate. If the Government's project is such as to suit the Senate the Socialists will quit him and leave him in a minority in the Chamber. What the Left leaders want is a Socialist project which has the approval of the Radical Socialists. This project, known as the Blum plan, after the leader of the Unified Socialists, calls for a 10% mortgage on all real wealth in France, payable in fourteen years. Figuring the real wealth of France at 1,500,000,000,000, its authors hold this will put the Government in possession of mortgages worth 150,000,000,000. This measure, of course, is opposed by most of the big business interests in France, because of the difficult burden it would place on going business concerns. Politically, it is rather difficult to see just what the Socialists are driving at in insisting on it at this time, for it is certain the Senate will not approve it. It may be that they wish to force a new election under the present electoral laws, believing they can get the approval of a majority of those who vote.\" In his account of the situation the next day the \"Times\" correspondent said: \"Almost as many solutions of France's financial difficulties as there are parties in French politics are being offered today for trial. In some parties there are indeed almost as many plans as there are members. First, there is the Government plan for the redemption of the floating debt at the rate of 6,000,000,000 francs a year through the agency of a sinking fund fed from special taxation of all forms of property over fourteen years. Next there is the Blum-Auriol proposal for a 10% capital levy. Third, there is M. Loucheur's proposal for a ten-year moratorium on shortterm bonds and reduction of interest on all bonds to 3%. Fourth, there is M. Bonnefous's proposal for a lottery loan. Fifth, there remains in the background M. Caillaux's proposal, which resembles largely that of the present Government except for greater moderation in trying to wring golden eggs out of the goose. Beyond these is a host of others with many variants. But for the moment the situation sums itself this way: That the Socialists are trying by every means to graft their proposal for a capital levy into that of the Government.\" The Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies took action again on Nov. 10 on the proposed capital levy, \"described as a 15% tax on securities,\" and defeated the proposal. It was explained in an Associated Press dispatch from Paris that evening that \"the failure of M.Painleve to include real estate and landed property, confining the levy to securities Nov.14 1925.] THE CHRONICLE alone, arrayed the Deputies representing towns and cities against him.\" In outlining what had happened that day the Paris representative of the New York \"Times\" said: \"At the end of a day marked by developments which gave the Premier far more reason to resign than he had two weeks ago when he and the Cabinet quit to get rid of M. Caillaux, President Doumergue intervened and advised M. Painleve to c ease bickering with the Finance Committee, where the Socialistt: hold the balance as they do in the Chamber, and to go before Parliament so that if he fell responsibility would fall squarely on the Socialists.\" It.was added that \"M. Painleve agreed and Al hen Deputy Malvy, head of the Finance Committee, called on M. Painleve to-night and asked him %ince inc re to change his plans and get nearer to the Socialisi demands the Premier gave him a curt refusal and asked to deliver to his colleagues this messbge: 'I will i.ot run. I will fall on the field of battle.'\" According to a special Paris dispatch to the New York \"Herald Tribune\" the same evening, \"France's parliamentary deadlock over the formula for rehabilitating the nation's finances reached such an acute stage late to-day that Premier Painleve appealed to President Doumergue to summon a Cabinet meeting at the Elysee Palace to decide the Government's next move. This meeting, under the chairmanship of the President, ended early to-night with the decision that Painleve will appear before the Chamber of Deputies on Thursday and if necessary defy that body to throw the Ministry out of office and assume full responsibility for the failure to agree on any formula by which the country may regain its financial balance.\" It was noted also that \"the Chamber adjourned this evening until Thursday on account of the Armistice anniversary to-morrow.\" In the interval no time wag lost in conferences in efforts to so modify the finance bill that there might be a strong probability of its being accepted both in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. That real progress apparently was made was indicated in the following excerpt from a special Paris dispatch to the New York \"Times\" under date of Nov. 11:\"When at 2 o'clock this morning Louis Malvy, President of the Chamber Finance Commission, wakened Premier Painleve to announce to him that Left groups had once more agreed on what they thought should be the financial program of the Government, the Premier, delighted to find that there was peace within the camp of his followers, declared at once that he was perfectly willing to redraft his finance bill to meet their united views.\" It was added that \"this historic interview, which remade the Left bloc and may have most important consequences for France, took place while the Premier lay in bed. M. Malvy went back to his friends to inform them that all was 'well and that the Government would re-draft its much-disputed bill. Thus when day broke on the anniversary of the armistice, all was peace.\". The terms said to have been agreed upon were outlined as follows: \"What the bloc agreed on in the midnight hours was largely what M. Painleve had hitherto declared he would not accept. It was largely what Leon Blum and Vincent Auriol had been trying by every means during the past five days to graft onto the Government measure. To-day was spent in trying to remake the Government bill 2319 to meet those conditions. They are five in number, and to-morrow at 11 o'clock, if there is no further change in this kaleidoscopic situation, they will be presented in the form of a bill to the Finance Commission. The first condition is that there be no inflation. M. Painleve has insisted that there is imperative need for at least 2,500,000,000 francs in new money to meet next month's maturities. But Leon Blum and his associates have found a way to meet in part this 2,500,000,000 and yet avoid calling it new inflation. They estimate that 1,500,000,000 in bank notes has been lost or destroyed and new bank notes for this amount can be issued to make up the loss without raising the legal limit of circulation. Their second condition is for consolidation of the three, six and ten-year Treasury bonds, except those due this year. M. Painleve has refused so far to have anything to do with consolidation of short-term bonds and this consolidation will not affect the defense bonds. The third and fourth conditions are application of the doctrine of a capital levy by which the State will take a share in real estate more than 150,000 francs value, and a 15% beneficiary part in all industrial and commercial concerns in payment of the debt redemption lexy or tax. This very radical proposal is the one which M. Caillaux denounced when, on the eve of his resignation, he protested that mortgage banks acting for a large Paris concern were advocates of just such a measure for their own ultimate profit, they acting as agents for the Government in the conversion.\" Late Thursday evening the Paris representative of the New York \"Herald Tribune\" cabled that, \"by working uninterruptedly for twenty-four hours, Premier Painleve was able to draw up a new finance measure which he presented to-day. It is a compromise with the Socialists and for this reason has a chance of passage in the Chamber of Deputies. The feature of the amended bill is a 15% mortgage in favor of the State on the commerce, industry and estates of the nation, but it does not involve actual State participation in national business, which was the suggestion of the Socialists.\" The negotiations with respect to a settlement Of Italy's war debt have resulted in an agreement being reached by the Italian and American commissions. This happened on Thursday, Nov. 12. Apparently it came about largely because before it left Rome the Italian Commission was instructed to reach a settlement, and because the American Commission was particularly generous in the terms that it stipulated. Thursday afternoon at 4 o'clock a statement was issued setting forth the terms, which were closely in keeping with the forecasts. In a special Washington dispatch to the New York \"Times\" Thursday evening the results were outlined in part as follows: \"An agreement for the funding of Italy's war-time debt to the United States was reached to-day by the Italian and American Debt Commissions, under which Italy would pay a total of $2,407,000,000 over a period of sixtytwo years. The terms are considerably more lenient than those granted to any other debtor nation up to this time and, roughly calculated, represent repayment of the original principal amount of $1,648,000,000 and $759,000,000 in interest, accrued and future.

To-day a flood of congratulatory messages began to arrive. Among the first were those of the King, Queen, Crown Prince, Queen Mother and all of the members of the royal family. Then followed a stream of telegrams from all parts of the world. They were so numerous that to-day they were being taken to Signor Mussolini's office in sacks.\" For some time foreign newspaper correspondents stationed in Rome have complained of a severe censorship by the Mussolini Government. It will be recalled that because of this situation a considerable number of them declined to be present at the interview granted by Mussolini at the Locarno Conference. It would seem that just recently the censorship has been still more severe. Under date of Nov. 11 the London correspondent of the New York \"Times\" cabled that \"a state of great nervous tension now exists in Italy, according to trustworthy private information reaching here, due particularly to the severe censorship being applied by the Mussolini Government.\" It was added that \"this severity is due partly to the fact that some Fascist newspapers went so far as to attribute the recent preparations for an attempt on Premier Mussolini's life to 'the obscure machinations of the agents of a neighboring power.' The Italian press, it is declared, is not permitted to mention such events as the destruction in Triests of the office of the Slav paper 'Edinost,' which aroused great excitement in Jugoslavia, nor the recent disorders at Brescia and Parma, during which the offices of prominent Freemasons were destroyed and individuals beaten.\" Official announcement that a settlement had been reached was made Thursday, Nov. 12, after \"a conference by members of the American Debt Commission and President Coolidge and a later meeting between the Italian mission and Americans.\" According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington that afternoon,\"although he declined to disclose details, Count Volpi, Italian Finance Minister and head of the Italian Commission, expressed gratification over the liberality of the terms accorded to Italy. He said the concessions made were far in excess of any published forecast he had seen. 'The United States has been very generous,' said another member of the Italian delegation.\" It was added that \"arrangements were made for the actual signing of the compact next Saturday [to-day]. A few details of the text are yet to be worked out.\" Premier Mussolini was quoted in an Associated Press dispatch from Rome Thursday afternoon, upon being told that an agreement had been reached, as saying that \"I hope it is true, because it will mean great things for both countries.\" An official statement According to a special wireless message from was issued in Washington at 4 o'clock Thursday af- Rome to the New York \"Evening Post\" last evening, ternoon setting forth the terms, as given in earlier \"it is announced that the Chamber of Deputies will paragraphs. be convoked Wednesday—a month 'ahead of time— in order to rush through legislation which will conThe attempt upon the life of Premier Mussolini of solidate the Fascist Government's position and enItaly near the close of last week was only the begin- able the Cabinet to deal summarily with the Italians ning of a far-reaching plot, according to a special implicated in last week's attempt to overthrow the wireless message from Rome to the New York present regime.

The same spirit was in eviflags appeared at almost every window, while bands dence at the annual Guildhall dinner of the Lord 2322 CHRONICLE Mayor in London on the evening of Nov. 9. In briefly describing the event the New York \"Times\" representative at that centre said: \"Prophecies of future peace and happiness as a result of the Locarno treaties which, if they come true, will bring to Europe a new golden age, were made by Premier Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain at the Guildhall banquet which was held to-night with all the brilliant pomp and pageantry which have made it one of the most splendid traditions of London life. A distinguished audience, including the American Ambassador, representatives of other nations and prominent British notables, was electrified and aroused to enthusiasm when Mr. Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary of the Empire, but a few years ago at deadly grips with Germany, drank from a huge loving cup and then handed it with a gesture of frankest friendliness and courtesy to the German Ambassador, who then turned to him and pledged him.\" He added that \"both men seemed profoundly touched by the incident, to which Mr. Chamberlain made a handsome allusion in his speech, his first public statement since his return to London from Locarno. It was Chamberlain's night. His speech easily took first honors of the evening. At its close the venerable Guildhall walls resounded to the roars of sincere and heartfelt approval.\" The New York \"Herald Tribune\" representative gave more significant details in his account of the dinner. He said that \"for the first time since 1913 the German Ambassador was present to-night at the City of London's historic ceremony—the Lord Mayor's annual banquet at Guildhall. The presence of Dr. Sthamer was tangible evidence that the spirit of Locarno is abroad in the land, and Austen Chamberlain, hero of that conference, made a happy reference to it in his speech. 'Through the hospitality of the Lord Mayor to-night I am able to drink from the loving cup with the German Ambassador,' said the British Foreign Secretary. 'What I have done to-night the representatives of other nations may do to-morrow.' Dr. Sthamer was received with cheers when he took his seat near the middle of the banquet table between Merry del Val, Spanish Ambassador and dean of the diplomatic corps here, and Mr. Chamberlain. The Foreign Secretary in his address sounded a note of warning to the German Nationalists who appear to be trying to sabotage the work of Locarno. 'No statesman dare take the responsibility for dashing from our lips the cup of hope of Locarno,' he declared,'and no nation dare face the load of obloquy which will rest on any nation which will deny to the world its great need and its deepest and most profound hope.' Mr. Chamberlain declared it was not the written treaties of Locarno which the world cared about, but the spirit of Locarno, and in this connection he expressed the belief that Locarno was the beginning and not the end. The Foreign Minister said he hoped that the same good-will which prevailed at Locarno might exist in the Far East, where representatives of the world Powers and China are wrestling with the question of Chinese customs.\" It became known here on Wednesday, through London cable advices, that \"the signing of the Locarno Treaty in London next month,it is stated, will be marked by a series of functions probably without precedent in the history of this city. Chief among [VoL. 121. them will be a great banquet given by the King and Queen at Buckingham Palace to the statesmen of the foreign Powers who come to London to sign the treaty, and to the British Ministers who sign the treaty in behalf of this country. It will be one of the most magnificent functions ever held in London, and it will be followed by a brilliant reception, to which will be bidden the diplomatic corps, Cabinet Ministers, political leaders and great public figures in all walks of life.\" According to cable advices from the same centre the next day \"preparations for the signing of the agreement in London Dec. 1 are well advanced. It is understood the British Government already has sent invitations to the statesmen and officials who took part in the negotiations at Locarno, and also to their wives. The occasion of the signing of the treaties is to be made as imposing as possible.\" It was added that \"Commons reassembles Monday after its vacation, and Wednesday's session is to be devoted to debate on the Locarno pact preparatory to its ratification. All the leaders in the House are expected to participate.\" In spite of the attitude of the German Nationalists toward the Locarno treaties and the resignation Of their three representatives from the Cabinet, the political situation and outlook in Germany appeared considerably more reassuring than in France. In a special wireless message to the New York \"Times\" on Nov. 6 the situation was outlined in part as follows: \"The Chancellor and his colleagues confidently expect that the logical consequences which the Allies are pledged to bring about in the occupied Rhineland will become visible and tangible by the middle of this month and that, therefore, the German plenipotentiaries will be enabled to sign the draft treaties at London in the beginning of December. Meanwhile, in the last week of November, the treaties will be submitted to the Reichstag which, however, will take no definite action on them until after the signing. The question of reorganizing the Cabinet is left incomplete. The retirement of the Nationalist Ministers will not be dealt with until after the fulfillment of the Locarno promises— which means virtually simultaneously with the reassembling of the Reichstag.\" That further progress in the same direction had been made was indicated in the following excerpt from a special wireless dispatch to the New York \"Times\" on Nov. 10: \"The German Government's program for a campaign to force the Locarno Treaty acceptance through the Reichstag despite the radical Right opposition was tentatively completed this morning following a visit of Reichstag President Loebe to President Hindenburg, whom he told that everything is in readiness for the fray and the date of the Reichstag opening practically fixed for Nov. 23. The Reichstag President, who expressed confidence over the outlook, outlined the program which constitutes the first clearing of the situation since the radical Nationalist members left the Cabinet two weeks ago.\" Still another favorable announcement was that Germany had handed her reply to the Conference of Ambassadors on disarmament. This word was received in an Associated Press dispatch from Paris under date of Nov. 11. It stated that \"Germany's reply to the Conference of Ambassadors on the subject of disarmament was handed to Foreign Minister Nov.14 1925.] THE CHRONICLE Briand by Ambassador von Hoesch this evening. It is understood that the document shows a real disposition on the part of Germany to achieve genuine disarmament and an earnest effort to fall into the spirit of the Locarno agreements.\" The dispatch also said that \"it is felt in Paris that the note gives the Ambassadors' Conference satisfactory assurances that the provisions of the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles have been fulfilled, and it is expected that the evacuation of the Cologne area will be ordered beginning Dec. 1.\" The correspondent further stated that \"the main features of the German note are assurances that the following measures are being or will be carried out: Curtailment of the authority of General von Seeckt as Commander of the Reichswehr. Suppression of military training in athletic organizations. Demilitarization of police effectives above the maximum of 150,000 men. Confiscation of all weapons declared illegal by the Versailles Treaty and the destruction of twenty-two heavy pieces of artillery.\" Announcement was made in Berlin on Nov.12 that \"- the Senior Council or Steering Committee to the Reichstag met this afternoon and fixed Nov. 20 as the date for the reopening of Parliament. The Locarno treaties, however, will be laid before the Deputies, presumably to the accompaniment of a Governmental declaration delivered either by the Chancellor or Foreign Minister Stresemann only three days later, which was the date foreseen by Herr Loebe, Reichstag President, on his arrival here from America.\" It was added that \"it is probable that after the usual speeches by party leaders the treaties will be turned over to the Foreign Relations Committee to be brought before the full house again after the German plenipotentiaries return from the signing ceremony at London the first days of December.\" While at the outset a week ago cable dispatches from Damascus told of a rapid return to normal in the business section of the city, following the uprising of the Arabs the week before, it became increasingly evident as the week progressed that fresh trouble had broken out near the city, if not in it. In an Associated Press dispatch from Damascus on Nov. 6 it was stated that \"the Arabs, represented as conducting a holy war, are reported to have thrown in their lot with the Jebel Druse tribesmen, the combined forces showing determination to wage bitter warfare against France as the mandatory country.\" The situation was further outlined as follows: .\"From unofficial advices the tribesmen appear to be in control of a great part of the territory north of Damascus, it being stated that all of the Homo district, bout 80 miles to the north of Damascus, is in their hands. Damascus, sorely tried in mid-October by the fighting between the French and natives, according to one authoritative account, is closely surrounded and the target, at times, for the fire of the Druses. The city is without railway and telegraphic communication with the outside world, and those who are able to make their way are seeking shelter in Jerusalem to the south, and at Alexandretta and Aleppo to the north. The French, under General Gamelin, have refrained from spectacular reprisals, and the opinion in Paris seems to be that the problem will be solved momentarily under the rules of civilized warfare with a verdict eventually 2323 by the League of Nations. In Damascus, street traffic is at a standstill, the shops are closed and the inhabitants are fleeing.\" Evidently the French Government decided that by allowing Syria greater freedom of action the trouble being experienced in that country would be at least lessened. This idea was clearly set forth in a special Paris cablegram to the New York \"Times\" under date of Nov. 7. It was claimed that\"as soon as order is re-established in Syria a larger measure of autonomy will be granted to the native peoples under the League of Nations mandate, Foreign Minister Briand announced to-day to the Cabinet Council meeting. A measure has been prepared by a parliamentary commission presided over by Deputy Paul Boncour, which during the recent month has been studying the situation and drafting conditions under which the mandate can best be administered in harmony with the needs of the native populations and so as to provide the largest possible measure of autonomy. One of the difficulties is the great number of races and interests in Syria which make continuance of a central disinterested .authority essential. In M. Briand's view the mandatory power should be more largely advisory than executive and his choice of Senator Henry de Jouvenel as High Commissioner has been made with this object. This appointment was definitely confirmed by the Cabinet, and M. de Jouvenel will, it is understood, leave very shortly to take up his duties. His task will be to pacify the various peoples and religious organizations whose grievances have developed the present unrest. These are partly religious and partly personal, especially in the case of the Jebel Druses, whose revolt was largely due to friction between some members of the Attrach family and the French resident. The new High Commissioner intends to hold open court as soon as he reaches Damascus for hearing the views of all the people, to which the statutes proposed by the French Government will be as far as possible accorded.\" In a special Geneva cable message to the New York \"Times\" on Nov. 10 it was stated that \"the alleged desire of the French Government to establish a kingdom.in Syria in no manner conflicts with the terms of the League of Nations mandate under which France is responsible for the Government of the country, League officials told the New York 'Times' correspondent to-day. Meantime, though the League is not opposed to the reported arrangement, the French Government has not informed Geneva of such an intention as yet. In fact, the Secretariat of the League is still uninformed of the .selection of Senator de Jouvenel as High Commissioner in Syria, notice not being essential under terms of mandates.\" The following day word came from Damascus that \"the situation at Damascus remains essentially unchanged, especially outside the city, which is calm. French troops are now engaged in keeping bandits at a respectful distance. Strong detachments are stationed at the principal entrances, among them Medan, where the Foreign Legion, wherein, curiously, there is a large proportion of Germans, is placed.\" In a special cable dispatch from Berlin to the New York \"Herald Tribune\" on Nov. 8 it was stated that \"the arrival of the two American destroyers here yesterday created an unfavorable impres- 2324 THE CHRONICLE sion on the French authorities in Syria, as showing want of confidence by the United States Government in the French administration. As soon as the warships arrived, however, the commanding officer came ashore and, with the American Consul, called officially on General Sarrail and the Governor of Lebanon, both of whom returned the call aboard the vessels in the afternoon.\" The correspondent explained that, \"in justification of the American warships for the protection of the interests of United States citizens, it may be pointed out that the feature of the situation is the fact that the country is largely in the hands of rebel bands and there are not sufficient French troops to oppose them. Reinforcements are the essential factor for improving the situation and large numbers are necessary. Although cavalry and infantry reinforcements are beginning to arrive here, no substantial increase in the French forces may be expected for some weeks.\" So far as can be learned, official bank rates at leading European centres have not been changed from 9% in Berlin; 7% in Italy; 6/ 1 2% in Belgium; 6% in Paris; 5/ 1 2% in Denmark; 5% in Madrid and Norway;41/ 2% in Sweden;4% in London and 3/ 1 2% in Holland and Switzerland. Open market discount rates in London continue to advance and finished at 37 /8@315-16% for short bills, against 37 / 8% last week, and at3 15-16% for three months' bills, against 37 / 8% a week earlier. Money on call at the British centre, on the other hand, has been somewhat easier, 4%,in comparison with 37 and closed at 31/ / 8% a week ago. In Paris the open market discount rate remains at 4/ 1 2% and in Switzerland at 21/ 8%,the same as the previous week. The Bank of England's statement for the week ending Nov. 11 was again featured by a material contraction in gold, amounting to £988,787, while an increase in note circulation of £76,000 combined to bring about a decline in reserve of £1,065,000. Moreover, the proportion of reserve to liabilities fell sharply, and is now 21.48%, as compared with 22.79% last week and 23.79% for the week of October 28. In 1924 the ratio stood at 21% and a year earlier at 191/ 4. Important changes occurred in the deposit items. Public deposits declined £1,044,000, while \"other\" deposits expanded £3,399,000. An increase in loans on Government securities of £44,193,000 was shown. Loans on other securities, however, fell £726,000. The Bank's gold holdings now stand at £148,058,069, as against £128,494,253 last year (before the transfer to the Bank of England of the £27,000,000 formerly held by the Redemption Account of the Currency Note issue) and £127,686,026 in 1923. Reserve totals £26,289,000. A year ago it was £25,373,933 and the year before £23,231,871. Note circulation is £141,519,000, as compared with £122,870,320 in 1924 and £124,204,155 a year earlier. The loan total stands at £74,423,000, as against £72,821,486 and £71,469,488 one and two years ago, respectively. Notwithstanding repeated rumors to the contrary, no change was made in the minimum discount rate, which remains at 4%. Clearings through the London banks for the week were £794,216,000, as against £852,792,000 last week and £810,997,000 a year ago.

According to the statement of the Bank of France, this week, the gold item shows another small gain, namely, 15,625 francs. Total gold holdings now stand at 5,547,609,600 francs, against 5,544,560,526 francs at the corresponding date last year and 5,539,535,012 francs the year previous. Of the foregoing amounts 1,864,320,907 francs were held abroad in each of the years. Following the high record of .8,011,479,965 francs reached last week, a contraction of 329,773,000 francs occurred the present week in note circulation. Aggregate circulation is thus brought down to 47,681,706,050 francs, contrasting with 40,635,940,175 francs for the corresponding date last year and 37,439,366,595 francs for the year before. During the week silver gained 283,000 francs, advances rose 87,947,000 francs, Treasury deposits increased 28,866,000 francs and general deposits were augmented by 115,869,000 francs. On the other hand, the total of bills discounted was reduced 1,235,411,000 francs. Comparisons of the various items in this week's return with the statement of last week and with corresponding dates in both 1924 and 1923 are as follows: BANK OF FRANCE'S COMPARATIVE STATEMENT.

Gold holdings gained a nominal amount. In detail the figures show that note circulation was reduced 125,240,000 marks, at the same time that other maturing obligations expanded 80,280,000 marks and \"other liabilities\" increased 9,585,000 marks. As to assets, there was a loss of 155,780,000 marks in holdings of bills of exchange and.checks and of 12,412,000 marks in advances. Deposits held abroad declined 29,879,000 marks and silver and other coins 214,000 marks. Increases occurred of 15,171,000 marks in notes on other banks, 789,000 marks in investments and 104,293,000 marks in \"other assets.\" The Bank's stock of gold and bullion aggregates 1,206,897,000 marks, an increase for the week of 31,000 marks, and comparing with 694,288,000 marks a year ago, and 467,025,000 marks in 1923. Note circulation is now 2,677,644,000 marks. The above figures are in gold marks, or the equivalent of a trillion paper marks to each gold mark. Nov.14 1925.] THE CHRONICLE The Federal Reserve Bank statement, issued on Thursday afternoon, revealed small additions to gold holdings, heavy contraction in rediscounting operations and—for the System as a whole—a considerable gain in open market purchases. The figures for the banks as a group show an addition of $6,500,000 to gold reserves. Rediscounts of bills secured by Government obligations declined $54,000,000 and other bills $17,600,000, making a total decline in bills rediscounted of $71,600,000. Holdings of bills bought in the open market increased $10,200,000. In total bills and securities (earning assets) there was a contraction of $56,100,000, while deposits fell off $26,200,000. At New York a gain in gold of $3,700,000 was shown, while rediscounting of all classes of paper was reduced approximately $38,100,000. Open market purchases remained practically stationary. Total bills and securities were reduced $36,900,000 and deposits $3,400,000. The amount of Federal Reserve notes in actual circulation declined both locally and nationally—$7,100,000 in the case of the former, and $2,100,000 for the latter. Member bank reserve accounts also declined, $13,400,000 for the System and $1,300,000 at New York. As to the reserve ratios, the decrease in deposits, coupled with larger gold reserves, combined to bring about an advance of 0.8%, to 72.3%, for the entire System, and of 1.2%, to 82.4%, at the local institution. Last Saturday's statement of New York Clearing House banks and trust companies reflected strain, in showing that surplus was again completely wiped out and a deficit in reserve of more than $7,000,000 established, at the same time that loans and deposits were sharply lowered. In the item of loans, discounts, etc., a contraction of $24,662,000 was reported. Net demand deposits fell $59,785,000, to $4,516,092,000, which is exclusive of $18,999,000 of Government deposits. Time deposits decreased $1,494,000, to $550,078,000. Cash in own vaults of members of the Federal Reserve Bank increased $3,119,000, to $49,781,000, although this is not counted as reserve. Reserves of State banks and trust companies in own vaults gained $334,000, but reserves of these institutions kept in other depositories fell $183,000. A decline of $48,257,000 in the reserves of member banks at the Federal Reserve institution was 'responsible for a loss in surplus reserves of $40,210,420, notwithstanding the falling off in the deposits. The result was that besides the complete elimination of last week's excess reserve of $32,267,200, a deficiency in reserve of $7,943,220 was created. It should be noted that the figures here given for surplus are on the basis of legal reserves of 13% against demand deposits for member banks of the Federal Reserve System, but not including $49,781,000 cash in vault held by these member institutions on Saturday last. In spite of everything that might have been expected to make it advance, the trend of money at this centre was downward. Rates for demand loans were higher at the beginning of the week, following the deficit of $7,943,220 in reserves reported by the Clearing House banks last Saturday. Loans were said to have been called to the extent of $15,000,000 and call money touched 5%. Thereafter the trend was downward. On both Thursday and yesterday the only quotation was 41/ 2%. Brokers' loans must have been reduced somewhat temporarily by the 2325 heavy liquidation in stocks on Tuesday. But as the upward movement in them was resumed the very next day and continued during the rest of the week on a big scale, quite likely they are as high now as they were a week ago. Much was made in speculative circles for a single day of the advance in the rediscount rate of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank 2 to 4%, but as subsequent events showed, it from 31/ had no influence on the money market at this centre. Ample proof of business activity and prosperity was furnished by the continued million-car loadings, the increase in the unfilled orders of the United States Steel Corporation of 391,886 tons in October, the declaration of an extra cash dividend of $5 a share on General Motors common stock, the resumption of dividends on American Sugar Refining common at the rate of 5% a year, and the declaration of extra cash or stock dividends by various other corporations. The bond market was only moderately active. There are indications that several large European loans will be floated in the United States early next year. • Dealing with specific rates for money, call loans this week again ranged between 43/i and 5%, unchanged from the range of the previous week. Mon4% with 43 4% the day the high was 5%, the low 43 rate for renewals. On Tuesday the renewal basis was advanced to 5%, which was the high for the day, although before the close there was a decline to 432%. Easier conditions prevailed on Wednesday and call 0 the maximum 4%, with 437 funds renewed at 43 quotation. During the minimum the 432% and remainder of the week, that is, Thursday and Friday, only one rate was quoted, 43/2%, this being the high, the low and the ruling figure on both days. In time money the situation remains unchanged, with trading narrow and featureless. Offerings were adequate and the demand light. A range of 4%@, 5% was mentioned, but the trading rate at which practically all transactions were put through was 47 4% for all periods from sixty days to six months, as against 4%@5% a week ago. Commercial paper was in good demand but as the supply of high-grade names was small, business was restricted and the aggregate turnover moderate. Four to six months names of choice character continue to be quoted at 431@43/2% with the bulk of the business passing at the inside figure. New England mill paper and the shorter choice names continue to be dealt in at 414%. Names less well known require indicating that the market was slightly easier than last week, when 432@4%% was asked. Banks' and bankers' acceptances remain at the levels previously current. No increase in activity was noted and the volume of business transacted was small. Firmness in the call market was of course the chief influence in restricting trading in acceptances. For call loans against bankers' acceptances the posted rate of the American Acceptance Council is now 4%, against 43i% a week ago. The Acceptance Council makes the discount rate on prime bankers' acceptances eligible for purchase by the Federal Reserve banks 33A% bid and 33% asked 3 for bills running 30 days, 3 asked bid and 3/% for 60 days, 35A% bid and 332% asked for 90 days, 33 4% bid and 3/% asked for 120 days, and 33/% bid and 3% asked for 150 days; and 4% bid and 3%% asked for 180 days.

An easier trend developed on Tuesday and demand bills sold at 4 84 5-16 (one rate) all day, cable transfers at 4 84 11-16 and sixty days at 4 811-16. On Wednesday semi-holiday conditions prevailed abroad in observance of Armistice Day; yet trading here was fairly active and rates were fractionally up with the range 4 84 5-16@4 84% for 4 for cable transfers and demand, 4 84 11-16@,4 843 4 81 1-16@4 813/i for sixty days.

Cotton and grain for payment closed at 4 8414. There were no gold engagements reported during the week, either for export or import. A shipment of $625,000 in silver was made for India via the S. S. City of Dunedin. The Bank of England continues to sell and export gold, mainly to the Straits Settlements. Sterling exchange was if anything still duller present week and the market was a narrow, lifeless affair, with trading of small proportions and rate changes confined to % of a cent. At intervals a considerable volume of selling was reported in London but this did not have the usual depressing effect, locally, as the demand here was fully adequate to sustain prices. Offerings of commercial bills were still relatively light. However, indications of interest in sterling were not lacking and the attitude of large dealers was principally one of caution, few showing In Continental exchange interest continues to any inclination to take on new commitments. Fluctuations in rates, even of the most minute character, centre on the pyrotechnics in French francs, which received attention, in the hope of gaining some idea again moved erratically and sustained further heavy as to what sterling is likely to do during the next few losses in value as a result of almost continuous selling weeks.

Should the Locarno treaties be ratified, this will mean an important reduction in military expenses and consequent lessening of that harassed country's heavy financial burden. Furthermore, it is claimed that the Moroccan situation is clearing up rapidly; peace negotiations are said to be nearing completion. Italian lire were inactive and also tended downward, declining to 3.96, after having opened at 4.00. At the close 'a rally to 4.05 was brought about as a result of the success of the Italian debt negotiations. The advance was sentimental rather thah actual, however, and stress is laid on the fact that although the settlement should give Italy a basis for stabilizing her currency and pave the way for the placing of substantial credits in this market, lire have been supported artificially for quite some time and that as a result the market is in a decidedly topheavy position technically. Besides,Italy's somewhat chaotic political condition renders unlikely, it is thought any outburst of speculative buying on the strength of the settlement. Dealers have not as yet forgotten that announcement of the Belgian debt settlement was followed by a sharp decline in Antwerp francs, in place of an advance. Nevertheless, fairly good buying developed at intervals on the part of those who were impressed by the fact that the terms offered Italy by the American Commission are the most favorable accorded any of the Allies. In the other branches of the European exchange market there is very little to report. German and Austrian currencies remain motionless. Greek exchange continues heavy and hovered around 1.33, on light dealings. The minor Central European exchanges were neglected and practically unchanged. Polish zlotys again held 'steady at around 16.70, though closing at 16.50. This is believed to be the result of Government intervention. Although trade conditions are still unfavorable and confidence has been seriously strained as a result of the recent collapse in rates, indications are that Polish affairs are on the mend. Several reforms designed to cut down expenditures and bring about governmental economy have been introduced and it is stated that Finance Minister Grabsky is meeting with fair success in his attempts to restore stability and secure foreign credits. The London check rate on Paris finished at 119.15, as against 121.35 last week. In New York sight bills on the French centre closed at 4.033, against 4.05; cable transfersat 4.043,against 4.06;commercialsight bills at4.02%,against 4.04,and commercial sixty days 3 against 3.9932 a week ago. Final at 3.97%, quotations on Antwerp francs, which continue to be firmly held and affected only slightly by the weakness in exchange on Paris, were 4.523/i for checks and 4.533/i for cable transfers, as compared with 4.5332 anf 4.5432 the preceding week. Reichsmarks were quoted at 23.81 (one rate) for both checks and cable transfers, against 23.813/ 2 last week. Austrian kronen have not changed from 0.00141 / 8. Lire closed at 4.043/ for bankers' sight bills; at 4.053/ for cable transfers. A week ago the close was 3.943/i and 3.9532. Exchange on Czechoslovakia finished at 2.96 8 (unchanged); on Bucharest at 0.4732, against 0.46%; on Finland at 2.523/ 2, against 2.52%,and on Poland at 16.50, against 16.70. Greek drachmae closed at 1.32% for checks and at 1.333 for cable transfers, against 1.343/2 and 1.35 a week earlier. 2327 As to the neutral exchanges formerly so-called, trading was only moderately active and rate variations confined within relatively narrow limits. Dutch guilders and Swiss francs ruled within a point or two of the levels prevailing during recent weeks. The same is true of Swedish exchange. Danish and Norwegian currencies ruled quiet and steady at 24.84 and 20.28, respectively, until the latter part of the week, when weakness set in and there were declines to 24.51 for Copenhagen crowns and to 19.91 for Oslo. The weakness was ascribed to the decision of the Danish Government to maintain its exchange at a minimum of 90% of par, which works out at 24.12, as against the level recently current of 24.84. It is believed that the movement will prove successful since speculators have transferred their attention elsewhere. No corresponding reason could be found for the drop in Norwegian krone, and the explanation most generally credited was that it was in sympathy with that of Denmark. Before the close, however, most of the loss was regained. Spanish pesetas ruled dull and about steady at very close to 14.26. Bankers' sight on Amsterdam finished at 40.223, against40.24; cable transfers at40.243,against 40.26; commercial sight bills at 40.14, against 40.16, and commercial sixty days at 39.783',against 39.80last week. Swiss francs closed at 19.27 for bankers' sight bills and at 19.28 for cable transfers. This compares with 19.263 % and 19.273 % a week ago. Copenhagen checks finished at 24.70 for checks and at 24.74 for cable remittances, as against 24.82 and 24.86. Checks on Sweden closed at 26.71 and cable transfers at 26.75, against 26.713/2 and 26.75, while checks on Norway finished at 20.22 and cable transfers at 20.26, against 20.23 and 20.27 the previous week. Spanish pesetas closed at 14.26 for checks and at 14.28 for cable transfers, in comparison with 14.27 and 14.29 a week earlier. roamoN EXCHANGE RATES CERTIFIED BY FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS TO TREASURY UNDER TARIFF ACT OF 1022.

These large credit balances, however, reflect only a part of the Reserve Bank's operations with the Clearing House institutions, as only the iteGs payable in New York City are represented in the daily balances. The large voluGe of checks on institutions located outside of New York are not accounted for in arriving at these balances, as such checks do not pass through the Clearing House but are deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank for collection for the account of the local Clearing House banks.

The announcement that the American and Italian commissions which have been in conference at Washington have concluded an arrangement for the fund. ing of the Italian war debt to this country marks another step in the disposition of a question whose financial and political bearings are almost equally [VoL 121. important. Financially, the question is important not merely because of the interesting and difficult problems of taxation, exchange and trade which the payment of such large sums as the war debts involves, but also because, heavy as may be the financial burden which the debtor nation may be called upon to carry, the burden of annual taxation which protracted delay or large concessions imposes upon the American taxpayers is not lightly to be ignored. Politically, the question is important because neither the greatest exercise of patience nor the most scrupulous exercise of courtesy by the United States has prevented its insistence upon payment from being construed abroad as an act of ingratitude or downright impropriety. There is abundant evidence that many of the leading statesmen of Europe have from the first fully understood the attitude of the United States and have labored to meet it, but popular opinion, especially where party rivalry is acute, does not always follow the statesmen's lead. The secrecy with which it has been deemed proper to surround the negotiations at Washington has made it impossible to follow very closely the discussions as they have proceeded, and the reports that the negotiations were at one time on the point of breaking down, as appears to have been seriously threatened in the case of Belgium and as actually happened in the case of France, are perhaps to be taken with some grains of allowance. Apparently, however, Count Volpi, the accomplished and astute head of the Italian Commission, took a leaf out of the book of M. Caillaux's unhappy experience and used it to advantage. Instead of coming forward at the beginning, as M. Caillaux did, with a proposal of a definite sum which Italy'was prepared to pay, only to have it discovered presently that the figure was only a kind of trading proposition which later might be raised, Count Volpi appears to have devoted himself first of all to a more or less elaborate exposition of the economic and financial condition of Italy in its bearing upon Italy's capacity to pay. Only when the exposition had been completed and allowed to sink in did he, apparently, propose a settlement on a definite basis. Precisely what that basis was the public has not been told, but if apparently well-informed reports are to be credited, it comprised the payment of a total of about $2,100,000,000 at the rate of $30,000,000 a year for seventy years. As it turns out, the settlement which has been agreed upon, following the reported rejection of the Italian offer by the American War Debt Commission, does not differ very greatly in amount from the figure which Count Volpi is reported to have offered. The principal of the debt is $1,647,896,197. Adding accrued interest at 5%, the estimated amount of which is given as $490,674,654, brings the total debt to $2,138,643,851. In satisfaction of this claim Italy agrees to pay $2,042,000,000 over sixty-two years, plus interest, which will bring the total amount up to $2,407,000,000. The basis of the arrangement is stated to be the payment of the principal of the debt in full, plus such interest as Italy is able to pay. .The terms of payment are exceedingly lenient. For the first five years the annual payments have been fixed at $5,000,000, rising in the sixth year to $14,000,000 and in the fifty-fifth to $73,000,000, the maximum annual payment being $80,000,000. Moreover, no interest is to be paid for the first five years, the 8 of 1%, interest for the next ten years is to be only 1/ and the maximum interest, which is reached only in Nov. 14 1925.] THE CHRONICLE 2329 the fifty-fifth year, is only 2%. What Italy gains question of the debt of each debtor country, may is obvious.
