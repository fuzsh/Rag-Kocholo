        "text": "The general public, government regulators, and environmental organizations are increasingly demanding industries to reduce their environmental impacts and report progress. This in turn resulted in numerous requirements for reporting environmental data. Environmental assessments are a useful tool in gathering and documenting this data. The assessments also assist decision makers to quantify impacts of their activities and plan for appropriate mitigation measures. There are different types of environmental assessments, each having specific purpose(s) and addressing specific audience(s). This paper gives an overview of common environmental concerns associated with oil and gas industry and shares insights on types of environmental assessments that are widely used. It discusses general methodologies to define the scope, approach, measurement standards, and reporting. Potential challenges encountered in conducting these assessments in an international arena and under a wide variety of regulatory requirements are addressed. Practical approach in execution of these assessments is described here, and strategy in dealing with the challenges is presented.\n\nVarious biophysical and socio-economic impacts may be associated with unconventional oil and gas (UOG) extraction. A vulnerability map may assist governments during environmental assessments, spatial planning and the regulation of UOG extraction, as well as decision-making around UOG extraction in fragile areas. A regional interactive vulnerability map was developed for UOG extraction in South Africa. This map covers groundwater, surface water, vegetation, socio-economics and seismicity as mapping themes, based on impacts that may emanate from UOG extraction. The mapping themes were developed using a normative approach, where expert input during the identification and classification of vulnerability indicators may increase the acceptability of the resultant map. This article describes the development of the interactive vulnerability map for South Africa, where UOG extraction is not yet allowed and where regulations are still being developed to manage this activity. The importance an...\n\nAlthough the United States has been stimulating well production with hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”)1 since the 1940s [1], high-volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF) combined with horizontal drilling is a relatively recent [2, 3] development with potential to adversely impact human health [4], environment [5], and water resources [6], with uncertainty about impacts and gaps in the data on HVHF compared to conventional drilling techniques [7]. Part of protecting environmental and public health is identifying potential risks before licenses are issued and drilling operations proceed. To this end, two case studies, focusing on the environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedures of California and New York, are analyzed in this paper. Both states have histories of strong environmental protection law and policy [8–10] and legally require an EIA to be conducted before development of HVHF sites [11, 12], an outgrowth of the 1969 federal National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). New York Sta...\n\nBy Luna B. Leopold, Frank E. Clarke, Bruce B. Hanshaw, and James R. Balsley G E O L O G I C A L S U R V E Y C I R C U L A R 645 United States Department of the Interior ROGERS C. B. MORTON, Secretary Geological Survey V. E. McKelvey, Diredor Man cannot survive on this planet without utilizing its natural resources prudently. Every human action affects the world around us in some degree and the full effect is difficult to assess because of complex relations among living and nonliving things. Under the circumstances one can neither expect to restore the entire past nor preserve the entire present for future generations. However all can and should strive for proper balance between resource development and maintenance of pleasant surroundings. The Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the reports on environmental assessment that it requires are aimed at insuping such a balanced approach. To be effective we must provide a system for relating large numbers of actions and environmental factors and for placing value judgments on impacts which are difficult to quantify. At my request the Geological Survey has developed an information matrix system that is described and modeled in this Circular. It is published with the thought that it will serve as a useful guide for environmental impact reporting and as a systematic reference. Those who share with us the desire to retain or improve the quality of our environment will recognize that this report is a sincere but still preliminary effort to fill an interim need. We hope that suggestions from others will improve this framework.\n\nThis study focused on the potential impacts to biodiversity and ecosystem services that may occur in the event of hydraulic fracturing for shale gas materialising in the Nama-karoo biome in South Africa. Fracking has become a highly contested issue internationally and no less so in South Africa, where applications are being considered by the government to permit three international companies to proceed with shale gas extraction. With no domestic experience of fracking in South Africa a literature research of data emanating from the USA was conducted to evaluate the extraction process. Documented environmental impacts and effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services in the USA have been used to provide insight into potential influences in the Nama-karoo. A qualitative study method was applied to identify and evaluate existing biotic and abiotic systems within the biome. From the outset, hydraulic fracturing, will require that suitable infra-structure including roads and drill pads must be constructed that will necessitate habitat degradation and fragmentation with associated edge effects. The potential introduction of alien species, pollution of water resources and over utilisation of wildlife are also recognised as impacts that may affect prevailing biodiversity and existing ecosystems in the Nama-karoo. Despite continuing attempts to value products and services derived from ecosystems, commonly accepted means to quantify ecosystem services remain vague. Utilising the identified sources of environmental impacts that may be introduced to the Nama-karoo, four ecosystem services, namely; provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting services have been considered. Affected ecosystem services are not quantified or valued, however, suggestions are provided that will enable decision makers to appreciate the manner in which fracking may degrade existing ecosystem services to the detriment of current and future human well-being."
