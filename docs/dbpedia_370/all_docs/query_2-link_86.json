        "text": "Best Restaurants in Inglewood\n\nA delicious mix of local institutions and trendy trailblazers make up Inglewood’s restaurant scene. Visiting some of these restaurants is an experience unto itself, like the stunning gardens of Deane House or the brick-laden 1906 firehall which houses the Hose and Hound. The Blackfoot Truckstop Diner will transport you back to the 50’s (it opened in 1956) with servers in pink outfits, a model train running above the tables and a flapper pie covered by six-inches of meringue. Often considered one of the best burgers in the city, the Inglewood Drive-In boasts a constant line-up in the summer and is perfect for a picnic along the nearby Riverwalk.\n\nNewer additions to Inglewood’s food scene include Vegan Street, a main floor taco bar with an upstairs speak easy called The Attic Bar & Stage and Calgary’s first crowdfunded restaurant, Madison’s 1212, which serves up craft nachos, poke, and $1.50 mimosas on weekends. One of Inglewood’s hidden gems, Rain Dog Bar, is a specialty beer bar that surrounds you in old-world ambience, while offering up a seasonally changing menu.\n\nThings to do in Inglewood\n\nIn-between eating and shopping, a day spent in Inglewood must include a stroll along the Bow River, live music, and a stop at a free contemporary art gallery. The Esker Foundation makes art accessible to all and its rotating exhibits not only educate, but they also create dialogue. In the same building sits one of the anchors of Calgary’s Music Mile, Café Gravity. This upscale coffee and wine bar, along with 20 other diverse venues, make up the Music Mile which stretches from Inglewood into the East Village. Two of the most notable venues are The Blues Can and The Ironwood Stage & Grill. Both offer up live performances nightly in a setting that will make you think you have landed in Austin or Nashville.\n\nParks and pathways along the Bow River connect some of Calgary’s best green spaces including the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary and Harvie Passage. Since 1929, 270 species of birds have been recorded at the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary, an ecological safe haven for birds and other wildlife. Birding fans or anyone looking to slow down in nature will appreciate the walking trails snaking through the wilderness here. Where the Bow River bends and turns south, you will find a water-sport enthusiasts dream – Harvie Passage. In the summer, kayakers, surfers, paddleboarders and even swimmers can be seen playing in the purpose-built channels. Harvie Passage sits on the edge of Pearce Estates Park, which is the perfect summer reprieve, with walking trails, shallow inlets, and plenty of shady spaces for a relaxing picnic.\n\nBeloved by locals and visitors alike, The Inglewood Night Market is a free outdoor event hosted on select weekends throughout the year and features locally curated artisan vendors, food trucks, live music, beer gardens, and more.\n\nShops in Inglewood\n\nIf you like shopping local, then you will be in paradise strolling down Inglewood’s 9th Ave. Here, you can find a diverse collection of shops including Kent of Inglewood, Knifewear, Silk Road Spice Merchant, Switching Gear, Smithbilt Hats, and Moonstone Creation all within a few blocks. Bookworms can get blissfully lost in row after row of books at The Next Page or Fair’s Fair, while record fans can leaf through albums for hours at Recordland. Any green thumb (current or aspiring) will get wide-eyed the moment they walk into Plant and the same goes for stationary fanatics entering Recess.\n\nFashion is at home in Inglewood with fashion-forward stores like Kotn and Cody & Sioux. For fashion that is hard-working, visit Crown Outdoor & Tactical just off 9th Avenue and peruse their collection of war-time memorabilia. If you are looking for stylish secondhand clothes, check out Peacock Boutique, Man of Distinction, or Change is Good, where 100% of the profits go to the YYC Dream Centre.\n\nInglewood Breweries\n\nBrewing is in Inglewood’s DNA. Shortly after prohibition was lifted in western Canada in 1892, The Calgary Brewing & Malting Company was established in Inglewood. The area later became known as ‘Brewery Flats’. Today, Inglewood is home to four wildly different breweries with a few more just outside the neighbourhood.\n\nEvery craft beer-loving local has been to the industrial, chic home of Cold Garden and Ol’ Beautiful. Just steps from each other, these two breweries offer completely different vibes. Walking into Cold Garden feels like you have entered your best friend’s quirky living room, while Ol’ Beautiful offers a more refined, trendy atmosphere. Both serve ridiculously delicious beer.\n\nAlong 9th Avenue, you will find High Line Brewing which pairs gourmet hotdogs featuring names like ‘Desperado’, ‘Frank N. Furter’ and ‘Tokyo Drift’ with tasty beers and cocktails. Local favourites Eighty-Eight Brewing Co. and The Dandy Brewing Company are in neighbouring Ramsay, which borders the edge of Inglewood\n\nCalgary’s craft beer scene is booming with more than 40 breweries and plenty of fun ways to tour them."
