        "text": "Branford Town Clerk's office accepts land record documents to be submitted electronically (eRecording) - 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year!\n\neRecording increases service to all interested parties, improves information flow, and eliminates the packaging and delivery costs associated with recording paper documents. The ability to eRecord reduces delays, saves time, and reduces costs by eliminating the need for an express courier, or a trip to the Town Clerk's office to submit documents. We work in partnership with Cott Systems, our land records software solutions provider and the following eRecording vendors: Simplifile, CSC, Indecomm and ePN. (At this time, transactions requiring an OP-236 State Conveyance Tax Form cannot be accepted via eRecording.)"
