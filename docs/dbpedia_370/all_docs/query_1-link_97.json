My work benefited immeasurably from the funding support of the City University of New York (CUNYpsc Grant), the Marion and Jasper Whiting Memorial Founda-\n\ntion, the Faculty-Undergraduate Research Initiative (FURl) at N ortheastern University, and the Office of the Provost at N ortheastern University. Also at Northeastern, the former dean of arts and sciences James Stellar, and the former vice provost Patricia Maguire Meservey facilitated project funding and a valuable research leave, for which I am grateful. Stuart Liebman was similarly helpful at Queens College-CUNY. I am especially indebted to the National Endowment for the Humanities, which awarded me a research fellowship for this project in 2003-4. My sincere thanks to the staff at the libraries and archives where I conducted my core research: Snell Library at N ortheastern University, Boston University's Mugar Library (microfiche division), the New York Museum of Television and Radio (now the Paley Center for Media), The Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago, the Wisconsin State Historical Archives, the UCLA Film and TV Archive, the Library of American Broadcasting at the University of Maryland, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Museum of American History. I was also assisted by the librarians of the Boston Public Library, the Free Library of Philadelphia, and by those of the New York Public Library system at the library's main branch as well as at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, the Science,\n\nIndustry, and Business section, and the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Ray Faiola and John Behrens at CBS Television kindly assisted me during my brief research foray at the network's New York headquarters. Mark Cantor (Los Angeles) and J. Fred MacDonald (Chicago) took time to discuss my project and to share rare video materials from their extensive personal collections of music on early television. The experience (and the footage) was very useful; special thanks to each of you. Numerous bright minds in Canada and the United States assisted me with this project. Some provided books and articles or other archival materials, others sent along the written fruits of their own research labor, while others provided editing and organizational suggestions. Thanks to Doug Battema, Elaine Hayes, Michele Hilmes, Steve \"The Machine\" Kosareff,Jason Mittel, Keith Negus, Elena Razlogova, Brian Rose, Lynn Spigel, Haidee Wasson, David Weinstein, and Mark Williams. Keir Keightley, Vincent Rocchio, David Sanjek, and Matt Stahl went above and beyond what was asked of them, taking time away from their own brilliant research projects to read and comment on sections of this book. Omar Arenas also provided helpful comments for chapter 6. Gentlemen, I thank you. Norma Coates is a kindred scholar (her work on television music after 1956 is the bomb!) and she too read several sections of the manuscript while freely sharing segments of her own excellent research directly and on conference panels; thanks, Norma. You're up! Finally, Ken Wissoker was a perfect editor throughout the process, offering encouragement and guidance at just the right times; thanks also to Leigh Barnwell at Duke University Press for helping with the details and getting the answers when I asked and N eal McTighe who assisted with the final production work. I am indebted to many colleagues and dear friends for their ongoing encouragement in this undertaking and all else. The initial inspiration for the book you now hold can be indirectly traced to George Szanto. Whenever daunting challenges in the research or writing emerged I could always blame George ... or thank him, which I do here. At Northeastern University many of my past and present colleagues in the Communication Studies Department have been extremely supportive; a special shout out to Jayson Harsin, Alison Hearn, P. David Marshall, David Monje, Joanne Morreale, Craig Robertson, Vincent Rocchio, Kumarini Silva, Marcus Breen, Michael Woodnick, and Alan Zaremba. Noah Danoff proved to be an excellent research assistant while providing fine company in the microfiche trenches; xii\n\n*\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nbig up, Noah! My intellectual fire was also fueled by my former coeditors at the Journal of Popular Music Studies, Reebee Garofalo, Jeff Melnick, Deborah Pacini Hernandez, Emmett Price III, and Rachel Rubin; thanks, guys! I enjoy the unqualified love and support of my family; a tip of the hat and a raised glass to Jan, Shawn, and Dave. La familia Arenas en Caracas, Venezuela, shared music, laughter, arepas, and rum; muchas gracias a todo la familia. My daughter Bayla Metzger patiently listened to me explain the joys of screening a Peggy Lee performance or the ongoing struggle to attain writer's eloquence; thanks for all that and more, Bay. As ever, Zamawa Arenas offered unfailing encouragement and \"held the fort on Fort\" while I was away doing research (or locked in mortal combat with an uncooperative computer). Strong of mind and character, tender of heart, Zamawa is a pillar in my world. Maybe now we can get back to that bolero, \"polishing the buckle.\" Te amo, mi amor. Finally, it was my parents who first introduced me to many of the musicians referenced in these pages. They each shared their recollections of postwar popular music and early television, providing important \"real world\" testimonies for some of my more uncertain ponderings. It is to them that I dedicate this book. My father passed away before this manuscript was complete, but he heard enough about it to know where it was heading. Perhaps, like Glenn Miller, he's still out there, eternally flying in his Lancaster, navigating to the dulcet strains of the band.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n*\n\nxiii\n\nPopular Music and the Small Screen Frontier\n\n* AN INTRODUCTION\n\nShortly after the launch of MTY in\n\n1981,\n\nwhen advertisers, re-\n\ncording industry corporations, and teen television viewers each applauded the network's debut, there was a sutge in critical assessments about its impact and the shifting role of the contemporary popular musician. Music television was the topic of intense debate across varied sectors of the entertainment industry and among the questions raised was how a twenty-fourhour all-music network might alter the status of musicians whose recorded sounds were heard widely and whose appearances in magazines, as television guest performers or hosts of TY\n\n\"specials,\" in films (often documentaries), or in live concerts,\n\nextended their public recognition and celebrity presence. While some artists such as Joe Jackson (who, it was wryly noted, \"has a face for radio\") expressed exasperation at the music industry's growing reliance on videos as promotional vehicles, many other established and rising artists leapt at the chance to advertise their sound and image over the music television network. The network's publicity slogan \"I Want My MTY\" quickly became a clarion call among eager young viewers across the nation. When MTY was introduced with a barrage of advertising,\n\ncultural critics and television historians cited some of the network's more pertinent television precedents. These included U.S. shows from the 1950S, 1960s, and 1970S such as American Bandstand, Shindig!, Hullabaloo, Soul\n\nTrain, Don Kirshner's Rock Concert, or The Midnight Special, and such historic televised musical events as Elvis Presley's spate of 1956 broadcast performances, the Beatles' first guest spots on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, or Presley's truly engaging 1968\n\nNBC\n\n\"comeback\" special. In these examples,\n\nthe benefits of \"breaking\" new acts on television were readily apparent, as were the potentials for veteran artists to introduce new material or to rehabilitate their careers by transforming their image or popular profile. Since its debut, MTY (and other music television networks in North America and internationally) has delivered countless groundbreaking musical telecasts, attaining its own status as a recognized cultural icon and trendsetter (something that continues even as the network has reduced its reliance on music videos in the United States). Many of MTY'S successes were recalled in 2001 and again in 2011, the network's twentieth and thirtieth anniversaries, briefly spurring renewed discussion about the phenomenon of \"music television\" and \"music videos.\" Scholars agree in principle that, despite shared and overlapping elements within the entertainment industries (especially in view of tendencies toward concentration of ownership, industrial convergence, and corporate synergy), the music and television sectors are not precisely alike, nor do they adhere to the same institutional forces or practices (Deaville, 2011). Norma Coates is critical of the term \"music television,\" suggesting that, \"it is premised on two separate realms, that of music and television, and in this instance the second term is engulfed by the first, given the cultural weight placed upon 'music'\" (2007: 22). For Coates, the intensified interest in \"music television\" since MTY'S inception has often ignored the television component. In what amounts to a manifesto, Coates provides a powerful corrective to what she regards as an inaccurate and improper analytical framework: This requires a conceprual shift to the srudy of television music, not music television. This is not an attempt at clever wordplay, but a call for change of the object and focus of analysis. Such a change of emphasis forces scholars to think about television music as television, to foreground the corresponding industrial, economic, programming, production, and business aspects of the medium as informed by the engagement of popular music. The deployment of television music as an analytical frame gen-\n\n2\n\n*\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nerates a different set of questions and conclusions than those previously posed and answered. It engenders inquiries into the impact of popular music on television conventions, styles, genres, writing, direction, lighting, and dance, to name a few. (ibid.: 23) With Coates's perspective close at hand and remaining mindful of the many scholarly discussions and academic publications devoted to music videos in the wake of MTV'S debut/ One Night on\n\nis Worth Weeks at the Paramount addresses the conjoined histories of popular music and television during the earliest phase of TV broadcasting. This book places music and television on equal footing, affirming the claim that television affected popular music in the immediate postwar era while substantiating the accompanying claim that music also affected the development of television through its embryonic stage. Despite abundant historical evidence attesting to the importance of popular music in television's early development there remain several noticeable gaps in the research on these linked cultural sectors. Few historians, it seems, have isolated the musical aspects of television's emergent phase for close and detailed study, although examples such as Horace Newcomb's (1997) critical appraisal of the musical passages in a single 1951 episode of The Texaco Star Theater (featuring host Milton Berle) offer rich analyses for consideration. Keith Negus (2006) also explores some of the early musical forays in television, simultaneously addressing the immediate postwar era and the contemporary period, identifying important threads of connection across roughly sixty years. As Negus notes, \"Histories of twentieth-century music have, in general, tended to ignore television .... Equally, studies of television have often devoted little attention to music\" (2006: 20-21). Existing entries on the history of television or the evolution of program genres almost never fully address popular music's central role in early program content, nor do historical studies of popular music grant sufficient attention to the multiple ways that music was introduced to the small screen in television's formative stages, with a few exceptions (e.g., Eberley 1982; Shumway 1997; Burns 1998; Rodman 2010). John Mundy, for example, offers valuable analytic insight onto the conjunctural relations between popular music and television at various stages of its development in Britain and the United States, appropriately situating popular music in the postwar era within a general framework of \"the screen\" encompassing both cinema and television. Yet his suggestion that there was\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n*\n\n3\n\nTV\n\n\"an initial reluctance to programme popular music\" (1999: 179) in the early television industry misrepresents the historical record of TV programming and content decisions in the United States since at least 1930, overlooking the many forms of musical presentation that existed on the small screen since the medium's early experimental stages. Such a claim defies the evidence of extant corporate memoranda, industrial documentation, or television kinescopes that testify to just the opposite conclusion, that there was, in fact, an intense need, desire, and effort to program popular music. In scholarly studies, music programs airing through the late 1940S and early 1950S, such as Peter Potter's Jukebox Jury, The Dinah Shore Show, The\n\nPerry Como Show, Toast of the Town, or Your Hit Parade may be referred to in passing, but seldom is there rigorous analysis of the character and content of the musical element on these early television shows. Gary Burns (1998) offers close analysis of the style and aesthetics of Your Hit Parade in the early 1950S, but he employs a cutious analytical approach foregrounding much\n\nlater aesthetic standards associated with\n\nMTV -era\n\nvideo practices that ob-\n\nscutes rather than explains the idiosyncrasies of these early broadcasts. Nor does Burns answer questions about the program's aesthetic construction and its significance in relation to music promotion or public taste and audience consumption at the time. Scholars seldom focus explicitly on the visual medium's impact as it rippled through the popular music sector of the wider entertainment industry at its inception. In this regard, Russell Sanjek and David Sanjek (1991) admirably address many significant factors that arose in the music industry with television's advent, yet their unrelenting emphasis on wider industrial issues forecloses the analysis of TV program content and production formats or other aspects of the medium that might be more broadly conceived as cultural. Among popular music scholars, then, the full range of music programming on television, spanning musical genres, performance styles, promotional strategies, and television production has generally been poorly acknowledged. In a similar context, though countless studies may isolate early television's musical or comedy variety shows as distinct and important genres they seldom explore music as a primary genre component of the medium in its nascent phase. Such scant attention to the role and importance of music on TV\n\namong television historians stands in marked contrast to the depth of\n\ncritical study and analysis devoted to, for instance, television's technological progress, policy development and industrial growth, and its dramatic or nar4\n\n*\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nrative content, or to various other influential TV genres such as the situation comedy or televised news broadcasting. Music on early television has all too often been an afterthought. In\n\nTV\n\na-Go-Go, a general market book about televised musical perfor-\n\nmance, Jake Austen (2005) offers a rather common perspective on early televised music. Austen reviles the earliest broadcasts of popular music (and, apparently, television itself, describing the medium as either \"the boob tube\" or \"idiot box\") and berates most of the musical fare that was screened prior to the mid-19S0S. Austen's explicit disdain for early televised musical content also informs his negative assessment of audiences at the time (especially female viewers) that in his estimation lacked sufficiently discerning taste. His narrow perspective, glorifying the emergence of rock 'n' roll on midfifties TV, leads Austen to denigrate the musical performances of programs such as The Perry Como Show, Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour, or Your Hit Parade, shows that in his opinion consisted of \"bland, reliable favorites of America's housewives\" (2005: 4). While the musical selections on these programs were undeniably oriented toward the popular mainstream, his curmudgeonly stance obliterates the opportunity to probe the relevant aspects of performance aesthetics, modes of production and staging, industry discourse, or viewer responses to what they were watching. More strikingly, Austen never inquires as to why so many people-including droves of \"America's housewives\" -watched and apparently enjoyed these programs. Like many others, Austen overlooks the fundamental elements that might have rendered these early programs and musical performances distinctive or entertaining. What, we might ask, made televised musical performances important and/or pleasurable? Most critical studies of popular music and television seem to underanalyze television's first broadcast years, picking up the thread and focusing intensely on the evolution of televised music after 1955 (Shumway 1997; Mundy 1999; Frith 2002).1his period encompasses the rapid rise of rock 'n' roll and is frequently associated with Elvis Presley's 1956-57 assault on the small screen, roughly concurrent with his departure from the independent Sun Records label after signing a new contract with the major\n\nRCA\n\nVictor\n\nlabel (a contract that included a requirement of at least ten \"personal appearance performances\" annually in support of his recordings). While briefly acknowledging television's prior music broadcasts from the late 1940S to the mid-19S0S (mainly in the United Kingdom), Simon Frith regards the period after 1955 as being of particular significance because, INTRODUCTION\n\n*\n\n5\n\nin his view, the relatively new television medium was an essential factor in the development of the even newer rock 'n' roll form and the ascendance of its music celebrities, including Presley. Frith writes, \"It certainly could be argued that the visual conventions of rock performance were shaped by television - because it was there - in ways that do not apply to musical gentes which pre-dated television\" (2002: 283). It is significant in this context, however, to acknowledge that to varying degrees, television was also \"there\" in 1936 and 1946, as well as in 1956, when Presley emerged with particular force. Though television was negligible through the 1930S and 1940S and the industry infrastructure was still under construction, networks were then also actively exploring the best ways to integrate popular music performances into TV production processes. As I will argue in the following pages, despite his cogent argument for television's significant influences on the evolution of rock 'n' roll (and virtually all pop music since), Frith's historical account falls slightly short by suggesting that earlier popular music broadcasts \"were more about bringing stage acts into the living room than about changing their performance conventions\" (ibid.). In this book I assert that, while television's presentational power was more fully realized in the period after rock 'n' roll's emergence as Frith contends, the transformations of musical performance and broadcasting conventions were already well under way by the time Presley hit the screen. Addressing the broadcast of R\n\n& B\n\nmusicians over southern radio in the\n\n1940S and 19Sos, the Turkish expatriate and influential record industry executive Ahmet Ertegan posed the question, \"Young white teenagers heard them on those top-of-the-dial stations and began requesting them. What the hell was Elvis listening to when he was growing up?\" (Szatmary 1991: 36). Turning such queries toward the visual broadcast medium, although Presley's\n\nTV\n\npresence and his jarring performance style generate considerable\n\nattention (Rodman 1996; Shumway 1997; Mundy 1999; Austen 2005) never, ever is it suggested that by 1956 Presley was, like Americans far and wide, also\n\nwell acquainted with television, absorbing the medium's aesthetic forms and visual lessons that were on display nightly. We should also, therefore, pose the question, What the hell was Elvis watching when he was growing up? The particulars of Presley's teen\n\nTV\n\nviewing patterns are not well estab-\n\nlished, although numerous interviews and observations attest to the extent of his engagement with the medium, allowing for speculation about his viewing habits and\n\nTV\n\ninfluences. Presley was a product of a cultural 6\n\n*\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nmoment when television emerged as a new and influential medium alongside more established and traditional facets of the entertainment industry, including recording, radio broadcasting, jukeboxes, film, and clubs and theater concerts. By all accounts he was an eager consumer in all mediums. He moved with his parents from Tupelo, Mississippi, to Memphis, Tennessee, in 1948 when he was thirteen years old, graduating from high school in 1953. Philip Ennis writes that in Presley's Memphis, \"The four radio stations founded in the 1920S were augmented by five more, along with two TV stations\" (1992: 232). Because he was raised in lower-class economic conditions through the late 1940s, television viewing was most likely something that occurred outside the family home, yet by 1956 Presley was a professional touring musician who was comfortable in finer hotels and other sites where televisions were standard. The photographer Alfred Wertheimer (1979) recounts that, in mid1956, Presley's new home at 1034 Audubon Drive in Memphis was outfitted with three TV sets, along with a hi-fi stereo console. Presley's bedroom television set was also equipped with a Zenith remote control device (a unit that, having only reached the commercial market in 1956, made for a higherpriced TV set), suggesting that Presley was both familiar with the medium and an early adopter of newTV technology (Ritz 2005). Apart from Presley's status as a vibrant performer, rock 'n' roll pioneer, and sensitive interpreter of ballads and country spirituals, therefore, it is appropriate to assert that by mid-decade he was also a seasoned TV viewer. Television was, for him and a vast number of his teenage fans, normal. One Night on TV presents a detailed historical account and analysis of television's early musical programming, encompassing the content that was available to Presley and the emergent rock 'n' roll generation. To fully comprehend the implications of the intersection of popular music and television it is consequently necessary to evaluate their dynamics and interaction over a longer duration, assessing evolutionary processes that include practices of experimentation and the ongoing refinement of aesthetic or programming strategies, as well as other more expansive cultural factors that came to bear on the character of both music and television. Without delving into this formative era and adopting an extended view of the emergent television industry's accommodation of music and musical performance, there is a risk of neglecting the rich and convoluted tale of how popular music and television were merged in deliberate fashion and adopted by audiences in unique and decidedly nonpassive ways; in contemINTRODUCTION\n\n*\n\n7\n\nporary terminology this might be described as a matter of \"media convergence\" (Jenkins 2006). In another account of popular music on television in the mid-1950S, Kevin Donnelly emphasizes Elvis Presley's importance, writing, \"Live television broadcasts relied upon the performance of musical numbers as much as they relied upon other 'turns' from the stage, offering the opportunity for audiences to see stars from close quarters. With the arrival of rock 'n' roll, popular music became more stridently visual, embodied by the impact (both real and imagined) of Elvis swinging his hips\" (2001: 89). Donnelly's account is fairly standard of the writing on musical presentation and early television; there is nothing necessarily out of order in his brief overview of the broadcast industry's shift from radio to television and the rise of a new visual emphasis on musical performance. Yet the suggestion that music was merely \"relied upon\" is inadequate for an elaborated understanding of the ways in which television either embraced or alienated musicians and others associated with the music and entertainment industries. This description displaces the actual labor of unionized musicians who appeared on early television, and it understates the artistry that eventually led to superior television performances, basically discounting the thick tangle of industrial and cultural circumstances that influenced the convergence of popular music and early television. A certain analytical orthodoxy tends to seep into many of the narratives about early TV's musical performances, obscuting the complex processes involved in the evolution of presentational norms and standards. Such narrative portrayals (for example, the stock references to Presley's scandalously physical performance style) remain relevant to Out contemporary understanding of broadcasting history, yet they also tend to reinforce or fix certain \"common sense\" facets of broadcasting lore without fully exploring the various resonant historical factors relating to industrial, aesthetic, and more broadly cultural issues. This is ultimately how rock 'n' roll mythology has been forged. If the general perception maintains that, for example, Presley's televised performances were somehow radical and revolutionary for the medium in 1956, that with his arrival television somehow \"became more stridently visual,\" then there is also need for careful explanation of why this is so. The customary account of a powerful and sudden rupture, rooted in Presley's television year, seems ill conceived when roughly eight years of prior musical broadcasts are taken into consideration. The prevailing views of Presley's arrival and televised portrayal diminish the \"strident\" visuality of 8\n\n*\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n(to cite only a very partial set of exemplary performers) Desi Arnaz, Cab Calloway, Lorraine Cugat, Ina Ray Hutton, Spike Jones, Big Jay McNeely, Johnnie Ray, and literally scores of other musicians who appeared on television as musical guests or hosted their own TV programs after 1948. This emphasis on Presley and his particular mode of visual performance also implies that the incredibly nuanced music and performance styles of established TV mainstays that I analyze in the following pages, including Perry Como, Frankie Laine, Liberace, Peggy Lee, Tony Martin, Dinah Shore, and Lawrence Welk, are somehow of lesser value or importance, ignoring the rewards of a performance aesthetic that is frequently registered in the combination of gentle-hued ballads, softly cast vocal phrasing, restrained orchestral rhythmic strucrures, and subtle physical gestures. Indeed, Presley's televised performances of ballads or southern spiritual numbers shared much in their presentational style with many of TV'S leading musical program hosts of the day, and he openly professed his respect and appreciation of the TV veterans Perry Como and Eddie Fisher. The performances by Presley's predecessors might also be considered \"stridently visual\" if one is attuned to the more gentle and innocuous shadings of musical performance and television presentation. In order to understand the important distinctions among musical broadcasts, it requires more than the mere assertion that vocalists such as Perry Como or Dinah Shore reflect average or \"bland\" cultural tastes or that they represent insignificant mainstream musical values as many historians and critics comfortably claim. Rather, it is of vastly greater interest to acknowledge the importance of these individuals and to tease out the differences between, for example, Shore and her television contemporaries Hutton and Lee or to analyze the distinctions between male vocalists such as Como, Martin, Laine, Frank Sinatra, or Vaughn Monroe. The industry certainly registered such distinctions. This approach involves observing how production processes (including camera placement, set design, and stage lighting), song selection, brief comedy skits, cosrumes, and physical comportment combine to orient the performances toward distinct and varying social spaces (i.e., the domestic or public spheres) and, accordingly, varied cultural values and identities (encompassing simple virtue, exoticism, feminine sexual allure, masculine vulnerability or virility, nostalgia, etc.). Auxiliary sources such as contemporaneous media and industry analyses of musical programs or performances and, where possible, audience commentary, enrich the understanding of the evolution of televised musical performances. INTRODUCTION\n\n*\n\n9\n\nIn order to more fully comprehend how popular music was integrated into early television at its inception and how musical presentation developed through TV'S first years, it is necessary to illuminate a wide range of factors that include industry motivations, aesthetic innovations, and cultural transformations in the period immediately prior to Presley's ostensibly outrageous gyrations. This book seeks to identify and analyze the dominant performance and broadcast conventions within which a twenty-one-yearold Elvis Presley was working when he made his television debut in January 1956. As I will illustrate, the evidence suggests that Presley was conventional and revolutionary, conformist and innovative. His TV appearances between January 1956 and January 1957 sustained certain standards of performance and presentation that had evolved over roughly a decade even as he introduced a unique, idiosyncratic style that broke from many of television's established patterns. The television studies theorist John Corner writes, \"Study of television has often been preoccupied with the contemporary moment; it has been the study of the perpetual present. The limitations of this when, among other things, we now need a steady sense of the past in order to understand the significance of imminent and future change, will quickly become apparent\" (1999: 121). Taking Corner's emphasis on historical research to heart, my main claim is that popular music was never peripheral to the early conception of television programming and content at the medium's inception; it was, in fact, of central concern and was deemed essential to television's public acceptance and the industry's commercial viability. Even in television's most primitive stages, from the early 1930S to the late 1940s, executives and program developers in the emergent broadcasting sector were convinced that the medium's success required popular music performances with a pronounced visual component. It can be stated without ambiguity that popular music has been part of television from the beginning. Drawing on original archival materials from the music and television industries from the 1930S, 1940s, and 1950S (trade journals, executive memoranda, press releases and other promotional materials) and from contemporaneous mainstream press articles (including TV program reviews, celebrity profiles, industry analyses),z this book explores how popular music was integrated into early television and how television (as an industry, as a medium, and as a cultural institution) accommodated music in its broad range of genres and performance styles. It analyzes the means by which musical presentation gradually became a standardized facet of television broadcasts. 10\n\n*\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThroughout the following pages I scrutinize the discussions, debates, and industry decisions that influenced popular music's role in television broadcasting and the deliberate processes through which popular music presentation gradually adhered\n\nto\n\never-more familiar broadcasting conventions. I\n\ntake much inspiration from Kay Dickinson, whose research on music and film and the interrelations between aesthetic and industrial issues provides abundant insight. She writes: \"We should interrogate the labor expended on maintaining horizontal integration across entertainment industries like music and cinema, not only that leisute commodities might somehow speak to\n\nand of greater fractures in how more everyday employment functions,\n\nbut also that the work of the media, in all sorts of senses, should figure more prominently in academic inquiry\" (2008: 4). After 1948, when television sales accelerated and the medium's influence became more distinct, musicians and others working in the entertainment industries more frequently offered their own detailed industry assessments, attempting to understand television's value and effects in its ascendance as a cultural force. In these instances, the terms and structure of debate often illustrate wider social and cultural concerns of the postwar period, revealing diverse interests and ideals that were implicated in individuals' pursuit of leisure and entertainment as well as the search among musicians for employment or the expression of artistry. The challenge from the present juncture is to identify the specific means through which television's musical programs were defined and to carefully document and analyze the aesthetic influences and the industrial approaches that were employed as televised musical performances occupied a new and pervasive role in American culture. Instead of approaching the medium and its first several years of musical presentation as a set of easily recognizable and commonly accepted achievements, it has proven to be more productive-and accurate-to approach 1940S and early 1950S television as an incomplete project, very much part of \"a work in progress\" that was prone\n\nto\n\nerrors, miscues, and foibles in both a broader institutional orientation and in its regular daily programming. This is how many observers, both within and outside the music and television broadcasting industries, understood it at the time. Lest we forget exactly how uncharted the television terrain was in this formative period, even the terminology used\n\nto\n\ndescribe the medium was\n\nuncertain: congratulating the dance band leader Fred Waring on his first \"official\" broadcast on\n\nNBC\n\nduring the network's launch of a regular proINTRODUCTION\n\n*\n\n11\n\ngram schedule during the New York World's Fair in May 1939, the network president John Royal proclaimed, \"You caught the tempo of television better than anybody we've seen on the thingamajig - whatever we decide to call it\" (Royal 1939 ). Even by 1948, the language surrounding the medium was apparently indeterminate, as reported in Modern TV and Radio: \"People inside and outside the broadcasting field are looking around for a new word for television - which is considered too long and cumbersome. 'Video' and 'TV' have been tried out, but they don't seem to catch the public fancy. A London newspaper recently asked its readers for suggestions and some of the words they came up with are 'Telio; 'Luksee; 'Oculo; 'C-U; and 'Lookies'\" (December 1948: 12). In 1950, James C. Petrillo, the president of the American Federation of Musicians, acknowledged, \"Television is here to stay\"; yet he also admitted to puzzlement about the trajectory of television and the networks' plans for its ongoing development: The disagreement among the employers themselves as to what television is going to do is unbelievable. They have so many different ideas and predictions that most of them contradict each other, and after listening to them for a couple of years, I find myself a little confused as to who has the right ideas and predictions.... When you really pin them all down, the answer is the same- they just don't know. (\"TV Only Job Hope\" 1950: 18) With these contemporaneous perspectives I endeavor in this book to analyze televised musical performances and the evolution of musical programming in the spirit of an era when public skepticism, awe, or inspiration for the new broadcast medium were widespread, when the consequences of television's arrival were yet unknown, and the possibility of its failure still remained quite real. Today, music and television are closely linked as components of cultural industry and artistic enterprise and it is standard practice that musicians' contracts include obligations to appear in videos and other televised promotional endeavors. The images and sounds of contemporary pop, rock, rap, metal, emo, R & B, country, and countless other genres or subgenres (that are associated with varying cultural environments and different temporal eras) emit from the television on a twenty-four-hour cycle, framed within an array of program formats and presentational styles that attest to the incredible success of televising music. Clearly the institution of television did\n\n12\n\n*\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nnot fail, and it is a given today that television and popular music are tightly entwined. It is from this vantage that I look back on television's formative stages. Chapter 1 focuses on television's early history largely before 1948. It isolates the industrial considerations that emerged as executives developed the new medium, and it profiles several documented musical performances that occurred in the contexts of television laboratory experiments or network demonstrations through the 1930S and 1940s. These first tentative performances-not\n\nTV\n\nbroadcasts as such, since they were often in-house\n\naffairs sent over closed-circuit systems - indicate that popular music was always a prominent consideration among television executives and that there was active effort involved in developing suitable presentational techniques through which music would be made viable for the small screen. This discussion encompasses early predictions and informed critical views on television's implementation of music. I end this chapter with a detailed assessment of the role of the American Federation of Musicians and its controversial chief, James C. Petrillo, as professional union musicians approached television as an emergent industrial labor sector. In chapter 2, I analyze the themes of opportunity and optimism and the concurrent perceptions of risk or anxiety that arose when television was introduced to working musicians within the popular music sector. With television's development, artists throughout the performing arts were confronted with a critical professional dilemma: many questioned how they could benefit from the new opportunities offered by television, whether acquiring access to a vast, dispersed audience or tapping the medium's unknown potentials as an effective promotional or marketing vehicle. For them, television was a dynamic environment within which they might thrive. Conversely, others, including music industry veterans and employees in related entertainment sectors, asked how television might potentially damage their carefully managed reputations or undermine their professional livelihoods. Unfounded speculation and anxiety were, in many instances, reinforced by actual data figures as television's impact became clearer. Television's rapid rise as a powerful new force competing for capital, talent, and audience attention produced positive and negative effects that reverberated throughout the music industry. Drawing from the ample resources available in music and entertainment industry trade papers from the period, this chapter monitors the discursive patterns that emerged in the wider enter-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n*\n\n13\n\ntainment industry with television's advent and it assesses the implications of shifting industrial practices across various sectors of the music business. The evolution and establishment of various musical program gentes with their accompanying conventions comprises the focus of chapter 3. Although popular music was assumed to be an indispensable component of early television programming even before the technical bugs had been engineered out of the system, the methods of successfully presenting music were by no means assured. While the character and aesthetics of vaudeville and the music halls of the early twentieth century, Tin Pan Alley song styles, and film, nightclub or Broadway-style musical performances dominated, programming directors and other television executives were eagerly intent on designing something new and different, something distinctly televisual. Isolating examples of televised musical programming and the emergence of recognizable gente formulas (with specific attention to nightclub-oriented programs and DJ/teen dance shows), I critically examine the issues and aspects that informed their production and standardization. Chapter 4 addresses the aesthetics of musical performance on television. The chapter scrutinizes specific televised musical performances across network programs as well as analyzing musicians' disparate views about performance practices and television's emergent presentational conventions. Included here is the acknowledgment that performance is inextricably related to\n\nan artist's persona, a relationship that necessitates the identification of\n\nspecific performance traits if we expect\n\nto\n\ncomprehend the connection be-\n\ntween artistic reputations and performance mannerisms. I explain how television's much-vaunted demand for distinct, expressive visual routines created considerable rancor among musicians. Many artists struggled in their attempts to transition into television, recoiling when they were suddenly called upon\n\nto\n\nparticipate in onscreen shtick and comedic skits that were\n\ndismissively dubbed \"funny hats routines.\" With television producers' increased demands for visual and comedic performances, a discourse of authenticity, seriousness, and artistic integrity surfaced as musicians attempted to maintain their reputations in the face of television's unprecedented visual stipulations. Chapters 5 and 6 identify the unique contributions of black and Latino musicians in an era when racial and ethnic representation in the mainstream media was a point of dispute and struggle. As we see in chapter 5, despite the prevailing notion that African American actors were underrepresented in early television, the historical evidence indicates a relatively lively and robust 14\n\n*\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\npresence of musicians in various program contexts. The networks strived to incorporate black musical performances in their broadcasts, devising new internal policies that, gradually, integrated the networks and their program schedules. As television established itself in the nation's major urban hubs, black musicians were essential in ensuring that there was sufficient highcaliber talent on the air, though the racial \"sensibilities\" of the\n\nu.s. South\n\npresented a broadcasting dilemma for the national networks. While numerous musicians forged successful careers in television, few were assigned their own programs, creating substantial backlash among the nation's cultural critics and community watchdogs. Latin music on TV comprises the content of chapter 6. Throughout the 1930S and 1940s, South American cultural motifs were grafted onto U.S. Tin Pan Alley compositions and many stereotypical representations appeared in Hollywood cinema, providing a foundation for television's program content. U.S. foreign policy, coupled with corporate expansion into new international markets also drew the United States closer to Latin America throughout the war years and afterward. With television's inception, Latin music found a new site where musicians could perform the rumba, conga, and most important, the mambo, in the latter case helping to fuel a surging dance and music trend that swept the nation. The performances gradually displayed several conventional production traits that included standard costumes, spatial references, and dance flourishes that communicated an indelible \"Latin flavor.\" In his theoretical analyses of television performance and popular music, Philip Auslander advocates \"doing close readings of particular performances\" in order to better understand the complicated relationships between musical artists and the various industrial and cultural forces that are in motion at any given period (2004: 9). This calls for the screening of actual televised musical performances as a means of augmenting the theoretical and original/primary materials that also offer context and data about music and early television. Taking Auslander's cue, in the course of researching this book I meticulously viewed roughly two hundred tapes of televised musical broadcasts in order to determine how popular music was staged in various presentational modes and the many ways that musical acts were contextualized as TV\n\nprogram genres evolved and broadcast formulae matured. Initially saved\n\non kinescope tapes and, later, transferred to videotape by archivists, early TV\n\nprograms are, with increasing frequency, also broadcast on contempo-\n\nrary cable television networks such as TV Land and made available through INTRODUCTION\n\n*\n\n15\n\nonline nostalgia brokers that market videotapes and\n\nDVD\n\ncopies of classic\n\nprograms, or they are available for screening through web options including YouTube or dedicated websites maintained by independent history buffs. These tapes offer visual corroboration for the contemporaneous views expressed in published articles, artist interviews, and\n\nTV\n\nprogram reviews\n\nthat describe specific programs and performances or that generally address televised musical presentations from the late\n\n1940S\n\nand early\n\n1950S.\n\nThe\n\nvisual material also confirms that, despite the rudimentary nature of television in its formative phase, its content and character was heterogeneous and, at times, extremely sophisticated in its formal construction. Images reveal many of the mannerisms and cultural mores of the immediate postwar era, thus exposing wider aspects of social value and meaning-elements of\n\nsocial significance - and the role of music as a communicative force. One Week on TV Is Worth Weeks at the Paramount, therefore, directly engages themes and issues from a period when television was still new and very much in its experimental mode. It probes the evolution of the emergent TV\n\nindustry as corporate executives, engineers, and producers navigated the\n\ntechnical and aesthetic aspects of musical presentation in their struggle to establish content and programming conventions. It foregrounds the dominant issues and anxieties within the music industry in the postwar period, detailing the means by which musicians and those with stakes in the music industry (financial or otherwise) encountered the new broadcast medium and integrated it into their professional strategies and artistic practices.\n\n16\n\n*\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI Music, Image, Labor\n\n* TELEVISION'S PREHISTORY\n\nPopular music and television are inextricably entwined. When television was nothing more than a dream in the mind of visionaries or a conundrum troubling scientists around the world, there was a clear sense that the sounds and images of musical performance would one day converge in a single broadcast transmission. The widely circulated notion of \"radio with pictures\" in the 1920S made sense then since much of television's invention, financing, and program planning emerged directly from the radio broadcasting industry. As countless historians have explained since, even though radio was less than a decade old and still developing as a standard facet of daily life at the end of what was termed \"the roaring twenties\" or \"the jazz age,\" the earliest television broadcast experiments regularly incorporated musical performances (Fisher and Fisher 1996; Koszarski 2008; Magoun 2009; Rodman 2010). Documents show that many radio network executives believed that their approaches to programming and scheduling (with popular music prominently featured) would prevail although they could not forecast what television's content might actually look like. The issue of visualizing popular music consequently presented an early dilemma in TV content development.\n\nWhen synchronized sound was still relatively new in cinema (having been successfully launched in 1927 following the release of a series of short synchsound films) musicals quickly won public favor (Gabbard 1996; Mundy 1999; Koszarski 2008). Featuring spectacular imagery sttuctured upon the thinnest of narrative scaffolding and musical performances by some of the era's most popular artists, the early film musicals were indebted to Broadway's presentational logic. Yet by the mid-1930S there was still nothing that could be described as a tradition of film musicals that television pioneers might emulate. Television's early indeterminacy presented a major conceptual barrier but, of course, the challenges accompanying such indeterminacy can also inspire expansive thinking and lead to incredible innovation. Broadcast executives were expected to project how television might fit within their existing range of services and those in charge of radio programming and content development attempted to predict how abstract audience formations would respond to hypothetical TV shows. Imagining television - what it would be, whom it would be for - necessitated deep and probing analysis of an array of cultural factors encompassing the spirit and conditions of an era. Somehow, during an economic depression and throughout a horrific war, the television industry continued to grow and evolve even as various other industrial sectors stalled and a great many original ideas withered on the vine. And while television's creators worked to improve the medium, musicians were intrinsically involved in the ongoing television experiment, at times toiling as full-fledged collaborators. After the war there was a remarkable burst of invention with several ctucial developments facilitating the convergence of popular music and television. In each of TV'S transitional phases, discussions always incorporated popular music and the broadcast value of musical performances. The dominant discourses and public debates concerning early television and the role of popular music are noteworthy for they often illuminate other important features of the period, revealing a dynamic cultural vortex. By exploring some of the key sociocultural elements at television's inception (involving art and aesthetics, technology, and institutional entities) and the ways in which television was positioned among them, we might generate a better sense of the underlying values that informed the nation's cultural expression and leisure practices and the concurrent stakes for popular music and its performers.\n\n18\n\n*\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nPreparing for Television: The 1930s\n\nIn a December 1930 corporate memorandum, George Engles, National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) vice president in charge of programs, wrote that with the emergence of visual broadcast capabilities it would be increasingly necessary to review and vet the physical or telegenic attributes of the singers hired by the network. Engles gently upbraided Bertha Brainard of the network's Program Department, reminding her that with \"the forecast of oncoming television and the new requirements it would demand in the pictorial quality of our artist personnel\" there was intensifying pressure to \"revamp\" the musical talent under contract \"with a view to having when needed a picture that would pass the censors\" (1930a). In this context, the \"censors\" to which Engles refers were internal network executives charged with evaluating the look and comportment of prospective TV talent, ensuring that no one deemed to be of sub-par physical appearance would be hired as television broadcasting progressed. Brainard was the extremely rare woman in an organizational cadre dominated by men, having entered radio broadcasting in the early 1920S and risen in NB C's Program Department, where she worked closely with senior executives including Engles and John F. Royal (Halper 2001). Memoranda from the 1930S reveal Brainard's firm principles, shrewd mind, and sharp wit, and in her reply to Engles she subtly requested examples of any incidents where she and her programming unit may have failed to adequately assess the visual potential of vocalists, further suggesting that such a process of judgment requires an agreed-upon set of criteria. Noting the apparently subjective nature of such visual appraisals, she writes, \"I find, unfortunately, a question of who is and who is not good looking, arising in the men's minds\" (Brainard 1930). As these exchanges indicate, during television's earliest phase no one had a clear sense of how the medium would accommodate the various expressions of art and culture, including musical performance, nor was there a stable notion of a visual standard for musical presentation. The discussions were fully in the realm of abstraction. Those such as Brainard and Engles (as well as countless engineers, directors, and programmers who were tasked with designing television) strived to meet as-yet-undefined broadcasting goals, to predict and then fulfill viewer expectations. Profoundly lacking rules and formal guides, television's first decision-makers - both independents and\n\nMUSIC, IMAGE, LABOR\n\n*\n\n19\n\nthose working under the aegis of corporate broadcasters - stumbled forward with speculation more than fact at their disposal. In retrospect, theirs seems an almost impossible undertaking. The dialogue between Engles and Brainard points to an emergent visual strategy at the network. It articulates the beginning of an industrial process that involved TV's appropriation and insttumental attitudes toward popular music and musicians that would only intensify over the next twenty-five years. Their interaction also indicates that the visual regime championed by Engles evolved at the network as a source of pressure and even coercion, challenging the prevailing practices and audio supremacy associated with radio broadcasting. Brainard's push back against Engles should not, therefore, be regarded as insubordination but as an example of two paradigms colliding within the specific contexts of 1930S corporate broadcasting. Engles further outlined the problem of visualizing music in a lengthy response to Brainard, explaining, \"Several tumors had come to me that various members of the Program Department were pushing artists whose sole claim to distinction lies in their voices\" (1930b). His barely contained ire was based on the belief that employees in the network's Program Department evidently remained committed to the established talent recruitment and hiring practices of radio broadcasting. In his view, Brainard and her colleagues in the Program Department lacked proper foresight as plans for the network's television broadcasting branch evolved, as well as falling short of NBC'S corporate objectives. David Sarnoff, president of NBC'S parent company Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and a driving figute responsible for the formation of NBC in 1926, was an early and constant supporter of television. The network's executives and middle management were exposed to a stream of directives and corporate statements from Sarnoff addressing the medium's development. Indeed, Sarnoff staked much of his reputation on television's success. The issue of musicians' image and appearance developed into a central topic as television evolved, creating conflict and debate about visual or autal primacy in musical presentation. The interaction between Engles and Brainard conveys a pressure that is common within hierarchical, top-down structures of power. As an executive representative, Engles exerted a coercive force extending institutional authority. He communicated NBC'S corporate line within a chain of command and as volumes of published records confirm, his emphasis on television reflects Sarnoffs priorities at the time. Sarnoff's corporate support\n\n20\n\n*\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nfor technical research and his aggressive legal maneuvering pertaining to TV patent issues represent two fronts in an effort to dominate early television; programming represents a third front. Engles and Brainard were not merely encountering an insignificant impasse but, rather, they were engaged in a discussion about the process through which the corporation would integrate music in the manifestation of television. In utging the Program Department\n\nto\n\nconsider television's particular\n\nvisual demands pertaining to singers, Engels introduced the terms \"salable outstanding radio artists\" or \"salable talent\" to his discoutse about musical performances. The implication was that the commercial practicality of any given artist and, by extension, any given television program would eventually be judged according to the combined standards of performers' appearances\n\nand their musical talent, drawing television nearer to stage performances and cinema than to radio. In one sense, Engles's reference to salability points to a perceived need for musical artists to make a solid impression; to \"sell\" a song was a common expression among entertainers, referring to a quality performance that registered positively. Engles implies more, however. He also addresses the need for musical artists to essentially sell themselves to audiences through their engaging performances and innate visual appeal. Here we get closer to the evolving notions of artists' commodified congeniality and television presence that was regularly attached to the concept of television in its nascent period. In yet another related sense germane to the era, the commercially oriented terminology suggests that it is television itself that must be \"sold\" to a public that was, by the mid- to late 1930S, highly familiar with radio broadcasting and with the performance aesthetics of film musicals and live theater or nightclubs but that was also skeptical of the early TV industry's promise of a fuller, visually enhanced entertainment experience (especially one that necessitated the putchase of an expensive new electrical appliance). Music was going to help sell the concept of television to the public. The discoutse of commercial/commodity value and televised musical performances speaks to the extent to which culture was ensconced within a capitalist logic at this historical moment but it also reflects how deeply invested in commercial media and music industry economics NBC, television's industry leader, was at the time. Russell and David Sanjek (1991) explain how Sarnoff oversaw both the implementation of NBC'S nationwide broadcast network and the acquisition of the Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) the-\n\nMUSIC, IMAGE, LABOR\n\n*\n\n21\n\nater chain and film production company in\n\n1928\n\nand spearheaded\n\nRCA'S\n\npurchase of the Victor Talking Machine Company (creating the RCA Victor phonograph company) in 1929. After the 1930S, popular music lay at the center of each of these sectors and the corporate jockeying for dominance notably affected television's trajectory. Industry executives injected a pronounced capitalist sensibility into television's development even though the programming structure and content - the medium's main selling point - had not fully congealed. The popular music sector had by this point already proven its strengths and value in relation to the commercial culture industries and radio, too, was confirmed as a valid medium within purely corporate and capitalist ideals. By conceiving TV'S programming content in relation to abstract commodity values before any norms or standards existed the industry was operating within a symbolic realm whereby culrural texts are understood as objects with commercial worth. The programs and the musical performances were all oriented toward the logic of commodification and consumption, setting a pattern for the entire future of the medium. Establishing a workable program schedule and ensuring top-quality performances was a prime objective if the public was to be \"sold\" on the new medium. In this reading, televised musical performances can be attached to a range of other commercial interests, and, in fact, the whole notion of TV viewer expectation, pleasure, or satisfaction can be linked to commercial and commodity values. Engles and other executives were, thus, dedicated to creating a commercial medium that could deliver consistently engaging and pleasurable shows that featured visually attractive musical performers. The industry's early deliberations surrounding the role of popular music on television indicate a tendency toward the brute appropriation of musical talent, reflecting attirudes that prevailed throughout the medium's developmental phase and over the next quarter century. Without explicitly declaring that an artist's visual appearance and telegenic qualities trumped his or her musicality, Engles (among others) seems to place these attributes at least on par in the commercial contexts of television broadcasting. Although this position may have seemed contentious to some at the time, the perspective was not unknown in the realm of musical theater or cinema where physical appearances were crucial in casting. Such concerns were also an integral factor in the production of modern icon starus; good-looking actors or musicians fared inordinately well in the nascent celebrity culture of the early twentieth century. 22\n\n*\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nThe film industry had confronted somewhat similar issues, if in reverse. When synchronized sound technology facilitated the \"talkies\" in the 1920S (the first feature-length film with synchronized musical selections being\n\nTheJazz Singer, in 1927), a host of attractive screen actors quickly found that, despite their acting talent, physical attributes, or film experience, their vocal abilities were under close scrutiny and subject to intensified critique as dialogue-laden scripts and musical scenes were popularized. For some (rumored to include the top silent film stars John Gilbert and Norma Talmadge), looking good or moving well onscreen was not always enough; they had to sound good as well in order to \"sell\" both the individual movie and the concept of the talkies. For artists faced with imminent irrelevance, the enlistment of vocal coaches and elocution lessons was a desperate attempt to maintain a footing in the changing industry. Musicians hired to provide musical accompaniment for the silent films in the nation's movie houses were also summarily dismissed with the advent of synch-sound. With the prospect of television,\n\nNBC'S\n\nEngles expressed an apparent willingness\n\nto hire marginally inferior musical talents possessing better-than-average physical traits, urging his staff to identify appropriate-looking singers, especially those already under contract with\n\nNBC'S\n\nradio branch, who could be\n\nefficiently plucked from the existing talent roster on the network's payroll. The rather blunt exchanges that flitted between\n\nNBC\n\nexecutives over\n\nmusical talent and telegeneity in the 1930S align with two of Simon Frith's observations, that \"the dominant use of music on television, one might conclude, is to sell things\" and \"looking good on television has always been essential for success\" (2002: 281-84). It is important to acknowledge, however, that the social practices and the discourses informing early television's commercial trends and its visual character also have their own unique histories. Each evolved in a nonlinear fashion as various industrial and cultural factors ebbed and surged. As television progressed through the 1930S, there was never a doubt that it would be anything other than commercial (the balance between culturally edifying content, strictly educational fare, and popular entertainment remained a point of considerable debate), yet in this early instance, television was not a fully realized technological medium or a commercially viable broadcast option. Much of the commentary in the 1930S was subsequently hypothetical, projecting various cultural values,\n\nhopes, and ideals as much as solid plans for television's future.\n\nMUSIC, IMAGE, LABOR\n\n*\n\n23\n\nTV's Song and Dance Experiments\n\nFrom the 1920S to the late 1940S prominent inventors (in the United States, Allen B. Du Mont, Philo T. Farnsworth, C. Francis Jenkins, and Vladimir Zworykin among them) or teams of comparatively anonymous scientists in corporate laboratories (A.T.T., General Electric, and Westinghouse were most prominent) worked to construct reliable TV srudio production equipment or reception appliances while executives applied themselves to building an efficient television broadcasting system. For the science and engineering wizzes, content was a subordinate concern that served a purpose for the testing of transmission and reception. Jonathan Sterne identifies similar tendencies in sound reproduction experiments of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (involving recordings on phonograph cylinders), observing that the content of the recordings were \"clearly aimed at the middleclass market\" (featuring musical pieces that echoed \"the range of subject matter in other middle-class entertainment\") and that \"the recordings were very much limited by the parameters of the available technology\" (2003; 244). In reproducing and transmitting sound, simple phrases and familiar musical ditties (or, at least, familiar musical gentes such as marches) were the standard for laboratory experiments and for public demonstrations. According to Richard Koszarski (2008), in their rudimentary broadcasts the engineer-headed experimental TV stations in New York City and the surrounding environs all at one time or another fearured children's vocal choruses and adult soloists, piano players and instrumentalists, and the occasional Broadway performer. The CB S network launched its television station with much fanfare in July 1931; while still very much an experimental station, the launch featured musical performances by the talented radio and recording vocal trio the Boswell Sisters/ the newcomer Kate Smith (her\n\nW2XAB\n\nradio and recording career still ahead of her), and the inestimable George Gershwin, who performed the song \"Liz a,\" composed two years earlier. With the technological barriers rapidly falling away in the 1930S, television's content and the accompanying issues of visual allure were reprioritized among the broadcast industry's executive decision-makers, who rurned their focus toward presentational aesthetics and programming strategies that, like the prior sound reproduction trials, might appeal to middle-class values and middlebrow tastes? In 1935, NBC'S Bertha Brainard again figured in discussions about the intensifying need to define television's programming and refine the visualiza24\n\n*\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\ntion of popular music. She received a memorandum from William Fairbanks of the network's Statistical Department, who referred to an experimental demonstration on June 3, 1935, at the NBC television laboratory located in Camden, New Jersey, that, as he explains, included \"a very ambitious sight and sound reproduction of Fred Waring's rendition of 'Lullaby of Broadway' as a production number\" (1935). The decision to emphasize Waring's performance was surely based in his general popularity as a bandleader and his prior film experience: he and his band The Pennsylvanians had participated in the production of Vitaphone musical shorts in the late 1920S and in 1929 they headlined in the film Syncopation, \"the first feature-length musical\n\nmade in New York\" (Koszarski 2008: 170). Fairbanks enclosed a copy of the script from the Camden demonstration detailing a forty-five-minute musical production structured upon a recognizable Broadway theater format featuring music selections sung by the cast (com posed of Billy Milton, Sara Allgood, Rose Walker, Reita Nugent, Georgie Harris, Charlie Woods, and a dance chorus aptly called The Eight Good Lookers) with musical accompaniment by Sydney Jerome's sevenpiece band. The 1935 demonstration featured typical production numbers and popular songs associated with Tin Pan Alley, Broadway theater, and Hollywood films such as \"Rock and Roll,\" \"Zing Went the Strings of My Heart,\" \"Sady O'Grady,\" \"Forty-Second Street,\" \"Sidewalks of Cuba,\" \"Here Comes That Rainbow,\" 'Tm on the Crest of a Wave,\" \"When Love Comes Swinging Along,\" \"Limehouse Blues,\" \"Old Folks at Home,\" \"It's an Old Southern Custom,\" \"The Man from Harlem,\" \"Mood Indigo,\" and the aforementioned \"Lullaby of Broadway.\" Though no visual record remains of this television experiment, the script reveals several key production considerations with a pronounced reliance on established theatrical and cinematic performance conventions encompassing repertoire, staging, and (to lesser extent) interstitial dialogue. The show's loosely structured narrative and musical performances portrayed ersatz versions of various New York City locales in all of their cultural and spatial diversity: Broadway, China Town, Harlem, and the swank Rainbow Room nightclub (which had opened less than a year earlier on the sixty-fifth floor of the GE Building at Rockefeller Center, where the NBC corporate headquarters are also housed). Interestingly, the influence of radio is entirely absent in the discussion; the production logic was anchored in visual performance styles that immersed audience members in a fantasy spectacle, promising a generally pleasant experience while virtually \"transporting\" them MUSIC, IMAGE, LABOR\n\n*\n\n25\n\nto other cultural locales. The TV demonstration also harbored latent simi-\n\nlarities with filmed travelogues that displayed exciting or exotic Otherness cohering within recognized cultural sites. We can see here that the aesthetic push-and-pull between the existing communication media and various performance sites and forms was not yet resolved, and TV'S early experimental process explored the potentialities of each option for future musical productions. Script notes explain the character of the studio set designs for each musical number, describing the construction of ersatz urban spaces and props that reflect the highly staged aspect of the broadcast production. Offering basic stage directions with cast entrances and exits, the script also illustrates how, even in 1935, there was careful forethought about television's onscreen action, camera placement, and shot composition, and the communication of presentational intimacy forged in the dynamics between musical talent and the camera. Simultaneity, immediacy, and a sense of presence were as crucial to early television as they were to theater. Lynn Spigel addresses these representational issues and television's distinguishing characteristics with the observation, Television, it was constantly argued, would be a better approximation of live entertainment than any previous form of technological reproduction. Its ability to broadcast direct to the home would allow people to feel as if they really were at the theater.... According to the popular wisdom, then, television was able to reproduce reality in a way no previous medium could. Whereas film allowed spectators imaginatively to project themselves into a scene, television would give people the sense of being on the scene of presentation - it would simulate the entire experience of being at the theater. (1992: 138-39) Proximity, intimacy, liveness, and an ideal perspective or \"perfect view\" (ibid.: 140) that privileged the audience member were important features of early\n\nTV\n\nbroadcasting even as the medium experienced programming and\n\ntechnical modifications. Although television had yet to fully mature, by 1935 the conceptual framework and representational principles that eventually came to dominate were already discernible and many of the general qualities inscribed in this early \"TV laboratory\" trial remained more or less intact when television was finally introduced on a massive commercial scale at the end of the 1940s. Though the Camden experiment stands out for its detail and complexity, 26\n\n*\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nThe Pickens Sisters. NBC radio, circa mid-1930S. COURTESY OF PHOTOFEST.\n\nsimilar experiments involving popular music performances continued throughout the 1930S. In 1936, the television pioneer Philo T. Farnsworth hired the Nick Ross Orchestra to appear on his self-operated experimental station w3XPF in Philadelphia, where he also featured preadolescent amateurs in televised song and dance routines (Fisher and Fisher 1996: 253). Also in 1936, NBC introduced musical artists including the popular radio trio the Pickens Sisters in a promotional demonstration that was narrowly beamed to televisions viewed by invited network insiders, advertising executives, and select members of the press corps. Later that year, a further demonstration was conducted for the press under what NBC and RCA jointly termed \"practical working conditions .... It represented the first showing of a complete program built for entertainment value as well as a demonstration of transmission\" (\"Television Developments\" 1936). The network's explicit announcement of \"practical working conditions\" implies that this was more than a simple experiment, rather, something akin to a product roll-out; its purpose was not merely to titillate reporters with a vision of what TV broadcasting may one day be but was a much more grounded presentation asserting what TV is. In terms of corpoMUSIC, IMAGE, LABOR\n\n*\n\n27\n\nrate expediency the demonstration was also an attempt to make good on the promotional promises that had accumulated over the previous several years while serving notice to the competition that NBC was ahead of the pack. Music again figured prominently and the demonstration featured performances by The Inkspots and Hildegarde, a likable if unremarkable chanteuse whose in-house moniker was \"The Television Girl\" on account of her telegenic qualities and frequent participation in NBC'S early experiments. A young Frank Sinatra, recognized as an emerging star during his tenure with the Harry James Orchestra (and soon to join forces with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra), was invited to participate in NBC'S experimental\n\nTV\n\nbroadcasts in 1939, but he demurred. Broadcast experiments continued without Sinatra in NBC'S cramped and overheated studio 3H in midtown Manhattan, with Dinah Shore singing for the closed circuit system well before she reached full blossom as a top recording, film, and television star (\"Dinah in Blackface\" 1949; Ritchie 1994; Kisseloff 1995: 56). At the DuMont studios, the program host Dennis James (a former radio disk jockey with WNEW in New York who went on to define the role of the TV host) was also tentatively exploring the new medium with a fledgling show called Television Roof in 1939. The show featured the vocal group The Pied Pipers, which included Jo Stafford (Kisseloff 1995: 68). In these instances musicians served a primarily functional role since their performances fulfilled the network's demonstration objectives yet demanded minimal scripts or none at all, making them a cheap and effective solution to the medium's content dilemma. Demonstrational presentations at this stage featured popular songs as a rule, not as an exception, and in so doing they primed the public for a visual medium that included popular music as a vital component. Music's central significance in television development continued when NBC made its grand-and ultimately premature-announcement of regular television programming at the 1939 New York World's Fair (the subsequent broadcasts originated from station W2XBS in mid-town Manhattan). The company introduced the famed Broadway composer Richard Rogers (accompanying the theater singer Mary Wescott on piano), as well as Fred Waring and his Pennsylvanians, broadcasting their well-known dance band selections to those on the fairgrounds and to the roughly 250 television households in the New York area; according to NBC'S estimates, this number eventually climbed to roughly 2,000 set owners by the end of the year (\"RCA and NBC\" 1940).The World's Fair broadcasts were proudly touted as the official launch of NBC'S television division, although critics at the time 28\n\n*\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nwere divided on the achievement: on the one hand there was much excitement and anticipation about the prospect of regular TV entertainment, but on the other hand reporters were generally unimpressed, commenting in exquisite detail about the abysmal quality of the broadcast performances. In retrospect it was perhaps providential that television's progress was interrupted by the outbreak of war in the early 1940S since the public was not yet fully convinced about TV's value and there was much room for improvement. James Von Schilling (2003) explains how the cost of television sets (around $500) duting the 1939 Fair remained prohibitive for many families. Putchasing a TV set was not a priority when fine musical entertainment could be had for free over cheaper radio sets or, for a reasonable cost, at public theaters and nightclubs. Phonograph players and records, too, were both less expensive and already established as a consumer item. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) also voiced concern that consumers would be enticed to spend on televisions before the technology or the programming reached a standard of acceptability. Though the cost of TV sets was sharply reduced as part of an aggressive marketing campaign, the content still did not justify the expense; according to Richard Koszarski, \"The public expected value for money\" (2008: 465). With the buildup to the war, more urgent issues beset all the major players in television development, including the TV set manufacturers, the networks, and the government's policy makers. Philip Auslander writes of this period: \"The first television era in the United States ... occurred between 1939 and 1945, for although programming and the industrial development of television were truncated by the war effort, the discourse on television remained lively during the war years\" (1999: 14). Auslander's assessment is generally accurate; broadcasting experiments and demonstrations involving popular music performances did not completely halt during the war years even though the mission and priorities at the networks were seriously altered. Both CBS and NBC briefly suspended their operations in 1942, yet the General Electric srudio in Schenectady, New York, and the fledgling DuMont network continued their studio experiments. In fact, television's technical development was assisted by various spin-off benefits from electronic engineering and scientific research oriented toward the war effort. While the greatest progress during the war was in the technical realm, production and programming work also advanced, albeit within a reduced scope and with lesser aspirations. Photographs published between 1944 and 1945 in the DuMont corporaMUSIC, IMAGE, LABOR\n\n*\n\n29\n\ntion's monthly newsletter The Raster depict musical artists in the network's New York television studio working on performance and broadcast productions while the war raged. The musicians represent a remarkable range of gentes, including the celebrity bandleader Waring accompanied by members of his Glee Club vocal group, the\" negro\" folk singer Josh White, Margaret Johnson (wearing a cowboy hat, singing the western classic \"Don't Fence Me In\"), and two unnamed Latin music trios. James Von Schilling also cites a 1944 NBC broadcast featuring the wide-eyed song-and-dance man Eddie Cantor, who encountered the first documented case of network censorship while performing \"We're Having a Baby, My Baby and Me\" that featured arguably suggestive lyrics (Von Schilling 2003: 53). As these examples illustrate, popular music was central in television's ongoing (and very local) broadcast trials while the nation was at war, even though the music industry and many of the top orchestras of the period were rent apart by enlistment, fuel rationing, and other constraints. The diversity of acts appearing on television through the war years, spanning a musical and cultural spectrum, defies the still relatively common notion that early television was relentlessly homogeneous. The fact that televised musical performances cleaved toward mainstream, middlebrow tastes (Mundy 1999) is not to say that the broadcasts were uniform in their musical content or performance aesthetics. In many ways, television was more consistently varied in its formative phase than it was in later decades. Television producers who were still toiling to perfect the medium tapped into an assortment of musical forms representing an array of cultural sensibilities and ethnic or racial backgrounds. These industry architects were intent on honing their facility with different music and performance styles in the quest to introduce a broad range of musical performances to the slowly growing ranks of television viewers.\n\nAesthetic Ideals and Critical Predictions\n\nCiting television's promise and predicting its positive cultural influence during the war years, Robert Lee wrote in 1944, \"Everybody should know about television, because it's going to be 'everybody's art.' Television belongs to the people - more than motion pictures, or even radio. There isn't one person in the United States who won't be affected by television\" (1944: 6). Lee's optimism was rooted in what he believed were television's democratic and artistic potentials as a medium (following the rhetoric of TV's more ardent 30\n\n*\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\npromoters), although history reveals that, apart from his final remark, his views were rather naive. In his assessment and predictions specifically about music, Lee curiously undermined\n\ndistinguishing visual element, stressing that the images\n\nTV'S\n\nshould remain secondary\n\nto\n\nthe aural experience of any televised musical\n\nperformance. His comments reflect an outlook that was likely influenced by the prevailing modes of reception and audience listening demeanor at classical music concerts or the comfort and familiarity associated with electrical home entertainment appliances: \"In presenting music, the sight channel must always be the hand-maiden to sound. When the video screen cannot conceivably add anything to a musical effect, producers must have the courage\n\nto\n\nleave it blank. This is true of much of the world's music. As a matter\n\nof fact, most great music can be best enjoyed in darkness; any activity on the screen would be distracting\" (ibid.: 10). As Lee envisioned it, capable musicians would be called upon\n\nto\n\nperform in their standard manner, but it was,\n\nin his opinion, improperly left and technicians\n\nto\n\nto\n\nthe television producers, camera crews,\n\ncoax and shape the performance's compelling elements\n\naccording to the medium's visual capacity. The studio experiments up to this point showed that musicians' expertise and talent were overwhelmed by the comparatively inexperienced and clumsy efforts of the TV production units. Despite his enthusiasm and support for the primacy of the musical performance, Lee's particular misgivings were soon realized: the visual regime of television proved\n\nto\n\nbe a formidable force and music's aural qualities were\n\nregularly subordinated\n\nto\n\nthe scopic pleasures offered by handsome male\n\nand beguiling female performers or to the spectacular production numbers that quickly became television staples. Lee's perspective also seemed\n\nto\n\nrely on\n\nTV\n\nsounds being of accept-\n\nable, if not necessarily pristine quality, yet the poor-to-mediocre sound of most early television sets (roughly on par with those of the average midprice radio receiver) conspired with the low-resolution images of the tiny screens to produce what were reported to be a less-than-rewarding audience experience (VanCour 2011). Whereas the voice carried reasonably well in early television's dramatic performances (depending on proper microphone placement and related staging aspects) or on sports broadcasts under normal circumstances, musical performances, especially those involving multiinstrumental arrangements and nuanced orchestral presentations, were poorly served. Lee was more accurate, however, in his predictions when he noted, \"Top MUSIC, IMAGE, LABOR\n\n*\n\n31\n\nname-bands - especially when enhanced by interesting camera-handlingare especially adaptable: the solid showmanship of Fred Waring's Pennsylvanians; leaders with singularly visual personalities, such as Kay Kyser and Cab Calloway; or Xavier Cugat, whose talents as a cartoonist can add a whimsical touch to his telecasts of South American melodies\" (ibid.: 107). Lee identifies specific musicians whose performance skills and spectacular excesses were already well-established facets of their performance aesthetic, lending them additional cachet as the new industry sought feasible talentas-content. Each of the musicians Lee mentions did, in fact, go on to active television careers as invited guests or as program hosts. Of those listed, it was the comparatively subdued Waring (who had already performed in front of TV cameras and under the blazing hot studio lights in prewar and wartime\n\nexperimental broadcasts with\n\nNBC\n\nand Du Mont) who would enjoy the\n\ngreatest success, eventually hosting his own show featuring a sixty-member musical agglomeration on CBS from 1949 to 1954 and again, briefly, in 1957. Anticipating enhanced artistic innovation in the combination of music and images, several commentators in the 1940S focused on the promising experiments in synaesthesia (a condition whereby the senses are involuntarily stimulated by a single catalyst; for example, one may experience an overwhelming sensation of visual shape and color while hearing a musical passage). Kay Dickinson defines the condition as \"the transportation of sensory images from one modality into another. Synaesthetes claim the ability to see music (usually in terms of color) or to taste shapes, with the former being the most common of its manifestations and the most pertinent to the study of music video\" (2007: 14). Animators and other visual artists (Thomas Wilfred or Oskar Fischinger among them) 3 attempted to merge the sensory experiences of sound and sight, creating free-form nonnarrative films involving abstract electronic images that throb and glow in varying intensities, matching transitions in the musical arrangements. Robert Lee also described such possibilities for television, referring in 1944 to the mechanical \"image-organ\" -consisting of a cyclorama \"upon which appears a kaleidoscopic whirling of patterns and shadows in cadence with the music\" (1944: 109). Seeking a different model for TV emulation, Mildred Steffens (1945) identified Fantasia, Walt Disney's animated film released in 1940, as an ideal example of tasteful, artistic musical presentation. She suggested that television's visual artists might create animated accompaniment\n\nala Disney or\n\ndesign abstract and symbolic light and image renderings of classical music 32\n\n*\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nperformances for television broadcast. Steffens's references\n\nto\n\n\"optical ac-\n\ncompaniment\" were not, however, entirely accommodating of \"popular\" music; instead, she framed her preferences within a discourse of musical aesthetics and quality that unambiguously favored classical music. Steffens explained, \"When television promotion again goes forward following 'V' day, a maturer, more thoughtful public will demand serious programs of good variety. And it will insist upon music - 'good' music .... Although we are limiting ourselves here to a discussion of good music, even 'swing' can be visualized with tremendous effect\" (1945: 9). It is worth emphasizing that, like Lee, Steffens regarded musical instrumentation as the dominant element, with TV'S visual effects accentuating or otherwise reinforcing the arrangement in a secondary role. Addressing the artistic creation of what he termed \"audivisual music,\" Ralph Potter also cited the brilliance of Disney's Fantasia, although his interests at the time lay within the wartime development of electronic rather than mechanical technologies, including light response mechanisms such as \"the sound spectograph\" that \"picture musical notes in action ... with visuals accompanying sound in unison\" (1947: 74). Praise for Fantasia, with its soaring classical soundtrack, was widespread in this period, and if there were any doubts about the high-art pretensions of Disney's animated extravaganza, these were allayed by the film's narrative voice, provided by Deems Taylor, the composer, music critic, and first radio announcer of the New York Metropolitan Opera's radio broadcasts (in 1931, on NBC), who added experience and gravitas to the film's renderings of familiar symphonic compositions (Pegolotti 2003: 188-90).\n\nIt is striking that, while music is the chief interest in these assessments and proposals, there is little effort to address the portrayal of actual musical performances. The musicians are relegated to the background or, worse, they are merely assigned to the soundtrack while the image-music correlation is achieved via technical or graphic means. Notwithstanding these predictions and appraisals for the visualization of music, the television networks showed little inclination to adopt them or to reproduce Fantasia's animated style for the small screen. The home television, it was suggested, would eventually provide an entertaining visual appliance that either augmented or surpassed the basic aural experience oflistening to radio broadcasts or phonograph recordings. There were also occasional debates about the hierarchy of the human senses, displaying a prevailing set of social values and a latent belief that sight is of a MUSIC, IMAGE, LABOR\n\n*\n\n33\n\nhigher sensual rank than hearing. In the music trade magazine Billboard this visual privileging produced the interesting term \"em-see\" (instead of Me or emcee) to describe television program hosts, with the term \"fem-see\" applying to female show hosts. Through the postwar years, expert predictions, industry proclamations, and media speculation about television accelerated, with many touting the medium as a logical and welcome cultutal achievement or an avatar of progress, in the process fanning the flames of public anticipation for television's new pleasures. Another set of descriptions at the time compared television to public (or nondomestic) entertainment contexts, most frequently relating television entertainment to existing options of the cultural arena, notably the cinema or performances in theaters or nightclubs. This comparison implicitly acknowledged that these leisure pastimes had achieved ritual status within American culture and were, thus, a standard aspect of everyday life for many Americans. Cast in this light, television's most aggressive promoters (including network executives and television set manufacturers) sought to discursively normalize television, aligning it with typical entertainment interests and leisure patterns. Viewers were promised \"the best seat in the house\" (reinforcing ideals of individualized reception), or else audiences were assured that the medium would deliver quality entertainment in the style and form of familiar musical showcases while freeing them from the cost and effort of attending actual public events. In the midst of this promotional phase it seems that few people asked the question whether American entertainment was such a priority or if people sought or demanded alternative leisure options. That they did was a largely unchallenged assumption on the part of broadcasting and advertising industries. Indeed, this underlying assumption has been maintained throughout the years since television's introduction and continues to inform the development of many subsequent leisure and entertainment commodities. While prevailing attitudes invoked the element of convenience, television's development was also explained as a matter of rational economics as the\n\nTV\n\nindustry's executive deliberations and public promotional strategies\n\noften framed a TV set purchase as a one-time financial outlay for years and years of home-based entertainment. As one early advertising campaign declared, television was \"the greatest free show on earth!\" although, by 1953, this same phrase was cynically employed in variety as the industry lamented the rising costs of TV talent and the rapidly increased expense of produc34\n\n*\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\ning musical programs (Rosen 1953: 1). Such claims for TV'S contributions to leisure and entertainment were initially a matter of faith since the early programming schedule did not offer much upon which to form an opinion and what did exist was, as many reviews of the day indicated, of dubious quality. The\n\nTV\n\nset manufacturers and networks promised potential consumers\n\nand audiences that television would eventually flourish, although the promises had been forthcoming for over a decade and the medium still remained far beneath the praises heaped upon it. Cultural critics and industry watchdogs reported on each new development and innovation, providing considerable publicity for the burgeoning medium yet granting no quarter to the industry when the actual product lagged so far behind the promotional hype. Slow TV set sales were a major concern for the industry, especially as manufacturers repeatedly fell short of their sales projections and sweated over the corporate costs and the pressure from increasingly impatient investors and shareholders (Baughman 2007). Over time, as the television networks established a track record by offering increased programming (including a shift away from remote broadcasts of sports events or simple roundtable discussions featuring various \"experts,\" community leaders, or authorities) and demonstrating a new production savvy, they could point to their mounting achievements as proof that the medium was indeed able to provide solid musical entertainment and, thus, offer value to viewers. By the end of the war, television was far more than \"an eccentric idea offered by a few esoteric inventors\" as William Chafe (1986) and Constance\n\nHill (2000) each claim. After almost twenty years of development and continual technical improvement, it was about to erupt as a full-fledged industrial sector. While there remained substantial doubts about how television might fare, the corporate broadcast networks and\n\nTV\n\nset manufacturers\n\nwere gearing up for a concentrated thrust into the market. Given the sheer scale of the industry buildup, there was little to suggest that this was simply an \"eccentric idea\" but, rather, a major incursion into American business and cultutallife. With greater technological consistency and production reliability in the late 1940s, television programming and content issues were prioritized. The specific question of musical presentation rose as a regular topic, spilling into the entertainment trade papers such as Billboard, Down Beat, Metronome, and variety. The popular press also weighed in on television's programming developments, and reporters such as John Crosby at the New York Herald Tribune and Jack Gould of the New York Times, among others, soon emerged as important monitors of the rising television indusMUSIC, IMAGE, LABOR\n\n*\n\n35\n\ntry, providing astute analysis of policies and technical developments as well as offering keen criticism of TV'S musical content.\n\nAmerican Federation of Musicians and James C. Petrillo\n\nDuring the Depression and the war years, American laborers found solace and support among unions and the steady rise of both union organizing and membership inexorably influenced the country's economic and social character. In this period the American Federation of Musicians (AF M) effectively secured standard wage scales and employee protection for professional musicians, but the changing patterns of radio broadcasting, jukebox production, and phonograph recording in the 1930S and 1940S intensified the AFM'S role and enhanced its status. Throughout the 1940s, the AFM, under the fiery leadership of its president, James C. Petrillo (who took over the union presidency in 1940), confronted a complex scenario in which musical styles, audience tastes, and commercial demand each underwent substantial change. The influences of war presented several serious challenges\n\nto\n\nmusicians and to their union;\n\nafter the war, the union played a pivotal role in the concurrent evolution of popular music and television as the union battled with the recording, radio broadcast, and television industries. The AFM had always remained attuned\n\nto\n\ndevelopments across the entertainment and broadcast indus-\n\ntries and Petrillo was cognizant of television's significance and its potential consequences for the nation's musicians, especially after NBC'S 1939 New York World's Fair debut when the network's premiere broadcasts prominently featured musical performances. Although the union set a preliminary television wage scale as early as 1943, signing a contract with the emerging networks that permitted union musicians to perform on TV programs, the arrangement proved to be premature since television was insufficiently evolved at the time and the war's effects constituted a barrier to its development.
