        "text": "This article sets out a framework for understanding two key issues in the history of early modern and modern South Asia. First, it addresses the vexed question of the generaliz- ability of the “Western” concept of property to Indo-Islamicate land systems. Rather than beginning from the idea of ‘Islamic property law/relations’ it proposes that we reconstruct concepts relating to the control of the earth’s material substrate in terms of four modes of idiomizing land in the Islamicate tradition. In light of how the latter reconstruction suggests that (Indo-)Islamicate modes of idiomization focused on the produce of land more than land itself, the article then turns to a second issue. This concerns the similarities and differences between the deontic cultures of rights and responsibilities that characterized early modern polities (both in Mughal India and England) and nineteenth-century ones (like metropolitan Britain’s and that emerging from the East India Company’s so-called rule of property in the subcontinent).\n\nThe concept of property has been deployed in such specific ways in Western political philosophy, law, and economics that some anthropologists question its usefulness for comparative analysis. This article argues for its retention and the continued investigation of both 'real' and intangible property relations. Anthropological approaches challenge abstract models by exploring the sociocultural contexts in which property objects are held and exchanged, including the ways in which legal rights mesh with relations of power. In the era of neoliberal capitalism, anthropologists also need to reengage with world history and connect the specific claims of property to wider frameworks of citizenship.\n\nCaste analysis could be done within the framework of the \"property\" inquiry, as the land and caste are intertwined themes in Indian culture. The way that the dominant caste communities allocate their resources-land and caste-allows them to directly control the systems of political, social, cultural, and economic dominance. In the Indian context, the discourse surrounding property must be understood in conjunction with the two crucially important but interrelated concepts of land and caste. In actuality, land is both a sociological phenomenon and merely a spatial category. Indian society's hierarchical structure reflects the uneven distribution of land among the various caste groups. Having land as a resource puts a caste member in a position of easy power over others. As a result, the caste of landless people suffers more from society's lack of property ownership.\n\nScholars have long debated the impact of the British ‘rule of property’ on India. In our own day it has become common for historians to hold that the Raj's would-be regime of free capitalist property was frustrated by a pervasive divide between rhetoric and reality which derived from a fundamental lack of fit between English ideas and Indian land control practices. While seemingly novel, the contemporary emphasis on the theory-practice divide is rooted in an earlier ‘revisionist’ perspective among late-nineteenth-century colonial thinkers who argued that land control in the subcontinent derived from a uniquely Indian species of ‘proprietary’ (rather than genuinely propertied) right-holding. In this article, I critically examine the revisionist discourse of ‘proprietary right’ by situating it in a broader comparative perspective, both relative to earlier ideas about rendering property ‘absolute’ during the East India Company's rule and relative to the changing conception of the property right among legal thinkers in the central domains of the Anglo-common law world. In so doing, the article significantly revises our understanding of the relationship between property, law, and political economy in the subcontinent from the late eighteenth to the late nineteenth century.\n\nThe question of land acquisition in India hinges on the nature of land as property, the nature of collective land rights, the nature of individual property rights on land and the nature of the state as expropriator for specific collectivities or benefactor for public good. Defining public use or common good has historically been one of the more protracted contestations between the state and individual/ communal ownership of land. Rule-making for acquisition of land and appropriate compensation marks a second contestation, between 'law' and 'justice', as evidenced both in the colonial law of 1894, and subsequent amendments and legal enactments after independence. Focusing on two of the most crucial aspects of land acquisition law-ownership and consent, and compensation against acquisition-this article explores how the idea of public good for common purpose has been historically constituted within legislative and juridical frameworks, and how the notion of compensation is closely connected to the contested definition of public good and the definition of 'community rights'. In probing these issues, I seek to arrive at an understanding of the implications of reciprocal rights and obligations that mutually constitute society and state in India.\n\nThis article looks at the recent scholarship on urban property in colonial India. Histories of cities of British India have been dominated by issues of racial segregation, discourse of planning, ways of social control as well as negotiation and resistance of the indigenous population in fashioning the urban space. The new scholarship brings in economic considerations of the state and the private actors squarely to the foreground to argue that land and property was at the heart of urban governance. Putting forward a materialist interpretation of the production of colonial urban space, these histories provide a lens to view the complex and complicated processes through which land turned into commodity. The article discusses three major issues relating to urban property regime as have been argued variously in these writings: first, it looks at the very constitution of the meaning of property and rights to property; second, it studies the various meanings of ‘value’ of a land; and lastly, it considers the question of workings of the property market in relation to housing and rent. The readings suggest that specific political, socio-economic, and ecological context of each city shaped much of the deliberations and responses to the emergence and consolidation of a property regime.\n\nThe discourse around indigeneity, customary rights of possession and claims to political autonomy in Northeast India conventionally traces the postcolonial protectionist legislation for 'tribes' to various acts passed under the late colonial state, the most significant precursor being seen as the Government of India Act, 1935. This article will argue that one can in fact trace the 'original moment' in the idea of customary law for 'tribes' much further back in history, to the early decades of the nineteenth century. This historical moment was anchored in the beginnings of the East India Company's conquest of the Garo hills in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, in the appropriation of the land and revenue of the Garos and in the ethnogenesis of the 'hill Garo'. The article will explore the ways in which the beginning of the invention of customary law and traditional authority in Northeast India under East India Company rule was impelled by the Company's demands for revenue and was shielded and secured by the deployment of military power across the hills. Over the course of the nineteenth century, the strategies of imperial control first introduced in the region were reproduced across the rest of Northeast India, underscoring the significance of the Garo hills as the first 'laboratory' of colonial rule in the region as well as sharpening our understanding of the character of the early colonial state. The article thus takes as its task the historicization of the categories of 'customary law', 'traditional/indigenous authority' and the 'hill tribe', all of which form the basis of late colonial and postcolonial legislation on the 'tribe'."
