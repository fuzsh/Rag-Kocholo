        "text": "This study evaluates the link between the occurrence of El Nino events in East Africa and water hyacinth blooms in Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria using remote sensing technology. A time-series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analyzed from data acquired by the multispectral Aqua/Terra sensors aboard the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite are used to monitor areal extent and density of the aquatic plants. We related the NDVI derived from MODIS imagery to data on El Niño South Oscillation (ENSO) events that were obtained from NOAA and rainfall data from the study site. Our results from the 11-year time-series data show a statistically significant positive correlation (R = 0.6, P = 0.021) between the occurrence of El Niño events and water hyacinth blooms in Winam Gulf. The proliferation of water hyacinth rafts in Winam Gulf may be a response to dramatic environmental and water quality changes in Lake Victoria. The patterns of impact of ENSO events and rainfall show spatial and temporal variation patterns in the region, depending on the time and space evolution of each individual ENSO event that could explain the differences in general patterns of water hyacinth cover in Lake Victoria during different El Niño events. Although the problems eutrophication and water hyacinth are severe in the Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria some of the solutions to the problem are located several hundreds of kilometers away in the rich agricultural farmlands of the Lake Victoria catchment area. These include better land management practices and strategies aimed at limiting pollution and soil erosion within the lake’s drainage basin.\n\nOur principal goal is to develop better, more far-looking tools to predict the cumulative effects of resource development, climate-change, and traditional land use. Here we use remote sensing, climate-change analyses, socio-economic analyses, and vegetation-change models to examine the cumulative effects of climate change, gas development, and reindeer herding on the Yamal Peninsula in northwest Siberia as part of the Northern Eurasia Earth Science Partnership Initiative (NEESPI). We find: 1. Direct (planned) impacts of industrial activities on the Yamal Peninsula are currently local and limited in extent, but this is changing rapidly as extensive gas fields are developed and land and sea transportation corridors are developed to get the gas to market. Indirect impacts of the development at Bovanenkovo, the largest gas field, exceed the direct impacts by a factor of three, and the total area of influence of the development on the reindeer pasturelands (e.g., area where migration routes and access to pasturelands is affected) exceeds the direct impacts by a factor of about 40. 2. The trend in land-surface temperatures has co-varied with the trend in sea-ice. Low sea ice in the preceding December-March period is correlated to warmer land temperature the following summer. The sea- ice trends in the Kara Sea-Yamal region are tied to variation in the North Atlantic Oscillation index. 4. Only a small greening response to warming has been detected on the Yamal in comparison with some other areas in the Arctic (e.g. Northern Alaska). The actual effects of climate-change on vegetation are currently hard to document at the ground level because of lack of baseline and long-term ground observations and difficulty of excluding reindeer in these studies. 5. There is high potential for extensive landscape effects due to unstable sandy soils, and extremely ice-rich permafrost near the surface on slopes. 6. Two different vegetation modeling approaches are being used to predict future response of the vegetation The BIOME4 model projects that the boreal forest extent will increase by 55 percent and that the arctic tundra extent will decrease by 42 percent, with a 60 percent loss of prostrate dwarf-shrub tundra. The ArcVeg model projects that with a 2 degree C increase in the mean July temperature over a 200-year period total biomass will increase by up to 100 percent in both the Low and High Arctic. The largest responses are with the woody plants, but these followed the more rapid response of other plant growth forms (graminods, forbs, mosses, and lichens). The major accomplishments of the group of researchers involved in the project were summarized in 21 talks given at the 2008 Yamal LCLUC Workshop in Moscow, 28-30 Jan 2008 and in talks and posters at the 2008 NASA LCLUC Conference.\n\nThe detection of the spatio-temporal extent of inundation resulting from the floods in 2004 and 2007 in Bangladesh has been studied using time-series MODIS surface reflectance data. Flood inundation maps were developed from vegetation and land water surface indices derived using surface reflectance. The inundation map developed using MODIS data was compared with a corresponding RADARSAT image, where both images refer to the satellite-based remote-sensing data. The estimates show a strong correlation with the inundation area derived from the RADARSAT products (coefficient of determination of R2: 0.96). The paper shows that it is possible to study flood dynamics by assessing inundation and recession patterns and to perform flood assessments similar to the high-resolution (50 m) microwave satellite, RADARSAT-based flood assessments using products derived from MODIS 500 m imagery. MODIS has advantages over microwave satellite because it has a high observational frequency and these data are available free of cost. We have concluded that this is a useful method to assess the extent of the temporal floods in the People's Republic of Bangladesh."
