        "text": "The Montgomery County Department of Finance (240-777-8860), located at 27 Courthouse Square, Suite 221, Rockville, MD 20850, transfers all deeds.\n\nAll deeds with agricultural use and partial transfers must go through the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation, located at 30 West Gude Drive, Suite 400, Rockville, MD 20850. They can be reached via phone at 240-314-4510 for residential properties and 240-314-4530 for commercial properties.\n\nAny deed or document that affects a change of ownership must be accompanied by: (1) a completed Intake Sheet; (2) a copy of the deed for submission to the Department of Assessments and Taxation; and (3) an affidavit of residency and/or a Maryland Form MW 506 NRS, for non-resident sale of property. You may obtain information on the affidavit of residency and/or a Maryland Form MW 506 NRS by calling 1-800-MDTAXES or from the Maryland Comptroller’s website.\n\nThe deed must have a Certification of Preparation. The attorney who prepared the document or one of the parties named in the instrument must sign the Certificate.\n\nThe grantors (sellers) must sign the deed, which should be acknowledged before a Notary Public.\n\nThe parcel ID# must be typed or printed on the deed. The parcel ID# is located in the upper right corner of your tax bill. It would be the same as your account number.\n\nDeeds can be submitted to the County Department of Finance electronically, but they will have to be provided to the Circuit Court in paper form.\n\nRecording fees can be paid by cash or check, not credit cards.\n\nThere is a recording fee of $20 for any deed 9 pages or less in length if it involves solely a principal residence. The fee for any other deed, 10 pages or more in length, is $75.\n\nThere is a $40 surcharge for all documents except Notice of Sales, Power of Attorney, Assumption Agreements, and Transfer of Development Rights.\n\nState transfer taxes are figured at ½ of 1 % (.005) of the consideration amount. State transfer taxes are collected only on deeds and leases.\n\nThere is a .25% state transfer tax rate for first-time Maryland homebuyers purchasing a principal place of residence. If there are multiple grantees on the deed, all must be either first-time Maryland homebuyers acquiring their principal residence or persons joined in the deed and purchase money mortgage/deed of trust as co-makers or guarantors. To qualify for this exemption, each grantee must provide a statement under oath, signed by the grantee, stating that the grantee is a first-time Maryland homebuyer who will occupy the residence as a principal residence, or is a co-maker or guarantor of the purchase money mortgage/deed of trust who will not occupy the residence as a principal residence.\n\nA statement of the amount of the actual consideration to be paid, if any, including the amount of any mortgage or deed of trust assumed by the grantee, shall either be included in every taxable instrument offered for record as part of its recitals or as part of the acknowledgment, or be contained in a separate affidavit accompanying the instrument. The affidavit is to be signed under the penalties of perjury by a party to the instrument or the agent of such party.\n\nIf you have any legal questions, please contact an attorney.\n\nRelease (lien removal) 9 pages or less in length: $10\n\nNotice of sale: $15\n\nPower of attorney: $20\n\nAny other document 9 pages or less in length or any document over nine 9 pages in length if it involves solely a principal residence: $20\n\nAny other document 10 pages or more in length: $75"
