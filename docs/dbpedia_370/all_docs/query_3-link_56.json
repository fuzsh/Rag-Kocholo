        "text": "Before addressing details, a land trust should examine and clarify its own philosophy or approach to recordkeeping. That approach will then govern specific procedures. For example, one land trust may choose to focus on potential litigation and state that one of the purposes of its records policy is to “create and maintain records in anticipation of litigation.” A land trust with this approach may focus on the formalities of complying with the business records rule.\n\nAnother land trust may identify its purpose is to “collect and keep the minimum amount of information necessary to prepare required reports and meet internal problem-solving needs.” This land trust may rely more on electronic databases than extensive paper files. It may be willing to accept the consequences of not having as complete a file as another land trust might maintain.\n\nThe philosophy or recordkeeping approach identified in a land trust’s records policy determines what material to keep and how. Not only will different land trusts have different approaches to recordkeeping, different philosophies or approaches may apply to different types of land trust records. For example, property records may require a different process or system of recordkeeping than programmatic records.\n\nOriginal documents must be protected from daily use and reasonably secure from fire, flood and tampering by individuals. When determining where to store original files, land trusts need to ask themselves a number of key questions. What are the risks of loss, destruction or unauthorized access, and what are the consequences? Fire? Theft? Flood? Malicious mischief? Other? What can we do to limit the likelihood of loss? What will happen if we lose certain data? The list of threats may seem endless, but for each land trust, some will be more likely than others. For example, a land trust using a storage facility with lots of sprinklers may be more concerned about water damage than fire. An urban office may have a greater risk of unauthorized entry, and additional physical security may be necessary.\n\nA land trust’s records policy (see Practice 9G1 above) will guide overall records retention and storage, including which documents a land trust considers part of the permanent record for a transaction. Land trusts use several approaches for safe storage of records, including:\n\nFireproof file cabinet or safe in another location. Some land trusts keep their permanent files in a fireproof cabinet or safe in a separate location, such as an attorney’s office or town hall. If originals are stored in another location, the land trust must have control over the retention of these documents. If they are stored in a private home (such as of a board member of a small, all-volunteer land trust) the land trust should secure a written agreement with the homeowner that guarantees that other representatives of the organization (such as officers or key employees) can access the records.\n\nSafe deposit box. Other land trusts choose to keep their files in a bank safe deposit box.\n\nFormal archive facility. Several land trusts choose the convenience and safety of a formal archival facility.\n\nRegistry of deeds. Originals of property deeds, conservation easements, surveys and sometimes baseline documentation, may be kept at the county or municipal register.\n\nDigital systems. Land trusts increasingly digitize information and documents. They also use a variety of systems to protect that data, including off-site storage of discs or backup data and online backup systems.\n\nAt a minimum, these locations must protect the originals from daily use and be reasonably secure from fire, floods or other foreseeable hazards.\n\nFor accreditation, a land trust must keep originals (electronic or paper) secure (such as in a locked cabinet with limited access or in an archive facility with permission needed for access) and protected from damage or loss (such as in a fireproof safe, bank vault or archive facility with sprinklers).\n\nA land trust must store copies in locations that could not be destroyed in a single calamity (such as paper originals and duplicates stored in separate locations or electronic duplicates backed up on a remote server or on the cloud).\n\nMany land trusts now use both paper files and electronic systems to manage and maintain project data; each has its own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nComputer-based systems provide for relatively easy access (even from remote locations) and can easily accommodate changing or updating files and data. They also require consistent, rigid protocols for greatest efficiencies and credibility. What is easily created can also be easily lost. While creating an entire system can seem overwhelming and expensive, there are relatively inexpensive off-the-shelf products available. Keep in mind that if the land trust stores its originals in an electronic format, the originals must meet the requirements of applicable federal and state law with respect to rules of evidence regarding electronic originals. They must also be replicas of signed originals and include all exhibits and attachments in a format that cannot be altered. Some land trusts maintain their electronic originals in a PDF format that is more difficult to alter than those stored as word processing documents. Safeguards for ensuring the originals do not get erased or written over include using non-rewritable discs and limiting access to cloud-based original records as read only or only to those with permission. The approach a land trust uses should be based on managing the risk of the land trust not having the documentation needed to steward and enforce its conservation easements and properties. If electronic originals are stored on portable devices (discs or external hard drives), they should be maintained separate from duplicates, protected from daily use and reasonably secure from fire, flood and tampering by individuals.\n\nTips for Cloud-Based Storage\n\nThanks to CommunityIT Innovators for providing guidance on cloud-based storage.\n\nChoosing a vendor to work with to store documents in the cloud is not unlike choosing a vendor to store paper documents. Considerations such as security controls, access and contracting all carry through into the virtual world. Storing documents in the cloud does present some additional benefits, such as ease of access, protection against physical damage and integration into online or searchable database systems. While storing documents in the cloud carries many benefits, it does add some additional concerns and complexity.\n\nChoose a cloud-based storage service or provider with care. Things to look for:\n\nChoose a vendor with a good service level agreement (SLA). The SLA describes the performance of the system and what you should expect as a customer. If the service is down frequently, it won’t be useful to you.\n\nChoose a well-established vendor. If your vendor goes out of business or can’t invest in good cloud infrastructure, your files are at risk.\n\nUnderstand what type or format of files the vendor uses to store files. The most common is PDF for scanned or saved documents. PDF documents should be in the PDF/A format, which includes some additional benefits for long-term archiving of digital content.\n\nDecide how to organize documents. There are several different ways to store and manage data. Some systems are organized in a traditional file and folder structure. Other cloud-based storage systems may have additional features, such as tags so that a document could be assigned multiple attributes. If you need to switch vendors, it is important to understand how you can remove your data from a system. Is there a way to export all your files easily in the event you need to move your files to an alternate storage solution?\n\nA service should provide encryption “at rest” (when the files are stored on the cloud service servers) and “in transit” (when you are uploading or downloading the files to your local computer). Even if documents are in the public record, ensuring the correct method of access is important.\n\nLimit access to your cloud-based storage files. A good storage service will provide granular security settings. Restrict access to the degree you can without compromising operations. Only give access to personnel that need it and limit that access to “read only” when that will suffice. Require complex passwords and consider setting up multifactor authentication (to login, user must provide several separate pieces of evidence that is authenticated by the system).\n\nEmploy a third-party backup solution for your cloud-based storage. A good cloud storage service provider will perform regular backups of their customer’s data to protect their own liability, but you should have your own backups in place independent of that. That third-party backup solution could be a backup to local on-premises storage or to an alternate cloud solution. Having a separate backup repository of data is an extra layer of protection against the loss of data through a crypto attack, vendor disruption or intentional or unintentional data destruction by staff.\n\nCheck the status of your cloud-based storage service and third-party backup service regularly. Are credit card autopayments working properly? Are there customer notifications regarding service interruptions or concerns?\n\nPaper, however, is still a trusted and essential part of almost all land trusts’ recordkeeping systems. It is still the most common format in which to create most documents and records. In fact, paper documents are required to complete most real estate transactions. Paper files and filing systems are often easier to change or expand than computer systems and may be less expensive to create and maintain than sophisticated databases. However, paper takes up a lot of space and, if not properly selected and stored, can be damaged by water, mildew, pests and time itself.\n\nThe Library of Congress provides very detailed specifications for paper they will accept for their archive, which is summarized below.\n\nFiber. The stock must be made from rag or other high alpha-cellulose content pulp, minimum of 87 percent. It must not contain any post-consumer waste-recycled pulp.\n\nLignin. The stock must not contain lignin.\n\nImpurities. The stock must be free of metal particles, waxes, plasticizers, residual bleach, peroxide, sulfur and other components that could lead to the degradation of the paper sheet itself. Iron must not exceed 150 ppm and copper shall not exceed 6 ppm.\n\nOptical brighteners. The stock must be free of optical brightening agents.\n\npH. The stock must have a pH value within a range of 8.0 - 9.5\n\nAlkaline reserve. The stock must contain an alkaline reserve with a minimum of 2 percent and a maximum of 5 percent.\n\nIf you choose not to store your photos digitally, you may want to check with a local museum as to what type of paper they use or will accept. At a minimum, print photographs on acid-free photographic paper.\n\nMost land trusts inevitably use a combination of recordkeeping processes. Your land trust should decide what approach best meets your informational needs.\n\nRecords policies and procedures should address how and where the land trust stores the copies of all original files. Practice 9G2 above addresses storage of originals in more detail.\n\nWhen considering storage options for duplicates, land trusts should consider the following issues:\n\nWho needs access to records — board, staff, volunteers, the public? Which records? How quickly? How often?\n\nConfidentiality. When should access be limited? How should access be limited?\n\nSafety and security. What are the risks of loss, destruction or unauthorized access, and what are the consequences? Fire? Theft? Flood? Malicious mischief? Other? What can you do to limit the likelihood of loss? What will happen if you lose certain data?\n\nOptions abound for storage of both original records and duplicates: a storage facility, bank safe deposit box, office of the land trust’s attorney, local historical society, another location where the land trust has control over the retention of documents, electronic file storage, cloud-based electronic file storage and so forth. Duplicates may be kept in the land trust office either in fireproof filing cabinets or electronically (on a server or in the cloud). Every filing and recordkeeping option has a cost. Costs of various options must be balanced against their benefits. Land trusts should carefully evaluate different recordkeeping systems.\n\nNo matter what format your files take, the duplicates of irreplaceable documents should be stored in a separate location from the originals.\n\nMany land trusts are increasingly using computer scanning as part of their document storage process. PDFs or other file formats that do not allow documents to be altered are created and stored offsite (or in a fireproof safe) on non-rewriteable discs or with an online archiving service. This technique saves space but requires time to scan documents.\n\nIf a land trust stores its duplicates in an electronic format, it should ensure that the copies are exact replicas of the signed originals, with all exhibits and attachments in a format that cannot be altered. Avoid draft or unsigned versions of documents.\n\nIt’s important to remember that digital technology is changing all the time. Keep abreast of new advances in the use and storage of digital documentation and records. Additionally, be aware of any changes in state law or court rulings regarding the admissibility of digital records as evidence in court proceedings. Such changes may alter the land trust’s current records policy and operational procedures. See Tips for Cloud-Based Storage in Practice 9G2 above.\n\nFor accreditation, a land trust must store originals and copies in locations that could not be destroyed in a single calamity (such as paper originals and duplicates stored in separate locations or electronic duplicates being backed up on a remote server or in the cloud). Originals can be electronic or paper.\n\nSome land trusts have copies of certain documents that can be used for monitoring or as problems or issues arise (working files).\n\nThese files should be accessible to land trust personnel who are responsible for completing the transaction or conducting ongoing stewardship activities, such as annual monitoring or responding to landowner inquiries.\n\nContents of the working file may include duplicates of the documents needed to implement the project’s management or monitoring plan in the field. The file may also have a document summary or checklist that serves as a transaction chronology and an index of what is in the permanent file. Many land trusts summarize key information for the working file rather than include entire documents. It is common, for example, to prepare an easement abstract that includes key information on location, restrictions and reserved rights—the kind of information needed for monitoring—and to have the easement itself on file elsewhere.\n\nWorking files typically include:\n\nCompleted document summary or checklist\n\nSite evaluation data or summary\n\nRecorded deed or conservation easement or summary\n\nActive contracts (such as leases) or summaries\n\nMaps (parcel, GPS or topo)\n\nPhotos\n\nBaseline documentation report or summary\n\nUpdated resource data or summary\n\nManagement/monitoring plan or summary\n\nAnnual monitoring reports or summary of monitoring visits made\n\nOriginals of important documents, like the recorded deed or baseline documentation report, should not be kept in the working file but in a separate, secure location."
