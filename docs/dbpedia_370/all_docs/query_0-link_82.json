Geography is one of the major subjects in the school curriculum around the world. This is because we generally agree how important it is for everyone to have some knowledge and understanding of the world, and how the world works. A passion for geography demonstrates a real curiosity about the workings of our wonderful planet, and this is a great advantage in today’s fast-changing world. This book sets out to explain the essentials of the subject and helps parents help their kids with their geography homework. It covers the key areas taught in schools and will refresh the memory of parents who haven’t studied the subject since they were in school. Geography is not just an accumulation of facts and figures. The subject tackles a range of ideas, some of which are complicated: tectonic plates, weathering and erosion, and ecosystems, and some that are constantly developing: globalization, sustainability, and climate change. All these concepts are about our natural world, how human beings relate to each other, and how people and their environment interact. Help Your Kids with Geography is like no other geography book. It is packed full of the information you need to make sense of the world.\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nIt is a book to excite your curiosity and address some of the world’s key issues head on. It encourages you to think geographically about the world, to form a view and, I hope, to argue. This does not mean to squabble or simply disagree, but to listen to different viewpoints and accept that in many geographical matters there is not a single story but many different perspectives. I used to be a school teacher and I was a parent of young children. What I hope this book will do is provide plenty of opportunities for adults and young people to read, share, and talk about the world. It will even help you take on the world! That is geography’s power.\n\nDAVID LAMBERT EMERITUS PROFESSOR OF GEOGRAPHY EDUCATION UCL INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nContents Introduction What is geography?

It studies how people interact with each other and with different kinds of environment. Human geographers are interested in the environments people create for themselves, both in rural areas and in cities.\n\nEconomic and social geography Economic geographers study where economic activities (such as industry and farming) take place. Social geographers look at the distribution of different groups of people.\n\nPopulation geography Population geographers are interested in where people are born, where they die, and how they move about. They also study how populations change.\n\nPractical skills Geographers have a large area of study, so they need to develop a wide range of skills. Understanding how to use maps of various kinds is crucial. Geographers also need to know how to observe and measure things. Statistical skills (processing data as numbers) are very important for geographers.\n\nQ.1 Q.2 Q.3 Q.4 Q.5\n\n△ Location and direction Geographers need to know where things are. They rely on maps, satellite position systems (GPS), and compasses to pinpoint location and direction.\n\nUrban geography Cities are a subject of study for urban geographers. They try to understand why and how things change in cities, and how cities make links across the world.\n\n△ Surveying For human geographers, a survey is a range of questions designed to find data about people. For physical geographers, it’s a measurement of the landscape.\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nFieldwork When geographers go outdoors to study the landscape or the human environment, it is called fieldwork. For many, this is the most enjoyable part of geography. It can take you to wild places in nature, such as high mountains or beautiful forests.\n\n12\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThinking geographically GEOGRAPHERS USE A GEOGRAPHICAL METHOD TO INVESTIGATE AND THINK ABOUT THE WORLD AROUND THEM. Geographers try to establish where in the world things are, how they work, and how they fit into the bigger picture. Geographical thinking combines specific facts and figures with ideas or concepts. It is especially interested in finding links, patterns, and relationships.\n\nCore knowledge Geographical thinking is built on core knowledge – that is, basic facts and figures about the world, such as the names and sizes of the continents; where the main rivers and mountain ranges are; what the main layers of the atmosphere are; which the biggest cities are; and so on. Core knowledge answers straightforward questions such as these: What is the population of Belgium?\n\nWhere is Peru?\n\nHow deep is this lake? What is a glacier?\n\n▽ Finding connections Geography is a subject that provides a broad picture of the world around us and shows how different things are related to each other.\n\nWhat is the route of the Gulf Stream?\n\nGeography relates the local to the global.\n\nGeography links the physical to the human.\n\nGeography connects people to their environment.\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nGeographers link facts and concepts.\n\nT H I N K I N G G E O G R A P H I C A L LY\n\n13\n\nConceptual knowledge To be a good geographer, besides knowing lots of facts and figures about the world, geographers need ideas to help make sense of these. Concepts such as urbanization, globalization, climate, and the hydrological cycle can all be fitted into the big three geographical ideas: place, space, and environment. Most geographical knowledge can be organized under these headings so they make good starting points for examining subjects in more detail.\n\nPLACE A place is an area or location that has been identified and named, usually by the people living there. It can be a single street or a whole continent. A place can be described and researched in depth. A geographer might study its climate and geology, its soil, its population and more. No two places are exactly the same. The special characteristics of one place may help give the geographer an understanding of the world as a whole. Questions you might ask about place: • Describe the economy of this country and explain how this relates to its natural resources. • What are the benefits of choosing to farm in this specific place? What are the soil and climate like in this location?\n\nSPACE Space is the surface of the world in three dimensions. The word “spatial” means “about space”. Space also includes links and patterns between different phenomena and places. Geographers look for patterns of spatial variations, such as population density, and try to understand why they occur. They are interested in the extent of phenomena, such as the damage caused by an earthquake or pollution from a factory. The effect of space is also important, such as the distance between places of economic activity. Questions you might ask about space: • How do global production processes work? How do goods get from producers to consumers on a global scale? • What are the consequences of an uneven distribution of wealth?\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nENVIRONMENT Our environment is our surroundings, both living and non-living. It can be natural, managed by humans (as in the case of farmland) or built, such as a city. Geographers can study the ways humans interact with the world around them, their impact on it, and how humans can care for the environment. Environment can be better understood by looking at ecosystems – the natural systems where living things interact with each other. Questions you might ask about environment: • Why are environments such as deserts and coral reefs fragile? How can we preserve them? • What renewable energy sources should we use?\n\n14\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGeography in action\n\nPhysical geography Geography provides a broad understanding of the world’s natural environments, both the living (animals and plants) and the non-living (rocks and gases). With this knowledge it is possible to pursue a range of careers and interests.\n\nGEOGRAPHY IS NOT JUST A SUBJECT FOR SCHOOL, IT HAS A WIDE RANGE OF PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS. Geography provides a clear framework for understanding the world, and a guide for how to care for it too. Both physical and human geography offer a broad range of areas to study and fascinating jobs or activities to pursue.\n\nGeologist The study of rocks is made by geologists, who seek sources of valuable minerals.\n\nVulcanologist Vulcanologists study volcanoes and try to predict when they might erupt.\n\nClimatologist A key role in our future is played by climatologists, who can warn of changes to the climate.\n\nSoil scientist A soil scientist analyzes soil to discover how best it can grow plants.\n\nMeteorologist A meteorologist focuses on the weather and tries to make accurate forecasts.\n\nPark ranger Parks are vital refuges for wildlife, and rangers help protect them.\n\nBiogeographer To help us know how best to protect the natural world, biogeographers study habitats.\n\nHydrologist Controlling water resources and protecting areas from flooding is work carried out by hydrologists.\n\nPutting it into practice Specialist skills developed for geography and related subjects have an important role to play in the way we interact with our environment – both the natural environment and the human environment. Geography provides an overview, but specialist skills provide detailed, hands-on knowledge of many fields. Here are just some of the varied jobs or activities a geographer might end up doing.\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nGEOGRAPHY IN ACTION\n\nHuman geography Cities and other parts of the human environment are getting bigger and more complicated.

PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY IS THE STUDY OF THE EARTH’S NATURAL SYSTEMS AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ROCKS, WATER, ATMOSPHERE, AND LIVING THINGS. Geographers are interested in how the planet Earth works. They study the formation of rocks and soils, its climate, how water and ice shape its surface, and the communities of animals and plants that live on it.\n\nThe crust is made up of the continents and ocean floors.\n\nThe Earth Geographers study the history of the Earth, looking at the geological processes that have shaped our changing planet. They study how forces from deep within the Earth have powered the formation of huge mountains and deep trenches and have moved continents over time.\n\n◁ Layered planet The Earth has a heavy metallic core surrounded by a deep layer of hot, but mainly solid rock. Its outer surface layer, the crust, is cooler and lighter.\n\nThe Earth’s hot interior is divided into the core and mantle.\n\nRocks and soil Some rocks are formed when volcanoes erupt.\n\nThe Earth is made up of different types of rocks and soil. Geographers investigate the processes that form them. Some rocks are produced deep underground, while others are formed out of the fragments of other, older rocks pressed hard together. With time, rocks are weathered away, and some of the fragments are carried off by the forces of erosion to mix with the remains of living things and form soil. Rocks that are exposed are broken down into small pieces, which are washed away and may form other rocks or soil.\n\nIgneous rock\n\nMetamorphic rock\n\nSedimentary rock\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\n◁ Making new rock Rocks are formed and worn away again in a constant cycle of weathering and erosion.\n\nW H AT I S P H Y S I C A L G E O G R A P H Y ?\n\nRain and melting snow flow into a fast and rocky river. Rain and snow\n\nUpper cour se\n\n△ From source to mouth A river has an upper, middle, and lower course. It grows in size as it flows from the mountains toward the sea.\n\nWeather and climate “Weather” describes the state of the atmosphere at a particular moment, while “climate” describes the average weather in a region over time. Geographers study both, looking at winds, rain, clouds, and other weather phenomena, and at how they affect the world around us.\n\nThe work of water Water shapes our planet in different ways. Geographers study this process, looking at how rivers carve valleys and create broad floodplains and at how the sea erodes and creates landforms. In cold climates, snow builds up to form glaciers that transform landscapes in even more dramatic ways.\n\nMiddle cour se\n\nThe lower course meets tidal salt water in the delta.\n\nLower cour se\n\nThe hole at the center of the storm is called the “eye.”\n\nWarm air spirals out from the eye, cools, and descends.\n\nInside a storm ▷ A full-blown hurricane is a giant rotating drum of clouds, hundreds of miles across, with a hole in the middle.\n\nBiogeography Geographers divide the world into “biomes,” landscapes associated with particular types of animals, plants, and a specific climate. Biomes include deserts, different types of forests and grasslands, as well as the seas and oceans. The study of these biomes is called biogeography.\n\n19\n\nA circular cloud roof forms the top of the hurricane.\n\nThunderstorms and rain create an eye wall.\n\nDeserts are extremely dry, so only a few specially adapted plants grow there.\n\nHeat and dust ▷ This illustration shows some of the plants and animals that are adapted to life in deserts around the world.\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nAnimals such as the camel travel long distances to find food and water.\n\n20\n\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY\n\nEarth’s history and geological time THE GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF THE EARTH IS DIVIDED INTO EONS, ERAS, AND PERIODS.\n\nSEE AL SO\n\nEarth’s structure\n\n22–23\n\nVolcanoes and hot springs\n\n34–37\n\nRocks and minerals\n\n40–41\n\nSedimentary rocks and fossils\n\n47–49\n\nIce ages\n\n62–63\n\nThe major geological milestones in the evolution of life forms on Earth happened over millions of years.\n\nTimeline for life on the Earth Each eon is divided into eras, and each era consists of periods. The table below gives information about the main divisions of the Phanerozoic eon, which started when complex life became abundant on Earth 541 million years ago. Fossils preserved in rocks reveal how life evolved.\n\nEon\n\nEra\n\nPeriod (millions of years ago) CAMBRIAN (541–485) ORDOVICIAN (485–443)\n\nPALEOZOIC\n\nPhanerozoic\n\n541–252 million years ago\n\nMESOZOIC 252–66 million years ago\n\nCENOZOIC 66–0 million years ago\n\nAccording to scientists, the age of the Earth is about 4.5 billion years. What was happening\n\nDuring the Cambrian period, animals with hard shells first became common in the oceans. This is called the “Cambrian explosion” of life. Complex animals such as trilobites flourished in the oceans, but at this time there was no animal life on land—only a few very simple plants.\n\nSILURIAN (443–419)\n\nSilurian oceans teemed with life, including early fish. Short plants, fungi, and small animals, such as millipedes, became abundant on land.\n\nDEVONIAN (419–358)\n\nThis has been called the “Age of fish” because at this time fish began to evolve into more types. Tall trees appeared on land, forming dense forests.\n\nCARBONIFEROUS (358–298)\n\nInsects, such as giant dragonflies, flew through the forests and were hunted by some of the earliest land vertebrates—animals with backbones.\n\nPERMIAN (298–252)\n\nThe land formed a huge supercontinent with vast deserts. The period ended with a global catastrophe that destroyed 96 percent of all life forms.\n\nTRIASSIC (252–201)\n\nAs life slowly recovered, the first small dinosaurs and airborne pterosaurs appeared. Some of these hunted the earliest furry mammals.\n\nJURASSIC (201–145)\n\nGiant plant-eating dinosaurs roamed the forests, using their long necks to feed from treetops. They were prey for big meat-eating dinosaurs.\n\nCRETACEOUS (145–66)\n\nDinosaurs evolved into many different species, including birds, but all the giant dinosaurs were wiped out by a global disaster 66 million years ago.\n\nPALEOGENE (66–23)\n\nSurviving mammals evolved into bigger forms resembling modern rhinos. These replaced the dinosaurs, dominating life on land.\n\nNEOGENE (23–2) QUATERNARY (2–Present)\n\nBirds, mammals, reptiles, and others gradually evolved into modern animals. These included the first upright-walking ancestors of humans. The climate became cooler, causing a series of ice ages. The first true humans evolved in Africa, and gradually spread across the world.\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nEARTH’S HISTORY AND GEOLOGICAL TIME\n\nThe story of life\n\nAustralopithecus afarensis This early hominid could have been the first to walk upright 4 million years ago.\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nTRIASSIC\n\nEudimorphodon Pterosaurs were flying reptiles that lived at the same time as dinosaurs.\n\nQUATERNARY\n\nUintatherium This rhinocerossized animal was a big plant-eating “megaherbivore.”\n\nNEOGENE\n\nPALEOGENE\n\nDimetrodon The fossils of this sailbacked hunter show that it was related to the ancestors of mammals.\n\nJURASSIC\n\nCryolophosaurus The fossil remains of this powerful hunter were found on Antarctica.\n\nMarrella This early animal lived in the sea and had a hard-shelled body with jointed legs and spines.\n\nPERMIAN\n\nCARBONIFEROUS\n\nLepidodendron This early tree had a scaly bark and could grow to more than 100 ft (30 m) in height.\n\nCRETACEOUS\n\nVelociraptor This feathered meat-eating dinosaur had a very sharp claw on each foot.\n\nCAMBRIAN ORDOVICIAN\n\nDEVONIAN\n\nDrepanaspis The head of this jawless, armored fish was covered with a broad, flattened shield.\n\nComets Icy comets that crashed to Earth may have contained the first elements of life.\n\nSacabambaspis This armored fish had very close-set eyes and no jawbones.\n\nSILURIAN\n\nCooksonia Dating from the middle of the Silurian period, this was one of the oldest plants with stems.\n\nAncient volcanoes Water vapor that erupted from volcanoes created the oceans where life evolved.\n\nPRECAMBRIAN\n\nLife began on Earth about 3.8 billion years ago. For most of that time, it consisted of microscopic single-celled forms. But about 600 million years ago, the first complex, multicelled life forms appeared, which gradually evolved into the animals, fungi, and plants that exist today.\n\n21\n\nHomo neanderthalensis This strongly built human species was adapted to life in icy climates.\n\n22\n\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY\n\nEarth’s structure\n\nSEE AL SO\n\n20–21 Earth’s history and geological time\n\nOUR PLANET IS A GIANT SPHERE OF ROCK AND METAL SURROUNDED BY LAYERS OF WATER AND AIR.\n\nMoving plates and boundaries\n\n24–25\n\nShifting continents\n\n26–27\n\nThe atmosphere\n\n74–75\n\nThe Earth is made up of three layers: the core, the mantle, and the crust. More than 70 percent of the crust is covered by oceans, and the rest forms the islands and continents where we live.\n\nEarth’s formation Earth formed about 4.54 billion years ago from a cloud of rock, dust, and gas surrounding the newly formed sun. Gravity pulled this space debris together to form a sphere, which eventually melted and developed a layered structure of metal and rock. This structure then cooled down, finally becoming cool enough to support liquid oceans and an atmosphere.\n\n◁ Accretion Rocks drifting in space started to be pulled together by their own gravity to form one large object, and eventually a planet. This growth by gradual accumulation of material is called accretion.\n\nMeltdown ▷ As more rocks smashed into the planet, the energy from all these impacts converted to heat. The planet began to melt, and most of the heavy metal from its rocks sank to form the core.\n\nREAL WORLD\n\nMeteoric evidence We cannot drill down to the Earth’s core to see what it is made of, but scientists have deduced that it is mostly iron and nickel. This theory is supported by the fact that many meteorites, thought to be from the cores of planets destroyed billions of years ago, contain these metals. For example, this meteorite that fell on Russia in 1947 is made of iron.\n\n△ Cooling When accretion slowed down, the planet cooled. Most of its rock solidified, forming a series of layers around the still-hot metal core.\n\nHundreds of meteorites hit the Earth every day, but most burn up entirely in the atmosphere. 微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\n△ Oceans and atmosphere The gases that erupted from volcanoes formed the early atmosphere.

Its gravity has pulled most of its heaviest, metallic elements down near the core, and the lightest elements exist as atmospheric gases. Rock lies in between, with the heaviest forming Earth’s mantle. Some of the lighter ones make up the oceanic crust, and the lightest rocks of all form the continental crust, which lies above the ocean floors as dry land.\n\nOceanic crust Much of the cool, brittle shell of the upper mantle is capped with lighter rocks that form the ocean floors. This oceanic crust is 3–6 miles (5–10 km) thick.\n\nContinental crust Lighter rocks are created by volcanic processes and form the core of continents. Together with layers of sedimentary rocks, they make up the continental crust, which is up to 27 miles (43 km) thick.\n\nUpper mantle Most of the upper mantle is solid but has a sticky, spongy consistency. It is constantly moving very slowly.\n\nInside Earth ▷ Planet Earth has a relatively thin crust that encloses a deep layer of hot rock called the mantle. The mantle surrounds the planet’s heavy, metallic core. Inner core With a radius of c. 760 miles (1,220 km), the inner core is made of solid iron and nickel. It is kept solid by intense pressure, despite being as hot as the surface of the sun.\n\nLower mantle The rock of the lower mantle is very hot. Despite this, it is kept largely solid by intense pressure.\n\nCore The inner and the outer core form a ball with a radius of around 2,100 miles (3,400 km)—the size of Mars.\n\nOuter core Made of iron, nickel, and sulfur, the outer core is under slightly less pressure than the inner core. It remains a layer of liquid, molten metal.\n\nMagnetic field Swirling currents in the liquid outer core form Earth’s magnetic field.\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nMantle This layer is 1,800 miles (2,890 km) thick and made up of heavy rock that contains a lot of iron and other metals.

As the plates move, they drag the continents along with them, constantly changing their precise position.\n\nFloating continents The continental crust is made of lighter rock than oceanic crust, so it floats higher on the Earth’s mantle, like a raft on a lake. This also prevents it from sinking into the mantle in subduction zones where the plates collide.

Around the time of the first dinosaurs, the continents were joined together in a giant supercontinent known as Pangaea. Since then, they have split apart and drifted to where they are now.\n\nThroughout the history of our planet, the continents have been splitting up and joining together. About 140 million years ago, part of east Africa broke away and was carried north across the Indian Ocean by tectonic plate movement. This island continent eventually collided with Asia about 40 million years ago and became India.\n\n◁ 225 million years ago Pangaea formed about 335 million years ago, as earlier continents were pushed together into a supercontinent.

When the plates of the Earth’s crust grind against each other, their edges become distorted, building up strain. Eventually they give way, and the shock can cause earthquakes and tsunamis.\n\nWhy earthquakes happen Most earthquakes occur in regions where two plates of the Earth’s crust are grinding together. The plates are always moving, very slowly. In some places, this creates steady slip along the faults that form plate boundaries, causing frequent, small tremors. But if the faults get locked, this builds up tension, causing them to give way and generate earthquakes.\n\n202–203\n\n2\n\nDistorted rocks As the plates keep moving, the rocks on each side of the fault become distorted. They bend like springs, storing up energy. As long as the fault stays locked, the rocks will keep bending, building up the tension until, eventually, something snaps.\n\nThe plates keep moving, distorting the rocks on each side of the fault.\n\n1\n\nLocked plates The fault lines that divide tectonic plates are rarely straight and smooth. The ragged edges of the moving plates lock together, so they cannot slip past each other. Despite this, the plates do not stop moving.\n\nFault line\n\nThe plates keep moving despite the locked fault, building up tension.\n\nThe fault remains locked.\n\nThe Richter Scale\n\nLevel 1 At this level, an earthquake can be detected only by special machines called seismometers.\n\nThe magnitude of an earthquake can be measured on a scale such as the Richter Scale. Each step on the scale is 10 times bigger than the one before. This means that a magnitude 6 earthquake is 100 times stronger than a magnitude 4 earthquake.\n\nEFFECTS MAGNITUDE\n\nBarely detectable\n\n0\n\nDetected; not felt\n\n1 微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nLevels 2–4 Tremors might be noticeable.

Most of them cannot be felt.\n\nDestructive earthquakes occur on the boundaries where tectonic plates are either colliding or sliding past each other. Most of these lie around the edges of the Pacific Ocean, forming a danger zone known as the Pacific Ring of Fire. It owes its name to the many volcanoes that erupt along the boundaries where plates are colliding. Japan suffers up to 1,500 earthquakes every year. Some are hugely destructive.\n\n3\n\nSnap and shock When the fault finally gives way, the rocks spring back. All the movement that should have occurred over many years happens within a few minutes, causing an earthquake. Shock waves radiate from the earthquake focus (the fracture point), shaking the earth like ripples on a pond.\n\nThe point on Earth’s surface directly above the focus is the epicenter. This is where the most damage occurs.\n\nNorth America\n\nAsia R ing o f F ir e\n\nThe locked fault gives way under the strain, and the rocks spring back.\n\nSouth America\n\nAustralia\n\nThe fracture point is the focus of the earthquake.\n\nShock waves ripple out from the focus.\n\nSerious damage\n\n5\n\nLevels 7–9 There is tremendous loss of life and serious destruction of property over large areas.\n\nLocal destruction\n\n6\n\nPacific Ocean\n\n△ Earthquake zone About 80 percent of the world’s most serious earthquakes and tsunamis occur along the Pacific Ring of Fire, which extends across Indonesia and the fringes of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nLevels 5–6 Tremors cause weak structures to shake, lift, and fracture, thereby causing damage.\n\nModerate damage\n\nThe Ring of Fire is peppered with more than 450 active or dormant volcanoes.\n\nWidespread wreckage\n\n7 微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nDevastation\n\n8\n\n9\n\n30\n\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY\n\nTsunamis Many earthquakes occur on the ocean floor near deep ocean trenches, where one plate of oceanic crust is being thrust beneath another.

Isocline An anticline or syncline is so tightly folded that the rock layers are nearly parallel to each other.\n\nOverturned fold One limb (side) of the fold pushes over the other and overrides it.\n\nThrust fold A sloping fault line in the strata causes older rock layers to be pushed up above layers of younger rock.\n\nKEY Direction of movement\n\nCrumple zone ▷ Rock strata can be fractured and folded in many ways by the powerful forces of plate tectonics.

Here, the tension makes the crust fracture, creating steeply sloping faults. Big blocks of crust slip down the fault planes to form rift valleys, often lined by steep cliffs. The sections of crust that have not subsided form block mountains. This type of landform is also known as basin and range topography. Tension stretches the rocks so they break, forming faults. One block slips down the fault plane.\n\nFault plane The clifflike face dividing the two blocks is called the fault plane.\n\nFault line Cracks separating blocks of the Earth’s crust are called fault lines.\n\nKEY Direction of movement\n\nBasin and range ▷ The rift valleys form low-lying basins between ranges of block mountains.

Molten rock may either erupt from volcanoes or solidify below the ground to form huge masses of very hard granite called batholiths.

Volcanoes form when molten rock and gas emerge as lava from openings in the Earth’s crust. Some volcanoes are active and can be dangerous. Others are dormant, and many older ones are extinct.\n\nHow volcanoes form All volcanoes are made of rock that originally lay deep underground, where it melted to become magma. When magma is forced to the surface through cracks, or vents, it erupts as lava from one or more craters. The lava cools to form a layer of solid rock, and each eruption adds more layers. These build up to create the conical shape of the volcano.\n\nInside a volcano ▷ Most volcanoes on land are stratovolcanoes, meaning they are made up of alternating layers of lava and volcanic ash.\n\nClouds of ash, steam, and gas rise from the crater.\n\nCrater Magma erupts as lava from the mouth of the main vent.\n\nVolcanic bombs Lumps of lava thrown out during an eruption cool and harden into rock in midair.

There are also hot spot volcanoes, which can erupt far from any active plate boundary. Rift volcano ▷ When plates are pulled apart, the pressure that keeps hot mantle rock solid is relaxed.

In some places, the hot water is held under pressure until it explodes out of the ground as a geyser, a fountain of boiling water and steam.\n\n7\n\nHot spring Heated water rises up to the surface as a spring.\n\n1\n\nRainfall adds to the groundwater.\n\n6\n\nGeyser A tall column of water and steam gushes out.\n\n5\n\nSuperheated water rises to the surface as steam.\n\n2\n\nA geothermal system ▷ Hot springs and geysers occur in clusters called geothermal systems. The heat rising from magma chambers lying deep below the ground causes these thermal features.\n\nGroundwater percolates downward.\n\n4\n\nWater is superheated under pressure.\n\n3\n\nHeat from magma, or hot rock, increases the temperature of water.\n\nMagma chamber\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nI s l aI sn ldasn d s b e t bh e t h l i zEal i z a E n n ee ee Qu Qu\n\nEllesmere Ellesmere Island Island\n\nG r eGer ne el annl ad n d\n\nG r eGerneleannlda n d Se aSe a\n\nB a ffi B anffi n\n\n0 –100m (–328ft) –250m –500m\n\n–3,281ft\n\n–1,000m\n\n–4,000m\n\n–19,658ft\n\n–6,000m\n\nppi\n\nn\n\nn Lake Lake Titicacca Titicacca\n\nPlanalto Planalto de de MatoMato Grosso Grosso co\n\nBr\n\nBa s iBa n sin\n\nSt Helena St Helena\n\nB a s in B a s in\n\nran\n\nraGn á\n\nP a ra\n\nm pa pa s s\n\na\n\na\n\nni\n\nni\n\ngo ta\n\nta\n\nPa\n\nPa\n\nGoughGough IslandIsland\n\nB a s in B a s in\n\nFalkland Falkland Islands Islands\n\nThe movement of the Earth’s crust has pushed up rugged mountain ranges on the continents and created chains of volcanic islands in the ocean.

ROCKS ARE FORMED FROM A MIXTURE OF MINERALS.\n\nIgneous rocks\n\n42–43\n\nMetamorphic rocks\n\n50–51\n\nThe rock cycle\n\n52–53\n\nThe Earth is made up of chemical elements that naturally bond together to form gases, liquids, and solids. Most inorganic naturally occurring solids are called minerals, and they make up the rocks.\n\nMinerals Minerals are naturally occurring inorganic (nonliving) chemical elements in a solid form. They may be formed of just one type of chemical element or from mixtures of elements. Some minerals occur as pure—or native—elements. Most minerals, however, are made up of two or more elements in a compound.\n\nCopper\n\nGold\n\nSome minerals take thousands of years to develop, while others grow in only a few hours.\n\nRuby (an oxide)\n\n△ Native elements Native elements include copper, gold, and silver, which form veins of pure metal in rocks. Sulfur and other nonmetallic native elements are found in deposits around volcanic craters.\n\nQuartz (a silicate)\n\n△ Compound minerals Most minerals contain more than one element. Many have metals that combine with oxygen to form oxides. Most rock-forming minerals contain silicates, a combination of silicon and oxygen.\n\nIdentifying minerals Many minerals look very similar. The glasslike mineral quartz could be mistaken for diamond, and pyrite is known as “fool’s gold” because it has the same yellow, metallic look. Minerals can be identified clearly by checking their properties using a series of tests. These examine hardness, streak, luster, and cleavage.\n\nTalc △ Hardness A mineral’s hardness is its resistance to being scratched. It is measured on a scale of 1 to 10. Talc has a hardness of 1.\n\nCinnabar\n\nOrpiment\n\nMica\n\n△ Streak Rubbing a mineral on a hard, rough surface leaves a streak of color. Cinnabar creates a red-brown streak.\n\n△ Luster How a mineral reflects light is called its luster. Orpiment is partly pearly and partly like the resin that forms amber.\n\n△ Cleavage Some minerals, such as mica, can be split apart along flat planes of weakness. This property is called cleavage.\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nROCKS AND MINERALS\n\n41\n\nOres and metals Some rocks are sources of metals and other minerals. These mineral deposits are called ores, and they usually look quite unlike the metals we get from them. Many ores are compound minerals such as metal oxides, which must be processed in a refinery to extract the pure metal.\n\nHematite is the most important iron ore due to its high iron content and its abundance. It is mined extensively.\n\nIron oxide deposits ▷ The modern world relies on iron and steel, which are made by refining iron ore. Most of the ore is iron oxide, just like rust, which explains why the ore is a rusty brown color.\n\nCrystals While there are more than 5,000 minerals, there are just six basic types of crystals. Crystals are the basic 3-D structure of the mineral. All mineral crystals fall into one of these six categories.\n\n△ Cubic A compound of iron and sulfur, pyrite forms crystals that are perfect cubes. Like all crystals, they have perfectly flat faces.\n\n△ Tetragonal Tetragonal crystals are rectangular prisms with angled faces on each end. This is zircon, a mineral formed in molten rock.\n\n△ Hexagonal These crystals typically form prisms with six sides, often with pointed ends. The mineral shown is called apatite.\n\n△ Monoclinic These crystals are rectangular prisms with sloping ends. This is orthoclase, a type of feldspar found in granite rock.\n\n△Orthorhombic Orthorhombic crystals are like rectangular boxes distorted in one direction. This mineral is the gemstone topaz.\n\n△ Triclinic Triclinic crystals, such as axinite, form shapes that resemble rectangular boxes distorted in two directions.\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\n42\n\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY\n\nIgneous rocks\n\nSEE AL SO\n\n22–23 Earth’s structure\n\nTHESE VERY HARD ROCKS FORM FROM MOLTEN ROCK DEEP WITHIN THE EARTH.\n\n40–41 Rocks and minerals Weathering and erosion\n\n44–46\n\nThe rock cycle\n\n52–53\n\nWhen magma rises from deep within the Earth, then cools and solidifies on the surface, igneous rock forms. This very hard rock is made up of mineral crystals locked together in a solid mass.\n\nHow igneous rock forms Very hot rock deep underground stays solid despite the high temperatures because it is squeezed by intense pressure. However, if the crust rips apart, this reduces the pressure, and the rock can liquify to form magma. Magma that erupts from volcanoes is called lava. This cools to form igneous rock on the surface. It can also cool below the ground in large masses called igneous intrusions.\n\nLava This is molten rock that flows over the surface.\n\nVolcanic ash Lava blasted into the air cools into particles of igneous rock.\n\nLayers of rock\n\nSill When magma cools and solidifies between two layers of rock, it forms a sill.\n\nBatholith An igneous intrusion that covers an area larger than 40 sq miles (100 sq km) is called a batholith.\n\nDike When magma pushes up vertically through a crack in the rock, it forms a dike.\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nMagma chamber Volcanoes are fuelled by molten rock that collects in an underground magma chamber.\n\n43\n\nIGNEOUS ROCKS\n\nTypes of igneous rocks\n\nExtrusive rock Lava that cools within hours forms glassy obsidian. If it takes weeks to cool instead, it forms crystalline rocks, such as rhyolite.\n\nIgneous rocks that are made up of the same minerals can take different forms depending on how quickly the magma cools down. Magma buried below the ground cools very slowly and forms intrusive rocks with large crystals. Molten rock that erupts at the surface of the Earth cools much faster and forms extrusive rocks with very small crystals or no crystals at all.\n\nRocks that cool very fast have no crystals.\n\nObsidian Lava flowing from a volcano cools rapidly, resulting in extrusive rocks.\n\nRhyolite\n\nGranite\n\nMagma below the ground can take millions of years to cool and form intrusive rocks.\n\nMagma chamber\n\nIntrusive rock Granite has the same chemistry as rhyolite but has much bigger crystals that keep growing for thousands of years inside the Earth.\n\nInterlocking crystals\n\nRock chemistry\n\nIgneous rocks form as very hot, molten rock cools and starts to solidify. The various minerals in the melt form crystals, and as these crystals grow, they become interlocked in a rigid structure. This makes the resulting igneous rock very hard and resistant to the forces of weathering and erosion.\n\nApart from crystal size, igneous rocks vary in their chemistry. They are mixtures of different minerals, and the amount of each mineral in the mix alters the rocks’ color, weight, and hardness. It also affects how they behave when they melt.\n\nSilicate liquid (magma) with crystals\n\n◁ Basic rocks Rocks with a lot of iron and magnesium are called basic rocks. They are very heavy and dark and melt to form very runny magma or lava.\n\nCrystals growing in size\n\nBasalt\n\n△ The crystallization process As the mineral crystals form in the cooling magma, they combine and grow in both size and number until they form a solid mass.\n\nCrystals packed together to form solid rock\n\nAcid rocks ▷ Rocks with less iron and magnesium are called acid rocks. They are paler and lighter and form sticky, thicker magma or lava.\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nGranite\n\n44\n\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY\n\nWeathering and erosion WEATHERING OCCURS WHERE THE ROCK IS SITUATED; EROSION HAPPENS WHEN GRAVITY OR WATER CARRY OFF FRAGMENTS OF ROCK.\n\nSEE AL SO\n\nWhen rocks are exposed on the Earth’s surface, they are broken down by the weather and living things. The fragmented rock may be carried away by water or gravity.\n\nMountain streams\n\n56–57\n\nGlacial erosion\n\n64–65\n\nGlacial deposition\n\n66–67\n\nCoastal erosion\n\n68–69\n\nCoastal deposition\n\n70–71\n\nWeathering Exposure to the weather and plants and animals starts to break down rocks in a process called weathering. They can be partly or even completely dissolved by rainwater, shattered by frost, cracked by heat, split by plant roots, or attacked by microscopic life. Eventually even the hardest rock may crumble to dust.\n\nThis granite boulder is composed of feldspar, quartz, and mica.\n\nAcidic rain\n\nWeak acid attacks surface of granite boulder.\n\n1\n\nWater seeps into cracks in the rock.\n\nQuartz crystals fall away as sand.\n\n△ Chemical weathering Rainwater is slightly acidic. It dissolves some minerals that hold rocks together, so they start to fall apart. Limestone, for example, may dissolve completely in rainwater.\n\nAt night, the rock surface contracts as it cools down.\n\nOver time, thin layers of the rock’s surface flake away.\n\n△ Thermal weathering Intense sunshine bakes desert rocks by day, and clear skies chill them at night, causing the rocks to expand and then contract. The surface of the rock begins to flake away.\n\nWater expands as it freezes. This puts pressure on each side of the crack.\n\n3\n\nThe crack gets bigger, allowing more water to freeze inside it and split the rock.\n\n△ Freeze-thaw weathering Cracks in rocks fill with water. As the water freezes to ice, it expands, forcing the cracks further apart. Eventually rocks split and fall apart.\n\nMixed soil and rock\n\nBy day, the sun’s heat expands the rock surface.\n\n2\n\nTopsoil\n\nMicrobes dissolve some of the minerals that form rocks, so the rocks fall apart. Tree roots force apart cracks in the bedrock.\n\n△ Biological weathering As tree roots grow, they force their way into cracks in the rock and break it up to form soil. Microscopic life in the soil also breaks down rocks to get at their minerals.\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nW E AT H E R I N G A N D E R O S I O N\n\n45\n\nErosion Weathering breaks down rock into smaller fragments and particles. These are then usually carried away by the work of erosion—which can be by flowing water, wind, and moving ice. Eroded material can range from dust carried high in the air to huge slabs of rock that collapse in massive landslides.\n\nErosion by water Water is the main agent of erosion. A fast-flowing river can move big rocks, as well as bounce smaller stones over the riverbed. River water carries tiny particles in suspension and dissolves some minerals, carrying them in solution.\n\nDirection of water flow\n\nDirection of water flow\n\n△ Traction Fast-flowing water can roll large rocks along the bed of a river. In the process, rocks rub against each other and break down.\n\nDirection of water flow\n\n△ Saltation Water makes small stones bounce along the riverbed. Wind moves sand in the same way. Wind and water can carry small particles easily.\n\nErosion by ice The moving ice of a glacier can transport huge rocks down a mountainside by carrying them along on its surface. Rock debris is also carried inside the glacial ice, and this helps the glacier carve deep valleys in the landscape.\n\n△ Suspension The smallest particles are light enough to be carried along either in the water or the air. Held in suspension, they travel long distances.\n\nDirection of water flow\n\n△ Solution Water can dissolve some minerals and carry them away. Chemical changes can make the water deposit the minerals to form new rocks.\n\nRocks on the surface of the glacier Moving rock debris helps cut out the valley.

This can happen slowly causing “soil creep.” However, when water is added, slopes can collapse in a more catastrophic way with large amounts of material suddenly tumbling downhill. Fissure\n\n◁ Slump A part of a cliff or mountainside detaches and slides downhill, often along a curved surface.\n\n◁ Landslide A mass of earth and rock slips downslope, often forming a chaotic mixture of debris. Unstable rock breaks away and slides downhill.\n\nSaturated soil slumps to the foot of the hillside.\n\nBed\n\nroc\n\nB e dr\n\nk Toe, or end of deposits\n\nCurved slip plane\n\nock\n\nLandslide slope\n\n◁ Mudflow A mass of soil turned to runny mud by heavy rain or melting snow surges down a slope.\n\n◁ Scree Rock fragments that have been broken away by weathering tumble downhill. When rocks are weakened by freeze-thaw weathering, gravity pulls them down.\n\nHollow filled with muddy flow of loose soil.\n\nB e dr\n\nock\n\nMuddy debris gets deposited at the base, forming a mudflow delta.\n\nB e dr\n\nock Base of debris\n\nREAL WORLD\n\nSculpting natural wonders Weathering and erosion can create spectacular landforms, like the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States. Carved out of the desert by flowing water and frost action over the last 5 million years, the canyon is up to 6,092 ft (1,857 m) deep, 277 miles (446 km) long, and more than 18 miles (29 km) wide at its broadest point.\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nS E D I M E N TA R Y R O C K S A N D F O S S I L S\n\nSedimentary rocks and fossils\n\n47\n\nSEE AL SO\n\n24–25 Moving plates and boundaries 40–41 Rocks and minerals 44–46 Weathering and erosion\n\nFORMING A TINY PART OF THE CRUST, SEDIMENTARY ROCKS ARE THE MOST COMMON ROCKS ON THE EARTH’S SURFACE.\n\nThe rock cycle\n\n52–53\n\nEroded rock fragments are eventually deposited as layers of soft sediment. Over time, the sediments may be compacted and cemented together to form sedimentary rocks, some of which form fossils by preserving the remains of plants and animals.\n\nTypes of sediments Sediments can be made up of different types of rock fragments depending on the rock that produced them—weathered granite, for example, eventually turns to quartz sand and clay. Sediments also vary widely in grain size.\n\nStones\n\nSmall stones\n\nGravel\n\n▽ Sorted sediments When water transports sediments, the heaviest drop first, while the lighter ones are carried further. This sorts them into different sizes.\n\nSand\n\n△ Compression and cementation Loose sediments are laid down in layers compressed by the weight of sediments on top. Minerals in water may then cement grains together to form solid rock. This view through a microscope shows the grains packed together in a rock.\n\nRock strata Over millions of years, different types of sediments can settle on the same site and turn into different types of sedimentary rocks. This creates layers called strata. When strata form, they are horizontal, but they can be buckled and snapped, or faulted, by the forces that build mountains. Oldest layer of rock\n\nNewest layer of rock\n\n△ Undeformed strata Sedimentary rock strata nearly always form horizontally, from sediments laid down on lake or seabeds. Older rocks lie beneath strata that formed more recently.\n\nCompression buckles the rock strata into a series of folds.\n\n△ Folded strata When moving plates of the Earth’s crust push against each other, rock strata are squeezed and folded. They can be thrust up on end or even overturned.\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nStrata on either side of the fault plane slip out of alignment.\n\nFault plane\n\n△ Faulted strata When strata are stretched, the rock layers break at a point called a fault plane. Similar faults can form if compression occurs too fast for the rock to adjust to it by folding.\n\n48\n\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY\n\nSedimentary rock types Layers of sediment that have been sorted naturally by grain size lock together into sedimentary rocks. Beds of pebbles may be cemented together into conglomerate, sand becomes sandstone, and clay turns to very fine-grained shale. Some rocks such as chert (which is made of silica) have a glasslike texture, with no visible grains at all.\n\nRounded pebbles Fine-grained sediments\n\nCompact silica in its fine-grained structure\n\nFolds created due to movement of original deposit\n\nConglomerate This rock is formed by rounded, water-worn pebbles cemented together by finer sediments.\n\nChert Made of silica—the same mineral as glass—chert is very hard. Flint is a type of chert.\n\nSandstone Most sandstones are made of quartz crystals once carried by water or swept into dunes.\n\nThe dark color is due to the carbon-rich matter in the rock.\n\nFine matrix of sediments surround angular fragments.\n\nVisible layers that split into sheets\n\nSiltstone Silt consists of much smaller particles than sand and forms siltstone.\n\nBreccia Like conglomerate, breccia is a mass of sharp-edged pieces transported by glacial ice.\n\nShale Clay can harden into shale, which has many thin layers that often split apart.\n\n微信公众号：知者陪娃\n\nIron-deficient chert Iron-rich hematite\n\nBanded ironstone Formed on ocean floors, banded ironstone has thin layers of iron-rich rock.\n\nFlint forms curved surfaces when broken.\n\nFlint Found as lumps in chalk rock, flint forms very sharp edges where it breaks.\n\nS E D I M E N TA R Y R O C K S A N D F O S S I L S\n\n49\n\nFossils Many sedimentary rocks contain remains of animals and plants that fell into the soft sediments before they turned to rock. Their buried tissue and bones are gradually replaced by minerals to form stony fossils preserved in the rock. The remains tell us about ancient life, and also help geologists work out how old the rocks are.\n\n1\n\n2\n\nAnimal dies Some 66 million years ago, this Triceratops died of old age, and its body slipped into a lake.\n\nSkeleton is buried Mud settling through the water buried the body before it could be torn apart and eaten by other animals.\n\n3\n\nBones turn to fossil Over millions of years, the mud turned to rock, and the buried bones became fossils. REAL WORLD\n\nBiogenic rocks Some sedimentary rocks consist almost entirely of fossils. Shelly limestone is full of fossil seashells, chalk is made up of the microscopic skeletons of marine plankton, and coal is made up of the remains of compressed plants.\n\nThe hard parts of the animal—the bones, teeth, or shell—are the most likely to fossilize. Overlapping plates called coccoliths protected the plankton from harm. They are made of calcium c"
