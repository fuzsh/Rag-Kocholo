        "text": "Nepal Earthquake – Inclusive response\n\nIn April 2015 a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal. Since then CBM, with our partners, has been working to ensure that affected people, including those with disabilities, recover from their losses. As well as including everyone in relief, our response will help build resilience to future potential disasters by creating more accessible, inclusive communities.\n\nFacilitating mainstream inclusion\n\nOne part of our strategy is to support ‘mainstream’ humanitarian actors as they become increasingly aware that disability inclusion is not optional.\n\nA recent example of this work was a two-day workshop to create a good understanding of disability-inclusive reconstruction, in collaboration with the National Federation of Disabled Nepal (NFDN), the Shelter Cluster Nepal and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).\n\nAchieving access through DPO participation\n\nThis workshop, aimed at managers and practitioners involved in shelter and settlement in Nepal, using the ‘All Under One Roof’ guidelines, took place in Kathmandu on 25th and 26th November 2015, virtually coinciding with International Day of Persons with Disabilities 2015.\n\nNot only the date, but the general theme was in line with that of the International Day – ‘Inclusion matters: access and empowerment for people of all abilities’; the training will ensure reconstruction initiatives are accessible and, with NFDN (the national umbrella organization of Nepalese Disabled Persons’ Organisations, DPOs) as co-hosts, includes and empowers persons with disabilities in the process.\n\nThe programme\n\nThe training was led by Vidar Glette, a consultant specialising in the inclusion of persons with disabilities in emergency shelter and settlement programmes, with support of Ms. Shweta Sharma, CBM Emergency Response Inclusion Advisor, Nepal, CBM Country Representative for Nepal, Mr Prakash Wagle, and Nepal Shelter Cluster Coordinator, Tom Bamforth.\n\nParticipants were from different backgrounds – including architects, civil engineers, managers, program coordinators and country representatives – and were selected from government institutions, agencies working on reconstruction and Disabled People’s Organisations (DPOs).\n\nDay one focused on creating a consistent understanding of disability, inclusion, barriers, and the impact/interaction of and between emergencies and disability, through presentations and interactive group activities. The second day allowed a deeper exploration and understanding of the subject, discussing details such as technical standards & measurements. Resources were provided in accessible formats – including Braille – as well as being available both in English and Nepali. Future trainings - at district level - are being considered.\n\nFeedback\n\n“Having a document in Braille made training much easy to comprehend for me” Amrit Rai, President, National Association of Blind, Nepal\n\n“I would like to thank CBM for organising such training for us, it was an eye opener for issue of disability. This is the kind of support that is required” Prajwol Raj Bajracharaya, Architect, Habitat for Humanity International\n\n“When I go back I will give orienation to my team mates, review our activities and make sure our activities in future will be disability inclusive” Bibek Karki, Relief Distribution and Management Officer, Mission East\n\n“Disability inclusion and inclusive shelter should be pre-conditions for any donors or government agencies responsible for any programs after emergencies” Pushpak Newar, Rehab Technical Manager, Handicap International, Nepal\n\n“Training like this should be begining and must continue reaching to wider audience” Ritva Jantti, Country Coordinator, Australian Red Cross, Nepal"
