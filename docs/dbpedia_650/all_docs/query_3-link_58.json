        "text": "Welcome to the Kali: Flame of Samsara walkthroughs.\n\nThis page features the walkthroughs for Season 1. Click here if you are looking for walkthroughs for other seasons.\n\nThis is an ongoing book and this page is a work in progress.\n\nWhat are walkthroughs? Walkthroughs are episode-by-episode guides that will reveal the effects each choice has on your character and the plot. Please note that these pages are always under construction as we learn more about each book.\n\nMost choices you make for the Main Character in this book influence the following variables: Pride üêç or Passion ü¶Å, Freedom üå∏ or Legacy üî±, and Dignity ‚öúÔ∏è\n\nPLEASE NOTE: choices that have no significant effect on the plot (as in, no effect on game points and statistics) or that do not give interesting information on characters or backstories might have not been included in the walkthroughs.\n\nPremium choices that require in-game currency to be unlocked are marked by a üíé diamond symbol. Quick choices that are timed are marked by a ‚è∞ timer symbol.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏èTRIGGER WARNINGS: Ep 4 contains descriptions of violence and death. Ep 11 contains descriptions of violence, brutality, and death. Please read on with caution.\n\nDISCLAIMER: due to the very intricate nature of this game, where every choice you make sets into motion a complicated series of consequences, there are many possible game routes and scene combinations. As a result, the walkthroughs on this wiki might not be exactly identical to your game experience. If you experience something that is not covered in our walkthroughs, please leave a comment so we can update the page and add an extra possible route to our wiki.\n\nAlso please note: The descriptions of the scenes included in these walkthroughs might be paraphrases of what happens, so please don't take them as word by word copies of what is said in the book.\n\nDo you have more questions or comments?
