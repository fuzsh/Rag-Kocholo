Interview highlights many unknown episodes and events of life of both Munship Premchand and Amrit Rai and records the comntemporization of Hindi as a critic and creative writer.\n\nNotes\n\nThis item is part of a library of books, audio, video, and other materials from and about India is curated and maintained by Public Resource. The purpose of this library is to assist the students and the lifelong learners of India in their pursuit of an education so that they may better their status and their opportunities and to secure for themselves and for others justice, social, economic and political.\n\nThis library has been posted for non-commercial purposes and facilitates fair dealing usage of academic and research materials for private use including research, for criticism and review of the work or of other works and reproduction by teachers and students in the course of instruction.
