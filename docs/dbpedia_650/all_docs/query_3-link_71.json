        "text": "Gandhinagar (Gujarat) [India], August 5 (ANI): Under the ‘Ek Pedh Maa Ke Naam’ campaign, Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel on Monday took the innovative experiment and inspired the Women and Child Welfare Department of planting 53,065 trees along with the children Anganwadis across the state.\n\nThrough this motive, the CM has adopted an inspiring approach towards environment conservation and has inculcated the habit of cultivating and nurturing trees among the Anganwadi children in the state.\n\nThe CM has started the statewide campaign of planting the saplings with the children on the first day of the holy month of Shravan. Under the ‘Ek Pedh Maa ke Naam’ campaign, a total of 3.15 lakh saplings will be planted in the Anganwadis across the state.\n\nPatel also distributed a heartfelt conversation with the children and distributed saplings among them. Additionally, the CM also set a target of planting 12.20 crore trees by September 2024 and 17 crore trees by March 2025.\n\nEarlier, on August 1, Assam’s CM Himanta Biswa Sarma participated in a tree plantation program under the “Ek Ped Maa ke Naam” as a part of the Amrit Brikshya Andolan at the park of Ministers Colony at the Dispur Capital Complex in Guwahati.\n\nSpeaking about the plantation program, Sarma said that the Assam government will be planting three crore plants from August 1 to August 20 as a part of the Amrit Brikshya Andolan.\n\n“The Assam government has participated in a plantation program under the “Ek Ped Maa ke Naam” as a part of the Amrit Brikshya Andolan. We will be planting 3 crore plants from August 1 to August 20. I believe we will be playing a very important role in protecting the environment through this program,” the CM said.\n\nThe ‘Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam’ campaign was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the occasion of the World Environment Day Campaign on June 5.\n\nDefence Minister Rajnath Singh also participated in the campaign and planted a tree in the memory of his mother.\n\nSingh called upon the people to join the campaign to protect nature and actively make the movement for environmental protection more effective and dynamic."
