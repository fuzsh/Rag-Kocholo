        "text": "I reached out to ZSA in search of a more stable opportunity, where I connected with Amrit who was fantastic in every way. She ended up pitching several opportunities to me, the last of which was the perfect match for what I was looking for. She kept me up to date throughout the entire process, and was always available for any questions. Amrit had good insight as to the details of the offer, and what the employer was really looking for, in addition to having some great interview tips. I have used other recruiters in the past, but would return to ZSA as they seem to focus just as much on the potential candidates as they do the employers.\n\nI recently changed the direction of my legal career by seeking a place in private practice after years as in-house counsel. Without the assistance of ZSA’s Calgary office, my transition to a practice that fit with my goals and personal values would not have been possible. They were highly attentive to my needs and sought to assist me whenever and however they could by answering questions and sharing knowledge of firm cultures. I sincerely appreciated ZSA’s positive attitude towards my job search which kept me in the right frame of mind as I approached my interviews. I am now settled at a very good firm with a rewarding practice. I wish to thank ZSA for their efforts on my behalf.\n\nI was placed as Legal Counsel and dealt with Orit Sinai. Since early January, I had been applying to some positions on my own, but found it difficult to find opportunities that matched what I was looking for. I saw one posting, which requested CV’s and cover letters to be sent to Orit directly, and fortunately, doing so led to a professional connection with Orit. I had an excellent experience with her. I first reached out to Orit in respect to a posting I saw online that I thought might be interesting. When I spoke to her and provided more information about myself, she informed me that, while that posting was not aligned with my experience and career goals, she would keep me informed of other opportunities that were. Orit actually listened to what I said and sent me specific opportunities that matched what I was looking for. During the recruitment process, Orit facilitated all communications between me and the organization, which helped move things smoothly and efficiently. Her support was indispensable in reviewing the offer I received from the organization and she made herself available to me, even after hours, as I am currently dealing with extenuating circumstances with my family. I have used other recruiters in the past but ZSA is top notch! I do not think I would have been able to find such a perfect match without Orit. After our first conversation, my career “wish list” was turning into postings Orit sent my way. I felt heard and supported. Orit also went above and beyond to facilitate the hiring process, which made my life easier. Orit was always on my side and I could not recommend Orit or ZSA highly enough."
