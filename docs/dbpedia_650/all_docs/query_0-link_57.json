        "text": "A wealth of Old Hindi texts in the Rajasthani and Brajbhasha dialects survives from the early modern period, but they remain an underused archive of Mughal history. The Māncarit (“Biography of Man Singh,” 1585) of Amrit Rai, one of the earliest known examples of Rajput literature about a Mughal manṣabdār, provides fascinating perspectives on Mughal power, as seen from the perspective of the court of Man Singh Kachhwaha, one of the leading regional kings of Akbar’s day. Amrit Rai was as much a poet as an historian, which makes the Māncarit and the many Rajput texts like it challenging to interpret, but the possibility of gaining alternative perspectives on Mughal state formation makes such a hermeneutic enterprise essential. Bien qu’il existe un riche corpus de textes en vieil hindi (dans les dialectes rajasthani et brajbhasha) datant de la période de la première modernité, ceux-ci demeurent une archive sous-exploitée de l’histoire moghole. Le Māncarit (« Biographie de Man Singh », 1585)d’Amrit Rai, un des plus anciens exemples de littérature rajput concernant un manṣabdār moghol, offre de fascinantes perspectives sur le pouvoir moghol du point de vue de la cour de Man Singh Kachhwaha, un des principaux royaumes régionaux de l’époque d’Akbar. Amrit Rai était autant poète qu’historien, ce qui fait de l’interprétation du Māncarit et des nombreux textes rajputs lui ressemblant une tache épineuse. Parce qu’elle peut permettre d’accéder à des perspectives alternatives sur la formation de l’État moghol, une telle entreprise herméneutique est toutefois essentielle.\n\nThe penetration of Mughal power into previously autonomous regional kingdoms produced significant political, but also literary effects. In this article, I trace the advent of the Mughal political order to the princely state of Orcha (located in what is now north-western Madhya Pradesh) through the eyes of Ke´savd¯as (fl. 1600), the leading poet from that court. Ke´savd¯as is famous in Hindi literary circles as one of the progenitors of the Brajbhasha r¯ıti tradition, a constellation of courtly poetic and intellectual practices that flourished in a climate of mixed Mughal and sub-imperial patronage. There is a pronounced tendency to think of Ke´savd¯as’s work (and that of most r¯ıti poets) as a corpus of baroque, purely decorative poems largely comprising time-worn erotic and devotional themes. This preliminary study of Ke´savd¯as’s three historical poems will help to complicate such an understanding by bringing into our conceptual purview a fuller range of r¯ıti textual expression. These lesser known works by one of the foremost r¯ıti poets are certainly striking for their literary accomplishments, but they also serve as an invaluable window onto a critical moment in Orcha history. They constitute the perfect testing ground for the enterprise of retrieving historical meaning from the literary sources that were the dominant form of pre-modern Indian courtly self-expression, and the methodology employed here is to critically engage both aesthetic and historical perspectives simultaneously.\n\nThis article presents the first in-depth textual analysis of the Razmnamah (Book of War), the Persian translation of the Mahabharata sponsored by the Mughal emperor Akbar in the late sixteenth century. I argue that the Razmnamah was a central literary work in the Mughal court and of deep relevance to Akbar’s imperial and political ambitions. I pursue my analysis of the Mughal Mahabharata in two sections, focusing first on the work’s Sanskrit sources and then on the translation practices one finds evidenced in the Persian text. In the first section, I outline how the Mughal translators accessed Sanskrit materials and identify the Sanskrit texts that served as the basis for the Persian translation. This framework helps reconstruct the nature of the Mahabharata as the Mughals knew it and provides both the conceptual and literary tools needed to pursue comparative textual analysis. In the second section, I examine the text of the Razmnamah in comparison with its Sanskrit sources to highlight some of the Mughal translators’ key strategies in reimagining the epic in Persian. This close reading traces several literary paradigms that offer insight into the crucial role the Razmnamah played in the production and reproduction of Mughal imperial culture. Taken as a whole, my analysis argues that the Razmnamah was a crucial component of the politico-cultural fashioning of Akbar’s court, whereby the Mughals developed a new type of Indo-Persian imperial aesthetic.\n\nhereafter \" the_A'in_ \") and his treatment of divination techniques focusing on knowledge of the breath (Sanskrit: _svarodaya_, Persian: _'ilm-i dam_). Existing scholarship on the _A'in_, largely uses this text either for (a) evidence on Mughal administration and bureaucracy, or (b) evidence of Akbar's pluralistic views on religion. Operating from the point of view that divination is intimately linked to power, this paper's thesis is that examining Abu'l Fazl's presentation of divination sheds valuable light on how this pragmatic Mughal official sought to equip his patron and fellow courtiers with the means to maintain their political influence, no matter the source of said means. Of key importance here is understanding the way that Abu'l Fazl clearly valued knowledge traditions that were non-Islamic in nature, thus bringing into question the notion that the predominantly Muslim membership of the Mughal court would have been predisposed against practices originating with Hindus, Jains, and other Indian groups. After introducing the _A'in_ and describing its general outline, this paper presents the \"Svara\" section in depth. It then places the practices from \"Svara\" within a broader context of debates over the relationship between Akbar's policies towards non-Muslims under his rule. The paper concludes with an analysis of what scholars can learn about Mughal attitudes towards non-Muslim Indian knowledge traditions, as well as posing questions for future development.\n\nThis article examines the emergence of the concept of Kashmir jannat nazir as a literary and political imaginary in the Mughal court. It represented a distinct imagination about the region and emerged as a literary imaginary in the late 16th century and over the early part of the 17th century, entering into the imperial chronicles. By the mid-17th century, the concept had become a part of the political discourse and the language of Mughal sovereignty. The literary and political imaginary of Kashmir in the Mughal court drew upon older textual traditions like the literature and histories from Kashmir, corpora of Arab and Persian geographies compiled from the ninth century onwards, travel accounts, wonder tales and the chronicles of the Ghaznavid and Timurid courts.\n\nIn the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, Jain leaders faced a series of religious questions at the royal Mughal court. At the request of their imperial Muslim hosts, Jain representatives discussed aspects of both Islam and Jainism on separate occasions, including the veracity of Islam,whether Jains are monotheists, and the validity of Jain asceticism. The Mughals sometimes initiated these conversations of their own accord and at other times acted on the prompting of Brahmans, who had political and religious interests at stake in encouraging imperial clashes with Jain leaders. Jain authors recorded these exchanges in numerous Sanskrit texts, which generally remain unknown to Mughal historians and Sanskrit scholars alike. I examine the Jain accounts of these cross-cultural debates and expound their political, religious, and intellectual implications. These engagements showcase how the Mughals negotiated religious differences with diverse communities in their kingdom. Furthermore, the Sanskrit narratives of these dialogues outline complex theological visions of how Jain beliefs and practices could thrive within a potentially hazardous Islamicate imperial order. More broadly Jain and Mughal discussions provide rich insight into key developments in religious precepts and local identities in early modern India.\n\n'Images of Thought' provides easy to follow ways in which to read Indian, Persian and European paintings in terms of composition, proportion, colour symbolism and references to myth. Yet it also provides the intellectual contexts of Islamic cultures which inform our perceptions of how this visual language works. The author uses salient aspects of critical theory, anthropology and theology to sensitise viewers to the diversity and difference of cultural readings but never loses sight of the primacy of the visual and formal characteristics, gestures, geometrical structures and their cooperation with myths and theologemes. The book provides access to one of the world's major visual traditions whose characteristics continue to inform and elucidate Indian and Islamic contemporary thought today. 'Images of Thought' is a major, scholarly and provocative contribution not only to our understanding of cultural individuality but it offers important examples of how to engage in transcultural understanding and ways of seeing."
