        "text": "One of the leading Spinal Surgeons in the UK with over 30 years' experience in treating patients for a wide range of back and neck problems. My practice philosophy is to treat everyone as an individual, doing what is right, as if they were members of my own family. I personally appreciate the disability from spinal disease as I myself have undergone spinal surgery in recent years.\n\nThroughout my extensive career, I have performed in excess of 10,000 operations and demonstrated expertise on a wide range of spinal conditions with emphasis on spinal stenosis, ageing spine cervical fusion / disc replacement and minimal access keyhole surgery. However, the majority of patients seen in my clinic are treated conservatively, without the need for an operation. Be assured if surgical intervention is required you are in safe hands and expertise as evidenced by holding the largest patient database looking at spinal outcomes, which are recorded on the British Spinal Register, resulting in a 5 star rating.\n\nPrior to any procedure taking place, I allow dedicated time to discuss all the options available with the patient and their family to ensure all alternatives have been explored to give patients a balanced opinion.\n\nIn addition to my clinical attributes, I was elected President of the British Association of Spinal Surgeons (BASS) by my surgical peers, where I was on the BASS Executive Committee for six years (2017 â€“ 2023).\n\nI am also the Director of a spinal charity Spine Aid, which arranges regular trips abroad for a team of spinal surgeons, medical students, neurophysiology technicians and anaesthetists to help treat under privileged children with spinal deformities.\n\nI am proud to share my knowledge and experience with colleagues across the world having trained over 25 Consultant Spinal Surgeons worldwide. I helped develop core curriculum for spinal training and am the Foundation Programme Director for junior doctors. I am a regular reviewer of unit level surgical practice in the UK via BASS and Royal College of Surgeons."
