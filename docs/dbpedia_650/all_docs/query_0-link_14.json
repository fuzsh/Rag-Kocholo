        "text": "A HOUSE DIVIDED: ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF HINDI/URDU\n\nQUESTION/ANSWERS\n\nQ1. Write a short note on Hindavi.\n\nAns. Hindavi is the language that was spoken around Delhi and whole North India from thirteenth to eighteenth century. It evolved out of Prakrit (natural or spoken language) and Apabhramsas (made-up from regional variation). So, the natural spoken language and its regional dialects gave birth to this language.\n\nLike any growing language, Hindavi borrowed words freely from both Persian and Sanskrit. Its literature was produced in both Devnagari and Persian scripts, and also in several dialects. The key feature of Hindavi was its eclecticism or selecting a variety of good feature from various languages.\n\nMany poets such as Kabir, Mirabai, Malik Mohammad Jayasi, Tulsidas as well as Bulleh Shah, unselfconsciously employed a variety of linguistic and literary traditions in their works over several centuries from Amir Khusrau till Bullah Shah.\n\nAmir Khusrau is credited with a command over both Persian and some other dialects of Hindavi. His Hindavi is a mixture of Persian and Braj Bhasha.\n\nQ2. Comment on Amrit Rai’s “Introduction: A Conspectus.”\n\nAns. “Introduction: A conspectus” is the first chapter of Amrit Rai’s book A House Divided: The Origin and Development of Hindi/Hindavi. Rai traces the origin and development of Hindavi language and its splitting into modern Hindi and modern Urdu.\n\nRai says that Hindiavi has had natural and uninterrupted development throughout the history. This language had been native to north India before the Muslim invasion but it still had a continuous growth after Muslims came with Persian and Arabic as their major languages.\n\nHindavi was chiefly impacted by the dialects spoken in countryside of Delhi. In its sophisticated style Hindava was used by court poets like Amir Khusrau and others. With the passage of time, Hindavi borrowed words from Persian, Arabic as well as Sanskrit.\n\nAmrit Rai seems to have high regard for this language which developed through many centuries and kept itself open for borrowing, and eventually developed into standard Urdu and standard Hindi.\n\nQ3. What are the factors that played a key role in the creation of Hindi and Urdu as separate languages?\n\nAns. The common origin and evolution of Hindi and Urdu have been a matter of debate among the scholars for a long time. Amrit Rai’s A House Divided is another step in the same direction and makes significant contribution to this debate.\n\nPolitical, historical and social factors have played a significant role in examining and also assessing the history of Hindi and Urdu. By the early twentieth century, Hindi and Urdu are clearly discernible as two separate languages. Those writing in Devnagari script came to be known as “Hindi writers” and those who wrote in Persian script were called “Urdu writers”.\n\nBefore independence, Fort William College ran two separate departments for Hindi and Urdu, identified them with Hindus and Muslims respectively. After independence, the political decisions taken on the language issue evoked different reactions and responses towards Hindi and Urdu in India. Consequently, Hindi and Urdu were created as two separate languages.\n\nQ4. What idea of complex linguistic intermingling is depicted by Amrit Rai in “Introduction: A Conspectus”?\n\nOr\n\nThe relation between Hindi and Urdu is a complex linguistic intermingling. Elaborate.\n\nAns. “Introduction: A Conspectus” by Amrit Rai gives an idea of complex linguistic intermingling that was a feature of the language known as Hindavi, the origin of Hindi and Urdu. Rai quotes Gyan Chand saying that Urdu writing has more Persian and Arabic words and Hindi has more words from Sanakrit. However, the individual words do not change a language into some other language.\n\nRai again quotes Ram Bilas Sharma, a noted scholar of Hindi, saying that Hindi and Urdu are not two separate languages. They are basically one and the same. Their pronouns, verbs, and basic vocabulary are the same. He also adds that there are no two other languages in the world whose pronouns and verbs are hundred percent the same.\n\nTalking about the intermingling of the languages Arnot and Forbes says that the relationship between Hindi and Urdu is the same as two ships, one made of oak and another of teak but of which the internal construction, rigging, size, etc. are the same.\n\nQ5. According to Amrit Rai purism in language is a dangerous phenomenon. Comment.\n\nAns. Amrit Rai in “Introduction: A Conspectus” talks about a composite linguistic culture between Hindi and Urdu. He strongly argues his points that there were many things in common between Hindi and Urdu, even both the languages originated from a common language, Hindavi.\n\nHowever, slowly both the languages started to adopt a rigid form in which Hindi borrowed exclusively from Sanskrit and Urdu had Arabo-Persian words. This unnatural process limited the growth of both the languages, but the factors responsible for it are those other than internal dynamics of a language.\n\nThe Arabo-Persian purism on the one hand and Sanskrit purism on the other hand, hindered the natural development of Urdu and Hindi. This linguistic purism not only blocks the healthy growth of the two languages but it also creates a dangerous social tension. To defuse this dangerous phenomenon there is a further need of research in this direction.\n\nQ6. Why did Amrit Rai say that protagonists of Hindi and Urdu are being divided into enemy camps?\n\nAns. According to Amrit Rai there is a passion to study Hindi and Urdu but linguists study them as two separate languages belonging to two separate cultures and religions. And those who must be considered heroes of Hindi and Urdu because of their contribution are turned into enemies of each other.\n\nThe principle of this antagonism of separation lies in the policy of divide and rule of British colonialism. As the British devised many policies to keep Hindus and Muslims divided, language policy worked most efficiently in this regard. Colonial policy of languages was implemented through Fort William College Calcutta.\n\nThe political stand towards languages in the Eight Schedule of Indian Constitution further aggravated the situation. Making Hindi as the official language of India gave a somewhat impression that other languages are less important. Furthermore, Hindi was considered the language of Hindus and Urdu was considered the language of Muslims, it brought political hostility into language.\n\nQ7. “Different scripts do not mean different languages” elaborate with reference to Amrit Rai.\n\nAns. Amrit Rai makes very significant observations and arguments in “Introduction: A Conspectus.” He argues that if a language is written in more than one script, it still remains one and the same language. So, Hindavi, at some stage in history, was written in both Devnagari and Persian scripts which later evolved in Hindi and Urdu.\n\nTherefore, many noted scholars of Hindi as well as Urdu are considering Hindi and Urdu as one language. Gyan Chand says, to call Urdu and Hindi two languages is to belie all the principles of linguistics. And Ehtesham Husain says that the truth is that from the standpoint of linguistics, it is not correct to say that Hindi and Urdu are two languages.\n\nRai strongly makes the point that difference of script cannot make two languages out of one language. As Gyan Chand argues that before the partition Panjabi Muslims wrote Panjabi in Urdu script, the Sikhs in Gurumukhi, and the Hindus in Devnagari, it does not mean that they wrote three languages. So, Davnagari script and Persian script do not make two languages out of one, Hindi and Urdu are one and the same language.\n\nQ8. Comment on the language politics in India as highlighted by Amrit Rai.\n\nAns. While Amrit Rai argues about origin, development and split of Hindi and Urdu, he makes politics responsible for present hostility between the two languages. Hindi and Urdu are considered the languages of two separate religious and cultural groups rather than languages that originated and developed in Indian cultural context. Eventually, with empowerment of a language one’s ethnic and regional identity get linked with it.\n\nAfter independence, Indian Constitution in the Eight Schedule enumerated languages; some languages got highest privileges than the others. Some languages were hurt by the categorization of languages in Indian Constitution which placed them opposite to other languages like Marathi/Konkani or Hindi/Urdu.\n\nHindi became the official language of India and Urdu was marginalized as language of invaders. Urdu was more abhorred in India as it became the official language of Pakistan. It finalized the politics of languages and perpetual hostility emerged, even in linguistic research. Language hostility eventually becomes social hostility.\n\nQ9. How was the term ‘Hindi’ understood in different historical contexts?\n\nAns. Amrit Rai’s “Introduction” to his book A House Divided: The Origin and Development of Hindi/Hindavi shows a variety of ways in which the term Hindi was understood in different historical contexts. Hindavi, Hindustani and Hindi were used to refer to the one and the same language that was spoken in Northern India and was written in Devnagari script.\n\nAmir Khusrau uses the word Hindi for the language of North-West India with which Muslims first come in contact in Punjab and Dehli. Mohammad Aufi refers to the same language as Hindavi. It would thus be safe to assume that the two words are interchangeable. However, they do not mean the modern standard Hindi.\n\nAfter demonstrating how Hindi and Hindavi were interchangeable terms, Amrit Rai also shows how Hindavi is the same as Hinduwee and, later it came to be known as Hindoostanee. Amrit Rai says that as we go along and trace the development of this language we shall see that it had a natural and quite uninterrupted growth for several centuries.\n\nQ10. Is the notion of the “purity of language” justified?\n\nAns. Amrit Rai in “Introduction: A Conspectus” does not approve purity of language. His seminal research in his book shows that a language is always enriched from the borrowing from the other languages. This is true about almost all the languages of the world and linguists have proved it through their exhaustive research.\n\nAmrit Rai disapproves the Sanskrit purism in Hindi, on the one hand, and Arabo-Persian purism in Urdu, on other hand. This fundamentalism in language hinders the natural growth of the language. In addition to it, this is against the dynamics of the growth of a language.\n\nPurism in languages also creates hostility between the different groups speaking different languages. Because each group considers it’s language superior than the other and stops the mutual borrowing between the languages. Eventually this linguistic purism creates social hostility.\n\nQ11. What role did Fort William College play in creating the perception of Hindi and Urdu as two separate languages?\n\nAns. Amrit Rai has a very profound understanding of the language hierarchy in India. The languages in India were first categorized by British. They had a purely colonial agenda while dividing people along the line of languages. Precisely, the language policy of British was never a matter of philological interest.\n\nFort William College should be the starting point in the research about uncovering the reasons behind the split of Hindi and Urdu in two separate and independent languages. Otherwise, all the major Indian poets like Amir Khusrau considered Hindi and Urdu a same language Hindavi which they wrote either in Persian script or Devnagari script.\n\nSir John Gilchrist was instrumental at Fort William College in treating Hindi as exclusive property of Hindus, and examined this language in a comparative study of its state before the Muslims came to India and after that. Therefore, it was Fort William College and Sir John Gilchrist who played a villainous role in separating Hindi and Urdu to a hostile proportion."
