        "text": "Aaj Ka Panchang 3 August 2024: The Hindu Panchang is an esteemed and antiquated calendar system that harmoniously merges spiritual and practical wisdom, presenting a comprehensive framework for navigating life's complexities. By offering a profound understanding of auspicious and inauspicious periods, it enables individuals to make informed decisions, align with celestial cycles, and achieve a balance between personal and professional life. Through Panchang's guidance, individuals can attain a state of synchronization with the universe, leading to a life of equilibrium, prosperity, and spiritual growth, where the human experience is in perfect harmony with the cosmic order. This ancient wisdom facilitates a symphony between individual existence and the celestial world, cultivating a life of balance, growth, and balance.\n\nOn August 3rd, 2024, the Panchang indicates that Rahu Kaal, a period considered inauspicious for initiating significant endeavours, will occur from 09:05 AM to 10:46 AM. However, the day also presents opportune moments for accomplishing important tasks, specifically during the auspicious intervals of Amrit Kaal, Abhijit Muhurat, and Vijaya Muhurat. These propitious periods offer favourable conditions for success and prosperity. Meanwhile, the Disha shool, or directional inauspiciousness, is assigned to the East direction, advising against embarking on journeys or ventures in this direction, as it may lead to unfavourable outcomes. By acknowledging these celestial influences and aligning our actions accordingly, we can harness the beneficial energies of the day and minimize potential obstacles.\n\nRead the important Panchang details for today below:\n\nAaj Ka Panchang 3 August 2024\n\n14, Shravana\n\nKrishna Paksha, Chaturdashi\n\n2081 Pingala, Vikrama Samvata\n\n- Sunrise: 05:44 AM\n\n- Sunset: 07:10 PM\n\n- Moonrise: 05:16 AM, Aug 04\n\n- Moonset: 06:46 PM\n\n- Tithi: Chaturdashi up to 03:50 PM, Amavasya\n\n- Nakshatra: Punarvasu up to 11:59 AM, Pushya\n\n- Paksha: Krishna Paksha\n\n- Yog: Vajra up to 11:01 AM, Siddhi\n\nAuspicious Timings\n\n- Brahm Mahurat: 04:19 AM to 05:02 AM\n\n- Abhijit Muhurat: 12:00 PM to 12:54 PM\n\n- Godhuli Muhurat: 07:10 PM to 07:32 PM\n\n- Vijaya Muhurat: 02:42 PM to 03:35 PM\n\n- Amrit Kaal: 09:29 AM to 11:09 AM\n\nInauspicious Timings\n\n- Rahu Kaal: 09:05 AM to 10:46 AM\n\n- Gulikai Kaal: 05:44 AM to 07:25 AM\n\n- Yamganda: 02:08 PM to 03:49 PM\n\n- Dur Muhurat: 05:44 AM to 06:38 AM, 06:38 AM to 07:31 AM\n\nDisha Shool - East"
