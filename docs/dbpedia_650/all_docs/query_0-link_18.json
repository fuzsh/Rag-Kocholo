        "text": "While planning to climb Mount Kilimanjaro, it is important to choose the route that is right for you. Our popular choice right now is one of the oldest and most popular routes to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. The Marangu route also known as the ‚ÄúCoca-Cola‚Äù is the only route up Kilimanjaro which offers sleeping accommodations in simple alpine huts with all the essential requirements such as mattresses and pillows, but sleeping bags should be brought along. There are communal dining halls, washrooms and toilets. This makes it a good choice for people who are not used to camping or who want a more comfortable experience. The scenery on the Marangu route is varied and beautiful. The first day of the hike takes you through the rainforest, the second day through the moorlands, the third day through the alpine desert, and the fourth day through the snowfields and glaciers. This route can be done in 5 days (making it the shortest route to the summit) but our 6 day Marangu route package is nearly as popular as it gives Mount Kilimanjaro hikers a better acclimatization opportunity. Additionally, due to proper planning & implementation of the Tanzania government in the Tourism sector, High-speed Wi-Fi has come to Kilimanjaro and only via the Marangu route out of all 6 established routes.

Recommended for the physical fit only, it runs for more than 40km and reaches 4,200 m.a.s.l. at its highest point, the Warmiwa√±uska or Dead Woman's Pass. The stone-paved trail, discovered in 1960 and part of the more than 23,000 km of roads built by the Incas across South America, crosses a remarkable range of natural landscapes and eco systems, from thick tropical jungle to the bear, unwelcoming rocks of the Andean mountains. All in all it's probably the most beautiful walk in South America. The Trail takes three to four days of tough hiking, and can be commenced at Chillca (Kilometre 76 of the Cusco-Machu Picchu railway) or, most frequently, at Qorihuayrachina, Kilometre 88 of the railway. The first day is relatively easy, and includes along the route the Inca ruins of Cusichaca, Q'ente, Pulpituyoc, and Llaqtapata, a site used for crop production remained well preserved. The second day is the hardest of all, mainly because the ascent becomes increasingly steep.\n\nBest 5 Things to Do in Kathmandu City & Valley (Nepal) 1.

The key destinations for this extraordinary experience are Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, housing 19 gorilla families, and Mgahinga National Park, home to one habituated gorilla family. A common query among visitors revolves around the optimal duration for a gorilla trekking adventure in Uganda. For an enriching and comprehensive gorilla trekking experience, three days is the recommended timeframe. This duration allows ample time to navigate the lush habitats of Bwindi and Mgahinga, increasing the likelihood of encountering these majestic creatures.

Therefore, it is advisable to plan for a minimum of three days to fully immerse yourself in the captivating world of gorilla trekking. https://lnkd.in/difN7cKV\n\nReview for Hello Hikers - Humpta Pass Trekking Experience (June 16-21, 2024) https://hellohikers.in/ Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (1/5) My recent experience with Hello Hikers during the Humpta Pass trekking trip from June 16th to June 21st, 2024, was nothing short of a nightmare. I want to share this review to caution fellow trekkers about the severe mismanagement and potential dangers associated with this organization. Lack of Amenities: Despite the promises made by Hello Hikers, there were no camps arranged for two nights during the trek. We were left stranded with no shelter, which is unacceptable and dangerous in such remote locations. Threat to Life: The guides provided by the company ran away, leaving us to fend for ourselves. This abandonment posed a significant threat to our safety, as we were left without any guidance or support in the wilderness. No Food or Medical Assistance: There was no provision of food or medical assistance. The lack of basic necessities like food and medical support is inexcusable, especially on a challenging trek like Humpta Pass. Pathetic Management: The overall management of the trek was extremely poor. Despite numerous attempts to contact the owner, Mr. Praveen Chauhan (Mob: +9193055644), we received no response. The coordinators were unhelpful and took no responsibility for the situation. Abandonment: My son had to find his way back on his own from the Gaza road, without completing the trek. This was a harrowing experience for him and a clear indication of the company's negligence. No Refund: To add insult to injury, Hello Hikers is not ready to refund the money for this disastrous trip. This lack of accountability and refusal to compensate for their failure is unacceptable. In conclusion, I strongly advise against booking any trekking trips with Hello Hikers. Their lack of professionalism, disregard for safety, and poor management put lives at risk. They are merely interested in selling packages without any accountability for the services they promise. Please do not risk your life and well-being with this company. #https://lnkd.in/g5nMq5KW"
