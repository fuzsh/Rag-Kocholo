        "text": "Ophthalmology residents getting ready to graduate are getting a taste of working in a rural setting.\n\nA new partnership started this week between the Timmins and District Hospital and the University of Toronto's Kensington Eye Institute. It will see one faculty member from the school and a fifth-year resident working at the Locum Ophthalmology Clinic at the medical building next to the hospital.\n\nFor one week every month, a member of the university's faculty team and a fifth-year resident in the ophthalmology program will be helping with the local ophthalmology needs, specifically cataract surgery, explained Dr. Alejandro Oliver.\n\nOliver has worked in Timmins for 15 years and is the only full-time ophthalmologist in town.\n\nEarlier this year, the locum clinic opened to help fill service gaps.\n\nSEE: New clinic a 'game changer' for local patients\n\nBy bringing in locums — doctors from other areas who visit the city for a period every month or couple of months — more people will be able to be diagnosed and treated by an ophthalmologist in the city.\n\nRight now, Dr. Marie Louise Lapointe from Ottawa is usually in town the fourth week of the month. She does laser procedures and sees patients for general concerns such as glaucoma, drug toxicity screening and diabetes screening.\n\nThe University of Toronto doctors will be at the clinic every third week of the month.\n\nThe partnership officially started on Monday (Sept. 18).\n\nDr. Kirill Zaslavsky is the first resident to do a stint in Timmins. He's joined by Dr. Amrit Rai, a University of Toronto ophthalmologist.\n\n“A lot of these patients sometimes have to come down to Toronto and we see them in our clinics there. But we know that that’s a challenge for the patients and for their family members who have to accompany them to travel such long distances to receive care. We know that if you can provide care in somebody’s local community that’s better for the patient and better for the community,” said Rai.\n\nIt's also a great opportunity for the university's residents.\n\nThe bulk of their training happens in Toronto, said Rai.\n\n\"There’s different pathologies here and there’s different styles of practice and maybe some of the residents may prefer to work in a community like this and so they may decide after they graduate to move to Timmins or move to another similar community and start practicing in that kind of environment,” he said.\n\nEach year, the university has about six fifth-year residents.\n\nThat means each student will be in Timmins at least twice during their residency.\n\nRai emphasized that the residents are well-trained, are months away from graduation — and potentially setting up their own practice — and have done hundreds of cataract surgeries.\n\nThe residents are also supervised at every step, said Oliver.\n\nHaving doctors who are getting ready to graduate live and work in the community also opens up other reasons to be excited.\n\n\"When you have more established doctors come and visit and help, it certainly helps but there’s no prospect that they would want to move here because they all have their established practices. But residents, especially in their last year, they’re in that transition phase where they’re starting to make plans for what they’re going to do for the next five, 10 years. For us to be able to showcase Timmins, our people, our climate, fresh air, our way of life — I think we stand a good chance of maybe enticing somebody to come permanently,” said Oliver.\n\nSince the locum clinic opened in March, 285 cases have been completed.\n\n“So far it’s been phenomenal. We’ve had great response from patients, we’ve been able to repatriate a lot of patients through Dr. Lapointe’s clinics from … Sudbury or North Bay that were going there for glaucoma care or macular degeneration care and that means a lot for patients, especially the more elderly. To make that four-hour trip each way is a lot to ask. They’ve been very happy,” said Oliver.\n\nDue to their vision problems, Rai added that often the patients can't travel on their own.\n\n\"So you also have to consider the family members who may have to take a day off work or whatnot to get the patient to that centre whereas when it’s local it’s a lot easier for them to get here and recieve that care locally,” he said."
