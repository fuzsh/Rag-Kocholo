        "text": "Kareena Kapoor Khan married Saif Ali Khan in 2012, and they have kept setting couple goals. Kareena has been a hands-on mother to two kids, Taimur and Jeh, and she also showers love to Saif's kids with his former wife, Amrita Singh, Sara Ali Khan, and Ibrahim Ali Khan. There was a time when Bebo spoke about being impressed with Amrita's motherhood skills and had predicted Sara's entry into Bollywood.\n\nLet's dig deep into this throwback when Kareena Kapoor called Amrita Singh a \"wonderful mother\" to Sara and Ibrahim. During a conversation with Komal Nahta on his show, ETC Bollywood Business, Kareena was asked about how she is a \"maasi\" to her sister Karisma Kapoor's kids, Samaira and Kiaan, and a \"maa-si\" to Amrita's kids, Sara and Ibrahim.\n\nThe Crew actress said, \"She is more like friend than anything else. I think they (Sara and Ibrahim) have a wonderful mother.
