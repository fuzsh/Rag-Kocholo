        "text": "With a rich culture and history that spans centuries, a numerous population, and a wide range of languages and religions, India has a multitude of names to offer. So, whether you want to honor your heritage or youâre looking for a name with a deep and profound meaning, weâve got the most popular, beautiful, modern, unique, and cute Indian and Hindu girl names for you to choose from.\n\nSelecting Indian Girl Names\n\nIf youâre considering an Indian name, you may enjoy learning more about Indian naming conventions and the traditions involved. India has a large and diverse population, and choosing a baby name may be influenced by the various regions and religions within India.\n\nIndiaâs Regions and Languages\n\nHere are some of the main languages and regions in India that may guide the names you choose:\n\nHindi. This Indo-Aryan language is the main language in India and the fourth most frequently spoken language in the world. Itâs spoken mainly in the Hindi Belt region, which encompasses parts of northern, eastern, central, and western India.\n\nUrdu. Spoken mostly in South Asia, this Indo-Aryan language is the national language of Pakistan. The majority of Urdu speakers are Muslim from the Urdu belt of northern India, or the Deccan plateau in south-central India.\n\nTelugu. Part of the classical Dravidian language family, Telugu is mostly spoken by people in southeastern India.\n\nMarathi. This language is mostly spoken in the Indian state of Maharashtra in West India.\n\nKannada. Part of the classical Dravidian language family, itâs mostly spoken by the Karnataka people in southwestern India.\n\nGujarati. Native to the state of Gujarat on the Western coast of India, Gujarati is the fastest-growing Indian language in the United States and Canada.\n\nTamil. Part of the classical Dravidian language family, Tamil is mostly spoken in southern India and Sri Lanka.\n\nPunjabi. This language is used in the Punjab region of eastern Pakistan and northwest India.\n\nBengali. This language is mostly spoken in Bangladesh and eastern India.\n\nIndiaâs Religions\n\nWhen searching for Indian names for women, you may discover that many are influenced by certain religions within the country. Two of these include Hinduism and Sikhism.\n\nHinduism. This is the worldâs oldest and third-largest religion. Ninety-five percent of the worldâs Hindus live in India. Many of their name choices stem from Hindu mythology, astrology, philosophy, and cosmology.\n\nSikhism. This is a monotheistic religion and the fourth-largest religion in India. It is traditional for male Sikhs to use the name Singh, meaning âlionâ as a middle or last name, and for females to use Kaur, meaning âprincess.â\n\nIslam. Indiaâs second-most commonly followed religion is Islam, which has a strong presence in Indian society and culture. Muslims in northern India often follow Islamic naming conventions.\n\nJainism. This is one of the worldâs oldest religions. Itâs common for Jains to use Jain, Shah, Firodia, Singhal, or Gupta as their last name.\n\nNaming Conventions\n\nNaming traditions for children in India will vary depending on the region and religion, though the meaning of a given name is always a chief consideration. Here are a few (among many) naming conventions used in India.\n\nIn northern India, it's customary to have a given name followed by a surname.\n\nIn southern India, a surname is uncommon and is usually adopted by a person when they migrate.\n\nHindu parents commonly consult an astrologer to help them choose a given name for their child based on their horoscope. The astrologer will give the parents a beginning sound for the name, and the parents will then pick a name based on that.\n\nPopular Indian Girl Names\n\nThere are many Americans born of Indian descent, adding to a rise in popularity of beautiful Indian American girl names in the United States. If you love staying on trend with the most popular girl names, take a look the following list, which includes some of the best Indian baby girl names that have topped the charts in recent years.\n\n1.

This name has been used in the United States since the 1970s and is even the name of Stevie Wonderâs first daughter.\n\n2. Anika. This Hindi name is the feminine form of Anik, meaning âarmy,â or âsplendorâ in Sanskrit. It's a popular Indian girl name not only in the United States but also in Slovenia.\n\n3. Arya. You may recognize this name from the popular fantasy series Game of Thrones, but you may be surprised to learn that it actually stems from an old Indo-Iranian word meaning ânoble.â This popular name is sure to suit your strong and noble little lady.\n\n4. Fatima. In recent years, this Urdu and Arabic name has grown in popularity in the United States and throughout Europe.
