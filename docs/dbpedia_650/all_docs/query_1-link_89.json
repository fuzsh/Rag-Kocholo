        "text": "Amrita Rai\n\nIn a Facebook update, Anand Pradhan, the estranged husband of TV journalist Amrita Rai, has appealed to friends and well-wishers to respect his privacy and stand by him in these difficult times.\n\nAfter Congress general secretary Digvijaya Singh admitted to his relationship with Pradhan's wife and Rajya Sabha TV anchor Amrita Rai on Wednesday, April 30, 2014, Pradhan, who is an associate professor in Indian Institute of Mass Communication, wrote: \"I am going through difficult and testing times. Amrita and I have lived separate lives for a long time. We have applied for divorce with mutual consent. It is a legal procedure which takes its own time. But the relationship we once had ended long ago.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nRead: Digvijaya Singh admits to his relationship with TV anchor\n\nIntimate pictures of the Congress leader with Rai were leaked recently on the Internet and had gone viral.\n\nPradhan said Rai was free to decide about her future. \"Amrita is free to take decisions about her future and I respect them. I also wish her the best for her future life,\" he wrote on Facebook.\n\nPleading with his friends to respect his privacy, Pradhan wrote, \"I know many of my friends, well-wishers, students and colleagues are feeling sorry for me. But more than that, I also know they are with me. I am sure I will come out of these difficult times. I expect you all to respect my privacy. One gets to recognise one's friends on such occasions.\"\n\nRead: Digvijaya and Amrita: What's on Twitter?\n\nAppealing to friends and well-wishers to not indulge in cheap gossip over his personal crisis, Pradhan wrote: \"For people who are not ready to view the finer details of man-woman relationship and also the woman's existence and personality from any other mindset than the feudal and patriarchal one, for those who do not consider women anything more than a private property or a baby-making machine, for those who do not respect the dignity of that gender, it is a chance to indulge in lurid jokes, personal attacks and mudslinging. But this is all they know. This is the limit of their thinking and politics. I do not expect anything more than this from them.\"\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Digvijaya Singh had tweeted: \"I have no hesitation in accepting my relationship with Amrita Rai. She and her husband have already filed a mutual consent divorce case.\"\n\nRead: Top five political love stories before Digvijaya Singh's\n\nAsked about the leaked pictures, Rai, a senior anchor with Rajya Sabha TV channel, said that her computer had been hacked."
