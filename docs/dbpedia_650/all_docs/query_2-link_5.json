        "text": "Exactly 4 years ago my husband, Alex, and I left for India as a tandem couple, him working for the U.S. Department of State and me for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). When we left we had made a pact. We had an agreement that at the end of our tour in India, either he would leave the Foreign Service and return to D.C. so that I could continue my job with the FBI. Or I would leave the FBI and join the Foreign Service with him. Nothing wrong with those that do this, but for myself I never imagined a time when I would just follow him from country to country as his ‚Äúspouse‚Äù with no career. I‚Äôve always liked to have a plan and multiple back-up plans. Well next month our tour in India officially ends. With that I have an announcement to make. I have officially accepted the offer to join the Foreign Service. I am thrilled for the opportunity to represent the U.S. as a diplomat abroad üá∫üá∏ This process has taken such a long time time that I‚Äôm still shocked it‚Äôs finally happening. Since leaving college I‚Äôve never had a day in my life when I have not been employed. Since I didn‚Äôt have a job lined up and we were headed to Bogota, Colombia next, I‚Äôd been joking with friends that maybe now would be a good time for me to take a break and just spend time with the baby. Well so much for that. Looks like I‚Äôll be starting training in DC with a newborn on my side while Alex goes off to Colombia alone. Wish me luck. Ha!"
