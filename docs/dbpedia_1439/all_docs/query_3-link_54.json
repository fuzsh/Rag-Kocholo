The space below the trunk of Dick’s Creek Aqueduct was always too small to vent the water passing in said creek during freshets, and the consequence was the banks of the canal were overrun and frequently broken. My estimate, however, contemplates an enlargement of the water way to more than double the present. The gates of all the locks are almost entrrely gone, and must be rebuit, and probably several new miter sills will have to be furnished.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJOHN W. ERWIN,\n\nRest. Engineer, Miami and Erie Canal.\n\nLITTLE MIAMI CANAL AND BANKING COMPANY.\n\nThe navigation of the Little Miami by means of slack water and canals was proposed in the early history of the State, but it was never carried out. In 1817, the Legislature incorporated the Little Miami Canal and Banking Company, authorizing it to construct such dams and locks, and to open such canals as may be necessary for a practicable ascending and descending boat navigation on the Little Miami River from the Ohio to the town of Waynesville.\" The incorporators named in the act were Abijah O'Neall, John Satterthwaite, Richard Mather, Thomas Graham, Isaac Stubbs, Ralph W. Hunt, Jeremiah Morrow, John Elliot, Patterson Hartshorn, Zaccheus Biggs and John Armstrong. The company was authorized to carry on a general manufacturing and banking business; the capital stock was to consist of $300,000, and the subscription books were to be opened in March, 1818, at Cincinnati, Milford, Gainesboro, Lebanon and Waynesville. The company was authorized to receive tolls at the rate of 10 cents per ton at each lock. It was expected that the canal would make Gainesboro, which had been laid out two years before, a thriving town, but work on the canal was never commenced, and Gainsboro, never attained the importance anticipated by its projectors, and long ago ceased to exist as a town.\n\nRAILWAYS.\n\nThe first railroad in the Ohio Valley passed through Warren County. As early as 1832, the project was devised of forming a railroad line connecting the lakes and the Ohio River, and passing through the intermediate country between the two great State canals. For this purpose the Legislature granted a charter incorporating the Mad River & Lake Erie Railroad Company, and authorized it to construct a railroad from Sandusky City, on Lake ,Erie, to Springfield, in the Mad River Valley. Subsequently, the Little Miami Railroad Company was incorporated and authorized to construct a railroad along the valley of the Little Miami River, extending to Cincinnati on the south, and Connecting with the Mad River & Lake Erie Railroad at Springfield, on the north, thus forming a railway route across the State.\n\n290 - HISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY.\n\nThe act incorporating the Little Miami Railroad Company was passed March 11, 1836. The capital stock authorized was $750,000, and the following_ named persons were appointed Commissioners for receiving subscriptions; Robert Buchanan, George W. Neff, Charles Schultz, of Cincinnati; William Lewis, of Fulton; Mathias Kugler, of Hamilton County; John Emery, of Milford; Jeremiah Morrow, M. Roosa, Thomas Smith, John M. Hadden, of Warred County; Allen Wright, of Lebanon; John Hadley, of Clinton County; James Galloway, Jr., R. D. Frosham, of Xenia; Bennett Lewis, of Clifton; John Hivling, Joseph Kyle, of Greene County; Peter A. Sprigman, James Boyle, Charles Anthony, of Springfield; John T. Stewart and Rowland Brown, of Clark County.\n\nStock books were opened and the subscriptions of individual stock were liberally made. The city of Cincinnati became a subscriber to the amount of $200,000. Some counties through which the road passed made liberal donations, and the right of way was in many cases donated to the company by the land-owners. But the company met with great difficulties and discouragements. The road was built amid the doubts of many of the feasibility of railroads, the opposition of some and the most depressing financial embarrassments of the company. The State first promised assistance and afterward withdrew its proffered aid. Subscriptions by farmers were paid in cattle and other live stock, which were disposed of by the company often at a sacrifice to meet the more pressing demands of creditors. With no money in the treasury, there were judgments against the company, executions in the hands of the Sheriff, levies on the machinery and tools of the company, the road and fixtures in the hands of a trustee. The laborers with the shovel and pick surrounded the house of the Treasurer, William Lewis, of Fulton, demanding pay. But the courage of the President, Gov. Morrow, never gave way. He gave his time and energies for the success of the road and refused to accept compensation for his services. Laboring with a comparatively empty treasury, the company succeeded in pushing forward the work slowly. The work of construction was commenced in 1837; in December, 1841, the road was completed from Fulton to Milford, a distance of fifteen miles; some months later the road was completed to Foster's Crossings; in July, 1844, the first cars were seen in Deerfield; five months more, and they had reached the mouth of Todd's Fork; in August, 1845, the road was completed to Xenia, and, on the 10th of August, 1846, ten years after the road was chartered, the first train reached Springfield; and two years later, the Mad River & Lake Erie road united with the Little Miami at Springfield, making an uninterrupted railroad communication from the Ohio to the lake.\n\nIn the Cincinnati Gazette of December 15, 1841, was published the following account of the first grand excursion on the first railroad to Cincinnati:\n\n\"Fifteen miles of this road were opened yesterday. The company had invited the City Council and a large number of citizens to make a trip upon it, and a delightful one it was. The day, it is true, was overcast, but the excitement of the occasion, the conviction that now a work was commenced which would bind the extremes of the State together and give a new impulse to its prosperity, made all hearts glad and rendered the trip joyous in the extreme.\n\n\" No accident whatever occurred during the excursion. At 11 o'clock we left the bridge at Fulton, and in an hour and a half were at Milford. We were delayed some time at the first ascent, in consequence of the earth falling upon the track, but this only served to try and prove the power of the engine for, notwithstanding the obstruction, it bore us safely through on an ascent of 125 feet to the mile. At Milford, we tarried near an hour, and while there, such of the citizens of that flourishing town as chose, were taken on a short excursion, while those of us who had gone up, rested awhile on terra firma-\n\nHISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY - 291\n\nAfter this, we started on our return home, and reached Fulton in a little over an hour in safety.\n\n\" We have not time to go into detail, or to speak at length of this railroad. We cannot forbear, however, to thank those who, through good and evil report, persevered in urging this enterprise forward. They have acted nobly and well; and the day is not far distant when all will admit, as we believe, that this is one of the most important works which have been undertaken for Cincinnati and Ohio.\n\n\" We felt strongly, as we were whirled along at rapid pace, what a change a few years had caused in this glorious West. There were men with us who could tell the tales of Indian warfare, of the hardships of our pioneer fathers, of the isolated condition of the new settlement, with all its dangers and difficulties and trials, and yet in their day they have lived to see the power of science turning this wilderness into a garden, and bringing distant points together as if 'they were one neighborhood. All honor to the enterprise and energy of that people who can work such wonderful changes.\n\n“The names of the engine and cars were appropriate. It was the blending of State and National affection. The engine was called Gov. Morrow, reminding us of Ohio, and of what self-energy can accomplish; while the name of James Madison, inscribed on the leading car, enforced the doctrine taught by his life—that State enterprise could only succeed while the people of a State were united together in harmony and affection.\"\n\nAfter the trial trip in December, 1841, the road between Cincinnati and Milford was open to traffic, and daily trips were made, but it was two years later before any report of the operations was made. In December, 1843, the first annual report to _ the stockholders was made by Jeremiah Morrow, President of the company. At this time, twenty-eight miles of road were in daily use, and the company owned one locomotive, two passenger cars, eight freight cars and three hand cars; 11,271 passengers were carried during the year, and the President reported that, with the machinery on hand, it was impossible to run the train regularly or do the business offered.\n\nWhen the road was located along the bank of the Little Miami, it was believed that the numerous flour-mills along that stream would furnish an important part of the freight to be carried. The methods of constructing . and operating a railroad at that time were far different from those now followed, and railroad travel was far less safe and comfortable than it is at the present time. The Little Miami was first constructed with wooden rails laid with strap iron. In 1844, the President congratulated the company that, in the last contracts for iron, the size had been increased to a width of two and one-half inches by a thickness of seven-eighths of an inch. Some miles of the road were first laid with poplar rails, which proved unfit for the purpose, and soon were taken up and replaced with white-oak rails. About 1848, the old flat-bar iron was removed and replaced with the heavy Trail. Notwithstanding all the difficulties under which the road was operated, the President, in his second annual report, when but thirty miles were in use, said that the doubts of the advantages of railroad transportation had been already dispelled by the convincing evidence of facts. The price of all marketable commodities along the line had been increased, and, in a great measure, equalized, and wheat had, for some time, commanded the same price at every point on the road as in Cincinnati.\n\nThe Little Miami became an important railway. It became known as one if the safest and best managed railroads in the United States. It was long under the able superintendence of W. H. Clement. In 1869, the entire road was leased to the Pittsburg, Cincinnati & St. Louis Railway Company for\n\n292 - HISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY.\n\nninety-nine years, renewable forever, at an annual rental of $480,000-eight per cent of its capital stock.\n\nVery different was the history of the second railroad built to Cincinnati, the Great Miami, or Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton, nhich also touched our county. It was constructed in a little more than one year after it was put under contract. In one month a cash subscription was obtained for it in Cincinnati of three-quarters of a million of dollars, and its bonds sold at par from the start. For, when this road was commenced, in 1848, the practicability of railroads was fully settled.\n\nThe Hillsboro & Cincinnati Railroad Company was chartered in 1846, and, a few years after, had its road completed from Hillsboro to Loveland-a distance of thirty-seven miles. In 1861, this road was purchased by the Marietta & Cincinnati Railroad Company. Ten and one-half miles of this line are in Warren County.\n\nThe Cincinnati, Wilmington & Zanesville Railroad Company was chartered in 1851. The road was opened for traffic in July, 1856. The line extended from Zanesville to Morrow, about ten miles of which are in Warren County. In 1870, this road was purchased by the Cincinnati & Muskingum Valley Railway Company.\n\nThe Cincinnati & Springfield Railway Company was projected in 1870, for the purpose of building a road to form, in connection with other railroads already constructed, a trunk line from Cincinnati to the Eastern cities. The sum of $265,000 was subscribed and offered as a donation to this company to secure the location of the road through Lebanon, but without success. The road was built through Dayton and Franklin. Only about four and one-half miles of this road are in Warren County.\n\nThe Cincinnati Northern Railway Company, having, in 1879, purchased at judicial sale, the uncompleted road of the Miami Valley Narrow Gauge Railway Company from Cincinnati to Waynesville, for $61,000, constructed a three-feet gauge road, and commenced the running of one train daily between Lebanon and Norwood, on May 30, 1881.\n\nThe Toledo, Delphos & Burlington Railroad was completed to tile junction with the Cincinnati Northern, December 20, 1881.\n\nThere are now within the county limits seven railroads and eighty-five miles of track, exclusive of sidings and double track.\n\nPOST OFFICES.\n\nThere were no post offices within the limits of Warren County for more than eight years after the settlements were commenced. Cincinnati was for several years the post office for the whole Miami Valley. At the beginning of the present century, letters were advertised as remaining in the post office at Cincinnati addressed as follows: \" John Bigger, Fourth Range; \" \" Thomas Espy, Little Miami; \" \" John Wallace, School Master, Turtle Creek; \" \" Moses Crane, Fourth Range; \" others were addressed \" Bailey's Station,\" \" Below the Big Miami,\" \" Duck Creek,\" \" Big Prairie,\" etc.\n\nWithin two years after the organization of the State Government, four post offices were established in Warren County, viz.: at Waynesville, Deerfield, Franklin and Lebanon. Ten years then elapsed before any others were established. In 1812, Montgomery, in Hamilton County, was made a post office, and it accommodated a portion of the people of Warren living in the southwestern part of the county.\n\nThe first mail between Cincinnati and Pittsburgh was carried in a canoe, in February, 1794. A line of row-boats was established in that year between those points, with relays at different stations, to carry the mail. The first\n\nHISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY - 293\n\nmails to post offices in Warren County were carried by a post-rider. The route was frcm Cincinnati to Lebanon, Xenia, Urbana, thence across to Piqua, and down through Dayton, Franklin and Hamilton to Cincinnati, taking a week to make the trip. The people thought themselves fortunate in having a weekly mail for some years. The mail was carried by post-riders until about the year 1825, when stage lines were started with the mails.\n\nThere are persons still living who can remember when the postage on a letter, which must be written on a single sheet of paper, between Cincinnati and New Orleans, was 25 cents, and the freight on a barrel of flour between the same points was sometimes below that figure. Most men at that time would have regarded our present mail facilities an impossibility, and especially would the prediction that letters would one day be carried from Maine to California for three cents have been regarded as a Utopian dream.\n\nThe following complete list of all the post offices in Warren County, dates of their establishment and names of the first Postmasters, was prepared by George W.

It is proposed in this place to narrate, with some regard to chronological order, some facts concerning the bench and the bar of the county not elsewhere recorded. The sketch must necessarily be imperfect.\n\nThe legal business of the earliest pioneers of the county for eight years after its first settlement was transacted at Cincinnati. In 1796, there were nine practicing attorneys at Cincinnati, all of whom, except two, became confirmed drunkards, and descended to premature graves. Many of the early lawyers of Cincinnati who continued long in the practice attended the courts at Lebanon after the organization of Warren County. Judge Jacob Burnet says:\n\n\" It was always my opinion that there was a fair proportion of genius and talent among the early members of the bar. Some of them, it is true, were uneducated, and had to acquire their legal knowledge, after they assumed the profession. These were not numerous, but were noisy and officious, and, for some time, were able to procure a considerable amount of practice. This may be accounted for, in part, by the fact that the docket contained a large number of actions for slander, and assault and battery, and indictments for larceny, libels and the like, which generally originated among the followers of the army, who were numerous, consisting of pack-horsemen, bullock-drivers, boatman and artificers, who were not always very discriminating in the selection of counsel.\"\n\nThe attorney who prosecuted pleas in behalf of the State was appointed by the Supreme Court. Daniel Symmes, of .Cincinnati, a nephew of Judge John Cleves Symmes, was appointed to discharge that duty at the first term of the Court of Common Pleas in Warren County, and prepared the indictments returned by the Grand Jury at that term. The sum of $20 was the usual allowance at that time for prosecuting pleas in behalf of the State at each term. Daniel Symmes served as Prosecuting Attorney in this county for a single term. He soon after became Speaker of the State Senate, and, in 1805, one of the Judges of the Supreme Court of Ohio.\n\nArthur St. Clair, Jr., also of Cincinnati, succeeded Daniel Symmes as Prosecuting Attorney in the courts of Warren County, and held the same position in some of the adjoining counties. He is said to have appeared in court with a cocked hat and a sword. He was a son of the Territorial Governor, Gen. Arthur St. Clair, and was a gentleman of culture and a lawyer of ability. Although he was not a resident of Warren County, yet, as he was for several years conspicuous in the administration of justice in this county. the following facts concerning him, communicated by Judge Burnet to the Western Law Jaurnul in 1843, are here quoted:\n\n\"Arthur St. Clair was a native of Pennsylvania. He had been well educated, and was, moreover, a regular bred lawyer. Immediately after he came to Cincinnati, his father appointed him Attorney Gene-al for the Northwestern Territory, the duties of which office he performed acceptably to all concerned till it was abolished by the formation of a State Government. His manners were polished, his deportment popular, his talents highly respectable, and be supported an honorable standing at the bar. He was distinguished for great candor, which, it was supposed, he sometimes carried unnecessarily far. In 1799, he was a competitor with Gen. Harrison, then Secretamy of the Territory,\n\n295 - PICTURE OF JOHN E. DEY\n\n296 - BLANK\n\nHISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY - 297\n\nfor the appointment of delegate to Congress, but failed to succeed by a single vote. Having acquired an independent fortune, principally by the rise of property, he retired from the bar. Unfortunately, he had been intemperate, and consequently more liable to be imposed on. His acquaintances, taking advantage of this circumstance, and of the natural kindness of his disposition, obtained his indorsements to an amount which eventually absorbed his estate, and consigned a helpless widow and family of children to poverty and want.\"\n\nIt is worthy of note that Francis Dunlevy, the first President Judge of the circuit which embraced Cincinnati and the southwestern third of the State, was not a regularly educated lawyer, nor was he admitted to the bar until after his retirement from the bench. He was, however, a classical scholar, and had served as a member of the convention which formed the State Constitution, and of the Territorial and State Legislatures. He practiced law some years after his retirement from the bench.\n\nJoshua Collett, the first resident lawyer of the county, had studied law in Martinsburg, Va. He came to Lebanon soon after the organization of the county.\n\nRichard S. Thomas commenced the practice at Lebanon in 1804 or 1805. He represented the Warren District in the State Senate in 1806, 1807 and 1808. In 1809, he received, in the joint session of the Legislature, twenty-nine votes for United States Senator, but was defeated by Alexander Campbell, who re- ceived thirty-eight votes. Mr. Thomas moved from Lebanon to the West about 1810. He became a Circuit Judge in Illinois.\n\nJohn McLean was admitted to the bar in the autumn of 1807, and com- menced practice at Lebanon. His public life soon took him from the bar. He was elected to Congress in 1812, and 'became Judge of the Supreme Court of Ohio in 1816.\n\nWilliam McLean, a brother of John, was an early lawyer at Lebanon. He removed from Lebanon to Piqua, and was elected to Congress from Miami County, serving from 1823 to 1829. About the year 1829, he returned to Leb- anon, and again practiced his profession.\n\nThomas Freeman came to the Lebanon bar from Cincinnati about 1809. He was a native of Pennsylvania, and practiced law with success in the Miami Circuit. His professional career was short. He died in 1818 from injuries received on being thrown from a horse, in the thirty-ninth year of his age.\n\nJacob D. Miller, a promising lawyer at Lebanon, died in early manhood, while representing Warren County in the State Senate, in the year 1827.\n\nThomas R. Ross who had studied law at Philadelphia, commenced practice in Lebanon in 1810, and was first elected to Congress in 1818. Phineas Ross, a brother of Thomas, was also a prominent early lawyer at Lebanon. He served for some time as Cashier of the Lebanon Miami Banking Company.\n\nJacoby Hallack was for twenty years a practicing member of the bar, and for several terms a member of the Legislature.\n\nThomas Corwin and A. H. Dunlevy came to the bar in 1817, and George J. Smith in 1820.\n\nBenjamin Collett was one of the brightest lights of the Lebanon bar. Judge R. B. Harlan thus writes of him: \"In my view, Ben Collett is entitled to be placed as a lawyer above all the lawyers of my acquaintance. If men have a natural genius for anything in particular, he had for the law. Apparently a slow thinker, he was the most ready man in the discussion of legal subjects that I ever listened to, and when he had closed an argument upon a legal question, nothing remained to be said on that side of the subject. His Superiority on law questions over all his cotemporaries practicing at our bar Was universally conceded. He had such a thorough knowledge of every branch\n\n298 - HISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY.\n\nof the law as to easily make himself master of any question respecting it. He himself attributed his knowledge of the law to his having studied principles instead of mere cases. His earnest advice to young lawyers was to study the great principles on which the law is founded. His whole soul was in his profession. The books he read were mostly law books. He was a man of excellent temper. I never saw him out of humor, or heard him use discourteous language to court or bar, party or witness.\" This talented lawyer fell a victim to intemperance, and was cut off in the prime of life. He died June 24, 1831, aged thirty-eight years.\n\nFor twenty-five years after the organization of the county, not more than six members of the bar residing in Lebanon appear to have been engaged in active practice at any one time. The foregoing list, brief as it seems, is believed to contain the name of every attorney in the county who made a reputation at the bar or was engaged in the practice of law for any considerable time previous to 1825. There were doubtless others who became members of the bar and opened offices in the county and afterward retired to other fields of labor or removed to other localities.\n\nIn 1830, attorneys and physicians were subject to a tax of five mills on each dollar of their annual income. The records of the County Commissioners contain a list of the attorneys practicing in Warren County that year. At that time, John McLean was a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States; Joshua Collet, Judge of the Supreme Court of Ohio; and George J. Smith, President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas. The following is the list of practicing attorneys: Thomas R. Ross, Phineas Ross, Benjamin Collett, Thomas Corwin, Francis Dunlevy, A. H. Dunlevy, William McLean and Jacoby Hallack. The sum of $750 is placed opposite each name as the income from the practice of law for the year, excepting those of Thomas Corwin and Jacoby Hallack, the income for the former being placed at $1,000, and that of the latter at $500. As the figures were merely estimates by the Commissioners, and not returns made by the attorneys themselves, they lose much of their value as evidences of the real profits of the profession fifty years ago.\n\nThe changes made in ten years will appear from the following list of practicing attorneys in 1840: Simon Su.ydam, J. Milton Williams, George J. Smith, John Probasco, Jr., A. H. Dunlevy, Robert G. Corwin, Thomas Corwin, Asahel Brown, Franklin Corwin, and, at Franklin. John W. Caldwell.\n\nThe following is the list for 1850: George J. Smith, J. Milton Williams, A. H. Dunlevy, E. Hutchinson, Durbin Ward, William S. Mickle, Lauren Smith, Robert G. Corwin, A. G. McBurney, John C. Dunlevy, J. Kelly O'Neall, James M. Smith and Horace M. Stokes. At this time, John Probasco, Jr., was President Judge.\n\nAmong the law firms of former years may be mentioned Ross & Corwin, consisting of Phineas Ross and Thomas Corwin; McLean & Smith, consisting of William McLean and George J. Smith; Williams & Collett, consisting of J. Milton Williams and William R. Collett; Corwin & Ward, consisting of Thomas Corwin and Durbin Ward; and later, a firm consisting of Thomas and R. G. Corwin and A. G. McBurney; Smith & Probasco, consisting of George J. Smith and John Probasco, Jr.; Dunlevy & Thompson, consisting of A. H. Dunlevy and Thomas F. Thompson.\n\nRiding the circuit was the uniform custom of the early lawyers, whether they were old in the profession and had an established practice, or were young, briefless, and perhaps penniless, members, in search of business. They traveled on horseback, with their saddle-bags under them, an overcoat and umbrella strapped behind the saddle, and leggings well spattered with mud, tied with strings below the knees. Traveling the circuit became less common in the dec-\n\nHISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY - 299\n\nade between 1830 and 1840, and finally ceased. Subsequent to 1840, it was continued only by the older lawyers, who had established a practice in the different counties of the circuit which made the toilsome journey, which took thorn away from their homes a considerable portion of the year, a remunerative one. Ferguson's Tavern, in Lebanon, which stood immediately east of the old court house, was a favorite stopping-place of the lawyers in the olden time. Here, in court terms, Jacob Burnet. Nicholas Longworth, Joseph S. Benham and Thomas Morris met Corwin, the Colletts and the Rosses, and the evenings were enlivened with mirth and jollity.\n\nLawyers' fees were low in the early days of Ohio. A charge of hundreds of dollars for an attorney's services in a single case was rare. A fee of $1,000 was almost unknown. Ejectment suits, which most frequently arose from disputed land boundaries in the Virginia Military District east of the Little Miami, were perhaps the most profitable part of the early lawyers' practice. It may be safely assumed that for twenty-five years after the organization of courts at Lebanon, $750, which was for much of that time the salary of the President Judge, was above rather than below the average annual income of a lawyer in full practicein Warren County. With the growth of population and wealth of the county, the profits of the practice of law increased.\n\nIn 1836, Judge George J. Smith was retired from the bench to the ranks of the profession by reason of a change in the political complexion of the Legislature. His salary as President Judge had been but $1,000. The Judge in after years sometimes amused his friends by relating to them the anxiety by which he was oppressed on being deposed from his office, and the concern which he felt lest he should. not be able to provide a maintenance for his family by his practice at the bar, from which he had been withdrawn for seven years. His forebodings, however, proved unfounded, as his receipts from his practice during the first year after its resumption exceeded $3,000.\n\nThe salary of the Judge of the Court of Common Pleas was fixed, in 1803, at $750; in 1816, at $1,000; in 1837, at $1,200; in 1852, at $1,500; and in 1867, at $2,500.\n\nSo far as is known, all the older members of the profession in the county were opposed to the adoption of the reformed method of civil procedure which was enacted by the Ohio Legislature in 1853. It had been under discussion in the State since its adoption in New York in 1848. It has since been adopted by more than twenty American States and Territories, and has been accepted by the British Parliament. The old system of pleading, with its conflicting and confusing distinctions in the forms of remedial actions, had long remained one of the greatest and most unnecessary burdens on the administration of justice, both in England and America. It had originated at a remote period, and was possibly contrived for the purpose of securing to the favored few the exclusive administration of justice. The style used in pleading was awkward and clumsy from the use of unmeaning phrases, and was redundant in the use of synonyms and repetitions. The old lawyers, familiar with the artificial and technical rules of the old system. had learned to admire even its fictions, circumlocutions and contradictions, and taught it to their students as the perfection of reason and the most beautiful of human sciences. In the opinion of Edmund Burke, the science of law \" does more to quicken and in- 7,1gorate the understanding than all other kinds of learning put together, but t is not apt, except in those happily born to open and liberalize the mind in exactly the same proportion.\" The lawyer's habit of constantly appealing to authorities horities and precedents is not the most favorable to the development of the true spirit of progress. Certain it is that the most needed reforms in the law make slow progress. Even after the enactment of the code of civil procedure\n\n300 - HISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY.\n\nby the Legislature, the full measure of the reform intended by it was not experienced by the profession in this county. The older and leading lawyers, whose habits of thought had been formed under the former system, made the new practice conform to the old as far as possible. Judge Nash's work on pleading and practice was for many years in general use by the profession in this county. This author was an avowed enemy of the code system of practice, and confessedly resorted to the old precedents for his forms, and substantially followed them. A generation, however, has made great changes. Experience has given proof of the wisdom of reforming the practice, and to-day not a lawyer educated under the code system would be willing to go back to the common law pleading.\n\nBelow is given a list of the President Judges of the Court of Common Pleas of the circuits in which Warren County was placed under the constitu- tion of 1802, and the Common Pleas Judges of the subdivision of the judicial district of which the county was a part under the constitution of 1852:\n\nPRESIDENT JUDGES UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OF 1802.\n\nFrancis Dunlevy, of Warren County, 1803-1817.\n\nJoshua Collett, of Warren County, 1817-1829.\n\nGeorge J: Smith, of Warren County, 1829-1836.\n\nBenjamin Hinkson, of Clinton County, 1836-1843.\n\nElijah Vance. of Butler County, 1843-1850.\n\nJohn Probasco, Jr., of Warren County, 1850-1852.\n\nCOMMON PLEAS JUDGES UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OF 1852.\n\nWilliam A.

He was at Columbia as early as 1796, and, in that year, in connection with John Smith and Samuel Heighway, entered into a contract with John C. Symmes for the purchase of a large tract of land in the vicinity of Waynesville. He was present in the spring of 1796 when the first clearing in the woods was made at Waynesville, and it is believed that as soon as the population was such as to support a physician, he began the practice at that place. Francis Baily, in his journal of travels in North America in 1796 and 1797, gives an interesting account of his adventures in hunting bears in connection with Dr. Banes, in the forests about Waynesville, in the spring of 1797. Baily calls him Dr. Bean, but the name is written Banes in legal documents on record at Lebanon, and by his descendants in Clark County at this day. Dr. Banes was a native of Pennsylvania, studied medicine with Dr-\n\nHISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY - 301\n\nRush, of Philadelphia, practiced his profession at Waynesville until 1811, when he removed to Clark County, where he died November 3, 1827.\n\nThe following is the professional card of the first physician who settled in the Turtle Creek settlement. It appeared for seven weeks in the Western Spy, published at Cincinnati, beginning in February, 1801:\n\nJohn C. Winans, lately arrived from Elizabethtown, N. J., with a general assortment of medicines, respectfully tenders his services to the public in the line of his profession as physician and surgeon. Those who may have occasion and are disposed to call on him, inpy find him at the Rev. Mr. Kemper's, on Turtle Creek, where he has opened his shop and is now in a capacity to serve them.\n\nDr. Winans was, for four years subsequent to 1801, the only physician residing in the vicinity of Lebanon.\n\nDr. David Morris was born near Reading, Penn., in 1769; he settled near Lebanon in 1805, and practiced his profession, He first settled about two miles northwest of the town; in 1816, he moved into Lebanon and continued the practice. In 1818, he moved to Brookville, Ind., where he remained one year; returning to Lebanon, he continued in the practice. In 1832, he moved to a farm, two and one-half miles west of Lebanon, where he died, in 1850, of asthma, aged eighty-one years. He was at one time a member of the Legisla- ture. Dr. Morris was a brother of the distinguished United States Senator, Thomas Morris, of Clermont County.\n\nDr. Benjamin Dubois settled near Franklin in 1806, and practiced until his death, in 1851; he came from Monmouth County, N. J.\n\nDr. Joseph Canby practiced medicine in. Warren County as early as 1810. He practiced at Lebanon for twenty years. His name occurs in five different acts of the Legislature among the Censors appointed for the examination of applicants for license to practice medicine.\n\nDr. John S. Haller removed from Lebanon, where he had practiced a short time, and settled in the practice at Franklin about 1818. He died in 1875, having practiced until within ten years of his death.\n\nDr. John Cottle came to what is now Maineville in 1818, and practiced from that time until 1843. From 1818 until about 1830, he was the only physician in Hamilton Township. He was a native of Maine and had practiced eight years before coming to Ohio. He died in 1853.\n\nDr. J. W. Lanier practiced at Franklin for several years succeeding 1811.\n\nDr. Jeptha F. Moore, a Methodist preacher, practiced medicine at Lebanon for about ten years, beginning in 1812.\n\nDr. Martin Lathrop commenced practice at Waynesville about 1812, and died about eight years later. He was succeeded by his nephew, Dr. Horace\n\nDr. Calvin Morrill was a physician among the Shakers, at Union Village, from a very early day. He came from New Jersey and died at Union Village in 1833, in his sixty-ninth year.\n\nDr. Charles D. Hampton was born in Pennsylvania in 1792, came to Ohio in 1815, and practiced a short time at Cincinnati. In 1817, he moved to Clarksville, Clinton Co., Ohio, and, in 1822, joined the Shakers at Union Village. He practiced exclusively among the Shakers until his death, in 1863. He was a man of strong intellect.\n\nDr. Otho Evans, Sr., began the practice at Franklin, in April, 1827. Before this he had practiced in Butler County, Ohio, for some six years. He was born in Kentucky September 9, 1797; removed to Ohio in 1800. He was \"gaged in the practice for forty years.\n\nDr. John Van Harlingen was in the active practice in Warren County for half a century. He was born near New Brunswick, N. J., February 19,\n\n302 - HISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY.\n\n1792. His ancestors were emigrants from Holland. The Dutch language was, spoken in his father's family, and John learned to speak no other tongue until his eighth year. He was educated in New Brunswick, and graduated at Rut- ger's College in 1809. Having read medicine in New Brunswick, and attended a full course of lectures at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of New York City, he was licensed to practice by the State authorities of New Jersey, after passing the examination of the Censors of Middlesex and Somerset Counties in 1812. He practiced five years in his native State, and in 1817 moved with his family to Lebanon, Ohio. He was engaged in the practice of medicine at that place and its vicinity for a longer period than any other person in the history of the town. In obstetrics, to which he particularly devoted himself, both in New Jersey and Ohio, his practice was very large and successful. This department of the practice, on his arrival in Warren County, he found almost exclusively in the hands of women. Dr. Van Harlingen's skill did much to take this important art out of the hands of empirics, and to place it in the hands of intelligent medical practitioners. He did not neglect other depart- ments of his profession, and through the long years of his professional life, his labors were varied and arduous. He made journeys to distant parts of the county and to surrounding counties in the saddle by day and by night in the most inclement seasons; he endangered his life in crossing the flooded Miami when it was bridgeless; he passed successive days without sleep; but such were the strength of his constitution and his powers of endurance, that he has the full possession of his mental and physical faculties at the ripe age of ninety years. He retired from active practice about the year 1866.\n\nDr: Joshua Stevens was born near the village of Winthrop, Me., March 21, 1794. His early pursuits were farming and brick-laying. He had the advantages of a plain common-school education, which he greatly improved by diligent self-study. On the 4th of July, 1817, he left Maine and opened a -select boarding-school at Bristol, near Philadelphia. Here he commenced the study of medicine, and subsequently entered the office of Dr. Joseph Parrish. of Philadelphia. He also attended the lectures of the medical department of the university, during the winters of 1818-19-20, and, without waiting to graduate, entered upon practice in Philadelphia. He decided to come West, and, in 1821, with two or three friends, floated down the Ohio in a flat-bot- tomed boat, bearing letters of introduction to Dr. Daniel Drake, of Cincinnati. He intended to locate in that city, but he became engaged in the practice at Monroe, Butler Co., Ohio, near which village he had relatives residing. In 1830, the Medical College of Ohio conferred upon him the honorary degree of M. D. In 1847, he removed to Lebanon, where he resided until his death Dr. Stevens performed a vast amount of professional labor and enjoyed the confidence and esteem of his patrons and professional friends. He was a reader of medical journals and new books, and a frequent contributor to both journals and societies. He took an active part in the old \"District\" Medical Society, and for years was its President; afterward, he was for more than ten years President of the Lebanon Medical Society. He was a member of the Methodist Church. About seven years before his death, he was thrown from his buggy while making a professional visit. The accident produced concussion of the brain, from the effects of which he never fully recovered. He died at Lebanon May 2,1871.\n\nDr. Moses H. Keever was born in Warren County, Ohio, April 28,1810. He was educated at Oxford, Ohio, and Augusta, Ky. When nineteen years old, he commenced reading medicine with Dr. Joshua Stevens, at Monro̊. where he continued some three years. He graduated at the Ohio Medical College in 1834, and the same year began the practice near Ridgeville. For some thirteen years he was associated in the practice with Dr. W. H. Stokes, and\n\nHISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY - 303\n\nafterward, with Dr. J. B. Hough. Dr. Keever was an intelligent, energetic and successful medical practitioner.\n\nDr. Joseph G. Paulding commenced practicing in Deerfield Townshiy about 1838. In 1844, he was sent by the Associate Reformed Church, of which be was a member, as missionary to Palestine. In connection with his brother- in-law, Rev. James Barnett, he assisted in establishing missions at Damascus and Cairo. Returning to this country in 1854, he took up his old practice at Mason, where he continued, with the exception of some time spent in the army, during the civil war, until his health compelled him to retire from the practice. In 1871, he removed to Piqua, where he died in 1874. Dr. Paulding was highly esteemed as a man of science and a Christian gentleman.\n\nDr. Jesse Harvey commenced the practice in Harveysburg in 1830. He was a native of North Carolina, but received his education in Ohio. He was distinguished for his knowledge of the natural sciences, zeal in the cause 01 education and his philanthropic efforts to elevate the negro and Indian races. In 1847, he went as a missionary of the Society of Friends to the Shawnee Indians of Kansas Territory, where he died the next year, in the forty-seventh year of age.\n\nDr. Jonathan W. Davis was born in Greene County, Ohio, on the 8th of July, 1821. He attended school but little during the early part of his life, being compelled to spend the most of his time in labor upon the farm. At the age of twenty-two, however, he had acquired a good English education, and soon after commenced the study of medicine under the instructions of Dr. Edmund Hawes, of Mount Holly. He became a member of the Lebanon Medical Society in 1816, and, the next year, received the degree of M. D., conferred by the Ohio Medical College, having attended two courses of lectures at that institution. He commenced the practice of medicine at Waynesville. During the prevalence of epidemic cholera, in the summer of 1849, his labors were exten- sive and almost incessant. While engaged in the discharge of his professional duty, at the distance of five miles from home, he was attacked by that dread disease at 6 o'clock P. M., July 26,1849. He ran his horse home and died at 3 o'clock the next morning. Thus, after an illness of just nine hours, died a promising physician, in the twenty-ninth year of his age. He was a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nLIST OF PHYSICIANS OF WARREN COUNTY TAXED ON THEIR INCOMES IN 1830.\n\nTurtle Creek Township—David Morris, John Ross, John Van Harlingen, Caleb B.

The State was divided into districts and Censors were appointed in each district with authority to grant licenses to practice medicine and surgery. The first of these acts was passed in 1811, when the whole State was divided into five districts. The Censors named in the act for the district in which Warren County was placed were Dr. Joseph Canby, of Warren County; Dr. Richard Allison and Dr. Daniel Drake. Dr. Canby held ,the position of Censor for most of the time up to 1824. In 1812, Dr. David Morris, of Warren, was appointed Censor. In the act of 1813, Dr. Joseph Canby and Dr. Jeptha F. Moore were appointed; and the same names occur in the act of 1817. In 1821, Dr. Joseph Canby is the only physician of Warren named. In 1824, Warren and Greene Counties were placed together in a district, and the following named physicians of the two counties were named as members of the Third Medical Society of Ohio, with authority to grant licenses to practice medicine, viz., Joseph Canby, John Ross, David Morris, Benjamin Dubois, James Johnson Joshua Martin, John Van Harlingen, John Collet, Jehu John, James W. Lanier, John S. Haller and George W. Stipp.\n\nThe medical system of the noted New England empiric, Samuel Thompson, was introduced into Warren County about 1826. It was termed the Botanic system, or Thompsonian system. Steaming a patient for the purpose of producing perspiration was such an important branch of the practice that the followers were frequently called steam doctors. They were also popularly termed herb or root doctors. The practitioners purchased Dr. Thompson's \"New Guide to Health, or Botanic Family Physician, containing a complete system of practice upon a plan entirely new,\" with a patent right to the system, and, without any previous course of study, they were prepared for the practice of medicine. The system was extensively introduced in Ohio between the years 1825 and 1835. Dr. Thompson's book and patent right to the system were sold at $20, and the publishers of the book at Columbus, Ohio, put forth the statement that Thompson's agents disposed of 4,319 copies in three and a half years preceding 1832, and that Dr. Thompson's share of the proceeds of his Western agency for that time was $17,500. The most important article used in Dr.\n\nThompson's practice was lobelia, which he called the emetic herb, and the medicinal virtues of which he claimed to have discovered. The following extract from the \" Botanic Physician\" gives the doctor's prescription of a stock of medicines for a family: \"One ounce of the emetic herb, two ounces of cayenne, one-half pound bayberry root bark in powder, one pound poplar bark, one pint of the rheumatic drops. This stock will be sufficient for a family for one year, with such articles as they can easily procure themselves when wanted, and will enable the into cure any disease which a family of common size may be afflicted with during that time. The expenses will be small and much better than to employ a doctor, and have his extravagant bill to pay.\" It is impossible to learn at this\n\n305 - PICTURE OF DAVID GRAHAM\n\n306 - BLANK\n\nHISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY - 307\n\ntime how many of the practitioners of this empiricism were to be found in this cointy. They were probably most numerous in Ohio about 1832.. Their prac- tice was by no means confined to the less intelligent portion of the inhabitants, but their system soon fell into contempt. The Physio-Medical School of Thera- peutics of later years, whose medical college was at Cincinnati, acknowledged its indebtedness to the labors and discoveries of Samuel Thompson, and paid greater respect to his memory than any other modern medical school. The name of Elder Wilson Thompson, an early Baptist preacher at Lebanon, who practiced medicine, as well as divinity, has been associated with the Thomp- sonian Botanic System, but his practice does not seem to have been identical with that of Samuel Thompson.\n\nThe earlier regular doctors were of the heroic school, and made liberal use of the lancet and calomel. In their treatment, they relied on purging, bleeding,.blistering and salivation. The quantities of calomel sold by druggists to some physicians of the last generation, as shown by accounts still in existence, are sufficient to startle the modern scientific practitioner.\n\nThe medical system of Hahnemann was not introduced into the United States until 1825, and it did not have practitioners in Warren County until twenty-five years later. Thomas W. Cuscaden, M. D., who died at Lebanon in 1861, aged thirty years, was probably the first resident homeopathist in the county. Of recent years, there have been six or seven homeopathic physicians practicing in the county.\n\nThe Eclectic School of Medicine has never had numerous representatives in Warren. Mrs. R. L. V. Anton, M. D., of this school, who commenced the practice with her husband, James Anton, M. D., at Lebanon in 1859, was the first female physician with a diploma in the esbunty.\n\nTHE LEBANON MEDICAL SOCIETY.\n\nOn the 28th of October, 1837, in pursuance of a call addressed to the scientific practitioners of Warren and adjoining counties, the following per- sons met in Lebanon and organized the Lebanon Medical Society, viz., Henry Baker, John Van Harlingen, John P. Haggott, Otho Evans, John Cottle, Alvin McAllister, Joshua Stevens, William M. Charters, David Baird, J. P. Compton, Lewis Drake, Elias Fisher, Jesse Harvey, S. M. Ballard, W. B. Strout, Lucius A. Cottle, Benjamin Erwin, Moses H. Keever, Aaron Wright and R. Roach. Dr. Joshua Stevens was elected President, and Dr. John Van Harlingen, Recording Secretary. The society resolved to abide by the rules and regulations adopted, and to use all honorable means to discountenance quackery, and recommended a general attendance at the meetings of the State Medical Society.\n\nThe second meeting of the society was held January 30, 1838, when a constitution and by-laws, a code of ethics and a bill of prices were adopted_ A. committee was appointed to prepare a memorial to the Legislature for the repeal of the law taxing physicians. The society was incorporated by an act of the General Assembly passed in 1837. Within two years after its organization, the society numbered twenty-eight members. The meetings were held semi-annually, and were generally well attended, from twelve to twenty mem- bers usually being present at each meeting. An attempt was made to enforce attendance by fines. The minutes of 1839 show that a member was fined $5 for absence and failure to read a dissertation, and memberships were forfeited for non-payment of fines. The society early secured a seal to be affixed to diplomas granted to the members. The diplomas were printed, not in Latin, but in English. Standing committees were appointed on the subjects of \"Quack- ery,\" \"Collateral Sciences\" and \"Improvements in the Science of Medicine.\" Besides reports on these subjects, there were papers read at early meetings as\n\n308 - HISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY.\n\nfollows: On \" Geology,\" by Dr. Aaron Wright; \"Phenomena, Characterizing the Separate and Independent Existence of Mind,\" by Dr. D. Baird; \" Deleterious Effects and Chemical Tests of Arsenic,\" by Dr. John P. Haggott; \" Congestive Fever,\" by Dr. Joshua Stevens; \"Diseases of Harveysburg,\" by Dr. Jesse Harvey. and \" Sanguineous Congestion,\" by Dr. William M. Charters.\n\nIn 1838, the society passed the following:\n\nResolved, That no applicant who has not acquired a competent knowledge of chemistry, natural philosophy, botany and comparative anatomy, shall receive the diploma of this society.\n\nResolved, That it is the opinion of this society that no medical school ought to confer the degree of Doctor in Medicine on any candidate who has not attained to a competent knowledge of all those branches of learning usually termed with reference to medicine, \"the Associate Sciences.\"\n\nThe Corresponding Secretary was instructed to open a correspondence with other societies, both medical and scientific, in the State, urging them to join in endeavors to have the geological survey of the State continued.\n\nIn October, 1839, it was resolved that \"the society appoint three members, whose duty it shall be to procure and preserve specimens of plants—including the whole plant—and specimens of minerals, each of whom shall deliver an address or lecture, one on Botany, one on Mineralogy and one on Geology, at three successive meetings—one addressing each meeting; said committee to be authorized to procure, at the expense of the society, such means for the safe keeping of whatever may be collected.\" In pursuance of this resolution, Dr. J. G. Paulding made reports at subsequent meetings on Botany and Dr. Jesse Harvey on Geology. Dr. Paulding exhibited a blank-book procured for the society for the preservation of botanical specimens. The members were earnestly requested to prepare and present to the society skeletons of different animals for the purpose of facilitating the study of Comparative Anatomy.\n\nIn 1840, the society resolved \"that hereafter applicants for admission shall present to the Censors either a diploma from some respectable medical college, or a certificate of membership in a respectable society of scientific physicians,. or submit to an examination by the Censors.\"\n\nIn October, 1842, it was resolved \" that it shall be deemed a breach of medical ethics for any member of this society to attend, in consultation with any physician, who has had an opportunity of becoming a member of this association, and has refused or neglected to embrace it.\" But, at the next meeting, in May, 1843. the resolution was rescinded and the following adopted in its place: \"It shall be deemed a breach of medical ethics for any member of this society to consult with any person who has not evidence of such qualifications as would entitle him to membership in this society.\"\n\nIn 1846, two members were expelled from the society for engaging in the sale of nostrums, the society being of the opinion \" that such traffic is decidedly prejudicial to the public welfare, and when in the hands of a physician, calculated to hinder the advancement of true science and depress the character of the medical profession.\"\n\nAt the October meeting of 1848, the society expressed its confidence in the purity of the pharmaceutical preparations of the Shakers at Union Village, and heartily commended them to the profession, especially the extracts of the narcotic plants and sarsaparilla. And, in May, 1849, it was resolved \" that this society, so far as practicable, will make no purchases from druggists engaged in the sale and manufacture of patent medicines.\" In the same year, by a unanimous vote, a member was expelled for compounding and vending certain medicines, which the society regarded as secret nostrums.\n\nThe meetings of the society were held regularly for a period of about thirty\" years. From various causes, about 1859 the profession began to lose interest\n\nHISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY - 309\n\nin the organization. There are no minutes of any meetings for the four years following 1859. On December 8, 1863„a meeting was held pursuant to a published call for the purpose of resuscitating the society. The organization was again placed on its feet, and from that time the meetings have been held with regularity. At times, it has been proposed to change the name to that of the Warren County Medical Society, but the charter has induced the members to retain the old name. Of recent years, the minutes give full abstracts of the discussions. Written essays have been read and verbal reports made of important cases treated by the members. The prevailing diseases and local epidemics have been considered and the leading questions connected with the progress of medicine discussed. In 1875, the number of members was twenty-four. The Presidents of the organization have been: Dr. Joshua Stevens, from 1837 to 1848; Dr. William M. Charters, 1849; Dr. Moses H. Keever, 1850; Dr. Elias Fisher, 1852; Dr. William L. Schenck, 1854; Dr. Joshua Stevens, 1856. Since the re-organization, in 1863, the Presidents have been Dr. John Van Harlingen, Dr. Adam Sellers, Dr. L. A. Cottle, Dr. J. L. Mounts, Dr. Isaac L. Drake, Dr. James McCready, of Monroe, Butler County; Dr. S. R. Voorhees and Dr. S. S. Scoville.\n\nTHE NEWSPAPER PRESS.\n\nIn the summer of 1806, John McLean, afterward Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, determined to establish a weekly newspaper at Lebanon. This was a hazardous enterprise, as Lebanon was as yet a small village, with the trees and bushes still growing upon most of its streets, and the whole county did not contain probably eight thousand souls. John McLean was married in the spring of 1807, and admitted to the bar in the autumn of the same year. The exact date of the issue of the first paper is unknown. The paper was called the Western Star. Nathaniel McLean, a younger brother of the editor and proprietor, who had learned the printing business in the office of the Liberty Hall, at Cincinnati, was one of the first printers who worked on the Star at Lebanon. George Denny, father of William H. P. Denny, and Noah Crane, were also early printers on the Western Star.\n\nThe first printing-press in Lebanon was of the Ramage pattern, with a frame of oak and a bed of stone. This press was purchased by John McLean in Cincinnati, and there is reason to believe, although it is not certainly known, that it was the first printing-press brought to Cincinnati, in 1793, and which was used in printing the Liberty Hall, and, about 1806, was superseded by a Stanhope press, imported to Cincinnati from England. The old wooden press purchased by John McLean remained in the Star office long after it had ceased to be used; but finally it was sold, about the time of the close of the civil war, and removed to a Western State, and its whereabouts are now unknown. This press was worked with a bar, and it was a hard day's labor to work off with it 300 copies of a small-sized newspaper. Thin splits of wood, similar to those used for the seats of chairs, were used in place of leads to separate the lines, and the type was inked with pelt-balls in place of the modern rollers.\n\nThere is not known to be in existence a single copy of the Western Star while it was edited by John McLean, and we have not, therefore, even one specimen of the editorial writing of the young lawyer whose opinions from the Supreme Bench, in after years, commanded the respect of the whole nation. It is probable, however, that the paper contained little matter written by the editor. Judging from what is to be found in the files of the few other newspapers printed in Ohio at that time, editors thought it more important to select it for their readers long columns of intelligence from Europe, six weeks old, than to write concerning what was transpiring around them. Local matters and\n\n310 - HISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY.\n\nhome news seem to have been considered beneath the dignity of newspaper publication. It should be remembered, too, that a little village in the woods did not furnish many thrilling matters for the reporter's pen.\n\nThe oldest copy of the Star in existence is dated September 10,1810. The paper was then edited and managed by Nathaniel McLean. The issue referred to is a small folio, printed on strong but coarse paper, now yellow with age. It contains no editorial matter and no local intelligence whatever, except such as' may be gleaned from the advertisements. It has intelligence from Europe more than two months old, and intelligence from New York and St Louis three weeks old. The only matter aside from the advertisements prepared for the issue is a communication proposing Thomas Worthington for Governor, Jeremiah Morrow for Congress. John Bigger for the State Senate, and Matthias Corwin, Michael H. Johnson and David Morris for the Lower House of the General Assembly. The advertisements contain nine notices of estray horses taken up, and their appraisement, at from $20 to $35, and a reward of 6% cents for a runaway apprentice. Offers are made to pay 50 cents for wheat, and notice is given that good rye whisky, at 40 cents per gallon. will be taken in exchange for goods at Lebanon.\n\nThe first number of the Western Star contained the following lines:\n\n\" The Western Star now issues forth\n\nFrom Lebanon the seat of worth.\"\n\nThe controversy concerning the seat of justice of the county had caused considerable strife, but before the Star was first issued, the controversy had been settled in favor of Lebanon, and these lines may have been suggested by the termination of this controversy. It was necessary, at that time, when mail routes were few, that newspapers should be distributed by a carrier, and it is said that the first issue of the Star was distributed to the subscribers by Fergus McLean, the father of the editor, who carried the papers on horseback. It is stated by A. H. Dunlevy that, about 1307, while George Denny was a printer in the Star office, a large book for the Shakers, entitled\" Christ's Second Coming,\" was printed at Lebanon- The book contained five or six hur.dred pages\n\nof fine type.\n\nAfter publishing the paper for about three years, John McLean sold the Star to his brother Nathaniel, who continued the publication, at first in connection with Noah Crane, and afterward in connection with Rev. Adjet McGuire, a Methodist clergyman. About 1812, the proprietors were Nathaniel McLean and Samuel H. Hale, afterward of Wilmington., Ohio. Subsequent partners of Mr. McLean in the paper were Henry Lazier, William Blackburn, Samuel Blackburn and Joseph Henderson. About the year 1814. Nathaniel McLean disposed of his interest in the paper to his brother, William McLean, a lawyer of Lebanon, but he did not long remain a proprietor. From 1816 until 1396. Abram Van Vleet, George Smith. John Eddy, William A. Camron and William Sellers were connected with the publication, each for a longer or shorter time. In 1926. Jacob Morris and A. H. Dunlevy became the proprietors. In 1334. Dunlevy sold his interest to William H. P. Denny, who was editor and proprietor until 1953. The subsequent proprietors have been Dr James Scott. Dr. William H. Corwin. Seth W. Brown, Alfred Clements and William C. McClintock. Mr. McClintock began his connection with the paper in partnership with Clements Hardy, in 1340, and. since 1373, has been the sole owner and publisher. In 1370. the first cylinder press was procured and in 1375. steam-power was first employed in he press work.\n\nIt is impossible now to grve a complete list of the various newspapers published in Warren County previous to the civil war. Some of them were published for a few months only. Others maintained an existence for some\n\nHISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY - 311\n\nyears. Among them were the Farmer, the Ohio Argus (which was move( from Lebanon to Franklin in 1834), the American Democrat, the Spirit a, Freedom, the Second Sober Thought, the Buckeye Mercury, and the Democratic Citizen. The last-named newspaper was destroyed by a mob at the be ginning of the civil war. In later years, notwithstanding the increased circulation of daily papers, six or seven weekly papers have been published in the county at the same time.\n\nThe Lebanon Patriot is a Democratic newspaper. It was edited and published for several years by Edward Warwick, who was succeeded by A. A. Roland, the present editor and proprietor. Several unsuccessful efforts had been made to maintain a Democratic journal in Warren County. Among other efforts, Judge Keeling for awhile published a Jackson paper at Lebanon. The Lebanon Patriot was established in 1868, by Gen. Durbin Ward, who not only purchased the press and printing materials, but maintained the paper at his own expense until it was placed on a self-sustaining basis.\n\nThe Lebanon Gazette was started in 1877, by William H. P. Denny, who, two years later, sold it to William D. Mulford and J. C. Van Harlingen. It is now published by the Gazette Printing Company, and edited by George M. Johnston. It is a Republican journal.\n\nWilliam H. P. Denny has perhaps been longer identified with the newspaper press of Warren. and neighboring counties than any other person. In 1821, when a boy, he went with his father, George Denny, a printer, to Wilmington, Ohio, and set type on the Galaxy until the fall of 1823. The paper passed into the hands of Hon. J. N. Reynolds, who changed the name to Wilmington Spectator. He remained a short time in his employ. Next he worked with Griffith Foos and Archibald Haynes, for J. B. Semans, in 1826 and 1827, who published the Wilmington Argus. In 1829, then in his eighteenth year, he commenced the Clintonian, an independent little paper; which created considerable sensation. This he published until 1831, when he sold out to John Crichfield, then County Auditor. In the fall and winter of 1823-24, he went to Lebanon to complete his apprenticeship with Camron & Sellers, but, disagreeing with them, left in the summer of 1824. For twenty-six years he was connected with the Star, as apprentice, editor and publisher. In 1858, he sold the venerable journal to Hon. James Scott, and removed to Dayton, where he published the Dayton Daily and Weekly Gazette until 1871, when he again sold out, and located at Circleville and commenced a new paper, the Circleville Union. This he continued for five years, holding, while resident of that interesting little city, the responsible position of Postmaster for seven years. He resigned in 1871, and purchased the Wilmington Journal, which he published for several years, and, in 1877, returned to Lebanon, where he started the Lebanon Gazette, which he disposed of to Mulford & Van Harlingen. In 1880, he went to Georgetown, Brown County, where he started the Georgetown Gazette. While a resident of Warren County, Mr. Denny represented Warren and Greene Counties in the State Senate in the years 1842 and 1843.\n\nEDUCATION.\n\nThe character of the pioneer schools of the county has already been described. To illustrate the manner in which subscription schools were opened end maintained, the following advertisement from a Lebanon paper is copied. The date of the advertisement is March 7, 1817. Westfield was the name then recently adopted for the town now known as Red Lion:\n\nNOTICE.—The inhabitants of Westfield, together with the adjacent neighborhoods, Will please to observe that as soon as practicable the subscriber intends opening a school at the brick schoolhouse at the customary price of two dollars per quarter, one-half in produce\n\n312 - HISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY.\n\nat market price. Those who may wish to encourage literature may send a short or longer\n\ntime, discretionally with themselves, of which there will be an accurate account kept, and strict attention paid, by\n\nThe public's most obedient humble servant, ANTHONY GEOHEGAN.\n\nThere was much opposition throughout the State, in its early history, to the principle of supporting free schools by taxation. The first law in Ohio authorizing taxation for school purposes and providing for the management of schools by local officers elected by the people, was passed in 1825; yet, in 1837, there were no free schools in the State outside of Cincinnati, and, excepting in the larger towns, where good private teachers were encouraged, but few schools afforded, even for three or four months in the year, instruction in reading, writing and arithmetic. The country schools in Warren County were perhaps not inferior to those of any other county in the State, yet the greater portion of the children of the county, were under the instruction, for two, three, four or five months in the year, of teachers who were generally young men, and, with some exceptions, were without the education, culture or training to fit them for the proper conduct of elementary schools. In 1838, Samuel Lewis, the first State School Superintendent, wrote in his annual report: \" Every possible variety is found in the character of the teachers, and the kind and manner of instruction. There is this encouragement, however: The people are very generally convinced of present defects, and seem determined to remedy the evils. There are but few places where a teacher can be employed who does not pretty well understand English grammar and geography, in addition to reading, writing and arithmetic.\"\n\nFrom the best attainable sources of information—the early school statistical reports being incomplete and inaccurate—it would appear that in the year 1840, the average monthly wages of male teachers in Warren County were about $20; of female teachers, about $14. From this time, the wages gradually increased, until they attained their maximum in 1870, the average monthly wages of teachers in the elementary schools for that year being reported at $45 for gentlemen, and $34 for ladies. In 1880, they were $39 for gentlemen, and $32 for ladies. In 1880, there were in the county 103 schoolhouses, valued at $114,000, and containing 149 schoolrooms.\n\nThe first teachers' institute in the southern part of Ohio was held at Cincinnati is February, 1847. The first teachers' institute in Warren County was held in the hall of the academy at Maineville, in the summer of 1852, and was continued five days. Among the teachers of the county who were instructors at this institute were Josiah Hurty, of Lebanon; C. W. Kimball, of Maineville; W. T. Hawthorn, J. S. Morris and C. W Harvey. Lectures were delivered by L. A. Hine and C. Knowlton. Prof. James E. Murdoch, the distinguished actor and elocutionist, gave an evening entertainment of select readings, which highly delighted the large audience of teachers and citizens present. Resolutions were adopted requesting the court to fill the vacancies then existing in the Board of County School Examiners with practical teachers; favoring the establishment of lyceums and libraries in every town and neighborhood, and recommending every teacher to acquaint himself with the phonetic system, with a view to its practical introduction. The report of W. T. Hawthorn, Secretary of the institute, concludes as follows:\n\n\" Thus has terminated the first institute of Warren County. Those only who were present can fully appreciate the rich treat that was there afforded. It is not yet nine mouths since the association was organized by a few enterprising teachers, who, ' solitary and alone,' have faithfully attended the regular monthly meetings, while other teachers have looked on, wondering what good a teachers' association could do. Those who attended know, and the community, through them, will soon feel the benefits of this institute. Now\n\nHISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY - 313\n\nthat the work is fairly under way in our county, we cordially invite t i teachers who have heretofore held back to unite in a good cause and aid revolutionizing the common schools of our county. The exercises were hi; interesting and instructive. The best methods of teaching the different branches was discussed. The attendance of the citizens evinced their int( in the exercises. A respectable number was in attendance all the time, often a large audience. Each evening, the spacious hall, lighted at the pense of the citizens, was crowded until a late hour.\"\n\nSince 1852, annual county teachers' institutes have been held, wits creasing success and widening influence for good as their objects and ad tages became known. Among the distinguished men not connected with schools of the county who have assisted at these institutes as instructors lecturers, may be named Dr. A. D. Lord, Prof. Daniel Vaughn, E. E. WI John Hancock, John Ogden, W. D. Henkle and W. H. Venable. At nearly the whole work of conducting the institute has devolved on the three County School Examiners. The institute fund provided by the school consisting of two-thirds of the amount received from the 50-cent fee pail applicants for teachers' certificates has usually been found sufficient to de the entire expenses of the County Teachers' Institute.\n\nThe Warren County Teachers' Association, organized in 1851, has coi ued in existence until the present. Its meetings are held monthly during school year. The exercises are generally of a practical character, and speech-making is discouraged. Both the annual institutes and the mon meetings of the association are attended by the most progressive and eneri teachers of the county.\n\nWhile the common schools of Ohio have always been intended to be str undenominational, the question of religion in the public schools is one that caused considerable discussion. The question whether the Bible shoule formally read and the schools opened in the morning with religious exec has, in portions of the county, caused rancorous animosity. There has r been any legislation on the subject in Ohio, the legal decision of the question being left under the laws to the local Boards of Education, who may prescribe, allow or forbid such exercises. In Warren County, the local boards have seldom taken action on the subject, and the matter has been left, generally, discretion of the teacher. The question was most vehemently discussed after the passage of a resolution, in 1869, by the Cincinnati Board of Education, forbidding the reading of the Bible and other religious books in the public schools of that city. This resolution led to a contest in the courts, lasted four years, and was settled by a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio sustaining the resolution. The spirit of the elaborate opinion of the court was averse to Bible-reading and religious instruction in public schools supported by common taxation. Of late years, a large majority o teachers of Warren County have voluntarily refrained from Bible-reading ligious exercises and religious instruction in the public schools.\n\nCounty School Examiners. —A system for the examination and cert Lion of teachers has existed ever since the passage of the first law in Ohi the support of education by taxation, but the number of Examiners am method of their appointment have fluctuated. Strangely, however, the law was uniformly styled the persons appointed. School Examiners, although their has been confined to the examination and the granting of certificates of qualification to teachers. In 1825, the law provided for the appointment by the Court of Common Pleas, of three Examiners, and enumerated the branch study in common schools as \" reading, writing, arithmetic and other nece branches of a common education.\" In 1829, the number of Examiner\n\n314 - HISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY.\n\nplaced at not less than five nor more than the number of townships in the county_ In 1834, the number of Examiners was limited to five, but it was made the duty of the Examiners to appoint a suitable person in each township to examine female teachers only. The act of 1836 provided for three Examiners in each township, but in 1838, the law again provided for three School Examiners for the whole county, which has continued to be the law until the present time. In 1853, the appointment of Examiners was vested in the Probate Court, and applicants were required to be examined in \"orthography, reading, writing, arithmetic, geography and English grammar.\" Previous to 1853, the examinations of applicants for teachers' certificates were conducted in a very loose and unsatisfactory manner. For many years, a single member of the Board of Examiners could examine any applicant at any time the application was made, and write out a certificate of qualification. Intelligent men, however, were generally appointed Examiners. The first Board of Examiners appointed un_ der the act of 1825 consisted of A. H. Dunlevy, John M. Houston and Phineas Ross. Among others who held this office previous to 1853 may be mentioned Judge Collett, Gov. Morrow, Jonathan K. Wilds, Lauren Smith and Thomas F. Thompson.\n\nSince the passage of the act of 1853, more care has been taken in the licensing of teachers for the public schools. Regular meetings have been held for the examination of applicants, at which at least two of the Examiners must be present. Applicants are examined in all the branches named in the law fix- ing the qualifications of teachers. A register has been kept, and is preserved, giving the names of all persons who have received certificates of qualification in Warren County since the 3d day of May, 1853, al the dates and grades of their certificates.\n\nThe following are the names of the School Examiners of Warren County since 1853:\n\nC. Elliot, 1853-54; D. S. Burson, 1853-54; C. W. Kimball, 1853-55; Josiah Hurty, 1853-54; Rev. J. H. Coulter, 1854-54; William W. Wilson, 1855-57; J. H. Elder, 1855-58; W. T. Hawthorn, 1855-56; Rev.

Cunningham (1878) The last named three being the Examiners in 1882.\n\nRELIGION.\n\nReligious statistics and materials for a history of the progress of religion ara not readily accessible in a country where there is no State Church or Governmental support of religion. The State of Ohio requires full statistical reports to be made annually of the condition and growth of the schools maintained by public taxation, but the chief matters pertaining to religion, which liar been noticed by State or National statisticians are the number of church organizations and church edifices, the amount of church sittings or accommodations for public worship and the value of church property; and our information concerning these is derived chiefly from the census returns of the United States since 1850.\n\nAccording to the census of 1850, there were, in Warren County, sixty church edifices valued at $82,400; in 1870, these had increased in number to\n\n315 - PICTURE OF CHARLES F. CHAPMAN\n\n316 - BLANK\n\nHISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY - 317\n\nseventy-three, and were valued at $267,730. It thus appears that in twenty years the cost of churches increased much more rapidly than their number.\n\nThe aggregate church accommodations, or sittings, in the county, were returned in 1850 at 22,295, and, in 1870, at 26,050. Comparing these figures with the population of the county at the same dates, and making but a slight deduction from the population for infants, the sick and the infirm, it appears that at both periods these were seats in the churches for more than the entire population of the county who could attend public worship.\n\nThe statistics of churches given in census returns do not in all cases agree with the statements put forth by the denominational organs of the various sects. The census superintendents have their own point of view and apply tests different from those known to the compilers of religious year-books and registers. It should be borne in mind, too, that reports of the number of church edifices, their accommodations and value are not always true measures of the religious activity of a community. A strong denomination with numerous churches, may often strengthen itself by suffering a weak church to cease to exist when it becomes unable to support itself. There are churches which find a place on the rolls of a denomination, and may be enumerated in census returns, which, having a legal title to an edifice, and maintaining some kind of an organization, have ceased to gather congregations, to support a minister or to conduct any of the services of public worship. It is not easy to determine the number of churches in a given area for the reason that it is not easy to determine what constitutes a church to entitle it to a place in an enumeration. On this point, the superintendent of the ninth census of the United States remarks: \"A church to deserve note in the census must have something of the character of an institution. It must be known in the community in which it is located. There must be something permanent and tangible to substantiate its title to recognition. No one test, it is true, can be devised, that will apply in all cases; yet, in the entire absence of tests, the statistics of the census will be overlaid with fictitious returns to such an extent as to produce the effect of absolute falsehood. It will not do to say that a church without, a church-building of its own is, therefore, not a church; that a church without a pastor is not a church; nor even that a church without membership is not a church. There are churches properly cognizable in the census which are without edifices and pastors, and, in rare instances, without a professed membership. Something makes them churches in spite of all their deficiencies. They are known and recognized in the community as churches, and are properly to be returned as such in the census.\"\n\nThe most numerous denomination in Warren County is the Methodist Episcopal, which has a church in almost every neighborhood. Next in numbers are the Presbyterian, Regular Baptist, Old School and New School, and the Christian. By the last-named is meant the Christian denomination, formerly frequently termed New Lights, and not the followers of Alexander Campbell, or Disciples of Christ, who are also popularly called Christians. Of the Disciples of Christ there are but one or two small organizations at present in the county. Other denominations found in the county are the Orthodox Friends, Hicksite Friends, Universalist, United Brethren, Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed (late German Reformed), Cumberland Presbyterian, Free-Will Baptist, United Presbyterian, Methodist Protestant and the Shakers. Several of\n\nhe last-named have but a single church organization within the limits of the county. A small number of persons are believers in the phenomena known as spiritual manifestations, and occasionally meet for religious exercises or to receive spiritual communications, but no regular organization of Spiritualists is. known to exist in the county.\n\n318 - HISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY.\n\nIt is difficult to determine whether at the present time a larger or smaller proportion of the entire population are members of church than in the past generation. In the southwestern portion of the county, sworn exhibits of the membership of each church receiving the benefit of the ministerial land fund are made annually. From these exhibits, it appears that in the two original surveyed townships comprising seventy-two square miles, in the central part of the county and embracing the towns of Lebanon, South Lebanon and Union Village, 28 per cent of the entire population are members of some religious society. It is estimated that fully two-thirds of the communicants of churches are women and minor children, and thus the burden of supporting the churches falls upon a small proportion of the adult male population, heads of families and property owners. The Presbyterians and Baptists built the first meet- ing-houses in the county, but the Methodists soon followed. The early Methodist ministers were generally men of but little education, but their zeal and perseverance overcame every obstacle. The itinerant plan of their ministry proved best calculated for the spread of the Gospel throughout the thinly scattered population of a new country. They established preaching stations before churches could be erected, and the little clearing was scarcely commenced and the little cabin scarcely built before the Methodist circuit-rider made his appearance, formed a class, and taught the worship of God. The Quakers formed an important element in the pioneer population. They taught a religion without forms and ceremonies and established churches without a priesthood or a sacrament. Their habits of industry and frugality, their attention to useful arts and improvements, and their love of human liberty, were highly commendable and made them valued members of the community; but their opposition to the amusements, recreations and dress of polished society has prevented the sect from increasing with the growth of population. The Christian denomination in the county is an offshoot from the Presbyterians; of late years it has not increased in numbers. The Presbyterian was the most important and influential church in the earliest settlement of the county; its ministers stood first in education and ability, and, had it hot been for the disastrous effects upon the denomination of the great Kentucky revival, it would probably have been the largest sect in the county.\n\nGreat changes have taken place in the Mode of public worship since the first rude churches of hewed logs sprung up beside the green fields. In the former days, sermons were from an hour and a half to two hours in length, while the other services were protracted by long prayers and commentaries on the chapter read from the Scriptures, to a length that would now be thought unendurable. Often there were two services separated by an intermission of fifteen minutes. During both services, horses, in the absence of a society for the prevention of cruelty to animals, stood, without food or water, haltered to trees from which they gnawed the bark. The autumn sun was low in the horizon before the benediction was pronounced and the worshipers departed, some to distant homes. The singing was not artistic. The innovation of singing hymns with- out lining them out caused many a difficulty in the older churches. Some- times there was a compromise between the opposing parties, and one hymn each Sunday was sung without being read line by line, and the others in the old way. A new tune, which all could not sing, caused some to grieve. The introduction of a choir or of a musical instrument caused serious dissension. Instrumental music was not common in the rural churches until a her the introduction of the cabinet organ. The sin of wearing elegant attires and adornment with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array, was a favorite topic in the pulpit. Flowers on the sacred desk would have been considered as ministering to a worldly vanity. The most beautiful comedies and the sub-\n\nHISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY - 319\n\nlimiest tragedies to be seen on the stage were declared unfit for Christian eyet Many pastimes and divertissements which scatter sunshine and sweetness ov( the cares and hardships of life were regarded as inconsistent with the seriou ness, gravity and godly fear which the Gospel calls for.\n\nIt cannot be doubted that there was less harmony among the different denominations formerly than now. The religious men of former generatioi were sincerely and intensely sectarian. They believed that they had saith the Lord\" for their distinctive tenets. They believed themselves to 1 and were determined to remain rigidly \"orthodox \"—a term which, according to Dean Stanley, \"implies, to a certain extent, narrowness, fixedness, perhaps even hardness of intellect and deadness of feeling, at times, rancorous an mosity.\" Sermons were more controversial and doctrinal than now. It can hardly be doubted that, with the increase of culture and refinement in the clergy and laity, have come a larger religious sympathy and a higher and broader view which would break down the party wall of sectarianism and swel away the petty restrictions on thought and opinion.\n\nThe early Presbyterian and 43aptist Churches were severely Calvinist and their pulpits dwelt more frequently and more strenuously than their mode. successors on the five points of their creed—predestination, particular redemption, total depravity, effectual calling and the certain perseverance of the saints. The terrors of the eternal torment of the wicked were more frequent and more vividly portrayed than in the modern days. The belief in a materi fire in hell for the future and endless punishment of the unregenerate was col mon in all the churches. The doctrine of a literal fire in bell was preached Rev. J. B. Findlay and other early Methodist preachers, in which they follow, the explicit teachings of the sermons of John Wesley. It is doubtful if a p( son known to be a disbeliever in eternal punishment would have been suffer, to remain a member of any of the early orthodox churches; to-day a belief the final holiness and happiness of all mankind is not an insurmountable bar a place among the laity of the evangelical denominations. Excepting the Quakers, nearly all the religious persons among the, pioneers were rigid Sanitarians, and the first day of the week was not with them a day for social enjoyment or recreation. Too often it left with it upon the minds of the young pleasing memories. Children who were kept constantly at work six days the week, by poor parents who had bought land o..1 credit, and must pay for with hard labor, were required on Sunday to go to church, a considerable d tance on foot, to listen to long sermons; and, after returning home, to spe much of the rest of the day on their feet reciting the catechism, or to sit a hear read the Bible and Baxter's Saints' Everlasting Rest.\n\nBut let us not judge the religious men of former days harshly. They were noble men and the county owes them a debt of gratitude. The high place education, morals and religion Warren County has ever maintained is largely to the life and work of the early religious teachers. We cannot believe in all taken place as they believed, but we cannot fail to recognize their virtues and their worth.\n\nMost of the changes in the religious beliefs and modes of worship that have taken place since the establishment of the pioneer churches are not such as result in modifications of creeds and articles of faith. They are the result of inevitable tendencies, and are brought about, not so much by theological discussions, as by the changes in human modes of thinking, feeling and believing, which, taken together, we call the spirit of the age. The advance of the refinements of civilization may render the religious doctrines of good men in one age repugnant to those of the next.\n\nIt is now impossible to determine when Sunday schools were first estab-\n\n320 - HISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY\n\nlished in Warren County. There were but few previous to 1830. Some denominations did not at first look upon them with favor. Until comparatively recent times, no provisions were made in the erection of churches for the accommodation of a Sunday school; but now no church edifice is considered complete without ample rooms for the instruction of infant classes and other classes, and a general assembly room for the entire school. The Sunday school has thus exerted a great influence on church architecture. In 1850, seven Sunday school libraries were reported in Warren County. These have increased in numbers and in size until they have become the most widely diffused libraries, and their books the most widely circulated in the county. They are found, not only in the towns, but in almost every rural church, and many Sunday schools with libraries are established without being in connection with any church. Unfortunately, the books selected for these libraries are generally not of a high order of literature, and only a minority of them furnish strong and wholesome intellectual food for growing minds. In 1879, there were sixtyn five Sunday schools in Warren County, having 500 teachers and a total enrollment of 5,000 pupils.\n\nThe Warren County Sabbath School Union was organized at a meeting held at the Congregational Church in Lebanon, May 17 and 18, 1864. The object of the union, as declared in its constitution, is \"to unite all evangelical Christians in the county in efforts to promote the cause of Sabbath schools, in co-operation with the State Sabbath School Union, aiding in establishing new schools where they are needed and awakening an increased interest and efficiency in Sabbath school work.\" The association holds annual conventions of two days' sessions, which are usually largely attended.\n\nAGRICULTURE.\n\nNotwithstanding the wonderful fertility of the rich, virgin soil when the old forests were cut away and the genial and vivifying rays of the sun shone upon the first crops planted by the hand of man, agriculture was not the road to wealth with the early settlers of the Miami Valley. The great embarrassment under which the pioneer farmer labored was the difficulty of getting the products of his soil to a market. In spite of roots and stumps, sprouts and bushes, the newly cleared land brought forth bountiful harvests; but the wagon roads were imperfect, canals and railroads unthought of, and the distance by the Ohio River to the principal markets so great, the navigation so difficult, tedious and hazardous, that the early farmer had little encouragement to increase the products of his fields beyond the wants of his family and the supply of the limited home market created by the wants of the inhabitants of the neighboring towns and the newly-arrived emigrants. The average time required for a journey by a flat-boat propelled by oars and poles, from Cincinnati to New Orleans and return, was six months. The cargoes taken in these boats were necessarily light; the boats could not be easily brought back, and were generally abandoned at New Orleans and the crew returned by land, generally on foot, through a wilderness of hundreds of miles. A large part of the proceeds of the cargo was necessarily consumed in the cost of taking it to market-Beeswax, skins and feathers were the principal articles that could profitably be transported by wagons to distant markets. Hogs and cattle were driven afoot over the mountains, and, after a journey of a month or six weeks, found an uncertain market in Baltimore. Corn rarely commanded more than 10 or 12 cents per bushel; wheat, 30 or 40 cents; hay was from $3 to $4 per ton; flour from $1.50 to $2 per hundred; pork from $1 to $2 per hundred; the average price of good beef was $1.50 per hundred, while oats, potatoes, butter and egg! scarcely had a market value, and the sale of cabbage and turnips was almost\n\nHISTORY OF WARREN COUNTY - 321\n\nunheard of. But the early farmers supplied their homes liberally with the comforts of pioneer life; they lived independently, and, perhaps, were as happy and contented as those who have the luxuries brought by wealth and commerce.\n\nThe proximity of a spring, rather than the claims of taste or sanitary considerations, usually determined the location of the first residence of the pioneer farmer; and the log stable and the corn-crib, made of rails or poles, were apt to be in close proximity to the residence. The first fences, both for the fields and the door-yard, were made of rails in the form of the Virginia, or worm, fence. This, in a new country, where timber, readily split with the wedge and maul,\n\nwas abundant, was the cheapest and the most durable fence. Unsightly as it is, it is yet superseded to a limited extent only by post-and-rail, board or wire fences, or hedges.\n\nAgricultural implements were at an early period necessarily few in number and rude and simple in construction. The plow first used was of rude construction--often made on the farm with the assistance of the neighboring blacksmith. It had a wooden mold-board and a clumsy iron share. It took a strong man to hold it and twice the strength of team now requisite for the same amount of work. The cast-iron plow was slowly introduced. The early harrows were made of bars of wood and wooden teeth, and were rude and homely in construction. Sometimes, in place of the harrow, a brush, weighted down w"
