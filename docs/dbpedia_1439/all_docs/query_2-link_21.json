        "text": "The Samuel McClain Papers consist of approximately .3 linear ft. of Civil War era documents, dating from 1864, consisting of the correspondence and diary of Samuel McClain during his service with the 144th O.V.I., including his imprisonment in various Confederate prisons.\n\nThe collection was loaned to the Center for Archival Collections for microfilming and copying through the cooperation of David Ferner and Douglas Decker, May-July 1992. This register was prepared by Marilyn Levinson, Curator of Manuscripts, and Steve Charter, Reference Archivist, Center for Archival Collections, May-July, 1992, with revisions in February 1997. No restrictions exist on the use of this collection.\n\nSamuel McClain, son of Robert and Rachel (Barton) McClain, was born December 29, 1830 in Straw Camp, Ross Township, Jefferson County, Ohio. He lived on the family farm until, when in the early 1850s, he succumbed to \"gold fever\" and ventured to California. He was married December 24, 1854 in Puerto del Reyes, California to Lucinda Ann Richardson, a daughter of Michael Richardson. Samuel and Lucinda remained in California until 1860 when they moved to Weston, Wood County, Ohio. The names of their children were Laura Jane, born October 14, 1855; Mary Elizabeth, born August 4, 1858; Sarah Ann, born December 23, 1861; and William Robert, born January 9, 1863.\n\nSamuel engaged in farming until May 2, 1864 when he enlisted as a musician (drummer) in Company I of the 144th Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry. On August 13, he was captured near Berrysville, Virginia. Samuel McClain died December 16, 1864 at Salisbury Prison Camp in North Carolina. Lucinda died December 24, 1880 in Weston, Wood County, Ohio.\n\nThe Samuel McClain Papers is a moderately complete series of Civil War era correspondence, with a related diary. The collection consists of a series of 18 letters from Samuel to his wife Lucinda during his service with 144th O.V.I. and a pocket diary which includes his period of captivity in various Confederate prisons until his death.\n\nThe letter series, consisting of transcripts of 18 letters, spans the period from when he enlisted in May of 1864 until his capture in August. The early letters give his impressions of the camps and surroundings, with only a little reference to military affairs. However, the letter written from July 6th through the 11th describes the Regiment's involvement at Monocacy Junction. The letter started August 7th, which describes hopes for mustering out and returning home, was the last written before his capture.\n\nThe diary, available on microfilm, with a transcript, covers the entire period of McClain's service, including his period as a prisoner of war at Salisbury Prison Camp until his death in December of 1864. The first section of the diary parallels the information in the series of letters, however, the more significant part covers the period after August 11th and the last of the letters. There are brief entries describing capture, a series of different prisons, and terse accounts of camp life, including rations, lice, escape attempts, boredom, family, ill-health, and deaths. The final entry in the diary, written by an unknown party, tells of the death of McClain."
