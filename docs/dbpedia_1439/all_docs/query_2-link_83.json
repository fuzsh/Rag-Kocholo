        "text": "1st Lieutenant, Co. E\n\n34th Texas Cavalry\n\nBy Joyce Chiles Hines\n\nIn 1862 Jesse, along with many Missouri Confederates, left Jackson County Missouri for Bonham, Fannin Co. Texas. On March 1, 1862 Jesse enlisted in the 34th Texas Cavalry. He served under Captain J. R. Russel, originally as a 2nd Lieutenant and later was promoted to 1st Lieutenant. He was stationed at Camp Alliston near Shreveport, Louisana. On May 18, 1864, Jesse Russell Youree was captured at Yellow Bayou and transported to New Orleans where he was held as a prisoner of war. On July 31, 1864, Jesse was transferred to Red River Landing, where he was exchanged for a Union soldier of equal rank. Jesse was in poor health as a result of his captivity but returned to his unit where he continued to fight for the Confederacy until it lay down its arms. On June 19, 1865, Jesse signed a pledge never again to bear arms against the United States of America. He returned to his home in Oak Grove, Missouri where, according to the 1880 census, he was employed as a livery man.\n\nThe Youree Family had a long history of being horsemen and raised and raced horses back in Murfreesboro, Rutherford Co., Tennessee where Jesse was born. Jesse was the youngest of 15 children born to William Hart Youree and Mary Carnahan of Murfreesboro Tennessee and later Jackson County Missouri.\n\nAccording to the Youree Family Bible, registered on May 19, 1870 with the Jackson County Missouri Clerk, Jesse's Family are as follows:\n\nParents:\n\nWilliam H. Youree b. July 26, 1789\n\nMary Carnahan Youree b. January 3, 1795\n\nSiblings:\n\nElizabeth Youree b. April 18, 1814\n\nFrancis Youree b. December 15, 1815\n\nAndrew Youree b. December 15, 1815 twin of the above\n\nJohn Youree b. December 01, 1817\n\nJames Youree b. March 12, 1819\n\nDavid Youree b. March 14, 1821\n\nWilliam Youree b. August 13, 1823\n\nJoseph Youree b. July 10, 1825\n\nAnn Youree b. May 21, 1827\n\nThomas Youree b. April 01, 1829\n\nRobert Youree b. March 14, 1831\n\nMary Youree b. February 25, 1833\n\nMartha Youree b. April 01, 1835\n\nAthaliah Youree b. January 26, 1838\n\nJesse Russell Youree b. November 26, 1840\n\nJesse enlisted with his Missouri cousins. These may have been nephews. As you can see there was considerable differences in the ages of his siblings. These Yourees returned to Shreveport after the War and became prominent bankers there. There is a Youree Ave. in Shreveport. A.J. Adair visited the area in the 1920's and wrote an article in his newspaper about it.\n\nJesse married Frances in 1862 in Jackson County Missouri. He left almost immediately for Texas. His wife Frances Wallen Youree, was listed in the 1880 census and being a milliner. It was by making hats that Frances held her family together during Jesse's frequent bouts with ill health and later after his death. Five children were born to Jesse and Frances:\n\n1. Albert born 1863\n\n2. John Robert born 1878\n\n3. Oda born 1873\n\n4. George born 1775\n\n5. Lillian Mae born 1877\n\nJesse died at the age of 40 (1881), having never fully recovered from his war and capture experience. He is buried in the Oak Grove Missouri Cemetary.\n\nJesse's daughter Oda Youree married Abner John (A. J.) Adair, Missouri and Civil War Historian. Abner was the owner and editor of the Oak Grove Banner and later the Odessa Democrat. He interviewed many Civil War Veterans and wrote numerous articles for the \"Confederate Soldier Magazine.\" A. J. planned to write a book about the Civil War but died suddenly and did not complete this task.\n\nSue Ellis Adair, (my mother) daughter of Oda Youree, third child of Jesse and A. J. Adair represented the Daughters of the Confederacy for the State of Missouri in Richmond, Virginia in 1932. Sue was 18 years old at the time and is seen here in a Civil War Era dress worn at that time by Julia Jane Perrin, the grandmother of her future husband, Morton Perrin Chiles, Jr. of Jackson County, Missouri.\n\nIf you would like some really good reading which helps explain the background of the Jackson County boys, I recommend Tears and Turmoil: Order Number 11 by Joanne Chiles Eakin. It is a short but powerful book about what happened to those left behind.\n\nConfederate Service Record\n\nJ. R. Youree, 2nd Lt., Co.

Youree.\n\nÂ©Ron Brothers and Joyce Chiles Hines, All Rights Reserved, 1999.\n\nJuly 13, 1999\n\nReturn to 34th Cavalry Biographies"
