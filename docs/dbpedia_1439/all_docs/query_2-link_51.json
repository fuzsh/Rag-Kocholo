Lull, George A. Flanders, William M. Barrett; Majs., Morrill B. Smith, Thomas Connolly, Henry H. Huse, John K. Stokes.\n\nThe 8th regiment, from the state at large, was mustered in at Manchester Oct. 25 to Dec. 29, 1861, for three years’ service. It was converted into a cavalry regiment between Dec. 16, 1863, and July 25, 1864, and was known first as the 1st and later as the 2nd N. H. cavalry.\n\nThe original members, not reenlisted, were mustered out on Jan. 18, 1865, at Concord and the reenlisted men and those whose term had not expired became the veteran battalion, 8th N. H. infantry, and were mustered out at Vicksburg, Miss., Oct. 28, 1865. The original members numbered 926, recruits 674, transferred 3, total strength 1,603. The 8th lost by death 99 men, of whom 81 were killed or died of wounds. The veteran battalion numbered 341, of whom 25 were recruits. Its loss by death was 13.\n\nThe 8th was ordered to Fort Independence, Boston harbor, embarked from there Feb. 16 and 18, 1862, for Ship island, Miss., where it arrived on Mar. 18 and 29, after a stormy passage. With Gen. Weitzel’s brigade, the regiment sailed for Donaldsonville, La., landed, and engaged the Confederates at Labadieville, La., on Oct. 27; was then transferred to the 2nd brigade of Emory’s division; was actively engaged at Fort Bisland, La., April 12-13, 1863, and participated in the siege of Port Hudson, La., from May 23 to July 9. On June 14 an assault was made, in which the 8th N. H. was sent in advance as skirmishers, a position requiring, according to orders, “The best troops.” The losses were heavy but the attack was successful.\n\nIn Sept., 1863, as part of McMillan’s brigade, the regiment participated in the second Red River expedition and marched north. In Jan., 1864, it was made a cavalry regiment and ordered back to New Orleans, where it remained until March 2.\n\nEngagements followed at Henderson’s hill, La Natchitoches, Crump’s hill, Wilson’s farm, Sabine cross-roads, Monett’s bluff, Cane river, near Alexandria, Snaggy Point, Gov. Moore’s plantation, Moreauville, Bayou de Glaize and Yellow bayou, all between March 21 and May 18.\n\nThe duties of the 8th were so severe that they called forth a protest from Gen. Arnold, but the regiment never flagged. On June 16, 1864, the regiment left New Orleans for Concord and spent the next two months on furlough, leaving for Natchez, Miss., Aug. 29, where it remained until mustered out. The veteran battalion, 8th N. H. infantry, was then organized as above described by special orders, and was assigned to Vidalia. In March it returned to Natchez and was mustered out in October.\n\nE N G A G E M E N T S .\n\nLabadieville (or Georgia Landing), La. Oct. 27, 1862\n\nBayou Teche, La., (Co.
