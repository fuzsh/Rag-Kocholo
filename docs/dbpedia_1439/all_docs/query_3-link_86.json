        "text": "Apparently the 1926 summer quarter course planning at the Chicago department of political economy in 1926 was so wild that the head of the department, Leon C. Marshall, decided to start the discussion for 1927 on the second day of Summer, 1926. Four of the seven colleagues responded with quite a few suggestions.\n\nThis post provides the first+middle names where needed in square brackets. Also links to webpages with further information about the suggested guests have been added.\n\n______________________\n\nCopy of memo from\n\nLeon Carroll Marshall\n\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO\n\nDepartment of Economics\n\nMemorandum from L. C. Marshall. June 22, 1926\n\nTo: C. W. Wright, J. A. Field, H. A. Millis, J. Viner, L. W. Mints, P. H. Douglas, W. H. Spencer\n\nWe really must break through the morass we are in with respect to our summer quarter. Partly because of delayed action and partly because of an interminable debating society in such matters we finally get a patched up program which is not as attractive as it should be.\n\nI shall proceed on the basis of the homely philosophy that the way to do something is to do something. I shall try to secure from every member of the group a statement of his best judgment concerning the appropriate course of action for the summer of 1927 and then move at once toward rounding out a program.\n\nWon’t you be good enough to turn in to E57 within the next few days your suggestions and comments with respect to the following issues.\n\nDo you yourself expect to be in residence the summer quarter of 1927?\n\nIf you do, what courses do you prefer to teach? Please list more than two courses placing all of the courses in your order of preference. In answering this question, please keep in mind the problem of guiding research. Should you offer a research course?\n\nWhat are your preferences with respect to hours? Please state them rather fully and give some alternatives so that a schedule may be pieced together.\n\nWhat courses or subject matter should we be certain to include in the summer of 1927?\n\nWhat men from outside do you recommend for these courses which we should be certain to include? Please rank them in the order of your preference.\n\nQuite aside from the subject matter which you have recommended above, what persons from the outside ought we try to make contact with if our funds permit? This gives an opportunity to aid in making up the personnel of the summer quarter in all fields.\n\nPlease give any other comments or suggestions which occur to you.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nLCM:G\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nResponse from\n\nJacob Viner\n\nThe University of Chicago\n\nDepartment of Political Economy\n\nJuly 1, 1926\n\nDear Mr. Marshall\n\nI will want to offer 301 (Neo-class Ec.) & 353 (Int Ec. Pol) as usual next summer, though if we have a good outside theorist to give 301, I would like to give a course on Theory of Int Trade in addition to 353. I think we need someone especially in Banking, next in theory. Beyond these we should offer work in some of the following, if we can get first rankers: statistics, private finance, transportation, economic history of Europe & ec. Hist. of U.S.\n\nI suggest the following from which selections could be made:\n\nAs other possibilities I suggest [George Ernest] Barnett, [James Cummings] Bonbright, [Edward Dana] Durand, [Edwin Griswold] Nourse, [Sumner Huber] Slichter, John D. [Donald] Black, Holbrook Working, [Alvin Harvey] Hansen.\n\n[signed]\n\nJ Viner\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nResponse from\n\nPaul Howard Douglas\n\nThe University of Chicago\n\nThe School of Commerce and Administration\n\nJune 29, 1926\n\nProfessor L. C. Marshall\n\nFaculty Exchange\n\nDear Mr. Marshall:\n\nYou have hit the nail on the head in your proposal to get under way for next summer, and I am very much pleased at your action. Answering your questions specifically may I say—\n\nThat I do not expect to be in residence for the summer quarter of 1927.\n\n&3. Since I shall not be in residence no answers to these questions are, I take it, necessary.\n\nWe should, I think, be certain to include adequate work in the following fields (a) Economic theory, (b) Monetary and banking theory, (c) Labor problems, (d) Statistics and quantitative economics, (e) Taxation and Public finance, (f) Economic history.\n\nAs regards men from outside, I would recommend the following in each field: (a) Economic theory—[Herbert Joseph] H. J. Davenport, [John Rogers] J. R. Commons, [Frank Hyneman] F. H. Knight; (b) Monetary and banking theory—[Allyn Abbott] A. A. Young, [Oliver Mitchell Wentworth] O.M.W. Sprague, [James Waterhouse] James W. Angell; (c) Labor problems—Selig Perlman, Alvin [Harvey] H. Hansen; (d) Statistics and quantitative economics—[Frederick Cecil] F. C. Mills, [Robert Emmet] R. E. Chaddock, [William Leonard] W. L. Crum; (e) Taxation and public finance—[Harley Leist] H. L. Lutz, [William John] William J. Shultz; (f) Economic history—[Norbert Scott Brien] N. S. B. Gras.\n\nAs people from outside to try for, might it not be possible to secure some one from England, such as [John Atkinson] John A. Hobson, Henry Clay, or [Dennis Holme] D. H. Robertson? Might it not also be possible to get Charles Rist from France or [Werner] Sombart from Germany?\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[signed]\n\nPaul H. Douglas\n\nP.S. The news that [Henry] Schultz and [Melchior] Palyi are to be with us next year is certainly welcome. Should we not let everyone know that they are coming, and should not a news note to this effect be sent on to the American Economic Review? [Handwritten note here: “Mr. Wright doing this”]\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nResponse from\n\nLloyd Wynn Mints\n\nThe University of Chicago\n\nThe School of Commerce and Administration\n\nJuly 16, 1926\n\nMemorandum to L. C. Marshall from L. W. Mints, concerning the work of the summer quarter, 1927.\n\nIt is my present intention not to be in residence during the summer quarter, 1927, although I will be in the city, I suppose.\n\nIt appears to me that we should attempt to get men from the outside who would represent some of the newer points of view rather than the orthodox fields. I should suppose that it would be desirable to have a man in statistics and, if he could be found, somebody to do something with quantitative economics. For the statistics I would suggest [William Leonard] Crum, [Frederick Cecil] Mills, [Frederick Robertson] Macaulay, [Willford Isbell] King, [Bruce D.] Mudgett, [Robert] Riegel. I am ignorant of the particular bents of some of the statistical men, but I should suppose that in quantitative economics [Holbrook] Working, [Alvin Harvey] Hansen, or [William Leonard] Crum might do something. Perhaps [Edmund Ezra] Day should be added to the men in Statistics.\n\nIn economic history, as I remember it, we have had no outside help for a long time. I should like to see either [Noman Scott Brien] Gras or Max [Sylvius] Handman give some work here in the summer.\n\nParticular men who represent somewhat new points of view, and who might be had for the summer, I would suggest as follows: [Lionel Danforth] Edie, [Oswald Fred] Boucke, [Morris Albert] Copeland, [Sumner Huber] Slichter.\n\nIn addition I should like very much to see either [Edwin Robert Anderson] Seligman or [John Rogers] Commons here for a summer.\n\n[signed]\n\nL.W.M.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nResponse from\n\nHarry Alvin Millis\n\nAnswers to questions re Summer Teaching, 1927\n\nYes, I feel that I must teach next summer unless that plan you have been interested in goes through.\n\n342 [The State in Relation to Labor] and 440 [Research].\n\n342 at 8; 440 hour to be arranged.\n\n5. 6.: Should get a better rounded program than we have had. Should have an outstanding man in economic theory and another in Finance. For the former I would mention [John] Maurice Clark, [John Rogers] Commons, and [Frank Hyneman] Knight—in order named. For the latter I would mention [Allyn Abbott] Young, [James Harvey] Rogers. If we can get the money I should like to see [George Ernest] Barnett brought on for statistics and a trade union course.\n\nWould it be possible to have a seminar which would bring together the outside men and some of the inside men and our mature graduate students—these hand-picked? It might be made very stimulating.\n\n[Signed]\n\nH. A. Millis\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nResponse from\n\nChester Whitney Wright\n\nThe University of Chicago\n\nThe Department of Political Economy\n\nMemorandum to Marshall from Wright\n\nSummer 1927\n\nFirst term some aspects of economic history\n\n1:30 or 2:30\n\nMay have to teach the whole summer but hope I can confine it to first term.\n\nCan teach any phases of subjects in any fields suitable for term.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nResponse from\n\nJames Alfred Field\n\n[No written answer in the folder: however L.

C. Marshall\n\nThe Department of Political Economy\n\nMy dear Mr. Marshall:\n\nAs Mr. [Garfield Vestal] Cox does not wish to teach during the Summer Quarter of 1927, I wish the Department of Political Economy would try to get Mr. [Edmund Ezra] Day of Wisconsin [sic, Michigan is correct] who could give both a course in statistics and a course in forecasting. Forecasting is not given this summer and unless we get someone from the outside to give it, I presume it will not be given next summer.\n\nWhy does not the Department of Political Economy for the coming summer get someone like Mr. [Leverett Samuel] Lyon to give an advanced course in economics of the market for graduate students? The Department of Political Economy could handle half of his time and I perhaps could handle the other half for market management\n\nNow that it appears that the Department of Political Economy cannot get any promising young men in the Field of Finance, why do you not try for [Chester Arthur] Phillips of Iowa? He will give good courses and will draw a great many students from the middle west to the University.\n\nSo far as my own program is concerned, I have not made much progress. I tried to get [Roy Bernard] Kester of Columbia, but he turned me down. I am placing a similar proposition before [William Andrew] Paton of Michigan. In the Field of Marketing, I am trying for [Frederic Arthur] Russell of the University of Illinois to give a course in salesmanship primarily for teachers in secondary schools. Otherwise I have made no progress in getting outside men for next summer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[signed]\n\nW. H. Spencer\n\nWHS:DD\n\nSource: University of Chicago Archives. Department of Economics. Records. Box 22, Folder 7.\n\nToday we meet a Columbia Ph.D. alumnus who was brought to the Department of Political Economy at the University of Chicago in 1926 by Paul H. Douglas. He was mentioned in the course description of the previous post. Both Douglas as well as the University of Chicago publications people consistently misspelled William J. Shultz’s last name as “Schultz”. We can be sure that the correct spelling of the last name is without the Chicago “c”. Cf. both the Columbia College yearbook of 1922 and his obituary in the New York Times (below).\n\nWhile Shultz did not write a dissertation in economics, he immediately produced a work on inheritance taxation that won him the first prize in the Hart, Schaffner and Marx prize in economics. He went on to teach economics and later marketing.\n\nWhile the New York Times obituary (see below) stated that Shultz was an assistant professor at the University of Chicago in 1926, the University of Chicago’s Annual Register covering the Academic Year Ending June 30, 1926, with Announcements for the Year 1926-1927 (p. 137) gives his rank as “instructor” for the summer quarter of 1926 and lists him as “lecturer” for the 1926-27 academic year.\n\nShultz is a nice specimen of the utterly brilliant young graduate whose great expectations resulted in just a pretty good career without leaving a lasting impression in the history of economics.\n\n____________________________\n\nAbstract of Shultz’s dissertation\n\n“The book written by William J. Shultz introduces us to the Humane Movement in America that is dedicated to the protection of animals and children. It represents a continuation of an older work by Professor Roswell C. McCrea. At the present time in America there are 539 organizations with approximately 200,000 members active in this movement: 307 link the protection of animals with the protection of children and 175 are dedicated strictly to the protection of animals. The common motive here is the Prevention of Cruelty. The author documents the development of these organizations during the period 1910-1922, together with the organizational structures, methods of fund-raising and their inner-workings….”\n\nSource: Own translation of the review by Agnes v.

Shultz (1925)\n\nThe University of Chicago\n\nThe School of Commerce and Administration\n\nOctober 22, 1925\n\nProfessor J.A. Field\n\nFaculty Exchange\n\nMy dear Field:\n\nI quite forgot the other day in the Department meeting to suggest Dr. William J. Schultz [sic] as a person that I thought we ought to keep our eye on.\n\nI got acquainted with Schultz’s work last year as a result of his application for an Amherst Memorial Fellowship and he seemed to me the most brilliant youngster that I have ever known, with the exception of Viner. Schultz took his Ph.D. at Columbia in 1924 at the age of 23. He wrote his dissertation on “The Humane Movement in the United States” which was published in the Columbia Studies. In addition to that, he has translated the important portions of Rignano’s book on the inheritance tax and Knopf has published this with an introduction by Seligman. On top of all this, in collaboration with another person he has written a history of commerce; while he submitted last June a manuscript on the inheritance tax in the Hart, Schaffner & Marx series, which Viner tells me was easily the best in its completed form. Viner thinks it was really a marvelous piece of work.\n\nIn addition to all this, Schultz is an accomplished musician and has command over some four or five European languages. He spent a summer in Mexico and has written on that country.\n\nDuring the last year he was teaching at Hunter College but had some thought this year of going to Japan if he received an appointment at one of the universities there.\n\nI met him and liked him very much. Seligman thinks him very brilliant, although one or two men at Columbia complained of his artistic temperament. I was in favor of his receiving an Amherst Fellowship, but the business men on the committee were afraid of his precocious brilliance and were fearful that he might “blow up.” It may be that he is somewhat unsteady, although I detected no signs of it. On the other hand, he is certainly close to being a genius, and there are all too few of those in economics. It would be a great card for us to get him in the Department, or in some way attached to the University of Chicago. It would be easier to get him before he wins the Hart, Schaffner & Marx prize, if he does.\n\nHe seems to be a person that we should fish for and that at the very least we should try to get him for next summer and then possibly we might also make connections with him for a later engagement.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[signed] Paul H.

SHULTZ OF BARUCH SCHOOL\n\nThe New York Times, May 29, 1970\n\nDr. William J. Shultz, economist and author, who retired in 1964 as professor of business administration at the Bernard M. Baruch School of Business Administration of the City University of New York, died Saturday of a heart attack in Camden, Me. He was 68 years old and lived in New Harbor, Me.\n\nDr. Shultz was the author of several books in his field, the last of which was “American Marketing,” published in 1961.\n\nHe was born in Brooklyn on April 25, 1902, and graduated in 1922 from Columbia College, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He received a Ph.D. degree from Columbia University in 1924 and an LL.B. degree from New York Law School in 1930.\n\nEarly in his career he lectured on history at Columbia and taught history at City College and social science at Hunter College. He was assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago in 1926.\n\nDr. Shultz was a financial consultant to the National Industrial Conference Board from 1926 to 1930, and joined the faculty of Baruch School in 1932.\n\nHis widow, Luisa, survives.\n\nImage Source: The 1922 Columbian, p. 153.\n\nThis post features a memorandum from 1924 that summarizes a conversation between the president of the University of Chicago and the first head of the department of political economy called in after retirement to help the department in covering a vacancy in its professorial ranks. Among other things we learn that Laughlin’s pension from the university was $3000/year.\n\nBackstory 1: Shortly after being promoted to professor of economics, Harold G. Moulton left the University of Chicago in September 1922 to head the Institute of Economics established by the Carnegie Corporation in Washington, D.C. The department had trouble finding a successor, so among temporary measures it brought James Laurence Laughlin out of retirement during the academic year 1924-25 to help cover the money field. The last item transcribed below summarizes Laughlin’s observations on the state of the department ca. eight years after his retirement in 1916.\n\nBackstory 2: L. C. Marshall’s request to resign both the Deanship of the school of Commerce and Administration [succeeded by W. H. Spencer] and school of Social Service Administration [succeeded by Edith Abbott] was accepted to take effect 31 December 1923. He agreed to continue on as Chairman of the Department of Political Economy under the condition that funds be provided for additional clerical services.\n\n____________________\n\nLetter from Chairman L. C. Marshall to President Ernest D. Burton\n\nThe University of Chicago\n\nDepartment of Political Economy\n\nJune 1, 1924\n\nMy dear Mr. Burton:\n\nThe department of Political Economy sees no way of filling Mr. Moulton’s place in terms of the present situation. We turn, therefore, to temporary measures.\n\nAs one phase of the matter, will you approve of bringing Mr. Laughlin back for the Autumn Quarter, in case he is available? The 1924-25 budget contains the funds. I am at this same time asking Mr. Plimpton what would be involved as far as the relationship of stipend to retiring allowance is concerned.\n\nA carbon of this letter is going to Mr. Tufts and Mr. Laing for their information.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[signed] L C Marshall\n\nLCM:OU\n\n____________________\n\nLetter from Chairman L. C. Marshall to Nathan C. Plimpton, comptroller\n\nThe University of Chicago\n\nDepartment of Political Economy\n\nJune 2, 1924\n\nMy dear Mr. Plimpton:\n\nIn case Mr. J. L. Laughlin should be engaged to give work with us this coming Autumn Quarter would his compensation for this work be in addition to his retiring allowance for that period, or would the allowance be discontinued for that period?\n\nThe department is thinking in terms of a stipend of about $2500 if his allowance continues. If it does not, probably $3000 would suffice even though this would less than $2500 plus allowance.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[signed] L C Marshall\n\nLCM:OU\n\n____________________\n\nLetter from Chairman L. C. Marshall to President Ernest D. Burton\n\nThe University of Chicago\n\nDepartment of Political Economy\n\nMay 29, 1924\n\nPresident Ernest DeWitt Burton\n\nThe University of Chicago\n\nMy dear Mr. Burton:\n\nThis is a request to include in the Political Economy budget for the year 1924-25 the sum of $1,500.00 for clerical assistance.\n\nIn order that you may not need to consult files I give below an abstract of the situation up to the present time.\n\nAlong about January 1 you expressed a willingness to take up with the expenditures committee the provision of clerical assistance. While you were on your vacation I took the matter up through Mr. Dickerson and a sum was granted providing for clerical assistance during the remainder of this current budgetary year.\n\nI asked Mr. Tufts to insert in the 1924-25 budget a request for $1,500.00 but he indicated the need of awaiting your return before taking action on the matter.\n\nSometime after your return I asked Mr. Tufts whether he wished to take the matter up with you or whether I should take it up. The reply received indicated that Mr. Plimpton was under the impression that you had some understanding on the matter.\n\nThe official copy of the budget received from Mr. Tufts a day or two ago contains no such item.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[signed] L C Marshall\n\nLCM:EL\n\n____________________\n\nCarbon copy of letter\n\nfrom President Ernest D. Burton to L. C. Marshall\n\nJune 4, 1924\n\nMy dear Mr. Marshall:\n\nIn reference to your letter of May 29 I am glad to be able to state that the budget of next year as approved by the Board of Trustees carried with it an appropriation of $1500 for clerical service for your department. The statement sent to you by Mr. Tufts was intended to cover only the salaries of the teaching staff.\n\nI am sure the Board of Trustees would approve the recommendation of the department that Mr. Laughlin be invited to give lectures in the autumn quarter. As respects his compensation, concerning which you wrote to Mr. Plimpton, the custom has been to add a stipend for such service to the retiring allowance which is continued without interruption. Mr. Small [Department of Sociology] and Mr. Coulter [Department of Botony] are both being retained next year on this basis, each of them rendering substantially half service throughout the year. The extra compensation is, in one case, $1500, in the other $2000. May I raise the question whether either sum would not be sufficient in Mr. Laughlin’s case also? In other words, $2000 for the special service, in addition to the $3000 of his regular retiring allowance?\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nMr. L.C. Marshall\n\nThe University of Chicago\n\nEDB:HP\n\n____________________\n\nMemorandum of Conversation with\n\nProfessor Laughlin\n\n—November 19, 1924\n\nOn returning to the University Mr. Laughlin is struck with two things in respect to the Department of Political Economy.\n\n1) The introductory courses are not as well conducted as they were in 1916. Then some of the abler men of the department were giving them. Now they are largely in the hands of instructors and assistants.\n\n2) There has been a large increase in the number of graduate students.\n\nThere are four Universities that have graduate departments in Political Economy that need to be taken into account by us.\n\nColumbia has the largest department.\n\nChicago is second in size.\n\nHarvard is falling off.\n\nWisconsin is falling off.\n\nThe task of meeting graduate students and overseeing their work is an arduous one. We must, however, hold our own in dealing with this class of students. It would be desirable to raise the level of undergraduate work, but not at the expense of sacrificing our graduate work.\n\nWe must hold our present staff. Marshall, Clark and Viner are the best men. Wright is a good man. Field and Millis are pretty set in their ways, but this whole staff should be retained.\n\n(In subsequent conversation with Marshall he said Field was the best man of the whole group, but that his Harvard inhibitions made it impossible for him to bring things to pass. He is afraid of what people will say and of the tendency of things. Millis is a good man, but no longer capable of much re-adjustment.)\n\nMr. Laughlin urges that we must get a first class man in money. He believes that the business interests should be asked to give money for this particular purpose.\n\nThe weakness of the undergraduate department is due to the lack of good men and salaries to pay them. C & A is doing most of the undergraduate work. This is not in itself objectionable.

Wright requesting personal observations of J. L. Laughlin and the Department of Political Economy of the University of Chicago\n\n1618 Jefferson Ave.,\n\nBrooklyn, NY.\n\nJan 12, 1939.\n\nProfessor C. W. Wright,\n\nUniversity of Chicago,\n\nChicago, Illinois.\n\nDear Professor Wright,\n\nI am writing a thesis on J. Laurence Laughlin, as I believe Professor Mayer has already told you. What I am trying to do, among other things, is to write a chapter on “Faculty, Fellows and Students” in Laughlin’s Department at Chicago. In this chapter, I hope to tell as much as I can about the background in the Department and about the men connected with it.\n\nAs I understand it, you were appointed instructor in 1907, assistant professor in 1910, and associate professor in 1913. Can you tell me anything of interest in connection with your original appointment, that is, where you were teaching and where you got the Ph.D.? Marshall, I think, was also appointed in 1907, but even though he did not have the Ph.D. he was made a professor in 1911. Can you suggest the reason for his more rapid advancement?\n\nOn the other hand, I may suggest that apparently you and Marshall and Field were the first to be advanced so rapidly. In any event you seem to have been advanced more rapidly than Veblen and Hoxie. It is possible that in the early days he had a different attitude.\n\nOf course there is so much which you experience under Laughlin that would be of value to me to know about that I scarcely know how to ask you anything. Alvin Johnson has suggested that Laughlin was a neurotic and he would explain him in psychological terms, which, of course, I shall not do. But his characterization may suggest some thoughts to your mind. Moulton, incidentally, says Johnson could never have known Laughlin well enough to arrive at his conclusion, because Laughlin had few intimate friends.\n\nI do not know, of course, how much interest you had in Laughlin’s public work or his theories, so that what I am asking you largely concerns his Department. If you care to give me any observations with respect to these two phases, however, I should naturally greatly appreciate your doing so.\n\nBut I believe you could give me most invaluable information by your recollections of your years under Laughlin and how he saw the Department, as well as possibly some of the background.\n\nFor anything which you can find the time to tell me I shall be grateful.\n\nCordially yours,\n\nAlfred Borneman\n\nCarbon copy of Chester W. Wright’s reply to Alfred Borneman\n\nFebruary 27, 1939\n\nMr. Alfred Borneman\n\n1618 Jefferson Avenue\n\nBrooklyn, New York\n\nMy dear Mr. Borneman:\n\nI am sorry to have been so long in replying to your inquiry, but have been very rushed the last few weeks and assumed there was no need for an immediate answer.\n\nI presume Professor Laughlin’s attention was called to me by the staff at Harvard as it seems to have been his policy to make inquiries there when he had positions to be filled. I received my Ph.D. degree at Harvard in 1906 and during the following year taught at Cornell University. It was while I was there that I received a request from Professor Laughlin to meet him for an interview in Philadelphia, following which he offered me the appointment at Chicago which I decided to accept.\n\nProfessor Marshall came to Chicago at the same time. As I recollect, he had been teaching at Ohio Wesleyan for several years after completing two or three years of graduate work at Harvard, though he did not remain there to write a thesis and get his Ph.D. degree. Since he was recognized as an excellent teacher and very competent in administrative work, the fact that he did not have a Ph.D. degree was never considered an obstacle to his promotion any more that in the case of J. A. Field, who only held a Bachelor’s degree. I presume the explanation for the more rapid advancement of the men who came to the Department at Chicago about this time is that they proved to be more of the type in whom Laughlin had confidence. President Judson, I believe, had unusual confidence in Laughlin, so the latter was able to get his recommendations approved.\n\nOf the men already in the Department when I came, Cummings and Hill were not conspicuous successes either as teachers or productive scholars. I suspect there was no pressure either to promote them or to keep them when they had chances to go elsewhere. Just why Davenport left, I never knew. Hoxie was eventually made a full professor on the strength of his recognized success as a teacher and a student of labor problems despite views on these problems which must have seemed rather questionable to one of Laughlin’s conservatism.\n\nProfessor Laughlin was very much a gentleman of the old school and placed considerable emphasis on what he called “a sense of form.” Possibly the fact that he thought the men coming into the Department about my time and later had more of this sense of form may have been a factor in their advancement. It has never occurred to me that Laughlin was of the neurotic type, though Hoxie was.\n\nAs Laughlin’s theoretical and public work was entirely outside of my field of special interest, I cannot very profitably discuss it.\n\nIn his conduct of the Department, I had no feeling that he was autocratic or unreasonable. My recollection is that most matters of general interest were discussed among the members of the Department and commonly acted upon as decided by the group. I suspect that this may have been more generally the case after about the time I came to the Department here than it had been formerly, but I have no definite knowledge on this point.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nChester W. Wright\n\nCWW-W\n\nSource: University of Chicago Archives. Department of Economics, Records. Box 41, Folder 12.\n\nImage Source: Dr. Alfred Bornemann in C. W. Post College Yearbook, 1966.\n\nJoseph Schumpeter did not teach at the University of Chicago in 1926 but he was sent a cable offering him $4000 to teach during the five months April through August 1926. No reply was filed with the exchange of letters between the President’s Office and the Department of Political Economy and the copy of the cable sent to Schumpeter’s address in Vienna. I would guess that the Chicago colleagues were unaware that Schumpeter had just been appointed to a professorship in Bonn in 1925. In November 1925 Schumpeter was married in a Lutheran church in Vienna, so perhaps he actually saw the informal offer.\n\nI have added “[sic]” after the street address given for Schumpeter in Vienna. An umlaut was added, presumably by someone who thought Schumpeter’s street could use a diacritical mark. The street got its name to honor the Royal Counselor (and unumlauted) Johann Peter Strudel von Strudenhof (1648-1714).\n\nSalaries for the 1926-27 year (found in the budget recommendations for 1927-1928) ranged from $8000 for the head of the department, L. C. Marshall (Professor) through $6000 for Jacob Viner (Professor) to $3250 for L.W. Mints (Assistant Professor) so that $4000 for two quarters of teaching was a pretty generous offer.\n\n______________________________________________\n\nLetter from Vice President Tufts to Professor Field\n\n[COPY]\n\n8 October 1925\n\nProfessor James A. Field\n\nFaculty Exchange\n\nDear Professor Field:\n\nConfirming our conversation, it was the judgment of the President in consultation with Mr. Arnett and myself that in view of our present financial situation we could not go beyond the provision of the budget as would be required if Professor Schumpeter were to be invited for three quarters. The suggestion was made for the consideration of the Department that it might consider an offer, preferable for one quarter or perhaps for two quarters, one of these to be the summer quarter, for which there would be funds in the present budget. If he were to be invited for two quarters the understanding is that he might be offered four thousand dollars. If for a single quarter a larger proportionate sum would doubtless be necessary, as for example twenty-five hundred dollars, although we have had several distinguished men from Europe for the summer quarter whom we have paid eighteen hundred or two thousand dollars.\n\nThe Department will of course consider whether this appointment would be its best use of the available funds.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJames H. Tufts\n\nJHT.p\n\n______________________________________________\n\nResponse by Prof. Field to Vice-President James H. Tufts\n\nThe University of Chicago\n\nDepartment of Political Economy\n\nOctober 8th, 1925.\n\nMr. James H. Tufts,\n\nVice-president\n\nThe University of Chicago\n\nDear Mr. Tufts:\n\nAt our departmental meeting this noon we discussed at some length the proposal to invite Professor Schumpeter to give instruction here in the Spring and Summer quarters of the coming year. We were unanimously of the opinion that both our Summer schedule and our general departmental situation would be very much strengthened if Professor Schumpeter could be induced to come on the terms suggested in your memorandum, namely four thousand dollars ($4,000) for the two quarters.\n\nWe shall be glad, therefore, if the president’s office will extend an invitation to Professor Schumpeter. In order that we may lose no time, either in reaching him or in obtaining his tentative answer, we suggest that a cablegram be sent him asking if he would consider an appointment on the proposed terms, requesting an answer by return cable, and indicating that if his provisional answer is favorable we will write him a letter explaining fully the sort of arrangement we are proposing and the character of the work which would be assigned to him. The cablegram should presumably specify the actual dates at which his term of service would begin and end. Professor Schumpeter’s address is Strüdlhofgasse [sic] 17, Vienna IX.\n\nIf you feel that you need any additional information before you cable Professor Schumpeter will you be good enough to let me know at once? Our hope of getting him probably depends on quick action.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[signed| James A.
