He later continued his military service under alias when he enlisted in Co. H, 5th US Infantry in 1866, but gave his birthplace as Balitmore, Maryland. There is no record for why he used this alias when his true name was John McKenzie with a birthplace in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nHis official military record continues to reflect the biographical information he gave at the time of his first enlistment."
