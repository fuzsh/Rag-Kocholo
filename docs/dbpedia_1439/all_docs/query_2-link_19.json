        "text": "Although many Civil War soldiers were conscripted into service, most enlisted with the help of Army recruiters.[1] When we think of Army recruiters, we often envision stationary recruiting offices filled with men speaking to other men imploring them to enlist. But this is an incomplete image. This is the story of Mary Ann Shadd Cary, an African American female recruiter.\n\nMary Ann Shadd Cary was born free in Wilmington, Delaware on October 9, 1823.[2] She lived in Delaware and Pennsylvania, received an education, and became a teacher in the United States.[3] Her life, like the lives of many free African Americans, changed dramatically in 1850 when Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act, threatening the lives of all African Americans residing in the North.[4] To preserve her freedom and in search of a better life, Shadd Cary emigrated to Canada where she became North America’s first Black female newspaper editor with her newspaper, The Provincial Freeman.[5] In print from 1853 to 1857, the paper featured lively discussions about abolition, women’s rights, and racial integration, while encouraging African Americans to emigrate to Canada.\n\nShadd Cary’s support for Black emigration to Canada was based on her belief that Canada provided more freedoms and harbored less prejudice towards Black people than the United States.[6] During the first few years of the Civil War, she remained a staunch advocate of Black emigration to Canada believing that the war would not yield any positive changes for African Americans.[7] However, the passage of the 1862 Militia Act and the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, which opened the door for Black men to enlist in the Union Army, ignited hope that African Americans could live fruitful lives in the United States.[8]\n\nWhile some states quickly began forming Black regiments including the famous 54th Massachusetts, other states, such as Connecticut, delayed. After consistent urging by Colonel Dexter R. Wright and Colonel Benjamin S. Pardee to form Black regiments, the Connecticut General Assembly approved a bill to raise troops for the 29th Connecticut Colored Infantry on November 23, 1863.[9] Recruiters quickly stepped up to fill the regiment.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Shadd Cary received a letter from a longtime friend and fellow abolitionist, Martin R. Delany, on December 7, 1863. Delany was working as a Union Army recruiter for the newly forming Black regiments and hoped to hire more recruiting agents. Delany thought of Shadd Cary and asked her to return to the United States to begin recruiting Black men for the Union Army.[10] Shadd Cary accepted the job and journeyed back to America.\n\nUpon arriving in the United States, Mary Ann Shadd Cary joined Delany in recruiting for the 29th Connecticut Colored Infantry. Shadd Cary traveled throughout the midwest to recruit men for this regiment.[11] Her travel throughout the midwest to recruit men for a northeastern regiment was not unusual as many recruiters traveled broadly to fill regimental quotas. On February 19, 1864, Shadd Cary received a letter from the Indiana Governor Oliver P. Morton proclaiming that she was “entitled to protection in transit through [Indiana] with recruits.”[12] Five days later, she received a letter from Colonel Benjamin S. Pardee, the Commander of Recruiting Services in Connecticut, saying she was “authorized and empowered as my agent to obtain men.”[13] Armed with these guarantors of her authority, Shadd Cary along with other recruiters enlisted enough troops to form the 29th Connecticut Colored Infantry. This regiment was mustered on March 8, 1864 meaning the recruiters successfully enlisted at least 1,000 men within 3 months of the General Assembly approving the formation of a Connecticut Black regiment.[14]\n\nThese recruiters were so successful that they had raised an additional few hundred troops which were used to form the beginnings of the 30th Connecticut Colored Infantry.[15] Needing to fill this second regiment, Colonel Pardee wrote to Mary Ann Shadd Cary again on March 3, 1864 promising to “reward [Shadd Cary] handsomely, besides [her] regular pay” if she was successful in encouraging men to enlist.[16] Ultimately, the 30th Connecticut Colored Infantry never became its own regiment. Instead, it was incorporated into the 31st United States Colored Infantry on May 18, 1864.[17] This regiment would be present at the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse.[18]\n\nAs the war progressed, Mary Ann Shadd Cary continued recruiting. Most notably, on August 15, 1864, Indiana Governor Oliver P. Morton and Adjutant General Lazarus Noble officially appointed Shadd Cary as a “Recruiting Officer” to enlist “Colored Volunteers in any County…under the call for 500,000 men, issued July 17, 1864.”[19] Shadd Cary’s Indiana efforts likely culminated in recruiting troops to reinforce the 28th U.S. Colored Infantry.\n\nThe 28th U.S. Colored Infantry was first mustered in April of 1864, about four months before Shadd Cary was officially appointed a recruiting officer.[20] The men of this regiment quickly faced great adversity when they fought in the Battle of the Crater on July 30, 1864, losing 88 men (11 killed, 64 wounded, and 13 missing).[21] Shadd Cary was officially appointed a recruiting officer two weeks later. The July 30th losses, combined with the earlier July 17th call for more volunteers, likely generated enough urgency to make the Indiana government willing to officially appoint Shadd Cary as a recruiting officer, despite her sex.\n\nWhile recruiting men for the Indiana regiment, Shadd Cary filled what little free time she had with other duties. She sought donations for the Mission School, a racially integrated Canadian school that herself and Amelia Freeman Shadd, her sister, operated.[22] She also worked as a traveling agent collecting donations for the Colored Ladies Freedmen’s Aid Society.[23]\n\nBy late 1864, Shadd Cary completed her recruiting duties and returned to Canada where she lived until the Civil War concluded.[24] She would later move to Washington D.C. where she served as a principal for three schools and eventually earned a law degree from Howard University.[25]\n\nMary Ann Shadd Cary’s career as an Army recruiter is incredibly unique on account of her sex. Although historians believe women such as Sojourner Truth and Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin encouraged Black men to enlist, to be formally appointed as a recruiting officer and paid for that work was a unique position for a woman.[26] The uniqueness of Mary Ann Shadd Cary’s story does not make her role as an Army recruiter any less important. Uncovering stories like these are how we, as historians, can create a more accurate image of American history.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nGabrielle McCoy earned her BA in History from the University of Maryland.
