On August 22, 1864, he died at Point Lookout, Maryland, of bilious fever. Section 197, lot 27246.\n\nSPEAIGHT (or SPRAIGHT), WILLIAM A. (1826-1889). Captain, 7th Regiment, New York State Militia, Company E. After enlisting as a captain at New York City on April 17, 1861, he was commissioned into the 7th Regiment on April 26, and mustered out at New York City on June 3. When his regiment was reactivated in 1862, and part of the New York State National Guard, he was commissioned on May 25, and mustered out at New York City on September 5.\n\nThe New York City Directory of 1877 indicates that Speaight was in the blankbook business (ledgers, journals and other blank-paged books). According to his obituary in the New York Herald, he was a member of Lafayette Post #140 of the G.A.R. and the Veteran Association of the 7th Regiment; members of both groups were invited to attend his funeral. He last resided at 93 Wilson Street, Brooklyn. Sarah A. Speaight, who is interred with him, applied for and received a widow’s pension in 1891, certificate 424,354. Section 79, lot 10607.\n\nSPEIR, SAMUEL FLEET (1838-1895). Physician. A native of New York City, his father, Robert Speir, was a noted, wealthy merchant and his mother, Hannah Fleet Speir, descended from one of the first families that settled in Northport, Long Island, in 1650. Educated at the Polytechnic Institute and by private tutors, he graduated from the Medical Department of the University of New York in 1860 with high honors, then studied in Europe.\n\nSpier introduced the use of plaster of paris splints in the Union Army in 1862. He chartered two boats, at the request of the Sanitary Commission, and together with three assistants, went to the front lines of the Army of the Potomac to demonstrate their use. He received the thanks of the Commission, an agency that provided for improved medical and social needs of soldiers.\n\nIn 1864, Spier was appointed surgeon of the Brooklyn Eye and Ear Infirmary. He was renowned in his field for his publications and work in surgery, oncology and pathology. Active in charitable work, he established the Helping Hand Dispensary and a seaside sanitarium for children in Coney Island where he served as a consulting physician. A member of numerous medical societies including the New York State Medical Society, the New York Academy of Medicine, the Kings County Medical Society and the New York Pathological Society, he was invited to attend the prestigious International Medical Congress at Philadelphia in 1876.\n\nSpeir founded the Robins Island Club, a resort for men of which he was president and was a member of the Hamilton, Brooklyn, and Crescent Clubs. In eulogizing him, a colleague noted, “…Few physicians have carried more hope and comfort to their patients than he….” According to his obituary in The New York Times, he had a collection of exotic plants at his Bensonhurst house and had one of the finest kennels in the country; many of his dogs were awarded prizes at shows. He had a house in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, overlooking Gravesend Bay, and had his office at 162 Montague Street in Brooklyn. Section 165, lot 26697.\n\nSPENCER, HIRAM P. (1826-1910). Corporal, 3rd Connecticut Light Artillery; private, 1st Connecticut Heavy Artillery, Company B. On May 22, 1861, Spencer, a resident of Derby, Connecticut, enlisted as a private and mustered immediately into the 1st Connecticut. He mustered out on May 21, 1864. A few months later, then a resident of Naugatuck, Connecticut, he re-enlisted as a corporal and mustered into the 3rd Connecticut Light Artillery (company unknown) on September 9, 1864. He was promoted to sergeant on March 1, 1865. He mustered out at Virginia on June 23, 1865.\n\nIn 1892, his application for an invalid pension was approved under certificate 853,288. Spencer’s pension index also notes service in Company B of the 4th Connecticut Infantry. As per his obituary in the Brooklyn Standard Union, he worked for many years for the Ansonia Clock Company. His last address was 558 11th Street in Brooklyn. Section 122, lot 17806, grave 403.\n\nSPENCER, WILLIAM W. (1841-1914). Captain, 20th Connecticut Infantry, Companies A, D, and B. A New Yorker by birth, Spencer lived in Cheshire, Connecticut, when he enlisted as a sergeant on July 29, 1862. He mustered into Company A of the 20th Connecticut on September 8, and was simultaneously promoted to second lieutenant and commissioned into Company D of the regiment on June 6, 1863. Spencer was promoted to first lieutenant and transferred to Company B on April 21, 1864. Although he was promoted to captain on June 6, 1865, he never mustered in at that rank. He mustered out on June 13, 1865, at Fort Lincoln in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1905, Spencer’s application for a pension was approved under certificate 1,072,802. As per his obituary in the New York Herald, which confirms his Civil War service, he was a member of the G.A.R. and the Royal Arcanum. He last lived at 41 East 22nd Street in Manhattan. Spencer died of nephritis. Section 119, lot 500.\n\nSPERRY, ROBERT J. (1849-1893). Midshipman mate, United States Navy. Sperry enlisted as a midshipman mate in the United States Navy on September 8, 1862 (although another record states November 26), and was dishonorably discharged on January 8, 1863. He re-enlisted on January 18, 1864, and was honorably discharged on December 27, 1865. During his service, he was aboard the USS Saranac and the USS Wateree. Sperry was reappointed on April 18, 1866, and discharged on September 18, 1868.\n\nSperry’s original application for a Navy invalid pension in 1880 was rejected in 1883 because of his dishonorable discharge. In his application, Sperry cited deafness of right ear, rheumatism, catarrh, and laryngitis. In 1892, he received a pension because of “inability to earn and support by manual labor,” certificate 25,870. He last lived at 221 Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn. Francis Sperry, who is interred with him, applied for and received a widow’s pension, certificate 13,614. Section 35, lot 3049.\n\nSPICER, JOHN W. (1831-1891). First sergeant, 7th Regiment, New York State Militia, Company H. A native New Yorker, Spicer served as a first sergeant for 30 days in 1861 with the 7th Regiment. In 1891, his application for an invalid pension was granted, certificate 328,348. As per his obituary in the New York Herald, he was a member of the Seventh Regiment Veteran Corps; his comrades were invited to attend his funeral. He last lived in Hinsdale, Massachusetts. Section 76, lot 11340.\n\nSPIES, FRANCIS (1840-1893). Private, 7th Regiment, New York State Militia, Company K. Brooklyn-born, he served during the 7th Regiment’s activation of 30 days in 1861. A wealthy man, who according to the 1880 census, employed two cooks, a waiter, a laundress and a nurse at home, he studied with a banker, was associated with the firm of Marcial & Co. at 36 Broadway in Manhattan which he eventually bought, and conducted affairs with Central and South America. When he applied for a passport in 1891, he listed his profession as merchant and described himself as 5’10” tall with a high forehead, florid complexion, grey hair, blue eyes, Roman nose and pointed chin.\n\nSpies served as consul general of Ecuador and at the time of his death was vice consul of Honduras, having dedicated the monument to Christopher Columbus at 59th Street and Eighth Avenue in Manhattan in 1892. At one time, he was president of a corporation that owned the Panama Star and Herald, a paper that wielded influence in South American affairs. He was a member of the Seventh Regiment Veteran Corps and the Lafayette Post #140 of the G.A.R. Also active in civic organizations, he belonged to the Down Town Club, the Democratic Club, the Produce Exchange, the Chamber of Commerce, the Maritime Exchange and the Tammany Hall General Committee.\n\nHis wife, Amelia, was the daughter of Christian Schwarzwaelder (see), the president of the Germania Bank, who upon his death gave her the bulk of his substantial fortune. An article in The New York Times, dated June 22, 1893, gave details of Spies’s death the previous day, a suicide in which he shot himself in the head with a revolver. His lawyer is quoted in The Times as saying that Spies suffered from sunstroke, a condition that first afflicted him during the Civil War and that he had been depressed. Spies was found dead in his bathroom by his servant who was with him shortly before the incident. A follow-up article on June 25 noted that many checks sent to his business from South America could not be cashed until his wife returned from her trip to Europe because no one had authority to endorse them. Section 141, lot 23547.\n\nSPINNEY, JOSEPH (1805-1882). Acting master, United States Navy. Born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, he entered the merchant service at age fourteen. As per his obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, he was the captain of large steamers that sailed in the Southern trade. In that capacity, he was the commander of the first steamer that sailed from New York to Charleston, South Carolina. Spinney engaged in action in the Florida and Mexican Wars.\n\nIn 1861, Spinney was at the helm of the USS Satellite on July 12 when the vessel was commissioned at the New York Navy Yard. A day later, the Satellite headed for the Potomac region where it engaged in action for two years. On February 15, 1862, she assisted the Harriet Lane when that ship was disabled. That April, the Satellite was sent to Rappahannock where together with the Island Belle captured the Confederate sloop, Reindeer, and the schooners, Sarah Ann and Sabine. After repairs, she was sent to Fort Monroe, Virginia, and returned to Rappahannock that November. After capturing numerous Confederate schooners in the spring and summer of 1863, the Satellite was captured on August 12 while under the command of Lieutenant John Taylor Wood, a grandson of Zachary Taylor and nephew of Jefferson Davis. On August 28, the Satellite was scrapped to prevent its recapture by Union forces.\n\nSpinney retired from the Navy after the War, and returned to Brooklyn. His obituary notes that his experience as a seaman served him well when his family was ship-wrecked off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and that he could sail in heavy fog from New York to Charleston Harbor without dropping anchor. An active member of the Methodist Church, he last lived with his son-in-law at 62 Livingston Street in Brooklyn. Section 55, lot 13614.\n\nSPINOLA, FRANCIS BARRETO (1821-1891). Brigadier general, United States Volunteers. Born in Old Field, near Stony Brook, Long Island, Spinola was educated at the Quaker Hill Academy in Dutchess County, New York. A lawyer, he moved to Brooklyn and became involved in local Democratic Party politics. After serving as an alderman from 1846 through 1847 and then from 1849 through 1853, he was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1855, was a state senator from 1858-61, and was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1860.\n\nWhen the Civil War broke out, Spinola was commissioner of New York Harbor. He actively recruited soldiers in New York, organized and headed four regiments of the “Empire” brigade. On October 2, 1862, he was commissioned brigadier general of volunteers “for meritorious conduct in recruiting and organizing a brigade of four regiments and accompanying them into the field.” During his service, he took command after Gettysburg and was wounded near Manassas Gap, Virginia, when he pursued General Robert E. Lee’s army from that site. He then led the Keystone Brigade, to which he gave the following address on May 28, 1863, upon his transfer to the Excelsior Brigade.\n\nI avail myself of this opportunity of saying to the officers and men of the Keystone Brigade that the time has arrived for me to take my leave of you; and, as your term of service will soon expire, many of you, I presume, will abandon the scenes and excitement of the battle-field again to assume your usual pursuits of industry. In parting allow me to assure you that I entertain an exalted opinion of you both as officers and soldiers; and, in my official character, I thank you for the prompt and cheerful manner in which you have ever performed your arduous and dangerous duties,–and I shall always look back upon my association with you as among the pleasantest hours of my life. You were put under my command at a time when you were fresh from your native state, and, with a few exceptions, entirely unacquainted with the toils and dangers of war: you were placed in no “school of instruction” but marched directly to the front, where you have remained performing your duty in a manner reflecting great credit on yourself and great honor upon your State.\n\nYour march from Suffolk, Va., to Newbern, N.C., has no equal since the war began except in General Banks’ retreat from Winchester,–and that differed from yours in this important particular,–yours was forward of the enemy, his was from them. Your conduct at Mill Creek and White Oak River was equal to that of veteran troops: Your march to Pollocksville, for the purpose of encompassing the enemy at the second battle of Newbern, developed your powers of endurance, and, at once, gave you a prominent place among the best troops in this service.\n\nWhile aboard transport in front of the Rebel batteries on the Pamplico River you were both willing and anxious to incur any risk, or to encounter any danger necessary to relieve the beleaguered city of Washington, N.C., and no troops in the army could have manifested greater willingness to make any necessary sacrifice to reinforce the garrison and to relieve it from the perils which surrounded it; but authority higher than either you or me checked your patriotic desires.\n\nYour conduct at Blount’s Creek fully developed your impetuous desires to encounter the enemy, and no soldier ever retired from the battle-field with greater reluctance, after it had been demonstrated that the column could not advance owing to the destruction of the bridges which crossed the stream.\n\nYour reconnaissance to “New Hope School House” was all that could have been asked of any troops; it was a success in every particular.\n\nYour march to, and occupancy of Swift Creek Village, with its accompanying sharp skirmishing, as you approached the place and drove the Rebels from its precipitate flight, at the dead hour of night, were worthy of the “Old Guard” of Napoleon.\n\nYour conduct throughout has been of a character that has placed the Brigade in an enviable position: intemperance and immoral practices, as well as vice in its many forms, have been strangers to the Officers and Soldiers of the Keystone Brigade. Instead of participating and indulging in the practices which are so prevalent and demoralizing among soldiers, have invariably been found on the Sabbath day joining with each other in prayer and uniting your voices in singing praises to the Great Ruler of all.\n\nNo cause can fail my Countrymen, when supported by such men as constitute the Keystone Brigade: You have done your whole duty to your Country, to your State, and to your families, in a manner that no man among you need be ashamed to acknowledge that he is one of the Keystone Brigade,–while the authorities of your State can, with pride, point to you as an emulation for others who are to follow you to the field!\n\nWe are all called upon to make some sacrifices in times like the present, but the American, who would not obey the call of his Country in her hour of peril, is unworthy of enjoying the benefits and blessings of a free government, which cost many lives and much treasure to establish. No army ever suffered like that of Washington! No men ever bore their sufferings with less murmuring than the brave patriots who pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honors, that you and I might enjoy civil and religious liberty! You need go no further than your own home to find the spot that gave shelter to the Father of his Country, together with the eleven thousand famishing patriots who wintered at Valley Forge, to which place they were traced by the blood which oozed from their unshod feet!\n\nAt the expiration of you term of service it is fair to presume that many of you, from age and other causes, will not again enter it; but, in the name of Liberty and a bleeding Country, I not only appeal to the young men of the Brigade to enlist again, but, I implore you, in the name of the men who suffered every conceivable hardship and privation in order to show to the despots of the world that man is capable of self government, that you will prove yourself the proud representatives of the patriots of ’76, and never quit the field until this diabolical attempt, to destroy the government which Washington and his associates gave us, has been ploughed out by the roots.\n\nSpinola was wounded in the right foot and abdomen at the Battle of Wapping Heights, Virginia, on July 23, 1863, an assault in which dozens of his men were injured and 18 men and two officers were killed. After returning to Brooklyn for treatment, he was on recruiting duty from October through January 1864. However, his military career was marred by scandal when he was relieved of field duty and recruitment responsibilities and was court-martialed on charges of corruption with bounty agents. His name was also mentioned in an article about the court-martial of Joseph Kerrigan (see), an examining physician whose office was next to Spinola’s recruiting station at Lafayette Hall in New York City. In that case, he was involved in a scheme to recruit unfit soldiers. That piece noted that officers on Spinola’s failed expedition to Washington, North Carolina, considered him to be a coward and an utter fool. Ultimately, although sentenced to dismissal, Spinola was allowed to resign on June 8, 1865. In August 1865, he was honorably discharged. According to Jack D. Welsh, M.D., in Medical Histories of Union Generals (1996, pp. 315-316), Spinola suffered from arthritis throughout his life that dated from his discharge and pain in his right shoulder that impeded movement as a result of a fall from his horse at New Bern, North Carolina.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Spinola went back to New York and returned to a career in business and political life. Active in the Italian-American community, he was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1877, 1881, and 1883. He was the first Italian-American elected to the United States Congress, serving the 10th District beginning in 1886 until his death in 1891. In the House of Representatives, he was a member of the committees on military affairs and War claims. He last lived in Westminster, New York, but died in Washington, D.C.

Bandleader, 13th Regiment, New York State Militia; 4th Regiment, United States Artillery, Band Company. Spiticchi was born in Messina, Sicily, where his father was a well-to-do port inspector. As per the records of a descendant, Raphael and his two brothers, Carlos and Pietro, attended a music conservatory in Italy; family lore has it that students at the school played for the king. Pietro and Raphael Spiticchi signed on as sailors for their voyage to America in 1849; Carlo came to the United States in 1856 and joined his brothers in the service of the United States military. Military records show that Raphael and his brothers were musicians during their service. Raphael Spiticchi first served as a musician on the USS Constitution with the United Sates Navy after enrolling at Messina in Sicily from August 10, 1849 through January 23, 1851; he was discharged as a second class musician. He is listed as a musician living in Brooklyn on the 1855 New York State census. He was then a corporal and musician with the 4th Regiment, United States Artillery Band from March 4, 1851 through January 4, 1856, at Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, and then was promoted to sergeant and sent to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from January 4, 1856 through November 24, 1860; he was discharged at Fort Randall, South Dakota.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Spiticchi first served as a bandleader with the 13th Regiment, New York State Militia, from May 5, 1861 through August 6, 1861. As of August 27, 1861 through July 18, 1864, he was bandleader and bandmaster of the 4th Regiment, United States Artillery Band at Fort McHenry, Maryland; the 4th was also at Fort Monroe, Virginia, and Fort Washington, Maryland. Spiticchi was listed during that enrollment as being with his unit at Newton, Massachusetts; he was paid $325 by the state on July 18. Subsequently, he enrolled in the 4th Regiment, United States Artillery Band, on July 19, 1864, and was discharged at Maryland on March 28, 1867. His records for that enlistment indicate that he was a musician who was 5′ 6½” tall with brown eyes, dark hair and a dark complexion. At the time of his discharge as a private, military bands were abolished. As per his descendant, Raphael Spiticchi could play all of the band instruments except for the piano; he wrote music for that.\n\nOn July 5, 1868, Spiticchi married Ella Shute in Brooklyn; his marriage certificate states that he was a musician. He enlisted as a second class musician at the USS Vermont Naval Rendezvous on September 18, 1868 and was discharged on December 14, 1868. He re-enlisted at the USS Vermont as a first class musician on March 14, 1870 and was discharged on March 13, 1871, at a receiving ship at New York City. He re-enlisted every year as a first class musician at the USS Vermont in March of 1872, 1873 and 1874 serving until June 30, 1874. The 1874 Brooklyn Directory lists him as a musician. Subsequently, Spiticchi was a bugler as of July 1, 1874 through May 31, 1875, when he was discharged. He re-enlisted the next day as a bugler on the USS Vermont until September 30 and then served on the USS Minnesota from October 1, 1875 through June 11, 1876. He re-enlisted on the USS Minnesota the next day as a second class musician and was discharged on July 7, 1876. He then enlisted as a landsman on July 19, 1878, and was discharged on August 31, 1878. He last served as a landsman on the USS Minnesota from November 27, 1878 through June 30, 1879. According to the 1880 census, which used the surname of Spedick (an Americanization that the family used), he lived at 107 Hall Street in Brooklyn with his wife and six children and worked as a musician. The 1888-1890 Brooklyn Directory identifies him as a musician.\n\nSpiticchi applied for a pension from the Navy but the commissioner wrote to him on March 31, 1887, that his petition had been disallowed because he did not serve an aggregate of ten years; this was disputed in a letter on July 2, 1891, outlining all of his service but there is no evidence that a pension was received. In 1890, Spiticchi’s application for an invalid pension for his service in the United States Army, citing varicose veins, asthma, rheumatism and general debility, was notarized in Brooklyn; that document only specified his last enlistment on July 19, 1864 and was approved under certificate 677,395. His pension index card has the notation-See Navy Special Order 10679 filed November 18, 1885.\n\nAs per the 1892 New York State census, Spiticchi was living with Brooklyn with his wife and five children; still working as a musician, he was identified as a citizen on that document. At the time of his death, he was married and lived at 107 Hall Street in Brooklyn. His death was attributed to heart disease. Shortly after his death, Ella Spiticchi applied for and was granted a widow’s pension, certificate 398,968. Section 127, lot 3139.\n\nSPONBERG (or SPONGBERG, SPANGBURG), CHARLES (?-1863). Acting third assistant engineer, United States Navy. Born Carl Magnus Spangburg, he is memorialized on his monument at Green-Wood and borne on the Navy’s rolls as Charles Sponberg. He began his service in the Navy as an acting third assistant engineer of April 28, 1863. As per his mother’s pension application, he was first assigned to the USS Mercedita, from which he was transferred to the USS Weehawken on August 15.\n\nSponberg drowned on December 6, 1863, when the USS Weehawken was lost at sea. The vessel, an iron-clad monitor, was commissioned at Jersey City, New Jersey, in mid-January 1863. Originally at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, on April 7, 1863, the Weehawken was struck by over 50 enemy cannon balls. After repairs, she was in the waters off Georgia and on June 17, 1863, captured the CSS Atlanta as well as two Confederate officers who would one day be interred at Green-Wood: Major Reid Sanders (see) and Second Assistant Engineer Leslie King (see). Returning to Charleston, South Carolina, the Weehawken assisted in the bombardments of Forts Wagner and Sumter. After being grounded on September 7, she was repaired and became part of the blockade off Charleston that October. The Weehawken, whose officers and crew were mostly from Brooklyn, suddenly sunk in a gale while at anchor off Charleston on December 6. Four engineers who couldn’t escape the flood and 27 other crewmen perished. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle reported on this tragedy on December 12:\n\n…That poor Monitor fleet, which went forth with colors flying, carrying the hopes of the nation with it, has met disaster at every turn, encountered obstacles and sustained repulse, been battered and bruised, and finally settled down at anchorage not far from Morris Island. Even here it has been pursued, and the winds of Heaven with the waves of the ocean have destroyed and pushed down from sight, one of its best and strongest, and most vaunted components.\n\nThere was much speculation as to the cause of the Weehawken’s sinking. One admiral attributed it to damage suffered while aground under fire of the Sullivan Island batteries that strained the rivets on its bottom plates. John Ericcson, who pioneered ironclad construction, attributed the sinking to water entering the anchor hoister hatch after it had been accidentally left open by a crew member. Ultimately, the inquiry concluded that a heavy load of ammunition, open hatches and a failure to level the ship after it had taken on water caused the sinking.\n\nIn 1866, Anna Sophia Spangburg, the mother of Carl (or Charles) applied for a pension from the Navy based on her son’s service and death. A letter in support of her application from the Legation of Sweden and Norway stated that Mrs. Spangburg was a Swedish citizen and that Carl was her only child. However, the pension request was denied on the grounds that her husband was “not physically incapable of supporting his wife.” Although crews attempted to bring up the Weehawken as early as December 1863, it took eight years before the ship and her crew members who perished there were brought back up. The remains of the men were then recovered and given proper burial.\n\nThe funeral ceremony was detailed in an article in The New York Times on September 27, 1871. As per that account, the pageant began at the Brooklyn Navy Yard when a small box, containing the bones of the four deceased men, was deposited into a beautiful rosewood casket decorated with silver. A large silver plate which was placed upon the casket read, “This coffin contains the remains of four officers of the United States Navy, attached to the Weehawken, which foundered off Charleston, S.C., Dec. 6, 1863: H. W. MERIDEN (sic), Third Assistant Engineer; AUGUSTUS MITCHELL, Third Assistant Engineer; GEORGE W. MCGOWAN, Acting Third Assistant Engineer; and CHARLES SPONBERG, Acting Third Assistant Engineer.” The funeral procession began at noon with a detachment from the Vermont playing Auld Lang Syne. The cortege was led by the Band, followed by a detachment of Marines, sailors from the Man-of-War, the casket flanked by pall-bearers, a delegation from the Freemasons, and friends and relatives. The detachment of marines fired the customary funeral volleys at the gravesite. The Times noted that rain fell during the cortege and graveside ceremony adding a note of solemnity to the occasion.\n\nHenry Merian (see), Augustus Mitchell (see), George N. McGowan and Charles Sponberg are remembered in a monument at Green-Wood erected in 1871 and dedicated to their valiant efforts. The monument has a carving on its front that states it was erected by Frances Mitchell, who purchased the lot and is likely the mother of Augustus Mitchell and J. J. Merian, likely the father of Henry Merian. On one side the inscription reads: “SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF FOUR OFFICERS OF THE U.S. NAVY WHO LOST THEIR LIVES BY BEING DROWNED ON THE U.S. MONITOR WEEHAWKEN TO WHICH THEY WERE ATTACHED WHEN SHE FOUNDERED OFF CHARLESTON, S. C. DECEMBER 6, 1863.” The opposite side of the monument is inscribed: , “THE REMAINS WERE EXHUMED FROM THE ENGINE ROOM OF THE WRECKED MONITOR WHERE THEY NOBLY FELL AT THEIR POST OF DUTY.

In her affidavit of August 21, 1908, Ms. Stanley claims that her husband’s discharge papers are lost but that the “Chief of Bureau” will send records to the commissioner of pensions. She confirmed his service on the USS Franklin, USS Minnesota, the USS Tyota, and the USS Plymouth but indicated that he served during Civil War from 1861-1865. She also attested that he died from consumption which he contracted while in service.

He was killed while in the faithful discharge of his duty at the storming of Antietam Bridge Maryland in the morning of September 17th 1862. Our joy at gaining the victory that day has been restrained by our remembrance of the brave men who fell—the faces of our comrades once so familiar that are lost to us, and more than that, the grief that we know will be brought to the home of our noble brother who has rendered his life a sacrifice to prove his devotion to our country, flag, and constitution. Your husband died at the moment of victory. Our Regiment with the Brigade had been ordered forward by Genl. Burnside to advance to the Bridge where the rebels were posted in strong force. They were the Brigade of sharpshooters called “Toombs Brigade” consisting I believe of Georgia, S. Carolina and Mississippi riflemen. The action lasted about one hour before poor Tom fell. He heard as he died the shout of victory. A noble death! but to you a stroke which I fear no words of mine can render alleviation. I humbly pray to my God that he will be with you in your affliction.\n\nHis grave is in the valley near the bridge, fifteen of his comrades lie there with him. I have caused an inscription to be placed over him. A final statement of his effects will be sent forward today to Washington. I enclose a lock of his hair. If you make application by letter to the Adjutant General at Washington you will get information as to the final settlement with the government. There are parties in New York who assist in procuring these settlements. If you make application to the Adjt. Genl Major LeGendre of our Regt. who is in New York in Broadway near Reade St. or to Elliott Shepard in Wall St. I regret not being able to give you more information in this reference, but trust that you will find plenty of sympathizing friends who will interest themselves in your behalf. I would suggest Gen. Crooke as a proper adviser.\n\nAgain dear madame let me assure you of my deep sympathy in your loss and believe your sincere friend.\n\nSamuel H. Sims\n\nCapt. Co.
