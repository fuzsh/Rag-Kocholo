He became a hero during the Battle of Spotsylvania in Virginia on May 18, 1864.\n\nOn March 2, 1897 he was awarded the Medal of Honor. The citation of his heroics reads: “The President of the United States of America, in the name of Congress, takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to Corporal John Kinsey, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism on 18 May 1864, while serving with Company B, 45th Pennsylvania Infantry, in action at Spotsylvania, Virginia. Corporal Kinsey seized the colors, the Color Bearer having been shot, and with great gallantry succeeded in saving them from capture.” McKenzie died December 19, 1904, and was buried in Crown Hill.\n\nLocation: Section 21, Lot 1; GPS (39.8180281,-86.1769348)"
