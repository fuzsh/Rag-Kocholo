        "text": "Welcome to Shenandoah University’s Shenandoah River Campus at Cool Spring Battlefield.\n\nOn July 18, 1864, the 195 acres that now comprise the Campus at Cool Spring Battlefield played an important role in the Battle of Cool Spring—the largest and bloodiest Civil War battle fought in Clarke County. Shenandoah University invites you to use this guide to explore important elements of the Battle of Cool Spring. Please feel free to either take this guide home with you or return it to the kiosk after the tour, but whatever you decide please help spread the word about this valuable historic resource.\n\nThis orientation video was created by students in Prof. Jonathan A. Noyalas’ HIST 309 (Interpreting Civil War Sites) class during the spring 2020 semester. The following students, Ryan Endress, Caitlyn Graulau, Bobby Harvey, Gavin Horning, Kimberley Oliveto, Jay Richardson, Nicole Roland, David Skinner, Steven Stabler, and Corey Williams, assisted with this project. All images used in this production are courtesy of the following: the Library of Congress, Shenandoah University’s McCormick Civil War Institute, Jonathan Noyalas, and Nicholas Picerno.\n\n“Though Their Eyes” Augmented Reality Tour Experience\n\nDownload on Google Play Download in the App Store\n\nDownload the app for an immersive audio tour. Walk the battlefield and hear an audio account of particular soldiers and their experiences while also learning what happened to that soldier, either at Cool Spring or in the conflict’s aftermath. The app uses GPS satellite data to determine where the participant is on the battlefield and syncs this with specific soldiers’ accounts.\n\nExplore the Lives of Enslaved People at the Retreat\n\nDownload The Retreat & The Era of Slavery\n\nTo learn more about the Battle of Cool Spring read Jonathan A. Noyalas, “The Blood-Tinted Waters of the Shenandoah”: The 1864 Valley Campaign’s Battle of Cool Spring (Savas Beatie, 2024). To purchase a copy of the book click HERE. All proceeds from the sale of this book support MCWI’s educational and interpretive efforts at Cool Spring.\n\nTouring the Battlefield\n\nThe tour begins at the kiosk located near the end of the parking lot located closest to the Shenandoah River. The walking tour is approximately 2 miles round-trip and takes you over some uneven terrain so please watch your step. Please see the trail map on the last page of this guide to assist you in navigating the property. Tour markers are also located along the trail to assist in navigation.\n\nThe Aftermath & Confederate Withdrawal\n\nThroughout the day on July 19 pickets exchanged fire and occasionally one side fired an artillery shell across the river, but little fighting took place that day. While Union and Confederate troops stared at each other Gen. Early received some startling news at his headquarters in Berryville—that a Union force commanded by Gen. William Averell was marching from Martinsburg to Winchester. Fearful that Averell might strike his rear, Early pulled his army west toward Winchester and then south to Strasburg on the night of the 19th. With Early’s force gone, Union troops crossed the Shenandoah River on the 20th. As Union soldiers walked the ground on the river’s western side—Westwood and Cool Spring Farms—they saw some of their comrades killed in the fighting on July 18 half-buried, others “partly eaten by hogs,” and some stripped completely naked.\n\nThe Confederate success at Cool Spring would be among the last Confederate forces enjoyed in the Shenandoah Valley. After Early’s victory at the Second Battle of Kernstown on July 24 and Confederate general John McCausland’s burning of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, six days later President Abraham Lincoln and Gen. Ulysses S. Grant charted a new course for Union operations in the Shenandoah Valley by creating the Middle Military Division (popularly known as the Army of the Shenandoah). By the end of the first week of August, Gen. Philip H. Sheridan took command of the Army of the Shenandoah and by October 19—with victory at the Battle of Cedar Creek—Union forces finally wrested the Shenandoah Valley from a once firm Confederate grip.\n\nCounting the Battle’s Cost\n\n“Never since the sound of the rifle was heard in this beautiful Valley have the ‘sea green’ waters of the Shenandoah have been so reddened… as on this afternoon.”\n\nNorth Carolina Standard, August 10, 1864\n\n20% of the Union and Confederate soldiers killed or mortally wounded at the battle were married.\n\nThe oldest Union soldier killed in the battle was Private Peter Hersch, 54th Pennsylvania Infantry. A resident of Somerset County, Pennsylvania, Hersch was fifty-two-years-old at the time of his death. He was survived by his wife, Mary, and his children William, Silas, and Mary Ann. Hersch is buried in the Winchester National Cemetery, grave 660.\n\nThe oldest Confederate soldier killed in the battle was Corporal Louis Redmon Wells, 30th North Carolina Infantry. A native of Tarboro, North Carolina, Wells was forty-eight-years-old at the time of his death. Wells left behind a wife and six children. The whereabouts of his remains are unknown.\n\nPrivate Washington Hiatt, 15th West Virginia Infantry, was the youngest Union soldier to perish at Cool Spring. Fifteen-years-old at the time of the battle Hiatt enlisted in the 15th West Virginia on March 20, 1864. Hiatt drowned in Parker’s Hole during the Union withdrawal on the night of July 18. His remains were never recovered.\n\nPrivate William Shofner, 53rd North Carolina Infantry, was the youngest Confederate soldier to die from wounds received at Cool Spring. He enlisted in the regiment on April 18, 1864, at the age of eighteen. Shofner died from wounds received at Cool Spring on July 27, 1864.\n\nUnion Casualties (5,000 Engaged) Confederate Casualties (8,000 Engaged) Killed 65 80 Wounded 301 300 Missing/ Captured 56 17 Total 422 397\n\nSuggested Reading\n\nGold, Thomas D.
