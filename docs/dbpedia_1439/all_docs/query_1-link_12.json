        "text": "It is not our intent to do a Hoggatt genealogy here - we merely wish to give an outline of those Hoggatts/Hocketts who were connected to other families on this Web Site.\n\nA word about spelling - North Carolina Quaker records give the name as Hoggatt; the sign for the house above gives it as Hogat; and North Carolina land records give it as Hoggatt and Hoggett. One finds it as Hockett in later records. As references we have used Quaker records as found in the Encyclopedia of American Quaker Genealogy by William Wade Hinshaw and family records in The Green County Pioneer November 1999, Vol 15, No 2. We have not been able to locate any records of the family in Chester County, Pennsylvania, including Quaker records.\n\nPhilip and Mary Glendennings Hoggatt\n\nPhilip Hoggatt was born 1/16/1686 in Berkshire, England, and died 1/26/1783 in Guilford County, North Carolina. Philip Hoggatt married Mary Glendennings about 1727, daughter of David and Margaret Hall Glendennings. She was born about 1698 and died 11/27/1780 in Guilford County, North Carolina. The children of interest to us are Anthony Hoggatt, born 12/30/1730 at Cedar Creek, Hanover County, Virginia; Joseph Hoggatt, born about 1735 in Virginia; John Hoggatt and William Hoggatt. We believe the Hoggatts settled originally in Pennsylvania as a North Carolina death record for one of William Hoggatt's sons, refers to William \"anciently of Pennsylvania.\"\n\nPhilip Hoggatt was received on certificate dated 10/11/1755 from Cedar Creek Monthly Meeting in Virginia. The certificate was received on 1/31/1756 at New Garden Monthly Meeting in Rowan County, North Carolina. We know from the date of the cabin above that Philip may have been in North Carolina earlier. As many pioneers did, he and sons may have come first to the area, built the cabin, and then went back for their families. As discussed below, some certificates for sons were received as early as 1753. It is entirely possible that the families came with them and then they later obtained their necessary Quaker certificates. When Deep River Meeting was begun in 1778 in Guilford County, the Hoggatts were probably charter members as there were no transfer certificates from New Garden. The Hoggatts lived nearer the Deep River Meeting so it was probably more convenient for them.\n\nThe deaths of Philip and Mary are recorded at Deep River Monthly Meeting. Philip Hoggatt died 1/26/1783, buried 26th, aged about 96 years. Mary Hoggatt, wife of Philip, died 11/17/1780, buried at Springfield 19th, aged about 82 years and was of family of Glendennings in Edinbrough in Scotland, dt. of David Glendennings. The Quaker records closely match information carried in family records.\n\nAnthony and Mary Stanley Hoggatt Family\n\nThe first Quaker record we have of Phillip and Mary's son and family is at New Garden Monthly Meeting in Rowan County, North Carolina. Anthony and wife were received on certificate from Camp Creek, Virginia, dated 11/9/1754. Family records tell us that Anthony married Mary Agnes Stanley, daughter of James and Catherine Hutchins Stanley on 5/12/1754 at Cedar Creek, Hanover County, Virginia.\n\nAnthony's birthdate is given as 12/8/1730 O. S. and Mary's as 6/27/1733 O.S. in New Garden records. They had the following children: Samuel (5/29/1755 N.S.); Agnes (12/25/1756); Philip (11/27/1758); Mary (2/10/1761); Anthony (12/11/1762); David and Jonathan (2/4/1765); Solomon (5/28/1767); Moses (10/22/1770); Joseph and Benjamin (12/9/1772). The children of further interest to us are sons Samuel and Philip.\n\nFor those interested, the family of Anthony and Mary Hoggatt can be followed through the records of New Garden and Deep River Monthly Meetings, Guilford County, North Carolina, and Westfield and New Hope Monthly Meetings in Tennessee. We will follow here only those children who had connections with relatives of the Woodward and Thornbrough families.\n\nSamuel Hoggatt Families - Son Samuel Hoggatt married three times: (1)Charity Mills, daughter of Henry and Hannah Thornbrough Mills, on 2/11/1779 at Deep River Monthly Meeting; (2) Lydia Hiatt, daughter of George and Martha Hiatt and widow of Uriah Hunt, son of William and Sarah Mills Hunt, on 5/5/1784 at New Garden Monthly Meeting; and (3) Mary Pinson, daughter of Richard and Maacah Pinson, on 1/30/1793 at Westfield Monthly Meeting in Tennessee. Samuel was granted a certificate from New Garden Monthly Meeting to marry and then remained in Tennessee for some time.\n\nSamuel and Charity Mills Hoggatt had one daughter, Charity Hoggatt, born 11/25/1779, as recorded at Deep River. Charity Mills Hoggatt died, as a result of the childbirth, on 12/24/1779 and is buried at Deep River Monthly Meeting. Daughter Charity Hoggatt married William Hiatt sometime before 6/5/1797 in Guilford County. She was dismissed on that date for marriage out of unity.\n\nLydia Hiatt Hunt Hoggatt, second wife of Samuel died on 4/16/1790, and is buried at New Garden Monthly Meeting. If they had children they are not among present Quaker records.\n\nSamuel and Mary Pinson Hoggatt had children Joel, Highla, Sarah, Josiah, Nathan, John, Isaac, Anna, Eda and Noah recorded at various Quaker Meetings in North Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee. The last three were born and recorded at Lost Creek Monthly Meeting at the time that Abraham Woodward was clerk of the Lost Creek Meeting.\n\nPhilip Hoggatt Family - Son Philip Hoggatt married Alice White on 10/17/1778 at New Garden Monthly Meeting. They had a son, David Hoggatt, born 9/2/1779 and recorded at New Garden Monthly Meeting. David Hoggatt married Sarah Thornbrough, daughter of Edward and Phebe Sumner Thornbrough, on 4/4/1805 at New Garden Monthly Meeting in Guilford County, North Carolina. They had a daughter Phebe born 1/29/1806 in North Carolina and then transferred on certificate dated 9/27/1806 to Miami Monthly Meeting in Ohio. They later transferred to Whitewater Monthly Meeting in Wayne County, Indiana, and later to Lees Creek and Cherry Grove (Randolph Co) Monthly Meetings in Indiana. Children recorded in various meetings and on transfer certificates were: Phebe (1/29/1806); Alice (2/2/1808); Mary (2/5/1810); Sarah (4/22/1812); Agness (2/7/1815); and Joseph (bef 1/16/1819).\n\nOther children of Philip and Alice are recorded at New Garden MM: Catharine (b 7/6/1782, d 10/12/1783); Mary (9/23/1784); Alca (3/16/1787, d. 4/4/1792); Ruth (10/19/1790); John (6/19/1793); Philip (2/10/1796). The family transferred to Fairfield Monthly Meeting in Ohio on 9/24/1808.\n\nJoseph and Phebe Haworth Hoggatt Family\n\nJoseph Hoggatt, son of Philip and Mary, married Phebe Haworth, daughter of Stephanus and Rachel Beeson Haworth, on 1/6/1763 at New Garden Monthly Meeting, Rowan County, North Carolina.\n\nJoseph and Phebe Haworth Hoggatt had children: Stephanus (1/7/1764); Philip (7/12/1764); Joseph (4/25/1768); Nathan (4/25/1770); Mahlon (6/13/1772); Phebe (9/19/1774); William (10/30/1779; and Zimri (11/25/1785). Philip and Mahlon are of further interest to us.\n\nPhilip and Mary Thornbrough Hoggatt Family - Philip Hoggatt, son of Joseph and Phebe Hoggatt, married Mary Thornbrough, daughter of Henry and Rachel Moon Thornbrough, on 8/15/1787 at Deep River Monthly Meeting, Guilford County, North Carolina. Records for children are missing in North Carolina but are given in Blue River Monthly Meeting, Washington County, Indiana. There is a notation at Springfield Monthly Meeting in North Carolina on 3/2/1811 that Philip and family were granted a certificate to Whitewater Monthly Meeting in Indiana. At Blue River Monthly Meeting, Washington County there is a notation on 10/26/1811 that the family was received on certificate from Springfield at Whitewater Monthly Meeting in Wayne County, Indiana, but went on to Blue River. Washington County was not formed until 1813 and was then formed from Clark, Harrison, and Jefferson Counties. This family was among the very, very early pioneers in Indiana. On our Indiana Map Page we have a link to a journal of a journey to Indiana in 1815 and also a link to some stories of the early days in Indiana. There was much trouble with the Indians at this early time and many of the Blue River young male Quakers were dismissed for joining the militia.\n\nChildren listed at Blue River are: Nancy (4/28/1788); Rachel (11/28/1789); Martha (7/1/1791); Mary (3/12/1793); Nathan (7/12/1795); Joseph (7/9/1797); Abner (6/9/1799); Elisha (5/14/1801); Sophia (no date given) and Christina (no date given). All were born in North Carolina as all are listed at Blue River upon receipt of the family's certificate from North Carolina.\n\nPhilip died 9/17/1743 and is buried in Old Blue River Cemetery in Indiana. Mary died 11/12/1843 and is also buried in Old Blue River Cemetery. The reference to the Old Cemetery probably means at the original Blue River Monthly Meeting which was set up 7/1/1815. The Blue River Hicksite Monthly Meeting was set up 5/3/1828 and the deaths of Philip and Mary are reported at the Hicksite Meeting.\n\nMahlon and Sarah Millikan Hoggatt - Mahlon Hoggatt, son of Joseph and Phebe Hoggatt, married Sarah Millikan, daughter of Samuel and Ann Baldwin Millikan, on 11/18/1795 at Springfield Monthly Meeting, Guilford County, North Carolina. Their children are recorded at Springfield MM: Phebe (8/6/1796); Samuel (12/28/1797) John (4/22/1800); Jacob (11/25/1801); Jesse (4/19/1805); Mahlon (5/24/1808); Anna (9/28/1811); Joseph (12/22/1813); Zimri (10/9/1816); and Benjamin (8/5/1821). Springfield Monthly Meeting records mention transfer certificates from Center MM on 4/11/1827 for Mahlon, a minister, and family. Remember that ministers were not in charge of meetings but were instead traveling emissaries for the Quaker religion.\n\nMarriages mentioned for the children are: Phebe married Job Reynolds 11/30/1814 at Center MM; John married (1)Hannah Wilson 12/22/1819 and (2)Lydia Leonard at Center MM (children recorded at Center); Jesse married Ann Carter (a Mendenhall descendant) 11/23/1825 at Springfield MM; Mahlon, Jr. married Louzena Davis 6/6/1835 at Deep Creek MM; Joseph married Elizabeth Piggott 8/12/1840 at Springfield; Zimri married Susannah J. Kendall 9/18/1840 at Springfield.\n\nSon Benjamin was granted a certificate to New Garden MM, Wayne County, Indiana on 10/9/1844. Daughter Anna was granted a certificate to New Garden on 11/13/1850 on the same date as Zimri and family. Joseph and Elizabeth were granted a certificate to Salem MM in Henry Co, Iowa on 8/9/1855; then back from Miami MM, Warren Co, Ohio on 12/8/1858 and then on 9/9/1868 to Plainfield MM, Hendricks Co, Ind. We wonder if Joseph was also a minister since he seemed to travel a great deal. When time permits we will check the records of the other monthly meetings and also check Indiana marriages.\n\nTo be continuedï¿½."
