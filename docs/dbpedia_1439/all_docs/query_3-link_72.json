        "meta_description": "The Church League of America, a right wing anti-communist research and advocacy group, collected these research files from other creators with a similar political outlook and professional activities: American Business Consultants Inc., the Wackenhut Corporation, and Karl Baarslag. All of these creators had connections to the intelligence agencies of the United States government, kept detailed research files on individuals and organizations, and were part of a right-wing research and information network that monitored Communists and other perceived threats to their interpretation of the American way of life. By the 1950s, the Wheaton, Illinois-based Church League of America had become a major force in right-wing anti-communist activity, and as other similar organizations faced difficulty, the Church League obtained their research files. American Business Consultants, Inc. was founded in 1947 and was a major force in McCarthy-era investigations into suspected Communist activity. Their for-profit weekly publication Counterattack and special report Red Channels provided readers with specific names and information on allegedly subversive individuals and organizations. As a result of the financial difficulties caused by ensuing libel suits, ABC transferred their research files to the Church League. Additional files came from the Wackenhut Corporation, which was founded in 1954 by George R. Wackenhut and other former FBI employees. The company, which provided private security to industry and government agencies, also kept extensive files on individuals, ostensibly to run background checks. The Wackenhut Corporation received many research files from Karl Baarslag who worked for such prominent anti-communists as Senator Joseph McCarthy, Church League of America, and the American Legion. Following the passage of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Wackenhut Corporation transferred many of its research files to the Church League. The research files contain newspaper and magazine clippings, reports, flyers, internal and external correspondence, pamphlets, brochures, circulars, and government publications. Counterattack's 1940s-1950s research activities are especially focused on entertainment, unions, suspected Communist Party fronts, foundations and individuals in public life suspected of subversive activities. Many of the Wackenhut documents and a series on student movements in California highlight the suspected connections between Communism, opposition to the Vietnam War, and the broader left counterculture of the 1960s, and document the right's evolving definition of \"subversion.\" The meticulous and thorough collecting activities that led to the creation of these research files makes them a strong source of information on Communists and the left from the 1940s-1970s, and taken as a whole they illustrate the right's interpretation of the political and cultural environment of the mid-twentieth century United States.",

        "text": "This subseries contains the research files of Counterattack on the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), the bulk of which were collected in the 1940s. ABC was interested in monitoring and understanding the operating procedures the CPUSA, its members, and other organizations they were involved in. ABC used their research to identify Communists in entertainment, business, and unions and implicate individuals and organizations in their publication. The research files consist of clippings, reports, flyers, pamphlets, circulars, internal correspondence, member lists, and other materials collected by Counterattack. Counterattack organized their files by district of the CPUSA and then by subject. Each file contains collected information on districts and groups within the CPUSA. The bulk of the material is New York based. Most districts of the CPUSA are underrepresented or are completely unrepresented in Counterattack's files. District files contain information pertaining to members and activities of the districts. Subject files are divided into cultural and educational activities, organizational policy, minority groups, youth, veterans, and organizational and tactical activities of the CPUSA. The series also contains CPUSA conference proceedings, articles, and other information on the Smith Act trials in 1949.\n\nThis subseries contains mostly research files of Counterattackon organizations that Counterattack viewed as possible Communist Party fronts, the bulk of which were collected in the 1940s. Much of the activity of the Communist Party took place in the context of working within mass organizations; those established by the Party were often referred to as front organizations. Mass organizations were usually devoted to a single issue or constituency and had a broader membership and political appeal than that of the official Party line. Some organizations within this series were known fronts, others were suspected fronts by ABC. The materials in this subseries afford a perspective of both anti-Communist efforts to expose front organizations as well as the leftist political agenda of these alleged fronts in terms of postwar domestic and foreign policy.\n\nThese organizations are mostly left organizations, including peace movements, political action and labor committees, progressive and civil rights groups, student organizations, schools and universities, and anti-fascist groups, including the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and other Spanish solidarity groups. The series also features multiple Communist country solidarity groups, including the National Council for American-Soviet Friendship. Documentation within each file is essentially an accumulation of information relating to certain suspected front organizations. Materials in the collection generally consist of newspaper clippings relating to the front's activities; pamphlets and other materials published by the front organization; leaflets, programs, and announcements of front rallies, meetings, and functions; and membership lists of fronts, including names and addresses. Counterattack gathered any information they could to build a case and prove that they were Communist affiliated. There are some correspondence between organization and the editors of Counterattack, in response to Communist accusations.\n\nThis subseries contains the research files of Counterattack on trade unions suspected of being controlled or influenced by Communists. The majority of the materials come from between 1946 and 1949, and reflect attacks on Communism in unions and the attempts of union leaders to defend themselves, as well as simple documentation of union actions.\n\nCounterattack acquired any information they could to build a case against a trade union and accuse them of having Communist sympathies in their publication or in their reports. They acquired information often through the use of mailing lists or through an informant. Files contain clippings, circulars, flyers, pamphlets, meeting minutes, membership lists, convention proceedings, and other material created by unions. The series also contains reports and internal correspondence created by Counterattack informants within the unions and the Counterattack research department. Most files are on American trade unions, many affiliated with the CIO and the AFL. Industries represented by the unions include manufacturing, entertainment, electrical, machine, retail, marine, textile, and service industries. This series also contains files on the Taft-Hartley Bill. There is a fair amount of material on union in-fighting over Communist sympathy. National unions are more widely represented. Most represented locals are based in New York.\n\nThis series contains the research files of Counterattack on specific individuals, both well-known and lesser-known, many of whom ABC suspected of having Communist affiliations. Some of the individuals highlighted by Counterattack are recognized in the film and television industry or known for their work as musicians, authors, politicians, religious leaders, political activists, newscasters, labor leaders, Communist Party leaders, or academics. The research files primarily consist of newspaper and magazine clippings, usually with names underlined or otherwise annotated, and Counterattack's internal reports on alleged Communists (though there are also some reports Counterattack prepared for outside parties). This series is also comprised of Counterattack's internal correspondence, as well as collected flyers, pamphlets, publications, and circulars, including materials created by the Communist Party.\n\nTo a much lesser extent, this series contains letters written to Theodore C. Kirkpatrick, Counterattack's managing editor, often with requests to research specific individuals. There are also several indexes which list references to individuals in other series of the Counterattack research files in this collection. Some of the indexes include references to the listed individuals in left-wing publications like The Daily Worker or Soviet Russia Today, in New York-based news sources such as the New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune, or in the reports on suspected subversive individuals compiled by Senator Jack B. Tenney, the chairman of the California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities. Other indexes include references to the individuals in this series in Appendix IX, a seven-volume compilation of names of people who participated in alleged Communist front organizations between 1930 and 1944, prepared for the House Un-American Activities Commission by J.B. Matthews and Benjamin Mandel. Some of the internal reports within this series are duplicated in Subseries VIII.\n\nSubseries V originally consisted of two series, \"Individuals Miscellaneous\" and \"Individuals Named.\" These series have been merged into one \"Individuals\" subseries by the archivists. Folders labeled \"Miscellaneous Individuals,\" which contained hundreds of names, have been divided into many smaller folders. The archivists also added names to folder titles for folders originally labeled \"Miscellaneous Individuals.\" This added description is indicated with square brackets. The names included in the folder titles were highlighted by ABC through underlining or other annotations. Names listed in the folder titles reflect the names which are repeated or most prevalent within the folders, but not every name within each folder is included in the folder titles.\n\nThis subseries mostly contains prepared reports created by Counterattack on individuals, unions, and other organizations, the bulk of which were created in the late 1940s and 1950s. These reports consist of information on activities and biographical and historical information on individuals and organizations that were considered Communist or sympathetic to Communists. These reports were a compilation of information that they collected, typed and often marked with one of the editors' initials in the corner of the report. The reports referenced any left-wing or Communist-linked activity of the individuals or organizations. Often these reports were created for people outside of ABC.\n\nIn addition to reports, reference requests toward Counterattack's research department are included; they consist of an internal reference sheet and handwritten notes on the researched individual. Indexes are also found in the series; cross-referencing individuals and organizations found in earlier series. Some of the indexes include references to the listed individuals in left-wing publications like The Daily Worker or Soviet Russia Today, in New York-based news source such as the New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune, or in the reports on suspected subversive individuals compiled by Senator Jack B. Tenney, the chairman of the California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities. Other indexes include references to the individuals in this series in Appendix IX. Some of the internal reports within this series are duplicated in Series V. Counterattack's numbering scheme is maintained on earlier series to aid cross-referencing. Some of these individuals and organizational reports are duplicates that appear in different series within the collection."
