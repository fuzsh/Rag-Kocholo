        "text": "If I've learned anything since moving to Joplin, it is that Missouri has a rich history. More than that, our state's history has always been very influential on the history of our great nation.\n\n​Rather than learn our history in a linear fashion (in the order events occurred), I've plugged in the birthdays of some of our famous citizens below. In this manner, I hope to emphasize the achievements and individual motivations and intrigue that drive individuals to success, rather than just memorize a list of places and dates.\n\nMany have asked, \"Why do we study a bunch of old, dead people?\" The answer is simple: we learn from history. If we fail to study the mistakes of others, we are destined to repeat them. If we don't study the triumphs of others, we will waste our time repeating the same experiments that have already been accomplished. Instead, let's build on the strengths of our strongest, and eliminate their mistakes.\n\nThere is an amazing poem by Linda Ellis. It is called The Dash. It causes one to appreciate the life that occurs between the two dates on a gravestone, and it urges us to reflect on the importance of the things we choose to do while we are alive on this planet. I hope that while we discover the wonderful contributions by the individuals in this list, we can also explore the possibilities and the potential that lie within ourselves."
