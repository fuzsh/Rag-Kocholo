        "text": "The Medical Profession of ButlerCounty\n\n(page 450) Perhaps no profession has had within its circle so many men of eminence as that of the medical profession in Hamilton and in Butler county. The name most familiar in this profession is that of Milikin. Dr. Daniel Millikin was Hamilton's first physician. In later years he was succeeded by Dr. Samuel Millikin and later by a man of the same name, Dr. Dan Millikin, who attained a national reputation as a diagnostician and general practitioner. He in time has been succeeded by Dr. Mark Millikin, his son, who is not only a physician but also a surgeon of some. note. Dr. Mark Millikin served during the world war in France as a captain in the United States army medical corps.\n\nThe early physicians of Hamilton were naturally who came in the early days of settlement, some to spend the remainder of their days, others merely as transients who later sought fame and fortune elsewhere. Dr. Jacob Lewis, who located in Hamilton in 1802, practiced but a short time until he became the surgeon of the First regiment, Ohio militia. Later, in 1805, Dr. J. Laurier practiced in Hamilton, followed in 1810 by Dr. Charles Este and later by Dr. John Slayback and Dr. John Reily. Other practitioners who located in Hamilton during its early days were Dr. Alexander Ramsey, Dr. A. Green, Dr. Jeremiah Woolsey, who lived in Rossville, and Dr. John C. Dunlevy, a native of Lebanon.\n\nIt was in 1824 that Dr. L. W. Smith, Dr. Henry Baker and Dr. Samuel Wood located in Hamilton, followed in 1826 by Dr. Laomi Rigdon, a native of Pennsylvania, who became not only a leading physician but also a religious and social leader, and for whom Rigdon street was later named. Dr. Rigdon was for ten years a practicing (page 451) partner of Dr. John C. Dunlevy and later was associated, until his death, with Dr. Cyrus Falconer.\n\nIn still later years,. Dr. H. Symmes opened an office over Latta's drug store, followed shortly afterward by Dr. William Kelley and Dr. Joel B. McFarland, who was a member of the Ohio state legislature in 1841-1842. Dr. Samuel Miller was also a practitioner in Hamilton during the late 30's, while Dr. Otho Evans came to Hamilton in 1839 and rapidly built up a large and lucrative practice. Dr. Eli Vance conducted a drug store and a general practice for several years succeeding 1846, while Dr. Riddell established himself in Rossville in 1838.\n\nIt was in 1838 that Dr. Andrew Campbell located in Hamilton, having offices in the Hamilton house, then standing at the northwest corner of Second and High streets. Drs. Baldridge and Goodall were practicing physicians in Rossville during this period, while Dr. Samuel Millikin had a large practice. A man who left a deep impress upon Hamilton by his personality and his influence was Dr. Jacob Hittel. He came from Pennsylvania in 1842 and was engaged in active practice until 1865, when he returned to his birthplace, where he died in 1878. Another physician who became a man of great influence in the community and a religious leader, especially among the Baptists, was Dr. William H. Scobey, who located in Hamilton in 1842, and continued the practice of medicine until 1884, when he retired. Men whose names for years were household words in Hamilton because of their success in the practice of their profession were Dr. Cyrus Falconer, Dr. Hanbury Smith, Dr. William Huber and Dr. R. B. Millikin, while Dr. F. D. Morris, who died in 1866, had been rewarded with a large general practice. In 1866, Hamilton possessed twenty-one practicing physicians, many of whom are still well remembered by the older citizens. These physicians were Henry H. Mallor, W. W. Caldwell, Cyrus Falconer, George Dick, J. W. Gale. William Huber, Henry Krone, Jacob Hittel, Christian Forster, J. B. McDill, F. W. Major, Joseph S. McNeely, J. M. Dudley, Constantine Market, S. H.

Ellis; C. H. VonKlein, J. Trepold, and J. F. Stricker practiced in Hamilton. Dr. Samuel L. Beeler, William C. Miller and Aaron Myers were graduate physicians, but never engaged in practice, devoting their time to conducting drug stores. Other physicians who have practiced in Hamilton in recent years and who attained reputations for conscientious work, but who have passed to their rest, are Doctors Henry H. Mallory, George Trebel, J. L. Kirkpatrick, Constantine Market, O. P. McHenry, Thomas D. Sharkey, S. M. Schell, James H. Roll, Minor M. Jacobs, W. O. Mayer, William Huston, C. L. Ferris and William C.

One of the first men to do this was Dr. Littell, who located in Venice in 1808. Dr. Benjamin Clark, a native of New York, located in Venice in 1814. It was Dr. Clark who laid out Venice, giving it at that time the name of Venus, which was later made Venice, although the postoffice is Ross, to avoid a duplication of postoffice of the same name in the same state. Dr. Clark continued his practice in Venice until his death in 1826. Another early practitioner in Venice was Dr. John Wood, also a native of New York, who located in that village in 1816. Tradition says that he was a firm believer in the use of the lancer and in the letting of blood in all cases in which the patient's condition became acute. Dr. Wood removed to Illinois in 1828 and was immediately succeeded by Dr. Blackleach, a native of Warren county. He remained in Venice until 1839, his successor then being Dr. Prather, who is said to have been of a rather pugnacious nature, especially to other physicians. Finally, in 1853, he removed to Indianapolis, Indiana, when he was succeeded by Dr. R. P. Lamb, who practiced in the village until his death in 1847. Drs. Bradford, Cogley and Haines were also practitioners in Venice in the 40s, while in 1847 Dr. Scott located there. He practiced in the village for four years, when he removed to Paddy's Run, later New London, but now Shandon, where he met with great success until he retired to his farm near Venice. Another early practitioner at Venice was Dr. Waterhouse, who located there in 1854, but who soon turned his attention to theology and became a minister of the Methodist Epischurch. It was in 1858 that Dr. Stevens came from Lebanon, Ohio, to locate in Venice, where he remained until the civil war, when he left to become a surgeon in the Union army. Following the war Dr. Stevens located in Princeton, Liberty township, and then in West Chester, Union township. Following the Civil war, Dr. Phelps located in Venice, but died suddenly in 1866. He was succeeded by Dr. Morris, who had a wide reputation as an operator in surgical cases. He sold his practice in 1871 to Dr. Joseph Iutzi, who remained in Venice until 1878, when he removed to Richmond, Indiana, remaining there until his death in 1902. In 1871, Dr. S. K. Hamer, who had also been an army surgeon, located in Venice and built up a large practice especially in the vicinity of Shandon. However, in 1880 he went to Denver, Colorado, to enter the real estate business. Doctors C. E. Hoover. and M. O. ButterfIeld both located in Venice in 1882 and soon enjoyed large practices. Dr. Hoover died in April, 1893, while Dr. Butter field died in May, 1904. Later Dr. O. J. Smith located in Venice, while in more recent years Doctors (page 453) J. C. Craig and John F. Bausch became the practicing physicians of the village. Dr. O. J. Smith is the present practicing physician of the village.\n\nDr. Ellis was the first physician to locate in Jacksonburg.

Dr. Evans had quite a number of students, including Lewis Evans, Johnson I. Phares, John C. Fall, John P. Haggott and Pliny M. Crume. Dr. Evans removed to Franklin in 1837 and then in 1839 took up his residence in Hamilton, where he died in 1848. Of those who studied medicine under Dr. Evans, Dr. Lewis Evans located in Middletown, then in Indiana, and finally in 1849 went to California, where he died in 1878. Dr. Pliny M.

Dr. John Corson was located in Jacksonburg in 1850, remaining until 1863, when he located in Middletown. Dr. W. A. McCully, who became associated with Dr. Corson in 1862, became an army surgeon and at the close of the Civil war located in Trenton. Dr. J. B. Owsley was the successor of Dr. Corson and continued in practice until his death.\n\nThe pioneer physician of Middletown was Dr. Carlton Waldo, who located there just after the War of 1812, remaining until his death in 1831. In this year Dr. Andrew Campbell located in Middletown, having studied medicine under Dr. Otho Evans in Franklin. Dr. Campbell remained in Middletown until 1848, when he located in Hamilton, where he died in 1851. Dr. Campbell was the father of the Hon. James E. Campbell, the former governor of Ohio.

Bundy, Thomas Reed, S. R. Evans, George Lummis, George Evans, Byran Sharkey, S. L. Stewart, and A. Wannewich have practiced in Middletown.\n\n(page 454) Dr. Joshua Stevens was one of the earlier practitioners of Butler county, locating at Monroe in 1820, where he remained until 1847, when he removed to Lebanon. At Bethany Dr. James McCready located in 1859, continuing there until the outbreak of the Civil war, when he entered the army as an assistant surgeon. In 1864 Dr. McCready died in Oxford. His son, Dr. J. L. McCready, graduated from Miami university and later took up the practice of medicine in Cincinnati.\n\nOxford's first practicing physician was Dr. James R.

McHenry, who, in 1909, also removed to Hamilton. At present Dr. J. B. Grothaus is practicing in Somerville.\n\nButler county's first medical society was formed at a meeting held in Hamilton, January 1, 1836. The first officers of this organization were Dr. Dan Millikin, President; Dr. J. Fithian, vice-president; Dr. G. W. Riddell, secretary. A reorganization of the society took place December 26, 1848, at a meeting held in the office of Dr. Cyrus Falconer. It was then given the name of the Hamilton Medical society. At a meeting of this society, February 17, 1849, the code of ethics of the National Medical association was adopted, together with a fee-charge as prepared by Doctors Falconer, Rigdon and Millikin. Dr. L. Rigdon was then president of the organization. Beginning with October 3, 1849, it was decided to hold quarterly meetings of the society, while at the annual meeting held in January, 1850, Dr. L. Rigdon was elected president ; Dr. George Wyman, vice-president ; and Dr. William Huber, secretary. In 1850 Doctors Falconer and Millikin were the delegates of the society to the meeting of the National Medical association. On January 1, 1851, Dr. Rigdon was again elected president, with Dr. Scobey, vice-president., Doctors Huber, Wyman and Millikin were then appointed to draft a petition to the legislature of Ohio, asking for the erection of two additional asylums for the insane, one of which (page 457) should be located at Hamilton. Doctors Scobey, Huber and Rigdon were named a committee to investigate the influence of the dams in the Great Miami river on the health of Hamilton and Rossville.\n\nIn July, 1853, the society adopted a constitution and changed its name to the Butler County Medical society, a name it still holds. In 1865 Dr. Laomi Rigdon, who had been president since 1848, passed away, and Dr. J. A. Coons was elected president, which office he held until 1867, when he was succeeded by Dr. Cyrus H. Falconer. It was in July, 1867, that an invitation was accepted to meet with the Union Medical society in Oxford. This society consisted of the medical organizations of Preble county, Ohio, and Fayette and Union counties, Indiana. This meeting proved such a success that these district meetings have been held twice a year ever since.\n\nIn 1868, the Butler County Medical society had some trouble with the Ohio Medical society and withdrew its affiliation because of \"gross incivility shown in defiance of its own rules and all courtesy.\" The state society ultimately made proper amends and the former amicable relations between the two organizations were renewed. It was in 1876 that the meetings of the society were changed from quarterly to monthly affairs. In 1894 it was decided to make the meetings evening instead of afternoon affairs, to be held on the first Wednesday of each month ; but this was found impracticable and at the annual meeting in 1896 it was decided to meet at 3 p. m. on the last Wednesday of each month. Except for a short period in 1898, when quarterly meetings were held, this rule of monthly meetings still remains in force, and the society meets on the third Wednesday afternoon of each month in the auditorium of the Hamilton Y. M. C. A.\n\nA reorganization of the Butler County Medical society took place in 1902 to conform to the provisions of the American and Ohio State Medical societies. Under the rules then adopted, any legally qualified physician of any school of medicine whatsoever, residing in Butler county, could become a member of the society. The society has seen but few changes since that time and it is now representative of the medical profession in Butler county, holding its meetings regularly and deriving much good for its members from its organization.\n\nThe present membership of the society is as follows :\n\nHamilton : Frank M. Barden, Malcolm Bronson, Walter Brown, H. L. Burdsell, A. C. Carney, Edward Cook, J. B. Cowen, George M. Cummins, Francis M. Fitton, Merle Flenner, John Francis, Louis H.

Fitton, Hamilton, secretary and treasurer ; Di. H. H. Moore, Oxford, first vice-president ; Dr. T. A. Dickey, Middletown, second vice-president ; and Dr. Pyrle M. Sater, Hamilton, third vice-president.\n\nIncorporated Towns of ButlerCounty\n\nBesides the cities of Hamilton and Middletown, which have been extensively dealt with elsewhere in this context, there are seven incorporated towns in Butler county.\n\nCollege Corner, Oxford township, situated in one of the most fertile agricultural regions in the United States, has always been an important trading center from the first years of its foundation. The village was platted by Gideon T. Howe on May 5, 1837, and as originally laid out was entirely within the confines of Butler county. However, the natural growth and development of the town have gradually extended its limits into Preble county, Ohio, and Union county, Indiana. These later additions to the town have made necessary a dual government, the town being incorporated in both-Indiana and Ohio, and to meet the requirements of the laws of incorporation, two municipal governments are maintained.\n\nSome of the early settlers in the village were Jacob Bake, David Bonner, James Huston, Samuel Huston, Samuel McDill, Tobias Miller, John Patterson, and Peter Ridenour, and although the town was not officially platted until 1837, there was a considerable settlement existent many years earlier. Thus in 1811 appeared the first building-a log hemp mill, and this was soon followed by the first store which was operated by Thomas Forbes. in 1835, Ambrose L. Burnside lived in the village working at the trade of tailoring-the same man who later became. famous as a general in the Civil war, governor of Rhode Island, and United States senator from that state. In the earlier years of the town, separate school systems were maintained, but this being found impracticable, a fine high school building was erected several years ago, part of which is in each state, and this school is under the control of a joint committee representing both school boards, the teachers of which schools hold licenses in both states. The support of the school is contributed to equally by both corporations, and the unification plan has been found to be highly successful. College Corner has establishments of almost every representative business, including a marble works, and has a population of 379 in the Ohio corporation only. The matter of transportation is adequately taken care of by the C. I. & W. railroad, which also brings many visitors to the famous Tallewanda Mineral Springs near the town.\n\n(page 459) Jacksonburg, the oldest town in Wayne township, and near the highest ground in that township, is an important trade center west of the Miami river in Butler county. The town's first settlers were John Baird, John Craig, Benjamin Van Cleve, and Henry Weaver, by whom the town was laid out on February 16, 1816. John Baird built the first tavern, and the town soon attained the high water mark in its prosperity. It was on the main highway from Cincinnati to Preble and Darke counties, and in 1824 as many as fifty teams were put up in the town in a single night. But the building of railroads which did not enter the town, and the construction of a bridge across the Miami river at Middletown, started the decline of Jacksonburg, until now it is the smallest incorporated town in the state, having a population, according to the Thirteenth United States Census, of 55, but in spite of its lack of size, Jacksonburg has a complete municipal government under the village plan. Monroe, Lemon township, early became an important trade center in that section of Butler county. The country around the present site of the village was settled as early as 1800, and in 1817 Nathan Sackett and John H. Piatt platted the town of Monroe. Some of the early settlers, besides the two men who laid out the town, were John Baker and John P. Williamson. Monroe was a promising and thriving community before the days of the railroads, but, as was the case in Jacksonburg, the advent of steam transportation and the overlooking of Monroe, inhibited the. further prosperity of the town. In the early days it was one of the favorite stopping places on the stage route between Cincinnati and Dayton, and great hopes were then maintained for the future greatness of the village, but as it is now, Monroe is a pretty, peaceful country village with a population of 255.\n\nOxford, Oxford township, with a population of 2,017, is the third largest incorporated town in Butler county. The town was laid out by direction of the Ohio legislature. According to the law passed February 6, 1810, the board of trustees of Miami university met at Hamilton on the first Monday in March, 1810, and appointed a committee as follows : Thomas Irwin, William Ludlow, John Ceily, Ogden Ross and Joseph van Horne. This committee was to select a suitable tract one mile square on which to lay out the town of Oxford, and on March 29, 1810, proceeded to Miami county and chose S.E. quarter section 22, S.W. quarter section 23, N.W. quarter section 26, and N.E. quarter section 27. James Heat on platted\n\nthe first portion of the town consisting of one hundred twenty-eight inlots, and on the south side of \"the inlots, forty outlots, in the eastern part of the town was laid off sixty-six acres designated as University square. Lots were disposed of in a public sale in Hamilton by trustees, the first sale being conducted on May 22 and 23, 1810, when odd numbered lots already laid out were sold. Among the first settlers were Seth Bates, Ethan S. Weston, Thomas Craven, Robert Morris, George Davis, William Ludlow, John C. Irwin, and many others. The first house was erected by Samuel McCullough on Lot No. 1. The first bank in Oxford made its appearance in 1869 and was known as the Citizens bank, and this was followed the next year by the Oxford bank. Oxford has (page 460) had a newspaper since 1854, the first one being the Oxford Citizen. The first school erected was built on the university campus in 1811.\n\nThe town of Oxford was incorporated February 23, 1830, and was governed by a president and a trustee until 1855, when the first mayor, Peter Sutton, was elected.\n\nSeven Mile, Wayne township, was laid out in 1841 on land owned by Samuel Brand, who was also the proprietor of a mill and a distillery. The first lot was purchased by F. B. Landis, and the sale of lots continued until all those originally platted had been disposed of, and it became necessary, in 1851, to lay out additions to the town. Seven Mile was on the turnpike leading from Eaton to Hamilton, and great hopes as to the future of the town were entertained. The growth of the town was sufficient in its early years to induce a stock company to establish an academy there in 1858, of which Mr. 1. N. Hughes was the first principal. After a life of eight years the building and grounds were sold to the Seven Mile special school district for $3,500. One more attempt to conduct a private school was made in the year 1870 by Prof. B. Starr, the last principal of the above academy, who founded and for several years conducted a select school for boys. Seven Mile was incorporated in 1875, and is now a prosperous trading center in that part of the county, boasting a hotel and several business establishments, and having a population of 340.\n\nSomerville, a flourishing little town in Milford township, was platted in 1831 by Jacob F. Rowe. The first merchants to establish themselves in business here were John and Marsh Williams, and so rapid was the initial development of the town that in 1832, the first year after its platting, it was incorporated under the state law with Thomas Martin the first mayor. Its growth has not been rapid, and yet it is now a business center of some importance, and has a population of 349.\n\nTrenton, the largest village in Madison township, has had an interesting history. In 1800 Michael Pearce and Stephen Gard, both natives of New Jersey, led a number of pioneer settlers to the Miami country, and selected the present site of Trenton as an excellent place to end their wanderings and settle down. In 1815 the village was platted and given the name of Bloomfield in honor of Governor Bloomfield of New Jersey, but when, in 1831, a postoffice was established in the town, it was discovered that there was another town in Ohio already bearing the name of Bloomfield, and the village was, therefore, given the name of Trenton. The first tavern in the town was conducted by John Smith, and the first storekeepers were Squire Littell and Stephen Gard. Trenton was incorporated in 1898, and since the construction of the Cincinnati, Dayton & Toledo Traction road the growth of the town has been rapid, until now it has a population of 564."
