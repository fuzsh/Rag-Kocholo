        "text": "This page is part of the Warren County Ohio GenWeb project\n\nObituaries, Death Notices and Funeral Cards\n\nYou are visitor since 11 Jun 2003\n\nWarren County has been the home to many community type newspapers, including the Western Star which is the oldest continuously operating weekly newspaper in Ohio. The county is positioned between Cincinnati (Hamilton Co.) to the south and Dayton (Montgomery Co.) to the north. Many obits for Warren Countians can be found in the large daily newspapers serving those areas. The same is true with Middletown (Butler Co.) to the west and to some extant with Wilmington (Clinton Co.) to the east.\n\nObituary Resources\n\nThe Warren County Genealogical Society has online indexes for over 57,000 Warren County obituaries dating dating back to 1810. Additions are made to the collection on a regular basis with copies of the obituaries cataloged in binders, by year, at their resource library. They will also provide copies by mail for $1 each [minimum order $5] Click here for Ordering Details\n\nThe Warren County Historical Society has a large card file which includes numerous references to obituaries in various Warren County Newspapers. Their surname files typically contain copies of many obituaries.\n\nWarren County Obituary Transcriptions posted in the Ohio Obituaries Section of the USGenWeb Archives\n\nThe Ohio Obituary Index provided by the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center in Fremont, Ohio [over 1,000,000 obituaries as of 10 Apr 2007]\n\nThe Dayton Daily News has full text versions of current obituaries available on line at Dayton Daily News Obituaries\n\nThe Dayton and Montgomery County Public Library has an online Newspaper & Obituary Index from 1985 to the present.\n\nThe Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County has an on-line index to local newspaper articles called NEWSDEX . A January, 2006 article by Patricia Van Skaik indicates that the index provides comprehensive coverage of death notices from the 1980s forward and that the library has begun entering death notices from 1900 and working forward. She writes,\n\n\"From the library's home page, /http://www.cincinnatilibrary.org/http://www.cincinnatilibrary.org/, click on \"Research and Homework\" and then click on \"Newsdex.\" The \"Brose\" function in the box on the right side of the Newsdex screen is the most effective way to search for death notices. Enter the surname, followed by a space and the first name.\"\n\nRecent Obituaries from the Western Star\n\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer and Cincinnati Post have an online Obituary Search Engine for access to full text death notices and memorials published in all editions of The Cincinnati Enquirer and The Cincinnati Post since October 2000.\n\nOther full text on-line obituaries can be found at the Middletown Journal, Anderson Funeral Homes, Edgington Funeral Homes, Tufts Schildmeyer Funeral Home, Wilson Schramm Spaulding Funeral Home, Stine Kilburn Funeral Home, Smith & Son Funeral Homes. If you know of any others, please let me know.\n\nPLEASE HELP!If you have a transcription and/or image of an death notice, obituary, funeral card or similar item pertaining to someone connected to Warren County that you would like to share, please email them to Arne H Trelvik. They will be added to the Warren County OHGenWeb site and to the obituary collection at the Warren County Genealogical Society.
