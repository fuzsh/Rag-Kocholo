        "text": "Hubbard M. Abbott (1839-1929) served in the 37th Regiment, Massachusetts Infantry. Originally from Andover, MA, he moved to Northampton and married Harriet R. Parsons of Northampton. He lived nearby the library at 42 West St., became Register of Probate and was deeply involved in the local G.A.R. chapter Post 86. As his Personal War Sketch shows, he was at numerous significant battles throughout the war including Fredericksburg, Marye’s Heights, Franklin’s Crossing, Gettysburg, Rappahannock Station, Mine Run, the Bloody Angle, Spotsylvania Court House, Cold Harbor, Petersburg, Sailors Creek and at the surrender of General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House. After enlisting as a Private, he rose through the ranks during the war and was promoted to full Captain shortly before being mustered out at the close of hostilities. His battlefield diaries from 1863 and 1865 are part of the library’s Civil War and Grand Army of the Republic collection. Abbott is notable, not only because his diaries which give a great day by day view of the life of the 37th in 1863 and 1865, but also because he is at least partially responsible for the library receiving this collection. After serving as a quartermaster and adjutant part of his time in the war, he went on to become register of probate for Hampshire County, and was involved in library affairs and helped steer documents which had been held by the local G.A.R. posts into the library’s collection.\n\nText from Hubbard M.
