        "text": "BAKER, BENJAMIN T. (1816-1890). Sergeant, 1st New York Engineers, Company H; quartermaster, United States Navy. A New York City native, Baker enlisted as a corporal on January 22, 1862, and mustered into the 1st New York Engineers. He was promoted to sergeant on April 30, 1862, and mustered out at Folly Island, South Carolina, on July 3, 1863, citing paralysis of the legs and other disabilities. According to his affidavit of April 17, 1888, in which he requested an increase in his $24 a month pension (certificate 4,091), he re-enlisted in June 1864 as a quartermaster in the United States Navy and served on the torpedo boat Spuyten Duyvil. That vessel was in Norfolk, Virginia, in December 1864, and was part of the campaign to secure Richmond, Virginia. He swore that he lived aboard that vessel for five months during the winter of 1864-1865 without a berth to sleep on. Water was always dripping on the deck making it impossible to get a foothold on the deck. He wrote, “…Our clothing was constantly saturated with water, and we had no place to go in order to change, as everything we had was below and wet before we put it on. We took our meals on the Onondaga, a double-turreted monitor which lay about fifty yards from us; we had no further privileges on the monitor. Our lives at this time were in great peril and we suffered more than words can describe.” Baker went on to say that he contracted bronchitis, suffered for two months, had no resting place other than the wet sandbags or dripping wet torpedo box below, and after spending two additional months in a hospital, was discharged. Although he was not expected to survive the journey to New York, he did so, with chronic bronchitis, was unable to work, and was dependent upon his daughter, a widow.\n\nHis widowed daughter, Wihelmina Saville, wrote that his disabling condition stemmed from government neglect to provide proper accommodations on the Spuyten Duyvil, under the command of Captain John Lay. Her father had frequent coughing bouts, lung hemorrhages, was frail like a skeleton, and needed to be revived with stimulants very often. She implored that his service in both the Army and Navy deserved special consideration. In addition, she was responsible for the care of both parents and an invalid sister. His pension record indicates service on the USS Kensington, USS Onondaga, and USS North Carolina but the details related to that service are unknown. He last lived at 920 14th Street NW in Washington, D.C.

Section 200, lot 26111.\n\nBANNERMAN, FRANCIS (1851-1918). Weapons dealer. Born in Dundee, Scotland, he was brought to Brooklyn by his parents at the age of three. His father joined the Union Navy at the outbreak of the Civil War, but was soon injured and discharged. Francis and his father then went into business buying rope scraps for resale to paper manufacturers.\n\nWhen the Civil War ended, the Bannermans began to buy surplus Union arms to resell as scrap metal. They also modified some of these guns for resale. By 1884, he was in his own business, selling arms by mail order from a handwritten sheet. In 1888, he issued his first printed catalog, offering small arms, cannon, and other equipment. These catalogs, which his firm would issue until 1965, were known as “the Bibles of the gun collector.” The New York City Directories for 1895-1896, 1896-1897 and 1897-1899 list him as dealing in military goods; as of 1897 his business was at 579 Broadway. His greatest purchase was the bulk of the guns, ammunition, and equipment seized by United States forces in Cuba during the Spanish-American War. This comprised tons of equipment, including 30 million rounds of ammunition. At about the same time, he purchased 371,000 new United States uniforms, and Springfield rifles recovered from the sunken USS Maine.\n\nIn 1900, Bannerman purchased Polopel Island in the Hudson River four miles south of West Point, renamed it Bannerman’s Island, and built his arsenal and a five-story castle there. As per an article in the Philadelphia Inquirer on October 6, 1946. Bannerman had purchased from the government 90% of the weapons from the Spanish-American War and needed a place to store them; Polopel Island fit his needs because it was isolated and convenient. In its earliest days, that island was used by Native Americans. It was there that he presided over 40 employees and the world’s largest private arsenal. He opened his store at 501 Broadway in New York City in 1905. It was a collector’s mecca for the next fifty years. Bannerman believed that he could earn more by selling the old materièl to collectors rather than by selling the metal for its scrap value. During World War I, he donated substantial amounts of military equipment to England, including the outfitting of 1,000 Scotch National Guardsman. He also sent converted naval guns to General John Pershing in France. It was believed that his overwork in connection with his gift of 50,000 garments to Belgium led to his death.\n\nArticles in the New York Sun and Poughkeepsie Daily Eagle on December 30, 1918, noted that the settlement of Bannerman’s estate was filed in Probate Court in Poughkeepsie, New York; his estate was valued at $200,000 (the equivalent of $3.4 million in 2020 money). Originally, his estate was divided equally among his four children. However, he amended that will (drawn in Brooklyn on March 11, 1915) on a handwritten note, to provide that his sons, David and Francis (Frank), who joined his business and helped build it, would each receive two-fifths interest in his military business and his other son, Walter, would receive one-fifth; his daughter isn’t mentioned as receiving interest in the business. The estate consisted only of personal property; Ellen Bannerman, his wife, and his son David were the executors.\n\nHis sons, Frank and David, continued the family business into the 1960s. The aforementioned article in the Philadelphia Inquirer, written after Frank Bannerman’s death in 1946, noted that the Broadway store supplied weapons for military use during World War II; this was a departure from the business model after World War I which was mostly sales of antiquities. During World War II, sabers were supplied to the Fort Riley cavalry school and gun slings were sent to army units; all usable rifles, revolvers and shotguns went to the national defense. The Bannerman’s store appealed to those of all social strata. It sold authentic trimmings to Henry Ford for his restoration at Greenfield Village and sold King Farouk of Egypt a naval collection of shot and shell.

First lieutenant, United States Marines. Edward was born in Titusville, Pennsylvania, the fifth child of Edmund Sr. and Lydia née Peck; the couple had ten children, five boys and five girls. Edmund’s father was an eminent physician and lecturer whose maternal grandfather and guardian disinherited him at age eighteen because he chose medicine, not farming, as a career, unlike the family’s previous five generations. Edmund Jr’s obituary notes that he was educated in Tarrytown, New York.\n\nAs per an online biographical sketch from the Banning papers at the Indiana Historical Society, Banning Jr. enlisted in the Marine Corps as a private in 1861 and rose to lieutenant. The Lakeland Evening Telegraph published an interview on February 6, 1913, with Dr. Banning, referring to him as an old solder, which confirms his Civil War service. In that article, Banning spoke of his relationship with General Daniel Sickles, stating that he fought in his brigade and knew him after the war.

The aforementioned article in the Lakeland Evening Telegraph, reprinted from the Times-Union, on February 6, 1913, came after Sickles had been removed from the New York Monuments Commission upon discovery that $27,000 was embezzled. Banning told the interviewer that he did not believe Sickles would have engaged in that behavior. Banning said in part:\n\nI knew General Sickles well in the early days before the war. I knew him afterward, when he commanded the Excelsior Brigade, I have known his since the war, and am confident that it would be as impossible for him to do a criminal act as it would have been to the Father of Our Country. He was a brave man, he was a just man, and I shall never forget, after a fight when a large number of Confederates had been captured, his words, “Treat the boys right, they feel that they are fighting a just cause just as much as we are.\n\nBefore settling in Dayton, he was an officer at Hering Medical College in Chicago for ten years. As per his obituary in the Dayton Herald, Dr. Banning practiced medicine there for the last five years of his life. In an advertisement that he ran in the Dayton, Ohio Daily News on May 2, 1920, Banning noted that “for over 45 years” he had specialized in study of the spine and “the development of a spinal correctional system.” He last lived at 836 Neal Avenue in Dayton and died after an extended illness.
