        "text": "Introduction\n\nTerm low birth weight (TLBW) is a measure of fetal growth restriction that has been associated with perinatal and child morbidity and mortality (1) as well as adult health effects (2). Fetal growth restriction is caused by a multifactorial process. In spite of a number of well-established risk factors (3–5), factors underlying persistently observed ethnic/racial disparities in the prevalence of fetal growth restriction are poorly understood (6–9). Prenatal occupational exposures have the potential to adversely affect fetal growth, and some may be more frequent in jobs held by minorities such as immigrant Latinas in the US (10, 11).\n\nAlthough a number of studies have addressed maternal occupational exposure and pregnancy outcomes, only a handful of studies focussed on fetal growth in Europe (12–15) and the US (10, 16, 17); these were based on mainly non-Latina white populations. Studies in Sweden and Connecticut using birth and occupational registry data reported higher odds ratios for small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and TLBW births, respectively, for packers/dispatchers, warehouse and beverage manufacturing workers (14), and in food preparation and service, personal care and sales jobs (18). One important limitation of these registry-based studies is the lack of information whether or not and for how long women worked in the registered occupations during pregnancy. A survey conducted in North Carolina examined a range of occupations and reported food handling and electrical equipment work as being associated with SGA (17).\n\nThe focus of some earlier studies has been on certain attributes of work used as proxies for maternal exposures. A Danish cohort study reported no association between psychological job strain and SGA (13). A US registry based study similarly found no association with jobs classified as “high demand/low control” (16), while another US study with a more diverse population found low job status to be related to higher odds ratios for SGA (10). No elevated risks for SGA birth were observed among North Carolina women exposed to physically demanding and night work (15). A recent systematic review found a small increase in summary risk estimates for SGA related to heavy physical activities and long work hours (12). Finally, studies considering single occupational groups showed elevated odds ratios for SGA for hairdressers (19), and nurses (20), but not for day care workers (21). In summary, research is still limited and equivocal about the contributions of work related exposures to fetal growth retardation, and studies almost exclusively reported on non-Latina populations. To our knowledge, no prior population based study has investigated fetal growth retardation at term and a variety of maternal occupations in a population with a high proportion of immigrant Latinas in the US.\n\nHere, we report on TLBW (<2,500 gram, ≥37 weeks gestation) and maternal occupations categorized according to the 2000 U.S. Census Occupational Category Codes (OCC) (22) in a population with a large proportion of Latinas including many first generation immigrants, nested within a birth cohort of 58,316 births in Los Angeles County, California.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this population based sample of births in Los Angeles in 2003, the odds ratios for TLBW were strongly increased for mothers employed in Transportation and Moving Operations, Food Preparation and Serving, and Production Occupations. Notably, the large majority of women working during pregnancy in these job categories were first-generation immigrant Latinas, suggesting that this group is primarily affected by the adverse conditions encountered in these occupations during pregnancy.\n\nThe strong effect of working in “Transportation and Moving Operations” during pregnancy on TLWB we observed, may in part be explained by exposure to traffic related air pollutants - around a third of the women in this category were exposed to air pollution as bus drivers or parking garage attendants. A Danish study reported elevated levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-exposure, biomarkers of traffic exhaust, in bus drivers (24). Other women in our study with this occupation reported working as packers or in shipment, jobs for which extended standing and heavy lifting are typical exposures. We do not have information to determine whether these women were also exposed to vehicle exhaust, for example, in truck loading areas. Our findings are in line with previous studies that reported reduced fetal growth related to traffic related air pollutants (25, 26) and long periods of standing in different occupations (27). In our study region, a 5% increase in the odds ratios for TLBW was found for each interquartile range increase in several correlated traffic related air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM) diameter 2.5μm from diesel and gasoline combustion (26). The women in our sample working in these jobs were (except for one African American, ) exclusively Latinas, with the majority being first-generation immigrant (75%), mainly from Mexico. One earlier US study based on registry data also reported elevated odds ratios for TLBW for material dispatching jobs; but did not report on ethnicity/race and nativity across job categories (18). A Swedish registry study, however, did not associate working as a driver with increased risk for SGA (14). Women working in such jobs in Los Angeles - known for its high traffic density and elevated levels of air pollution (23, 26) - may however be exposed to higher levels of combustion products than these workers in Sweden. Evidence is accumulating for effects of occupational air pollution exposure predominantly on respiratory (28) and cardio-vascular diseases (29), while data on fetal growth retardation in relation to maternal occupational air pollution exposure are still scarce. A possible mechanism to explain effects of prenatal air pollution exposure involves increases in inflammatory proteins in response to inhaled air pollutants (30) which may adversely influence the in utero environment and impair fetal growth (31).\n\nWorking in “Food Preparation and Service Occupations” strongly increased the odds ratios for TLBW. Most (72.9%) women holding these jobs again were immigrant Latinas, working as cooks, food preparer or waitresses in fast food restaurants and similar places. Elevated odds ratios for TLBW were also reported for working in food preparation jobs in the Connecticut registry study mentioned above (18), and for SGA birth in the North Carolina study (17). While again no associations were seen in Sweden (14), a Danish study in the National Birth Cohort found that working as kitchen assistant, waitress or butcher slightly increased the odds ratio for SGA birth (32). One explanation for the increased odds ratios we observed may be that women working in fast food type jobs eat poorer diets with higher level of saturated fats and less healthy foods (high vegetable, high unsaturated plant oils, higher micronutrients) which has been associated with restricted fetal growth (33, 34). Alternate explanations are higher exposures to disinfectants, cleaning products (35), or indoor air contaminants from cooking in restaurant kitchens that typically employ immigrant workers (36), or long periods of standing and heavy lifting (27). A combination of several of these exposures may contribute to the observed effects.\n\nWorking in “Production Occupations” in pregnancy also increased odd ratios for TLBW. Our finding is in line with those from the Connecticut and the Swedish registry studies, both also reporting increased odds ratios for TLBW (18) or SGA births in textile workers (14). Again, the distribution across jobs of ethnicity/race or nativity status was not reported in these studies. As with the other high risk occupations above, in our study, the majority (93%) of women holding these production jobs - mainly factory line work and jobs in the textile industry - were first-generation immigrant Latinas. Exposures here include chemicals from processing and dyeing of materials such as formaldehyde (37), organic dusts, musculosceletal stresses, and noise (38), all having the potential to impair fetal development (39, 40). To date, a very limited number of studies of pregnant women in these occupations considered fetal growth. Knowledge is scarce about the extent to which immigrant workers in the U.S. may be particularly affected by, or more likely to be exposed to adverse production type working conditions and exposures.\n\nWe also found an elevated odds ratio for “Sales Occupation” but the confidence interval was wide. In the report from Sweden, no increased risk for sales agents and SGA was found (14), however, sales agent job demands in Sweden may be different from those in our Los Angeles population, which included mainly working as cashiers. Long periods of standing is typical for cashiers in the U.S., an exposure that has been associated with impaired fetal growth (27). Additionally, a recent study suggested that cashiers have elevated concentrations of urinary bisphenol-A (41), an agent that has been shown to have detrimental effects on fetal growth (42).\n\nWe did not see an adverse effect related to average number of hours worked among all women, or among Latinas. There was some suggestion of an increase in risk with longer work hours among those still working towards the end of pregnancy (7–9.5 months), however, confidence intervals were wide. These findings are in line with previous reports, suggesting no (43) or slight increases in risks related to long work hours (12). This may suggest that the type of work may be more important than the number of hours worked in general.\n\nLimitations of our study relate to the lack of actual measurements of occupational exposure. However, using women’s reported job title/tasks and business/industry during pregnancy allowed us to apply the standardized U.S. census OCC scheme (22). Although there are limitations in the determination of specific exposures, our approach provides an integrated marker capturing complex “real world” exposure scenarios. Another limitation is the relatively low response to our survey mainly due to the difficulty locating women who had been randomly selected from birth records as described previously (23). Responders differed somewhat from non-responders and the original birth cohort with regard to some fetal growth related risk factors. Women who responded had higher education and a higher percentage was US-born (23). Thus, higher response to our survey by better-educated women may have resulted in a higher proportion of women with less exposure in their jobs thereby reducing the exposure gradient, thus reducing power to estimate effects in our sample. Confounding is unlikely to explain our findings since a large number of potential confounders for which we had detailed survey information were evaluated. We conducted a number of sensitivity analyses, including adding additional variables to the regression models, such as smoking or alcohol consumption in pregnancy, parity, partner support, or marital status, which did not change the findings appreciably. We used standard SAS imputation methods to account for missing data in key covariates, and additionally conducted complete case analysis resulting in similar results. Another limitation is the small number of women employed in some of the occupations during pregnancy limiting our ability to investigate certain subgroups.\n\nOur study was, to our knowledge, the first U.S. population based study of TLBW with detailed maternal interview information about working in pregnancy and a high proportion of Latinas including many immigrant women. Further strengths include the detailed information on a large number of potential confounders, and the population based design resulting in a wide spectrum of occupations."
