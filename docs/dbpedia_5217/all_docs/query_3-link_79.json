        "text": "The representation of religious figures in Islam has become particularly controversial in recent years. The creation of religious films has, therefore, turned into a highly sensitive undertaking. Iranian cinema is one of the very few in the Muslim world to have employed this new medium in imagining and narrating stories of revered religious figures. In this article I examine the complex socio-political context of Iran to study the relatively late emergence of the epic genre in Iranian cinema. I then study the recent creation and development of ‘Qur’anic Films’ within Iranian cinema with specific reference to Kingdom of Solomon (Mulk-i Sulayman-i Nabi, Shahriar Bahrani, 2010), which I argue is the first Qur’anic epic in Iranian cinema if not in the Muslim world. The article also draws from the Iranian television series Imam Ali (Davud Mirbaqeri, 1997) in examining the ways in which Iranian filmmakers negotiate the balance between religious authenticity and dramatic effectiveness.\n\nHollywood movies have revealed dramatic and varying status of Islam and Muslims, calling them as magical carpet to mummified leadership and ultimately global bastion of terrorism. Various researchers consider hollywood film industry as reflection to construct public opinion in the cenima industry and it creates crucial slots that rely on emotive and evacoative imagination adjustable to stereotype approach. Many other researchers belive that such stereotypical conception ags inst Arabs (Muslims) roles in US Movies later 9/11 attacks prove demiging depictions, notorious recognition of Arabic ethnicity and Islamic religion like harming ideology contrary to past perceptions. However majority of these researchers stress mistly on the movie narritive and could not get triumph or understanding or evaluating the audience or their reactions to it. Moreover, majority of researchers stress mere the Arabic identity at suitable time to analyse the representation of Islam in movies, neglecting other notions where, islam is being followed.\n\nThis article reviews the complex relationship between religion and film-viewing among the Moroccan diaspora in Antwerp (Belgium), an ethnically and linguistically diverse group that is largely Muslim. A media ethnographic study of film culture, including in-depth interviews, a group interview and elaborate fieldwork, indicates that film preferences and consumption vary greatly along socio-demographic and linguistic lines. One particular religious film, however, holds a cult status, Ar Risalah (The Message), a 1976 historical epic produced by Mustapha Akkad that deals with the life of the Prophet Muhammad. The film’s local distribution is discussed, as well as its reception among the Moroccan diaspora. By identifying three positions towards Islam, different modes of reception were found, ranging from a distant and objective to a transparent and subjective mode. It was found that the film supports inter-generational religious instruction, in the context of families and mosques. Moreover, a specific inspirational message is drawn from the film by those who are in search of a well-defined space for Islam in their own lives.\n\nThe article deals with two recent Iranian films, al-Masih (Teh Messiah) by Nader Talebzadeh and Maryam al-Muqaddasah (Holy Mary) by Shahriar Bahrani. Both movies are about religious characters shared by Islam and Christianity: Zechariah, Mary and Jesus. The article explores the way the filmmakers have made use of both Islamic and non-Islamic sources to tell their story, and it analyses the stylistic and narrative means they have employed. Are these films contributing to the mutual religious understanding of Christians and Muslims? If so, how? And if not, why not?\n\nIn 1976 The Message, the first feature film about Muhammad, had its premiere. It was a very special film because as a result of the restrictions imposed by some prominent Muslim legal scholars, the Prophet was not depicted, nor his wives nor his cousin Ali. After an analytical impression of the contents of the film, the article discusses the relationship between the image of Muhammad in The Message and the pictures of the Prophet delineated by Muslim tradition and modern biographies of him. It then considers some new declarations made by Muslim religious authorities in 2002 and 2004 about films dealing with the life of the Prophet. Finally attention is given to the consequences of the rules announced by Muslim religious scholars concerning the image of the Prophet and to the acceptance of such an image by non-Muslims.\n\nBy means of two case studies, this article demonstrates how differently Islam is depicted in a Turkish film composed by a secular, intellectual director and in a film considered to promote an Islamic way of life. Yılmaz Güney’s art house film Umut/Hope (1970) depicts Islam as an integral part of Turkish reality. In the story of a poor carriage driver in South East Anatolia, who turns to treasure hunting guided by an imam, folk Islam is compared to a (secular) national lottery ticket: neither are the solution to existential problems. İsmail Güneş ’ film The İmam (2005) can be regarded as an example of the return of Islamic values into Turkish society, showing compatibility with modernity. However, whereas Umut is showing (folk) Islam as an existing reality in Turkish society of the 1970s, The İmam is teaching a moral lesson to Turkish society of the 2000s.\n\nThis study aims at disclosing the practices of Islam in Indonesia framed in the films by Nurman Hakim, among them are 3 Doa 3 Cinta (3 Prayers 3 Love) (2008), Khalifah (2011), and Bid'ah Cinta (2017). These three films portray the religious reality of Islamic society in post-reform Indonesia. The permeation of transnational Islamic practices, especially those adopted from the Middle East, is believed to have the potential to become a radical Islam and threaten the existence of a cultural Islam that promotes tolerance and appreciates the existence of Indonesian culture. Through the production of Islamic-themed films, Nurman Hakim believes that film is a representation of society and its era. Therefore, the film depicts socio-political, cultural, ideological, and religious circumstances in society. This is where a filmmaker has a very important role in producing the film. In his conscious and subconscious mind, a filmmaker will bring out all that has been absorbed from his surroundings. The audience can read the religious views of a filmmaker through the created film products. Using the perspectives of cultural studies and critical multiculturalism, this study perceives that the creation of Nurman Hakim films is not only to maintain inclusive cultural Islam but also to ward off the exclusive and scriptural radical Islam in understanding the holy verses of the Qur'an and hadith. Nurman Hakim's films also become the antithesis of mainstream Islamic-themed films that referred to the success of the Ayat-Ayat Cinta of Love movie which had adopted Middle Eastern Islamic identity.\n\nAs early as the 1930s, Egypt was the first Arab country to establish an animation production. While the majority of productions in the eight-decade history of the industry have been aimed at a national audience and conveyed through locally relevant messages, a growing number of films and series on Islamic topics targeting a transnational Muslim audience have emerged since the 1990s. This article examines the growth and characteristics of Egyptian Islamic animated cartoons and the Islamization of animation. It explores how the Egyptian state’s politics in the 1990s and its tightening affiliations with al-Azhar, the country’s highest religious authority, paved the way for such a production. Through a close study of the case of Qisas al-Qur’an (Stories from the Qur’an), the country’s most significant production to date in terms of budget, quality and distribution, this article provides an introduction to the characteristics of Egyptian Islamic animation."
