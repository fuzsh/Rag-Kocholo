        "text": "Jeri Jacquin\n\nComing to 4K Ultra HD, Bluray and Steelbook from writer/director Roland Emmerich and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is GODZILLA.\n\nOn an island in Polynesia, a military test has caused an iguana nest to be disturbed and, in the ocean, a Japanese vessel is attacked by something never seen before. Scientist Dr. Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) who studies wildlife and radiation has an unexpected visitor and goes to other countries to see for himself what this “Gojira” has done. Discovering a species never before been encountered, Nick thinks it’s just a new species.\n\nBut Gojira has other plans making its way to New York leaving destruction in every direction. Nick tries to help the military capture whatever it is that causing all the problems. Also trying to discover what is happening is Nick’s girlfriend Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo), a reporter who uncovers secrets the military has been hiding along with cameraman Victor (Hank Azaria). Preparing to put the information of air, boss Charles Caiman (Harry Shearer) steals the story and renames Gojira, Godzilla.\n\nIf things couldn’t get worse, Nick is taken by Philippe Roache (Jean Reno) who know what’s been happening but is trying to hide the French connection. Believing there was a nest somewhere in New York, Roache and Nick try to find it but a collision with a submarine sinks Godzilla but there is still the nest, oh yes, the nest.\n\nIn Madison Square Garden, the nursery becomes a shooting gallery for the military and Godzilla is not about to let that go without trying to settle the score. Man versus beast and someone has to win.\n\nBroderick as Tatopoulos was happy studying worms until he finds himself standing in a footprint. The more he sees the more he realizes that the new species that is carving out a path of destruction is more important than the worms in Russia. Broderick gives his character a brain but also adds a bit of hero element in trying to stop Gojira from doing what he is doing.\n\nPitillo as Audrey is a young woman trying to start a reporting carrier in New York but finds herself a researcher to a douchebag. Doing what she needs to do, Gojira offers her the opportunity to get in the action, literally, walking into a nest! Azaria as Victor is a bit of comic relief who realizes what they are doing and doesn’t seem to mind jumping in to the fray as long as his camera is capturing it all.\n\nReno as Roache has a reason to be worried about what Gojira is doing because of how he was created. Now, to keep his country safe from blame, he jumps in along with Tatopoulos to not only find what Gojira is hiding but make it all stop. Reno is always a stern looking serious character and, in this film, he has a chance to smirk from time to time and crack a joke (which are actually funny).\n\nOther cast include Kevin Dunn as Colonel Hicks, Michael Lerner as Mayor Ebert, Arabella Field as Lucy Palotti, Malcolm Danare as Dr. Mendel Craven, Glenn Morshower as Kyle Terrington, Chris Ellis as Gen. Hunter Anderson, Richard Gant as Admiral Phelps and Kurt Carley as Godzilla.\n\nSony Pictures Home Entertainment encompasses motion picture production for television, digital content and theater releases.

Coming to life in 1954 from director and writer Ishiro Honda. From then on, the world has been fascinated with this character to the tune of 33 film, video games, comic books and even television. He is literally the king of the monsters.\n\nOf course, being a king, he has arch-nemises’ of his very own including Rodan, Mothra and Anguirus. Remembering my brother and I up on Saturday mid-morning waiting to watch the black and white films and cheering on Godzilla (or Mothra sometimes). Then, for a few years, Godzilla faded a bit into the background of film only to be revived again bringing his atomic breath with him and angry roar.\n\nDirector Emmerich takes the story of Gojira/Godzilla and attempts to modernize it. From the cause of the monster’s birth to making his way to New York, Godzilla is once again back on the big screen wreaking havoc that fans all love. That means the family gets to gather up, shut off the lights and turn on the sound bar for an epic time with the king of the monsters!\n\nIn the end – he is taking over!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nSetting the stage for a journey like no other from writer/director Quarxx, Trangressive Productions and Film Seekers comes a melding of stories that creates PANDEMONIUM.\n\nNathan (Hugo Dillon) has woken up in the middle of the road on a very cold day. Seeing his car smashed, he realizes he has been in a car accident. Also in the accident is Daniel (Arben Barjraktaraj) who has realized long before Nathan that they are both dead. Nathan is furious at the thought but a very calm Daniel seems to understand their situation.\n\nThat’s when two doors appear, one seems lovely and plays music that Daniel can hear and the other door is a little less lovely. Both men begin to argue with one another as two who has committed the bigger sin but Nathan walks through the door. On the other side are stories such as Nina (Manon Maindivide), a young girl who is about to become the most heinous child.\n\nThen there is Chloe’s (Sidwell Weber) story that is horribly relatable as her mother Julia (Ophelia Kolb) tries to come to terms with the question all parents ask, ‘what did I miss?’. When Nathan can hand no more, he is confronted by a creature that makes it clear that he will become the epitome of suffering but for how long?\n\nDillon as Nathan is carrying a heavy secret about his life and it follows him into death and beyond. Experiencing the pain, agony and heinous acts that human beings commit on one another sends Nathan deeper into the underworld where he feels he doesn’t belong. He could never have imagined that one decision would bring such pain. Dillon does an excellent job of convincing us to feel for Nathan as he dragged down hard.\n\nBajraktaraj as Daniel is the calm of the two. Realizing what has happened, he tries to convince Nathan but the two end up comparing life mistakes. I kept waiting for Daniel to bring in something more and that tension alone is amazingly done by Bajraktaraj’s portrayal of this character. One thing this character taught me, never say anything about being ‘pushed’.\n\nMaindivide as Nina is a young girl who lives in a world all her own. In that world, people who do not follow along with her life vision don’t do well. Allowing her monster Tony in on what is happening at home brings in the worst horror I could have imagined. I don’t need a lot of blood and gore to convince me when evil is afoot. Maindivide’s performance rivals that of Patty McCormack’s portrayal of Rhoda in the 1956 film THE BAD SEED.\n\nKolb as Julia is the saddest story of them all because it is based on life and the issues facing young girls. Julia is a mother trying to raise her daughter to face things head on but has no idea what the young Chloe has been dealing with since moving into their new place. Mom is working and Chloe is going to school and sometimes life gets hectic and things are missed. Kolb goes into a dark place with her character and takes Chloe with her.\n\nOther cast include Jerome Paquatte as Livreur and Carl Laforet as Tony.\n\nFilm Seekers is a London-based agency working with new and established filmmakers. Films such as LOVE SARAH and THE WITCH IN THE WINDOW are festival favorites and last year’s hit JUNE AGAIN, was nominated for four Academy Awards in Australia. For more on Film Seekers please visit http://www.film-seekers.com.\n\nPANDEMONIUM, first of all, definetly has a Dante like quality to the story that Quarxx is trying to tell. The cast brilliantly takes us on this ride and never gives us a moment to think. It is all in our face and we, the viewer, are forced to challenge our own beliefs about this life and the next, what is a sin and what is unforgiveable in the eyes of the universe.\n\nThe cinematography is also quite amazing and horrifying in equal measure. This film is horror for the mind in a way that I prefer for the genre. It had my brain on fire while continuing to watch what was in front of me, almost as if I tried to jump ahead of the story and man, was I very, very wrong in a few key places. That being said, I loved being wrong because Quarxx took those twisty turns and probably smirked at everyone. At least I hope he did!\n\nIn the end – hell knows no forgiveness!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nScreamfest 2023 brings writer/director Victor Ginzburg, writer Viktor Pelevin and Kvadrat Film Company to the forefront of new ideas of old vampires with EMPIRE V.\n\nIn Moscow, the young Roman (Pavel Tabakov) is constantly being harassed by his mother and wants to get away from a life of unloading trucks for a living. Falling into the hands of vampire Brahma (Vladimir Epifantsev), Roman finds himself at its mercy. After being told that he is about to become someone powerful, the boy begins to change taking on Brahma’s powers, name and wealth.\n\nThis is where the mythology of the vampire changes. Roman, now Rama, learns that the vampires do not need to ‘bite’ their victims but instead are able to use the parasite inside them (The Tongue) to take a single drop of blood. That one drop gives them sight into a person’s memories. Because of this, the vampires are able to eat and drink as humans do. Rama learns quickly however that superhuman strength isn’t given when becoming a vampire, no, instead a bag of candy provides fighting ability.\n\nRama learns about Glamor and Discourse which is how the vampires live, a list of knowing as it were about what drives them and, more importantly, the elixir known as Bablos. Rama meets Hera (Taya Radchenko) who was also recently made a vampire and falls hard for her – which is against the rules. Mithra (rapper Miron Fedorov) believes Hera to be his property and warns Rama to keep his distance.\n\nAs information and explanations are constantly being thrown as him, Rama beings to suspect that he is not being told everything. That is confirmed when he meets the Great Bat who lets him know who not to trust and about Bablos. But Mithra has other plans and when the war between the two vampires breaks rules, they come together to settle the matter but what happens because of the duel is equally shocking!\n\nTabakov as Rama is a young man who finds himself in a world he could never have imagined. Starting out using his new found everything in ways that were amusing to many vampires, he has no choice but to fall into line quickly with the help of Hera and much to the anger of Mithra. Tabakov, once settled and in proper attire, allows his character to become a smooth talking and smart listening vampire realizing others are trying to use him but he has plans of his own. I enjoyed watching his character expand.\n\nRadchenko as Hera is smart, subtle and quickly understands what is at stake. She tries to guide Rama without Mithra knowing and sometimes it works but it eventually leads to the showdown. Hera has a plan of her own that doesn’t include anybody, which I loved, as she has decided what her place is to be in the mythical world of vampires. Radchenko gives it all and more and uses her character to show the depths and chameleon looks of this particular vampire.\n\nFedorov as Mithra is a vampire with an ego as big as the Big Bat! It is clear what he wants and he is trying every trick in the book to get it. Having someone like Roman/Rama take over is more than he can take. So, instead of being part of the fanged-tribe, he instead seems to pick battles and say what ever comes into his head believing he can not be stopped. Nothing wrong with being the smart-ass bad guy in a world filled with bad guys.\n\nOther cast includes: Igor Zhizhikin as Baldur, Fedor Bondarchuk as Professor Kaldavashkin, Maxim Droz as Jehova, Marina Zudina as Mother, Vera Alentova as Ishtar, Anna Chapman as Anna, Sofya Sinitsyna as Olya, Viktor Verzhbitzkiy as Baal, Andrey Smirnov as Oziris, Igor Gordin as Grigory, Bronislav Vinogrodskiy as Loki and Vladimir Dolinskiy as Enlil.\n\nEMPIRE V takes the mythology most Americans have grown up with and thrown it out the window. From the new ways of being a vampire to the origin story of these vampires to the way they feed and the elusive Bablos – this is a trip and a half. Buckle up because these bats are taking us all on a different vampiric ride.\n\nThe sets drip with excess of reds, golds, crystal glasses filled with whatever, stylish suits and expensive cars. The scenes are equally somber on the outside and bombed out looking but open the door and the lifestyles show through.\n\nIt is interesting the political life of these vampires and how they see the role of human beings to their survival. I grew up with vampires, celluloid speaking, but EMPIRE V throws that mythology on its head and twists it around to a world that is complex and blood-less. Coming in a tad under two hours, head scratching and thought processes are going to go on much longer than that! And no, I’m not telling you what bablos is.\n\nIn the end – blood, beauty and bablos!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nScreamfest is bringing many offerings and from writer/director Nicholas Tomnay comes a dish served differently with WHAT YOU WISH FOR.\n\nChef Ryan (Nick Stahl) is in financial trouble and decides to head to Latin America to fellow chef and friend Jack (Brian Groh). Having not seen each other for 12 years, Ryan is impressed with where Jack has landed being a chef to the uber rich. Ryan is also hiding from someone he owes a great deal of money too and is intending to hurt his family.\n\nEnjoy a few comforts in the multi-million-dollar house Jack is staying at, Ryan is a little envious of the life his friend is living. Interestingly enough, Jack does not seem as excited about his job as Ryan is. When Jack disappears one night, Ryan makes the split decision to take over his life in its entirety, money, identity and all. There is a catch.\n\nEnter Imogene (Tamsin Topolski), the head of the company Jack works for and she is expecting Jack/Ryan to be preparing a dinner for very special guests. Quickly, Jack/Ryan learns what is expected of him in the most horrible and heinous of ways. Realizing there is no way out, he begins to do what is asked of him.\n\nThe dinner starts out well until an unexpected visitor, a Detective Ruiz (Randy Basquez) is looking for his nephew. Imogene manages to keep her cool and even Ryan is managing to get the job done until he meets Det. Ruiz and discovers that the life his friend Jack was living has an underlying dark side making escape impossible.\n\nStahl as Ryan gives us the character of a man between a rock and a cash hard place. He is nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof while being a tad jealous of the life his friend has, especially when he sees Jack’s finances. It all seems like its too good to be real and, as the title suggests,\n\nShout out to David Tominaga as Akira because he seemed to be having fun during all the happenings and chaos. Not phased one bit by what is going on around him, he actually invites trouble and offers it dinner without a care in the world. He made my jaw drop and then I laughed so well-done sir!\n\nTopolski as Imogene is calm, cool, collected and a bit nerve wracking to watch as she goes from one potential disaster to another. Her character almost glides instead of walks through these scenes knowing just what to say and how to handle anyone that gets in the way. Okay, I just love this character and Topolski add her frightening grace and style as nothing seems to shake her.\n\nBasquez as Detective Ruiz is about to discover more than he had ever planned but, in the meantime, just sit right on up to the table and enjoy the most fabulous chef made dinner on the planet dude!\n\nOther cast include Juan Carlos Messier as Maurice, Ariel Sierra as Officer Gallo, Norma Nivia as Frankie, Megumi Hasebe as Li Na, Evan Sudarsky as Alvin, Greg Winter as Barry, Maria Gomez as Maria, Brian Acuna as Roberto, Maria Cuellar as the Grandmother, Raphael Philippon as Bjorn, and Penelope Mitchell as Alice.\n\nWHAT YOU WISH FOR is a frightening lesson in living beyond one’s means, running away, and the biggest of all evils – jealousy. The character of Ryan, step by step, gets into so much trouble with money that he thinks running away will save him. When he realizes it won’t, what normal people wouldn’t do, Ryan does! He wants to be shocked by the life his friend has been leading but it doesn’t stop him from taking what isn’t his.\n\nKeeping the story in a very tight quarters makes for fantastic tension with each event pushing the human envelope further and further. The viewer then is left to question, how far are all these people willing to go? When that question is answered, you might want to put the popcorn down!\n\nWriter/director Tomnay takes us on a delicious journey of human nature and then slams us with the harsh reality of what his created characters are capable of. The casting is excellent as each has their definitive role and watching them interact will either leave your horrified or delighted – perhaps a nice mixture of both is acceptable as well.\n\nIn the end – escape, forever!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nAt this years Screamfest, writer and director Olivia West Lloyd along with Last Rodeo Studios comes the story of unraveling SOMEWHERE QUIET.\n\nMeg (Jennifer Kim) is recovering from a horrendous kidnapping that left her with anxiety and fears. Husband Scott (Kentucker Audley) is doing his best to try and bring some solitude and support taking her to a family home that is quiet and soothing.\n\nEnjoying the quiet and time with Scott, that is all interrupted when his cousin Madeline (Marin Ireland) bursts onto the scene. Loud, boisterous and cutting with her words, Meg begins to feel that Scott is spending more time with Madeline and ignoring how it is affecting her. Lashing out in her own way, Meg’s behavior becomes slightly erratic which causes Scott to become unlike himself.\n\nAll Meg wants is quiet time with Scott to regather the life she once had, find answers to why it happened to her and remember who is responsible. In the way of it all is not knowing if what she sees and hears is real or a mix up in her mind. However, what is driving it all is more sinister than Meg could ever know!\n\nKim as Meg is brilliant as a woman who is trying to understand why she was kidnapped and how she is to find a normal life in the aftermath. Watching Kim take this character through every tragic emotion, this is a journey worth taking as the story goes from beginning to end. We are unwittingly invited on Meg’s journey of what is real and what are mixed up thoughts in her mind. Well done!\n\nAudley as Scott is a husband who just doesn’t know how to handle the emotional situation his wife is going through. Trying to be there for her, he consistently tries to help her think through the mix ups Meg is experiencing. Lighting up when his cousin Madeline enters the picture, it is his chance to get away from the troubles in his marriage. Audley also gives us a range of character that has us following along with his part of the story.\n\nIreland as Madeline comes into the picture and brings laughs, childhood stories and wants to help the couple. Scott is thrilled his cousin is coming around to bring a little fun but Meg sees her as I did – completely irritating and creepy. That being said, I was fascinated with the way she behaves and the sharpness of speech. So well done!\n\nOther cast include Paula Lord as the woman in the woods, and Michael Neeson as Joe.\n\nLast Rodeo Studios is a team of accomplished film producers, writers and entrepreneurs with collective film credits that have been featured in film festivals around the world. These include Sundance, Tribeca, SXSW, LAFF, SIFF, Telluride, DOCNYC and DIFF. These films have also been nominated for Golden Globes, BAFTA and Academy Awards. For more please visit www.lastrodeostudios.com.\n\nSOMEWHERE QUIET is a well-written and even more well-filmed thriller. This is my favorite genre of ‘horror’ films because is has more to do with our own fears than blood and gore. Writer/director Lloyd takes the very simple premise and consistently pokes from all sides never letting us once off the hook.\n\nThe combination of what is real and what might be imagined had me thinking I needed paper and pen to keep notes! I loved that so much because it challenged what I saw and what I thought I saw within the story and what is presented on film. Keeping the cast small and the sets simple is also another favorite of mine and it lends itself so much to allow the focus to be on Meg.\n\nSOMEWHERE QUIET is a treat and the cast is the one handing out the candy!\n\nIn the end – what is real?\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nComing to theatres from director Kim Bordon, co-director Robert Chandler, Blue Fox Entertainment and Shout! Factory comes a treat for the family with THE CANTERVILLE GHOST.\n\nComing from America, the Otis family has purchased Canterville Chase, a mansion that has a history of being haunted and causing residents to go a little crazy. Husband Hiram (David Harewood), wife Lucretia (Meera Syal), young boys Kent (Bennett Miller) and Louis (Jakey Schiff) are thrilled when they enter the mansion as Mrs. Umney (Imelda Staunton) opens the door. The only one not happy is daughter Virginia (Emily Carey) who wants nothing more than to go back across the pond.\n\nImmediately, the family wants to see Sir Simon de Canterville (Stephen Fry) and the twins run around the house calling him out. Virginia makes it clear she has no intention of being happy about any of it all and goes up to her room. It takes mere moments before Sir Simon tries to frighten Virginia out of his home. The problem is, she isn’t at all! Instead, she plays on him challenging that Sir Simon that he can’t chase out her family in two weeks!\n\nOn the grounds, Virginia meets the Duke of Cheshire (Freddie Highmore) and that makes Sir Simone furious as he has anger toward the family. It seems his beloved wife Eleanor came from the Cheshire family who blamed Sir Simon for her death. Now Virginia knows a big part of the story as to the reason Canterville Chase has a ghost!\n\nAs the days pass, Virginia and the Duke become closer and her parents decide to throw a party re-introducing society to Canterville Chase. The problem is that Sir Simon is still angry and decides that the dinner not go without his own unique brand of entertainment. When things don’t go as planned, the family is upset with their ghost but Virginia feels there is something more that Sir Simon isn’t saying.\n\nShe decides to take matters into her own hands and that’s when the truth finally comes out!\n\nCarey as Virginia is an American girl who wants to go home. She decides to use Sir Simon’s ghostly abilities to try and scare her family back to the United States. Instead, she finds herself on an adventure that has unexpected consequences. Carey truly gives voice to Virginia and it is fun, delightful and charming.\n\nFry as the voice of Sir Simon is hilarious most of the time (when he isn’t angry) and can not understand how the new occupants are not frightened to have a ghost in their house. Instead, they seem to be trying to have fun with the apparition, especially the twin boys. I have always loved Fry’s work and watching him take on the vocal role of Sir Simon is everything fun about the film.\n\nHighmore as the Duke of Cheshire is so sweet and a bit bumbly. He is immediately taken by the feisty and free Virginia. He knows that the ghost is in the house and even comes face to face with Sir Simon but nothing is going to keep him away from Virginia and happily joins in the adventure. When her life is in danger, the bumbly Duke of Cheshire finds it within himself to safe her from a fate – well, you get the point.\n\nLaurie as the Grim Reaper gets to have a bit of fun with this character. Hiding behind who he truly is and what he is up to, Laurie takes us on a story ride with what he wants and how he plans to get it!\n\nShout out to Schiff and Miller as the Otis boys because, to be honest, that is exactly how I would be at their age. Challenges of a haunted house – absolutely accepted. They have no fear of any ghosts and show just how unafraid they are and it made me laugh so much.\n\nOther cast includes Toby Jones as Reverend Chasuble, Miranda Hart as the Ghost Catcher, Giles New as the Colonel, Georgia Small as Majorie Fairfax, Keiron Self as Professor Borsakov, Bill Lobley as Lord Monroe, Elizabeth Sankey as Eleanor de Canterville, and Hugh Laurie as the Grim Reaper.\n\nSHOUT!

It has a fantastic story based on the writings of Oscar Wilde (and Stephen Fry actually played the role of the poet/playwright in the 1997 film WILDE). It is colorful, vibrant, action packed and has some very funny characters and moments.\n\nThis is the film that families can enjoy together because it is about a family and how they eventually come together. As nutty as some of the characters are, they are so much fun to watch as the story unfolds. Everyone can find something to love about the film and I can’t wait for everyone to see it.\n\nThe spooky season is here and if you are looking for a good time at the movies for the whole family then visit THE CANTERVILLE GHOST for a spooktacularly good time!\n\nIn the end – it is his house not yours!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nComing to Bluray and DVD from directors Johnny Strong, William Kaufman and Well Go USA comes the story of survival from WARHORSE ONE.\n\nDuring an ordered rescue in Afghanistan, Navy SEAL Master Chief Richard Mirko’s (Johnny Strong) helicopter is shot down and he is thrown clear. The only survivor, he is sent to the location where the civilians they were to pick up are located. Once there, he finds one survivor, the young Zoe Waters (Athena Durner).\n\nNot far away is the enemy and their goal is to capture the American and young girl and finish what they had started. Determined to not let them escape is leader Radam (Raj Kala) directing his men where to go to find them. Tarad (Siya Rostami) leads the chase and it is on completely.\n\nAttempting to get to the spot where the military could rescue them, Mirko and young Zoe begin to form a bond. Zoe quickly understands that those who are responsible are the same people that Mirko must save them both from. Mirko is straight forward with the young girl as to what they are up against and what they must do to make it to the top of the mountain.\n\nTheir fight for survival is on!\n\nStrong as Mirko immediately gives the character a strong military sense of what the mission is even after the crash. Even when survival becomes the mission, he is focused, straight forward and knows what must be done. Adding a young child to the mix could have gone wrong in the storytelling but Strong guides the story to its heart-pounding conclusion with more than a job well done.\n\nDurner as Zoe is a little girl who gives her character such range of emotion. She could easily have been just a kid carried around but no, Durner gives us a very young girl who has seen what she shouldn’t ever have had to. In that, she comes quickly to understand that Mirko is her protector and that means, once again, doing things that he tries to protect her from.\n\nKala as Radam is a man on his own mission and it is heinous and terrifying. It is hard to play the role of the villain and Kala doesn’t hide behind anything to give it his all. Rostami as Tarad follows Radam as the leader and is equally dedicated to the destruction of the Navy Seal.\n\nWell Go USA Entertainment is a theatrical and home entertainment company specializing in bringing the best Action, Genre and Independent films from around the world to North American markets.

Spila as Assistant Director Dave Mattis, Adam Dietrich as Mike, Jay Moses as Rev. Matthew Walters, Damian Turner as Petty Officer Darnell Reece, Nash Bland as Rahmi and Chris Calvert as Petty Officer Chris Martin.\n\nBonus Features include Director’s Commentary Featurette and Trailer.\n\nWARHORSE ONE is the first-time film for actor Johnny Strong as co-director and he has done an awesome job. The story is straight-forward and action packed but doesn’t forget the emotional side with a young girl who deserves as much protecting and anyone else. What I truly enjoyed is that Strong’s character Mirko stays focused and even though his emotions are being tested, it doesn’t change the mission. If anything, he remains focused and lets Zoe know what the rules of survival are.\n\nKeeping the location mainly out in the open, the chase is on and that is what keeps the story flowing. Of course, Mirko knows his job but that is made difficult when those trying to kill him are everywhere. I have always enjoyed films of this type that keep moving because only the directors know what is behind every rock, building and corner.\n\nThe film is well done with cinematography that covers the action and a cast that brings the story being told by Strong and Kaufman a strength without glorification and a finish to cheer for.\n\nIn the end – worth living for and worth dying for!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nComing to Bluray, DVD and Digital from writer/director Larry Yang and Well Go USA is the story of family and a horse that will RIDE ON.\n\nLao Luo (Jackie Chan) is a former stuntman who has been living a quiet life with his companion horse Red Hare. Missing his daughter after a divorce, Xiao Bao (Liu Haocun), she is about to come back into his life once again. Owing a lot of money, Lao Luo learns he may lose Red Hare to an auction. Not knowing where to turn, he seeks out daughter Bao for legal help since she is studying law.\n\nKeeping an emotional distance, she asks her boyfriend Naihua (Guo Qilin) if he would be able to help. After a street fight with Red Haire goes viral, movie makers want him and the horse for their action films. Bao becomes a bit of an ad litem agent for her father but finds herself becoming closer to him. Watching her father work, she becomes very worried about them both as the stunts seems to be more and more dangerous.\n\nAfter one fateful stunt, Bao learns more about her father and what he has been through during their time apart. She realizes what she thought about Lao was all wrong. At the hospital, Lao tells her that it is time for he and Red Hare to retire. The court case still looms about Red Hare’s fate and Bao is still trying to understand her feelings and her father.\n\nFamilies and stunts can be complicated.\n\nChan as Lao is definetly playing to his strength with his history as being a stuntman himself. That gives him an edge to playing this role with the added family storyline. He gets the chance to do stunts and show he’s still got it at his tender age of 69 and shows it to be flawless. Chan’s comedic timing is still wonderful and, in this film, even his emotional moments are tender and thoughtful.\n\nHaocun as daughter Bao has her own feelings toward father Lao feeling abandoned by him. There are big trust issues for Bao not understanding the circumstances that led to her father leaving or what happened to him during their time apart. Haocun is stubborn and at the same time protective of Red Hare and eventually her father. Haocun is charming and lovely to watch as her character navigates relationships.\n\nQilin as Naihua is watching the father-daughter-horse relationship unfold while also wanting to move forward marrying Bao. He truly does enjoy seeing this once detached family come together and wants to do anything to help. Qilin is so sweet as their character navigates it all.\n\nShout out to Wu Jing as Yuanjie who wants to help Lao offering him a chance to not only sort of relive his stuntman days but helps him out of his financial troubles. Jing is a bit crazy at times with his emotional outburst but he truly does show a good heart. Well done, Jing.\n\nAlso, a nod to the beautiful horse Red Hare! Playing opposite Jackie Chan, this horse makes it clear that being a legend doesn’t mean he can upstage this horse. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Red Hare and Chan work together.\n\nOther cast include Joey Yung as Yingzi, Yu Ailei as Xiamao, Yu Rongguang as He Xin, Andy On as Dami Ge, Xiaoshenyang as Li Yan and Shi Yanneng as Dawei.\n\nWell Go USA Entertainment is a theatrical and home entertainment company specializing in bringing the best Action, Genre and Independent films from around the world to North American markets.

Chan takes every chance to be hilarious, comedic, emotional and strong and that’s everything for this former stuntman. The added bonus of the horse Red Hare allows Chan to play opposite a ‘character’ that doesn’t have much to say but sure makes his feelings clear.\n\nThe martial arts look seamless (thanks to great choreography) and although there are not a lot of fight scenes, when they are on screen it is well done and not over played. RIDE ON comes in at one hundred and twenty-six minutes and the language can be adjusted if subtitles during a movie isn’t your thing.\n\nThe film is colorful, the story is impactful and plays a serious ode to stuntman including Jackie Chan. They are basically unsung heroes in many Asian films with Chan and crew making it clear at the end that they are dearly appreciated. Asian films are known for their grandeur and large casts, especially where martial arts are involved, and writer/director Yang makes sure the story never forgets who makes that possible.\n\nIn the end – it is time to get back on the horse!\n\nJeri Jacquin\n\nComing to streaming services such as Apple TV, Amazon, and Sling TV and also on VOD from writer/director Keith Boynton, Choice Films and Freestyle comes the story of the unexpected when looking for solace in THE WINTER HOUSE.\n\nEileen (Lili Taylor) has found the most remote place on a lake in New Hampshire to spend time alone. Happy for the solace, she spends time walking, reading and thinking – which can be dangerous for a writer. The days pass with some semblance of routine until one night there is a stranger in the kitchen. Stumbling around is Jesse (Francois Arnaud), intoxicated and also unsure of what is happening.\n\nAfter introductions, Eileen makes it clear that she is renting the house and that Jesse needs to find his way to his own home. Trying to sober him up, she decides to let him stay the night. After a few days of his company, a bit of irritation sets in feeling that her whole reason for being at the house feels intrusive.\n\nEven sending him away doesn’t last long but their conversations become more personal and deeper. Each has the chance to share what has happened to put them in the spot they are both in. Especially when a man named Paul (Hunter Emery) shows up at Eileen’s door demanding to see Jesse and now the whole truth in both their lives comes to a head and neither can run away any longer.\n\nTaylor as Eileen gives the performance clearly of a distraught woman who, after so many years, is no longer sure what she wants from this life. Taking time away has several purposes and none of them will move her forward. Not even the unexpected visitor seems to shock her in any way but instead Taylor’s Eileen accepts it all as it is and not what Jesse might want it to be. Taylor’s performance is deliberate, sadly sweet and filled with details as they come to light.\n\nArnaud as Jesse reacts the opposite of Eileen. Where she is quiet and deliberate, he is loud and emotional. He also has a trunk load of secrets that cannot stay hidden from anyone, no matter how much Jesse drinks. Trying to find a connection to something that is tangible, Arnaud’s portrayal of Jesse is that of a man who knows what the right thing is, but, as with all human beings with a past, fear can be ever controlling.\n\nEmery as the mysterious Paul is the brute tension to the story and he does it in a short scene. That keeps the guessing high wondering when this character is going to show up again.\n\nOther cast include Stephen C. Bradbury as the Shop Owner and Beth Fowler as Deborah.\n\nFreestyle Releasing specializes in releasing films theatrically and representing independent films. Releasing content through Freestyle Digital Media, their most successful film theatrically to date is the 2014 film GOD’S NOT DEAD.

Keeping the cast small is a favorite of mine because it allows us to quietly enter into the room and experience for ourselves the story’s we don’t tell each other. Eileen is a complex character in her own right trying to hide the bag of bricks she carries in solace. Jesse is less complex but still a man who has created his own path and now it’s time to clean it up.\n\nTaylor and Arnaud together are a powerhouse but in a subtle way. In fact, the entire film is subtle with nothing earth shattering or loud but instead, a deep quiet dive into the lives of two human beings who are looking for a connection that allows their existence to make sense. That is what makes the film relatable as well, two people with the same feelings in a shared space with only one thing separating them – secrets.\n\nIn the end – how far away is far enough?"
