        "text": "President Joe Biden is in Israel on an urgent mission to keep the Israel-Hamas war from spiraling into a broader regional conflict. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that limited humanitarian aid would be allowed into Gaza from Egypt following a request from Biden.\n\nThe president’s visit on Wednesday came after hundreds of people were reported killed in an explosion at a Gaza Strip hospital the night before. There were conflicting claims of who was responsible for the hospital blast. Officials in Gaza quickly blamed an Israeli airstrike. Israel denied it was involved and released a flurry of video, audio and other information that it said showed the blast was due to a missile misfire by Islamic Jihad, another militant group operating in Gaza. The Islamic Jihad dismissed that claim.\n\nWATCH: Families of Americans kidnapped by Hamas describe anguish and what they want Biden to do\n\nThe Associated Press has not independently verified any of the claims or evidence released by the parties.\n\nThe war that began Oct. 7 has become the deadliest of five Gaza wars for both sides. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that 3,478 Palestinians have been killed and more than 12,000 injured in the past 11 days.\n\nMore than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed, and at least 199 others, including children, were captured by Hamas and taken into Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nCurrently:\n\nBiden says the U.S. will provide $100 million in humanitarian assistance for Palestinians affected by conflict in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nDoctors in Gaza City performed surgery on floors, often without anesthesia, in a desperate bid to save wounded victims of a massive blast that killed civilians sheltering in a hospital.\n\nRage at the hospital carnage spread throughout the Middle East.\n\nThe leaders of Egypt and Jordan, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called off a planned summit with Biden.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council is scheduled to vote on a resolution about the fighting between Hamas and Israel, but negotiations on the wording are still underway.\n\nHere’s what’s happening in the latest Israel-Hamas war:\n\n7:30 p.m. EDT\n\nAirstrike kills 7 small children in Gaza home, residents and doctors say\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — Residents and doctors in this southern Gaza town said an airstrike slammed into a home, killing seven small children.\n\nThe news spread quickly on social media, as grisly images of dead and bloodied toddlers lined up side by side on a hospital stretcher stirred outrage in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nREAD MORE: U.S. vetoes UN resolution condemning all violence against civilians in Israel-Hamas war\n\nBandaged and caked in dust, the bodies were brought to the Gaza European Hospital in Khan Younis along with three other dead members of the Bakri family. Photographers swarmed the operation room as women covered their eyes and doctors wept.\n\n“This is a massacre,” hospital director Dr. Yousef Al-Akkad said, his voice choking with emotion. “Let the world see, these are just children.”\n\nLocal medics also confirmed that the children were killed in a strike and said the Bakri family was just one of many such cases Wednesday.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.\n\nLiverpool and Egypt star Salah urges leaders to prevent more bloodshed, get humanitarian aid to Gaza\n\nCAIRO — Egyptian soccer star Mohamed Salah, arguably the most celebrated Arab footballer, called on world leaders to “come together to prevent further slaughter of all innocent souls” and for the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza.\n\n“There has been too much violence and too much heartbreak and brutality,” the Liverpool striker said in a video that lasted a little under a minute. “The escalations in the recent weeks is unbearable to witness. All lives are sacred and must be protected. The massacres need to stop. Families are being torn apart.”\n\nAid to Gaza “must be allowed immediately,” he added. “The people there are in terrible conditions.”\n\nThey were Salah’s first comments on the Israel-Hamas war, after he was criticized by some Arab fans for his silence.\n\nOfficials said Wednesday that some aid will begin flowing into Gaza in the coming days.\n\nU.S. senators say after classified briefing that Israel not behind hospital blast\n\nWASHINGTON — Senators who attended a classified briefing with top defense, intelligence and other administration officials said they were briefed that Israel was not responsible for the hospital blast.\n\n“The intelligence community assesses that Israel is not to blame for the explosion of the hospital in Gaza,” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said as he left. “They believe it was an errant rocket from terrorists in Gaza.”\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said the intelligence is “definitive” that it was not an Israeli operation.\n\nIn a joint statement earlier in the day, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the panel, said they had reviewed intelligence and “feel confident that the explosion was the result of a failed rocket launch by militant terrorists and not the result of an Israeli airstrike.”\n\nUN officials warn over Gaza health system, risk of conflict expanding\n\nUNITED NATIONS – U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council that the deadly destruction of a hospital has heaped further pressure on Gaza’s crumbling health system, depriving the territory of a facility that cared for 45,000 patients every year.\n\nSpeaking in a video briefing from Qatar, Griffiths also said the Al Ahli hospital was previously struck on Oct. 14.\n\nHe also said the death toll in the 11 days since Hamas’ surprise attack inside Israel has already exceeded what was seen during seven weeks of Israeli-Hamas hostilities in 2014.\n\nMeanwhile the U.N. Mideast envoy warned that the risk of the conflict expanding is “very real and extremely dangerous.”\n\nTor Wennesland told the council that recent events “have served to reignite grievances and re-animate alliances across the region.”\n\nEarlier in the day at the U.N., the United States vetoed a resolution that would have condemned violence against civilians in the Israel-Hamas war and pushed for humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said President Joe Biden was in the region engaging in diplomacy and “We need to let that diplomacy play out.”\n\nBritish PM Rishi Sunak heads to Middle East in bid to contain conflict\n\nLONDON — British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is flying to Israel and nearby countries as part of diplomatic efforts to stop the crisis triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack from worsening.\n\nSunak’s office says he will meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog on Thursday. He will condemn Hamas’ “horrific act of terror” and express condolences for the “terrible loss of life” in both Israel and Gaza.\n\nREAD MORE: UK Prime Minister Sunak delays ban on new gas and diesel cars by 5 years in contentious climate shift\n\nHe’ll also visit “a number of other regional capitals,” Downing Street said, without providing details.\n\nThe British leader’s trip follows a visit to Israel on Wednesday by U.S. President Joe Biden.\n\nSunak said in a statement that Tuesday’s explosion at the al-Ahli hospital in Gaza “should be a watershed moment for leaders in the region and across the world to come together to avoid further dangerous escalation of conflict.”\n\nU.K. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly is also on a visit to the region that begins with talks in Egypt on Thursday. He is also due to visit Qatar and Turkey.\n\n5:12 p.m. EDT\n\nBiden says Egypt agrees to open Rafah crossing for Gaza aid\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday said Egypt’s president has agreed to open a border crossing into Gaza to allow in 20 trucks with humanitarian aid.\n\nBiden said he spoke with Egypt President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi after his visit to Israel, where leaders there agreed to allow the aid in. Biden was speaking to reporters on Air Force One during a refueling stop in Germany on his way back to the U.S. from Tel Aviv.\n\nIsrael sealed off the Gaza Strip, stopping all entry of food, water, medicine and fuel to its 2.3 million people following the Hamas attack on Oct. 7.\n\nWhite House officials said the aid would flow in the coming days. Biden said if Hamas confiscates the aid, “it will end.”\n\nSecurity forces arrest dozens, fire live rounds to disperse protests in the occupied West Bank\n\nJERUSALEM — Rights groups in the occupied West Bank say Palestinian security forces arrested dozens of people protesting the deadly explosion at al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza.\n\nThe protests late Tuesday devolved into skirmishes with Palestinian security forces, who fired tear gas, stun grenades and live fire to disperse stone-throwing demonstrators, wounding several.\n\nLawyers for Justice, a legal aid group, said Wednesday that some 50 Palestinians protesters were arrested overnight by Palestinian security forces in Ramallah.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent meanwhile reported that Israeli soldiers using live rounds and rubber bullets shot and wounded 10 Palestinian protesters in the southern city of Hebron 21 people in the northern city of Nablus. A 24-year-old Palestinian man was killed, according to the humanitarian organization.\n\nAngry protests continue in Tunisia and Morocco\n\nLarge protests erupted Wednesday in Tunisia and Morocco, with demonstrators outraged by a blast that killed hundreds at a hospital in Gaza.\n\nPolice stood by as protestors gathered outside the Parliament in Rabat chanting “Down with America” and demanding that Morocco reverse its 2020 decision to normalize relations and deepen security ties with Israel.\n\nIn Tunis, protesters gathered outside the U.S. and French Embassies to condemn those nations’ support of Israel and demanding that their ambassadors be removed from Tunisia.\n\nObservers said Wednesday’s demonstrations were among the largest since the Arab Spring more than a decade ago.\n\nEzer Imeny, a Tunisian student protesting outside the French Embassy, said the war shows rulers worldwide, including Arab ones, lack moral authority.\n\n“Palestine, we are with you to the death,” Imeny said “An eye for an eye.”\n\n3:12 p.m. EDT\n\nRiot police quell pro-Palestinian protest in Athens\n\nATHENS, Greece — Greek riot police fired tear gas Wednesday after participants in a thousands-strong pro-Palestinian march tried to advance on the Israeli Embassy in Athens.\n\nNo arrests or injuries were reported, and the unrest ended quickly.\n\nAn estimated 10,000 people took part in Wednesday evening’s demonstration, many waving Palestinian flags. The march was organized by left-wing groups and Palestinians in Greece.\n\nEarlier, about a hundred people took part in a pro-Israeli gathering outside the embassy. That ended well before the pro-Palestinian march.\n\nThe Greek government has voiced strong support for Israel in its war with Hamas.\n\nNY governor visits Israel to show solidarity\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel — New York Gov. Kathy Hochul arrived in Israel Wednesday to show support for the country during its war with Hamas.\n\nThe Democrat was met at Ben-Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv by Israel’s ambassador to the U.S., Michael Herzog.\n\nAfter a security briefing, Hochul met with families near the airport and was scheduled to head to a food pantry to help pack and drop off boxes for people displaced by the conflict. Hochul is expected to stay in Jerusalem overnight.\n\nShe said her trip is meant as a gesture of solidarity and support for Israel. New York is home to the largest Jewish population of any U.S. city, according to the American Jewish Population Project at Brandeis University.\n\n“There is a deep, direct connection between New York state and Israel that has always been there, a bond steeled over decades,” Hochul said.\n\nProtesters around the world berate Biden for Israel support\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, who defended Israel during his visit to Tel Aviv, has become a target of angry protests in support of Palestinians.\n\nBiden’s visit Wednesday came a day after a blast caused massive carnage at a Gaza hospital. Hamas said it was from an Israeli airstrike while Israel blamed a rocket misfired by other Palestinian militants. Biden sided with Israel, saying the explosion appeared to be the work of the “other team.”\n\nREAD MORE: Despite setbacks, Biden reaches aid breakthrough on Israel trip\n\nThe Associated Press has not independently verified any of the claims or evidence released by the parties.\n\nIn Amman, a sign hoisted by one protester labeled Biden and Netanyahu war criminals, saying: “Partner in Crime.”\n\n“Today, the Jordanians declare that the Americans are an enemy, just as the Israeli enemy is,” political activist Rania al-Nimr said.\n\nAt the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh in south Lebanon, protesters set fire to a cardboard cutout of Biden’s head with a rope around his neck and blood painted over his mouth.\n\nIn Tokyo, protesters outside the U.S. Embassy chanted “USA, shame on you” and “Joe Biden, shame on you.”\n\nEgypt foreign minister confirms agreement on aid to Gaza\n\nCAIRO — Egypt’s foreign minister has confirmed there’s an agreement between Egypt, Israel and other international actors to allow aid to enter the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing.\n\nIn an interview with Al-Arabiya, Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said he hoped aid would enter the Palestinian enclave soon but did not provide a timeframe. He said Egypt would work under “the supervision of the United Nations, and in coordination with the Egyptian and Palestinian (branches) of the Red Cross.”\n\nAsked whether foreign nationals would be allowed to leave Gaza, Shoukry was more cautious, replying: “As long as the (Rafah) crossing is operating normally and the (crossing) facility has been repaired.” Egyptian authorities say the Rafah crossing has been damaged by four Israeli airstrikes.\n\nHamas rejects claims that Israel isn’t behind hospital blast\n\nBEIRUT — Hamas is denying Israel’s claims that another militant group was responsible for the massive explosion at a Gaza City hospital that killed hundreds of people.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Hamas said that in the days before Tuesday’s blast at al-Ahli Hospital, Israeli authorities sent threats to several Gaza Strip hospitals and told each to evacuate otherwise “they will be responsible for what happens.”\n\nREAD MORE: Biden says ‘it appears’ Israeli military not responsible for deadly blast at Gaza hospital\n\nHamas said Israeli forces have targeted several emergency departments and ambulances since the violence began, adding that Israeli military officials contacted 21 hospitals including Al-Ahli, demanding that they evacuate “immediately because they are located in area of operations for the Israeli” army.\n\nThere have been conflicting claims about who was responsible for the explosion. Hamas officials in Gaza quickly blamed an Israeli airstrike, saying nearly 500 were killed. Israel denied it was involved and released a flurry of video, audio and other information that it said showed the blast was instead due to a rocket misfire by Islamic Jihad, another militant group operating in Gaza. Islamic Jihad dismissed that claim.\n\nThe Associated Press has not independently verified any of the claims or evidence released by the parties.\n\nAny vehicle will do in rush to get airstrike victims to Gaza hospital\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — A steady stream of ambulances, taxis, cars and a motorcycle sped to the entrance of the Khan Younis hospital carrying the victims of reported Israeli airstrikes on Gaza Wednesday.\n\nSirens blared and horns honked to clear the way before they screeched to a stop. Crowds lining the street outside watched the urgent scene repeat itself.\n\nMen jumped from the vehicles and scrambled to open rear and side doors and remove the casualties laying on car seats. Hospital workers and others standing nearby helped carry bodies that appeared to be in various states of consciousness.\n\nA man rushed into the hospital with a limp child in his arms. A girl with a large cloth on her head as a bandage was helped from the car but still walking. Several of the injured had to be carried by multiple men or hoisted onto gurneys.\n\nAs soon as the wounded were unloaded, the drivers sped off and more vehicles arrived.\n\nUNHCR says it has 3,000 tons of aid for Gaza ready in Egypt\n\nGENEVA — The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a Wednesday news release that an estimated 3,000 tons of humanitarian assistance are awaiting entry to Gaza from Egypt.\n\nOCHA said it estimates about one million people are internally displaced, including about 352,000 people sheltering in UNRWA schools in central and southern Gaza “in increasingly dire conditions.”\n\nIt said Gaza is “still under a full electricity blackout.”\n\nHostages’ families decry Israeli decision to let aid into Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM — The families of hostages held in Gaza have harshly criticized the Israeli government’s decision to allow limited humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\nA statement released Wednesday by the Hostage and Missing Families Forum said the move only increased their suffering.\n\n“Children, infants, women, soldiers, men, and elderly, some with serious illnesses, wounded and shot, are held underground like animals and without human conditions, and the Israeli government pampers the murderers and kidnappers with baklavas and medicines,” the statement read.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said earlier Wednesday that Israel would allow deliveries of food, water and medicine to Gaza, as long as the supplies do not reach Hamas.\n\nHamas says militants are holding 250 hostages in Gaza.\n\nU.S. vetoes UN resolution to condemn violence in Israel-Hamas war\n\nUNITED NATIONS — The United States has vetoed a U.N. resolution that would have condemned violence against all civilians in the Israel-Hamas war including “the heinous terrorists attacks by Hamas” against Israel, and would have pushed for humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nTwelve of the 15 Security Council members on Wednesday voted in favor of the resolution sponsored by Brazil. The United States voted against, while Russia and the United Kingdom abstained.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said after the vote that President Joe Biden is in the region engaging in diplomacy to secure the release of hostages, prevent the conflict from spreading, and stress the need to protect civilians.\n\n“We need to let that diplomacy play out,” she said.\n\nRussia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused the United States of “hypocrisy” and “double standards,” saying the Americans didn’t want a solution in the Security Council.\n\nBrazil, France, China, the United Arab Emirates and many other council members expressed regret and disappointment at the U.S. veto.\n\n12:53 p.m. EDT\n\nU.S. says intelligence assessment shows Israel not behind Gaza hospital blast\n\nWASHINGTON — An intelligence assessment shows Israel was “not responsible” for the explosion at a Gaza hospital, but information is still being collected, the White House said Wednesday.\n\nThe assessment is “based on analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open source information,” National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a social media post.\n\nThe announcement followed President Joe Biden’s comment to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that “based on what I’ve seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you.”\n\nThere have been conflicting claims of who was responsible for the hospital blast. Officials in Gaza quickly blamed an Israeli airstrike. Israel denied it was involved and released a flurry of video, audio and other information that it said showed the blast was instead due to a missile misfire by Islamic Jihad, another militant group operating in Gaza. The Islamic Jihad dismissed that claim.\n\nThe Associated Press has not independently verified any of the claims or evidence released by the parties.\n\nBiden said there were “a lot of people out there” who weren’t sure what caused the blast, which sparked protests throughout the Middle East. He later said he made the assertion based off “data from my Defense Department.”\n\nBiden says U.S. to provide $100 million for Palestinians in Gaza and West Bank\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel — The United States is promising $100 million in humanitarian assistance to help Palestinian people who have been displaced or otherwise affected by conflict in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced in a news release Wednesday that the assistance would be provided through trusted partners, including U.N. agencies and international NGOs.\n\nBiden is in Tel Aviv to show support for Israel following the Hamas attacks more than a week ago that killed some 1,400 people. His announcement came after Israel agreed to allow limited aid into Gaza from Egypt.\n\n“Civilians are not to blame and should not suffer for Hamas’s horrific terrorism,” Biden said. “Civilian lives must be protected and assistance must urgently reach those in need.”\n\nAid group warns of unnecessary deaths at Gaza hospitals\n\nPARIS — Doctors Without Borders says severely injured people at overwhelmed Gaza hospitals are likely to die because the medical system is collapsing.\n\nThe aid group’s president in France, Isabelle Defourny, said Wednesday that one of their surgeons in Gaza reported he will likely have to perform amputations on patients in the coming days because the breakdown in medical care means their limbs cannot be saved.\n\n“The seriously injured who arrive every day … are condemned in the days to come,” she said. “The doctors, the nurses courageously continuing to work won’t succeed in saving their lives. Help is needed extremely urgently.”\n\n11:28 a.m. EDT\n\nIsrael allows Egypt to deliver limited aid to Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM — Israel says it will allow Egypt to deliver limited quantities of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the decision was approved Wednesday in light of a request from visiting President Joe Biden.\n\nIn a statement, it said it “will not thwart” deliveries of food, water and medicine, as long as the supplies do not reach Hamas.
