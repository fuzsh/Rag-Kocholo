        "text": "The only child of Jozsef Barsi and Maria Benko, Judith Eva Barsi beat 10,000-to-1 odds when she was discovered at a San Fernando Valley skating rink at age 5 1/2 in 1983 and mistaken for a three-year-old. Her first commercial was for Donald Duck Orange Juice and she went on to appear in anywhere between fifty and a hundred commercials, several episodes of various T.V. series, and three major motion pictures. Her mother Maria was the main thrust of her career as a Hollywood starlet, but also took great pains to try to give her a normal, happy childhood; bringing her Hungarian meals like duck for her school lunch. But this happy childhood did not last long. Beginning in 1985, Jozsef would often be home drunk instead of working as a plumber, and he refused to let Maria work. As a result, the family briefly went on welfare until Judith's career took off in 1986 and 1987. By the time she entered fourth grade, she was pulling in an estimated $100,000 a year, which bought her family a nice four-bedroom house on a quiet street in West Hill. As her career soared, her father became an increasingly abusive recluse who constantly threatened to kill his wife and daughter. In stressful moods Judith bit her nails and plucked out her eyebrows and eyelashes and her cats' whiskers. C.P.S. was called in numerous times, but as Maria was reluctant to press charges and many of the reports/accounts were emotional and not physical abuse, the case was not pursued.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 27th, Eunice Daly, a next-door neighbor, heard a loud bang next door while watering her plants. The house had been set on fire, and later the Barsis' bodies were discovered shot dead. All of Judith's toys that were not destroyed by the fire were given to the local Goodwill, and her best friend continued to feed her cats for months afterward.\n\nThis beautiful, long-legged blonde actress was known to be a kind, intelligent and dependable actor with a comedic talent as well. She appeared in many American TV hits of the 1970s and 1980s, such as Herzbube mit zwei Damen (1976), Die Jeffersons (1975), Mike Hammer (1984), Trio mit vier Fäusten (1984), Knight Rider (1982), Wer ist hier der Boß? (1984), Das A-Team (1983), Harrys wundersames Strafgericht (1984), Überflieger (1990) and Palm Beach-Duo (1991), among others. Her big-screen debut came in the 1982 Amy Heckerling film Ich glaub' ich steh' im Wald (1982), as the character Mrs. Vargas. This film starred Sean Penn and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Lana then landed a role in the Roger Corman fantasy epic Der Todesjäger (1983). This led to her being offered the title role in Corman's next film, the cult classic Barbarian Queen (1985). It was this association with the legendary Corman that really put Lana on the B-movie map. After starring in \"Barbarian Queen\" as the sword-wielding lead, a character Corman fondly refers to as \"the original Xena,\" Lana then reprised the role in the sequel Barbarian Queen II (1990).\n\nLana's larger-than-life personality and striking beauty, along with several of the movie roles she chose, inspired a cult fan following. This warm fanfare was further cemented by her work in the John Landis spoof Amazonen auf dem Mond oder Warum die Amerikaner den Kanal voll haben (1987). She was always a favorite at the ever-growing comic book conventions, where she happily signed autographs and was known to be friendly and accessible to all of her loyal fans, both young and old alike.\n\nLana also did stunt work in Retroactive - Gefangene der Zeit (1997). Her last film was March (2001), as Dr. Ellen Taylor. Even though she did not do many movies toward the end of her life, she found success working in television commercials, for such products as Mercedes-Benz, Nike, Anheiser Busch, Playtex bras, Kmart and Mattel. She had been spending her time creating comedic characters for many of these companies. While working for the KMART Corp., Lana made personal appearances as the character she created for the Route 66 clothing campaign, Katie Earline Wilson. She was an actress who had more to offer Hollywood in the future, had her life not been cut so tragically short.\n\nAt age 36, actress Barbara Colby was on the brink of TV-character stardom when the native New Yorker was senselessly shot and killed one evening on the streets of Los Angeles. The tall, toothy, husky-voiced, frizzy-haired actress equipped with a keen, Brooklyn-tough sensibility and dead-on comedy instincts had just started to make a name for herself on the West Coast when tragedy occurred. Hollywood lost a wonderful personality and promising talent that summer evening, someone who was proving to the TV masses that she was a bona fide contender.\n\nThough born in New York City in 1939, Barbara was raised predominantly in New Orleans where her interest in acting grew while attending high school. After her graduation in 1957, she received a scholarship to Bard College on the Hudson back in New York, followed by a single semester at the Paris Sorbonne University in France.\n\nWhile she tried to make a go of it professionally on the New York stage, her spiritual world also began to open and develop. In contrast to her tough, streetwise exterior, the gentle, deep-feeling lady avidly pursued a metaphysical way of life. She didn't touch alcohol, was a strict vegetarian, and meditated regularly as a devoted follower of the Indian Hindu guru Swami Muktananda. She also was a firm believer in reincarnation.\n\nFollowing a solid stage performance in \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\" in 1964, Barbara took to the Broadway lights with a debut in \"The Devils\" the following year. Throughout the rest of the decade, she impressed in such plays as \"Under Milk Wood\", \"Murder in the Cathedral\" and \"Dear Liar\", and also garnered fine notices for her Portia in \"Julius Caesar\" in 1966 at the American Shakespeare Theatre Festival in Stratford, Connecticut.\n\nMarking her first prime TV role on a Columbo (1971) episode in 1971, Barbara began a bi-coastal career and played a host of support/guest roles on such established shows as Ein seltsames Paar (1968), McMillan & Wife (1971), F.B.I. (1965), Medical Center (1969), Kung Fu (1972) and Rauchende Colts (1955). But it was MTM Productions that took strongly to Barbara after she made a hilarious appearance as worldly prostitute Sherry opposite an impossibly naive Mary Tyler Moore in a now-classic 1974 jail-cell episode of the Moore comedy series. Producers were so impressed by Barbara's dead-pan comic timing and appealingly sharp, cynical edge that they brought her character back in a subsequent episode.\n\nNever giving up her love for the stage, Barbara continued to gain in strength in such quirky '70s plays as \"Aubrey Beardsley the Neophyte\", \"House of Blue Leaves\", \"Afternoon Tea\" and \"The Hot L. Baltimore\". She also returned to the classics with an off-Broadway role as Elizabeth in \"Richard III,\" and was back on Broadway with the plays \"Murderous Angels\" in 1971 and a revival of \"A Doll's House\" starring Liv Ullmann in the early part of 1975. Following the close of the latter show, Barbara returned to Los Angeles with a career-making offer. MTM had just cast her as a regular player on a spin-off from Oh Mary (1970). The new sitcom, Phyllis (1975), starred actress Cloris Leachman who had played one of Mary's self-absorbed, scatterbrained friends to Emmy-winning effect. Barbara, who appeared earlier with Leachman in the TV-movie A Brand New Life (1973), was now in \"second banana\" position playing Cloris' boss, Julie Erskine, the owner of a commercial photography studio. The actress had officially paid her dues and broken into the top sitcom ranks. With two films also in the can, California Split (1974) and The Memory of Us (1974), Barbara seemed poised for bigger things.\n\nOn July 24, 1975, just weeks after her 36th birthday and only three episodes into the TV series, Barbara and her acting colleague/boyfriend, James Kiernan, were walking to their car following the teaching of an acting class in Venice, California, when they were deliberately shot by two gang members inside a parking garage area. Barbara, who was estranged at the time from Robert Levitt Jr., the son of legendary entertainer Ethel Merman, died instantly from her single gunshot wound; Mr. Kiernan, who had recently appeared in an episode of MTM's \"Rhoda,\" was able to describe the shooting to police before he succumbed but could not recognize the two men who shot them, noting that the shooting had occurred without warning, reason or provocation. Police noted that there was no attempt to rob the pair and appeared to be a random act of violence. The killers were never caught and the homicide remains a \"cold case\". Barbara was later cremated and a memorial service held at Will Geer's Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga Canyon. She was survived by her mother and younger sister Renee.\n\nFollowing the tragedy, comedienne Liz Torres came on board to replace Barbara in the Julie Erskine part. The role itself lasted for only one season before they changed the sitcom's setting in order to try and improve the lackluster ratings. It didn't help. Despite a Golden Globe win for Leachman, the show was canceled after only one more season. In retrospect, one can't tell whether Barbara might have made a difference in the sitcom's ratings or outcome, but the fact remains that a single inexplicably brutal and senseless act snuffed out the life of a star comedienne in the making.\n\nBob Crane was born in Waterbury, CT, the youngest of two sons. In school he was known for being a class clown and an intense music lover. His favorites were jazz and big band. Bob's specialty was the drums. After graduating from Stamford High School in 1946, he turned his attention to his love for music. He became a drummer with the Connecticut Symphony Orchestra for about a year. He was later dismissed for not being \"serious enough\". In 1949 Bob married Ann Terzian, his high school sweetheart. They had three children - Robert David Crane, Debbie, and Karen. In 1956 Bob and his family left the east and moved out west to California. There he began a lengthy, successful career in radio. He worked at KNX radio and became \"King of the Airwaves\" in Los Angeles. His radio program became a huge success, the most listened to on the air. This was due to Crane's personality and humor. He had charm and an undeniable quick wit. Hollywood's biggest and brightest were frequently interviewed by Bob on his show, including Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe, Marvin Gaye, Mary Tyler Moore, and Bob Hope. In the midst of his success, Bob's true goal was to make it big as an actor. He began to make guest appearances on such shows as Dick van Dyke Show (1961) and Unwahrscheinliche Geschichten (1959). He also appeared in the 1961 films, Rückkehr nach Peyton Place (1961) and Die Menschenfalle (1961). In 1963 Bob got a role on the popular Mutter ist die Allerbeste (1958), as \"Dr. Dave Kelsey\". After two years the producers let him go, saying his character was \"too suggestive\". This was no problem for Crane. In 1965 he received the starring role in a new sitcom for CBS called Ein Käfig voller Helden (1965). It was a comedy about a group of POWs in a Nazi prison camp. He played the smooth-talking, crafty \"Colonel Robert Hogan\". Hogan's Heroes became a hit show, finishing in the top 10 at the end of the 1965-66 season. Crane was nominated for an Emmy twice, in 1966 and 1967. He had reached the peak of his success. It was during this time that Crane met Patti Olson, known as Sigrid Valdis. She played \"Hilda\" on Hogan's Heroes. Bob divorced his wife, Ann, after 20 years of marriage, and married Patti in 1970. They married on the set of \"Hogan's Heroes\". They had a son, Scott Crane, in 1971. Also in 1971, the new president of CBS abruptly canceled Hogan's Heroes after a 6-year run. Following the end of Hogan's Heroes Bob continued to act. However the roles were few and not very fulfilling. He starred in Papa ist der Größte (1973) and Gus (1976), two Disney films, and had guest spots on shows, including Make-Up und Pistolen (1974), Mord à la Mode (1975), and Love Boat (1977). Bob briefly had his own show, The Bob Crane Show (1975), in 1975. Unfortunately, NBC canceled the show after 3 months. In 1973 Bob bought the rights to the play \"Beginner's Luck\". He both directed the play and starred in it. The play went around the country, including California, Texas, Hawaii, and Arizona. In June, 1978 Bob took \"Beginner's Luck\" to Scottsdale, Arizona. It was in Scottsdale that the unthinkable happened. In the early morning hours of June 29, 1978, Bob Crane was brutally murdered in his rented apartment room. He was beaten to death while he slept, and strangled with an electrical cord. He was 49 years old. His murder remains unsolved.\n\nBeverly Homer DeLay, known as B.H. DeLay, was an innovator and a aviator actor of French descent. He was born on August 12, 1892 in the Oakland bay area of California. DeLay was also an engineer educated at the University of California as well as the prestigious, centuries old University of Heidelberg in Germany.\n\nB.H. DeLay's company performed at least half a dozen stunt firsts for the movies, including the first change from plane to train and train to plane. Another DeLay first was from saddle to plane, as well as auto to plane. \"Daredevil\" DeLay was the first to knock down a building with a plane on screen too.\n\nB.H. DeLay managed Ince Airfield (of the director and producer, Thomas Ince, well known for inventing the motion picture studio system) before owning it himself. DeLay was involved with over 50 motion pictures, including westerns, comedies and dramas. He acted and performed aerials with Ruth Roland, Oliver Hardy, Larry Semon, Al St. John, Helen Holmes, Viola Dana, Warner Oland, Thomas Ince, Al Wilson, Frank Clarke, Ormer Locklear and many other notables.\n\nHe conducted a movie stunt pilot training school at his airfield in Venice. DeLay worked with over 25 motion picture companies including the original Warner Bros, Pathé, Vitagraph, Astra, Universal, and Fox.\n\nDeLay was only 30 when he died in a sabotaged plane crash performing in front of crowds of thousands at Ocean Park on the 4th of July in 1923. He was in the middle of a loop-the-loop in his plane, the \"Wasp\", when the wings folded back; barreling him nose first into the earth. The plane burst into flames shortly after he was pulled from the wreckage. Pins in his wings were found to be a substandard size of only 3/8 of an inch, rather than 1/2 or 3/4, indicating wing tampering. Several headlines from Venice and other Los Angeles newspapers state that DeLay was murdered through sabotage while performing on 4th of July, 1923. It remains an unsolved murder mystery.\n\nNot only was B.H. DeLay an innovator, he was a humanitarian who frequently organized and performed in aviation or actor benefits for individuals and organizations in need."
