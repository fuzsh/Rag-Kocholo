Neurological complications are significant among the various adverse events following immunization (AEFI) due to their likely durability and debilitating sequelae [1, 2]. Neurological AEs following COVID-19 vaccination can either exacerbate or induce new-onset neuro-immunologic diseases, such as myasthenia gravis (MG), and Guillain–Barre syndrome (GBS) [3–5]. In addition, after vaccination, hypercoagulability and a pro-thrombotic state may further increase cerebrovascular events [6, 7]. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has announced several neurological complications following COVID-19 vaccines [8]. The most common neurological symptoms following COVID-19 vaccines have included headache, anosmia, dysgeusia, myalgia, paresthesia, weakness, and dizziness [9]. Several rare side effects, including tremor, diplopia, tinnitus, dysphonia, delirium, and syncope, have also been observed that are significant to note [10, 11]. The more severe spectrum of AEs post-COVID19 vaccines has included seizures, reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, strokes, GBS, Bell’s palsy, transverse myelitis (TM), and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Here, we discuss each of these neurological adverse effects separately.\n\nBells palsy\n\nBell’S palsy (BP), known as idiopathic facial paralysis, is an acute unilateral peripheral facial nerve palsy [12]. This condition is, in fact, an idiopathic facial palsy of spontaneous origin, although a causal association with the herpes simplex virus has been considered [13]. However, in the current pandemic, studies revealed abundant cases of BP following SARS-CoV-2 infection [14–16]. Several vaccines, including influenza, hepatitis B, and meningococcal conjugate vaccines, have been associated with BP [17–19]. With the development of COVID-19 vaccines, significant concerns have arisen about their potential to trigger the onset of Bell’s palsy. Despite being less prevalent than expected, this complication has still been abundantly reported following these vaccines [12, 20, 21]. Nonetheless, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the frequency of Bell’s palsy cases following vaccination is not more unusual than in the general population [22]. Despite the inability to confirm the causal relationship between the vaccines and this complication, the timing of onset following vaccination can suggest the association. Confirmation would need to be studied in larger populations [23]. This reaction could be either immune-mediated or induced by viral reactivation [24], but the latter does not seem valid for COVID-19 vaccines since no live attenuated COVID-19 vaccine platform has yet been introduced.\n\nThe immune-mediated mechanism for this complication is thought to be through host molecules’ mimicry of the vaccine’s antigens or by eliciting a type I interferons response [25, 26]. The timing of BP onset in relationship to vaccination is unclear, although most of the cases have occurred in an average 4-week interval after vaccination [27]. Moreover, there has been a case of sequential contralateral facial nerve palsies following each dose of COVID-19 vaccines reported recently [27]. Up to now, BP has been reported following various COVID-19 vaccine types, including Pfizer-BioNTech, Janssen, CoronaVac, Moderna, and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines [12, 23, 28–30]. Nonetheless, the risk of developing facial nerve palsy has been estimated to be higher with mRNA vaccines than with other vaccine platforms; this fact can help us decide the choice of COVID-19 vaccine in individuals with a history of BP [31]. It is vital to note that most cases of BP, regardless of etiology, are self-limiting and subside within a few months [32]. However, antiviral agents and steroids are frequently tried as a treatment and hasten recovery [32].\n\nGuillain–Barré Syndrome\n\nGuillain–Barré Syndrome (GBS) is defined as an inflammatory ascending polyradiculoneuropathy. The underlying triggers for this neurological disorder include infections and vaccines on an autoimmune basis [33] (Fig. ). The introduction of COVID vaccines has arisen the concerns of developing GBS following vaccination [34] since GBS had been previously observed in individuals who received the meningococcal, tetanus-toxoid, human papillomavirus (HPV), and most prominently, the influenza vaccines [35–39]. This complication has been reported following Pfizer-BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson, and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 COVID-19 vaccines [1, 40–42]. Moreover, one case of isolated bilateral facial diplegia with paresthesias (BFP), an uncommon variant of GBS, has been reported following the Janssen COVID-19 vaccination [43]. It is believed that vaccine-induced immune responses may trigger autoimmune reactions, resulting in autoantibody production against myelin, resulting in GBS [40]. The diagnosis of vaccine-induced GBS is the same as that of other causes, through clinical and paraclinical findings such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and electromyography and nerve conduction velocity (EMG/NCV) studies, in addition to considering the temporal relationship between the event and vaccination [44]. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) (0.4 g per kg body weight every day for 5 days) and plasma exchange (200–250 ml plasma kg body weight in 5 sessions) can be considered as efficient treatments for GBS [45].\n\nTransverse myelitis\n\nTransverse myelitis (TM) is a condition where spinal cord segments may become inflamed, resulting in significant motor, autonomic and sensory deficits. [46]. Since the beginning of the current pandemic, several cases of TM have been reported in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients [47, 48]. Apart from infections as a cause of TM, vaccines are of great importance in the evolution of this neurological condition [49]. TM following vaccination had previously been observed with various vaccines, including tetanus, measles–mumps–rubella, influenza (H1N1), hepatitis B, polio, and Japanese B encephalitis vaccines [50–54]. This neurological complication has also been reported following COVID-19 vaccination with viral vector-based and mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. However, their association has not been confirmed in a number of trials [2, 55–57]. Moreover, a rare subtype of TM, known as longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), has been reported following COVID-19 vaccination [58]. The pathophysiology of TM in the settings of SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to be either via direct viral neuro-invasion or immune-mediated, while the mechanism by which COVID-19 vaccines might trigger TM may be immune and inflammatory reactions [59, 60]. The diagnosis is made by typical clinical evidence of bilateral sensory, motor, or autonomic dysfunction with an established spinal cord defect origin in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [61]. Unfortunately, TM is a neurological condition with unfavorable outcomes [62]. Although there is insufficient evidence, high-dose IV methylprednisolone (1 g per day for 3–7 days) has to be started immediately for all TM cases to improve neurological function and accelerate recovery [63, 64]. In a case report study, a COVID-19 patient with acute TM treated with high-dose IV methylprednisolone (1 g daily for 3 days) showed improved neurological symptoms immediately after receiving IV corticosteroid therapy [65].\n\nCerebrovascular events\n\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant increase in stroke rates was observed, later discovered to be due to SARS-CoV-2 infection [66–68]. Although not as common as SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 vaccination is also suspected to increase the risk of cerebrovascular events [69]. It is unknown whether the cerebrovascular events, including ischemic/hemorrhagic strokes and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, are related to COVID-19 vaccination. If they are related, it also remains unclear how the vaccines may contribute–by causing arterial hypertension, worsening thrombocytopenia, or exacerbating a hypercoagulable state [70, 71]. Previously, a stroke took place following vaccination with various other vaccines, including diphtheria, measles–mumps–rubella, and influenza vaccines [72–74]. The probability and reports of systemic thrombotic thrombocytopenic events following COVID-19 vaccination have caused a great deal of concern and hesitancy worldwide [71]. The Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine had been the most notorious for this complication that many countries suspended its use [75]. However, thrombotic events have not been uncommon following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine [76, 77]. Cerebrovascular events, including hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes, from venous and arterial etiologies and an increased thrombotic and embolic risk, have been noted [78–81]. There have been reports of thrombosis in the cortical veins, transverse sinus, sigmoid sinus, inferior sagittal sinus, the vein of Galen, and the straight sinus that have all presented with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), shortly after COVID-19 vaccination [80–83].\n\nHowever, we should take into account that individuals with risk factors of thromboembolic events, such as pregnancy, postpartum state, oral contraceptives use, surgery, trauma, immobilization, malignancies, and thrombophilic genetic or autoimmune conditions including anti-thrombin, protein C, and protein S deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, antiphospholipid antibodies, and hyperhomocysteinemia, are more prone to vaccine-induced cerebrovascular complications [84–87]. It is important to note that anti-CXCL4 antibodies are responsible for most cases of vaccine‐induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT); this is similar to what happens with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) [71, 88]. Depending on which vessel is involved, clinical manifestations may range from a simple headache, nausea, vomiting, and diplopia to focal neurologic signs, altered consciousness, and coma. The diagnosis of cerebrovascular AEs is generally made with comprehensive imaging, including brain computed tomography (CT), venogram, angiography, and MRI [89]. Management of cerebrovascular events following vaccination is generally the same as with any other cause, with the goal being assessment and management of risk factors and secondary stroke prevention. Heparin and platelet transfusions should be avoided until VITT has been excluded [90, 91]. In cases of systemic thrombotic thrombocytopenic events, IVIg, high-dose glucocorticoids, and plasmapheresis are recommended when indicated to restore platelet counts and address the autoimmune phenomenon [79, 92].\n\nEncephalopathy\n\nAcute encephalopathy has been attributed to various etiologies, including toxins, infections, and vaccines. One of the most prevalent neurological sequelae of COVID-19 has been encephalopathy which presents with cognitive impairment, altered consciousness, and even seizures [93–96]. However, the condition has been observed much less frequently following COVID-19 vaccination [94, 97–100]. In the past, several cases of encephalopathy had been reported after various vaccines, including hepatitis B, rabies, pertussis, measles, influenza, and HPV vaccines [101–107]. The pathophysiologic mechanism for vaccine-induced acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) seems to be the inflammatory cascade or the cytokine storm triggered by the production of spike protein from translated mRNA in the vaccines [108, 109]. The diagnosis of ADEM in the settings of COVID-19 vaccination is similar to that of other causes and is accomplished through clinical and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings and imaging modalities such as brain MRI. The treatment consists of corticosteroids and sometimes IVIg and plasmapheresis [110]. Fortunately, ADEM has a favorable outcome if conservative support is satisfactory [111].\n\nNew-onset seizures\n\nThe pathophysiologic mechanisms of seizures during a SARS-CoV-2 infection differ significantly from those following COVID-19 vaccination. In the former, specific antibiotic therapies, cerebral hypoxemia, acute renal failure, and electrolyte impairment can be the underlying reasons [112–114]. The latter can happen in the settings of vaccine-induced encephalopathy or venous occlusion [97]. Before the current pandemic, HPV and H1N1 vaccinations had been related to functional (non-epileptic) seizures, which were believed to be psychogenic attacks [115, 116]. The association of febrile seizure with the measles–mumps–rubella–varicella vaccine has long been well established [117]. It is unknown whether non-motor seizures are related to COVID-19 vaccines or only a coincidence [118]. Patients with a known history of epilepsy or prior history of seizures may have a decreased threshold in the post-vaccine period due to the symptoms and illness. Rare attacks have included new-onset refractory status epilepticus that require further assessment and follow-up [119]. The diagnosis is based on clinical history, physical examinations, brain imaging (CT scan and MRI), electroencephalography, and serum prolactin level measurement. There are a variety of antiepileptic drugs (Table ) that can be administered as first-line monotherapy in adults with epilepsy [120].\n\nTable 1\n\nNeurological adverse eventDiagnosisManagementBell’s palsyHistory and physical examination: Rapid-onset (less than 72 h) unilateral paralysis of the facial nerve (weakness or complete loss of movement) with no defined reasonOral corticosteroids (prednisolone) and antiviral agents (acyclovir and valacyclovir)Guillain–Barré SyndromeClinical and paraclinical findings such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and electromyography and nerve conduction velocity (EMG/NCV) studies, in addition to considering the temporal relationship between the event and vaccinationIVIg (0.4 g per kg body weight every day for 5 days) and plasma exchange (200–250 mL plasma per kg body weight in 5 sessions) are similarly efficient remedies for GBSTransverse myelitisTypical clinical evidence of bilateral sensory, motor, or autonomic dysfunction with an established spinal cord defect origin in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)High-dose IV methylprednisolone (1 g daily for 3–7 days)Cerebrovascular eventsBrain computed tomography (CT), venogram, angiography, and MRI\n\nIVIg\n\nHigh-dose glucocorticoids\n\nPlasmapheresis\n\nNon-heparin anticoagulants (like fondaparinux and argatroban)\n\nEncephalopathyClinical and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings and imaging modalities such as brain MRICorticosteroids and sometimes IVIg and plasmapheresisNew-onset seizuresClinical history, physical examinations, brain imaging (CT scan and MRI), electroencephalography, and serum prolactin level measurement\n\nNarrow-spectrum drugs (focal seizure) Carbamazepine\n\nEslicarbazepine\n\nGabapentin\n\nLacosamide\n\nOxcarbazepine\n\nPhenytoin\n\nBroad-spectrum drugs (focal and almost all generalized seizures)\n\nLamotrigine\n\nLevetiracetam\n\nTopiramate\n\nValproate\n\nZonisamide\n\nMyasthenia gravis exacerbationSuspected through compatible signs and symptoms of fatigable muscle weakness and confirmed by EMG studies, pharmacologic testing, and serum Ab assay\n\nPyridostigmine (30 mg 3–4 times a day, then can be increased to 60 mg 4 times a day)\n\nOral prednisone (0.75–1 mg per kg daily)\n\nAzathioprine\n\nCyclosporine\n\nTacrolimus\n\nRituximab\n\nVaricella-zoster virus reactivationClinical manifestations (dermatomal rash, pain, paresthesia, dysesthesia, allodynia, pruritus), IF test for VZV antigen, PCR test for VZV DNA\n\nAcyclovir (800 mg orally 5 times a day for 7–10 days)\n\nValacyclovir (1 g orally 3 times a day for 7 days)\n\nFamciclovir (500 mg orally 3 times a day for 7 days)\n\nVaricella-zoster virus reactivation\n\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, several cases of herpes zoster have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, even in immunocompetent individuals [121, 122]. The potential mechanism for this event is suggested to be COVID-19-induced lymphopenia and CD4+ T cell dysfunction [123]. Nonetheless, immunomodulation, immune dysregulation, and attenuated alloreactivity are believed to be the underlying pathophysiology for vaccine-induced herpes zoster reactivation [124, 125]. Herpes zoster reactivation was previously reported following yellow fever, influenza, hepatitis A, and rabies vaccines [126, 127]. Up to the present time, this neurological complication has been reported following various COVID-19 vaccines, including mRNA-based (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna), viral vector (Oxford ChAdOx1-S or AZD1222), and inactivated vaccines (COVAXIN) [125, 128–133]. Moreover, a case of varicella-zoster virus-induced small vessel vasculitis following the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has been reported [134]. It should be noted that in all suspected cases of vaccine-induced herpes zoster reactivation, a de novo SARS-CoV-2 infection should be ruled out. The diagnosis is made with clinical manifestations (dermatomal rash, pain, paresthesia, dysesthesia, allodynia, and pruritus), immunofluorescence (IF) test for VZV antigen, and PCR test for VZV DNA. acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir (guanosine analogs) are recommended for VZV treatment [135].\n\nMiscellaneous neurological adverse events\n\nApart from the aforementioned neurological side effects, some other AEs, including narcolepsy, small fiber neuropathy, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), and multiple sclerosis flare-ups, have been reported following COVID-19 vaccination, although their causal relationships are not confirmed [4, 136–139].\n\nRelative risks of neurological adverse events in SARS-CoV-2 infection vs. post-COVID-19 vaccination\n\nMany studies have reported various neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 infection and vaccines [80, 140–143]. However, given the shortage of comprehensive, prospective studies, it is still far too difficult to establish cause-effect relations between these factors. Therefore, future studies should determine the real risk of these adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination. Until then, it does not seem reasonable to limit vaccine administration. Nonetheless, considering the existing data, in this section, we have summarized some studies reporting cases of neurological adverse events associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination (Table ).\n\nTable 2\n\nCase numberReferenceNeurological disorderSex/Age (years)CountryClinical manifestationDiagnosisTreatmentAssociated with SARS-CoV-2 infection vs post-COVID-19 vaccination1Afshar et al.
