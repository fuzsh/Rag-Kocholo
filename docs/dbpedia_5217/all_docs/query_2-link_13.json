        "text": "Novelist Laurie Frankel has a track record of writing stories that are sensitive and deeply felt. With her latest, This Is How It Always Is, she takes that to a new level. The story follows a family whose youngest child is born a boy, but in kindergarten becomes known instead as Poppy. It's a timely subject, but also one that hits close to home; Frankel's daughter is also a transgender child.\n\nThe novel will make readers think, and may challenge some preconceived notions about transgender people. BookPage spoke to Frankel about the process of writing a story that has some obvious parallels with her own.\n\nAs the mother of a transgender child, you had a deep personal connection to this novel. Why did you feel compelled to write it now?\n\nNow is an exciting time to be talking about these issues because, for the first time in history, lots of transgender kids and adults are coming out to acceptance, understanding, and celebration from their loved ones and communities. Great strides have been made. Horizons have widened. More and more people around the world are starting to see gender as a broad and complex spectrum along which there are infinite wonderful possibilities. But now is also a critical time to be talking about these issues. Legislators all over the country are proposing bills to restrict and remove transgender people’s rights and indeed safety. They’re doing it with lies. They’re doing it with cruelty. They are making the world are meaner, harder, scarier, less fair, more dangerous place for all of us, trans and otherwise. So part of the reason to write this book right now is to spread the love, spread the understanding, spread the truth and combat the other stuff.\n\nWhy did you choose to fictionalize your experience rather than writing a memoir?\n\nWell, the easy answer is I am a novelist, not a memoirist. I love fiction. I believe in fiction. And I also believe fiction is truer than memoir. Just because it didn’t actually happen doesn’t make it less true. Fiction allows you to tell the stories that should happen, with the perfect arrangement of events and characters and relationships, rather than the imperfect ones that actually do happen. It’s also true that I am keen to protect my kid’s privacy. And frankly, thankfully, our own story is pretty boring and plot-free—great for living, poor for book-writing, so I got to make it up instead. Transgender identity can be a difficult concept for some people to grasp.\n\nWhat is one thing you wish people understood about children like Poppy?\n\nActually, I wish people understood that children who aren’t like Poppy are in fact just like Poppy. All kids are average in some ways and outliers in others. All kids conform sometimes and struggle others. All kids face challenges and change unpredictably and grow in directions other than the ones their parents imagined. And all should be loved and honored and celebrated for who they are. This is how it always is. Over the course of the novel, Poppy grows to be older than your own daughter and faces medical questions regarding puberty.\n\nAll kids face challenges and change unpredictably and grow in directions other than the ones their parents imagined. This is how it always is.\n\nHow did you research the medical implications of the story?\n\nMy friend Carol Cassella is a great novelist and also a great doctor, and she helped me with the medical stuff for this book, though mostly I needed her assistance with the hospital scenes because the mom in the book is an emergency room physician (and I am very much not). The medical questions for transgender kids are important and complex but fairly comprehensible for a layperson. I read books. I read studies. I went to conferences and consulted experts. I met a lot of people. I asked a lot of questions. I listened. There’s a lot of information available now. I took in as much as possible.\n\nI'm always curious about process. Did writing a book so close to home come quickly or was it more challenging? This book wrote pretty smoothly. Who knows why? Some books come easy; some come hard. It didn’t feel so close to home while I was writing it because in my head it’s so made up. The family in the book looks nothing like mine. Poppy is really nothing like my kid. From the outside, they seem so close. But because I know them both so well—and because for one of them I consciously made up every single thing—they don’t seem alike to me at all. As you say, for most of the book, Poppy’s older than my child, so writing her was very much an act of imagination.\n\nSibling dynamics are an important part of the novel, with the four brothers reacting in different ways to decisions their parents make regarding Poppy. And of course, those dynamics can be an important part of our life stories. You're the mother of one child. Do you have siblings yourself? Did your experience growing up with them inform this part of the story?\n\nI have one sister. We were nothing like the horde of boys in this novel. The large family was part of the original idea for this book though. Lots of the details come later in the process, but that wasn’t one of them; that one was in the seed of the thing. For a while, I couldn’t decide whether I wanted them to be boys or girls, but I knew I wanted five siblings from the get-go, even though I also knew it would be hard to fully develop all those characters (and it was). So many siblings allowed me to explore how growing up is tough for everyone—in different ways but no matter what. All kids surprise you, need accommodation sometimes, love and understanding always.\n\nThe idea of finding community and sharing answers and questions and secrets and stories is the reason I write books.\n\nThe notion of finding community and answers by sharing our secrets is powerful. Did that come to you in the process of writing, or was that idea what set you on this path?\n\nThe idea of finding community and sharing answers and questions and secrets and stories is the reason I write books. It’s also the reason I read them (and I do so voraciously). There has maybe never been a more important time to find commonalities with one another, to read lives and perspectives which are different from our own, to seek strength in our communities, to share our stories. Those are the ideas that set me not just on this path but on all my paths.\n\nWhat are you working on next? I’m at work on a new novel, which I’m not talking about yet I’m afraid (writers are superstitious like that), and making plans for the one after that. I’m also writing lots of essays around This Is How It Always Is to answer some of the very important, very timely questions like the sort you pose (and thank you so much for doing so). I think for the most part people’s curiosity about this topic comes from a place of love and recognition so I am eager to answer questions, share stories and talk about how great these kids are. So thanks for asking!\n\nALSO IN BOOKPAGE: Read our review of This Is How It Always Is.\n\nKamila Shamsie’s Home Fire brings Sophocles’ Antigone to present-day London, weaving a remarkably timely tale of two British Muslim families with differing ideas about bigotry, belief and loyalty.\n\nWith the proposed ban on Muslim travel and the most recent attacks in London, your novel could not be more timely. How do you think fiction can help us make sense of political crises?\n\nI can’t say I’m finding much sense in today’s political crises myself, but one of fiction’s gifts—and discomforts—is its ability to put us in the perspectives of people from whose lives we usually feel very removed. But having said that, reading is about an exchange that occurs between the novel and the reader, so you need readers with a willingness to be placed within those perspectives.\n\nYour books often have multiple narrative threads. Home Fire is no exception. What does that format offers you as a writer?\n\nThe answer to that probably lies in John Berger’s wonderful and oft-quoted line: Never again will a single story be told as though it were the only one.\n\nWhat is your family like? You mother is also a writer, isn’t she?\n\nShe is, and so is my sister. You know how Tolstoy said all happy families are alike? If he’s right about that (and who am to argue with Tolstoy), then my family is like all other happy families.\n\nWhat kind of research did you do for Home Fire?\n\nDifferent kinds of research. There was the book kind: reading a number of different translations of Antigone, since the novel draws heavily on it. The wandering kind: going around areas of London in which parts of the book were set, and talking to people there or just taking in the physical details. The drawing on memory kind: Most of the Massachusetts section required nothing more than thinking back to my grad school days at UMass Amherst, and subsequent visits. The taking from someone else kind: When I was starting the novel, the writer Gillian Slovo was working on a verbatim play called Another World: How we lost our children to Islamic State, and she did copious research and let me have whichever bits of it I wanted. The will-this-get-me-into-trouble kind: There was quite a lot I had to find out about life in Raqqa under Islamic State, for which I spent a lot of time looking over my shoulder while online, hyper-conscious of our world of internet surveillance. That hyper-consciousness worked its way into the novel, so perhaps I can consider it a form of research.\n\nYou have lived in Pakistan, the U.S. and England. How have those different countries influenced your writing?\n\nI really don’t know how to point to a particular country and say, x or y aspect of my writing comes from there, but perhaps my interest in multiple narratives comes from moving between places of overlapping histories that see those histories from such different perspectives.\n\nHome Fire features all the current modes of social media communication, such as Skype, Twitter and, of course, email. What are some of the challenges of depicting our very up-to-the minute modern forms of communication?\n\nHonestly? The biggest challenge was to get over my dislike of using brand names in my novels. It feels too much like product placement, and also feels as though it’s the part of the novel most likely to start seeming outdated well before any other part of it does.\n\nWho are some of your favorite contemporary writers?\n\nAli Smith, Michael Ondaatje, Nadeem Aslam, Juan Gabriel Vásquez, Tahmima Anam, Elena Ferrante, Hisham Matar, Toni Morrison, Marilynne Robinson.\n\nYou have a very lyrical style. Do you write any poetry?\n\nNo, but one of my earliest influences was the poet Agha Shahid Ali, so I’m happy to think he’s still to be found somewhere in my work.\n\nDo you think of yourself as a political novelist?\n\nI’m a writer. How I should be described more specifically is something that’s probably more relevant to those on the outside than to me. I like to think that every novel I write contains many different elements to it. Having said that, I am absolutely not someone who thinks that politics is separate from the most intimate details of people’s lives—from wars to visa regulations to health care, our lives are constantly coming into contact with, and being changed by, decisions made “on high.” My novels reflect this way of seeing the world.\n\nWhat do you like to do when you are not writing?\n\nMost writing days are followed by evenings with close friends, so I suppose that’s top of the list. Though the thing most likely to turn my writing day into a nonwriting day is the Pakistan cricket team (trust me, cricket is a far more thrilling sport than most noncricket fans realize).\n\nRead our review of Home Fire.\n\nAuthor photo credit Zain Mustafa.\n\nAuthor Omar El Akkad talks with Luis Alberto Urrea via email about The House of Broken Angels, the BookPage Top Pick in Fiction for March 2018.\n\nDear Luis,\n\nThank you so much for writing this beautiful book. It is wondrous, overflowing with life, and though I grew up on the other side of the planet from its characters, I felt a kinship with them and reflection of my own memories of family and home.\n\nBelow are a few questions. I apologize in advance for their long-windedness, and if they miss the point of the novel entirely. I wish you the best of luck with this amazing work, and I hope we get to meet in person one day.\n\nTake care,\n\nOmar\n\nThe House of Broken Angels is centered on a single sprawling family, but in many ways the novel is concerned with the ways in which we mourn and measure a life nearing the end. Did writing this book change your outlook on what constitutes a well-lived life?\n\nAs I enter my 60s, I think about this topic often. I think one of the gists of this book is exactly that—taking stock, appreciating and accepting what has gone before. It’s about the ripples: how one person’s life sends ripples out from the center of the pond and those ripples move across the surface until they reach the shore, sending smaller ripples back towards the center. Everything is touched, everything is changed, even if just a small bit. Maybe it is my version of It’s a Wonderful Life. We sell ourselves short and think our lives are too small, maybe meaningless. How lovely would it be to see all the good we have done before we have to say goodbye?\n\nHow difficult is it to produce a work of fiction when it’s modeled so closely on your own personal experience, especially when that experience is of a sibling’s death?\n\nNot to be dramatic, but there are a couple of levels of difficulty. Certainly the pain factor is high. However, as a craftsman, I must honor the novel. It is not, after all, a memoir. That being said, my brother was a tremendous character, and at times, it seemed like he was co-writing it. I think we all, to some extent, mine personal experience in our writing. Whether it be people, events or places that we know, our lives color our writing.\n\nI honestly didn’t see how this could be a book at first. Maybe a poem. But other people saw it. Everything transformed for me when I saw Jim Harrison a few weeks after the funeral, and he asked me to tell him the story of my brother’s death. He listened intently and then said, “Sometimes God hands you a novel. You’d better write it.” Still, it could not be a story until it could stop being the story of my own family and move into more imaginary realms.\n\nYou mentioned The Godfather as a book that influenced you greatly. What is it about the family epic that makes it so well suited to accurately describing the American experience? What do you hope readers whose cultural background might differ from yours will take away from your own family epic?\n\nIt seems to me that America as a nation has certain tropes that are sacred, like the concept of “home” and “family.” What is the melting pot but a mythological cry for us all to be some extended family? I think our task is always to show each other that we are human. Rudolfo Anaya told me when I was much younger that if I could make my grandmother in Tijuana the grandmother of a reader in Iowa through my work, I would have committed the greatest political and religious act of my life. I believed him.\n\nThe House of Broken Angels is being published during what feels like a particularly dangerous moment in American history, a moment where the scapegoating of immigrants seems even more shrill than usual. How much did the current political situation factor into your thinking when you were writing this book?\n\nI believe there is no “them,” there is only “us.” I know it’s true because the very thought seems to cause rage in some people. The book evolved over time from an intimate novella to a wilder beast. Once the discourse was of “bad hombres,” rapists, walls, I knew immediately this was not going to be the end of it. I thought, “You are talking about my family.” And my family has been insulted enough. It was time to fight, and my weapon is words. And I had faith in my words because I knew them to be true. I spend many days now talking to Latino kids. Try it sometime, if you want to see what political damage looks like. They don’t know our country once had the same attitude toward Italians, toward the Irish. I tell them, “Just wait, they are going to get tired of attacking you, and you will grow in strength. One day, you’ll be amazed when they start complaining about those damn Norwegians.” The awful lighthouse beam will cycle around.\n\nFinally, the last thing I wanted this book to be about was “immigration.” We, as artists, set the agenda. It’s part of our job. So what if “a Mexican-American novel” is an AMERICAN novel about AMERICANS, who happen to be of Mexican origin? Who happen to be Chicano? What then? It seems funny to me that some people still can’t get their heads around that idea.\n\nI was struck by the deep reverence with which your prose treats the sensory experience of life. So much of the novel revolves around small miracles of taste, scent, touch. Was this something you intended to highlight before you started the book, or did it come about naturally as you were writing?\n\nThank you for noting that. You honestly hit on the mainstay of all of my writing. My students will either laugh when they see this question or groan in misery because I am always pushing them to find these very things in their work. It’s all about grace in my work.\n\nBig Angel, the patriarch of the de la Cruz family, is in almost all respects a large man for the majority of his life, but is finally hobbled and brought to physical smallness by disease. There is, in his story, the potential for sadness to overwhelm all else, but the novel never retreats to that place. How did you go about celebrating as well as lamenting the space where memory and mortality intersect?\n\nOddly, all of my books are sad comedies. The paradox of Big Angel is that he grows larger and larger as he approaches the vanishing point. I had never been intimately involved in someone’s physical diminishment like I was with my brother’s, and my experience was nothing compared to the experience of those who dealt with his affliction on a daily basis. Even in the darkest hour in the hospital, he was utterly, grandly himself. We are all, in this family, blessed with spectacular egos, but his grip on his own myth was powerful for all of us because his personal myth extended outward into the fate of his family. This example radiated all through the fictional attempts to make sense of what you are asking. I have known many elders who surrendered to defeat. It was so moving to see a man who absolutely refused. And don’t forget that people are funny. My brother never forgot, and Big Angel doesn’t forget. So the comedy and the tragedy constantly rub against each other and throw sparks. It’s all about shadow and light. Memory and mortality.\n\nWas it cathartic, writing this book?\n\nYes, it was. I would happily avoid catharsis from now on, but I think I am doomed to plumb personal soul mines. There were places I actually could not write, and my wife typed what I had to say out loud. But those scenes will just be my secret. Ultimately, writing this book brought me comfort, and I hope that it brings comfort to others as well.\n\nALSO IN BOOKPAGE: Read our review of The House of Broken Angels.\n\nPhoto credit Joe Mazza, Brave-Lux\n\nPaula Saunders has been working on some of the material in her wrenching debut novel since she was in graduate school some 30 years ago.\n\n“It was like following little fires around the hills,” Saunders says of her long composition process during a call to her home among the redwoods of the Santa Cruz Mountains. “I followed whatever I could find to make it work. Not blindly, but consciously.”\n\nSet in Rapid City, South Dakota, in the 1960s, The Distance Home tells the story of psychological trauma in a seemingly normal, working-class Midwestern family. Al and Eve marry young and live for a while in his parents’ basement before striking out on their own and starting a family. Al, a cattle trader, is away from home for long stretches of time, and when he returns he vents his frustrations, sometimes brutally, on their oldest child, Leon, a sweet, remarkably sensitive boy and a gifted ballet dancer. René, their daughter, is the golden child. She is lively, successful in school and is also a talented dancer. She develops a deepening sense of how unjustly her brother is being treated and the damage being done to him. Jayne, the youngest, is so young that she seems to escape most, but not all, of the trauma. The novel begins quietly, but in the end is profoundly moving.\n\nLike her character René, Saunders grew up in Rapid City and studied ballet. She later danced as an apprentice with the Harkness Ballet in New York. So, is The Distance Home autobiographical?\n\n“That’s such an interesting question,” Saunders says. “For me it is an autobiographical novel. But for a lot of other people involved, maybe it wouldn’t seem so. I think the invention in the novel comes from trying to draw out a relationship that I have an impression of. I have a deep love and concern for each of these characters, and of course they reflect my family circumstances. I had a brother who passed away early from liver failure, and I have a very dear sister who is still here. A big part of the material for me was trying to understand it and see it more clearly. So I created the circumstances that make sense to me, given the character of the people I knew and the eventualities that occurred.”\n\nAsked about her understanding of the tragic figure of Leon, Saunders says, “There are people who can accept the rules of culture, adapt to them and become good at them, even though the rules often have a raw, jagged edge that is hurtful to others and yourself. But there are people who for one reason or another can’t acquire the rules or find them unacceptable. They suffer in a hidden way. Their feelings lead to some kind of alcoholism or drug addiction because they haven’t found an acceptable way in the culture to express themselves. That’s what I think about the tragedy of Leon. There are people who are very tender and very hurt by our culture. Most people can adapt, but some people can’t.”\n\nA singular pleasure of the novel is Saunders’ depiction of the landscape around Rapid City. “That physical landscape is very much a part of me. I have just loved it. As a child you completely soak in all the things that surround you.”\n\nBut it is a morally complicated geography as well. Subtly, but quite deliberately, Saunders names some of the worst sites of Native American massacres. And some of her minor characters are obvious in their dislike of Indians.\n\n“There are people who are very tender and very hurt by our culture. Most people can adapt, but some people can’t.”\n\n“Well, the book is a lot about inequality and unfairness,” she explains. “And it’s also about violence. There’s violence that happens in the book all the time. To me, there’s no greater violence in this country than the genocide of the American Indians. It’s a horrific thing that we carry with us, that we never acknowledge or apologize for. We just keep consuming and moving to take for ourselves what isn’t necessarily ours, without any thought of who we’re leaving behind. That’s important to me, and that’s why there’s a parallel drawn between Leon and Native Americans.”\n\nSaunders and her husband, George (who published his own debut novel, Lincoln in the Bardo, last year), are longtime practitioners of Buddhism. She says this helped her in working with emotionally fraught material.\n\n“Without that practice, without that kind of new way of looking at it, without cultivating that kind of understanding, I don’t think I could have written it.”\n\nSaunders wrote much of the book on a repurposed dining room table from Home Depot in a tiny room in their house outside of Oneonta, New York. To escape the winters of the Northeast, they later bought a house in California. That’s where she finished working on the novel. “I wish I could say I was writing in a little closet,” she says, laughing. “But I have a dream writing space. We’re up in the redwoods. It’s large. It has windows on three sides, one looking over a vast vista. It’s very calm. I can’t describe how much I love this space.”\n\nSaunders thought she had finished the novel, written then in first person, and sent it to her former teacher Toni Morrison to read. “I hate to claim this, because it’s like wearing clothes that are too big, but I sent it to my great mentor. She read it, and she is not, let us say, reticent with her critique. I was a bit taken aback. I had to go and rethink the main character. I realized that if I moved that character into third person, I had the key to the character. So I went back and wrote the whole book again in third person. That took about a year and a half.”\n\nAfter so much time, the publication of this novel “is really satisfying,” Saunders says. “To have this novel accepted and put forward so that other people can read it and appreciate or understand it in their own way also feels like a big blessing to me.”\n\nThis article was originally published in the August 2018 issue of BookPage.

She now offers her second, a remarkable multigenerational saga called The Vanishing Half. Her storytelling savvy is evident from the opening hook: One of the “lost twins” of Mallard, Louisiana, has returned.\n\nThe lost twins are Stella and Desiree Vignes, who ran away at age 16 in 1954. Fourteen years later, Desiree is back, walking down the road with her “black as tar” daughter, Jude, beside her. Such a detail is of particular interest in Mallard, which was established by its late founder as a place for people “who would never be accepted as white but refused to be treated as Negroes.” He hoped to create a “more perfect Negro,” with each “generation lighter than the one before.”\n\nWhile Desiree’s return causes quite a stir, no one has yet heard from Stella, who turned her back on not only her twin but also the rest of her family and is now passing for white. She married her white boss and lives in California, but neither her husband nor their daughter, Kennedy, has any inkling of Stella’s big secret.\n\n“I wanted to write about passing in a way that wasn’t judgmental. What is it that leads somebody to make this big, dramatic choice?”\n\nAlthough this is not an autobiographical story, the invention of Mallard is inspired by anecdotes from Bennett’s mother, who grew up in Jim Crow Louisiana and spoke of a town whose inhabitants placed extreme importance on skin tones. “I was very curious about what it would be like to grow up in a place that is so insular and also very obsessed with this idea of skin color,” Bennett says, speaking from her home in Brooklyn. She read academic articles about similar towns, but she could never locate the exact place her mother remembered—which intrigued her all the more. “It took on a more mythological feel,” she says.\n\nBennett’s mother inspired The Vanishing Half in other ways as well. Like Desiree, Bennett’s mother worked as an FBI fingerprint examiner in Washington, D.C. And like Stella, she left Louisiana for California, which is where Bennett grew up. But what would her mother’s life have been like if she’d stayed in the South? “Being able to explore both versions of [her] timeline was part of my own kind of selfish curiosity,” Bennett says.\n\nALSO IN BOOKPAGE: Read our review of The Vanishing Half.\n\nThe 1959 movie Imitation of Life was Bennett’s introduction to the idea of passing, which she calls “an interesting and inherently contradictory topic. . . . I remember being so confused as I was watching [the film], like why would somebody do this?” Later, Bennett read Nella Larsen’s powerful 1929 novel, Passing. “I wanted to write about passing in a way that wasn’t judgmental,” she recalls. “What is it that leads somebody to make this big, dramatic choice?”\n\nAnother influence was Elizabeth Greenwood’s book Playing Dead, an entertaining investigation into people who fake their deaths, disappear from their lives or otherwise hit the restart button. “I often fantasize about going somewhere no one knows you,” Bennett admits. “I started to think of Stella’s passing as that type of thing—a kind of psychological death that she initiates in order to divorce herself from this really painful path and to have a chance to create a new life for herself. The idea of death-faking allowed me to think about her emotional state in a way that was a little bit removed from the historical legacy of passing.”\n\nAs the narrative moves from the 1950s to the ’90s, Bennett dissects not only the concept of sisterhood but also the notion of “the sister as a kind of alternate self.” Despite their estrangement, Stella and Desiree share a traumatic memory of their father being lynched by white men, which they witnessed as children through a crack in their closet door. Bennett masterfully explores the idea of inherited trauma and how it might affect the next generation, especially Kennedy, who “has no way to understand or even know what she has inherited.”\n\nThe Vanishing Half is a dazzling examination of how history affects personal decisions, and vice versa. In Bennett’s own life, she says that graduating from college during a recession “allowed me to take this big risk and go to Michigan for my MFA.” When The Mothers was released, she learned an important lesson—that “so much about publishing a book is out of your control.” Of course, such knowledge could hardly prepare her for the fact that The Vanishing Half would be released in the midst of a global pandemic.\n\nBut as a helpful writer friend suggested, “Focus on the things you can control, and the rest, you have to kind of let go.” So that’s what Bennett’s doing: sharing the good news on her poignant new novel. “I just like big stories,” she says. “I like stories that announce themselves as stories.”\n\nAuthor photo by Emma Trim"
