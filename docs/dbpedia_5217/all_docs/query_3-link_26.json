        "text": "Year: 2007\n\nDirector: Rob Zombie\n\nStarring: Malcolm McDowell, Scout Taylor-Compton, Tyler Mane\n\nToday I’ll be looking at what is probably the most divisive entry in the entire Halloween canon. Once upon a time, that title belonged to Season of the Witch, but that one’s reputation has gotten better with time. However, if you find lists ranking all of the Halloween films, Rob Zombie’s 2007 remake will rank anywhere from right near the top to all the way at the bottom. Let’s see why this thing is just so divisive.\n\nThe most famous (or infamous) thing about Rob Zombie’s Halloween is that the first 45 minutes of the film are spent with Michael Myers growing up, killing family members, living at Smith’s Grove Sanitarium, and ultimately escaping. It’s not really a three-act structure as much as a two act structure… or two separate three-act structures. That said, if the movie didn’t do something different, people would complain it was just the same thing and served no purpose. In theory, it could work. In execution… we’ll see.\n\nTen-year old Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) lives in Haddonfield with his mother Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie), sister Judith (Hannah R. Hall), baby sister Angel, and mother’s boyfriend Ronnie (William Forsythe).\n\nIn the 1978 film, we saw just one scene of young Michael Myers as he killed his sister on Halloween night. He seemed to live in a perfectly normal home with middle-class ’60s parents. The fact that a killer like Michael Myers could come from a home like that was jarring and scary. In the classic nature vs. nurture debate, Michael Myers was unquestionably a killer by nature. He was a flesh and blood “boogeyman” who only knew killing.\n\nHere, Michael has such a horrible home life that the line between nature and nurture is blurred. Again, it has to do something different, so I’m perfectly fine with a different look at the character, but the home life is comically over-the-top. Deborah is a stripper, who has to work overtime because Ronnie is on welfare due to an injury that was his own fault, and Judith is a pretty awful sister. Ronnie in particular is such an over-the-top stereotype that he doesn’t even come off like a human being.\n\nLet’s take a look at just a few of Ronnie’s lines in the first few minutes of this film. You can skip ahead if you’re sensitive to strong language or terrible screenwriting.\n\n“I’m all broken up here bitch, I can’t work.”\n\n“Bitch I will crawl over there, and I will skull-fuck the shit out of you.”\n\n(regarding Deborah’s teenage daughter Judith) “Man that bitch got herself a nice little dumper.”\n\n(regarding Michael) He’s gonna grow up and end up cutting his dick and balls off and changing his name to Michelle.\n\nEven Jesse Pinkman thinks this guy says “bitch” too much. As if this isn’t enough, when he shouts so loudly he makes the baby cry, he mocks the baby for doing so and begins to imitate the crying himself. I have no idea why Rob Zombie intended to make the first five minutes of this film the single most unpleasant thing possible, but he succeeded.\n\nHalloween: The Curse of Michael Myers painted John Strode as an abusive father, and I while that was over-the-top, Ronnie takes the cake. At least John Strode was quietly threatening and imposing, as opposed to this joke. Ronnie has no redeeming qualities, he doesn’t have a job, and he’s not the father of any of Deborah’s children. Why does she stay with him?\n\nAt school, some bullies attack Michael, and Michael swears at the principal when he interrupts the fight.\n\nDeborah is called down to the school where the principal introduces her to Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell), a child psychologist. In addition to the multiple issues at school, the principal also found a dead cat and pictures of dead animals in Michael’s backpack, which tips him off that Michael could be going down a bad road. The first time John Carpenter’s iconic Halloween theme plays is during this scene as Michael runs out of the meeting, grabs his bag and clown mask, and goes to kill one of the bullies on his way home.\n\nWhy does the music play at this bizarre moment? Why does no one notice Michael leaving the meeting? It’s never answered.\n\nThat night, Judith promises Deborah she’ll take Michael trick-or-treating, but the second Deborah leaves, Judith goes upstairs with her boyfriend.\n\nLook, I know the year in which this takes place is meant to be somewhat ambiguous (the original film took place in 1978, and Michael killed his sister in 1963), but blurring the line by having a picture on the wall of a President who is vaguely Kennedy or Reagan is kind of hilarious. Also, what’s with Judith’s boyfriend? Does everyone in this movie have to look like Rob Zombie?\n\nAlright, it’s time for a Zombie speed round. Let’s count every character with long hair and a beard.\n\n1. Ronnie\n\n2. Young Dr. Loomis\n\n3. Judith’s Boyfriend\n\n4. Adult Michael\n\n5. Lynda’s Boyfriend\n\nAnyway, as his mother is out working, Michael mopes outside as “Love Hurts” plays on the soundtrack for… some reason.\n\nIt truly feels like there was just the regular score playing over this scene and some YouTuber added this as a joke, but it’s the real scene. Meanwhile Judith and Long Hair/Beard #3 are having sex upstairs, during which he insists on wearing a white mask that will ultimately become the iconic Michael Myers mask. OK… is this guy just into weird Captain Kirk roleplay? I don’t get it. Also, Long Hair/Beard #3 assumes Ronnie is Judith’s dad, to which she responds “My daddy’s in heaven, OK?” like she’s six years old or something.\n\nMichael then proceeds to kill Ronnie, Judith and Long Hair/Beard #3. It’s not scary, and I think Rob Zombie was intentionally trying to make these characters unlikable so we wouldn’t feel so bad when they died. As with the unlikable characters in Resurrection and Curse, I just can’t understand this thinking. How about a scary scene? How about likable characters who we feel for when they die? If you make a character this unlikable, we all know you’re not going to let them survive the movie, and it makes it predictable and unscary.\n\nA lot of people took issue with little Michael wearing the oversized white mask when he kills Judith, and I agree that it looks silly.\n\nHowever, I think that’s the point. Rob Zombie knows our expectations of this character, and he’s trying to show that this kid is too young to be the iconic monster we all know. He’s stepping into something he’s not ready for. Now, I’m not sure the movie effectively proves this, but I think it’s the symbolism he’s going for.\n\nOnce Michael is locked up in Smith’s Grove, he begins to meet with Dr. Loomis on a regular basis. I feel like this movie doesn’t really have a grasp on who it wants Dr. Loomis to be. One on hand, he’s very similar to the Donald Pleasence original who knew the evil that lived inside Michael and did everything in his power to protect others from him. On the other, he seems a lot more self-centered, and during his last meeting with an adult Michael, he basically says “Well I’m done now” and goes off to sell his book. I’m not sure if it’s McDowell’s performance or the writing or both, but he seems pretty inconsistent.\n\nHowever, most of the acting in this movie is really not the problem. Despite the weird characterization, I do see the coldness in Daeg Faerch’s performance as young Michael, and Sheri Moon Zombie is fantastic as his mother, especially in her scenes following him being institutionalized. When Michael kills a nurse and stops talking to anyone, it leads to Deborah’s tragic breakdown, ending in her suicide. Her acting is good enough that it even makes the old cliche of “old home movies of when times were good” authentic.\n\nFifteen years later, Michael (Tyler Mane) has grown insanely tall and is constantly making masks in his spare time. While it obviously seems bizarre that a grown man is wearing Halloween masks all the time, Zombie is probably going for the whole “Wearing masks to escape reality” symbolism.\n\nPretty much every employee at Smith’s Grove is horrible to the patients, constantly abusing them verbally and physically (It’s sexual too in the director’s cut). Again, this seems to be an attempt to make us not feel bad when Michael kills them all and breaks free. However, he even kills the one employee who was ever nice to him, a janitor played by Danny Trejo.\n\nThe kill scenes in this film are just not scary. They’re overdone with shaky cam and excessive amounts of blood, but there’s no real tension or terror. Michael is just a big hulking monster who beats people to a pulp. Even later when he stabs people instead, the effect is the same. Again, it’s a remake and you have to do something different, but why is “being scary” one of the things you’d change?\n\nOne thing this version changes about Michael is his ability to drive. Personally, I always found it somewhat creepy that Michael knew how to drive despite never learning, or at least I always loved Donald Pleasence’s reaction to it. That said, it doesn’t make technical sense, so I understand wanting to drop that angle. However, it is still made clear that Haddonfield is not within walking distance of Smith’s Grove, so the ground covered still makes no sense!\n\nFirst up, Michael stops at a truck stop and kills a trucker for his clothes.\n\nKen Foree at least manages to turn in a memorable performance as the over-the-top Big Joe Grizzly, even socking Michael in the face once. That aside, this is easily one of the grossest scenes in any Halloween film. This guy is looking at a porno magazine on a toilet at a truck stop restroom… because that’s a good combination. He then sees Michael’s disgusting feet underneath the bathroom door and they get into a bloody fight. It’s almost as unpleasant as any scene with Ronnie.\n\nThe rest of the film plays out very similarly to the original Halloween, so I’m not gonna break it down on a scene-by-scene basis. Instead, let’s take a look at what works and what doesn’t. First of all, the three teenage girls at the center of the story—Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton), Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris) and Lynda Van Der Klok (Kristina Klebe)—feel a bit more like teenagers than the obvious adults in the original film. I understand that the latter two actresses were actually well out of their teens, but they do look younger.\n\nWhile the dialogue in the original film felt more authentic and age-appropriate, at least the characters here look the part. Lynda is a pretty awful character this time around, but it is nice to have Danielle Harris back in the Halloween series, even if the Annie character is only so-so. Laurie Strode is not as naive as in the original film, but she’s still a very likable character, especially in the scenes where she’s babysitting Tommy Doyle and Lindsay Wallace. Sure, she has a bit of a dirtier mind than the original, but again, if you changed nothing, you’d get complaints from fans too. I still like the character. Scout Taylor-Compton doesn’t have as much to work with as Jamie Lee Curtis did, especially in the final act, but she still gives it her all.\n\nOK enough of being nice…now for something that doesn’t work. There is a small scene about halfway through this movie that should be a nothing little scene but comes off as hilarious due to one awful performance. Dr. Loomis is walking through a cemetery with the groundskeeper (Sid Haig) when they discover that a grave has been stolen and a dead animal is there in its place.\n\nIt’s a simple exposition to showthat Michael Myers has returned, but Sid Haig’s performance is so over-the-top that it ruins the scene. He swears up a storm and starts stomping around like a tantrum-throwing child when he sees what has happened. Dude, have you never seen a prank before? Calm down.\n\nAlright, it’s time to talk about by far the best thing in this movie—Brad Dourif as Sheriff Lee Brackett.\n\nHonestly, he’s not even in all that many scenes, but Dourif still manages to create a three-dimensional, tough but likable character. Sure, he’s a bit more hesitant to trust Loomis than in the original, but that does seem justified here. Loomis seems to be a bit of a sell-out in this version, and it doesn’t seem that Michael’s murder of Joe Grizzly has made the news yet. Even though Michael has escaped from Smith’s Grove, it’s not within walking distance.\n\nBrackett is actually given more characterization than in the original, as he is the only one in town who knows the truth that Laurie is in fact Michael Myers’ sister. He was on the scene the night Deborah Myers killed herself, and he dropped the baby at an emergency room a few towns over.\n\nHowever, it turns out that Brackett’s friends the Strodes adopted the baby anyway. It’s a tad convoluted, but it leads to Brackett having a bit of a guilt complex, which makes him more interesting. Honestly, there are only two emotional moments in the film. The first is Deborah’s suicide, and the second is Brackett comforting his daughter Annie who has been badly wounded by Michael. It’s a heartbreaking scene that really comes off as jarring in a film that’s all loud noises and over-the-top kills.\n\nYou want to know what would have been bold? You really want to do something different in the remake? Make Brackett the main character! Yeah, Brad Dourif has the acting chops for it, and it sure would have been different. He already has a guilt complex, and if it was more about his personal struggle, the movie would have been grounded with a likable character. As it is, the film can’t pick a main character. I guess the closest we get is Michael… which is kind of a disturbing thought. It was Laurie in the original, but she’s only in the second half of the film, so it can’t be her.\n\nThe climax of the film feels like it lasts forever, and it’s not even scary once. Michael takes an injured Laurie back to their old house and tries to explain (without speaking of course) that he’s her brother.\n\nShe tries to escape, and he tries to kill her, and it goes on for way too long until Dr. Loomis shows up. Loomis tries to get to Michael by saying “Michael, it’s me Samuel,” even though he has never referred to himself as Samuel in the movie up until this point. Michael is probably more confused than anything. Loomis can’t stop him with words and eventually shoots him over and over.\n\nWhen Loomis and Laurie get to a car, Michael attacks again and Loomis lets out a “What the hell?” that sounds more like he was reacting to this cliched plot point than his life being in danger.\n\nMichael kills or injures Loomis (He’s back in the sequel so I guess it’s injures) and chases Laurie again forever.\n\nShe eventually does shoot him in the face, killing him (I mean, he’s back in the sequel too), ending a painfully long final act on a sigh of relief because at least it’s over.\n\nRob Zombie’s Halloween is not a good remake, but even if we knew nothing of the original John Carpenter masterpiece, it wouldn’t even be a good film. There are good moments, sure, but it’s disjointed, goofy, and seems to enjoy the combination of nudity and blood on a disturbing level (Resurrection did some of the same). I like that it does a few things different like having Annie survive and giving Sheriff Brackett more characterization, but these are small things in the course of it all. It honestly ends up being the only remake I can think of that both changes way too much (Myers’ characterization in the first half) and changes too little (the entirety of the second half). Let’s check out the final score.\n\nStory (8/25 Points)\n\nIt tries some new stuff, and it kind of retreads the classic Halloween, but it doesn’t really do all that much that’s interesting, and the ending goes on forever.\n\nCharacters (15/25 Points)\n\nBrad Dourif turns in a fantastic performance as Brackett, and I like both Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie and Danielle Harris as Annie, even if their writing isn’t always on point. Sheri Moon Zombie is also a highlight as Michael’s mother, but the rest of the characters are pretty annoying, and the hulking mass that is Michael Myers here isn’t all that scary. Ronnie is easily one of the worst characters in the entire franchise.\n\nExperience (4/25 Points)\n\nIt’s loud, bloody, disgusting, overly-sexualized, and not scary. At least it uses the original Halloween music.\n\nOriginality (10/25 Points)\n\nIt tries… stuff in the first half. The second half doesn’t really try much, though. I guess it gets some points here.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 37%\n\nIt’s not without its merits, but this is a pretty disappointing remake. If you want to see it, you’ll enjoy the occasional thing that works, but you’ll be pretty sick of it all by the ending.\n\nSomehow this got a sequel, which I’ll be looking at next week.\n\nMATCH-UP HOME\n\nHOME\n\nYear: 2002\n\nDirector: Rick Rosenthal\n\nStarring: Busta Rhymes, Bianca Kajlich, Katee Sackhoff\n\nI don’t want to talk about Halloween: Resurrection. No one wants to talk about Halloween: Resurrection. Say what you will about Halloween H20 (And I said a lot), but it had a satisfying and conclusive ending. Unless they were going to go the way of Season of the Witch again, the producers behind the Halloween series knew the mere concept of another Michael Myers sequel would anger the people who liked the ending of H20.\n\nThat said, I was pretty upset that Halloween 5 didn’t properly follow up on the ending of Halloween 4, and yet I still really enjoyed it. As with every film I watch, I had to put aside all the bashing I’d heard about Halloween: Resurrection over the years and go in with an open mind.\n\nI’ll start with something positive. The version of the Halloween theme that plays over the opening credits and throughout the film is far better than the overproduced shlock of H20. It’s essentially the original piano theme with some creepy ambient noises in the background, and it really works. We then get some really bizarre pseudo-philosophic narration from Jamie Lee Curtis that has no bearing on the rest of the film.\n\nYou’ve heard of the tunnel, the one we all go through sooner or later. At the end there’s a door, and waiting for you on the other side of that door is either Heaven or Hell. This is that door.\n\nThis narration plays over the camera zooming in on Laurie Strode’s room at a mental institution, but what does it have to do with anything?\n\nAlright, so why is Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), the heroic final girl who finally killed Michael Myers, in a mental institution you ask? Because she killed the wrong guy. Yep! We get a full scene in which two nurses discuss what really happened at the end of the last film, because that’s the only way to get around bringing your villain back after he’s been decapitated.\n\nIt turns out Michael Myers strangled a paramedic and forced him into his clothes and mask.\n\nBut wait, why did the paramedic not speak and tell Laurie who he was? Oh don’t worry, the other nurse asks that too. The movie knows how stupid this twist is, so it literally has to have its characters ask the questions it knows the audience and critics would. It’s like they knew I was going to have a question round after watching this, so they answered this one for me. Turns out Michael crushed Jim the Mustached Paramedic’s voice box so he couldn’t speak. That’s all the more the nurse explains though, so despite this movie’s attempt to stop me, I’ve got some questions.\n\nWhy did Jim the Mustached Paramedic attack Laurie Strode while she was driving? Why didn’t he wait until they got to the morgue and try to explain it all?\n\nWhy didn’t Jim the Mustached Paramedic take the mask off at any point? Laurie knew what her brother looked like (he took the mask off in Halloween), and she knew he was burned in Halloween II. Michael Myers didn’t break Jim’s arms.\n\nHow did Jim the Mustached Paramedic survive being thrown through the front windshield of the van?\n\nHow did Jim the Mustached Paramedic survive being hit with the van? How was he strong enough to climb up onto the van?\n\nWhy didn’t he just try to run away? Why would he keep making it look like he’s trying to kill her? Was Jim the Mustached Paramedic mad at Laurie for making him work on his day off or something?\n\nI mean, there’s an easy answer to all of these questions: He was Michael Myers, which he of course was in H20. Now we have to screw up the continuity to pump out another sequel, so there you have it. It was Jim the Mustached Paramedic.\n\nSo did the police try to find the real Michael Myers after the events of H20? Or did they just assume that Jim the Mustached Paramedic was the real killer? With all the shoehorned exposition in this movie, I’d like to know this much. Are the cops still on the lookout for the real killer? Even if Laurie isn’t of a sound mind, obviously her son John and his girlfriend Molly had some idea that the real Michael Myers had returned. Sorry, I’m making up a plot far more interesting than the one of this movie.\n\nMichael Myers (Brad Loree) of course does finally show up and chases Laurie through the hospital, and she leads him right up to her trap on the roof. He falls right into it, and as he’s dangling by his feet over the edge of the roof, she prepares to cut the rope and kill him.\n\nHowever, knowing what happened before, she insists on taking his mask off. Who knows? It could be Jim the Mustached Paramedic’s brother bent on revenge or something. Also, with all the insane things Michael has survived (even just in this continuity), why does she think a fall from the roof will kill him?\n\nAnyway, she walks forward to take the mask off to assure herself it’s Michael this time. Of course, Michael takes advantage of the situation and stabs her and throws her off the roof.\n\nShe says “I’ll see you in hell” to somehow try to tie it into that gibberish narration, and unsuccessfully tries to take Michael down with her as she dies.\n\nBefore leaving the mental hospital, Michael stops by the room of a guy who seems to be obsessed with serial killers and leaves his knife with him, because that will never be evidence or anything.\n\nSerial killers do tend to stick around the place they just killed somebody, right? Maybe it’s to frame him or something? However, this guy really doesn’t know too much about serial killers at all. He says that Michael Myers killed 4 students at Hillcrest Academy in 1998. Um… no he didn’t. Let’s check out the body count from Halloween H20 again. Michael killed Marion Chambers and those two kids in Illinois at the beginning. Then he went to California and killed Charlie, Sarah, and Will, the guidance counselor. Those were the only victims, unless you count Jim the Mustached Paramedic, who was obviously not a student either. Only two of those were Hillcrest Students! Where is this crazed fan getting his facts from? Again, it feels like no one on the production team had ever seen a Halloween film.\n\nSo we’re 15 minutes in and we’ve killed off the main character of the last film, so where do we go now? Some college somewhere where a bunch of kids are auditioning for a new internet reality show.\n\nThat whole prologue had nothing to do with the movie except to have Myers return and kill off Laurie Strode. Look, I know Jamie Lee Curtis insisted on it just so she’d never have to return to the franchise (until 2018 where she willingly is returning again), but it’s insulting to the character and superfluous to the overall story. We never hear about her son or his girlfriend again, and we just meet a whole new cast of pointless characters. Every Halloween film gave us characters we cared about, and while they were often related in one way or another to Michael, there were also non-related characters who carried over from film-to-film like Loomis, Rachel, and Ben Meeker. Here we’re just setting up a pointless slasher film that happens to have Michael Myers in it.\n\nThe hero of Halloween: Resurrection, if you don’t count the theatres that pulled it early, is Sarah, an emotionless lifeform played by Bianca Kajlich.\n\nI’m honestly really trying to think of one characteristic of her worth mentioning. In her opening scene, we see her in a huge college class where she mumbles an answer to herself. Somehow, the professor hears her all the way in the front and praises her. Perhaps she has a voice that carries extremely well, maybe her professor has amazing hearing, or maybe the director doesn’t know how sound works. Who directed this thing anyway?\n\nRICK ROSENTHAL? The same director who gave us Halloween II returns after all this time? Well… alright then.\n\nSarah has been cast in the all-new internet reality show Dangertainment along with her friends Rudy (Sean Patrick Thomas) and Jen (Katee Sackhoff).\n\nThe show is created by Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes) and his producer (Tyra Banks), and the first episode will involve six college students entering the old Myers house on Halloween night.\n\nJen wants to be famous and will do anything to get on camera, and Rudy believes Hitler was a monster because he was a vegetarian, so we’re pretty far from interesting and original characters. Frankly, I’d be concerned about a reality show where of the six contestants, three are friends from the same college! Maybe there’s a reason no one’s trying out for this show. Sarah also screams so loudly during pre-production of Dangertainment that she literally shatters glass.\n\nIronically, Bianca Kajlich was unable to scream during the production of Halloween: Resurrection, and her screams had to be dubbed in post. Remind me again why she was cast in this thing!\n\nThis movie just doesn’t care about its characters, from the writing to the performances. Say what you will about Busta Rhymes being in this movie, but at least it seems like he wants to be in it! Joining the three friends are Jim (Luke Kirby), an obvious sexual predator, Bill, who isn’t much better, and Donna (Daisy McCrackin), a pretentious intellectual-type who almost becomes an interesting character.\n\nHowever, despite Daisy McCrackin’s attempts to make Donna likable and believable, the script insists on her having sex with Sexual Predator Jim after telling him off time and time again (I must call him this to avoid confusion with Jim the Mustached Paramedic… R.I.P.). That makes sense. Jim is also a complete idiot while she’s intelligent, because why should women have standards?\n\nIn an attempt to keep up with Sexual Predator Jim, Bill keeps insisting Jen takes her top off so she’ll be famous, and even Rudy makes one or two disgusting comments about the women. In fact, in an interesting turn of events, the only primary male character who isn’t a creep is the exploitative producer. Well that’s interesting. Who could have possibly produced this thing?\n\nObviously, Freddie and the production team don’t actually know Michael Myers is alive, and they insist that the cast snoop around the house to try and find clues as to what made Michael Myers evil. Freddie dresses in a Michael Myers costume to scare the college kids, but of course, the real one shows up in the same scene.\n\nI guess it’s trying to be funny? It’s not. If it’s trying to be scary, it absolutely isn’t.\n\nOf course, the cast members get killed in various ridiculous ways. A cameraman is actually the first to go, but once the show proper starts, Bill gets a knife to the head, followed by Donna getting impaled on a spike. The film focuses on gory shots for a disturbing amount of time, which is in direct contrast to the jumpy editing of the rest of the film. It seems to me that the director likes the gore a bit too much. Donna’s death is a particularly insulting case of this, as the shot lingers on the spike through her stomach, then on her lifeless face, and then zooms out from behind for way too long. It really makes me uncomfortable, and not in a good way.\n\nDonna’s death really starts to concern Sarah’s online boyfriend “Deckard” (Ryan Merriman) who is watching from a Halloween party. While everyone else thinks the killings are staged, he’s convinced they’re real.\n\nIt turns out that Michael Myers has actually been living in an expanded basement under his old house for twenty years, which is the one important thing the cast members actually find out. Deckard sends Sarah messages on her palm pilot about Michael Myers’ location based on the other cameras in the house, because what’s more exciting than a chase directed by text message?\n\nIn the most ridiculous death in the film and possibly the entire series, Michael Myers walks right up to Jen who’s standing at the top of the staircase. She just stands there, almost like she’s posing, as he takes a butcher knife and cuts her head clean off.\n\nI am neither a physicist or a biologist, but I’m pretty sure this scene doesn’t make any scientific sense. You cannot cut someone’s head clean off with a butcher knife. That aside, there’s no blood spurting out even when he does. Even that aside, he cuts her neck from side to side, and yet her head rolls forward down the stairs! (I’m refraining from showing images of the more disgusting moments in the film, as the director is clearly getting off to this, and I will not indulge him.)\n\nThe other deaths are pretty dumb too, as Rudy gets hoisted onto a door with multiple knives (Sure, but you only need one knife to decapitate), and Sexual Predator Jim gets his head… squeezed to death I think.\n\nThis leaves just Freddie and Sarah who try to outrun Michael, and Freddie temporarily stops Michael by using kung-fu moves he learned from old movies. I mean, it’s dumb, but who cares at this point?\n\nEventually, Freddie seems to kill Michael Myers by electrocuting him and burning the house down, because fire will totally kill Michael Myers, just like it did in Halloween II.\n\nSarah escapes and thanks her online boyfriend on live TV, still showing absolutely no emotion whatsoever. In the film’s final scene, Michael Myers awakens in the morgue, because we can’t even attempt closure. The End.\n\nYou know what the worst thing about Halloween: Resurrection is? It’s not the idiotic characters, insulting prologue, entire absence of anything scary, stupid dialogue, or totally ridiculous Busta Rhymes performance. It’s just boring. It just sets up some characters to die, and they do. It’s the most generic, paint-by-numbers slasher imaginable. There’s nothing that really makes this feel like a Halloween film after the first few minutes, and we have no personal connection to anyone or anything after Laurie Strode is killed off. It is a chore to sit through. Let’s check out the final score.\n\nStory (6/25 Points)\n\nIf this wasn’t a Halloween movie, the idea of an internet reality show gone haywire could have been smart, interesting, and scary. Instead, it’s none of those things.\n\nCharacters (3/25 Points)\n\nThe absolute worst cast of characters in a Halloween film yet. There’s not a single character in the main portion of the film that’s entirely likable, but I guess the closest is Donna. At least Daisy McCrackin is trying, and for better or worse, so is Busta Rhymes. The prologue is also a slap in the face to H20 and the Laurie Strode character, despite the fact that we get more Jamie Lee Curtis. I guess Michael Myers is a tad more intimidating this time around, but I’m grasping at straws here.\n\nExperience (6/25 Points)\n\nThe music is better at least. The film is a tad atmospheric, but it’s not scary even once, and the deaths are horribly overdone.\n\nOriginality (2/25 Points)\n\nNot much going for it in this department. Change the name of “Michael Myers” and you’ve got pretty much any forgettable slasher flick.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 17%\n\nI mean, it’s better than the theatrical cut of Curse of Michael Myers simply on the basis of being an actual movie, but there’s no real reason to see this. Since this continuity ended after the universal hatedom of Resurrection, most fans don’t count this one at all and consider H20 the definitive conclusion.\n\nNext week, I’ll be look at Rob Zombie’s 2007 remake of Halloween.\n\nMATCH-UP HOME\n\nHOME\n\nYear: 1998\n\nDirector: Steve Miner\n\nStarring: Jamie Lee Curtis, Josh Hartnett, Michelle Williams\n\nAfter the confusing and disastrous theatrical cut of Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers, the producers behind Halloween decided it was time to give the fans what they wanted—a stripped down story, Michael Myers as the only villain, and Jamie Lee Curtis returning to the franchise. It’s that last element that is the major hook of Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, as Jamie Lee Curtis hadn’t been in the franchise or even a horror movie since 1981.\n\nWhat’s with that title? Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later? It’s like three different people submitted titles and they just threw them all together! Why would they pick something that sounds so much like the chemical formula for water? I’ve heard some viewers joke that they thought this was going to be Michael Myers meets Jaws. Why do you need “Halloween” and the letter H in the title? What else does the H stand for?\n\nThe utter failure of Halloween 6 is far from the only reason that H20 was made. In 1996, a little film called Scream came out, which both made fun of the dying slasher genre, while also being a refreshingly smart slasher film.\n\nScream existed in a world where both the killer and victims knew horror movies tropes and acted accordingly, and it was such a hit that the imitators quickly flooded in. Now that the slasher was back, Halloween jumped back into the game, even hiring Scream screenwriter Kevin Williamson as a producer and uncredited script doctor. Although the original script existed in the same universe as Halloween 4, 5, and 6, it was ultimately decided that Halloween H20 would be a reboot, picking up in a world where only the first two films exist. This is ultimately for the best, because we don’t want a hero who took her son with her while abandoning her daughter.\n\nThe obvious Scream inspiration starts right off the bat with the opening kill. The concept of the opening kill dates back to the earliest days of horror of course, but Scream has perhaps the most famous one this side of Jaws. I’m not opposed to this kind of scene in theory (the two films I just mentioned do it brilliantly), because it’s an attempt to establish the threat of the villain from the get-go. However, for this to be effective in a horror film, the scene still has to be both scary and shocking. In 1996, Scream audiences saw Drew Barrymore on screen and figured she’d be the film’s heroine, so when she got killed off in a very scary scene, it both established the threat of the killer and told the audience to throw away any expectations they had going in.\n\nNow what character does Halloween H20 (I am not calling it by its full name every time) follows in its opening scene? Nurse Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens), who finds her house broken into.\n\nRemember her? She was in the first two Halloween films, but she only appeared in a few scenes collectively. Even if you do remember Marion 20 years later, a minor character appearing in the film’s opening scene is the immediate tip-off that she’s about to bite it. Wave goodbye to suspense.\n\nI mean, the scene attempts to build up suspense, but it just falls flat and turns into a joke. After the cops are called, one of the neighbor boys (Joseph Gordon-Levitt in an early performance) checks the house.\n\nThere are some fake out scares, but no one seems to be in the house. We also get some of the score from Scream in this and other scenes, because I don’t know. People liked that movie so here’s some music from it? The editor hit the wrong button? I hate this thing already.\n\nMarion returns to her home and finds that the file on Laurie Strode has been stolen. If this file was so secretive and important, why did she have it in her room labeled as “Laurie Strode?” She realizes the implications of the file being gone and runs back over to the neighbor boys’ home, but finds them both dead. Gordon-Levitt’s character has been killed by an ice skate to the face, because I’m sure that’s a super quick and efficient way to kill someone. Anyway, Michael Myers appears and kills her too. As he’s doing this, the cops of course show up at her house and find nothing.\n\nYou could play that goofy clown music from Halloween 5 over this scene and it would be more appropriate. Anyway, Michael drives away in Marion’s car before the cops can piece together what’s going on.\n\nOver the opening credits, we hear Dr. Loomis’ monologue from the first film about Michael Myers having “The Devil’s eyes,” but even though it’s the exact same words being spoken, they’re read by voice actor Tom Kane, instead of just playing the clip from the original.\n\nKane tries to sound like Donald Pleasence, but he just doesn’t. No one can communicate the perfect inflection in the great actor’s voice or the heart he poured into every word. The score that plays over this scene barely resembles the original Halloween theme, because it’s been covered up by string flourishes and overproduction.\n\nIt turns out that Marion Chambers was housing Dr. Loomis in his last years before his death, and we learn through newspaper clippings in his room that Laurie Strode faked her death to escape Michael. The clippings are mostly better than the ones Tommy Doyle had in his room, but there is this one that spells Michael’s last name wrong. Maybe this is intentional? I’m not sure.\n\nAlright, let’s see who wrote this thing.\n\nROBERT ZAPPIA? There’s no way. The same guy who gave us Christmas is Here Again? The guy who thinks “riches” rhymes with “St. Nicholas.” Say it ain’t so.\n\nIs that… supposed to rhyme? This guy has one of the strangest careers I’ve ever seen.\n\nAn episode of Home Improvement, a Christmas special and a slasher sequel? Maybe this is an alias and they just picked a generic head shot?\n\nWell let’s see what Robert Zappia has created for us. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is now living in California as Kerri Tate, where she’s the headmistress of a private boarding school. She’s divorced and lives with her son John (Josh Hartnett), who is a senior at the school. Haunted by events from 20 years ago, Laurie suffers from pretty serious PTSD, and also struggles with alcoholism (something Jamie Lee Curtis has been very public about in real life).\n\nIn concept, this is exactly where I believe this character would be 20 years later. She still struggles with her past, but she’s doing everything possible to live her best life. Her relationship with her son is difficult at points, but it’s undeniably a good one, because they understand each other. He helps her with her nightmares, and when she wants to get upset with him for a sardonic comment, she acknowledges he gets his sarcasm from her.\n\nUnfortunately, the execution of this set-up is pretty hit-or-miss. Laurie’s PTSD mainly plays out one way… over and over.\n\nLaurie thinks she sees Michael coming towards her.\n\nMichael comes closer and Laurie gets scared.\n\nIt’s revealed to be someone else.\n\nJump scare sound effect.\n\nLaurie is scared and the person apologizes.\n\nThe stock “jump scare sound effect” is so overused in this film, and it’s all for fake out scares. It’s like “The Boy Who Cried Wolf,” and by the time the “wolf” shows up in this situation, he’s not even that scary. I know this whole fake out scare trend was huge in the 90s, and while it was overused in the Scream series, it’s painful here.\n\nThat aside, is that really the best you can do with PTSD? Taking a serious, real life issue of a great character and exploiting it for a stock horror cliche? This could have been an interesting psychological study of a character who’s survived tragedy (See Scream 2), but we barely get any of that. Jamie Lee Curtis is back, and that’s fantastic. The movie is way better when she’s on screen than when she isn’t. Unfortunately, there just aren’t a lot of moments for her acting to shine.\n\nAs for the other characters… they’re in the movie. Michelle Williams plays John’s girlfriend Molly, who seems like a perfectly nice person, and there doesn’t really seem to be any conflict between them, which is refreshing.\n\nThey’re friends with another teenage couple Sarah (Jodi Lynn O’ Keefe) and Charlie (Adam Hann-Byrd), who only exist as obvious Michael Myers-fodder. They don’t really have much character outside of liking to eat.\n\nAdam Arkin plays school guidance counselor Will Brennan, who is secretly dating Laurie, although he only knows her as Kerri.\n\nHe comes off as somewhat kind at first, but ends up seeming pretty selfish in later scenes. Honestly, I’m not sure if the movie intended him to come off this way or not, but he does. In his worst moment, Laurie is in bed revealing her life story to him, and he thinks it’s some kind of role play. He thinks Laurie has problems, but he considers “My brother killed my sister and wants to kill me” dirty talk? This guy is a guidance counselor?\n\nWe also get LL Cool J as a security guard who is constantly on the phone, reading his newly-written erotica to his wife. I guess this is funny to some people? It just feels like a knock-off Scream character. In the film’s most painfully awkward scene, we also get a cameo by Janet Leigh as Laurie’s secretary.\n\nLet’s see how many terrible in-jokes and references we can make to Psycho, the original Halloween and everything else. Ready?\n\nJanet Leigh’s character is called Norma.\n\nShe says “It’s Halloween. I guess everyone is entitled to one good scare,” which is a direct quote from Sheriff Brackett in the original Halloween.\n\nShe says “If I could be maternal for a moment.” Get it? It’s her mother!\n\nJanet Leigh drives the exact same model of car she drove in Psycho.\n\nAs she walks to the car, the score from Psycho plays.\n\nThis all happens in the course of 90 seconds! The only purpose of having Janet Leigh in this film is for a speed round of pop culture references. I guess the joke’s on them when it’s revealed in the sequel that she drove off with $40,000 and never came back.\n\nOnce the majority of the students have left the school for a weekend trip, the only people left on campus are John and his friends, Will, Laurie, and LL Cool J (his character has a name I think, but who cares?). This if of course when Michael Myers (Chris Durand) shows up. Remember how unscary he was in 4 and 6? Take a look at this.\n\nWhat’s with that mask? The eye holes are huge! Why not just show his whole face? That’s not scary. As if that mask wasn’t bad enough, it changes often throughout the film. In one scene, we even get an obvious CGI mask!\n\nMichael quickly disposes of Charlie, followed by Sarah not long after. I’ll admit that Sarah discovering Charlie’s body is the only kind of scary moment in the entire movie.\n\nAt least Sarah has the only death-by-dumbwaiter that I’m aware of… at least in a Halloween film. I haven’t seen every slasher ever made.\n\nLaurie, Will, John and Molly run through the halls trying to survive, and when Michael Myers approaches, Will shoots him. However, it’s revealed this was just another hallucination and it was LL Cool J. What? So Will has the same PTSD Laurie has now? That makes no sense. The room is lit well enough for him to tell the different between a black guy and a dude in a pasty white mask! Is he just secretly racist?\n\nWhen Will walks up to the body, Michael Myers of course actually attacks and kills him.\n\nLaurie, John and Molly make their escape, but as they’re about to drive away from the grounds, Laurie tells them to get to safety. She locks herself in, knowing she has to face Michael alone. She grabs an emergency ax and begins shouting Michael’s name as the Halloween theme plays. It’s probably the first atmospheric moment in the whole film, and I love it.\n\nShe and Michael of course have their fight that everyone bought their ticket to see, and while he does stab her once, she ends up just railing on him, eventually stabbing him and tossing him off a balcony.\n\nWhen she goes to deliver the crushing blow, LL Cool J pops up alive (Don’t call it a comeback… sorry) and insists that Michael is dead, even though we all know he can’t be.\n\nThis isn’t the end though. As the ambulances and hearses come, Laurie holds the hearse driver at gun point, kicks him out, and begins to drive the van herself!\n\nShe constantly looks in the rear view mirror, knowing Michael will wake up at any moment. I’m not sure this is the most practical way to go about things, but I guess she figured she’d have been stopped if she tried to kill him with everyone present.\n\nWhen he inevitably wakes up, Laurie slams on the breaks and throws him through the front windshield. She then attempts to run him over, but he jumps onto the van, causing it to crash and roll down a hill, leaving Michael stuck between the van and a tree branch.\n\nHe reaches out to Laurie, and just when it looks like she might fall victim to a tender moment, she cuts off his head!\n\nThe Halloween theme plays, and the movie’s over. It is an immensely satisfying scene, on the level of Brody killing the shark in Jaws or the capture of Max Cady in Cape Fear. I have to admit that despite the lackluster buildup, the movie does give us what we want. I can’t fault it there.\n\nUltimately though, Halloween H20 is a pretty underwhelming film. Take a look at the pacing, for example. The film is just 85 minutes long. Knock off the five minutes of credits and you’re down to 80 minutes. Knock off the ten minute prologue and you’re down to 70 minutes. Take away the 3 minute opening credits sequence and we’re down to just 67 minutes of our main story. Now, I have no issue with an extended prologue or credits, but why couldn’t this movie be longer? This is barely an hour with our main characters, and even then, Jamie Lee Curtis isn’t in all of it! The film is essentially coasting on its premise the entire time.\n\nIn the original Halloween, we got an unsettling, borderline voyeuristic, look into the character’s lives. We often followed the perspective of the killer, and it was unsettling. The kills felt real, and the emotions were authentic. Halloween H20 feels like a slick studio product, with committees voting on how long we linger on every shot. None of the deaths are felt, which makes no sense, because John loses two of his best friends and doesn’t seem too broken up by it, and Laurie loses her boyfriend and reacts similarly. I would be fine if this was a kind of fight-or-flight instinct, but we don’t even get a second of grief or terror from them. This thing just doesn’t feel real.\n\nThe inauthenticity of H20 is solidified in the film’s most confusing scene. Sarah and Molly are in their dorm room when Will checks in on them, but take a look at what they’re watching on TV.\n\nSCREAM 2!?! Alright, despite their clearly inspired tastes, let’s really break this down. There is no logical way that characters in a Halloween film could watch a Scream film. Not only does the first Scream film directly reference Halloween, the characters even watch Halloween in it! This scene in H20 could not exist. I’m sorry, I know this is just a quick one-off scene, but it totally destroys my suspension of disbelief.\n\nIt’s this scene that ultimately sums up the experience of H20 for me. I’m watching something that isn’t real. The creators don’t really care if everything lines up, as long as it checks all the boxes. Let’s take a look at the final score.\n\nStory (15/25 Points)\n\nOn paper, this feels like something that really could work. Unfortunately, it never follows through entirely on its great setup. The last act does deliver, though.\n\nCharacters (19/25 Points)\n\nJamie Lee Curtis is back, which gives this a high score to begin with. She is fantastic every moment she’s on screen, and I think Josh Hartnett as her son is great, but underused. I’ll give it credit for having no characters I outright hate.\n\nExperience (4/25 Points)\n\nThere’s just one atmospheric moment. The score is overblown, often using music from Scream for some reason, and the jump scares are awful. This is really what ruins it.\n\nOriginality (8/25 Points)\n\nIt doesn’t really do anything new except the basic set-up. At least it tries to kill off Michael Myers for good.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 46%\n\nYeah, it’s one point higher than Halloween 4 for this one. I’m a bit conflicted, because despite its stupid moments (note: most of the first hour of the film), I am glad this film exists. It delivers on its promise, but it does absolutely nothing beyond that. If you want to see Laurie Strode destroy Michael Myers, you’ll get what you want.\n\nMATCH-UP HOME\n\nHOME\n\nYear: 1995\n\nDirector: Joe Chappelle\n\nStarring: Donald Pleasence, Paul Rudd, Marianne Hagan\n\nFor years after the release of the disastrous Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers, a bootleg copy circulated that was somewhat more in line with screenwriter Daniel Farrands’ original vision. However, it wasn’t until 2013 that this version was first screened to the public, leading to it being given an official release the next year with the help of producers Malek Akkad and Paul Freeman.\n\nLet’s get to the obvious question right off the bat—Is this version better? Well seeing as how the original cut was entirely incoherent, legitimately painful to watch due to the strobe light effects, and was hands down one of the worst films I’ve ever seen, yes this version is better. That said, even if this version was immensely better than the original, it could still be a very bad film. Let’s find out if it’s any good. Since a lot of the plot is the same as the original cut, I’m not going to give a beat-by-beat of the events again, because it would just be repetitive. For that, check out my review of the original if you haven’t.\n\nThe beginning of the film is similar to the theatrical release, as Jamie Lloyd (J.C Brandy) is about to give birth to her son, and after doing so, a nurse helps her escape.\n\nHowever, the film doesn’t feel the need to constantly cut away every three-seconds like it’s the slasher version of Natural Born Killers or something. There’s actually atmosphere and tension here. The nurse’s death still isn’t all that scary, but at least it works.\n\nMost of the story (except the final act) plays out like it does in the theatrical cut, just with more time to develop characters and arcs. That said, the Jamie Lloyd story goes a bit differently.\n\nLike in the theatrical cut, Jamie hides out in a barn, but instead of impaling her on a corn thresher and turning it on, Michael just stabs her. The corn thresher death was insulting to the character, disgusting, and almost comically over-the-top, but this works a lot better. In fact, it actually turns out that Jamie survives the stabbing, which leads Dr. Loomis and Dr. Wynn to join the police investigation the next morning. Also, the cult’s thorn symbol is there for… some reason.\n\nWhile I’m still not sure that Mitch Ryan was the right choice for Loomis’ old colleague Dr. Wynn, I at least get their sense of camaraderie here. They do seem very friendly with each other, and I do believe Loomis trusts Wynn. Plus, it’s great to see Donald Pleasence do another of his “Michael Myers has returned” monologues to the cops in this scene. We even get one line explaining that Loomis has had skin grafts to fix his burn scars, which makes me think the theatrical cut was intentionally going for plot holes.\n\nWe get a brief moment of Loomis watching Jamie being pulled away on a stretcher, and it is utterly confusing to me as to why this was cut in the theatrical version. You cut the scene between the two emotional cruxes of the last two films! Since it only lasts a few seconds, why would you cut this? Even though she’d be dead at this point in the theatrical cut, you could edit the scene, since you edited the film to hell and back anyway.\n\nLoomis later visits Jamie in the hospital (she’s still unconscious), which actually gives a reason as to why Tommy Doyle bumps into him there, one of a million things that made no sense in the theatrical cut. Well, if you were wondering how Jamie got pregnant, we get an answer here… kinda. Jamie has a flashback to some sort of ritual with the Thorn cult, wherein it’s suggested that Michael Myers raped her at the cult’s behest.\n\nIt’s not entirely clear here what happens (and screenwriter Daniel Farrands is on record saying it shouldn’t be clear), but Kara Strode outright tells Michael later that the baby is his. How Kara Strode knows this is entirely beyond me, but maybe the cult told her as a bonus for being their sacrifice or something… we’ll get there. I’m still not sure why the cult would want another Myers’ family member, but what confuses me more is why viewers think this betrays Michael Myers’ character so much. He’s an absolute monster, and even though it seems murder is one of the only things he ever thinks of, I don’t see why rape would be out of the realm of possibility. Do you really think a mass murderer has standards?\n\nHowever, Jamie Lloyd still gets bumped off unceremoniously, this time by the Man in Black, who shoots her in her hospital bed.\n\nHe says her work is done, but again, he had her trapped in the cult and could have killed her immediately following her child being born. At least it’s slightly better than what happens to her in the other version.\n\nThere were a bunch of little things in the theatrical version that added up to a big pile of annoyance, but a lot of those are gone here. There’s no stupid scare sound effect every time a character appears. There are no conversations we enter mid-dialogue. The music is more akin to the original film rather than the atrocious sound design in the theatrical version. There’s even an added creepy scene where Kara walks around the college campus, feeling both very alone and very paranoid, and it’s incredibly effective. We get a lot more Kara Strode in this film thankfully, and we get a better feel of the close bond between her and her son Danny.\n\nThe death of John Strode is no longer a goofy head explosion, and Mrs. Blankenship’s weird performance seems a tad toned down (not enough, but still). Even Barry Simms’ death is explained here.\n\nSure, it’s as simple as he walked into the Smith’s Grove van instead of his own, but it’s something.\n\nThat’s not to say all of the problems present in the theatrical cut are fixed. Tommy Doyle is still a creep, and he still has those terribly written newspaper clippings.\n\nBeth is still convinced that Kara’s name is Carol in one scene. John Strode is still a completely horrible person who goes as far as to disown his daughter here. Still, these problems are fewer and far between.\n\nLet’s talk about the big changes, and they pretty much all involve the Cult of Thorn, whose existence drives the plot. The scene where Tommy explains the cult’s motivations and history to Kara is extended just a little bit, and it makes way more sense than it did before.\n\nIt turns out that Michael can only attempt to kill his family on Halloween night, and only when a certain star pattern (which is the same shape as the rune) appears in the sky. This pattern occurred in 1963, 1978, 1988, 1989 and the current year, 1995. (Hey, those last four are the years those movies came out.) The idea of a star pattern was mentioned in the theatrical cut, but again, it was edited down so much we didn’t get its significance. We also learn that if Michael is successful in killing the last of his bloodline, the curse will be passed on to someone else.\n\nThe most significant changes in this version come in the final act, after Dr. Wynn and his cult members kidnap Jamie’s baby, Kara and Danny for their ritual. The “his game and I know where he wants to play it” line even makes a bit more sense in this context, even though drugging Dr. Loomis and Tommy is still befuddling.\n\nThe goal of the ritual is for Michael to make his final sacrifice by killing his final family member, and then for the power to be passed to Danny so he can kill his mother, Kara.\n\nHey, that makes sense. Danny hearing voices and being kidnapped by the cult made no sense and added up to nothing in the theatrical version, but it obviously has a purpose here.\n\nHowever, Loomis and Tommy make their way to Smith’s Grove before the ritual is about to begin. Again, why Dr. Wynn allows them even a chance to get there is beyond me, but whatever. Tommy tries to find Kara and the children, and Loomis meets up with Wynn in his office. Wynn tells Loomis that he wants Loomis to join the cult now, as Wynn’s job will soon be his. Huh? Let’s get to the questions.\n\nIs Dr. Wynn choosing this change of job or is it the star pattern or whatever?\n\nDoes Dr. Loomis only take over if Michael is successful and his power ends? I understand that Loomis has knowledge of Michael, but what help would he be with Danny Strode?\n\nWhat kind of tenure does Dr. Wynn expect the retried and obviously worn out Dr. Loomis to have? Loomis is obviously the older man.\n\nWhat kind of tenure were the filmmakers expecting Dr. Loomis to have? Donald Pleasence was clearly in poor health, and this turned out to be his last film. Why would you set him up for a sequel that would require him to be a major player?\n\nLoomis is obviously a good man, if not a bit reckless at times. Will he just automatically become evil when Wynn passes the job? This is an odd curse.\n\nHowever, Loomis refuses to join willingly and calls Wynn a madman, so Wynn knocks him unconscious and leaves him in the office while he goes off to perform the ritual.\n\nMeanwhile, Tommy has apparently stolen the clothes of one of the cult members and enters the room where the sacrifices are to take place. Kara stalls Michael in the killing of the final sacrifice by confirming that Jamie’s baby is his (again how she knows is never answered), and Tommy holds Dr. Wynn at knife point, demanding Kara and the baby be let go. Wynn immediately complies with these demands, even though this is the man who wiped out an entire POLICE STATION in the last film! He didn’t take one weapon to the ritual? Not one cult member has one?\n\nI do enjoy Wynn’s little quip to Tommy, “You should join us, you have talent,” but beyond that, Mitch Ryan is just giving a strange, whispery performance in this scene. It makes way more sense when you realize the part was written with Christopher Lee in mind, as I can see him making these lines work. Ryan is halfway between not caring and hamming it up, resulting in a really weird performance.\n\nOf course, Michael Myers chases everyone through the hospital, but it ends with his stupidest defeat yet. Everyone except Tommy runs away (Maximum security doors are actually locked in this cut), and Tommy thinks he has a way to stop Michael. Earlier, he mentioned to Dr. Loomis that a “rune of light” may stop him, whatever that means. As Myers approaches, Tommy dumps some rocks on the ground, cuts his hand with a knife and makes a pattern on the floor with the blood.\n\nAs Myers chokes him, he says “Samhain,” which stops Michael in his tracks. (My theory is that Michael is wondering why he’s butchering the pronunciation so badly.)\n\nThis is just so underwhelming. That’s how you’re going to defeat a mass murderer? Runic Yahtzee? I’m not saying you have to just kill Myers again, but this is just so anticlimactic.\n\nTommy, Kara and the children drive away, and Loomis suggests they go somewhere far away from Haddonfield. However, he still does that whole “I’ve got some unfinished business” bit, which makes more sense here as Wynn is still alive, but it’s still confusing. When he goes back inside, Loomis finds Wynn on the ground in the Michael Myers outfit, and Wynn says it’s Loomis’ game now.\n\nIt’s completely ambiguous what Wynn’s situation is here. Did Myers stab him and he’s dying? Is he no longer evil because something was out of his control? What happens to him five minutes later? Anyway, the Thorn symbol appears on Loomis’ arm and he screams…\n\nAnd we see Michael Myers escape, dressed in the Man in Black garb Wynn used before.\n\nUpon first viewing, I was very positive towards this film. It sat well with me, because it was a complete product with some effectively creepy scenes. However, as I thought about it for a few days, its appeal wore off a bit (as I was afraid it would). I’m split on it now, because I do still like a lot of the scenes and ideas, but it feels rushed at the end, and ultimately, the movie is a bit scatterbrained. While the buildup is effective, the Runic Yahtzee scene is absurd, as is the curse passing to Loomis. With a more atmospheric and creepy ending, this could have been the best sequel so far, but ultimately, it’s a passable film with some interesting ideas. Let’s check out the final score.\n\nStory (10/25 Points)\n\nI really think this premise could have worked, and more of the arcs make sense here than in the theatrical cut, but that doesn’t mean it’s all that great. Sure, a lot of plot holes are fixed, but it still feels bloated with story lines that aren’t really necessary (too much time is spent with Tim and Beth, for example), and not enough time is given to the cult scenes at the end. Also, Runic Yahtzee.\n\nCharacters (12/25 Points)\n\nWe get more of Kara Strode and Dr. Loomis here, which greatly helps the film. I wish it could have been Kara who took down Myers instead of Tommy (I guess that falls under story too), but Marianne Hagan is giving her all, and Donald Pleasence is absolutely endearing as Loomis. This cut of the film shows why Mitch Ryan was just the wrong choice for Dr. Wynn, though, and Paul Rudd’s performance as the creepy Tommy Doyle is… well, creepy.\n\nExperience (13/25 Points)\n\nIt’s not all that scary per se, but oh my is it better than the original cut, which was physically painful to watch. There are slower scenes that feel more like something out of the original film, and it’s nice to have the original music restored.\n\nOriginality (15/25 Points)\n\nThe new stuff introduced makes sense here, and whether or not you like the Cult of Thorn plot, at least it’s followed through on.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 50%\n\nIt’s better in every way than the unwatchable theatrical cut. I wish it was a whole lot better, but I’m still glad this version exists. It has some great moments of subtlety and two great performances, and it’s a pretty enjoyable, consistent watch.\n\nAfter Curse‘s failure, the series was rebooted again, and I’ll be taking a look at that reboot next week.\n\nMATCH-UP HOME\n\nHOME\n\nYear: 1995\n\nDirector: Joe Chappelle\n\nStarring: Donald Pleasence, Paul Rudd, Marianne Hagan\n\nAfter a less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Halloween 5, producer Moustapha Akkad decided to take some time to evaluate the Halloween series and find a good direction for the next film to go. Eventually, he settled on a screenplay by Halloween fan Daniel Farrands, which even made Donald Pleasence enthusiastic to join the series for another installment.\n\nIt is hard to talk about Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (The number 6 only appears in the title of the alternate producer’s cut) without talking a little about the history, but I’ll sum it up here by saying it was a truly difficult production process where the script was butchered beyond belief. I will talk more about that in next week’s review of the producer’s cut, but for now, I have to judge the film at hand.\n\nThe film starts with Jamie Lloyd (J.C. Brandy), now a teenager, going into labor and being rolled through dark passageways on a stretcher.\n\nHowever, the doctors roll her into a room that appears to be set up for some kind of cult ritual instead. It turns out that this cult, run by the mysterious Man in Black who set Michael free at the end of the last film, has kept Jamie hostage since those events.\n\nA nurse in this scene even has to say “Jamie Lloyd, push” just so we know that yes, this is a Halloween film, and yes, this is Jamie. That is how un-Halloween this opening is. Apparently, Danielle Harris wanted to return as Jamie Lloyd, but due to her age, she needed permission from her parents to do the nude scenes. Eventually, she emancipated herself from her parents, but the studio only offered her $1,000 for a week of work. I mean, it’s not like she was one of the stars of the last two films or anything. Ironically, by the time the film was released in its theatrical form, there were absolutely no nude scenes of Jamie after all.\n\nThe editing in both this scene and most of the film is unpleasant, constantly cutting to something different every few seconds because the movie is obviously bored with itself. There are all kinds of weird strobe lights throughout, and the score has been bastardized into something very 90s and hard rock, which destroys its brilliant subtlety.\n\nThe mysterious Man in Black takes Jamie’s baby and marks it with blood (presumably for death, but this movie doesn’t really answer much), but the nurse takes it when no one is looking and tells Jamie to run. Jamie does just that, but soon Michael Myers (George Wilbur) appears and strangles the nurse and impales her on a spike.\n\nThe deaths in this film are absurdly over-the-top, which contrary to (apparently) someone’s beliefs, doesn’t make them scarier. George Wilbur is the first actor to play Myers twice, and once again, he just isn’t scary. I don’t know if it’s more the actor or the way he’s shot, but he just kind of appears and kills people in the most boring, tedious way.\n\nAnyway, Jamie finally outruns Myers and steals a guy’s truck.\n\nMyers sees her driving away, and murders the truck owner. Alright, for the first time in this review, but definitely not the last, I’ve got some questions.\n\nWhere did Jamie learn to drive? She was younger than 10 when the cult captured her, and it’s made clear that she has not resurfaced since.\n\nI suppose you could argue that maybe the sympathetic nurse taught her how to drive, but then why is Jamie surprised when the nurse helps her get away?\n\nWhy does Michael Myers kill the truck owner? What did he do? He doesn’t like that Jamie stole his truck and drove away and neither does Michael.\n\nBored with this plot line already, the movie cuts to Kara Strode (Marianne Hagan) comforting her son (Devin Gardner), who is having visions of the mysterious Man in Black for… some reason. After she puts him to bed, Kara turns on the radio where shock jock Barry Simms (Leo Geter) quickly explains how Haddonfield has banned Halloween since the Myers killings and the police station massacre. That’s great and all but…\n\nReal nice ban you got going there. Be a shame if something should happen to it.\n\nAlso, the movie is apparently so bored with this exposition that it feels the need to show it over a scene of Kara undressing. How is the movie this bored with itself NINE MINUTES IN?\n\nThe shock jock is taking all kinds of calls, including one woman who thinks she’s in love with Michael Myers. I’m not even touching that one. Oh yeah, normally I would, but there are so many things wrong with this movie that I’ve got to pick my battles. Next to call in is Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd), the boy Laurie was babysitting in the very first movie, now all grown up.\n\nI don’t know what Paul Rudd is going for in this performance. For some of the movie, he uses this old timey-horror voice, but he drops it as he goes. In two scenes, he walks like a hunchback, but he walks normally for the rest of the film. For most of the movie, he’s just speaking in monotone, which is really strange, knowing what a likable actor Rudd is today. As for this film, his character is not likable at all. I mean, I think he’s supposed to be, but in his opening scene, he’s spying on Kara Strode from his room.\n\nNow bored with both Kara and Tommy, the film cuts to Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) also listening to the radio broadcast. The broadcast theorizes that he’s dead, but Loomis says, with no one in the room, “Not dead, just very much retired.” He knows the radio can’t hear him, right?\n\nAn old colleague of Dr. Loomis, Dr. Terrence Wynn (Mitchell Ryan) decides to drop in to pay Loomis a visit… nope we’re bored with that already. Let’s cut back to Jamie driving. At this point, the movie has not even been going for twelve minutes and it can’t pick anything to focus on! Making it appear busier is only going to alienate the viewer. After Jamie drives to a bus station to call into the show in an attempt to reach Loomis, we cut back to Loomis and Wynn. They discuss a few lines about Wynn wanting to bring Loomis back to Smith’s Grove Hospital, but then it cuts back to Jamie. Stop interrupting mid-conversation! Let a scene breathe!\n\nEventually, Michael chases Jamie to a barn and kills her by impaling her on a corn thresher and turning it on. So this is how we’re going to kill one of the most universally-loved characters of the franchise—a few minutes into a movie in a disgusting unscary way played by an entirely different actress as nothing more than a plot point. Since Michael is trying to kill of his entire family, he wants to kill the baby as well, but it turns out Jamie left him somewhere instead.\n\nThe next day, Tommy Doyle, deducing what he could from Jamie calling into the radio broadcast, makes his way to the nearest bus station. He finds a trail of blood that leads him right into the bathroom, where he hears a crying baby in a cabinet and finds Jamie’s child.\n\nWHAT? Here we go again…\n\nJamie was on the run from Michael and obviously had to think on her feet, but she couldn’t think of anywhere better to leave her baby than a bus station bathroom? Does she know what kind of people populate those?\n\nHow did no one see the trail of blood leading to the bathroom? Jamie left him there in the middle of the night, and yet Tommy goes to the bus station the next morning! Not one person said “What’s that trail of blood doing leading right into the bathroom?”\n\nHow long was that newborn baby inside a cabinet without eating? I mean, it had to be at least 8 hours right?\n\nTommy then takes the baby to a hospital, but since he acts incredibly suspicious, the hospital workers get suspicious of him, and he takes the baby home instead.\n\nAs mentioned above, Tommy lives across from Kara Strode, but we don’t find out until the scene with Kara’s entire family that they live in the old Myers’ house, which at least is closer to its design in the original film than it was in 5.\n\nKara and her son have moved back in with her abusive father John (Bradford English), mother Debra (Kim Darby) and brother Tim (Keith Bogart… the “No Relation” is implied). Get it, John and Debra, like John Carpenter and Debra Hill? What a way to honor the creators of the original film by naming an abusive husband and his wife in the worst film in the series after them?\n\nJohn Strode is a character who exists only to be despised the audience. In his introductory scene, he openly tells his daughter he doesn’t want her there, mocks her for going to college, yells at his wife for giving her money, calls Kara’s son a bastard, and slaps her across the face. I really hate when a movie introduces this kind of character, because he’s not the villain, but rather just an additional jerk we know only exists to get killed.\n\nThis guy makes Biff Tannen look subtle. I was actually hoping it would turn out he was in league with the cult, and had moved into the house to sacrifice his family or something, because at least it would have lined up with how horrible a person he is, but nope. He only exists so we can cheer on his death at the hands of the actual villain, which is a weird expectation to have for the audience. It’s scary when likable characters die, not horrible people like John.\n\nDespite this film’s manic editing and constant jumping around, Marianne Hagan actually does manage to give a good performance as Kara. She’s not a teenage slasher lead, but someone who’s obviously lived through a bit more than your typical naive final girl.\n\nThere are hints throughout that her son might grow up to be a killer like Michael, but you guessed it, it goes nowhere. It’s just dropped 2/3 of the way in. (To be fair, no one could be too upset when he pulled the knife on John). It’s not even made clear if he hears the voices because he will grow up to be evil, or just because he’s living in the Myers’ house.\n\nIn addition to the baby, apparently Michael considers John Strode and family to be his family, because they’re living in his house, so he has to kill them too. What I don’t get about this halfway explanation is that it could have been solved so easily. What if Tommy Doyle left the baby with Kara at the Myers’ house, meaning Michael would kill the family members to get to him? They wouldn’t have to do the whole “Whoever lives in his house is his family” runaround.\n\nDr. Loomis drops in to visit Mrs. Strode and warn her that Michael will come home. He of course does this unannounced, because every time a character appears on screen, we apparently need a fake-out jump scare. We hear a bit of their conversation… no really, it’s clearly taken from a much longer scene of Loomis talking to Debra about Michael Myers, but the movie gets bored with itself and cuts back and forth to other things.\n\nWell, Loomis leaves, and after Debra calls John, who abuses her some more, Michael Myers kills Debra. Kara comes home, and while she doesn’t find the body, she notices something is wrong. She walks into her son’s room to find Tommy Doyle, cradling Jamie’s baby, and sitting on the bed with Kara’s son like some kind of child predator.\n\nWhy does everyone in this film think it is perfectly acceptable to walk into someone’s home unannounced? When Kara asks what he’s doing there, Tommy says “I’m your neighbor from across the street.” THAT. DOESN’T. ANSWER. THE. QUESTION. Since Kara is the only sensible character in the film, she tells her son Danny to go downstairs, but he says “Tommy’s my new friend. He knows all about dinosaurs.” Imagine for one second you tuned into this movie right at this point. What would you think is going on here?\n\nTommy takes Kara across the street to the boarding house where he lives, run by Mrs. Blankenship (Janice Knickrehm). Up in his room, he has all kinds of research about the Myers case, including this newspaper clipping.\n\nTOMMY DOYLE SURVIVES BABYSITTER BLOODBATH? Never mind the fact that multiple teenagers died that night and Tommy Doyle was across the street! He wasn’t even in the house where it happened. This wasn’t some interview that came later either. The date on that article is “November 1, 1978,” the morning after the Halloween killing. Imagine if the headline on April 15, 1865 was “TAD LINCOLN SURVIVES ABRAHAM LINCOLN ASSASSINATION.”\n\nSomehow this isn’t even the worse newspaper clipping that Tommy Doyle owns. Check out this one from the morning after 6-year-old Michael Myers killed his sister.\n\nLocal Tot? TOT? A child kills his sister in cold blood, and you use the word TOT? Did a potato do the killing?\n\nWhy did the columnist think “Tot” was an acceptable word to use in this circumstance? Why did his editor let it go? Even in 1964, there’s no way this word was being used in a serious context. Hold on, I think I know how this went.\n\nSomehow, this bizarre newspaper editor slipped this word past the censors. It was a busy news day, so no one noticed. The next day, he was called into the editor’s office, where he was promptly fired. His wife and child were embarrassed by the headline and promptly left the house without even taking everything. Ostracized by the town, the journalist took the pet parrot left behind in his home and set up a hovel just outside of town, hoping to one day return. 24 years later, the tot had grown up and visited the man in his hovel, and the disgraced journalist knew he finally had his story. Unfortunately, right as he was about to take the story to his publisher, Michael Myers killed him.\n\nFinally, an explanation of why there’s a hobo right outside of town at the beginning of Halloween 5. I just wish this explanatory scene hadn’t been left on the cutting room floor.\n\nTommy shares his theories about the Thorn symbol with Kara, because we’ve gotta get this exposition to the audience somehow. He theorizes that the Thorn symbol on Michael Myers’ arm is a Celtic rune, representing an ancient curse in which a child must kill his entire family on the night of Samhain or his entire tribe will die. Again, like Loomis in Halloween II, the pronunciation is butchered, because we all know only Conal Cochran knows how to pronounce it.\n\nAs if Tommy couldn’t get creepy enough, when Kara leans down to look at the research on his computer, he sniffs her hair. Why is this guy a lead character? He’s just a creep. Sure he suffered some terrible trauma, but that doesn’t justify him acting like a sexual predator all the time. Just because a character says “He’s harmless” in one scene doesn’t actually mean he is! Also, why are we learning about Tommy’s theories after the audience is well aware that Jamie escaped a cult that Myers was a part of? Wouldn’t it be more interesting if we saw Tommy’s theories and didn’t see the cult until later? If Jamie Lloyd just re-appeared, that would spark a mystery in the audience’s mind, and we would want to know what had happened. Instead, our reaction is “Yep, that’s the cult we saw earlier of which no mention has been made again until this moment.”\n\nAlso, it lessens the horror of Michael Myers if he’s controlled by a cult that forces him to kill his family. If the film made it clear that the cult noticed he killed his sister at age 6 and took interest in him, that could be interesting, because they’re just using the evil that’s already in him. Unfortunately, that’s never stated one way or the other. However, my biggest problem with the cult isn’t that it makes Myers less scary. It’s that it makes no sense whatsoever. Let me try and break it down from what we know at this point.\n\nThe cult wants Michael to kill his entire family, or everyone in the “tribe” (whatever that means in a modern context) will die. Why do they keep his last living family member, his niece Jamie Lloyd, alive?\n\nHow does Jamie get pregnant? Did someone in the cult rape her? If their goal is for Michael to kill his family, why would they take a chance on there being more family?\n\nWhy did they let her have the baby, and why did they keep him alive after it was born? It seems that they want to use him for some kind of ritual, but why does it matter? Shouldn’t they just let Michael kill him and Jamie immediately?\n\nTrust me, we learn more about the cult later, and it only makes things more confusing.\n\nDownstairs, Mrs. Blankenship tells Kara’s son Danny stories about the festival of Samhain. Hmm, I wonder if she’s in the cult.\n\nWell it turns out she was Michael Myers’ babysitter the night he killed his sister. That doesn’t even make sense! Why was his sister home having sex with her boyfriend on Halloween if an old lady was babysitting her brother? Go back and watch the original scene from Halloween. The sister makes it clear to her boyfriend that Michael is the only other one around. Although the original film never gives a reason for Michael Myers’ killings, it’s kind of implied that he kills teenagers and babysitters because his teenage sister was his babysitter. If Mrs. Blankenship was watching him, why doesn’t he go around and kill landladies? With every plot development in this film, it only makes less and less sense.\n\nWith the help of the Barry Simms, Kara’s brother Tim and his girlfriend Beth (Mariah O’ Brien) are throwing a party to bring Halloween back to Haddonfield, which really doesn’t have any relevance to the plot except to get them out of the house for a while. The film does this really cheap trick where it teases that Simms might be the Man in Black, simply because he’s wearing a black outfit, but we all know it’s just a red herring. Was this DJ even a thing six years ago when the Man in Black killed everyone at the police station?\n\nJohn Strode returns to an empty home, starts yelling at his wife who isn’t even there, and walks into a dark basement. Hmmm… I wonder if he’s about to get killed. He sees the washing machine running where he finds Michael’s bloody laundry. Look Mikey, I know this was your home 30 years ago, but you can’t just barge in and do laundry. Michael walks up behind John and impales him on the breaker, electrocuting him and eventually causing his head to explode!\n\nWell you couldn’t do anything scary, but I guess you’ll make up for it with the most over-the-top death scene imaginable? Not cutting it.\n\nAnyway, in a shocking turn of events at the town Halloween party, Simms is a creep too. Yep, as he’s hosting the party on the campus lawn, he keeps asking Tim about Beth’s sexual habits.\n\nHowever, when he finds out Tim lives at the Myers’ house, he wants to do a radio show live from there. Tim and Beth go back to the house, but Simms is killed in his car by Myers. I’m not exactly sure why he’s killed, but the movie needed a body count, so chalk up another one in that column. We later see his corpse fall from a tree, meaning somehow Michael Myers subtly walked through the hundreds of party goers, climbed a tree, put the body up there, got back down, and walked away without anyone noticing. Sure. That’s believable.\n\nBack at the Myers’ house, Tim and Beth are all alone in a dark house and decide to have sex, assuming that Simms was just pranking them about the whole radio show idea. They insist of having sex in Kara’s room for no reason in particular, which would be just about the strangest thing in any given movie but doesn’t even crack the Top 10 in this one. This is obviously so the whole voyeuristic-camera-in-Tommy-Doyle’s-room angle will come into play, but come on. What college-age male insists on having sex in his older sister’s bedroom?\n\nWhen Kara sees the light on across the street, she calls her home, surprised that only Tim and Beth are there, and not her parents.\n\nTim is killed in the bathroom after taking a shower, and Kara tries to get Beth to leave the house. However, Beth doesn’t even seem to know who she’s talking to as she calls Kara “Carol.” SERIOUSLY? With all the atrocious editing in this film, you couldn’t edit someone accidentally calling a character “Carol” to “Kara.” Wow. Anyway, the warnings of both Kara and Carol are too late, and Beth is killed by Michael Myers in another incredibly unscary death scene.\n\nAt the Halloween party, Tommy runs into Dr. Loomis, who asks “Where’s the baby?” which is obviously just one of the screenwriter’s notes that spilled over into the shooting script. They make their way back to the boarding house and meet up with all the principal characters who aren’t Michael Myers. The Man in Black is sitting with Kara’s son Danny on his lap, because apparently every character in this thing needs to act like a predator, and he’s revealed to be… Dr. Wynn.\n\nShocked? Of course not. Who else was it gonna be? The old colleague of a hero who is overly-chummy with him, played by a character actor best known for playing villains? I never would have guessed it. Wynn has barely been in this film though, and his scenes have always been drastically shortened, so if you weren’t aware who this character was, I wouldn’t blame you. There’s even a poorly edited reaction shot of Loomis saying “Wynn” just to remind us who he is!\n\nKara runs upstairs and sees Mrs. Blankenship with the baby, but when she finds out that Blankenship too is a cult member (which was blatantly obvious), she jumps through the glass second-story window.\n\nIt’s a movie, though, so of course she is only injured. The movie then awkwardly cuts to Tommy and Loomis standing outside the house where Kara landed, realizing the cult has taken her. Tommy says he feels like he’s been drugged, which Loomis agrees with. Um… why? Were they drugged previously and they just woke up to see everyone gone? Could the movie make this a little clearer please? Obviously they don’t pass out later in the film, so I guess this is what they’re saying.\n\nTommy then decides to be sensible for once and ask why the cult didn’t just kill them. Hey, you can’t ask that, that’s my job. Loomis gives the answer that “It’s his game, and I know where he wants to play it.” He’s referring to Smith’s Grove, but what sense does this make? While I suppose you could argue that Wynn still thinks he can convince Loomis to join him in his cult, what good is he doing by keeping Tommy Doyle alive? If they did drug Tommy and Loomis, why didn’t they capture them and lock them up at Smith’s Grove? Absolutely nothing in this film makes sense.\n\nIn another scene that was clearly edited down to the point of total incoherence, Dr. Loomis meets up with Dr. Wynn in his office.\n\nWhen Loomis asks for an explanation of his actions, Wynn says “I’ve had my failures, but this baby —Jamie’s baby. We are in the dawn of a new age, Sam.” He then has Dr. Loomis knocked unconscious. That’s the entire explanation. What does he want with the baby? Doesn’t he run the cult that controls Michael Myers? Doesn’t Michael Myers have to kill off every member of his family? Why is he waxing eloquent about this baby like it’s the Antichrist or something? I thought he wanted to kill it. I have watched this exchange over and over, and nothing makes any sense. I suppose the failures are other times he’s tried to artificially inseminate someone? Maybe that’s what he did with Jamie? OK… Michael is ultimate evil, and he’s trying to create more ultimate evil by forcing Michael’s relative to have children. That would make sense if Michael’s entire goal (and the goal of the cult) wasn’t to kill his entire family. Had no one working on this ever seen a Halloween film… or a horror film… or a film? The movie is working against itself!\n\nMeanwhile, Tommy is wandering through the hospital, trying to find Kara. He walks right into the MAXIMUM SECURITY WARD which isn’t locked.\n\nWhy is the cult running their operations out of a hospital if they’re not even going to lock the doors leading to MAXIMUM SECURITY? Tommy finds Kara locked in Room 237, which means that shockingly someone on the production team had actually seen a horror film before, and he breaks her out and they try to outrun Michael Myers. Why does the cult have Kara captured? Oh don’t worry, they won’t answer that either. If it’s for more of that breeding ultimate evil crap, how will that work? She’s not related to Michael! I mean, her dad was a real jerk, but I don’t think they can make a race of superhuman killers out of those genes.\n\nWynn goes back to do perform some surgery (I guess it’s some experimental stuff, but who knows, it may be a tonsillectomy), with Jamie’s baby and Danny locked in the next room. Tommy and Kara save the children, because this isn’t Halloween 3 and we’re not killing kids. Michael for… reasons… kills Wynn and all the doctors/cult members.\n\nI’m so glad that plot went absolutely nowhere. The editing and strobe light effects in the operating room massacre scene are so unpleasant that they render it near unwatchable (not that it really was to begin with).\n\nKara and Tommy get chased by Myers around the hospital for way too long, and finally it seems that Tommy kills him. There have at least been great chase scenes in each of these movies so far, but nope, this one is boring as sin. For some reason Tommy is the one who delivers the final blow to Michael Myers, as opposed to our strong, interesting female lead, and everyone gets away. Outside of Smith’s Grove, Tommy is driving everyone home and offers to take Loomis with him, but he says he has some business to conclude.\n\nThat doesn’t really make any sense, but why start doing that now? We see the Michael Myers mask laying on the floor where his body used to be, and we hear Loomis scream from inside. The End.\n\nWow. I am in utter shock at how butchered this movie is. Even if you went in not knowing a single thing about production, you could tell within 5 seconds that this thing was edited beyond recognition. What were they thinking? Well according to Marianne Hagan, the R-rated film was screened to a bunch of 13 or 14-year-olds who were bored. You have to be 17 to get into an R-rated film by yourself! This is not your test audience. However, by reshoots, Donald Pleasence was dead, so they had to work the new ending around that, which is why he’s barely in it.\n\nThink for one second about the single worst film you’ve ever seen. What is it? The Room? Birdemic? The Garbage Pail Kids Movie? It may have character motivations and plot points that don’t make sense, but can you trace the story from the beginning to the end? Does it have an arc? Is there some kind of resolution at the end? Johnny kills himself and Mark leaves Lisa, the birds fly away (albeit without much reason), and the Garbage Pail Kids… find acceptance? I can’t remember, but it made more sense than this. The Curse of Michael Myers sets up characters and arcs that go nowhere, and even worse, contradict the other ones. Myers isn’t dead at the end, Loomis might or might not be, we have no idea if any of the cult members are alive somewhere, the idea that Kara’s son could be evil is still open-ended… you get the point. I cannot think of another film, at least one released by a major studio on a $5 million budget, that was so incompetent at telling a story. The only one I can think of is Manos: The Hands of Fate, which was made on a budget of $19,000 by a bunch of people who never worked in film. This is unacceptable. In terms of storytelling, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a worse film.\n\nStory (0/25 Points)\n\nNope. It doesn’t get a single point. It’s entirely incoherent and contradicts itself.\n\nCharacters (7/25 Points)\n\nI actually like Kara Strode as a character, and Marianne Hagan is really trying her best, but beyond that… ugh. Dr. Loomis has his time significantly cut, and Jamie is played by a different actress (who does OK, I guess) and is gone after a few minutes. The other performances are mostly just bizarre from Paul Rudd’s weird choices as Tommy Doyle to the comically over-the-top Mrs. Blankenship and John Strode. Mitchell Ryan adds very little as Dr. Wynn, and while I do believe Kim Darby as abused wife Debra Strode, she gets killed off too early to make an impression.\n\nExperience (0/25 Points)\n\nThe editing is some of the worst I’ve ever seen, constantly cutting away from a scene and back again for no reason. Also, strobe lights aren’t scary, and the loud score rips away what could be moments of subtlety. It is clear to any viewer that this movie was ruined on the cutting room floor.\n\nOriginality (2/25 Points)\n\nIt kind of throws a bunch of cliches at you and doesn’t add them together for any kind of effect. I don’t really count “absolute gibberish” as original.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 9%\n\nI was not expecting it to be this bad. I don’t know if the producer’s cut is going to be good, but I can’t imagine it’s any worse than this.\n\nMATCH-UP HOME\n\nHOME\n\nYear: 1989\n\nDirector: Dominique Othenin-Girard\n\nStarring: Donald Pleasence, Danielle Harris, Ellie Cornell\n\nAfter the shocking twist ending to the otherwise underwhelming Halloween 4, everyone wondered where the next sequel would go now that Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris) was a killer. Would she and her uncle Michael Myers team up to kill? Was he dead for good and she would be the lone killer? Well, no, none of that happened. Producer Moustapha Akkad decided that a child couldn’t be a killer, also believing that fans would be upset at another Halloween film without Michael Myers so the idea was scrapped.\n\nThat said, this movie doesn’t completely ignore that final scene. It turns out that Jamie only attacked and injured her foster mother, but didn’t kill her. Since we never actually saw the murder, I suppose I have to let this go. Jamie has been in a children’s mental hospital ever since, getting treatment for attacking her foster mother and for her continuing nightmares of Michael Myers.\n\nThe psychic link she was suggested to have with her uncle before is played up something fierce here, and it’s actually built on nicely. Again, Danielle Harris gives one of the best performances in the film as the traumatized Jamie. She’s a mute for the first half of the film, which she gradually gets over, and she has a close bond with her foster sister Rachel (Ellie Cornell) and even Rachel’s housemates Tina and Samantha (Wendy Kaplan, Tamara Gylnn). Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) also checks in on her, worried himself that Michael Myers (Don Shanks) will return.\n\nMeanwhile, the movie has to retcon how Michael Myers survived being blown away by multiple people at the end of the last film. Yep, he somehow survived the blast and managed to crawl away to safety, even though in this film it’s shown that the police set dynamite to the area as well (something filmed for but not shown in Halloween 4). Myers finds safety at the lodge of a hobo who takes him in and nurses him back to health… for some reason.\n\nThis hobo also apparently has a parrot, because of course he does. Did he just leave his modest, lonely abode one day and walk into a pet store? Does he continue to walk into this pet store and buy birdseed? He’s not even that good of a hobo if he lives this close to a suburban community.\n\nApparently, an earlier version of this scene was shot with some sort of occult overtones and a man who raises Myers from the dead, but this was shelved. I mean, it would have added forced supernatural themes into a movie that is about a human killer (Yeah, we’ll get to the 6th film), but at least it would have made sense.\n\nAnyway, on Halloween Eve, Michael kills the hobo, because this guy’s not exactly Kato Kaelin when it comes to being a decent house guest, and he makes his return to Haddonfield. Jamie, through her psychic link to her uncle, can see him killing the hobo. Her nurse (Betty Carvalho) tries to help her with her problems, but unfortunately giving the single worst performance in the movie gets in the way.\n\nHer acting is just so over-the-top, shouting every word like it’s some daytime soap opera. I know it’s an incredibly minor performance, but it’s just awful.\n\nIt’s not explicitly stated if Rachel, Tina and Samantha are sorority sisters or even in college, but regardless, they all live in a pretty nice house together. Rachel returns home, and Jamie starts to worry that Michael Myers is near the house. The buildup here is genuinely suspenseful, with Michael Myers stalking his victims in a creepy way he hasn’t done since the original film.\n\nRachel eventually runs out of the house and manages to call the police, showing us the film is not afraid to take its time. It helps that the additional music by Alan Howarth really does a nice job of blending in with the existing Halloween theme by John Carpenter.\n\nWhen the police do get there, they are the two most stereotypical bumbling cops imaginable. There’s even cartoon music and sound effects that accompany them! WHAT? Was the editor suddenly self-aware of how idiotic these characters were that he threw this in? We follow up the tense scene where Rachel is in fear of getting murdered with something out of a Mel Brooks movie. It’s weird.\n\nAfter the guys from Lethally Stupid Weapon leave, Rachel goes back into the house and gets murdered. OK, that’s the quick version, because once again, there is actually good buildup to it, and we genuinely don’t know if it’s going to happen or not. Again, this kind of suspense and surprise has not existed since the first film. I agree with the majority of viewers that killing off one of the most likable characters from the last film and leaving her annoying friends Tina and Samantha isn’t a great decision, but it’s still an effective scene, even (or especially) in broad daylight.\n\nVery little is actually shown of her scissors-to-the-chest death, leaving a lot to the imagination. Instead, we see Jamie violently convulsing, because she knows it’s happening.\n\nBeau Starr returns as Sheriff Ben Meeker, who is far more on edge this time around, but understandably so. His daughter was killed during the last murder spree, and Meeker himself seemingly blasted Michael Myers into oblivion. Again, in time, he does heed the warnings of Dr. Loomis.\n\nMeeker’s first scene with Loomis gives us one of the best Loomis quotes of the whole series, “I prayed that [Michael] would burn in Hell, but in my heart, I knew that Hell would not have him.” It’s amazing that Loomis pretty much does the same thing in every film, and yet it never gets old or feels repetitive. That’s the brilliant acting of Donald Pleasence for you. That said, like in Halloween II, Loomis is more unhinged here, but if you thought a murderer had been killed twice, wouldn’t you be?\n\nUnfortunately, with one of the most likable characters dead and our child protagonist still stuck in the hospital, the film goes off the rails for a bit. We have to spend way too much time with Samantha and Tina and their boyfriends Spitz (That’s the only name he’s given) and… this guy.\n\nBowzer from Sha Na Na would complain this guy is too over the top! It’s like this thing had two screenwriters, one of which was writing a genuine film and one of which was writing a broad parody. Were there really that many ’50s greasers in late ’80s Illinois? Is this town so small they didn’t get the ’50s until the ’80s? Do we get some Vietnam protesters in the next film? What does Tina see in this guy anyway? He only seems to be sexually attracted to his own car. He’s so into it that it makes the guys from “Greased Lightning” seem like they just have a minor crush. In a later scene, Tina gives a terrible speech to Jamie about how Mikey (that’s really what he goes by) makes her feel, even though he’s nothing but a horrible person to her in the entirety of his screen time.\n\nAnyway, Bowzer gets killed soon after by a scythe to the face, (although I would have personally preferred they just forced him to host a lousy Hollywood Squares reboot) and Michael Myers steals his Halloween costume and drives to pick-up Tina for a party. In a scene that takes forever, Tina does not realize it’s Michael Myers behind the mask (Get it? It’s funny because she calls him Michael.).\n\nWhen they pull off at a gas station for cigarettes, it leads to one of the film’s most infamous moments. Through her psychic connection, Jamie can see that Tina is in trouble and manages to get a few words out like “store” and “big woman,” describing a large advertisement out front of a woman with cookies covering her breasts. She then cries out “cookie woman,” leading Donald Pleasence to repeat it in utter confusion. Regardless, it does lead the cops to Tina, but someone should have done a re-write on this scene.\n\nThe scenes at the Halloween party are pretty bland and predictable. Samantha and Spitz have sex. Think they get killed by Michael Myers? Of course they do. Is it scary? Of course it isn’t. Do kids play a prank on the cops where they pretend to be Michael Myers? Of course. Is it funny? Of course it isn’t. Does it go on far too long? Of course it does.\n\nJamie makes her way to the party with her friend Billy, afraid that everyone is in danger, and Myers begins to chase her and Billy in a car.\n\nTina sacrifices herself so Jamie and Billy can get to safety, leaving none of the main teenage characters alive.\n\nDr. Loomis has a plan to take down Michael Myers for good (at least until the next movie), and Jamie Lloyd agrees to help out. Loomis uses Jamie as bait to lure Michael to his old family home. Hold up. THIS was the Myers’ home in the original film.\n\nTHIS is the Myers’ home in Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers.\n\nThis sudden and complete switch is a practice dating back to the earliest days of the theatre called “Not Giving a Damn.” However, if you can get past this, the scenes in the Myers’ home are chilling. Like the first act, we’re back to that minimalist horror style of the first film.\n\nOnce Loomis is hurt, Jamie manages to hide in a laundry chute, and the film takes its time in the hunt. The dark house is ideal for"
