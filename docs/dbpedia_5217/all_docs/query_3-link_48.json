It is also a common theme in the entertainment media where the struggle between good and evil is frequently resolved through violence. The potential negative impact of media violence on children has long been a public concern. It is even more troubling when U.S. military violence, both in the news and in the entertainment, is often glorified as heroic and patriotic. Children’s worlds of fantasy and reality collided when our political leaders, in response to the September 11th tragedy, simplified the complex international relationships into a fight between good and evil. The Bush administration used the narrative strategically—and the news media perpetuated it with enthusiasm—pumping up patriotism and generating public support for the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. This video examines how the “good and evil” rhetoric, in both the entertainment and the news media, has helped children to dehumanize the enemies, justify their killing and treat the suffering of innocent civilians as necessary sacrifice. The interviews include media scholars (Robert Jenson, Robin Andersen), child psychologists (Diane Levin, Nancy Carlsson-Paige), teachers (Merrie Najimy, Brian Wright), educators (Eli Newberger and Betty Burkes), and the children themselves.\n\nBeyond the Frame: Alternative Perspectives on the War on Terrorism\n\nDVD\n\nApp. 120 minutes\n\n2004-122\n\nSince the 9/11 attacks, and on through the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, the mainstream media have presented a dangerously restricted range of views, mainly confined to the opinion of political elites and a commercial frame dependent on advertisers and ratings.

But it wasn’t suicide, and she didn’t die. And the investigation that followed turned the tiny town of Scottsboro, Alabama, deep in the heart of the Bible belt, upside down. Mrs. Summerford’s husband was the head preacher at the Church of Jesus with Signs Following, but he was unable to cast out his own demons. A heavy drinker, he was prone to fits of passion over his wife’s infidelities, real and imagined. He was also a snake handler. And on the fateful night, he went to his wife in a drunken stupor and demanded that she tell him the truth. When her answers did not satisfy him, he forced her at gunpoint to thrust her hand into a rattlesnake cage! But the drama was just beginning…\n\nConstructing Public Opinion\n\nDVD\n\nApp. 32 minutes\n\n2004-123\n\nThe media regularly use public opinion polls in their reporting of important news stories. But how exactly do they report them and to what end? In this insightful and accessible interview, Professor Justin Lewis demonstrates the way in which polling data are themselves used by the media to not just reflect what Americans think but instead to construct public opinion itself. Addressing vital issues (e.g., the role the media play in “manufacturing consent” for political elites, what polls really tell us about public opinion, what Americans actually think about politics), Constructing Public Opinion provides a new way to think about the relationship between politics, media and the public. Exploding the myth that most Americans are moderate or conservative, Constructing Public Opinion demonstrates the way in which political elites help to promote the military industrial complex and how the media sustains belief in an electoral system with a built-in bias against the interests of ordinary people. Well illustrated with graphics and many examples of media coverage, it is the first film of its kind to present a critical analysis of media and public opinion.\n\nCloud Atlas\n\nDVD\n\nApp. 165 minutes\n\n2022-11\n\nSix stories spanning centuries.

Though US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld accuses Al Jazeera of lying in its news reports, CONTROL ROOM tells a different story. Candid interviews with some of Al Jezeera’s leaders–like Sudanese journalist Hassan Ibrahim who formerly headed the BBC Arab News service, and senior producer Samir Khader who talks openly about his respect for American values– offer an Arab perspective on the US and the war. Meanwhile, Americans such as NBC correspondent David Shuster and Central Command press officer Lt. Josh Rushing, both working in Qatar, offer another point of view. Through various interviews, Al Jazeera is presented as a grass- roots organization devoted to being an independent news source. In addition, it is not afraid of showing the brutality of war. The station airs shocking footage of the devastation caused by US bombings, showing the resultant carnage of Iraqi civilians, Iraqi soldiers, as well as US soldiers. The Al Jazeera reporters dissect US news reports, which rarely contain coverage of this nature, pointing out how information is packaged to exclude certain truths. When asked her opinion of objectivity, Al Jazeera producer Deema Khatib calls it a mirage, which is a powerful statement about the foggy nature of truth as interpreted by the media. A fascinating look inside Al Jazeera, CONTROL ROOM will challenge viewers to question what to believe from the news they receive.\n\nCorner Gas (Season One)\n\nDVD\n\nApp. 290 minutes\n\n2018-68\n\nDreamt up by the prairie son Brent Butt, he stars stars as Brent Leroy, the town’s number one and only gas jockey.

Dash makes up for some overly schematic dialogue and an occasionally pokey pace with some strong performances (particularly Cora Lee Day as the sternly matriarchal Nana) and an absolutely wonderful visual sense (kudos should also go to her ace cinematographer Arthur Jafa, whose dazzlingly sumptuous imagery surely inspired Jonathan Demme’s later Beloved).

In this engaging and lavishly illustrated interview he talks about the context within which the book was conceived, its main themes, and how its original thesis relates to the contemporary understanding of “the Orient” as represented in the mass media. “That’s the power of the discourse of Orientalism. If you’re thinking about people and Islam, and about that part of the wold, those are the words you constantly have to use. To think past it, to go beyond it, not to use it, is virtually impossible, because there is no knowledge that isn’t codified in this way about that part of the world.” -Edward Said\n\nEdward Said: The Myth of “The Clash of Civilizations”\n\nDVD\n\nApp. 40 minutes\n\n2004-125\n\nIn this important lecture delivered at the University of Massachusetts, Edward Said takes aim at one of the central tenets of recent foreign policy thinking– that conflicts between different and “clashing civilizations” (Western, Islamic, Confucian) characterize the contemporary world.\n\nElection\n\nDVD\n\nApp. 103 minutes\n\n2022-5\n\nPerky, overachieving high schooler Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) gets on the nerves of social-studies teacher Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) to begin with, but after she launches her campaign for student-body president and his personal life starts to fall apart, things spiral out of control.

This summer Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is planning to remove Jewish settlers and return the disputed Gaza Strip to Palestinian control. But Israel is bracing for a reaction from the settlers in both Gaza and the West Bank. Israeli security forces are warning that extremists among the settlers could, with one major act of violence, raise the prospect of civil war in Israel or trigger a conflict with the wider Muslim world. As the possibility of peace once again seems real, FRONTLINE takes a close look at the small group of Israelis who are vowing to derail it.\n\nFrontline: The Jesus Factor\n\nDVD\n\nApp. 60 minutes\n\n2004-114\n\nAs an evangelical Christian, President Bush has something in common with the 46 percent of Americans who describe themselves as being “born again” or having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Often has the president recounted praying about major decisions facing the nation—but what do we actually know about the rudiments of George Bush’s faith? To what extent do the president’s spiritual beliefs impact or influence his political decision-making? And how closely do Bush’s religious views mirror those of the burgeoning—and politically influential—evangelical movement?\n\nFrontline: The Persuaders\n\nDVD\n\nApp. 90 minutes\n\n2005-16\n\nFRONTLINE takes an in-depth look at the multibillion-dollar “persuasion industries” of advertising and public relations and how marketers have developed new ways of integrating their messages deeper into the fabric of our lives. Through sophisticated market research methods to better understand consumers and by turning to the little-understood techniques of public relations to make sure their messages come from sources we trust, marketers are crafting messages that resonate with an increasingly cynical public. In this documentary essay, correspondent Douglas Rushkoff (correspondent for FRONTLINE’s “The Merchants of Cool”) also explores how the culture of marketing has come to shape the way Americans understand the world and themselves and how the techniques of the persuasion industries have migrated to politics, shaping the way our leaders formulate policy, influence public opinion, make decisions, and stay in power.\n\nFrontline: Sacred Ground\n\nDVD\n\nApp. 60 minutes\n\n2005-8\n\nWithin days of the September 11 attacks, the questions began: What should be built on the site of Ground Zero?

The film has been knocked over the years for padding conflict and stoking easy liberalism by making Poitier’s character in every socioeconomic sense a good catch: But what if Kramer had made this stranger a factory worker? Would the audience still find it as easy to accept a mixed-race relationship? But there’s no denying the drawing power of this movie, which gets most of its integrity from the stirring performances of Tracy and Hepburn. When the former (who had been so ill that the production could not get completion insurance) gives a speech toward the end about race, love, and much else, it’s impossible not to be affected by the last great moment in a great actor’s life and career.\n\nH\n\nHail Satan\n\nDVD\n\nApp. 95 minutes\n\n2019\n\nA documentary look at the rise and influence of the controversial religious group known as The Satanic Temple.\n\nThe Hangover\n\nDVD\n\nApp. 100 minutes\n\n2018-51\n\nThey planned a Vegas bachelor party that they would never forget.

But Rob’s business isn’t the only thing in his life that’s floundering–his needle skips the love groove when his longtime girlfriend Laura (newcomer Iben Hjejle) walks out on him. And this forces him to examine his past failed attempts at romance the only way he knows how!\n\nHijacking Catastrophe: 9/11, Fear, and the Selling of American Empire\n\nDVD\n\nApp. 64 minutes\n\n2004-124\n\nHijacking Catastrophe: 9/11, Fear & the Selling of American Empire examines how a radical fringe of the Republican Party used the trauma of the 9/11 terror attacks to advance a pre-existing agenda to radically transform American foreign policy while rolling back civil liberties and social programs at home. The documentary places the Bush Administration’s false justifications for war in Iraq within the larger context of a two-decade struggle by neoconservatives to dramatically increase military spending in the wake of the Cold War, and to expand American power globally by means of military force. At the same time, the documentary argues that the Bush Administration has sold this radical and controversial plan for aggressive American military intervention by deliberately manipulating intelligence, political imagery, and the fears of the American people after 9/11.\n\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy\n\nDVD\n\nApp. 109 minutes\n\n2018-25\n\nHere’s the absolutely hysterical, wonderfully wild, cosmic adventure comedy The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.

But is that an accurate portrayal of the facts? An eye-opening documentary with jaw-dropping revelations, Hot Coffee exposes how corporations spend millions on propaganda campaigns to distort our views of lawsuits–forever changing the civil justice system. By examining the impact of tort reform on the lives of ordinary citizens, the film shows how Americans give up their Constitutional rights in many ways without knowing it–for example, by voting for caps on damages or signing away their rights in contracts. Through interviews with politicians, judges, lawyers and ordinary citizens, first-time filmmaker and former public-interest lawyer Susan Saladoff delves into the facts of four cases to tear apart the conventional wisdom about “jackpot justice.”\n\nHow We Got to Now\n\nDVD\n\nApp. 360 minutes\n\n2018-28\n\nJoin best-selling author Steven Johnson to discover extraordinary stories behind six remarkable ideas that made modern life possible, the unsung heroes who brought them about, and the unexpected and bizarre consequences each of these innovations triggered.

Much of director David O. Russell’s philosophical humor is dense, talky, and impenetrable, leading critic Roger Ebert to observe that “it leaves the viewer out of the loop,” and suggesting that Russell’s screenplay (written with his assistant, Jeff Baena) is admirably bold yet frustratingly undisciplined. Russell’s ideas are big but his expression of them is frenetic, centering on the unlikely pairing of an environmentalist (Jason Schwartzman) and a firefighter (Mark Wahlberg) as they depend on existential detectives (Lily Tomlin, Dustin Hoffman) and a French nihilist (Isabelle Huppert) to make sense of their existential crises, brought on (respectively) by a two-faced chain-store executive (Jude Law) and his spokesmodel girlfriend (Naomi Watts), and the aftermath of 9/11’s terrorism. No brief description can do justice to Russell’s comedic conceit; you’ll either be annoyed and mystified or elated and delighted by this wacky primer for coping with 21st century lunacy. Deserving of its mixed reviews, I Heart Huckabees is an audacious mess, like life itself, and accepting that is the key to enjoying both.\n\nIdentity\n\nDVD\n\nApp. 90 minutes\n\n2018-142\n\nWhat if every choice we ever make was already made for us?

C. McGinley, Leila Kenzle, Bret Loehr), all take shelter at a desolate motel run by a nervous night manager (John Hawkes).
